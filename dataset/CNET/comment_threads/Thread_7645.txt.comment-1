Hi, I'm having constant lag spikes.
I use DPC Latency checker http://www.thesycon.de/deu/latency_check.shtml On both my desktop (using PCI wifi card) and my laptop I have lag spikes.
This is a screenshot of the spikes http://i.imgur.com/cyoLq.png .
Although it says its my hardware problems, I doubt its true, as it happens on both devices.
As a gamer this is truly irritating.
Do you have any idea how to fix this problem?
