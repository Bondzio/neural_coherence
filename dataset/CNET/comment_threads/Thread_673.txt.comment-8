I am almost sure that the hard drive has to go...Aftermarket has got you there my friend and I have not found a way to completely get everything out of a hard drive....though I'm sure there may be ways....you don't have a handy hard drive to just stick in there to confirm this is the problem....I would do what you were thinking of and buying another drive to run xp.... Let me ask you...if you have some files on your hard drive you don't want to lose....how is it formatted by Xp.....you might try getting these files on disc and completely reformatting the drive and then if you want to later on put these important files back on....I still think you should get another HD....this will prevent a lot of headache...
