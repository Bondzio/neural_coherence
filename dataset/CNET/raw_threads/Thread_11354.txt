At times, after a hibernate or just a long inactivity, I cannot get on line, I have to reboot. The PC has a Shuttle main board with built in NIC. Other PCs on my network can get on line ok as they have PC card NICs. Before I try this I thought I'd ask. I have a PC NIC that I can plug in. I want to disable the on board NIC in System, Hardware and install the PC NIC. Does anyone forsee any problems?
