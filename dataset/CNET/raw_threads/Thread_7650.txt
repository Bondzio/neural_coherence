I plugged the DSL into the router to get wireless internet. This worked for a couple of days then my range was shortened. I have the router downstairs and one of my computers up stairs, it always ued to get ''Very Good'' signal and now it is ''low'', ''very low'', or ''no signal''. I also get limited or no connectivity. Any suggestions? I'm not sure if the DSL has anything to do with the problem.

Next, a neighbor could have installed a Wifi system and now you compete for &quot;air space.&quot; Try another Wifi channel. I use 1, 6 and 11 and see which has less interference. Bob

Did your DSL provider give you one of those fancy new modems that has integral wireless? If so, that may be the source of the interference that Bob suggested might be coming from next door - but only to find it wasn't next door after all, it was right in your own place. Then you need to figure out how to turn the wireless function off in the modem. Otherwise, back to the usual suspects. There is no reason for DSL vs. cable, by itself, to affect wireless connectivity strength between the access point and the client. Also, check all the physical aspects - perhaps an antenna or something got bumped loose or maybe it was set back down in a different position after messing with it connecting the DSL? (Or maybe somebody has suddenly developed a fondness for popcorn... microwave ovens, which share the 2.4Ghz radio band, are a big source of wifi interference...) dw

My DSL modem doesnt have one of those wireless things built it. I just bought a D-Link DI-524 router and an external antenna and that fixed my problem. The store recommended if i lost signal still to put a pie tin under the antenna. This helps to reflect the signal and act as a ground for the signal. Once again, thanks for your time. -AR

There is little to no chance yours has the latest version from dlink.com -&gt; And yes, it works better now. It used to require a power cycle randomly from 5 days to 3 weeks. I was about to get an UPS to see if it was some power issue, but the new firmware since it was installed has made this box more of an appliance rather than something I have to check if there is a network glitch. bob

Software: Programs and operating system instructions that are loaded temporarily into the memory chips of the hardware, and then you can do what ever that set of instructions intends. Firmware: System instructions that are permanently loaded in hardware that tell it what to do. Sort of like software in the hardware, which is why they call it firmware. Wetware: One's brain. Your's is getting wetter now... Firmware for the D-Link 524 can be downloaded from this link: http://www.dlink.com/products/support.asp?pid=316&sec=0#firmware Note that the page has explicit instructions to figure out which version of the 524 you have. Your owner's manual has instructions on how to install the new firmware to the router. dw
