Everthing is running fine for a while until suddenly the HDD stops to 'operate' and the PC 'crashes' and subsequently returns to scenario 1. Firstly I am puzzled why I get this Ultra100 message because no controller Ultra100 is actually inserted in one of the PCI slots. Secondly I wonder why the HDD is sometimes detected and the other time not. During the faulty boot sequence I've also received the message 'check cables' - which I did but with no idea what to do - everything looked fine to me. Listening to the HDD it sounds like it sometimes simple stops 'turning' the disk. My motherboard is a Asus Cubx-E with a primary master / slave and secondary master / slave. Please note: I am not a Hardware Person - but I understand what to do if the answer is not written in techy language. Are my bios settings screwed?? (and why what that be - have not made any amendments to hard- or software - problem occured out of the blue). Your help is appreciated.

Presume this just started happening. Look to a power problem and, or possibly controller / drive fault. Do the standard things like run an external fan on the open case and see if it runs longer before a fault - could be drive cooling. Remove unecessary devices and see if it runs longer (less power consumption) Check the connections - both sides - drive and at controller and controller and PCI slot. Try changing slots if necessary which will require re-installing drivers etc. Back everything you need ASAP

A lot of ideas - I will start checking what you have suggested in the next couple of days and come back letting you know what the situation is. Your support is appreciated.
