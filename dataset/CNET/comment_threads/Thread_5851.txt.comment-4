But there are copies of said files back on the machine you made the DVDRW on.
Time to go get those.
A recurring lesson is that if you want to lose files, make sure there is only one copy on one &quot;thing.&quot; -&gt; Next up.
Go get ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY and GETDATABACK and see what they think.
If blank, then it's likely that you can send it to DRIVESAVERS and for a few hundred they'll see what can be done.
