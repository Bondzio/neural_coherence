thanks for your reply, bob.
i realized that i have four video cards in this machine, so i switched that display to one of the other cards and it seemed to solve the problem.
regarding the heat sinks, i recently vacuumed out the the entire unit, but prior to doing so, it had accumulated a lot of dust.
poor maintenance might have overheated my video card prior to the recent cleaning.. regards, jim
