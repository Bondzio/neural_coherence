Router firmware updated, too?
Try this: In the list of &quot;Preferred networks,&quot; click on the &quot;Remove&quot; button to remove the stored connection settings for the network.
After you do that, either &quot;Add&quot; the &quot;Preferred network&quot; again, or just try to connect to the detected network.
Any luck?
