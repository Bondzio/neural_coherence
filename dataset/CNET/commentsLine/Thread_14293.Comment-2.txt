no.
but let's define &quot;logging on.&quot; if you mean &quot;must the windows gui be logged in?&quot; that is, the name and password on the host be entered where you see the start button then the answer changes to &quot;yes.&quot; but under the hood there is a login occurring when a client connects and asks for connection to a share.
how deep must we go here?
