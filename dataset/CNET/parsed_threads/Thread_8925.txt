<s> We are looking to buy a color laser printer to print our concert tickets. </s>
<s> We are a non-profit organization with limited income. </s>
<s> I want to find a printer that initially wont cost us a fortune but I would also like to find one that wont cost us a fortune to run. </s>
<s> It needs to be a duplex printer that can handle about 1250 copies a month. </s>
<s> Does anyone have a suggestion? </s>
<s> Cheapest way to go would be a Brother but the duplexer throws the kink in, typically cost goes up with any of them with duplexe. </s>
<s> Thanks for the tip! </s>
<s> They are less expensive than other printers. </s>
<s> Has anyone used the Brother HL-4040CDN? </s>
<s> Most of the reviews I have read for the HL-4040CN are pretty good but I can't find many reviews for the HL-4040CDN. </s>
