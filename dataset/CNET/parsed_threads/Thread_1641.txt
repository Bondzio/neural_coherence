<s> Running a broadband wireless network with Netgear modem/router, two desktops, and one laptop. </s>
<s> Routine run of Spybot S&D today zapped my connectivity, and after three system restore operations, the problem is still there. </s>
<s> It tells me that this problem is occurring because ''the network did not assign a network address to the computer.'' </s>
<s> Indeed, running ipconfig shows the IP address and Subnet Mask as zeros. </s>
<s> All other machines not affected, but I am floundering attempting to rectify this problem. </s>
<s> I am running WinXP Home on the affected pc, and WinXP Pro on the other two. </s>

<s> Ping OK but Browser faulty. </s>
<s> My Windows MCE reported that it could not access the program guide , so it threw away my channel settings and guide data. </s>
<s> I restored my machine , messed about with DNS settings . </s>
<s> It got so that no browser would work , although i could ping anything . </s>
<s> This took maybe 12 hours work. </s>
<s> I used the winsockfix , and MCE started working again . </s>
<s> Absolutely brilliant. </s>
<s> I note this in case some other poor soul is fighting MCE in a similar way & it could save them a load of time. </s>
<s> Well im having similar problems. </s>
<s> Its kind of different though my computer is a desktop and i think his is a laptop then again. </s>

<s> Running XP Pro SP2, WinsockFix.exe restored my wireless connectivity flawlessly. </s>
<s> Thanks for the direction. </s>
<s> I was having the same problem with the &quot;network not assigning network address&quot; and WIN SOCK FIX corrected it with no problems. </s>

<s> I downloaded AnchorFree's Hotspot Shield to hide my real IP so that I could watch it. </s>
<s> [When I installed it, my pc appeared to re-discover my wireless connection, although maybe that was supposed to happen]. </s>
<s> When I quit Hotspot Shield, my computer said I was still fully connected to the network and internet, however no pages were loading, or email, msn etc. </s>
<s> This morning I reset my network and modem to try and fix this issue. </s>
<s> The 2 Macs connected back fine instantly, but my pc showed the &quot;network did not assign a network address&quot; error. </s>

<s> It has worked fine up until now. </s>
<s> This has been driving me nuts all day, any help will be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Well I disabled my network password. </s>
<s> And now I can connect. </s>
<s> Although when I enable the password I am get the good-old &quot;network did not assign a network address&quot; error. </s>
<s> This is with the correct password entered as well, as when a wrong password in entered it doesn't connect to the network at all like normal. </s>
<s> Anyone got any idea why I can only connect when I have no password? </s>
<s> Im not too happy about using an insecure network.... </s>
