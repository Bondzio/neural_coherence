i have the disk, but it is an upgrade version.
i remember that when i installed it on the disk containing my window xp, it searched for the previous version (proof of ownership).
if i start with a new hard drive, the program won't be there for verification.
i just ran into a case where my old microsoft frontpage had a problem.
i uninstalled it, and tried to install from scratch.
i couldn't do it because it was an update version, and i did not have the disc for the windows 98 frontpage.
