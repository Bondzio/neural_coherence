1.1.1	Hello , For about a year and a half , I 've had a 22 & quot ; SyncMaster 2232 BW , which I 'm very happy with quality-wise .	St
1.1.2	However , for the last six months or so , it has been having problems turning on .	St
1.1.3	It used to turn on along with the computer , and then go black when it reached the desktop , at which point I 'd have to turn it on and off , having it blink each time , until it eventually turned black again .	St
1.1.4	After having repeated this three or four times , it 'd work just fine , and there 'd be no problems until I shut it off for a longer period of time again .	St
1.1.5	Annoying , but something I could live with .	St
1.1.6	However , lately , after I 've been running dual-monitors with an old 17 & quot ; Philips monitor for a while , it has gotten worse .	St
1.1.7	It now takes way longer before my screen is past the blinking state , and I have to turn it on and off close to 20 times .	St
1.1.8	It 's only my primary screen that has this issue , and plugging it in and out has n't helped .	St
1.1.9	Has anyone had similar problems ?	Ques
1.1.10	I 've read about bad capacitators , but I 'd rather be sure that that is in fact the issue , before I invest in new parts .	St
1.1.11	Hoping to soon have a normal screen , Koldby	St
1.2.1	hey i 've had the same problem , actually the solution is rather simple , all you have to do is open the monitor an look for faulty capacitors i 've had three blown , just replaced then and now the monitor is working as new	St
1.3.1	I 've heard that the cause is probably are check capacitors that used in this display .	St
1.3.2	I 'd suggest to find a tech advice .	St
