<s> I have a Compaq Presario desktop that won't start-up. </s>
<s> When you push the power button the lights come on and the monitor stays in the sleep mode. </s>
<s> I was told that the motherboard or processor were bad. </s>
<s> So, I purchased a new Abit VA-10 motherboard and Athlon XP processor. </s>
<s> I installed both items, and the computer still has the same problem. </s>
<s> Please help!! </s>
<s> What else could be wrong with the computer? </s>
<s> In a situation as this, I might try to boot the computer with only the power supply, motherboard, CPU/HSF and the speaker. </s>
<s> If you get no beep, one or more of these are bad. </s>
<s> Strip the machine of all but essentials needed to boot. </s>
<s> This means power supply MB, processor, RAM, and video display card. </s>
<s> Make sure everything is properly seated. </s>
<s> You might put your old MB back as, if the symptoms are identical, it probably is not your problem. </s>
<s> Now, switch it on and observe if all fans come on and stay on. </s>
<s> Do you hear any beeps? </s>
<s> Typically you will get only 1. </s>
<s> If fans twitch and then stop, your power supply has shut down because of a load problem and you need to find it. </s>
<s> If the fans run but the machine will not enter POST or you get beep codes, you are dealing with a problem with one of the few devices connected. </s>
<s> Add in cards, drives, etc. </s>
<s> can load the power supply. </s>
<s> It can also be the entire problem but first you need to narrow it down to these possiblilities. </s>
<s> I find more often than not that the Compaq power supply is kaput. </s>
<s> Even if it twitches, not all voltages are present or stable. </s>
<s> Compaq supplies some pretty wimpy p/s units, so swap it out. </s>
<s> The real bad news, even though you swapped out the mtrbds. </s>
<s> if the p/s unit was the cause and *if* it was bad-bad-bad componet it may take out new replacement componets as well due to bad power, keep that it might if you seem to be chasing your tail or multiple problems. </s>
<s> Borrow a known good p/s unit and just test it with minmium system, FD, video, and ram, any beeps, etc. </s>
<s> The other posters suggestions can take over from here. </s>
<s> Don't take anything for granted, test it. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> circa 2013 just moved and the desktop had not been used for quite some time. </s>
<s> Green light on the back goes on but goes off when I push the on button in front. </s>
<s> Light stays off unless I switch to 230 volts and back to 110 on the back of the unit and unploug and replug the unit. </s>
<s> No other lights or fans or beeps occur during these processes. </s>
<s> Time for a new desktop? </s>
<s> The unit is a compaq presario SR5010NX desktop very slightly used as I have laptops and tablets I use more often. </s>
<s> This thread is more than 3228 days old. </s>
<s> It is very likely that it does not need any further discussion and replying to it will serve no purpose. </s>
<s> However, if you feel it is necessary to make a new reply, you can still do so. </s>
