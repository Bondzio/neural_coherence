If you aren't going to use the computer for more than a couple of hours, I would shut it down.
The time saved by using the Hibernate function is minimal, and I'm sorry Microsoft, but hibernate has always had problems.
Sleep is a viable option for short durations, such as an hour or less, and/or if you need your computer to be up and running in a real hurry.
But powering it down and allowing Windows to reboot when you need it, will always save you money, hardware usage, and headaches.
If you are in a hurry to reboot Windows, try a Solid State Drive for your operating system and programs.
Mine boots faster from scratch than it ever did coming out of sleep mode with a regular Hard Disk Drive, and with fewer glitches.
That's just my experienced layman's opinion.
