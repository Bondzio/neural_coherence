Which Windows are you talking about?
Windows XP and Vista support 4 gigabytes of RAM, minus any hardware devices that contain their own memory.
More expensive editions of Windows Server come in 32-bit edition but can use PAE to access up to 64 gigabytes of memory.
I believe if a computer comes with 4 gigabytes of RAM or more, it will almost certainly have 64-bit Windows preinstalled.
Or a 64-bit Linux distro, which is my preferred option.
At least when you have 4 gigabytes of RAM, you'll still be able to access a couple of hundred megs more than if you had 3 gigabytes...
