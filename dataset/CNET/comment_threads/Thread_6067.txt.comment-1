I am a graphic artist/web designer looking for a new computer.
I have always used PCs until I recently started a new job where macs are used.
I like the simple design of the iMac but don't want to give up a lot of power and options that the PC seems to offer.
How fast is the G5 1.8Ghz compared to the Pentium 4 with 3.0Ghz?
I am still far more comfortable using the PC, but if the iMac is the better system adusting will only be a minor problem.
If you could give me the pros and cons of each I would greatly appreciate it.
Thanks...Nicole
