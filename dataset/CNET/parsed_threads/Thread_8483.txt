<s> I replaced a Lynksys router with Belkin N+ router. </s>
<s> I am having internet connection issues. </s>
<s> I worked with Belkin support. </s>
<s> They updated the firmware, changed channel but the wireless internet speed is 20% of the cable modem speed. </s>
<s> I have 2 laptops with windows Xp. </s>
<s> I also would like to connect my 1TB portable drive to the USB port. </s>
<s> Please suggest the settings for this router. </s>
<s> I will be so greatful. </s>
<s> Did you also replace all your interface cards in your PC's. </s>
<s> You will not run N unless all your equipment is N. The N routers are designed to run N best. </s>
<s> They will run G and B also but that does not mean they do as good a job as router designed for those. </s>
<s> One of the main differences is the antenna layout. </s>
<s> First plug directly into the router with a lan cable and see if it runs faster. </s>
<s> You can also place your PC as close as possible to your router running on the wireless and see if it runs faster. </s>
<s> Thanks for this insight. </s>
<s> I thought, it might have something to do with &quot;N&quot; but not enough to know that my interface cards need to support &quot;N&quot;. </s>
<s> I have not changed any interface cards on the computers and do not plan to. </s>
<s> So, I will be getting the &quot;G&quot; router. </s>
<s> Any suggestions one better than other. </s>
<s> I have ordered the Linksys (As I used to have that). </s>
<s> If there is another suggestion, please advise. </s>
<s> Thanks.. </s>
<s> Wireless N has no advantages over G in that regard. </s>
<s> In fact, wireless B is faster than most broadband other than those advertised as &quot;turbo&quot; and such. </s>
<s> Wireless G is already 8x or faster than average broadband. </s>
<s> The only advantage that N would provide over G would be within your local area network. </s>
