hello everybody, i wanna upgrade my 5 years old laptop with a desktop computer for doing graphic design (not multimedia).
basically i would like to build a desktop making use of the latest technology hoping to have a system to comfortably work with on years to come.
what configuration/parts should i consider?
i believe a budget up to 3000 is reasonable, could be more if some more expensive parts can give me a boost in performance/productivity.
thanks!
