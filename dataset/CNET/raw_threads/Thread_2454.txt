In the past 6 months it has gotten painfully slow. I can't play music and open any other program at the same time. I had 256MB ram and it always used to work fine. I'm not running anything different. I've run various spyware and virus removal programs and started deleting programs I didn't use and killed most of the stuff runing in the system tray. That didn't help. I then tried adding more RAM. I now have 512, but there has been no improvement. I assume the next step would be to reformat the HD and reinstall windows, but if it came with a XP cd, I can't find it (I don't think it did). Is there anything else I can try before I chuck this thing in the dumpster? I don't claim to be a computer expert, and am not comfortable jumping into bios etc... Any help is appreciated!

When msconfig opens click the startup tab, make sure that every thing is checked than click the disable all button, then the ok button and restart the system. The system will reboot and tell you that you ran msconfig startup click ok and see if you PC runs any faster. HP puts a recovery partion on the HD look at you rownes book for info. John

I recently saw one that had more than 26,000 temp. internet files. It could hardly run at all. It took more than 30 minutes for the machine to delete these files. Afterward, it ran just fine. Best of Luck

Trying to clean spyware, other internet junks etc will never make your PC run as fast as it did when you got it new. Most spyware and other programs (which is slowing your computer) have some registry entry in your OS and unless you know how to clean these from the registry, you will never be able to solve your problem. Most commercial registry cleaner will do a partial job, I have not yet seen one which does a clean and complete job of cleaning. If I were you, I would first save all all the files, folders, picture etc. and then format the drive. After formatting drive, use the CD's which came with your computer to reinstall everything. It is not as hard as most people think. If you need help, let me know I can show you the steps.

Go to start, programs, accessories, system tools, syatem restore and then choose a back date to restore your machine. I would choose a date at least one month before the date wheh you started to notice your machine slowing down. Remember after restoring, you may have to install the software which you may have installed after the restore date you choose. Hope this helps.

Whe I reformatted the harddisk I got the old speed back. Peter

The cure surfaced after a couple of hours checking the software drivers and I shifted to the hardware. Booting the machines with just the memory, hard drive and video sped things up. One machine turned out to be the failure of the CD burner to register properly while booting and it seemed to seize the machine from time to time while I was using Explorer, or My computer. The cure for that machine was to redo the firmware BIOS of the CD/DVD. The second machine cured itself when I left the CD/DVD off of the chain and rebooted several times without it and then put the CD/DVD back on the chain and allowed it to find itself again. I suspect that the second machines CD/DVD will fail again. I have a third machine with something similar a CD that fails to register from time to time and I have recommended that the owner just replace the CD or go to a more recent CD/DVD as there is not a BIOS for that older CD. I have fixed countless other machines that slowed down due to failure of hardware. Slow down can be caused by hardware failure or software failure. Norm

It will take it back the way it was when it came out of the box. Just be sure to save anything you want to keep to CD or floppy first.
