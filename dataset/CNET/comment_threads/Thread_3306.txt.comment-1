Hello, I decided it would be a great idea to re-install my Win XP-Pro OS because it seemed to be having too many problems.
When I backed up the drivers, I must have missed a very important one.
Now I've searched the net for this, but to no avail.
I'm running XP, my dvd is a Matshita SR-8176 cd/dvd-rom(working fine until I did this) My error keeps saying that cannot find ittimg3.dll...I don't have the disk for my dvd-rom...please help!!
!
