10831	0	308401	2856967	NR	Sean1960	9/13/08 6:22 AM	1.22128692E12	PC Died	I came home yesterday a my comp was off, it was on when I left. Now it will not turn on at all. I took the cover off and when I push the power button all the fans spin for a second and then stop. There is a green led on the mobothat is on, but nothing else happens. Is the PSU shot? Is there anything else I can check? Thanks Sean

On the other vid card 1 cap is very slightly leaking but comp still works. Any idea what would have caused this? Could the old psu caused this?

Type BAD CAPS on google.com and you find pictures and why this happened. You also find these parts found their way into not only motherboards but power supplies and cards. Bob
