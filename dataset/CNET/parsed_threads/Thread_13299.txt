<s> It seems there is a very wide difference in opinion between Cnet reviewers and and consumers regarding printers. </s>
<s> I'm looking for a AIO wireless for a new imac and once I access a review the opposite seems to be the case made by actual users which is confusing. </s>
<s> Anybody have any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> I don't have an Apple to compare to or answer questions but when I asked my fellow moderators something similar they gave a nod to the Canon mx870. </s>
<s> It's been nice and my only quibble is it's size. </s>

<s> Yes Bob I have a friend in town who uses the 870 with Mac ,all he said was WOW it does a great job but it IS large. </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> One thing I forgot to mention was wireless. </s>
<s> So any suggestion based on that requirement would be appreciated JJ </s>
<s> Is the easiest wifi printer I've ever used. </s>
<s> I can't speak about the Apple side of the wifi but it's very nice here. </s>
<s> BEWARE of wifi experts that hide the ssid, use MAC filters or try to get by with WEP! </s>

<s> It IS wireless and as I stated in a prior post I have a friend in town who uses one WIRELESSLY with a Mac and he told me it works very well. </s>
<s> Now that someone else noted the mx870 let me share one more thing. </s>
<s> It has an Automatic Document Feeder or ADF. </s>
<s> While it is only single sided it has worked very well and worth noting. </s>
<s> Be sure to have help to unpack or move the thing around as it is rather big but not bigger than my first PC. </s>
