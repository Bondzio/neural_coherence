<s> awesome, i will take your advice, so that's the ram i need to fit that mobo in the link you sent? </s>
<s> i'm always a little cautious because i ordered the wrong ram once. </s>
<s> thank you for your input! </s>
<s> kits... 2-1GB DIMMs. </s>
<s> Let us know how it works. </s>

<s> my son (10 yrs) bought the system for $125, 180gb hd, speakers, lcd monitor with a few scratches, not too shabby! </s>
<s> By the way....as soon as you get the RAM, unplug the PC, check the mfg instructions re installing RAM, remove all old RAM and install new RAM. </s>
<s> Then download and run Memtest86+ to test the RAM say overnight. </s>
<s> Assuming no errors...button up the PC and enjoy ! </s>
<s> Good experience for a Father and Son. </s>
<s> And last...shoot us a note on how it went. </s>

<s> I pulled the old ram out, assuming it had 2 sticks of 256 because it showed in bios as only 1/2 gig, to my surprise it had 2 sticks of 512. </s>
<s> I put the new sticks of 1 gig each in and it is only recognizing 1 gig and single channel, can anyone shed some light on how to get this motherboard to recognize both gig and as dual channel? </s>
<s> thanks! </s>
<s> work in slot 1 or A, then see if they both work in slot 2 or B. </s>
<s> If the both work in both slots, the retry bot at the same time. </s>
<s> Also send a note to GSkill asking for assistance. </s>
<s> Keep us posted. </s>

<s> someone said i should flash the bios but which one should i flash it with? </s>
<s> none of them say anything about ram, only cpu http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Support/Motherboard/BIOS_Model.aspx?ProductID=2507 </s>
<s> first including testing the DIMMs and contacting GSkill. </s>
<s> Reason ...flashing the BIOS can leave you DOA where normally only a new BIOS chip can save you. </s>
<s> It might be the case a mild bump in voltage for the DIMMs might help too. </s>
