<s> hey all, i am having wd 320gb and hitachi 500gb external drives. </s>
<s> both of them r having same problem now. </s>
<s> i dont know what happened to them, problem is that if i copy anything from any laptop or any pc it copied easily, last night i have copied more than 200gb data. </s>
<s> if i copy any thing from hdd to any laptop and pc it gives error in the very start to try again that file can not be copied. </s>
<s> i need all my data from these hdds, can anyone help me out? </s>
<s> Be sure these drives are not USB powered. </s>
<s> If they are you see thousands of complaints like this. </s>
<s> Fix? </s>
<s> Pull the HDD out of that USB case and into a powered HDD case. </s>

<s> thanx, i'll check and post again </s>
<s> Be sure we never &quot;repair&quot; or &quot;chkdsk&quot; those drives. </s>
<s> You admitted that there is no backup so any repairs can cause more damage. </s>
<s> If I put the drive into a powered case I usually see the drive and half the time I can copy out the contents (nod to Roadkil's Unstoppable Copier?) </s>
<s> But if there are errors we have to consider cloning the drive and trying the titles noted at the top of this forum on the clone. </s>
<s> Some folk don't do that clone step and post they lost it all. </s>

<s> copy the partition with 3rd party partition wizard. </s>
<s> What's the difference between the 1st, 2nd and 3rd parties? </s>
