Normally, the DSL signal is available at all telephone jacks at a premise. You should be able to connect your modem to any available jack. Filters are needed only on the actual telephones in your home to prevent modem noise on your voice line. If your modem won't work on a needed jack, then you'll need to either work it out yourself (trace phone lines through your home) or have someone do it for you (normally a service charge involved).
