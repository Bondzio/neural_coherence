<s> I want a copier/printer preferably. </s>
<s> I will be using it mainly for printing text and copying text for homeschooling purposes (one child). </s>
<s> I'd like it to be able to: handle occasional cardstock sheets from printing or copying one ink cartridge fairly cheap (obviously color is optional) Automatic feed I need the printer to be fairly inexpensive as well. </s>
<s> Max $170! </s>
<s> And I don't want to have to replace the ink cartridge ALL the TIME. </s>
<s> It won't get a ton of use but a fair amount. </s>
<s> I have Windows XP if that helps any. </s>
<s> I have reviewed a few different printers and can not decide between the HP Laserjet P1005 (which is not a copier) Or one of the All-in-One Canon Pixma MP520 or MP610. </s>
<s> i don't really have use for photo printing since I send all that off to be done. </s>
<s> So the all-in-ones seem like a waste of Money to me. </s>
<s> So any other suggestions for me? </s>
<s> Anyone? </s>
<s> Thank you very much in advance! </s>

<s> All paper stock has a &quot;pound&quot; rating. </s>
<s> Get your cardstock poundage and then check the specs on the printers under consideration. </s>
<s> Be aware that consumer printers that don't do photos will likely not be in the usual store shelves. </s>
<s> I also see multifunction printers for under 99 bucks that last about 2 years. </s>
<s> Why isn't that aceptable? </s>
<s> In closing I set up the office and home with the HP k550. </s>
<s> For scanning we use a scanner. </s>

<s> a Dell Photo All-In-One Printer 964. </s>
<s> It can print on thick paper, photo paper, etc. </s>
<s> I usually get my photos printed at a place like Walmart, cheaper. </s>
<s> Ink I purchase is around $23 a cartridge and I use the cheap ones. </s>
<s> My printer is no longer made. </s>
<s> Make a trip to Office Max or Staples and check out the printers and the prices of ink for them. </s>
<s> A nice sales person should be willing to help you. </s>
