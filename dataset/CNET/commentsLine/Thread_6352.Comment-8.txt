in my previous tests, i always left the processor in because i thought it would have no weight on the matter.
when i performed your test i removed everything (including the processor) and only connected the psu and the case speaker to the motherboard.
when i did this the psu fan ran consistently until i cut the power, and when i replaced the processor, it went back to only turning on for a second.
does this mean that the processor is the problem?
