When i left I left my laptop on with the phone cord plugged into my modem. Well while i was gone lightning struck the telephones in my town and it went through my modem well now i cant get on the internet with my laptop. Now My computer says the modem is working properly but to protect my system it can go &quot;off the hook&quot; because of the strong current or voltage that went through it so can anyone tell me how to fix this problem or will i need a new modem? FYI: heres exactly wat the pop up box says about my modem. Modem Warning The modem has detected a current ot voltage level on the telphone line which could damage your hardware. To protect your system,the modem has not been allowed to go off-hook.
