get me once i may try again, get me twice shame on me.
get me three times, i don't think so.
i use western digital for past 3 years i have 1 120 gig, 3 80's, and 2 40's not to mention various others 10 & under.
only one i have ever had a problem with was a real old 850mb back in late 90's.
segate used to be a problem drive too but have now since straightened up.
i had a hole stack of them ranging up to 8 gig before i suddenly stopped running into problem ones.
so i'd try them again on day.
so i'd try a western digital, seagate, mabey a samsung, hitachi, or fujitsu.
i'd stay away from anything like ibm or some off brand and steer away from maxtor.
unless you really like giving them your money.
this is just my opinion, others may vary.
