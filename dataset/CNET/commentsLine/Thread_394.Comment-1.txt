hi there-- i have two machines with soyo 6ba+ motherboards in them, i am finally done with various projects i needed them for and can do maintenance on them.
both motherboards seem to be working fine, but i have the original non-updated bios's in both.
should i flash them or leave them alone?
thanks - fj
