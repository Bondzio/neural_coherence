can i call it a game?
well it is a puzzle which is a game so let's share what i tried in the past.
1. server.
any old pc can be a server.
upside - many are free.
downside - all of them seem to draw 100 watts.
2. a simple server like  upside - found for 25 bucks.
downside - not too speedy.
lesson - not a single small nas is what i call fast.
the issue is the link.
it's all of 100 megabit, usb 2 is 480 and sata is 1500 megabit.
3. next up.
a netbook.
walmart has a 228 buck netbook.
might be the cure to item 1. bob
