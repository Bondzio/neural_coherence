fred, motto: just enough is never enough.
enough is too much.
too much is just right!
so, we're talking about socket 478 motherboards equipped with a chipset supporting 800mhz system bus and prescott (psc) cpus.
yep, there's a small public documented info amount.
at present the landscape is that prescott requires at least fmb 1.5 (fmb means flexible motherboard guidelines).
so, the main correlation is between cpu - and - motherboard's fmb#.
for example, installing a psc fmb 1.5 cpu into a fmb 1.0 motherboard could not work at all - or - work unsatisfactorily.
i'd show two examples: - full prescott compatibility section of this page .
- intel's genuine motherboards.
one can see from this page the minimum aa# for psc support.
