1.1.1	I was wondering if anyone could tell me how much of a performance gap there is between the T7200 ( 2GHz , 4MB L2 Cache , 667MHz FSB ) and the T5600 ( 1.83GHz , 2MB L2 Cache , 667MHz FSB ) .	St
1.1.2	How noticable would the difference be in gaming and application performance ?	Ques
1.1.3	I 'm thinking of getting a Dell Inspiron 1505 and am debating whether or not to spend the extra cash ( $ 75 ) to get the upgraded processor ( I 've already put all the other highest end components available on it ) .	St
1.2.1	^its an E1505	St
1.3.1	10 % clock boost and 3-4 % boost for the added cache .	St
1.4.1	Do you think this boost in performance justifies an additional $ 75 ?	Ques
1.4.2	Will the increase be noticable in gaming ?	Ques
1.5.1	but for gaming , the next higher video card will always give you a bigger performance boost .	St
1.5.2	so if $ 75 buys a better video card , then that 's where you should spend your cash .	St
1.6.1	I would ... but the E1505 only offers the ATI Mobility Radeon X1400 and the Nvidia GeForce Go 7300 .	St
1.6.2	Although the Nvidia costs $ 30 more in the config , I 've read and seen benchmark scores that support the ATI being the better GPU .	St
1.6.3	I 've also since read educated opinions that suggest the 2GHz processor will have a very minimal effect on gaming , especially considering I can only put a middle of the road GPU in .	St
