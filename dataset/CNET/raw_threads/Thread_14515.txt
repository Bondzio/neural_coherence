I will be upgrading my graphics card to HD5850 1GB in few months- so the board should be compatible with this card too. I will be using my PC to watch movies and play games like Modern warfare 2/ GTA 4 etc at the Highest settings. Thanks

Sorry for the screw up. B. The i7-920 still works out to about $280 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115202
