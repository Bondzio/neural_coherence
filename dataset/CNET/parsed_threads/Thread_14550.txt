<s> am newbie to burning dvds. </s>
<s> i just bought the nec nd3550a burner. </s>
<s> so far i have burned 6 cds and dvds with no coasters. </s>
<s> i have been burning a iso image to memorex 8x disks. </s>
<s> i know i must get better quality discs but i am just learning about burning and media. </s>
<s> now i burned the iso using nero and it took 35 min. </s>
<s> i wanted to try to burn at 12x or 16x but i could not. </s>
<s> i have read on the net that people using 8x media can burn at 12x and 16x. </s>
<s> the highest nero will let me burn the disc is 8x. </s>
<s> on top of the spec sheet for my burner it says ide/atapi ultra mode compatible. </s>
<s> then it states dvd+r,-r writing at 16x cav. </s>
<s> what does the cav stand for? </s>
<s> here is my log from the burn. </s>
<s> thanks for any help i get. </s>

<s> Burning at 1/2 the rated media speed for years. </s>
<s> Then again, I haven't had any issues to write about. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> &gt;i burned the iso (image) using nero and it took 35 min&lt; You burned an ISO image of what, exactly? </s>
<s> Looking at the Log file you attached, it looks like you burned 4464MB or about 4.2 GB of data. </s>
<s> At 8X, or about 11Mb/s, that would take 406 seconds or about 6.75 minutes. </s>
<s> That's pretty fast. </s>
<s> Without knowing how the data was structured, I'd assume the difference in time was consumed in caching the files and building the ISO image on the hard disk. </s>
<s> If you were writing a CD, which can hold just 1/7 of the DVD data, it would have completed in about 1/7 of the time. </s>
<s> Is that why 38 minutes seems so long? </s>
<s> You want to write 4.2 GB of data in 5 minutes? </s>
<s> You'll have to wait a few years, or spend a lot more money on equipment and you'll still run into some physical constraints. </s>
<s> Using a faster DVD writer, and higher speed disks MIGHT halve your WRITE time, saving 200 seconds off the 38 minute creation time. </s>
<s> Is it worth the higher price of the medium and the risk of a failed write operation? </s>
<s> You assume that just writing files to DVD is the only factor. </s>
<s> Creating an image means reading every byte, structuring the image, creating the image track layout and header, writing the data to the hard disk, then transferring it to the DVD. </s>
<s> That's a CPU and disk intensive process. </s>
<s> Nero is pretty danged fast already, but the only way to speed the process more, is a to write dedicated, optimized code and run it on a high speed, dedicated system, maybe running a few GB of RAM, dual processors and a nice quad SATA 300 RAID in striped mode. </s>
<s> Nero tests your system, and determines the practical maximum data rate. </s>
<s> That includes system bottlenecks you might not recognize as the bus waits for disk I/O and RAM. </s>
<s> Yes, some people might be able to write disks at 12x or 16 x, but that means the hardware, system and medium are all capable of supporting that speed. </s>
<s> There is no ''cheat'' to enable higher speeds. </s>
<s> Nero is designed to give you RELIABLE data writing, which means it selects the SAFE option, not the FAST option. </s>
<s> The Memorex 8X medium is fine. </s>
<s> BTW - the vendor ''marks'' the maximum reliable speed on the disk. </s>
<s> The DVD writer and Nero read that code and respect it. </s>
<s> Trying to write to a disk at speeds higher than rated is a recipe for data loss. </s>
<s> It's not worth saving a few seconds at the cost of re-doing the work or losing data. </s>
<s> Besides, faster media may not be the issue. </s>
<s> Also, there is a concern that faster disks use a more ''volitile'' dye because it can be written to with a briefer laser pulse. </s>
<s> That may mean that long term exposure to heat or other light sources might degrade the data. </s>
<s> I tend to buy and use the most stable media I can get, rather than the fastest. </s>
<s> Different manufacturers will certify there disks for longevity, as well as max write speed. </s>
<s> Just a thought to consider. </s>
<s> Other speed options? </s>
<s> If you don't know about On-the-fly writing and the potential issues, you probably should trust Nero's choices. </s>
<s> Instead, prep your layout, save the parameters and do your disk writes when the machine is idle, like during lunch hour. </s>
<s> &gt;writing at 16x cav. </s>
<s> what does the cav stand for?&lt; Don't confuse CD speeds and DVD speeds. </s>
<s> A CD reads data at 150kB/s at 1X, sufficient for an audio stream. </s>
<s> A DVD reads at about 1.3 MB/s (1,352kB/s) or about 9x faster, to accomodate the base video data rate. </s>
<s> If you are burning a DVD at 16x CAV, that's around 21.6 MB/s, which is faster than many hard disks ran, just a few years ago. </s>
<s> CAV means Constant Angular Velocity. </s>
<s> That means it spins at a constant rotational speed. </s>
<s> Some devices vary the speed so they maintain a Constant Linear Velocity (CLV) as the head's radius position changes. </s>
