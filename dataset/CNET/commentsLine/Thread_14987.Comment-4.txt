try the bare minimum parts for beeps.
power supply (450 is a good number, so let's leave that), motherboard, cpu and the speaker.
no other parts are required.
if no beeps, then remove the case and put it on cardboard.
no beeps?
you are looking at the possible bad parts.
just fyi, the bad part may not be defective.
for instance some machines don't boot when the cmos battery is dead.
or if a jumper is in the wrong place.
or when the cmos values are wildly off.
try ... resetting the bios settings with that jumper... bob
