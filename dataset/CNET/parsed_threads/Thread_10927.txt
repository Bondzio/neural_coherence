<s> okay i have an older motherboard (m5SAA), it has a socket 7 interface. </s>
<s> I know i know they are ancient and stuff but i refurbish older computer parts and make cheap computers that people can use such as me and my brother and sister. </s>
<s> Anyway the motherboard wont respond to any differences in core voltage bus speed or multiplier. </s>
<s> I have also tried different processors. </s>
<s> So it will turn on but no response from the monitor or HD or floppy. </s>
<s> Is there a way to fix this problem. </s>
<s> Hi. </s>
<s> Any beeps from the speaker or signal from the keyboard? </s>
<s> To check the board if it's good, turn it on and see if the Num lock, KeyLock and Scroll Lock lights up. </s>
<s> Also listen for beeps from the speakers. </s>
<s> and does the power supply match the type? </s>
<s> Need a better explanation as to what you mean by &quot;no response from the HD or floppy&quot;. </s>
<s> Without video on the monitor it sure is tough to troubleshoot because getting into the BIOS can be so useful. </s>
<s> Nevermind i know that i havent responded in a while so dont worry about im going to just throw the motherboard away, thanks anyway. </s>
