for windows 98, me, 2000, or xp home/pro, all these operating systems run great games with 512mb of ram with a graphics card, either agp or pci express with 128 mb of memory on board.
right now, technology is at a crossroads, the new operating system; vistaaaaaa, ugh, supposedly uses a 1gb or ram, so it might be a good idea to have 2 gb or more just in case, getting back to graphics; go with nvidia or ati for a graphics card, make sure your motherboard supports either agp or pci express before you buy one.
nvidia has already released their new line of graphic cards, ati is about to release theirs around april.
i suggest waiting till ati releases theirs, has the best graphics, or go ahead and get a nvidia graphics card if you can't wait.
remember, in terms of graphics, very few games even use 256mb of memory for both the computer and the gpu of the graphics card; like the saying &quot;if it ain't broken, don't fix it!&quot;
