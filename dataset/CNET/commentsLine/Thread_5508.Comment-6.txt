if there is drivers that you installed originally, try reinstalling.
make sure that the drive itself is working.
do you hear anything when you plug it in?
if it gave you the message about formatting, possible the drive itself has failed.
i have one also that have the same characterized that you described.
if the tips that i mention don't work, i thing that your drive is dead.
contact the manufacture if it's under warranty.
good luck.
