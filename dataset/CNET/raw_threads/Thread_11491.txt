I will not be doing any gaming but I do plan on doing video editing, photo editing using Adobe CS 3 and quite possible using dual monitors.

If it was mine I'd really look at the 7770 and Haswell	Link about it. http://www.pcworld.com/article/2040319/build-the-ultimate-intel-haswell-pc-for-under-1000.html I like a lot about that. I could skip the SSD and change the GPU to what I noted above.

If not then I might be better of buying 2 of these: GIGABYTE GV-N760OC-2GD REV2.0 GeForce GTX 760 2GB 256-bit GDDR5 PCI Express 3.0 HDCP Ready WindForce 3X 450W Video Card. As long as I can keep the price of my mobo, CPU, and graphics whether integrated or not at no more than $1000.

You could drop the ssd and boost the GPU but all your choice. Also you could go without any gpu and install later. http://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/Intel/Core_i7_3770K_Ivy_Bridge_GPU/21.html puts it on par with the usual low end 720 cards. Bob

Actually, I won't be doing much if any video editing until sometime next year. In your previous post you mentioned the Haswell and I have been giving that very serious thought along with an Asus mobo (because it supports dual monitors) and now I am investigating a psu that will be compatible with the Haswell which as I understand it needs a psu that can work with a very low voltage when the cpu is in &quot;sleep mode&quot;.
