1.1.1	Purchased an identical hdd for my Toshiba 6100 laptop .	St
1.1.2	With an IDE cable adapter I will install it into my desktop as a slave .	St
1.1.3	With the use of Norton ghost or other mirror software I hope to mirror and back up daily my laptop hdd onto the desktop slave hdd over my network .	St
1.1.4	The reason for identical drives is so I can swap it into my laptop in the`event the current hdd craps out ( calling this toshiba hdd crap is being kind , I am on my third unit in two years ! )	St
1.1.5	My main concern is will I be able to boot from it like nothing even happen .	St
1.1.6	I dont want to deal with recoveries or reload my OS I just want to plug it in and go .	St
1.1.7	I spoke with the Norton people but I get the feeling there not sure .	St
1.1.8	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	I used a pair of those 3.65 2.5 inch drive adaptors and Norton 's Ghost .	St
1.2.2	The clone ran and then the new drive booted in the laptop .	St
1.2.3	Painless .	St
1.2.4	Of course I 've done this dozens of times , but if you want 100 % ironclad it will work , then even I ca n't give you that .	St
1.2.5	No one will .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Bob , thanks for your feedback .	Polite
1.3.2	I agree it should work but if I seem skepticale its because I have read otherwise .	St
1.3.3	There has been some talk about a glitch with ghost that prevents boot up or log on with the mirrored drive .	St
1.3.4	Something about windows not reconizing the drive letters now that the slave is a master in a different computer .	St
1.3.5	I guess I will just have to try it to see if it works .	St
1.3.6	BTW can some one recommend an alternative to ghost .	St
1.3.7	It does not seem get high marks by all .	St
1.3.8	I will post my findings If anyone is interest .	St
