What is a Simm???????
I am upgrading this Gateway 2000 computer and it says it has 128 MB of memory.
They are tiny memory chips, and all the slots are filled.
The cover panel of the case has a giant sticker that has instructions on it, and it says that the memory chips are called Simms.
How rare are these, and does anybody know the maximum amount of Ram this machine can hold?
