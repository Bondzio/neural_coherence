hello.
this is my first post here.
i currantly have a 'home-built' computer: asus a7nxe-deluxe amd athlon 2500+ radeon 9200 dsl (sbc's modem) i run ubuntu linux 6.06 on it and use all of ubuntu's onboard programs as defaults - openoffice, gnome, firefox, etc.
i am getting a second 'home-built' computer: asus a8n-vm amd athlon 64 3800 3d fuzion geforce 7600gs i will load ubuntu linux 64 6.06 on it and this computer will be used by my children for schoolwork, supposedly.
anyway, i'm going to have the 64 bit unit on a wheeled cart for sharing purposes between children.
i have never used a lan or a router, so here is what i need guidance with.... do i need to establish a lan for both computers to work off of the router?
if so, can i use the 32 bit computer as the 'master' and the 64 bit as the 'slave'?
do i need to purchase anything else other than the router?
this info and any other pertinent info would be greatly appreciated.
thanks gary
