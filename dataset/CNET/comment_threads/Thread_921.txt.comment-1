hi guys, well on my old soyo moard and my 600 mhz slot 1 cpu, windows 98SE, NEW seagate 30 gbyte hard drive, I just installed a old copy of avid cinema, and the program demanded that I set the hard drive to DMA mode.
So I went into device manager/ hard drive/ properties, etc., and there is no listing or option of anything re: DMA mode.
does this mean it's automatically enabled and I don't need to worry about it?
I did not install any outside software or drivers on the hard drive.
THANKS fj
