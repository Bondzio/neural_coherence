I'd get the single stick of 1G RAM because the difference in speed will be smaller than the difference in expense.
By that I'm referring to the expense of losing two 512s to the stockpile or a reseller.
If you upgrade as you say you might later, that is.
If money is no object then get two 1G sticks.
Also, it's nice to be able to squeeze the last bit of speed out of a computer when it's older and the components cost less.
Just my 2 cents--your universe may vary.
