<s> I was naive in thinking my new computer would come with a firewire port - it didn't. </s>
<s> I also was unaware that even with a firewire port, I would need digital video, not analog. </s>
<s> SO, my question is, without replacing what I consider to be a very good graphics card, are there any good dedicated video capture cards out there that can stream analog video from a VCR or Analog video camera to my computer? </s>
<s> I need the best quality I can get on a budget (less than $100 preferred), because I already spent a load on the system I bought! </s>
<s> I look at ratings on Amazon and epinions, but most budget cards don't seem to rate that high. </s>
<s> I would like to preserve my home videos in the best quality I can afford. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> TIA! </s>

<s> Take a look at this one. </s>
<s> They offer more advanced models, but this one gives a lot of bang for just a few bucks. </s>
<s> It's available all over the U.S. at Office Max, Circuit City, Fry's, and many other stores, from $50.00 to $60.00. </s>

<s> I was checking out Ernies suggestion but wasn't able to find anything about capturing streaming ANALOG video for conversion to DIGITAL. </s>
<s> This is why I suggested the other device. </s>
<s> I can't tell if that card has RCA in ports, which is what my camera had coming out of it. </s>
<s> I don't have any other cable ports from my camera so I had to use the RCA to USB that VIDEOH offers. </s>
<s> After saying all of this, I may be incorrect about Ernies idea. </s>
<s> It may be just what you need. </s>
