1.1.1	My brother decided to build a computer on his own, and I gave him some recommendations on parts.	St
1.1.2	What I didn't realize was that a passively cooled Gigabyte 6600GT wouldn't fit in a Chenming mATX case with an MSI RS480M2 motherboard.	St
1.1.3	So, instead of getting another card, he bought a Zalman VF700 and replaced the passive heatsink.	St
1.1.4	He insists that it worked before with the new video card (enough for him to install the new graphics card drivers in WinXP), but now on boot up it just comes out with a bunch of garbled stuff.	St
1.1.5	The MSI splash screen has 7-8 columns of short horizontal lines, and the text in the BIOS is unreadable.	St
1.1.6	I can only tell where the lines of text are on the screen.	St
1.1.7	I tried with a different monitor with the DVI connection instead of VGA but got the same result.	St
1.1.8	The onboard graphics works fine, so its not the motherboard.	St
1.1.9	Does anybody have an idea what the problem is?	Ques
1.1.10	I don't think it is the powersupply or output connections.	St
1.1.11	Its either the card, driver issues, or the PCIe slot.	St
1.1.12	I'll try to isolate it this afternoon, but I'm really worried and would like some advice.	St
1.2.1	along the line the graphics card cooked.	St
1.2.2	Buy a new one.	St
1.2.3	Sorry.	St
1.2.4	and life goes on... Jack	St
