Ok I'm getting somewhere now.
It seems that Powercom makes these UPSs.
Could be one of those cases where they produce a bunch of them and then relabeled them for some reason (maybe quality or age).
The whole thing is crazy.
It came in a Philips box, was labeled Power Sentry, but was manufactured by Powercom.
