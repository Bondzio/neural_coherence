I have a Microsoft mouse, and it does not scroll properly in itunes... its definitely not an hardware issue as i can scroll in any problem in all other applications eg.
Firefox, Safari... Its a Microsoft Wireless Notebook Laser Mouse 6000.
Checked with a friend and his microsoft mouse also behaves this way
