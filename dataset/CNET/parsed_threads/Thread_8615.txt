<s> Just noticed something that has been happening lately. </s>
<s> First off in my 1st rig using a Gigabyte Nvidia 670 4gb version, 2nd rig using Nvidia 560ti. </s>
<s> In all games, I primarily use 1st rig for gaming, I'm getting a screen tear like a horizontal line one third of the way down my monitor. </s>
<s> It's not actually tearing it seems the upper third of the screen is slightly behind being drawn than the rest of the screen. </s>
<s> I enable vsync in all my games not point having the card pump out 200+ frames. </s>
<s> Strnagely when I turn OFF vsync the tearing goes away but obviously my gpu gets hotter and fans speed up. </s>
<s> I don't get it, vsync is supposed to eliminate tearing not cause it. </s>
<s> Advice please? </s>
<s> That the vsync in the Nvidia control panel can be ignored of overridden by game settings. </s>
<s> And with games having bugs you're never sure that setting it to on will cure it. </s>
<s> So start with the Nvidia controls then for each game look around for more settings in the game. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Vsync is set to &quot;Use 3D Application Settings&quot; in Nvidia's control panel. </s>
<s> Change it, retest and if broke, make it a warranty issue. </s>
<s> Forcing triple buffering in the control panel seems to have stopped it for 1 game anyway. </s>
<s> Need to try others. </s>
