Never had a problem with printing from computer until today. A window appears stating that the printer can not communicate with the computer...ALL OF A SUDDEN!!!!! last printed from a file 2 days ago now this. Contacted Lexmark for 1 1/2 hours today and they could not fix. Told me my printer was not compatible with Windows 7. Why all of a sudden? What can I do??? Can not afford a new printer. Please be specific!!!...thanks.
