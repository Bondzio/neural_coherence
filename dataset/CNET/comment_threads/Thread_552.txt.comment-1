I installed a wireless printserver with my epson printer which connects through my wireless router.
The print server has to be connected via the wireless router and the 10/100 connection.
The PC, Wireless Router and printer are all located upstairs in my office.
This works fine.
I can print from my wireless laptop downstairs to my printer upstairs.
My question is - Can I connect another stand alone wireless printserver to my printer downstairs without connecting via the 10/100(which is upstairs)to access a wireless printer downstairs.
Another words a Stand alone Printer Server(802.11g) that will work with the downstairs printer?????
