the file that you saved to your desktop needs to be opened with your linksys configruration tool.
from the host computer(the one that the router is attached)open the linksys tool.
enter this into your web browser address bar.
hit enter this will open a screen that asks for your password in the second box enter admin(your default password) hit enter your linkysys configuration window should now be open.
you will see several tabs.
click on administration.
you will see new tabs under that one will say firmware update.
click on that tab.
a new window will open.
now it needs to know where the file is that you downloaded.
click browse.
browse to the desktop file that has the update file.
open it.
you should see a little progress bar that shows the download progress.
wait for it to complete.
you have now updated your firmware.
this is the only way you can update the firmware for your router.
if you can you may want to print this out.
good luck btw, did you check your ethernet controller for full duplex option from my earlier post.
all of these options can only be done from the host computer(where the router is hooked up)
