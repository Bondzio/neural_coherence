hi bob, i think i understand what samibytn is trying to accomplish.
hot spot sheild is a vpn client used to secure your internet traffic.
what he would like to have happen is for the hotspot sheild vpn client to connect automatically upon system startup.
i would assume that he/she already has an active internet connection and would just like to establish a connection to the vpn.
samibytn let me know if this is what you meant as i am also seeking a solution to this issue.
regards
