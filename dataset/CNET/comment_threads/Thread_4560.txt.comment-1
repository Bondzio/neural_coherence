Hello all.
I am new to the site and researching the netbook vs notebook issue.
I am leaving my current job in which I was supplied a Dell notebook that I used for personal use at home as well.
I have gone back to school as well so I will will need a new laptop.
I will need it for internet, email, word processing, spreadsheets, & itunes(3 ipod nanos and roughly 1000 songs).
Will a netbook satisfy those needs?
Also, what sort of memory and battery life should I be looking for?
I appreciate all the help.
