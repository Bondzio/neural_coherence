Hey, I am trying to connect a front panel (I'm not sure what type but it has 2 USB's, a mic, and a headphone jack.
The 2 USB ports seem to worl already but the headphone and mic have never worked.
I've recently discovered the retailer I bought it from didnt install it.
I went to attach the wires to the motherboard and when I opened up the computer I saw there were 2 blue caps or something blocking the motherboard connections.
They spanned 2 connections between BLINE_OUT_L and LINE out_L BLINE_OUT_R and LINE out_R Does anyone know what these are for and if I can remove them?
ASUS tech support isn't open right now and I'm anxious to do this.
Thanks
