<s> I just bought a Dell Poweredge 400 SC and it has a reportedly good 250 Watt Power supply. </s>
<s> However I intend to use a bit more stuff in it (Nvidia AGP, Sound Blaster card, Combo CD/DVD/RW) and was wondering if anyone was aware of a 3rd party replacement that fits the slightly non standard form factor Dell uses. </s>
<s> Dell's has the power plug and a 110/220 slider directly below it, but no on/off switch. </s>
<s> The mounting holes seem to match a standard ATX supply. </s>
<s> Looking from the back, the fans on the right and the power cord connector is upper left. </s>
<s> Any thoughts, thanks, John </s>
<s> Hello jconner, Is your Dell still under warranty, if so you might have to get a replacement PS from Dell to keep your warranty in effect. </s>
<s> If you decide to replace your Dell PS, I think PC Power and Cooling makes Dell replacement power supplies. </s>
<s> Their stuff is excellent I have used it before with excellent results. </s>
<s> I have total faith in that company and no I do not work for them. </s>
<s> They are in Calif. and I am near Cleveland, Ohio. </s>
<s> Their power supplies are also very quiet. </s>
<s> Remember to consider getting a larger PS than the one you are replacing, for future expansion. </s>
<s> My Dell Dimension 8100 has a 330watt PS. </s>
<s> I prefer not to go lower than that size PS. </s>

<s> Antec has power suupply that does not use fans and they have a 3 year warranty. </s>
<s> I would buy the biggest power supply for the upgrade. </s>
<s> No,I do not work for them. </s>
<s> Make SURE that it is a Dell compatable PS. </s>
<s> Dell uses an ATX connector but the wires may not be connected the same way they are on a standard ATX PS. </s>
<s> If you put a standard ATX PS in a Dell that uses the &quot;Dell&quot; wireing the MB and the new PS will fry. </s>
