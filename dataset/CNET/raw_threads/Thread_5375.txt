What is your motherboard model? Download and run CPU-Z (cpuid.com) if you need help in determining motherboard (system board) manufacturer and model number. You want a PCI Express X16 slot for a video card. AGP slot is next best. PCI is better than no video card. NOTE: &quot;PCI Express X16&quot; is not the same as &quot;PCI&quot;

From what the MSI website says, there is a PCI Express X16 slot available for a video card. Here is the MS-7145-020 motherboard: http://www.msicomputer.com/product/p_spec.asp?model=RS480M-IL Open your case to confirm that you have that long white expansion slot as indicated in the picture. That's where the PCI Express X16 video may be inserted. NOTE: If you get a powerful video card, you will need to have a good power supply unit (PSU).
