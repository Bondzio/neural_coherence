Would it b possible to ghost the contents of a smaller drive onto a bigger drive, will it mess up because of partitions or what. I need to know if this will work ASAP. Thanks.

YOu can slso ghost to partitions once to point them out and agin, the partition size should be equal or larger than the source. Using the simplst defaults, ghosting once the HDs/partitions are ready just point out out source and destination and let it fly. I hope this helps... good luck -----Willy
