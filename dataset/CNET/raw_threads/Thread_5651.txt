It's up to you to find out what's wrong. Possibilities include: - bad motherboard, CPU, memory, video card, monitor or cables - wrong or bad connections The least that should happen is the BIOS showing itself on the monitor, indeed. Hope you find it. Kees

That all cabling and cards, modules are fully seated and retry again. If no recovery, remove all devices and see what the results are. If still no display, disassemble system to bare, place on cardboard and using only PSU and mtrbd. what are the results after powering-ON? Any beeps moans or complaints? Repost after results. tada -----Willy
