I haven't had any problems with Dell but I purchased 7 years ago. If Dell is so bad why do they continuously sell so many pcs? What brands are better?

5218	3	112547	1278895	1278670	Willy	7/4/05 12:45 AM	1.1204379E12	Well...	In the years you've had your Dell system, Dell support has truly &quot;nose dived&quot;. Alot has changed even though they still sell alot of systems, the sheer numbers they generate in sales will in no thought cause some problems, however, I can truly say, Dell really needs to improve thier support model. Plus, more than ever they're selling to the &quot;home user&quot; even though they did in the past, it seems far too many users become unhappy at the slightest cause and DelL's support doesn't improve the situation. I know they're happy users out there, but I hear the squeaky wheel more now than ever, IMHO. If you want to look at a decent system and for cost its hard to beat, look at eMachines offering. You can pick-up any decent magazine and check what's for sale as well. tada -----Willy

I've graduated to home built and have either canabalized the Compaqs or given them to kids. I'd buy another Compaq in a heartbeat.

The percentage is not what we can measure so any make takes a hit as they become more popular. I do consulting and we just get Dells. It's boring easy and the machines just work. -&gt; What's different here is that the customers understand that software support is one thing and hardware support is another. Guess where you get bad support? Software problems. With all the spyware, rootkits, virus, trojan and just bad luck, software issues are where the problems are and what people scream about the most. We get a variety of name brand machines and they all just work. This makes it very hard to pan anyone (save Sony.) Bob

The Compaq Desktops we've had have been rock-solid and reliable right down to the wire. My dad's 7 year old Presario (powered by the ancient AMD K6-2) recently gave out and he'll be taking my Presario over (which is newer and powered by an 800MHz Celeron). However, HP is also a viable brand. I've been using an HP Pavillion notebook for the past 2 years and found it to be just as rock-solid and reliable, a real workhorse. However, I now have the need to move over to a desktop and I'm pretty much sold on an HP machine. For power and value, nothing can beat HP, except possibly eMachines.

The things I don't like about Dell are thier own MB and PSU designs. Dell wanted to be the biggest so low prices to get the sales and reduced service to keep up the profits. HP is a good alternitve to Dell as is Emachines. This one of the reasons that so many of us build our own PCs. John

They have upgraded their construction considerably the last few years (because their reputation was so bad). They discovered it was actually more cost efficient to build their computers better (not saying &quot;most expensive parts&quot; but actual eye to detail of construction here). Since doing so, their return rate has been among the lowest in the industry. And, they just work. You will NOT get a top-notch graphics card for gaming or more-than-enough memory. You WILL get a computer you can run right out of the box with a high degree of reliability. Emachines will meet the needs of the daily average user. They are not super machines meant for doing heavy-duty graphics and CAM work and are inappropriate for 3-D gaming. But, if you are like most of us, and need your computer for word processing, record keeping and the ilk, I can recommend Emachines as a fine &quot;bang for the buck&quot; computer. (FYI, I've owned PCs since 1988 and did tech support for software companies for a number of years- often dealt with hardware issues as well. I've owned HPs, NECs and some other &quot;house brand PCs, but the most reliable machine I've had has been my current Emachine, which has run fine 16 hours a day every day for over 2 years now-- not one minute of downtime.)

The question of which system is best AMD vs Intel has been going on since AMD came about some years ago. It seems to vary every year, right now the prices of AMD's dual core processors are higher than Intel, and here it was the opposite before then. Course' you can tell the young gammers and some 'value' buyers have AMD and try to constantly belittle Intel. A few did attempt to answer your question of &quot;What brands are better?&quot; (than Dell). Naturally a home built with your good knowledge of quality components is better, or being able to pick out those quality components and then having someone like Monarch build it for you. What factory brands are better? None IMO, as every computer can come with defects/flaws and they all seem about the same percentage wise in relation to the amount they produce. Course' Dell is the largest producer of desktops and will get their higher percentage of complaints. The offshore dealings with support personnel is perhaps the current biggest complaint with Dell, but that would not personally deter me from buying a Dell. I understand HP has some of their support off shore.

It is now July 2005 my problems began in April 2005 so we are taking about a period of 4 months!!! Problem 1: Computer will not turn on (it is less than 2 months old). They say owe well well send you a box pack it up and ship it to us. So I did. They send it back, claiming that they tested it, and I get a computer back that is missing the memory card (therefore, it will not boot at all). So I call and of course they cant just send me my memory chip they have to have me send the computer back to them again. So I do. And they send it back (supposedly testing it first) and I again get a non-working computer. So I send it back again, and they send it back again, and you guessed it, it still doesnt work. So then I get to talk to the Sr. Quality Manager, HP Executive Customer Relations Management who guarantees me that I will get a working computer. So again I send it and finally they send me a working computer. But now they had the computer as long as I did. So I continue to use the products as I have already paid for them and one of the other computers dies.it has a CPU fan that failed and will not boot up because of it. So I calland again I am told that they cant send me the part (even though I told them I could easily install a CPU fan myself). So I wait for the box, send the computer back.AND GET THE WRONG COMPUTER BACK!!!!! Then when I call I am told they have no idea where my computer is but they will have someone call me back. When they never called back I called them. They then claim my computer was at their service center the entire time (BULL) and that they havent fixed it yet (BULL) and that I need to send the computer I got back before they can send mine to me. Then the Service Manager tells me he cant guarantee my computer is coming back to meWHAT THE F***!!!! He refused to give me anything in writing stating I will even get any computer at all back!!!! Since I am doing the right thing and sending the wrong computer back I guess I can only hope and pray that I get something in returnBUT NO GUARENTEE AS THE SERVICE MANAGER told me THERE IS NO GUARENTEES IN LIFE!!!

I find that the live chat is the worst, but i had some install issues with a 4070 scanner that were worked out very eell by an advanced level support tech. Even SBC DSL support has gone to India in the past couple of months. I believe that if a company keeps domestic tech support these days they are soon going to have to keep their prices too high to remain competetive.

Hello, In reading these replies I can see that people are basing most of their answers on the name, rather than the quality of the system. I have a very successful 'small chain' of computer stores in northern Michigan. I see systems daily, I see customers daily, and I hear all the horror stories daily. Read below for my recommendation: Let's start out with the parts game. When you buy a BIG BOX system you have NO IDEA where the parts came from. A RFB (request for bids) is issued many times a month by these companies for such things as motherboards, hard drives, etc. The WINNER of these RFB's are the lowest priced supplier willing to build a part to the BIG BOX's specs. Throw all these &quot;lowest bidders&quot; in a box to make a reliable PC? Hmmm...and who made your motherboard anyway? Now, quality. Yea, most people are more than happy with their Dell, HP, eMachine, etc. while it runs. It's got a 1 year warranty, and unless you invested a fortune for an extended warranty with on-site repair, you need to box it up and send it back (a 2 week or more excurision for your system) just to get it fixed. The systems arent put together all that well, it's an assembly line. At the end of the line the QC folks (Quality Control) turn them on, and if they power up and burn in for a bit, they're OK to go. That loose cable or badly bolted in motherboard issue won't show up until the folks in shipping drop the system while loading it on the truck anyway. License? What License? When you but the BIG BOX system your Windows License (XP HOME or PRO) is tied to the BIOS chip identification number for your system. If, let's say, 2 years down the road you have a thunderstorm and the motherboard is destroyed, you can send it to the manufacturer, and for a fee larger than what you paid for the system in the first place, they will replace the motherboard. Or, you take it to the local computer shop, where your bill should be about $100.00 to replace the motherboard. The issue is, you need to buy a new Windows license, yours won't work anymore since the BIOS chip isn't the same (the BIOS is on the Motherboard). There are a hundred more problems with the BIG BOX's that I can point out, but that'll just bore the pants off everyone. So let me make my suggestion here. Build your own, and if you can't or don't know how, go to the local computer shop. Let them build you a system that works for you. It'll be customized to do what you want to do (just surf the net, play games, store mass quantities of music, etc.). The warranties on these systems are usually manufacturers warranties, that's the way I do it. CPU's and Motherboards are warranted for 5 years! Other parts are usually 3 years, and the memory is or can be lifetime warranty. License? Windows XP HOME, PRO, whatever you want. It will be OEM, which means, if the motherboard breaks you can replace it, not having to purchase another license, and Windows will continue to work (with a little massaging for the motherboard drivers if it's a different type). Quality? The quality of the systems built locally is MUCH higher than the BIG BOX, sure you pay a bit more, but it'll last. I use name brand parts, no cheapies or refurbs. I burn my systems in for 24 hours or more. I make sure when that system leaves that the customer will not be back for a warranty issue. I lose money when that happens (in labor, since I GIVE them that when something breaks). BUT if your local built system does break, you have a desk to pound on, a place to visit, someone to yell at if need be. I won't send you to India or some other offshore location for answers. Folks, I can go into specifics about each brand mentioned here as a 'must buy' or 'don't but' system, but that would take more time than I or you are willing to invest. Custom built with NAME BRAND products is the way to go! IF you must go BIG BOX, go to your local computer shop, ask them what they see in repairs, and make an informed decision. My repair breakdown is this (in % of business): Dell : 80% eMachines : 15% HP/Compaq: 5% Most of the Dell and eMachines I see are for blown motherboards, eMachines usually have a hole blasted through the BIOS chip. Most are under 2 years old, and all of them were quoted by the manufacturer for repair at $300.00 plus shipping or more! I fix them for $100.00 in parts and labor, and another $99.99 for the Windows license (OEM). My .02.

The worst problem was Tech Support - they were very hard to reach by phone and treated our desktop support team like a single user who purchased a single PC. After many attempts to get better support, efforts were abandoned and so were Gateway PC's. Dell was the new kid on the block and everything got very simple for our team. The Dell PC's worked and tech support, when needed, had the right attitude and skills to provide the assistance we expected and needed. I suppose tech support is in the eyes of the beholder because I see both sides of this discussion very often with Gateway. Gotta' be a reason for THAT, too.... jpark

If you need help, the first thing that will be asked is the brand and model. If you say &quot;home built&quot;, the answer will be that they don't know. Similarly, if you have to take the machine in for repair, the tech will have no &quot;brand experience&quot; to draw on. He will also have more problems with components that aren't as compatable as they should be.

I noticed that Dell ships these with only 256MB of memory, which is insufficient for Windows XP, IMO. Try adding at least annother 256MB (or more) to the open memory slot. You WILL see a difference!

In that time, the only problem I had was the CD-RW went out on me. I called them and had the new one in 2 days, I pulled out the old one and packed it up to send back while the DHL driver waited, it took about 5 min. and had the new one in and the machine back up and running in less than half an hour. I recently added a second hard drive and had a question about a conflict between the instructions that came with the drive and what the manual said. My machine has been out of warranty for some time so I used the email tech support. They got back to me within 30 min. and I got the thing back up and running in less than an hour with no problems since. I'm probably a little more self sufficient than most home users but I've had none of the horror stories I've heard about with other manufacturers and I'll probably get another eMachines PC when this one wears out. This one has sure had plenty of bang for the buck.

The sound of a first boot up and knowing it works, ahhh such a sound. I LOVE IT ! But here's some of the good and bad points about building your own PC briefly: That being said home building a computer is not for a novice. It is for poeple, like me, who can solve their own PC problems without help of tech support from a PC maker like HP, Dell, and etc. Who ask when call foolish questions like: Is it plugged in?(By the way computer hardware makers have their own support if needed.)They also can ask foolish questions too. Also, some computer hardware comes with a better warranty than 1 yr computer warranties. Lifetime, 5yrs, 3yrs, and 1yr are normal PC hardware warranties. This depends on the hardware and if the PC hardware has moving parts like a electric motor. Hard drives, cd-roms, and fans are 1 yr warranties usually. Memory can be lifetime...Hmmm another good reason to build my own. Upgrading a home built is much easier than a Dell, HP, or Gateway. These companies are getting better at allowing for upgrades, but still a somewhat difficult to upgrade. Also, upgrading a Dell, HP, and etc can void a warranty. Home builders don't really have this problem except for ESD, which is a fancy abbreviation for static electricity discharge. This can void a hardware warranty. There are other reasons to be your own, but I'd have to write a book on it. Still I like the sticker on that says Asus and AMD Athlon, not HP! I still love that first beep when I power on and it all works.

I have worked on all the name brands and on generic machines assembled by the local shop out of off the shelf parts. There is no advantage to brand names that I have ever found and some noticeable disadvantages. 1. They are usually harder to work on. E.G. Some HPs are a nightmare - you have to practically disassemble the thing just to put in a memory chip. 2. Their components are usually no better quality than those used in generic machines and sometimes worse. (The only exception I have found are the old IBMs- they did use good compenents.) 3. They sometimes use proprietary pieces that you may have to wait days or weeks to get the part. 4. They tend to have less compatibility/ mor problems with with addons (memory chips, VGA cards, etc.) 5. In my experience generic machines do not give more problems than brand names -- about the same. 6. You will pay $100's of dollars more than you will for a comparable generic / assembled machine - with IMHO-- no better performance or durability or problem avoidance. My recomendation is consider computers a commodity. When I need a new compu, I go down to my local economy compu shop and see what they have on special, have them modify/add to it to my specifications. I usually buy 1 down from the top of the line at the time. (In other words, I dont get the absolute faster CPU available, but 1 generation down, which saves $100's. E.g. if 2.8 Gmhz is the top, I will get a 2.4 that was the previous top 3 to 6 months ago You dont need to to pay more than $500-$600 for such a machine now, including LCD. Furthermore, the warranty is with them with and available in person, face to face, fast service. And if I need a part or addon component, they have it off their shelves. I would be glad to hear from some others techs out there on their experience with brand versus generic compus.

By far in my area we service about 90% HP/Compaq on the warranties. Of course we do have a Sam's Club and that is what they sell so it only makes sense. As far as getting a name brand PC I can only offer advice as to what my company has experianced. If you buy the consumer desktop system you generally are getting parts from the lowest bidder and do not receive the best technical support. I recommend to anyone that you purchase a workstation if you can afford it when dealing with so called &quot;Big Box&quot; systems. As far as working on systems the workstations and servers from Dell are by far the easiest systems I have ever opened. Ability to upgrade the workstations and servers is good. The lowest priced Dell workstationf or example has PCI express slots as does their lowest price (entry level) server. What it really boils down to is: You get what you pay for. If you pay 299 for a computer expect it to break in a couple months. If you pay 1000+ you generally have better luck. My dell workstations have Intel MBs and Intel processors, with name brand RAM, custom BIOS's from Dell etc. To the gentleman that said the OS is tied to the BIOS that is garbage. MS is the one that controls the licensing. It is tied to the Motherboard period on OEM installs. Whether or not you install it or Dell. The customer can not legally change motherboards to a different model/manufacturer without violating their licence. Well, that is my two cents. Good luck.

The big league players offer something individuals can't, that being support, special offers and lower package price. The down side to package deals is mostly internal and to 75% of the population un-noticable. Things like sound and\or video built into main board. Granted in most cases they surfice for most all areas unless you are an avid gamer or audiophile. As well, the Big boys give you soft ware bundles. Again the down side, if it goes wrong you relay on their support and\or repair procedures. As for upgrading their systems, check them out, sometimes you can, mostly only memory, hard drive and maybe even an AGP video slot, keeping in mind, if you do it your self it voids warrenty. Speaking from experience with HP, nice little system, tech support great, but when modem went out, off shelf replacement took work to communicate with main board, then same when sound chip went south. Long story short, when things went\go wrong the included sys disk and Win95 kept loading things that no longer existed or worked, and main board replacement was $450, half the purchase price to start with. To the point, Compac was the only maker that reguired special hardware, slides, rails in their cases to make things fit or work, some connectores as well were brand specific. For Dell, Gateway, Alienware, Emachines, HP, and others, they all work very well for the most part. It comes down to packageing, what do you want, what are you going to use it for, will your usage planes change and can the machine change with you. Make a list of wants, must haves then check them for what they offer within what your willing to spend.

But I found a local computer shop where the guy has been working on computers since the 80's. He has now built 3 computers for me - 2 for office, 1 for home. I will never, never, never go back to off the shelf big box computers. I have speed, reliability, pick-up-the-phone-instant-support help. And have even had &quot;at home&quot; service that was really a software problem, not a hardware problem.... Plus, comparing prices for what I have now? There is no comparison.

Apple always comes out as the most trouble free. Apple also has the highest rated support. I own Dells, an HP and a Mac. The HP is always on the blink. The Dell laptop has been repaired numerous times under warranty. Now the warranty is over and we will discard it once it stops working again. The Mac has given me very little trouble. If I have a problem with the Mac, I can call one number to address hardware and software problems. No one points the finger at another vendor! The techs are native American English speakers, too. If you want a trouble free computing experience, the objective evidence supports Apple.

(See profile) Nothing like this is available from a mass producer and I don't think they could have built it at the price I paid. I know that he could build a low-end system cheaper than Dell, HP, etc. because I had him build one for my daughter. There has been a lot of talk about support in this forum, and this has got to be the greatest benefit of dealing with someone locally. My guy is only a phone call or email away and bends over backwards to help, and I've taken some really tricky problems to him. Plus, the money you spend in your community stays in the community (at least the labour component). The only brand name computer I would buy now would be a notebook, which I'm considering at the moment, and I wouldn't consider anything other than ASUS for value for money (and coolness).

Raved about them to family and they bought two more. I've been on all four of them and I have to say that they are easier to use and set up then any other computer I have set up for other people. Solid, dependable, low maintennance. If you need to upgrade, just buy what you need from hp. That wont void warranties, will it? The three E-Machines I set up are all short time computers, life span of about 2 1/2 years. The dells have been replaced also, newer dells. If you want to keep your computer a long time, HP is the only way to go!!!
5218	43	112547	1330566	1278670	ackmondual	7/30/05 2:05 AM	1.1226891E12	I have used 3 Dells.	first a Pentium 133, 16MB of RAM, Win95 from early '99. When my dad's branch office shut down, this was his &quot;consolation prize&quot; My first new dell was in late '99. P3 550HMz, 128MB RAM, 16MB Voodoo3 3000 win98 SE 3rd current Dell is P4 3GHz, 0.5GB RAM, ATI 128MB Radeon 9800 Pro, winXP SP2 almost 2 years ago My comments on dell are as follows: 1st system came with no support, since it was one of the office PCs 2nd system. Tech Support RULED!!! I had quite a few problems with this PC, but id' say hafl were my fault and the other half being win98 not stable enough. They were &quot;american&quot;, courteous, and go the extra mile to assist you. I even had an engaging conversation about the NHL and hockey even tho i don't give a rat's ass about hockey! And now.... -u get lucky and get an pure english speaker, but mostly indian tech supp reps. Nothing against Indians, but the accent was hard to understand most of the time. Many of them also seemed to have a subpar understanding and knowledge techinical expertise (altho this also applied to the &quot;white folk&quot; as well) -Dell continues to use proprietary motherboards and cases. U can upgrade RAM, HD, optical drives, and even vid cards to a certain extent easily, but upgrading to a new mobo to support higher processors, and modding your case to support higher PSU is difficult at best, if even possible -Like other prebuilts, they overcharge for alot of components (x2 as much for RAM vs Crucial.com and Newegg for example), and while their low end PCs are a nice deal, it's cheaper to make your own high end/gaming PCs -they use refurbished, so-so parts, even for new PCs. So why do *I* still buy from Dell? -I'm lazy. Once I get settled in a more permanent job, I'll buy my own cheap components and put together my own PC for the fun and experience of it. For now, Im content having something that just works and being ablt to complain to some1 if i have a problem (winXP and the hardware have been good to me so far tho, barring an incident of clean install from too mcuh spy/adware) -I get them cheap.... I always tell ppl to buy Dell cheap. Look for current promos AND online coupons to save up to 40% off or $500 off. -Self built PCs are great for ppl who upgrade major parts (processor, PSU, vid card) often. My upgrade cycle will be moreso every 3 to 6 years. -Like watching a bad movie u know is bad, I know what to expect of Dell, the good, bad, and ugly MY CONCLUSIONS..... is dell terrible? Not quite. They're not as good as they used to be, but for ppl who aren't too technical, don['t have time to build their own PC&lt; or need tech support, go for it. For gamers and other advanced PC users, u can certainly do better.

Here is the link: http://www.monarchcomputer.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv I am a computer newbie just getting into digital video editing. To run the DV software without worry, I needed a reliable, strong computer with highly rated motherboard, 2 hard drives, large RAM, fast CPU, good video card, DVD burner, and more. I spent months researching. All of my research pointed to Monarch. They offered the best price and quality, as well as customer service and satisfaction. I had never bought anything on line before my Monarch computer. I took a deep breath and waited. It has worked like a charm. I have called tech support with a couple of questions and get a live, English-speaking, person on the phone, eager to help. There is also a great Monarch forum to post questions. Before you buy anything, go to resellers.com and run a search of the customer service rating of the company you are considering. Here again, nothing beats Monarch in terms of customer service. I also have a Dell in the house. The problems? 1. If you need a replacement part, you have to buy it from Dell. Sometimes Dell cannot even tell you what is inside your computer. I had a friend who could not double his RAM because Dell no longer had the type of RAM and could not tell him what type of RAM they had used in his computer. What if Dell discontinues the part. You might have to replace your computer. 2. Customer service is a nightmare. Period. 3. Dell installs all kinds of junk onto your computer. You get the new computer and immediately have to sit down and start uninstalling. But, then you need to get a registry cleaner because you cannot get the program out of your computer. And, it's brand new!

For a small fee, they will put it all together for you AND test it ahead of time prior to shipment........that gives you the option then of shopping around for the case, video card, floppy drive, harddrive, dvd-rw, sound card, modem, etc. for the brands that you want perhaps on sale elsewhere and put those pieces in yourself. It's a great way to start on learning from the 'ground up' about building your own without worrying about messing up an expensive motherboard and cpu until you are ready to take that next step later on.

I have bought locally for since 1994 and it's the only way I will buy. I can actually talk to a real person face to face. In that time I failed a CD drive (warranty) and one power supply which I had to buy. It is well worth being able to explain what I have and what I want to do. My local record seems to beat my office record for fewer repairs.

In the coming months I will be getting an Imac for my main home machine and my wife wants an Ibook. OSX is simply a superior OS that makes doing everything simpler. The hours I spend on XP maintenance are gone with OSX. Apple hardware is well built, well designed, and face it, far more stylish. Everyone like to say that MACs are more expensive but I have not found that to be true. Apple does not make a 299 PC but who really wants what you get with a 299 PC? When pricing PC's with similar features MAC is totally competitive. Do yourself a favor and head down to the Apple store and check out MAC.

I had nothing but trouble with the Gateway computer I used for 4 years. There were problems with the Gateway right from the start. I would suggest getting a Hewlett-Packard. My brother and I both have HPs and we have been pleased with them. The only complaint is that they are a little noisy. I also like IBM a great deal but they are no longer in the computer business. I found the IBM computers I used over the years to be extremely reliable. I like Apple too. I feel Apple makes really good computers that are easy to use.

Make sure to do the scanner twice though, because once in a while, it tells you the wrong details. If the scanner doesn't work, then he can look it up if he knows the manufacturer, the product line, and the model. It works for some printers. However, the scanner won't work some of the time on homemade computers.

Call HP for support and the tech rep from New Delhi will suggest you either reformat your hard drive or pay $150 for a year of ''upgraded'' support, where they probably tell you to reformat your hard drive. Their consumer machines can have stupid design choices, too, like they'll bundle a fast Intel CPU with a big SATA drive, dual DVD reader/burners and multimedia software, then they don't bother to include an AGP slot for a decent video card and the onboard video can't be disabled, or having only two RAM slots on the motherboard so you have to throw out the original RAM if you need more memory...I'm about to return mine and get a custom-configured Dell.

I priced a ton of notebooks and found that Apple was very competitive on price, feature for feature, and outperformed most of the PCs. And this was a Master of Science program, not Fine Arts. Using Virtual PC the Apple outperformed 3GHz Dell Pentium 4's at the school. There were a few pissed off classmates. And if you run a big database you won't believe Filemaker Pro! A file 100K x 40 took 45 minutes to do a simple sort on Access. In FileMaker it took 15 seconds - no BS. In over 2 years I have spent less than 20 hours troubleshooting this PowerBook. OS X is unbelievable. I had a few minor problems with case clips, and I cracked the bezel over the DVD slot, but that was from [over]use - it's where I rested my hand for the touchpad. But they moved it to the side, so that's no longer a problem. One caveat: No matter what brand you buy make sure you get either the extended warranty or use American Express to pay for it. Borrow somebody's and pay them if you have to. Do both if you can. You're going to have the machine for at least two years, and the regular warranty runs out in 1. AMEX adds one extra year to all warranties, including extended. AMEX paid to get my case repaired.

My 1998 Atlas at 850mhz was in need of an upgrade. I would have bought another Atlas but the co. died in 1995. I considered building from scratch, and had a list of what I wanted in it, but some serious questions, from my geek friends, made me realize I didn`t have the brains to correctly mix, match, and install the components. I ruled out Compact, Dell, Gateway and HP, because they`re ''as is'' PC`s, not upgrade friendly. I`d worked with Apple`s and didn`t care for them either (limited software and hardware choices). Was hearing some good things about E-Machines, but they mostly offered the bottom line, starter machines for newbies. Then I saw an ad for their Media Center Model T6520. It has a lot of nice stuff in it for $600, but a cheap ATI 200 video card. For $200 more, replaced it with with an Asus Extreme AX700 Pro card. Added an external USB2 floppy drive,and put in a 2nd. 160Gb hard drive from my old PC. New rig scored 450 on Norton Performance Test.If you haven`t bought yet, try one on for size, it`s great for $800.

In all the respected comparisons and reviews I read, Dell was rated #1 in two categories: ''Average Home Use'' and ''Power Machine.'' The Dell 4700 was rated ''best buy'' above all other brands & models in ''Average Home Use'' category, due not just to price (higher than several) but due to features and performance. The Dell 8400 was rated #1 and ''best buy'' in the ''Power Machine'' category. I went with the 8400 because I wanted to work with editing a lot of photo files and use several graphics and &quot;publishing&quot; applications. Also, because I knew I'd be limited to ''dial-up'' internet access for the near future because of my location, I wanted a FAST machine with lots of caching, etc. I've been very happy with the performance and reliability of the Dell 8400, and, in general, with Dell, Inc. I find their tech support to be knowledgable and with a caring, helpful attitude. The COMMUNICATION quality, however, suffers due to difficulty understanding accents and ''figures of speech.'' I've not had to contact them because of any failure of the hardware. I've used tech support whenever I've been too impatient to figure something out for myself, and they've patiently walked me through the whole process during the single contact. I STRONGLY recommend using the toll-free phone contact instead of the ''live chat'' on-line, however, because it's much easier and quicker to clarify a question or instruction. The ''live chat tech help'' is too slow and cumbersome -- and very frustrating. Their Customer Service Dept. (different from Tech Support) is also courteous and helpful. The only experience I've had with tech support better than Dell's has been with HP, but for PRINTERS, not computers. HP's printer tech support crew goes ''out of their way'' to be helpful, solve your problem, and to follow up in a day or two to be sure the solution is working, and that your experience with their tech support was satisfatory. DELL could use some tutelage from HP here. Further, my best friend is IT Director of a LARGE national corporation. He HAD 3 HP's at home for himself and his family. In early July, he replaced the laptop and two desktops with DELL, based on both his professional and personal experience with both companies. He is also going with Dell for all new purchase needs for his company, except for the ''big iron'' stuff, and he is not the kind of person to be swayed by ''incentives'' whether simply attractive pricing contracts OR any ''favors.'' I say GO WITH DELL, but REMEMBER, NO computer or major corporation is perfect.

It the software and how fast or efficiently you can run it. Once PCs hit the 2gig under $500 mark then the box becomes disposable. If you read what happening in the industry then you can see the much larger trend is not what software your going to buy for your PC but what software your going to use on your mobile device or TV set. This will lead to a time when the majority people won't even own computers, or at lest won't know it. They will upload their digital pictures to Walmart.com and at the web site will be the tools to do color correction, red eye removal, and even x-boy friend removal. And it will all happen on their TVs using it's remote control. So it doesn't matter what you buy, as long as it will run the software you need any thing will do at this point.

My little Dell 2400 took a POUNDING! Borrowing a neighbor's monitor after the power came back on, I was STUNNED when the Dell booted up flawlessly. I am always astonished whenever I discover real quality in ANY product...but Dell has earned my permanent loyality. I wouldn't even consider another brand.

I don't have have a dell, but on the 2 occasions I've had to call Dell tech support, they were great. Very responsive, short hold times, and curtious. I have a Monarch Computer. Love it!!!!!

In this year, we got complaints from a big customer that our products produced much more noise when compared to Dell machines. The fact that we were given a price target to meet which was at the half price of a Dell was ignored by the customer; which we had to remember them. But the point is, we have got a sample Dell optiplex GX280 machine; and I was impressed by the ineer beauty of the machine. It was a manufacturers dream come true : an amazingly solid case which had just one cooling fan to cool all the components effectively and without noise; a i875 motherboard was installed for a CPU which could run even on a i845 motherboard; a 230W powersupply with an amazing 12V rail, etc etc etc etc... (these etc are very very long) Then last week we have reviewed a Dell Optiplex GX520 machine; I was very impressed again. This unit has also a very small 230W powersupply with 14A on 12V rail. It has a Intel P4 3.2Ghz CPU, onboard graphics etc. This configuration can easily run on a i865 mATX board. What strikes me is the following: the motherboard is based on i945 chipset in BTX form and the case is a BTX case. Just to give an idea what these mean : Currently for a BTX comnpatible case you have to pay $200 and for a i945 motherboard in mATX form more than $100. If you look at internet, everybody says that if you use an i945 chipset motherboard on which your system is based, you need at least 400W powersupply As far as I can see, Dell people are extremely cautious and they are using everything to build robust systems by using extremely powerful electronic basis; and by the way they bring the latest technology implementations to the masses. Furthermore, if you are extremely power hugry, you can buy a Dell XPS syste with 550W powersupply, an amazingly solid case etc. At past, I was an HP fan; however ever since they have merged with Compaq; I never advise to buy computers from them.

I'm on my 3rd mother board, they've replaced the memory at least twice, the modem twice, the hard drive once, and I've put in a more powerful power supply and an additional cooling fan. Their customer service department is shakey at best. I talked to 5 repair people once before I found someone who could tell me that the case had been changed so the serial and model number on the front didn't match the actual computer's serial and model number on the back -- they were going to send me a new correct computer until I finally reached someone that knew what happened. Have several friends that have had no trouble with them but I can't recommend them...from my personal experience. Just got the machine out of the shop, cost me $250 but I basically have a new computer and nothing eMachine but the case.

Like downloading driver's and such. Try doing that on a Hewlett Packard. When I am asked to fix someone's pute, the first thing I ask is: Is it a HP? 80% of the time is &quot;yes&quot;. Gag a Maggot, Thank the Lord, there is windriver's. I suggest build your own. Buy your own OS that way you don't have to deal with all the crap you get with name brand pute's.

These are not the &quot;entry-level&quot; machines but are some rather nice boxes. Problems I have with them are: No room for additional hard drives Only 1 SATA controller for the current hard drive No room for additional CD/DVD drives Only 2 PCI slots Proprietary components like mobo and power supply Limited air flow and ventilation On the good side you can add memory as they give you four slots. (Configured from Dell with 2x512Mb) Also we don't have a huge failure rate with them. Some memory bad and a couple of mobo problems, but that is over several hundred machines. For a business they will meet today's needs and probably be fine for three to four years. Downside, no real upgrade path. Replacement only. &lt;jav&gt;

But I've also owned Gateway, HP and Sony. I'm on my second Sony desktop now (just replaced/upgraded my first Sony VAIO). There's just something about the VAIO series that I like. I've had extremely good luck with Sony, and with most of my TV's being Sony, and audio equipment being Sony, I decided to try Sony computers. I haven't regretted getting them. I had my first VAIO for 4 years before I bought the new one this past January. Really good machines, no complaints from me. I think it boils down to personal preference actually.

There is a new one surfacing in the market that seems like a real winner with a unique cooling system that will insure a long life for the cpu and computer and all components are very high quality - The name is Cisnet . I have started stocking them along with the HP and Compaqs as a more economical offering , without sacrificing quality ,to the customers . But the bottom line is , regardless of brand , get one with the AMD Athlon 64 cpu - Larryk

While I have dealt with worse, it doesn't make it any better. Whenever I have occasion to call I do whatever I can to get away from the tier one people. They will have you do the most ridiculous things that would have nothing to do with the reason for your call. They also tend to give inaccurate information. One time they told a friend that everything she needed was in the box to reinstall her system. Only problem was the driver cd's included were for an Optiplex not a Dimension. When questioned they said everything would be fine. Then when the system was hosed without drivers (they are not on the Optiplex disk when you have a Dimension) they told her to go to the Dell website. How do you do that when you have no NIC driver? So she had to wait four days for them to send out a disk, which again was the Optiplex disk. Finally she asked me for help and I went to the Dell site and downloaded the drivers. Even then the list every driver that has ever been used on that model not just what is installed on your machine. So you may have to try several before you are successful. They should take a look at the way the Gateway site is done. When you pull up your machine by serial number it lists only the drivers that came installed on that system when shipped. Much simpler and elegant. I do have to note that this is not just a Dell problem. The industry as a whole has gone to the dogs as far as customer support. Another supplier I deal with is somewhat worse. While tech support is good they are extremely difficult to get a hold of. There have been occasions where I have waited on hold for over thirty minutes. Then I usually hang up and call back to the sales department. Amazing how they never seem to be overloaded with calls. No hold time at all. Then I just ask them to transfer me to support and I get right through. &lt;jav&gt;

My only beef with sonys computers was the lack of upgradeability.But it seems the newer Sony Vaio's have that issue remedied.I look forward to purchasing another Sony Vaio in the near future.

Especially with a more modern PnP OS. As far as &quot;brand experience&quot;, what does that have to do with anything? That infers that the technicians only use manufacturer tools to troubleshoot. Again, have never had such an experience. Any company that can only fix &quot;X brand&quot; computers I would suggest you avoid. (Macs excepted.) Finally, what compatibility issues with components? Do your research on the components before you build the machine! Know what you are looking at and what works best together. If you don't know ASK! There are thousands of people who have built machines willing to give you advice and assistance. Parts incompatibility is rare, but not zero and can also be a problem when adding to a commercial machine as well. &lt;jav&gt;

My parents have a dell and for the first 6 months it was great than the hard drive went bad, then it was great after a new hard drive, then about 9 months later the new hard drive from Dell almost went bad again, then about a month later it ran slow for a good year until my dad finally did somthing to it to make it run faster, now it is fine but runs slow several times a week. Dells like the one you bought back in 1998 were good but since then Dells have just gone down hill!!!!! I also have an Uncle that has his own business and loves to buy Dells but he says that out of 20 new Dell laptops he bought 5 of there hard drives went bad and some of the cooling fans went bad. I have also herd now you come get a Dell from a good batch of Dells or a Dell from a bad batch of Dells. I just bought and IBM and I love it and people say IBM makes some of the best computers and people also say that about Mac's but personaly I would not go with a Mac in todays world. HP/Compaq are great computers and so are Emachines for a budget computer. Toshiba makes good computers and so does sony and gateway. For gaming go with ALIENWARE computer. You also may think about buliding your own computer which I am going to do for my next Desktop. Their are also some other good computer manufactures out there that I don't know off the top of my head.

The majority of pc manufacturers build solid machines, however I have found that brand name pc's, in most cases, have proprietary hardware (which means if you decide to upgrade, or integrate new hardware it may not always be compatible, or you are locked into purchasing their products only). My suggestion would be to ascertain what you will be using your pc for and contacting a reputable computer store in your area and having your new pc custom built. I think you will find the cost is not much more than a brand name pc. This will allow you more flexibility with upgrading, and with the constantly changing technology with home pc's - it will allow you more options to increase the functionality of your pc when adding new hardware, without disposing (in some cases)of the entire unit.

I must agree that both replies have very valid points. I believe brand name pc's are solid, and there is much truth in, &quot;you get what you pay for.&quot; My vote however, is for a custom built pc. I think that for the novice, he or she should not attempt to home build a computer, it is complicated process and in the end could be very costly. I say, figure out what you need the pc for, find a reputable computer store, spend some time with a qualified tech., and have it built. In my experience, brand name pc's are too proprietary (utilizing the economics of profit)with their hardware and software.

The shipping was very fast. Even though it advertised that I would be able to allocate 64 to 256MB of main memory to the onboard video graphics, the set up screen for the bios had grayed out the line where this reallocation was to take place. I sent an e-mail to HP's support on 10/05/2005 asking what to do. After resetting the memory chips and hitting the reset to defaults, their help desk informed me that this model was limited to 128MB of memory. The next person I dealt with sent me a link to an area of HP's web site saying this model could only allocate 128 MB of main memory. Meanwhild my computer is frozen at 64 MB for video graphics. In addition I was sent a link to behardware.com and a PDF of a motherboard, neither of which mentioned my problem. I called the support help number and was told they could do nothing about the grayed out area allowing me to only allocate 64 MB of main memory and that a supervisor would contact me. I was contacted on 10/07/2005 and was told I should call the place where I bought the computer for resolution which happed to be HP shopping. They first told me I should call HP support until I gave them my history so far and then I was told a case manager would contact me in 48 hours. I called back on 10/12/2005 and was told that it was 72 hours not 48 and to expect a call the next day, (10/13/2005). Today is 10/15/2005. Some of their products may be rock solid but if you ever have a problem that doesn't fit the help desk's kiddie script, you are in trouble. If I don't get called today, my only recourse is the Better Business Bureau, The Federal Trade commission and forums like this where I can let people know what they are getting into if they buy an HP product.

Most of the big name manufacturers use relatively lousy motherboards, or when they use a good one, they have a special version manufactured just for them with some features removed to save a few cents in manufacturing (in one instance HP had boards built that did not include a jumper to clear the CMOS -- wrecking a friends computer and forcing HP to ship him a new one). You're best bet is to order from places like IBuyPower.com where you can select the components. I've been sticking with Asus motherboards and AMD processors. Most of today's Asus motherboards for AMD 64-bit processors with 939 pins are future proof because they accept AMD's 64-bit dual core processors (which are way too expensive now for all but the wealthy, but will be affordable to regular people in a year or two). To see which ones support the dual core, go to http://support.asus.com/cpusupport/cpusupport.aspx and work your way to the AMD Athlon 64 X2 processors. Other than buying online from such manufacturers, you may be best off with a so-called ''white box'' computer built for you by a local computer expert or storefront. The catch is that a lot of these storefront charge high prices or, like the big-name manufacturers, skimp on the quality of parts. So you really need to specify which motherboard and parts you want -- and beware of cheap imitations. Good luck. And remember, friends don't let friend buy HP (or Compaq now).

Long waits, bad advice, and often very rude and insulting tech advisors -- simply a disaster. I've got to report, though, that Gateway has turned it around in terms of tech support. I just bought a Gateway MX7515 notebook and each time I called tech support with a question (beyond what the usual computer user would ask), the phone was answered within 25 seconds by a live technician (located in the U.S.A.) who knew his stuff pretty darn well and was very polite. And I must admit that if you want a highspeed notebook the MX7515 offers the AMD64 4000 mobile process, a GB of RAM, 100 GB hard drive, 15-inch monitor (and a lot of heat) for about $1300 at Best Buy. It's worth checking out if you want a notebook. Good luck. And remember, friends don't let friends buy HP (or Compaq now).

OK their desktops have very few external bays,I cannot configure for a chassis of my choice. Can't change their operating system when under their warranty. Cannot subtract any of their components to put in a higher spec component. All I can do is add components to a very restrictive (if at all) expansion possibilities. But still when my Hard Drive and Keyboard started giving problems 5000 miles from home who came out to change these the Next business day? You know who it is.....Bid D of couse.

I have been gaming from a Commie 64 up through the ranks of IBM and forward, and have used almost every make of puter at some point. The curtial aspects are 1. if you can do-it-yourself, 2. if you want to buy a system and just use it. If you can add to a puter, I have found that e-Machine is an excellent upgrader, and if you get somewhere in the top of the line, you will have plenty of slots, ram space and areas for hds, the e-Machine I ended up with when I was done was running at 2.5 Ghz, had a 512 Rad. video card, top of the line SoundBlaster, 1 Gig Ram, 200 Gig HD, and other little goodies, all picked up on sale for a song after rebates. That was my ''extreme gaming machine'' though I lost it through an unfortunate life experience. As far as out-of-the-box systems, I have used Dell, and the newer (since the combination of HP and Compaq) Compacq, with I am currently using for gaming as I purchased a fairly decent one on sale. 2.5 Ghz, 512 Ram, 128 video, 200 Gig HD, and a very decent sound card in a AMD 64 3400+ Compaq Presario bundle. Straight out of the box, I could play any game I have, such as Halo, Unreal Tourney 2004, BattleField 1942, and other farily intensive games with just a few tweaks of the options in each game. SO, as I am more than pleased with this particular system, I would have to recommend it for both gaming, general puting, and even a home wireless network system with 2 other puters here. Hope this helps a bit.

I have owned 5 Gateway computers and have not had a problem with any of them. My company switched from Gateway to Dell because we were taken over by a larger comapany using Dell. Almost everyone at our site has been unhappy with the switch. I am an electrical Engineer and have been here since the days before Apple. I have built my own machine but I don't think that the meager saving are worth it. When you buy a computer you get a lot of newer software that you don't get with a homebuilt built machine. With the problem of licensing software to a machine today this can be very important. My current machine is a 3.2 GHz Pentium 4 with a all of the bells and whistles. I almost alway buy Gateway's top speed machine and even added a 20in LCD with 1600X1200 resolution. My machine is two years old and I am already looking for the next replacement. Guess where I will buy my next computer from!

I have had a succession of three company-owned Dell notebooks and have been very happy with all of them. In August, I ordered a Dimension 5100 for my home. It took nearly two weeks, 16 hours on the phone either on hold or speaking with tech reps and ultimately a motherboard replacement, to get the thing working right. Now its terrific! If I had bought a Compaq or HP from CompUSA, I could have put it back in the box and returned it because it didn't work. With mail order, its not that simple. I did get a good price, but that doesn't count the value of my time trying to get things corrected with Dell over the phone. The frustrating part was that the blue screen error message that finally was decoded as a faulty motherboard had been given to the first Dell rep I spoke with. I think their tech rep training and software leaves a lot to be desired and you just have to keep plugging unitl you connect with someone who knows something.

H.P are good for that, the power supply is a wee mini one in a mini case and when you add the usual things to the puter I.E. printer scanner camera and other things the power is not up to it and dies The H.P power supply is expensive to replace[ you could buy a new full size box with power supply of a decent size and still have 80% of the power supply cost in your pocket]. Also some of these brands do not come with a copy of the operating system. just a stupid recovery disc. So if thing really turn bellyup You are in for trouble unless you have your own copy. I build quite a few desktops and agree that Asus boards are rock solid but they like good quality Ram.I would use a good dual channel Motherboard for gaming. That is not a bad thing as they never come back with a motherboard failure, the only thing recently is AMD processor failure,Had 2 in the last week. but on the whole the package is good. Unfortunaty in desktops you get what you pay for,and some of the retail brands are overpriced for what you get and can build one for. My advice is spend the extra 100 and get one built for what you want, and buy an operating system for it. Another trap is the Monitor, sure the LCD ones look great and do not take up much room, but the CRT ones are cheaper and the quality for what you pay is better. cheap LCDs are not worth it in terms of depth and resulution, unless you are doing plain office work and not playing games or graphic work.

My opinion is ...as a consumer you have to do a reserach in Help desk services from each manufacturer since most of them will give you support at a premium fee instead of free support and the amount of time of free support varies so the amount charge to you also varies I am using most of the time certain brands because of reliability and the 1st one is IBM (now LENOVO) 2nd Compaq/HP but I buy from Compaq branded units , not HP because aldo it is teh same company some units are still not to good on HP brand and Last is DELL.

At one time the gaints such as Dell, Gateway,and HP were small hungry companies looking for their neiche in the market.As with any growing company quality and reliable products are important. The sad news is those once growing companies are now hungry gaints more interested in profits than production. So I weigh in on the side of a stick built system.Have your system built with quality componets that reflect your style and your needs.Dont let someone else tell you what you need, tell them what you want and then hold your ground.

As far as quality goes E-machines used to be Packard Bell. AS a field tech I hate getting a Gateway/E-machine call because of the high rate of miss-diagnosed problems, wrong parts and parts shipped are for different model. Oh and the new trend of not supplying CDs is starting to get to me too. You can't expect John Q public to run a restoration utility to image his/her new machine. Image them at the factory, Clients can't.

I will only comment on vendors that I have had close contact with over the past three years since going any further back than that may not reflect their current product or support levels. Dell is my vendor of choice at work and we experience very few problems with them over the years dealing with servers, desktops, workstation destops, and a number of laptops. One of the things I like best about Dell is the level of online tech support available. You can take even the oldest of DELL systems plug in it's Service Tag number and even get it's original ship date and configuration. You can also download the latest drivers for even a very old system for any of the standard devices they ever offered as factory installed options for that system. They many times even offer drivers for OS versions that never even existed when they stopped production on a given system. The few times a year I experience a physical failure (mainly HD failures) and have to contact tech support (keep in mind Dell has a special EDU support team) I get a fast response and parts are on their way in no time. A service tech is also offered in most cases but unless I'm looking at a laptop I seldom take them up on the offer of a tech. I also do take the time to do most basic trouble shooting before I ever get on the phone in the first place. I've been doing computer setup and repair for over 20 years. As I say my contacts are rare perhaps 4-6 per year and we have about 80 DELL system in full time use including laptops that can take some heavy abuse out in the field. Gateway limited experience but all negative. Poor quality, even worse support. But that is from a work sample of one system. I will say I do know of a software developer located in SD (Gateway's home state) who use to use only Gateway systems for his office and gave high recommendations for Gateway to all his clients who has stopped using Gateway systems about two years ago due to quality and support issues. HP, I own a HP laptop and while it's an OK sytem I would never recommend HP to a business and they wouldn't be my first choice for an individual. My laptop uses an ATI graphics engine and the driver is not stable. ATI doesn't provide driver support for moble chipsets and says you have to get drivers from the system vendor. HP has yet to release a driver update in the almost two years I've owned this system. A new microsoft updates driver did come out about the same time as XP SP2 and that has seemed to be more stable. By the way I generally avoid Microsoft update site video drivers since more than once I have had the video drivers from them cause major issues and have been forced to boot into VGA mode and then roll back the drivers to the old version. Due to very poor driver support HP gets a low rating in my book. If your system isn't a current production model they tend to forget you exist. While I still give high marks to HP printers and they are my first choice in B&W laser printers as far as systems go they rank low in my book. The other thing I have noticed with HP systems is that if you look close at what you are getting they cut corners using older slower drives and ram to help keep system cost lower. At home I build my own system if you feel safe doing so it's a great way to get what you want. You can purchase top of the line components where it matters for your personal use and cut corners save money in areas that don't matter. Again if you wnat to go this route I suggest you get on parts vendors web sites and see what kind of driver support they have for a componet hat is a few years old. Heck I have a few old low end systems used for testing varius configurations that have components close to ten years old that you can still get XP or server 2000/2003 drivers for.

IMO, Dell is worse off then they were years ago. They're still pretty good as they rank tops in profits. They're just not as good they were then. I used an old, hand-me-down Dell Dimension Pentium 133MHz model w/16MB RAM (forgot the model name) back in late '99, a new Dimension T550 (P3 550MHz, 128 RAM) from '00 to '04, and a Dimension 8300 (P4 3GHz, 512 RAM) from '04 to present, so I can unbaised-ly offer first hand obvservations from a home user perspective. This was so several years ago... 70% to 85% of Dell's customers are business users. I'm not sure how happy corporate America is with Dell's Inspirons, Optiplex, and lower end Dimension systems, but overall, it appears good. There are more home users today than before. I'm guessing Dell may be worse then 5 to 7 years ago, but overall, they're PCs get the jobs done. There will definately be the fair share of complainers (some way off, others legit). Dell's PCs are getting better and better in some ways, like batter cases for Dimensions, media card readers, better value, etc. but worse in others (not, these reasons show why Dell is worse than years ago, NOT why Dell is ''the worst'', b/c AFIAK, they aren't there) : -proprietary parts. Mobo, PSU, and IIRC, even the case are made to go together, but not ATX standard form factors. If you want a new PSU or mobo, u either have to buy directly from Dell (there are 3rd party sellers that do offer fitting parts) or them in pairs for compatibility reasons. -Dell now offers high end/gaming systems, but it's still cheaper to build your own high end system -tech support is going down the crapper. It's not ''god awful'' but far cry from their peak during the late 90s, early 00s. I get agents who just provide answers read right off of Q&A manual without the impression that these guys really understand how to solve the problem. every once in a while, yes, an indian accented person who i can't comprehend. One left a message on my machine which was worthless b/c i could understand NOTHING -cheaper quality parts -TS only covers hardware and some winXP. U have a problem with Office or a burner drive software, likely not to get help -they don't provide manuals anymore, just on your PC. Not good when you get the blue scrn of death, and painful to print out all those pages. -standard TS only 30 days now (upgrade to 1 yr for $22) -Rumor is Dell is gonna do away with online coupons. If true, the sticker price for Dell PCs can be outrageously high. IMO, Dell is nice if: -u get it less than the sticker price -avoid their CRT monitors (If you must buy a monitor from them, their Ultrasharp line of LCDs are quite good) -can troubleshoot nearly all minor to moderate problems or don't mind researching online (how to install your own apps, findnig out how to restore USB2 speeds in when it only says USB1, how to get rid of spyware) -only need to call TS for only serious problems -don't get a lemon. So everything works fine after a year, and u can worry about the rest by upgrading -Won't upgrade the mobo, PSU, and case. Comfy with dong minor upgrades yourself (add more RAM, upgrade DVD burner yourself, add hd, etc.)

I had the computer for 2 weeks and the power supply went out. I called Dell customer support (which by the way is located somewhere in another country). I was on hold for about 45 minutes and when I finally got somebody on the phone the person kept telling me to do some nonsense procedures. For example she would tell me to turn on the PC, check to see if there are any light turn on in the back. I informed the representative that I was a certify computer technician that all I needed was to have Dell send me a new power supply. I mean are these people even computer knowledgeable?? After 2 hour of being on the phone she tells me that there seems to be something wrong with my power supply. She told me that they were going to send a certify technician to replace all the components inside the case. After 3 weeks the tech showed up did his thing and left. 3 days after I had the same problem again. I called Dell again and I had to go through the same crap again. So after being on the phone for 2 hours I just told the representative to take their useless computer back and refund me my money. Instead I opted for another gateway (I already own 2). Last year I felt for Dell's commercials where they were offering the Dimension PC for under $500 dollars. To make things short I had the very same problems. And no it has nothing to do with my electrical outlets because this happen at my new house. So if you asked me, Dell is the worst PC there is out there. Now I stick with nothing but Gateway, great prices, and great AMERICAN customer support.

It was made in 2003, so i guess it could be a little dated. But more importantly, i was wondering where a good place would be to go buy another hard drive. Because i know how to take it out and put in another one. And i live in Canada. The cheapest i have found one for was on ebay, for 138.00 us, or like approx 168.00 canadian. Although this is relatively cheap, futureshop wants to charge approximately 300-400 dollars for a new one, where they install it. I'm running xp, not that that is important, but it runs pretty decent for only 256mb of memory and 40gb of ram. Please let me know asap, because i need my laptop for highschool/university.

None of these of the shelf computer brand's really make thier own stuff.All they do is asemble them together so if you go with HP, COMPAQ, DELL it makes no difference. However if you are a gamer or work in a field where you will be doing graphically intesive apps., then go with the highend stuff better yet put together yourself, otherwise any main brand will do. Just check the spec's.

Once you deal with someone competent, they're fine, but get anyone other than a USA person, you might as well be talking to a wall who speaks broken english.......

A &quot;White Box&quot; system (one built by your local independant computer store) is the most popular brand by far. White boxes outsell the top 3 tier-one manufacturers combined, and there is a reason. They are usually custom-built using individual components. If the system builder knows their business, they will have assembled a short list of high-quality, performance-matched components which in total will out-perform all but the fastest &quot;Brand&quot; systems. I have personally benchtested my systems against the top 5 systems as noted by Cnet and others, and they have beaten the performance of closely-matched configurations by an average of 17% and more. And SERVICE, SUPPORT, and WARRANTEE are big factors to consider. With all of the components used in a good system having individual warrantees of at least 3 years to lifetime, we have been able to offer MINIMUM warrantees of 3 years on our standard systems, and 5 years on our top of the line systems. So before limiting yourself to a &quot;Branded&quot; box, PLEASE consider your local system builder. They may have what you are looking for locally, and just maybe a better box than you would have gotten for your hard-earned dollar.

Obviously every service line is only as good as its individual operators, but I've had great support from Dell and have always found them both courteous and constructive. My 2-year-old Dimension desktop recently had its hard drive trashed through pure ignorance (I didn't know you couldn't combine Norton Ghost, Norton GoBack and a SATA stripe array disk...) and Dell support could not have been kinder - new hard drive, tower pick-up and delivery exactly when promised, not a word of reproach even. I cannot thank them enough. One thing about Dell, you MUST have your PC's individual identity number to hand when you phone them. They need access to the machine's past history and can otherwise do nothing, but that seems quite reasonable to me. Hi all, this is a great forum! - Meg.

We bought our computers at the some time. I've had 3 motherboards replaced, a new CDRW , and the entire CPU gutted and redone also. I use my computer for business and I am so disappointed in Gateway. I do admit their customer service is great by phone. But when they had their stores....they STUNK! Now for the E Machine.....well my husband's is still going!!!!! Like the energizer bunny. It's unreal! So now I have a very bitter taste from Gateway products. I know that Emachine & Gateway are one of the same kind now, which worries me, because I WAS thinking about purchasing an E Machine. So, I guess I'll just think about it. My opinion only. Take care. Good luck

Over the past several years I have purchased and used 2 Dell laptops and 3 Dell PC's. Except for one small problem which was promptly fixed I have had no, count this, zero problems. Dell has the most extensive web site permitting one to customize their purchase, both software and hardware) more easily than any other site. I have more confidence in a Dell product than any other on the market, just don't buy bottom of the line with any brand.

I would have several questions for you to understand your knnowledge of computers prior to giving advice on what to buy and not just brand. 1) What is the primary use and/or purpse for purchasing a computer, followed by prioritizing the remaining uses of the computer? 2) Do you know any manufacturers names who produce cpus, motherboards, memory, hard drives, video cards, sound cards, and peripherals in general? 3) Do understand the lingo or terminalogy of computers when refering to such things as ATA, SATA, DIMM, AGP, ATX, MATX, etc., and what is their function or uses? 4) How much or little do you wish to spend on your purchase of a new computer. Only after finding out that information would I be able to give you advice on what type of internal computer hardware (cpu, mobo, memory, etc.) you would need to purchase to fulfill your needs to meet the priorities placed earlier without disappointment in your computer purchase. Almost all computer builders (Dell, Gway, HP, etc.) use the least or minimum hardware capability to reduce cost on the mid to low end priced computers and yet still meet customer satisfaction. There are computer builders (Aleinware, Cyberpower, Overdrive, VooDoo, etc.) that build good high performance computers with GREAT results and will fit your needs from any level or purpose. Do you what a KIA Rio, Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Ford Mustang, Corvette, or a Viper? What's your medicine? Also, the operating system can make a difference on how well your computer performs. Windoze, Mac OS, and Linux. I know how many people fill about the latter and fill out of their environment when it comes to Linux. But, it works and its reliable when compared to Windows. You'll reboot your computer about ten to twelve times with windows before you'll need to with Linux. Some Linux distributions say that they are easy to use and easy to install, and we all know that's not true! However, with a small learning curve and still being able to run your favorite Windows based sofware, Xandros Desktop OS, Version 3, Business Edition offers all that and more. Easy to install and easy to use! I'm writing this reply using Xandros Open Circulation Edition (OCE), which is free, and all the internet providers/network support that says they don't support Linux. Well, Xandros is Linux, with a different personality and 99.9% of all viruses affect only Windoze computers. Xandros Linux (www.xandros.com) I have an A+ and Net+ certifications and have been working on computers and networks for the last 10 years managing well over 100 computers, workstations, and servers at any one time. I have seen and bought all different brands of computers, workstations, and servers. I have built some of our most reliable computers and servers that are still running for over 8 years without any hardware failures (knock on wood). Don't take someone's advice that has only purchased several computers in their life and had good luck with their picks and/or purchases. Ask someone who purchases computers alot and they will tell you overall which computers perform well and last longer between failures. FAILURES? All computers will have a failure eventually! Some sooner than others! Good Luck! If yuo cna raed tihs, wyh do we sepnd so mcuh tmie tyrnig to ptu lteters in oerdr to be albe to udnresantd waht is bineg siad in ecah wrod?

I am still a computer dummie but when I needed help they were great including guiding me thru reformatting the h. drive. No long phone wait and I was actually speaking to an American I could understand instead of some bozo offshore. Whenever possible I return or avoid products whose help lines are offshore and whose people working for $5.00 an hour are completely unintelligible. Hooray for E-machines

It stopped working (power would not go on) 6 months after I bought it. It was under warranty, but in order to have it repaired, I had to ship back to Calif. at my cost. They have had the computer for over 7 weeks. They have no customer service line that is directly affiliated with the company or located within the U.S. The result is that your calls are received by an answering service that allows Averatec to effectively ignore its customers. The computer was disfuctional and I am suffering for their mistake. Averatec = the Devil.

I have been eyeing Dells for the last couple months, trying to decide if I want the hassel of building my own, or trying Dell again (My current computer is a 4 year old Dell Dimension 4100, which I have had zero hardware problems with). I had been looking at the Dimension 9100, which now it looks like has been replaced with the XPS400. Dell said it's basically the same box as the 9100, but Dual Core Pentiums are now standard, not an optional upgrade. The bigger change seems to be the warranty. They now, as an XPS system instead of a Dimension sytem, give you a more premium sounding warranty with shorter wait times, and what the salesguy made it sound like, U.S. based techs. After talking to the sales guy, it did sound like Dell was getting the message about poor customer satisfaction with support, and is trying to take better care of customers who spend a little more on the XPS line. If I do decide to purchase a Dell, I thing I'll wait until Costco carries the XPS400. They give you a 6 month return policy, not the crummy 21 days that Dell gives you. Of course you can't customize Costco-Dell computers, but they usually put together fairly nice packages, all with free shipping.

I, too, purchased an HP Pavillion and after using it about a month, I wiped the hard drive clean and installed Windows XP Professional. Of course, this makes the warranty invalid. Windows XP Home is complete crap. Now I have a computer that works like I want it too. The ram is only upgradable by 512 and that is bad. All the other parts seem to be working fine, the DVD writer, etc. I do believe that HP excells at producing printers but not PC's. I will not purchase another and plan to have one made for me in the future to my specifications so it will be totally upgradable. This type is more expensive at first but less expensive in the long run because of its upgradability.

I would hope he or she would be capable of knowing exactly what needs to be done and can troubleshoot any and all problems. My son does this. He reads and finds out answers for himself. He never has to call a tech. There is the internet too with a lot of answers. I would rather have a home built PC because you know what is in it and can upgrade it when you want.

Dell has figured out... if you sell ''bundled'' computer systems it will help those who do not have a clue how to do so. Their Pentium Celeron computer packages are really inexpensive and most novices do not know the difference between the Pentuim Celeron chip and the Pentium ''numbered'' chip, all they are looking for how good it looks and if it is cheap. I have to admit that Dell have impoved the quality of their ''bundled'' computer system but need to improve in the customer service area. Other companies should take a clue from DELL but I am still a Compaq customer, have been since 1997..

So did the replacements. I replaced with my neighbors hand-me-downs and they've lasted til now. 4. Not sure exactly what happned in the beginning, but I actually ended up deleting all software, reinstalling windows and repartitioning the drives within 2 days of turning the thing on the for the first time. This means I also lost a lot of the extra software they bundled in, but at that point I was just glad to have a computer. I like being able to design my own PC, but next time I'll try another vendor. Dell is a bit too stodgy though.

We were in dire need for an updated system due to the wife going to college and the kids relying more on the internet to perform homework. It was a good deal/low cost with the mail in rebates. We've had it for two years now and e-machines did their homework with hardware and software compatibiity. Some computer builders will just throw computers parts together and call it a computer and not check software compatibility. E-machines builds a good computer with very good customer support! I will definately buy again from E-machines! I've had my share of problems with Dell (if they can't fix the E, how can they build a computer), Gateway (has gotten better), HP (not my favorite brand), Systemax (someone give me an axe!), and so on at work and that's why I'm NOT brand loyal. The few E-machines purchased at work have worked great and still performing well. How well? The users did NOT want to give up their old E-machines for a brand new Dell or Gateway!

(Apple IIgs and Mac) Besides the Macintosh (which now is just way to expensive) the Sony is by far the more superior machine. Everything just works so well and thier web site is always current with hardware/software updates and drivers. I have had far less software issues on my Sony than any other machine (besides the apple) I convert home movies into DVD's as well as create small videos for advertisment for businesses.

You pick the components to match the machine style that you want. You can use your old software and don't spend the first 6 months wondering if its okay to delete this file or that file because it didn't come with the preinstalled trash. I've built my last two and now its time for new motherboards, only to upgrade the processors. They have outlasted the prefab HP/packard Bell/Epson/IBM/Dell systems that I have had in the past. Best of all they do what I tell them and don't try to contact the vendor automatically.

Dell's desktop computers are next to garbage. I bought 2 Dimension computer in a 2 year period and they were both defective ( BAD POWER SUPPLIES and BAD MOTHERBOARD). And their technical support is next to not having one at all. They are somewhere in the distant jungles of India. Those people have no tenchical skills at all, everything they tell you, they are reading it right off of the monitor. If you want good product, go with Gateway...

I tried to buy a Dell online and on phone due to their extensive advertising and bargain pricing - was very put off with experience and cancelled order (they were more interested in the sale than in helping me get what I wanted or needed). Went to HP site, got refurbished HP Pavillion (this is in 2001). Not ONE Problem, NONE, to date. This is my third HP, and won't get anything else until absolutely am behind the times...I love HP and feel like they are dependable. I like their keyboards, and you can upgrade the ram some, but overall a great machine. Did not get disks with it and had to make my own, which is not to my liking, but the only con I can think of. If I decide to upgrade from this one, I will probably look around based on better knowledge of what I'm doing and what I want and need. I will check out what has been suggested here such as Monarch, Sony, and the Emachines, but will certainly give preference to my experience with my HP's. Perhaps others have had other experiences with them, but I can say I highly recommend HP's.

It's very functional and I've been happy with any interaction with their customer support. If all someone wants is to surf, word process, etc.. Go with an HP Pavillion; however, if you're wanting to do any serious applications graphic-intensive software or gaming, I'd go (and have gone) with someone else. From my research and lots of forum reading I decided to go with Monarch. It was a great experience - they offer a great selection of parts at good prices, and responded to any questions I had in a timely fashion. My HP with be relegated to TV duty (MCE).

My friends and family members all have Dell or other and I can't stand using their computers because in comparison they really suck. As far as support I have never had to use it. HP is easy to upgrade, never had any compatability issues and updated drivers are sent to me whenever available. My advise is to get to really know your computer nomatter what brand, learn how to take care of it properly yourself, fine tune it to your needs like you would your car and you should have little problems. Most of the people I know that have crappy working computers or end up buying a new one every year do not know a thing about them and never bothered to learn how to take care of them.

Maybe the results are weighted to earlier, more reliable machines (before they started cutting so many corners), but with all the Dell bashing, they rated quite well for hardware reliability, support was another story. I'm sure some folks here will say Dell spends so much on advertising, hence their good rating.

I recently upgraded the memory, processor from 1.8 to 2.8 ghtz, the video card, and sound card. It was very easy and I was able to do all upgrades myself. I am an unofficial support person in my community and have dealt with numerous problems with other brands of computers. I have also dealt with almost every tech support for the different brands of computers. My best experience has been with Dell. My worst experience was with Compaq. My sister-in-law owned a Gateway and had nothing with problems with it and the tech support. My recommendation: Go With Dell!

I just bought an Apple running OX X Panther in Feb. 2005 and a Sony running Win XP/Home in Jul 2005. Every once in a while I have a Security Update for the Apple but I almost always get major updates for Apple's software: Garage Band, i-tune, Quick Time. The Apple just works, everyday. It is really a quality machine. The Sony has glitches in it from the first day. Sony service is very poor. They think that every computer user is an IT specialist. &quot;Fix it yourself.&quot; Every day or every other day I download updates from the 7 anti-malware programs and I scan every other day. The last MS Security Update took hours. Fortunately, one of the &quot;fixes&quot; that caused other computers to not work or even boot didn't happen to me. Maybe MS's update didn't install....maybe it was another &quot;failed&quot; update. I'd better check. OS X Panther is just great. I don't need the widgets or the Spotlight program so I didn't upgrade. I won't upgrade to Vista either. That will be another &quot;Swiss Cheese&quot; OS from MS.

The likes of N64, PS2, and XBox360 are usually more powerful than whaterever's available for PC. After a short while though, PC hardware becomes available to surpass that. Also keep in mind, vid game consoles and PCs are 2 different machines designed for different uses. While they both play high-tier games (PC needs to be properly config of course), some of the comparisons betw the 2 are apples and oranges

I did find that if I looket in the desktop advanced settings it reports 256mb post says 64mb, bios says 64mb and directx diagnostics reports only 66mb of memory being used somewhere (I assume that's for video and something else). ATI specs say you can only get up to 128MB of shared memory. The ATI PCIX cheapie that you can buy at Best Buy will only support 128 shared but also has 128 onboard.

This with all the upgrades is essentially the same thing as the SR1650NX with the exception of having a nVidia 64 meg 6600SE graphics card that can get the rest of its 256 meg from main memory.

They have the worst customer service, they refuse to honor their warrenty on computers still clearly under warrenty and their solution to all computer troubles or issues is to wipe it out and start fresh again. They refuse to look at your system to make a diagnosis and they basically just want you off the phone. Oh, another thing, don't bother asking for their managers, they dont have them. Not one person we spoke to including their QA dept. has a manager. Another crappy company who doesn't care about the consumers who bought their product. The long and short of this story is my 7 month old computer won't boot. It's in a loop. No safe mode, no any mode, it just wont boot. This all happened one lovely day in October 2005 when I decided to start my computer so that I could use it. Crazy, I know, hitting the &quot;on&quot; button can certainly stress out a machine, but I did it anyway. So it starts to boot and them &quot;whamo&quot; it freezes up. Huh, thats weird. So I do what most people do, I hit &quot;ctrl,alt,delete&quot; to get it to reboot. Yah, well that was the beginning and the end of it. It's now stuck in this loop that won't boot in any mode. We called HP Tech Support. We've spoken to 5 people now. All of them say just wipe it out. That's all the warrenty covers. Nobody wants to look at it to see if they can fix it without losing my data, that's way out of the question. They have no trouble with us taking it to one of their &quot;authorized service centers&quot; - Best Buy - and paying out the nose for them to look at it but they themselves at HP have no interest in the customer, service or holding up their warrenty. They happily offered us the option to buy a warrenty upgrade which we promply asked &quot;Why in gods name would I pay anymore money to you people when you cant honor the warrenty we have now&quot;??? Here's sonmething you guys will love too, the QA guy, Darren, said he didn't even own an HP, he built his own computer. What does that tell you? Their own employees don't buy their crap, So why should we?? Another side note: eMachines has ranked higher in Customer Support in Consumers Reports than HP. eMachines??? Can you believe that?

Four years ago, I purchased a Dell computer because I was so unhappy with Gateways tech support - foreigners which ole ears had a lot of difficulty understanding and I felt like lack of knowledge. I purchased the Dell Dimension 8100 because through my research, all arrows pointed to Dell for their superior tech help which was true until last year. Last year, the Dimension 8100 was replaced by Dell with a 8300. A few months later, I noticed that the technicians at Dell as well as the hold time was spiraling downward. I was quite disappointed. I had a power surge a few weeks back and I now lack the color red in my monitor so I am thinking about replacing the system. I am torn as to whether to purchase a Gateway, Dell or this eMachine that I keep reading about. Do you get phone tech support with an eMachine? Also, while I have the experts attention, which processor is the best - Pentium or AMD Athlon? I am not a gamer, just a regular user with a very small business.

Just a thought as one time I called Dell tech support and must have typed in a wrong digit as I got through to the business tech support line. First, I was shocked at how fast the call was answered and was answered by an obviously U.S.A. English speaking technician. They would not help me and I was transferred to someone living across the waters with lousy English.

That would be their focus of tech support calls similar to how M$ focuses so much on Windows and Office being that those are M$' cash cows. Maybe ppl could make up phoney business names without registering them to get better tech support?
5218	164	112547	1692460	1691880	ackmondual	1/23/06 10:23 AM	1.13801178E12	my takes....	I've bought 2 Dell PCs and that's it. Back in '99 to '01, TS was great. Now it's decent at best. Hard to understand accents, 12min+ wait times, seemingly unknowledgeable agents, and skimpy coverage on warranties and software are all to blame. If I were to buy a new PC, I would have to do research. I'd go Dell only if I could find boatloads of online coupons as at the very least, I know what to expect (and not to expect) from Dell. Otherwise, I'd probably buy from iBuyPower or another such type vendor. For emachines, i hear it's hit or miss on tech supp, but I've never bought their PCs either along with Gateway. May wanna try some site with vendor/manufacturer reviews like Cnet, epinions, and Amazon.

The feeling of choosing the right pieces to go in your rig is AWESOME. I just build my first over the summer, mainly ot play the lastet games (eg Battlefiled 2, Call of Duty 2....)and is working great. Intel P4 3.0E 1.5G Corsair XMS RAM 160G Seagate SATA HD NVIDIA 6800GT ASPIRE X-Plorer ATX w/550 psu My advice to anyone who is thinking about building one, do research, research, research and more research. Have fun. BTW-I'm not a techie, but I do all my own trouble shooting. Ask the right questions and Google to find an answer. Help Desk/Customer Support are a joke and are actually HELPLESS.

Also gone through many posts/discussions about it, but I HAVE NEVER ACTUALLY BUILT MY OWN PC BEFORE!! If some1 else w/better experience posts somethigg contrary, by all means shoot for that instead..... As for how you do it, yeah, many online guides available (text, illustrations, even videos), altho it's usually generc, as different motherboards, processors, where to put system RAM, etc. may vary, so unless you find a popular brand, you'll have to tweak the instructions somewhat for your own equipment. Else, if you have a techie friend, ask him to help out as you do it. In general, if the heatsink/cooling comes attached, then it'll be easier. Else, installing that part is more difficult since applying the thermal grease and putting it on needs more finese and precision then the other parts. The other stuff, the cards are just plugged in, and maybe even connected with a power supply. Harddrives and optical drives are put in the proper bays and connected with either SATA or IDE ribbon cables and also hooked up to power supply. Stick in system RAM. Load it up. Install WinXP, install drivers, install user software, and you're good to go. Buy parts from places like NewEgg. NewEgg is popular for PC parts for ppl who assemble their own PCs, but by all means, it certainly isn't the only place. I just can't think of any others at the moment by name. Well, perhaps also sites like ZipZoomFly, TigerDirect, Outpost, and PCMall may also sell PC parts. For the best prices, again, ppl seem to like NewEgg for that. However, I have bought peripherals cheaper elsewhere. E.g. a Logitech mx510 optical mouse was only $23 at ZipZoomFly with free shipping. Newegg sold it for $28, but plus $4 NJ sales tax (since Newegg has a warehouse in that state), plus $6 for shipping and handling which made it $38. A whole $15 more in the end. Again, Newegg does have competitive prices, but doubtless you'll be able to find better deals elsewhere for certain components. Otherwise, do your own comparison shopping. If you're even lazier than that, post onto PC forums like this and ask for direct recommendations on what PC components to buy and where. Parts to buy: case motherboard + heatsink? think this comes with mobos cooling fans processor system RAM hardrive video card (unless integrated into motherboard) monitor (unless you have an old one to use) Network Interface Card modem Sound card (unless integrated into motherboard) speakers CD/DVD ROM CD/DVD burner floppy disk drive keyboard + mouse hope this helps

I preferred Newegg over the other, but that just my opinion. Check with CNET product review, they recommends other sites to purchase each different items. Happy building.

I have never seen ANY bang-for-your-buck deals there, even with the coupons and &quot;existing customer only&quot; offers they email me. I could configure a gaming Dell with the same spec level for hundreds less. Gateway also has no deals either, BTW, for business or gamer systems Also, to be safe you HAVE to buy Alienware's longest extended warranties, especially if you buy 1 of their pricey laptops. I own an Alienware laptop that cost over $3,000 2 years ago, it overheats (started 2nd month),and has had everything but the LCD and case itself replaced during the first year (multiple service calls - got maybe 6 months use of use out of it TOTAL the first year while it was under warranty), but STILL has heating issues. Fast, pricey and beautiful, but a lemon all told. With so little use, never moved or traveled with, it now even has a stress crack on the LCD's frame do to too much weight from the 16.1 (or larger) inch laptop LCDs. Check out forums concerning Alienware - even their towers have lots of lemons due to stupid builder errors.

I was recently forced to contact HP's technical support when the hard drive in my laptop died. As my computer was less than 1 year old, it still fell under the warranty. I thought this would be a simple thing to resolve, but what followed was perhaps one of the most excruciating tech service phone calls in history. I spoke with the technician for at least an hour and a half while he sprinkled me with misinformation (telling me that HP could transfer the data from my defective drive to a new one for $199), put me on hold probably half a dozen times, and just flat out didn't understand the issue. As I'd just lost an extensive amount of data, an uninformed service technician was a headache I did not need. He finally transferred me to another technician who told me that the original technician's information was incorrect and scheduled me an appointment at the service center (sent me a box and everything). But the story doesn't end, as I made the mistake of calling again to try and get some information regarding my warranty. I just wanted to *see* the warranty, as in, read the actual text. Here I was greeted with another technician named &quot;Charles,&quot; who played the same game -- give random information not related to the customer's question, put the customer on hold, repeat random information, put the customer on hold again. I really got the feeling that he wasn't just be uncooperative; he just didn't understand English. I finally asked for Charles' supervisor, and then did a dance to try and prevent me from speaking with his supervisor. &quot;Is there a reason why you wish to speak with him? He won't be available for a long time. I'll have to put you on hold, and I don't know when he'll pick up.&quot; Etc. I sat on hold for 5 minutes, before &quot;Charles&quot; picked up again, and asked if there was any more information he could give me. I told him he could give me the information to reach his supervisor. He put me back on hold. I think &quot;Charles&quot; was just waiting for me to hang up. A &quot;supervisor&quot; picked up (I'm still a bit suspicious) and told me that he couldn't provide my warranty information and that I would have to call another number (which I am about to call). I explained to him the hoops I had to jump through just to speak with him, he offered a weak apology for it, and the call ended. I mean, every time I go to their stupid site, I see the little J.D. Power's Award, and the claim that HP has the best customer service care on the planet, so I was expecting something stellar. But with these two calls in just a few days, I just don't see it, unless I somehow managed to find the two lumps of coal in the sea of diamonds that is HP's Total Care service group. Maybe the problem is that the award was issued in 2005. So too bad my computer broke down in *2006.* Needless to say, I am not happy. My friends are not happy. No one I know is happy right now. Not with my HP product nor the Extended Service Plan I purchased to cover it or the &quot;expert&quot; technicians who wasted at least 2.5 hours of my life. My conclusion? HP's Total Care customer service is fantastic...if you don't ever have to use it.

I did have a motherboard problem at first as it was dropped (during shipping at their company) and when I called tech support wondering why my ports weren't working , they were laughing and having a good ol' time. They also said I only had 30 days to report it and I was past. I furiously spouted off how it said 90 on my paper and they insisted it was extended only. So, after a while, I got mad after seeing that they had a 1 year warranty standard on all emachines (which was not listed on my pc box or manual)it was on the web site, which I had no internet at the time,called the corporate office and blew a fuse. I will say this, even though it was past warranty, I explained how I was told it was up after 30 days, and they refurbished the whole pc for me except for the power supply and hard drive. MB, fans, dvd drives , all new. The hard drive was mine, an upgrade which I took out prior to shipping. Unfortuanately 3 years later , now, the power supply showed no signs of slowing down , or any problems and just froze up frying my CPU and perhaps the motherboard. But I have seen this happen to many other brands as well. I do miss it as it ran like a top but I am going to soon buy the asus 939 mb, which one specifically yet I don't know, and build my own. Anyway, yes when it did run, it was great. But there are known issues with the power supplies which I would hope are now fixed. So it's still a hit and miss situation as with all brands I suppose.

Great for cubicles with little room or stacking under a conference table. There are also GX280 & GX620s that have plenty of room for full sized video cards, additional Hard drives (they come with additional rails also) and an extra 5 1/4 and 3 1/2 drive bays. The major downside still is in three years when you've squeezed out all you can with upgrades you won't be able to slap a new motherboard in to keep the system from becoming obsolete.

I have an hp laptop have had it since June. (got hp due to swell discount pricing, bought it at the same time as a server). Well about a month ago s few pixels went bad in the display so I called HP. I arranged for them to send me a box so i could send it in for 3 day repair. THe person i talked to guarrenteed me my laptop back within five days. Well they sent the box to the wrong address 3 times, one dude sent a laptop to a randomm house. ONe guy canceld the one order that was right. I eneded up talking to managers etfc just to get a box and whne I did i got 3. So I relunctantly sent my laptop to them. This was on on the 20 of last month. Well they lost the laptop. They said they were just going to send me a new one which was fine (i removed hd beofre sending) well they sent that one to the wrong address so it sat outside for a while and got ruined before fedex picked it back up. So yesterday I finallly got my laptop back....... It has a new display with a nice gouge in the center of the display. So i call them and tell them abou it and let them know that I won't be able to send it in because I can't go wiithout my laptop for another month. They aggreed to send me the display so i could install it. I made very certain ( as i did in the past that they sent it to this addres) Guess what.... they sent it to the wrong one...... well yesterday my laptop lit on fire.... sparks started flying out of it. When HP replaced the display they scotched taped the wires around the pivot bolt that holds the display on. So as I opened and closed the display it ripped the sheilding off. So I called HP and talked to the Custoemer Service manager who told me that my laptop was in China being serviced (wheile it is sitting in front of me). Well when i mentioned fire and laptop because of thier poor repair job I immediatly got transferred to the executive director of consumer affairs. I talked with her for a while she told me that the only way they are fixing it is if i send it back in. I told her that they had already sent a display to me she told me that isn't possible...... well we talked about that for a while. Then I told her that due to course requirments and a satilite design project I was unable to go w/o the laptop for a month. She said i was lying and to just borrow a computer. Well I told her to go ahead and send me a box....... 2 hours later i check on the order to make sure it is right and guess what .... she sent the box to the wrong address..... I call her and she cancels the order and hangs up the phone.. I get an email from her today saying that she recreated the order. Now for the time being the laptops fire problem is fixed temporatily....... however there is stil a gouge in the display.......She told me that i probably got &quot;one of those laptops that constantly has things go wrong&quot;. I asked her why and she said I had bad luck. I asked to speak to her manager and she said that she didn't have one. I read over my contract and it clearly stipulates 3 day turnaround (no where does it mention any thing about unless or except). Or they will ship parts. I have been told by the executive officer that they are probably going to keep sending me broken laptops to the wrong address. I am lost as to what to do. I left out a lot of the story btw...... i am sure you will have questions.. But I would appreciate any advice........I am kinda lost on this one. BTW buying a new display, (samnsung plasma, isn't an option they are ~$1000) even though I have been told by two managers there that is probably the only way this is getting fixed. I have been since advised to see if I could get any help from the media while trying to solve my issue. Are you interested in something like this?

I was with HP for about 14 hours. Talked to their case managers, they are talking about legal terms. Oh its Warranty, not gurantee sir! HP Never ever buy it. Don't make that mistake, which I did.

Internet, viruses, spyware, trick emails, worms, infected pictures, videos, phones, MF printers, music, TV, downloads, uploads, smaller, aesthetics etcare all contributors to make your computers fail. A good builder will know how to protect your computer from overload and still keep it operable. Its not dell, hp, gateway, compaq or emachine. it is the person building the rig -- it is about what they know. Air flow, cache and bus compatibility, hard drive failure rates, OS, 6bit or 8 or 10bit video cards etc...I have a laptop from 1989 that works and I've never had to repair it. All the above companies are in business to make money and so are the little guys--what you are paying for is their expertise. Just using the &quot;right&quot; parts is not enough. A good system builder almost has to know how the computer is going to be used, regardless of what the customer tells you. Like when they say, &quot;I only am going to surf the net and read and write emails.&quot; They usually have 3 kids, dog and a jealous wife. Which means speed a good antivirus, printer, indestructible case with locking or fingerprint entry and a good warranty on the LCD, with a flash drive, and possibly a camera. The type of DVD burner, how much ram, CPU speed, and size of hard drive, internet and apps with the OS should be discussed. There should be a discussion on the do's and don'ts, like don't lose your OS CD and do defrag often etc...A good system builder will offer a warranty one that is paid for and one that is not. The big companies will give you 1 to 3 years warranty usually it is included in the price. The big companies can build 10,000 computers in 2 weeks and if 3000 break that is acceptable to their bottom line. Big companies have Millions of dollars to build 100s of thousands of computers. But for the past few years the big companies are feeling pressure from the little guy and that 10,000 has dropped to 5000. So they decided to move in by bracketing the market. Offering high end computers and low end computers and everything in between, unfortunately the low end stuff kind of sucks, especially the support. But now computer users want low cost computers and they want to work for 5 years, which puts a lot of pressure on the little system builder. In conclusion, if not dell then what brands are highly rated is the wrong question. What person is highly rated is the right question. Just about every town has a computer genius and every family has at least one person who professes ultimate computer knowledge. But the ones who have been in business for over 5 years has the knowledge and that is the person you look for.

But lo and behold, almost *exactly* 1 year later, the hard drive dies again. I call their HP Case Manager Escalation line (what you call when you don't want to get the runaround by outsourced customer service reps in India), and after leaving a few messages, I got Jason on the line. Jason had a lovely argumentative demeanor and droll monotone voice, and his commentary was riddled with frequent sighs and scoffing. He wasn't interested in helping so much as he was interested in how I got their senior Case Manager number. When the lovely Jason asked why I was calling, I replied that since my hard drive had died recently, I wanted to give HP a call and see if I could get this resolved without having to deal with their (bumbling) technical support group. &quot;Recently??&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;It was almost a year ago!&quot; I replied, &quot;Yes, I consider that to be fairly recent.&quot; (Honestly, should consumers expect to have to replace major system components because of failure every single year? Is that how their company does business?) He scoffed audibly. I'm seriously beginning to think that HP doesn't give these folks any training whatsoever. They certainly have no concept of service, making it a point to sound as annoyed as possible while filling out your case report. Jason's entire purpose seemed to be to get me off the line any way he could. He told me I needed to call their Tech Support line so they could walk me through the issue. I told him (politely) I knew what the issue was because it was the exact same issue I'd had before. He told me I needed to call the laptop division of HP service, but when I asked the number, he didn't know what it was. He told me I could either call India and allow them to enter a case report, or (and he *really* sounded like he didn't want to do this), he could enter a report for me, but then I'd have to &quot;wait 4 maybe 5 days before I'd hear back.&quot; I asked if he'd please get started on entering the case report and that's when he got really annoyed. I listened to Jason mumble under his breath for the next 10 minutes while he typed away at his computer. Trust me, he had absolutely nothing nice to say, and I left the call feeling that precisely nothing is going to be done about this problem. Figures. I'm not really certain why HP feels its Customer Service is so stellar. They're sadly mistaken. Incidentally, just call 1-877-917-4380 ext. 79 to talk to Jason.

First one had overheating problem They took it for 2 weeks and returned it. But its the same. Now the new one I bought again have the same problem. Now HP total care is just delaying me and not replacing it. Everytime I call they put me on hold for about 30 minutes and I give up and have to hang the phone. I don't know how to reach higher authorities. I am totally pissed off and want to know how do I report this to some consumer protection agency. I WILL NEVER EVER BUY ANY HP PRODUCT. THEY ARE JUST FOR LOOKS THEY TOTALLY SUCK and ON TOP OF THAT THEY HAVE TOTALLY USELESS TOTAL CARE. TOTAL CARE IS TOTAL CARELESS.

I spilled half a beer into it on the left side of the keyboard. Let it drain upside down and the next day it booted right up! I was shocked! The keyboard was messed up, keys were stuck. I used a USB keyboard, opened it up and removed the connection for the KB to the MB, and ordered the part from HP parts, Didn't even try to use the warranty, my fault anyway, but! I was amazed that the keyboard is designed to hold liquid and not allow into the rest of the case......................................Then........... dots showing up all over the screen, burnt pixels, I sent it to them as many have said, the returned unrepaired in the end, after 4 weeks and 2 cases later, I really loved the laptop! But their support is so horribly idiotic. I will not EVER buy another HP product just out of justice due to their poor care to the customers that make them 'what they are! I suggest buying the ext warranty from the store &quot;best buy, compUSA etc, I wish I did, I'da had a brand new laptop today and not this polka-dotted powerhouse! uHg!!!!!! BOYCOTT HP!

It is nice, yet sad, to read about so many others getting screwed by HP. My saga is now seven weeks old with no end in sight. I won't go into the nitty gritty; people don't like large bricks of text. The key points include me sending in a two month old Pavilion Media Center for repair due to excessive fan noise; HP repairing the wrong fan and sending it back; me sending it in again, only to wait two weeks before learning that my video card fan has malfunctioned, but that my specific video card is on back order. When I asked them to replace my old video card with a better video card that they actually have in stock, they told me that ALL of their video cards were on back order. HA! Two more weeks go by. I call every day. One day, they tell me, &quot;your computer is ready and you will receive it on Sep 27.&quot; On Sep 28, after no computer, of course, I am told it is not fixed and they don't know when it will be returned. After all of my excessive complaints, they arrange for me to speak with a case manager. We play phone tag for awhile. I send numerous emails listing details from my case. I finally get in contact with the case manager, only to be told that they deal strictly with American complaints, not Canadian (which I am). After more than seven weeks, I have no computer and I have no clue when I will receive my computer. The details of my story are much worse, but I'm trying to be brief. As consumers, we have the power to stop companies like HP from screwing us. Spread the word and let people know how they treat their customers. Let's see if their customer service improves when sales revenues drop to zero.

I returned the laptop still under warranty to an outsourced HP repair facility. The facility LOST the laptop. How the hell do you LOOSE a laptop in a repair facility. after round and round with their useless offshore support I finally got to a US based &quot;Customer Care&quot; division. I put customer care in quotes as that is a joke when it comes to Hp. Patrick Fletcher is my senior customer support manager. He does not return phone calls, He ignores my requests for information my situation. He did finally7 call me back 3 weeks ago to say they lost the machine and would be sending me a new upgraded model as well as paying for the rental i had to use for over TWO MONTHS so far. Once again Patrick Fletcher refuses to return my calls. Never answers his phone. As a matter of fact NO ONE at Senior Customer Support answers their phones. I have sent 2 sets of certified letters to HP senior execs and NOTHING has been done to date. This is UNBELIEVABLE LACK of customer service from a major corporation. If I ran my business like this I would expect to be closed within a week. $500.00 spent on rental laptop $22.95 spent on phone calls to HP $82.75 spent on certified Letter to Senior management at HP Getting screwed by HP PRICELESS!

I called the Tech Support guys; they said that this issue is covered under warranty and the laptop will be repaired. I sent the laptop and then received an email from the repair team that that particular issue is actually not covered. And it will cost me 444 USD to get it repaired!!! I mentioned that why did Tech Support team asked me to send the laptop at first place, if its not covered. But all that was in vain. I got my laptop back and after one week I also received an invoice of 89 USD from HP for the shipping charges of the laptop they didn't repair!! Some one tell me this, if I don't pay that amount, what will they do to me? Hang me upside down? put me in jail? what?

Nothing says, &quot;you better listen to all your disgruntled customers&quot; like CLASS ACTION. By the way, I strongly recommend that WHEN (not if) some crap component in your computer breaks, ask HP to send you the replacement part so YOU can replace it. DO NOT SEND YOUR COMPUTER INTO HP! It only results in frustration, emotional trauma and dangerously high blood pressure. End-user replacement is much less stressful and much faster. Also, if people are not comfortable replacing computer components because of a lack of expertise, just remember that HP hires only developmentally challenged lemurs to work in its repair depots, so users should have no problem replacing parts themselves. Since my video card debacle that lasted almost two months, I have replaced another video card and I'm waiting for a new hard drive.

Apparently the motherboard was defected so I phoned the HP's Famed techincal support They sincerly apologized and claimed it only happens with one out of every million or billion laptops and unfortunately that laptop had to be the one i received. They told me that they would repair and I accepted it happly until my friend pointed out what an ******* I was. He told me to demand a replacement and cancel the repair service cuz it's stupid trying to repair a new laptop. Now the nightmare begins: I phoned Hp technical support and told them of my intentions and technical support told me thats not their problem and they didn't have the power to do anything about it so they transfered me to the order status department( the transfer took 30 mins) the order department told me that it was the techical department's problem and they transfered me again(15 mins hold) the technical department told me again that it wasn't their problem and transfer me(25 mins) and the order department was about to say the same until i Blasted the agent and told her to put her superior on line and explained the situation after which he assured me that i will receive a new laptop. After 2 weeks, 60$ on phone calls(&quot;Toll Free Number&quot;) i got a new laptop. Happy ending..................no way read part2

I Phoned that lame technical support and told them what happened they ran a few tests and told me my hard drive is permanently damaged so they made a new service order and took my credit card number as a collateral.I was supposed to get a new hard drive and windows recovery Cd. The &quot;expected delivery date&quot; was 11/9/2007.They also gave me a service ticket number. So i waited....however i never received a shipment notification so i phone technical support and told them about it. They assured me that it would reach me on the due date which it didn't.I got paranoid and phoned technical support and asked them why it didn't reach me . The agent had no clue and transfered me to order and repair status department and they had no idea why it didn't reach me either. so teh agent updated the information and told me it would reach me before the 21st. I couldn't trust one agent so i emailed another agent through hp website about my problem guess what the agent told me there was a problem with my warranty status ans i had to send in my receipt to clear the problem(Which i did + i got another service ticket number) and the new delivery date was 23november. Not suprisingly it didn't arrive so i called techincal support for the hundredth time and asked them the reason for the delay which turned out to be lack of hardrives(riduculous!!!) and he assured me that it will reach me next time( new date 12/5/2007) and promised to phone me as well.The other email agent told me the same tale. I check the status today and found out that my order was all together cancelled and the agent told me the reason was That i didn't pick up the phone when they called(What an reason!!!!) and this pissed me of completely and i told him i wanted the case escalated to a case manager level) and hopefully it has been escalated. The manager is supposed to phone me tommorow(I doubt that).I wasted in total 6 hrs, 70 dollars in the whole process. Congrats HP ur the best!!!! I never use my computer for anything accept games and day to day computer works and the only reason i bought this cursed brand is becuase they had the best graphic card for the same money and the design was tempting.It was only recently that i found out that hp products suffer from serious hardware defects

Recently i found out that hp has serious hardware problems with their laptops (especially their hard drives) and their technical support consist of a bunch of self confused fools who take pleasure in making you dance in circles They fool people with their false reputation and the exterior designs of their laptop(they actually look good). Go for dell or IBM at least their laptop's don't crash the moment you get them.

I purchased a laptop, 1 1/2 years later it stopped working. Geek squad said it would be best to send it to hp. Called hp, they told me to buy an extended warrantee. When I paid for it, I was given to tech support and told it takes a month to go in effect (sure, that makes sense). They sent a box and I sent it out. 1 1/2 weeks later I got it back without a hard drive. I called 3x and was told someone would call me back and finally I got someone with a brain who ordered a hard drive. I had to call twice because it did not get sent out with the first attempt. Got the hard drive, installed it and no os. Went to install the os and the dvd would partially open only. called hp furious and demanded a new drive. While on the phone I forced open the drive and reinstalled the os. My battery refused to hold a charge. Then the lock on the batter compartment fell off. I was told by hp the battery was bad, buy another. the other did not charge either. Returned it as defective. Got another last week. Still no charge. Today I spent 2 hours calling HP demanding a supervisor and asking for immediate help. The saga continues... I will never buy another HP laptop. They should be ashamed of themselves

We have a all in one printer, that we purchased &quot;new&quot; in April of last year. When we got it home we had to return it the scanner did not work, ok so we get a new one. Now six months later the fax does not work, I called there customer service, I don't even know what country I was calling, did not understand a word they said. After we go through the whole thing, they tell me they need to replace the printer, I said ok. Asked me for a credit card number to hold, until they get the machine back, again no problem. The magic question was, I am getting a new one? Oh No! you are getting a unit that has been repaired, but works fine. Ok problem here! I told them I purchased a new one and that is what I want, they again said no. Move on speak to a manager, I got this nasty guy named George, who was a case manager, and after telling me to read my warenty, three times that it says new or like new, so I told him fine I want a new one, again no! This man did not give two ***** about how he spoke to me, I told him I wanted to speak to someone else above him, and he told me that the &quot;BUCK&quot; stops here, so if I called someone else it would go right back to him. Called customer releations, and yup, that's just what they did, he called me back, I told him agian what I wanted and he said they would not do it, and told me to have a nice day and hung up on me. This is a company that just does not seem to care how their employees treat there customers. They really need to get a check on things. I know I will never buy another HP product, and I will tell everyone that I know, what happened to me. Please anyone who reads this, remember if you buy the product and it works good, great for you, but if it doesn't, you will be getting someone else's reject that was repaired and then sent off to you! Look into a dell, or gateway, both have great customer service!

As Americans if we allow ourselves to be treated like offal by these corporate Tyrannists (Tyranny,power over others marked by cruelty and absence of justice) then are we not also ready to accept tyranny as our form of government. Think about it. Injustice is injustice, and the more numb we become to it the more we'll allow it to pervade our society, before you know it our republic will be no more.

I want to share my own HP rant with others whove experienced the horror I think the problem all started when they hired Kafka to write their customer service training manual. I bought my dv9500t off of HPs website in December 07 along with the expansion base. By the end of January, it was crashing and soon after (day or two) would stall during reboot. My final diagnosis was problem with the heat sink on the motherboard. It took longer to stall if I let it rest (cool down) for a while before trying to start up. The computer locked up even when I was on the BIOS page, so this definitely wasnt a Vista problem. After a lot of calls to HP customer (dont)care, I was able to get a case manager who told me that I was entitled to a replacement. By this time (almost 1 1/2 weeks and about 10 phone calls each lasting between 10 and 45 minutes) I was fed up with HP, and declined the replacement and asked for a full refund to which the HP case manager said I was fully entitled. He gave me a case # and his fax # and phone number with extension and his work hours. He asked me to fax over my receipts to get the refund started. He made a point of telling me that the faxes in the office tend to get lost, so I should make sure to write his name in large letters on the fax. So, I did this, and called back the next day to confirm that hed received the fax. I did call during the working hours hed given me. I provided the person who answered the phone with my case #. I was told Anthony was unavailable and he would get back to me. So, that was 2 weeks ago. Ive since called his office 5 times trying to get hold of him and each time I received the same response, hell call you later. I have asked for a new case manager to no avail. At this point, Im submitting a claim with Mastercard to see if I can recover some of the money I spent on this computer, and I will never buy another HP product again.

From the beginning I had network connection problems. After countless phone calls and many, many hours with foreign Dell techs with thick accents no one seemed to have an answer. I was put on hold constantly and promised call backs that never came. The Dell techs answer to computer issues is to dump the operating system and start over. What????? In two months they have had me dump my operating system twice. I finally got an American Dell tech who had dealt with my kind of network connection problem before. He said he had similar complaints from customers with Trend Micro security software and Vista software. He turned off the Trend Micro firewall and solved my connection issue....no dumping my operating system this time. YIPPEE! My happiness was soon dashed when I tried to use my computer and got nothing but a blue screen. After more calls to Dell Techs, constantly repeating myself and jumping through the same repeated hoops over and over again the foreign tech told me to call a Geek Squad to fix the computer.WHAT??? I told her there was no way I was spending one red cent to fix my new computer. I have a 4 year warranty I paid for. The next day an AMERICAN tech read my history with with Dell techs and sent a Dell home tech at NO charge to my home. I had to have that home Dell tech come to our house twice (so far). The first time to replace my mother board and the second time to replace my hard drive all on my NEW computer. Makes you wonder huh? When this computer is up and running smoothly (which isn't very often)I really enjoy it. Another real downer with Dell was each time I called Dell techs for help 9 times out of 10 they tried to sell me something. When I became concerned about my computer performance and Vista software and wanted to return it I was asked to be patient and work with them to solve the issues. They lead me along until my 21 days return policy was up. What a sneaky, rotten thing to do. If I keep having to deal with a faulty new computer and poor Dell techs I will seek legal help. What a consumer rip off Dell is.

Wireless card was fixed, BUT found tons of new scratches on the laptop case, and even a crack on the monitor screen! Tech support broke my monitor!!!! Called customer service, they promised they would fix the broken monitor Sent laptop back to HP again on 5/19/2008 Got it back on 5/27/2008 NOTHING was fixed, but the packing slip said LCD was replaced! LIAR!!!!! Called customer service again, again they promised they would REALLY fix the problem this time. Sent laptop back to HP on 6/2/2008 Got it back on 6/10/2008 NOTHING WAS FIXED AGAIN!! Nothing was being replaced. The crack is still on the screen, so are the scratches on the case! I could probably live with the new scratches on the case, but definitely not the crack on the monitor screen!!!! It is totally unacceptable!!!!! Before I sent my laptop to HP, it was in a likely new condition. But when I got it back, the monitor was broken and case was damaged!! It became a piece of garbage! I sent it back to HP 2 more times, both time got it back UNREPAIRED! I deeply regretted that I bought HP's product. I would never ever buy any product from this shxty company again!!! So I got a case manager the 4rd time! and he said that there was nothing he could do unless I send back my computer to get it first one last time! So I did! I sent it back on 6/18/2008, and a week later, I got a call saying that the part that they need to fix my computer is out of stock,and I have to wait till 7/19/2008! Then it happened that the Fedex people delivered my package to a wrong address!!! Someone took my computer away! I was so pissed and I contacted Fedex and ask to file a claim,but Fedex people told me HP should file it for me since HP is the sender! OK here is the best part. I call HP 1800# then the day after, I got a call from some unknown hp agent saying that I dont have to worry about anything,HP will open a case for me and as soon as they get everything they need in hand they will mail me a new computer. And that person said that he would have a case manager called me and he himself would also follow back the call to make sure that the case manager call. So I waited a whole day, nothing happened! Then I called my case manager asked him if he had talked to Fedex. And this case manager acted like he was first heard about this!!!! He said he didnt know why someone called, and said that was out of his hand! In other word, he is saying that HP is done with me!! But HP is the company that hired Fedex!!!They are the customer of Fedex, I am just a customer of HP!!! I am so fed up with HP, first they produced defective product, second they broke my monitor instead of fixing it, 3rd they sent back an unrepair item , 4th they push away the responsibility. Eventually, I called HP Guest Relation Dept,and was trying to file a complaint against the case manager. And here this woman, I dont even know whom, telling me that she knows my story! and whatever the mighty case manager told me to do is whatever HP could do with a very rude tone of voice!!!

Wireless card was fixed, BUT found tons of new scratches on the laptop case, and even a crack on the monitor screen! Tech support broke my monitor!!!! Called customer service, they promised they would fix the broken monitor Sent laptop back to HP again on 5/19/2008 Got it back on 5/27/2008 NOTHING was fixed, but the packing slip said LCD was replaced! LIAR!!!!! Called customer service again, again they promised they would REALLY fix the problem this time. Sent laptop back to HP on 6/2/2008 Got it back on 6/10/2008 NOTHING WAS FIXED AGAIN!! Nothing was being replaced. The crack is still on the screen, so are the scratches on the case! I could probably live with the new scratches on the case, but definitely not the crack on the monitor screen!!!! It is totally unacceptable!!!!! Before I sent my laptop to HP, it was in a likely new condition. But when I got it back, the monitor was broken and case was damaged!! It became a piece of garbage! I sent it back to HP 2 more times, both time got it back UNREPAIRED! I deeply regretted that I bought HP's product. I would never ever buy any product from this shxty company again!!! So I got a case manager the 4rd time! and he said that there was nothing he could do unless I send back my computer to get it first one last time! So I did! I sent it back on 6/18/2008, and a week later, I got a call saying that the part that they need to fix my computer is out of stock,and I have to wait till 7/19/2008! Then it happened that the Fedex people delivered my package to a wrong address!!! Someone took my computer away! I was so pissed and I contacted Fedex and ask to file a claim,but Fedex people told me HP should file it for me since HP is the sender! OK here is the best part. I call HP 1800# then the day after, I got a call from some unknown hp agent saying that I dont have to worry about anything,HP will open a case for me and as soon as they get everything they need in hand they will mail me a new computer. And that person said that he would have a case manager called me and he himself would also follow back the call to make sure that the case manager call. So I waited a whole day, nothing happened! Then I called my case manager asked him if he had talked to Fedex. And this case manager acted like he was first heard about this!!!! He said he didnt know why someone called, and said that was out of his hand! In other word, he is saying that HP is done with me!! But HP is the company that hired Fedex!!!They are the customer of Fedex, I am just a customer of HP!!! I am so fed up with HP, first they produced defective product, second they broke my monitor instead of fixing it, 3rd they sent back an unrepair item , 4th they push away the responsibility. Eventually, I called HP Guest Relation Dept,and was trying to file a complaint against the case manager. And here this woman, I dont even know whom, telling me that she knows my story! and whatever the mighty case manager told me to do is whatever HP could do with a very rude tone of voice!!! HP HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE, THE WORST REPAIR SHOP, THE MOST USELESS CASE MANAGER, THE RUDEST GUEST RELATION PEOPLE WORK FOR THEM! LONG LIVE HP!!

The Tech Support they provide out of Malaysia is horrendous (talk about offshoring gone bad). One of their Tech support reps had me restore my HP Pavilion back to the original settings without explaining what he was doing or the ramifications of that action (wiped out my entire hard drive). This damaged the ahrd drive and I then had to call them on 4 different occasions to get a replacement hard drive -- each call lasting at least 1 hour 30 minutes due to all the wait time. Do yourself a favor; learn from my experiences and NEVER buy HP. -Ken

My 4-month-old HP Pavillion a6357c had had sporadic booting problems until it completely died yesterday. Wouldn't go beyond blue screen of death. I spent hours on the phone with their offshore tech support and went through 4 technicians. They were apparently under-trained. All they knew was to to wipe out the whole system. When that didn't work, they wanted me to send it back to have the motherboard replaced. One of the tech support people was very rude in addition to being incompetent. The rest were only incompetent. One would expect a $1,000 product to live longer.

Te computer was taken out of the box and run for the first time Dec 25, 2007. Fine as kind, got to college with it and only 2 months down the road, it was working fine before I went to class that day, came back an hour later boom my keyboard and all the control buttons except the power button wouldn't work having to type up reports is a must so i spent the day restoring my laptop hoping it was just some software glitch, wrong, so I had to shell out 30 for a external keyboard, I already had an external mouse handy, I couldnt afford another new laptop or rental to hold me over at that time. I get out of University in late April, I took it to my local dealer to be shipped away for repair on May 3, 2008. Dont hear anything for over a month. I call to get an update, hp using the old tricks, parts shortage, its lost, etc. I'm patient, so I wait another 2 weeks, and they claim its been over an accepted period of time so they claim they will refund my money, I say good, so I bought a toshiba, a few days later I get a call from the local dealer telling me he recieved my old laptop and that when he called to find out what was going on they told him its been fixed, no refund check is comming. I tell him ship it back and demand a refund, as of late July, 2008 I have yet to see a check from hp, and am losing hope that I ever will which means 800 down the drain and no laptop to show for it, never again will I ever purchase an hp product for the rest of my life. I suggest all you readers do the same.

I downgraded one machine to XP, and it is somewhat stable and operational. Yes, I had to pay for a copy of XP, so I could have the &quot;genuine&quot; Microsoft product. The Vista based machine shuts itself off periodically and is basically dead in the water. No, I am not a computer technician and do not have the time to become one. I expected these machines to work properly without a degree from M.I.T. I am so incredibly angry at the computer industry right now. Microsoft sold me a bill of goods for sure. HP was definitely in bed with them. I will never buy another HP product again. Trying to get support for these machines is impossible. I guess I could pay for it. And, I can get rid of all my old software and upgrade to Vista and pay thousands of dollars for new software. It's all about their bottom line. They want to sell service contracts. Well, if the machines don't work, what a great way to do that! I also saw Microsoft's counter-ads showing a blind test of Vista and people loving it when they looked at it with an open mind. Did they look at it with an open checkbook too? And, did they try to operate the system absent the person standing there telling them what to do? So, it goes on and on. These two giant corporations continue not to own up to the greedy self-serving policies that they have adopted the rip off their customers. I don't trust them. They lie and refuse to take responsibility for their actions. Then, they launch ad campaigns (propaganda) to try to make us believe that we were simply mistaken. Without using a great number of unacceptable words, it is not possible to express my anger in this post. What a scam!

Went to shop due to power plug problems in 2005. Graphics started going out in 2005. Lines due to the overheating problem that they &quot;don't have&quot;. Called them. They said out of warranty...sorry. 2005 bought a DELL. ZD7000 became a paperweight. Got lawsuit papers in 2007 for the ZD7000 class action due to the overheating problem that they &quot;don't have&quot;. Fixed after settlement in 6-2008. Became ZD7000A. 8-11-2008.... graphics problem again. The line thing again. Called HP to get hung up on. I was nice. DELL still going strong. Goodbye HP. I will never buy anything even remotely associated with you, nor will I ever have anything good to say about your shoddy products. Good riddance. I was looking up at the top of the page at a HP banner It says &quot;SLEEK. SMART. SIMPLE.&quot; They forgot &quot;SCAM.&quot;

I called about a problem I was having with their Personal Media Drive that I bought for the HP computer I bought. I had already prepared for the brainless customer service I would get because I had spoke to these same dummies in the past. Well I can say that HP service was even worst than in the past. This hard drive was less than three months old, and was causing my computer to crash. I had to explain the problem I was having with three different reps, and was on the phone for three hours. I ask to speak with a supervisor, and his response to my problem was to tell me I should pay to back up the files on my hard drive, and then I should reformat the drive. He just kept saying, &quot;I understand your concern,&quot; but he was not listening to me. He then told me to save my files to my drive in my computer. I asked him if I have a virus on the drive why would I move it to the computer internal drive. He had no response. I am going to end up having to pay out of my pocket to pay to fix whatever problem I am having when I am still under warranty. HP SUCKS BIG TIME. I HOPE THIS COMPANY FAILS IN THE CREDIT CRISIS. DIE HP DIE!!!!!!!!

In the first two weeks of using my new computer I had to dump everything and start over three times (according to the Dell techs). UGH! Dell finally sent a tech to my home, which helped a bit. I still cannot chat with my yahoo group nor do I have a working spell check. I feel all of us who were suckered into buying Vista is due a refund check. What a customer rip off.
5218	223	112547	2869201	2867239	daglow	9/28/08 12:35 PM	1.2226053E12	Get in line	I have read a lot of the post about HP being a &quot;BAD&quot; company. For the most part, a lot of information is left out, like data recovery--very few companies guarantee YOuR data. You hard drive fails, and YOU did not back up, youre out of luck. However, the warrantee on your computer should fix mechanical problems, like defective parts and software problems that are caused by defective parts, not your ITunes, or downloaded software or viral infected pc. Lastly, if you don't want to wait the 30 to 90 days for your computer to be kinda repaired-- 1. Buy local because it is going to break. Just like your cell phone or car. 2. Get as much warranty as you can afford. Some laptops/Desktops have a global warranty and your choice of whether to bring it in or have someone come out to you. (I prefer bringing it in) Ask the salesperson a question like: &quot;If I leave my computer sitting on top of my car and drive away and it smashes do I get it replaced for free in 3 days or less?&quot; 3. Buying your computer over the internet is convenient but the mail person is handling your expensive cargo (with great respect to USPS) and may drop it a few times before it gets to you. See number 1. And 2. Yes, I have called tech support---a. waiting on hold--- b. can't understand what the person is saying--, c. two hours to make them understand that they sent me the wrong part......90% of it is to weed out the criminal element with is bad for decent people...
5218	224	112547	2869414	1475468	In-Correct	9/28/08 9:08 PM	1.22263608E12	HP:	The reason why Dell is selling so many computers is because many of them are very basic and not many people are able or willing to pay a lot for computers. I recommend HP...or Compaq. Lots of machines have built in memory card readers now, but back in 2004 those two were the only ones I could find that had those features. Now my ViewSonic monitor has that!! So I think that device is more available now. But I am surprised that my Compaq has lasted this long. I think I will someday just keep the case (and internal memory card readers) and replace the motherboard and processor eventually whenever that might be needed... I would be careful with Dell. They sell a lot of basic machines. I think they even sell cash registers. They sell printers but they just stick their name on them. I do not recommend Dell printers at all. (I recommend Samsung). But some Dells have more features and performance and upgradability than others. And I do know that Dell has numerous USB connetions. Mine originally has 4 in back and 3 in front. But I think Dells have 9 or 10 in back. And more can be added with PCI Cards.

The ability to be able to afford all the modern gadgets and at such a cheap and affordable price should not be taken for granted. Instead consider yourself lucky and enjoy it while it lasts. People in 3rd world countries who build these systems, can't even afford these systems. I have seen people who call countries like India and cuss the techs on the phone. WE Americans have serious attitude problems, where-in we think that the whole world has to talk to us in our language. Unfortunately, we can't even understand the English that other people are talking to us (so what is the accent is not American, it is still English). Enjoy the progress, the money, the superpower status, the financial might.....but remember, everything that goes up also comes down....It's just the law of nature. From my experience....Indian techs are extremely knowledgeable and helpful...except for the american communication barrier.

The very short version of a very long story: my computer arrived and had problems day 2. an HP rep had me wipe out both hard drives then dissapeared. one tried to charge me for restoration disks until i made a stink about it then grudgingly sent them....then dissapeared. the next rep i got helped me install them and was told i was going cross country for 2 weeks and because i had no time to test it said if it still was problematic i could return even if past the return period(boy i wish i had access to their phone recordings!) lo and behold one hard drive failed completely a few days after my return. i then asked to return for refund and then was told we never said you could do that. the second hard drive then started developing problems causing the unit to freeze every 30 minutes to an hour or so. i then tried fighting them with an AMEx chargeback of which they fought me tooth and nail along the way with AMEX somehow siding with HP based on a few untruths of theirs, tisk tisk. I got an AMEx letter stating that i could not return, not have my money back but according to what HP told AMEX i could get a return label and a free fix. i then tried calling HP and not only got a rep in INDIA but he made every excuse to make the caLL OVER 2 HOURS IN WHICH HE DID NOTHING NEW.....and i got nowhere. they are theives plain and simple. i am now thinking possible court action. if you are reading this do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY HP! HP remember this, the bigger you are the harder you fall! help me howard??????
