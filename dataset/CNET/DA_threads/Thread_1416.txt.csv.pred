1.1.1	Hi there , I have a AM2 system as follows : Asus M2V Mobo 2GB Corsiar DDR2667 RAM in Dual-channel , AMD Athlon X2 4200+ Processor Nvidia GeForce 7300GS Graphics card I am wondering about what to get for my new upgrade : Vista Home Premium , Or a DX10 8600GT graphics card ( cause my frame rate are real bad in Oblivion ) Thanks in advance Cheers , Kelly	St
1.2.1	Your choices are real optionable , the OS being the more so .	St
1.2.2	If you install the video card in with your known healthy psu , you will see benefits .	St
1.2.3	As for the Prem .	St
1.2.4	OS , it will only provide some better OS options that has nothing to do with game play , other than DX10 ( if required ) .	St
1.2.5	If you 're running Vista now , then expect similar OS results .	St
1.2.6	You can boost the ram beyond 2gb , IMHO would be better .	St
1.2.7	For far better or intense deep info , then find a gaming forums , etc .	St
1.2.8	or modding websites that provide links for same and see what they have to say .	St
1.2.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	If you get the 8600 video card it well run fine for Windows XP and most of the newer games .	St
1.3.2	At least until the end of the year .	St
1.3.3	I assume you want to play games .	St
1.3.4	The 8600 is n't that great of card .	St
1.3.5	I would get at least a 8800 320 card if you can .	St
1.3.6	( I got one ) .	St
1.3.7	This would have more long term use .	St
1.3.8	If you get Vista Home , Then you have a nice new OS , but you would n't get the full experince with it .	St
1.3.9	It probably would run slow anyways and you would regret doing it .	St
1.3.10	I would get a 8800 320 now ( you can find rebates for it all over ) .	St
1.3.11	Get ready to build a whole new computer and then get Vista then .	St
1.3.12	( Build the computer to support vista ) .	St
1.3.13	The other guy suggested more RAM .	St
1.3.14	But you could only go up to like 3.2gb total of ram with 32 bit OS .	St
1.3.15	So I do n't see that being worth it now .	St
1.4.1	2GB of RAM is flawless for modern systems , even with Vista , and the rest of your system seems to be decent , I 'd go for the graphics card , the 8800 is IN NO WAY required , marketing and nVidia will tell us that you ca n't game without 8800 SLI , specialist press , years of experience , and other proof will tell us that a 7600GT is easily sufficient for modern games and an 8600GT is even better I 'd go with the 8600 for two reasons : A ) Vista will slow slow your ( any ) computer down compared to Windows XP , because Vista uses more resources , not to mention Vista 's known issues with , oh , about every software application in the known universe that is n't from Microsoft , and even some that are from Microsoft B ) the 8600 will be a large performance jump from your 7300 , and will match nicely with your X2 4200 and other hardware ( it 'll achieve a balance , performance/price wise , which will give you a better experience from the system ) .	St
1.4.2	I 'd look for the 8600 online , should be able to be had for around $ 110- $ 130 , other considerations , graphics card wise : Radeon HD 2600Pro Radeon HD 2600XT GeForce 8600GTS they 're all in roughly the same performance arena , all DX10 , the reason I bring up the Radeons is because of HIS and MSI ( board vendors ) putting two slot cooling solutions on those boards , while the 8600 series is generally regarded as faster ( by a few % here and there ) than the HD 2600 series , the HD 2600 series is available with better stock cooling , which is always a plus ( and it doesnt add $ 20- $ 30 to the price like aftermarket would add to an 8600 )	St
1.5.1	And for what it 's worth ... whatever $ $ you spend on the GPU you can carry forward to a new system ... not so with more RAM or better CPU .	St
1.5.2	Your RIG is OK but weak for gaming because of the GPU .	St
1.5.3	Go to Tomshardware.com and see what fits your need and your budget .	St
1.5.4	VAPCMD	St
