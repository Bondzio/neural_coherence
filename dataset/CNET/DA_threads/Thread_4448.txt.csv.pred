1.1.1	I have a fibre optic DSL connection and several computers on a home network .	St
1.1.2	My wife is not interested in learning how not to avoid malware and principally uses an WXP Home computer , but she also does banking on her Apple Mac Mini .	St
1.1.3	I would like to isolate the Mac Mini and my linux computer from the wired/wifi network that we now use .	St
1.1.4	( BTW we are out in the countryside and the WiFi is unlikely to be problematic ) .	St
1.1.5	I was thinking about putting a D-Link DI-604 router behind one of the wired ports on the existing Zyxel P330W v2 wifi router .	St
1.1.6	The idea is that wife , kids , and guests can browse , hopefully not getting infected , but in any case isolated from the D-Link network behind .	St
1.1.7	I can imagine the possiblity a sniffer getting installed on the Zyxel network which might then be able to monitor traffic from/to the D-Link network as it passes through the Zyxel .	St
1.1.8	Would such a sniffer be able to monitor the Zyxel traffic or is the latter encrypted or otherwise unsniffable as it leaves the D-Link and passes through the Zyxel ?	Ques
1.1.9	Alternatively , is there a way for the two routers to sit side by side and somehow share the DSL connection without being reachable by the other , say if a switch sat in front of the routers ( do n't know if a switch with divide traffic in this way or not ) So , are either of these a good approach and if not , why ?	Ques
1.1.10	TIA	St
1.2.1	The setup to do with with routers and more will tax owners too harshly .	St
1.2.2	Let 's call the answer out as & quot ; install a firewall. & quot ; Bob	St
1.3.1	Bob , thanks , but I do not understand your comments .	Polite
1.3.2	Could you elaborate on both please ?	Ques
1.4.1	& quot ; The setup to do with with routers and more will tax owners too harshly. & quot ; The poor wording here is a problem .	St
1.4.2	But the setup with routing , how to administer this so that it all works is just too tedious and taxing for most of us .	St
1.4.3	This is why I wrote in my next sentence : - & gt ; Let 's call the answer out as & quot ; install a firewall. & quot ; Almost every firewall has a setting to not allow sharing , etc .	St
