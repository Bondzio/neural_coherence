while it may look like a 400% performance increase with new technology and what not, the Q6600 is essentially two Core 2 Duos bolted together, its a multi-core module, which means its tech is IDENTICAL to the Core 2 Duo furthermore, a guy named Gene Amdahl gave us Amdahl's law which defines scalability of an application mathematically, and shows us that 4 cores WILL NEVER realistically = a 4x performance increase: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl 's_law with that said, the Core 2 Duo is just as good for gaming if money is an issue, although the quad core isn't a bad buy, i just wanted to put some facts straight in the thread if people were using it as a reference
