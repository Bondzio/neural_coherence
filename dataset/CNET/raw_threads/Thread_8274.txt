I have INTEL 945GCPE, CORE2DUO, 1GB RAM(667Mhz) configured machine 1 year ago, i have purchased 2gb(800mhz) for my pc. I am not able to use those 2 rams at a time. I read in Intel site that my motherboard supports only 667mhz ram. This thing i came to know after purchasing it. Before inserting i was able to play blu-ray videos without any problems. Now with 2GB RAM(800mhz) i am not able to play blu-rays properly and even games also. Please suggest me on this.**

I've lost count of folk that buy generic ram and it fails. Then they launch discussions and want to know why it doesn't work. -&gt; Keep in mind that finding out why it doesn't work has never found a cure. It only clarifies the memory was incompatible because _____? The Core 2 Duo also can use dual channel memory so this again points to a configuration error. I suggest you return the incompatible ram and do more research and next time, Crucial.com Bob
