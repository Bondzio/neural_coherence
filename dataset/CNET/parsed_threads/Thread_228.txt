<s> Hi, I'm experienced on home computing, but have no experience with laptops or internet while traveling, so I have a bunch of questions. </s>
<s> I'm going to be doing a lot of RV and auto traveling all over the U.S. </s>
<s> So I want to purchase a good laptop and be able to have the internet as much as possible. </s>
<s> So the first question is: Any recommendations as far as good laptops for a person who travels a lot. </s>
<s> (I could probably spend up to $2,000 without the DW getting too wild!) </s>
<s> What should I make sure I have in my laptop to be able to connect with the internet wherever I am? </s>
<s> My cellphone contract is almost due, and I've read some articles about getting a digital cellphone and using that as an access to the internet. </s>
<s> Good idea or not? </s>
<s> Any company have better plans and service than others? </s>
<s> What do I need to know so I don't get talked into buying unnecessary plans, equipment, etc? </s>
<s> We will be staying in hotels sometimes, the RV other times. </s>
<s> What would I want to have in my laptop so I could access any free internet available. </s>
<s> I've read some stuff about wifi hotspots and hotels having rj45 jacks, etc, but I guess I'm at the point now where I've read so much that I am just overwhelmed with information. </s>
<s> Any ideas what would you do in my situation? </s>
<s> I am also going to be using the laptop at home (Wisconsin/Arizona), so I'd like to know a simple(if possible) way to be able to somehow use my home internet service with both my home pc and my laptop. </s>
<s> I have Charter cable internet service at home. </s>
<s> Windows xp home edition. </s>
<s> Also, I'm experienced with xp and I really like it. </s>
<s> Should I get a laptop with xp, or vista? </s>
<s> I know it's a lot ground to cover, but like I said, I'm a newbie at the whole laptop traveling thing, so I'd really appreciate any help. </s>
<s> Is there a website that explains all this? </s>
<s> Maybe a FAQ? </s>
<s> Thanks a lot in advance, Eddie </s>
<s> All laptops are pretty much created equal with the exceptions of bells and whistles. </s>
<s> I own two IBM ThinkPads and wouldn't use any other brand. </s>
<s> They are built like a tank and the IBM support is second to none. </s>
<s> Don't use the cell phone as your connection. </s>
<s> The speed is slow and expensive. </s>
<s> Most hotels today have wired and wireless Internet access and is free. </s>
<s> When I've traveled I've even pulled into a hotel parking lot, fired up my ThinkPad , it found the network and I surfed. </s>
<s> As far as staying in a room, your choice for wired or wireless. </s>
<s> To use your ISP in two locations you need to call them and see what they offer and where. </s>
<s> Stay with XP. </s>
<s> Vista is a hog. </s>
<s> Wayne Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about analog and digital data, internet connections, spyware removal, and download free software. </s>
<s> 5 dB hot. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> Like I said though, I will be all over and will probably be in many areas without wifi or hotel internet. </s>
<s> What would you do in that situation? </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> Eddie </s>
<s> Go through withdrawal. </s>
<s> You might consider one of the low cost or free dial-up services. </s>
<s> Do a Google on free internet. </s>
<s> You can try the service that Verizon wireless has. </s>
<s> See the link below. </s>
<s> Check the coverage map and see if the coverage would be good for you. </s>
<s> It is similar to cell coverage. </s>
<s> Also the price is a bit steep if you ask me, but it may be just what you need. </s>
