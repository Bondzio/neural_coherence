<s> I have a PNY Technologies Verto nVidia GeForce FX 5200 AGP 128mb DDR Graphics Card (which I got off a clearance table) Which I've installed into my IBM Intellistation 6866-40U with the latest Bios PFJT48AUS running Windows 2000 Pro The configuration program, (which has little documentation available) for CMOS setup on the Intellistation for video, asks about &quot;Active Video Memory&quot; and another question about &quot;Video Aperture&quot; I don't know what is meant by Video Aperture and can find no reference to it that makes sense on either IBMs or PNY's support websites. </s>
<s> I've tried a couple of configurations but CMOS recognizes the card as 4X instead of 8X (Close but not correct) as PNY Technologies has discontinued this card - I'm having difficulty locating the most current set of drivers for the graphics card - They do have a driver archive but that archive goes by version numbers - I'm unable to locate what the proper version I need for the most current driver set for this particular card beyond the disc that came with the card. </s>
<s> nVidia makes the chip set for the AGP card, but defers all support questions back to the card manufacturer. </s>
<s> The chipset from what I could google seems to point to that's it's max AGP speed. </s>
<s> 2. google.com has plenty to read about that BIOS setting. </s>
<s> I don't duplicate web content but note that the BIOS default is often just fine. </s>
