1.1.1	Hello everyone : My first post on this forum .	St
1.1.2	In the Nov. issue of PC Mag on pages 106 & 107 there is an ad for a new hardware device called & quot ; iPhantom & quot ; offered by Phantom Technologies , { www.iphantom.com } .	St
1.1.3	It supposedly protects your network and pc against viruses , adware , spyware , network intrusion and identity theft while allowing you to surf anonymously over an encrypted link by providing a hardware firewall between your broadband modem and your router or pc .	St
1.1.4	Has anybody purchased one of these devices or seen any evaluation wriiten or broadcast anywhere ?	Ques
1.1.5	If this device functions as they claim it could easily solve alot of our internet security concerns .	St
1.1.6	I have no connection with this company , I 'm just tired of fighting malware and intrusion attempts on my pc 's , friends pc 's , family pc 's etc .	St
1.1.7	Is this the answer ?	Ques
1.1.8	Pete	St
1.2.1	The anonymous surfing claim is doubtful to an outright lie .	St
1.2.2	It 's not unlike snail mail delivery to your home but you 're removed the home 's address and mailbox .	St
1.2.3	This only works if some other address proxies the request and forwards the data back to you .	St
1.2.4	If what you posted is all there is , the product is to be avoided like the plague .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	The iPhantom does pass your data through remote gateways in order to protect you identity on the Internet .	St
1.3.2	Rob , you 're right to say this is necessary for this to happen in order to get that kind of protection .	St
1.3.3	I am very happy with the service .	St
1.3.4	Basically , what you are getting is gateway protection ( virus scanning , adware/spyware scanning , network intrusion , etc ) for a fraction of the cost .	St
1.3.5	On top of this , all of the data between yourself and the gateways is encrypted to protect the information entering and leaving the network .	St
1.3.6	Even if I were to set up gateway antivirus protection ( which is expensive if it works ) , I would n't get the encryption .	St
1.3.7	I 've talked to the guys there and they are very friendly and helpful .	St
1.3.8	The explained that they are running a lightweight UDP protocol and using standard 256-bit AES encryption .	St
1.3.9	The setup was easy and its been working flawlessly .	St
1.3.10	Sometimes I ca n't even tell it is there .	St
1.3.11	From what I 've seen and heard , this company is legit .	St
1.3.12	I heard about them from Leo .	St
1.3.13	I was in the same boat as you Rob initially .	St
1.3.14	There are a lot of standard firewalls that claim privacy just by using NAT ( sure you get a private address from NAT , but that has nothing to do with privacy on the net ) .	St
1.3.15	However , I am very happy with this device .	St
1.4.1	Hey Hawk , I did not purchase one until I heard more people that used it .	St
1.4.2	I heard it on Leo Laporte show on am 640 in L.A. and also on his security now podcast .	St
1.4.3	This device is like what large companies run but on a smaller scale and user friendly .	St
1.4.4	google leo laporte iphantom and you should find his review .	Sug
1.4.5	I am using it and to be honest , it really does work .	St
1.4.6	Peace of mind is what you are paying for and it does annonymize me .	St
1.4.7	They have a 30 day money back guarenty so you have nothing to lose .	St
1.4.8	Most people knocked it before trying it .	St
1.4.9	It did slow my connection about 10 % but thats nothing considering I am still pushing 3 MB compared to the useless annonymizer which was barely usable .	St
1.4.10	I does not get in the way of any of my programs either .	St
1.4.11	To be honest , you forget its there .	St
1.4.12	The tech support is really knows their stuff .	St
1.5.1	Your requests are to another gateway , but still pass through your ISP and as such the information is loggable there .	St
1.5.2	If you 've been following the fallout of the Patriot Act , you know the ISPs have only some months to install these devices on their networks .	St
1.5.3	You are paying for something that does not work as well as you wish .	St
1.5.4	Only the sites see the proxy address , but the ISP sees the real request .	St
1.5.5	Please think this over .	St
1.5.6	Cheers , Bob	St
1.6.1	Bob , I think you missed the encryption portion .	St
1.6.2	The iPhantom uses AES encryption to encrypt all of the data between the iPhantom and the Gateways .	St
1.6.3	This would prevent any logging by the ISP unless they can decrypt 256-bit AES encryption .	St
1.6.4	I do n't see why you would think this is a sham .	St
1.7.1	And the powers that be will decrypt such content .	St
1.7.2	It is not bullet proof .	St
1.7.3	Also the proxied site is simply tapped for it 's ins and outs .	St
1.7.4	Have you researched what fallout there is from the Patriot Act and the new wiretap provisions that ISPs must provide ?	Ques
1.7.5	With all this , I applaud their marketing of the product but as you pull back the curtain it all seems to fall apart .	St
1.7.6	Cheers , bob	St
1.8.1	I still think you are missing the point .	St
1.8.2	Besides the encryption , the iPhantom provides the easiest gateway antivirus , spyware , adware , network intrusion prevention that I have ever used .	St
1.8.3	Coupling it with my software antivirus gives me all around protection .	St
1.8.4	As far as the encryption part , I know from talking to them that each device is programmed with a unique key .	St
1.8.5	Besides making my data private , it keeps data sniffers and other people from communicating directly with my broadband connection .	St
1.8.6	And they manage all of that for me .	St
1.8.7	If you look at the big picutre , it is worth it .	St
1.8.8	If you 've ever dealt with gateway protection ( antivirus , etc . )	St
1.8.9	you 'd know its expensive and can be complicated .	St
1.8.10	I do network security administration and at first was skeptical like you were .	St
1.8.11	I tried it and was happy to find that it actually works .	St
1.9.1	As a designer of embedded electronics of the cellular type equipment , our US Gov does n't allow marketing of products they ca n't tap into or decode .	St
1.9.2	Your faith in these products shows how good the marketing is .	St
1.9.3	My design background in the telecom work has me thinking what a good job they did .	St
1.9.4	Cheers , bob	St
1.10.1	I do n't know if you read the entire previous post , I was talking about the other aspects of the product and how the encryption is a vital part of it .	St
1.10.2	Using encryption between your connection and their gateways provides a prefiltered line that has all of the gateway security applied to it .	St
1.10.3	This prevents anyone from communicating directly with your network connection and allows you to get gateway antivirus , spyware , intrusion protection , etc without all of the hassles with a simple setup .	St
1.10.4	I still do n't see how you can claim that this does n't make sense especially if you do design in the networking related field .	St
1.10.5	I can tell from your original posts that you had n't even looked at the product based on what you posted .	St
1.10.6	Giving advice on something you have n't researched is misleading and is the opposite of helpful for people looking for information .	St
1.10.7	I guess we can go back and forth on this , but having managed gateway protection at the price they offer is a great deal as I know what this costs .	St
1.11.1	You missed my point entirely .	St
1.11.2	The US Gov forbids products from our markets .	St
1.11.3	I 'm sure you 'd understand once you are in the business .	St
1.11.4	The product will lock out the masses , but not our gov .	St
1.11.5	Your advice is incomplete here and shows you do n't know what the feds require in the comm ' world .	St
1.11.6	Bob	St
1.12.1	I am a network administrator in the business .	St
1.12.2	My argument for the last few posts had to do with network security ( gateway antivirus protection , antispyware , network intrusion protection , etc . )	St
1.12.3	What does this have to do with the Federal Gov ?	Ques
1.12.4	The only thing it does have to do with them is that they use similar protection on their networks as do large companies for a high price .	St
1.12.5	There are other companies , like Prolexic , that provide similar types of service but for thousands of dollars .	St
1.12.6	The concept has been extended for the SMB and home .	St
1.12.7	As far as probing and tapping goes , I 'd rather have an encrypted connection than nothing at all .	St
1.13.1	The P2P users love these devices since they feel it will sheild them .	St
1.13.2	Oops , it just moved them higher on the radar and may have enabled easier taps for the ones that would be interested in such .	St
1.13.3	Bob	St
1.14.1	I just noticed all the back and forth on this topic .	St
1.14.2	I noticed BOB that rjla has a good point .	St
1.14.3	You DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING about this product but you are quick to judge .	St
1.14.4	I too was a skeptic but as rjla noted its about more than just the anonymous portion , its about keeping the line CLEAN .	St
1.14.5	Also , what do you recommend regarding the anonymous portion .	Ques
1.14.6	You talk about the gov .	St
1.14.7	and laws so that I can only assume you have a law degree or are just another conspiracy theorist .	St
1.14.8	The man is watching .	St
1.14.9	What are you using now to be anonymous , nothing .	St
1.14.10	I assume using something to be anonymous is better than nothing even if , as you claim , the gov .	St
1.14.11	can eventually gain access to it .	St
1.14.12	Using your logic , if the gov can gain access to encrypted packets then using nothing is the worst thing you can do because the gov .	St
1.14.13	does'nt even have to lift a finger to monitor you .	St
1.14.14	Let me know how you solve this problem .	St
1.14.15	ALSO , why all this gov .	St
1.14.16	fear .	St
1.14.17	The anonymous portion also prevents from non-gov from looking in like your ISP , RIAA , etc .	St
1.14.18	Are these not something to worry about .	St
1.14.19	I worry about these before the government or better yet , forget the gov .	St
1.14.20	as we all know who they work for ...	St
1.14.21	THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE	St
1.15.1	I just do n't see how you can claim that the only purpose of a device like this is to be anonymous .	St
1.15.2	I know other businesses using it besides myself .	St
1.15.3	And no one on their network or mine download anything on P2P .	St
1.15.4	No matter what I say , you like to circle around to conspiracy theory and 1 aspect of the device .	St
1.15.5	There is much more to it than P2P downloading .	St
1.15.6	I just do n't think you 'll ever understand that .	St
1.16.1	Part of the fallout from the Patriot Act is a clause to allow remote wiretaps ( or monitoring ) of internet connections at ISPs and & quot ; access providers. & quot ; This has caused a problem for libraries , universities whose routers and such do n't have the needed taps for out government .	St
1.16.2	Here 's why .	St
1.16.3	It 's the money .	St
1.16.4	While it 's a government mandate to provide the tap points there was no provision that the goverment would pay for retrofitting or changeout of the old equipment .	St
1.16.5	Your device is not as secure as you think since your provider has to provide these taps .	St
1.16.6	The same issues caused delays in digatal cell phone rollouts .	St
1.16.7	Before they could just tap the analog lines .	St
1.16.8	Now we not only have to design in the taps but allow taps via remote access .	St
1.16.9	This is not theory but reality .	St
1.16.10	Bob	St
1.17.1	Bob , as they said earlier in a post .	St
1.17.2	I do not think you read the post but just reply .	St
1.17.3	I do not know if it is because that is the only answer you can give .	St
1.17.4	I just finished stating that the gov .	St
1.17.5	is not who I really care about .	St
1.17.6	Most people are not doing anything so grave that they are worried about the gov .	St
1.17.7	The RIAA and is not the GOV .	St
1.17.8	They do not have the power to tap lines nor do I believe the gov .	St
1.17.9	will give them access to tap because they feel someone is violating them .	St
1.17.10	What is with this gov .	St
1.17.11	tie up .	St
1.17.12	Give up the gov .	St
1.17.13	comments .	St
1.17.14	Why do you not comment or give credit to the products full potential and give up the gov .	Ques
1.17.15	hang up .	St
1.17.16	Forget the whole anonymous thing and let me know what you think about the product as a network device regarding the antivirus , spyware , etc and its ease of use .	St
1.17.17	This in my opinion is worth every penny .	St
1.17.18	No hassle if my kid antivirus is up to date and the no brainer set is awesome .	St
1.18.1	It 's not bad stuff .	St
1.18.2	But with my experience of people bringing those pests ( and rootkits ) in on CDs and more , maybe this plus a total lockdown is the answer ?	Ques
1.18.3	Bob	St
1.19.1	http : //news.cbsi.com/Study+Security+flaw+allows+wiretap+evasion/2100-1036_3-5976523.html writes : & quot ; Under a 1994 law known as the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act , telephone service providers must offer law enforcement agencies the ability to wiretap digital networks. & quot ; Be sure to follow this lead to other laws that require your ISP and the services you connect to , to provide not only telephone service taps but remotely monitor the service provider 's networks .	St
1.19.2	If anyone thinks this box will shield their activies ... Bob	St
1.20.1	Lets face it Bob , of course you must let the law tap the line if they request it .	St
1.20.2	They are not monitoring all lines at all times .	St
1.20.3	What is being said here is that the everyday guy is protected .	St
1.20.4	If you are the mafia , or a online psyco , then this is some protection .	St
1.20.5	Most of us do not fall in this extreme catagory .	St
1.20.6	Most are like myself , being encrypted protects against others besides the law .	St
1.20.7	Its protects you when you go to a hotel and plug into that network .	St
1.20.8	Things like that .	St
1.20.9	If you are being monitored by the police , tapping you internet line is the least of you worries and definatly not going to be the only thing they are listening in on .	St
1.20.10	They would have tapped your cell , home phone , work , bank account , etc .	St
1.20.11	This idea you have that this is going to get you caught it just out there .	St
1.20.12	Lets face it , these guys have a good product , good support , nothing out there that I have seen at even close the price .	St
1.20.13	Can you get over your negativity and agree that its a good device .	St
1.20.14	Again , what do you suggest ?	Ques
1.21.1	BOB , you are suggesting that because this does not protect against viruses brought in by a cd that it is over kill ?	Ques
1.21.2	What planet are you on .	St
1.21.3	Did you ever think this PLUS a software antivirus is key .	St
1.21.4	Is this not what is done at almost every large corporation .	St
1.21.5	Total lock down ?	Ques
1.21.6	YES , do all you can to prevent .	St
1.21.7	Your mentality is so far out , you suggest that to much protection is lock down .	St
1.21.8	Remember , you should already have software antivirus , this is seemless and run on the back end with no software .	St
1.21.9	WHY NOT .	St
1.21.10	Bob , you just have nothing better so say .	St
1.21.11	You have not recommended something better than a combination of software and hardware antivirus .	St
1.21.12	All you can say is the sky is falling .	St
1.21.13	Do you just do this to post something to remain as a moderator as you have no suggestions ?	Ques
1.22.1	That sums it up for me .	St
1.22.2	However , any other Mac/Linux/PC box can do this so it 's not a product exclusive .	St
1.22.3	I 'll admit their marketing is good .	St
1.22.4	Bob	St
1.23.1	To achieve the results you seem to want , we have to move to a total lockdown .	St
1.23.2	Anything less will negate all the positive effects of this investment .	St
1.23.3	Bob	St
1.24.1	I beleive that we should shoot for total lock downs .	St
1.24.2	We should find every means of protection to secure our computers and lives .	St
1.24.3	Purchasing the iPhantom only increases our security along with other measures .	St
1.24.4	I am glad to see that you agree the combination of software security along with that of the iPhantoms gateway security is a good thing .	St
1.24.5	Nothing can protect you from everything , but this combination is the best I have found out there .	St
1.25.1	& quot ; Nothing can protect you from everything , but this combination is the best I have found out there. & quot ; Thanks , superhifi , for restoring perspective .	St
1.25.2	I have to admit that , in his obsession , Bob P. may have a point , given ongoing revelations re the Washington mob 's nefarious deployments of NSA , FBI , DoD and who knows what else .	St
1.25.3	Sadly , however , Bob 's point is irrelevant to the real discussion here .	St
1.25.4	The only real solution to Bob 's concern wo n't be technological but rather political -- investigation , exposure , censure , impeachment , and/or conviction .	St
1.25.5	Such issues belong in some other forum , not this one .	St
1.25.6	Yet , well meant responses to Bob only further encourage him .	St
1.25.7	I found my way to this forum looking for means optimally to protect my system at reasonable cost -- while I try to get my job done .	St
1.25.8	My first computer was an original IBM PC ( no hard drive ! ) .	St
1.25.9	I belonged to three user groups and many SIGS , talked the tech talk and did my own hardware/software upgrades and fixes .	St
1.25.10	I survived many MS-DOS versions plus WIN286 and 386 ( AAArrrgh !	St
1.25.11	) , etc .	St
1.25.12	Now -- at 71 -- my priorities are quite different .	St
1.25.13	I still work against tight deadlines with a hefty workload , but I now have a distinctly finite amount of time on this planet .	St
1.25.14	Hence , I 'm urgently more interested in work product than in process .	St
1.25.15	In this case , all I wanted to know was : a ) what 's the difference between Stingray and the Phantom products ?	Ques
1.25.16	; and b ) what hands-on , real-world experience does anyone have using these products to prevent threats to their work ?	Ques
1.25.17	Among you , despite the static , you gave me what I came here for .	St
1.25.18	I 'm grateful for your helpfulness .	St
1.25.19	Now I 'll be calling Phantom and will let you know my own experience with the product .	St
1.25.20	Good Holidays , thomkil	St
1.26.1	Gentlemen : I 've been away from this forum since my original post .	St
1.26.2	I purchased one device for my daughter .	St
1.26.3	She installed it and loves it .	St
1.26.4	It has totally cleaned up the malware she used to experience when online .	St
1.26.5	Her husband called a friend of his that runs computer security for a large credit card firm .	St
1.26.6	His friend , a highly respected computer engineer , said his firm highly recommends the iPhantom to their customers .	St
1.26.7	I understand where everyone is coming from in this continuing debate .	St
1.26.8	The point is that this device makes online security easily attainable for nontechnical people .	St
1.26.9	I for one do not have any fear about Govt .	St
1.26.10	taps .	St
1.26.11	If I were a terrorist or pedophile or downloading music , videos or software then I might be concerned that iPhantom is not located offshore .	St
1.26.12	I am grateful that our Govt .	St
1.26.13	is doing it 's best to protect us !	St
1.26.14	I ca n't go into specifics but one of our beautiful cities still exists only because a friend was able to prevent an incident from occuring because of the Govt .	St
1.26.15	ability to ''tap '' online communications .	St
1.26.16	For that I 'm grateful !	St
1.26.17	Thank you all for the educational debate !	St
1.26.18	Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to all .	St
1.26.19	QuantumHawk	St
1.27.1	I 've been wanting to get the iPhantom for my home network .	St
1.27.2	I do have two questions .	St
1.27.3	1 .	St
1.27.4	Will the iPhantom protect ports that software is & quot ; listening & quot ; to ?	Ques
1.27.5	Or does it have a way to & quot ; poke holes & quot ; in the firewall that would unsecure the ports ?	Ques
1.27.6	2 .	St
1.27.7	Does iPhantom cause latency or other issues with World of Warcraft online play ?	Ques
1.27.8	Thanks !	St
