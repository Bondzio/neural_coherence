western digital was saying that 55 degrees celcius should be the maximum temperature during full use.
so it's definitely an issue that i'm idling so hot.
i don't really use the cd-rom drive much, it's probably worth ditching that to mount one of the hard drives there?
i'd do that, but i'm not sure if that will bring the temperature down enough as there still isn't much airflow over them.
i think they built this with the capability of two drives but only enough space to keep one cool.
i'll work on a pic.
is there a way to post them?
