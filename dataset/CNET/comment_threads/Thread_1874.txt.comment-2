Clear the CMOS and accept the defaults and keep it in the most basic mode.
Review those setting and only tweak to reflect what you have, like CDs, etc.
and then proceed to save it.
The frt.
panel shouldn't make bit of difference, you can unplug them all expect for power and proceed with your PS install.
If it still fails, you may have a bad cpu/ram or other componet.
Under XP install try the compatibility mode and see what the results are before any install.
You may have encountered what the MicronPC was casuing a problem for the orginal owner???
good luck -----Willy
