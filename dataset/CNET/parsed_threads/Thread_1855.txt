<s> Here's a little mystery for anyone interested. </s>
<s> Built a desktop a year ago (AMD athlon duo core 5200+). </s>
<s> Came with a motherboard disk full of drivers. </s>
<s> These all worked perfectly with a new speaker set I had (central subwoofer that plugs into the back of the computer with two tweeters that are plugged into the subwoof). </s>
<s> Perfect sound. </s>
<s> 1 year later I have a hard drive crash and have to reinstall everything including the audio driver (Realtek HD audio driver 5.10.0.5443). </s>
<s> I don't remember the desktop icon or application ever being on my xp activity bar (whatever you call the list of active program icons at the bottom right of the screen), but it's now there. </s>
<s> Coincidentally, the exact same speaker setup no longer works. </s>
<s> I've fiddled with every possible configuration of settings and plug-ins, but the best I can do is to get the subwoofer to work by itself, and only if the tweeters are not plugged into it. </s>
<s> The audio driver app is set to line-out (not subwoofer) when this works. </s>
<s> No other combination of plugging in the tweeters by themselves, use of different back panel plugs, settings for different speaker channel number, output sampling rate or output source settings will work. </s>
<s> So, it worked before, but doesn't work now. </s>
<s> I've uninstalled, reinstalled, checked for different ways it could be installed, driver updates, different motherboard disk audio options, etc....but nothing helps. </s>
<s> Other possibly relevant evidence: Some types of internet videos apps don't seem to play audio. </s>
<s> Earphones work perfectly (when plugged into the earphone jack on the subwoof--actually a little hub halfway up the cord) The realtek audio diver doesn't actually seem to have a channel setup (subwoof + two tweets) that correspond my (extremely common) setup....only options are 2,4,6 channels and headphones. </s>
<s> Anyone who solves this problem will get my eternal thanks and a check in the mail for services rendered. </s>
<s> Real-tek hater, Ph.D </s>
<s> In order to assist you with your situation; we need a bit more information (ie: mobo make/ model, videocard, RAM...that sort of thing), thinking it might still be a driver issue, but will know more after some research. </s>
