ok well i know on the microsoft website it says you have to have 1GHZ Processor and 1GHZ of ram to run vista but i am wondering if you could have lower processor like a pentium 3 or 4 if it is possible to run vista and 512MB or 192MB of ram to run vista Home Basic.
anyways if anyone knows anything please say all will be appreciate thanks
