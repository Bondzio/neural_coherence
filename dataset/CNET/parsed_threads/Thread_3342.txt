<s> I'm looking to implement a single proxy server for two different VLANs. </s>
<s> Both VLAN have outgoing traffic configured through different ISP i.e. </s>
<s> traffic for users on VLAN1 is routed through ISP1 and traffic for users on VLAN2 is routed through ISP2. </s>
<s> Inter-VLAN communication is enabled. </s>
<s> The proxy server should route internet traffic for users in VLAN1 through ISP1 and for users in VLAN2 traffic should be routed through ISP2. </s>
<s> Is this setup possible? </s>
<s> If yes, how? </s>
<s> Because all I would ever need to do is set the default gateway for each LAN. </s>
<s> I've seen this discussion before and maybe you didn't detail enough to show why a proxy is needed. </s>
<s> But for now, it's a bit simple. </s>
<s> Just a common IP setting. </s>
<s> Your new networker tends to use a proxy where none is required. </s>

<s> Bob, Thanks for your response. </s>
<s> Can you please elaborate more on this. </s>
<s> What do you mean by common IP setting? </s>
<s> The two VLAN are different subnets and their internet traffic is routed through different WAN networks (ISP). </s>
<s> What hardware/software/TCP-IP configurations does this require? </s>
<s> How can we configure the proxy server to route traffic from different VLAN to different gateways? </s>
<s> I wrote the basic entry and with that I told it all. </s>
<s> Your goal here is unclear as everything seems to be up and running. </s>
<s> A router may do what you want, but I see no reason given for a proxy server. </s>

<s> -&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server Your question sounds more like something I do with routing. </s>
<s> My goal is to use proxy server is for content filtering. </s>
<s> Also i do not want to procure hardware separately for different subnets. </s>
<s> That makes me to think of configuring a single proxy server for different VLAN. </s>
<s> Hardware is cheap. </s>
<s> IT staff is expensive. </s>
<s> A first cut at this would be some box with enough ethernet ports for the job and running the proxy servers in their own virtual machines on say Linux. </s>
<s> At no time would we connect the LANs to each other because of the havoc that would ensue with DHCP. </s>
