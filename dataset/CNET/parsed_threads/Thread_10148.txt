<s> I have a odd question. </s>
<s> I took a speed test for my internet: Download Speed was 781.7 Kbps Upload Speed was 215.5 Kbps Ok, I checked in network connection and its reported speed was: 100.Mbps How is that? </s>
<s> The speed in the 2nd one, in Windows in Network Connections, is much faster, faster than any connection that a company advertises, excpet T3. </s>
<s> Are they recording different types of speed? </s>
<s> Just wondering, nothing serious. </s>

<s> upload and download speeds are often referred to as asymetric. </s>
<s> Your ISP can probably sell you a symetric (upload = download) connection, but will charge you more. </s>
<s> Most people do not host their own website or download site, so asymetric speeds are fine. </s>
<s> OK, thanks! </s>

<s> Internet speed is indeed asymmetrical, two different speeds. </s>
<s> Network speed is symmetrical, the same speed both directions. </s>
<s> And network speed is between each PC on your network, or the maximum speed at the NIC. </s>
<s> If you have a router and several PCs connected, on a good day you can get 100 Mb/s data transfer rate between the PCs. </s>
<s> Wayne Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach that person to use the Internet and they won't bother you for weeks. </s>
