My home built 2 Gig AMD has a 40GB master and a 60GB slave along with a DL DVD-RW and CD-RW drive and half a Gig of RAM.
But I just HAD to have that Maxtor 7,200 RPM 80GB drive to fit into my Bytecc external USB-2 case.
Just because my 40GB drive has 20 left, and the 60 has 55 left, I just had to have that new one.
