I'm looking to buy a new gaming PC in the next couple months, and am currently looking at this one here: http://www.trademe.co.nz/Computers/Desktops/LCD-monitor/auction-243943903.htm As far as high performance gaming goes, is this gonna perform well? The highest spec game I'll be playing is probably GTA IV, and then just older ones like Half-Life 2. Thanks in advance for any help!
