While organizing the case wiring as my last step in completing a clean installation of XP pro on an A7N8X-E WD Raptor SATA RAID 1 array computer, I unknowingly rebooted the machine with the hardrive(s) power connectors disconnected. Now upon restarting, the post continues until I get the System Disk Failure &quot;hit any key to continue&quot; message,then at this point the restart won't continue. Do you know of any possible way restore from this point and save the installation? Thank You in advance from Mr. Putz

I would try booting from the XP CD and doing a reinstallation using the &quot;Repair&quot; option. Good luck.
