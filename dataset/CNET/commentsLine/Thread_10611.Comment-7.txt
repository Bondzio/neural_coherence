before i got this card i had a radeon 9200 se, which had something wrong with it (with it, comp would constantly freeze, even on other computers).
it didnt have a fan, this one does though.
when i got the card i thought it might be the power supply, so i changed the 250 watt with a 350 watt, but it was pretty cheap, and i've heard it can cause problems.
also, yesterday i thought it might be the ram, so i ran a momory test program, and i got some interesting results.
when i tested each stick of ram individually, i got no errors, but together, i did get some.
i tried running hl2 with just one stick, and after 15 muinites or so, it went haywire, much like when using both sticks.
so i dont think its the ram.
with ram and video card ruled out, i gues the power supply could be it.
could it be the motherboard??
can a software problem cause these types of severe graphical glitches (see screenshot in first post.
