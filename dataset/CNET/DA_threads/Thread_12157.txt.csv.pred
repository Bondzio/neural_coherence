1.1.1	Hi i just installed my new AMD Athlon XP 2600 on an asus a7z8x mother board AMD says i should get 2GHz Yet the system is only showing 1.14GHz how do i fix this?	St
1.1.2	Thanks, Marc	St
1.2.1	Have a look in the Bios and try resetting the FSB to 133mhz.	St
1.3.1	You need to go into the BIOS and check the FSB and clock multiplier settings.	St
1.3.2	If you set them incorrectly the machine will boot into a failsafe configuration which will give you the lower clock speeds.	St
