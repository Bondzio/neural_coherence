Yes, I learned about slave/master when I installed my CDR drive.
What does the &quot;cable select&quot; setting mean?
And how would I reformat the old hard drive?
I'm really a novice at this type of stuff, although I do know the basics about computers so I learn things like this pretty fast.
Thanks for the help so far.
