cpu 2.66ghz ram 256 mb.
i downloaded that aft and it cleans everything out, ie, temps, cache, cookies,prefetch, etc.
, and i use it daily.
i defrag and scan disk weekly.
i have no icons down by my clock except my zone alarm and my volume icon.
i disabled all those things from my startup, so i wouldnt have all those icons down there.
since my first post, i tried getting to that site with firefox and i had no problem.
it has something to do with ie i think, but i don't know what.
thanks again, sitnpritee
