the long thread covered many aspects of what is udf or packet writing.
for some, it's less than reliable.
and if it is reliable all i have ever needed to do is to wait for it to eventually hiccup for those that never had an issue.
which is why i simply erase a cdrw (now dvdrw), record what i want and treat it like a cdr or dvdr... bob
