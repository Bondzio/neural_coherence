well today i come home and boot up my computer.
as soon as it boots my mouse doesnt work anymore and it says &quot;power surge on hub port&quot;.
i moved my mouse from the back usb port to the front and it works but my keyboard still will not work.
i was looking around in device manager and disabled my mouse lol!
