you'll find that lcds have a native resolution which provides the best image quality and that changing to another resolution degrades the image.
my 19&quot; has a native resolution of 1280 x 1024 and resolutions for larger monitors go even higher.
this means the icon and text sizes may not get larger just because the screen is larger.
as well, most come as &quot;wides-screen&quot; but you can still find a few with the old traditional aspect ratio.
in any event, you'll need to adjust settings with a newer monitor anyway but don't mess with the native resolution.
