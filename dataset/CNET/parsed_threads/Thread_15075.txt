<s> I am just about to make a purchase of a Drobo + a DroboShare. </s>
<s> I have one question though. </s>
<s> How can I format/set up my Drobo and DroboShare so that I can read and write to it from Mac, Linux, and Windows with large files? </s>
<s> With EXT3 Mac and Windows can't access it. </s>
<s> With NTFS Mac can't write to it. </s>
<s> With FAT32 I can't have files over 4GB. </s>
<s> With HFS+ Linux can't write to it. </s>
<s> (I believe there is some commercial software for making Windows read/write to HFS+, but I don't know how well it works.) </s>
<s> So I'm stuck, unless I am missing something. </s>
<s> I am unfamiliar with how NASs work, so this might not even be an issue, but I don't know. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Oops - never mind. </s>
<s> From the Drobo website: &quot;Connect to your DroboShare no matter which file system youve chosen from the Windows, Mac, or Linux client of your choice because DroboShare operates on the open, cross-platform SMB protocol.&quot; Thanks anyway! </s>
<s> Did you get this to work? </s>
<s> I was going to do the same thing, use the drobo share with a mac and pc. </s>
<s> If you got it to work I would be grateful for some info. </s>
<s> Cheers Marek </s>
<s> Well, theoretically it should work. </s>
<s> So far my Linux boxes recognize it flawlessly, I haven't tried on Windows, and the Mac can see it, but can't connect. </s>
