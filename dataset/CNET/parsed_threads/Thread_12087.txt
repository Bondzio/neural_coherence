<s> I am running an HP JetDirect 170x with a HP DesignJet 500 connected to it via parallel port. </s>
<s> I am running a Windows Server 2003 server and Active Directory with over 100 computers running Windows XP Pro SP2. </s>
<s> Only one computer is able to print to this printer. </s>
<s> I have installed this printer on other computers with seemingly the same configuration; however I cannot get any of the other computers on the network to print to this printer. </s>
<s> From any computer on the network, I am able to ping this device and get a postive reply. </s>
<s> I am also able to telnet and access the web-based manager from any computer. </s>
<s> I have done everything I could think of to get this to work. </s>
<s> I even tried to install the DLC protocol on a computer, and nothing works. </s>
<s> I appreciate any ideas and help provided. </s>

<s> Ask yourself this question, where are the printer drivers for this software? </s>
<s> I don't know a lot on this, because I'm not a tech person, but I have a small network of three laptops using a print server. </s>
<s> All three laptops have the network software for the printers so they can print. </s>
<s> I have this set up so I don't have to leave any computer on so the others can print. </s>
<s> I know where I work, when I choose print, I can go to print server1 or print server2. </s>
<s> So I'm guessing that these print servers have the software to print to the many printers on the network. </s>
<s> Each printer has a ip address. </s>
<s> Not sure if I helped you or not but good luck with this. </s>

<s> As I understood you description you are using the parallel port? </s>
<s> IF this is so then you are sharing through windows? </s>
<s> If the above is true make sure that the firewall settings are set correct to let outside computers print to that printer... </s>
<s> I am not to sure how server 2003 works but I think that may be the problem... </s>
<s> If you need to use more the one computer the ideal solution is to upgrade to the internal web server, and just put the printer direct on your network. </s>
<s> Not only is this much faster the printer is always there even when the computer is not on. </s>
<s> Just a side note on the 500's, make sure you change the p-head too. </s>
<s> This can cause problems with the carriage later on if this is not done at least once per year depending on how much you are printing. </s>
<s> Parallel port connects printer to print server. </s>
<s> Print server will be on ethernet cable. </s>
<s> worked with another on a school network without problems but that network was not complex. </s>
<s> I don't know how yours was set up but we used static addressing rather DHCP. </s>
<s> The print server needs a fixed address and that address must also be configured on the TCP/IP port that was created on each PC. </s>
<s> I presume this was done. </s>
<s> However, we later had a similar problem with another network printer that installed and configured ok but wouldn't print. </s>
<s> It turned out to be a TCP/IP address conflict and XP didn't warn us about it. </s>
<s> I wonder if you are using DHCP and the print server's address isn't in a reserved range. </s>
