hello, i have a computer with a graphics card which allows for hdmi and dvi outputs, there is no vga port on it.
however, on my motherboard there is a vga port which has a cover blocking it (placed by the manufacturer, hp).
i have tried simply connecting a monitor to this port but it is not recognized.
i cant find any settings on the computer to use this on board port.
is there something i am missing, or is it simply not possible.
i am trying to be able to have dual screen monitors, without having to use the hdmi port.
thanks.
