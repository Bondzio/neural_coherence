You get 10 w RMS and not 800 to 900 watts the various dealers specify. Anyway, you generally just need a shielded cable that plugs into your sound card's jack and into the speaker's input jack. The speaker set should probably come with such a cable. There are no drivers or such needed. Just plug it in, turn up the volume and hope it works.

You can check the sound device status under Device Manager (Right click on My Computer, go to Properties and then Hardware/Device Manager. You should see a listing for sound and gaming devices. A yellow exclamation point usually means no driver, a red X means disabled, and no listing means no sound device. If your RCA jack is along the motherboard card edge, you have an on board device. It may be that it's not enabled in the BIOS. Do a good search for a sound device on your system as a first step.
