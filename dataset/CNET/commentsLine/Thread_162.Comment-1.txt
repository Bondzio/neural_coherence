i have built a new pc - p4 2.6 (800),asus p4p800 mobo , asus 128mb fx5600 , 512mb ddr400 , maxtor 120gb 7200 hd , sony 16x dvd , asus 5224 cdrw.
it runs a lot slower than expected.norton speed disc (defrag) has been running for nearly 24 hours and has still not completed - a task that usually takes several hours.when i try to install a game it is extremely slow to install when using the cdrw ( although the drive works fine when burning etc ) but is fine when installed from the dvd.the whole pc just seems far slower than it should be - its works but just so slow.the motherboard accepts dual channel ram but normal ddr is installed.would upgrading the ram to dual channel help - could anything be set wrong in the bios that is slowing it down?
- could the hard drive be the cause?any advice - really appreciated
