since you can look at the dc connection, internally be sure what' s what.
solder being loose or contacts are wiggle able should be soldered.
however, many times, a minor crack is present on the pcb(board) so be sure all is well.
you can even re-enforce it abit by placing a short piece of wire to hold more solder and thus brace it up provided that can be done at all.
