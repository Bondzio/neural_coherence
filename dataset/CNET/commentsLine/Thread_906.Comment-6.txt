sorry about that.
i use many nas if i expand beyond office, home and lab.
we just don't have that particular unit.
some think this is a tech support forum and that moderators are paid to answer questions.
that is untrue.
these are discussion forums and no one is paid.
-&gt; more on point.
i know that issue with vendors and why i won't buy if they won't answer simple (to me) questions.
why not go to iomega's web site and find the phone number then call?
it's what i would have to do.
and about asking for owners to know this.
even if an owner had it, most are just &quot;owners&quot; that use the product and won't be able to get this technical.
i can but i don't own or have access to said unit.
i also did not try to research this on the internet (you can do that.)
but i do know why people may ask and shared how i was able to retrieve files for what was thought to be a proprietary files system (i booted linux.)
