I was wondering if there are any steps I need to take and how to do them to find out compatibility of mycase and motherboard. Like I have a Compaq Presario SR1330NX Desktop: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&cc=ca&docname=c00280664&product=443740&dlc=en&lang=en And was wondering how I would go about finding a motherboard that would upgrade my system and allow me in the future to perform other upgrades and such? But yeah, are there any real steps needed, and if so, could you explain and help me?

Also, drivers aren't standard,and would need to be backuped prior to the installation of a new os. As for the ocmpatibility, just make sure the powersupply motherboard cable (24-pin ,etc...) is the same on the motherboard. I would highly not suggest upgrading the motherboard. Roger

I was just wondering, do you think I would be able to use this problem free? Right now it looks like a great price for how much he was hyping it up and telling me how it would improve and benefit me so much. 65 bucks after a rebate so, my question, do you think it would work in my case? Is it a smart buy?

A surprise upgrade cost will be a new XP (or other) license. 2. The upgrade may tax the old power supply. While this can be cheap many upgraders forget the stock power supply may not be up to the task. 3. Internal wiring. While I don't have much issue here some will give the market failing marks on how to wire up the reset, LED active, USB and more connections. Usually by your second or so upgrade you've learned your way out of this. 4. The OS won't boot on the new machine from the old hard disk. If the upgrader is new, some confusion will happen and too often they lose their files. Hopefully this list of possibly issues will help you avoid them. Bob

Upgrading a proprietary box like the one you have is a real crap shoot. Many unknowns and many potential problems. The advice you rec'd is a strong caution against doing it based on many years of experience ... I too recommend you choose another approach to a new PC. VAPCMD

But, I've read some stuff and it doesn't sound all that complicated. And I recently started working again so I have a steady cash flow coming in that Im going to spend.

I had only opened a computer once before to install a NIC card; I just decided to build my own rig since it would be completely for gaming and the ones from places like alienware are way too expensive. There are many online tutorials that help you through the process of assembling your computer - it truly is not that complicated. I got a lot of help from people on these forums and was able to get out for under $1000, but the rigs value is much more than that.

Just surfing the NET ? editing videos, running PhotoShop ? playing games ?, how many hours per day ?etc,. The more specifc you can be ...the easier it is for users to make suitable recommendations, You'll usually get plenty of comments. And by all means read the buyer comments on those products you're interested in at places like NEWEGG.COM. Armed with all the info you can order the parts and search the WWW for sites that have good step-by-step infio in 'Building-Your-Own PC'. Let us know how it goes. VAPCMD Good Luck....

Ive opened my PC plenty of times to install harddrives, cd burners, replace psu, add a fan. So Im not completely new inside a PC. The only thing that somewhat scares me even after reading stuff on the net would be the processor. I dont know why but that just seems from what Ive read to be over me. Most of my stuff would be coming from newegg and I always read the buyer comments just to get an idea of what they thought and if anything was bad. Most of the times its just &quot;good product, fast shipping etc&quot; Theres not to many &quot;Not reccamended&quot;'s. But yeah once I more finalize my list, I will probably post here and try to get some ideas.
