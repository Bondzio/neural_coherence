i have a hard wired four computer network that needs help.
the main computer ie the one that has all the files and printers, keeps dropping off the network.
i boot the machine and all file and printer sharing is fine.
after a period of time, 1 to 4 hours, file and printer sharing are no longer available to the other machines on the network.
i have disabled the firewall on the machine but that has had no effect.
all machines on the network can get to the internet and the main machine can see files on the other machines.
yesterday i was working in an application and the connection dropped while entering data.
not a good thing.
thanks for your assistance.
