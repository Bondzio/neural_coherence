If the drive is from 2002 too, then consider you got your moneys worth.
I would replace, ASAP.
The cost isn't that much and it may take out a precious CD you may like.
Anything coming/falling from a drive is bad news.
-OR- you could use it until it really poops out.
Its your choice, but again, I would replace it.
Also, if you have kids, are they into mischief?
If possible post a link with some pics of the items in question.
