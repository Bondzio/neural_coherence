<s> Ok this has been happening for a while on my creative modemblaster which has its drivers updated by the way. </s>
<s> There are two inputs for the phone line, each time my modem dials out whether it be a successful dial or not it switches to the other input, the one where the phone line is not in. </s>
<s> So this leaves me waiting for a dial tone when i hit sign in, and if i dont hear one i must put the phone line in the other jack as soon as possible and then it will start to dial. </s>
<s> Anyone know how this happened? </s>
<s> thanks! </s>
<s> Only one of those jacks is for the phone line, the other is for an external phone so that you don't need to put a splitter on the line. </s>
<s> If you look carefully at the jack one end says line and the other says phone, or they have a picture of a wall jack and a Phone right next to the jacks. </s>
<s> Try plugging in a phone to the phone side and see if you still have the problem. </s>
<s> If what you describe is truly happening then it is time to replace the modem. </s>
<s> You could try using a splitter to run the phone line into each side, that way you never have the line in the wrong place. </s>
<s> Those two phone jacks needn't both be used unless you connect a phone there also. </s>
<s> If a phone is connected and it's the one causing a problem, because you mentioned you unhook one, it maybe the phone itself. </s>
<s> For the sake of troubleshooting, use only one phone line there, maybe even a new one to test that also. </s>
<s> If these phone lines are actually two separate phone numbers, use *only* one, that isn't the way it was intended for use. </s>
<s> Unless, you got some older &quot;shotgun&quot; modem that was popular a few years ago, in most cases most dail-up modems use one phone line. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> last year after a neighborhood phone, and power outage. </s>
<s> Strange problem, but a new modem cured it. </s>
