and dusted it off.
inside was an explanation of the four led and the status they had indicated &quot;the microprocessor has failed a bios test.&quot;, not very uplifting.
anyhow, i took your advice and identified one single jumper, also mentioned in manual, and moved it to maintenance mode.
voila!
the computer started and displayed a maintenance screen.
i set the date and time, saved and exit.
moved the jumper back to normal mode and restarted.
guess what?
it resumed operations as before.
it's strange though that the date-time setting can cause such boot problems.
but i'm happy that it's up and running, cause setting up the same peripherals on another computer would have been a challenge, even with the backups.
thanks, i'm much obliged, c-t
