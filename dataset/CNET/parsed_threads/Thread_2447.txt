<s> I got this computer off ebay. </s>
<s> Since I got it I have not been able to get a sound out of it. </s>
<s> When I look in device manager it shows me an unknown PCI device, and of course I have no drivers forit. </s>
<s> When I download the sound drivers off the compaq website supposedly for the computer I have, no luck no sound. </s>
<s> I tried diabling the on-board sound and putting in my own sound card, but that hasn't worked either. </s>
<s> Any other things I can try? </s>
<s> of Windows for this machine. </s>
<s> Without a restore cd, you need to research and install the motherboard drivers, sound, NIC etc... </s>
<s> The other possibility is the onboard sound is controlled by a jumper or the Bios or is broken. </s>
<s> go to compaq.com. </s>
<s> u can find drivers for their computers there. </s>
<s> I know that the computer came with Windows ME, The previous owner had them put Win 98 on it. </s>
<s> When I got the computer there was no sound, I wiped the drive with fdisk, then re-installed windows 98. </s>
<s> I went to the compac site and looked up the specs on the computers origianl configuration and I downloaded 2 different drivers, neither one of them worked. </s>
<s> I went to the bios and defaulted back to the origianl settings, that didn't help. </s>
<s> How can I figure out what isn't working so I can fix that. </s>
<s> I downloaded the manual on the particular kind of motherboard it is, and there is no new info there. </s>
<s> In startup it recognizes a PCI card, but never lets me download drivers. </s>
<s> This is a basic system, no extras. </s>
<s> I can't believe that it just isn't going to work, and if that is true, why didn't my sound card work? </s>
<s> Perhaps I need to go with name brand that comes with a disk. </s>
