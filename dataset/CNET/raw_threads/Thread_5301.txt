I would like to have a large screen display for the desktop, but I want it to be clear and to fit proportionality on the monitor screen. I am currently considering buying a 29 inch LCD monitor display or a 32 inch LED 720p Television. I was hoping someone on this forum could provide me with guidance as to which purchase would be a better option. I do not play video games, but I do watch a lot of You Tube videos and surf the net. The desktop also has a blue ray player. Thanks. Here is the link to the HP website that contains the computer specifications.

OLED is your true LED system but you know that. Skip/ignore 720p for now and there is little to zero difference when it comes to LED/CCFL &quot;clarity&quot;. Clarity is all about the LCD panel and possibly the protective cover (gloss = clarity but you know the drawbacks.) Bob

I suggest anything that starts better than 720 is going to provide what you need. The 5450 video ports should offer both HDMI and SVGA/DVI or all, just be sure that it connects w/o ANY!!!! adapter to make this a better match. I also find you will need to tell the TV where the media stream is coming from but that goes with any TV in most respects. Last, you may want a huge TV, but most 32in. will do the job fine IMHO. Once you get beyond 32in. you maybe pushing it unless you have true hi-end video components, etc.. It may display and all, but for how long and/or sustain it all. Of course, just buy the true PC monitor, but those TVs really make a great display. tada -----Willy
