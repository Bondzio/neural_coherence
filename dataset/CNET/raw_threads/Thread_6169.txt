I'm attempting to share files and a printer between two pcs. It should be easy. I've read everything and googled everything, but cannot figure out what my problem is. Two pcs(one is Windows XP Media Edition, the other is XP Pro). The Media Edition has the printer. Both pcs are hard wired into a LINKSYS WRT54GS. This router has 4 wired connections, plus wireless, which I can use to connect with my laptop (this works great). The files and printer are &quot;shared.&quot; I've turned off the firewall, to make sure this isn't causing my problem. Both PCs are using the same WORKGROUP name. Setting up Printer: To access my printer, I click on Printers and Faxes &gt; ADD A PRINTER &gt; WIZARD ....I select &quot;A network printer&quot; &gt; then select CONNECT TO THIS PRINTER (or browse for a printer) &gt; I click on Microsoft Windows Network, which shows me the PC containing the printer. However, no printer is displayed. When I click Next, it says &quot;You need to specify a valid network printer name.&quot; So, I give the printer name that I used on the &quot;share name:&quot; on the PC with the printer. It rejects it. So, no way to view the printer? Setting up Access to Files: When I go into windows explorer, I click on My Network Places &gt; Microsoft Windows Network &gt; Workgroup &gt; and then the two pcs are listed below. When I click on the PC containing the printer, I get the following message: \\TOMSMACHINE is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this network resource. Contact the administrator of this server. The network path was not found. .....These machines are single users, admin rights on both pcs. I've started the logging for security, but do not find any error messages. Any idea on what I'm doing wrong, or forgot to do? Thanks so much in advance for your help. Tom

Have you tried to set up a share other than the printer? does it work? Turning on file and print sharing doesn't share individual folders or printers. Those are done separately. Does the printer have a hand under the icon for it? If not, you need to do that as well.

Give both the same network name. On the last step on both machines, click the (something like) &quot;Dont run on another machine, just finish&quot;.

For example, when I hit START, the top says ADMINISTRATOR. I've tried to share files and printers....all I can see the PC name. Under files and printers, I do see a &quot;hand.&quot; From the research I've done, it appears that Windows XP Media Edition is similar to XP Home. But, I should be able to connect XP Home with XP Pro. Thanks, Tom

However, since the printer is only defined to one machine, I have this set up only on one machine. When a attempt to ADD a printer and search the network, it finds the correct machine, but doesn't list the printer. After doing some research, I noticed something.... When I'm on the machine with the printer, I can display the following: ipconfig: Connection-specific DSN suffix . : IP Address...................... : 192.168.1.100 Subnet Mask..................... : 255.255.255.0 Default Gateway................. : 192.168.1.1 C: Ping 192.168.1.101 (which is the other machine) pinging from 192.168.1.101: bytes=32 time..... But, from the other PC....here's what I get: ipconfig: Connection-specific DSN suffix . : IP Address...................... : 192.168.1.101 Subnet Mask..................... : 255.255.255.0 Default Gateway................. : 192.168.1.1 C: Ping 192.168.1.100 (which is the machine with the printer) pinging 192.168.1.100 with 32 bytes of data: request timed out. request timed out... It seems one machine can get to the other, but the other cannot get back. Any ideas? Thanks, Tom

First off, I'd be creating a user account other than the administrator account. You didn't mention whether or not you used a password. Always create a username giving it a password and make sure the same is configured on both machines. If you haven't tried already, you can disable the firewall on both to see if that's part of the issue.
