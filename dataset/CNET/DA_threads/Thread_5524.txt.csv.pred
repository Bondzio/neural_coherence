1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	motherboard chipset driver version is 4.46.	St
1.6.1	I guess we can discuss this at length.	St
1.6.2	What do you need to know to go get the latest drivers?	Ques
1.6.3	It's a very common issue which I solve daily by installing such.	St
1.6.4	I find many want to discuss why this happens.	St
1.6.5	Sorry, but I'd rather just fix it and move on.	St
1.6.6	If the latest doesn't fix it then we drill down to less common issues.	St
1.6.7	Your choice here.	St
1.6.8	Bob	St
1.7.1	I downloaded and installed the VIA Hyperion Pro Driver Package Version 5.10A.	St
1.7.2	Rebooted the PC after installation, plugged in the Creative Zen to the USB and the PC still powers down after docking.	St
1.8.1	If it powers down, tell me what wattage rating you had in the power supply.	St
1.8.2	You are not alone if it's just the front ports.	St
1.8.3	See http://www.pcclub.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=3&threadid=18841 Bob	St
1.9.1	The power supply is 300 watts.	St
1.9.2	The case only has rear USB ports.	St
1.9.3	The USB cable I am using I also use for an MP3 player and digital camera without issues.	St
1.10.1	While I wouldn't expect an USB device to push it over the edge that's mightly slim.	St
1.10.2	What happens if you use a powered USB hub?	St
1.10.3	And I did run into an issue with my PalmOne TX.	St
1.10.4	It would garble data when I used an extension cable and cause problems.	St
1.10.5	Connect it directly to the USB port without a cable or only the cable supplied with the player.	St
1.10.6	Bob	St
1.11.1	I bought a powered USB Hub and it did the trick.	St
1.11.2	It works great now.	Polite
