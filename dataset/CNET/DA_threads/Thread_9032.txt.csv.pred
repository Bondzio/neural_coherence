1.1.1	I have 1 Tb seagate hard disk which was working fine but now when i connect it to my laptop running with windows7 , windows detects the Hard disk and Icon of the disk displays at my computer .	St
1.1.2	But when I double click it to open it shows an error message box & quot ; Location is not available f : / is not accessible Access denied & quot ; .	St
1.1.3	And when I see properties by right clicking it is shows Used Space 0 bytes Free Space 0 bytes Capacity 0 Bytes Also tried to check it for errors from tools It shows error message & quot ; The disk check could not be performed because windows can not access the disk & quot ; And also i have to tried to access it from command prompt ( Run as administrator ) using command f : It shows & quot ; Access denied & quot ; When I try to change access permission from properties/security by providing full control or changing the owner it shows & quot ; unable to save the changes in permission information & quot ; .	St
1.1.4	And finally when I try to format the disk It shows & quot ; You do not have sufficient rights to perform this operation & quot ; .	St
1.1.5	& lt ; div & gt ; And I have also tested two other external drives ( WD & amp ; seagate ) but faced the same issue. & lt ; /div & gt ; How could this is possible that one day disk is working fine and next day it has this issue .	St
1.1.6	Please provide some solution to fix this .	St
1.2.1	I 'd wait to learn if these work on other PCs .	St
1.2.2	If you wanted to solve the sufficient rights issue , that 's on google but for now , try this on a new administrator account .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Yes these drives work well on other PCs but can not be accessed on my laptop .	St
1.4.1	And if they work elsewhere , formatting them is unlikely to fix the issue .	St
1.4.2	There is malware that can cause such but as presented I would be guessing if some malware was recently cleaned off .	St
1.4.3	How did the new administrator account test work out ?	Ques
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	no it is not working with new admin account too .	St
1.5.2	could you tell me why it is showing Used Space 0 bytes Free Space 0 bytes Capacity 0 Bytes when in driver properties it shows device working properly .	St
1.6.1	One more thing to add when I connect my android phone to the same laptop using USB cable , it connects and also i am able to access both phone & external memory card memory without any problem .	St
1.6.2	So i am not able to figure out what is wrong with the access for hard disks and pen drives .	St
1.7.1	Add the name of the account to the permissions .	St
1.7.2	This is discussed at http : //forums.majorgeeks.com/showthread.php ? t=245019 Bob	Ques
1.8.1	Actually as i have mentioned in my first post itself that I am also not able to change any permission setting for the drive .	St
1.8.2	it shows & quot ; unable to save the changes in permission information & quot ; .	St
1.8.3	and same error windows have no access to this object .	St
1.8.4	I think this is not a permission issue because in this case it is not even showing the disk capacity when I check properties .	St
1.9.1	I also noted above to try this in NEW admin account .	St
1.9.2	I do n't see where you did that .	St
1.9.3	This is a hardware forum so we wo n't dive into repairing the OS and since I ca n't tell how the OS was damaged I 'll have to write that a reload is next .	St
1.9.4	Bob	St
1.10.1	I have tried the NEW admin thing that you have noted but the behavior is same in every particular access method that i have stated in my first post and even changing the permission showing same error message .	St
1.11.1	I do n't know how the OS got into this state so I ca n't write any other fix other than to reload the OS .	St
1.11.2	If you need a little help in the research , see this link - & gt ; http : //xkcd.com/627/ I know a fix , even if it 's unpopular .	St
1.11.3	Bob	St
