Thanks for all your replies, folks:) I'll try moving the PC to a new location and see if that helps re: mag interference JMarchi and Willy.
I've checked the plugs to make sure there's nothing disconnected.
But the suggestion of reseating the video card is a good one, thanks Islander.
Interestingly, Denjones, I upped the refresh to 85MHz and it solved the prob for about a day and then I experience some more flickering, though not as often...
