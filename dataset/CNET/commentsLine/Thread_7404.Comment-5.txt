it's socket t, not socket 775, it's not even a socket actually, it's an lga (land grid array) it's inverse a normal cpu has pins on it's bottom, which plug into the motherboard lga 775 is the inverse, the cpu has 775 pads on it, and the board has 775 pins that connect to the cpu (never installed one/seen one up close in person (i've used lga 775 equipped machines) but i hear it's not the easiest thing in the world to do) socket 939 would be adviseable however
