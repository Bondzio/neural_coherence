<s> I bought USB 2.0 (high speed storage) Crucial Technology device some years ago. </s>
<s> It worked fine up to the time I changed my OS to Windows 8 and Ubuntu on my PCs. </s>
<s> Now I can not get it to work. </s>
<s> I have been in touch with the manufacturers but in spite of their honest efforts to help I am non the wiser. </s>
<s> The driver disc was made before even XP was thought of. </s>
<s> It is undamaged in good physical condition but does not seem to be compatible with the current OS. </s>
<s> Is there any way I could find appropriate drivers to use it? </s>
<s> It's time to get a new reader. </s>

<s> If its that old, then your use of Win8 or Ubuntu has &quot;orphan&quot; it. </s>
<s> You need to move on as you already found out one way or another its no longer supported or its out of your grasp. </s>
<s> This is not uncommon for any new OS that gets released and since this is before XP, well that's a long run. </s>
<s> At least i don't see any fix for you, unless you click on Win8 &quot;update driver&quot; and allow it to go online and see if it resolves it that way. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I wonder why Crucial people did not say that. </s>
<s> They wrote a long response but did not say, come on, enough is enough. </s>
<s> Thank you guys. </s>
<s> Grateful to you as always. </s>
