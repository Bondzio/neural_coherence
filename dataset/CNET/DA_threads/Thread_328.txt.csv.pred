1.1.1	I bought an HP PSC1401 printer/scanner.	St
1.1.2	The install disk requires over 300mb of system memory.	St
1.1.3	Talk about a memory hog!	St
1.1.4	Is there a way to make this printer functional with less memory usage?	St
1.1.5	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	But I think you meant 300MB of disk space.	St
1.2.2	I have yet to see the driver require 300MB of system memory or &quot;RAM.&quot; Did you look at hp.com for a driver only without the apps?	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Sorry about that!	St
1.3.2	I meant disk space.	St
1.3.3	I will look on HP's website.	St
1.3.4	Thanks	Polite
1.4.1	During the printer install, verify if you can install a basic or limited version w/o all the bells and whistles.	St
1.4.2	Thgis assumes, that it allows this, I know my 1350 did but I found later I wanted the full install, so again see if yours allows this.	St
1.4.3	tada ----Willy	St
