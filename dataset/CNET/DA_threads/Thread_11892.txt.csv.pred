1.4.1	Here you already have it setup to access and basically got storage present .	St
1.4.2	If you do n't like XP because it seems a resource hog , then find some Linux OS you can live with and use that as storage .	St
1.4.3	You problem is n't storage as your 1st ?	Ques
1.4.4	posed but rather with XP .	St
1.4.5	You probably could be better served using some ext .	St
1.4.6	USB case with HD and just deal with it as an extension of your current main system rather than a network .	St
1.4.7	Using a NAS ( purchase ) setup would be more open to a network storage and any system that has access to it .	St
1.4.8	The last option , would be to keep your laptop XP OS and add/replace with a larger HD to increase storage itself .	St
