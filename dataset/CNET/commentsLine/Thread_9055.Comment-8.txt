that happened to a couple of laptops i was working on.
i'm assuming you don't have a secure network.
on one of them, i simply went to the system restore's earlier time (before things started happening).
i then &quot;renewed&quot; (repaired) the ipaddress and it worked just fine.
on another laptop, we actually had to send the laptop back to the manufacturer to get it working.
the laptop lost its ability to &quot;repair&quot; after the user intalled sp2.
on the first laptop i worked on started having problems after updating the system from ibm.
my suggestion is that you don't update os and it looks like you know know how to secure your system without sp2.
good luck!
