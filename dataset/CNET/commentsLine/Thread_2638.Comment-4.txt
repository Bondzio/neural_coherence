there are ati and hauppaugge offerings but maybe you thought you could record in hd.
i'm going to decline explaining that one since it's been done (a few many times.)
&quot;i'm trying to use the cable signal that is already coming into my house.&quot; i can do that today since they are not discontinuing the old rf channels.
maybe there is some confusion there?
