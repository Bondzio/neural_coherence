<s> I want to purchase this pci USB 2.0/Firewire card: http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=15-104-223&depa=0 The card has one internal USB port and the case I want has two front mounted USB ports. </s>
<s> Is it possible to turn the one internal USB port on the pci card into two ports so that each USB port on the front of the case can be used? </s>
<s> You would have to install a &quot;HUB&quot; since it takes more than wires to turn one port into two... </s>
<s> There's a second issue is that most cases have straight wires from the front panel which isn't rated for USB 2.0 speeds. </s>
<s> Be careful about that. </s>
