You are dealing with the physics of radio signals.
An RF signal at some frequency only is received by a proper sized antenna that has the matching resonant frequency.
There are electronics courses on the subject, but in a nutshell, some want no antennas at all.
There is a way to move the bigger antenna to another device, then rebroadcast on another freqency that doesn't require a big antenna.
I supplied just such an solution with that FM transmitter.
In closing, I can't teach physics or electronic design in this small space.
You might have to take some courses.
