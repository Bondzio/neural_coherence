ok you see, what i'm trying to create is the ultimate gaming machine for myself.
i've got a good idea to what is going to have, but i'm just contemplating how to cool it and make it quite, flexability of over clocking, etc.
this is what i was kinda thinking of: stuff it with loads of water cooling tubes which are being fed with realy cold water.
use some custom components like a radiator that emits cool air, some taps to controll the flow of water to the different components, and a realy big slow rotating fan to keep the air moving inside the comp.
i want to completely enclose it to stop my cat's hair getting inside of it.
(loads of it keeps gathering on the metal grid at the intake) some good software/hardware that measures the heat levels in the comp.
