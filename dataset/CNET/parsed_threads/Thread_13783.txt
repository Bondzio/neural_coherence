<s> Question for the community - I'm looking for a black and white printer for my home. </s>
<s> But, i have to print many pages a day, so I'm trying to find a hard core printer that does automatic duplex, is fast and can print out many sheets on one cartridge (primarily text and some graphics). </s>
<s> I have an all in one color that's great for fax/scan/phots, but not for high volume black and white. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be appreciated! </s>
<s> Any decent b&w laser ptr. </s>
<s> will do, but then you mentioned &quot;duplex&quot; and that's a curve ball. </s>
<s> Because of that you get into expensive options. </s>
<s> I suggest you look at Okidata lasers as they're robust and darn near perfect, just find one with duplex. </s>
<s> If possible and in your area, check local office & computer shops to sample or hands-on testing. </s>
<s> I'm sure you'll find HP, Canon, Samsung, & Brother etc. </s>
<s> available, don't settle too much on cost alone as the duplex option really can befuddle any printer. </s>
<s> Remember, if you plan to use real punishing demands, $ spend up front helps in the long run. </s>
<s> Some b&w lasers are so cheap w/o duplex, you can use that under those conditions when duplex isn't needed then shop for the duplex model and use some switching port/network to dump that output. </s>

<s> Willy - Thanks for the tip! </s>
<s> I will check out the stores and let you know what I find. </s>
<s> You might consider a larger paper tray as well. </s>
<s> The HP models use a suffix system on their models as follows: d=duplex t=tray n=network so a model that ends in &quot;dtn&quot; means it does duplexing, has an extra paper tray and a built in network card. </s>
<s> Other variants of the suffix exist as well. </s>
<s> Old HP laserjets from the 1990's can still be worthwhile printers. </s>
<s> Stuff does wear on them (particularly the rubber feed rollers), so it'd be best to buy from an expert who will give some warranty. </s>
<s> (Yes, toner cartridges are still readily available for 15 year old printers.) </s>
<s> Or, try asking on Freecycle, and you may score one for nothing but the cost of a new cartridge. </s>
<s> Apart from that... what the other guy said. </s>
<s> Look at what Staples is selling, take notes, then check the online reviews. </s>
