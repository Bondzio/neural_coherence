<s> someone told me that you cannot put a SATA and an IDE HDD in the same computer even if they have available slots. </s>
<s> is it true? </s>
<s> these are the slots on my motherboard: Eight USB 2.0 ports One serial port One parallel port Four Serial ATA interfaces One parallel ATA IDE interface with UDMA 33, ATA-66/100 support One diskette drive interface PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports I already have one 40GB IDE HDD and one DVD-rom. </s>
<s> can i still add a SATA HDD and another DVD+/-R/RW without throwing away the exhisting ones? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> Every thing is set up in Bios. </s>
<s> Both IDE & Raid & Sata all set up in Bios. </s>
<s> I have IDE, Sata, and Raid in my computer all set up inside Bios. </s>
<s> See your motherboard Manuel, or go to the motherboard web site. </s>

<s> if you have the SATA-drivers installed, there is no problem at all. </s>
<s> most newer OS-es will then recognise your drives. </s>
<s> I have IDE 1 - 4 for 2 HD- en 2 DVD-drives en SATA 1 -2 for another 2 HD- drives. </s>
<s> what I'm using it for: I'm still waiting for KNOPPIX 5.0.1 (genuine installation to hard disk will now possible for the very first time) and Kubuntu to be ready. </s>
<s> if it takes to long, I'll start wit Suse 10.1 anyway. </s>
<s> once complete, I'll be able to boot from floppy and CD/DVD to whatever, from PATA to linux (my trio) and from SATA to W-xp PRO just by changing the boot-order in the BIOS. </s>
<s> how's that for multi-boot?? </s>
<s> succes, ben </s>
