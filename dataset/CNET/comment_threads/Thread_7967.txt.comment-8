ANY firewall can stop this from working.
Your choice on the firewall and its settings.
Before I write one more word, I offer ZERO support for firewalls.
This area is one you take up with the firewall provider.
You can keep trying this setup, but I know it's not easy to setup (witness how many firewall themselves closed) and the hardware issues.
The Router is much easier to setup.
Best of luck, bob
