On the Exceptions tab of WF, put a check mark in File and Print sharing. Open Windows Explorer, click on the Tools/ Folder Options, then click on the View tab. At the bottom you will see Use Simple File Sharing, put a check mark in this. Set some folder on each PC to be shared and you should be good to go. Third party firewalls usually have the ability to let LAN traffic through. Each one has is own design.
