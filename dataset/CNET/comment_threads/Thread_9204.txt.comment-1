I am shopping for a socket AM2 MB and I wanted one with an AGP slot since I have a few AGP cards lying around.
My case is ATX.
I seem to only be finding MB's that meet my criteria in Micro ATX.
Anyone know of a MB full size ATX, socket AM2, with AGP slot?
Maybe there is no such animal and I will have to go PCI-E and sell AGP cards on ebay?
