are you an intel or amd fan?
post the results here!
(if your amd what do you think about the new phenom, if intel, about there quad core) (also i anyone has some cpu benchmarks to prove there core better post it here.)
well to get this started i'm an amd fan.
and i think that phenom will be the best chip out there as soon as all the bugs are worked out.
