1.1.1	I currently have a Celeron 2.2GHz Socket 478 running inside a Dell Dimension 2400 still with the stock Dell motherboard.	St
1.1.2	Currently, identification programs such as CPU-Z have listed the effective FSB as 400 with a true FSB of 100.	St
1.1.3	I have heard other people describe Intel FSB's as &quot;quadpumped&quot; (100x4=400).	St
1.1.4	Does anyone know if 400MHz is the limited effective speed for this computers motherboard because I'm curious to know if putting a Socket 478 Pentium 4 with an 800MHz would work in this computer.	Ques
1.2.1	If 400MHz is the limit, meaning the Pentium 4 with 800MHz won't work, will a Pentium M that fits into a socket 478 that runs around 1.8GHz be able to beat a Celeron at 2.2GHz (my current chip)?	St
1.3.1	to see if they give the part/model number of the mobo??	St
1.3.2	Then go to the mobo mfr's site to see.	St
1.3.3	Obviously, among other things it would require faster memory.	St
1.3.4	Does the data you have give you the part number of the MCH chip of the chipset??	St
1.3.5	Here's a link to get Intel documents.	St
1.3.6	Search for the chipset.	St
1.3.7	http://developer.intel.com/design/Pentium4/documentation.htm	St
