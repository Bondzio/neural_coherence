1.1.1	My computer reported an error in writing to the c: drive (I have my drive partitioned) while working/surfing/ (on known sites) on it.	St
1.1.2	I did a restart of the computer, and came up with a black screen, nothing else.	St
1.1.3	I put in another backup drive and got the computer running.	St
1.1.4	The main C: drive is blank, empty 0 free space, 0 space.	St
1.1.5	It needs to be formated?	St
1.1.6	huh?	St
1.1.7	What happened?	St
1.1.8	I have tried to use several free hardrive recovery programs with no luck(not seeing anything)?	St
1.1.9	What is going on here?	St
1.1.10	How can i recover from this?	Ques
1.1.11	Thanks in advance...	St
1.2.1	Hoe old is this hard drive?	St
1.2.2	Did you try setting the jumper on the failing drive to slave put in the PC and see if you axcess anything?	St
1.2.3	When it is installed as a slave see if you can run scandsk on it.	St
1.2.4	John	St
1.3.1	see anything on the partitions of that original drive?	St
1.3.2	If so, try salvaging whatever you can off the partitions to a cd (or copy everything over to the current drive you are using).	Sug
1.3.3	Once you have salvaged what you can try putting the drive back in a the Master C: drive to boot with, and use your bootdisk to get to the A: prompt....then see if a FDISK /MBR command will put things back right.	St
1.3.4	(this is assuming it's anything other than XP as other things might need to be done to see if the drive can be recovered).	St
1.3.5	Which free recovery programs did you use before and how were they used?	St
1.3.6	TONI	St
1.4.1	I can see the other partitions!!	St
1.4.2	Just my first partition with my windows, programs, etc on is GONE!	St
1.4.3	I mean there is nothing there.	St
1.5.1	Running 2000.	St
1.5.2	Will the bootdisk FDISK/MBR command work without deleting the data on the other partitions?	St
1.5.3	I was thinking of trying to repair the disk (quick fix?)	St
1.5.4	by inserting the windows CD.	St
1.5.5	And seeing if It would repair the partition.	St
1.5.6	I have reformatted many harddrives before(with the boot disks), and i know that you can repair them as well(instead of the full install), and in doing that you just rewrite the windows files.	St
1.5.7	I know the easiest way is just to reinstall a fresh copy, but i would like to get it back instead of this option..	St
1.5.8	Virtual lab, Get data back, and Data recovery insurance program - were used.	St
1.5.9	They came up with minimal results..	St
1.6.1	Writing to a possibly corrupt drive may make matters worse.	St
1.6.2	BEFORE YOU DO ANY REPAIR ask yourself if you have recovered what you can at this point.	St
1.6.3	I've seen people reach a point where they could have scrapped their files off, but didn't.	St
1.6.4	They proceeded with repair (that should have been safe) and lost it all.	St
1.6.5	Don't do what Johny does.... Bob	Ques
1.7.1	Then backup you data before you do anything else!	St
1.7.2	John	St
1.8.1	Any chance you got a bomb type worm?	St
1.8.2	I've had three client computers in my shop in the last two weeks, same thing as you, well similar, one was a NTldr missing but same idea.	St
1.8.3	These worms go in and demo your MFT.	St
1.8.4	Normally used for specific targets though.	St
