However, it is all the related issues that are leaving me cold now. I'm considering ordering a custom computer for business including repeated burning of training DVDs. I'll probably choose a Pentium 4. In one recent computer advertisement the following items were mentioned as CPU-related: * 775-pin architecture * 90nm cores * Intel's HyperThreading technology * Compatible with Intel's new 925 and 915 motherboard chipsets * Add in DDR2 support and PCI-E, two of the hottest new technologies available today. Question: how important are they? For example rather than the 775-pin architecture, I think I remember reading about a 900-something-pin. What's the significance? Same with the other items - how do we know what's important? Also, if any are important, how can we be sure the technician putting our new computer together will use the latest technology, or at least give us a choice? Thanks.

It's not that I'm talking to myself &lt;grin&gt; but, rather, I'm reading other forums and learning. For example, about an hour ago I found the following in a thread on the &quot;Computer Newbies&quot; Forum. Every little bit helps &lt;g&gt;. &quot;With Hyper-Threading Technology, desktop users can experience greater system responsiveness and performance when multitasking. At home, users can encode audio and video at the same time, or run a virus scan in the background without diminishing performance on their favorite game. In the office, HT Technology enables IT managers to deploy PC services such as encryption, compression or backup technologies while minimizing the impact PC user productivity&quot;. SNIP
