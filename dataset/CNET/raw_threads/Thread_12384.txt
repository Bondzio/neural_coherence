When I push the power button on my computer it powers up and if I keep it pushed in the the system will boot up ...but if I release the button the power will shut down...Ideas? solutions..?

Have you made any component changes before this happened? If you have made any changes, I would think that you may have used the reset switch wires instead of the power on/off wires. Roger

All you need is to &quot;momentarily&quot; hit the ON/OFF sw. for it to turn on. If you keep depressing the sw., it will start to shutdown. That's normal for the system to do. The only thing I can think if it doesn't do this prorperly is a flaky sw. or one that gets stuck/sticky. These are simple sw. and shouldn't cause problems. I suggest maybe a quick squirt of WD-40 or similar at the sw. area if a sticky button, otherwise replace sw. if determined to be bad. good luck -----Willy
