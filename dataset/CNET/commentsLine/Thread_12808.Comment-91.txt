shanelle randisi and robert diaz are asus employees who dont know the warranty for the essentio desktop and will not honor it.
they told me i was not entitled to a replacement and then they sent 3 beat up refurbished units with the sane disc drive defects for my brand new one that they could not fix.
they refuse to give me a new one as the warranty states.
i called consumer affairs and bbb and shanelle lied to both of them to avoid honoring my warranty.
randisi refers to a customer who wants what he is entitled to a &quot;pain&quot;.
she said this in an email and the company actually was forced to apologize.
so unprofessional, dishonest, worthless, and ******.
never again
