Hi all, I have recently tried to install a new video card into my old computer, the computer was built by me so its not as if I'm just bolting parts to an OEM.
In any case I installed the new video card (XFX Radeon HD 4650, AGP) Into my pc and it looks like safe mode, I have tried to uninstall and reinstall the drivers multiple times, using the drivers off the install disk, and the newest ones from ATI/AMD.
Still get a safe mode-like screen.
I put my old card back in it (ASUS X850 Extreme) and it worked.
So, I was wondering if there is maximum amount of graphics a mother board could handle?
Here are my specs: Well...
I reached the end of the allowed characters...
I will post in a reply.
