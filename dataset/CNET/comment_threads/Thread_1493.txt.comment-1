I HAVE JUST RECENTLY BUILT A PC, EPOX MB,INTEL P4-1.8 G 512 MB PC2100 RAM, .
THE POWER SUPPLY SEEMS TO BE WORKING FINE AND NO PROBLEMS BOOTING OR RUNNING.
HOWEVER I HAVE NOTICED THAT EVEN WHEN THE PC I SHUTDOWN THE CASE SEEM WARM WHERE THE POWER SUPPLY IS LOCATED.
I HAVE BUILT SEVERAL OTHER PC BEFORE BUT HAVE NOTICED THE HEAT BUILD UP.
ANY IDEAS
