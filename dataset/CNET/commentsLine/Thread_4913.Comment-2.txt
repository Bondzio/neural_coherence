what will the rig be used for... gaming?
anything heavy duty like video editing?
every day use?
what case do you have?
are thinking of doing any overclocking or running stock?
what is the total budget constraint?
are you set on amd?
personally, i would step up to either the 9850 or 9950 for an extra $25.
i have used both and am now on the am3 deneb 940 which is pretty cool but pricey @ $230.
the first mobo is a micro... do you have a micro case?
the other should be fine if that is you spending limit.
for $5 more, i would step up to this harddrive..  same thing but a 32mb cache and a bit faster.
what are you using xp or vista, and 32 bit or 64 version.
32 bit versions are inherently limited in system memory to something around 3 gb.
i am building a system right now and using xp home just for overclocking and it &quot;sees&quot; 3.3 gb of my 4 gb installed.
do you already have a monitor?
is it high resolution?
i like ati cards myself, and could not really offer much advice.... i have used both the 4850 and 4870, both are good cards.
i like this one and not too far over the $150.
these cards are big, and this one takes up space with the cooler on it, but 4850's tend to run on the hot side, and this fan setup is nice if you are a gamer...not as noisy as most reference card fans.
but it would block one of the pci slots on your second asus board choice, so you would have to know if you need both those slots...there are other 4850's which don't take up two slots.
psu....  or  .... both would have a little headroom and are solid.
both are modular... not know what case you have with how much room, i figured it might be good to have the ability to reduce clutter and help cable managment.
airflow will be important with a phenom system.
hope some of this helps steve
