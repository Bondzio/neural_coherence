Short answer: NO Why, that isn't as easy as it seems.
The CMOS battery does hold bios info setting and if they started not act accordingly it could cause a problem, but its not suppose to as long as battery life is present even if weak.
It should really start to fail, not slow down and usually a slow clock is the result and nothing else, excluding any other reference to &quot;timing&quot;.
If the timing is wholly dependant then yes, because the clock cycles take longer and in fact allow the system to slow down, as the system is dependant on those &quot;cycle rates&quot;.
Its logic at it worse, working but not at the rated value.
good luck -----Willy
