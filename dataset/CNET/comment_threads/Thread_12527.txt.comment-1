I'm looking into buying a Portable external hard drive.
I need something lightweight (&lt;1lb) but would also like the maximum capacity.
I've narrowed it down to 2 options.
1.Western Digital Passport- 120GB USB 2.0 - 2.5&quot; External Hard Drive OR 2.Seagate Portable ST9100801U2 External 100GB Hard Drive The Western Digital only has 2MB cache.
The Seagate offers 8MB cache and 2 USB connections &quot;for improved performance&quot; but the hard drive is 20GB smaller.
Recommendations??
?
