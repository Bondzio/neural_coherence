in some wireless routers, the wired connection dominates the wireless channels causing the situation you describe.
http://www.tomsnetworking.com/index.html has reviews of many popular routers.
to test your connection, go to http://www.dslreports.com/stest or http://www.bandwidthplace.com/speedtest/ or http://reviews.cnet.com/7004-7254_7-0.html these tests won't reflect your true upper limit but you should see at least 1mbps.
the best way to check your true limit is to kick off some newsgroup downloads from comcast's news servers.
since those servers are 'local', they should be able to fill your pipeline.
i use roadrunner any peg my connection at 7.1mbps with 2 simutaneous transfers.
