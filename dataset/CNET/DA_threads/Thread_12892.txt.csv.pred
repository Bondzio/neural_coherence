1.1.1	i was wondering which processor is better .	St
1.1.2	the 64 4000+ or the X2 4200+ , if the 4000+ is better then would it be better to get the 64 3800+ ?	Ques
1.1.3	The 4000+ is only a bit cheaper that the 4200+ .	St
1.2.1	The X2 4200 is certainly better than a non-X2 4000. and life goes on ... Jack	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	you want to try and get dual core if u can but the x2 4200+ runs very hot i have it in my computer and it works great but it has some major heating issues ... this is actually my second 4200+ the first fried from overheating .	St
1.5.1	Do you have a PC manufactured by Gateway , HP or someother company or have you designed your own system .	St
1.5.2	I was wondering how these systems were working and if there were any problems .	St
1.5.3	I 'm thinking about purchasing an X2 or Pentium D based system .	St
1.5.4	I 'm also wondering about Sony , HP etc .	St
1.5.5	After using my Sony Notebook w/PII for over six years with out a problem and My P4 1.5 Sony Desktop for the last 5 years .	St
1.5.6	I purchased a Compaq Notebook w a 64bit AMD I have nothing against AMD but am not happy with the noteboods quality , ie : the transformer power cord falls out of the back of the computer .	St
1.5.7	I 've also had to replace the transformer after one year .	St
1.5.8	My Sony notebook never had one problem .	St
1.5.9	Send me any feedback you can .	St
1.6.1	... especially HP .	St
1.6.2	I 've had tons of problems with it overheating and shutting down .	St
1.6.3	I put it in a new , bigger case with better airflow , and it still shut down randomly .	St
1.6.4	I gave it to another nerd that I know , and he tried another P4 in it , and had to shut it down because the CPU reached like 200 degrees Farenheit .	St
1.6.5	He put my chip ( P4 540 ; 3.2GHz ) on his motherboard , and it shut down on him as he was reinstalling Windows .	St
1.6.6	The comptuer was an overstock , so there 's no warranty .	St
1.6.7	So far , I 've paid $ 76 for the case and $ 60 to the nerd .	St
1.6.8	I 'll probably have to spend about $ 300 to replace the CPU and motherboard , and another $ 50 to replace the crappy no-name-brand power supply ( if a power supply fails , the system goes ; bad ) .	St
1.6.9	Lesson learned : $ h ! t happens , and sometimes you 're the one paying for it .	St
1.6.10	Also , I 'm never buying another comptuer ; from now on , I 'm building my own .	St
1.7.1	i am going to get the Antec P180 as my case and to cool the CPU a Thermaltake Big Typhoon or mini Typhoon .	St
1.7.2	Will the Big Typhoon or Mini Typhoon cool the X2 4200+ enough ?	Ques
1.8.1	i got the temp to go down by replacing the 92 fan in the back with two highpowered 80 's	St
1.9.1	the mini typhoon is getting somewhat so-so reviews ( only a bit better cooling than the amd stock hs/fan ) .	St
1.9.2	if you want a quieter system , it 'll do that ; but if you want a quieter and cooler system , look elsewhere .	St
1.9.3	have you consider arctic cooling 's freezer 64 pro ?	Ques
1.10.1	well i would suggest that if its for gaming get the 4000+ well get the x2 4200+ for mutimedia etc.but u must get a least water cooling if u get the x2 4200+ .	Sug
1.11.1	... because I 've put it in a new case with an 80mm front fan , and a 120mm rear fan .	St
1.12.1	i wasnt replying to your post nathan .	St
1.12.2	i was replying to the one u replyed too .	St
1.12.3	look at the thread .	Sug
1.13.1	I do n't think that there is a need for water cooling if a fan can do the job .	St
1.13.2	It 's a waste of money and personally it takes up to much room in the Pc case , and wateer cooling is to fiddly .	St
1.14.1	Especially with an AMD X2 !	St
1.14.2	AMD features their 'cool 'n ' quiet ' technology which does indeed keep things cool and quiet .	St
1.14.3	Unless you 're going to lock the multiplier and overclock , etc , there should n't be any problems with overheating on the stock HSF , unless you 've got some other issues going on .	St
1.14.4	( Incidentally , I hear that the new HSFs that AMD is sending out with their CPUs are pretty decent and that spending 50 bucks to replace it with an aftermarket HSF is a waste of 50 bucks . )	St
1.14.5	One of my PCs is an HP with a 4200 X2 , an ATI graphics card , a 400W PSU and a little more memory- everything else is stock .	St
1.14.6	I 've had no problems with the system , even with moderate ( 'very high ' settings , not the highest settings ) gaming .	St
