I don't get what that argument is about.
Building your own PC with all the latest modcons for around 500 is sure to be cheaper than an iMac which is not far off 1000 if I recall correctly.
I don't quite understand the argument that Macs are cheaper than PCs.
They simply aren't.
As for your ideas, if Apple did indeed make MacBooks so cheap then I indeed would buy one, but their prices at the moment are just too expensive.
I can easily acquire a 300 pound machine if I wanted whereas I'd have to pay double for one with an Apple on it and most likely a less powerful graphics card.
Your ideas are brilliant, but I doubt there's even an iota of a chance that Apple would do such a thing.
Come on, look how much they charge still for the Mac Mini?
