<s> I recently clicked on a theme in the display properties that turned all of my windows black. </s>
<s> I cannot see anything to switch it back. </s>
<s> I tried to delete the theme, but it is still on my desktop and showing black windows. </s>
<s> How can I remove this theme? </s>
<s> switching to a new theme through the Control Panel? </s>
<s> Could also be the case where the program was actually a virus, in which case, I would follow the wisdom of Grif (post 4 of 8) http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6122_102-0.html?threadID=389911&tag=forums06;forum-threads </s>
<s> have you tried ... switching to a new theme via the control panel? </s>
<s> yes, but unable to see because the windows are black. </s>
<s> have tried a registry cleaner as well, but the theme is still active. </s>
<s> is there a manual way to unload the theme? </s>
<s> to bring up any programs on your computer, or is the screen completely black (no icons, internet access, etc. </s>
<s> )? </s>
<s> Yes, I can bring up other installed programs and see some or most of the programs functions and dialog boxes; but cannot see any windows dialog boxes or any windows within the OS. </s>
<s> Cannot see the display property window/themes to change the &quot;theme&quot;. </s>
<s> Having to guess where the ok/cancel buttons are. </s>
<s> It's in the &quot;owners&quot; profile. </s>
<s> Is there a way to unload personal settings for all of the users on a windows XP Home Edition OS? </s>
<s> Hi, I fixed it! </s>
<s> What I did ... </s>
<s> I created another profile, documented the key commands in the display property dialog box, and chose a plain windows theme. </s>
<s> Went back into the problem profile and went through the steps. </s>
<s> It worked! </s>
<s> This got rid of the corrupt theme and fixed the issue. </s>
<s> My thought .. there may have been some files missing on the problem theme that caused a glitch. </s>
<s> Thank you for all of your help! </s>
<s> Sincerely, Scharry PS. </s>
<s> No more 3rd party themes! </s>
