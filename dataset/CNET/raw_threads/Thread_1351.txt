I am looking for portable desktop replacement notebook, for graphic design and Arts. i have been looking at one mac notebook and two Gaming notebooks, the dell xps, the Alienware area51, and the Mac powerbook. I have an Imac G3, and i am comfortable using both mac and PC. Money is not an issue cause i want a good machine, wieght is not a problem cause i can use the workout, and battery life is not a problem cause i will buy an extra battery and mostly use it pluged in. that said, I have been looking at the Area-51 because it seems to have the most memory and two optical bays. it also has alot of customizing and seems to be a bit more upgradeable than most loptops. so i am asking if a Gaming notebook which is for game graphics and such, is a good machine for Graphic Arts.

The Dell XPS Gen 2 (the previous model of this machine) was tested against the best alienware machine and the Dell won.

Their top-of-the-line, the Area51 m770 can have 3.8GHz Processor (desktop), 3GB of RAM (533Mhz), the GeForce 7800GTX, Dual Hard Drives (Totaling about 200GB of 7,200RPM), Dual Optical Drives, and lots of extras... It seems faster than the Dell. The only thing that worries me is the heat.. Hopefully, you may have a heat-resitant table around. No, I'm joking but these laptops CAN get rather hot and I've read laptops on laps are not the best idea for men....I'm not assuming are one, but I'm just saying.... Anways, to me the Alienware seems better.

Not that Alenware is bad, but I do think that the Dell XPS M140 or the Toshiba Qosmio G25-AV513 are better choices. These are monsters that can do any graphics work you can throw at it and can play any game today. I would prfer the Toshiba Qosmio over the Dell XPS M140 because the Qosmio comes with a TV tuner so you can watch T.V. from your laptop, and overall it's a gigantic media center pc with a host of media center functions.

I can not see any XPS notebooks at Dell with anything but the M processor and getting information from Dell is next to impossible. Based on this experience alone, Im very leery of even getting involved with Dell.

This goes for desktops and notebooks. If anything has an XPS you are allowed in this elitle group. Anyway the difference between the P4 and an M is that the M is a fast notebook processor. The M reduces size of a notebook and gives better battery life. With a P4 in a notebook, you get a large mammoth laptop, that overheats alot(it is a desktop processor)and you barely get any battery life. The P4 is basically a desktop processor in a notebook. Don't get a P4, you are better off with an M.

Pentium 4	Pentium M's such as my XPS M170's 2.23Ghz processor is capable of clocking at about the equivelant of a P4 3.6Ghz processor, but it largely depends on the aplication. Obviously there's no Hyper Threading technology on the &quot;M&quot; series and the FSB maxes out at 533mhz. That's because the &quot;M&quot; has a Pentium 3 architecture. There are some really good articles on the net if you look closes that will give a more acurate technical description. If you're buying a laptop forget about getting one with a P4. It is too hot and you'll get no battery life. If you think you don't need the battery, get a desktop.
