i have a fairly new computer (close to 2 years) and i want to upgrade my processor.
i just hope this is the only thing i have to upgrade, heh.
i'm not sure what will affect what.
my current setup is: athlon 1800+(or 1700 i forget, how can i check?)
gigabyte athlon/duron compatible motherboard pny geforce 4 4400 256 mb ram 400 watt antec power supply creative audigy soundcard windows 98se i want to upgrade the processor and ram.
is it possible for me to install 2200/2400 amd on the same motherboard?
and is another 256 of memory not over-doing it?
i know i have enough memory slots?
thanks for any help recieved.
ps.
cheapest place to buy hardware/cases?
