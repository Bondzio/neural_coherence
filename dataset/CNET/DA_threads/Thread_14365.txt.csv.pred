1.1.1	Which one would you get AMD Athlon 64 X2 or Intel Core ( TM ) 2 Duo .	St
1.2.1	tomshardware.com you can take the CPU comparison for a spin then decide for yourself .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	hp has a few pavillions that are just about identical except for the platform ( intel vs amd ) .	St
1.3.2	for the same price , an athlon x2 4800+/5000+ pc is a faster choice than a core2duo e4300/e4400/e6300/e6320 .	St
1.4.1	The two computers I was looking at were HP a6030n with AMD Athlon 64 X2 dual-core processor 4800+ Graphics NVIDIA GeForce 6150 SE HP a1740n with Intel Core2 Duo processor E6300 Graphics Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950 The pice difference is $ 5.00	St
1.5.1	here 's a comparison of a HP Pavilion a1630n ( Athlon 64 X2 4600+ ) and a HP Pavilion a1640n ( Core2Duo E6300 ) .	St
1.5.2	http : //www.sharkyextreme.com/hardware/article.php/3673796 The X2 4800+ will give you slightly better performance than the E6300 .	St
1.6.1	Definitely AMD one !	St
1.6.2	I own both AMD & Intel ... they are now 8 months old , & I Bet the AMD is still as fast as it was the first day !	St
1.6.3	& ya , AMD has worked a lot on Heat produced by the processor .	St
1.6.4	That does it all !	St
1.7.1	Battlefield for instance is a non-starter .	St
1.7.2	So unless you put in some 3D card that system is not so good .	St
1.7.3	It has the better CPU according to the charts .	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	MMMM i would go for the hp HP a6030n with AMD Athlon 64 X2 dual-core processor 4800+ Graphics NVIDIA GeForce 6150 SE First th processor is the same speed it may differ a little bit but the Intel graphics arent recommended however i experiences the 6150 LE video card and it can run new games with considerble graphics but look if u are looking for gaming i dont recommend HP	St
1.9.1	http : //www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/intel/showdoc.aspx ? i=2802 & p=5 the e6300 'wins ' most SYSmark timings compared to a 4600+ , but in 80 % of the other benchmarks , an x2 4600+ is equal to or faster an e6300 .	St
1.9.2	so an x2 4800+ is definitely faster than a e6300 ( though the difference wo n't be noticeable in typical activities . )	St
1.9.3	P.S .	St
1.9.4	: tomshardware has never included the e6300 in its charts .	St
1.10.1	How do the 2 units compare for total Watts ?	Ques
1.10.2	Bob	St
1.11.1	I used toms before and scaled it around near enough CPUs .	St
1.11.2	My results were too close to call and given the difference in Watts I gave my nod to the C2D .	St
1.11.3	Bob	St
1.12.1	performance per watt is about the only area that amd has a consistent lead of intel .	St
1.13.1	Thanks for the update .	St
1.14.1	I was in the same quandary just last week for the same two desktops .	St
1.14.2	I even bought the 6030 but returned as soon as i found an open box at Sams Club for an HPm7767c , E6600 processor , 2 gigs ram , 600 gb harddrive , nvidia 7500 , and a 22 inch monitor for a spanking 849.99 ! ! !	St
1.14.3	The the e6300 beats the amd in many areas , and vice versa .	St
1.14.4	but i still would have gone with the amd for its more stylish casing , graphics card , and faster baseline processor speed .	St
