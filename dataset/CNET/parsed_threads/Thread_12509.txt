<s> My dad bought me an iPad last month at best buy, but I dont like the rubber case that he purchased it with. </s>
<s> Any of the girls or guys on the forum that can give a sense of direction on where I can find a leather ipad case? </s>
<s> I went back to best buy, but they don't seem to have much of a collection for women. </s>
<s> I also checked online for a women's case, but I am not convinced they are made of real leather. </s>
<s> I welcome any person that has bought a case that they are happy with. </s>
<s> Please post any pics or the brand, or where you bought your ipad case. </s>
<s> Thanks everyone! </s>

<s> it had a horrible smell. </s>
<s> http://www.goincase.com/ipad/ I have the &quot;grip&quot; in black it is made of soft silicon but mine does not have the bumps in the photo. </s>
<s> It is very good & heavy but protect my iPad very well, I have dropped my iPad a few times on the hardwood floors no problem. </s>
<s> When not in use I have a red &quot;Casecrown&quot; made to be used for netbooks but it fits just right & has a pocket, it has memory foam inside for added protection, unlike most out there. </s>
<s> You have two options out there, cool looking but provides little to no real protection or dull & boring but protects. </s>
<s> I picked option 2, I do not feel like shelling out another $800. </s>
