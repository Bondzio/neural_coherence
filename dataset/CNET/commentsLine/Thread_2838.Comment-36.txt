i did try it in my brother's bytech external case and when we put the drive in his case it would not show up in my computer and when we went into disk managment it would just hang up and never show the drive but as soon as we turned the power to the case off...disk managment would start working again.
also his case has an activity light that flashes green when his drive is in it but when we tried my drive it would light up red/orange and just be solid...no flashing at all.
also when i put his drive in my case it worked fine.
his drive is a wd 100gb.
another thing...when my drive is in the case and you turn it on windows says &quot;usb mass storage device&quot; down by the system tray...but when i put my brother's drive it my case it actaully had info about the drive like &quot;wd 100gb usb...&quot; i guess i'll try to contact vantech again to see what they have to say before i try to return it.
it just seems odd that another drive would work fine and this stupid seagate piece of junk won't work.
i just don't get it.
