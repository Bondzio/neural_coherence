i am using a microsoft mn-500 router for my wireless network and it has worked fine up until we got dsl.
i plugged the dsl into the router to get wireless internet.
this worked for a couple of days then my range was shortened.
i have the router downstairs and one of my computers up stairs, it always ued to get ''very good'' signal and now it is ''low'', ''very low'', or ''no signal''.
i also get limited or no connectivity.
any suggestions?
i'm not sure if the dsl has anything to do with the problem.
