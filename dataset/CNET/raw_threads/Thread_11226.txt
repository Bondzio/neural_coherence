I've got and Athlon 64 3700+, a quality heatsink and some leftover Artic Silver 5. I've noticed that the Artic Silver site ( http://www.arcticsilver.com/arctic_silver_instructions.htm ) when referring to the AMD 64's, it says that it's ''more important'' to cover the CPU core rather than the whole heat spreader from corner to corner. I've always had very good luck spreading a super thin layer on a processors core in the past... should I really not apply a thin layer to the entire heat spreader? Is it a bad idea in general, or simply a waste of compound? If I follow the instructions and simply apply a drop (3/4 size of a bb) to the center of the heat spreader, I'll never see exactly how well the compund was spread when I applied the heatsink, which makes me uncomfortable. Am I being silly? Thanks. ~Wayne

Seems that they want you to know that the CPU chip itself is only about 1 sq inch and thus is only a small portion of the heat spreader. Seems that they simply want you to know that you MUST get the compound on the specific area where the CPU die contacts the heat spreader. If I remember correctly the CPU chip is not exactly in the center of the heat spreader. Thus if you get a nice uniform spread of the compound on most of the spreader you will include the most critical area.

This seemed surprising to me at the time. It's consistency dictates that you add the rice-sized drop and allow the application of the heatsink to do the work for you. I e-mailed Artic Silver and they said that using this method eliminates &quot;air gaps&quot;... and that if you &quot;pre-spread&quot; the compound before appyling you would most likely have air gaps. Off I go! Cheers. ~Wayne
