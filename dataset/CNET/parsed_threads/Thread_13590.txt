<s> I have always had a habit of buying Kingston memory (no particular reason), but I noticed that on NewEgg for instance, I can get 4GB of &quot;OCZ Gold&quot; for $250 whereas 4GB of Kingston HyperX is $390. </s>
<s> The Kingston also has a high latency of 9. </s>
<s> Basically, what am I missing about the price difference, since as far I can tell OCZ is another great memory maker? </s>
<s> Ram makers try to differentiate themselves by the quality and speed levels they can achieve. </s>
<s> Thus, you'll see the speed rating and some marketing label like &quot;premium, gold, extreme, basic or value, etc.&quot; put on them. </s>
<s> At the bottom will be good ram that meet the basic requirements and as you go from there, the ram should be more capable of speed or even OC'ing and/or heat tolerances. </s>
<s> Also, some gimcrackery may come into play but is suppose help in the long run, like heat shields or dispersers, LEDs, or color scheme. </s>
<s> The specs of the CAS/RAS should also be affected and offered as they meet those. </s>
<s> As for Kingston and OZ brands, they both good. </s>
<s> Sometimes, one brand has a sale going on to vendors and they pass on the saving. </s>
<s> Prices do vary from time to time. </s>
<s> One brand may command as they are suppose to be top offering at any given time, quality matters. </s>
<s> Review the specs of each brand offering and see how they stack up and choose. </s>

<s> kingston is so large and well-known that they don't have to compete on price. </s>
<s> you've always bought them because of their name, so the strategy obviously works. </s>
<s> recommended or guaranteed to work with your PC. </s>
<s> Often times motherboard mfgs provides a list of RAM that's compatible with your motherboard or system. </s>
<s> That's worth looking at. </s>
<s> If you shop at Newegg...then read the buyer reviews...pretty good info there too. </s>
