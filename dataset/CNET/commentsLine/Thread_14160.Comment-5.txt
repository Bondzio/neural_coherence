lucky for you to receive that message, other's don't, hence, they panic when their hdds bog down and they were not able to back-up their files.
do back-up your files while you still have the time, don't wait for your hdd to falter.
we all know that electronic parts however high quality made they are have a lifetime.
one reason why computer parts' costs had gone down is not because of over supply (the demand is real high - law of supply and demand) nor because of competition or cheaper production cost, but they do have shorter life span nowadays.
