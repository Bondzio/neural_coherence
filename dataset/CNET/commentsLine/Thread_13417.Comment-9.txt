are these good?
which is best?
i don't need a laptop, i have one from work and they overheat and are more expensive.
i want something reliable and fast as im impatient and short of time(i dont wanna wait 5 mins for a website to load).
is zoostorm better than hp?
is amd as good as intel?
will all these have slots for putting in another internal harddrive to get my data off it?
