Hi, I use Comcast for cable broadband.
I lost internet access for a period of time on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
After each outage, service would continue as usual.
The customer service rep at Comcast tested the modem remotely and said the problem was the modem, not the signal.
The unit is a Motorola SURFboard.
Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.
Thanks
