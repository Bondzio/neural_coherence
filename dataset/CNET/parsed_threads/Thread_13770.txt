<s> I need help to find an inkjet printer that does borderless on regular documents not only photos, (I am making fliers in CorelDraw 11 that I need to print borderless) can handle heavy cardstock, give me an excellent quality on text as well as photo, preferably envelopes also. </s>
<s> I have read a lot of reviews here on cnet.com and no printer stands out that much. </s>
<s> I need it for a small office with a farely high volume of printing. </s>
<s> would be to contact the sales dept. </s>

<s> They are best qualified to recommend a printer for your specific needs. </s>
<s> This way you'll have several to choose from. </s>
