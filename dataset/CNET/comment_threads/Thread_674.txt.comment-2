Epson now has printers out (the &quot;C&quot; series&quot;) that have chipped ink cartridges.
However, there are &quot;Ink Refill&quot; web sites that sell a chip that goes on the refillable cartridges that &quot;trick&quot; the printer in to thinking there is always a new or full ink Cartridge.
Check it out.
Pretty nifty.
I think www.inkjetsaver.com or www.universalinkjet.com are just two of those sites.
I have four Epsons and it is great to be able to refill them.
Plus, I have two Lexmarks (Z23 and Z611).
I just snap the tops off, refill and tape the tops down.
Refill kits show how - can buy them at WalMart..
