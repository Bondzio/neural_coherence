<s> Hello there, i'm running a HP G62 and trying to connect an iomega 1tb HDD and it shows up in &quot;devices and printers&quot; as USB to serial-ATA Bridge but not in my computer so i obviously can't access anything. </s>
<s> After surfing the web for an answer, everyone says i should give it a letter in computer management, but when i try the option to change the letter and path is grayed out so i can't click it=[ Can anyone please help? </s>
<s> Thankz! </s>
<s> A drive has to have a partition and format that Windows understands before all that works. </s>
<s> Your post does not reveal if this used to work or if it was new. </s>
<s> If it used to work, any story about loaning it to a friend or a drop is necessary. </s>
<s> The usual do it yourself recovery tools are a the top post in this forum. </s>

<s> yes it has worked before, and it works fine on other computers. </s>
<s> In disk management it shows up as Healthy(primary partition) but when i right click it, my options are limited to just view its properties. </s>
<s> Drivers claim to be updated as well. </s>
<s> I read it and thought it was a new drive. </s>
<s> Since it sounds like the old conflicting drive letter issue I wonder what other drive letters can be freed up. </s>
<s> For example in my (dead) HP G62 I could disable the SD CARD READER in device manager in a pinch. </s>
<s> I can't know what's not told and sorry about that. </s>
