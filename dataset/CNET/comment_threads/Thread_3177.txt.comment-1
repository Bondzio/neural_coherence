Hi, Don`t know if I can ask this here but maybe someone can help me.
I'f have a home sterio with nice 10&quot; speakers witch I connected to my pc for better sound with DVD's.
Problem is I can't come close to my screen, the magnets &quot;colorize&quot; my screen.
I would like to know if anyone know how I can try to Shield that speaker/box so I can get it closer to my screen?
Surely there must be some way to weeken the magnet's flied..Or am I haeding to a deadend??
If someone can help, please let me know.
Thanks OOPS
