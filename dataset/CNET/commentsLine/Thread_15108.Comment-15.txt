i've been sending emails back and forth to serveral computer places... the dell 9100 motherboard has a 24pin connection like an atx power supply... so as long as it will fit inside of my tower, will it work?
has anyone actually done this?
i need at least 500w with about 26-30amps to run the video card... i'd hate to downgrade the card i already bought to find one that will work with the 375w power supply... can't anyone really give me a straight answer of what will and won't work in my pc?
i'm pretty new to computer upgrades... so help me out!
