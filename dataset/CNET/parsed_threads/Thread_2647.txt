<s> A desktop PC having a CDRW/DVDRW combo drive or a desktop PC having two separate drives such as a CDRW in one drive and a DVDRW in a second drive? </s>

<s> I use two devices. </s>
<s> One is a simple CD/DVD reader and the other a burner. </s>
<s> The burner type depends on your needs. </s>
<s> One reason for this is so disks can be duplicated by copying directly to the burner and bypass the need to copy to the HD first. </s>
<s> I't just my personal choice. </s>
<s> With dual layer DVDRW drives under 99 bucks (much less) I can fit one of those and do-it-all. </s>
<s> Since a DVDROM drive can do all a CDROM can do and more, that may be in the second bay for easy CD dupes. </s>

<s> My experience tells me that a simple CDROM drive is much more capable of reading scratched or otherwise &quot;damaged&quot; disks than a writer or a combo. </s>
<s> I find that utilities like CDR Diagnostics, ISO buster etc are able to handle a wider range of the so called dead CD's in a simple CDROM drive than in other combined drive/writers. </s>
<s> As far as DVD's go, I'm not ready to make any observation as of now. </s>
<s> I've found CDRW drives to be more adept at reading so-so CDs. </s>
<s> My experience with the newer DVDRW drives is &quot;not enough time yet&quot; to write if I feel the same for them. </s>

<s> I want to take this time to thank everyone for their comments. </s>
