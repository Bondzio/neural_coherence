except creative.
vista eliminated the hardware abstraction layer that most all sound cards depended on so you wind up with only the generic sound support built-into vista.
you'll need to get an audigy x-fi if you want all of the bells and whistles you were accustomed to in xp.
creative is releasing better drivers for older cards like the audigy and live series, but their mostly for game support and won't give you the full feature set.
