yeah, get some good education, you won't regret it.
i've built three computers and when/if something goes wrong with them, i enjoy fixing the problem (because i know what is in the computer and how it is put together); and i've had absolutely zero regrets about building my own computer, i'll never go back to a pre-built piece of crap.
you just can't get past the quality of a homemade machine (so to speak).
with warranties and stuff wherever you buy your components, it should come with its own warranty; and you're your own tech support.
i purchase my components at  .
p.s.
don't worry about bios', because you just shouldn't upgrade bios', you'll have to build a whole new computer before you'll want to do that.
