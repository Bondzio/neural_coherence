the cd lens cleaner thing (or swab) is the usual.
i've resurrected 1 drive by finding latest firmware.
but with such a low success rate, i wonder if it should be on &quot;the list.&quot; the cost of having &quot;tech&quot; update the firmware on a dvd-rom exceeds what you can buy a dvd+/-r/w in just a few weeks.
