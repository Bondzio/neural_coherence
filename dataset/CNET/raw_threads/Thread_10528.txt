I searched online a bit and came up with the following list: 1. Midi tower ATX case, 400 Watt power, 23.49 2. Kingston memory 2GB 800MHz DDR2 non-ECC CL5 DIMM 29.36 3. Hannsg HI221D 22 TFT/LCD 139.99 4. WD Cavier 320GB SE SATA II hard drive 50.51 5. AMD64 x2 4800+ AM2 + Gigabyte M61PME-S2 motherboard 89.99 6. PCIe ATI Radeon 1300x pro (already have this) 7. Normal DVD ROM, keyboard, mouse, speakers etc Someone suggested me with another spec though, which he said was 10 cheaper but better in performance and hard drive size. 1. e2160 oc 3.0ghz + giga P31-ds3l 2. ocz 2g ddr800 cl5 3. samsung 500g 4. hannsg 22&quot; 5. hiper 425w My question is whether these two are reasonable specs for my budget of up to 350 excluding graphic cards and minor accessories. Thanks for your time.
