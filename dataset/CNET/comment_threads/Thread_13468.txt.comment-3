The Intel motherboard (P965 express chipset) which I plan to buy comes with the following notice: &quot;Notice: Only DDR2-800 memory supporting JEDEC approved 1.8V operation with timings of 5-5-5 or 6-6-6 is supported on Intel Desktop Boards based on Intel 965 Express Chipsets.&quot; (click on SPEC tab in http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16813121035 ) The dual channel package RAMs (Case 2) I found have 2.2V, 4-4-4-12 latency and cost about $70.
Since I could not find dual channel RAM packs with 1.8V and 5-5-5-12 latency, I was thinking of buying two individual identical RAMs which would meet the motherboard requirements.
The two RAMs cost higher - about $97 ($48.5 apiece) I am afraid of using the dual channel RAMs since they require about 2.2V for their operation (atleast, that is what I think so) whereas the motherboard would power them up only till 1.8V.
If you think the dual channel RAMs would still work fine, then I would be more than happy to go for them at $70.
