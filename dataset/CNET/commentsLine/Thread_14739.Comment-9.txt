this is a hand-down from a friend, but he had no problems with it...his dad just donated an 80gb hdd to him, which is why he gave this drive to me.
i've had it a few months, but its only been in the last week that its given me trouble...i think the new dvd drive being installed at around the same time is just a co-incidence.
no lawsuit for me =/
