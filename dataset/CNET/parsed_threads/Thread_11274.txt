<s> I have a hard drive that I want to install in another PC. </s>
<s> It already has WIN XP installed, I want to use it for storage only how can I remove the WIN XP or do I need to. </s>
<s> Also how can I tell if it is an Ultra ATA/133 or SATA. </s>
<s> It is a Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 9. </s>
<s> Thanks Woody </s>

<s> After you put it in the new computer, properly jumpered. </s>
