Computer 2 MB: ASUS A8V-VM CPU: AMD 64 3000+ RAM: 1 gigs This computer had one lan port on the MB rated 10/100 and has a addon pci lan port rated 10/100/1000/2000 (TRENDnet TEG-PCITXR) Right now on each computer the non 1000 lan ports are being used to connect to a router for the internet. The other two 1000 lan ports are connected together with a crossover wire rated CAT6 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16812117854 all the ips and gateways are setup and everything works but the speed. if you look at status and task manager it says the connection is 1gbps but when i transfer it only clips at 100 mbps. so in the task manager is only 1%. How can i sove my problem?

It didn't work well until we changed to this setup. internet-&gt;modem-&gt;router-&gt;1Gb Switched Hub-&gt;PCs. And you can imagine all the whining &quot;it should work...&quot; over and over but we had the 1Gb Hub so it didn't take long to setup. There's a lesson here somewhere but I won't write more about it. Bob
