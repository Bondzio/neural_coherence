and sold the system that way.
If anyone is to blame .

I'd say it's the salesperson at BB.
Not so much for suggesting the upgrade card but for not telling you about the additional power requirement and affect if any on the system warranty.
If it's any comfort ...you're not alone.
This happens often as people buy PCs off the shelf and afterwards start adding stuff.
At some point the system starts showing signs of instability or spontaneous reboots, etc., Let us know how it works out.
