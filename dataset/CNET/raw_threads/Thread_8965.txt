Now the Pro has a Core Duo so the Macbook c2d should have even closer performance if not equal. All this applies if you don't want graphical performance. Like if you edit photos or play games and stuff then I think the Pro would be better. Second thing is size. Which size do u prefer. If both are OK then go for what is important to you. Simply put if you need graphical performance then go for the Pro and if you dont then go for the Macbook. i would certainly go for the Pro.
