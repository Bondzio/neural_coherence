i'm a senior getting ready for college next year.
a little early, i know.
but this is the last christmas before college.
anyway, i have asked for a netbook (dell mini 10v).
however, i am torn between whether i should get the netbook or the money for it.
i plan on getting a macbook before college and hopefully apple will have a back to school deal.
i just dont know if it would be worth it.
my gut is it would, but i dont have both yet, so i cant be sure.
anyone have both a netbook and normal sized comp in a college environment?
what are you thoughts?
thanks
