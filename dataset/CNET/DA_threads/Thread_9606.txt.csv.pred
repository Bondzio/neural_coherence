1.1.1	Hey everybody.	St
1.1.2	I was thinking about buying a mac mini, and then I did and I love it, and then I started thinking about what a mac mini would be like on intel hardware.	St
1.1.3	Personally I would love to see the mac mini on a Pentium M proccessor with upgrades available up to 2GB of Ram.	St
1.1.4	And a graphics card to match.	St
1.1.5	I think at least an ATI X800Pro.	St
1.1.6	What hardware setups would you guys like to see the Mac Mini with?	St
1.1.7	POst Back.	St
1.1.8	Ngatiaruan.Prince	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Are you doing some marketing research or just indecisive?	St
1.3.2	You can read you older posts and your question is pretty much the same over and over.	St
1.3.3	Share what's up so we can find some answers for you.	St
1.3.4	Bob	St
1.4.1	Bob, I spotted the post and name immidiately also.	St
1.4.2	You don't miss a thing.	St
1.4.3	Simply amazing!	St
1.5.1	I wasn't aware that the mini would be shipping with Intel Hardware, I though it would possibly have an Intel processor but I hadn't heard that Intel were making all the other stuff inside it.	St
1.5.2	Oh well, sucks to be wrong.	St
1.5.3	I would like to see the new mini ship with Quad G5 @ 3Ghz, 32X DL Blue-Ray DVD, 4Gb RAM(expandable to 12Gb), 2 Terrabyte HD, Gigabit ethernet, NVIDIA Quadro FX 4500 Graphics card, (to drive my 2 30&quot; Cinema displays), Gigabit Wireless and Bluetooth 4.	St
1.5.4	Connectivity would include, but not be limited to, 4 Firewire 800/400 ports, 8 USB 2.0 ports, 2 Gigabit ethernet ports, Dolby 6.0 sound out and a Mic socket.	St
1.5.5	The graphics card already has dual DVI connectors.	St
1.5.6	Of course, the mini is far to bulky in its present form so a 38% reduction all round would be a start.	St
1.5.7	As this would be the low end version, I would expect the bottom line to be $399.00 with free shipping and 3 years, OnSite AppleCare.	St
1.5.8	Oh, I'm sorry.	St
1.5.9	I though we were being silly again, like the other posts you make.	St
1.5.10	P	St
1.6.1	Hey, yeah, basically I am doing marketing research... And also I just like hearing what other people think... Like people I son't personally know in person...	St
1.6.2	But yeah I am doing reasearch.	St
1.7.1	Yeh, I would love to see the mac mini with a Quad G5!	St
1.8.1	The Intel Mac Mini will come with the black iPod, 47 inch dual displays and 15 year warranty.	St
1.8.2	Support will be by help.com Hope this helps.	St
1.8.3	Bob.	St
1.8.4	PS.	St
1.8.5	In reality, I want the dual core 64-bit Mactel laptop.	St
1.9.1	Peter, I started to read your post and my eyes got bigger and bigger!	St
1.9.2	My, what a Mac mini that would be.	St
1.9.3	That is so funny!	St
1.9.4	A little bit of English humor here?	St
