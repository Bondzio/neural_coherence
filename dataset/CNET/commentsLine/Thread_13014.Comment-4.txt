hi- i too am having a terrible time getting my new scanner to scan properly.
i'm running on an hp with windows xp, don't think my computer is the problem.
when scanning slides, i get half the photo green, half red.
anybody have any idea what would be causing this?
it's a brand new scanner, i have yet to have any useable scans completed.
grrrrrr...
