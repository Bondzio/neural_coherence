1.1.1	Hey everyone .	St
1.1.2	I 'm looking for a NAS System .	St
1.1.3	I really do n't want a noisy External HD in my room on at all times next to my Sony Vaio laptop , so I 'm looking at a NAS for my home Network so I can leave it on downstairs and access it anytime .	St
1.1.4	I 've been looking tirelessly at the options reviewed by CNet , but ca n't seem to find the right solution .	St
1.1.5	I want something that ... - Can accept a 250GB+ NTFS FileSystem ( for importing video ... I pass that 4GB mark after 18 minutes of recording ) - Has a RJ45 port for my router as well as Firewire/USB Connections ( for a direct connection to my laptop if I need additional speed , or the network stops working ... ) - Can be accessed via FTP ( If possible ... so I can access my NAS anywhere ) The challenge is to find something that can accomadate all this .	St
1.1.6	Does anyone have any idea what I should consider buying ?	Ques
1.1.7	http : //cgi.ebay.com/300-GB-NAS-Network-Attached-Storage-USB-2-0-Hard-Drive_W0QQitemZ8822363384QQihZ005QQcategoryZ116258 QQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem This 300GB NAS Drive seems to meet almost all my wants , but the FAT32 HD ca n't be converted ... there must be something out there like this that supports NTFS .	St
1.1.8	The guy selling it also seems to get a lot of complaints about the NAS systems he sells , so I do n't really want to buy it .	St
1.2.1	First the problem with FAT32 is that the maximum filesize is 4 gigabyte .	St
1.2.2	For our office our first NAS was given away due to that limit .	St
1.2.3	Next the real issue came home is even at 100 megabit the transfer rates are quite slow .	St
1.2.4	Your average USB 2.0 is some double to quadruple that speed .	St
1.2.5	The internal drive double or more than again .	St
1.2.6	See the Slowski 's commercial ?	Ques
1.2.7	With a little google you can find other NAS with the better Linux or NTFS ( file systems ) and maybe you can more to gigabit network speeds to cure the speed issue .	St
1.2.8	I now have the Dlink NAS , but the speed issue is still there until we upgrade the network switch to gigabit speed .	St
1.2.9	In closing , I think you 'll be disappointed even if the filesystem is fixed .	St
1.2.10	Bob	St
1.3.1	I see ... thank you for your response .	Polite
1.3.2	If speeds are an issue , I may have to live with an External HD in my room .	St
1.3.3	Speed is important when I import from Adobe Premiere , so I may have to live with a noisy HD in my room .	St
