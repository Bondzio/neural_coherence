they are just called jbl62 exactly, thy are older but today i just bought the promedia 2.1 and my left satellite distorts around half volume.
i'm also finding out that the sub can't take much at anything close to half volume.
am i missing a setting or something?
i'm wondering if my jbl 62 speakers can replace the klipsch speakers so it doesn't distort on me.
