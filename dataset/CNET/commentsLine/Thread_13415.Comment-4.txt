the hub will be fine until you get a dsl or cable internet connection.
the other computers won't be able to use the internet unless the compaq is connected.
make sure the nic's are on and are connected to the hub.
check your network settings on each pc.
&quot;file and print sharing&quot; must be selected.
&quot;tcp/ip internet protocol&quot; must be present and selected.
be certain file sharing on the harddrives you want to share is activated.
good luck!
ciao
