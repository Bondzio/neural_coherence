1.1.1	for printing colour photos , images from Illustrator which printer do you think is better : Canon PIXMA iP4300 or Hp Photosmart D7160 ?	Ques
1.1.2	and also which of both printers will be less expensive to get ink cartridges	St
1.2.1	Okay , as for what is cheaper to keep , go with the Canon .	St
1.2.2	The cartridges have a larger volume of ink ( about double what the HP has ) for only $ 4 more per color , and is cheaper on the black .	St
1.2.3	Now if you are doing more graphical work , I would actually recommend the Canon Pixma iP6700 .	St
1.2.4	The 4300 is okay , but the 6700 gives you the two photo or light colors , and get 's rid of the text ( pigment ) black .	St
