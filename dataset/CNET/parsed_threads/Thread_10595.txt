<s> Hi, I have problem with my dell 1525. </s>
<s> After a full battery discharge, I plugged the power and tried to turn it on. </s>
<s> All the lights turn on, but after a second it goes silent and I cannot see anything on the screen even the dell logo. </s>
<s> Please someone to help me.. </s>
<s> I am in the middle of exam session and I need it.. asap. </s>
<s> I also tried to remove the battery and the power cord, pressed the power button for 30sec, doesn't help. </s>
<s> Later today I will try to remove the RAM and then install it one by one to see if the problem may be caused by bad RAM , but I doubt that this is the solution. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>

<s> Hi, doesn't help, even removed the hard drive to see if the strange beep sound appears, but no, nothing happens. </s>
<s> Removed the RAM memory and tried both slots with both sticks.. again nothing happens. </s>
<s> Be sure to unplug USB devices too. </s>
<s> Still strange to discharge batteries. </s>
<s> There's some bad advice going around and if the battery/system is old you can lose a board by doing that. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> If it's working, don't fix it. </s>
<s> If this was caused by the discharge of the battery this laptop deserves to be thrown out of the window.. </s>
<s> I needed the laptop outside with no power supply .. </s>
<s> I am also not fan of discharging the batteries .. </s>
<s> If someone still have a possible solution please let me know Thanks </s>
<s> At the age I'm guessing this is, some try to discharge the battery to regain some life. </s>
<s> But an old battery can cause the power supply or motherboard stress if the battery has issues. </s>
<s> I have yet to see anyone discharge a battery unless the battery was old and failing. </s>
<s> Seems a lesson is being learned first hand. </s>
<s> Wish there was more to the story. </s>

<s> It seems that my story will end up like this : http://vbox7.com/play:e7ea30d715 </s>

<s> Actually, the battery is almost new. </s>
<s> I've used it for a month or 2 max.. </s>
<s> So, I don't think this is the problem. </s>
<s> Also, I cant get to the windows </s>
<s> Meting out details means I can only guess why it does that. </s>
<s> The discharge the battery is a clue albeit not a good one. </s>
<s> I only see folk do that in some attempt to fix a battery but it's just a bad idea if the machine has issues. </s>
<s> Now you write about Windows but your first post says that even the Dell logo is not showing. </s>
<s> Has anything changed? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4LgI0VSfnM This video is shows a program on windows, graphic interface. </s>
<s> I still can't see the dell logo, I can't hear the beep of removed HDD . </s>
<s> I can press the button of the CD and it ejects .. still only the power LED is ON, nothing has changed. </s>
<s> Shows Battery Bar which is something I thought I'd toss out there if you ever want to know about battery wear and status again. </s>
<s> Since Windows is not coming up, it sounds like a fried board and the clues so far about the discharged battery are why I am coming down to fried board. </s>
