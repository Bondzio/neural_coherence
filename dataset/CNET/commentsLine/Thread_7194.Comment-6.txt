this is a computer with a 633 mhz cpu, 256 mb ram, a 4x cd-rw drive, and a 14x cd-rom.
i'm seriously considering scrapping this computer and trying to salvage anything useful (not much!
), but i actually didn't buy it, it was given to me for free, and i know why.
i can, however, use the hard drive, which will be the most useful part of the whole computer!
