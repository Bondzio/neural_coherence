1.1.1	My PC would not recognize my monitor .	St
1.1.2	I tried another monitor but nothing .	St
1.1.3	I plugged my monitor into another connector on back of the PC and now the monitor works but I keep getting an error message after restart : & quot ; The ATI Control Panel failed to initialize because no ATI driver is installed or ATI driver not working properly. & quot ; What is causing this ?	Ques
1.1.4	Is there is special connector on back of PC for monitors only ?	Ques
1.1.5	Can I install/buy a new connector ?	Ques
1.1.6	If so , where do I purchase them ?	Ques
1.2.1	an add in video card .	St
1.2.2	As for a special connector ... .yes ... .and there are two popular types .	St
1.2.3	One is for analog output and the other for digital .	St
1.2.4	An analog type will be 3 rows of 5 pins .	St
1.2.5	Digitals vary a bit but are also 3 rows of pins in a larger connector .	St
1.2.6	You can not accidentally plug a video cable into a port not meant for it .	St
1.2.7	In any event , it 's possible your PC had on board ( motherboard ) video that was disabled and a higher performance card added instead .	St
1.2.8	This could account for no output from that port .	St
1.2.9	As for your error message , that sounds like you just need to find and install the correct driver .	St
1.2.10	It 's a simple task if you know the model of your ATI card .	St
1.2.11	You did n't say anything about your PC , it 's hardware , whether it ever worked , etc .	St
1.2.12	Knowing these details would help .	St
1.3.1	What do you need to know about my PC ?	Ques
1.3.2	The monitor has been working fine for the past 2 years .	St
1.3.3	I did have power loss 3 times the other day maybe that did something to the video card .	St
1.3.4	I take it I can not just replace the connector on back of the PC because it 's attached to a video card ?	Ques
1.3.5	As you can see , I 'm not real technical but I am willing to learn and like & quot ; hands on & quot ; learning .	St
1.4.1	Because you mentioned two places to plug in a monitor you 're going to have to figure out if one connects to the motherboard and the other to a separate video card .	St
1.4.2	And , do you know if moving the cable to the other port is what gave you some response on the screen ?	Ques
1.4.3	It 's possible that a port on the motherboard that 's been disabled could be re-enabled during a power lose under some circumstances .	St
1.4.4	If that 's the case , that disabled video device may not have had a driver installed because it did n't need one .	St
1.4.5	If you know you had a separate video card and could confirm it to be dead , you could use the motherboard video by installing a driver for it .	Sug
1.4.6	What would be needed would be the Radeon chip model .	St
1.4.7	You 'd need to know your motherboard model or , if you could open the case and look inside , you might find an ATI chip with the model on it .	St
1.4.8	Depending on the age of the PC , two common ones had been the 7500 and 9600 .	St
1.4.9	But , if it 's on your motherboard your best if you have it is the motherboard driver disk .	St
1.4.10	Any chance of that ?	Ques
1.5.1	Steve - my neighbor is really good with hardware on PC 's .	St
1.5.2	I 'm going to have him take a look at it when he gets a chance .	St
1.5.3	I do n't really want to fool around inside the PC .	St
1.5.4	I appreciate all your help with this .	Polite
