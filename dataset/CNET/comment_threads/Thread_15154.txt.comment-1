I'm planing to buy a 3G router for my MTS Datacard(3.1Mbps).I would like to know if it supports my ZTE AC 2766 Modem(MTS Mblaze)(India) or can you suggest me other routers which may be compatible.I need to share my internet connection to my android phone,printer,PC and Laptop.I've checked some of the brands like Edimax-6128n,Iball-3g+Wi Fi,Tenda,Tp-link routers but I'm confused as to which to buy and which is compatible.
