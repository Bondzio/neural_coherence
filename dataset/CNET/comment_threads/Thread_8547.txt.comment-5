I use a Targus notebook chill mat for my 12&quot; Powerbook.
It works pretty well but it might be a bit small for your laptop.
My boyfriend has a 15&quot; widescreen laptop and got an Antec notebook cooler.
It has two (two-speed) fans and the surface is large enough to cover the entire base of his laptop.
The only annoyance may be that the Antec has a bright blue LED light that turns on when you have the fan plugged in (via USB).
Otherwise, it might be the best one for you.
