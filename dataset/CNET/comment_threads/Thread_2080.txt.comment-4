Are you losing the actual wireless signal?
No signal strength on the laptops and does the WLAN light on the router go off?
If that's the case, then I'm thinking the router is faulty or possibly the NIC in your desktop is bad.
Test by connecting a laptop by wire to the router and turn it off as you did with the desktop.
If the problem reoccurs, then it's likely the router is bad.
If you are just losing access to your network (wireless still operates but can't access resources/internet), then it's likely some kind of configuration problem.
You may want to refer to the forum sticky for network setup tips.
