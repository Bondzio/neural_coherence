http://reviews.cnet.com/routers/netgear-wndr3700-rangemax-dual/4505-3319_7-33485574.html#reviewPage1 does not mention Draft N but I could have missed it.
The product page at Netgear.com notes &quot;IEEE 802.11n version 2.0&quot;.
I can only guess where you read Draft versus &quot;version.&quot; Bob
