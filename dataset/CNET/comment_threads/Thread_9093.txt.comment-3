You need to give a lot more info to get this right.
What brand/model server do you have?
Is it a brand name or a clone?
Is there even room inside for more drives?
Are the existing drives SCSI or IDE (many servers use SCSI drives).
You might consider adding a Snap Server to the network to add disk space instead of adding more drives to the system.
