Hi Ok, sorry if this is in the wrong section, im new here.
Today I bought myself a macbook pro (running version 10.6) and have had trouble with my connection.
My router is a WRT54 GS ver.6, i have had it around a year.
I have a ps3, xbox, 2 wired windows PC and a windows laptop all connectiong to it, (Windows XP) without any problems.
I plug the macbook in via an ethernet cable and it recognises it but cannot connect.
I have an unprotected belkin router near my house which the macbook can connect to with ease.
any ideas on why my macbook wont connect with the linksys, if you need further information just ask.
Thanks Jk.
