<s> between pentium D, Core 2 Duo nd AMD 3800 X2, which 1 is the best? </s>
<s> wat's the cache use 4? </s>
<s> pentium D nd Core 2 Duo offer 2mb while AMD 3800 X2 offer only 256/512 kb cache..........plz help... </s>
<s> At tomshardware.com he has the CPU CHARTS and if the new chips are not on the charts then you can read reviews to get the new performance numbers. </s>
<s> Make a spreadsheet with the CPUs that you are considering and sort by the winner. </s>

<s> what is cache use for? </s>
<s> AMD offer only 512kb while intel offer more than 2mb.........is it make any differences?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> While I can write &quot;doesn't matter&quot; since at the end all that matters is the benchmarks, the truth be known that you can find that answer with google.com or ask.com. </s>
<s> I could tell you that L1 cache is good because it's at zero wait states but that possibly will just create more questions. </s>
<s> If you want to learn about CPU architecture then hit the web or take classes. </s>
<s> If you want to know the fastest CPUs then you just get the benchmark results. </s>
<s> What's your goal here? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The new Intel Core 2 Duo processors are AMAZINGLY FAST. </s>
<s> They destroy everything in their path. </s>
<s> Regardless of whether you're playing games, encoding video or editing pictures, the C2D gives the best performance. </s>
<s> I believe the price for these CPUs is very good too. </s>
<s> Now, if you're just looking to surf the web and little else, then you can get by with a cheap $80 Celeron but with the E6300 costing only $180 right now, it's a killer deal. </s>
<s> If I was building a PC right now, I'd look at the E6700 and E6600 CPUs which run around $530 and $340 respectively. </s>
<s> Each have 4MB L2 cache. </s>
<s> I'm very excited right now with Intel because they have reclaimed the CPU Performance crown from AMD plus have quad core versions coming out soon known as &quot;Kentsfield&quot; which have absolutely mind blowing speed in multi-threaded applications. </s>
<s> (Which I admit are scarce) I can't wait. </s>
<s> I'm drooling to build a system around a four core CPU. </s>
<s> what is cache??? </s>
<s> can u help me? </s>
<s> ?...any sites? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> In my last reply I answered how to find out. </s>
<s> Hint: Type the question at google.com or ask.com Bob </s>
