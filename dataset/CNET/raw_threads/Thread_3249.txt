It comes and goes, and sometimes changing desktop sizes and resolutions calms it down for short periods. There seems to be no rhyme or reason for it, and I have tried all the conventional troubleshooting methods. Sometimes the menus are so jittery that I cannot even read them. Help!

Do you happen to be using a heater, flourescent light or some other electrical appliance right next to your monitor (or computer). That can cause problems similar to what you describe as well. The problem only occurs when you have that device on. If you have a CRT the refresh rate should be set to at least 72Hz or you do get flicker, which may be what you mean by Jittery. You do this in Advanced Settings. The thing to try is a different monitor or your monitor on a different system to try and narrow down the cause.

It always settles down after I make a change but then starts acting up again. There are no other electrical devices near it. I have a surge protector, but there are only computer related devices plugged into it. The only thing I haven't tried is moving my monitor to my other computer..I will do that in the near future. Thanks for the help.
