This has already been tested (as mentioned briefly in the original post).
When I change the setup so that the cable connection is connected directly to his main machine (thus missing the router out completely) the issues do not occur.
This is how I have confirmed that it is something to do with the router and/or its setup itself, however I am at a loss as to what element is at fault.
