hey thanks for the suggestion.
i am at work now and i was thinking of the same thing myself.
my biggest problem is the fact that i can't get the cmos to recognize the drive.
i am installing windows xp home.
can i use a windows 98 se start up disk to fdisk the drive after i get the drive recognized?
or will the cd rom be automatically recognized to fdisk the drive.
thanks again for the help.
