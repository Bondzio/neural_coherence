1.1.1	Hi, I have an oldish Linksys BEFSR41 router.	St
1.1.2	However it keeps killing the connection to all computers, requiring power down of modem and router (plugging the modem right into my computer works fine).	St
1.1.3	I've tried troubleshooting the router and I'm fed up, its time for a new networking solution.	St
1.1.4	I've been using wired but I'm wondering if I should change to wireless?	St
1.1.5	How reliable are the wireless routers, and the wireless cards I presumably would have to buy for each desktop I want to give an internet connection?	St
1.1.6	Any recommendations?	St
1.1.7	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	I really like the Linksys router + AP.	St
1.2.2	I would stay away from anything that says &quot;Pre N&quot;.	St
1.2.3	The G stuff works well and it is cheap.	St
1.2.4	And using WPA with a properly long key makes your network very secure.	St
1.2.5	SKrall	St
1.3.1	You said you tried to troubleshoot the router but did you update the firmware?	St
1.3.2	If not I bet you'll have trouble with a new router since my experience is they don't ship with the latest.	St
1.3.3	Also, there is some issue with a specific ISP and some routers.	St
1.3.4	But without clues I forget what that was.	St
1.3.5	Bob	St
