let me start repeating the start of my previous post (for another member): &quot;your story proves 2 well-known things: 1. external hard disks aren't suitable for data storage (just for transport and backup) 2. if you have only one copy of data (no backup) you risk to lose it (that's a calculated risk, if the time to make a backup is more than the time to make the documents again).&quot; with that being said, all i can say more is that the top post in this forum mentions a lot of free and paid recovery programs.
some might work.
you only know when you try.
it's recommended to make a clone of the disk (on another 1 tb disk) and let the recovery programs work on that clone.
that way, the first one you try won't do things that would interfere with the workings of the second one.
but if the data on the drive are really important, i wouldn't use the diy programs but find a professional data recovery company to do it.
