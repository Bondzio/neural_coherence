I'm running Vista Ultimate, SP1, on a AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4600+ 2.4 GHz. I have 2 GB of memory, 32-bit OS. I have 2 HD's (250 GB each), and for Christmas, my husband picked me up a 1.5 TB WD Hard Drive. He hooked it up (in the case) and then told me how to add it, going into Computer Management, formating it, etc. The problem? It's been stuck at 73% for HOURS... I started the formating last night, around 10pm.... it's almost 9pm here, and it's STILL formatting. I've shut down everything, and it's STILL Formating. I did the full format, (not the simple), per his instructions. Anyone have any suggestions?

Shut it down completely, Restart it, go to Computer Mgmt, Disk Mgmt, Delete the existing partition, recreate the partition, and then quick format. VAPCMD If you have any further problems with the WD drive .... download WD's Diagnostic SW and test the drive to make sure it's OK.
