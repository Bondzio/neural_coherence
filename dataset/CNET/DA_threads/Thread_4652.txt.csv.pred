1.1.1	I have a laptop .	St
1.1.2	Sadly , I am *so* plugged in that I never get to type away while I 'm in bed , or surf the net while watching TV .	St
1.1.3	Here 's the situation .	St
1.1.4	I have a two story house .	St
1.1.5	My Cable Internet jack is downstairs - thus so is our Linksys wireless-g router ( WRT54G ) .	St
1.1.6	Everything else is upstairs ... .my surround sound speakers ( dolby ) , my external hard drive ( iomega network drive ) , and my laptop ( hp zv5000z running win XP ) .	St
1.1.7	So what i 'd like to be able to do is keep the router downstairs that I have - yet be able to stream music wirelessly to my speakers upstairs , and connect to my external hard drive .	St
1.1.8	Now , I do n't know if this helps or not - but my external hard drive is an iomega , and the only way to connect it to my computer is through an ethernet jack ... but you can buy an accessory that converts it to a USB 2.0 jack as well ... Is what im trying to do possible ?	Ques
1.1.9	anyone gone through this before ?	Ques
1.1.10	ideas ?	Ques
1.2.1	You and everyone else ...	St
1.2.2	I have come up with two solutions - the first is to purchase a Network Attached Storage system .	St
1.2.3	It sounds like you have this already , have you tried to plug the hard drive into the router and utilize it that way ?	Ques
1.2.4	Most drives allow that , and according to the Iomega website , yours does also .	St
1.2.5	You might need to play with it a little , though .	St
1.2.6	As for your music , there are two solutions that I have found to be optimal - the Roku Soundbridge , and the Sonos system .	St
1.2.7	They will both do what you need , but are rather expensive .	St
1.2.8	There is a Linksys wireless music bridge that will connect your laptop to the stereo through your router , it runs about 150.00 but does n't have the control options that the Roku and Sonos have .	St
1.2.9	The Sonos will also pull off your hard drive or network while the computer is off , which the other solutions wo n't do .	St
1.2.10	I hope this helps ...	Polite
1.3.1	The linksys bridge is *axactly* what i need !	St
1.3.2	Thanks , thats awesome .	Polite
1.3.3	but the hard drive.. Well see here 's the thing ... i turn my hard drive off ( it has this on off button ) , and so id like it to be uhm ... close to me ?	Ques
1.3.4	haha .	St
1.3.5	But yeah is tehre any bridge device for that sorta thing ?	Ques
1.3.6	But yeah i have hookedit up to the router before and just done it that way , and that works well , as well .	St
1.4.1	I would n't worry about the hard drive , they are made for 24/7 use and unless you are shutting it down for security , you wo n't do any harm to it by leaving it on .	St
1.4.2	Alternatively , you can get a lamp timer and have the lap timer shut down the hard drive after a certain time .	St
1.4.3	There are also remote control systems that will allow you to control power to outlets with a remote control , I belive Radio Shack has a fairly inexpensive line .	St
1.4.4	Glad to be of help !	St
