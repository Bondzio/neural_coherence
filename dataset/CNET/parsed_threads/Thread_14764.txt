<s> How often should I change my surge protector? </s>
<s> My current desktop is attached to a 12-year-old surge protector. </s>
<s> The main circle indicator is bright, but it has a switch that also lights up. </s>
<s> It is dim and blinks. </s>
<s> Is it time to replace this surge protector? </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>

<s> Allow me to explain the lites or LEDs present on your old surge protector. </s>
<s> The sw. light or blinkly one probably is just showing you have AC present, thus turned-ON(blinkly), none-OFF. </s>
<s> The steady bright light/LED is probably the active status of your surge protector, its showing good or ready. </s>
<s> However, some surge protectors will show a &quot;error/failure&quot; LED and thus been used, it got hit, saved the day, replace the protector. </s>
<s> Otherwise, if this was the way it always been, its just active and ready. </s>
<s> A 12yr. </s>
<s> old surge protector for sake of mind, its up to you to decide to keep or replace, after all its your system. </s>
<s> In all likelyhood is been doing it's job as older models were robust and capable but again, if you trust it, continue it use or replace. </s>
<s> It all depends on your area, recent lightening, constant power lags/surges or old wiring, etc. </s>
<s> will give the peace of mind having the surge protector and/or UPS if that's part of it. </s>
