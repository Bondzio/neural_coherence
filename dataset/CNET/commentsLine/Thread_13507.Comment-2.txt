you are looking at opterons and xeons.
the p4 is not a dual cpu design.
however, the ht version of the p4 does show dual cpus in windows nt, 2000, xp and linux.
and does pretty darn good in transcoding sessions at a good price compared to dual cpu opteron/xeon based computers.
today, i'd get a 3+ghz p4 with 800mhz fsb, later this year a dual core athlon 64. bob
