Each time I try to start the Precision Pro software, there's a message that the scanner cannot be found or that it cannot be initalized. However, everything seems fine when I check the properties in the Control Panel. On the HP site there is information about installing 3 specific files to the registry, which I've done. Since the problem persists, I tried their second solution, which is to use regedit version 4.0 or above. Since my machine has an earlier version, following their advice I copied regedit 5.0 from another computer. Unfortunately, it won't run--indicates that a certain dll is missing. Since I don't want to fool around with the registry blindly, I'm stumped. HP used to have very helpful forums, but I see they are no longer there. Does anyone here have a suggestion? I'd be very grateful for any help. Rita Goldberg

The motherboard drivers and what else are usually unknown to most people and ... never installed by Microsoft. As it stands, your post is incomplete and the reason you reinstalled the OS is missing and more. Best of luck figuring this out with such a limited posting. Bob

Do you really want to know why I reinstalled Windows 98? It's a long story... Suddenly, all my Office programs stopped working. Other programs, too. Nothing would open properly. After several days futzing around with things, checking websites, tweaking, sending messages, etc. I decided to repair the registry. Since that didn't help, I restored the registry. Now things got really, really bad. So I gave up and called Dell. They led me through the reinstall. In any case, because everything old is gone (or on my backup drive) I wonder why it's important to describe why I reinstalled Windows. I downloaded the Scanjet drivers and software from the HP site and assumed that was enough. What might I be missing? If I didn't provide enough information in my post, I'd really appreciate your advice on what other details I should include. Thanks, Rita

I know it sounds gruesome but 98 (or se?) will not fetch or install drivers to make your USB ports work better than 1/2 of the time. It's all up to the owner to sort that out. In closing since you only tell it's a Dell, then you get to go there and find what drivers they offer. Bob
