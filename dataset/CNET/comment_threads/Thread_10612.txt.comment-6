What I discovered is antennas may help but without a make, model, and sometimes revision of the router I can't tell if it accepts an antenna or if the old reflector would help.
Also, repeaters are often hit and miss as you find some only work with the maker's models and then that can be untrue as well.
You asked for specific models but without the details to work with I shared what I find to really nail this issue.
