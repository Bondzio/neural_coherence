1.1.1	Hi , I have a wierd problem with my HP Desktop .	St
1.1.2	It 's a Pavilion a1747c , running an AMD 64 dual processor with 3 Gigs of ram .	St
1.1.3	I am running Windows Vista Home Premium .	St
1.1.4	Lately on boot , I receive a notice that the system fan has failed and to press F2 to ignore .	St
1.1.5	The system then boots normally .	St
1.1.6	I keep all vents clean and blow dust out of the Mother board at least every Month or so .	St
1.1.7	Both internal fans are running normally and they are quiet .	St
1.1.8	Is there a way to clear the message ?	Ques
1.1.9	I have never had a shutdown because of heat .	St
1.1.10	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	While the fan maybe working the sensor on it maybe losing contact or has gone bad .	St
1.3.2	If you find more than 2-wires going to the fan , that maybe the fault lies .	St
1.3.3	I suggest you at least reseat the fan connection several times , clean it and see if it changes or goes away .	St
1.3.4	Otherwise , if the error does n't cause a non-boot for the the PC it becomes more of an nuisance , provide the fan actually works .	St
1.3.5	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	If reseating the fan plug does not help .	St
1.4.2	What you may have is a fan that is a little worn and slow to start .	St
1.4.3	The result is when the bios does it 's scan the rpm 's are too low ... ... error .	St
1.4.4	When you open the case and look at the fan it is now up to speed ... ..looks good .	St
1.4.5	The fix ... ... replace the fan .	St
