<s> I am posting a new question to the Mac Hardware Forum concerning a new replacement for my original USB1.1 Apple card for my Mac G4 Quicksilver Server to a new card for the USB2 standard. </s>
<s> My G4 has a single port for the USB. </s>
<s> Is the USB and the Firewire port next to it connected to the same card? </s>
<s> Opened up to take a look at what is involved to replace the card unit and quickly closed the Mac door. </s>
<s> I am not an IT person. </s>
<s> WAY OVER MY HEAD! </s>
<s> What should I do??? </s>
<s> Also ,what USB2 hub should I purchase? </s>
<s> 4-ports are not enough. </s>
<s> I am interested in the Belkin 7-port maybe. </s>
<s> Your thoughts? </s>
<s> Mr. Macfixit, do you do house calls? </s>
<s> :) Thanks, Kevin Smith </s>
<s> K, It is very easy to equip your machine with USB 2.0. </s>
<s> You can even do it yourself, even though you are not a IT person. </s>
<s> First, your G4 has 2 USB ports and 2 Firewire (IEEE1394) ports. </s>
<s> While you are upgrading the USB, you might as well upgrade the Firewire too. </s>
<s> Upgrades for USB and Firewire are achieved by installing a PCI card into your G4. </s>
<s> Upgrading both at the same time, involves no extra work on your part. </s>
<s> You just buy a Firewire/USB 2.0 PCI Combo card. </s>
<s> USB and Firewire on the same card. </s>
<s> You can find one such card here: http://www.sonnettech.com/product/tango_2.html but there are others. </s>
<s> Gather up your new card, still in the box and a Phillips head screw driver. </s>
<s> #2 should do. </s>
<s> It would also be nice if you had a grounding wrist strap but it is not essential if you follow the instructions. </s>
<s> To install the card, shut down your G4. </s>
<s> If you have enough room to open the door where the machine is, good. </s>
<s> If you don't have room, disconnect everything and move to somewhere more roomier, preferably with a nearby grounded power outlet. </s>
<s> Plug the power back in. </s>
<s> Do NOT start the machine up. </s>
<s> Open the door and lay it down flat. </s>
<s> Put on the wrist strap and attach the other end to a metal part of the G4. </s>
<s> Power supply case is good. </s>
<s> Do NOT attach the end directly to ANY part of the logic board. </s>
<s> If you don't have an anti-static wrist band, make sure that you have everything close by, touch the power supply case with one bare hand. </s>
<s> Unplug the power cord, all static in your body has now been dissipated. </s>
<s> PCI cards are fitted in the white slots on the logic board (Motherboard). </s>
<s> Locate the slots. </s>
<s> In your case they are probably all empty. </s>
<s> Notice on the back of the case, in line with the white slots, there are covers over the openings. </s>
<s> The covers are held in place with one Philips head screw. </s>
<s> Note how the covers are situated. </s>
<s> Pick a slot, any slot, and remove the cover from the corresponding opening in the case. </s>
<s> Keep the screw. </s>
<s> Remove the PCI card from the box and the Anti-static bag. </s>
<s> Hold the card by the edges and avoid touching the components. </s>
<s> Look at the card, the slot and the opening. </s>
<s> The connector on the card goes into the slot, the ''tongue'' of the card (where the external connectors are) goes between the logic board and the case. </s>
<s> The whole thing sits down in exactly the way that the original opening cover was sat. </s>
<s> It will be a fairly tight fit, you may have to wiggle it a little but do not force it too much. </s>
<s> When everything is lined up, it will fit in. </s>
<s> Put the phillips screw back in. </s>
<s> Disconnect the wrist strap, close the door, reconnect everything and fire it up. </s>
<s> It probably NOT require any drivers to make it work. </s>
<s> OS X Panther has USB 2.0 support and Firewire has been around for a long time. </s>
<s> These, and any other necessary, instructions will be found in the booklet that comes with the card. </s>
<s> Ignore any language except English. </s>
<s> Ignore any instructions for any flavor of Windows. </s>
<s> Read ONLY the Mac setion. </s>
<s> This is a job for a NON tech person who is willing to read and look before attacking the logic board. </s>
<s> Good luck P </s>
<s> Mrmacfixit, Thank you for the help and understanding for a non IT person. </s>
<s> The post was easy to understand and to follow. </s>
<s> The link was also a plus upgrading to a USB2!! </s>
<s> ( http://www.sonnettech.com/product/tango_2.html ) I have printed this post out and also copied your text to a word Doc. </s>
<s> for filing on to my CNET folder and helpful posts. </s>
<s> (I keep a folder with helpful posts from you and others on my hard drive.) </s>
<s> You should be a technical writer. </s>
<s> Wonderful! </s>
<s> Your post is really easy to understand. </s>
<s> What about becoming a Moderator? </s>
<s> I will post back to you with my results. </s>
<s> Your help is great! </s>
<s> Hopefully I will not blow up my Mac or ZAPP it! </s>
<s> Wish me luck. </s>
<s> I also think that this post will be worthwhile to many others seeking the same solution and how to do it. </s>
<s> Thanks for the tip on upgrading Firewire at the same time. </s>
<s> Never thought of upgrading Firewire while upgrading USB2. </s>
<s> Who knew? </s>
<s> Not me. </s>
<s> Two great tips from you! </s>
<s> :) :) Thank You! </s>
<s> Kevin Smith </s>
<s> P. Thanks for the link ( http://www.sonnettech.com/product/tango_2.html You saved me hours looking for the upgrade. </s>
<s> Probably would not have found it on my own. </s>
<s> Went directly to the site and ordered it for $49.95. </s>
<s> Two day shipping was $11.95. </s>
<s> The only other shipping option was an overnite at $22. </s>
<s> Received the secure package from FedEx today. </s>
<s> The Sonnettech site will notify you on any updates available for the purchases that you have just made. </s>
<s> Nice idea. </s>
<s> Next step: install. </s>
<s> Thanks again, Kevin </s>
