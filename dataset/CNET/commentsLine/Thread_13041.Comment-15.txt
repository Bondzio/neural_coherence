thanks bob ill try to update bios rite now also wen i say it stopped working just now, that is exactly what i meant.
i upgraded to 7 from vista about a month ago so it wasnt a clean install, i kept all my files from vista.
and my wireless card didnt have any problems connecting on vista and even wen i first upgraded to 7 it didnt have any problems until yesterday wen it just decided to stop detecting networks
