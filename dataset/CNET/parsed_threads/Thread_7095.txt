<s> I started building a new computer that would not boot into windows. </s>
<s> I thought that it was maybe the processor(AMD Sempron)because the MOBO didnt directily say that it would take it. </s>
<s> However, i ended up haveing the HD jumper in the wrong place. </s>
<s> It works now. </s>
<s> But the problem is when i took my old AMD Athlon 1800+ out of my other computer to test the new computer. </s>
<s> I thought that if the 1800+ worked, then it was the sempron that was the problem(the 1800+ didnt work so went back to the other). </s>
<s> When i reinstalled the 1800+ into my old system the computer would begin to start up. </s>
<s> ( Fans, lights, HD, CDs, Floppy, all begin to start up) But within 3 seconds it shuts down, without a beep, without any signal to the monitor. </s>
<s> It is strange. </s>
<s> Does anybody know what i did. </s>
<s> Did i fry the CPU? </s>
<s> MOBO? </s>
<s> Something? </s>
<s> Thanks Tyler </s>
<s> the CPU and the HSF, put a new thin coating of thermal compound on it??? </s>
<s> Seems that it is overheating rapidly. </s>
<s> Get the d-----d CPU/HSF mounted properly before you try again. </s>
<s> If it is shutting itself down, there is hope that the CPU has protected itself to our human intervention. </s>
<s> susceptible to overheating/crash and burning. </s>
<s> Proper installation with heat sink compound and HSF is imperative. </s>
<s> Thanks i will try this. </s>
<s> The thermal tape was basically gone, so i will try that. </s>
<s> Tyler </s>
<s> Reapplying the compound was the trick. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help! </s>

<s> Alright, when i try updating my iPod, the system will shut down half way through the update. </s>
<s> Weird, because the system is relativly stable all the time except when i update. </s>
<s> Do you think the iPod is drawing too much power, is something wrong with the CPU, or short on memory? </s>
<s> I dont know, i have racked my brain and i can't come up with an explination. </s>
<s> One thing else happens. </s>
<s> After the abrupt shut down if i try to restart, the fans and system will start, but the monitor will not have anything displayed(the light just blinks). </s>
<s> If i wait for 5 mins or so and try again it boots up fine. </s>
<s> Do you think the heatsink isnt doing its job and the CPU is overheating? </s>
<s> Any help will be appreciated by te computer because i am about to kick it out into the middle of the street! </s>

<s> Read &quot;New Problems&quot; First So it doesnt have everything to do with the ipod, b/c it just shut down again a few mins ago when i was just doin email. </s>
<s> And unlike i said before, i dont have to wait any time to reboot. </s>
<s> (It always follows this pattern:) 1.Randomly shuts down after a while 2.I reboot. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> I do a hard shut down by holding power for 8 secs. </s>
<s> 4. i reboot and it starts up with ease. </s>
<s> Tyler </s>
<s> (Look at previous posts) i cant figure out wether it is the cpu or another thing that is wrong. </s>
<s> (logic suggests cpu since that is what i messed with) is it possible to shock a cpu and it still work for a while, and act like it is now? </s>
<s> Do you think that the new thermal paste is not doin its job causing it to overheat during intensive CPU use? </s>
<s> Please help, Tyler </s>
<s> It does sound as if the cpu is still overheating. </s>
<s> I would reinstall the cpu, being very careful that the thermal paste is applied properly. </s>
<s> A thin even coat of paste is required. </s>
<s> Some use a single edged razor blade to apply the paste. </s>
<s> The paste should be just thick enough that you can't see through it. </s>
<s> If it is applied too thick or too thin, you can get undesirable results. </s>
<s> Best of Luck </s>
<s> of the present situation in one post. </s>
<s> I can't read all four while trying to respond. </s>
<s> I just set up two monitors wonder if I can drag each post to a different spot on the monitors. </s>
<s> The long delay before it starts makes sense for overtemped CPU, but that only happened once, possibly indicating that the video card overheated. </s>
<s> Does your video card have a fan?? </s>
<s> Is its heat sink clogged with dust?? </s>
<s> Maybe I misunderstood how often which symptom occurs. </s>
<s> Do you have any type of temperature monitoring?? </s>
<s> How about in the BIOS?? </s>
<s> When first booting the temp in the BIOS will not be high. </s>
<s> After running a while reboot and go into the BIOS and check the temps. </s>
