Recently decided to build my own pc and after tinkering and connecting all the components, it was up and running properly.
i put in a second hardrive and it was still ok although i hadnt yet begun installing my OS.
I tried startin it 2day to install the OS but it just showed me a blank black screen.
Everything inside is visually functioning properly, the fan...etc, but the cd rom drive doesnt even open.
Im thinkin it mite be static on the motherboard (and i pray it aint) but there hasnt been any shocks between me and the comp.
Infact i left it in good working order but when i returned it wasnt.
(I also left it with the case open) Is there a way i can tinker with the mother board to make it 4get it was on strike and start again?
ive already tried to reset it with the CMOS pins.
