Here's a pretty complete list of the 1366 socket MB that Newegg offers http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2010200280%201070545356&name=LGA%201366 There's lots to choose from and here's one I put in the 'possible' pile.
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128362 My biggest concern with the socket 1366 platform is that there are few boards on at places like Newegg that get consistent high marks ....I mean 75-80% 5's, some 4 and very few 3's, 2's and 1's.
Instead most are rated 50-60% 5's, 5-20%...4's, a few 3's 2's and too many 1's.
Make sure you pick a good PSU to go with that rig... the EVGA GTX295 says...'Minimum of a 680 power supply (Minimum recommended power supply with +12 Volt current rating of 46 Amps.).
Let us know what you decide.
