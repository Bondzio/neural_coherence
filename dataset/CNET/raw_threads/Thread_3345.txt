I also have a new Epson Stylus R1800 for color photo printing. I hate to print text in business letters, web pages, web receits with these. I want a low maintenance printer that I can use only ocassionally that won't clog up to print text with. I want the text quality to be excellent. Any suggestions?

Overall cost per page is less, you do not need worry about nozzle clogging during periods of non-use, and for black on white, there are several for under $200. If you do want color for printing web pages, I think the Konica-Minolta for under $400 is a good buy. I myself use HP and Brother lasers, but I have friends who use Samsung with good results. Frank
