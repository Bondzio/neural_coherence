1.1.1	I have to maintain a LAN between two buildings of 500 mtrs .	St
1.1.2	distance.Almost 50 PCS are connected as clients.My problem is that sometimes network disconnected.Network is done by hubs , switches and cat5 cables and partially ( from one building to other ) through optical cable.I do n't get the server by pinging to the IP address of it .	St
1.1.3	Is there any other way to find out the fault or to check the networking at the time of fault.Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	Maybe 2 systems so they plug in the other socket ?	Ques
1.2.2	There are network monitor tools we find on google , so I wo n't write about that .	St
1.2.3	However what I find in the field is that when a person finds a failed hub they cycle the power and the hub starts working .	St
1.2.4	They miss the clue that the hub/switch is defective and end up doing a lot more support than needed .	St
1.2.5	Maybe it 's their choice since replacing the bad hardware would mean less work for them .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
