sorry it has taken a while to get a response to you (technical difficulties at cnet forums, i have read); while your build components look alright, they don't leave much (if any) room for upgrading in the future.
another thing to consider when building from the ground up (so to speak); is that you will have to factor in the cost of an operating system, this can increase the cost from $0 (if you're thinking about installing linux) to several hundred dollars depending on the level of windows or mac you want to install.
