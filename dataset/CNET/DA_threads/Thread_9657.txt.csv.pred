1.1.1	I am working with two computers , a desktop and a laptop .	St
1.1.2	I have both computers hooked up to a router .	St
1.1.3	My internet connection on both computers is fine , but I am unable to share files .	St
1.1.4	( So I know that the physical connection is ok. ) I ran the Home Networking Setup Wizard on both computers and everything went ok. Now , when I open Network Places and click on View workgroup computers , I get the following error message .	St
1.1.5	-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Mshome is not accessible .	St

1.1.9	-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - I get this same error message on both computers .	St
1.1.10	What can I do to fix this ?	Ques
1.2.1	I encountered the same problem and here is what I did to resolve it : Select the files/folders you want to share on your network , right click the folder and select & quot ; Sharing and Security. & quot ; Then click on the & quot ; Sharing & quot ; tab and click the option for & quot ; Share this folder on the network. & quot ; I also selected the option for & quot ; Allow network users to change my files & quot ; only because I work between my notebook and desktop .	St
1.2.2	Once that 's complete , click & quot ; apply. & quot ; If you 've done this correctly , you will see a hand supporting the folder which indicates you 've successfully shared the folder .	St
1.2.3	Repeat this process for both computers .	St
1.2.4	http : //www.home-network-help.com/file-sharing.html Best of luck !	St
1.3.1	Shared folders have already been setup , but I went ahead and double checked everything anyway and followed the instructions .	St
1.3.2	I am still having the same problem .	St
1.4.1	I get this proablem and think i have tried almost everything ! !	St
1.4.2	Now i 've given up : P I can get into my network files thats all i care about : P Other people can try more themselves if they think they can do it !	St
1.4.3	***** Oviously they cant ! !	St
1.4.4	!	St
1.5.1	I was messing around with my computers and finally found the problem .	St
1.5.2	My firewall software was not correctly configured to handle file-sharing .	St
1.5.3	Thanks for all of your advice .	St
