If your MacBook lacks a FireWire port and your camera requires one, you'll have to find another solution to connect the two.
If the camera accepts memory cards or can use an adapter of its own to connect via USB, I'd try that, but given that it uses FireWire, chances sound slim to me.
I'd guess then that the easiest thing you could do is switch cameras, if possible.
