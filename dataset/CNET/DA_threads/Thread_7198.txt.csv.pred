1.1.1	Okay , so I do a bit of travel , and when I fly , I tend to take a book or two with me , plus my laptop , and a few movies .	St
1.1.2	I am looking to reduce this with a tablet .	St
1.1.3	What I am looking to do is start getting e-books and using the download feature for the movies that I get .	St
1.1.4	I have been thinking about specifically getting a separate hard drive for the movies .	St
1.1.5	But , when it comes time to travel , I want to be able to take up to 10 of them with me .	St
1.1.6	The problem now is that if I get an iPad , I have to get one with a large enough hard drive to put them onto it .	St
1.1.7	If I get any of a number of Android tablets , then tend to have a SD card slot so that you can have stuff on a SD card , and be able to access it .	St
1.1.8	But the trade off is that the new iPad ( iPad 3 pretty much ) has the better display for watching said hi-def ( Blu-Ray quality ) movies .	St
1.1.9	I honestly want to get a tablet that I can put books onto for reading anytime , as well as some apps that can be useful for stuff , and be able to stick some music on there , and be able to use some form of an expandable memory system to stick movies onto to watch when I travel .	St
1.1.10	Since I am reducing considerably from a couple of books , a 17 & quot ; laptop , and however many movies that I would bring along , having a few SD cards , or maybe a connection cable with a SD card reader and SD cards , is n't a big deal .	St
1.1.11	So , should I be looking at an Android tablet ( I know that the Sony Experia S comes out on Friday ) , or is there a way to work with an iPad and the camera connection cable ( Or SD card reader ) that the Apple store and Apple experts at Best Buy do n't know about ?	Ques
1.2.1	Android tablets are still on the fiddly side so stick to those names .	St
1.2.2	As to Blu-Ray quality that 's an easy no .	St
1.2.3	No 24p playback so it falters right at get go .	St
1.2.4	We have a lot of tablets at the office but not the Apple because of no serial port profile so our apps are not possible .	St
1.2.5	It 's a nice tablet .	St
1.2.6	It 's odd that the folk are not aware of SD card solutions if you want to carry stuff on that media .	St
1.2.7	I own of of those Kingston WiFi 32GB cards so that 's another way .	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	What do you mean by no 24p playback ?	Ques
1.3.2	You mean 24 frames per second ?	Ques
1.3.3	That would be the camera , not a tablet or player .	St
1.3.4	Also , how would a Kingston Wi-Drive work with a tablet ?	Ques
1.3.5	Does it simply use a Wi-Fi signal between them ?	Ques
1.4.1	If you read reviews by CNET of BD players and HDTVs any unit that does not do 24p playback usually gets dinged .	St
1.4.2	Since tablets and PCs ca n't do 24p on the internal display and I 've yet to see 24p output from a tablet , it 's easy to write that BD playback fails on the tablets .	St
1.4.3	Not to duplicate the WiDrive web page , the answer is yes .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	Okay , so nothing will be Blu-Ray quality , I can do with DVD then .	St
1.5.2	Not a problem there .	St
1.5.3	And I looked at the Wi-Drive , but if I place movies on it , and want to watch them while on a flight , then I would think that there would be a problem with the Wi-Fi on a plane , even if it is only localized .	St
1.5.4	or is it okay , because it would be so localized ?	Ques
1.6.1	You do n't want a tablet without the card slots .	St
1.6.2	This really helps narrow it down .	St
1.6.3	If Apple will not talk to you about the Camera Kit then they are out of the running too .	St
1.6.4	Go try out that Sony .	Sug
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	So , I saw that with the Sony Tablet S , the SD card slot is n't actually expandable memory , it reads it , but in order to watch a movie or the like , you have to download the stuff to the tablet 's memory .	St
1.7.2	Kind of defeats the purpose of having a SD card slot .	St
1.7.3	But , is this because of an older Android OS ?	Ques
1.7.4	Does ICS do away with that , and basically use the SD card slot as actual expandable memory ?	Ques
1.8.1	I 'm maintaining old PalmOS apps and the same story way back then .	St
1.8.2	If you put an app on the card , behind your back it copies it to onboard memory before it launches .	St
1.8.3	Seems to be pretty easy to work with .	St
1.8.4	Is n't ICS outdated now with Jellybean out ?	Ques
1.8.5	Why consider anything unless it 's the latest unless the price is right ?	Ques
1.8.6	With Google Nexus and the new Kindle Fire HD 's out I think the next few weeks will see a fire sale on older units .	St
1.8.7	One might be just what you want .	St
1.8.8	Bob	St
1.9.1	It 's mostly the Player app that has to deal with the memory card issue .	St
1.9.2	If a player will copy it in as needed , it will be transparent to you .	St
1.9.3	As the magician said & quot ; Now watch this. & quot ; Bob	St
1.10.1	That is just it , I do n't want it to copy what is on the card .	St
1.10.2	If I get a 16 GB model that is 33 % full with apps , books , and such , and I have a 16 GB card that is 75 % full with movies , it ca n't copy everything from the card to the memory .	St
1.10.3	And I do n't want it to .	St
1.10.4	I specifically want the card to be expandable memory , so I can have the OS , books , some music , and any apps that I want on the tablet memory , and I want to be able to put movies onto a SD card so I can swap them out .	St
1.10.5	I want to be keep the tablet memory as clean as possible .	St
1.10.6	As to Jelly Bean , well , if worse comes to worse , I have a guy that can do some stuff for me if needed .	St
1.11.1	I write apps so to me I hide the fact my apps read external memory cards into local memory as needed and makes it all seem like magic .	St
1.11.2	Any decent app ( for example the player ) would just deal with it .	St
1.11.3	I 've found the purveyors of these tablets to be unknowing and I ca n't collect all of them .	St
1.11.4	At the office we write apps for such things but even there , we only have a dozen or more models .	St
1.11.5	This is not one of them so I ca n't test for your issue .	St
1.11.6	Bob	St
