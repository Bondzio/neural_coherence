<s> The 'safely remove hardware' icon keeps appearing on my bottom tray. </s>
<s> I have installed and disabled, reinstalled...have had several discussions with HP regarding this issue, and still no resolution. </s>
<s> Every suggestion initially worked. </s>
<s> The icon reappears after reboot. </s>
<s> The issue are my USB ports: 1) printer port, the other three are media ports. </s>
<s> OS: Windows XP Media Center. </s>
<s> Is anyone else out there having this problem? </s>
<s> All comments and suggestions are appreciated. </s>
<s> I also have that icon, it's for the cable modem, I ignore it. </s>
<s> ... Any time you have a USB device connected to your PC you'll get this message. </s>
<s> What it's telling you is that you need to disable the connection to the USB device if you want to remove it from the system. </s>
<s> Once you've done that, it gives you an &quot;OK&quot; message. </s>
