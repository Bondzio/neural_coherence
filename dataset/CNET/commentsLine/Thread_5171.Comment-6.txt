i use the following suite on all the machines now that microsoft office is frankly getting too pushy about one copy per machine in my house.
i can deal with it at work, but at home, no.
open office from  to complement web work, the mozilla from  xp was not a big move for me, but i ran nt 4.0 at work for far too many years and windows 2000. the issues of 64 kilobyte resource pools and 4 gigabyte file size maximums make the 95/98/me line unusable now that i want to do video work at home.
be sure to check that the fans are clear and running top notch and your machine may just need a 10 minute warning... one last thought.
if you are inside the box, reseat the cards, memory and such, just to be sure.
