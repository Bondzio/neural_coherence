1.1.1	Greetings all , I 'm new to the forum and I hope someone will be able to offer some advice .	St
1.1.2	Sick of onboard & quot ; AGP & quot ; graphics which would n't play DVDs faster than 10 fps I decided to buy a cheap PCI graphics card ; a 32Mb Pine 3D phantom ( based on the SiS 315E chipset ) .	St
1.1.3	I installed it into a motherboard from an unknown manufacturer with the VIA Apollo MVP4 chipset .	St
1.1.4	The card refuses to give any output whatsoever despite me changing the & quot ; primary VGA & quot ; in bios to & quot ; PCI card & quot ; from & quot ; AGP & quot ; .	St
1.1.5	Also I disabled the onboard AGP but there was still no response from the PCI card .	St
1.1.6	Interestingly enough , with & quot ; onboard AGP & quot ; set to & quot ; disabled & quot ; the onboard graphics still produces an image .	St
1.1.7	In addition , when I allow the machine to boot up Win98SE it does n't detect the card .	St
1.1.8	I 've swapped ethernet and modem cards around enough to determine that all the PCI slots work .	St
1.1.9	Also , when I put the PCI graphics card into my shuttle , it boots first time and uses the PCI card as the primary VGA device .	St
1.1.10	What could possibly be wrong ?	Ques
1.1.11	Cheers .	Polite
1.2.1	YOu do n't tell us the brand/model of the system you are currently using or the motherboard if it is a non branded system .	St
1.2.2	That is really important to know to help .	St
1.3.1	Unless I installed a hardware DVD decoder , I never found a software solution to play DVD on even a K6-2-500 .	St
1.3.2	It just did n't have the oomph to pull that off .	St
1.3.3	I 'll write that 's not going to fix it .	St
1.3.4	Bob	St
