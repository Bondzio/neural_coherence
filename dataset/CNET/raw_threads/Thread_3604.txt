I have 1 desktop, connected straight to the router, and 2 wireless laptops. One of the laptops has no problem accessing the network. The other one though, cannot recognize it though. Still though, the laptop that cannot recognize the network still can access the internet wirelessly. I don't how that happens if it cannot access the network. When I go into My Network Places and go to View Workgroup Computers, only 2 of the computers show up. That one laptop does not. Therefore, I cannot print wirelessly or do anything like that with that one laptop. So does anyone know how I can fix this problem? By the way, I am using a workgroup, not a domain. And the name of my workgroup is MSHOME. Thanks!
