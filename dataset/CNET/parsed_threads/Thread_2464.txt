<s> In order to establish a LAN I've installed a linksys router on my main computer and a linksys adapter card on a second computer. </s>
<s> Although each was installed correctly and seem to be working individually, I can't log on from the second computer to the internet nor will it file share. </s>
<s> When I try to log on from the second computer, I get the message &quot;network hardware disconnected or unplugged&quot;, which they aren't. </s>
<s> What's up with this? </s>
<s> Comp1 operating system? </s>
<s> Comp2 operating system? </s>
<s> Linksys router model? </s>
<s> Linksys adapter card model? </s>
<s> I am assuming that you are making wired (not wireless) connectinos with both computers. </s>
<s> Correct? </s>
<s> Try swapping network cables to see if one is faulty. </s>
<s> Both computers use Windows XP-Home. </s>
<s> The Router model is WRT546S (Wireless) and the card adapter is WPM54GS (Wireless). </s>
<s> I'm told by the computer that the card is working properly. </s>
<s> And the computer to which the router is attached is able to copnnect to the internet. </s>
<s> But with respect to the card adapater, I keep getting the message cannot associate with access point. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Install latest firmware for WRT54GS . </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Install latest driver for WMP54GS . </s>
<s> The driver for your WMP54GS may include a new version of Linksys Wireless Network Monitor. </s>
<s> If so, the installation process might require you to uninstall the previous version before you can go forward. </s>
<s> Another issue: Sometimes using Linksys Wireless Network Monitor to connect to the router is quirky. </s>
<s> Try right-clicking on the Linksys Network Monitor (by your clock), and select the option to use Windows wireless network configuration. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I don't hink it's because the computer is too far away. </s>
<s> Our primary computer crashed and that's when the trouble started. </s>
<s> Prior to that I had connectivity and the computers were both where they are presently. </s>
<s> I thought that the crash might have affected the router, so I bought and installed a new router with speed booster. </s>
<s> I even changed the adapter for the second computer. </s>
<s> But thus far, the second computer can't get access. </s>
<s> double check your,e connections. </s>
<s> you would be surprised how one! </s>
<s> just a little loose conection. </s>
<s> can screw up all! </s>
