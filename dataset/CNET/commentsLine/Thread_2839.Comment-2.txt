greetings.
sounds like you have an overheating problem.
check that the cpu is properly fixed to the heatsink with thermal tape or grease properly applied.
check that your fans are all functioning.i feel it is most likely to be the cpu overheating as the case fans failing would likely take longer than a couple of minutes for the case to heat to the point of shut off.
hope you get it fixed soon cheers stewart
