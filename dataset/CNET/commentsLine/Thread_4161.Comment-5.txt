found this driver updater on cnet site.
it was just added 6/8/11.
i'd like to think this would be a safe download that wouldn't cause my pc to get the wrong drivers and thus create problems only a pc tech could fix.
do you have any opinions about this software?
also to answer your inquiry about returning item to place purchased to have drivers updated, that is not an option.
i ordered the pc online from target and had it shipped to me.
