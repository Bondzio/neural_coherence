simply put: yes.
you will regret it.
integrated graphics take from your system resources because they share the processor and ram, along with every other integrated item on the motherboard.
now, if you simply want to watch a dvd, surf the web, and check emails, then you'll be fine.
you'll have no problem with integrated anything, if that's all you want to do.
if you want to watch blu-ray, play games, and future proof yourself somewhat, then you must buy a video card.
but, so you know, you needn't buy the card right this instant, for it to function.
most video games require the ati hd series cards (usually 3000 or better), and hp desktops come with the nvidia 6150se chipset, and you'll definitely need a 9000 series, or a gt200 or better to fully support blu-ray and video games.
in fact, most video games don't even support integrated graphics.
256 mb of ram is pretty good for an integrated chipset, but don't expect miracles out of it, you won't get far.
your best bet is to buy it, and enjoy it as much as possible for the time being, and when you have the money saved up, go and buy the card.
once you buy the card, you can disable the onboard video to free up some processor and memory resources, because the card will handle the bulk of the work.
i also recommend buying a 5.1 sound card, so you can disable the onboard audio as well.
it will also free up system resources.
i too have a hp system (a compaq, but it's made by hp), and i upgraded both the video card and audio, and let me tell you, it was amazing how much faster and smoother the computer operated.
the cards will do the bulk of the work, and then the processor and memory/ram will pick up the slack, and you'll notice an overall increase in performance.
i highly recommend an upgrade when it's financially possible.
