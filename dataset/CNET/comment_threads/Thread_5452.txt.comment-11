Sorry, haven't dealt with chipset info, I think it's the firmware that you are asking for, but just in case I listed the rest of the info: Intel 82801BA LPC Interface Controller -2440 82801BA/BAM SMBus Controller -2443 82801BA/CA PCI Bridge -244E 82802 Firmware Hub Device 82850 Processor to I/O Controller -2530 82850/82860 Processor to AGP Controller -2532 Even if I have to reinstall without the HDcard, I'd appreciate this info, as I'm thinking it'll be a good idea to update whatever's outdated anyways.
Thanks.
