1.1.1	Hi , I have a HDD of 300 GB .	St
1.1.2	I installed Windows XP Pro and when I checked the size , I got 195.22 GB usable HD capacity and 192.29 GB HD free space .	St
1.1.3	Any idea how I recover the rest ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	The original , SP1 , SP2 or SP3 ?	Ques
1.2.2	Some other questions : - What does Disk Manager C say about the drive ?	Ques
1.2.3	It should say there 's 100 Gb unallocated if it really is a 300 Gb drive - What did you tell the partition during the setup of Windows ?	Ques
1.2.4	To use the whole disk ?	Ques
1.2.5	- What does Belarc advisor ( free download ) say about the disk ?	Ques
1.2.6	Kees	St
1.3.1	The original SP2 .	St
1.3.2	During installation , I partitioned the disc in half .	St
1.3.3	Here is what Belarc advisor says : 104.86 GB Usable Hard Drive Capacity 102.00 GB Hard Drive free space Now I 'm using the Disk Manager of XP , created a second partition of 90 GB from the unallocated space , formatted , but still have unallocated space which I can not format to use as a third partition ( the only options right-click gives are & quot ; New Partition , Properties and Help & quot ; .	St
1.3.4	Here is what I have right now ( from Disk Manager ) 1- C : 97.66 GB 2- E : 87.89 GB 3- Unallocated space : 93.94 GB .	St
1.3.5	Still have about 20 GB missing ( Windows XP should not take that much ) .	St
1.4.1	That 's 7 % and that 's exactly what 's expected between the two definitions of Gb .	St
1.4.2	If there 's a & quot ; New partition & quot ; option in your right click , ca n't you use that to create a new partition ( f : ) in the unallocated space .	St
1.4.3	Then you 've got 3 partitions of about 100 Gb each .	St
1.4.4	The right sequence is first make the partition , then format .	St
1.4.5	& quot ; Formatting to use as a new partition & quot ; , as you say , is plainly wrong and impossible .	St
1.4.6	That might be part of your problem .	St
1.4.7	It 's unclear to me why 'half ' of a 300 Gb would become 100 Gb .	St
1.4.8	Maybe your BIOS does n't handle such a big drive correctly ?	Ques
1.4.9	Do you have reasons to partition the disk ?	Ques
1.4.10	It 's not necessary .	St
1.4.11	Windows XP SP2 can easily handle a 300 Gb partition .	St
1.4.12	It might save you some troubles if you redo the install , delete all current partitions and use just one .	Sug
1.4.13	Kees	St
1.5.1	Thanks for your answer .	Polite
1.5.2	This is exactly what I was going to do .	St
1.5.3	I 'll just delete all the partitions and redo the install .	St
1.5.4	The reason why I want to partition the HD , is I want to use XP on one partition ( C ) , Windows Server 2003 on the second and Ubuntu on the third .	St
1.5.5	I 'll do a quick wipe out with DBAN and reinstall XP .	St
1.5.6	Thanks again .	St
1.6.1	I just partitioned the last unallocated space .	St
1.6.2	Now I have 3 partitions : C : 97.66 GB E : 87.89 GB F : 93.94 GB I think everything is ok now .	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
