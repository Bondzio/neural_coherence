An apartment environment may need the beefier security of WPA, while a private country estate may need MAC filtering at best. The choice is yours.

6070	3	118862	1348467	1348431	Michael Geist	8/8/05 6:10 PM	1.1235246E12	The manual shows WEP only.....	on page 3-10. Any change to the cards security function would come through a software program update, not firmware. As this is an older card, I would guess Netgear is leaving this one alone and hoping you will buy a newer card.

Netgear has information on their website too. A cursory look reveals that there are 3 different versions of the WG311 card, but you have to look at the serial number of yours to determine which it is. One of them has a new driver that will support WPA, the others apparently won't. Enough hints from us, you know where to look for the rest. dw
