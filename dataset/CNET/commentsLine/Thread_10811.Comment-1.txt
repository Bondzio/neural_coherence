i have two hard drives.
one i bought and did nothing with until now, so i can use it as an external drive now.
the other is the hard drive from my computer which recently died.
(it didn't die, the power supply broke, the fan needed to be fixed and it was three years old) with the first, unused drive i simply went into disk management, initialized it and then formatted it.
with the drive that is from the old laptop, i need the data that is on there, so formatting it is absolutely out of the question.
i just don't know how to go about getting this drive recognized by my computer (win7) and then being able to copy its data to my new computer.
these are sata drives.
not sure if that matters, i just have a feeling someone's gonna ask.
please let me know if you can help.
thanks.
