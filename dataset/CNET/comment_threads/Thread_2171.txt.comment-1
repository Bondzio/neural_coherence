Hi, I want to buy a wireless laser mouse.
I ve researched a lot on various mices, but Logtiech's G7 gaming mouse and the MX610 laser mouse catch my interest.
Onto my question.
I ve seen on the MX610, there are two buttons near the thumb area, for going back and forward while browsing the internet.
I had an hp mouse with similar buttons but they always accounted for Accidental Clicks.
And I would end up way too back or forward while browsing.
Does this happen with the MX610 also?
Please let me know, thanks in advance.
