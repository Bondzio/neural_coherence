if you change too much hardware in that type of machine, windows may refuse to work.
you won't be able to reinstall windows using the dell restore disk.
your disk is proprietary to that system.
it will be looking for your old hardware.
you could end up having to purchase a new windows xp cd to make it work.
thats why it can be less expensive to purchase a new computer than update a proprietary machine.
