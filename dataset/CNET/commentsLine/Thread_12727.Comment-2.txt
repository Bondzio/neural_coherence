also my case is designed for super good airflow and i guarentee thats not it, having a fan blow on back of pc at ps exhaust does nothing, and cpu heat sink (zalman cnps9500) is a freon fill tube and has treated me wellsince i put it in.
better than any liquid cooling ive seen when combined with the case airflow.
