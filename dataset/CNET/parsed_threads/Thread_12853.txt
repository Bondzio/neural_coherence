<s> As I am every time I look to buy a new PC, I am in a quandary -- and hope a few CNET'ers might chime in?. </s>
<s> For whatever reason, I am a Dell fan. </s>
<s> Over the years I've purchased six of them. </s>
<s> My Mom's current PC (a Dell which is one of the six I've purchased) seems to have some serious issues. </s>
<s> It runs as slow as molasses in February! </s>
<s> Mom lives in another state and, instead of trying to figure out what's wrong with her PC (several years old, Win XP), we both agree she should simply get a new one. </s>
<s> Being a life-long fan (and perhaps having tunnel vision), I want to get her another Dell. </s>
<s> I've been looking at the Inspiron i580. </s>
<s> As Mom does little more on her PC than send emails and browse the internet, I think it fits her needs. </s>
<s> But, I wonder, should I consider another brand? </s>
<s> HP perhaps? </s>
<s> I know Dell gets a lot of negative marks for their so-called &quot;customer service.&quot; Heck, just last week I telephoned Dell's sales department with a few questions -- and reached India. </s>
<s> I immediately hung up! </s>
<s> But is that reason enough to NOT consider getting another Dell? </s>
<s> I am, and have been, a computer addict for well over a decade. </s>
<s> And, still, I spend countless hours trying to figure out how to do/find things on my relatively new Win7 PC. </s>
<s> Mom is now in her 80's. </s>
<s> I fear Mom will have a harder time transitioning to Win7 from WinXP than she did (at a bit younger age) from Win98 to WinXP. </s>
<s> I'm just brainstorming and hoping for some thoughts. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> If you follow the forums here all vendors sooner or later get negative press. </s>
<s> The more popular the vendor, meaning they sold zillions the more likely bad press as well. </s>
<s> That is no excuse though for off-loading service to off shore customer support, ie: India. </s>
<s> That only makes it worse and you already seem to know that. </s>
<s> dell, though will support better if you're an enterprise or business buyer(maybe?) </s>
<s> it all depends on amounts, etc.. </s>
<s> But, regardless the PCs themselves usually are decent. </s>
<s> If you have some savvy, and use of online support usually can resolve a host of issues using the Dell support website. </s>
<s> of course, if you have to use any telco type support, good luck Considering all that, you can buy Dell again or some other vendor. </s>
<s> Overall, I see Dell has gotten to think it saves $ when support is offshore, too bad. </s>
<s> As for Mom, only you can gauge whatever action from buying new. </s>
<s> Win7 is more friendly to swapping over files/pgms. </s>
<s> etc., and that is discussed widely here. </s>
<s> tada ------Willy </s>
<s> Why not try a Mac for Mom? </s>
<s> If all she's doing is e-mail, web surf, etc, why not a Macbook, Macbook Air, or Macbook Pro? </s>
<s> There is also the new 21.5&quot; iMac that came out the other day. </s>
<s> They certainly have much more ease of use and are great looking and long lasting. </s>
<s> In my experience I've given HP and Dell 1 or 2 star rating, mainly because they quit too soon. </s>
<s> I switched to Mac and have never regretted it. </s>
<s> You say Mom may have a hard time transitioning from Win XP to 7? </s>
<s> I did, and I'm a computer wizz, Win 7 just didn't click for me. </s>
<s> Switching to Mac OS would be just as easy if not easier for her I think. </s>
<s> Just show her how to open the browser, hit the web, and it's all the same from there. </s>
<s> The way it's laid out is very easy to understand. </s>
<s> Anyone but Dell! </s>
<s> Several years ago I tried to buy a laptop on Dell's website. </s>
<s> I spent a couple of hours on their site reviewing their various models and options, then put together an order with everything I wanted in the laptop. </s>
<s> Price was about $2,500. </s>
<s> Completed the order and paid with my debit card. </s>
<s> A few days went by, but I never received any kind of confirmation email or other communication from Dell. </s>
<s> Checked my bank account and there was no transaction from Dell. </s>
<s> Logged back into their website and found that my order was on hold, so I called them. </s>
<s> The first guy I talked to said that they couldn't accept my debit card. </s>
<s> When I asked why, he said he didn't know, and asked if I could use another card. </s>
<s> So, then I'm wondering if there's something wrong with my card, so I asked if I could speak to his supervisor. </s>
<s> He gave me a name and a number in their finance office. </s>
<s> It's not like I'm some kind of financial deadbeat. </s>
<s> At the time, I was 50+ years old, had a six figure annual income, owned my home, and had been with my employer 20+ years. </s>
<s> When I called this other guy, he was a real SOB. </s>
<s> When I asked if there was a problem with my card, he said that he couldn't tell me that, and asked if I had another card I could use. </s>
<s> When I asked why they wouldn't accept my card, he said he didn't have to answer that question, and asked me again if I had another card I could use. </s>
<s> When I said that I really needed to understand why they would not accept my debit card for payment, he said that they were under no obligation to accept my debit card and that unless I gave him another card to complete the purchase, he was going to cancel my order. </s>
<s> So, I told him okay and that I didn't think that I could do business with Dell. </s>
<s> Have recommended against doing business with Dell ever since. </s>
<s> Over the past ten years, I have had four different computers. </s>
<s> The first was a Cyrix which was worthless, and I returned it after about ten months for a full refund. </s>
<s> I don't remember the brand of the second computer except that it was &quot;NOT&quot; a Dell. </s>
<s> It worked semi average at best for about two years before I needed to replace it. </s>
<s> My third was a home grown or generic machine. </s>
<s> I paid a friend $400 to build it for me. </s>
<s> That included all parts he ordered from various places on the web, and for his time as well. </s>
<s> That computer worked well for several years; better than anything else I had, including my fourth and current machine which is the same as the one you are considering for your Mom; a Dell Inspiron 580. </s>
<s> I have had it for about three years now, and it has worked as well for me as the generic one, but not any better. </s>
<s> In my experience, if you know someone who has tech ability to build one from scratch, this would be my best advice. </s>
<s> Of course it still depends on what you would pay him versus a new Dell Inspiron, because prices are probably now considerably lower than when I bought mine. </s>
<s> I hope this helps you in some way. </s>
<s> Tim A. </s>
<s> Hi, you've had six machines from Dell, you obviously like them (Customer Help Desk apart - is that an oxymoron?!) </s>
<s> so I would guess you've had few, if any serious problems with them. </s>
<s> So why not stick with the team you know? </s>
<s> Personally, though I've ordered quite a lot of these machines for business clients, I really don't like them. </s>
<s> The machines seem to be as reliable anyone else's and they have turned out some nice kit. </s>
<s> But I have two reservations, the number of proprietary parts the use, and the significant difference (usually) between &quot;Headline Price&quot; (low) and &quot;Configured Price&quot; (high). </s>
<s> I like Lenovo laptops, HP desktops and HP and IBM x servers but that's just a personal preference like your Dells. </s>
<s> You may be right about the transition from XP to Win7, though once you've learned how to launch your applications and find your files, there isn't too much difference. </s>
<s> But you might want to investigate Classic Shell http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/ that will replace the start menu with something resembling XP's and Windows Explorer, given a bit of fiddling around. </s>
<s> But you do lose the new features of Windows 7, such as libraries, so it may be better to learn the new Win7 interface. </s>
