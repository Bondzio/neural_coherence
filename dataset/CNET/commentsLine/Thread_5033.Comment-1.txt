hi, i have a 12&quot; g4 powerbook (1.5 ghz powerpc g4, 512 mb ddr sdram) running os 10.3.9, with one of those crap matshita dvd-r uj-835e superdrives that i haven't had the cash to replace (until now).
there are two places i'm thinking of using: macservice ( iresq ( both companies install the panasonic 8x dual layer, which i understand is what apple also uses.
my questions: 1) is the panasonic as unreliable and prone to breakdown as i understand the matshita to have been?
2) is there a better drive out there?
i've heard that pioneer dvr-k05 is more reliable.
3) if you think i should just go with the panasonic, do you have anything positive/negative to say about either of these companies?
thanks in advance for your help!
