i'm looking at buying the cyberpower ultimate gaming desktop  however, i've read in reviews that there are issues with vista in terms of the drivers or something like that.
then i called cyberpower and talked to a rep about it and she said that it is definitely a problem and that certain games may not be recognizable to vista, espeically older games.
she said that if i took the vista out and replaced it with xp pro i would have no problems at all.
so, my question is how big a problem is this?
does anyone know exactly what games i would be able to play and what games i wouldn't?
i am mostly interested in playing new games anyway so i was wondering if this would be a nonissue for me.
also, does anyone know how long it will take before these issues with vista are worked out?
and lastly, what is the difference between xp pro and vista?
i know vista is new, but am i really hurting myself by not getting vista and instead settling for xp pro.
my uses for the pc would only be for gaming, internet, photo storage and some word processing.
and advice is greatly appreciated since i am a total computer noob and am completely lost when it comes to this stuff.
