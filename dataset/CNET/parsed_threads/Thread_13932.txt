<s> I checked out oveclocking.com becase my friend recomended it and he has built many computers. </s>
<s> heres what i found. </s>
<s> I was just wondering if any1 knew if the parts were compatible with each other, i have a socket 939 motherboard, and a socket 939 cpu. </s>

<s> thankyou. </s>
<s> also i would considering getting the nvidia 6800gs instead for the gfx card. </s>
<s> also the ram isnt very good. </s>
<s> i would get something from ocz or corsair xms but i'm not sure about your budget also u can skimp down on the cpu. </s>
<s> go with the 3000+ venice core. </s>
<s> 3200+ is not that much of a boost. </s>
<s> also i dont think the sound card is necessary. </s>
<s> and i never heard of the company of your psu b4. </s>
<s> but other than that pretty good. </s>
<s> and depending on the price of the mobo, u could change it to something from asus, msi, or dfi. </s>
<s> all of those are good. </s>
<s> others which are pretty good would be epox, chaintech, abit, etc. </s>
<s> but the gigabyte one would be good. </s>
<s> I would look into a Better psu, a dvd-rom, or media-card reader? </s>
<s> Don't forget extra fans for cooling, windows and arctic silver 5,if you don't have windows cd, but oem or layman, if you have a store-bought windows computer's hard drive. </s>
<s> Crucial ram, suggest change to corsair value instead. </s>
<s> Other than that, looks good. </s>
