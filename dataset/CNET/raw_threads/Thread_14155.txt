However, every time I plug the printer in my laptop immediately shuts down and gives the dreaded blue screen of death. I've posted a link to a screenshot below: http://img62.imageshack.us/img62/6282/img10521.jpg Any help on this issue would be greatly appreciated Here is my system information: (I'm not sure exactly what people might need) [System Summary] Item

But maybe it's better to contact HP Customer Service first and ask if it's a known problem and they have updated driver available. Kees
