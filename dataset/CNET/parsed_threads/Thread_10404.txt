<s> I have a TSST corp DVD+-RW TS-H653A and it has stopped working. </s>
<s> It will let me read a read cd but will not write. </s>
<s> Can anyone help. </s>
<s> Did you try the usual CD/DVD lens cleaner and then swap the drive out? </s>
<s> Yes I tried that and it still will not work, any other ideals? </s>
<s> Do you think I need to replace. </s>
<s> When Bob wrote &quot;swap the drive out&quot; he meant &quot;replace&quot;. </s>
<s> So it's: no, I didn't yet. </s>
<s> Better do. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> I didn't go down the road or try much else. </s>
<s> When I see what you wrote I reach for a new drive so I can remove the failed drive and put in the new one. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So everyone thinks I should replace even if the drive is on 1 1/2 years old. </s>
<s> case as even a 1 year old burner can still fail to burn after that, that is unless you have another spare one lying around to test it out. </s>
<s> Factors includes heavy usage, type of disc used, production fault for some examples. </s>
<s> Want to thank all of you will stay away from Dell if this is the problem, you guys are great. </s>
<s> Dell uses the same drives that you get in most other makes. </s>
<s> Why do you think the machine maker is the cause? </s>
<s> of being unfortunate batch received. </s>
<s> similar to mobile phones in which not all batches are produced with same longivety, and odd ones will slip out. </s>
<s> Quality checks are also randomly selected, thus, it may have een missed. </s>
<s> One won't go checking all million of manufactured ones as it will take ages to complete. </s>
<s> Likewise, like some previous battery recalls, some of those with faults have been shipped out, and although not all of the same batches may be affected. </s>
<s> I have unfortunate experience before with such stuffs and this is despite my friend have the same stuff from the same batch, his was ok and vice versa. </s>
<s> So, yup, that's why I mentioned it as possibility. </s>
<s> The drive to get the costs down to lowest possible has resulted in drives that last about a year or two. </s>
<s> I think you expected 5 years of use. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I expected to have a drive that at the very least lasted 3 yrs. </s>
<s> But yea you are right, just have to watch out. </s>
<s> I have had problems with this company before. </s>
<s> With these DVDRW drives hitting 20 bucks they last 1 or 2 years under &quot;use.&quot; Dell has no exclusive on these failures. </s>
<s> You should see them on all make machines. </s>
<s> At least we are talking under 40 for most desktops. </s>
