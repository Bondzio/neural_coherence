i have recently aquired a new pc ibm 6349 72g and the monitor does not work i have encountered this problem before with a different computer and all i had to do was take out the graphics card, reinsert it then switch to recovery on the motherboard, this may have done soemthing but i still cant see the monitor i think it is because the monitor socket is on the graphics card, is there an onboard graphics card?
is there any way of fixing this problem?
the computer is windows 2000 pentium 4 its an nvidia grahpics card but i dont know the exact model
