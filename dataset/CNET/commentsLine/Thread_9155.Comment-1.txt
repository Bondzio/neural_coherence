i was able to obtain some free office equipment that consisted of a netgear wireless bridge and an axis communications print server.
is it possible to create a wireless print server on my home network through a wireless-g linksys router without having to go out and buy a wireless print server?
i can configure the bridge and printer server seperately via direct connection to the router, but could not get anything to print when i hooked up the printer server to the bridge through a crossover cable.
any ideas?
thanks!
