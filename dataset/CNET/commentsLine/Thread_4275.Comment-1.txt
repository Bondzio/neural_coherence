i have winxp pro with a 2.4g p4, 512 ram, and trying the following on the nec dvd-rw 1100. i'm trying to get the drive to play a music cd so i can plug my headphones into the jack on the front panel of the drive.
is there a utility that will cause this to work?
i've tried letting windows media player run the cd and can hear through speakers, etc.
but if i plug headphones into the front jack i hear nothing through the headphones.
i can unplug the speakers and plug the headphones into the sound card and hear fine.
i'm trying to troubleshoot a &quot;static-like&quot; pop or click that occurs only when a wav sound file, streaming media, mp3 or a cd is played through the system sound card.
there is only the insert/eject button, the volume control and the headphone jack on the drive itself.
perhaps i should be using a particular type of headphones?
i'm using my koss pro/4x stereo headphones.
thanks, ron
