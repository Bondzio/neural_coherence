<s> Awhile ago I was watching a video on CNET.TV. </s>
<s> Veronica Belmont was instructing us how to use two computers with one iPod, and NOT lose all your files. </s>
<s> Can anyone provide me with the link to that? </s>
<s> Or something similar? </s>
<s> So here's the URL, i don't know if this was exactly what you were looking for, but I think it's close http://help.cnet.com/9602-12576_39-0.html?messageID=2505129&tag=tip-2505129-search </s>
<s> but if you turn OFF the automatic update, in iTunes preferences, on each machine. </s>
<s> You will then be able to attach the ipod to either machine without loosing any music tracks. </s>
<s> To put music onto the iPod, you would drag and drop from iTunes to the mounted iPod. </s>
<s> Hope this helps P Post 3 of 3 | Previous </s>
