i used to do it whenever i changed something inside - maybe 2 or 3 times a year - quite the project, especially these days with the cpu cooler fins and a dust depositor right above.
but - just in there today after 3 months - zip when i built this current pc - i went with a full tower.
added 4 120mm fans and put filters over all the vents in the case and over the fans.
today i vacuumed off the filters.
not even a trace of dust inside.
wonderfull!!
:-))) they make filters for house forced air vents about 4 inches wide and 12 or so long and about 1/2 inch thich - easy to cut and i just taped them every where air would get into the case.
