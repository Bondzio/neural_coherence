When I insert it into my laptop it automatically display AutoPlay diaolg. However, when I plug it into my desktop PC it doesnt display automatically, so i have to use 'my computer' to navigate my way to it and open the files. This is a bit of a nuisance, is there any way I can re-instate this action on my desktop PC? Strangely, if I insert another flash drive it opens up on both computers as normal! Has anyone any ideas as to why? P.S. I am discover that flash drives with FAT32 don't have AutoPlay on my desktop PC, FAT work fine, NTFS i am not tried.

I have discovered that when i plug in flash which is under FAT file system, on my monitor AUTOPPLAY dialog shows and then i can choose action. When i plug in this USB, with 4 GB memory, which is under FAT32 system, this dialog does not appear, so i must go to MY COMPUTER and then i can go to USB.When i put one USB FLASH, which belongs to my friend, which is under NTFS, the dialog box automatically appears? What is the problem? Is the file system in some connection with running FLASh? Can i use FLASH under NTSF?
