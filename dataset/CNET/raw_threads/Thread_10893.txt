Im looking for it to be a decently powerful machine that i can game on, although im not too much of a gamer. I have a hard-drive and a few components already but I dont understand much about motherboards or CPU's or how to choose one. I would like to splurge a little bit out of budget for these two since theyre a little more essential.
