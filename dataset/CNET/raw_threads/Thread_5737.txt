The folders disappeared and then the disk could not be detected till now. The external hard drive is composed of 2 500GB SATA drives. The external HD started also to make a noise like a watch (tic tic tic) I tried the following options: - connect another different usb cable - connect the external HD in other computers - configure as slave each HD in a computer (both were recognised but asked to format Those options did not work. Maybe it could be that the board controller is crashed, I really don't know. I hope I found here some solutions! Thanks in advance. Regards, Francisco Domingues

Someone knows some tutorial or how to recover data from a crashed or non-responding disk? I have to re-build the array in RAID with the two disks? A new array will recognise that there is data there? Thanks for any help!

So does the plumber and the programmer and even the cleaner. So would you, if you could. But you can't. Users must choose between backup (too late now), lose, pay or pray (that hardware won't fail). Some people learn about backup too late. Sorry to see you're one of them. Kees

As the data was not so crucial we kept it there. I will try to input another controller and see if it works. Them if I have luck I can say that you were wrong and not always we must be supported by some data recovery company. Regards!
3122	10	290925	2748337	2748328	Kees Bakker	4/10/08 5:32 AM	1.20780552E12	Hope you succeed.	Btw, why is it insane to have a backup of a 1 Tb drive? That's just another Tb drive. Or, if you prefer, 13 tape cartridges, like those from http://accessories.euro.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=uk&l=en&s=bsd&cs=ukbsdt1&sku=440-10710&~lt=popup&~ck=TopSellers . But those are somewhat slow: 30 Gb an hour is a some 33 hours for a terabyte. And you've got to change tapes 12 times during the operation. Anyway, it isn't crucial, so it might not be a big problem if it isn''t recovered. Kees

3122	13	290925	2748369	2748358	R. Proffitt	4/10/08 6:13 AM	1.20780798E12	In a sentence.	&quot;I don't backup what I can lose.&quot; Or the corollary: &quot;I backup what I can't lose.&quot; Your claim it would be ridiculous to backup 1TB to which my thought is that there is usually something less than 1TB that needs a backup.

I am not here to listen to people trying to put me down or judging my actions. I look for a solution here. So, please do not reply that way. Thanks!
3122	15	290925	2748402	2748382	R. Proffitt	4/10/08 6:52 AM	1.20781032E12	We have SOLUTIONS above.	The question is this sub discussion is about backups. If you feel I must not share my thoughts and methods, just say so and it's gone. bob

Bob mentioned drivesavers. Let me add www.ontrackdatarecovery.com. Now you've two solutions. Or, if you prefer, one solution and an opportunity for a second opinion. Want more? Forget about doing this yourself, and don't complain about that fact here in this forum, please. Kees

Some people are not welcoming and just saying stupid sentences. I have two points to clarify here. If I'd know that here the solution I get is some websites that any idiot could find searching internet I'd never come to this forum. Of course the first thing one thinks is data recovery. I wanted technical help and solutions not evidences. So, now its clear that my passage here is over. bye! ps: if the problem here is my english I am not native english speaker, hopefuly.
