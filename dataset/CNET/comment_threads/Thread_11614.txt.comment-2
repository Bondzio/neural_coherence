of extension cord or just one of those cheapies that you normally use for a table lamp?
You would need to use one that is heavy duty and made for things such as power drills, saws, etc otherwise the extension cord overheats and your system will shut down to protect itself.
If this still isn't the answer to what's happening, open your case and make sure all fans are running properly inside, especially the one on the CPU.
Get some canned compressed air and blow out all the dirt and dust.
Also try reseating the RAM stick(s)...my daughter just had the same problem that she mentioned yesterday while I was talking with her and helping her get a new video card installed.
Once she unclipped the two ram sticks and reseated them, the problem stopped happening.
