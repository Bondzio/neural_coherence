hi all.
i have a dell dimension 3000, p4, 3.2gh, 1gb ram, and would like to upgrade the cpu to a pentium d or other dual-core.
i've never done a processor upgrade before... i need to know 1) is this possible or even sensible?
2) which cpu to buy & where (best prices)?
3) show me where i can find step-by-step instructions?
thanks!
