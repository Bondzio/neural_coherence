If you have a 2.5 notebook drive, you may need an adapter to fit the 3.5 standard drive cable.
But you would hook the drive you want the information off of as the slave (change jumper to slave) on the second channel of you IDE Cable.
Make sure that the primary hard drive on this machine has its jumper set to be master and not Cable Select as sometimes the case.
Once the hard drives are connected to the IDE Channel and both have power and jumpered correctly, you should be able to see it once you boot up and then just Drag and drop.
