Sorry, I thought everyone would automatically assume that I've installed the drivers.
Well, I have already installed the drivers and everything in the Device Manager is fine.
I downloaded SIS video, SIS AGP Gart, SIS IDE, and SIS NIC drivers.
That pretty much covers the SIS 650 northbridge/ SIS 962L southbridge chipset drivers.
So what could be the culprit?
