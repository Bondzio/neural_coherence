thanks for advice 1. ive already tried putting o/s back to factory after someone told me itunes could cause it,so i wiped it and left itunes off.
2.i have a cheap graphics card so i can hook it up to my tv which works ok with audio but my monitor is dvi/vga only and i cant always use tv.
3.the pc is only just over 12month warranty by a couple of weeks how likely is it that the board could be faulty.
4.i have windows update to do all updates automatically i wouldnt no where to get right drivers or even if i was downloading the right thing.
if possible to try installing drivers could you tell me how to do it if its not to much trouble.
by the way graphics card is ati radeon hd4350 512mb gddr2 and the on board audio is realtek hd audio.
like before thanks in advance for any help
