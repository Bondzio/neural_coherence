Now obviously this comp cannot play any good games but i really want to play hl2 plus i've already bought it so my question is; how would i upgrade my current pc to get it up to scratch to play hl2? i'm currently averaging 26FPS on CS:source and the graphics look terrible! Considering i don't have an agp slot it looks like it will have to be a pci graphics card. i was thinking of perhaps getting this one: http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000E2Y7E/kelkoo-2004-ce-21/ref%3Dnosim/202-5714631-6101410 Would this card give me much of a performancew boost? is it worth it? thanks for the help guys.

The FX5200 is a good step up from your onboard video, but the reality is that it's the lowest entry point (or the MX400/4000) and you may still be unhappy. I lucked out and found a 99USD FX5700 256MB card and from what I see here, that may be the bottom of what you'll want for Half-Life 2, Doom 3 and such. Bob
