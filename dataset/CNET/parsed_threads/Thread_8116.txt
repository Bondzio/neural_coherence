<s> ok im building a gaming pc with an i5-3750k CPU... i want to mainly play diablo 3 and starcraft 2 on ultra settings, witch i believe NVDIA favors --- also looking into games such as Crysis 3, B3, and Metro witch i heard the 7950 favors because of memory/bandwidth yadda yadda yadda.. so im asking YOU PEOPLE FOR HELP !! </s>
<s> also. </s>
<s> PhysX looks sick just saying... and more games are starting to offer it -- PLEASE COMMENT. </s>
<s> *FACTS* GTX 660Ti ***VS*** Radeon HD 7950 </s>
<s> Meaning they swap places on what they each do better. </s>
<s> If it was my call and I was going to spend 300 bucks.....I'd go with the 7950. </s>
<s> Way better bandwidth. </s>
<s> im using one monitor if that makes a difference? </s>
<s> what role does bandwidth play over the 660Ti? </s>
<s> there is no price difference right now </s>
<s> I'd head to google and type in TOMSHARDWARE and then add the card in question then the word REVIEW. </s>
<s> I know they did the 7750 and recall they did the 660 so you can compare the two and pick the one that did better on the game in question. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> That refers to how fast you can feed the card. </s>
<s> For game play across multiple games this is important. </s>
<s> For game play on a specific game perhaps not so much. </s>
<s> Search for reviews........I think your going to find that overall the 7950 is the better card. </s>
