1.1.1	Hi , I 've been using the original iPad since it came out , and lately it 's really started to slow down , and it 's gotten to the point where it 's nearly impossible to watch videos on it .	St
1.1.2	From what I 've read , if certain specific fixes do n't work , ( I 've tried them and they did n't help ) then it 's most likely just a matter of the hardware getting out of date .	St
1.1.3	So now I 'm looking to upgrade .	St
1.1.4	I want something that can stream HD video ( mainly Youtube and Netflix ) smoothly and browse the web well .	St
1.1.5	( A good e-book app is a plus but is n't necessary . )	St
1.1.6	I do n't really play a lot of games on it so that is n't so much of a concern .	St
1.1.7	Could someone point me in the right direction of what kind of specs I should be looking for and/or any suggestions on devices that work well for this ?	Ques
1.2.1	It 's been the best of the lot .	St
1.2.2	At the office we have a few tablets such as the Transformer , Google Nexus 7 and a few too many others but this one is the best streamer of the lot .	St
1.2.3	It 's so good that I have it connected to the HDTV via HDMI almost all the time .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
