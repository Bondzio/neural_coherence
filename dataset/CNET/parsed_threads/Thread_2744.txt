<s> I just tried to test a hard drive in working pc ,but the DOS startup boot just says IDE hdd detected ,but not continue on , whats the problem. </s>
<s> Does that mean the hdd Im testing is faulty ? </s>
<s> please look at the screen shot http://board.softpedia.com/index.php?act=attach&type=post&id=3013 </s>
<s> Your link loaded only into an error. </s>
<s> It wasn't available then to view and I'm not going to become a member if that's the cause. </s>
<s> Next, your problem if your HD under test isn't formatted in order to get into a test mode, you should. </s>
<s> It maybe working but isn't available to be accessed depending on the nature of the problem. </s>
<s> If you haven't already. </s>
<s> Get the HD makers diags which are more readily capable of testing and/or accessing the HD w/o any OS help. </s>
<s> Of course, follow their instructions for such use and beware of destructive and non-destructive testing. </s>
<s> Also, ware of the HD jumper setting found on the HD itself via decal/sticker. </s>
<s> If not present then again visit the HD makers support website to access the required data. </s>
<s> Look into all that and come back with results. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> There are a couple of factors that might affect your problem. </s>
<s> So try to give more details, and yes your screen snap link is broken. </s>
<s> Did you check your BIOS that your HDD is detected as Master? </s>
<s> If yes, configure it as a slave and check its contents... maybe you need to reformat it completely and re-install your OS. </s>
