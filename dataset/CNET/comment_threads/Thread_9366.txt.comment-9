Maybe I worry too much!
I have the disc for Windows Vista, and the disk for Expression Web.
I believe that is all I need to register those programs on a new drive.
The reason for me not wanting to mirror my old drive to the new one is because of all the junk that accumulates after time.
I did a mirror copy when I upgraded from Windows XP to Vista, also with a new drive.
When I loaded Vista, I didn't select &quot;clean install&quot;, so a bunch of crap was left on the new drive.
Now I want to get a good start with Windows 7.
I still have one more month to worry about getting it to work.
Thanks... Ken
