1.1.1	I currently have 3 networked PCs in my house .	St
1.1.2	These are wired using high speed cable internet .	St
1.1.3	My question is should I consider going wireless with them .	St
1.1.4	There are no issues with wiring but I am wondering if wireless is faster .	St
1.1.5	Im looking at the D-Link DI-624 router with D-Link AirPlusXtremeG pci adapter .	St
1.1.6	Will this improve my speed ?	Ques
1.1.7	Would it be worth while ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	The wired speed is on a SWITCHED 100 MEGABIT HUB .	St
1.2.2	The keyword is & quot ; switched & quot ; .	St
1.2.3	You can research that it means that one computer can transfer to another witout interfering with other computers .	St
1.2.4	The Wifi-G air is shared so you get 54 megabit shared and rarely do I see the 108 megabit work out except at close range .	St

1.3.1	As Bob has already pointed out , wireless is not faster .	St
1.3.2	Even if it were faster , your internet would n't be any faster because that speed is limited to what your cable ISP is pushing through your cable modem , and that is probably much much much slower than the worst wireless network speeds .	St
1.3.3	So , the only reason to change your wired setup is to incorporate new features .	St
1.3.4	With wireless , if you have a laptop computer , you can move it around the house at will - work at the kitchen table , in the living room , upstairs , downstairs , where ever .	St
1.3.5	If you want to stream mp3 music to your home stereo , you can do that wirelessly and not have to install a new network outlet behind the hi-fi rack .	St
1.3.6	And there will undoubtedly be as-yet unimagined new devices in the future .	St
1.3.7	The downside to wireless is you introduce a whole new set of security administration issues .	St
1.3.8	So IMO do n't do it unless you have a definite plan for something that ca n't be done with your existing wires .	St

1.4.1	Thanks for the info guys .	St
1.4.2	I think I 'll keep what I have and go wireless when i purchase a laptop .	St
