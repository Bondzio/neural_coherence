I'm not sure if I found the right list but my modem model(DCM305) was on the list of cable modems approved for use with the Comcast High-Speed Internet Service at http://www.comcast.net/help/faq/index.jsp?faq=ConnectionCable_Modems17905 This list might not be up-to-date so could you please check if mine is on the list you were referring to or send me a link?
Also, I've tested my download speed and it's maxing out at only 1.5mbps when it was maxing out at 6.2mbps only a few months ago.
