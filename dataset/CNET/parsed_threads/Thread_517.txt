<s> If a motherboard, such as my Gigabyte GA-6BXC, has settings to allow a maximum of FSB 133MHz and clock ratio of up to 9.5 will the board support processors up to 133x9.5? </s>
<s> My GA-6BXC manual says it will only support a FSB up to 100MHz, but does not state a max clock ratio for the speed, will it support a 950MHz CPU? </s>
<s> The latest BIOS update gives support for a Celeron 733 but no Pentium is noted. </s>
<s> Please help, I'm looking to upgrade the processor. </s>
<s> had the multiplier locked. </s>
<s> No matter if the mobo had jumpers to set a multiplier, the CPU simply ignored it. </s>
<s> The availability to modify the multiplier only came back about in the last year. </s>
<s> In most of them they are top locked but one could elect a lower multiplier. </s>
<s> Overclockers did this and then overclocked the memory buss and overall got improved processing speed. </s>
<s> What CPU are you running in it at this time?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Also, you should see what the motherboard maker's website lists for compatible CPUs. </s>
<s> If you try something not on the list, then it's your experiment... Bob </s>
