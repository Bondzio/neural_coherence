I have been using it for one year and have not upgraded the firmware. Should I attempt it or just leave well enough alone. Security? Should I disable the SSID broadcast? I have the WEP enabled. I then enabled the WPA-PSK. Do they both work together or am I just using one of them? My system works fine as it is. I have an old P2-Dell PC running Win 98 wired to the router as well as an HP laptop with Win XP home. The laptop is used for the most part wired but is used occasionally for wireless access.

Security: SSID broadcast.. up to you... its not a security matter anyway.. its only show that your wireless is available. WEP + WPA-PSK .. again if its work then use both.. As for security, add MAC Filtering..

I always keep it up to date. WEP and WPA simultaneously? You just get one. Some good wireless security practices: - enable WEP or WPA - disable SSID broadcast - use strong passwords/keys - change wireless password regularly - enable MAC filtering - don't use default SSID, router name, admin password - don't let range of broadcast go too far outside home.
