1.1.1	I remember awhile back I saw a link somewhere on how to do this , including extensive pictures on how to take it apart , but I can no longer find it even through google Does anybody know of a good site on how to do it properly ?	Ques
1.1.2	Thanks ...	Polite
1.2.1	Can you tell us what model it is ?	Ques
1.2.2	Is it a PowerPC iMac or does it use an Intel processor ?	Ques
1.2.3	There have been many different iMacs since the original G3 , so you need to be more specific .	St
1.2.4	There are plenty of sites that offer memory installation guides .	St
1.2.5	Google would be a good place to start .	St
1.2.6	Apple actually has some on their support site , so feel free to look there .	St
1.2.7	It should n't be too hard though .	St
1.2.8	The newer models have an enclosure that comes out , and I know that the G4s had their memory under the base plate ( or on top , depending which way you look at it ) .	St
1.2.9	With some more info , you 'll be able to install some RAM in no time .	St
1.2.10	-BMF	St
1.3.1	It 's about three years old .	St
1.3.2	Which means it uses the Motorola - IBM chip .	St
1.3.3	I just need visual instructions on how to take the back off without breaking it .	St
1.3.4	Once I do that and find the RAM slots , I 'll be OK .	St
1.3.5	So do you know a good place ?	Ques
1.4.1	NOTHING is removed when replacing RAM .	St
1.4.2	Just confirm for me that your iMac has a slot in which to slide CD/DVD 's and NOT a tray that pops out .	St
1.4.3	If it is a slot , turn the computer off , unplug everything and place it , screen down , on a soft surface .	St
1.4.4	A towel on a table will suffice .	St
1.4.5	On the bottom of the iMac you will see a panel with a slotted , circular piece in it .	St
1.4.6	It will have a two padlock symbols next to it .	St
1.4.7	( one locked and one unlocked . )	St
1.4.8	The circular piece has a pointer which would normally be pointing toward the locked symbol With a screw driver , turn the circular piece toward the unlocked symbol .	St
1.4.9	Open the panel .	St
1.4.10	Inside you will see the two RAM slots .	St
1.4.11	They both may be occupied .	St
1.4.12	At both ends of each slot you will see a white clip .	St
1.4.13	Push down both ends to release the RAM module .	St
1.4.14	( you can do one end at a time ) To insert the RAM , make sure the slots in the RAM module are correctly oriented with the guides in the slots , push down firmly at both ends , preferably at the same time , until the white clips snap up into place .	St
1.4.15	Shut and lock the panel .	St
1.4.16	If your machine has a CD tray , let us know .	St
1.4.17	That is a whole different ball game .	St
1.4.18	P	St
1.5.1	Check this page out P	St
1.6.1	It 's the white flat-panel one-piece with a white stand and a slot on the side that you load DVDs into .	St
1.6.2	It does n't have any chrome on it like the new ones .	St
1.6.3	Sorry .	St
1.7.1	http : //www.cheapest-ipod.com/index.php/2007/09/04/apple-claims-imacs-are-outselling-pcs/	St
1.8.1	Seeing that you made the comparison to the newer aluminum models , I think that we are dealing with an iMac G5 .	St
1.8.2	Go to About This Mac ( Click on the Apple on the top left of your screen to find it ) and tell us what PowerPC chip it says it has , just to make sure .	St
1.8.3	Now , supposing that it is a G5 , does it have an iSight Camera built into the screen ?	Ques
1.8.4	It would be right on top of the screen in the white area .	St
1.8.5	If that 's the one , here are the instructions on how to add or remove RAM .	St
1.8.6	If it is a G5 , but pre-dates the iSight models , instructions may differ , but I doubt it .	St
1.8.7	The models with the iSight camera will have 512MB of RAM soldered to the logic board , so you 'd only have one slot to work with .	St
1.8.8	The max you could add into it would be a 2GB stick , totaling 2.5GB of RAM .	St
1.8.9	Hope this helps , -BMF	St
1.9.1	We need some specifics .	St
1.9.2	Read my other post below .	St
1.9.3	Again , look up About This Mac and tell us what it says .	St
1.9.4	If this machine has a PowerPC chip like you said , then it would be a G5 with iSight after all , if that picture is any indication .	St
1.9.5	-BMF	St
1.10.1	Now you see why it is important to read , and follow , the RED instructions on top of every post you make No worries , P	St
1.11.1	It 's for my mom 's machine and I do n't happen to have it here in front of me at the moment .	St
1.11.2	Next time I go out to her house , she wants me to install the RAM for her .	St
1.11.3	Since I 've never cracked one open so I thought I 'd ask here first .	St
1.11.4	Yes , it is an all-white , plastic flat-panel one piece iMac PowerPC with 512MB of RAM already installed , running OS X Tiger .	St
1.11.5	It looks similar to the picture I posed eariler .	St
1.11.6	I do n't know what iSight is .	St
1.11.7	When she bought the machine new , it already had OS X Tiger on it installed .	St
1.11.8	Since Apple does n't put their model numbers in plain sight , I did n't make note of it while I was out there .	St
1.11.9	I think it 's the correct machine .	St
1.11.10	( ? )	Ques
1.12.1	iSight is a camera that is positioned in the middle of the top of the front case .	St
1.12.2	Small round hole .	St
1.12.3	Here is what we would like you to do .	St
1.12.4	Phone your Mom and , while you have her on the phone , tell her to go to the Apple Menu ( little Apple at the top left of the screen ) and select & quot ; About this Mac & quot ; ( or words to that effect ) .	St
1.12.5	When the winodow pops open , tell her to click on the More Info button .	St
1.12.6	Tell her to read , out loud , everything she sees on the first page , tell her to read slowly as you will be writing this down .	St
1.12.7	Post here what you wrote down .	St
1.12.8	If this turns out to be a iMac G5 with no iSight installed , replacing the RAM involves removing the rear cover and stand .	St
1.12.9	Instructions Here but if it is an iMac G5 with iSight installed , your task is easier .	St
1.12.10	Instructions Here P	St
1.13.1	iMAC 5.2 512MB of RAM Core 2 Duo ( I thought it was too old to be that ) 1.83GHz processor So much for believing there are only a couple of models of this .	St
1.14.1	-	St
1.15.1	Not sure what you mean by that ... Just a note , but try refraining from saying MAC or iMAC .	St
1.15.2	MAC means Media Access Control and is related to networking .	St
1.15.3	A Mac is an Apple branded computer .	St
1.15.4	Here are instructions for working with those early C2D iMacs .	St
1.15.5	You can install up to 3GB of RAM .	St
1.15.6	You can put in 4GB of RAM , but it will only use 3GB .	St
1.15.7	Most people will only need 2GB , so if it has just 512MB right now , replace the 512MB module with a pair of 1GB sticks .	St
1.15.8	Follow the instructions on the provided link and you 'll be good to go .	St
1.15.9	RAM is really cheap right now , except for Apple 's RAM prices .	St
1.15.10	Then again , most manufacturers charge more for memory than what you can get it online .	St
1.15.11	You can get the same Samsung sticks for much less all over .	St
1.15.12	-BMF	St
1.16.1	That 's what she said .	St
1.16.2	I know she 's been complaining about how slow her iMAC is , so when I get a chance to get at her machine , I 'll probably just go to Crucial 's website and do an online scan and see how much I can put in there .	St
1.16.3	They have an online Apple scan tool now , and I 've had good luck with Crucial RAM for PCs for a number of years now .	St
1.17.1	Wow !	St
1.17.2	We came a long way with this one .	St
1.17.3	Guess there is a job for BMF and I at the IRS .	St
1.17.4	At least you have the easy machine to change RAM on P	St
1.18.1	( laughs ) : ^D Yeah , that 's what happens when I have n't seen mom for a few months .	St
1.18.2	I could have sworn she bought the machine in 2005 and not 2006 .	St
1.18.3	Oh well , a Core 2 Duo is a pleasant surprise .	St
1.19.1	Or not : P. So we went all the way from a G3 to a 1.83Ghz iMac ?	Ques
1.19.2	That 's a short jump is n't it ?	Ques
1.19.3	LOL .	St
1.19.4	-BMF	St
1.20.1	I wan na upgrade to the max my 97 Imac 5.2 with 2x512 RAM and a core 2 duo processor , and still I 'm not sure about how much I can upgrade it .	St
1.20.2	I probably didnt read the previous posts carefully .	St
1.20.3	Question one : what is the maximum of RAM i can put in it ?	Ques
1.20.4	Two : Is it worth changing the processor at this point to be able to run it with even more RAM ?	Ques
1.20.5	Thank you very much and sorry about having you repeating things	St
1.21.1	wan na upgrade to the max my 97 Imac 5.2 with 2x512 RAM and a core 2 duo processor , and still I 'm not sure about how much I can upgrade it .	St
1.21.2	I probably didnt read the previous posts carefully .	St
1.21.3	Question one : what is the maximum of RAM i can put in it ?	Ques
1.21.4	Two : Is it worth changing the processor at this point to be able to run it with even more RAM ?	Ques
1.21.5	Thank you very much and sorry about having you repeating things I 'm not sure that you actually have an 97 iMac as Apple did not make them then .	St
1.21.6	So , to be able to help you , we will need to know what sort of iMac it is .	St
1.21.7	Choices are : 1 .	St
1.21.8	Teardrop shape , color other than white , Optical drive has a tray .	St
1.21.9	( sticks out the front when open ) 2 .	St
1.21.10	As above but the optical drive has a slot .	St
1.21.11	( in the front ) 3 .	St
1.21.12	White , has a half ball base and an LCD monitor on a chrome stand ( G4 processor ) 4 .	St
1.21.13	White , slim , all in one design .	St
1.21.14	Looks like it is just a monitor .	St
1.21.15	( G5 processor ) 5 .	St
1.21.16	As above , screen fills most of the front .	St
1.21.17	( Intel processor ) 6 .	St
1.21.18	Aluminum ( silver ) , black Apple logo on the front , looks similar to # 5 , ( Intel processor ) Go to the Apple menu ( top right of the screen ) and select About this Mac .	St
1.21.19	In the next window , choose More Info .	St
1.21.20	Copy the hardware overview section and paste it into your reply .	St
1.21.21	REMOVE the serial number before you submit the post .	St
1.21.22	Oh yes , it is not feasible to change the processors out on these machines .	St
1.21.23	P	St
1.22.1	Thanks for the trouble i meant 2007 ! ! !	St
1.22.2	SORRY	St
1.23.1	5t 's me again , I should have started there .	St
1.23.2	Anyway , these are the specs .	St
1.23.3	: Model IDENTIFIER : IMAC 5.2 PROCESSOR NAME : Intel Core 2 Duo Processor Speed :	St
1.24.1	will accept 4GB of RAM , it sold with 1GB as two 512MB sticks .	St
1.24.2	You can not easily , if at all , change the processor .	St
1.24.3	The HD can be upgraded , no easily though .	St
1.24.4	Putting serial numbers in these posts is not a good idea .	St
1.24.5	I did ask you to remove it before posting .	St
1.24.6	I 'll get it removed .	St
1.24.7	Anything else ?	Ques
1.24.8	P	St
1.25.1	Technically , you should be able to put in 4GB of RAM , like Peter said , but know that your particular iMac might only recognize 3.3GB of the total amount .	St
1.25.2	Memory prices from third-parties are n't too bad these days , so if you think your iMac is a good computer and worth a small investment , I say go for it .	St
1.25.3	You 'd have a tough time trying to swap out the CPU ; they do n't use off-the-shelf parts and your iMac is already a bit old .	St
1.25.4	In fact , iMacs contain a lot of laptop components , usually very similar or identical to their MacBook equivalents .	St
1.25.5	Prices for the chips themselves would fetch a pretty penny .	St
1.25.6	And then considering the cost of the memory sticks , you 'd probably have a decent sum of money that could be better spent on new peripherals or maybe even a new machine in the future .	St
1.25.7	Go for the RAM upgrade .	St
1.25.8	Good luck .	Polite
1.25.9	-BMF	St
1.26.1	I 'll just go for the RAM upgrade then .	St
1.26.2	Thanks to you both .	St
1.26.3	I 'd appreciate if you could have the serial removed from the post .	St
1.26.4	Slipped my mind , I know .	St
1.26.5	T .	St
1.27.1	NIL	St
