1.1.1	I 've done three builds in my life ... all of them have eventually ended with a fried motherboard .	St
1.1.2	Am I doing something wrong ?	Ques
1.1.3	Should there be some kind insulator between the metal standoffs/board/screws ?	Ques
1.2.1	okay ?	Ques
1.2.2	Are you using a UPS ?	Ques
1.2.3	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	no .	Res
1.3.2	just a surge protector .	St
1.3.3	and i 've never had a problem with the prebuilt systems i 've had ... .just the ones i 've built .	St
1.3.4	maybe a string of bad luck	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	On the last one I used an Antec Truepower 2.0 550 Watt .	St
1.5.2	I checked the voltages on the p1 & p4 connectors ... it still seems to be providing good power .	St
1.5.3	I 'm not completely sure the board is what 's bad on this one ( i do n't see any blown caps ) ... i 'm leaning that way though .	St
1.5.4	I get nothing on the screen when I boot but all the fans come on & the soft power led on the board lights up .	St
1.5.5	I 've tried a different cpu .	St
1.5.6	Put a multimeter to the psu ... it checks out .	St
1.5.7	I tried an old PCI graphics card to no avail .	St
1.5.8	I 'm not sure this board supports pci graphics ... i do n't see why it would n't .	St
1.5.9	I have two sticks of 1gb ddr2 i was running in it .	St
1.5.10	I swapped both of those in & out , so it 's not the ram unless both sticks died at the same time .	St
1.6.1	system , I always pull the MB and place it on a piece of cardboard for trouble shooting .	St
1.6.2	Then clear the BIOS and check/replace the CMOS battery .	St
1.6.3	( I start with cardboard for all PCs I build ) .	St
1.6.4	Re the PCI graphics ... give it a try .	St
1.6.5	Re standoffs ... .I use only 2 or 3 brass standoffs and for the rest I use the old plastic standoffs with the bottoms cut off .	St
1.6.6	Have n't used the paper washers for years .	St
1.6.7	VAPCMD	St
1.7.1	Any chance we can have the make/ model number of the motherboard , so we can possibly dig a little deeper into this puzzle ?	Ques
1.8.1	The board is an Asus A8N-E .	St
1.9.1	I 've since moved to an i860 and Win 7 .	St
1.9.2	Might see what the ASUS forum has for the A8N-E MB ?	Ques
1.9.3	VAPCMD	St
1.10.1	What about ESD ?	Ques
1.10.2	Do you use anything else besides the cardboard ?	Ques
1.10.3	Sometimes I 'll use a wriststrap , sometimes I just try to touch the case .	St
1.10.4	I wonder if this could be the root of all my problems .	St
1.10.5	I 've never been exactly sure how sensitive the components are .	St
1.10.6	I 've heard some say they never worry about and others say you have to be extremely careful .	St
1.11.1	cause for component failure after extended use .	St
1.11.2	Right wrong or otherwise I think of ESD as killing something immediately vice days , weeks or months later .	St
1.11.3	Advice re handling ... never touch components parts .. like RAM , CPUs , MBs , GPUs , etc. , ... except by the edges .	St
1.11.4	Thus far ... 20 plus years , that 's served me well .	St
1.11.5	VAPCMD	St
1.12.1	In regards to your last 3 BYOPC 's : 1 ) Was it the same make and model of motherboard ?	Ques
1.12.2	2 ) How long before the system went belly-up ?	Ques
1.12.3	3 ) Can I post your original message on the ASUS forums ( with the addition of of the make/ model # 's included ) ?	Ques
1.13.1	1 .	St
1.13.2	They were not the same boards .	St
1.13.3	My first build was a an Athlon Thunderbird ... I ca n't remember the make & model of the first board that fried but I want to say it was Asus .	St
1.13.4	I had a tech replace that for me with a Jetway V266B which also fried .	St
1.13.5	The Jetway has some pretty obvious blown caps .	St
1.13.6	2 .	St
1.13.7	It was probably more than a year before it bit the dust .	St
1.13.8	It 's been sitting in my closet for a few months .	St
1.13.9	I 'm just now getting around to resurrecting it .	St
1.13.10	3.Please do .	St
1.14.1	you know how it is .	St
1.14.2	Anyway , have been checking through the ASUS forums ( so many questions , so many problems , sooo many pages ) and have still a few more questions .	St
1.14.3	Can you recall ( before you put this mobo in the closet ) what symtoms it had before the computer died ?	Ques
1.14.4	-BSOD -constant or random crashing -PSU working , mobo power light on but no power to rest of the computer -system stops before getting to POST screen -fan warning at startup , & quot ; Chip fan speed too low & quot ; -smoke , flames ?	Ques
1.14.5	The one problem I did see noted quite often was the failure of the chipset fan .	St
1.14.6	But aside from this , if you could answer these quesitons , I might be able to dig deeper in to ASUS	St
1.15.1	Not a problem .	St
1.15.2	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.15.3	It 's been a while since it crashed .	St
1.15.4	But here 's what i can remember : -Do n't recall any BSODs -there was some random crashing growing more frequent towards then end -the psu seems to be working .	St
1.15.5	the light comes on all fans spin .	St
1.15.6	the voltages check out on a multimeter -nothing displays on the screen at all .	St
1.15.7	like the monitor is n't plugged in .	St
1.15.8	no beep codes either -no fan warnings -no smoke or fire The chipset fan does turn .	St
1.16.1	http : //www.badcaps.net/pages.php ? vid=5	Ques
1.17.1	is it new or older ?	Ques
