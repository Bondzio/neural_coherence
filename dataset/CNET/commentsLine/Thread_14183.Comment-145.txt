it was an ibm ps/2 model 4, if i remember correctly.
i bought it in 1986 or 1987 because i was taking a graduate level course in technical writing and editing at n.c. state university and, since i was working full time, i didn't want to have to rely on a computer being available in their lab for doing the coursework.
it was fairly expensive, about $4,500.
i had to buy an apple laserjet printer because no other laser printer was available at the time.
the printer cost about $4,000 and weighed a ton.
the salesperson had to write a macro for me to run each time i needed to turn the printer on so the apple printer could talk to the ibm pc (they should put that in their commercial).
i have neither the computer nor the printer now.
