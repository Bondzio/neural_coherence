hi audrey.. you may have noticed i locked the thread you created at the &quot;audio & video software forum&quot;.
i noted, it's in your best interest, as well as those helping you, to only post at one forum.
in addition to the above thread, you also posted the same thing at the vista forum and spyware, viruses & security forum .
please follow-up on one thread only.
again, i thank you for your cooperation.. carol
