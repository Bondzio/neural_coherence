Had a tough time removing them. I suspect that damaged the nozzles. Changing cartridges did not help. Unlike some other mfg printers, the Epson nozzles are not part of the cartridge. I tried everything you did & everything the Epson Help desk suggested except taking it to one of their repair stations.
