i just upgraded my motherboard to a pc chips m863g, and i'm having some trouble with it getting to boot.
in short, there is no booting.
no beeping, no flashing, so then there's most likely a short about.
the last time i tried to install a motherboard, i had this exact problem.
i ended up taking it to a technician, and when he fixed it up, and i asked him what the problem was, he told me that something to the effect of my cpu clock being off sync with my fsb, or something.
to this day, i have no idea how to adjust that setting on the motherboard, and i'm becoming pretty frustrated.
the manual is total garbage.
and if anyone already has had experience with this board, i did plug in the 4-pin power plug as well as adjusted the cmos jumper.
specs: proc: amd athlon xp 2400+ ram: kingston ddr400 512mb gpu: nvidia geforce 5500 fx plus a lite-on cd/dvd drive and another atapi dvd drive and two running virtual drives
