1.1.2	We tape on a Canon Vixia HF-10 onto an SD card and the format is AVCHD .	St
1.1.3	I am looking for a low cost way to take the chip out , put it into a netbook , view them , and then upload the videos they want to our secure server .	St
1.1.4	No need to edit the clips .	St
1.1.5	After scouring online , I discovered the new Lenovo S12 comes equipped with the Ion Nvidia graphics engine .	St
1.1.6	Is that the best option ?	Ques

1.1.8	I am a Mac person , so I know nothing about Windows based machines .	St
1.1.9	Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	Play the clip from the camcorder to some HDTV .	St
1.2.2	This sidesteps all the issues of playback on a netbook .	St
1.2.3	And if you ask if it will play , it might but only YOU can tell by testing it .	St
1.2.4	I know I could use a video converter ( I use Super ) to make it into something playable but if we skip the netbook for playback we now have a cheap uploader .	St

1.3.1	Good call .	St
1.3.2	I will go to Best Buy and try out a few netbooks .	St
