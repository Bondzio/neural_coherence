1.1.1	I have a Gateway MA7 MX5669 running Windows 7 that will power up but the only activity that can be seen is the CD Rom and the hard drive startup for a few seconds .	St
1.1.2	I tried a trick that I read about where you press the 'on ' key down for 60 seconds with the battery removed and then plug it in .	St
1.1.3	It is supposed to bleed off some residual charge in the PC but it did not work for me.I removed reinserted and then removed the two 1gb memory sticks .	St
1.1.4	No beeps nothing different than before .	St
1.1.5	I have hooked the laptop up to an external monitor.Nothing .	St
1.1.6	All the usual power lights are on and the fan is running as normal .	St
1.1.7	It is as if the normal bootup got truncated after about 5 seconds .	St
1.1.8	I am thinking it is the motherboard because of not hearing any beeps when I removed the memory but I am also wondering if it is possible it could be something else like the video card .	St
1.1.9	I would be very happy for it to be the video board .	St
1.1.10	What I am wondering is if anyone can tell me where I might go from here to determine what the issue is .	St
1.1.11	Thanks very much , Jim Lee	St
1.2.1	Try the generic reset ( power off , remove battery , ac , press+hold power button for 60 seconds , release and test . )	St
1.2.2	Yes I read you tried it but you did n't tell if the AC was removed .	St
1.2.3	And it 's not a & quot ; bleed off. & quot ; I can only guess some web site wrote that and we now get folk saying this .	St
1.2.4	But I read you think there is a video card .	St
1.2.5	Very few laptops have such .	St
1.2.6	Less than a percent point ( much lower ! )	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	Get your hands on a & quot ; Live version of Ubuntu Linux & quot ; .	St
1.3.2	Burn to disc and using the .ISO file gotten from some website .	St
1.3.3	This should if burnt properly maker a bootable CD .	St
1.3.4	Once done , insert into laptop CD drive and hopefully it gets accessed to boot .	St
1.3.5	If not , you know further its a mtrbd .	St
1.3.6	issue .	St
1.3.7	Also , if any display becomes present , record it to post back .	St
1.3.8	If nothing , again , this relates to mtrbd..	St
1.3.9	If any warranty , use it .	St
1.3.10	Last , if this laptop is known to run & quot ; hot & quot ; and very hot at that , the mtrbd .	St
1.3.11	or its components get fried and anything can happen to include not working .	St
1.3.12	Offhand , it appears the video got hosed , if all LEDs suggest its up and running .	St
1.3.13	As last resort , a teardown is required to inspect the innards .	St
1.3.14	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	My samsung laptop with windows 7 wont power up properly from sleep mode .	St
1.5.1	Sorry but I already gave the usual above .	St
1.5.2	You should start your own discussion and if you completed the reset noted .	St
1.5.3	Locking this old post .	St
