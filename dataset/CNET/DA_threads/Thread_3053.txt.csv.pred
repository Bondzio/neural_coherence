1.1.1	I just purchased all the custom parts to make my new system , but I have run into an annoying snag .	St
1.1.2	My Seagate Barracuda HD is not being detected in BIOS , and thus wont allow me install Vista .	St
1.1.3	Any help would be appreciated , and any further details easily given .	Polite
1.1.4	My Motherboard : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16813128074 My Hard Drive : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16822148288 -Thanks	Ques
1.2.1	Do you mean that you cant see it in your POST screen ( all the lines of tekst when you computer is starting ) or you ca n't see the hard drive when your in the vista installation .	St
1.2.2	If you dont see it in the post , you can try going in the bios and check if the channels are n't disabled or anything else disabled .	St
1.2.3	If that doesnt help just look if you connected you hard drive correctly and the power cable is connected , sometimes it will help if you connect to an other port .	St
1.2.4	If you dont see the harddrive in vista , then you have to install the sata drivers so the harddrive can be recognized .	St
1.2.5	When you have to select your harddrive under that screen is an option to install extra drivers , click on it and put in your motherboard disk or your manufacturers driver disk .	St
1.3.1	I bet if all the hardware is good you did n't configure the BIOS to enable the SATA ports .	St
1.3.2	I decline to read the manual for you on this one since I really need to spend more time on a project here but it sounds like you did n't setup the BIOS .	St
1.3.3	It 's not automatic .	St
1.3.4	Bob	St
1.4.1	The manual said to make sure the & quot ; OnChip SATA Controller & quot ; is Enabled , and then to set to the mode that you want it ( IDE , AHCI , RAID ) .	St
1.4.2	When I try to launch with IDE , it asks if I want to swap to AHCI .	St
1.4.3	I thought IDE was with the long ribbon attachment , rather then a SATA cable ?	Ques
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	Is there any way to test to see if the Hard Drive does work properly ?	Ques
1.6.2	Maybe I should get a return / replacement ?	Ques
1.7.1	I had some RAID option which made the drives vanish from that BIOS and I get to boot into another BIOS ( F10 ? )	Ques
1.7.2	to prepare the drives then Vista still would n't see them without a diskette .	St
1.7.3	Same story here I fear .	St
1.7.4	You need to try the various permutations and try SATA 1 , then 2 connections .	Sug
1.7.5	But let 's try simple .	Sug
1.7.6	Is the hard disk SPINNING ?	Ques
1.7.7	Bob	St
1.8.1	But the fact is that when I take the case off I really only hear the 4 fans inside , not so much any HD spinning .	St
1.9.1	SATA power connections look wildly different .	St
1.9.2	Find that power and get it plugged in .	St
1.10.1	There are two , and I have tried both .	St
1.10.2	Still no luck	Polite
1.11.1	To spin up a SATA drive I only need the SATA power connection and the machine to turn on .	St
1.11.2	Forget that SATA data cable for a test .	St
1.11.3	No SPIN ?	Ques
1.11.4	And we 've found & quot ; it. & quot ; Bob	St
1.12.1	I think you are having a problem with the emulation that a lot of motherboards use , the AHCI is a mode of that .	St
1.12.2	IDE means its emulated as an ide drive in the bios and also in installations .	St
1.12.3	If you arent going to run raid like strping ( 0 ) or mirroring ( 1 ) you can best use the IDE option .	St
1.12.4	becouse its most compatible	St
1.13.1	So I dont think I hear it spinning , but then I listen to my other computers hard drive and I can not really tell if its spinning either .	St
1.13.2	Under BIOS they have just the IDE Channels 0-5 Master & Slave , but no SATA .	St
1.13.3	So I really cant see if its in BIOS or not .	St
1.14.1	You could lose months on this .	Sug
1.14.2	Have someone with good hearing check it .	St
1.14.3	Bob	St
1.15.1	You dont see sata becouse the motherboard is settingc the sata drives on the screen As ide harddisks .	St
1.15.2	So all your sata drives look like ide drives but they are n't .	St
1.15.3	Do you see your drives there ?	Ques
1.16.1	So my motherboard only has one of the long IDE ribbon cable ports , and currently I only have my DVD drive plugged into the & quot ; Master & quot ; section of the ribbon cable , and then plugged into the slot .	St
1.16.2	I have two people here at work that are telling me that I should n't have the & quot ; Master & quot ; plugged into the DVD drive , rather the & quot ; Slave & quot ; , so my computer does n't see the DVD drive as the master , and thus try and load up from there .	St
1.16.3	To me , it would n't make since , seeing as how the Hard Drive is SATA , would n't that make it on a completeley different channel ?	Ques
1.16.4	But I figured I would ask before I ship my Hard Drive out ( already packaged and everything ) .	St
1.16.5	-Thanks	St
1.17.1	But the new BIOS settings can change this answer .	St
1.17.2	For example I have this new board and it emulates IDE with SATA but I must be careful which I choose .	St
1.17.3	The manual notes that for emulation ( far too many choices for me to write them all here ) that I use the SATA 1 and 3 connections will map to the Primary IDE master and slave .	St
1.17.4	The Primary IDE connector in this case is then dead and I have to use the Secondary IDE for my boot DVDRW drive .	St
1.17.5	As to master or slave or CABLE SELECT the type of IDE CABLE I use matters .	St
1.17.6	For 80 Conductor cables I use CS .	St
1.17.7	For 40 conductor cables with one drive I use master and with two drives one master and one slave .	St
1.17.8	Bob	St
1.18.1	What 's the deal here ? ?	Ques
1.18.2	I also a my sata HD powered and attached to SATA1 port and in BIOS is does n't show up .	St
1.18.3	Under SATA 1 it says [ Not Detected ] but enabled .	St
1.18.4	What gives ? ?	Ques
1.18.5	My DVD writer is an IDE and set on Slave - something else I need to fix , but that should n't effect the hard drive , right ? ?	Ques
1.18.6	The drive is softly clicking about 2x/second - is THAT the right noise ? ?	Ques
1.18.7	I never noticed all these noises from my past computers , but now that I have a problem , my ears are pricked !	St
1.19.1	If your drive does n't spin as above , have some one test it .	St
1.20.1	I have heard you need to format a HD before it 's recognized , but how can we do that if we ca n't even load an OS ?	Ques
1.20.2	?	Ques
1.21.1	You ca n't win .	St
1.21.2	Sorry for the rhyme but it 's time .	St
1.21.3	Bob	St
