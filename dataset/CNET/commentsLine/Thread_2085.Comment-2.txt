as far as i understand (somebody correct me if i'm wrong) the computer needs restarts and shutdowns to &quot;cement&quot; in changes to the system over time.
resarts and shutdowns also clear up alot of wierd problems that occour, so i always reccomend that people shut down once in awhile just so they get in the habit of using that method as a first response to clear up problems.
(this = less headaches for novice users) ;o)
