I wouldn't expect you to have any problems with that cable.
The only HDMI cables I've ever had any problems with have been the free ones I got from Comcast.
Frys once had 6' HDMI cables on sale for $2 each, and I bought 6 of them.
Not one of them has given me any problems.
For $6 you aren't risking much to give it a shot.
Good luck.
