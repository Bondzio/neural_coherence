1.1.1	I want a printer for low usage - inkjet or cheap color laser ( $ 400 ) - LOW USAGE-about 10 pages a month - moderate quality- for childrens color pictures and quick printing photos - not high quality photos - I do those thru a service - COST OF SUPPLIES & lt ; $ 150 per year my problem has been that inkjet cartridges seem to dry out in 1 or 2 months , whether they are used or not .	St
1.1.2	This leads to a yearly cost of $ 300 , much too high .	St
1.1.3	The cost per page in reviews never seem to consider this issue - will a color laser cartidge last more than a year ?	Ques
1.1.4	- are there inkjets that will last 3 months ?	Ques
1.2.1	Just forget about inkjets in general at the rate you print .	St
1.2.2	You can then look at laser printers .	St
1.2.3	But , because you want cheap then cheap is it .	St
1.2.4	Look no further than the price because many offer decent output but again , your results are what you pay for .	St
1.2.5	Most seek fantastic color but well within acceptable results for many users .	St
1.2.6	Just about all brands have a bottom-end model that fit under $ 300 or less .	St
1.2.7	Look for sales or online offerings than meet your needs .	St
1.2.8	The starter toner cart may last a yr. but it will deplete sooner only because its a small amount compared to replacement and cost should fit your wallet .	St
1.2.9	If you like you may want to try Kinko 's ( or similar ) a office/copy center that with your file or original form will reproduce at roughly 10-15cent per page .	St
1.2.10	Use this when in a pinch .	St
1.2.11	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	thanks	Polite
1.4.1	For such purposes ( and , in fact , higher volume in black text ) I 'm happy with a cheap Canon printer , especially the older types for which you can buy compatible cartridges and replace the printhead yourself ( I had to do that once ) .	St
1.4.2	Cartridges and printheads come separately .	St
1.4.3	In the unlikely case the printhead is clogged ( wo n't happen if you print each week , use the original cartridge , and leave the printer connected to the mains ) you can find ( non-Canon ) cleaning cartridges .	St
1.4.4	I had to use one of those recently after using a refilled cartridge ( not sure that was the cause , however ) .	St
1.4.5	All other cartridges ( original or compatible alike ) I could use till they were totally empty .	St
1.4.6	I also like the driver support for concept quality and printing half size ( 2 pages on one sheet ) for text .	St
1.4.7	Kees	St
1.5.1	I have four printers of varying price and the best is the lowest cost .	St
1.5.2	Paid $ 49 for an Epson C62 the cartridges ( 2 ) are sold on line for $ 4.25 and the printing quality is very good .	St
1.5.3	I have all price ranges of printers and mainly print photos .	St
