It does matter who makes or &quot;brand name&quot; on the video card.
They do vary even though the same chipset maybe used.
I can only suggest proceed with common sense.
Some covers are snug resealable ribbets or molten plastic, yet others are screwed on.
If you supply a picture(s) maybe we can offer further help.
Also, some makers use unique fans, so be prepared to substitute or find a source of fans if that's what it needs.
This like it?
