shot in the dark here, but have you recently reformatted?
if so, you'll need to install the proper drivers included with your motherboard.
just a typical troubleshooting tip, you'll have to get a bit further into detail so we know exactly what the issue is (ie; have you reformatted recently, have you changed any hardware, is your network actually working, etc.)
