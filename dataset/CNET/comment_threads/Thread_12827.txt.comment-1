I have a western digital &quot;my book essential edition&quot; external hard drive.
When i plug it into a USB 2.0 port (i've tried it on numerous computers that have USB 2.0 ports), I get a message that says the drive will run faster if connected to a USB 2.0 port.
If you use the hard drive, I have determined that it is operating rather slowly, as if its a 1.0 drive.
Its as if the USB port is not recognizing the drive as a USB 2.0 device.
Not sure what to do next as it does not appear that there is a new firmware download available and the unit is out of warranty.
Any help would be appreciated.
thanks.
