<s> Two options to ground yourself (feasible)??? </s>
<s> Buy a static wrist band and clip it to the PC metal chassis or Just touch your clean fingers into the metal chassis. </s>
<s> Someone recomended your own PC metal chassis? </s>
<s> is this good? </s>
<s> if not, what else can i use. </s>
<s> maintain contact with chassis parts as often as possible while working on, with any part of your bottom. </s>
<s> Don't pet a cat while working on the computer and don't slide across a plush carpet. </s>
<s> The difference with a wrist strap is that the ground is made through a multi megohm resistance and thus the discharge current is low enough to not cause any damage or for you to feel it.. </s>
<s> If you have a high static charge and touch the chassis you may feel the ZAP [no damage though because the current flows through the chassis to ground]. </s>
<s> Discharge that same charge through the strap and you will feel nothing and not know that you had a charge. </s>
<s> I assume that you have felt ESD zaps during winter months getting into/out of cars or such. </s>
<s> During that season I hold a key in my hand to take the arc. </s>
<s> I hear it but don't feel it. </s>
<s> LOL </s>
