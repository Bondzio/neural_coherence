<s> What kind of hardware would best allow me to share my PC monitor (Sony SDM-HS73) with my XBOX? </s>
<s> I've heard TV tuner cards or special adapters (e.g. </s>
<s> StarTech COMP2VGA Game-Console-To-PC-Monitor Adapter) but would like specific feedback if possible. </s>
<s> I would prefer a solution that allows me to switch between both uses as easily as possible (i.e. </s>
<s> don't want to have to plug/unplug stuff all the time). </s>
<s> The main reason I ask is that I want to use XBOX live but my phone jacks are limited (2 in whole house, neither near our only TV where XBOX currently located). </s>
<s> I would LOVE to simply put my XBOX on my desk which is huge and share the DSL and HOPEFULLY the monitor too. </s>
<s> A KVM switch or a VGA switch are the best devices to share your monitor between the PC and Xbox. </s>
<s> You'll need the XBox VGA cable. </s>
<s> Here's an inexpensive KVM: http://www.buy.com/prod/Trendnet_TK_205K_2_Port_PS_2_KVM_Switch/q/loc/101/10352473.html and a VGA switch: http://www.buy.com/prod/Tripp_Lite_Monitor_Switch_2_port_s/q/loc/101/10259620.html The KVM switch should allow you to use your keyboard and mouse with the XBox also. </s>
<s> As for sharing the DSL line, you'll need a router such as this: http://www.buy.com/prod/D_Link_DI_604_4_Port_Cable_DSL_Router/q/loc/101/10326027.html It will connect to your DSL modem and your PC and XBox will connect to it. </s>
<s> ...that I have a Linksys WRT54GS router that should work fine for the DSL. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info and the links. </s>
<s> In the meantime I have also found a few reputably reliable VGA adapters which have a quick switch between PC and console. </s>
<s> I am optimistic one of these will work well - the picture quality on the VDigi is supposed to be excellent, as well as a couple of others. </s>
<s> If not, I will likely get a TV Tuner card... </s>
<s> ...unless you want to record your xbox (or use the tv capabilities). </s>
<s> the xbox VGA out is much sharper than TV out so go with the KVM/VGA switch if you're going to a LCD monitor. </s>
<s> Although recording some of my XBOX stuff would be hilarious, I don't really need that capability. </s>
<s> Thanks for the tip. </s>
<s> To display your x-box on your monitor your going to need a switch that converts rca signal to vga signal, key digital makes such an animal, http://www.keydigital.com/ProductDetail.aspx?categorycode=500&itemno=KDCTCA3&productname= , but it is pricey. </s>
<s> its called the clear video 3. </s>
<s> they're only $40 and specifically designed for connecting the XBox to a computer monitor. </s>
<s> does the x-box output in high def using this cable? </s>
<s> and where can i find one? </s>

<s> yes, for the xbox 360, not for the original x-box. </s>
