that's basically it, except since i was looking for boot display to monitor i had that hooked up to the onboard vga and a stick of memory in it.
i didn't get any beeps of any sort on the first motherboard.
of course i was hoping to get at least one, indicating all was well.
i didn't try the speaker yesterday on the other motherboard, but will, however i suspect i still won't get any beeps.
in fact i'll pull the known good speaker off one of my other systems to use instead, just to be sure.
i'd hate to think the vendor is swapping rma boards between those who sent them in, i'd hope that's not the case, but seems strange i would get two &quot;new&quot; boards that were doa.
this is unusual for me, not had two boards in a row of same make act doa.
