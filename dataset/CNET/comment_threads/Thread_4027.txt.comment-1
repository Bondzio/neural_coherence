Hi there, Please help install a new sound card.
I have a computer running xp(home) P4, To improve its performance I have changed its Power unit to 400W,and changed its video card to 256MHz .
Now I wish to install a sound card.
It has not got a sound card at the moment, I have bought an Audiophile 2496, M-Audio Card.
I have been advised to disable m/b sound capacity, (M/B is MATSONIC, MS9327E+(USB) Socket 478, sis 650GL Chipset Pentium 4.
It's sound on board is rather good but not good enough I wish to install the PCI card which I have bought.
How do I disable the on board sound capacity?
All help will be appreciated.
Shafiq
