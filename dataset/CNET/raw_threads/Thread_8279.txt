1628	0	10038	116112	NR	Coryphaeus	1/30/04 9:30 AM	1.075455E12	Processor speed. . .	My new system I built has a Shuttle AN35N Ultra 400 system board with an AMD 2400+ processor, 2 Gig speed. After getting it running I noticed in Device Manager the processor was shown as AMD 1800+ with a 1.4 Gig processor. After a phone call to the store where I bought it I changed the FSB from 100 MHz to 133 MHz, and the listing went to 2400+, speed 2.0 Gig. Now it's showing correctly, running like a top. Can overclocking be this simple? Change the FSB speed? Not that I want to experiment, but if the FSB speed is increased, will the processor speed increase? I do have more options. Thanks.

The AMD 2400+ should have been set to &quot;factory specs&quot; of Multiplier of 15, FSB 133 and voltage 1.65 in the first place though. With the 100 Mhz you were underclocking yours. http://www.computing.net/cpus/wwwboard/forum/8145.html Play around with it (if you fry it they are pretty cheap). Stability and longevity of components is a good reason to not OC but realistically you are likely not going to keep the same system long enough to allow that to make much difference. Had a Pentium Pro 200 that I ran at 266 for three years without problem and a Pentium Pro 166 that I clocked to 233 that gave up the ghost after about 4 months.

When I put it together I set the bus at 136 and it runs at 2045, at 137 it goes to 2061 and 138 it runs at 2076. If I go above 138 bus it is not stable.......need a bigger PS.
