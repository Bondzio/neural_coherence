Hi, i am in the same spot as the original thread starter.
Presently i am a student so have access to web and use a lot of comp related to internet usage.
But my work is on merchant ships, where i am away from net.
So succinctly i use the laptop for normal word processing etc, PLUS basic (Read basic) EDITING of pictures using picasa or may be photoshop ( btw does mac have any software like photoshop ?)
in distant future.
My question is: Should i be so much worried regarding the non use of ATI graphics card in macbook with core 2duo.
and can i just use openoffice and avoid buying ms office for mac since i can convert openoffice files into MS files just for printing purposes.
thks in advance for ur help brgds krish
