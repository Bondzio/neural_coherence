there are two forms of media which have stood the test of time.
stone and vellum.
the disadvantage of stone is that it is difficult to write to but once written to it tends to be permanent.
mean life, somewhere over 3000 years.
vellum is relatively easy to write to, is erasable and there are examples over 2000 years old.
i doubt that any modern media will be able to match these in storage life terms.
the only advantage of modern media is that it is relatively easy to write to, but this has an inherent problem, namely that any amount of rubbish can be written and stored in the short term.
it would be interesting to look over the shoulders of archaeologists a thousand years hence wondering why in the early twenty-first century, humans stopped writing..
