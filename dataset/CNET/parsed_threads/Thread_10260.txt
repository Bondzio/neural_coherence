<s> i recently went to plug in my speakers into the back of my computer but mistakenly tried to plug it into a usb port:S when i realised i unplugged it and a pop up on the monitor came up saying usb overload and everything froze, i then turned off my computer and the power lights on the tower were blinking, i then unplugged the power and plugged it back in and tried to turn the computer back on, but nothing would happen. </s>
<s> does anyone know what i can do to get my computer working again? </s>
<s> You said ''i then turned off my computer and the power lights on the tower were blinking, i then unplugged the power and plugged it back in and tried to turn the computer back on, but nothing would happen.'' </s>
<s> Not good, I saw this once. </s>
<s> I came home to a strange smell and found my computer power lights blinking and just like you I turned it off and it never came back. </s>
<s> Best bet, take it to computer repair place that will check it out for you and consult you before making any costly repairs. </s>
<s> I took mine to a local place with specific instruction to try only replacing the power supply, if that did not work stop all repairs and call me. </s>
<s> I was told it was trashed and that only the case was still good. </s>
<s> I paid a $34 bench fee and took my smelly dead computer home. </s>
<s> I fixed the PC anyway by replacing the HDD, motherboard, power supply, ram, and modem. </s>
<s> The only parts that made it were the case, video card, and sound card. </s>
<s> The parts alone to do this cost me about $400 and hours of work. </s>
<s> Right now you can buy a cheap PC for that. </s>
