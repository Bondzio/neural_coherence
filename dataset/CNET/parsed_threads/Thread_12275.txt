<s> I have a Motorola SURFBoard 6580 as my cable modem + router + 802.11n AP. </s>
<s> I wanted to add an AP on the second floor of the house for better signal. </s>
<s> I have read that APs from different manuafacturers are not necessarily compatible for seamless roaming. </s>
<s> I just want to see if anyone has experiences on it. </s>
<s> Well, I guess the worst case is to turn off wifi on the SURFBoard and get 2 identical APs, but that's not ideal. </s>
<s> Thanks for any suggestions. </s>
<s> Since I only see seamless roaming work in the labs you may my attention here. </s>
<s> Love to hear if you succeeded. </s>

<s> That is, while we can roam, any connection is lost as we move from one hotspot to another. </s>
<s> You are dealing with a MSFT OS so is this level of seamless acceptable? </s>
