<s> Hi I am trying to output to my TV using my laptop. </s>
<s> The problem is that I only have VGA out on my laptop. </s>
<s> I wanted a cheap solution so I tried using a VGA to SVIDEO cable using this cable on ebay. </s>
<s> http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=3759&item=5150804185&rd=1 I tried using the standard rca jack and also the svideo jack. </s>
<s> My laptop does not have many features in the &quot;display&quot; link in the control panel. </s>
<s> I use the fn + f4 to output to my monitor and have been trying to do it with the cable while it is attached to my TV. </s>
<s> However when I do it all that happens is the tv flashes in black and white for a bit and I can barely see the text for about 2 seconds, after that the tv goes blank and my laptop screen stays on. </s>
<s> I don't know what I am doing wrong any ideas? </s>
<s> I wanted a cheap solution I have tried doing it with the tv plugged in while booting up the pc as well as plugging it in after the computer has started no difference. </s>
<s> thing just doesn't look right to me. </s>
<s> Well I bought it a while ago but it was only 5 bucks </s>
<s> Be aware that trying to use a TV as a monitor with the configuration you have is almost always a complete disappointment. </s>
<s> TV's are very low resolution and only run 640x480 with an extremely grainy image. </s>
<s> Do not expect it to be usable for much even if you spend money getting it working. </s>
<s> Yeah I know.I have 2 other machines that I output to TV with using the svideo out. </s>
<s> I really like it for watching movies when travelling. </s>
<s> This is why I was hoping I could get the cable to work with the laptop with only VGA out..... </s>
<s> Anyway I was trying to avoid spending alot of money on one of those big vga converter boxes..... </s>
<s> The only to this is to get a extrnial vga to TV conviter they are small plug into the vga port and most give a composit and S-Video output. </s>
<s> They usualy cost around $70. </s>

<s> Just in case you're still interested / care, that cable you linked to on eBay i've seen before.. </s>
<s> They are supplied with the Matrox Dual Head cards which allow specific output to TV on the second VGA output. </s>
<s> Now, I'm guessing here, but I think what you're seeing with your laptop is the refresh sent to the telly is waay to high which is why it blinks a couple of times then throws it out. </s>
<s> So, basically you can't use it. </s>
<s> Unless you have a &quot;dual head&quot; laptop which allows you to specify a secondary monitor ? </s>
<s> -- XP allows this, but Win2K doesn't handle some laptops as well (my Tecra 9100 for instance). </s>
<s> So, if you're on XP, check Display settings to see if you can configure a &quot;secondary&quot; display for TV, otherwise its a big bulky VGA box.. HTH. </s>
