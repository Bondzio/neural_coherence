1.1.1	Hi : I have a Compaq Presario 5700T desktop computer , with 450MHz .	St
1.1.2	I would like to upgrade to a faster MHz .	St
1.1.3	Can I upgrade to at least a 550MHz ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.2.1	I do n't think they make 550 Mhz processors anymore .	St
1.2.2	If you 're planning to upgrade the CPU , you better upgrade the motherboard also .	St
1.3.1	Technology is moving so fast , upgrading just does n't worth the price anymore .	St
1.3.2	What kind of cpu and motherboard do you have ?	Ques
1.3.3	PII goes up to 450mhz , if you have that , then you 'll have to get a new PIII or P4 compatible motherboard .	St
1.3.4	Motherboard + cpu make up most of the cost in a computer anyway .	St
1.3.5	Just get a new machine , it would be easier , and probably even cheaper .	St
1.4.1	actually you can find Pentium III 's on ebay and pricegrabber for a good price if it 's a Slot 1 Pentium II box , you can run Slot I Pentium III 's in there ( if their sub 900MHZ ones , as Pentium II and Pentium III are VERY VERY close to each other in design ( less difference than Northwood to Prescott ) i would still agree with them on this though , just get a new machine	St
