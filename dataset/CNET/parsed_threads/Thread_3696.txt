<s> I have a wireless network set up through MR314 Netgear wireless router. </s>
<s> I have two laptops connected to the internet through wireless and have One desktop connected through the a wire from the router's ethernet port.From the desktop i am able to connect to the laptops and access all the shared folders on them but from the laptops i am not able to connect to the desktop. </s>
<s> I have disabled the firewall on the desktop still it is not working. </s>
<s> I have the workgroup name of my desktop same as that of the wireless ESSID name. </s>
<s> All my computers have Windows XP Operating system. </s>
<s> Any help or suggestions in resolving this issue would be greately appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks Nirmala </s>
<s> are excepted on the Exceptions tab of Windows Firewall of the unseen PC. </s>
<s> you mention: 'I have the workgroup name of my desktop same as that of the wireless ESSID name.' </s>
<s> ... your workgroup name is supposed to be the same name with your laptop workgroup name .. not with your ESSID(?) </s>
<s> Although you might give your ESSID name identical to your workgroup name. </s>
<s> The laptops are laptops from my work so they are part of the company's domains. </s>
<s> I can not change them to my desktop's workgroup. </s>
<s> I tried conencting one of my laptops through wired connection and tried to ping to it through the other laptop which is connected through wireless and i am able to connect to either of them without anyproblem. </s>
<s> Both the laptops were in different domains but still they were able to conenct to each other. </s>
<s> I have file and printer sharing enabled on my desktop. </s>
<s> I dont have any antivirus software on my machine. </s>
<s> Can this problem be because of some virus attack or something. </s>
<s> Thanks Nirmala </s>
<s> &quot;the company's domains. </s>
<s> I can not change them to my desktop's workgroup.&quot; Then it will never work proper. </s>
<s> It's not an attack, just a bad setup. </s>

<s> do you think this is a possible solution. </s>
<s> http://www.netswitcher.com/ </s>
<s> While netswitcher is nice, if they can't change it now (no admin access I bet) then netswitcher won't work. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Change your desktop domain name to match with your work laptop. </s>
<s> The two laptops i have are on different domains. </s>
<s> One is my husbands work laptop which has his company's domain and i have mine which has my company's domain name. </s>
<s> But they are able to connect to each other and i am able to access all the shared folders on my husband's laptop. </s>
<s> I tried renaming the workgroup of the desktop to one of the laptop's domain names but with no success. </s>
<s> The net switcher that you suggested looks more suitable for wireless networks than for desktop PCs. </s>
<s> Correct me if i am wrong. </s>
<s> Please let me know if anyone needs more info to solve my problem. </s>
<s> Thanks Nirmala </s>
