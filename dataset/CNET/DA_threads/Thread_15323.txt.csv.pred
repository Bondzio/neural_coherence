1.1.1	My motherboard died in my ( e machines T6420 ) 4 days out of the 1 year warranty , and my brother 's did the same in his T6420 just within the warranty .	St
1.1.2	1 .	St
1.1.3	Is there any way to find out if these boards are commonly defective , as 1 year seems ridiculous ?	Ques
1.1.4	2 .	St
1.1.5	Do I have any recourse ?	Ques
1.1.6	Who 's the right person to complain to besides the tech dept which diagnosed the problem ?	Ques
1.1.7	3 .	St
1.1.8	Any suggestions for a good quality upgrade motherboard if I 'm stuck with the repair ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thank you	St
1.2.1	I see them to be under 99 bucks ( most ) at newegg.com and geeks.com .	St
1.2.2	So while this failure may seem spooky at first I run into blown USB and keyboard ports during Winter ( north of the equator ) due to electro static discharges or other reasons .	St
1.2.3	One of the downsides of not maintaining your own machine will be paying about 300 or so for a repair .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	At a minimum , give eMachines a call .	St
1.3.2	Explain the problem and they may get you a new motherboard .	St
1.3.3	It 's worth a shot .	St
1.3.4	If you must replace the motherboard , you can get info on your current T6420 motherboard here : http : //www.emachine-upgraders.info/dir1/support/t_w_series_usa_motherboards.shtml	St
1.4.1	e-machines conveniently lists only a $ 20 tech support line , and after many e-mail correspondances with support , they still would not give out a ( customer service number ) .	St
1.4.2	So basically they just hope you 'll go away !	St
1.4.3	Unless any one has a better way to get their attention , it looks like I will have to get a motherboard .	St
1.4.4	Are their any brands which stand out over the rest , and would upgrading to a faster speed comb .	St
1.4.5	board be a difficult transition ?	Ques
1.5.1	FYI , my 13 month old e machine T6420 motherboard just died .	St
1.5.2	Also , FYI , my e machine notebook died last year after being only 18 months old .	St
1.5.3	I do n't think it would be smart to buy another e machine ... .nor to repair an existing e machine .	St
1.5.4	Since 1985 I 've had desktops and notebooks from Toshiba , Compaq , HP , e Machine , IBM , Sony , etc ... and has always been the cheapest price but has always died on me .	St
1.5.5	All the other computers just got obsolete .	St
1.6.1	Motherboard in my *14* month-old eMachine t6420 just died .	St
1.6.2	Wish I 'd seen these posts last year when I was considering which box to buy .	St
1.6.3	.	St
1.6.4	.	St
1.6.5	All my research indicated eMachines were pretty big bang for the buck .	St
1.6.6	.	St
1.6.7	.	St
1.6.8	guess you get what you pay for .	St
1.7.1	I have an eMachine T6412 and the motherboard died 1 day before the end of the warranty , we took it to Best Buy who sent it to eMachines and they gladly replaced it .	St
1.8.1	Thanks for all your responses .	St
1.8.2	I had the computer repaired finally this week , no thanks to e machines .	Polite
1.8.3	The place that repaired it contacted e machines and after talking with several people and calling different numbers to get a replacement board , the representative said if I had contacted them within a week or two after the warranty and asked for a supervisor they would have repaired it under warranty .	St
1.8.4	What a crock !	St
1.8.5	I repeatedly asked for a supervisor during several online chat sessions with their technicians and they never once connected me with a supervisor , nor would they give me a number to call to speak with a representative .	St
1.8.6	I saved all those frustrating e-mails .	St
1.8.7	It appears many users had the same problem and guess what , that motherboard is not available .	St
1.8.8	My next computer will not be an e machines/gateway .	St
1.8.9	Brad	St
1.9.1	Dear friend , I operate a computer consulting and repair business in Michigan .	St
1.9.2	I have only ever had to replace motherboards ( this entire year ) in the very same brand and model of computer you made reference to .	St
1.9.3	I 've spoken with other repair personnel in this area and we 've discovered it to be the e-machine case that causes the motherboardss to fail .	St
1.9.4	There was one customer who 'd replaced his motherboard twice before finally replacing EVERYTHING except the case .	St
1.9.5	On his third go-round , his motherboard again shorted and failed after a while .	St
1.9.6	As near as we can tell ... the stamped hold-down holes in the e-machine case have a larger surface area than your conventional hexagonal screwin hold-downs , which we feel is the primary culprit of the unprecedented e-machine failure rate .	St
1.10.1	I to , have a T6420 which lasted a whole 18 months before its untimely demise .	St
1.10.2	Such a long life .	St
1.10.3	Called E-Machines at there non toll free number ( 408-273-0888 ) , thank God for nationwide cell plans , and vented on them .	St
1.10.4	Did no good of course , but I feel a little better .	Polite
1.10.5	I guess I 'm going to strip the E-Machine of all the drives , most of which were upgrades I installed , and buy a new quality case , motherboard , and CPU and install my drives and boards in it .	St
1.10.6	One things sure , I 'll never go near a E-Machine or Gateway again .	St
1.11.1	I also want to add that TWO ( 2 ) eMachine Model T6420 computers purchased just over one year ago have also failed for myself and my mother .	St
1.11.2	Problem appeared to be bad power supplies at first , replaced and appeared to fix the problem , but then the video output went out on one followed by non-booting .	St
1.11.3	Second computer also failed without being able to power up the system , PSU replacement did not correct the problem .	St
1.11.4	The co-incident that both computers failed within the sametime frame ( and just out of warrenty ) leads me to believe that Gateway/eMachines have sold DEFECTIVE products .	St
1.11.5	I am bringing this to the attention of an attorney and will inquire as to whether this should provide grounds for a CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT against these people .	St
1.11.6	Anyone else interested if we move forward with such a lawsuit ? ?	Ques
1.11.7	?	Ques
1.12.1	I also have an emachine t6420 that died just shy of two years .	St
1.12.2	Very frustrating .	St
1.12.3	I contacted Gateway and the tech agreed that emachines is not a good product and they are replacing them .	St
1.12.4	It sounds as if emachines was selling defective computers .	St
1.12.5	Let me know if this turns into a class action suit .	St
1.12.6	Thanks .	Polite
1.13.1	I 've had my T6420 about 2 years now , only problem I 've had was to replace the hard drive about 3 months ago .	St
1.13.2	Not happy about that !	St
1.13.3	Would love to know about any lawsuits .	St
1.14.1	I have had my Emachines T6420 for almost exectly 24 months .	St
1.14.2	Motherboard is having problems .	St
1.14.3	I ca n't restart and USB mouse drops out all the time .	St
1.14.4	Also video jumping around .	St
1.14.5	A friend of mine who owns a computer support business did a remote on my machine and thinks a bad capacitor on the motherboard is the culprit .	St
1.14.6	He says this is common in Emachines and Dell Optiplex .	St
1.14.7	Emachines support is completely useless .	St
1.14.8	What a bunch of total idiodts .	St
1.14.9	Their answer to everything is to do a full system restore .	St
1.14.10	I have no doubt they knew of MS-7207 Motherboard problems long ago and continued to sell these crappo units .	St
1.14.11	Anyway , here is my question .	St
1.14.12	I am going to replace my MS-7207 motherboard but I have noticed that it comes in two versions .	St
1.14.13	One with the Nvidea GeForce 6100 chipset and the other version with the Nvidea GeForce 6150 chipset .	St
1.14.14	Does anyone know if the 6150 chipset motherboard is compatible in the T6420 ?	Ques
1.14.15	In other words would it operate on the same drivers and Bios and would I be able to use the same restore disk ?	Ques
1.14.16	If yes then I intend to get this board instead of the original because it offers DVI out connections for monitor .	Res
1.14.17	Thanks , Strat100	St
1.15.1	The XP OS will want to re-activate and wo n't since it 's another motherboard .	St
1.15.2	You learn this after a few forays into the swamp .	St
1.15.3	Bob	St
1.16.1	Can you ellaborate ?	Ques
1.16.2	Are you saying that I have no options here .	St
1.16.3	That even replacing the motherboard wo n't help me because the the restore disk wo n't work on a new motherboard ?	Ques
1.16.4	I 'm lost on that one .	St
1.16.5	I thought I would be ok If I just took the old processor and memory off of my old motherboard and put it on a new motherboard ?	Ques
1.16.6	My computer is working right now it just has problems and I want to replace the motherboard .	St
1.16.7	I would like to use the 6150 chipset but it 's not crucial .	St
1.16.8	I have no problem using the stock motherboard that came in it .	St
1.16.9	Sounds as if you have fallen into this swamp yourself ?	Ques
1.16.10	Strat100	St
1.17.1	How Windows detects changes in the hardware .	St
1.17.2	Also the supplied OS is often locked to the system as supplied .	St
1.17.3	I only note this so you wo n't be totally surprised about not only having to install a few drivers but having to get a XP license as well .	St
1.17.4	Bob	St
1.18.1	I see what you are saying now .	St
1.18.2	Emachines is really a racket .	St
1.18.3	I will never buy another thats for sure .	St
1.18.4	They are the worst company I have ever dealt with .	St
1.18.5	What cheap crap they sell .	St
1.18.6	Anyway , there is no way I am going to pay them $ 160.00 for a motherboard and then still have to jump through hoops to get it all to work .	St
1.18.7	My plan at this point is to scrap everything but the case , hard drive , and media reader .	St
1.18.8	I think I will find a deal on a Motherboard/CPU bundle , power supply , and a new Liscensed XP .	St
1.18.9	I do n't know what other choice I really have right now .	St
1.18.10	I undestand the tower case is pretty generic and should fit most components .	St
1.18.11	Is this your understanding as well ?	Ques
1.18.12	Thanks , Strat100	St
1.19.1	That is , their written agreement that I will be avoiding the 99 to 199 dollar price tag and bill for Windows ... - & gt ; Emachines has no corner on the market on this issue .	St
1.19.2	Just about every retail machine will not run the supplied windows if you change the motherboard .	St
1.19.3	Look up HP and the word & quot ; TATTOO my motherboard. & quot ; Bob	St
1.20.1	I 've replaced motherboards numerous times on e-Machines , sometimes with the same make and model , other times with newer or different models .	St
1.20.2	Though I do n't use a & quot ; restore disk & quot ; per say , I 've never had any problems reloading Windows XP and using the existing license key that is affixed to the side of the e-Machine .	St
1.20.3	At the time you need to & quot ; Activate & quot ; your Operating System , you will notice an option to change the key .	St
1.20.4	If you choose that option , you can enter your actual key and click generate ID .	St
1.20.5	With this new ID , you 'll be able to authenticate with Windows .	St
1.20.6	If not , call them , it takes about 6 minutes , they do n't give you ANY problems and you 'll be activated before you hang up .	St
1.21.1	My emachine died on Friday .	St
1.21.2	Came home and tried to power it up and got nothing .	St
1.21.3	At first I thought it may be the HD , but soon discovered it was n't .	St
1.21.4	I can at least get all my data off the HD before I wipe it completely .	St
1.21.5	I rebuild computers a lot and I 've never had an issue with activating an OS .	St
1.21.6	It 's all automated , unless something goes haywire on their end .	St
1.21.7	Then , you just read the numbers and they repeat a different set back , you enter them and your done .	St
1.22.1	I replaced my motherboard last week on my Emachines T6420 .	St
1.22.2	Replaced it with a Biostar GeForce 6100-M9 .	St
1.22.3	Boot up went smoothly .	St
1.22.4	For revalidation for Windows XP I ended up having to call Windows but once I did It went smoothly and had no problems .	St
1.22.5	So far motherboard is operating just fine and I did n't lose any previous info or have to do a restore or anything .	St
1.22.6	I am having one small problem though .	St
1.22.7	My CPU fan and System ( case ) fan are running fast all the time .	St
1.22.8	My CPU temperature seems ok and is normally running at a bout 24 degrees celsius and under gaming conditions at about 34 C so it does not seem to be a heat problem .	St
1.22.9	I did add a little heat sink compund back to the top of the cpu where it meets the heat sink when I did the install so i know it is transfering heat ok .	St
1.22.10	This seems to be more a problem with the fans not beiung sensed .	St
1.22.11	I have checked my bios and have everything set correctly there .	St
1.22.12	Have cool-n-quiet set to auto and my power options in windows set to minimum power management .	St
1.22.13	Not sure what the problem is but it is annoying with the fans running fast all the time .	St
1.22.14	Loud .	St
1.22.15	Anyone else encountered this problem ?	Ques
1.22.16	Strat 100	St
1.23.1	I purchased an Emachine T3092 from Circuit City in Paducah Kentucky .	St
1.23.2	The capacitors on the motherboard have leaked battery acid which has eaten the traces and done other damage to materials inside of the case .	St
1.23.3	If you are having any trouble with Emachine and would like to have all of your money refunded to you by means of a Class-Action lawsuit ( nothing is necessary on your behalf unless otherwise specified ) please email me at polachelliot @ aol.com Thank you for your time Elliot Polach	St
1.24.1	I bought this machine in march 2006.. it is now in the shop for the 3rd time.. 2 times to replace the motherboard.. ( these two times were within about 4 months time ... this time they say is most likely the motherboard but I have n't gotten it back so not sure what will be done .	St
1.24.2	email me at yorkiepaws @ msn.com if I can be included in a class action suit.. thanks , Elizabeth	St
1.25.1	I was wondering if this class-action lawsuit was still coming up or if it had already been settled .	St
1.25.2	I bought my eMachine T6420 in Dec. 07 for around $ 700 or so if i remember correctly and had to replace the motherboard in Jan. 08 for another $ 160 .	St
1.25.3	Just recently i tried to upgrade the video card so i bought a PCIexpress card , but the motherboard does n't seem to see it there .	St
1.25.4	The one time that it did see it , the computer froze during the Windows loading screen .	St
1.25.5	I am definately down for getting my money back for a machine that has seemed to cause problems for just about everyone who has owned one .	St
1.25.6	Please let me know what is/has happened with this lawsuit .	Sug
1.25.7	Thank you Jon plouffy_69_01 @ yahoo.com	St
