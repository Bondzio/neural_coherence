<s> I have a hauppauge tv card in my pc, and I have cable connected to it. </s>
<s> The thing is, it only goes up to channel 70. </s>
<s> I want to be able to watch the higher premium channels on my pc without renting a digital box from my cable company (like what I have to do with my regular tv) Do they make a tv card that takes the place of a cable box? </s>
<s> contacted your cable company? </s>
