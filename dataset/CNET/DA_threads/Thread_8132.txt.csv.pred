1.1.1	This is more of an annoyance rather than a problem .	St
1.1.2	Just recently when I start up XP Windows checks the FAT32 on my External Drive for & quot ; consistency & quot ; as it puts it .	St
1.1.3	I did it once , which took nearly 2-3 hours and it deleted some of my MP3 collection due to bad clusters or something to that effect .	St
1.1.4	Well , since then Windows still wants to keep checking the FAT32 on my external drive .	St
1.1.5	I can skip this process , which I do , but I just would like to know why Windows keeps on doing this .	St
1.1.6	I of course can simply turn my hard drive , but I usually keep it on 24/7 .	St
1.1.7	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	That 's my fix .	St
1.3.1	While you 're at it ... turn it off when not in use .	St
1.3.2	Leaving it on 24-7 is sure way to bring on early and untimely demise .	St
1.3.3	Last ... .convert it to NTFS .	St
1.3.4	VAPCMD	St
