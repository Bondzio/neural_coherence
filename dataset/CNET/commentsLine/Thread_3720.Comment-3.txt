the latitude is a laptop, it shipped with this issue, so static is out.
but yes, i own an antistatic mat and wrist strap and utilize both when working with internal components (i've been called paranoid).
and i did not remove the drive &quot;in the first place&quot;, i did it in response to this problem.
thanks!
