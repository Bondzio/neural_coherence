I just bought this great tablet a couple weeks ago.
I was just getting everything set up, apps, games, news, shopping, etc... and while I was playing solitare I picked up the nook in my hand and it was real hot on the back panel,,, seconds later it shut itself off and it aint starting anymore, is it toast ?
I hope this is covered by warranty,,,,, any opinions ?
