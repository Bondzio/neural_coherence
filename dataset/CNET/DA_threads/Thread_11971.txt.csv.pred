1.1.1	Hey , well we just had our internet upgraded today and I am also trying to simplify the wiring .	St
1.1.2	Right now it is connected like this : http : //i72.photobucket.com/albums/i162/hawkeye_042/router1.jpg .	St
1.1.3	To make it less confusing I would like to configure the second router as an access point and have everything else directly to the modem/router like this : http : //i72.photobucket.com/albums/i162/hawkeye_042/router2.jpg .	St
1.1.4	I plugged my computer to the modem/router and it wo n't recieve the correct ip address info .	St
1.1.5	I know what the router IP is and the DHCP is turned on .	St
1.1.6	When we plugged in the second router we set the connection to & quot ; dynamic & quot ; and it got the IP information just fine .	St
1.1.7	When I plug my computer in it only recieves an IP and Subnet Mask which are both incorrect .	St
1.1.8	For an ip it lists 169.254.25.224 and subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 .	St
1.1.9	It should have been 192.168.50.101 and 255.255.255.0 .	St
1.1.10	It also says computer has limited or no connectivity .	St
1.1.11	-Appreciate any help !	St
1.2.1	something does n't look right or sound right in your drawing and explanation .	St
1.2.2	I 'm presuming you want the modem/router to be the IP address server .	St
1.2.3	As such , your laptops need to get through the AP with their request for an address .	St
1.2.4	It would seem to me that your AP ... which you said is actually a router configured as one ... should have the IP address server feature turned off .	St
1.2.5	My first thought is , because you have just a few devices to deal with , assign static address across the board and plug in your modem/router address as the gateway on all connected devices .	St
1.2.6	If any device you have needs DHCP , you should be able to define a range of address it can give out and keep the rest as static .	St
1.2.7	Personally , I 've always had better luck using static addressing .	St
