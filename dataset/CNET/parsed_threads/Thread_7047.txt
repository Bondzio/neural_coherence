<s> I'm not sure what to do at this point. </s>
<s> I've installed my CPU but not the heatsink. </s>
<s> The heatsink has a gray pad which I think is the thermal paste. </s>
<s> The thing is I want to use Artic Silver for my thermal paste. </s>
<s> What should I do? </s>
<s> Should I leave the thermal pad on the heatsink and apply Artic silver on the CPU and on top of the thermal pad on the heatsink -or- should I remove the thermal pad on the heatsink and smudge some Artic Silver on it and the CPU? </s>
<s> I'm not sure if it's of any benefit but it's a Pentium D 830 processor. </s>
<s> Also, can anyone tell me if a thicker layer of Artic Silver will give me better heat dissipation on my CPU? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> and then use the arctic silver paste </s>
<s> ARtric Silver people already got this covered. </s>
<s> Check this link: http://www.arcticsilver.com/arctic_alumina_instructions.htm Of course remove the pad as best as you can, use alcohol with cloth with a little elbow power. </s>
<s> You only need a little dab of AS when applied. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> ABSOLUTELY not. </s>
<s> It will then become reduce its effectiveness. </s>
<s> The layer should be very thin, its sole purpose is to fill in the microscopic voids caused because the two surfaces are not perfectly flat. </s>
<s> The thermal pad, is called a phase change device, looks thick, but melts when the system is turned on and the CPU heats it up, creating a thin layer. </s>
<s> Thanks for the speedy feedback. </s>
<s> You've all been a great help, thanks again. </s>
<s> Arctic's cleaning and purifying kit...two squeeze bottles, one is a cleaner/compound remover. </s>
<s> The other is a surface purifier. </s>
