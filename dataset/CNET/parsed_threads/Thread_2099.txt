<s> I have a basic question. </s>
<s> My Dell 580 has an integrated NIC card. </s>
<s> Does this give me the capability to acces the web or do I still need a wireless card? </s>
<s> Did you connect to your network or LAN with the usual Ethernet cable? </s>
<s> I have Comcast &quot;triple play&quot; using an Arris cable router/modem. </s>
<s> The Arris is connected by a &quot;plug link&quot; to an electrical socket. </s>
<s> Two computers connect to the LAN via plug links. </s>
<s> My main computer is separated from the Arris by about 75 feet with a lot of walls in between resulting in a very erratic internet connection. </s>
<s> I just purchased a Netgear range extender with the thought that I would connect wirelessly (like my laptops) from the Arris. </s>
<s> This is why I'm asking if the NIC is wireless capable. </s>
<s> This question is really academic because the range extender doesn't seem to extend range. </s>
<s> I used my laptop to test the signal and, of course, it connects easily within 30-50 feet of the Arris. </s>
<s> However the laptop doesn't appear to be getting any signal from the range extender as the signal degrades immediatly adjacent to the extender. </s>
<s> My thoughts now are to purchase a second cable modem and place it close to the main computer and connect it by ethernet. </s>
<s> I don't know if this will work with two modems working off the same Comcast cable signal. </s>
<s> I am not a &quot;techy&quot; so would appreciate any thoughts. </s>
<s> My Arris is not a router. </s>
<s> If I connected one machine, the other would not work. </s>
<s> So far, a NIC is not wireless. </s>
<s> I can however use a NIC to connect wirelessly if I use an ethernet cable to what might be called a BRIDGE. </s>
<s> Sorry but it looks like you are asking me to give a course in networking. </s>
<s> That I will have to decline but will answer the stumpers. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
