1.1.1	I 've been reading up about external hard drives since I plan on purchasing one for my laptop .	St
1.1.2	But for every good drive I hear about , there are 3 bad reviews of it .	St
1.1.3	It also seems that reviewers like Cnet give a good review , while the user reviews are completely different ( poor ) .	St
1.1.4	Basically , which drive would you guys recommend as a reliable drive .	St
1.1.5	P.S .	St
1.1.6	I 'm looking for a 250GB drive .	St
1.1.7	Thanks , Duckhunter	St
1.2.1	For me , I just buy an external USB case and then a drive to put in it .	St
1.2.2	I 'm unsure what I 'm missing by paying for them to put the two parts together .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I hear some of the USB cases have heating issues .	St
1.3.2	Has this ever been a problem for you ?	Ques
1.4.1	I have n't seen this issue .	St
1.4.2	The larger case I use is for a 5.25 drive ( can house CD/DVD/RW drives ) and has a fan .	St
1.4.3	The smaller unit has slabs of aluminum that do get warm but nothing moreso that a drive in a desktop .	St
1.4.4	My answer is ... no .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thank you for your help .	St
1.5.2	I 'll look into getting a case and drive separatley .	St
1.6.1	I use a 60GB drive in a Belkin enclosure .	St
1.6.2	It has a fan and heat has never been an issue .	St
1.6.3	I like Seagate drives the best and find their recent switch to a 5 year warranty a good sign .	St
1.6.4	Recently Amazon had a 160GB Seagate external drive for $ 119.00 after rebate .	St
1.6.5	The drive stood upright taking far less desk space than my current drive .	St
1.6.6	I plan to watch for this offer and use it next time I see it .	St
1.6.7	Every Seagate drive I buy has a $ 50 rebate and they process and get you your money in a timely manner every time .	St
1.6.8	I have three seagate drives on the shelf .	St
1.6.9	They will provide additional space or replacements in our five desktops .	St
1.7.1	Hi Duckhunter , I ca n't tell you which external hard drive to buy , but I have a different caution .	St
1.7.2	If you are buying a USB 2 drive , make sure your computer has USB 2 ports .	St
1.7.3	If it does n't you can add a PCI card with USB ports for a modest price , but then you have the issue of whether your OS can see a USB 2 device .	St
1.7.4	If it can , the third caustion applies only if you like to make images of partitions or drives from DOS .	St
1.7.5	Some imaging programs ( Acronis True Image , Norton Ghost ) can see a USB 2 drive while operating in DOS , but some others ca n't .	St
1.7.6	Good luck , Dan S	Polite
1.8.1	Thanks for the advice .	St
1.8.2	My computer has USB 2.0 ports so that is not a problem .	St
1.8.3	I plan on using the drive as drag and drop drive , but thanks for the warning about using imaging programs .	St
1.9.1	If you read this today 11-27 is still possible to order Norton Systemworks 2005 Premier for free after rebates .	St
1.9.2	( although at the moment they have the wrong rebate form posted ) .	St
1.9.3	In Includes Norton Ghost .	St
1.9.4	Norton acquired the Drive Image product , so it should be a good program which can backup under Windows .	St
1.9.5	The One Touch drives are very quiet .	St
1.9.6	Hopefully the new ver .	St
1.9.7	II drives are faster .	St
1.9.8	LaCie drives sound very good .	St
1.9.9	They apparently have no fans .	St
1.9.10	Tigerdirect has a very inxpensive enclosure .	St
1.9.11	Microcenter was selling Maxtor 250 GB for $ 119 .	St
