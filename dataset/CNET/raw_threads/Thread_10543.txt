I just purchased an 80gig/ Seagate7200.7 Barracuda ultraATA, shunted for cable select out of box. My dell 8200 already has a master 40 gig HD most likely Cable select setting and the 80 gig new, was recommended by Dell as replacement. I want to install the 80gig HD new as a slave. My two questions are: Can I do this as simply as installing hardware and turning on the comp? Would it be better to make the old 40gig HD, the slave? ARe slave drives slower to access or something? Both internal drives also and I have the right mountings and plugs, for two inside.

Simple stuff since the drive is empty. The speed of the drives won't be a factor just because one is larger than the other so I would recommend leaving the 40GB drive as the Master with the new drive as the Slave rather than trying to copy one drive to the other and then have to switch the positioning. The instructions here are for W98/ME using FAT32 and if that's what you have on the Master 40GB drive, you will have to partition and format the drive separately as seen in the pictures in the link. This will prepare the drive for data. If you have XP, it will partition and format it for you by using the Disk Management program. http://www.pcwarfare.com/hdds/fdisk-format.slave.hdd.htm TONI

The other drive, if jumpered as Master could be plugged into the middle cable for convenience. never know with these proprietary systems. Also, why would using Win 98 have any effect on whether or not to use cable select????

WinXP/SP2 When I bought my Dell8200, I also purchased the work station mobo, I think it is supposed to have lots of room. I know nothing about MoBo's, but it has 6 AGP's and 4 PCI's? I think anyways.

I do very graphic intensive work and may need to make my new drive the master, which would change everything. Mainly that is what I am trying to really find out: If I make my new drive the slave, then install adobe illustrator to it; will all files for Illustrator install to the slave, even the sys files? This is important; that my CGI work and apps, stay on one drive, the new drive.

And there is no sign this will ever change. You can keep your data files where you want, but few applications will run from your drive as you change the host or what master drive you move to. Bob

The only thing that matters is which drive your OS is installed on. System files for programs will always run from that drive no matter wether it's master or slave, so it doesn't matter.

I Am sure of my decision now: Installing new drive as master and fresh OS install. That's the way I'll feel most comfy. I can copy all my graphics to CD and erase the old drive. My art is the only important thing.

Note: .... before you start .... Pull the power cord out...its a must as the motherboard still has power to it even when shut off!!!!! Next; ground yourself and the computer case to ground to avoid electrostatic discharge, before touching any internal components try to keep contact to the metal chassic to equilize your body potential which can rise to 2500 volts or more just by body movements I,ve measured them, leather soled shoes would be better but constant chassic contact is best....... Installed harddrive; change the jumper to master or leave, if installing new HD on the secondary channel New harddrive; strap as a slave or install on the secondary channel as master or cable select Bios recognition may be automatic but if its not you may have to go into setup, I believe f2 at boot. Now just install on the cables.... Note: the cable has a polarity ie. there is a pin 1 and an end pin .. you have to put pin 1 to pin 1, the power cable connector has a specific shape. look befor you jump ok... Now use partition magic or another partitioning tool to set partitions on the drives you have.... why? well if your operating system is on one partition when you encounter a operating system failure via a virus or inadvertant driver loss then rebuilding wont mean the loss of all of you computer data ... eg. partitions examples Apps, Data, Downloads, Temporary, Video, Music anything you want ..... think of it as a large file cabinet with specific drawers .... old addage &quot;don't put all your eggs in 1 basket&quot; if it drops what happens.... Hope Thats of some help have fun

It also helps; to have security updates from Microsoft, on a CD via snail mail. You can get SP2 this way, for free, no postage. I also took the opportunity to; dust out the works and removed the cooling fan, cleaned it and re-installed. Only a slight increase in performance. I expected this however, Since my files were well managed on the old HD and I already had near peak performance with it.-----My thanks, go out to the above folks, for all the help and suggestions. Cnet Rules!!!

There are also X4 and X8, but usually only seen in servers. Some mobos have both an AGP slot and a PCI 16X slot. Just trying to point out that simply saying PCI Express may not be a complete statement.
