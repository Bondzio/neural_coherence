1.1.1	A while back I purchased 2 USBs , one after the other , on ebay .	St
1.1.2	They are 4gb capacity and they function well .	St
1.1.3	( although they do not show up on OS X ) They show up all the time on OS 9.2.2 .	St
1.1.4	I am booting directly into 9.2.2 , not using Classic/TruBlueEnvironment .	St
1.1.5	Two months ago I purchased the same type of USB drive from the same seller .	St
1.1.6	It started to eat all of my files .	St
1.1.7	Some of them had an altered file name .	St
1.1.8	OS 9.2.2 loads it all the time , but it says & quot ; There is a problem with the disk ... & quot ; and that message keeps coming up .	St
1.1.9	Beep .	St
1.1.10	Click .	St
1.1.11	Beep .	St
1.1.12	Click .	St
1.1.13	Beep .	St
1.1.14	Click .	St
1.1.15	Beep .	St
1.1.16	I successfully formatted it ... and it still ate my files .	St
1.1.17	I decided to switch sellers because they have 16gb USB drives .	St
1.1.18	I bought one last month .	St
1.1.19	It arrived today .	St
1.1.20	And it too came from China ? !	Ques
1.1.21	Also it is a very mild day today , so I do n't think it is heat damaged ... but the same error message comes up & quot ; There is a problem with the disk. & quot ; I also clicked on & quot ; Erase Disk & quot ; to erase the empty disk .	St
1.1.22	It initialized as FAT .	St
1.1.23	But it took forever , appeared to do nothing , and I got bored with it .	St
1.1.24	I have found a google search called & quot ; Fake USB Drive & quot ; .	St
1.1.25	Fake USBs everywhere .	St
1.1.26	That is surprising .	St
1.1.27	I am not sure what computers they use in China where these USB drives might be compatible with , but these USB drives are not compatible here .	St
1.1.28	If it is not recommended to get them on ebay , then where can I buy them ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.29	Wal*Mart ? ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.30	Also What Brand ? ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.31	EDGE ?	Ques
1.1.32	SanDisk ?	Ques
1.2.1	It does n't surprise me that some items from eBay are hosed or less than expected .	St
1.2.2	It has become the dumping ground not only for possible bad parts but any real cheap ones as well , even if they are n't they do n't work for long .	St
1.2.3	One reason I hesitate to buy from eBay unless I deal with a trusted vendor .	St
1.2.4	Also , some brand names come and go with the source being probably the same Pacific Rim manufacturer .	St
1.2.5	If you really want to trust your data to a flash drive then buy from a reliable source .	St
1.2.6	Also , if you check the forum here , notice that flash drives are n't permanent storage and should be thought of as a working storage media .	St
1.2.7	If you can return those flash drives back to the eBay vendor .	St
1.2.8	Yeah , Wal-Mart and other vendors you know will do better even if you have to wait for a sale , jump on one .	St
1.2.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	trusted vendors , do check the packaging ( such as spellings , model type - some brand like Sony do n't even manufacture certain series , but counterfeit ones were found floating around ) as they may also be duped by such unethical overseas salespeople due to oversight or some other reasons .	St
1.4.1	Try getting your drives at SuperMediaStore.com Very reasonable and good service .	St
1.4.2	Get on their e-mail list for specials , which come out frequently .	St
1.4.3	I 've been pleased with them .	St
1.5.1	Winifred , you asked that your post be removed because you had recommended a particular vendor .	St
1.5.2	I see no problem with that in this case because the original poster asked where he might purchase such items from .	St
1.5.3	You were simply offering an alternative .	St
1.5.4	So , no reason to delete your post .	St
1.5.5	Mark	St
