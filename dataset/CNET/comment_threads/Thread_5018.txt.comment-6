Hi Bob, Thanks again for your message.
Indeed, there was a INCD issue, but even if there is a CD/DVD, it does that, but I finnaly found out from where the problem came.
Some program changed the the rights for the devices.
I just gave the rights back and it works!!
Thanks soo much for your help.
Have a good one Rapheek
