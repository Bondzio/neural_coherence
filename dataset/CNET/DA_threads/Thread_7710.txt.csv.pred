1.1.1	Hi All , this I my first post as I have only just joined .	St
1.1.2	I am currently studying for my network plus and am just starting to get to grips with subnetting .	St
1.1.3	I have been practising using Class C addresses and thought all was going well until I tried with Class A and Class B .	St
1.1.4	The problem I have ( and I am sure it is pretty basic , but I am struggling a little ) is once an octet gets to 255 is the next step 1 or 0 and how does it effect the previous octet ?	Ques
1.1.5	For example If I have a class B IP address of 172.24.140.254 , how would this increment one step at a time ?	Ques
1.1.6	Would the next step be 172.24.140.255 , or 172.24.141.0 or 172.24.141.1 .	St
1.1.7	I am guessing the three of those suggestions are incorrect .	St
1.1.8	If somebody could give me the next three or four steps from 172.24.140.254 it would clear it up for me .	Sug
1.1.9	Thanks in advance , and sorry if it is a basic question .	St

1.2.1	So you get on the internet or read the books .	St
1.2.2	You might want to try some IP calculator too .	Sug
1.2.3	This question is quite old so I 'm sure it has plenty of prior discussions .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	For the reply	St
