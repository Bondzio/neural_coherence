i'm thinking of creating a home network but the more i read the more confused i'm getting.
first, we have four wireless phones operating at 2.4ghz.
does this rule out creating a 802.11b or 802.11g based network due to interference?
second, are there operating system constraints?
i have a pc running on windows me, a laptop running windows 98 and another pc running windows 95. i'm not thrilled with the prospect of upgrading to xp (even though i hate me).
can i find networking equipment compatible with win95?
lastly, the amount of hardware i need is probably the thing i'm most confused with.
my me machine is connect to the internet via cable modem.
so, i need a router, yes?
network interface cards in each computer?
do i need an access point?
is anyone familiar with powerline networks?
what's needed with them?
thanks.
