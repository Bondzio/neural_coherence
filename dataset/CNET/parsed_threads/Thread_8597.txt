<s> Hi, I have just bought a new Asus A8N-SLI motherboard. </s>
<s> I plan to buy a SATA hard drive to install along with it in the case (It will be the only hard drive in the PC). </s>
<s> Do I have to have the drive in a RAID? </s>
<s> Or can I just have it as the primary drive? </s>
<s> (I realize there is no secondary drive with a SATA cable). </s>
<s> Also, will I be prompted by Windows XP install to install the drivers for the SATA drive (F6?)? </s>
<s> Or will Windows XP automatically &quot;see&quot; the drive and start installing to the drive? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help you can provide. </s>
<s> Since your just doing the one drive, you don't need to worry about anything RAID. </s>
<s> Raid is for mid-level workstations and servers. </s>
<s> Also, since it's just SATA on the MoBo you will not need to load any other drivers during install... Good luck! </s>
<s> NIL </s>
