i have a pentium 4 ht 2.80ghz lga775 (pretty much a brand new cpu) socket, with a pci-e card.
(nvidia 9400gt) and i need a new motherboard.
i don't want to have to buy all new parts.
here is the motherboard in question:  and i have g.skill ddr2 pc2-4200 i was wondering if my ram will work with the motherboard in the link?
it seems to be the best board in question for it's price.
thanks!
