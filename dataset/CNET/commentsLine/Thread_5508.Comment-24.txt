i had a wd drive that was both usb and a nas device.
i started having a few problems with it corrupting files, then i noticed it was getting hot so put a number of old heat sinks on it which helped a bit but eventually it died.
have you tried removing the drive and sticking it in another external drive enclosure?
it would prove whether it's the drive of the enclosure, if it is the later, problem solved.
i've bought them for around 10 that are both sata and pata.
