<s> I travel a lot and am looking for a fast portable wireless printer for text, not photos. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any suggestions of a reliable and efficient printer that fits that bill and one that has very good print quality? </s>
<s> thanks, </s>
<s> HP makes a couple but the one that seems to work quite well and is a bit smaller plus has bluetooth capability is the Canon 100 series. </s>
