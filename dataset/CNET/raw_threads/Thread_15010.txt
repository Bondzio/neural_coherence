It came with Vista, I had it downgraded to XP Home Edition Service Pack 3 by someone who does this sort of thing. All drivers installed with no problem, it work(ed) great. The laptop was not able to connect to the new wireless router (Lynksys WRT160N) I had set up on my desktop. While on the 24 hr chat with a Lynksys rep, she had me walk through some steps that determined my settings were right. All seemed right, still no internet. I was able to take it with me on vacation a week ago, and was able to access an unsecured wirless network located somewhere in my parent's condo building. On the way home I noticed I could not access airport wireless networks anymore. I kept getting a message on the wireless icon that said &quot;Unable to connect to wireless network&quot; and the icon has a red x on it. I have decent computer skills but no wireless skills at all, for the record. When I got home, I could not connect to the new router still. I tried switching the wireless on and off, tried disabling then enabling, checking firewall settings, no avail. In the Wireless Network Connection box, the wireless card can detect local wireless networks in my area, including mine. Sometimes it says its connected, but I still have that red X on the wireless icon and that message telling me it is disconnected. More stats: Wireless card is Broadcom 4321AG, status is Not Connected. When I attempt connection, I get this message in Details: IP address: 0.0.0.0. Subnet Mask: 0.0.0.0. (my network info) Signal Strength: Excellent Encryption: Disabled I tried to get my computers IP by doing a cmd ipconfig/release, and the message I got was: &quot;No operation can be performed on local area connection 2 while it has its media disconnected. No operation can be performed on Wireless Network Connection whie is has its media disconnected.&quot; I downloaded WinsockXPFix to restore, but this did not work. I am not even sure if this is the problem. I am on the verge of reinstalling the driver for Broadcom, since I hear so many bad things about downgraded systems from Vista. Any insight? As last resort...Anyone know a decent online chat support that doesn't cost too much money?
