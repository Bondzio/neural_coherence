After buying over a dozen HP printers over past 20 years, seeing HP quality steadly go down hill, I am looking to buy a CANON ALL-IN-ONE printer. I am looking at various Canon printers (prefer under $150) and would appreciate input on opinions of which is best for ink usage, decent draft printing and reliability. (My current HP AIO locks up after about every 3 use) I don't print photos, so photo print quality not important. Thanks Ben

As long as you get those consumer printers you might find they expire in 1 to 2 years. Same issue exists for all the makers. Bob
