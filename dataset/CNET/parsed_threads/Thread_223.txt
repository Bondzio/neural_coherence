<s> Im looking for advice on exactly what to do with the HD I just ordered. </s>
<s> I just bought a Western Digital 250 gig EIDE HD that has an 8mb cache, and 7200 rpm. </s>
<s> I currently have a 40 gig HD, 7200 rpm, 2 mb cache, which is pretty much full. </s>
<s> My system is 1.7 ghz Celeron, 1150 mb memory, running Win XP. </s>
<s> Speed improves with fewer services, paging of files, limiting CPU usage, and increased memory with lower memory consumption. </s>
<s> Mounr t the new drive in hardware as a slave. </s>
<s> Cables do automatic selection. </s>
<s> Move some of the files here. </s>
<s> A more efficient use would be to install FreeBSD and set up RAID on both drives. </s>
<s> Then you would edit services during install and use /sbin/sysinstall to encrypt the disk. </s>
