1.1.1	About 2 weeks ago my cpu suddenly started freezing .	St
1.1.2	It would click 1 time and freeze .	St
1.1.3	I installed speed fan and looked in the bios and it was reading 75C .	St
1.1.4	So I took it almost completely apart and cleaned everything .	St
1.1.5	I cleaned the heatsink and reapplied thermal paste .	St
1.1.6	It still would click 1 time and freeze and was still hot at 71C .	St
1.1.7	A few days after that it started completely shuting down on top of the click and freeze .	St
1.1.8	The only way to get it to turn back on after it would shutdown is to flip the power supply switch to the other side and back .	St
1.1.9	Then i noticed the next day that it reads 71C to 75C in both SF and the Bios as soon as I turn it on .	St
1.1.10	The heat sink is set on correctly .	St
1.1.11	The processor is the only thing showing hot besides the ACPI thermal zone which allways shows the same temp .	St
1.1.12	I have had it for for 4 years and never had a problem .	St
1.1.13	Ohh yea , the fans are working fine .	St
1.1.14	Help !	St
1.1.15	& gt ; Processor : AMD Athlon XP & gt ; & gt ; General Information Type : AMD Athlon XP Internal Specification : AMD Athlon ( tm ) XP 2500+ Codename : Barton Revision : A2 Technology : 0.13 CPU ID : 6.A.0 CPU IDEx : 7.A.0 Top : Bottom	St
1.2.1	AMD cpus do n't take well to & quot ; over temp & quot ; operation .	St
1.2.2	It may have already failed and is not going to get better .	St
1.2.3	You 've reached a tipping point until you can cool it better .	St
1.2.4	IMHO , it needs to be replaced , its probably succumbed to heat damage .	St
1.2.5	However , you MUST be sure the heat compound is applied correctly , not too much or too little .	St
1.2.6	Though , you only need a small amount to do the job .	St
1.2.7	Check this out : http : //www.arcticsilver.com/instructions.htm ( good info ) If you throttle down the AMD 2500+ to say 2000+ cpu instead , it recognized that way , it may not overheat too quickly and really test it .	St
1.2.8	If it lasts longer before a freeze , its the cpu .	St
1.2.9	You can try a better HSF setup that better at cooling as well and see if it handles it better .	St
1.2.10	Also , the socket itself may have & quot ; crystallized & quot ; causing intermittent contact/operation so only a new mtrbd .	St
1.2.11	instead of cpu .	St
1.2.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	I was thinking the cpu was going bad i just wanted to hear it from someone else before i spent money on the wrong thing .	St
1.4.1	It would be the 1st step , however as always , its a logical procedure should it not be the problem .	St
1.4.2	The other candidates are weak psu and/or mtrbd. , also possible bad ram .	St
1.4.3	Reseat the ram and/or use less if more than 1 stick present .	St
1.4.4	Also , are there any beep sequence or error message , maybe a beeping sequence then ?	Ques
1.4.5	If not , then the cpu again .	St
1.4.6	Good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.5.1	No there is no error messages or beeping sequence .	St
1.6.1	with each core showing 23 or below at idle .	St
1.6.2	Cooler is stock .	St
1.6.3	Ambient is 70F .	St
1.6.4	What 's the CPU voltage ?	Ques
1.6.5	Sure the HS is flat and making good contact ?	Ques
1.6.6	VAPCMD	St
