<s> I am installing two dvd's in a new machine. </s>
<s> A DVD ROM and a DVD Burner. </s>
<s> The DVD ROM was packaged with an audio wire. </s>
<s> The dvd burner did not. </s>
<s> The question is, when installing both devices, do I need an audio cable from both devices to the motherboard or just from the dvd rom to the motherboard? </s>
<s> I run the audio connection to the drive which I will play AudioCDs in. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Set the drive's properties to &quot;Enable digital CD audio for this device&quot;. </s>
<s> Good luck, Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about internet connections, and download free software. </s>
