bob, many thanks for your reply.
i am aware of the details contained in your link.
this is the reason that i am enquiring if anyone has any knowledge of a printer that will print the chosen label directly on to the cd or dvd, and not on to a label to stick onto the cd or dvd.
the reason, also, that i mentioned the details that i did about the printer that i have and the programme that i have been using to print the items.
kind regards colinito
