<s> It appears your flash drive isn't supported by the 'school system' as it wasn't installed on it. </s>
<s> It just isn't generic enough to be accepted, though I'm sure a plain flash drive is. </s>
<s> See, if the school will allow an install so you can proceed, if not see what products are supported. </s>
<s> It may mean the school system needs to be updated as a possible another source of the problem. </s>

<s> My teacher said that they don't have much more rights then we do, and we tried it with the teacher and it did the same thing. </s>
<s> ='[. </s>
<s> Is there any alterations that I could make to the flash drive and not the computer? </s>
<s> I can run programs just not install them. </s>
<s> also* generic flash drives do work on these, but this is 10x more not likely to be stolen if I leave it in my computer class. </s>
