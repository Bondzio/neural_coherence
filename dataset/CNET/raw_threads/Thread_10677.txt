This will allow you to purchase some OEM parts. For example, the retail versions of hard drives and DVD drives come with cables and usually some software. The OEM versions do not not come with cables or software (usually), but you can use the cables that come with the motherboard.

Any utility software that comes with the HD can be downloaded free from the mfg website. If you need CD/DVD burning software, go ahead and get the retail version of the DVD drive. I think it's worth it if you don't have any on the computer. Some folks end up using free burning software anyway (CDBurnerXP). You can find some retail DVD burner drives for about the same price as OEM. One of my favorites is the NEC 3540A (retail or OEM, check NewEgg.com). Buy OEM Windows XP when you make the qualifying hardware purchase. The best deals that I find are the weekly rebate specials from brick-n-mortar stores (CompUSA, CircuitCity, Staples, etc.) The retail price after rebate often beats online OEM; however, you have to get lucky with rebates being offered when you need the part. In general, though, most of the hardware and software for my builds is OEM and comes from NewEgg.com, Geeks.com, ChiefValue.com, et al. Price comparision sites like PriceGrabber.com and Shopping.com come in handy.
