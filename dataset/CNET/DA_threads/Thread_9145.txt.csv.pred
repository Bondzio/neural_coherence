1.1.1	hey guys quick question how come when i go play a game like FEAR or any other kind of new game with a auto detect performance thing it always puts my cpu at medium but i dont get that cause my CPU is brand new its a X2 4800+.	St
1.1.2	is it because it is only 2.4?	St
1.1.3	which brings me to my next question if intel has 3.6 and higher CPUs how come they are not better when the AMD only has 2.4 and 2.8 i think are the highest?	St
1.2.1	and higher clock speed does help gaming.	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	if your mobo detects you processor correctly and its just the games you play that doesn't, there's the probability that those games weren't written with an ID of your new proc.	St
1.4.2	so it would just match it with the closest ID it can find.	St
1.4.3	AMD procs has a different architecture than Intel procs.	St
1.4.4	they don't crunch data the same way.	St
1.4.5	so its not really an apple to apple comparison.	St
1.5.1	the mobo sees the CPU right?	St
1.6.1	you can find that out on the POST (Power On Self Test) screen.	St
1.6.2	its first screen that pops out when you turn on your PC.	St
1.6.3	you should see your BIOS version, CPU info and available RAM there.	St
