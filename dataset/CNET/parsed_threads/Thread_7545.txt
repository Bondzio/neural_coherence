<s> Any recommendations (note: must meet all specifications below)? </s>
<s> - Brand name - SATA II - Aluminum - Has a good fan - Has vent holes - Prevents vibration/shock - Quiet fan - Good chipset - Internal: SATA, External: USB </s>
<s> Even the units made by WD, Maxtor. </s>
<s> Let me note this item you listed &quot;Prevents vibration/shock&quot;. </s>
<s> That would have to include a sensor to tell the drive to park. </s>
<s> Outside of a few laptops nothing has this. </s>
<s> You may see such in a few years but not today. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
<s> Newegg.com....they've got an excellent search engine for their products. </s>
<s> Not sure it makes anything faster with a 3.0GB SATA as the max USB 2.0 transfer rate is limited to 480Mb/s. </s>
<s> This one might work ...if you can find it in stock http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817145390 </s>
<s> Their list exceeds what I see in such devices today. </s>

<s> Shock sensors...haven't seen any with them. </s>
<s> But for the right price...I'm sure someone could add shock sensors and maybe even shock absorbers. </s>
<s> Only problem it would be so expensive, no one would buy. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> While admirable for the list, to prevent such shocks and more, the unit would almost need to have Artificial Intelligence with video sensors and legs to move out of the way of an oncoming collision. </s>
