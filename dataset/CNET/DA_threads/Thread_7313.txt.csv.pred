1.1.1	I just bought this video card : http : //www.bfgtech.com/bfgr85256gte.aspx Works great for my purposes , but the fan is way too loud !	St
1.1.2	Can anyone point me to a nice , quiet fan ?	Ques
1.1.3	I 'm not sure what I 'd be looking for exactly and I could really use someone 's help .	St
1.1.4	Also , I noticed the stock fan can be 'slid ' out from the silver Heatsink , so would I need to get a fan that can also 'slide ' in ?	Ques
1.1.5	I 'm guessing that 's not going to be easy to find and that I 'll need a completely new heatsink/fan product ?	Ques
1.2.1	Did you look at replacement heatsink and fans at newegg.com and geeks.com ?	Ques
1.2.2	I 'm fitting this one on a Nvidia I own - & gt ; http : //www.geeks.com/details.asp ? invtid=A1655	Ques
1.3.1	I think that 's a little over the top in terms of how much cooling I need for the card , no ?	Ques
1.3.2	I was looking for something a little simpler ... Also , the current heatsink is & quot ; glued & quot ; on to the card I guess with some special heat-absorbent glue or something ?	Ques
1.3.3	Would I need to buy that kind of glue ?	Ques
1.4.1	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16835119080 Would something like this fit ?	Ques
1.4.2	Are the push-pin locations standard across all VGA cards ?	Ques
1.4.3	Is there a better solution ?	Ques
1.5.1	See if there are others at newegg and the usual places .	St
1.5.2	I chose this one so I do n't have to revisit it next year or so .	St
1.5.3	My bet is that even if the fan failed the passive cooling might be enough .	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	Make it fanless .	St
1.6.2	The Accelero S2 provides better cooling than some fan-based stock heatsinks and is zero noise .	St
1.6.3	The only caveat is that your case needs good airflow .	St
1.6.4	And since you 're probably going to hang onto the card for a while - what 's $ 8 extra really ?	Ques
1.6.5	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16835186017	Ques
1.7.1	That is a good suggestion and ideally I would do that , however , I have a stock Dell E521 machine and I do n't think there is enough air-flow in the whole tower for a solution like this to work ... but I 'm not positive ...	St
1.8.1	You need to visit overclocking and/or modding websites to help better with cooling replacements and/or tips/clues .	St
1.8.2	Just google away for possible websites to visit .	St
1.8.3	Once , you find such sites , they explain or direct you to possible fixes , replacements , etc. , do n't expect too simple a solution as you mentioned you have a glued on heatsink .	St
1.8.4	If you can , simply return the video card and get one that better suits your needs .	St
1.8.5	A quick note , to remove any glued on heatsink , you & quot ; freeze & quot ; and snap off as the sticking glue may not hold .	Sug
1.8.6	However , you do this at your own risk .	St
1.8.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.9.1	Should n't be a problem .	St
1.9.2	In fact , the cooler will face up so it might even perform better .	St
1.9.3	The only issue I can see on the E521 is clearance between the cooler when installed and the CPU HSF shroud .	St
1.9.4	Dimensions should be up on the Arctic website , so double-check before buying .	St
1.10.1	... and I 'm sure you 're aware of this , but as far as I 'm aware the third-party fan invalidates the BFG lifetime warranty .	St
1.10.2	It 's normally not a big deal but just , like , warning you	St
1.11.1	... actually , maybe not .	St
1.11.2	I 've realised the PCI backplate for the Accelero would n't fit since you have no blanking plates above the GPU slot .	St
1.11.3	Hmmm .	St
1.11.4	What you 'll need is an 'over and under ' passive cooler .	St
1.11.5	I 'll get back to you .	St
1.12.1	Not noisy at all now .	St
1.12.2	But I did have the hacksaw off a small corner since a heatsink on the motherboard was in the same area .	St
1.12.3	This heatsink looks like it will do fine without the fan in this system but we 'll see how it runs later .	St
1.12.4	Bob	St
1.13.1	Ah , I see , thanks for the heads up and thanks for looking into this for me .	St
1.13.2	I really appreciate it .	Polite
1.13.3	So , maybe a fan-based solution is best after all ?	Ques
1.13.4	Let me know ...	St
1.13.5	Thanks again !	St
1.14.1	... and also , what are my options to avoid voiding the warranty , if possible ?	Ques
1.15.1	Why is n't this a warranty issue ?	Ques
1.16.1	What do you mean ?	Ques
1.17.1	What do you guys think of this fan ?	Ques
1.17.2	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16835226018 Is there anything cheaper for around the same noise level ?	Ques
1.18.1	You ca n't fix it without voiding the warranty so it 's back to dealing with the company to fix it .	St
1.18.2	Bob	St
1.19.1	It 's the Video card that I just bought which works but has a very loud fan IMO .	St
1.19.2	Others might be able to deal with it , but I find it very high-pitched and irritating after a while , so I would like to replace it with a quieter fan .	St
1.19.3	I do n't think it 's necessarily 'broken ' .	St
1.20.1	It 's warranty is over .	St
1.20.2	Is that not worth doing ?	Ques
1.21.1	If any of my previous BFG 's are anything to go by , silence is not their game .	St
1.21.2	I do n't think they attach their HSF 's to any sort of speed control .	St
1.22.1	There 's a similarly priced Gigabyte , but all rely on an 80mm fan to move air - the same as your choice .	St
1.22.2	I 'm out of ideas for a fanless solution .	St
