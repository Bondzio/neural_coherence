Ok Heres the time line of events Original hard drive working wine with WinXP Buy new 160gb seagate hard drive and install Ubuntu Linux. (I left the xp drive in place, but i just swapped the ide cable to the new drive). I run the new seagate hard drive with linux (which installed fine the first try) for a few days then switch the ide cable back to my xp drive....no problem. few days of widows...open the case plug the ide back to linux, start-up and BAM...problem. Ubuntu would start loading but would hang and never get to the desktop. I would have to switch off the power. I never had a problem loading Linux before i switched to the other XP hard drive. I try to reinstall Ubuntu...but it doesn't let me reinstall gives me an error during installation. So I switch back to the XP drive, and everything boots up fine, then after about 5 min, the computer just turns off. Does this everytime i boot up win xp. 5 mins of running than BAM - off. So i decide to reinstall XP and now it wont reinstall XP, it hangs during install. So now Ive got two seperate hard drives both of which won't complete a full install of an O.S. and I've tried both XP and Ubuntu on both hard drives same problem on both drives. I checked the new seagate drive using the diagnostics disk, and no problems were detected, i even wrote zeros to the entire drive (took about 10 hours) and still the same problem when trying to reinstall. Since this happened to two drives that were never connected at the same time, and because the diagnostics for my hard disk comes back clean I assume I may have a hard ware failure somewhere else. Could this be a MB problem? Any suggestions on how i solve this problem. (good thing my laptop still works!) Thanks, -Brent

If you remove any HD from your configuration (comparing with configuration when Linux was installed), or change Primary/Secondary or Master/Slave position, Linux won't boot without /etc/fstab reconfiguration. Please, send error reported in boot sequence.

Make sure all fans, including any on the CPU are spinning. Also check for cables/wires that might block a fan when you close the case. Are both hard drives powered on during your tests? Unplug the power connector to the drive you're not using. Make sure the IDE cable is firmly and correctly connected to the hard drive and the motherboard. When one starts to move things around, it easy to turn one simple problem (stopped fan) into two problems (stopped fan and loose IDE cable.) Could be other things. Be specific about what the problems during your installs.
