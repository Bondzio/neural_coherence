hi all my dell dimensions 8200 (6 yrs old) has a 64mb nvidia ti4200 - it appears to have died - diagnostic lights on back of pc indicate issue with graphics card and get no signal to screen.
(tried re-seating it several times) looking for a replacement agp card - any suggestions - there don't seem to be many around these days and don't want to have to mess with changing power supply etc.. another question can i use a pci card instead - would the pc boot up if i used one in place of an agp type?
thanks pc dell 8200 windows xp 256mb memory
