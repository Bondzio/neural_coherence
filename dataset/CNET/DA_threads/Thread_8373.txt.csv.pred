1.1.1	Windows 98SE recognizes my Kensington serial trackball as a generic serial mouse, and it works OK when I first plug it in.	St
1.1.2	The problem occurs later, when I reboot, and no mouse is recognized at all.	St
1.1.3	There does not appear to be anything wrong with the connector.	St
1.1.4	Should I get an adaptor and try it on the PS/2 port.	St
1.1.5	Is it any better than the serial port, or is there no difference at all?	St
1.1.6	Although I have another USB mouse that works fine,I like the Kensington because the size of the trackball makes it easy to move around.	St
1.1.7	Any suggestions?	St
1.2.1	Go to Start&gt;Settings&gt;Control Panel.	St
1.2.2	Double-click System and go to the Device Manager tab.	St
1.2.3	If there is an yellow exclamation point next to the mouse, then you may have to install the mouse drivers.	St
1.3.1	Did you ever get your trackball working properly?	St
1.3.2	I have one (use Win XP) that has become problematic; working 50% of the time and vice-versa.	St
1.3.3	I have no idea what is wrong with it.	St
1.3.4	I love the big OLD thing and have no idea what I should replace it with.	St
1.3.5	Are there any other die hard trackball users out there with advice about current models?	Ques
