<s> I'm teaching a friend how to use his computer. </s>
<s> He is using Windows XP and Internet Explorer 8. </s>
<s> I have installed au.yahoo as the homepage. </s>
<s> However, the news on this homepage is now a couple of months old. </s>
<s> Each time I open a new browser window, it shows today's date but the news headlines are 28th February 2010 - the date I installed the home page. </s>
<s> I suggested to my friend that he temporarily change his homepage to 'The Age' (newspaper) www.theage.com.au - so that he can read up-to-date news. </s>
<s> But the same thing has happened with this page! </s>
<s> I changed it on the 31st March, and each day when he opens this page, the current date is shown, but the news items remain those of the 31st March! </s>
<s> So this homepage news is frozen too! </s>
<s> A link to view the day's paper works ok, but the news items on the home page don't change. </s>
<s> I emailed Yahoo to report this problem, and they gave me some ideas to try - Clearing the cache Disabling Internet Browser Add-ons / Plug-ins Temporarily disabling Anti-virus/Anti-spy and Firewall Products (and starting a new browser each time). </s>
<s> I did all these but there was no change. </s>
<s> Next they asked me for the source code which I gave them - &lt;!-- p6.www.aue.yahoo.com compressed/chunked Sun Feb 28 17:50:08 EST 2010 --&gt; They replied on the 8th April (2 weeks ago) that they have passed the matter on to their engineering team for further investigation. </s>
<s> Has anyone ever had this problem and if so, what can I do to fix it? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Press Control+F5 to refresh. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Go into tools =&gt; internet options; on the general tab, click on &quot;settings&quot; and then click the &quot;every visit to the page&quot; option. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> And sorry, I just use Firefox, Chrome, or &quot;other than IE.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> Hi Bob, Your second idea was the solution!! </s>
<s> I can't believe this but his setting was 'never'!! </s>
<s> I have no idea why it was set up that way. </s>
<s> No wonder it was never refreshing! </s>
<s> Any setting on his computer is inherited from the family member who gave it to him, but I don't know why anyone would not want a homepage (or any other webpage) to refresh each time. </s>
<s> Such a simple solution but I hadn't thought of it myself, so thank you very much!! </s>
<s> Helen </s>
<s> Sometimes it's better to just ask and hope someone has a few ideas. </s>
<s> I'm sure this is not the only cause but with 127 settings in these browsers I bet I have one wrong. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I checked my own setting and it's on 'automatic' which I imagine has much the same effect as 'every visit'. </s>
<s> I think I'll write to yahoo tech support and increase their knowledge base - they seem to be still thinking about it! </s>
<s> lol Thanks again Bob....much appreciated! </s>
