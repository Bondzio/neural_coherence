It completely crashed, so I re-installed the system, and it turns on fine, however it makes an irritating beeping noise that dosen't stop unless I obviously turn it off. Anyway the shop said i needed a new mother board,and its going to cost me 150 bucks. I dont have that kind of money right now, I'm a student but in my free time I use adobe photoshop and psp to make graphics. The guy at the shop said to replace it would be like buying a new transmission for a car w/ 90,000 miles on it. So i am going to buy a new computer, I'll get the money from my dad or something, anyway i was wondering if anyone has some insight about the beeping, because i'm concerned the people at the shop are ripping me off. If it is a valid reason to replace the m-b however, i would like to know what kind of computer I should buy that is under 700 dollars and has alot of memory, and will witstand internet and virus. Also, does anyone know of a REALLLY good virust protection program?

My dad picked up this a few weeks ago -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=PJ473AAR&cat=SYS You didn't describe your machine very well so its nigh impossible to tell much what would be possible to replace cheap. Try the usual and reseat all the chips and boards with the power off. Bob
