<s> I want to upgrade my 1ghz processor. </s>
<s> Any recommendations? </s>
<s> Soemthing around $100, maybe a Pentium 4, between 2 and 3 ghz. </s>
<s> Also need to know how difficult/simple this is? </s>
<s> I've done quite a few upgrades that were all easy plug and play. </s>
<s> Is this the same? </s>
<s> That means you likely have a P3. </s>
<s> To upgrade to a P4, you need a motherboard or hold the P4, new power supply since it's quite hungry and the RAM changes too. </s>
<s> With all the heat, a new case is fitted. </s>
<s> If you were to stick with the P3, it's unlikely any real gain of moving to the 1.2GHz would be worth it even if your old machine could support it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So is it worth the trouble of going P4? </s>
<s> I don't have the money to get a new PC. </s>
<s> I've already upgraded to 512 RAM, bought a new DVD burner, 160MB external HD, and 2.0 USB PCI card. </s>
<s> So I'm pretty much at a point of no turning back to buy a new PC. </s>
<s> If I could upgrade my processor I'd be good for a long time and have saved some cash. </s>
<s> So mother board, power supply and the processor I understand, but you say I need a new tower case? </s>
<s> That's sound like some work transfering everything over, or did I misunderstand. </s>
<s> Information needed to create an informed recommendation: CPU socket type --&gt; memory type --&gt; Motherboard Mnf. </s>
<s> --&gt; vendor or custom case --. </s>
<s> P/S wattage. </s>
<s> Upgrading the CPU does not automatically increase the speed of the system. </s>
<s> The Clock Rate , Data Buss , Address Buss , Memory Type are all factors in overall system speed. </s>
<s> Bill </s>
<s> neither of them told you the cost of what your talking about a 3.2GHZ Pentium 4 is $220 w/o mobo or anything </s>
<s> Well, I think most of the items you mentioned you will be able to use them in your mobo, except a few. </s>
