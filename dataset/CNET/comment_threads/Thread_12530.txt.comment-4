I bought some speakers and it improved my music quality tons.
I purchased Ev Sonic Xs THe tend to be alittle expense depends on where you find them.
With a 120 watt Subwoffer and 2 60 watt speakers you cant go wrong.
240 watts best clear sound they can cost from 100 to 150.
But Bose speakers which are really small and have little base but a really really crisp sound.
I have purchased both but i enjoy the ev sonic because of the power.
