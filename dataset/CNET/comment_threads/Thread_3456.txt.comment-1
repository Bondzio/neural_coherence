I am running WinXP Prof and have SP2 installed.
I purchased a Belkin 802.11g wireless card for the desktop but it is not recognized as a device.
I tried to search for new hardware and no luck.
Can this be a SP2 problem?
I know the slots are working because it will recognize other cards.
(NIC and Sound card).
I also know the wireless card works because I installed in another machine and it detected.
The only thing was the 2nd machine was a Dell without SP2 installed.
Any help would be appreciated.
