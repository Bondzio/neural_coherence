1.1.1	Hi Guys, I hope I am in the right place.	St
1.1.2	I am plannign on building a new computer.	St
1.1.3	I did it several years ago and then went to buying the dells.	St
1.1.4	Currently I have a dell 4600.	St
1.1.5	It just does not do the trick anymore.	St
1.1.6	I want to build a really decent machine.	St
1.1.7	I prefer intel chips but I could be swayed.	St
1.1.8	I currently have an ATI 9600 AGP video card which is good enough for now.	St
1.1.9	It would be great if I can use my existing memory but I am okay if I can't.	Polite
1.1.10	So here is the questions Which MB shoudl I buy Which Processor chip should I buy Case?	St
1.1.11	Currently I am fine wiht my HD's Just want to know what I should be looking for.	St
1.1.12	I would like to keep the system under $1,000 being that I have the video card, hd's and possibly some memory I don't thik it should be that hard.	St
1.1.13	Please let me know what I shoudl buy.	Sug
1.1.14	I try and keep my machines for abour 3 years.	St
1.1.15	I want this to be totally compatible with vista and run fast as well.	St
1.1.16	Please help.	St
1.2.1	I am assuming I am going to get a 64 bit processor.	St
1.2.2	Do I need to use xp 64 bit (I have it) If I do, are some of my components not compatible?	St
1.2.3	Or.. Do I need to go with a duel boot?	St
1.3.1	not much of a use...wait till vista... dont think u can dual boot 2 versions of xp u will need a motherboard.	St
1.3.2	list the specs of your current computer...such as ram specs?	St
1.3.3	motherboard?	St
1.3.4	processor?	St
1.3.5	etc.	St
1.3.6	processor...right now i would go with an amd athlon x2 3800+.	St
1.3.7	amd outperforms intel and runs cooler.	St
1.3.8	ram...dpeending on whether u can salvage case: your choice... powersupply- i would recommend antec, seasonic, enermax, pc power and cooling, has to be at least 400-450watts optical drives- dvd burner?	St
1.3.9	and for the graphics card?	St
1.3.10	i dont think it is that good...and considering the prices of graphics cards have dropped so much.... i would recommend the 6800gs which can be had for about $160.	St
1.3.11	if u want to spend like 100-150 more...get the newer 7900gt.	St
1.3.12	but both are way faster than the 9600 u use.	St
1.3.13	with a better graphics card, you can play newer games or older games at higher resoultions and settings and have much better visual quality.	St
1.3.14	and keyboard, mouse, speakers, and monitor	St
1.4.1	a link http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/expert/russel_september10.mspx	St
1.5.1	there are many threads about people with athlon x2's having weird problems while playing games.	St
1.5.2	in a few years, all games will be designed for dual cores, but in the meantime...	St
1.6.1	okay so here is where i am so far I just got the MB and processor any comments?	St
1.6.2	Thank you for all of your responses.	St
1.6.3	So far here is where I am at with this: Processor http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16819103562 AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+ Manchester 1GHz HT 2 x 512KB L2 Cache Socket 939 Dual Core Processor cost $295 motherboard ASUS A8R32 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131004 cost $209 Before I go any furthur am I heading on the right track?	St
1.7.1	Just a tip.	St
1.7.2	Don't buy your computer yet.	Sug
1.7.3	Wait until the neew AMD processors com out so that the price of the AMD Athlon X2 3800+ goes down.	St
1.7.4	The same with the motherboard.	St
1.7.5	I also recommend the Asus A8N-SLI Deluxe.	St
1.7.6	Its not a new MB but it has won a lot of awards.	St
1.8.1	&gt; I think I may go with the ASRock 939Dual-SATA2 ATX.	St
1.8.2	This MB has a AGP slot as well as a PCI express slot.	St
1.8.3	So I can use my old agp video card which is still a very powerful card.	St
1.9.1	Wait for AMD Socket AM2.	St
1.9.2	It supports DDR2 memory which is better than DDR.	St
1.9.3	It will also work with Vista like the other 64bit cpus.	St
