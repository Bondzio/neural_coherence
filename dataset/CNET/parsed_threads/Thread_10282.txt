<s> Hello, So basically I put together a computer and it just refuses to post. </s>
<s> I've cleared the CMOS via pin, taken out the battery. </s>
<s> The BIOS speaker makes a small faint clicking noise about every .800 MS (almost 1sec) I'm using an AMD Athlon II X3 3.3 GHz PSU is fine, I've tested it in another PC.. works fine (550 WAT PSU) Graphics card is fine (GTX 460) I've tested it in another PC. </s>
<s> CPU is fine, tested it in another PC... </s>
<s> I tried my memory from another PC to this one, the memory has lights and the lights ALWAYS flash when i boot my PC but they stayed solid with PC that didn't post. </s>
<s> It still clicks with the CPU out or in same with memory I've reseated the CPU 3-4 times no bent pins, looks fine and the CPU even gets hot when it's in.. </s>
<s> I also checked the connectors on the heatsink/fan to the mobo.. fine too. </s>
<s> I've unplugged all devices like keyboard/mouse, etc but still clicks. </s>
<s> I fear the worst, the motherboard? </s>
<s> Here's the mobo: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005X64M4G/ref=oh_o03_s00_i00_details </s>
<s> Does this have a monster power supply with a Single Rail 12V? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> No, dual rail with 60A on the dual 12v rails. </s>
<s> Place the motherboard on a cardboard square and try building the basic PC there. </s>
<s> No video card is required to power up so if the PSU, motherboard won't power up there, then you are looking at the bad parts. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I think it's the motherboard. </s>
<s> on a cardboard box with nothing but the PSU/CPU/MEM/CPU FAN it clicks still. </s>
<s> Usually when i take out the the CPU it would turn off.. it doesn't .. doesn't when i put it in either. </s>
<s> I wiggle in around with a CRAPLOAD of pressure and it turns off.. so I'm thinking mobo issue. </s>
<s> the pins on the CPU are absolutely straight, i just got the CPU in the mail today. </s>
<s> yep, it was the motherboard. </s>
<s> I took off the CPU socket cover and there were like 3 bent pin contacts. </s>
<s> I'd rather not risk putting them back in place to bend the CPU pins so I'm gonna get a new mobo. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help guys. </s>
<s> I find the cardboard out of the case test to be helpful at times. </s>
<s> Not a good result but helpful to narrow it down. </s>
