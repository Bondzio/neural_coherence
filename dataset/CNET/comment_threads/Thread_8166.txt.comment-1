I see that HP and other manufacturers have government edition printers and the prices for these may be lower.
(example at link below) http://www.provantage.com/scripts/search.dll?QUERY=cp2025dn&Submit.x=0&Submit.y=0 When I compare the two, I see no difference in specs but a difference in price.
Does anyone here know if there are any hardware differences that would make them less suitable for consumer use?
TIA
