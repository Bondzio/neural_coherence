i consider the warranty period to be the life expectancy.
external hard drives have a much shorter warranty than internal hard drives.
therefore the best &quot;external&quot; hard drive would be to use an external docking station that allows for internal hard drives such as thermaltake's blacx unit.
usb 2.0 and/or esata connectivity.
another way would be to place an internal hard drive into an external hard drive enclosure.
with the price of hard drives going down as fast as they are, the simplest and easiest method is to use the external docking station.
due to it being a bare internal hard drive you would need to protect it while stored.
if you kill the drive, just rma it.
works for me.
