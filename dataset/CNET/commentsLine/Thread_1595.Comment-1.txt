ok, the story goes, i bought this epson c82 inkjet printer about 4 months ago.
now i ran out of black awhile ago and bought some at a discount online and things have been fine.until i ran out of magenta, now nothing is printing, so i replaced all with epson c80 ink from office depot, still no printing, i cleaned the heads 5 times, did all mantenience and nothing.
so i thought it was the c80 ink.
so i bought c82 ink at a discount online and tried printing just a cover letter and all i got is just some streaks, then i tried a photo setting and i got a very faint and streaked print.sooo, i called epson customer service and they want to charge me $9 for their help, forget that, can anyone help, or do i have to pay the $9 for a phone call?
i want to throw this thing out the window, help!
thanks mike
