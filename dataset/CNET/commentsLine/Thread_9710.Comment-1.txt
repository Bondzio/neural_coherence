i have an hp pavilion 513n with a 1.8gig processor.
previous to my problem the computer had been sitting for several weeks.
i had taken the memory out and had not fully replaced it into the mobo slot.
without realizing this i turned on the computer.
it beeped a lot, the power button light was on, and the hd access light stayed on continuously.
when i realized what i had done, i unplugged the computer and replaced the memory solidly into the slot.
since then when i boot it, i get the screen message &quot;operating system not found.&quot; when i go into setup, it shows no primary master or slave drive.
it shows my memory, floppy drive and dvd-rom(as a secondary master) correctly.
the computer will boot from the floppy drive with a windows 98 boot disk.
it runs programs from the floppy disk without problems.
i have tried a different,working hd.
i can hear it running, but the bios will not recognize it is there.
i have switched cables.
nothing i try has worked.
any help would be appreciated.
thanks
