I burn them at 24x with Nero Express, but it keeps on showing a Unrecoverable Read Error. The CD burns okay, but it takes a incredibly long time. This is really frustrating. A CD that would normally take 10 or less minutes to burn now takes 25 or more. I use an LG GSA-4082B DVD burner, with the latest edition of Nero
