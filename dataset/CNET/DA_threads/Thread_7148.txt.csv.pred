1.1.1	I am wondering how to tell when a power supply upgrade is recommended .	St
1.1.2	Here is some information about my current PC configuration : Windows XP SP2 Pentium D Processor 1GB RAM GeForce 6600 Video Card ATI TV Tuner Card SoundBlaster XFI Sound Card Qty .	St
1.1.3	2 250GB Seagate Hard Drives ( one as PVR and other a main drive ) Qty .	St
1.1.4	1 160GB Seagate Hard Drive ( used for backups ) Linksys Wireless Card From what I can see , the power supply is 350W .	St
1.1.5	Any other information that would be helpful ?	Ques
1.1.6	Are there symptoms to look for that indicate the power supply is not sufficiently powering the system components ?	Ques
1.1.7	If an upgrade is recommended , what is a good brand ... .easy to install and wo n't drain the bank ?	Ques
1.1.8	Also , I have an LCD TV connected to the video card ( GeForce 6600 ) via DVI to HDMI .	St
1.1.9	I have not been able to get the image to fit the screen precisely - the resolution is either too high and the whole image can not be viewed or it 's too low , leaving empty space around the edges .	St
1.1.10	There 's a place in the card driver that allows for a custom resolution but it wo n't allow the resolution of the TV ( 1366x768 ) .	St
1.1.11	Is anyone aware of a card that will allow such a resolution ?	Ques
1.1.12	I 've been looking at both ATI and NVIDIA cards but I do n't see anywhere stating anything specific about this resolution .	St
1.2.1	To head off any power problems just buy a decent namebrand PSU that 's a 100W over your current rated PSU .	St
1.2.2	However , if you get a cheap PSU consider one that 's at least 500W or better , even a 600W one that suitable plus fits as it should in your system physically .	St
1.2.3	Visit this website to gauge your power needs , http : //www.pcpowerandcooling.com and if you buy one from them consider money well spent , they provide a stable and dependable PSU of highest quality .	St
1.2.4	A good stable PSU is the foundation of a good system .	St
1.2.5	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	One possible investment might be a battery backup/surge protector .	St
1.3.2	They have small enough batteries for them to be almost as big as a regular surge protector .	St
1.3.3	But with the added bonus of monitoring how much power your computer needs .	St
1.3.4	They have this so that they can calculate how long the battery will last before shutting down your computer .	St
1.3.5	Some of them will even shut down your computer automatically .	St
1.3.6	And with that software you can see for yourself what wattage your computer uses .	St
1.3.7	I guess theres those & quot ; quality watts & quot ; verses those & quot ; cheap watts & quot ; .	St
1.3.8	Unless your computer is crashing , I 'd leave it be .	St
1.4.1	site .	St
1.4.2	They have complete instructions on how to modify their drivers/software ?	Ques
1.4.3	to handle the wide screen resolutions .	St
1.4.4	Very likely that ATI also can provide such info .	St
1.4.5	I have the link on my computer at home but wo n't be back to that computer for about a week .	St
1.4.6	As far as a power supply upgrade , if you are not currently having a know power supply , I say if it ai n't broke do n't fix it .	St
1.4.7	Yep as Willy says , if you get one go up another 100 watts over your 350 .	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & q=PSU+Calculator The only thing they do n't tell you is which PSUs are really worth installing .	St
1.6.2	VAPCMD	St
1.7.1	and found that the system is only drawing about 200 watts , even when I pushed the system to utilize as many resources as possible simultaneously .	St
1.7.2	I tried a couple different of the PSU calculators and they indicated that I would need one over 400 watts .	St
1.8.1	only 70 % efficient ... some of the higher end unit go 80 % -85 % .	St
1.8.2	And the greater the efficiency ... the lower your electric bill will be .	St
1.8.3	Do they show the same ( 220W ) at startup ?	Ques
1.8.4	VAPCMD	St
