HEy everyone, I'm running a Dell Dimension 4700 PC and I have recently just bought a MSI 7600gs graphics card to replace onboard graphics.
I plug it into my PCI-E slot and everything is fine, the fan spins and it seems alright.
However, I un-installed and disabled the onboard drivers and plugged my monitor into the card.
I get nothing, my monitor doesn't even recognize a new device in the system.
I went into the BIOS and made sure it was set on 'AUTO' to read new devices, and it was set.
This is the first time I am using the PCI-E slot, is there anything I have to do to activate the slot?
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thank You
