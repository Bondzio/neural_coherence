I'm now wondering what, if any, the benefits are of having the 64-bit processor. I see that Windows has a trial 64-bit version of XP, but I'm not likely to install anything that's still in the trial stage of development. Is there anything out there I could/should be taking advantage of at this point? Thanks!

XP SP2 as well as Suse Linux 64 is a bonus as well. There's also a bufferoverflow protection feature worth noting. I'm not going back to all 32. Bob
