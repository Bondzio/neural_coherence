I have a drive from an old xp computer that i put into an external enclosure to copy some files off of it, but all the files i need require special permission to access. i tried messing around with the permissions stuff, but everytime i tried to apply full control, it said &quot;access denied&quot; for all the files i needed. so, if i hook this up internally am i gonna have the same problem and/or potentially mess up the computer/drive?
