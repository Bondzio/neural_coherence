you did say you wanted voip and 48 ports but what i see is a business use system.
if you're using voip type phones such as i've seen in some environments, they need to be powered by something.
i can't imagine 48 wall outlets so suggested the poe switch.
these will power phones but not all of the ports will necessarily have that power on by default.
you turn power on only to the ports that need to power devices and you have a maximum amount of current to work with.
there is some management involved with poe switches but it's not all that technical if it's just power management.
but, if you've already got power to all of your phones via some other method, you can still use a baseline switch.
i just thought this would eliminate a lot of extra wiring by getting it from the switch.
it's up to you since we really cannot envision the scope of the entire project.
