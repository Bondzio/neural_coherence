I've googled and tried for 3 days now.
Everything else connects fine except this laptop.
I'm at my wit's end.
Netsh... doens't wok, ipconfig / flush dns & release & renew don't work.
Weirdly, it looks like it could possibly connect to an unsecured BT wifi but I don't want to pay for that if it won't work.
I just don't get how my other laptop and iphone can connect and this one can't.
Or how it went wrong in the first place
