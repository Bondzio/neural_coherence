my roommate bought a new wireless router, installed it on his desktop and it worked fine.
then, when he shutdown his computer the signal cut out for the router and when the computer is turned back on the connection stays off.
so far the only way to get it working again is to re-install every time.
the router is still on, it's just everyone loses connection when the desktop turns off, and we can't figure out why.
he's using windows vista sp2 and the router is a d-link xtreme n gigabit router.
