notice that front row and the apple tv interface are very similar in some ways.
the tv has yet to kick off, but it may when apple includes more features.
the same with front row.
however, i liked the front row interface in tiger better than the new leopard version.
plus, itunes does not open when you play music and videos, so if you exit, the media stops playing, but that's probably because front row is its own app now, and not an add-on kind of feature.
