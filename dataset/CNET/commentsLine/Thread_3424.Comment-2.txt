&quot; is the iomega backup software just problematic?
&quot; i've yet to encounter non-problematic backup software.
it's always &quot;something&quot;.
as it is that way, i've developed my own backup methods such as written at  this is not an iomega backup web site, but just a general discussion forum so all we can do is share our experiences and if we are lucky, find a cure for such issues.
if you feel that the iomega software is buggy or needs fixing then the only place to go is ... where you suspect.
hope this helps.
