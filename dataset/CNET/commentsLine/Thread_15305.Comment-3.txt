if your pc is sluggish, you're probably running low on ram or have some crapware/malware.
the apps you mention can consume a lot of ram, but they are not cpu intensive.
i suggest you do delete any apps you don't use, do a reinstall of the os, and add another 1gb of ram.
if you must get a new pc, the low end phenoms you're looking at won't be much of an improvement since they're clocked slower than your existing pc.
a pc with &gt;4gb and either a 2.8ghz phenom ii or a 2.6 ghz core2quad should make you happy for the next few years.
