<s> I work for a school district and am trying to fix a problem with an Acer AL1715 monitor. </s>
<s> The monitor works when I boot the computer in safe mode; however, when I boot in regular mode, the monitor turns off and gives me the message &quot;input not supported&quot;. </s>
<s> I have searched help forums online pertaining to this issue, and have found a variety of solutions. </s>
<s> One suggested that I may need to change the screen resolution in safe mode, then reboot, and the problem should be fixed. </s>
<s> I did just that, but as soon as I applied a change in screen resolution, the computer automatically adjusted and changed the resolution back. </s>
<s> I could not find the driver disk for the monitor, so I looked online for a driver of this particular model. </s>
<s> I found one, but when I went to install it, I got a message that said there was no hardware on the computer that matched this driver. </s>
<s> I also tried to find a driver for the Intel graphics card, so I could reinstall it, but the mirror sites listed on the Intel website no longer contained the driver I needed. </s>
<s> I have tried these few things I have mentioned; however, I find it hard to believe that there would be either a driver issue or hardware issue. </s>
<s> Probably no driver issue, because the teacher was able to use the monitor a few days ago (she also uses a y-splitter cable to display the screen through a projector). </s>
<s> I find it also unlikely that it is a hardware issue, because I can use the monitor in safe-mode. </s>
<s> Any suggestion are greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> While in safe mode set the video mode to 800x600 and 60Hz so when you reboot it might work. </s>
<s> Then you can test other modes. </s>
