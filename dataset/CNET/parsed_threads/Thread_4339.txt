<s> I just got a vista laptop, and after hooking it up to my home network I tried to transfer music from my XP SP2 desktop to the laptop only to find that I could not see the desktop... so I did some searching on connecting XP on vista over a network downloaded a Microsoft LLDT program that was supposed to allow both machines to see each other, as well as setting the vista work-group to MShome to be the same as the desktop and turning on file sharing on. </s>
<s> For a while the vista one could see the other one but when I clicked on the name it said &quot;Windows cannot access \\joe&quot; and when I went to view the work-group on XP I get a message saying &quot;MShome is not accessible&quot; Please help, I'm really confused right now... </s>
<s> Besides creating shares, I find I must have an account on the machine I want to connect to. </s>
