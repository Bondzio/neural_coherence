hello.
i've posted this question over in cnet forum: home audio & video and on avsforum, but i should try here also.
i own a defender surveillance dvr sn500 4ch.
it comes with a basic corded usb optical mouse for on-screen navigation.
i've tried using a logitech 2.4g/nano receiver wireless mouse for remote use but it didn't seem to work after setup.
a defender-usa representative wasn't sure of a wireless mouse that would work with the dvr.
so, just wondering if anyone here knows of a wireless mouse that works with these types of dvrs ?
