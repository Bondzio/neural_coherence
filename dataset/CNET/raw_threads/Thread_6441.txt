What happens if I put PC3200 RAM with super low timings (2-2-2-5 or such) into a board and CPU that runs with PC2700? Now what happens if I increase the FSB of the CPU with the PC3200 installed? CPU is AMD Thoroughbred 2600+ @ 2.13MHz

As to the memory timing, how is the timing set in the BIOS??? bY SPD, or can you set the CAS [CL] etc? Is the mobo an overclockers type?? if so you may be able to increase the Memory clock speed 1 MHz at a time to see how fast it will run. How can you increase the FSB other than by increasing the memory clock???

My reasoning was, if I have better ram, then I could increase the FSB (with these programs) more because the RAM will allow me to go higher and be stable. I was able to push it to 143MHz, but anything that cause above a 25% CPU usage would blue screen the comp, albeit, I pushed the 2130 to 2300 or so. I would like to get to 2600 stablely if I could, and I think the only way I can do this is with better ram. Lowering the multiplier from x16 won't work, or I haven't found a program that will actually let me do it.
