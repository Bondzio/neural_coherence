<s> Question: Buying advice for my final computer: laptop, all-in-one desktop, or what? </s>
<s> I am 69 years old and about to retire on a small pension. </s>
<s> I have been shopping for &quot;my final computer,&quot; with a budget around $2,000. </s>
<s> I fancied the aesthetics of an &quot;all-in-one&quot; desktop replacement, but these seem to me to be poor value for the money and not as well-specified as laptop alternatives. </s>
<s> I am not keen on the tower replacement with wires everywhere. </s>
<s> I am a keen novice photographer/videographer with good equipment and lots of digital pictures and HD video files. </s>
<s> I would like to do some editing in my retirement. </s>
<s> My concern with the laptop would be that its life span might be quite limited because of the heat generated in the confined spaces. </s>
<s> I am not that familiar with the technical aspects of CPUs, graphic cards, and the latest Intel chips. </s>
<s> I wonder if I were to compromise on specifications and go for the aesthetics of the 'all-in-one,' what specifications would your members suggest to meet my photographic and video-editing requirements, without the need for overkill and yet not keep me waiting for ages while the computer is processing large files? </s>
<s> Best wishes and thank you! </s>

<s> It really ends up depending on how you want to use your computer - in the field, or in the office. </s>
<s> I am a pseudo-professional photographer myself, and I use a laptop to do my editing. </s>
<s> I chose a laptop (technically a notebook) over a desktop because I could take it with me in the field for on-the-fly editing at client's locations. </s>
<s> I use a 13&quot; Macbook with Lightroom 2, Aperture 2, and Photoshop CS4 to do my editing and have not had any issues in the last three years since I bought the notebook. </s>
<s> I also own a PC that I built a few years ago, though it mostly just collects dust since I purchased the Macbook. </s>
<s> If a portable was not able to handle the heat generated by its components, it would not be sold. </s>
<s> Most portable computers now have multiple-core processors that actually generate less heat than a high-speed single core processor because they can turn the unused cores &quot;off&quot; when they are idle. </s>
<s> Just because the bottom of the computer is hot to the touch doesn't mean that it is too hot to work - most chips work comfortably at 65*C (150*F). </s>
<s> If you went with an &quot;all-in-one,&quot; I'd shoot for in the range of 2.2GHz+ with at least two cores (preferably 4), and 4GB of RAM. </s>
<s> The video card isn't all that important since your dealing with stills and video files rather than rendering complicated CG video. </s>
<s> Those specs should get you cooking! </s>
<s> I've had good luck with Apple, Dell (Vostro), and Lenovo all-in-ones. </s>
<s> I would suggest that you consider purchasing a Macbook Pro laptop. </s>
<s> I have two computers one operating under Windows Vista and the Mac OSX Snow Leopard. </s>
<s> In the two years since I bought the Mac, it has never given me a scrap of trouble and is excellent if you're into photography. </s>
<s> The Windows one that I bought to take overseas in July, is a nightmare. </s>
<s> To paraphrase the Bard...To laptop or not to laptop, that is the question. </s>
<s> Laptops are often a good, if not excellent choice for both power and convenience, especially if you are going to be mobile to some extent. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, laptops are also the end result of compromises in power and flexibility to maintain the portability. </s>
<s> Desktops will ALWAYS be more powerful and versatile because they can accommodate more and larger screen and hard drive options, RAM and power supply/cooling options that won't fit in a little box. </s>
<s> The biggest questions you will need to ask yourself are these.... 1. </s>
<s> Will I be going from place A to place B and will I want/need to take my computer with me. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Will the size of the screen options I have in a laptop do what I want to do (assuming you don't hang an external monitor on it.) </s>
<s> If you answer YES to both of these questions, then by all means get a laptop. </s>
<s> BUT...if you answer NO to EITHER of these questions, then by all means, at least consider a desktop. </s>
<s> Otherwise you will end up trying to make that portable do the job in ways it might not be able to fully handle. </s>
<s> For what it's worth, I have both a desktop AND a laptop. </s>
<s> In your $2000.00 budget, you could easily do both. </s>
<s> Save your files to an external hard drive and then you can virtually eliminate the problem of not having your files with you regardless of which machine you have in front of you. </s>
<s> Then all you need is to deal with software licensing issues, which is a minor problem at worst. </s>
<s> Gartner Group consistently reports that industry replacement rate is 2- 3 years for desktops, 18-24 months for laptops. </s>
<s> Hope this helps in some form or fashion. </s>
<s> Please note I did NOT recommend a PC vs Mac, since at this stage of the game, that is not a critical question. </s>
<s> In case you want to know, both of mine are Macs. </s>
<s> Mahalo! </s>
<s> PB </s>
<s> J&R electronics has a Sony VPCL137FX/R on sale for $1699.99 with free shipping. </s>
<s> I am retired and just bought one and I am very pleased with it. </s>
<s> It is fast and appears to do all the things you want. </s>
<s> Their phone # is 1-800-221-8180 for sales or JR.com Good Luck Jaime </s>
<s> Brian, congratulations on your retirement! </s>
<s> 1st of all, if portability isn't an issue, then definitely get a desktop. </s>
<s> Much more bang for the buck, and it is much easier and cheaper to upgrade when the need arises. </s>
<s> You are right to question whether an &quot;all-in-one&quot; is really necessary. </s>
<s> Personally, I would stay away from them. </s>
<s> It sounds like you have many devices that you want to hook up to your computer (cameras, video recorders, scanners, etc). </s>
<s> A tower with lots of connectivity options sounds like just what you should be looking for. </s>
<s> Without getting too technical, the thing that you should focus on mostly is RAM. </s>
<s> Just about any mid-range computer should be able to handle what you want to do. </s>
<s> Look for something around 4Gig or more of DDR3 RAM. </s>
<s> Also, since you want to work with HD Video, a good video card is a must, but the good news is that if the computer you buy doesn't come with a good one, it is easy to upgrade a desktop. </s>
<s> Next, should you get Windows or Mac? </s>
<s> If money is no object, then the Mac is probably better suited to video editing, just because of the superior software over Windows, but Windows can handle it just fine also, at a much lower cost. </s>
<s> My advice: Spend around $700-900 for a decent computer, take the rest of the money, and save it for upgrades later on down the line. </s>
<s> Enjoy! </s>
<s> Hello Bryan, The only reason that you should consider a laptop is if you need to use the computer outside of your home. </s>
<s> Based on what you wrote, my recommendation would be an Apple iMac 27 3.2GHz. </s>
<s> It has a fast Core i3 processor and 4GB of RAM. </s>
<s> It sells for $1699 at the Apple store, which would leave you $301 to buy an Applecare extended warranty and a large capacity external desktop firewire drive to store all of your video files for editing. </s>
<s> The iMac is a perfect choice for you because it is an all in one design with high performance specifications. </s>
<s> It is extremely easy to use and it even comes with a built in video editing program called iMovie and a built in image program called iPhoto. </s>
<s> If you need more sophisticated software, almost all of the higher end video and photo editing software packages are compatible too. </s>
<s> If you would like to know more just find your local apple store or reseller and try one out. </s>
<s> The staff there should be able to answer any other questions that you may have. </s>
<s> Good luck and let me know if you post any of your photos or videos online. </s>
<s> But at 72 I'm a bit behind already:o) So far I've found the same basic landscape you report, but with new &quot;cooling bases&quot; for laptops and with USB's infinite possiblities present themselves. </s>
<s> A friend who's interests are similar to your, uses a Dell &quot;all-in-one&quot; with 6 (SIX!) </s>
<s> 500GB external HD's. </s>
<s> Another friend uses a &quot;desktop&quot; replacement, I'd mention the brand but there are so many that are so similar it doesn't seem fair to do so!) </s>
<s> but prefers &quot;cloud&quot; storage over the &quot;clutter&quot; of HD's on his desktop. </s>
<s> I'm still looking for that amazing combination of power/speed/image reproduction/flexibility and ease of use (keyboard touch, size etc et al). </s>
<s> Eager to hear the answers, and good luck to both of us! </s>
<s> With $2,000 I suggest that you not even think about your final computer -- but realize that that money will easily buy you at least two and probably three very good computers that with any luck should take you well into your 80s. </s>
<s> Assuming that you do not do serious gaming, photo editing, huge spreadsheets, or other cpu or graphics processor intensive tasks, there is no reason to spend even close to $2,000 on a machine today. </s>
<s> (And I say that as someone who from the mid-1980s until the past year or two was a firm believer in the motto that the computer that I really want is about $2,500.) </s>
<s> But for web access, word processing (even very serious stuff on book-length manuscripts), email, ordinary spreadsheets, ordinary photo editing, and similar sorts of things, you should be quite happy with a computer that ranges in price from $400-800 -- $1,000 absolute max. </s>
<s> Even if a desktop may last a bit longer -- and that is not obviously correct -- that certainly should not be a consideration. </s>
<s> The question is what you want to work on and have in your house. </s>
<s> It sounds like the clean simplicity of a laptop is attractive to you. </s>
<s> So go for it. </s>
<s> Now you have to choose size. </s>
<s> Your choices range for a 10 inch netbook up to a 17 inch behemoth that you will almost certainly leave fixed on a desk most of the time. </s>
<s> The issues here really are 1) aesthetics, 2) readability/usability, and 3) the fact that the smallest boxes usually have somewhat less computing power. </s>
<s> (I am ignoring portability and battery life, which seem not important to you.) </s>
<s> But you will be surprised at the (pleasantly) size of hard drives on these machines. </s>
<s> Unless you have truly immense music and photo collections, they will be adequate. </s>
<s> And if you really do need half a terabyte or more of storage, and external drive will handle that easily and cheaply. </s>
<s> There are great laptops out there in the $600-800 range that blow away a five year old $2,300 machine that I have passed on to a relative who still uses it happily. </s>
<s> And if you like the look of netbooks, for $400 how can you go wrong. </s>
<s> (I did that six months ago, in part because I wanted portability and long battery life, and I have been very happy. </s>
<s> But I suspect that you are probably going to be looking at 13-15 inch machines, where you do want to be in the $600-800 price range, I suspect.) </s>
<s> Which one. </s>
<s> It really doesn't matter -- or, rather, there are lots of good choices. </s>
<s> Get a good brand, from a reputable supplier, preferably when they are having a serious sale. </s>
<s> And given that you are in Saudi Arabia, the availablity of local warranty support may actually be the single most important consideration. </s>
<s> Put away the rest of the money. </s>
<s> When this one dies, do the same thing. </s>
<s> And if you keep in the $600 range -- which is VERY doable in the US -- you can do it another time as well. </s>
<s> Figuring five years as a reasonable average life for a computer of this quality, you should be working away on a very nice machine into your 80s for your $2,000. </s>
<s> I assure you, though, that if you spend it all on one now by your mid-70s you will be dissatisfied. </s>
<s> i have gone to using laptops only. </s>
<s> i do not like a desktop as they take up too much room and are too cumbersome to take in for repairs. </s>
<s> i also do not like the fact you cannot move them from room to room. </s>
<s> i have an ASUS &quot;Republic of Gamers&quot;. </s>
<s> i had my grandson remove the gaming partition and i have the whole computer for my photography. </s>
<s> it has a lot of memory and will run my printers and anything else i choose to put on it without a problem. </s>
<s> i did have a problem with it overheating. </s>
<s> that was an easy fix. </s>
<s> i put a chill pad under it and no longer have a problem. </s>
<s> i think the chill pad for my particular size laptop was about 60.00 and worth every penny. </s>
<s> there are smokers in our home as well as dogs and cats so i take my laptop twice per year for a squeaky clean for 30.00 and have absolutely no problems with it at all. </s>
<s> i will never go back to the desktop with all the room they take up. </s>
<s> this is my 4th laptop. </s>
<s> the others are still going strong as i gave them to other family members. </s>
<s> the oldest one is 10 years old. </s>
<s> Absolutely no question about...Defently Desctop with a good graphic card and high CPY Recommended for photo editing, Adobe Photoshop genuine!older version of course! </s>
<s> This my opinion, from my little experience... And dont forget a good anivirus(like Kaspersky!) </s>
<s> I'm 66 and think that you should spend somewhere around $600, get a laptop and you will get a great computer and probably a new printer also. </s>
<s> I have an HP that does about everything and I got it for under $700. </s>
<s> I also have a Dell laptop that I've had for approximately six or seven years and it works fine. </s>
<s> I keep it for my grandchildren who love some of the games that only work on XP. </s>
<s> You probably have enough time left to buy 3 or 4 new computers:), just keep up with the updates on any computer you buy. </s>
<s> First of all 69 is not old. </s>
<s> You will probably live through at least 2 more Windows updates. </s>
<s> Laptop or desktop? </s>
<s> That will depend on your mobility requirements. </s>
<s> If you do not need to work away from home get a desktop, otherwise a laptop. </s>
<s> How much should you spend? </s>
<s> You can buy a good quality desktop or a laptop and photo printer for around a $1000. </s>
<s> As previously mentioned ram ram ram. </s>
<s> You can't have too much. </s>
<s> Save the other $1000 for your next computer/upgrade or for specialized software. </s>
<s> In 3 years quite a bit can change with computer hardware. </s>
<s> When you are 75 your computer will be obsolete. </s>
<s> Important: Don't let some joker at Best Buy sell you what you do not need. </s>
<s> Any decent computer will do what you want. </s>
<s> Make sure you do research on the software you purchase. </s>
<s> The price, functionality and ease of use varies tremendously. </s>
<s> On Amazon.com, you can get it for $1,939, with no taxes and free 2 day shipping if you have Amazon Prime. </s>
<s> I bought one a few months ago (from eBay, because Bing.com had a deal where you could save 8% off the price by searching for it on Bing.com). </s>
<s> Anyhow, mine came with 3 year AppleCare, which can't be beat. </s>
<s> From what you described, it sounds like you don't really have a need to travel with it. </s>
<s> I have a 17&quot; MBP that I'm typing this on because I'm at a convention at the Gaylord National Hotel in Maryland, and my Quad Core i5 iMac is back at the office. </s>
<s> However, I can access ALL of my files because I use Dropbox for cloud storage. </s>
<s> That also means I can access them on my iPad and iPhone as well. </s>
<s> The 27&quot; desktop quad core i5 iMac (all-in-one) will give you a beautiful display to edit videos and photos, and is a pleasure to use. </s>
<s> if you can live with the 21.5&quot; desktop model, you could actually cut the cost almost in half, and then use some of the savings to increase your RAM to at least 8GB which can be beneficial, especially if you're running multiple programs. </s>
<s> AND, with the rest of the savings, you could buy the low end iPad ($499), and use that with Dropbox to show off all of your photos! </s>
<s> So I guess the recommendation I have for you is for you to really understand your needs - do you need the portability of a laptop? </s>
<s> Or, what I truly believe would be the best for you, would be the 21.5&quot; iMac, with 8GB and a $499 iPad. </s>
<s> That way you can do all of your editing, etc., on your all-in-one desktop, and then show everything off on your iPad. </s>
<s> Definitely, in my opinion, the best way to go for you. </s>
<s> If you haven't tried an iPad, please try one before you make a decision. </s>
<s> Brian, This is a no brainer: get a MacBook Pro. </s>
<s> You can either buy a 13&quot; display one and buy an external HD monitor, all well within your budget. </s>
<s> A 17&quot; one is not bad either but it is at $2200, somewhat over your specified amount. </s>
<s> Oh yes, I forget: get a Mac and then be happy for the rest of youf life. </s>
<s> Antonio </s>
<s> Buy a name brand and an extended warrantee </s>
<s> Before you make a purchase for the long term, perhaps consider these things: Laptop (Notebook) computers DO overheat *IF* the ventilation fails, gets clogged, etc. </s>
<s> To disassemble and blow the dust from a laptop computer can be difficult and/or expensive. </s>
<s> A desktop computer is simple......remove 1 cover, vacuum and/or blow out the dust, and put it back together. </s>
<s> Laptop computer batteries eventually die. </s>
<s> In some cases a suitable replacement battery can not be found when you need it. </s>
<s> Similarly, the small power converter (AC to DC) that most portable computers use can also die, and sometimes the connector that goes into the computer breaks. </s>
<s> It can be very expensive to repair. </s>
<s> The power converters go obsolete and can be difficult or impossible to replace. </s>
<s> Portable computers suffer from internal file storage failure more often than desktop computers. </s>
<s> I base that statement on the number of each that come into the shop every week. </s>
<s> The failures of portable computers outnumber the desktop computer failures by at least 10 to 1. </s>
<s> Because the internal disk can fail, ALWAYS MAKE BACKUPS! </s>
<s> For your digital imaging storage, back up the files to CD/DVD and/or at least 2 external storage devices. </s>
<s> So even if your computer suffers complete failure, your image files will not be lost. </s>
<s> Good luck with your purchase. </s>
<s> While I'd love to give you The best computer advice ever, I'm probably not the best qualified. </s>
<s> I would like to say that I hope this won't really be your last computer. </s>
<s> You could easily live decade(s) longer, and no computer - however advanced - will be good that far out. </s>
<s> Your brain will thank you for your mental activity as you advance in years too. </s>
<s> I would certainly not get a Mac, if this is your last computer. </s>
<s> Reason being that they are harder and more limited to upgrade. </s>
<s> Longevity will always be best in a desktop. </s>
<s> I would go with an intel core processor since you don't mention any 3d gaming or anything. </s>
<s> A moderate video card would help you out with photo and video. </s>
<s> Of course, a 64-bit computer with 4, 6, or even more ddr3 ram will be benificial. </s>
<s> When choosing the specific processor, get the best you can afford and consider whether or not your software applications support threading and how much. </s>
<s> And if you will be upgrading this software. </s>
<s> Listen to common sense here, and expect a long life... One that will certainly outlive your next computer. </s>
<s> 25 years ago I helped my Dad buy his &quot;last computer.&quot; He just turned 92 and celebrated by buying another one. </s>
<s> There are two cardinal rules in buying a computer. </s>
<s> Rule 1: The day you buy it it will be obsolete because of the daily technical advances. </s>
<s> Rule 2: Even if you buy a powerful machine, software programmers will work very hard to make you need more RAM, chip speed or a larger hard drive. </s>
<s> You are correct in your concern about laptop cooling, though multi-core processors do seem to run cooler. </s>
<s> You can buy a cooling pad to help. </s>
<s> (Or, as my son the computer engineer does, keep some large books in the freezer on which to set the laptop.) </s>
<s> Most cooling pads run on AC or USB, so you have some portability when away from an electrical outlet. </s>
<s> The biggest problem with a laptop is you have limited expansion options. </s>
<s> Since you don't like wires, you'll not care for the external hard drive you'll probably need for your photography. </s>
<s> Also, since we're the same age, I imagine you'll wan a large monitor to supplement you laptop screen. </s>
<s> When I bought my last computer, I went through the same dilemma. </s>
<s> I did not seriously consider an all-in-one because of the limited expansion, though I was intrigued by the laptop configuration with a detachable screen. </s>
<s> Instead, with the price of decent machines being so reasonable, I opted for a desktop as my primary machine along with a laptop to take with me when traveling. </s>
<s> The modern processors are quad core and I'd opt for that, as well a 4GB of DDR3 RAM. </s>
<s> (Hopefully the machine has expansion slots should you need more.) </s>
<s> I bought a reasonably basic desktop that had open bays and room for expansion. </s>
<s> To this I added a second hard drive and a better video card. </s>
<s> My best investment was to upgrade to a 24 inch LCD monitor that's easier on my aged eyes. </s>
<s> I didn't throw away my old 21&quot; monitor, but installed it as a second display. </s>
<s> Sharing your love of wiring, I also installed a PCI wireless card that, through my wireless router, gives me access to both the internet and my printer. </s>
<s> The wireless card also gives me access, though a home LAN, to the laptop. </s>
<s> That way I can transfer files from the laptop to my large desktop hard drive. </s>
<s> When I'm traveling, There are several programs available to access my home computer from the laptop to transfer files, but I generally use a USB memory stick or online storage to keep my laptop storage at a reasonable level. </s>
<s> (My son uses a 2.5 inch portable hard drive that runs with USB power to back up his laptop files.) </s>
<s> Conclusion: You can go, as I did, with two separate machines. </s>
<s> (I got a discount buying them from the same company.) </s>
<s> ...Or, if you want a single machine, I'd stick with the desktop and expand it with wireless, more hard drive and a really good monitor. </s>
<s> I'm 72 and facing the same questions. </s>
<s> I'm looking at the HP Touchscreen 23&quot; with the &quot;works&quot; all built into the screen unit. </s>
<s> Terrific Idea! </s>
<s> Touchscreen offers access to info, entertainment and social networks. </s>
<s> From the HP website: &quot;With an HP TouchSmart 600-1050, you can zoom in or out on your photos and videos, plus edit them with the touch of a finger. </s>
<s> Enjoy DVDs on a large, high-definition display in clear, crisp sound, and video chat using the integrated webcam and microphone&quot;. </s>
<s> And that pretty well describes it. </s>
<s> I saw it demonstrated on a shopping network here in the US and know it will handle all my photos now and for as long as I can still click the shutter. </s>
<s> We have two HP laptops in the family now and I am only going to wait to see what Christmas deals are offered before I make my final decision. </s>
<s> Good Luck. </s>

<s> Hello Brian, You present a good question for many people in your situation. </s>
<s> I've been working with computers for 34 years and still do consulting. </s>
<s> There are two things to consider when buying the computer. </s>
<s> One is: am I going to travel and what size screen do I need. </s>
<s> The laptops on the market now have a good life span. </s>
<s> You may need to replace the battery before replacing the machine. </s>
<s> You can get both at a good price (watch for sales) and brands. </s>
<s> After 30 years I found that both Emachine and Gateway are poor quality in both forms. </s>
<s> Stay with a brand name like HP, Compaq, Dell etc. </s>
<s> Laptop screen sizes go to 17&quot; but with the desk top you can go way up. </s>
<s> I'm 58 and I find that my 22 in works great for me. </s>
<s> Everyone is different when buy computers, its your preference but I get paid to consult. </s>
<s> Happy hunting. </s>
<s> Brian, I recently retired and after using PC's for years, switched to MacBook Pro. </s>
<s> After 1-1/2 years, I am still convinced this is the best for me. </s>
<s> I have lot's of digital pictures and love to edit. </s>
<s> I also dabble in video editing. </s>
<s> iPhoto and iMovie, which come the standard load on the MacBook Pro, are very easy to use and offer power to handle most editing and video development, plus make slideshows a breeze. </s>
<s> They couple very well with iTunes. </s>
<s> I am previous user of Adobe Photoshop (full version) and Adobe Premiere (full version), but have not had much reason to use them on the Mac, since iPhoto and iMovie handle most of my needs. </s>
<s> However, both Adobe products are available for the Apple Mac. </s>
<s> Apple support is the best. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Paul </s>
<s> I forgot to mention that you should stay away from the Mac's (apple) The tech support is terrible and also those machines are way over priced. </s>
<s> Currently I have an old 2003 Windows XP3 desktop, 1.6 ghz processor (slow) with an 80 g hardrive (external hardrive of 80 G).My free space is limited to 27 gb (is this a function of OS or clutter on HD?) </s>
<s> Also an amateur yet avid photographer strong on photo editing. </s>
<s> Not retiring yet, but at 55 I'm not as computer savvy with all the new terms. </s>
<s> I am confused over the &quot;all in one&quot; vs stand alone desktops,laptops and Windows vs Mac. </s>
<s> I am also overwhelmed with terms:dual processors, Intel i3 vs Intel i7. </s>
<s> Is Windows 7 a better alternative, on a desktop version (portability not important). </s>
<s> My concern with all in one desktops and laptops is upgrading...how do you upgrade an iMac, without more expensive add ons. </s>
<s> I have upgraded my current desktop by physicall installing more RAM, Hard drive. </s>
<s> My budget is lower, ie...$700.00 because I wish to upgrade my camera (digital to SLR). </s>
<s> However... </s>
<s> I love the iMac with it's larger monitor...ease of use, but can I endure the transition from Windows to Mac? </s>
<s> If a Mac is so much better, then why is it double the price of Windows 7? </s>
<s> (Authorized retailer says it is because of the superior quality...is it actually superior? </s>
<s> and is Windows 7 a real benefit over XP)? </s>
<s> I do know that I want at least 4 G Ram and and at least 2 g HD. </s>
<s> I will follow this thread with interest. </s>
<s> I'd get an iMac--get the fastest 27&quot; that fits your budget. </s>
<s> It's great for photographs and if you get a laptop, you'll want a big screen to work on. </s>
<s> If you travel a lot, then go ahead and go with a Macbook. </s>
<s> You can then add the keyboard and monitor that stays put. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> If you are secure in your manhood, blow your $2000 on a 11&quot; or 13&quot; screen on a Macbook AKA Apple when we were young, and a bunch more $$ on software. </s>
<s> I'm 60 years old, and I need the biggest screen on a laptop because I'm going 'blinder' each year. </s>
<s> I would buy a Dell 17&quot; screen unless you can swing a bigger screen, an Intel I-core 5 at the 2.2 Mhz range. </s>
<s> Buy 4 gigs memory minimum. </s>
<s> If you are not doing video editing, you don't need the 1 gig video card. </s>
<s> Get the photoshop software, and you will still be on budget. </s>
<s> I just bought the I-core 3 @ 2.26 Mhz. </s>
<s> I think that processor could last 12 years at 15.6&quot; screen is too small for video editing. </s>

<s> Hi Brian, Your question brings up some interesting issues about buying your &quot;Last Computer&quot;. </s>
<s> Your conundrum is challenging but I think the answer is not too difficult. </s>
<s> I agree with your assessment of the &quot;All in One&quot; desktop replacements. </s>
<s> The biggest difficulty with them is getting them serviced, and if and when you do need service, you lose your entire computing capability until they fix it. </s>
<s> They are also not upgradable with regard to RAM or Graphics capabilities. </s>
<s> I don't recommend them. </s>
<s> Unless you have a specific need to be mobile with your computer, I wouldn't recommend a laptop either. </s>
<s> There are a number of laptops out there in your price range, but you may be disappointed at the Graphics handling capabilities of even the Higher End models. </s>
<s> It's been my experience with &quot;High End&quot; laptop repair that the first thing to go is the $350 video card. </s>
<s> And you'll need a well trained repairman like me to fix it and I'm not cheap either. </s>
<s> On the other hand, I think you can easily find a well equipped desktop that will fulfill your needs in full measure and within your budget. </s>
<s> If you shop carefully you should be able to find a vendor who will fill a nice Lion Li case with an Intel I7 motherboard and CPU like the Intel I7-875K, about 8GB of Memory, a GTX470 Graphics Card (Very nice for the Video Editing), and a 750W Power Supply. </s>
<s> Top it off with a 1TB HDD and Windows 7 Pro and your almost there. </s>
<s> I understand your aversion to the wires everywhere problem. </s>
<s> I'd recommend you look at some of the new high end wireless Keyboard/Mouse options. </s>
<s> Logitech makes the MX550 Revolution, which is a slick wireless setup good for about 30' from your computer. </s>
<s> Throw in a 24&quot; monitor and a wireless N card and you'll have about used up your $2,000 budget. </s>
<s> The only wires you'll have to deal with are a power cord and HDMI cord from your monitor to your PC. </s>
<s> Everything else will be wireless. </s>
<s> Of course there are many options available out there for you. </s>
<s> As you examine them remember these important Tips: 1. </s>
<s> Will the system meet my needs for video editing? </s>
<s> You'll need powerful graphics and RAM to fit this requirement. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> If something stops working (Display, power supply, motherboard, etc.) </s>
<s> how long will I be without my computer? </s>
<s> and How much does that matter? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Since this is your &quot;Last Computer&quot;, is it going to meet your needs for now, and in the Future? </s>
<s> Remember that RAM, CPU's, Displays, and Video Cards are much more easily upgraded in a Desktop than an All in One or a Laptop. </s>
<s> I wish you well in your quest for choosing the &quot;Last Computer&quot; you'll ever buy. </s>
<s> I'm sure this forum will have plenty of info for you to think about, and I hope this has helped you in your thought process. </s>

<s> Just go to Apple store and try it out or take a look at apple.com. </s>
<s> Based on your budget, i think you can only get the 13' but it's up to you to work out which one make more value to you. </s>
<s> Go to a Mac store and check out and try an iMac with the 27&quot; monitor. </s>
<s> consider the i3 CPU. </s>
<s> Then compare a i7 PC with HD 27-32&quot; monitor with a hot graphics card. </s>
<s> I have used most of the graphics software and each has its +s & -s. If you are already using software you like, stay with it. </s>
<s> I would not invest in a printer, just email or download your pics at Walmart or another store that prints digital photos. </s>

<s> the i3 &gt; i5 &gt;i7 but the I7 is the only one that can turn off an unused core. </s>
<s> My solution, do not put your eggs in 1 computer. </s>
<s> i7's are costly but if you do video rendering / dvd creation or extensive graphics, this will take the bulk of your money, laptops are portable for a reason, they have less processing speed, but you gain portability, a nice $200 net book is small enough, and portable for on the go with an atom processor, you loose the cd drive but great for small applications, displaying photos on the go. </s>
<s> Mac's are fine computers, never the less desktop or laptop you will have to some degree of wires. </s>
<s> you can purchase a laptop cooler which fits under the laptop that blows air, and just uses a usb port. </s>
<s> batteries do die in about 2 years, so make sure you buy 1 or 2 spares. </s>
<s> Also get the manufacturers restore cd for the laptops, will cut down on headaches if the os gets corrupted, well that true with any computer. </s>
<s> The one thing that eventually breaks on a laptop is the power connector gets loose and then does not charge. </s>
<s> This is why I say go with a light portable like a netbook. </s>
<s> Desk top or towers are easy to fix. </s>
<s> Whatever you decide, good luck. </s>
<s> Towers usually have a better life expectancy though. </s>
<s> --------------------- It really ends up depending on how you want to use your computer - in the field, or in the office. </s>
<s> I am a pseudo-professional photographer myself, and I use a laptop to do my editing. </s>
<s> I chose a laptop (technically a notebook) over a desktop because I could take it with me in the field for on-the-fly editing at client's locations. </s>
<s> I use a 13&quot; Macbook with Lightroom 2, Aperture 2, and Photoshop CS4 to do my editing and have not had any issues in the last three years since I bought the notebook. </s>
<s> I also own a PC that I built a few years ago, though it mostly just collects dust since I purchased the Macbook. </s>
<s> I can understand Bryan's problem but my approach is very simple, there's no such a thing as an obsolete Desktop instead there's always a Desktop waiting improvement. </s>
<s> See I have a Desktop that's almost 4 years old and just 2 weeks ago I replaced the old hard drive with 2 terabytes state of the art brand new ones with minimal cost. </s>
<s> The present CPU was changed last year and a new graphic card was also added. </s>
<s> It started life running Vista and runs now on Windows 7. </s>
<s> A lot of the cables have been replaced with wireless connections also. </s>
<s> You can't do all that easily and cheaply with a laptop, so I would say keep your Desktop and have fun bringing your old friend back to life from times to times, just great for retirement, being 68 I can assure you. </s>
<s> Luis </s>
<s> Anything you get is going to seem slow in three or four years time, and plenty of people stay active into their eighties or nineties nowadays, so it could easily have another ten or twenty years of use. </s>
<s> Camera resolutions will go up so pictures will need more memory and more processing time when you upgrade to a new camera. </s>
<s> So whatever you get, count on replacing it again in a few years time. </s>
<s> I got a desktop for my last computer and have regretted it. </s>
<s> Just things like if I had a laptop I could work out of doors in the garden or park or countryside in good weather - but you can't do that with a desktop. </s>
<s> Also when I bought it I thought that I was going to be in one place - but ended up traveling a lot for several months at a time and had to use my old and much slower laptop far more than I expected. </s>
<s> E.g. </s>
<s> if you are ill in hospital, you can take your laptop with you and use it in the hospital (depending on the hospital) but not so easy to take your desktop. </s>
<s> Same applies if you go to visit a friend or relative for some weeks or months, and though one may think that's not going to happen it is surprising how easily situations can change. </s>
<s> You get a desktop thinking you will upgrade it - but in my case anyway I never do. </s>
<s> With a laptop you can get extra RAM which is perhaps the most likely upgrade you are likely to want - or to get extra USB hard drives for extra hard disk space (or because they fail). </s>
<s> Maybe if you have lots of photos I wonder if firewire would help with faster data transfer to disk. </s>
<s> If you are going to use your laptop out of doors or travel - or are just a bit clummsy, be sure to take out the insurance against accident policy. </s>
<s> My laptop got damaged twice, once when I accidentally stood on it with a mouse between the screen and the keyboard, and once when I left it on the seat of a bus and the bus stoopped suddenly and it fell on the ground - one of those was covered but the other wasn't. </s>
<s> As a professional photographer I would highly recommend an Apple iMac 21&quot;. </s>
<s> It is fast, easy to use and will more than cope with all the photographic images and video-editing that you can throw at it! </s>
<s> Clive B </s>
<s> the desk top will be better in the long term for improving the spec as required the cables are not that bad and at least you can alter or renew this is not possible with laptops and compacts,- a tower (at present) will mean you can stay up to date , one component at a time ( cheaper) </s>
<s> Great questions but probably not your last computer. </s>
<s> I am 75 years young and have just completed the same research you describe. </s>
<s> To do your photo and film editing, go Apple. </s>
<s> Option #1. </s>
<s> For under $1500 you can buy a refurbished i3 or i5 intel 27&quot; or a 21.5&quot; for even less and still have money for great Apple photo-video software. </s>
<s> Option #2. </s>
<s> For less than $2000 you can purchase a used Apple from a video-ographer trading up or out with the software installed. </s>
<s> Caution: investigate the hardware and software personally before you buy. </s>
<s> I have long used new and refurbished PC's and one new Apple. </s>
<s> Very satisfied. </s>
<s> I am now taking the advice given above. </s>
<s> HAPPY TRAILS, Jim </s>
<s> Best of luck, Brian, with your retirement plans! </s>
<s> Take a look at the software you are comfortable with for your hobbies. </s>
<s> Does it take full advantage of multi-core processors, does it have a 64 bit version? </s>
<s> If so, that should help you choose. </s>
<s> Not sure &quot;i3&quot; is good enough for your purpose, but certainly better than the previous crop. </s>
<s> Think lots of DDR3 RAM and good hard-drive size too (not a bad idea to partition). </s>
<s> A good graphics card is important too, e.g with 1GB dedicated video memory (Choose less and you'll regret it!). </s>
<s> Apple is too expensive and stay away from the &quot;all-in-one&quot; machine: they seem too &quot;weak&quot; for your purpose. </s>
<s> Things get notoriously more complex with video, esp. </s>
<s> editing and converting (either between formats or to fit on an iPhone, iPad, etc...), and including HD. </s>
<s> Also, choose anti-virus/anti-malware and Firewall programs which are not too greedy (beware those resource hogs and drivers incompatible with too many things). </s>
<s> It also helps when they can be disabled temporarily with one simple click. </s>
<s> This is useful when installing safe/reputable software and when doing heavy or slow tasks (video/sound editing/Burning). </s>
<s> It also helps when the firewall can be used to control and even totally block internet access. </s>
<s> There are very good &quot;free&quot; programs which do the job. </s>
<s> So stay away from those &quot;do-it-all&quot; Internet Security Suites (if you can, get a clean install of your machine without those, esp. </s>
<s> without those annoying 6 months &quot;free&quot; subscriptions which leave all sorts of things behind when you try to un-install them) and then add your own later. </s>
<s> Get them from CNET! </s>
<s> Also, get a good maintenance program to keep your machine free of &quot;junk&quot; files and the likes, as well as pesky programs which start automatically and which are not needed most of the time and slow you down (But stay away from those programs which do too many pseudo-sophisticated deep cleaning/optimizing things and end up destroying your system). </s>
<s> I do quite a bit of video and sound editing, as well as slide-shows with videos and still pictures with multiple soundtracks on an old DELL laptop and solved the heating problem with raising the laptop with little &quot;legs&quot; (you can use rubber pads, like those used under noisy chairs) and a small fan on the side, yet the laptop ventilated pads I tried were all useless. </s>
<s> Sometimes it gets really slow. </s>
<s> And I've learned to stay away from those do-it-all (here too!) </s>
<s> video suite programs which choke the computer (I've tried same on much more powerful machines and the results were slow too)! </s>
<s> Stick to lighter programs! </s>
<s> Bottom line, if you have a good work horse, with plenty memory and processing speed, you can transform it as you please with carefully selected software. </s>
<s> I would probably suggest a PC for now in the $1000 range in the US Market - prices maybe different in Ryadh (not a laptop, yet not flexible enough) and if you really can't resist temptation, an iPad or similar (preferably open-source) device in 3-4 years from now. </s>
<s> Make sure the PC has plenty connections (USB, AV, S-video, at least 2 HDMI, firewire, eSATA, as well as N-wireless and gigabit ethernet). </s>
<s> Some &quot;Slim&quot; PC's are attractive, but seem very light on connections (e.g: no HDMI, too few USB...). </s>
<s> Burn your creations on DVD and use your giant ultra slim TV in your living room! </s>
<s> Beware those devices meant as multi-media boxes to interface computer and TV. </s>
<s> Most of them are still way too quirky (They all have something missing or clumsy or too slow or just plain unreliable...but one day, maybe...meaning, you won't need everything done by the computer, esp. </s>
<s> for conversion). </s>
<s> Hope this helps a bit. </s>
<s> I bought this for less than $1800. </s>
<s> I use Paint Shop Pro for editing photos and also use Print Shop 23. </s>
<s> The monitor made it slightly more than $2200. </s>
<s> (A 25&quot; HP)At our age our eyesight is not getting better. </s>

<s> Regards, Mike F. </s>
<s> My personal opinion is to stay away from the All-In-Ones since their technology is still in it's infancy and, working at Best Buy, I have seen way too many coming back for repairs (especially HP units). </s>
<s> Granted, laptops have a limited life span (7 years is exceptionally good) but one thing that can be done to prolong their life span is to ventilate the bottom area of the computer - using a powered fan arrangement that many laptop coolers provide, or simply elevate the rear of the laptop while powered on with a small block of wood. </s>
<s> Another hint worth remembering is always put the laptop to sleep or turn it off whenever you will be away from it for any amount of time. </s>
<s> I am a firm believer in towers since their logevity and ability to accomodate changing technology is worth the incovenience of wires. </s>
<s> Wire organizers can dress up those wires so they are not as ugly as in their native state. </s>
<s> Changing rotating-platter hard drives with solid state drives is a worthy furure investment. </s>
<s> Addition of graphics cards, and other add-ons and/or modificattions over time are less costly than buying a whole new computer in 4-5 years, and is fiancially more tolerable and practical when one lives on a fixed income. </s>
<s> John W. </s>
<s> While there's little doubt that notebooks can now do pretty much everything that our old desktops use to accomplish, I don't think Apple is the only company worth considering - especially with their prices and lack of what I'd call solid value. </s>
<s> Look at upper end Lenovo's with the 1GB dedicated video cards and the Intel I-7 that you can easily pick up for less than $1,400 complete with 3 year in home warranty. </s>
<s> Lenovo has a very solid reputation for building great stuff that will meet your needs quite well while at the same time saving you a grand or more which is real money. </s>
<s> While there are two different I-7 processors out there, the faster one is usually only ranked at being around 5% faster which just isn't that much difference if you ask me. </s>
<s> If you're a person who enjoys real portability and doesn't like being plugged into the wall all the time, you might just see that an I-5 with a separate video card will give you more than enough speed while at the same time more portability than you've ever enjoyed before. </s>
<s> Just an idea, but as an idiot who purchased two new notebooks this year already for myself, I've learned the hard way that Apple isn't the only option out there for heavy hitter users like you and me. </s>
<s> First of all, keep in mind that you will live to be at leat 100--so this will not be your last computer. </s>
<s> And at the rate technology changes who knows what is in store 10 or 20 years from now, technologically speaking. </s>
<s> You might start by thinking about what kind of configuration will best meet your needs, and would be the easiest to up grade as technology changes--and until you have to get another computer. </s>
<s> Iam retiring too--Jan 1, 2011--and I wish you all the best. </s>
<s> I will be buying another computer for my work when I get done with school. </s>
<s> I am considering getting the computer I want and them buy an external hard drive to store my files to cut down on all my bogging the laptop down. </s>
<s> I currently have an external hard drive and use it faithfully. </s>
<s> Only because I had it and sad down to back up my original laptop for the first time and that computer crashed. </s>
<s> So if you store all your photos on the external drive you should be able to maintain your effectiveness of your laptop. </s>
<s> Also, any laptop I personally recommend the extended service agreement. </s>
<s> I agree with those that suggest NOT spending the money if you can avoid it. </s>
<s> Save the money. </s>
<s> Buy what you need now and plan to upgrade it as needed. </s>
<s> If you'd bought a THz HD five years ago..think where you'd be now. </s>
<s> Remember Andrew Carnegie 1905: &quot;Our new Winton motorcar is almost perfect. </s>
<s> There may be advances in the future, but I can hardly imagine there can be much improvement...&quot;. </s>
<s> I am only an intermediate computer geek, but I bought an all-in-one from HP online two years ago, and I love it. </s>
<s> I have 4Gigs, and TV tuner and I use it as aDVR because I collect cooking shows. </s>
<s> Get the biggest hard drive they offer! </s>
<s> I keep it on a table by my chair where I watch TV, and I never move it because it is heavy. </s>
<s> The touch screen they do lots of bragging about is worthless to me, because the thing is not a lap device. </s>
<s> It is big enough to watch TV on, and it would be the TV I would keep if I had to move into a tiny place. </s>
<s> If I had the money I would have another for the kitchen. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Temperatures in Riyadh are generally north of 30 degrees celsius, commonly 40 and 50 is not unknown. </s>
<s> These kinds of ambient temperature have a significant detrimental effect on the ability of any computer's cooling system to get rid of excess heat and lead to overheating. </s>
<s> Obvious answer- only use in air conditioned indoors, which rather torpedoes the primary advantage of a laptop-portability. </s>
<s> I'm writing this on an ACER travelmate 620 laptop made in march 2003 so laptops (in UK climate)can have decent lifespans but being an ACER, the only way to open this to fit upgrade hardware is with a hammer & chisel! </s>
<s> Other brands are much easier. </s>
<s> With only 1GHz processor speed and 1Gb RAM I can run windows 7 but video editing would be horrendously slow so other posts would be better for this purpose. </s>
<s> There are student deals for Adobe CS5 etc so perhaps signing up for a distance learning course (like the UK Open University) might be a wise way to spend time and money? </s>
<s> Hope this helps and enjoy a long and fruitful retirement! </s>
<s> Brian, I am about to turn 69 years old. </s>
<s> Last year I too wanted to buy that &quot;final computer.&quot; Like you I take a lot of digital pictures and like to video edit. </s>
<s> I bought an iMac computer, 27 inch screen. </s>
<s> It is perfect for my needs. </s>
<s> No unsightly cords strung al over the place. </s>
<s> No tower taking up precious space. </s>
<s> I wanted a computer that was simple to operate and without all the bother of the constant Windows updates and security threats. </s>
<s> I want to spend my time on the computer and not installing updates and worrying about the latest virus threat. </s>
<s> I love my iMAC. </s>
<s> I recommend it highly. </s>
<s> Plus, their support is outstanding. </s>
<s> You actually get somebody who speaks English without an accent and who isn't reading from a script and who wants to help you. </s>
<s> I don't work for them but iMac is the way to go Brian. </s>
<s> Ron Tipton </s>
<s> Good question, however buy asking this it would appear you have already limited yourself. </s>
<s> The game is multi tasking and with a $2000 budget in todays world why not do both. </s>
<s> Laptops today can be big, and powerful,not to mention beautiful,the problem with desktop replacement are size! </s>
<s> Thus the portability factor is lost. </s>
<s> Lets think in more than one dimension. </s>
<s> My advice would be have a great desktop, permanently fixed with high end processing and graphics,which can be easily built for under $500 for your editing. </s>
<s> then say a nice little 15&quot; laptop like a VAIO for poratbility. </s>
<s> You are only limited by your own thought patterns. </s>
<s> So expand your mind and your computing,or DO Not Put All Your Eggs In One Basket. </s>
<s> As far as laptops go get a quality machine from one of the the big guys.6-7 hundred today will buy a nice machine! </s>
<s> Desktop so easy to build or just find someone to build it for you using quality components Ram is a big key here as well as at least a dual core processor or quad even. </s>
<s> Versatility, power, and mobility. </s>
<s> Have it all my friend!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> I have used a 17&quot; Sony laptop without problem for nearly 3 years. </s>
<s> I avoid the heat problem by placing it on an Antec notebook cooler while I use it as a desktop in my house; I don't worry about the heat when I use it as a laptop while traveling. </s>
<s> You will want upgrades down the line: Mr. Williams' advice is on target. </s>
<s> I replace my laptop every 4 years--just because--but I find that within a year of purchase I want to upgrade the RAM because Windows updates quickly make a computer slow as molasses, and usually by the 2nd year after purchase I want to replace the hard drive to one that comes with a 5-year warranty. </s>
<s> Just make sure the computer you buy has a high quality video card. </s>
<s> You will need this for photo and video editing, and it usually does not come on the cheapest of computers. </s>
<s> If you use familiar terminology in your photo and video hobby and apply them to Google search, you should find additional information on the most suitable computer equipment for your specific hobby. </s>
<s> My bet is that you will end up buying a tower computer because you will also end up buying a large monitor to help facilate your hobby even better . </s>
<s> People working with graphics stuff tend to use large monitors as large as 36 inch across or even larger. </s>
<s> I dont know of any laptop a yard wide! </s>
<s> You will also need an oversized hard drive that can store up to 2 terabytes. </s>
<s> Laptops are generally limited to less than one terabyte as well as limited slots for RAM modules. </s>
<s> You will probably end up needing as much RAM as your money can buy. </s>
<s> You might want 16 gb RAM or more. </s>
<s> Search on.. </s>
<s> Hi, Brian... </s>
<s> I was the same way as you were, and found a solution that I think may help... </s>
<s> I got a Sony Vaio All-in-one VGC-LT23E about 3 years ago. </s>
<s> I'm sure they or someone else like HP or Dell make a similar unit today... </s>
<s> Mine is a stand-alone, wide screen, wireless (keyboard & mouse are wireless), WAN ready computer. </s>
<s> The screen is 16:9 format 23 inches wide. </s>
<s> It's fast, attractive, and very capable. </s>
<s> Along with a type N router and a Broadband connection I am able to read and burn cd's/dvd's (newer units can burn blue ray). </s>
<s> It has plenty of memory and storage (over 500GB), and is running a duo-core cpu (new models run 4 and even 6 core cpu's if you need the power). </s>
<s> This unit has never let me down. </s>
<s> Never failed. </s>
<s> Never broken. </s>
<s> I love it! </s>
<s> I do a lot of video and music work, along with MOLP games like WarCraft and EVE. </s>
<s> The display is beautiful for videos and games (the unit came with an nvidia gforce 8400 card (old by now, but great then and it still produces great graphics) I would consider a stand-alone unit (screen & computer all in one unit). </s>
<s> Although you lose out on the portability of the laptop, you gain power, aesthetic pleasure, and satisfaction... </s>
<s> The Mac is indeed interesting. </s>
<s> This is if you are more comfortable with a PC architecture, but some advices also apply for a Mac, like RAM and storage. </s>
<s> First off, you don't need a powerfull videocard, as image and video editing and authoring is essentialy a CPU, RAM and drive thing. </s>
<s> The video only serve to show the result and previews. </s>
<s> Go for a high entry level or low mainstream video card. </s>
<s> BUT! </s>
<s> Stay away from the integrated ones. </s>
<s> That disclass most portables. </s>
<s> You need a good precessor. </s>
<s> You don't need an intel i7, that's for hardcore geeks. </s>
<s> An i3 or maybe i5 should be enough. </s>
<s> An AMD is also a good choice. </s>

<s> I disagree with the &quot;hot graphics card&quot;. </s>
<s> A &quot;hot graphics card&quot; is only realy usefull if you are to play &quot;hot&quot; games that are very intensive and high details, with most settings in the upper range and want over 100 FPS. </s>
<s> In January, 2008, the internal hard drive on my circa 2003 Compaq Presario (XP) laptop had a hard drive head crash.. at the time, I was writing articles and reviews and Editing the work of others for a site I will not name.. after trying everything possible to restore it from a full Acronis True Image backup I had on an external LaCie 300 gb drive, (I not only had a full backup of the entire C: drive, but all of my individual files (docs, texts, photos, music, and other data files backed up into folders on the external drive).. everything I tried to bring it back to life failed.. the Compaq's internal drive wouldn't even format!.. </s>
<s> it was a 15.4&quot;, $1000.00 machine when I originally bought it at Fry's.. the warranty had long-since expired.. it only had a 30 gb internal drive, which was standard for a laptop of that class back then.. </s>
<s> I had to have a new, working computer within a day.. </s>
<s> I did not have the luxury of time for comparison shopping.. </s>
<s> I looked around online, looked for laptops on sale, decided my price limit was about $600.00, and bought an Acer Aspire 5520 (Winblows Vista, dual core AMD Turion 64, 15.4&quot; screen, 160 gb internal hard drive (the standard size at the time), 2 gb RAM, NVidia GForce 7000m Graphics chip, four USB ports.. the usual specs for a mid-priced laptop two and a half years ago).. </s>
<s> I ordered and paid for it over the phone with a nationwide chain who is now out-of-business (CC), drove to the store a mile away, and picked it up, brought it home, and migrated my data files over to it from the LaCie external.. obviously, I did not want to restore the XP laptop's full C: system drive to it, which would have over-written Vista with XP, and I used Outlook Express (or &quot;Excess&quot;) for email, which morphed into &quot;Windoze Mail&quot; on Vista.. basically the same program with some features changed, but its mail &quot;.dbx&quot; databases could be imported into Windoze Mail in Vista.. </s>
<s> The first thing I noticed with the new Acer was that its touchpad driver was insane.. NO change in settings would make it behave properly.. swiping my finger across it caused it to select whatever the mouse pointer was on.. </s>
<s> I phoned Acer.. they pointed me to a different touchpad driver on their site.. </s>
<s> I downloaded and installed it.. it was just as bad. </s>
<s> I turned off the touchpad with a function key, and switched to using a Bluetooth Logitech Cordless Presenter a friend had given me, as a mouse. </s>
<s> That solved that problem.. </s>
<s> I had to re-download and re-install a lot of commercial and shareware programs to the new machine, and after x days I finally was back in business.. </s>
<s> I put the croaked XP laptop in the corner of the room, figuring that at some future date, I could replace its internal hard drive, and restore its C: (system) drive and OS from the Acronis backup on my external LaCie drive, since Acronis lets you make an emergency boot CD with its own OS and the Acronis program on it to do that job.. (I DID do that about a year later.. bought a Seagate 160 gb internal laptop drive from a respected online vendor, and brought the XP machine back to life, and it now lives in my bedroom, connected to my router with a LAN cable).. </s>
<s> So everything hummed along nicely with the Acer until a few months ago when suddenly, I had a screen full of fuzzy, black and white diagonal bars.. </s>
<s> I had no idea what was going on, but I had to power it off and back on.. this started happening more frequently, and randomly, and I couldn't associate it with anything in particular.. </s>
<s> The Acer was 2 1/2 years old.. </s>
<s> I spend DAYS pouring through various Windoze forums online, using search terms like &quot;Acer overheating&quot; and such.. </s>
<s> There were many suggestions by both &quot;experts&quot; and just plain folks as to what the cause of the problem might be, and after consulting with two friends, both of whom can tear a computer apart and put it back together like a Marine can with his rifle, what I found out was that a few years ago, computer mfrs. </s>
<s> were forced, by law, to build their machines with lead-tin core solder (I forget the exact proportion), instead of good old lead-core solder.. </s>
<s> This is because of a law passed in Europe, because so many failed computers were being thrown away, they'd end up in landfills, the lead would leech out of the solder on the motherboard, and contaminate the water table.. </s>
<s> The computer mfrs. </s>
<s> did not want to make two versions of their laptops - one for Europe using lead/tin solder, and one for the USA using good old lead-core solder, so they switched to making ALL their computers (in China, of course), with this newer lead/tin solder.. </s>
<s> The problem is, after a couple of years, this newer solder tends to develope tiny cracks, and sprout microscopic &quot;whiskers&quot; from the heat inside a laptop that is under heavy use, and left on 24 hours a day.. it doesn't have enough internal cooling.. </s>
<s> This Acer only has ONE fan. </s>
<s> Its CPU and GPU (graphics chips) do not have micro-fans on them, only Aluminum heat sinks.. </s>
<s> Earlier, I had upped it from 2gb to 4gb of RAM, but 32-bit Vista Home Premium only sees 3gb, even with 4gb (two 2gb sticks) installed.. this required removing a HUGE plastic panel on the laptop's belly to get at the RAM slots.. </s>
<s> So when it started going into screen-garbage mode, requiring a reboot, I found a freeware program called &quot;CoreTemp&quot; and installed it.. it displays the temperature of each core of a dual-core CPU, and the percentage of &quot;load&quot; on the CPU.. </s>
<s> The Acer was running up to temperatures of 200f (!!) </s>
<s> and its thermal sensor was shutting down the computer to protect it from frying itself.. More searching.. more reading.. </s>
<s> I finally found someone who had the answer, and there were three ways to get around this over-heating problem:: - buy a whole new populated motherboard from Acer, which would cost more than the 2 1/2 year-old computer was worth, take the whole thing apart and install it, but it would still have the same, inferior lead/tin solder.. - give up on it entirely, and buy another new laptop.. these days, what $600.00 bought in January, 2008, you can get for about $400.00, with better specs, but in the interim, I had lost my writing gig, and simply couldn't afford to do that.. - Go into Vista's &quot;power plans / advanced settings&quot;, and create a new &quot;balanced&quot; power plan by lowering the CPU's speed from 100% (full speed), to 40%.. this is what I did, and it worked as a semi-permanent, stop-gap measure, and (so far) has saved me the expense of buying another new laptop.. although the computer runs a bit slower, CoreTemp shows it running between 100f and 120f.. </s>
<s> I still have a LOT of programs running all the time, but instead of leaving the Acer &quot;on&quot; 24 hours a day, I put it into sleep mode when I retire at night, and use the XP laptop (which I brought back to life with a new hard drive), bedside.. One of my engineer friends explained this lead/tin solder situation to me, and he said that because of this inferior solder all computer mfrs. </s>
<s> are forced, by law, to use, that after a couple of years of heavy use and high internal temperatures, and the solder starts developing micro-cracks and whiskers, some of the chips on the motherboard actually rise up off the motherboard, because they are soldered to it with HUNDREDS of solder points.. the computer's thermal sensor says &quot;Eek! </s>
<s> What the!? </s>
<s> Too hot!!&quot;.. </s>
<s> and shuts the machine off.. </s>
<s> Even if I had bought a one-year extended warranty in January, 2008, it would have expired half a year ago anyway, before this solder break-down problem started.. </s>
<s> It had NOTHING to do with the battery.. before I discovered the CPU power plan trick, I tried running the machine off AC, with the battery OUT.. it made absolutely no difference.. the battery is fine and doesn't even get warm to the touch, and still holds a full charge.. </s>
<s> I even bought a USB-powered, three-fan laptop cooling pad (dirt cheap), put it under the laptop, and despite it elevating the laptop a bit, and sucking hot air from its bottom and blowing it out all four sides, CoreTemp indicated the cheap cooling pad didnt lower the laptop's internal temperature by more than a degree or two.. </s>
<s> I even took that huge plastic panel off the bottom of the Acer.. it was as clean as a whistle inside.. NONE of its air intake or exhaust vents were blocked by dust, furrballs, hair, dead rats, or anything else, but I gave everything a good going over with both a can of Dust-Off AND the nozzle of a vacuum cleaner, just for the halibut.. You have the luxury of some time to shop around, but if you decide on a new laptop, make SURE it has sufficient internal cooling.. Acer simply did not equip this model with enough internal fans.. ONE fan was not enough.. the CPU and GPU should have had their own microfans on them, not just aluminum heat sinks.. My MUCH older XP laptop is on 24 hours a day, and it was built with the older lead-core solder, and ha NEVER over-heated.. NEVER shut itself off.. not once.. </s>
<s> I don't use it as my main &quot;living room&quot; machine, since it only has a single-core processor, two USB 1.0 ports, and 512mb of RAM, but it DOES have a MUCH more powerful fan in it than the much newer Acer does, and I run just as many programs simultaneously on it as I do on the Acer.. </s>
<s> I would NEVER buy another Acer computer, and due to lack of income, I'm not currently in a position to replace this one, nor to have a whole new motherboard installed in it.. </s>
<s> It has a ton of USB devices connected to it, including a new Seagate 1 tb external drive I bought a couple of months ago.. Parenthetically, I have an elderly College Professor friend who just paid nearly $1800.00 for a brand new iMac 21&quot; all-in-one, plus &quot;Apple Care&quot;, which came with a (too small) Bluetooth wireless keyboard (which is actually smaller than a full-sized keyboard, and I found it impossible to touch type on the thing, due to the size of the keys).. and Apple's &quot;Magic Mouse&quot;.. </s>
<s> I was at his house last week and played with the thing for a few hours.. Apple makes very pretty stuff, and I understand the whole &quot;cult of Apple&quot; thing, but their stuff is expensive.. he switched from an old Windoze XP tower to the iMac and is totally lost in that new environment.. a friend of his also talked him into buying an iPod Nano (the final &quot;wheel&quot; model).. and he doesn't even have a clue how to get music onto it, much less even rip CDs, so I'll probably visit him again and run him through how it all works.. </s>
<s> But I digress.. sorry.. </s>
<s> The point I'm trying to make, and I apologize for the length of this posting, is that if you intend to buy a laptop, and use it heavily, make SURE it has sufficient internal cooling if you're going to keep it on all the time.. ALL newer computers are made with this inferior lead/tin solder on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Desktop or &quot;tower&quot; machines are MUCH easier to expand, and have MUCH beefier internal cooling than most laptops have.. Also, beware of computer reviews written by writers who did not shell out their own money for the machine.. especially, if the mfr. </s>
<s> of that machine is one of their site's or magazine's advertisers.. the reasons should be obvious.. if not, many reviewers are afraid of offending their advertisers by giving that advertiser's hardware a thumbs-down review, to the point that they might lose advertising revenue.. </s>
<s> The chore of shopping for, comparing, and buying a new computer has become a hundred times more complicated than it was, oh, ten years ago.. the choices are endless and confusing, and there are as many opinions as people who spout them.. </s>
<s> So that's my story, and my experience. </s>
<s> I paid hard-earned money for this $600.00 Acer in January, 2008, and two and half years later, it developed thermal problems due to insufficent cooling, and poor design.. Of course, when it was brand new, ALL of this model were brand new, and the fact that it would start over-heating after two years was not known then. </s>
<s> Google around for &quot;laptop overheating&quot; and you will find thousands of postings all over the place, by people suffering from the same problem, the root cause of which is poor design, and the mandated use of lead/tin core solder, which breaks down after a couple years of insufficient internal cooling (bad design, weak / not enough fans), and higher and higher speed chips which generate more heat than the under-engineered machine can handle.. My apologies for rambling.. my intent was to inform, not to confuse.. Best Wishes.. Harv </s>
<s> Desktop price range: $500-1000 Case: All-in-one will save money but internal components usually can't be added or changed. </s>
<s> CPU: Fastest AMD or Intel available in the price range. </s>
<s> Manufacturer doesn't really matter. </s>
<s> Other: USB 3.0 RAM: 3+ GB HD: 300+ GB internal drive. </s>
<s> With USB 3.0, you can add as many 1+ TB external HDs as you need when you need them for less than $150 each. </s>
<s> I'd recommend getting at least one external HD so you can backup your entire desktop. </s>
<s> Graphics: Today's integrated graphics are great except for heavy animation so that's probably good enough for you. </s>
<s> Very nice add-on graphic cards cost less than $200 but require a full size desktop or tower case, which would increase the base cost. </s>
<s> OS: *DO NOT* buy a system that comes with Windows 7 Starter or Home Basic editions, get at least the Home Premium edition. </s>
<s> However, Home Premium doesn't include built-in backup/restore, Windows XP emulation or hard drive encryption. </s>
<s> The Professional edition adds backup/restore functionality (e.g., to your external USB 3.0 HDs) and Windows XP emulation. </s>
<s> The Ultimate edition adds hard drive encryption. </s>
<s> You can buy on-line upgrades from any Windows 7 version to a higher version at any time, e.g., from Home Premium to Professional or Ultimate. </s>
<s> If you are already eligible for Windows 7 upgrade pricing, you might as well go all the way to Ultimate, since its upgrade price ($219) is only $20 more than Professional ($199). </s>
<s> Graphics software: For images only, get Adobe Photoshop Elements for $90. </s>
<s> For images and video, get the Adobe Photoshop/Premier Elements package for $135. </s>
<s> Both prices are from Amazon. </s>
<s> Monitor: At least 20&quot;, LCD, wide screen, 1600x900 resolution, 5 ms or less refresh, 10000:1 or higher contrast ratio. </s>
<s> Some monitors can rotate between landscape and portrait orientation although that adds cost. </s>
<s> Cost starts around $125. </s>
<s> I highly recommend comparing physical monitors before buying since monitor performance doesn't always match the specs. </s>
<s> DON'T forget to buy an anti-malware application (Norton, McAfee, Trend) for as little as $20. </s>
<s> These may be available for free through your internet service provider. </s>

<s> We just finished having our hottest season on record. </s>
<s> Anyway, since you mentioned graphics and video editing, I would highly suggest getting a Mac all-in-one. </s>
<s> I've had mine for 4 years and only had one problem that I actually had to call support for - and unfortunately, it was a problem w/ iPhoto. </s>
<s> But you don't have to use iPhoto, you can choose whatever application you'd like to use and probably one that you are familiar with. </s>
<s> I have just heard a few negatives about iPhoto enough for me not to mess with it too much (it's not my default photo download app anymore). </s>
<s> The best things I like about the desktop Mac is that it is an all-in, so you don't have that many wires running all around the place - in fact, it's easy to set up many of your peripherals to be wireless. </s>
<s> Another is that I don't get don't bombarded with high priority update notices every time I open my screen. </s>
<s> Junk mail is kept to a bare minimum without me having to do much and although I have to pay a yearly subscription for MobileMe, i find it worth it. </s>
<s> In closing, I have to mention that I have had my Mac desktop AIO for 4 years now and it is as fast as it was the day I got it. </s>
<s> Oh, and memory upgrades are relatively cheap and easy. </s>
<s> In other words, I am in love! </s>
<s> Good luck, Patrick ps. </s>

<s> If you go with a Mac, and you want to get your pics at Wal-Mart, or other 3rd party, you just may have to change your file format from pre-installed default (I forget what it was) to something like a .jpg or .jpeg - easy to do, but necessary if you want to see your pics from the disc. </s>
<s> Just sayin'! </s>
<s> Dear Brian, I hesitated to tell you to get a macbook pro because you're probably a windows guy until I saw so many other people doing the same thing. </s>
<s> I'm 63, the yearbook advisor to my high school, and spend half of my computer life in photoshop processing photos I also take with high end equipment. </s>
<s> If you really want a computer that will last, your safest bet is a mac and you won't have to worry about viruses, trojans, and repairs. </s>
<s> I'm writing this on a 17&quot; macbook pro that is 3 years old and it works like new. </s>
<s> I don't know how your vision is, but I wear tri-focals. </s>
<s> An eye doctor once told me that laptops are better for older people who wear bifocals because it is easier to position the laptop so you can look down through the lower part of the glasses. </s>
<s> I also have a mac tower but I hardly ever use it because the laptop is so much more comfortable. </s>
<s> Since I don't think 69 is that old I'm not sure any computer you get will be your &quot;last&quot; one, but I think you probably could get 8-10 good years out of a mac doing low end things (writing letters, surfing the web) and 5 years processing photos and video before you'll probably want something faster, although the computer will still work. </s>
<s> I'm not saying macs are perfect, but there is a lot less chance you'll have issues. </s>
<s> I am 80 years old, living on a fixed pension. </s>
<s> At 69 you will, with good luck, buy more of everything. </s>
<s> I cannot give you technical help, but I urge you to drop the &quot;my final computer&quot; thinking. </s>
<s> Submitted by Paul F. </s>
<s> This is actually a simple question: Do you need portability or not? </s>
<s> A laptop costs more for the equivalent power, and the latest Consumer's Reports clearly shows that all laptops (including Mac)have a greater failure rate than desktops. </s>
<s> Stuffing advanced computing equipment into a tiny hot box that gets bumped around from place to place is just not compatible with reliability. </s>
<s> And repairs will be expensive due to the specially designed small-scale parts. </s>
<s> However, if you compute/watch Netflix/email/etc. </s>
<s> from multiple locations, you may as well get a laptop and suffer along with the millions of others who made the same compromise. </s>
<s> Just make it knowingly. </s>
<s> An All-in-one is similar to a laptop, except for the bumping around from place to place. </s>
<s> A desktop is the way to go if you don't need portability. </s>
<s> Still do your research to find a reliable one; there are differences in quality, but the failure rate of the cheaper desktops was better than the rating for the better laptops. </s>
<s> I have been in the computer industry for over 25 years and have owned multiple computer related business along with working for a &quot;Leading&quot; manufacturer. </s>
<s> Since I'm offering my personal opinions I wont mention any company names. </s>
<s> Todays selection is truly great. </s>
<s> The price vs. performance is outstanding. </s>
<s> Since you mentioned graphics and video editing I will start off by saying a multi core processor is exactly what you need along with a large amount of memory. </s>
<s> My recommendation is to look at HP commercial grade products (called eliteBook workstations) based on my experience with all the major OEM's, I find HP is the most tested commercial grade computer in the industry. </s>
<s> I know others will disagree but I get to work will all of them and I personally have two business laptops and 1 desktop, I haven't had any issues with any of them for upto the past 5 years. </s>
<s> Ok, you mention Mobile and desktop - the most powerful unit I own is a Mobile &quot;workstation&quot; class laptop. </s>
<s> It has a high end mobile Gfx engine by Nvidia - has 6 gig or ram and runs a core i5 processor from Intel. </s>
<s> Dont worry about heat - the last two generations of Intel microprocessors are the lowest power consuming, fastest industry processors on the market and there only getting faster and cooler. </s>
<s> The one thing I would recommend you upgrade is the hard drive - the main line of Hard drives spin with a motor, this spinning HD is the major issue with laptops, people pick them up and walk around with them running - NOT a good Idea and can cause total loss of data due to the spinning platters getting damaged by the heads that read and write the data hitting them as they spin. </s>
<s> Get a solid state HD, NO MOVING PARTS, jump out of an airplane if you want and keep on working - That being said, price is a bit higher and the size of HD's may be smaller - that is OK, you dont need a massive HD in the Laptop - a modest 160 gig Solid state (SD)HD will work for you IF! </s>
<s> you also purchase an external Hi capacity HD that plugs into the laptop or the associated docking station, this unit is low coast - in fact I just found this LaCie d2 1 TB - External - Hard Drive by HP for less than $160. </s>
<s> A Tera Byte drive stores over 500 full length movies, thats a lot of room! </s>
<s> The type of laptop I recommend is the HP 8xxx series elite workstation - they run from 1,399 to 1,999 - I would recommend i7 core processor by Intel - your video editing conversion will be significantly shorter and you can get more work done faster. </s>
<s> The two extra cores will make a significant difference in how long it takes to convert HD video into a MPEG, same with converting pictures or modifying them through photoshop. </s>
<s> Oh, and its low power keeps things cool. </s>
<s> I also recommend a Windows 7 Professional 64 bit operating system with 4 to 8 gigs of memory (you can expand up to 16 or even 32 gig later if you want) and of course they offer a SD HD up-to 256gig (but save some money with a 160 instead and buy the external HD for massive storage. </s>
<s> I have owned this model for over a year now and with the features I mentioned love working on it - I can login in less than 60 seconds after hitting the power button, the 64 bit O/S is fast and Windows 7 is very flexible and doesn't give me ANY issues. </s>
<s> the other thing I like is the HDMI port I have on mine - I can plug it into my 55&quot; HD TV and get amazing video playback Good luck </s>
<s> Hello Lee, I'm in the same position as you, I'm in my 70's and about 11/2 years ago I purchased a new Apple Mac-book Pro, 15 inch. </s>
<s> This was to be definitely my last laptop. </s>
<s> Well, about a month ago I lost access to the USB ports. </s>
<s> I returned the machine to the dealer I purchase it from and they informed my I would have to replace the Logic Board, estimate cost $1,500.00 (CAN), I then took it to an Apple store and received the same results. </s>
<s> I have been informed that USB ports on many mobile devices are extremely fragile, whatever that means. </s>
<s> Of course I don't intend paying $1500 to have it repaired. </s>
<s> Now what do I do? </s>
<s> A new Mac book Pro ($2000), A PC laptop of similar specifications ($1000) or maybe one of the latest i Mac's ($2300). </s>
<s> From a technical perspective I'm in favour of the hi-end i Mac, it contains a separate video card with its own processor which is good for Photoshop and video editing. </s>

<s> Most laptops (of any brand) or even the mac Mini will have a decent amount of memory: I recommend at least 4 gig and dual processors to handle your picture processing. </s>
<s> (Aperture 3 works fine for me with this configuration.) </s>
<s> But what I found absolutely necessary and useful is attaching a large display/monitor to your laptop. </s>
<s> This will facilitate the manipulation of your pics when you enhance and post-process. </s>
<s> This way you can carry the laptop wherever you go locally or on trips, but you have the luxury of the large display in the office, thereby negating the need to buy an all-in-one desktop. </s>
<s> I am 79, and started into photography 10 years ago and eventually found this to be my best arrangement. </s>

<s> Jimcur </s>
<s> Well, Brian, congratulations on retirement! </s>
<s> Hope I can provide some assistance. </s>
<s> Your budget is a sizeable one, and in my experience, there is a primary area to invest your money: the processor. </s>
<s> RAM can be upgraded, different programs can be added / deleted, but the processor is forever. </s>
<s> If you are intending to do photo and video editing, I recommend at least an Intel i5 or an AMD Phenom II X4. </s>
<s> Both would be adequate for video / photo work. </s>
<s> As you have stated that you would be working with photo / video editing, a large hard-drive would be desireable (500 GB or larger - preferably larger). </s>
<s> Given those two points, the only laptops which would suit your purpose would be large and rather heavy, making their portability of moderate value. </s>
<s> They would also be rather pricey in comparison to a similarly-equipped desktop or all-in-one, in addition to usually having much smaller hard-drives. </s>
<s> If not a laptop, the then question becomes, desktop or all-in-one? </s>
<s> I'm with you on the debate about wires all over the place - what a mess that can be. </s>
<s> If you are a rather neat, tidy person, the all-in-one would probably be preferable: few wires to connect or set up - just plug it in and begin. </s>
<s> Among the all-in-one manufacturers that I would recommend: Apple (an iMac), Lenovo (IdeaCentre A700 - 40244JU) and Hewlet Packard (200xt or 200t models). </s>
<s> All offer Intel i-series processors (the HP and the iMac offer Intel i5, while the Lenovo offers an Intel i7), large Ram (6 GB +), and large hard-drives of 750 GB or more. </s>
<s> Dedicated graphics are preferable, but not necessary (only the HP offers dedicated graphics as an option). </s>
<s> At this point the question becomes: do you know what software you want to use for your video / photo editing? </s>
<s> Some software will only work on a Windows platform, some will only work on an Apple platform. </s>
<s> If you have not made a decision on this point, you don't need to do so right away. </s>
<s> There is a lot of superb software available for both Mac and Windows for photo / and video editing (though it may take a sizeable portion of your budget to get professional-level software). </s>
<s> The cheapest way to go about buying a computer to do what you want would be to just get a desktop tower, and buy any peripherals you need (like a monitor!). </s>
<s> But if style and space are an issue, the all-in-one is probably more your ticket. </s>

<s> Hello there I actually own a computer consultancy business in the United Kingdom and we do lots of computer call out jobs in London and various parts of the UK. </s>
<s> I would have to say that with your budget you could buy a decent computer system for your needs (desktop computer) for no more than $700 or $800 US. </s>
<s> Be very careful if choosing an all in one PC as if one component fails you will have to have this fixed if the guarantee runs out and this can take time since various parts if they've burnt out have to be ordered and this could takes weeks, not days to fix the problem should your all in one desktop's component(s) fail. </s>
<s> Be very careful when buying a laptop since many of my clients buy laptops and then they use the laptop charger to power up the laptop for hours and hours and hours and in the end they end up damaging the laptop after 2 years since they should really charge up the batter of the laptop and use the laptop independently off the battery. </s>
<s> In other words, if you intend on buying a laptop, make sure you purchase a laptop with at least between 5 to 8 hours of battery life so you can use the laptop for quite a few hours. </s>
<s> Laptops when they we're first introduced on to the computer market we're seen by many as a replacement of a desktop PC, but there are drawbacks to laptops (i.e. </s>
<s> if you buy a laptop and the guarantee has run out then there's a high price to pay when you want to get it fixed). </s>
<s> For example, I've just completed a laptop repair job which involved me stripping down the laptop (HP Pavillion DV6000). </s>
<s> The problem with this laptop was that it started cutting out every few seconds after being turned on. </s>
<s> I had to eliminate several possibilities as to what was causing the fault. </s>
<s> Finally I found what the fault was. </s>
<s> The Nvidia graphics chip started to overheat and the heatsink wasn't keeping the Nvidia chip from over heating so I had to use a cleaning solution (cleaning solution for removing old thermal conducting liquid on both CPU and Graphcs chip) and then afterwards, placing a silver compound over both the Nvida chip and CPU chip and then replacing the heatsink. </s>
<s> Once this was done, the laptop worked like a dream but this was only a tempoary fix as the problem can start all over again after a few months so be very careful when purchasing a laptop. </s>
<s> If cost is a problem then there are some good deals available (desktop) from HP and Dell. </s>
<s> Don't buy HP Laptops though since you will have problems with over heating. </s>
<s> Hp Desktops are good but don't go for a slimline HP go for a Full tower since slimline cases can overheat since there is no room for other fans to cool down the system. </s>
<s> You could also opt for building a PC or getting a friend or family to build you a PC for a fraction of the price your looking to pay and it can also come with an Intel i5 processor. </s>
<s> Brian, I was Fr**s Electronics and spoke with a Lieutenant who was deploying to Afghanistan and wanted to make Documentaries to be sent back home. </s>
<s> For convenience, he wanted a Laptop (easier to transport) that needed to deal with the heat, dust, but needed to process HD video files. </s>
<s> We settled on 3 different machines that he needed to check with manufacturers about support in Afghanistan. </s>
<s> These three were the Panasonic Touchbook, Dell Latitude XFR, or HP Rugged (i3 or i5 based)with as much storage and RAM you can handle. </s>
<s> Remember that your editing programs run in the RAM and your files will be quite large. </s>
<s> We decided on Intel-based since Technical Service will be limited out there (I don't know about how Riyadh is). </s>
<s> Because of the Windows OS, there should a lot of people to help if you run across a problem. </s>
<s> Apple is great, BUT if you crash, break, or otherwise screw up, you might be on your own in Saudi Arabia. </s>
<s> hardly as motherboards and cpu slots keep changing. </s>
<s> Sure you could add more ram down the road but that's about it. </s>
<s> I recommend wait until you can buy a Desktop with USB3 ports. </s>
<s> Laptops are nice but the hard drive will die if you don't get a SSD drive. </s>
<s> Even if your hard drive stays ok odds are your laptop screen or battery will need replaced within 2-3 years. </s>
<s> Desktops are much more reliable. </s>
<s> When I need a computer and want the best deal for the money I go to techforless.com Let's face it times are not getting any easier and the more you can save the better off you are. </s>

<s> This sounds very similar to the problem I described in my post #63 in this thread about how my Acer Aspire 5520 laptop started behaving a few months ago.. first, a screen full of diagonal lines (as if the NVidia GPU had gone nuts).. and then, random shut-downs (the machine powering itself off, releatd to NOTHING I was doing at the time).. </s>
<s> I explained the solution I found.. </s>
<s> I am not a bench tech, and could not possibly perform the cleaning task you did.. </s>
<s> I'm not a total computer idiot, but I don't like messing with internal hardware the way you described.. </s>
<s> I don't have the tools, the materials, the training, or the knowledge to do it.. Could you comment on my remarks about the possible cause I DID learn about (newer mandated-by-law lead/tin-core solder used on the motherboard, as opposed to the older lead-core solder).. and using Vista's Power Plans / Advanced Settings to lower the maximum speed of the CPU from 100% to 40%, which tremendously reduced the internal temperature of the machine, although I'm sure it's slowed down a bit, and I realize it's not the ideal solution, but lack of money prevents me from having someone perform a repair task like you described.. </s>

<s> Please read my entire post #63.. my MUCH older HP laptop has NEVER had over-heating problems, and it's on 24 hours a day.. Should Acer have put a micro-fan on the NVidia 7000m chip and the AMD Turion 64 x2 CPU in this machine, instead of just using heatsinks on them? </s>

<s> Hi Brian, a laptop provides great flexibility and would be my recommendation based upon your fairly high budget. </s>
<s> I have used a few laptops over the years and in the PC world I would not hesitate to highly recommend a Lenovo Laptop. </s>
<s> Lenovo makes very COOL running laptops that you can actually place on your lap without getting hot. </s>
<s> They are also an extremely well built laptop for the money. </s>
<s> For a piece of mind you are likely able to get an extended warranty for that budget as well. </s>
<s> Happy hunting! </s>
<s> I don't think any computer on the market is 'perfect' - but as I previously stated on my post about my laptop - the Toshibe Satellite Media Center Edition, which is actually 5 1/2 years old now, it has everything that Brian is looking for. </s>
<s> I'm disabled, therefore am online quite a bit - and stuck on dial-up, so when I'm online, it's for an eternity. </s>
<s> But, I can also take my pc into town and grab any wireless connection available. </s>
<s> I currently have over 450 pics on my pc at the moment,as where I live there is a lot of wildlife. </s>
<s> I didn't have a clue how to do any touch-ups,make a movie,make slides,etc.-until I got this computer. </s>
<s> It taught me thru the programs on it, and it was very easy. </s>
<s> My previous laptop was an HP, and it burned up. </s>
<s> I also have 2 desktops. </s>
<s> Wouldn't recommend those either. </s>
<s> With a laptop, you have the option of sitting in your favorite chair in front of the tv, or going outside on the deck with it and watching the wildlife around you, or your grandchildren play, etc.. </s>
<s> This computer actually has too much. </s>
<s> More than I will ever use. </s>
<s> That's ok. </s>
<s> It has never had a single problem with it, ever. </s>
<s> Someone posted that the batteries only last 2 years or so? </s>
<s> Funny - mine is 5 1/2 years and going. </s>
<s> And, if you have need of either adding memory, you can double what it originally came with, or you can send some of your photos to a place such as Photobucket.com. </s>

<s> I agree with marklynnwilliams advice, apart from one point. </s>
<s> This point being that macs are better at video editing, I strongly disagree with this... both are equally good at this task... </s>
<s> I work as a web developer, which means I make use extensive use of photos, graphics and video editing software. </s>
<s> I make use of Adobe's Creative Suite 5 (includes Photoshop etc.). </s>
<s> As this is very comprehensive and the best, in my opinion, and is available for mac and windows. </s>
<s> I would suggest purchasing a windows desktop (less fiddling about and easier to fix if something were to go wrong, and cheaper for the same specs), with at least 4gb of ddr3 ram, you will want a small speedy hard drive for running your operating system and a large 1tb or 2tb hard drive, for storing your photos and videos. </s>
<s> A pretty new graphics card is going to last you a long time, specifications wise... </s>
<s> But can be pricey. </s>
<s> Going for a cheaper option here may mean 1 and a 1/2 years down the road that you find it is sluggish when dealing with video editing, especially with updates to technology, (e.g. </s>
<s> higher megapixel cameras etc.)... </s>
<s> next if you want to play / burn your video's / photos to disk, you will need at least a dvd-rw drive, perhaps a blu-ray drive (optional / depends on your requirements). </s>
<s> Processor wise I would go for the one of the cheaper intel I7 processors. </s>
<s> as these are powerful but reasonably priced (don't go for the higher models, as you can overclock the processors easily, most motherboards allow this in bios, or via a taskbar application). </s>
<s> Motherboard wise go for a motherboard which has the option for upgrading your ram, look for max ram of 12gb - 24gb. </s>
<s> A motherboard with these specs will last you a long time as you can upgrade the ram when required. </s>
<s> I suggest something like the Asus P6X58D premium. </s>
<s> this has ddr3 ram support, usb 3 and has all the connections you will ever need, and will no doubt last a long time. </s>
<s> Unfortunately as stated in your title, you want this as your final computer, the problem is the useful life time of a any computer is 5-6 years... As new technologies come into play all the time... there's no avoiding this I'm afraid. </s>
<s> I'm based in the UK, a website like www.pcspecialist.co.uk allows you to build your own pc. </s>
<s> By choosing the parts you want installed inside it and are very reasonably priced, compared to the high street shops. </s>
<s> I saved about ?400 ($637.75), and got exactly what i wanted. </s>
<s> I'm sure there are sites similar to pcspecialist in the states unfortunately I'm unable to recommend any, due to my location. </s>
<s> Like marklynnwilliams I wouldn't spend all the budget on the pc straight away. </s>
<s> I would spend about 2/5 of your budget on the pc itself, another 2/5 on the operating system and software. </s>
<s> With the final fifth spare to spend on upgrading further down the line. </s>

<s> Most of the ones for which I qualified as a class member resulted in some ridiculously insulting payoff, like a $10.00 credit against any purchase of $100.00 or more at some cell phone carrier's store, because the court took however many millions of $ Company X was fined, and then split it up amongst millions of customers.. but I'll follow this thing.. </s>

<s> You don't really need a laptop by what you have stated, however, you must have some consideration for portability for having at least thought it. </s>
<s> So, my recommendation - buy an all-in-one 21.5&quot; (or a discounted 27&quot;) quad core iMac with a target limit of $1500, and you'll be able to do all you want with your photos. </s>
<s> Then, buy a $499 16GB iPad, and you'll be able to really ENJOY them, and show them to your friends. </s>
<s> If you don't want to pay for MobileMe, you can also download Dropbox and sign up for a 2GB account for free. </s>
<s> This is the best advice out of all of them! </s>
<s> Just go to the Apple store (or Best Buy, etc.) </s>
<s> and try this before making a different (bad) decision. </s>
<s> You won't regret it. </s>

<s> One big plus for you would be a big wonderful 27 screen, now I process my pictures zooming in 400% to 800% without any problems, the screen only would be enough reason to buy it. </s>
<s> I got the i7 quad core to carry me through my work load, with 4GB of RAM, the machine is a monster that never complain of work, but I will be pumping the RAM to 12GB, I have the Canon 5D MKII, and I tried opening 20 RAW file at the same time, no problem, heavy process them, no problem. </s>
<s> I am so happy with it and as a photographer, Mac is the number 1 choice. </s>
<s> Another thing regarding the IMac 27inch, it comes with a wonderful wireless magic mouse and a wireless keyboard, the only cable on my desk now is the camera cable to connect to my keyboard's USB port. </s>
<s> All the best with your choice and I wish you a happy retirement, </s>
<s> The only disadvantage of buying a Laptop for you final PC is that at this time they are set up for being good for about 3.5 years. </s>
<s> Really!! </s>

<s> Good Luck&God Bless! </s>

<s> For video and photo editing, get an i5 processor at least. </s>
<s> Go to a i7 if you can. </s>
<s> It will cost more, but the computer will be usable longer. </s>
<s> I have a Dell laptop with a i5, and it boots up and shuts down faster than my dual core AMD tower, which is about 4 years old. </s>
<s> And any task it runs goes faster, with the exception of its slower DVD-rw drive. </s>
<s> First of all, I doubt this will be your last one, especially if you began to enjoy your new PC:) There are many ways to go about this, but if you are looking for video editing with speed, you have to have; 1. </s>
<s> Quad core or above 2. </s>
<s> SSD (night & day difference) 3. </s>

<s> You hit it right on the nail head! </s>
<s> I agree with everything PB has written but I would add one caveat. </s>
<s> I would not suggest relying only on an external hard drive for permanent storage of your data. </s>
<s> External hard drives provide a false sense of security and have a tendency to fail when you need them most - and, in many cases, will take all of your data with them. </s>
<s> It can be very expensive to retrieve your data, if this is even possible. </s>
<s> I know of what I speak....I had to learn the hard way and would like to see that others avoid this expensive lesson! </s>
<s> So, be sure to backup your important data onto DVDs (or CDs, if the files are small). </s>
<s> Incidentally, the Library of Congress Digital Archives recommends replacing DVDs at least every 10 years, so it would be a good idea to make new copies of your DVDs at some point. </s>
<s> They claim that digital media degrades over time, even on DVDs. </s>
<s> This used to be true, but now a lot of processing gets handed off to the graphics card, especially by photo editing software. </s>
<s> Frankly, with that amount of money you could outfit yourself with an acceptable desktop AND a decent laptop. </s>
<s> I suspect you'll find that having a permanent desktop unit in an &quot;OFFICE&quot; for doing various tasks PLUS a mobile unit to cover other parts of the house will come in far more handy than some single killer gaming machine. </s>
<s> Plus (I am assuming you are sharing your home) it will mean that you still have options for taking care of business if your S.O. </s>

<s> I find myself enjoying my 5 year old Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop more than I enjoy my new Dell Inspiron Zino HD. </s>
<s> I wish I had just upgraded to a newer laptop, mainly because of the portability and newer sleek designs available, but was not ready to dump my Inspiron 6000. </s>
<s> Big mistake to replace my Dell Studio Hybrid with the unknown Dell Inspiron Zino HD. </s>
<s> Oh well... perhaps I'll adjust to it. </s>
<s> I've finally figured out a way to deal with it's lack of usb ports, thanks to my monitor having hub ports. </s>
<s> Please just make sure that you like whatever it is you get, and if you don't, then do something about it early. </s>
<s> I waited too long to make up my mind and now can not return my purchase, and instead must adapt to something I am not so sure I like or will like. </s>
<s> Good luck to you. </s>
<s> I hope this is helpful. </s>
<s> Go for the laptop. </s>
<s> Laptops are freedom. </s>
<s> As I write this I'm at a McDonald's so that my daughter can play in the play area, and I'm on my laptop using their free wi-fi. </s>
<s> The freedom to compute anywhere in your home is compelling enough, but being able to compute anywhere you want... vacation, visiting family, McDonalds... you can't put a price on that. </s>
<s> I have two 10year old laptops that continue to work fine. </s>
<s> And that's back in the day of high heat high power consumption days. </s>
<s> I just sold one of them and the other will probably just give to someone in need. </s>
<s> Get yourself a cooling pad, like a Targus ChillPad - and that'll keep your laptop nice and cool. </s>
<s> First class advice in my opinion. </s>
<s> When I retired I decided to attempt to build my own! </s>
<s> It took awhile and a few errors on the way. </s>
<s> But! </s>
<s> with a lot of help from various sources. </s>
<s> I made it. </s>
<s> Hwever my laptop I had to buy! </s>
<s> so I have an allin one Desktop and an APPLE Mac laptop. </s>
<s> your budget is more than enough to start. </s>
<s> Good luck with your future in computing. </s>
<s> My advice is actual on what not to buy. </s>
<s> Acer has some nice looking products out their at reasonable prices,but if you do a little research you will see that their warranty support is little to non. </s>
<s> My advice is stay away from acer at all cost. </s>
<s> I also have an ASUS ...G51JX with a i7 processer. </s>
<s> It's primary use is photo editing. </s>
<s> I bought this instead of building another desktop and saved a bunch of money. </s>
<s> No regrets at all, it handles anything I can throw at it just fine and does not have any over heating issues. </s>
<s> I am typing this message on an All-In-One the only reason I have it is it was purchased from a relative cheap and my desk top computer died. </s>
<s> (which I back up to an external hard drive every second day, more often if it has been busy, and I back up the external drive to disks continually as I had my 1st external drive die it was expensive to retrieve the information,)my desk top had died with a bang so purchased the A-I-O, I have found it cant be upgraded, just as a laptop can't, and it weighs a ton it is much heavier than the old desk computer with tower, the only thing I like about it is the screen, it is a touch screen, as soon as I can go back to a conventional computer it will be a tower but with a touch screen attached to it. </s>
<s> I also have a basic laptop that I use away from home to transfer photos onto and quickly browse to check the quality, before moving to another location. </s>
<s> and I can connect it to our car power via an inverter as when on a trip the battery sometimes runs out before the day is through. </s>
<s> my suggestion Desk top with tower upgradeable plus laptop with inverter for car power if you travel. </s>
<s> at least 1 external hard drive to use on both computers and lots of disks Hope this helps. </s>
<s> You're response to this subject is very misleading. </s>
<s> Many today's laptops are either just as or as near as powerful as their desktop counterparts. </s>
<s> The only real reason to own a desktop is if you're playing the latest games or want to option to upgrade your processor and graphics card later down the road. </s>
<s> You can now buy a Laptop with an Intel Core i7 Processor Running at 2.8Ghz with 4GB of ram, a 500GB hard drive and a graphics chip powerful enough to run almost every current game for around $1200. </s>
<s> Since this person has a budget of $2000 for their computer I would suggest buying the laptop and an external monitor for when using the computer at home. </s>
<s> This will be near as powerful and offer the same productivity for around the same price as a desktop. </s>
<s> I second that motion. </s>
<s> i7 powered laptops are quite formidable, having around double or triple the power of previous gen desktops (Core2 quads) and just slightly less powerful than current gen desktops running same hardware. </s>
<s> On the gaming front, you definitely can play most games at medium to medium high to high settings, depending on the gfx card, and heat control of your system and get pretty decent frame rates. </s>
<s> what exactly about your MBP makes it so much better than a PC based system? </s>
<s> I have both a Toshiba running Win7 64bit and a i7 powered MPB. </s>
<s> The only trouble the pc gives me is that it doesn't have mouse gestures which while using a Mac can very quickly become a habit, the Mac on the other hand, can't do the things I need it to do, (map network drives, change colour, and generally bend to my will). </s>
<s> You can add ram and larger hdds. </s>
<s> Also laptops, are getting USB 3.0 support as well as dual gfx cards, and Tb drives.You hard drive definitely isn't going to die if it isn't a SSD, most laptops now days come with mechanisms that park the read head when the sense any knocks or if the rig gets dropped. </s>
<s> SSD's are also wayy to expensive currently, you can purchase a 500GB hdd for bout $90, the same size ssd is gonna run you round $600 more if you want high performance read/write speeds. </s>
<s> You state your screen or battery will need to be replaced in 2-3 years, I'm currently on a 6 year old Compaq nc6220 all original parts, cept the hdd, needed a bigger drive. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> awwryt.. laptops will definitely become obsolete in a span of 2 to 3 years... they cannot be usually UPGRADED... there screen size is defined...and it is unreasonably expensive.. the only plus point with a lappy wd be it easy to move here and there... nut again chances of it getting stolen is very high.. now.. my favorite DESKTOPS... dude.. its like a tanker.. fill it with everything u have got.. ok .. if i have 2000$ what would i do with it.. first i ll go for a huge CABINET.. here is the link for some companies that manufacture huge cabinets with amazingly huge capacity power supply box:- http://www.google.co.in/images?hl=en&q=cooler+master+cabinets&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=univ&ei=SSS5TNGLEJCGvAOP4-imDQ&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=4&ved=0CDMQsAQwAw&biw=800&bih=509 http://www.indiabroadband.net/desktop-computer/25737-best-desktop-cabinets.html ok after the cabinet i would go for processor... i guess latest is core i 7... just go for the latest processor in the world next comes the mother board.. dude.. do not compromise on this and processor.. http://www.pcworld.com/shopping/browse/category.html?id=10023&tk=pcw_01_SHOP+MOTHERBOARDS+ALL+INTL&utm_source=Google-CPC&utm_medium=INTL&utm_content=Shopping&utm_campaign=SHOP+MOTHERBOARDS&utm_term=SHOP+MOTHERBOARDS+ALL+INTL ok after cabinet, procesor and mother board comes GRAPHIC CARD AND RAM... NVIDIA is the name.. go for any 1 gb dd35 ones or 1 gb dd3 ones... do not go below this... never used ATI or any other... then comes ram... best processor can support upto 40 to 50 gbs of ram(ddr3) (i am not too sure)... so DDR 3 and u can have 2 gb slots * 2 that is 4 gb ddr3... (man i am building a monster pc here) ok after cabinet, mother board, processor , graphic card , ram.. nothing remains actually... actually if u are in some cold country, heating should not be a problem ... but if u come from some 40 degree average place be sure u have an ac in the computer room or u can go for cooler agents... which are very expensive.. if it comes with the cabinet then.. u r in luck!!! </s>
<s> then comes hard drive.. i ll suggest.. do not go for many internal hdd...instead i will go for 1 350 gb hdd internal and i ll take 2 2 TB hdd external... MORE THE INTERNAL HDD CAPACITY, SLOWER THE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE IS... so then we are left with monitor, mouse, speakers, modems, keyboard (buy the heaviest keyboard in town).. contact EBAY for that... u shud get a cheap deal there... thats it my friend... u ll leave something amazingly huge for your fore children .. they will build a sculpture in your name and respect u for generations... i ll work on the price and ll tell u but i am super sure it all should come under 1000 USD ohh i forgot .. about OS.. buy windows 7 or wait untill microsoft launches windows XP fpr free.. XP is the best... actually 98 is but XP is more jazzy </s>
<s> It should be not difficult to make a decision between the laptop and desktop. </s>
<s> Usually you should have at least two PCs, laptop and desktop. </s>
<s> The laptop should be Apple but the desktop can be other brand name unless you do not care the budget. </s>
<s> If you do not want to take your PC go outside, it is unnecessary to buy the laptop but desktop. </s>
<s> However, you should try to get the desktop with a Blu-ray burner or the PC can be installed the Blu-ray burner in the future. </s>
<s> Yes, indeed there are powerful laptops. </s>
<s> I have a Comanche SLi from Kobalt Computers (basically the Clevo D901C), which was GBP 2300, and it's a beast. </s>
<s> It plays pretty much any game you throw at it to a high level BUT you pay quite a premium to have that power in a small box. </s>
<s> A desktop computer will always be somewhat more powerful than a laptop of the same price. </s>
<s> You can't even compare the same components, as an 8800M GTX (for laptops) is not as powerful as a 8800 GTX (for desktops). </s>
<s> Also, from my own experience, a powerful laptop generates a lot of heat and I've already had the motherboard burn out and now one of the graphics cards has died (and still waiting for response for guarantee replacement after 8 months, but that's another story). </s>
<s> The only reason for getting a laptop is mobility. </s>
<s> If you don't need to move your computer from one place then with a laptop you're just paying a premium for its size and no real benefit. </s>
<s> Brian, I cannot tell you what is best for you but I can tell you what works for me at 60-years old. </s>
<s> Maybe you will find something that fits. </s>
<s> I keep an older desktop on hand with a high end audio system as part of my radio broadcast engineering business. </s>
<s> I just updated the graphics to handle Adobe's Flash Player 10 under a slower 1.3Ghz CPU and it keeps ticking after 8-years. </s>
<s> If it gets corrupted, I don't care. </s>
<s> The very first thing I did was clone the hard drive when I bought it. </s>
<s> Since then, I've had to clone it back twice when lousy software collapsed it. </s>
<s> If I were really concerned, I would put an external drive on it. </s>
<s> I really, really prefer to restore a major disaster by cloning. </s>
<s> That's hard to do with a laptop. </s>
<s> I have NEVER had success with a manufacturer's restoration disk. </s>
<s> That said, I just replaced a Toshiba A45 Windows XP laptop that really serviced me well as my primary business machine. </s>
<s> The fan failed after 5-years. </s>
<s> I found a fan. </s>
<s> What I couldn't do was get the case open to replace it and the cost of service led me to retire it in favor of an HP dv6-2150 laptop that is surprisingly well equipped for under $700. </s>
<s> I'm very impressed with it. </s>
<s> This time, I put a 1-terabyte Seagate Black Armor external drive on it that handles scheduled backups of the operating system and my critical files automatically and in the background. </s>
<s> I use it in the field as a broadcast test instrument, too. </s>
<s> It is really convenient and VERY efficient with Intel's i3 core processor under Windows 7 / 64 bit. </s>
<s> Photos? </s>
<s> I took over 5000 8mp shots during an afternoon horse show in 'rock-n-roll' mode. </s>
<s> As I filled each card, I dumped them to the HP laptop while filling up the next card with fast action shooting. </s>
<s> At the same time, the show riders were able to watch the photos in a fast moving slide show. </s>
<s> I wound up selling over a hundred photos and I do NOT do this as a professional. </s>
<s> I can still be obnoxiously picky for the rare and really serious edits. </s>
<s> It's an avocation for distraction. </s>
<s> I do not get into massive editing; Canon's &quot;Digital Photo Pro&quot; is all I need for cropping and correction. </s>
<s> I can't justify Adobe. </s>
<s> I don't think a serious pro would use a laptop because I have found it IMPOSSIBLE to align a laptop screen to match photo color and contrast. </s>
<s> When I have a really serious edit to accomplish, I use the desktop with corrected monitor. </s>
<s> Bottom line ... a laptop would likely hold up very well, but there is no denying that a standard sized desktop has the advantage with repair, upgrades and service life. </s>
<s> Repairing a laptop is a true pain, but it sure is hard to beat the versatility. </s>
<s> $2K can buy a heck of a laptop or desktop ... or well equipped versions of BOTH! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Yes I'll second this. </s>
<s> Had Windows computers for many years and had all sorts of problems which were mostly resolved. </s>
<s> Then 2 months ago I'd had enough and went for a 21.5&quot; iMac - which was what I could afford. </s>
<s> Different life now - never any problems - fabulous for photography - and its fast - and there is no big tower for the electronics. </s>
<s> They are expensive but an iMac will last years whilst if you bought a Windows computer you'd probably replace it after a couple of years. </s>
<s> Wouldn't recommend any laptop for serious photography(even a MacBook) - yes I have a MacBook as well so I've tried it but screen resolution is simply not up to it. </s>
<s> And its a lot slower. </s>
<s> It would save you a LOT of cash and fully guaranteed for a year. </s>
<s> http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/specialdeals/mac?mco=MTkyMTQ3ODE When your year is almost up, get AppleCare Protection Plan and that will take it to 3 years. </s>
<s> All up, it could set you back about $1250 and you'll still have about $700 to play with to buy a cheap $20 mouse. </s>
<s> or a G3 dongle. </s>
<s> Remember, you're retired; time to take it easy. </s>
<s> I've used a MacBook Pro and their predecessors as my only computer for a long time; decades actually. </s>
<s> I'm ready to make a change and I think it applies to you as well. </s>
<s> (Not just because I'm 60 and my dad is 86 and on his 3rd MacBook.) </s>
<s> The MacMini is one fast and capable machine, with excellent software for camera work (and everything else). </s>
<s> With your budget, you can buy whatever flat panel display that fits your needs and buy an iPad for your portable needs.They sync their data together fluidly, and eliminate so much of the PC confusions that I see with many of my clients. </s>
<s> Though it isn't in your specification, I've found that the iPad does everything I need when doing tech support for my corporate clients as well. </s>
<s> Together they fill a complete checklist of what you want if you described the perfect computer. </s>
<s> While not technically portable, the Mini is easily moved from room to room if you don't want to be stuck in the home/office all the time. </s>
<s> Answering emails while walking in the park with the iPad, or taking the &quot;real&quot; computer to an in-laws for an extended stay (a flatpanel display is always on sale somewhere local) is elegant freedom. </s>
<s> I've found that if you get the 3G version of iPad, you can live with only a cheap, non-3G cell phone, further helping the budget. </s>
<s> Hello Brian Maybe this may help you. </s>
<s> Ive been using my Dell Inspiron 8200 since 2002. </s>
<s> Its on its second hard disk now and I've upgraded (doubled) the memory to a full 1 GB, but my noisy (ventilator) little laptop with 1.7 GHz (CPU) is still humming away. </s>
<s> I use it mostly just to surf the internet and read email these days. </s>
<s> On the road I have a newer HP compact with Vista installed that I got in 2008. </s>
<s> Its a lot faster to say the least. </s>
<s> However, the point is, I wouldn't worry about the ventilator fan conking out on you. </s>
<s> Even in Saudi Arabia. </s>
<s> For $2000 you can get yourself a really nice laptop. </s>
<s> Since your a photographer and Vidio enthusiast I assume you need a lot storage, memmory RAM and a good graphics card. </s>
<s> Therefore I would recommend a laptop with a separate graphics card (no integrated) and at least 4 GB RAM. </s>
<s> I hope this helps. </s>
<s> Best regards, Robert </s>
<s> I consider your advice the most &quot;handy&quot; among the others reasonable comments. </s>
<s> Regards, Vaclav (67) </s>
<s> Whatever you end up with make sure it's not from an unbranded firm, many use inferior parts, especially cases, also the warranty's end up costing you more money. </s>
<s> Upgrading the Processor and Graphics card is not impossible (maybe difficult) with a modern laptop. </s>
<s> High-end Laptops often out-perform the average consumer Desktops in every aspect. </s>
<s> At present, it is more viable to opt for Intel's Core i(x) technolodgy, reason being far too long to explain. </s>
<s> As to the Hard-Drive, opt or replace it with an Intel SSD, the GB size will be dependant on your budget, if cost is not of any concern, then opt for SLC SSDs rather than MLC SSDs, you WILL notice the difference. </s>
<s> You can also save on the OS by using Ubuntu (free), this saving can be spent on other other components. </s>
<s> Also Wireless N Standard etc etc etc, these should not need to be mentioned. </s>
<s> The present Desktop set-up will very soon become obsolete, as I previously stated, to explain the factors would take far too long. </s>
<s> Most of the replies offered do not apply to the OP, basically it's people boasting how fast the CPU, how big their HDD and how &quot;Kool&quot; their set-up (pardon the pun). </s>
<s> It's necessary to read and understand the needs of the OP before replying. </s>
<s> To grasp that the Gentleman is 70 Years of age (nearly) and cannot lug a juggernaut on his back or be playing any hard-core games. </s>
<s> He wants a system mainly for photo-editing. </s>
<s> As to the time for it to become obsolete, it's dependant on the requirements (I know people who are still using Windows 3.1 on an IBM system just as ancient). </s>
<s> People's opinion will always differ, you'll need to sort-out what is good advise replied from the ridiculous, which is far more complicated than choosing your ONE computer. </s>
<s> Having bought my mother her most recent computer for her 99th birthday (2 years ago), I spent some time setting it up for her poor eyesight. </s>
<s> With macular degeneration she needs to use a large font and a large monitor (23&quot;) is critical to getting enough text on the screen so she can read easily. </s>
<s> Monitors that size are under $200 and invaluable. </s>
<s> So, I'd argue for the desktop with a big monitor (or one of the large iMacs.) </s>
<s> First, at 69 years old don't be surprised if this is not your last computer. </s>
<s> Second, the type computer depends on your circumstances: Do you have one or two homes (or more)? </s>
<s> do you travel? </s>
<s> do you do your own financial planning and tracking and it is important to you to be up-to-date daily on the market? </s>
<s> Third, why just ONE computer at today's pricing? </s>
<s> If you have more than one home where you divide your time between for months at a time, then you want a top of the line &quot;portable&quot;and an external keyboard and mouse setup at each location with internet high speed access at both----perhaps seasonal turned off. </s>
<s> You want Wi-Fi at both locations and this might be supplemented with an extender at both locations to expand the coverage throughout the house. </s>
<s> If you have one home you want a top of the line desktop with Wi-Fi setup throughout the house as above. </s>
<s> I suggest a Netbook to supplement the base computer. </s>
<s> This can be the one you move to the kitchen or bedroom. </s>
<s> it will be our travel computer. </s>
<s> I'm 74 with two homes we generally split about even time at for long months and have a top of the portable to move between homes to be used as a desktop. </s>
<s> For traveling I use a Netbook. </s>
<s> We generally try to go someplace for a month during the year (Utah, London, Southern Calif)and rent an apartment or condo and take our Netbook. </s>
<s> We are gettting ready to move from our summer home to our winter home and the main portable is now packed to be loaded in the car so I'm using the Netbook as the main computer with a n external keyboard and mouse. </s>
<s> In one location I have high speed internet through cable and at the other via DSL. </s>
<s> At both locations I have the CISCO Valet M-20 (the higher powered valet and use in one location an extneder by CISCO soon to be replaced with one like I use at my summer home,a Hawking which is much easier to setup then the CISCO and works better too. </s>
<s> The formula in my case was to buy a very high spec laptop with a 3 years next business day international warranty. </s>
<s> Then I got myself an all singing and dancing docking station (NOT just a Port Replicator) with facilities for additional cards etc. </s>
<s> etc., (if I ever needed that facility), and a monitor to die for. </s>
<s> Plugging on a set of external speakers completed my requirements at my desktop location. </s>
<s> The result is (for me) awesome. </s>
<s> But do remember that if it is only one PC you want to have, it better be a famously reliable item, and/or have a bullet proof after sales service. </s>
<s> Apart from that, one high capacity (32 Gb) USB stick and one USB hard disk fulfils my backup needs. </s>
<s> Using a good sync software I sync my documents to both stick and HD with the PC regularly. </s>
<s> For insurance against catastrophic disaster, I also keep an entire PC disk image of all the partitions on the very large capacity USB HD . </s>
<s> Many image backup software allows you nowadays to automatically do an incremental backup of your original disk image before it switches the PC off. </s>
<s> Using a defragment software which works during inactive periods, I manage to keep my head above water with a 'once a week' file cleaner utility to clean up all sorts of temporary, log and uninstal files which nowadays the never-ending-and-continually-tweaking modern software updates are pumping in. </s>
<s> On my longer travels I carry the laptop, the 2 usb drives and an image restore boot up disk. </s>
<s> I don't know whether my case history will suit all. </s>
<s> I am sure there are plenty of experts within our community who will find a better solution, and I would humbly look forward to their erudite and sensible advice. </s>
<s> I retired as well and wanted the ultimate computer but found out it can't, for me, be ONE computer. </s>
<s> I bought a full tower with the fastest Intel processor, and RAID drives for my &quot;main&quot; computer. </s>
<s> It is just super for surfing the net over a wired connection, and since I do lots of engineering projects and send many emails, this is a computer that I love! </s>
<s> But it's not mobile, so I bought a little Acer netbook, another computer that I love. </s>
<s> I take this thing everywhere and tap into wifi systems all over the area, including my own wifi network. </s>
<s> When my wife asks me a question about something I whip out the netbook that is in &quot;sleep&quot; mode, and in a couple minutes have Googled the answer. </s>
<s> (I have a 3rd crappy Dell laptop that was given to me that I use for my weather station server and for my CNC). </s>
<s> So I recommend getting BOTH, a fast stationary computer, wires and all, AND a small netbook. </s>
<s> Tiger Direct offers incredible deals on fast gaming computers, as barebones, parts or complete systems and they have the best price on netbooks. </s>
<s> Both computers can easily be bought for the $2000 budget Brian has. </s>
<s> Being retired, you are going to end up computing at home, at your desk, not on an airplane, or in some far off hotel. </s>
<s> What you need is a great PC, with a nice big monitor, something sturdy. </s>
<s> Laptops will get you there. </s>
<s> So will a motorcycle. </s>
<s> What you want is a nice big, tough, reliable car or truck. </s>
<s> You mention the wires as a disadvantage. </s>
<s> It takes a very few minutes to connect a monitor and a printer to the tower, as little as two minutes, even, and ow you have the equivalent of a laptop as far as wires are concerned. </s>
<s> And, with the work you describe, you are going to add a scanner, perhaps a phone, other stuff like an adaptor for a network, etc. </s>
<s> and hooking these to a laptop leaves you with obvious wires all over the place. </s>
<s> So, to avoid a couple of wires, you are gaining a lot more nuisance and inconvenience. </s>
<s> You don't need to spend $2000 for a great computer, unless you are thinking of an Apple. </s>
<s> Save the extra thousand for printer, scanner, good speakers, sofweare, and several years of print cartridges, and other supplies. </s>
<s> Bottom line. </s>
<s> Hot running, little laptops have their place, but they would be a headache for what you want to do. </s>
<s> George </s>
<s> The poster suggesting spending around $600 now, and saving the rest for later, is right. </s>
<s> You can go much farther this way, than you would buying a $2000 computer. </s>
<s> This puts Apple pretty much out of the picture here. </s>
<s> Great machines, but you have to spend about 2X to get similar performance in the PC world. </s>
<s> I would definitely recommend a desktop over a laptop if portability is not an issue. </s>
<s> You will get a more responsive desktop, and a larger display, at this price range. </s>
<s> Netbooks are neat, but I would not want to make one my primary computer. </s>
<s> The display is too small for that. </s>
<s> You might also look at custom built machines. </s>
<s> These are systems built by local shops, using stock cases, and other system components. </s>
<s> While these machines do not bear familiar brand names like Dell or HP, they have the advantage of allowing the computer to be upgraded without replacing the entire unit. </s>
<s> Hi Brian, Since there are pages and pages of great posts so far, you may not even see this. </s>
<s> But, if you should run across it, here is my take on your question... First, I am not a computer &quot;expert&quot;, just a moderately knowledgeable user. </s>
<s> I bought the Dell Dimension desktop computer I'm typing in 2000, and taught myself how to use it and upgrade various parts with a lot of help from forums like this and various Internet sources. </s>
<s> I have no experience with Macs, so can't tell you which platform to go with other than whatever you are comfortable with. </s>
<s> From my experience, and personal speculation, I vote for a Desktop. </s>
<s> Here are a few reasons... 1. </s>
<s> Reason being that there is just more room to put components in that might a compromise for space like an all-in-one or laptop might have to make. </s>
<s> There is also more room for bigger fans and air space for more efficient cooling, and therefore longer component life. </s>
<s> As I mentioned, the desktop I'm using is from 2000. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Desktops are more easily upgraded. </s>
<s> I've added a larger hard drive (it originally came with a whopping 40GB LOL! </s>
<s> ), swapped the CD burner for a DVD burner, and added a multi USB/Firewire port card. </s>
<s> Some people like to upgrade their video card at some point. </s>
<s> With an AIO, that requires a lot more work than a desktop does. </s>
<s> Decide you want a nicer keyboard for a laptop? </s>
<s> Forget it. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> If you don't like the monitor, want to get a bigger one, or need to get it repaired, a desktop is so much easier. </s>
<s> Unless you want to add a second monitor, with an all-in-one or laptop, you're stuck with what you've got. </s>
<s> iMac screens are nice, but if it needs repair, the whole computer must go in. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Wires? </s>
<s> Other than the monitor, what wires are you saving with an all-in-one or laptop? </s>
<s> You still have to plug peripherals in. </s>
<s> At least a desktop on the floor keeps them out of sight more. </s>
<s> Besides, you can add an external backup or secondary drive to a desktop easily. </s>
<s> With laptops and AIOs everything that can't be done with WiFi must be done with a wire. </s>
<s> Try finding an internal TV tuner, backup HD, or Blueray Player for an iMac. </s>
<s> The asthetics of any computer is mainly the screen and keyboard, both have more choices with a desktop. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Cost. </s>
<s> Making things small enough to fit an AIO or laptop case, quality components tend to be a bit pricier. </s>
<s> I bet a AIO/Laptop will run you more than a similarly speced desktop. </s>
<s> Your budget of $2000 will buy you a pretty nice computer + printer (the guy who recommended uploading Walmart all your printing needs is nuts!). </s>
<s> Like Lee said, chances this is your &quot;last&quot; computer are not guaranteed as you never know what future technology holds, or how your needs will change. </s>
<s> Having said that, if you want what you buy today to last as long as possible, I'd buy a desktop over an AIO or laptop. </s>
<s> If you needs change, they're easier to upgrade or have someone do it for you. </s>
<s> Same for repairs. </s>
<s> If you can get access to their Business line, I'd look at something like a Dell Optiplex 980. </s>
<s> They have a bunch of corporate IT stuff you don't need, but they're built well to last a while. </s>
<s> Dell's Business side tech support tends to be decent, especially if you opt for ProSupport, which is 24/7 North American and short wait times. </s>
<s> I have found the toshiba laptop computer very reliable and uses low power, generates little heat. </s>
<s> the laptop now going on 3yrs has not failed with daily use. </s>

<s> IMHO it is first of all the true colors that you get with the Mac computers and saying that Macs are expensive is not true unless you compare it to the bottom line PCs but any higher end PCs will run you just about the same...

<s> No Matter if you prefer Windows or Mac OS or Linux as I do run now A Macbook Pro will run them all PCs will not run OS X But and these ar just preferences but a good laptop with an extension HD & even possibly an external monitor for more viewing space will be a great photo/video editing machine and more versatile then a desktop of any kind unless you also get a netbook to go along.. </s>

<s> Two of the PC's are laptops. </s>
<s> The problem with laptops is that , well lets face it,our eyes just are not what they used to be. </s>

<s> I believe those of us 60+ need to focus on practicability and efficiency re: our particular needs. </s>
<s> Some people only use a computer for the Web others, like me, do photography, digital imaging including advanced Pshop Cs3, sophisticated slideshows (my case Photodex Producer), Roxio (for audio recording, editing and digital image duplication from one format to another such as VHS to DVD) all of which are called &quot;heavy&quot; because of the graphics, etc.. </s>
<s> But if someone uses their computer for the Web and personal functions such as Bookkeeping, etc (ie; Microsoft Office) one can choose a computer that isn't challenged by &quot;Graphics&quot;. </s>

<s> My small advice is to buy as much computer as you can comfortably afford that's hopefully in the top 15% as far as power goes today and then hopefully you'll get 3 years of really great service out of your investment. </s>
<s> As far as buying one last computer, I don't see how that's possible anymore thanks to the ever expanding computer market and components hitting the market each month. </s>
<s> I always look for a machine today that will do everything I want today, but that will hopefully allow me even more growth tomorrow. </s>
<s> Meanwhile, enjoy the ride as we keep expanding our tech lives and just keep adding to your piggy bank for your next great purchase you'll be looking at in 2 or 3 years. </s>
<s> The guy says he wants his last computer; if he gets a laptop, he is not going to be able to upgrade the processor. </s>
<s> If there are such laptops I'm not aware of them, if they exist I'd lay bets they are cost prohibitive. </s>
<s> Also it is impossible to replace graphics adapters without going to a new motherboard. </s>
<s> Lets fact it - you are painting your self in a corner just buying a laptop. </s>
<s> This guy has enough to get both, and last quite a few years. </s>
<s> I will admit - laptops hold there value, and he could probably sell it to someone and buy a new one. </s>
<s> I wonder how long that market will last though? </s>
<s> I am a work in progress and so is my computer. </s>
<s> The world is constantly changing. </s>
<s> And as long as we are growing and changing with it, so will technology. </s>
<s> Buy yourself a really nice case so you won't get tired of looking at it, invest in a very nice monitor, use it for the only monitor in your house, including your television, and keep the insides of that case constantly changing. </s>
<s> THat way, you will always &quot;have&quot; your &quot;last&quot; computer. </s>

<s> Editing Video during your retirement especially HD will require not only a fast processor and decent video card, but a system with good cooling that can run for hours and even overnight as it renders and transcodes video files. </s>
<s> And space for adding more storage and ram. </s>
<s> I think a laptop wouldn't handle the heat as well and because of a less powerful power supply probably won't do as good of a job in general for your purposes. </s>
<s> I suggest buying a decent desktop for around $1300 then saving that $700 and possibly putting away another $50-$100 a year in saving for a new one in say 5 years. </s>
<s> By that time, you should have the original $700+another $250-$500 to spend on much newer technology than isn't even dreamed up yet. </s>
<s> And, probably will also cost you less, as performance goes up and price has gone down in the PC industry from the beginning. </s>
<s> This way you aren't limiting yourself to outdated equiptment in 5-10 years and have something to look forward to also. </s>
<s> Good Luck on retirement! </s>

<s> made on the 9th of October. </s>
<s> A whole week ago exactly as I type this one. </s>
<s> Once again, good work with this post of yours. </s>
<s> Two major considerations. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Your computer will always do what you bought it to do. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Your computer will become obsolete. </s>
<s> We are up to Windows 7. </s>
<s> Only XP still is serviced, because it is so good, by Microsoft but that too will end, and 3. </s>
<s> You'll discover that things you want to do no longer work properly, etc., and that is easier to simply get a new computer which will cost a fraction of the computer you are now using. </s>
<s> Poor Brian opens the box of Pandora which is everyone's different idea of what is best- for THEM. </s>
<s> As a few said, Brian, don't assume this will be your LAST computer, while it's true my ~10 year old Dell Dimension 2350 gets me on the internet just fine, stores all my digital photos and will probably do so 5 years from now, there are things it cannot and will not ever do that I need to be &quot;in the loop&quot; of technology for. </s>
<s> If you aren't concerned with portability I would stick to the desktop format simply because the reliability is much better than laptops (especially by beefing up the factory's measly cooling system, I can't emphasize this enough, they put just enough cooling to allow it to work until the warranty's over or you let it get dirty- first step is to add a blower- not a fan, but a blower which can develop pressure- to the case for exhaust- and if you can add another intake fan to the case with a filter to keep it clean-make sure your airflow upgrades are not fighting the factory's airflow scheme, but augmenting it) AND keep that case clean. </s>
<s> You have options for upgrades that laptops don't have. </s>
<s> Someone said that if laptops had issues with components overheating they wouldn't be sold. </s>
<s> I say if laptops didn't have issues with components overheating, they'd almost all still be working today (at least the ones that didn't get dropped or have beer spilled on them) and you wouldn't see dozens of laptop coolers on the market! </s>
<s> In the end we have over a hundred posts of people arguing over what works best for them. </s>
<s> They are all right, they know the answer to that. </s>
<s> Only you really know the answer to your question, I'm sure you will find it after gleaning the information in all these posts. </s>
<s> you too, huh? </s>
<s> I am typing this on a Dell Dimension 2350 I got secondhand for $40 about 3 years ago. </s>
<s> Added a couple fans to it. </s>
<s> Most reliable computer ever, though not much good for any games made after 2005. </s>
<s> Been through a couple of laptops and other desktops since 2000, this one's bulletproof! </s>
<s> lets be fair about the comparison, most of the pros you cite about the MacPro are true for desktop PC's. </s>
<s> And PC's have a better software selection and give you more bang for the buck. </s>
<s> Any desktop is more reliable and adaptable than any laptop. </s>
<s> I'm sorry I just can't buy into the AppleCorp's &quot;take a bite out of the consumer at every turn&quot; way of doing business. </s>
<s> The way they handle their itunes, the way they make you buy Quicktime Pro if you want any usable features, it's a scam that only those who drink the apple koolaid don't seem to realize. </s>
<s> No offense and if you like that MacPro more power to you, I can't say you are wrong. </s>
<s> I just don't have money to burn or that kind of brand loyalty. </s>
<s> The Answer for you is desktop as laptops are great but are not as functional as a desktop is in the upgrade and connectivity department so for you and most a desktop is the best answer for a single computer solution for function and price in fact the only reason a laptop is best for single computer is when the need for mobility is high but with mobility also come the high risk of data loss due to damage. </s>
<s> About the cords issue with a tower that will not be a issue as with video editing and picture taking you need a ton of hard drive space which with a tower can be put internal however with a one in all and laptops the need for extra external drives thus creating the cable mess you trying to avoid and even more desktop space required as well as slower access to data also with a laptop you graphics are severely limited and up grades imposable </s>
<s> I have had 2 laptops in 15 years. </s>
<s> I was told by a savvy tech he had not turned his laptop off since he bought it. </s>
<s> Goes into a mode that requires little heat. </s>
<s> My Toshiba Satellite doesn't heat up as my older one did. </s>
<s> My husband has a desk top and has replaced it 3 times in 17 years. </s>
<s> Save your $2000 and don't expect a computer to last more than 5 years. </s>
<s> There are great laptops that now cost about $300 and I can't recall the brand but is top rated and new, but will go up in price quickly as people love them! </s>
<s> I do a lot of pictures and use Irfanview which is a FREE program to quickly do a lot of editing of my pictures. </s>
<s> I have used Adobe Print Shop and may add it to this laptop if I do more than Irfanview allows. </s>
<s> Check out the Irfanview program as they have extra downloads also. </s>
<s> As the others have said a Macs can be the way to go but for me I don't want to relearn the way it works. </s>
<s> And it will take all the &quot;change&quot; you have. </s>
<s> They are not the LAST one you will buy. </s>
<s> Nothing lasts a lifetime unless you are 95. </s>
<s> and my budget was ~ $2000.00 here's what I'd do. </s>
<s> I'd buy a desktop first because I have experienced that an all-in-one with the touch screen feature can actually be a negative while editing pictures (and as one grows older, a tap by mistake can always happen and can have disastrous results). </s>
<s> But since you are inclined to go in for an all-in-one, then look that way (does not necessarily have to be a big brand and the specs can be applied to both a desktop or an all-in-one); with an i7 processor if you are a professional or an i5 processor if a semi-pro or a serious amateur, with an exclusive graphics handling capacity of at least 1GB, at least a 500GB hard drive, and additionally go in for a portable laptop and also a 1TB external harddrive (which costs less than a $100 now-a-days) and network all of them and set all the three to synchronize data at the end of the day when you place the laptop on the docking station / the network and be happy with the arrangement. </s>
<s> I haven't talked about the Operating system since, I have always felt that it is a personal choice of convenience. </s>
<s> I am sure that you can do all these in about $2000. </s>

<s> I like your advice Sid! </s>

<s> Between virus scanners, Windows Defender and god-knows-what running in the background, Flash and other video, huge photo files, this thing is starting to feel pretty slow sometimes. </s>
<s> But, I gotta say Batvette, it's the kind of computer Dell built it's reliability reputation on. </s>
<s> Exactly! </s>
<s> I figure it's why Apple will never bring back the mid-price Tower that might be just what this gentleman could use... reasonably priced PCs would be too comparable and the overcharging would stick out too easily. </s>
<s> High margin MacPro sales would take a big hit too;-) </s>
<s> I forgot to mention that one way to get the most life fropm your purchase, besides buying a quality desktop in the first place, is getting it speced out towards the top of what's available as far as CPU-motherboard (with USB3 capabilities). </s>
<s> While desktops are upgradeable (why I think theye are the way to go), after a few years it may get difficult or too expensive to upgrade key components. </s>
<s> Starting with a speedy PC from the start will insure it will &quot;feel&quot; faster and more current than if you went for a more budget configuration. </s>
<s> I am sorry to kick in so late on this thread but I did not receive last week?s newsletter so I was unaware of the question until now. </s>
<s> If you are looking for the best value for your money and portability is NOT an issue than the Desktop computer is your best bet. </s>
<s> I find it unlikely that this will be your last computer unless you are planning an early exodus, but with a $2000 budget you should be just fine because you do not need to spend nearly that much to get a great computer now that will last you 6 or more years and you will have plenty of money left over to purchase a new tower later if you want. </s>
<s> If you replace the hard drive as a part of a routine maintenance program, then there is really no reason it can not last even longer. </s>
<s> Standard Desktop computers (Separate Tower and Monitor) are a much better value than All-In-One computers or Laptops. </s>
<s> You have the ability to upgrade things like video cards, memory, processors, or even add new features like USB 3.0 or USB 4.0 when it arrives. </s>
<s> When they do break, which is pretty unusual these days, desktop computers are much easier and cheaper to fix than their smaller counterparts. </s>
<s> The added bonus of this configuration is that if you purchase a relatively decent monitor now, then there is a good chance that you will be able to keep that and simply replace the tower next time for even less money. </s>
<s> There is no reason to spend more than $1000 unless you are huge gamer or starting a business in Video Editing. </s>
<s> Don?t bother with external hard drives and flash drives for backup, simply sign up for online backup with Carbonite or Mozy for a complete set-it and forget approach to backing up your precious photos. </s>
<s> Make DVD backups if you really feel the need to have additional backups. </s>
<s> Computers are like automobiles, you can spend as much as you want if you are into bragging rights and the Wow factor but it is not necessary to spend a lot to get an excellent system that will last you many years and will perform all the tasks that you are asking of it. </s>
<s> There will always be a faster computer and technology advancements will forever continue to render yours obsolete the week after you buy it. </s>
<s> For the general business and recreational computer user, which most of us are, you do not need an i7 processor with 12GB of ram. </s>
<s> If you have money to burn, then fine, go for it. </s>
<s> Here is what I would recommend: PROCESSOR - An Intel i5 or even an i3 processor is just fine. </s>
<s> I prefer Intel over AMD but that is just my personal preference. </s>
<s> Most people are perfectly happy with anything dual core or better. </s>
<s> MEMORY ? </s>
<s> 4GB of Memory will be plenty. </s>
<s> If you are really unsure, you can always increase it later. </s>
<s> VIDEO - You definitely want a discrete video card but you do not need to spend $400 for one. </s>
<s> There are plenty of Video cards for under $150 that will do the job. </s>
<s> Dual video outputs and HDMI are great extras if you should ever decide to add a second monitor or connect your computer up to you large screen TV. </s>
<s> Keep in mind that with the Desktop Tower, this is something that can be upgraded later if your needs change drastically. </s>
<s> HARD DRIVE ? </s>
<s> Hard drives keep getting bigger and it is not unusual to find 1 terabyte drives and larger as the standard now. </s>
<s> For the average user, anything over 250GB is usually plenty but this it totally dependent on how much data you have or plan to store. </s>
<s> Again this is something that is fairly easy to upgrade should you require more storage down the road. </s>
<s> TOWER FORM FACTOR ? </s>
<s> I recommend a full size tower or Mid/Mini tower but stay away from slim line or small form factor machines. </s>
<s> Upgrading is more difficult, replacement parts scarce and more expensive and they tend not to cool as well as the full size towers. </s>
<s> OPTICAL DRIVES ? </s>
<s> Unless this is going to be your primary video watching entertainment center, you do not need a Blue-Ray drive. </s>
<s> A regular DVD RW drive will be fine and will allow you to read and write both DVD?s and CD?s. </s>
<s> Two separate drives is nice is you plan to do a lot of disk copying. </s>
<s> SOUND/AUDIO ? </s>
<s> Most computers come with int egrated audio and unless you have some specific audio needs beyond most users there is no need to upgrade to a separate sound card. </s>
<s> MEDIA READER ? </s>
<s> This is typically a $20-$30 option that I find worthwhile especially if you are into photography and allows you to read camera memory card directly into your computer. </s>
<s> MONITOR ? </s>
<s> This is where you want to spend a little extra. </s>
<s> Most people keep a monitor for a longer period of time than the computer tower itself and tend to reuse it on either future computers or pass it down to family members. </s>
<s> For aging eyes, like myself, I would recommend a 23? </s>
<s> or larger display. </s>
<s> And if you really want a treat there is nothing better than running Dual Displays. </s>
<s> It can make your life a little easier especially when it comes to working with photos. </s>
<s> You can have your editing tools or your photo collection on one screen and your working area on the other. </s>
<s> Or maybe working on a photo slide show on one screen while reading your email or surfing the internet on the other. </s>
<s> Dragging photos, clipart or video from one screen to another, I can think of only a few upgrades that are more productive than dual displays. </s>
<s> EXTENDED WARRANTIES ? </s>
<s> Service Contracts and Extended Warranties are really a personal choice but I usually do not see the real value in most of them for Desktop computers and/or low end laptops. </s>
<s> However, there are many situations where I these programs have their value. </s>
<s> For example: I would consider the extended plan if you are a real road warrior and you have a high end laptop. </s>
<s> Laptop repairs can be very expensive and a single repair can cost $300 or more. </s>
<s> If you are purchasing a Mac, then you pretty much need to purchase the Apple Care program. </s>
<s> If you do purchase one of these plans, pay very close attention to what is actually covered. </s>
<s> Does it cover only manufacturer?s defects? </s>
<s> What happens if you drop it? </s>
<s> Does it cover software problems or Virus infections? </s>
<s> What happens when I need service? </s>
<s> Is it in-home service or does the computer have to be shipped back to the factory or to some service center? </s>
<s> How long will you be without the computer? </s>
<s> Many clients find that when they do finally have a problem and need service it either was not covered or it was going to take 2-3 weeks to get it back. </s>
<s> Most plans do not cover your data so if your computer needs to go back for service you often are told to take it to a local shop to have them backup your hard drive before sending the computer back for service. </s>
<s> They are not responsible for your data and will often wipe out your data and reinstall Windows as a part of the repair service. </s>
<s> HP and as well as other are notorious for this. </s>
<s> How you spend your money is up to you, but if you play your cards right you could easily get a nice desktop and a laptop for well under $2000 or put the extra money aside to pay for online backup and upgrade your tower in a few years. </s>

<s> I might avoid a Mac if you are in Riyadh as support maybe an issue (I have no idea). </s>
<s> For $2K you can get an external hard-drive as well. </s>
<s> Or, maybe both? </s>

<s> Even though you do not wish to have loads of wires, I would strongly suggest a desktop pc. </s>
<s> The processor is likely to run smoother with a desktop than laptop and video cards are interchangable on desktop motherboards as opposecd to laptop motherboards. </s>
<s> For video editing, you will need a high-end graphics card. </s>
<s> You will also need a high amount of RAM to cope with video editing. </s>
<s> 4096MB (4GB) would suffice. </s>
<s> Make sure your to check what RAM technology your motherboard supports however (DDR2/DDR3 For the operating system, I would advise windows 7 ultimate. </s>
<s> This operating systtem is very good at handling vide and film editing. </s>
<s> You will also want a large Hard drive (maybe even more than 1) It should be around 2TB. </s>
<s> As for your CD/DVD I would advise getting two Blu-ray +/- RW Recordable drives so you can watch HD movies and also perform disk-to-disk copies easily The power supply rating should be about 900W for powering many different devices easily The motherboard should also have onboard SATAv2 ports and PCI Express slots. </s>

<s> It really is too bad Apple refuses to make a true desktop for a more reasonable price than the Pro, or I would have bought one a couple years ago. </s>

<s> Thanks for responding. </s>
<s> I have had many great replies. </s>

<s> Having got great advice from many CNET members I am inclined towards a desktop and large screen. </s>
<s> I appreciate your comments. </s>
<s> Brian </s>
<s> Thanks for the practical advice. </s>
<s> I am learning from everybody's answers and leaning towards a desktop with large screen. </s>
<s> I appreciate the advice about i7 and graphic cards. </s>
<s> I thought I needed a top graphic card but your info re editing video etc has helped me. </s>
<s> I appreciate your comments. </s>
<s> Brian </s>
<s> Harv, your response was an education for me. </s>
<s> Before reading your comments I had already come to the conclusion, from the sound advice of other members, that I will probably get a tower with large monitor. </s>
<s> I agree with you that computer shopping is a minefield and that was why I sought advice from CNET members. </s>
<s> I am not swayed by Logo's but I do like a machine to look well and I want to enjoy this bit of shopping. </s>
<s> Mind you I am also thinking that maybe I shouldn't spend all the budget in one go, as many have suggested that whatever computer I opt for its life span will be limited. </s>
<s> Again, thanks for your info, you have definitely helped me to veer away from putting all my budget into a laptop. </s>
<s> Brian </s>
<s> Thanks indeed. </s>
<s> I appreciate the practical and specific advice and especially the advice about Windows 7 limitations. </s>
<s> I now have lots of good advice from many members and am leaning towards the tower with large screen. </s>
<s> Reality check: I don't know who is better off. </s>
<s> My wife wouldn't accept any recommendation from me because of my lack of technical expertise. </s>
<s> I did want to buy her a nice machine but she trusts her own judgement better and is opting for a Netbook for around $300. </s>
<s> I know from experience that there is no point in trying to change her opinion!! </s>
<s> Brian </s>
<s> Thanks for your input. </s>
<s> I will be working from home so don't need too much mobility. </s>
<s> Having read lots of good advice from members I am leaning towards a tower with large screen. </s>
<s> Practical suggestions about wireless options teach me that maybe I won't have too many wires to deal with. </s>
<s> I am a novice in the photograhy video editing areas and really am looking forward to working/playing with my pictures/videos for pleasure and relaxation. </s>
<s> I appreciate your reply. </s>
<s> Brian </s>
<s> Many thanks. </s>
<s> Your advice was some of the best that I have received out of many many responses. </s>
<s> I haven't read them all yet. </s>
<s> In particular I hadn't thought of getting a separate large monitor but it makes sense because that's where we enjoy the end products of our editing. </s>
<s> I also appreciate the info about quad core processor and wireless router which make me lean towards your suggestion of a tower with large monitor. </s>
<s> I like the All-in-one concept too mainly because of the aesthetics and large screen but having read others comments I feel I may be en-route to headaches with these machines. </s>
<s> Reality Check: I like the energy and drive of your dad but I can't think that far ahead! </s>
<s> Brian </s>
<s> Charles, I have received great advice from many members and I haven't yet gone through all the contributors comments. </s>
<s> Your advice answered all my questions and I am definitely going to go for Tower with large monitor and follow up on your advice with wireless technology. </s>
<s> In particular, I appreciate the detailed and specific suggestions you made about what might meet my needs and also the invaluable comments about the All-in-one when it needs servicing. </s>
<s> Your tips have made me think and I am confident that your recommendations will meet my needs and if they don't I won't cry about my purchase. </s>
<s> I appreciate the time and effort you have made for me and it makes me wonder why we cann't have peace in the world when such good will exists between most of us... Brian </s>
<s> Thanks for the reality check. </s>
<s> I agree entirely with you. </s>
<s> I am not that knowledgeable about technical specifications but I am practical. </s>
<s> I am leaning towards a desktop with something like a 24&quot; high quality monitor. </s>
<s> I have a moderately specified IBM laptop for the past 6 years and it is working fine and meets most of my needs but I do want something more capable for my pictures and video files I am learning that there are many solutions. </s>
<s> The ingenuity of replies and the generosity of people in offering helpful advice makes me feel humble. </s>
<s> I have learned a lot from this forum and I still haven't read all the comments. </s>
<s> Brian </s>
<s> Thanks Robert, I have had many thought provoking suggestions and I am coming around to the idea of a desktop with high quality large monitor since I won't really need portability when retired. </s>
<s> Brian </s>
<s> Thanks, food for thought! </s>
<s> I hadn't thought of the iPad but others too have made this worthwhile suggestion. </s>
<s> Brian </s>
<s> Thanks but getting refurbished products sent to Saudi Arabia is too adventurous for me! </s>
<s> I do like the idea though and the Apple Care Protection suggestion is very practical. </s>
<s> I am leaning towards a fixed desktop with 24&quot; quality monitor, as I don't really need portability. </s>
<s> It has been an education for me to read the comments. </s>
<s> I have learned quite a lot from this forum and I am relaxed about this computer shopping so maybe it won't be my final computer! </s>
<s> Brian </s>
<s> Thanks for your advice. </s>
<s> I am learning from the many responses posted and certainly your suggestions for back-up have made me think. </s>
<s> I do not really need portability and am leaning towards a desktop with high quality 24&quot; monitor. </s>
<s> Brian P.s that was some 'shoot'... 5000 8mp pictures in one day, you will be camera shopping soon! </s>
<s> !B. </s>
<s> Thanks for your suggestions. </s>
<s> Others too have advised not to spend the budget on one machine and I am leaning towards these suggestions. </s>
<s> The variety of responses and the generosity of people in responding has been humbling for me. </s>
<s> I have an old IBM laptop which meets most of my daily needs and I intend to keep using it. </s>
<s> I would like to have the capability of a faster machine with a nice monitor and from the suggestions made I am leaning towards a fixed desktop and a large monitor and I will still have some money in the 'kitty'. </s>
<s> Others have suggested that it probably won't be my last computer either so I hope they are right. </s>
<s> Brian P.s Like you I paid about $3000 for my first custom built computer about16 years ago. </s>
<s> Age has caught up with me and I can't remember the exact specifications but I think it was one step after Windows 3.1. </s>
<s> B. </s>
<s> Thanks for your advice. </s>
<s> I am learning a lot from all the suggestions that people have offered. </s>
<s> When I retire I don't think that portability will be that necessary. </s>
<s> However,when you mentioned your Toshiba it reminded me of my reasons for submitting my question to the forum. </s>
<s> I was on the verge of buying a top of the range Toshiba Qosmio model as a desktop replacement for $2200 dollars(Saudi Arabia prices)with Windows 7 Home edition but nothing else loaded. </s>
<s> I liked the look of the machine and the specifications were first class. </s>
<s> However, I felt a little unease that it was the best use of my budget and I am really glad that I asked the question. </s>
<s> There are many possible solutions but at this moment I am leaning towards a tower machine with a high quality large monitor and by using wireless technology where feasible the surrounds shouldn't be too cluttered with wires. </s>
<s> The Toshiba's are fine machines. </s>
<s> Brian. </s>
<s> Thanks for your comments. </s>
<s> You seem to have had several issues with your laptops and from all the suggestions that I have received I am leaning towards a desktop with a high quality large monitor, as I won't really need portability. </s>
<s> I really appreciate the generosity that people have shown (with their time) in responding to my question. </s>
<s> Brian </s>
<s> Thanks for your helpful suggestions. </s>
<s> From the large number of responses I have received there are many possible solutions. </s>
<s> I am leaning towards a desktop with large monitor and as much wireless technology as possible. </s>
<s> I will opt for Windows 7 Pro because of the restore capabilities. </s>
<s> I am familiar with Windows software and don't really want to change to other systems. </s>
<s> Portability is not a big issue with me but from suggestions made maybe I will compromise on the high end tower and buy both tower and laptop from my budget. </s>
<s> It surely is an education to read through all the responses. </s>
<s> It is from simple questions like this that books are written! </s>
<s> Anyway, I haven't finalized by decision but my shopping will have much more purpose now. </s>
<s> Thanks again, Brian. </s>
<s> Thanks, You may well be right and I did look at Apple's 21.5&quot; and 27&quot; models here in Riyadh but the prices here are higher here than in USA and when you look for specs like i5 or i7 the models are over $2000. </s>
<s> They were selling discounted models with Core2Duo technology within budget but I hesitated since I wasn't sure if this would meet my photo and video editing tasks. </s>
<s> Your suggestion of Apple + iPad is nice and you have made me rethink about compromises. </s>
<s> At this stage I am leaning towards a tower with high quality 24&quot; monitor and wireless technology to reduce the clutter of wires. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> Brian </s>
<s> Thanks, From the many suggestions i have received I am leaning towards a desktop with large monitor and using wireless technology to avoid the clutter of wires.Brian </s>
<s> Thanks, food for thought! </s>
<s> From the many responses I think I must change my attitude, I am not dead yet so this may not be my final computer. </s>
<s> There are many solutions and I am thinking maybe I shouldn't spend all the budget at one time but I certainly have learned a lot by posing the question. </s>
<s> Brian. </s>
<s> Yes, I agree with you the iMac 27&quot; is beautiful but with core i7 it is way over budget in this city (Riyadh). </s>
<s> I am a keen amateur photographer with no interest in selling any of my pictures and while the iMac would be a dream i am leaning towards a tower with a 24&quot; HD monitor and wireless technology to reduce wire clutter. </s>
<s> Someone else suggested that I buy an iPad with a tower and that also has possibilities which I like. </s>
<s> Thanks for yo7ur comments. </s>
<s> Brian. </s>
<s> Thanks, I am inclined to agree with your mother and from all the suggestions that I have received I am leaning towards a tower with a 24&quot; high quality monitor and wireless technology to reduce clutter. </s>
<s> Brian </s>
<s> Thanks a lot your advice is just what I am looking for. </s>
<s> It is concise, clear and specific. </s>
<s> I have had several great responses and I can see that there are many possible solutions. </s>
<s> I am leaning towards a custom built tower with a large HD monitor and wireless technology to reduce wire clutter where possible. </s>
<s> My photography and video skills are modest so I am sure that your specifications will be good enough to pass onto the next genearation. </s>
<s> Having said that, my attitude has changed since submitting my question. </s>
<s> I am not dead yet and this may not be my final computer so maybe I will settle for even a more modest specification and get an iPad to show off my pictures! </s>
<s> Everday is a good day and I have really enjoyed the responses that were contributed. </s>
<s> Brian </s>
<s> Thanks, having received a lot of great suggestions I can see that there are many possible solutions and several people have made the same suggestion as you. </s>
<s> I agree maybe it would be foolish to put all my eggs in one basket. </s>
<s> I am leaning towards a tower with large high quality monitor and wireless technology to reduce wire clutter. </s>
<s> Your mention of other family members did give me a reality check which is indeed relevant. </s>
<s> Funnily enough I suggested to my better half that we buy an All-in-one machine to share but I was turned down sharply with the response, 'I will pick my own laptop, thank you'!! </s>
<s> I decided to follow my own dreams and hence I asked the question and the responses have been both educational, valuable and entertaining. </s>
<s> Thanks again, Brian. </s>
<s> P.s I didn't figure what S.O stood for but reading between the lines I think you meant spouse.B </s>
<s> Thanks, Excellent suggestions and the back yard on a sunny day gives me food for thought. </s>
<s> Brian </s>
<s> Thanks a lot. </s>
<s> I have had many thought provoking suggestions but I like your comment that you must like what you get. </s>
<s> It is too easy to be taken in by sales talk and specifications and then not like the look of the machine. </s>
<s> From the suggetions sent to me I am inclined to favour a tower with large monitor and wireless technology to reduce wire clutter. </s>
<s> Many have suggested that with my budget I should have both tower and laptop for flexibility and that also has made me reconsider. </s>

<s> Thanks, I am not interested in the power needed for gaming and from all the good advice I am leaning towards a desktop with 24&quot; monitor with wireless techology where feasible. </s>

<s> Just like the time when Ciba Chrome was all the rage, doing photos and graphics on a PC running anything Microsoft is a pain. </s>
<s> It is done all the time bu it is frustrating as heck. </s>
<s> I would suggest a MacBook Pro AND an external 20+ inch Monitor, Plain old Photoshop (not the suite( and a small tablet. </s>
<s> Get an external drive for backup (and huge files ) and off you go. </s>
<s> Those who insist that PCs are cheaper for the same thing need to really add up the actual costs. </s>
<s> AND you can run XP or Vista or Windows 7 if you must for some reason. </s>
<s> As an old Photog, it is making photos that counts. </s>
<s> I wanted my camera to feel automatic in my hands. </s>
<s> Same with the computer - I want it to be simple and slick and automatic so I don't have to figure out every step from one program to another. </s>
<s> I want to hit print and get what I expect. </s>
<s> I got a Canon color printer and it has 4 inks. </s>
<s> That has been a great boon to getting nice snaps AND really nice 8X10's. </s>
<s> Finally the Tablet is a luxury but I like to spot and retouch a bit and the tablet is more precise than the mouse or trackpad. </s>
<s> Finally- The oldest Mac I use consistantly is 12 years old and runs a version of Photoshop CS from 5 years ago. </s>
<s> It prints wirelessly, does everything I usually want. </s>
<s> I use the MacBook Pro for more difficult or intense things - really attacking a shot and piecing together several large photos etc. </s>
<s> You would be hard pressed to find anyone running a 12 year old PC because they wouldn't allow the new Operating systems and would be a mess. </s>
<s> (mine is running OS-X 10.5x) Having a blast is the key and viruses, bloated junkware and spam are not what I want to spend my time on. </s>
<s> Macs are not a problem in the graphics world - some cameras are. </s>
<s> Unless the fellow is a computer guy who has a camera versus a photographer who has a computer, there is no use for a PC tower or a MAC tower for that matter. </s>
<s> By the time the MacBook Pro is really on the outs, he (like me) will be pushing 80 and want a new one anyway... with HUGE buttons. </s>
<s> I have had towers (have a 12 year old Mac running OS-X 10.5x.) </s>
<s> But the new mac laptops are amazing and cheap for providing everything a photographer would need except Photoshop or Aperture. </s>
<s> Far more useful than the PC offerings at the same price. </s>
<s> Besides - if someone HAS to run a PC program, you can do so on a Mac. </s>
<s> Thanks for the tip. </s>
<s> I am not familiar with how the forum works but following your hint I am learning! </s>
<s> Brian. </s>
<s> Thanks, definitely food for thought; like you I like not to have think too hard about using the camera or the computer as I am no expert with either. </s>
<s> Brian </s>
<s> And I look forward to more discussions on CNET! </s>
<s> =D </s>
<s> My son does some of the same things you are describing along with gaming or whatever he wants on a Gateway FX P7908u. </s>
<s> You can find one for around a grand. </s>
<s> The graphics card is awesome and the GTX 260m can be accesorized with 3D glasses etc. </s>
<s> for more fun. </s>
<s> I also think you can upgrade the RAM to 6G. </s>
<s> It has been a workhorse computer for us, and it is also a beautiful piece with a 17&quot; screen. </s>
<s> It definately changed my mind about Gateway. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot for your very practical and sensible advice, I think like you too. </s>
