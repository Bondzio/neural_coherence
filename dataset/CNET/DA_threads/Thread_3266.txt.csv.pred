1.1.1	XP Pro and IE 7 My dear old mom (87) has terrible tremors and has a very difficult time lining up the cursor to click a link etc.	St
1.1.2	She exchanges emails with friends and family daily.	St
1.1.3	I know how to slow the mouse down, but that isn't really the problem.	St
1.1.4	Her hand jerks around so much that hard to line up at any speed.	St
1.1.5	I'm thinking maybe a sandbag on her wrist.	St
1.1.6	Anyways, PC mag Feb edition lists Logitech Nulooq as one of 20 best innovations.	St
1.1.7	It's I think 1 lb hockey puck-size device made to use with a mouse.	St
1.1.8	Has anyone tried one of these?	Ques
1.1.9	I'm thinking the weight of the device would be helpful.	St
1.1.10	Can it open emails etc?	St
1.1.11	Hope that I've made myself clear for a change.	St
1.1.12	Any any other suggestions very welcome.	Polite
1.2.1	Might not even have to use a mouse.	St
1.3.1	where you can record the mouse movements it takes to say &quot;make an email&quot; and then save it to a single icon.	St
1.3.2	Then she only has to double click one icon to execute a series of mouse movements thats automated.	St
1.4.1	william551, No actually.	St
1.4.2	She has problems speaking coherently too and sometimes can hardly speak at all.	St
1.4.3	She is a cancer surviver of 13 years now and the radiation treatments that saved her life have given her these afflictions.	St
1.4.4	A small price to pay and she is extremely healthy and active both mentally and physically otherwise.	St
1.4.5	Just goes to show that one can't give too much info when asking a question.	St
1.4.6	Thanks!	St
1.5.1	william551, I'll think about that a bit.	St
1.5.2	Her problem is hitting even a desktop shortcut icon the first time.	St
1.5.3	Thanks!	St
1.6.1	maybe setting them off aside from the others and spaced further apart.	Sug
1.6.2	I know you can go into desktop settings and change the icon spacing width and height.	St
1.6.3	Maybe 80 or 100 is a good setting in &quot;appearance&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot;.	St
1.6.4	And then scroll down to icon spacing.	St
1.7.1	william551, That's a great start and something I will do.	St
1.7.2	She has dial-up.	St
1.7.3	Turn on the computer, click the Outlook Express icon that activates her dial-up and opens OE.	St
1.7.4	Inbox set up with separate folders such as family, friends etc.	St
1.7.5	No auto preview pane.	St
1.7.6	The toolbar buttons can be a problem too.	St
1.7.7	She all too often hits Delete instead of Send/Recv after one finger typing out a reply.	St
1.7.8	Simple things like highlighting a line of text to copy and paste are almost impossible.	St
1.7.9	Trying to give you all a picture of what she has to go though to read & send email etc.	St
1.7.10	I need to think about that voice recognition some more too.	St
1.7.11	Back in the late 90s I had AOL and there was a version that had what I think was called &quot;AOL Speaks&quot;.	St
1.7.12	It was laughingly hopeless and I think the next version did not include it.	St
1.7.13	Thanks for the replies!	St
1.7.14	I guess that I might have to purchase one of those Logitech Nulooq to see how it works, but will wait a couple of days to see if anyone here is familiar with it first.	St
1.8.1	I hope that you live close by.	St
1.8.2	The first thing that I might try is using some of the accessibility controls that have been designed for disadvantaged windows users.	St
1.8.3	She will still have to be somewhat careful, but judicious use might make her more confident.	St
1.9.1	Hi, We've been through the Windows accessibility settings and they aren't good enough.	St
1.9.2	We live 500 miles apart.	Polite
1.9.3	Thanks for your reply!	St
1.9.4	I'm going to try next a graphics forum for Logitech Nulooq info and then try to find a forum that would know more about speech recognition programs that william551 suggested.	St
1.9.5	Thanks all!	St
