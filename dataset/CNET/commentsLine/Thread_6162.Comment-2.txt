over at  you can find pdf documents with exact dimensions of what i will call &quot;standard size&quot; atx power supplies.
while i've grown familiar with these to the point i can just look at the psu then check the connections a new technician will need such a document and learn what the atx, atx12v and other power connections are as well as determine if the replacement supply has enough of each connection.
one owner spent a year seeking out a psu because they couldn't find &quot;the right one.&quot; they were looking for one with exactly the right number of power connections but imagine them passing up unit after unit because it has &quot;too many&quot; power connections.
hopefully this won't stop you.
tell me how it turns out.
