<s> Hi, I'm looking for an external hard disk with a LAN port on it so I can have it as a network location as opposed to connected by USB or FireWire. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> While a great idea for some LANs, the speed drop from USB 2.0 480Mbps to 100Mbps could have the owners screaming &quot;what's taking so long.&quot; Buffalo makes a few such units so take a look there. </s>

<s> I am wanting to get three of the devices, one of backing up to, another for mirroring that back up across town and the last one to keep junk on that I need on both my notebook and networks. </s>
<s> USB 2 means that a computer needs to be switched on to access it and while most of the time the computer is on, sometimes people like to save the environment. </s>
