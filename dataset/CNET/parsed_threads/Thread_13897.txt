<s> continuation of: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7591-0.html?forumID=26&threadID=92877&start=0 re: computer shuts down (apparently due to overheating) while idle. </s>
<s> I installed a new power supply today -- and watched the cpu temp climb from 97.7 to 122F in one minute while the computer was idle. </s>
<s> CPU fan is working and was rated for this cpu. </s>
<s> I would really prefer to have this computer to work without a babysitter. </s>
<s> Thanks for the great ideas, but what to do now? </s>
<s> The new power supply seems more robust than the old one so that's something at least.... System: Abit Kv7-v mobo AMD 2900 cpu 450 watt power supply (newly replaced.) </s>
<s> 512 mb ddr 400/pc3200 ram Radeon 7000 series video card/64mb ddr onboard AGP sound card& lan card are on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Running xp pro sp2 </s>
<s> power supply does not control the temp of the cpu!. </s>
<s> you can buy a shim for the processor and use thermal grease to help the cpu heatsink and fan you currently if this does not help you can upgrade the heatsink and fan to a better and faster version. </s>
<s> then there is the noise level you must contend with. </s>
<s> reaserch the fans for noise and fan size and speed before you buy. </s>
<s> whats quite for me maybe unacceptable for you!. </s>
<s> why not upgrade the CPU cooler? </s>
<s> most are rated to a certain point, but end up running the CPU at high temps can you give us temp readings in C also, in F it really doesn't help i'd suggest the Thermalright SI-97 and a 92MM Panaflo High Speed (i bought the U. </s>
<s> High Speed, because it was the same cost but the noise is a bit louder) i'd also consider the motherboard as the source of the problem the PSU doesn't affect temps you need better cooling i'd suggest this: http://www.sidewindercomputers.com/thsiforamdat.html and either the Panaflo 92MM High Speed or 92MM Ultra High Speed (Their the same price last i checked, so it's really how much noise u wanna deal with) http://www.sidewindercomputers.com/arcemosi.html also get that yeah, it's a lot of TIM more than you'll probably ever use but the price is good, and you NEED A TIM don't not get it GET THAT the SI-97 comes w/o a thermal pad as for a motherboard http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=13-170-113&depa=1 that should work great </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> One feature about an AMD processor is that it sits low in the Ziff socket. </s>
<s> The edge of the Ziff socket is slightly higher than the CPU chip surface. </s>
<s> The AMD Fan/Heatsink combo has a indented cut edge that allows the surface of the heatsink to touch the CPU surface. </s>
<s> If you reverse this heatsink, then the surfaces do not mate. </s>
<s> I have seen a half dozen motherboards that had the heatsink reversed and powered down because of inadequate cooling. </s>
<s> (The CPU Heat Diode worked). </s>
<s> Reversing the heatsink so that the cut edge fits over the Ziff socket raised edge solved the problem in every case. </s>
<s> Also you cannot use a Pentium Fan/heatsink on an AMD because it has no cut edge. </s>
<s> Norm </s>
<s> mounting a Socket A HSF correctly takes a bit of force, i think it'd crack the die before it'd mount </s>
<s> First of all, thank you for all the time you put into your reply -- I appreciated having a specific example. </s>
<s> After reading your advice I went down to the computer store and bought the biggest monster fan with heatsink that would fit. </s>
<s> It looks like there is a jet engine on it! </s>
<s> But after I installed it -- I had new problems. </s>
<s> The computer now powers on but does not boot. </s>
<s> Everything lights up, it makes happy noises but nothing -- no beeps, no video, nothing. </s>
<s> I changed out video card, reset the mobo, checked the fitting on everything -- I even disconnected the extra drives thinking that maybe this new heatsink uses too much power. </s>
<s> Nothing changes. </s>
<s> The new fan has 2 plugs, one that goes to the mobo and another 4 pin that I plugged in to power it. </s>
<s> It does light up and spin. </s>
<s> I have not tried reinstalling the old fan yet -- working with those stupid clips makes me crazy. </s>
<s> I will tackle that tomorrow. </s>
<s> I will be ordering a new mobo on Monday. </s>
<s> I think by the time I'm done I will have bought enough parts for 2 computers.... </s>
<s> I've done it once before -- but not this time. </s>
<s> I'm very careful to check now. </s>
<s> I hate those stupid clips -- they have got to come up with a better method. </s>
<s> Thanks for the input. </s>
