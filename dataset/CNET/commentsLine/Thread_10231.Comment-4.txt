the power or ac lines are too easy to check so if you suspect that, a volt meter is too easy to use.
sorry but i think you want this written so i will.
the old works at the shop syndrome is often traced to not the ac (unless we are talking really bad third world areas) but something the owner is not taking into account.
they get home and (here it is) hook up their usb drives, printers, phone and what else that is not the same as the shop.
some of them will not place the machine in the same orientation as it was at the shop.
but it sounds like a flaky board to me.
