1.1.4	Everything has worked fine up until this morning when my BT mouse suddenly stopped working on both Mac OS X and Windows .	St

1.1.6	It still does not work on Windows , though .	St
1.1.7	When I try to install it , it locates the mouse , connects , but the system tray displays the following message : & quot ; A problem occured during hardware installation .	St
1.1.8	Your hardware might not work properly & quot ; .	St
1.1.9	I have a feeling it is a software problem .	St
