i have an hp pavilion tx2000 laptop [old, i know, but it's been fixed up from it's previous mess and made like new and improved again] and when i flip it over i see what looks like some kind of fan.
i'm not sure if it is the fan but it closely resembles one and it's right next to the vents.
hot, hot air blows out when i play either the sims 3 or when it's charging, and i'm wondering if it's due to this so called &quot;fan&quot; i'm looking at.
i am planning on buying a cooling pad in the nearby future but i'd like to know what i can do now to check.
there's some dust inside from where i can see it and it looks like it's on one of the blades.
