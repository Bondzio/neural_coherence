Hey fellow people, I have a system board that is giving me problems, I was wondering if anyone knew of any utilities that will help me test the hardware (IDE bus, memory, CPU etc.). It boots up fine but fails on copying the files while installing windows. I have tried various cd's and even changed drives, and also memory. Thanks for your assistance. -Ne0
