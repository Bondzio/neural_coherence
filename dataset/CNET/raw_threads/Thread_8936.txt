At the moment, due to limited desk space they are stacked on top of each other. These are all pre-bought drives, and I don't want to fiddle with opening them up etc, but I am looking for a &quot;rack&quot; or some kind of storage option to separate them with shelves or something to allow for better cooling. Ideally, these shelves would have fans in them, similar to a laptop lap cooling device. Does anyone know of any products like this? My google searches have failed so far. Thanks.

You may find inexpensive solutions at your local office supply stores, Walmart/Target, dollar stores, and large home improvement stores. I'm thinking of mail/paper slots and desktop organizers.
