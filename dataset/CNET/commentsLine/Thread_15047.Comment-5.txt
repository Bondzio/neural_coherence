ssid is the identification name that every wireless access point uses to identify itself to clients.
on some access points, you can turn its broadcast off so that it doesn't sit there telling anybody/thing within range &quot;here i am, my name is (fill in the blank), connect to me if you want to (and have the right password if that is required).&quot; what we suggesting here is that you have a neighbor who just installed a wireless access point and didn't do a very good job of securing it.
your laptop has decided it likes the connection over there better than your own (signal may be stronger?).
so you are surfing the 'net on his account without knowing it.
your printer isn't on his network, so that's why you can't get to it.
look at the connection details when your laptop is on and judge whether you are still on your own network.
