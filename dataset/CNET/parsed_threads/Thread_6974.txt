<s> Hi, I just bought an online game and can't get the CD to run/install. </s>
<s> When I place CD in, it blinks for several minutes and the little &quot;cd icon&quot; at curser blinks on and off, but then nothing happens. </s>
<s> If I go to run and select the drive it says to place disc in drive, when it is already there. </s>
<s> One time when I canceled at the &quot;insert CD in to drive D&quot; box, my computer went completly blank except for the wallpaper. </s>
<s> All the icons, the bar at bottom, everything. </s>
<s> I also tried both drives. </s>
<s> I inserted other CD's in and they work. </s>
<s> I then tried with my laptop and it installed with no problems. </s>
<s> It says it is compatible with Vista and XP SP2. </s>
<s> My laptop has vista. </s>
<s> My desktop has XP with SP3. </s>
<s> Both computers exceed the minimum requirements of the game, actually they exceed the recommended ones too. </s>
<s> Is it possible the disc is not backwards compatible to SP2 when I have SP3 installed? </s>
<s> I tried googling the problem, couldn't find anything, TIA for any replies. </s>

<s> Such as how an online game came to be on said CD. </s>
<s> and look at its contents with Windows Explorer or My Computer. </s>
<s> No dice? </s>
<s> Then, somehow, this particular player won't recognize this particular disk. </s>
<s> Can happen, especially with burned disks. </s>
<s> Things to try then: - Clean the disk - Clean the drive - Replace the drive - Return the disk and get your money back - Copy the disk on another machine and hope the new copy will be readable Everything fine in Windows Explorer? </s>
<s> Find the autorun.inf or the setup.exe and do a manual install. </s>

<s> It's a multiplayer online game, doesn't have ability to buy/download online. </s>
<s> It's copy protected. </s>
<s> Tried all the things you suggested, short of replacing the drive. </s>
<s> Tried autorun and manual with the setup.exe, it won't even recognize the disk. </s>
<s> Guess it's just one of those things. </s>
<s> Seemed wierd that both the drives on one computer would not read it, but could install on my laptop. </s>
<s> They may be the same brand?, but different models. </s>
<s> One is faster double layer dvd/cd burner, the other just a player. </s>
<s> Thanks for replies. </s>
<s> Try exchanging it. </s>
