I am a student who uses a laptop heavily - I use it for heavy internet browsing and research and hard core programming.
As a student, I also appreciate being able to easily transport the laptop to and from school every day - I also really need the laptop to be durable!
On that note, I have narrowed down two laptops that I particularly liked: the Asus UX32A and the Asus S400CA.
Both have i3 processors and 500GB of storage (more than enough) as well as 4GB of storage?
Which laptop would be better for my usage, considering the requirements I listed above?
Thank you!
