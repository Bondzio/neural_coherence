as i said in my first post, if you only have 1 x 1gb dimm installed, you will probably not notice any difference.
installing matching pairs with only 1gb of memory (2 x 512) means that you will have to replace both the dimms, only two slots in the imac, when you decide to upgrade your memory if you want to maintain the matching pair strategy.
install 1 x 1gb now, upgrade later, with another 1gb, and you now have the matching pair that apple recommends and will not have wasted any money.
