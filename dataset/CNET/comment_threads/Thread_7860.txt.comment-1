I currently have a few users from my company using Cisco VPN client 5.0.06.
Sometimes when they're away, they can not connect to the hotel or airport wireless network using the Cisco VPN Client.
I have investigated and it seems that sometimes the router they are trying to connect to is not compatible with Cisco VPN Client protocols.
( well..most of the times ) My question is: is there a better solution that Cisco VPN Client, one that will allow them to connect to any type of router that airports and hotels are using?
Thanks!
