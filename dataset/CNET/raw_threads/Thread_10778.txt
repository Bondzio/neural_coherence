I hate to ask what might be a basic question but I also don't want to either buy the incorrect or best option for memory. I am looking to upgrade my pc to I THINK 4gb of RAM. I currently have a HP m7248n with 1 mb of ram. More specifically acording to the stats I have 2 X 512/ 184 pin, DDR SDRAM. The PC has a Athlon 64 X2 (M) 4200 2.2 GHz processor and I am running Windows XP Media center edition ver 2002 service pack 2. I also believe I have 4 slots for memory (2 in use, 2 available). I have included a link to the HP web site with my model below if I left out any additional information. In regards to use, I am not a huge power user except for the fact I burn a lot of DVDs of home movies. Also burn cd's, listen to music, transfer songs to mp3. I also do a LOT of uploading photos etc. (dad of 3 kids basically). I don't do gaming really at all, so beyond the power intensive dvd rendering and other items above my use ends up mainly limited to internet etc. here are my questions: 1) Right off the bat, what kind of memory should I get? When I did a QUICK look I saw options such as 800 MHz DDR2, 1333 MHz DDR3 etc. I know what memory is in general, but get lost on the DDR2 vs DDR3 etc 2) If I have 4 slots open, and am interested in 4 gb, can I actually buy 2 2 GB cards and keep my existing 2 and actually end up with 5 gb? or am I better off yanking what i have and just putting in the 2 2 gb (or maybe 4 1 gb if the cost make more sense) I hope I provided enough info and made my questions clear. If not scold me, I have a thick skin, then tell me what else you need to know. Also I am fairly comfortable with opening the system, removing the memory I have, putting new in etc - I have done that before, it is not a matter of how to but what I need. thanks thanks thanks in advance agian, if needed, additional link to PC model with technical stats: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00511049&cc=us&dlc=en&lc=en&jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN

So why go much over 2G? www.crucial.com has your model listed so stick to that and you'll be fine. But I don't expect more than 2 per cent speed gains on anything you said you are doing. Bob
7143	2	373964	3200237	3199951	krubby	12/17/09 8:13 PM	1.26108078E12	thanks / one last question (I hope)	just for clarification: are you saying if I go from 1gb to 2gb I won't get much more than a 2% or so improvement? Or that if I go much beyond 2gb I won't get much more? In regards to what I am doing, yes I should of been more clear. For the basics I don't have any issues at all - email, internet, excel and word stuff etc. The ONLY reason I am thinking about a bump up is when I go to download either a huge number of photos and edit them or when I am creating DVDs. I know the additional memory may not actually cause the burn of the dvd to occur faster, nor do I care that much - I run it before I head to bed. But the editing, dumoing of a lot of video, comes to a crawl at times. I figured especially if I only do about 2gb for $50.00 if it helped it would be worth it. so given that, sorry for the additional question but do you think at least bumping to 2gb would help? and if so are you saying that might but then beyond 2gb is just overkill, especially with an older processor etc. thanks again for your help

The DVD render took 6 hours on the machine with 512MB RAM. The 1GB machine did it 5 minutes faster. We couldn't believe the results so we swapped RAM and re-ran the tests. Same results. You are asking for speed so this is not where to get it as you are already at 1GB and have XP (not Vista which would change my answer.) Bob
