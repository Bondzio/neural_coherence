<s> I am pretty new to this stuff so I am hoping someone is able to help me out with my problem. </s>
<s> I recently installed a new dvd burner into my system and while it does a good job of making backups the speed leaves something to be desired. </s>
<s> When it first starts to burn it will go up to 3x speed but quickly drop then level off to around 1.6. </s>
<s> Doesnt matter if its DL discs or single layer, and I have tried different brands of media. </s>
<s> I did change it from being the slave drive to the master on the second ide but it didnt change anything at all. </s>
<s> Here is all the info that I can think of that might be useful Programs used:dvd decrypter and dvd shrink DVD burner: BenQ 1640 CD-R: 48X CD-ROM Access Time: 120ms CD-RW: 32X DVD+R: 16X DVD+R DL: 8X DVD+RW: 8X DVD-R: 16X DVD-ROM Access Time: 120ms DVD-RW: 6X computer: 750mb ram, 2.6 pentium, 40gb ibm drive. </s>
<s> could it be the hd? </s>
<s> i think it is my systems weakest link. </s>
<s> I look at the media speed, then set the recorder software to 1/2 that. </s>
<s> I rarely see a coaster. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
<s> OK, you have changed brands of DVD media. </s>
<s> What about the speed rating on the discs? </s>
<s> Are you using 16X media? </s>
<s> What I Use: Nero Ultra 6.6 software will run a burn simulation to test the media at a selected speed before burning. </s>
<s> The downside--it's expensive. </s>
<s> Check to see if DMA is enabled on the drive. </s>
<s> It is possible that even if it is, the drive only supports DMA33 which will limit transfer speeds and subsequently write speeds. </s>
<s> Did you buy the drive new or used? </s>
<s> Did it come with any type of burning program with it? </s>
<s> The drive was brand new and came with Nero. </s>
<s> The media I have been using is Verbatim 6x for the dl discs and tdk for the single layer discs. </s>
<s> Both burn at 1.6x I tried memorex but they were junk discs. </s>
<s> Many dual layer drives could not attain higher speeds &quot;out of the box&quot; or new. </s>
<s> The owners had to update the firmware. </s>
<s> -&gt; The same story plays out in ROUTERS, MOTHERBOARDS and other devices. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the suggestion but I actually did flash the firmware of the new drive when I first got it, maybe I can dbl check and make sure it worked. </s>
<s> Nero comes with a Drive info tool that will rate the speed of the drive. </s>
<s> Check out whether or not for some reason the drives speed has been reduced from it's rated speed. </s>
<s> Other than that you can check out a few websites (cdfreaks comes to mind) where you can check out the rated write speeds of various discs. </s>
<s> Some are rated for a much higher speed than they will ever attain. </s>
