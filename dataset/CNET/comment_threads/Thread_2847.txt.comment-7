The Atom processor will probably be around the same speed as the Pentium M ULV.
The RAM in the netbook is probably faster than what you've got in the laptop, and the SSD will be faster in the long-term as fragmentation doesn't bother it (and Windows loves to get fragmented...).
I can't say whether MS Office 2007 will run well - I use Linux.
But Openoffice.org is reasonably snappy on my Aspire One (same specifications but lower RAM as your prospective netbook).
If there is a speed improvement, it won't be by much.
If you really want a little more speed, you'd be better off looking at a proper notebook.
HP has a notebook that uses an AMD Neo processor - it's like an ultraportable but only about twice the price of a netbook - that I'm thinking of upgrading to, it might be a good option for you if you want the portability.
