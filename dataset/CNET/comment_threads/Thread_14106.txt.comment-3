The PSU is indeed second hand, and from help from someone on another forum I have found that the Graphics card needs a 22A 12V Rail and this one only has around 17Amps.
So looks like its a mistake on my part.
Now I am thinking its the PSU it does seem like the symptoms I am describeing are to do with lack of power.
Thanks for your help Steven!
I'll keep this forum posted on my progress, I am looking at ordering a 22Amp 12Vrail 500Watt PSU now.
Tom.
