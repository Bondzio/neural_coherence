ok, first my specs: sony vaio w/ 3.6 ghz p4 w/ht (560j prescott) 1 gig of 3200 ddr ram (400 mhz) asustek motherboard model ptgd2-vx xfx 7600 gt video card 256 gddr2 mb pcie (590 mhz core) 2 sata 250 gb hd's @ 7200 rpm i bought this pc about 2 years ago, but am now wondering if it's time i upgrade or if i should wait.. i currently use my pc for music composition and internet.. but intend to also start playing a new game coming out called &quot;supreme commander&quot;.. after running 3dmark06, my pc only scored a 3350 on the overall tests.. if i do buy a new pc, i do want to see improvement in overall system performance, such as day to day stuff -- but also, in gaming as well.
i'm a little confused as to whats what these days, intel has come out with several new cpu's since this one came out.
the core 2 duo is a bit confusing as they advertise as 1.87, 2.13, and so on.. and if they are truely faster, i'm very uncertain how much faster.. although, i do know my fsb is not as fast, nor is my memory speed, which is only 400 mhz and i believe the top is around 667 mhz at the moment.. i'm not looking to plunk down $5000 for a new system, so alien-***** is out... would appreciate any suggestions you guys might have.
thanks
