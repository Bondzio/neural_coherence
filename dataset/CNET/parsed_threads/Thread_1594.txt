<s> Will PC2100 ram run on a PC3200 motherboard? </s>
<s> My first inclination is to say no, but check your manual or check the Mfg. </s>
<s> website for the specification for your mptherboard model number. </s>
<s> WHY? </s>
<s> Don't cut corners on memory. </s>
<s> Memroy and FBS, not CPU, dictates how fast your system is. </s>
<s> (don't flame..CPU speed is part of the equation, but I've seen systems w/Slow CPUs' smoke faster CPUs' due to the M/B and memory) See http://www.aceshardware.com/Spades/read.php?article_id=5000186 Old but still prevelant Bill </s>
<s> your CPU will not run at its rated speed. </s>
<s> i do not think so, it is incompatible, the clock may be differnet. </s>
<s> i think ur new bar of ram will be fried to delicious ram fries, yum, i am hungry. </s>
<s> set the memory bus to any of the lower memory speeds below the maximum. </s>
<s> If he were to leave it set for 400 MHz and plugged in the PC2100 [133/266], yes the system would fail to boot immediately. </s>
<s> If he [she?] </s>
<s> were to first change the BIOS to the 133/266 memory bus speed, it likely will work fine. </s>
<s> Of course, the CPU will not run at its maximum speed. </s>
<s> [called underclocking] </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Yes it is possible, it depends on your MOBO. </s>
<s> If you are getting something like a DELL then you might not have this option. </s>
<s> In your BIOS you will need to find your memory properties. </s>
<s> You need to set it to DDR266 look for memory speed: AUTO or LIMIT or simply DDR400/333/266/200. </s>
<s> As an overclocker, this can come in very handy if you know how to use it. </s>
<s> GOOD LUCK </s>
