1.1.1	Hello , I 'm looking for a good quality photo printer ( 5 or more colors ) that will print on many types of media and up to 13x19 paper .	St
1.1.2	I 've read the CNET editor recommendations , but I wo n't buy another Epson Stylus due to all the problems I 've had with mine , the printer where I work , and those that my sister has experienced .	St
1.1.3	Canon 's i9900 looked promising until I discovered one must use only Canon paper ( how realistic is that ! ? ) .	St
1.1.4	I would appreciate any suggestions as I am completely without a printer now ( the Epson Stylus 1280 I have has quit after three years of light use ) .	St
1.1.5	Thank you for any suggestions !	St
1.2.1	I too got fed up with the Epson .	St
1.2.2	I had two that failed after a short time with a printhead issue .	St
1.2.3	I switched to HP in order to avoid that .	St
1.2.4	If you want to be able to print 13x19 , there will be fewer choices .	St
1.2.5	While I do not have one of these , here is a link to a review of one : http : //www.steves-digicams.com/2005_reviews/hp8750.html Also , PhotoSmart printers can print directly from the camera , media or computer and this one ( HP 8750 ) has built in network capabilities .	St
1.2.6	Of course with the capablility to print 13x19 pictures , you have to expect a pricetag that is hefty also .	St
1.3.1	Thank you for your suggestion .	St
1.3.2	I 'm checking into it !	St
