14697	0	244728	2469399	NR	chf54	4/25/07 9:43 AM	1.17749418E12	Need a non 2.4GHz router recommendation	I am looking for help to resolve a home networking 2.4 GHz interference issue. I am currently using an IBM Thinkpad T42 with 11a/b/g Wireless LAN Mini PCI Adapter II, Linksys WRT54G router (channel 6), have a cordless 2.4 GHZ phone and a wireless video camera system that transmits at 2.4 GHz. When the camera is in use the wireless network is completely non functional. I cannot change the camera, could change the phone and or router. I'm considering the Linksys WRT55AG dual band router or Belkin Wireless Pre N Router. Would appreciate any comments on these 2 routers or any other router suggestions. Thanks
