1.1.1	In one graphics forum I visit , someone had said that if you have a second hard drive in your computer , and you do not install any operating system files on that drive and just put your files on it ( my case would be word and excel files , graphics , and an user created game content ) , that should you get a virus on the main drive , it would n't harm your documents on the slave .	St
1.1.2	Is this true ?	Ques
1.1.3	I 'm curious since Office Max is having a really good sale on some drives this week and wanted to know if it 's worth the drive to the store for a look .	St
1.1.4	Thanks in Advance	St
1.2.1	Today 's pests do n't stop at drive C. Bob	St
1.3.1	I use Folder Lock on my all my other drives and important folders , but that would not stop a virus or other Spyware from getting into my other drives or folders when opened .	St
1.3.2	( Folder Lock is a very good utility to purchase . )	St
1.3.3	http : //www.newsoftwares.net/folderlock/ ? id=ew I try to make it a habit to run my security tools on drive C : and shut down my internet service before I open any off the other drives .	Sug
1.3.4	When I run Ad-Aware , Nortons Antivirus , Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal tool , all off them checks all drives .	St
1.3.5	Go get that extra drive : Good Luck Wendell H	St
1.4.1	I have several external hard drives , but before I put anything on them from one of my internal hard drives , I disconnect from the internet , run a couple of anti-virus programs & spyware programs before transferring any data to my external hard drives .	St
1.4.2	My external hard drives are only turned on once a month or less often Even doing that there is no guarantee that my Anti-virus and spyware programs picked up everything .	St
1.5.1	Sorry but if you have any files related to a virus it will find it no matter what drive it is on , including and not limited to USB drives .	St
1.5.2	Backup all data you wish to keep on CD/DVD and then you will not have to worry about virus infecting your files .	St
1.6.1	A second hard drive wo n't protect your files .	St
1.6.2	There have been viruses that purposely seek out files with a particular extension such as .doc , .xls , etc .	St
1.6.3	and either infect them or delete them .	St
1.6.4	There was one virus years ago that would seek out .mp3 's and delete them ( lets just hope the music people do n't get their hands on that one ) .	St
1.6.5	The best protection is a backup to a CD-R/RW or DVD-R/RW .	St
1.6.6	Make sure your virus protection and spyware protection is fully updated and you will be fine .	St
1.6.7	The only thing a second hard drive protects you from is the loss of files when the O/S drive either needs to be reloaded or dies completely .	St
1.6.8	I have had to help recover files on many friends computers because they saved their photos and personal files to the C : \ drive and then the boot partition got corrupted or the drive up and died .	St
1.6.9	After paying my bill many of them added a second drive or external and started doing backups .	St
1.6.10	I say get the second drive but still think about keep backups on a more permanent media .	St
1.6.11	Primitive man had it right ... .backups were carved in stone .	St
1.7.1	I have my backups stored on an external drive which is switched off at normal computering .	St
1.7.2	To me it seems that is a fine firewall to virusses .	St
1.7.3	Am I right ?	Ques
1.7.4	Max	St
1.8.1	I always had an infected ( you would n't believe how infected ) OS but all the files that were put on my D drive are A-OK .	St
1.8.2	I have no antivirus , no firewall , no nothing .	St
1.8.3	Anyway , most crap disturb the Windows directory and the registery so if I were you I would not worry .	St
1.9.1	Some virii can & quot ; lurk & quot ; in the background , and just wait until other files are available .	St
1.9.2	When you turn on the drive so you can access it , so can the virus !	St
1.10.1	1 ) You are asking for troubles by not having an AntiVirus or a FireWall .	St
1.10.2	2 ) With no protection available Viruses can move around and therefore a 2nd HD is not the guarenty .	St
1.10.3	3 ) It happened to me , I have two SATA HDs , the Virus hit my second SATA Drive 4 ) The best protection is YOU , do not let anybody use your computer and if they do , do not ever let them use their own floppies or CDs , and check every removable media before you operate it or run it .	St
1.11.1	there are so many things wrong with this that i am not sure where to begin .	St
1.11.2	no AV , no firewall ? ? ?	Ques
1.11.3	what system are you running and how is it running ? windows OS ?	Ques
1.11.4	on a 56k or some sort of broadband connection ( God forbid ) is your machine one of the zombies that tries to crack mine at least 3or 4 times a day ?	Ques
1.11.5	there is a reason why the rest of us run firewalls , proxies spend huge amounts of time ( and money , sometimes ... ESPECIALLY IN CLEANING UP THE AFTERMATH OF A SECURITY BREACH ) .	St
1.11.6	there is a saying out there , & quot ; if you are not part of the solution then you are part of the problem & quot ; .	St
1.11.7	as we speak my firewall deflects yet another helkern attack .	St
1.11.8	if i go to my firewall records i can find thirty or forty instances from the past few days , of this same attack , by about 7 or 8 different IP's.several different machines who 's owners are probobly blissfully unaware that their machines are being remotely used to try to subvert others out there , along with mine .	St
1.11.9	they might have been just like yourself , criminally irresponsible in leaving the armory ( your PC ) sitting there wide open and unlocked ( no firewall , IDS , AV ) so that joe cyber-terrorist ( aka joe script kiddie ) can run his programs on your machine every time it connects to the internet and use your processing power , bandwidth and information etc etc to snipe at the rest of us .	St
1.11.10	please , for your own sake and that of any one else out here , protect us all and lock up yer damn gun !	Sug
1.11.11	as for the fella whose question you were trying to answer , if the file system canbe accessed by the infected computer ( a live connection of any sort ) than it can be affected , if the virus/worm/trojan is targeted at that file type.i guess i would have to say that some sort of inert media is your best bet for secure data storage ( floppy/cd/etc ) .
