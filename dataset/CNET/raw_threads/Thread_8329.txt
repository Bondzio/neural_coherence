I have a dvd of an event I did a few weeks ago and I wanted to reproduce them to send to my sponsors. How do I do that using my Mac computer (intel based)? I'll appreciate an immediate feedback. Thanks!

You should also be able to use the Disk Utility to make an image of the original DVD, provided that it is not a commercial encrypted DVD. Once you have made the image, you can reproduce as many copies as you want using the Finder as the burning software. If you need further help, just holler. PP
