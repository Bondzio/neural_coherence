<s> ok i need an expert opinion.. </s>
<s> I'm building a new comp strictly for gaming and i cant decide on a CRT or an LCD.. ive read good things about some LCD's such as the Samsung 226BW but i just am not sure if this is what i want to get. </s>
<s> I've always played with my resolutions in the past at 1024x768 and I'm worried that an LCD with a big resolution is going to be way to different for me. </s>
<s> If someone could advise me on whether to purchase an LCD or a CRT it would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> By the way i will be running this monitor on an 8800GT, thanks. </s>
<s> if you have the money, you should go with an LCD for sure. </s>
<s> But if you are a bit tight on budget, i suggest saving up and buying an LCD later, instead of buying a CRT right now. </s>
<s> I saved a ton of money by switching to LCDs. </s>
<s> Seriously. </s>
<s> If you look at your average 19inch CRT wattage and your LCD even at 20+ inches you find it's less than 1/2 the power. </s>
<s> At the office this is enough to pay the difference off in less than a year. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ok well would it be ok for me if i will plan to play games such as CoD4, Crysis, etc. </s>
<s> I just dont want the resolution to be so big that i lose performance based on the resolution size. </s>
<s> Like i said ive always used 1024x768 and the 226BW's native resolution is like 1600 by something.. </s>
<s> At home I gifted the old 17's and 19's out, LCDs are in and it shaved a 20 off the monthly bill. </s>
<s> Payback is still at one year for the diff. </s>
<s> Here the games never ghost or such so I guess we're good. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You can set the resolution to what you like. </s>
<s> But native is usually the best. </s>
<s> What I did. </s>
<s> I have a 19&quot; wide screen. </s>
<s> I found a 22&quot; wide screen. </s>
<s> When I got it home I found out that my Intel graphics card supported about a gazillion resolutions. </s>
<s> But not the one specific to the new 22&quot;. </s>
<s> Specifically, it supported resolutions above and below the new LCD, but not the exact one. </s>
<s> Bummer. </s>
<s> I took it back. </s>
<s> I too found out that the majority of Intel and ATI adapters don't support non-standard modes. </s>
<s> Intel has some technical googly **** on their site about issues with hardware/firmware/software compatibility and offers a non-standard driver which won't install on most laptops, including Centrino platforms! </s>
<s> Why can't Intel and ATI make video products with simple user customizable driver modes like Nvidia's? </s>
<s> I didn't return my 1680x1050 22&quot;. </s>
<s> I just dumped Intel and ATI and switched to Nvidia. </s>
<s> I can't count how many times I've fixed this by installing a monitor.inf file. </s>
<s> I also know that most are only owners and won't know about this. </s>
<s> Said file does not come from ATI or Intel but the display maker. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I knew that but didn't think about it. </s>
<s> Rats. </s>
<s> Monitor not on sale any more. </s>
<s> Maybe Santa will be good to me. </s>
<s> Not for the reason that monitor infs help, but because my dock doesn't support non-standard rez. </s>
<s> Monitor infs can't fix what's not in the adapter infs; they only serve to hide the modes that a monitor cannot display and therefore eliminate issue of overdriving. </s>
