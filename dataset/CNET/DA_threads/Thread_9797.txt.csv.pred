1.1.2	And yes the best steps to do this would be nice .	Res
1.1.3	CC	St
1.2.1	Norton Ghost .	St
1.2.2	Acronis True Image .	St
1.2.3	The new hard drive will have cloning software if it 's a full retail version .	St
1.3.1	Thanks	Polite
1.4.1	Acronis True Image ... ..your hard drive must be in working condition for this to work .	St
1.4.2	Like other issues , it is best done when everything works .	St
1.4.3	I recently installed a Western Digital 1 terrabyte drive and the cloning software that came with it was not compatible with Windows Home Server or Windows Vista or Apple 's OS .	St
1.4.4	Carbon Copy for Apple OS .	St
1.4.5	Again , your drive needs to be working .	St
1.4.6	If you have errors in your hard drive , they will not be corrected by cloning .	St
1.5.1	Go to harddrive manufactures web site and download their free program	St
1.6.1	The onlyOne that does it is ShadowProtect Desktop 3.x even to & quot ; Bare Metal & quot ; base .	St
1.6.2	Google it !	St
1.7.1	i had this dilemma not long ago , and after reading up on the easiest FREE way to mirror my drive , this program won .	St
1.7.2	i can not stress enough how simple it is to use this program .	St
1.7.3	worked flawlessly .	St
1.7.4	jim	St
1.8.1	I 've used the free version of HDClone to upgrade several PC 's and laptops to larger drives with no problems .	St
1.8.2	You can download it from their site .	St
1.8.3	You install it to a floppy or CD then boot the computer from the floppy/CD that has the original and the new ( has to be larger ) drive attached .	St
1.8.4	Menu system walks you through it all .	St
1.9.1	I 'd stay away from Norton , Acronis True Image is a pretty good choice , but you should consider also WinHex .	St
1.9.2	All you need is the old ( bad ) HDD , and the new one , both hooked up to a computer running WinHex and you 're set .	St
