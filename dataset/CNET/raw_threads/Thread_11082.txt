NEW YORK (AP) -- A teenager in New Jersey has broken the lock that ties Apple's iPhone to AT&T's wireless network, freeing the most hyped cell phone ever for use on the networks of other carriers, including overseas ones. The New Jersey teen collaborated online with four other people to develop the unlocking process. George Hotz, 17, confirmed Friday that he had unlocked an iPhone and was using it on T-Mobile's network, the only major U.S. carrier apart from San Antonio-based AT&T that is compatible with the iPhone's cellular technology. While the possibility of switching from AT&T to T-Mobile may not be a major development for U.S. consumers, it opens up the iPhone for use on the networks of overseas carriers. &quot;That's the big thing,&quot; said Hotz, in a phone interview from his home in Glen Rock. The phone, which combines an innovative touch-screen interface with the media-playing abilities of the iPod, is sold only in the U.S. Calls to AT&T and Apple for comment were not immediately returned.

Apple signed a contract with AT&T saying that for two years or more, they wouldn't create another version of the iPhone for any other celluar carrier in the U.S. They can't really do anything about it. But now people are going to try to profit from this, I am sure. But why use T-Mobile? Sure, the iPhone doesn't have 3G, and T-Mobile doesn't either, but AT&T has a faster network. It'd be easier to switch anyway. This is pointless. Who would want to unlock it anyway? Oh well. I prefer Sprint anyway. -BMF

Specifically for data, 1xRTT (dial-up equivalent) and more and more, 1xEv-DO (broadband equivalent)... same with Verizon Wireless - so the iPhone can't get to those networks at all. Real News would be getting an Apple iPhone on CDMA (and 1xEv-DO).

Now who do I complain to that my phone doesn't work? P

US cell phone providers hate giving up any control of the bill to the user. Since the iPhone is GSM... unlocking it does not effect the american market, so much as it will soon be going overseas in larger and larger numbers. Buy a SIM card in Paris, London, or Berlin... and talk away on whichever service you want. The competition makes for cheap rates.

I can't honestly say it's better because I've been using CDMA for many years. About the 350 Z. Why get that when you could get, oh I don't know, a Ferarri or a GT? Personally, I prefer old '68 Mustangs, but he'll probably customize it in some good way. Why get three iPhones? That's dumb. Whatever LOL. -BMF
