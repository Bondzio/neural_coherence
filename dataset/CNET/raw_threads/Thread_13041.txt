The most likely thing to me is a hardware issue. Replacing the wireless card in the laptop would probably solve that. The dv6000 series has a rather bad reputation. It could well be that you have to replace the whole motherboard. But there's a small chance it's a software issue also. The means to research that aren't pleasant either: 1. Boot from a Linux Live CD and see if that connects wirelessly. 2. Back to factory settings using HP's system recovery options. I'd start with contacting HP Customer Support and see if they can talk you through their standard diagnostics. If it's a hardware issue indeed, still having warranty might make a big difference in total costs to solve this. Kees

Find a local shop that lets you return it if it doesn't work for some reason and they can't fix it. An Ethernet-connectable antenna is considered better, but bigger and surely much more clumsy if you transport the laptop. Kees

Proffitt	7/17/10 4:57 AM	1.27934262E12	I've fixed more than one dv2000	The internal wifi card is in a word &quot;weak.&quot; It fails but I find the owners to not accept this answer. You must give them time to reload the OS a few dozen times and wait for them to search for drivers. In about 1 to 6 months they finally cave and you can remove the internal wifi card and slip in some wifi PC-CARD to take over. Bob

Having had this discussion some hundred times I can only share the story about how most will not accept the diagnosis. Many will run back home to reload the OS, post on forums and search for drivers to correct the failing card. To make it more fun the card may spring back to life for a time almost as if it is taunting the owner. I've found that all I can do is share the story and wait for the owner to give up trying to save the internal card. But you may wonder why I no longer replace the internal card. It's very simple. Ready? It only fails again and then the shop is on the hook to replace it. Since we know this we refuse to replace the card and offer only one fix. It's noted above. Bob

4496	7	401716	3340531	3340530	R. Proffitt	7/17/10 10:31 AM	1.27936266E12	Your choice.	The story repeats on quite a few models so you know to give the owners time to digest the problem. Funny you write &quot;fix the wireless card&quot; as I've yet to see anyone do that. Unless you meant &quot;replacing&quot; is the same as &quot;fixing.&quot; I tend to think fixing a card means pulling it out and replacing a component or soldering a bad joint. But this issue is fairly well known and so are the cures. Bob

How did you get W7 installed? Fresh onto bare metal or upgrade from Vista? 2. &quot;starting from today&quot; means it worked with W7 and then it stopped working? Or it never worked with W7 at all? 3. If original OS was Vista, did wireless work and connect properly? fyi, it seems HP does not support W7 on certain older models.

4496	15	401716	3341016	3340959	samkh	7/18/10 3:15 PM	1.2794661E12	Then	your only choice is to use the add-on wireless adapter. Since HP didn't provide the W7 wireless driver, even though Intel had theirs pkg'd in W7, there's no assurance HP's BIOS can serve it reliably. Apparently it did so for awhile, then quit.

I think that this may be the problem so i tried to start the service but i get the error that says &quot;windows couldnt start wlan autoconfig on local computer. error 1068: the dependency service or group failed to start&quot; someone suggested to change the registry value of [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Ndisuio]&quot;Start&quot; to 2 which i also did and restarted but still nothings changed.. Does anyone know how to make it so i can start the WLAN Autoconfig service?

I know that may not sit well with many but today I'm running into machines that take days to repair if the OS took a hit with malware, trojan or even &quot;the user.&quot; FORGET DEPENDENCIES!!! Push all services back to default. You will lose too much time trying to cater to an owner that wanted a customized set of services running. PUSH it back to stock. Google BLACK VIPER SERVICES to find tables of the stock settings. Bob
