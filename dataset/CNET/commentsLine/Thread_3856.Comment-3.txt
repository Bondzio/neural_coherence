most of these fans are quiet and generally run regardless.
however, they do &quot;auto-sense&quot; the temp and will turn-on and work if idled.
there's nothing to keep from general cleaning by using an air can to blow any dust bunnies.
if able to more directly access the fan, do that as well.
if you find the fan has actually stopped or not working, replace with similar fan.
since, you're already thinking a cooling pad, get that asap.
it will help if the fan is iffy operation until fixed.
if this laptop is older as you've mentioned, then maybe wear&tear finally caught-up with the fan, replace it why leave thought.
