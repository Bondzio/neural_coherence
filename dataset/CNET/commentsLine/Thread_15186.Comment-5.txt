thank you again for your response.
that gives me a good place to start.
i don't plan on selling an dvd's (though that could be a good business opportunity!
); it is more for family/friend purposes.
i will be making the slideshow for my upcoming wedding with the software, and may do the same for other friends getting married soon.
i'm at the age where our families start to grow, too, so i'm sure i can use the software to chronicle those memories as well.
if a business springs out of it, great!
i did consider apple, but i really want to stick with a pc.
i can't stand using microsoft office on a mac... and i will be using that fairly frequently as well.
i think the software i have will be more than adequate for my purposes and should be fine on the pc.
thanks for that suggestion though.
again, thank you for the input and i will get to looking around.
much appreciated!
