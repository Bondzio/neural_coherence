i figured out the issue with the ram and the new video card.
i needed to update my bios to work with them.
once i upgraded to a11 it worked perfect!!
i had a little interesting time flashing the bios since i had window 7 x64.
but i had an extra hdd that had 32 bit windows xp, plugged it in, ran the flash and perfecto, it worked.
today is going to be a good day, i can feel it.
