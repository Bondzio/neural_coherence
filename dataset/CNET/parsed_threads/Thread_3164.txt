<s> I have a Dell Vostro 1500 and I have AT&T wireless internet in my house. </s>
<s> My other computers and Roku connect with no problem, but mine even though it says it is connected, is not connected. </s>
<s> I have Windows XP the other computer is Vista and the desktop is also XP. </s>
<s> Even AT&T came over the house and said something is wrong with the computer. </s>
<s> Can anybody help me. </s>
<s> What makes you think it is not connected? </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Because you cannot connect to the internet. </s>
<s> Does the connection icon happen to say something about &quot;limited or no connectivity&quot; if you hover your mouse above it? </s>
<s> In that case, it looks different from how it normally looks when there is a full connection? </s>
<s> Two related things to check: 1. </s>
<s> Does the router management page show it as connected? </s>
<s> What IP-address? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> What does ipconfig (run it from the command prompt) exactly say about the IP-address of the PC, the gateway and the DNS? </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> yes it says it is fully connected. </s>
<s> It looks like it is connected to a old network that does not even work. </s>
<s> I can't figure out how to get it to connect to the correct one. </s>
<s> Go into your wireless configuration utility. </s>
<s> Remove that old network. </s>
<s> Only keep the networks you need in the right sequence. </s>
<s> XP comes with a standard program for that. </s>
<s> However, quite a few makers add their own on top or as a replacement. </s>
<s> So I can't tell you how it works on your PC. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Thanks but how do you do that? </s>
<s> I have been trying but it keeps on popping up. </s>
<s> for the initial setup of the password for the connection. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Thanks but now I have a new problem. </s>
<s> I am getting a Stop error message. </s>
<s> A blue screen I can't get passed when the computer starts up. </s>
<s> It will not even let me go into the safe mode. </s>
<s> Now I am really. </s>
<s> What would cause this happen? </s>
<s> I never seen a computer with so much problems. </s>
<s> My others are HP's and even though they are not perfect they are next to this. </s>
<s> Help. </s>
<s> Two questions: 1. </s>
<s> What did you change to get into this condition? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> What's the error number (something like 0x0000005E or so) on this blue screen (appropiately called a BSOD: blue screen of death). </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Thank god I was able t fix it I had to relaod the OS from the disc. </s>
<s> Now I have to figure out how to get this computer to connect to my network. </s>
<s> It is brand new and I cannot even find the wireless connection </s>
<s> In your other thread my colleague Grif suggested loading drivers from another CD. </s>
<s> And you mentioned something about using a Dell disc to load the OS to an HP CD. </s>
<s> So you should mention much more detail on what exactly you did. </s>
<s> Maybe better start a new thread in Computer Help, because clearly this is - as you already stated yourself - a new problem. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Hi I actually found the disc for the Dell. </s>
<s> I was able to get the computer up and running. </s>
<s> I have a network 1394 for high speed and Lan. </s>
<s> I went to Hardware devices and that is the only thing I see for network devices. </s>
<s> I have three other discs. </s>
<s> One is for the Web cam one if for Cyberlink and one is drivers. </s>
<s> But this is something I noticed late last night before I was ready to throw the computer against the wall. </s>
<s> It seems like the power cord is connected to the problem. </s>
<s> Could that be possible? </s>
<s> I noticed that if I moved the laptop just a inch the wireless light came on for a second and if I took the cord out the screen got lighter not darker. </s>
<s> I cannot hold the cord in the in place to keep the wireless light on. </s>
<s> But I could see the wireless lights and the other lights on the side of the computer go off and on. </s>
<s> My original cord went kaput and I got a new one, not a dell one, but from Amazon, which stated the cord was compatible. </s>
<s> It seemed to work fine. </s>
<s> This problem with the wireless is new. </s>
<s> This computer is not my main computer but one I let my roommate use. </s>
<s> He has been having a hard time getting on the internet, this is what started this whole thing. </s>
<s> But I think it now is because something is up with the power cord. </s>
<s> Also when the blue screen came on it said it could be because a loss of power. </s>
<s> It seems the cord is ok just to turn the computer on and to charge it but it has to be moved around for the wireless light to come on. </s>
<s> Could that be it? </s>
