Trying to set up your usual file / printer sharing...simple nothing advanced... they are on the same network..at&t uverse router.... the problem I am having is that they simply do not see each other... I have enabled sharing on both computers, I have set them on the same Workgroup, firewalls are off, and I used the network setup wizard to setup both with the same options. Now usually this has worked for me on just about every computer I have worked on in the past.. for some reason, it won't work on these 2. when I go to &quot;add network place&quot; and input the local IP's, it just says &quot;the folder you entered does not appear to be valid. please choose another&quot;. when I navigate to the workgroup in my network places, neither computer sees the other one. I am able to ping them through CMD.. so I know it is not a hardware problem... It was working fine until I sent one of the computers out to have some spyware removed, when it got back I started having this issue... Could it be that something was deleted along with the spyware, which is keeping that computer from having the ability to be on a network? any ideas? thank you

Try changing to another workgroup name. If they still can't see each other, I would reinstall the nic drivers and fix tcpip-- http://support.microsoft.com/kb/811259 . Try this first on the computer that is suspect.
