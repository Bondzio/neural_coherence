Well I hooked up my old HD as a slave in the new machine and just moved the files over that way.
Now since that part is taken care of, I need to format my old hard drive and still buy an enclosure to mount it in so I can have a good backup system in place in case of any future problems.
What's the simplest way to format a drive and handle this task?
Can it be done while in the enclosure or will I need to hook up the old HD as a slave again in the new machine to do it?
