1.1.1	(My PC is getting more worthless every day.	St
1.1.2	Its an HP,with Windows XP Professional & an intel pentium 4 processor,it says it has 256 MB or RAM but that might be wrong.	St
1.1.3	The PC had a lot of problems and everytime we went it to get fixed it worked well for a short while then got even worse.	St
1.1.4	I also suspect that the people who &quot;fixed&quot; it used a fake/false copy of Windows because recently when I checked on the Microsoft site, it wasn't a genuine copy.	St
1.1.5	At first we said we would order a new copy but now we're thinking of just buying a new computer.	St
1.1.6	I really don't feel...right using a fake copy after we've spent so much money buying and &quot;repairing&quot; this PC I am a little fed up.)	St
1.1.7	--I like music and videos and I want a fast PC that has a lot of memory.	St
1.1.8	Can anyone help me?	Ques
1.2.1	many members would be happy to help I would look at this video guide: http://computer.howstuffworks.com/build-a-computer.htm If that looks like its for you, then I would suggest building your own If not, then I would suggest looking at Dell or Hewlett-Packard/Compaq (or maybe Apple, if you have no qualms about that (Apple would handle what you've described just fine, but OS X isn't for everyone)) Generally, the bottom shelf systems from Dell (as I recall its still a dual core Athlon64 x2 3600+, with something to the tune of 512MB or 1GB of RAM, and a hard-drive in the multi-hundred (I wanna say 250) gigabyte range with integrated graphics, all for about $399-$499 with some sort of monitor included (or offered at a discount)) will handle your described workload flawlessly If you are interested in building you own, look at www.newegg.com (also a good place to find Acer computers) and www.zipzoomfly.com for parts	St
1.3.1	You can't lose with either of these.	St
1.3.2	Velocity Micro has better customer support, more expensive too.	St
1.3.3	Call either company and they can set you up with what you need.	St
