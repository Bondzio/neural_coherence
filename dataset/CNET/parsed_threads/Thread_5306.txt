<s> I have run out of room on my laptop internal HD and am looking to get an external HD for myself. </s>
<s> I was told that I should probably get a 250 GB one since those are more reliable than the larger drives at this point. </s>
<s> I don't however know much about the differences in seek times, read times etc...nor do I know which brand to go with. </s>
<s> I would like to get one that is simple to set up and use, and that also comes with some kind of reliable backup program so that I can set up a backup task to run and then forget about it. </s>
<s> Also, can you tell me about things like reliability between brands and storage sizes? </s>
<s> Any and all information is welcome and thank you! </s>
<s> If you use your laptop mostly on the road, then you should probably get a portable external drive. </s>
<s> It doesn't need to be any larger than your laptop drive if it's for backup. </s>
<s> Lacie drives come with excellent backup software, including drive cloning software. </s>
<s> You could choose to carry a portable drive with your laptop that contains a clone of your laptop's internal drive. </s>
<s> I have two external hard drives connected to my desktop. </s>
<s> One uses a firewire connection to my desktop computer and Lacie's Silverkeeper software &quot;clones&quot; my desktop drive to that one. </s>
<s> Being firewire, it means that I could boot from it if necessary. </s>
<s> I also have a USB hard drive for storage of archived data, backing up my home folder (I'm paranoid about backups!) </s>
<s> and I will start keeping movies, music and pictures on it eventually. </s>
<s> Both drives are idiot-proof in that you just have to plug them into the wall, connect to the computer and turn them on and they're recognized by your computer. </s>
<s> You can then decide whether you want to reformat them for some reason. </s>
<s> Having only used Lacie drives, I do know that they come with pretty simple instructions if you want to do that. </s>
<s> Can you backup your data to DVDs ? </s>
<s> What's the basis for '250GB drives are more reliable than the bigger ones' ? </s>
<s> Best of my knowledge the 250GB 2.5&quot; laptop drive are brand new and have no real life reliability to report. </s>
<s> Best bang for the buck (GB) are the 3.5&quot; 7,200RPM HDDs with 3 or 5 year warranties. </s>
<s> You pick the enclosure of choice and install the drive. </s>
<s> Most of the prebuilt externals have only ONE YEAR WARRANTY. </s>
<s> You can get a 500GB for about $110. </s>
<s> Before you buy and put all your data on an external ...read the posts in STORAGE FORUM. </s>
<s> Lots of hiccups with external HDDs. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I have a number of 2&quot; external hard drives ranging from 20 to 120 GB and from a variety of manufacturers including Samsung, Fujitsu, Seagate and Toshiba. </s>
<s> All have been wholly reliable and each has been cobbled together by buying a hard disk and enclosure separately. </s>
<s> To help you make a choice I would recommend you take a look at Tomshardware.com which regularly reviews and compares all manner of computing hadrware. </s>
<s> In terms of back up software I have a DOS recovery CD that can access Firewire and USB storage and have Powerquest Drive Image 2002 (now taken over by Symantec and marketed as Norton Ghost). </s>
<s> I have a stable system configuration image with all my applications and then simply copy my personal files across at regular intervals. </s>
<s> If you have a technically minded friend or colleague they may be able to help compile a comparable DOS boot CD or a Bart PE boot disk. </s>
<s> Thank you all for your assistance. </s>
<s> I ended up having to go ahead and buy a new hard drive already as I had to get something for my data. </s>
<s> I ended up getting 2 250 gb Western Digital My Book Premium drives. </s>
<s> I have under 250 gb's and so, I am going to use one full time for my data and then, every month, update the second one with an exact copy of what is on the first drive. </s>
<s> If something fails in the drive that I am using, I will have a whole new hd waiting for me. </s>
<s> It cost a bit more, but that option was better than having one hd fail on me and then having to pay 1000 for hd recovery! </s>
<s> Can you all tell me more about Norton Ghost and how it works? </s>
<s> Nice choice of drives. </s>
<s> You must have some seriously heavy duty storage or I am still madly frugal with my space. </s>
<s> To the best of my knowledge both Ghost and Drive Image work in a Windows and DOS environments via GUIs (graphic user interfaces). </s>
<s> They create a series of image files no larger than 1 GB in size (DOS file size limitation) and various levels of file compression can be applied. </s>
<s> They both create and recover from these image files and can also be used for disk duplication (should you want to swap out a hard drive). </s>
<s> To use either program under DOS you will have to tweak the configuration files (config.sys & autoexec.bat) along with the addition of a few other files to get USB and firewire connectivity. </s>
<s> There is other imaging software available such as Acronis and if you look on the net there are even some freeware options available. </s>
<s> Given the value of data it is worth spending some money on something you feel will work. </s>
<s> Do a search on the web for Ghost and you will most likely get a very detailed overview of how it works and how well it works. </s>
<s> If you are keen on going the DOS route send a reply and I will try and give you some help with the configuration files. </s>
<s> Thank you for the tips! </s>
<s> I will probably go with ghost since it seems like a reputable program and one that cannot be too difficult to use. </s>
<s> Hopefully I will have all my files backed up soon! </s>
<s> I could not restore my Sony portable using Ghost as the hard disk has a recovery partition and Ghost could not cope with this. </s>
<s> Acronis True Image was easier to use and coped with the recovery partition without problem. </s>
<s> Nev </s>
<s> Nev, Just wondering if you were using Acronis True Image in Windows or DOS? </s>
<s> Also, which version of True Image do you use as it seems to have had quite a few upgrades in recent times. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Hi, I wanted to know which is a good external hard disk for movies,,, which Brand & cost would also b an extra info for me Pls reply to me at jefferson2389@gmail.com </s>
<s> is one that fits on your computer. </s>
<s> For Windows a USB-interface is fine, for Apple a Firewire-interface. </s>
<s> For a laptop, it's advisable it has it's own power supply (that's somewhat clumsy in use if you really want to use it at different places) or connect it via a powered USB-hub. </s>
<s> Even a 2&quot; disk inside could be too power-hungry for a laptop USB-slot (but, just as well, it might work flawlessly). </s>
<s> You might consider to buy the enclosure and the disk separately and put it in yourself. </s>
<s> Or you could buy an already assembled set. </s>
<s> For shops and prices: look around, either for a trusted local shop or a trusted Internet shop. </s>
<s> Whatever you prefer. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
