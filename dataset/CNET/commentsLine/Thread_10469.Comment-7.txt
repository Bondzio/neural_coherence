i bought an acers desktop on 12/15/09 for $900.00 only use it for 1 month and all of a sudden it won't turn on.
i've call tech support, they aks me to purchase a $20 driver from them to reboot.
i did buy the cd, reboot and still don't work.
i call again they said i have to ship it in to be fix.
it cost me another $20 to ship it.
i receive my computer back yesterday, still not work the same problem is still there.
i don't think technical support even fix it.
i've call again and they said to ship it back to them again.
acers is a bad choice to make, bad computer, bad company.
