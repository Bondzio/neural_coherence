thank you voodoodan, sounds like good advice.
when i get the time i will do that.
however, i have another question.
i'm not sure how to disable the integrated graphics card in bios.
i'll look around once i get my pcie card in place to see if that opens options for me.
oh!
also, is the card cleaner program a free download?
(well i guess that's two questions. )
thanks again.
i'll check back in to see if there's any other advice and let you know how it works out.
