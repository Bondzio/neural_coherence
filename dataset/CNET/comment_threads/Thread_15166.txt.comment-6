Do you use it for a backup or just when changing drives ?
Only thing I would be concerned about is there's no compression and just one copy to affect the restore.
I use Ghost and do image backups with it regularly.
to a second internal hard drive.
It's only weakness is no automatic incrementals.
After I do the backup to a second internal hard disk...I copy the backup images to an external and store it off site.
I'm a believer...backup or prepare for the heck that one will endure when your hard drive fails....not if..just when.
