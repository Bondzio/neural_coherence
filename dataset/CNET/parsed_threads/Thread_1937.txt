<s> Hi, I just bought an External DVD Burner, Plextor PX-716UF I think it's an external version of the PX-716A. </s>
<s> But I didn't read properly before I bought it and it seems this drive doesn't burn on '-R' DL DVDs only the '+R' DL disks. </s>
<s> I'm thinking of returning it because it is my understanding that '-R' even a '-R DL' disk is more friendly with commercial DVD players... Like if I burn something on a DL Disk I want to make sure it will work at home not just on my computer. </s>
<s> Is this correct? </s>
<s> If so can anyone suggest a burner I can buy when/if I return the Plextor PX-716UF? </s>
<s> Maybe a better burner with more capabilities? </s>
<s> Thanks in Advance! </s>
<s> ohh, I have a Macintish computer so whatever burner I get has to be Mac compatible. </s>

<s> Let me tell you Plextor has been no help... </s>
<s> I did actually update the firmware. </s>
<s> But here's the funny part, In some places on Plextor's website is says it does support DVD-R DL and in other places it says it does not support it. </s>
<s> I updated my firmware because thed update says it will burn DVD-R DL but then I emailed Plextor about it and the response I got was that the Drive does not do '-R DL' But you're right the Updated firmware says it does, only probelm is Plextor still says they don't. </s>
<s> They need to make up their mind about this. </s>
<s> I want to test it out myself but I can't seem to find DVD-R DL disks anywhere. </s>
<s> I think I'll have to order them online or something. </s>
<s> I'm been pummeled for adding a feature in some devices and causing web and printed content to go out of sync. </s>
<s> Just asking, why must you have DL DVD-R? </s>
<s> It seems odd since you can't find the media. </s>
<s> I did see DL DVD+R out there and my friend says it played fine on his players. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Downsizing...lol The reason I was looking for -R was that, it's my understanding that -R Media is more compatible with stand alone DVD players and such. </s>
<s> So I want to try what I can to make sure if I burn any videos they will play in most DVD players. </s>
<s> and I always thought +R worked, but -R worked better. </s>
<s> Is that wrong? </s>
<s> The issue here is that it all depends on the list of players you have to play with. </s>
<s> At first I found -R to play widely. </s>
<s> Now the list is reversed with more +R than -R. Here's why I know. </s>
<s> I have to keep a list of what type to send to who for demos. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
<s> Just go to Newegg.com and order the NEC. </s>
<s> Always sells for $40-$47 including shipping. </s>
<s> It burns all media except DVD-ram, and is rated close to 100% in customer reviews. </s>
<s> It burns at speeds up to 16x. </s>
