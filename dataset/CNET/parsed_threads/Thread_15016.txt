<s> I think my network may have an issue with contention. </s>
<s> It's only a small network servicing about 16 client machines but we keep getting timeouts as we use the web. </s>
<s> The ADSL line has been tested and the router, switch, filter, and wiring have all been changed but we still have the problem. </s>
<s> Does anyone know how I can test to see if it is contention or have any advice as to what it might be? </s>
<s> At 16 users I would expect this. </s>
<s> For example if just a couple users are watching video content all others may suffer. </s>
<s> Of if the others are downloading big files. </s>
<s> With only DSL and that many users they will have to learn to tap the web lightly. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> There's only 4 active users browsing the web etc. </s>
<s> The 16 machines/devices connected are 5 PCs, 6 VoIP phones, 2 servers (they are v. low use...not serving to the public), 1 printer, 1 mobile, and one occasional wireless user. </s>
<s> We have a 20mb &quot;BT business&quot; connection. </s>
<s> We don't regularly stream lots of content as this is our work connection so we are mainly browsing web pages and uploading/downloading files but most of the files are tiny (&lt;300k) and the ul/dl don't happen all day every day just occasionally. </s>
<s> Does that still seem like it's overuse to you? </s>
<s> I'm not sure what I should expect from this connection. </s>
<s> You just explained it. </s>
<s> The VoIP phones use hardly any bandwidth. </s>
<s> We only have two that are used with any regularity as most of what we do we do via email and sms. </s>
<s> We've had this number of phones connected before we had this problem (this problem is a recent occurrence, we have been running this setup for several years with a problem occurring only in the last few months). </s>
<s> To just let the ISP service your system? </s>
<s> It may be a few bucks but how much time are you losing here? </s>
<s> Sorry but having seen VOIP trouble I know to never discount it or its bandwidth. </s>
<s> The issue was not bandwidth but timeouts and missed connections. </s>
<s> I think your ISP should service you. </s>
<s> We've had the ISP (BT) look into the problem. </s>
<s> They did multiple line checks and swapped our hardware and came to the conclusion that the connection between us and the exchange is working fine. </s>
<s> The logs don't register any drops of service and running a ping test I could ping over 5000 packet with 0% loss (I stopped the test manually at 5000, it would have carried on doing more without fault I think). </s>
<s> The problem only manifests when we are using our browsers and get timeouts that can take several attempts to clear up and deliver the pages. </s>
<s> Look at the complaints about one example (there are many others.) </s>
<s> AVG's link scanner can cause such. </s>
<s> Your post is lacking in so many ways that I can't begin to list the thousand reasons why such delays happen. </s>
<s> But there is VOIP so I know that it can soak the network and cause a DNS to fail and game over. </s>
<s> The fix for that is up to you and your IT to work out with a dedicated DNS if that's it. </s>
<s> But I find folk that go into &quot;it can't be that&quot; mode and find it best to let them season for awhile. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> I wasn't actually ruling out VoIP just supplying further info as to why I was looking elsewhere (the VoIP having worked fine in the past with the same setup). </s>
<s> I've since read a bit about QoS so I'm going to see what QoS settings come as default with Trixbox. </s>
