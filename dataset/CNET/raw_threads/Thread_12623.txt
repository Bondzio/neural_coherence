I have researched their FSBs and they can run at a frequency of 1333Mhz. The motherboard has others it can at it's max is 1333Mhz and is the same rate as the Xeons frequency, also the motherboard can run quad-core chip sets. The LGA is the same as already indicated. I'm positive even though the CPU is a server CPU type that it will fit and run on a desktop motherboard. I'm I correct or is this impossible?

So that difference in the electrode is not critical it will work fine. That's good! I posted on other forums as well about this to get input and website references. I heard the Xeon is considered a core2 quad on yahoo answers by a person that replied.

But the difference between the xeon x3370 and the core2 q9650 are not very different at all. So in benchmarks for handling 3d applications like maya must be talking about the more workstation xeons for server boards that hardcore 3d animators use for their renderfarms. Thanks again, I think I may consider the q9650 over the xeon, the only difference is the microcode and L1 and L2 cache speeds. other than that I believe they are the same.
