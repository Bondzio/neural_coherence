1.1.1	-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I have Optiarc DVD RW AD-7170S and it is only reading DVD Rewritables .	St
1.1.2	I am using my video editing program , Premier Elements 7 .	St
1.1.3	I tried burning Taiyo Yuden DVD and does n't burn .	St
1.1.4	they used to work on that program .	St
1.1.5	I just updated the DVD driver of 1.3 version instead of old version of 1.00 .	St
1.1.6	Why is my DVD drives only burning rewritables ( RW ) and not Taiyo Uden , and other DVD anymore , is there away to change the settings.. .	St
1.1.7	cause I heard Taiyo Yuden are a great quality brand of DVD..	Polite
1.1.8	I used them for my customers , but now ca n't use them only Rewritables ( RW ) ?	Ques
1.1.9	Please help ?	Ques
1.2.1	Did you try a new DVDRW drive ?	Ques
1.2.2	That 's how I see if the problem is the aging drive or some software setting .	St
1.3.1	Yeah I have 3 other drives and tried all of them ... is there a setting that I change in the Optiarc 7170S to do DVD + and - and not just rewritables ... I emailed Optiarc just now , I am just hearing a respons efrom tghem possibly tomororw .	St
1.4.1	Batches of media .	St
1.4.2	If other media works you have proved this batch is not good for these drives .	St
1.4.3	Rare but it happens .	St
1.4.4	As to the setting .	St
1.4.5	After years of PC repairs I have yet to see such .	St
1.4.6	But I do see failed drives daily .	St
1.4.7	And owners that do n't want to change the drive but want it fixed .	St
1.4.8	Swapping the drive for a demo seems to only make them think we want to sell them a drive .	St
1.4.9	Someday I 'll find an easier way to get the old drive out and a new working one to them without all the haggling .	St

1.5.1	I agree with Robert , on many a CD/DVD drive issue when they do n't burn/R/W in some fashion .	St
1.5.2	My question is , & quot ; why did you update the firmware in the 1st place & quot ; ?	Ques
1.5.3	If it was to correct this problem or did you do it because it was there ?	Ques
1.5.4	If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it , is a highly wise decision for repair people .	St
1.5.5	In my experience as well , it 's far simpler and quicker to replace the problem drive with new or *known* good one in order to proceed .	St
1.5.6	the time and effort spend becomes practical then .	St
1.5.7	Understand wera & tear on drives become evident when used over a yr. or alot and newer drives are n't made as good as they used to , simply cheaper .	St
1.5.8	As noted the media itself if using some off brand bulk can be very unforgiving .	St
1.5.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
