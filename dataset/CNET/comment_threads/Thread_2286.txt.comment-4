I don't do many POS systems or terminals.
However, those that were done, suggest that the printer comes &quot;pre-loaded&quot; and was replaced.
I haven't seen one programmed out in the field.
The process maybe easy to do to transfer the logo, but not the make-up of the logo, so alot is in the air.
At best, you may get by with some &quot;text message&quot;.
On top of that some special s/w or standalone h/w would be needed to deal directly with the ptr.
at hand.
