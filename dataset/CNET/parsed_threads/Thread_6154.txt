<s> I upgraded my computer about an hour ago, by installing a Zotac gtx 650 Ti (drivers were installed correctly) and a a Rosewill RD600 Stallion Series psu. </s>
<s> computer worked as it is supposed to for a good 30 minutes. </s>
<s> However, when I entered a second game to test settings, my computer completely crashed. </s>
<s> No bluescreen or anything, it just instantly shut off. </s>
<s> Now when I simply turn the psu on my system makes the first sound it normally does when it boots, but then the cpu fan turns on to full blast. </s>
<s> No follow-on beeps, just the cpu fan running full speed. </s>
<s> I have never heard it this loud before. </s>
<s> I do not get any video output to my monitor, and the led on the power button of my case doesn't even light up, as if the computer isn't even turned on. </s>
<s> I upgraded this factory model from gateway DX4840-03e The specs for this system are -1 TB HDD -Intel i3 540 cpu running at ~3.1 Ghz -8 GB RAM Thanks in advance for the help. </s>
<s> When this happens I unplug the new video card, PSU and go back. </s>
<s> That way I can see if the original gear is still OK. Also, you can get out your Volt meter and check the CMOS Battery. </s>
<s> You want to read 3 or a little more Volts. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ok, when i go back, what can I do if it doesn't run well. </s>
<s> Is there any way to salvage it from there? </s>
<s> Go back to the old power supply and video card.. </s>
<s> If that works, replace the P/S first and I suspect it won't work. </s>
<s> The fan on the CPU comes on fast at first but should be reduced quickly when the BIOS loads, otherwise it will run at full speed. </s>
<s> This tells me the 5 volts has failed but the 12 volts is okay. </s>
<s> But I hope you won't be upset as it's the same as fixing any PC. </s>
<s> Find or guess the failed part, replace that. </s>
<s> Which is it? </s>
<s> If you knew each time, you've make a small fortune. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The problem was the power supply as mjd420nova suggested. </s>
<s> I'm not sure why. </s>
<s> I did find this http://www.cputopia.com/psu-replacement-gate-gateway-dx4840.html psu that is meant specifically for my model computer. </s>
<s> Would you recommend buying this? </s>
<s> The only reason I'm asking is because I'm skeptical about any other psu working with my mobo. </s>
<s> Was the one I just bought an isolated case? </s>
<s> It didn't look like a bad choice with it being SINGLE RAIL to avoid you learning about all that. </s>
<s> Next time, add 100 more Watts. </s>
<s> More power, arr arr arr! </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> That was right. </s>
<s> So was that an isolated incident with only that psu or will my computer reject every new one I try to install, for instance this http://www.cputopia.com/psu-replacement-gate-gateway-dx4840.html </s>
<s> Sorry, but can you explain to me what single rail means? </s>
<s> A single +12V RAIL means you don't need to check into if one or more rails could be overtaxed by your GPU or other choices. </s>
<s> You also don't have to take care for run the one rail to your GPU then the others to drives and such. </s>
<s> That's called balancing the rails, well discussed and most folk burst into flames when they find out about this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> How can you tell if a psu is single or multi rail? </s>
<s> Unless it says it somewhere in the product description and i missed it. </s>
<s> Look at the output ratings and if it's a single +12V rail you see one Ampere rating for the lone +12V. </s>
<s> If more you see them tell you the rating for each rail. </s>
