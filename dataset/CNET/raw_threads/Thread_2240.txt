I recently got the new Macbook and it is my first notebook. When I am not using it should I generally turn it off or leave it in sleep mode? Im not to sure if there are any differences to the hardiness of laptop HDD's over desktops. Reading online it seems that Laptop HDD's seem to be a litte more fragile. Also is there a problem with leaving the laptop plugged into the wall for extended periods even after it is done charging?

His cat ate the mouse when his computer was in the sleep-mode. http://img212.imageshack.us/img212/8417/newmouse7tl.jpg :) Personally, I leave my G4 on all the time and my Viewsonic Monitor goes into the so-called Sleep-Mode. Not my computer. I personally would shut off a laptop every time you close the cover. Why leave the thing on? Maybe Bob Proffitt can explain the difference on how PC Laptops and Mac Laptops work and how to treat them. I think Bob's son has a new Mac starting in to collage this year. I would love to purchase one of these dual-core laptops for my son also. :) -Kevin -Kevin

So, once the laptop has gone into sleep mode, the HDD is no longer spinning and everything is basically in a state of limbo. You should have no concerns about the &quot;fragility&quot; of the HDD, although they are smaller and appear less robust than their full sized counterparts, they are designed to withstand a little more &quot;abuse&quot; than a drive that will be forever fixed in a permanent position. I have an old iBook that sleeps for 80% of the time, with the drive shut down, It's about 7 years old and has the original drive. On the subject of leaving the machine plugged into the wall, not a problem. The Power Management circuit will ensure that a float charge will be applied to the battery, just to keep it tickled up, and push the rest of the power past the battery to the inner sanctum. It is a good idea to discharge the battery fully, once in a while (see the manual) and then plug it back in again. Just run it until it shuts itself down. Hope this helps P
