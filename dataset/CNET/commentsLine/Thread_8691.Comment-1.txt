i use nero6, the prog goes thru the hoops but when its time to begin the burn it ejects the blank dvd,this is for data as well as video.
i have tried other dvd authoring software on my pc but they all do the same thing.it burns cds just fine.
i have a hp media center pc m7357.
920 intel processor dual core, 1.5g ram, 300 gb hard drive and plenty of space.
i've tried a system recovery with no success.
everything else works just fine.
i have looked at numerous questions on the cnet but as usual every case is different.
any suggestions would be helpful.
