I don't need the Vista drivers; I downloaded and installed the Vista drivers on the Vista rig, and the printer is working fine on it.
The problem is with the XP laptops.
I have tried downloading the XP drivers for the printer and installing them on the XP laptops, but then when I try to connect to the printer over the network, I still get that driver message.
