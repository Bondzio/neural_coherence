I hooked it all up, and both the lcd moniter and tv wont show a picture, says nothing is connected. I dont know if my pc is missing some type of driver? Or not compatible with 2 moniters? I got 2 of these cables for free. Says on the cable (sonet) i looked it up and i could find cables, but not this one. Any help would be greatfull.

Connect just one display without the cable. Working? Ok, now try the splitter (just one display still.) No go? Then it's junk. Bob

Is there a box that i can hook pc vga to the box, then vga to the moniter, and tv. I think vga comes in better than avi. Any advice would help.

6147	7	205911	2205508	2204450	criminal58369	9/14/06 8:19 PM	1.15826514E12	hey	I am going to use it to play dvds from my computer, picture slideshows stuff like that, if i connect my computer directly to it i have to disconnect the moniter, im wondering if i get this how i will set it up, because on the lcd tv i have to set the windows text biger because its so small and i cant see it far away. I wonder how that would work, is there a way to use 2 gfx cards with vga or something?
