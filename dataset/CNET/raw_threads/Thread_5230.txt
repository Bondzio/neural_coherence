Yes, I refilled the individual color cartridges for several years and had no trouble. I let the printer set for 6 months(gave to son when bought another) and then it wouldn't print. Canon wanted 3x price of new printer - price had dropped considerably since I bought it - for new print head. As long as i used it - had no problem and saved a lot of money. The printer was great 600 dpi but wanted more dpi for photos. GN
