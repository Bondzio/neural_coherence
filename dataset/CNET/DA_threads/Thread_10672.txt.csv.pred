1.1.1	I just got a new LCD Samsung SyncMaster 930B I must say , I 'm fairly dissapointed at the fact that no DVI cable was included .	St
1.1.2	I was wondering if there was a big difference between DVI and analog .	St
1.1.3	Also , how can I check for any problems on my monitor , such as dead pixels etc .	St
1.1.4	I have noticed some backlight leakage when I set the screen black , is this a major issue ?	Ques
1.1.5	Where can I buy cheap DVI cables ?	Ques
1.1.6	The only ones I found are $ 170 Monster Cable ones .	St
1.2.1	I myself have never noticed the difference between analog and DVI .	St
1.2.2	But I have heard many people claim that there is a signifigant advantage to using DVI over analog .	St
1.2.3	I was wondering what your opinions were on this topic ?	Ques
1.3.1	I ca n't see the difference .	St
1.3.2	As to being disappointed , it 's odd to me since such is listed if its included .	St
1.3.3	But in today 's cut throat price as all costs war , nothing extra can be included .	St
1.3.4	Cheers , Bob	St
1.4.1	I saw a monster tv DVI cable for $ 170 and then I found this http : //www.anitec.ca/ ? mode=product_detail & pid=2300 & mcid=16 for $ 20 what makes the monster tv cable cost $ 150 more ?	Ques
1.4.2	I might just get the $ 20 , cause the price isnt that bad .	St
1.5.1	You have responses that write & quot ; ca n't see a difference & quot ; and yet you will expend 20 bucks plus shipping to repeat the experiment .	St
1.5.2	Why is that ?	Ques
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	It was a suggestion from a friend .	St

1.8.1	I took the DVI cable from my BenQ and used it on the Samsung , and saw no difference .	St
1.8.2	Im just going to stick with analog .	St
1.8.3	Is backlight leakage a big deal ?	Ques
1.8.4	Because it only shows up when the screen is black ...	St
1.8.5	I could return it if its a big deal as I bought from FS	St
1.9.1	Backlight leakage is most commented by those that do n't understand the technology .	St
1.9.2	Look what LCD displays are made of and how they are made and if you can make a leak free design , patent it .	St
1.9.3	Hope this helps .	St
1.9.4	Bob	St
1.10.1	Its just annoying knowing that it 's there but usually I do n't even notice it .	St

1.16.1	Ive got an NEC multisync LCD ... ..seemed to me , good computer ( Alienware ... Nvidia 6600gt ) good monitor ... ..yet after switching the included monitor cable ( you 'd think alienware would include it as well or at least offer it on there website ... ..regardless luv the thing anywayz ) either way made the trip to & quot ; Fry 's electronics & quot ; ( Las Vegas ... .based in California ) was like $ 60 .	St
1.16.2	switching back n forth ... .. & quot ; seemed & quot ; to me that the screen seemed to refresh or & quot ; pop & quot ; up faster WITH the DVI cable than wothout .	St
1.16.3	If indeed using a Utility , Movies or Gaming where it makes the most difference ( Clairity , Refresh ) then Definately GO DVI.If not applicable then save yourself a few bucks .	St
1.17.1	when I connected a cheap DVI to HDMI cable to our 50 & quot ; plasma by Pioneer .	St
1.17.2	The blacks were better and the picture is a wee bit sharper .	St
1.18.1	I have a Viewsonic VP201m monitor and I can easily see the diffenece between an Analog and DVI connection .	St
1.18.2	The DVI produces a MUCH crisper display .	St
1.18.3	Others apparently have different results , but I am sold on DVI .	St
1.18.4	Like you , I find it irritating that not all monitor manufacturers include the DVI cable .	St
1.18.5	I got an NEC monitor for my daughter and it only had the Analog cable .	St
1.18.6	I did find a good deal on DVI cables by looking on e-bay .	St
1.18.7	Some are as low as $ 8 including shipping costs .	St
1.18.8	Good luck .	Polite
