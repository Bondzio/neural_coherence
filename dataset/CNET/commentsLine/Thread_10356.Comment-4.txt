i used to like all the hawkins stuff since they sell lots of product designed for outdoor use and it is targeted at the consumer market.
this stuff is sold in retail stores so most people can find it.
it concerns me they have not offered a dual band router or newer product in a while.
maybe because they don't want to deal with the questions about difference in 5g antenna.
it has been a long while since i bought a router and used a external antenna.
because the cost of waterproof ap has come down so low i now directly mount these to the antenna and use ethernet cable into the house.
this saves both the cost of the microwave cable as well as the significant lose you get in this cable between the device and the antenna.
the challenge with any router that has external antenna is first to make sure you can remove them and second that they have the connector you need.
in general there are 2 types you will see on consumer routers.
of course they make adapters but they sure want a lot for a simple metal thing.
sorry can't pick a brand maybe someone else who has recent experience with routers with external antenna knows.
i really suspect like most wireless routers the radio part will be exactly the same and you could buy based on the other feature you need.
