<s> My computer has just been getting worse and worse lately. </s>
<s> I run AVG and ad aware scans regularly but it gets no better. </s>
<s> I think it's time to do what i've heard others do which is a system rebuild? </s>
<s> I just want to be sure that i wont screw it up so i would be really grateful if someone could give me a basic guide to rebuilding the software on my computer (drivers and OS etc.) </s>

<s> a complete reinstall of ALL your software or just the OS? </s>
<s> Your answer will dictate the &quot;basic guide&quot; you are asking for. </s>

<s> The operating system? </s>
<s> Model number? </s>
<s> Do you have a floppy drive? </s>
<s> A CD/DVD drive? </s>
<s> What type of &quot;Recovery Discs&quot; do you have? </s>
<s> (If it's a brand name computer, many have &quot;recovery partitions&quot; or 'Recovery Discs&quot; that contain the operating system and all software which will take the computer back to &quot;factory condition&quot;..) Do you have the operating system information and nothing more? </s>
<s> The more information you give us, the better informed our answer will be. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
