Does anyone have any advice?? Here is what I'm running: CPU: Core 2 Quad Q6600 @ 2.4ghz (stock) Heatsink: Zerotherm Nirvana Premium RAM: 2x2gb Corsair @ 800mhz (stock) GPU: evga GeForce 9800gt 512mb (stock) Mobo: nForce 780i sli Hard Drive: 500Gb Seagate Barracuda Looking at those specs, is my score low? Or is that normal? I have updated all of the drivers so I'm pretty sure that isn't the problem. I have also ran a test on 3dmark vantage, and got a score of about 6300. Thank you for your time.

Seems fine, I don't see why you think it should be higher, though most people do seem to be a little supirsed by how low their score seems to them. You should look more at how its assigns the score. Consider that it took a system with a a quad core overclocked to 6.5ghz to get a score above 45,000.
