i have been using an turtle beach audiotron to play all my music files which i moved from the original cds years ago.
a great setup with the only possible minus being the audiotron's rather small display.
it is connected via ethernet to my computer running winxp pro in another room and then connected via rca stereo audio cables to my tuner/amplifier.
i originally tried using an hpna (home phone network) to connect to my computer but that didn't work well.
i'm still looking for a good component to attach to my tuner/amplifier and tv so that i can play video files from my computer.
i tried a buffalo linktheater but it doesn't work well - sometimes hard to access the files and sometimes it hangs while playing the file.
