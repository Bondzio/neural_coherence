1.1.1	Hi I have bought this hard disk about 1 week ago, and since then I have 2 problems.	St
1.1.2	1.	St
1.1.3	I have received this error for several times: http://www.imagedoll.com/out.php/i1405_untitled.jpg More details in the event viewer: Windows Disk Diagnostic detected a S.M.A.R.T.	St
1.1.4	fault on disk SAMSUNG HD502HJ ATA Device (volumes C:\;D:\;E:\).	St
1.1.5	This disk might fail; back up your computer now.	St
1.1.6	All data on the hard disk, including files, documents, pictures, programs, and settings might be lost if your hard disk fails.	St
1.1.7	To determine if the hard disk needs to be repaired or replaced, contact the manufacturer of your computer.	St
1.1.8	If you can't back up (for example, you have no CDs or other backup media), you should shut down your computer and restart when you have backup media available.	St
1.1.9	In the meantime, do not save any critical files to this disk.	St
1.1.10	2.	St
1.1.11	For several times, at windows, suddenly the picture got noisy and the sound hanged up(like cd's scratch), and 1 second after, this blue screen showed up: http://www.imagedoll.com/out.php/i1461_30062010.jpg I've re-installed the windows, changed the PSU in use, but none of them worked.	St
1.1.12	The problem is here that every diagnostic software I used, has never detected any problem.	St
1.1.13	HD Tune Pro, Speedfan, HDDLife and even ES Tool (which is Samsung's diagnostic utility) says my hard disk is healthy and no problem was found.	St
1.1.14	How can I diagnose if this is from hard disk or not?	St
1.1.15	Any help is strongly appreciated!	St
1.2.1	We swap in a new drive.	St
1.2.2	The discussions about this are legendary and why Windows does that hangup is well discussed.	St
1.2.3	It's your choice to use the drive till it fails.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Could you please insert the link of those discussions here?	Sug
1.3.2	Thanks	Polite
1.4.1	It's google.com and ask a question like &quot;What do I do when my hard drive has a SMART failure?&quot; All this is your choice and money.	St
1.4.2	Some don't rely on their PCs or don't have much to lose when the drive fails.	St
1.4.3	The nice part about SMART is the early warning.	St
1.4.4	It's just that.	St
1.4.5	It does not tell you that it will die tomorrow or last 2 more years.	St
1.4.6	But that Windows failure is telling me that it's sooner than later.	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	http://www.eggheadcafe.com/software/aspnet/32844088/how-to-stop-smart-failure-detection-.aspx finds the usual owner that disbelieves that SMART is so smart.	St
1.5.2	There's not much you can do for them but wait for the end.	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
