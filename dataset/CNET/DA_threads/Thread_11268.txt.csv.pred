1.1.1	Hi, I am about to buy a Monitor.	St
1.1.2	I am unable to decide between Asus VK246H and Dell SP2309W.	St
1.1.3	Please advice me on this.	Ques
1.1.4	Both are priced approximately the same in my region.	St
1.1.5	The links for technical specs of Asus VK246H monitor is :: http://in.asus.com/product.aspx?P_I.. .	St
1.1.6	and that for Dell Monitor is :: http://www1.ap.dell.com/in/en/home/.. .	St
1.1.7	Any other monitors in the same price and performance range may also be suggested.	St
1.1.8	Also, where I live, monitors above 20 inch are not on display anywhere.	St
1.1.9	Its because people mainly buy 17 and 19 inch models.	St
1.1.10	Whenever someone orders a 24 inch monitor they (the vendors) get it shipped only then.So I cannot compare different models visually.	St
1.1.11	I spend lots of time in front of the computer.	St
1.1.12	I want a monitor which puts least strain on the eye and is best suited to my needs (as a computer science person).	St
1.2.1	After clicking on the links provided; ASUS took me to a general index site, and Dell didn't take me anywhere.	St
1.2.2	More info needed: - how big of a display are looking into getting?	St
1.2.3	- regular or widescreen?	St
1.2.4	- what are your choices for retailers (bestbuy, newegg, etc.)?	St
1.2.5	- what is your budget?	St
1.3.1	Hi Brechen, Thanks for replying.	St
1.3.2	Now, actually I am in India not United States.	St
1.3.3	1)&quot;After clicking on the links provided; ASUS took me to a general index site, and Dell didn't take me anywhere.&quot; The links that I included were of the respective Indian sites.	St
1.3.4	There might be some problem therefore or they might have expired.	St
1.3.5	However, I am including the specs of both of the monitors over here.	St

St
1.3.9	2) I am considering 23-24 inch displays.	St
1.3.10	Widescreen.	St
1.3.11	3) As far as choice of retailers is considered Amazon, Newegg etc do not operate in India.	St
1.3.12	I will be buying from a local distributor.	St
1.3.13	4) The budget question is not easy to answer.	St
1.3.14	The cost of electronics is lower in the US as compared to India.	St
1.3.15	For Example: The rate of Asus VK246H as on Amazon.com is $229.99 ( http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=node%3D1292115011&field-keywords=vk246h&x=0&y=0 ) .	St
1.3.16	Converted to Indian currency(Rupees or Rs in short) this should be Rs 10810.	St
1.3.17	However, the market cost over here for this model is Rs 14500.	St
1.3.18	Roughly the budget can be estimated to around $200 - $250.	St
1.3.19	But another thing is that only a fraction of the models available in the US are available over here.	St
1.3.20	For Dell, the following models are available : Alienware OptX AW2310 Dell SP2309W Dell E248WFP 24&quot; Widescreen Flat Panel Monitor Dell UltraSharpTM 2408WFP 24&quot; Monitor Dell G Series G2410 24&quot; LED Monitor Dell ST Series ST2410 Details of all of these can be seen on Amazon USA site.	St
1.3.21	Also if you open the INDIAN sites of LG, Samsung, Asus,Dell etc they will have the exact information on which models are available here.	St
1.3.22	Indian sites can be opened by Google search like: LG+india site.	St
1.3.23	Additional Info: I am a computer Science student and spend practically the whole day in front of the computer.	St
1.3.24	Thanks again for your effort.	St
1.4.1	how will you be connecting the monitor to your computer?	St
1.4.2	- VGA?	St
1.4.3	- DVI?	St
1.4.4	- HDMI (via the videocard, if so equpped)?	St
1.4.5	personally, I would go with the ASUS; in my opinion, better name, better choices for connecting to your computer, happens that a friend of mine has this exact model of monitor-he can't say enough good things about it.	St
1.4.6	You could always check out the vendors forum sites, see how many complaints there are for each particular monitor, seriousness of the complaints.	Sug
