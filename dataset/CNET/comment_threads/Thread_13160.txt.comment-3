I have a separate nice HP scanner and little Brother laser printer and an HP Photosmart inkjet printer.
Then my husband needed to print out large 11x17 printouts so we got a Brother all-in-one.
Boy is it nice to have.
It's not even hooked up to a computer all the time.
We just plug in the usb when we need to print from it.
And you don't have to have the computer on just to make a photocopy.
Just walk up and copy.
Just like a real office copy machine!
