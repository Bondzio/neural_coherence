<s> I need to find a replacement for: Power Tek Switching Power Supply Serial # L053003 Input: 115-6A 6Hz 230V-3.5A 50 Output 500W PowerTek site says not available. </s>
<s> Computer is 7 years old. </s>
<s> Merry Christmas! </s>
<s> Why must it be that model? </s>
<s> Your post is very light and for most desktops we can use MANY models. </s>

<s> Hi I don't care about the model but want a comparable replacement. </s>
<s> What is recommended? </s>
<s> I would be guessing if this is just another PC power supply. </s>
<s> I had hope you could tell more. </s>
<s> I know, I know that some folk want to replace with the exact models but in your common PCs we have some standards. </s>
<s> If you would share a bit more then I could see if a stock supply will do. </s>
<s> There are some hundreds on newegg.com that would do but if you would tell more such as the dimensions and connections it would go a long way. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> someone can help. </s>
<s> Is that the exact name 'power tek' or is it 'powertek' ? </s>
<s> If that's a serial number, we need a model number. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Does it look like http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=ATX500D If so, why not another standard PC power supply? </s>
<s> Bob Yes the sample you provided at the link is the exact model, ATX500D, but I see it is unavailable. </s>
<s> I am a novice at this stuff but I know the one I have now is shot and I can replace it myself. </s>

<s> Your old PSU is nothing more than a generic ATX type PSU. </s>
<s> Finding a similar one with be fairly easy as most vendors offer this at 500W unit. </s>
<s> Just be sure the connections offered(basic) are what you need and added connections are provided as well though you may not need them, they cause no harm. </s>
<s> Again, look for typical generic ATX-12V type PSU. </s>
<s> USAe Robert's link for any specs and/or pictorial help. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Lucky for us we found your old supply. </s>
<s> There must be some thousands of models that will work in it's place. </s>
<s> -&gt; BUT let me add that BEFORE YOU REPLACE IT, inspect the motherboard for BAD CAPS as your parts are in the time frame of the BAD CAPS days. </s>
<s> Google BAD CAPS for the pictures and stories. </s>
<s> Finally, add 100 more Watts so we're sure there is more reserve and you won't be replacing it in a few months. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks to all that provided assistance. </s>
<s> I found what I needed and did increase 100 Watts to 600. </s>
<s> Happy Holidays! </s>
