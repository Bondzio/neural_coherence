a repeating issue for windows owners is that usb doesn't mean it works.
covers most reasons, but here's the two i see a lot.
first the usb ports must be enabled in the bios, second many machines require motherboard or usb drivers that are not supplied by microsoft.
a new annoyance is that microsoft offers a driver through windows update that is inferior to what the vendor/maker offers.
with what information you supplied, only this generic advice can be offered.
you have to research usbman because i don't duplicate web content in the forums.
