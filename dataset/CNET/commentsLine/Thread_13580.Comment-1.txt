hey guys!
i've been trying for quite some time to find solution for the problem i'm having with my desktop pc.here is the story...i wanted to upgrade ddr ram from 3gb to 4 gb and i purchased 2x1gb mem chips to replace two slots that have 512mb in them.
other two slots already have 2x1gb chips.
so when i ordered those new memory sticks on ebay and received them they looked like crucial memory chips and one of them actually is...but i did not pay attention at first only when i opened plastic box i found out that one of the chips is wider (even though the length is the same) and when i checked with the everest software it showed me that chip belongs to micron not to crucial..even though both chips had stickers from crucial as well...so i got cheated here..anyway.. .i put this ram in replacing like i mentioned two 512 sticks..so now i would have 4x1gb.
after i did this and powered on my pc, i could not believe how slow it was loading...damn windows logo was hanging in there for good 5 minutes and when it finally loaded to a desktop i basically could not use any application or open any window...it was sooooo slow and lagging very bad.
so i though that other memory chips that was different might have given me a problem..but i was not sure...i went back to my previous config with 3gb ram...and restarted...same crap again - loading is very slow.i formated drives installed both xp and windows 7 numerous times, but that does not help - same problem still persists.
changed bios battery...disconnected drives and installed windows on completely different hard drive - it still does not help.i have no idea what happen after swapping ram in and out...maybe some of you have had this similar problem before or have some kind of a guess i would really appreciate this guys!
thanks a lot for your replies!
