<s> Am I the only one to notice a jump in the Pixel count of digital cameras? </s>
<s> It was not long ago that I bought my first camera with 2mp count. </s>
<s> This was just an entry level device but still considered reasonable. </s>
<s> Upgrading to a 4mp camera was quite expensive but I did eventually do it. </s>
<s> But now when I see cameras advertised the cheapest are 5 to 6mp. </s>
<s> I am sure technology has not accelerated that much in such a short time (measured in months rather than years).Are they using a different measurement for the pixel count now? </s>
<s> Interpolation comes to mind. </s>
<s> I picked up a Kodak 6MP refurb with 3X optical zoom for only 139 and it's not interpolated. </s>
<s> As the swing to digital accelerates, ecomonies of scale kick in and you'll find some deals out there. </s>
<s> My advice? </s>
<s> Stick with names. </s>

<s> ...why you're sure a modern and new technology doesn't leap upwards quickly, and we'll explain why you're surely wrong! </s>
<s> www.google.com : charge coupled device developements Plenty of detail in the links you'll find, to explain why things are advancing so rapidly. </s>
