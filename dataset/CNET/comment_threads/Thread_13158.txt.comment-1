I bought a new p4 socket 478.
Now when im trying to remove my old celeron 2.4 socket 478 from my asrock p4vm8 mobo, the celeron cpu won't come out.
I pulled that stick up all the way, but i won't budge.
Should i use like a knife to pry it out, cause im afraid that i might damage the celeron cpu with the knife.
So any idea's on how to get the old celeron cpu out?
