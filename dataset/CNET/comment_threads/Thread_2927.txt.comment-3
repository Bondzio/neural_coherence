I looked in the &quot;sticky&quot; thread(s) and I did not see a reference in the link in reply 18(19) about mixing wireless protocols on the same network.
Sorry to be so ignorant.
But I think your simple &quot;Yes&quot; tells me what I need to know (but did want to hear).
Thanks VERY much for your response!
