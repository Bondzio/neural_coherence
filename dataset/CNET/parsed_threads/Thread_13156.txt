<s> My CD-Rom drive appears to turn off and on while playing games which causes periodic freezes in the games that I play. </s>
<s> Is there anything that I can do to stop this from occuring as much? </s>
<s> ...of smooth gameplay. </s>
<s> CD roms spinning up causes a few seconds of lurching about (and the odd sound of a jet taking off inside your PC! </s>
<s> ), as your software waits on some data coming off the disc. </s>
<s> With a modern high speed CD-ROM drive there's nothing you can do about it (whisper) except...switch audio things like game music to &quot;off&quot;. </s>
<s> Alterantively if you've got a lot of Hard Drive space, when you install a game use the largest install type, to cut down on the amount of data having to come off the CD. </s>
<s> The delay is caused by the drive slowing down to prevent wear and tear (who'd want that thing whining away for hours? </s>
<s> It generates a rediculous amount of heat after 15 minutes at 52x speed too! </s>
<s> ), but the knock on effect is it has to spin up to full speed when data is finally required. </s>
<s> It's a limitation of the hardware. </s>
<s> As drive speeds have increased the spin up times have gotten progressively longer. </s>
<s> GeeBee. </s>
<s> alot of games can be installed with virtual CD rom software. </s>
<s> Its cheap. </s>
<s> If your game is compatible with it it loads all onto hard disk and CD is not required at all. </s>
<s> Some games that require CD authentication wont do this. </s>
<s> But its worth a try. </s>
