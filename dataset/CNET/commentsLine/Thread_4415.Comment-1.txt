hi all.
i have an arris router/modem combo unit which is terrible.
i've done a lot of research with respect to its performance for xbox live.
i have an xbox live account but my console simply cannot connect.
even fiddling with wpa/wpa2, etc doesn't do the trick.
a lot of other people have this problem with this arris unit.
my question is, how do i make a d-link wireless n router as the gateway, leaving the arris only as the modem?
thanks!
