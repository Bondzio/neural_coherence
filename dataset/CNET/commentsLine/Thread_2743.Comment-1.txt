hi a friend of mine just ordered a pc from computer world.au .
he doesn't have alot of room so he went with a cworld micro atx silver case.
inside: no os/software ordered amd xp3000+ cpu radeon 8600xt 256mb 512mb 3200 geil ram 80gm matrox ata-133 hd 7200rpm a7n8x-vm or a7n8x-x m-board nforce2 - the smaller one so i switch the ******* on, boot from xp cd.
load winxp setup.
chose the partition and just as i start a full ntfs format the process freezes at 3%.
so i am thinking 'it could be running hot, but its too early to effect anything, must be a defective hardisk' i think it was.
ok, i restart.
start setup again.
but this time i just do a quick ntfs format.
it works.
i install windows, m-board driver and some monitoring utilities.
the case is bloody hot, the cpu is running at 74 degrees.
the threshold is 79 thought.
i start installing drivers, problems with agp adapter straight away.
won't install the drivers for it, as if the cd don't want to read.
i am thinking must be a conflict with the built in nforce 2 agp, so i disable it and try again.
no go, same thing.
also errors with everything i try to install, the computer gives me constant errors during installation.
i tried installing xp autopatcher and it gave me install errors every minute.
i am thinking the hardisk must be f**ked up or the heat is killing things.
what do you guys thing about the tempereture ?
i am obviously going to call the cworld ppl tommorow and tell them what did they think when the told me cramming an xp3000 inside a micro atx would work ok and ofcourse wtf?
is with the hardisk, dead on arrival thats what.
your thoughts please ?
and what would you try with this system ?
