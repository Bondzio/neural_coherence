Alright, I've knocked out the possiblity that it's the keyboard/mouse, because I've tried three different mouses, and two different keyboards.
The mouses are not picked up at all.
The keyboards are picked up, but not very well.
They work fine in Windows, but they do not respond in the BIOS.
It also takes multiple tries for the computer to pick up the pressing of the F1 key (for entry to the bios).
This is not my own computer, this is a computer I'm working on for a friend, and I'm thoroughly stumped.
At the moment, I've been dealing with using the numberpad to control the cursor, but I don't want my friend to have to deal with that for the rest of the life of this computer.
It's fairly new, only bought within the past six months or so.
Thanks in advance.
