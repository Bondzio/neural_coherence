<s> i have an older computer with a hard drive that i would like to replace with another. </s>
<s> my replacement drive has windows xp as well and i would like to install with all the applications and data intact. </s>
<s> can somebody help? </s>
<s> XP does not like being put into a different system. </s>
<s> It does not recognize the new system's hardware. </s>
<s> Most likely will have to a new install, including mobo drivers and other drivers. </s>
<s> You can save your data to a CD before moving the drive, but not most of the App's. </s>
<s> They need to be reinstalled to restablish the .dll's etc.. </s>
<s> Could there be something wrong with it? </s>
<s> You can try the repair install of XP by booting from the CD and selecting repair. </s>
<s> You will need the new MB drivers. </s>
<s> Here is a link that may help. </s>

<s> With XP, everything gets a little hairy, so beware you need your product key, so get it(save) to later input it or know it from the MS sticker. </s>
<s> But, here's what I do using Ghost from Norton. </s>
<s> Copy the old HD to new/old -OR- partition to partition and/or HD to partition. </s>
<s> It should wipe out whatever is on the &quot;destination&quot; in order to copy from source. </s>
<s> I like to use partition to partition, don't proceed until you're sure. </s>
<s> Other s/w like Arconis does this too. </s>
<s> You may use the HD s/w provided from HD maker as well, but sometimes that gets confusing, but its free. </s>
<s> If for example the old/new HD is from Maxtor use MaxBlast s/w. </s>
<s> Other HD vendors have different names but the task is similar. </s>
<s> As always save whatever you deem critial data before hand. </s>
