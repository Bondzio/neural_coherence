1.1.1	&lt;div&gt;Product in question: Western Digital My Passport Essential SE 1 TB USB 3.0/2.0 Ultra Portable External Hard Drive&lt;/div&gt; I have a WD external hard drive that recently started making these clicky noises that, after extensive research, I've discovered means that my hard drive is on the way out.	St
1.1.2	I can't access ANY of my files (and there's about 300-600 GB in this thing) and the cheapest place I found to recover would cost me about 1000 smackaroos.	St
1.1.3	I'm a college student and CANNOT afford that.	St
1.1.4	I also don't have any amazingly geeky friends to save me.	St
1.1.5	So.	St
1.1.6	I've found a &quot;risky&quot; solution that a guy told me about at one of those places that charge for file recovery.	St
1.1.7	He suggested that I format my hard drive (a quick format, not a deep one) and use a program to rescue these files, putting them safely in other locations until I can get the replacement in the mail.	St
1.1.8	My question is what are the best programs?	Ques
1.1.9	I would really prefer free ones although if those ones aren't up to snuff I am desperate enough that I would probably pay a little bit of money (twenty dollars, maybe).	St
1.1.10	If anyone could recommend a good program I'd greatly appreciate it.	Ques
1.1.11	Thank you very much for the help.	St
1.2.1	However I have found the drive to recover when I put it into a desktop PC or a new enclosure with it's new power supply.	St
1.2.2	Thanks for telling the story.	St
1.2.3	Folk often won't backup because it's too expensive.	St
1.2.4	At 1,000 bucks, backup seems cheap.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Clicking noises could be a power issue.	St
1.3.2	Try an Y-cable (to connect it with 2 slots), or a powered hub, or run your laptop from an adapter.	St
1.3.3	Or, as Bob suggested, another enclosure or directly in the case.	St
1.3.4	Luckily, as long as it makes these sounds, most likely you can't even format it.	St
1.3.5	So you won't lose your files.	St
1.3.6	But better make a copy to another disk as soon as possible.	St
1.3.7	Kees	St
