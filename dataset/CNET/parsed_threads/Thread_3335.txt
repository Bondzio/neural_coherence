<s> I currently have a desktop pc, vonage, digital cable, and regular cable all split off from the same cable outlet. </s>
<s> Is adding a wireless router for a laptop too much for one outlet? </s>
<s> The router goes behind the modem. </s>
<s> It'll either work or it won't. </s>
<s> Signal strength is the factor. </s>
<s> Each &quot;split&quot; cuts transmission levels in half. </s>
<s> Too many splits and the router will not receive a signal at the proper amplitude. </s>
