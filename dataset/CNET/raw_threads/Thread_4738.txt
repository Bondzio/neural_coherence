The computer is old and not worth fixing. My fiance is a classical pianist and all of his performance recordings are on the hard drive (no, I don't know why he didn't have them backed up somewhere else). I would rather not go through the hassle of installing that hard drive as a secondary hard drive in another computer because of it's age. Once I have the files off of it, I have no further need of it. I read someone else's post about a similar issue where they said you could hook the hard drive up to the new computer's CD drive (not an actual &quot;new&quot; computer, just a different computer than the dead one), copy the files and re-install the CD. This sounds like it should be easier and quicker. Can anyone confirm if this is a viable method? Also, are there any other ways to accomplish this task that would work better? I want to do this as quickly and cheaply as possible. Thanks so much for all of your help.
