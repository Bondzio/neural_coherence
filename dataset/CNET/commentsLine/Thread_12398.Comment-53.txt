thanks cindywit!!!
do you leave it on standby all the time?
i have read that you must do that or it uses up a lot of ink to power it up.
so far, the only negative i have heard is that to leave it on standby it uses about 45 watts.
anyhoo, it looks like i will buy this printer!
again, thanks so much for your review!
