<s> Whenever I put in the software to install my Sound Blaster Live! </s>
<s> 5.1 sound card i get an error message saying &quot;Setup could not detect any Sound Blaster audio card on your system. </s>
<s> Please ensure that your Sound Blaster hardware is properly installed before running this setup program. </s>
<s> Setup will now exit.&quot; Yet when I go into device manager it detects that I have installed the Sound Blaster card. </s>
<s> My motherboard came with onboard sound which I disabled and I tried the card in different PCI slots. </s>
<s> What should I do??? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> You may have a dead card. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> You may have an incomplete OS install. </s>
<s> Microsoft will not install motherboard drivers for you. </s>
<s> Share more about the machine. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> I can flumox up the install with other than default BIOS settings and overclocking. </s>
<s> Try stock and boring safe speeds. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> And a final thought. </s>
<s> Is it really a SB Live card? </s>
<s> Some scammer was hawking any old PCI audio card they could and putting SB Live stickers on everything. </s>
<s> CD-R media for the drivers were a give-away something was amiss. </s>

<s> Actually, I've got (almost) the same problem (it's an external USB Audigy 2 NX), and none of the things you described apply. </s>
<s> I know it's not a dead card, because we are getting sound from it. </s>
<s> And, like the guy before me, the card shows up in Device Manager as properly installed. </s>
<s> Anybody got a clue? </s>

<s> The card (USB box..) is &quot;getting sound from it.&quot; B. </s>
<s> &quot;the card shows up in Device Manager as properly installed.&quot; I have no clue what issue you are having since you didn't tell what wasn't working. </s>

<s> Have you uninstalled the drivers for the onboard sound card? </s>
<s> If not you might try removing it before trying to instal the sound blaster. </s>
<s> This is the way I also have managed to install the drivers for my 5.1 Digital (OEM). </s>
<s> But I'd like to install the AudioHQ and other Creative software too... With my &quot;old&quot; Live! </s>
<s> Value card everything was OK but this 5.1 Digital seems to be somehow strange... E.g. </s>
<s> WinXP detected the Value card and used correctly its MS drivers but did not with this 5.1. </s>
