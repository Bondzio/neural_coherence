<s> I have done numerous searches on my topic but didn't find the answer I need. </s>
<s> I have a computer in New York and a computer in Vermont. </s>
<s> I would like to be able to remote desktop into the Vermont computer from New York. </s>
<s> Both computers are running XP Pro and connected to the internet with a broadband connection. </s>
<s> From what I read I think I need to forward the vermont connection to the outside internet? </s>
<s> Can I accomplish this with my linksys wireless router? </s>
<s> What hardware and software do I need to obtain and setup to accomplish this? </s>
<s> I already have a linksys wireless router and a Nokia IP70 hardware firewall/router. </s>
<s> If anyone knows of a good book that explains step by step the process I would appreciate the reccomendation. </s>
<s> Although I built my last computer from scratch I am not an IT professional and have limited computer/networking knowledge. </s>
<s> TIA </s>
<s> LAN? </s>
<s> Stand-alone computer? </s>
<s> Static IP addresses? </s>
<s> If the computers have static IPs and are directly connected to the Internet, you're ready to go. </s>
<s> If they do not have static IPs it's still possible but much more of a hassle. </s>
<s> If the computers reside on a network, you will have to create a VPN connection first. </s>
<s> Then you could connect to any PC on the LAN that has remote desktop enabled. </s>
