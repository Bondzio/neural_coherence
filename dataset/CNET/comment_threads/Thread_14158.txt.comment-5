OK, I've found some 60x60x25 fans I can get for CPU cooling.
My existing fan is a DC 12V and .12A.
Do I need to be worry about about staying with a fan that is still .12A?
Or can I get one that runs higher?
What kind of RPMS do I need?
My existing fan is an AVC model C6025B12L.
Thanks in advance to anyone who has anything to contribute.
