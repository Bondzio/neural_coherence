I've got an old system that I'm using for some CAD work.
The system is a Gigabyte GA 7ZX motherboard with Socket A for AMD Duron/Athlon processor; a VIA KT133/686A chipset, with support for PC133 SDRAM .
I did something very simple ---- I replaced the CPU Duron 900 with a Duron 1200 and I added a stick of 256 memory.
I made sure that the CPU and memory pieces were compatible with the motherboard.
The machine will not pass the POST.
I took out the memory and put the old processor back in......no POST I took all peripherals off line and added them one at a time.....no POST I replaced the power supply......no Post I replaced the motherboard with a brand new one exact model.....no POST I pulled the video card and checked it.......no POST I switched the new CPU back in.....no POST I switched out the memory sticks one at a time....no POST I'm stumped, any ideas.
