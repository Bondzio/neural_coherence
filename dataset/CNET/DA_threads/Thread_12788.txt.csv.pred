1.1.1	I am currently about to build my first machine .	St
1.1.2	I know a bit about PC 's , however , being that I am a bonafied noobie I would some suggestions or slaps across the face with my decision .	St
1.1.3	My motherboard is an Intel DG965WH Series and my chip is an Intel Core Duo 6300 .	St
1.1.4	My goal is to get this machine to run smoothly , as I am an avid MMO player and my machine at home is about to become my wifes .	St
1.1.5	I guess my question comes down to , how do I pick out the right power supply so as to power my machine and get it to accept the specs I want , and are there any restrictions about the case I pick .	St
1.1.6	My goal is to hook up a 320 GB hard drive ( most likely 7200 RPM Maxtor ) 2 GB of RaM ( PC4200 ) and a PCI-E Nvidia graphics card ( 256mb or above ) .	St
1.1.7	Any help or general slaps in the face would be appreciated .	St
1.2.1	Congratulations on diving into your first build !	St
1.2.2	Gaming computers need good airflow to dissipate heat , so the really small cases are n't recommended .	St
1.2.3	You could get away with a standard ATX mini-tower , but you probably will be happiest with the room provided by a standard ATX mid-tower case .	St
1.2.4	Look at the system requirements for the particular make and model of video card that you intend to install in the computer .	St
1.2.5	The general idea is to surpass the minimum PSU requirements listed for that video card .	St
1.2.6	The manual for the motherboard states that it takes a standard ATX12V PSU .	St
1.2.7	Get a 20+4pin PSU from a good manufacturer with a maximum Wattage rating that surpasses the video card 's requirements .	St
1.2.8	Also pay attention to what Amp rating the video card requires on the PSU 's +12V rail .	St
1.2.9	A high-end video card can require over 30A .	St
1.3.1	Get a book from the local library and read about it .	St
1.3.2	At least , get to know and understand about the technical terms used in froums responses .	St
1.3.3	Good luck with your endeavour .	Polite
1.4.1	Thanks to both of you .	St
1.4.2	I 've been doing plenty of research believe me .	St
1.4.3	I 've decided to go with the Mid-Tower AthenaTech with a 400W PSU .	St
1.4.4	Will be adding a 120mm fan into front when it arrives then place all into it and either cry tears of joy or take cover when it blows up .	St
