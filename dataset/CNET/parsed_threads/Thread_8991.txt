<s> I have a Thinkpad R50 laptop. </s>
<s> It runs Windows XP with service pack 3. </s>
<s> I bought this laptop used for school and it seem to work well except for the wireless. </s>
<s> I can't seem to bring the icons up or tell if it's working. </s>
<s> I went to Thinkpads (Leveno) website and downloaded all the drivers I thought I might need, no luck. </s>
<s> I do have a yellow question mark next to my network controller in my Device Manager could this be the problem. </s>
<s> It has a Intel 3B2100 802.11b wireless card installed. </s>
<s> I do not have a start up disc. </s>
<s> Any help on this would be appreciated </s>
<s> XP OS CD (sp1 or later please)? </s>
<s> We need this so when windows updates or installs drivers it may need a file from that. </s>
<s> I have the reinstallation cd Windows XP Home SP 1a </s>
<s> Check here http://downloadcenter.intel.com/SearchResult.aspx?lang=eng&keyword=%22wireless%22 or go to the IBM support site and check for the Intel wireless device for your specific laptop. </s>
<s> My guess is that one directly from Intel will work as these tend to cover several models. </s>
<s> I will go to the Intel download site and try that. </s>
<s> I've been to the IBM download site and went through all the drivers that I thought I needed, but none seem to address the problem. </s>
<s> I'll let you know. </s>
<s> The driver order is IMPORTANT. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The OS. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The CHIPSET driver (not the wifi card!!!) </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> MS UAA (see google.) </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> The audo driver. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> The video driver. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> The ethernet driver. </s>
<s> 7. </s>
<s> The wifi driver. </s>
<s> 8. </s>
<s> The ACCESSORIES driver (I know that's vague) but this one is the one that turns on or off the wifi. </s>
<s> I can't guess which one it was, you tell me. </s>
<s> Thanks,I have all those drivers up and running. </s>
<s> I did download the driver from Intl for the wireless card, like Steve said, and it seem to do the trick. </s>
<s> The yellow question mark is gone, replaced by a Intel PRO wireless adapter. </s>
<s> It is now able to see my wireless connection and lets me in, but now it can't seem to aquire a IP address. </s>
<s> Do you know what I need to do for this. </s>
<s> If just for home use and you don't need special connections to VPN, etc., disable the IBM &quot;Access Connections&quot; utility and just set things up manually as you would with plain old Windows. </s>
<s> Make sure your Windows wireless zero service is set to automatic as well. </s>
<s> The repeating cause is WEP. </s>
<s> It does that if one character is off in the password. </s>
<s> This is one reason among the security issue with WEP I move to WPA. </s>
<s> And in this forum is our preferred router wifi settings. </s>
<s> Share those. </s>
<s> Also, be careful not to have 2 wifi managers. </s>
<s> My old laptop was loaned out and somehow they turned on the second wifi connection manager. </s>
<s> Sorry, no but I can't recall or know all the methods to get this back to just one. </s>
<s> But I'm leaning to always using the Windows Wireless Zero Configuration tool for all machines. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> My Linksys is WPA and my Thinkpad is WEP would this keep me from connecting. </s>
<s> Ideally, the selected mode must provide adequate stability and protection. </s>
<s> adds WPA and WPA2. </s>
<s> You need to upgrade. </s>
<s> I have upgraded to SP3. </s>
<s> Is there a seperate download for this? </s>
<s> SP3 supports WPA if the router has it. </s>
<s> If the router transmits WPA then Windows will encode/decode WPA. </s>
<s> You have to tell the router which encryption to use. </s>
