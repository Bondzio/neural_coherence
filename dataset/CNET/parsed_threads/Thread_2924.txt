<s> I'm looking at buying the Cyberpower Ultimate Gaming Desktop http://www.cyberpowerpc.com/system/infultimate.aspv=d#configurator_top However, I've read in reviews that there are issues with Vista in terms of the drivers or something like that. </s>
<s> Then I called Cyberpower and talked to a rep about it and she said that it is definitely a problem and that certain games may not be recognizable to Vista, espeically older games. </s>
<s> She said that if I took the Vista out and replaced it with XP pro I would have no problems at all. </s>
<s> So, my question is how big a problem is this? </s>
<s> Does anyone know exactly what games I would be able to play and what games I wouldn't? </s>
<s> I am mostly interested in playing new games anyway so i was wondering if this would be a nonissue for me. </s>
<s> Also, does anyone know how long it will take before these issues with Vista are worked out? </s>
<s> And lastly, what is the difference between XP Pro and Vista? </s>
<s> I know Vista is new, but am I really hurting myself by not getting Vista and instead settling for XP Pro. </s>
<s> My uses for the PC would only be for gaming, internet, photo storage and some word processing. </s>
<s> And advice is greatly appreciated since I am a total computer noob and am completely lost when it comes to this stuff. </s>
<s> stick with xp pro. </s>
<s> your pc should come with a free vista-upgrade that you can use when vista 'stabilizes' (probably when sp1 is released). </s>
<s> as for compatibility, here's a list: http://www.vistaboard.org/gaming/29-game_compatibility_list_windows_vista.html &quot;compatible&quot; doesn't guarantee it will play without issue. </s>
<s> XP is a very stable operating system with few bugs and vista is new with lots of compatibality issues and such... </s>
<s> Therefore i would recomend XP. </s>
<s> Then in a few years when microsoft works out all the problems you can upgrade to Vista. </s>
<s> Hope this helps! </s>

<s> Stay away from Vista, it's broken and has uncounted compatibility issues. </s>
<s> XP and XP Pro are solid performers. </s>
<s> And Vista takes tons of resources and HD space. </s>
<s> I've been watching it since it was announced and am not impressed. </s>
<s> I got the free upgrade and attempted to install it... big failure. </s>
<s> First i downloaded Vista Upgrade Advisor and removed like half the programs on my computer that were causing compatibility issues. </s>
<s> Next i started to install it; i got about 3/4 the way done and then it stopped with a message telling me to install upgrade advisor and fix compatibility issues... which i already did. </s>
<s> Upgrade advisor said everything was correct so i tried again and got the same problem... </s>
<s> So i said the heck with it and tossed it... </s>
<s> So in the end i lost like half of my programs and documents and still have XP. </s>
<s> Pissed the hell outta me! </s>
