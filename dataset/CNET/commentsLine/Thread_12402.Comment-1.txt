can the maxtor shared storage plus drive be formatted or split-partitioned in a way to allow backups from both a windows xp computer and a mac running leopard?
i'm using it currently and am very happy with the drive; just wondering what my backup options are going to be when i get my imac in a couple of weeks.
also, i have a canon ip5200 printer connected to the drive with with a usb cable, which i have set up as a network printer.
anything special i should know about setting it up on the imac?
posting to the maxtor support forums hasn't brought any replies yet.
