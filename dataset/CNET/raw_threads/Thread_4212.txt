Both of them got WiFi adapters. But i do not have any router. Is it possible to share my internet connection with my Pocket PC (thru my desktop) without installing a wifi router? Like Ad-hoc networking or something?

I've learned it best to ... get a router. But some want to try it without. To me, such setups are a tarpit of support. I refuse to travel into said tarpit. Best of luck with your adventure, Bob
