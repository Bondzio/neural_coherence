Reading through some of these threads it becomes evident how little I know...
I need to set up a wireless, secured network for about 6 individuals located across the country.
I need a central server, probably FTP ability... Where do I start?
I am not an IT guy (obviously, the crowd says!)
but am more than a complete newb on a computer...
This is for a small business startup to give you the obvious context..
Since this is probably too advanced for me, can anyone recommend a company that provides this service?
Thanks for your time and help Chuck
