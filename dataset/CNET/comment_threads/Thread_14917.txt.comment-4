I have the 9500 GT in PCI form and total Watts (I use a Watt meter) for the entire machine tops out at 120 WATTS.
I know that sounds confusing since some may hit the wrong button and read 120VAC but I know the diff.
The 9400 is not a screamer but the 8400 PCI card in a machine that had no PSU upgrade is running fine.
