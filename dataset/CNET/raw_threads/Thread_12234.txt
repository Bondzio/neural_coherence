The most intense s/w I'm running is Blu Ray movies and Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 10. Not planning on gaming with it. Suggestions/advice?

Since this is just for BR/BD play why not the usual ATI 5450? https://www.google.com/#q=ati+5450&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=shop&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DrGyTubgJ8vRiAK_1rWNBA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CHAQrQQ&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=a88196fa830a7663&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=589 Can be under 50 bucks.

And this is not just for BR/BD. Second, my monitors have DVI inputs, not HDMI. Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 10 renders stuff in real time in Preview mode. I do not know, however, if this is GPU or CPU intensive. So, &quot;the usual ATI 5450&quot; may be just fine. But I'm not sure. Which is why I'm asking all you experts.

So far I'm hearing no BD/BR play for non-HDCP systems. http://www.cyberlink.com/prog/support/cs/product-faq-content.do?id=2577 and many other sites note this. But hey, it's your money to prove them wrong. While the usual ATI5450 would be my choice given the non-gamer use, I do have better cards ready to talk about. Do this -&gt; Set the price you want to pay and then pick one at that price from this link. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card-gaming-performance,3042.html Once you pick out the card we'll check the power supply rating.

Because the system came with a Blu Ray burner, and I've watched Blu Ray movies on it, my assumption is that the HDCP encoding is built into the system, and separate from the video viewing/graphics card requirements. Am I wrong?

Folk have systems that don't do this and I didn't know yours was OK. Now all we have to be sure of is that the DVI ports note HDCP in the new cards. In short, the displays must have HDCP, the video cards must have HDCP and the BD player software have it's decoder, etc. Bob

I didn't even care to check before because it didn't have the ports I needed. The one I'm replacing has an HDMI with the DVI, and I don't have a monitor with an HDMI port. And the new one has 1 GB DDR3 memory. So I replaced it anyway. But I thought you might find that an amusing ending...
