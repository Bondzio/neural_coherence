your dell system has 'built-in or what some call onboard graphics&quot;.
systems using onboard graphics use regular system memory for video ram.
so if your system has 256mbs system ram ....and if your onboard video system was using 64mbs ram...your usable system memory would be reduced to 192mbs ram.
your dell dimension 3000 has 3 expansion slots for peripherals but they're not pcie (the latest and greatest) and not agp (the previous generation latest and greatest) it has pci.
so the only video card you could buy and add to your current system would have to be pci.
that's the only interface option your system has for adding peripherals like graphics cards.
given the limitations a pci video card places on gaming performance you're better off selling the existing system and putting your $$ into a system designed for gaming.
