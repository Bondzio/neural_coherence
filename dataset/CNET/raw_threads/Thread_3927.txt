As I wrote in another response, no one I know installs Linux on the Intel based Mac due to MacOSX already being UNIX based. Given that and X11 being available, any app can be run natively that needs to be so the need for Linux is subdued. &quot;Strong OS Support: A sophisticated virtual machine engine that offers the broadest support of x86-based operating systems, including: * The entire Windows family - 3.1, 3.11, 95, 98, Me, 2000, XP and 2003 * Linux distributions from popular distributors like Red Hat, SuSE, Mandriva, Debian and Fedora Core * FreeBSD * Legacy operating systems like OS/2, eComStation and MS-DOS.&quot;

You see I have an oppurtunity where I'm looking to purchase a Macbook. I have been a Windows person my enitre life, and I'm about as close as you can get to being certified by Microsoft without actually being certified. However for the past few years Apple and it's products have really impressed me, and I am very curious to see what their products are all about. I would never give up Windows this is for sure. But I would like to explore Mac, however I am a little concerned about making the change, even though it is only from a laptop standpoint. If you do have a Mac PC, first off do you like the PC? Is it better or equal to Windows? Does it have all the finctionality that Windows offer? Is it a quality laptop for an IT person like myself? Again I know these are questions I can research however I would like to get an opinion from an actual user, not to mention when researching you get locked into the battle between Windows and Mac. Thanks

With the new OS coming out and COHERENCE there is a chance I'd refresh my laptop this year and that will be it. I'd seen you pose similar questions many times. Can we bring it down to some question you really wanted to ask? Bob
