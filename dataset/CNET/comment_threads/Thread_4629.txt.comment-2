The hard drive is what model number?

With a proper installation of Windows XP, there is no extra driver installation required.
The exception is sometimes when you need to install a Serial ATA (SATA) driver to use an SATA hard drive, but that driver would come from your PC or motherboard maker.
There are some Maxtor hard drive tools (MaxBlast, PowerMax, et al.)
that may be helpful, but they are not drivers and are not required.

Also, there are some Maxtor hard drive models that require a firmware upgrade to work properly in some computers.
