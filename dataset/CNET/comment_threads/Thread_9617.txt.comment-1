Okay, well here's my problem.
I need to build the BEST possible computer using $1,000 (maybe an extra $200 but I'd like to stick to $1,000).
I know this isn't the easiest thing to do but I just need to get the right parts which I've made a check list for below.
I'm keeping my monitor, speakers, keyboard, and mouse for now to save money for the parts.
I've thought about buying the stuff from TigerDirect but I have no idea what to pick for each item.
What I need is: * Video Card -- Min: 128MB * Motherboard * LAN Card * Processor Fan * Power Source * Hard Drive -- Min: 100GB * Case * RAM -- Min: 1GB * Floppy Drive * Processor * CD/DVD Burner Any suggestions or comments on missing things?
I prefer to customize my computer so that I get a lasting one rather than a temporary one I'll use the hell out of in a few months ot a year.
