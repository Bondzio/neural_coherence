one of my old pcs finally died a while back, and the other day i received a replacement i ordered online, which uses win2kpro.
unfortunately it didn't come with a modem installed.
i installed a &quot;netodragon 56k voice modem&quot;, but am for some reason unable to connect to the internet using msn 8. i installed msn 8 and chose &quot;i've already signed up&quot;, and was immediately greeted with the following error message; &quot;we're sorry, we cannot sign you up for msn because there is a problem with your computer or the msn service.
please try again later.&quot; the driver for the modem is installed, and i can use the &quot;internet connection wizard&quot; which successfully connects to the &quot;microsoft internet referral service&quot;, so apparently the modem is working.
i've never had to install a modem on a computer, having had them already installed when i bought them, and thus have absolutely no idea what to do here.
can anyone help with this problem?
