Hi, i was wondering thet with the launch of the nvidia geforce 6 and other advancements that are coming by the day, do I need to buy a new computer or probably wait for, say, 6 months or so.
I will be buying a Creative SB Audigy 2 Zs Platinum pro Sound card tomorrow, and my current cpu stats are as follows.. ADM Athlon XP 2100+ 1.74Ghz Windows XP Service Pack 1 Asus NVIDIA GeForce 4 Ti 4600(128MB) Creative SB Live 5.1 SOUND CARD(TO BE REPLACED) 2 Hard Drives(30GB + 40GB) 512MB RAM 333Mhz 1xCD-ROM, 1xCD-R/DVD COMBO DRIVE 3 FIREWIRE AND 4 USB 2.0 PORTS WITH 2 USB 1.1 IN THE FRONT I would appreciate any suggestions whatsoever...
