<s> I was going to post this in the Norton Forum, but they wont let you post anything unless it relates to having a problem with their products, so I'll give this to any Software Developer: Over the past 20 years Ive been able to recover fried HDD's simply by powering it on and off multiple times, sometimes 20 or 30 times. </s>
<s> It would be nice if a developer would automate this process, perhaps as part of their existing HDD diagnostic software. </s>
<s> The software would have to power on the drive, wait to verify access or no bad error messages, and if fails power off for 30 seconds. </s>
<s> Its a simple program, but but it needs to be put in place. </s>
<s> (Im still waiting for them to develop a device that will gently slam a HDD on a countertop repeatedly [because that sometimes works!] </s>
<s> heh heh) </s>
<s> what exactly does that mean? </s>
<s> I have an external hard drive that has a broken motor (I'm pretty sure). </s>
<s> I've tried everything. </s>
<s> Do you think repeatedly connecting to power wouold do any good at all? </s>
<s> I am seriously considering slamming it on something. </s>
<s> does that include connecting it to an internal port in the PC? </s>
<s> I'd think a broken motor would cause a distinctive sound or lack of one. </s>
<s> There is the old freezer method which I've never tried and skeptical of anyway but I've heard others swear it works. </s>
<s> and I also tried the freezer method, which also didn't work. </s>
<s> It does make a distinctive noise... an intermittent beeping which is supposedly the sign of a damaged motor for Maxtor drives. </s>
<s> So I guess I am out of luck. </s>
<s> I'd really like to get the data back, but not enough to want to pay a retrieval service big bucks. </s>
<s> Maybe I WILL try slamming it. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I have personally experienced that this method sometimes works and sometimes doesnt. </s>
<s> But its always worth a few tries. </s>
<s> Its always best to submit such drives to data recovery experts. </s>
<s> Absent that, you can always buy a working used replica of your drive and very carefully swap-out the data disks. </s>
