I have various Pentium III computers, 450MHz to 866MHz, that will not use this type of memory but will use double-sided 100MHz memory and I have on order memory for these computers. But I want to put this other single-sided 133MHz memory to good use instead of it just sitting around. This memory was pulled from working computers (which I no longer have) but I know the memory is good.

I know the memory works because my friend showed that it did before he gave it to me. On one system the bios sees the stick as 256 on one slot and 64 on the other. boots until right before the logon screen then reboots. On the other system it doesn't recgonise it at all and beeps. I want to know what is the problem here... Is it just incompatable? is the memory bad? is the cl rating too high to be supported on the Motherboards?
