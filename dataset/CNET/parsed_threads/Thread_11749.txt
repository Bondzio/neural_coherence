<s> Hi, there's a serious problem with my PC and I'm certain that it's a hardware problem. </s>
<s> Computer has been acting weird for a while - I've been getting a blue screen of death once in a while when booting. </s>
<s> Now it's completely dying on me! </s>
<s> BIOS won't detect my secondary hard drive & neither one of the CD-ROM drives that I have. </s>
<s> I checked the hard drive on my friend's computer - the hard drive is fine.. </s>
<s> I checked all the jumpers, wiring, and settings - everything is fine [even replaced the cables]! </s>
<s> Now, I can't tell what the problem is here.. </s>
<s> I have two guesses - my power supply [it's fan doesn't sound too good] or could be the motherboard [which I haven't had any problems with for two years now].. Any suggestions/ideas? </s>
<s> I have an MRI ATA133 motherboard with Athlon XP 2100+ on WinXP.. </s>
<s> PLEASE HELP!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> You might also want to try scanning for viruses, spyware, etc., while the drive is in your friend's computer. </s>
<s> ...hooked up to your friend's computer, you might want to backup your important files in case you need to reinstall Windows. </s>
<s> I wouldn't hestitate to offer that you replace the power supply(psu). </s>
<s> It will cause flaky operation and effect everything and appears its this or that. </s>
<s> Replacement is just good insurance even if not the problem and make it a good namebrand and higher wattage psu. </s>
<s> If it was the psu and been acting up for awhile, other componets can take a nose dive or start to fail. </s>
<s> Thus, secondary problems occur and that can be any device/componet. </s>
<s> Remove the CD drives power connections and note that on the bios(not present). </s>
<s> Does it seem the system starts to settle down? </s>
<s> If yes, replace psu. </s>
<s> You can further check the ram as they can also mimick similar problems, but usually you can't fix them, replace only. </s>
<s> They are very, very, very dependant on good stable power. </s>
