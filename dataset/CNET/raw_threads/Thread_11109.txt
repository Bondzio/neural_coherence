When i tried turning it on i got a black screen after the windows boot logo. I tried connecting a external monitor via the vga port but same thing. I checked all the forums and found out the display drivers were the problem, i went into safe mode(worked:D) and uninstalled them and the laptop seemed to boot up fine but the display was all grainy and big. So i thought the best way to solve this would be to do a complete factory reset. Now after the reset im getting the same problem but this time i cant even boot into safe mode because it says i have to do a &quot;setup new computer&quot; process in normal mode. Please any help will be appriciated. Thanks again

But now the computer is using default vga graphics and i cant get back to the hd ones i was using before which means i also cannot connect my laptop using hdmi. Any ideas? Thanks again

And it's possible it's not Windows 7 compatible. I have an old Vista laptop that will never run 7. Bob

But i remember when i compputer used to work fine i had 2 drivers there (5400 and 4500). Did i install the wrong drivers? Thanks again

Most if not all require us to install motherboard drivers first and then drivers for that model net/lap top. These are sometimes not on the maker's web site. Here's an example where the drivers were hidden on some FTP site. http://forums.cnet.com/7726-7587_102-2699006.html Owners would never find those. Bob

Hopefully this should work. Thanks again

Here it is again. DRIVER INSTALL ORDER MATTERS. Again, motherboard drivers may need to be installed before a video driver. This is true for almost any system I've encountered. More? Sure. I find a lot of folk lose months over this. After a few years of this my best advice is to use the recovery media for this laptop. Bob

I did try installing the motherboard drivers and then the display drivers but i started getting the blank screen like before so i had to go into safe mode and take them off. Now my computer is using just default vga display drivers. Thanks again everyone for your help

Many of these use a restore partition. So both those are free. Installing a clean copy of a retail Windows is, today asking a lot of everyday users. I gave an example of a chat at hp.com but it's been days so I'm wondering why you didn't try that? If you end up ordering restore media, it costs. Not as much as a Windows license so it's a bargain.

2262	14	595384	5469911	5469895	R. Proffitt	6/21/13 9:38 AM	1.37180748E12	Link, comment.	http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-PC-Sound-and-Audio-e-g-Windows-8/HP-DV7-4020sa-No-HDMI-audio/td-p/734775 Yes that points to a driver issue. Keep in mind that if you didn't use the restore media but some other OS then you often get to chat with HP what drivers and what order they need to be installed in. -&gt; But that's HALF the story. Today we have HELPER APPLICATIONS that add support for things like enabling video ports and more. I can't guess which it is for this model, so back to HP. Another strong nod to restore media. Bob
