i trust cccleaner, i have tried also advanced windows care v2 personal and also glary utilities.
i believe in registry cleaners.
i think you should use them.
first, read them carefully and work with settings.
second, you should check start menu.
maybe there are few softs that start together with the sistem.
advanced windows care v2 personal is very good at this.
if there are few softs to start with the sistem, they will slow the sistem, of course.
good luck!
