The cpu is just about 2.2 ghz at stock and I already tried to look in the BIOS to change the clock multipliter, frequency settings, or voltage settings, but it seems like eMachines hid those settings from me, probably so they would get less service calls. And now I would like to know if there are any software programs that wold let me overclock through windows or if there is anything to do in the BIOS, I tell you I looked everywhere and I can't find anything in there. Any help would greatly be appreciated, thank you.

I would also be getting a 128 bit memory controller, oppose to a 64 bit. Not to mention, I would be doubling my L2 cache to a whole 1mb. For about $250, I think that might sound pretty good.
