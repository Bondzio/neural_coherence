<s> Hey everyone. </s>
<s> I'm looking for a NAS System. </s>
<s> I really don't want a noisy External HD in my room on at all times next to my Sony Vaio laptop, so I'm looking at a NAS for my home Network so I can leave it on downstairs and access it anytime. </s>
<s> I've been looking tirelessly at the options reviewed by CNet, but can't seem to find the right solution. </s>
<s> I want something that... - Can accept a 250GB+ NTFS FileSystem (for importing video...I pass that 4GB mark after 18 minutes of recording) - Has a RJ45 port for my router as well as Firewire/USB Connections (for a direct connection to my laptop if I need additional speed, or the network stops working...) - Can be accessed via FTP (If possible...so I can access my NAS anywhere) The challenge is to find something that can accomadate all this. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any idea what I should consider buying? </s>
<s> http://cgi.ebay.com/300-GB-NAS-Network-Attached-Storage-USB-2-0-Hard-Drive_W0QQitemZ8822363384QQihZ005QQcategoryZ116258 QQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem This 300GB NAS Drive seems to meet almost all my wants, but the FAT32 HD can't be converted...there must be something out there like this that supports NTFS. </s>
<s> The guy selling it also seems to get a lot of complaints about the NAS systems he sells, so I don't really want to buy it. </s>
<s> First the problem with FAT32 is that the maximum filesize is 4 gigabyte. </s>
<s> For our office our first NAS was given away due to that limit. </s>
<s> Next the real issue came home is even at 100 megabit the transfer rates are quite slow. </s>
<s> Your average USB 2.0 is some double to quadruple that speed. </s>
<s> The internal drive double or more than again. </s>
<s> See the Slowski's commercial? </s>
<s> With a little google you can find other NAS with the better Linux or NTFS (file systems) and maybe you can more to gigabit network speeds to cure the speed issue. </s>
<s> I now have the Dlink NAS, but the speed issue is still there until we upgrade the network switch to gigabit speed. </s>
<s> In closing, I think you'll be disappointed even if the filesystem is fixed. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I see...thank you for your response. </s>
<s> If speeds are an issue, I may have to live with an External HD in my room. </s>
<s> Speed is important when I import from Adobe Premiere, so I may have to live with a noisy HD in my room. </s>
