making claims making intel slower back comparing mhz mhz hell pentium iii kick teeth mhz mhz pentium heavily modified pentium based kicks cases teeth low ghz clock speed means nothing operational

really atinvidia battle ati lack features part terms future use performance ati lacks shader model requirement keeps ati having directx certified part currently nvidia dx cert part lack sm fact radeon uses fp fp fp between isnt such big deal wont yearish probably why ati didnt go fp nvidia notorious advancing things beyond time requires sm however something required atis radeon series cards issues farcry cases flat wont play game radeon already known unsupportive halflife expansion due amazingly inferior technology geforce fx isnt honestly radeon going support halflife expansion yet going support geforce issue going power current estimates say yes geforce issues enough power features geforce sit say ati nvidia equals ati usually nets higher benchmark scores usually nets acceptance performance crowd due various rma policies adapted few their oems question asked rmas nice youve fried card ocing free sans postage nvidia always higher tech features supported newer games older hardwareits how put dfx business gods sake consider dfx supported nothing higher bit color until vsa nvidia bit yrs time refined refined direct support something dfx issues nvidia runs ahead pack terms technolgy currently terms performance waste money radeon radeon already outdated require replacement christmas play game go cpu comparison cpu depends doing talking absolute fastest cpu world ignoring software side probably without question itanium upcoming itanium talking fastest cpu world terms gaming questions asked amds athlon fx talking fastest cpu world terms dualcored amd exception intel reigns over amd thing few years video encoding amd slow compare subwebaddr aside fact reply until show maturity intelligence saying sitting telling amd inferior due clock speed while thg sitting showing time time time amd wins sit tell ati say who cares view isnt right view opinion opinion nvidia their drivers ease use multimonitor display systems compared ati facts however show nvidia features ati lacks ati adding features their release adding why their needed why add why dies retapped didnt work speced features arent needed why spend millions dollars developing gpu use simmilar features competition why ati behind nvidia arent compatable latest version directx ultimatly determines games play wont write digging rubbish emulation sm tell right expensive say expensive terms performance cost process oh good radeon little paperweight given how slow thing ooze through sm emulation benchmarking come talk too everest designed compare systems accurate benchmark calculates oddly commonly accepted nor anyone toylike uguru free doesnt require abit motherboard were take system mhz amd athlonxp mhz underclocked geforce gt run correct speed tell right dmark scores around mhz around mhz cpu score however change bit drastically dmark same except isnt going score comparing probably ghz pentium ee using fsb giving over gbs bandwidth lucky comparing cpu could called limited edition due short shelf life thing cannot should thats comparing dodge viper geo metro assuming fully stock using identical grade fuels brand unflawed saying metro should winning consider viper metroaside costing around dozen times hp over twice cylinders fair metro amd comparable power however run intel such fx fx fx eat alive given unwilling learn unwilling horse take good computers doing stick personally sick trying explain understand most people fall prey intels marketing design behind pentium chip clocks high people matter youve fallen intel openly admitted launch willamette intel were faster why ths gamers enthusiasts use amd why enthusiast benchmarkers who score close dmark use amd intel why use amd need wake smell lies intel designed netburst willamette marketing ploys intel realizes pentium run too fast keep amd consider pentium amd were mhz mhz why ghz amds fastest chip ghzwhy stop why didnt too hot doesnt help their fight against amd slower slower sit tell wrong reply going ha beat scared beaten goes show given information people prefer blatant ignorance raw stupidity versus accepting were wrong being man woman assuming male letting someone teach wouldnt walk mechanics shop say going build car roughly needs tell wise id help enough cars car building components id need start let alone worknot work claiming us inferior why go build little system time psu free case junk burns everything rebuild come back trying talk big explain why didnt work around time nd junk psu should give youll start accepting our advice youll man woman realize arent man woman someone might their talking reason done helping sick tired dealing immaturity inability accept advice being given someone who done many times who knows rather fair deal doing trying steer wrong direction advice geared towards getting most power least cash youd say ati vs nvidia same personal pref id agree were sm reality were back id saying go go ati given while viable solution radeon geforce fx general design tables turned amd intel amd brought athlon intel hasnt performance throne dual core intels advantage video encodingi mean going spend cpu intel perform lesser amd equivalent ill warn amds dual cores coming expensive disagree seriously inable accept advise going throw money away retail boxed hds over buying sata cables seperate saving going buy radeon upgrade xmas end spending around gfx could going spend cpu less performance everything except thing wont doing unless main goal stated main goal going estimated waste december show go against thats insane could care less could care less walk away going man ozos guy idiot wish hed die care waste money sense deal crying needing upgrade months seeing people waste money falling marketing ploys people drive walls burns really hell bent accepting advice got most hard headed person ever met addition mb percantage guessing mean mbs low terms ram bandwidth juding systems power speed boot speed few things affect boot speed mainly psu time power good signal faster faster system start boot process average around ms bios settings depending during boot depends how fast post os choice depending os using depends how fast loads others finally cpu clock speed doesnt really difference long youve met windowsxp min req around mhz could mhz pentium chose ensure far enough over min req mhz pentium side side using
