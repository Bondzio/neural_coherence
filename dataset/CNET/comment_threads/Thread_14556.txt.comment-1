I was just told this video card was no good.
No good because of it's price.
My question is this.
It's a new Video Card with not 128MB RAM but with 512MB RAM.
Does this make any difference?
Well you know for future games.
Also crossfire only works if you have two video cards and two pci-e slots right, well and a mobo that can handle crossfire right?
