I was restarting my desktop when a power surge went through my room.
My ATXPW550 power source was spewing dense smoke through both the front and especially the back of the PC.
I want to know if the damage would be isolated to the power source or could it have corrupted other vital components as well?
I know, I should have used a surge protector.
But times are tough.
I need this info to know what credit to claim from my landlord.
