1.1.2	Our technician left system running overnight to run through various sequences to validate proper operation .	St
1.1.3	In the morning system had crashed with the harddrive mechanically 'stuck ' .	St
1.1.4	The drive seems mechanically 'damaged ' and refuses to spin on this and also other machines in our lab .	St
1.1.5	What ( if any ) can I do to recover data at reasonable cost .	St
1.1.6	HELP ! !	St

1.2.1	Look up DRIVESAVERS and ONTRACK with http : //www.google.com Everyone seems to learn about backup of what they ca n't lose this way .	St
1.2.2	CDR drives and disks are pretty cheap and if you can support a DVD recorder , a 4.7GB R/W media is 2 bucks and the drive is 79 to 199 bucks .	St
1.2.3	Which will be less than your recovery costs .	St
1.2.4	Best of luck , Bob	Polite
