I have a new computer with OS Windows XP Home Edition, I'm trying to install my old hard drive OS WIN 98 SE, so I can swap files, the Bios recognize , and the Disk Management of XP show the disk and says it is active and &quot;healthy&quot;, but It does'nt show on My Pc, or any other place.
What can I do???
Thanks for the Help!
