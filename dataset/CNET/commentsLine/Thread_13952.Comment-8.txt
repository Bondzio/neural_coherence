why is the hard disk suspect?
if so try the hard disk makers disk test software.
keep the cover off for now.
also, a complete list of what was running at the time of the crash (use tasklist) would be nice as well as a short story about all the lovely drivers you installed after you were done with the windows cd.
as well share that all the fans are spinning.
