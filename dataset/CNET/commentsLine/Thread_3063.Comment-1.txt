my compaq presario 5bwn21 desktop pc has been having problems with the cd-rw drive.
last night i had to go inside of the tower to look at the hard drive, which means in my case, i had to remove the cd-rw drive.
anyway, i got the computer back together and everything was fine except for the cd-rw drive.
all of the cables are hooked up, and it blinks and lights up at startup, but windows 98se dosen't detect it.
i went under the system icon and checked the device maganger and it dosen't list it.
however, it does list my other cd-rom drive.
i contacted compaq and they told me to boot into safe mode and uninstall the drivers there.
i tried to do that; the computer will not let me boot into saft mode; however, when i woke up this morning, it let me boot into safe mode.
then everything started to work; i got the thing to work, then the computer froze and i had to restart; once again, it wouldn't let me boot into safe mode.
i contacted compaq again, they told me to make a win 98 bootable diskette so i could restore the computer to an earlier time; i did that.
still wouldn't let me boot into safe mode.
anyway, please help me!!!
i just want the computer to get into safe mode.
the computer: compaq presario 5bwn21, windows 98 se, 128mb ram, 20gb hard drive, lg ced-8080b cd-rw drive.
