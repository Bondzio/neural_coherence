in that case i have to pass.
i was under the impression the printer connection to the router was fine; &quot; i have managed to set up my printer's wifi just fine.
it appears connected on the printer's screen &quot;.
may be bob's observation is right.
his surfboard didn't have wifi.
he asked if you had a different model.
