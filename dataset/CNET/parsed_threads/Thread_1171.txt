<s> My 2-year-old Logitech Optical Wheel Mouse (M-BJ58) seems to be less responsive for the past week. </s>
<s> It will be working fine, then it will become lazy and barely follow my movements. </s>
<s> Is there any maintenance I can perform to bring its performance back to standard, or must I buy a new mouse? </s>
<s> If so, which would you recommend for a: HP Pavilion Pentium 4 CPU, 2 Ghrtz, 512 RAM running WinXP Home, Service Pack 1? </s>
<s> There's no real maint. </s>
<s> done to the mouse other than making sure the bottom is clean. </s>
<s> You should clean-up the system to see if recent installs, etc. </s>
<s> aren't tasking the system resources. </s>
<s> Review &quot;startup&quot; pgms. </s>
<s> remove little used pgms. </s>
<s> etc. </s>
<s> for a better overall operationg system. </s>
<s> Plus, using the latest AV updates check for virus, trojans, and worms. </s>
<s> Also, any malware that Spybpt or Ad-Aware may find intrusive. </s>
<s> If none of this seems to clear up the problem, then maybe the mouse is bad. </s>
<s> Logitec is the best for this type of mouse, but any other should perform as well. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> I had this problem once, was caused by quicktime running mem resident. </s>
<s> may not be your problem, but . </s>

<s> Clean the inside of the mouse. </s>
<s> If this is a standard ball type mouse, unscrew the bottom with a simple twist and take out the ball. </s>
<s> Make sure it's free of dust. </s>
<s> then, take an eraser and clean the roll bars, they may have deposits of grime and dirt that are making the roller ball slip. </s>
<s> you shouldn't have to replace it. </s>
<s> good luck. </s>
