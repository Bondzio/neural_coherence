Sorry, for a few days life went from being hetic to staying up until 3:00 am to get my work done.
I did find the time to download Network Magic, and it looks promising, but one of the computers have now started acting up on me and I must reformate it.
So, I will try it later.
Thanks for all your help.
I am going to look over what you sent me and see what else I can do.
Raymon
