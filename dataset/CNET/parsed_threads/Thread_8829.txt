<s> The same red light appears after 13 second. </s>
<s> Subsequently I did the following: I checked all the cog wheels for improper action. </s>
<s> I disconnected the moving printer carriage from Printer Motor I disconnected and reset all the internal connector stips and cables (with exception of the power connection). </s>
<s> However the Red light continues to appear exactly 13 seconds after startup, even with all internal connectors out and printer carriage disconnected. </s>
