<s> Is there an esy way to share particular files and folders (mainly music & picures) so all computers on my wireless network will have access? </s>
<s> The main computer is running XP Home, the other two run XP Pro. </s>
<s> through your XP or other firewall, then set the appropriate folder to be shared. </s>
<s> All sharing group members need to be on the same workgroup. </s>
<s> Like the prev poster said, make sure they are all on the same workgroup. </s>
<s> To verify this, RIGHT click on your my computer icon and select properties. </s>
<s> Click the computer name tab. </s>
<s> Then click the change button. </s>
<s> Now change the workgroup name to whatever you like, this will need to be done on each pc. </s>
<s> Change it to any name you like, just not the default. </s>
<s> To enable file sharing find the folder you want to share on the network. </s>
<s> RIGHT click on it and select sharing and security. </s>
<s> There should be a button to enable file sharing. </s>
<s> Click the one that says just enable file sharing. </s>
<s> Then click the box that says share this file/folder on the network. </s>
<s> Now you should be able to view all of the files/folders by accessing the &quot;My Network Places&quot; icon in you start menu or control panel. </s>
<s> Let me know if this works. </s>
