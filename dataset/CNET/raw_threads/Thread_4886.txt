I just finished customizing my computer on cyberpowerpc.com and was about to checkout when I realized they only ship to the States. Does anyone know of a site like Cyberpower PC for Canadians? I want one that gives you COMPLETE customization options like Cyberpower. thanx

They allow complete customozation of the system, but they're expensive as hell. There's also Falcon Northwest , but they're also very pricey.
