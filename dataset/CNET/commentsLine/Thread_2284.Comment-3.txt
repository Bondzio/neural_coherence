...would be to maybe buy last years imac.
i have the bubble-based imac with 17&quot; flat panel with 768megs of ram, and it works flawlessly.
but more ram is always a good thing.
i've been editing for 4 years on this without a glitch.
of course, i have only used imovie for editing, so final cut or final cut express may prove me wrong.
although i've uses idvd for burning dvds, lately i've used toast.
by the way (i'm sure you know this), make sure you get a mac with a super drive so you can burn dvds.
