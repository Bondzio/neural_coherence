7408	0	559187	5290573	NR	J_Arbegust	3/25/12 8:56 AM	1.33266576E12	Is there a &quot;settings&quot; app for Glaxay brand GPU's?	I just ordered a Galaxy brand GTX 680 and was wondering if there was an app that allowed me to control fan speeds, overclocking and such. Something like eVGA Precision. I've looked but can't seem to find anything yet. Thanks so much for any help!
