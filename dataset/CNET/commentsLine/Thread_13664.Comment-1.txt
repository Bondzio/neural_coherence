i have a belking f5d7230-4 router.
everytime comcast changes my ip address (they do it all the time), i lose my connection.
i have to unplug the router and replug to get it to work.
this is a real pain.
belkin has had me reinstall firmware and even replaced the router.
same problem.
there must be a setting somewhere.
does anyone have an idea about this?
thanks.
