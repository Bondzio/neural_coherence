<s> I am in Bulgaria (that is the hard part)and I am stuck with using a Vodafone USB modem in conjunction with a mobile operator to access the internet. </s>
<s> I have a laptop and a desktop system both running XP Home. </s>
<s> In a different life the two systems have been connected in many different ways but I have gone back to simplicity, a cross-over cable, to connect them. </s>
<s> The internet connection is slow enough as it is but it would be nice to have both systems accessing the internet at the same time so, in that regard, I am using ICS with the desktop system dialing up. </s>
<s> However, the laptop is also set up to dial up using bluetooth in conjunction with my mobile phone and wirelessly with a usb stick (for when I am on the road) and the desktop system is also set up to do this (I don't take it on the road though). </s>
<s> The network is hit and miss, sometimes the laptop sees the desktop, sometimes it doesn't and sometimes the desktop sees the laptop and sometimes it doesn't. </s>
<s> I have had internet access working ok (once) using the approach that I want (i.e. </s>
<s> laptop accessing internet through desktop that dials up using Vodafone USB modem, all other methods work ok) but now it is not working. </s>
<s> Not only is it not working but currently the laptop can't see the desktop and vice versa. </s>
<s> It isn't a big deal as I have lots of other methods for transferring information between the two but sometimes my partner would like to be accessing the internet at the same time as me and other times it would be nice to sit in a more comfortable chair, with the laptop, in front of the tv, while accessing the internet. </s>
<s> This is simple stuff. </s>
<s> It is, isn't it? </s>
<s> There must be a definitive setup that would enable me to access internet using modem from laptop access internet using bluetooth/mobile phone from laptop access internet from wireless stick from laptop access internet using ICS thru desktop system from laptop access internet using modem from desktop access internet using bluetooth/mobile phone from desktop access internet from wireless stick from desktop without me having to pull my hair out every time that I change method. </s>
<s> Currently the systems can't see each other. </s>
<s> I have plugged the cable in (to laptop, it is permanently connected to desktop). </s>
<s> When I &quot;repair connection&quot; it won't because DNS cache needs clearing. </s>
<s> When I use ipconfig /dnsflush on both systems it tells me there is an error. </s>
<s> There must be a definitive way that these two systems are brought up? </s>
<s> There must be definitive settings for all the connection methods? </s>
<s> Surely I don't have to change any settings when I switch between them do I? </s>
<s> And, why can't they see each other, invariably after they have been separated and then rebooted? </s>
<s> And why can't they see each other now? </s>
<s> To use EVDO modems with multiple machines I wish anyone well that must attempt ICS (I know better.) </s>
<s> Look at 3gstore.com and think again about that router. </s>
