<s> Hi there! </s>
<s> I'm not a newbie by all means, however I'm curious if anyone has any constructive advice? </s>
<s> A friend of mine has a P4 MDG-built, Intel motherboard PC which now cannot power on. </s>
<s> It was in this condition at my arrival at the scene of the crime. </s>
<s> An inexeperienced individual has been fiddling around with the corrections, and after finishing, the computer allegedly never powered on afterwards. </s>
<s> I reconnected all of the loose and missing cables to their correct places, and tested the power supply (using a paperclip to connect green to black wires on the power supply's 24-pin connector). </s>
<s> When I plug the 24-pin connector back into the motherboard, the LED on the motherboard and the front of the computer lights up. </s>
<s> However when I attempt to power the computer up, nothing happens. </s>
<s> Anyone have any ideas? </s>
<s> I'm out... </s>
<s> Either the mobo is busted and needs to be replaced/fixed, or I missed some connectors? </s>
<s> Could it be that the power supply is only half-busted? </s>
<s> It could be that the button is not plugged into the right spot (doubtful), but I've tried manually connecting the two pins with a knife, etc. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, sorry for the long message. </s>
<s> TIA </s>
<s> 1) Do all the fans work? </s>
<s> 2) Does the light on the Motherboard light up? </s>
<s> 3) Take the battery out and put it back, to set to default. </s>
<s> 4) If the above is negative start with power supply diagnostic. </s>
<s> Try shuffling the RAM around to different slots. </s>
<s> Sometimes there is a bad slot on the motherboard, sometimes the memory won't work in certain slots, sometimes it will stop working where it has worked before. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work, consider that the only components you need to have connected in order to POST (not boot into Windows) the board are: Power Supply CPU RAM Video Card That's it. </s>
<s> Unplug absolutely everything else and use the knife to short the the power pins. </s>
<s> If this doesn't work, unplug all the RAM and try it again. </s>
<s> Sometimes you have to make the connections between the pins for a couple of seconds. </s>
<s> Does the system beep at you when it didn't before? </s>
<s> You probably have bad RAM. </s>
<s> If it doesn't beep, try putting the RAM back in and taking the video card out, etc. </s>
<s> Try a different power supply. </s>
<s> Try a different CPU. </s>
<s> ood luck </s>
<s> Sounds like somethings not right...so look for these problems in no particular order 1 loose memory in slot 2 Loose video card in slot 3 Motherboard has switch plugs. </s>
<s> They need to be right backwards won't work on some boards. </s>
<s> I don't think it's a bad motherboard if the fans spin sometimes clear CMOS either by jumper or remove battery.... </s>
<s> The only way I can get ANYTHING to change from pure dead state is by connecting the connectors on the power-supply 24-pin cable. </s>
<s> At this point, the HD, CDROM, FLOPPY, and only the POWERSUPPLY-FAN begins to work. </s>
<s> I can't get to see the screen run because this way, the motherboard isn't connected, therefor no video card. </s>
<s> Could RAM or CPU really be the problem? </s>
<s> Surely I would get some sort of response from trying to power on even without it? </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> be tested with a mobo with no components installed laying on a piece of cardboard or any insulated surface. </s>
<s> Plug the Power supply into the AC outlet [switch on rear on]. </s>
<s> No components mounted to mobo, no CPU, no memory, no nuttin. </s>
<s> With the 24 pin power supply cable connected, simply use the tip of a small flat screwdriver to momentarily [very momentary] short the two Front Power switch pins on the mobo together. </s>
<s> The supply should turn on [its fan rotates] and stay on. </s>
<s> You can turn it off by shorting the pins again, possibly need to hold for 4 to five seconds to shut it off. </s>
<s> If the supply does not turn on the mobo is bad. </s>
<s> One should do this test when first removing the mobo from the box and before mounting anything. </s>
<s> If the supply doesn't turn on at this point things ain't going to get any better. </s>
