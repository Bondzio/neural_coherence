... the laser failed to calibrate or some such thing (I never saved it to dig deeper).
I just pop in another blank disc until I find one will burn.
I usually end up with 1 disc out of 6 that won't burn.
This is using Disc Utility to burn Disc Images on an external Sony DVD burner DRX-820.
I also use Popcorn and/or Toast 6 Lite (which came with the burner) but don't recall problems with those programs.
