I have kept the HDD (has XP sp1 installed) around because there is some data on it that I want to keep. I built a new computer with Vista installed, and I threw this old HDD into it to recover the stuff I wanted off it. I'm able to access the HDD, but I can't open any files or copy any files out of the &quot;owner&quot; folder because I don't have admin permissions on the drive. I'm assuming this is because the admin name/password on my new computer are different than on the one this HDD was in. I don't remember the password or admin name of that old computer either...I might be able to guess it, but when I go into the security properties it only gives me the options to select my current user acct or my current admin acct. I was wondering if there is a way to trick it into just letting me copy the files off and accessing them on the HDD with Vista on it, cause right now I can't even copy them.
