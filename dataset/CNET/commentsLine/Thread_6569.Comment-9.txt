well, tried everything, router 1 works just fine but if i restart and try to connect to router 2 (by connecting my pc wired to router 2), it won't issue me a valid ip, only an auto private address.
if i go to properties and try to force the pc to use the ip 192.168.1.2 (the one that i configured the router(2) to use), it won't let me, it'll tell me that the static ip is already in use on the network... perhaps this isn't possible with my configuration?
i'll diagram it if it helps... internet&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;router 1 (actiontec) (wired pcs connected)&gt;&gt;&gt;router 2 (wifi netgear)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wifi and other pcs router 2 is connected through a standard ethernet cable, from port 1 on router 1 to the &quot;internet&quot; ethernet imput on the netgear.......
