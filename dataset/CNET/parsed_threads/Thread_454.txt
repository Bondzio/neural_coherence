<s> hi there, i bought a transcend 4gb basic SD-card (NOT SDHC) a year ago and am wondering about the shelf life for transcend branded SD-cards. </s>
<s> if i do not use the card AT ALL, how long will data inside last? </s>
<s> i've got some really precious family photos in there that i'd like to not die out as quick as my burnt discs. </s>
<s> thanks for helping! </s>
<s> You're not going to find shelf life statistics. </s>
<s> There are just too many variables involved. </s>
<s> Your better plan would be to keep multiple backups of what is critical and be prepared to transfer them to newer technology as it becomes available and standardized. </s>
<s> Consider that in years to come, you may have difficulty finding a reader for your SD card even if the card is still good. </s>
<s> You need to review the specs if provided by the maker's website or query there. </s>
<s> Since, there are no moving parts and the only thing really exposed is the &quot;contacts&quot; then expect if anything to happen some form of corrosion. </s>
<s> Thus, keeping to typical protection, provide a cool and dry place and out of sunlight, etc.. </s>
<s> I suspect outside of EMP, ESD(static) or cosmic rays, it can last thousands of yrs. </s>
<s> if not used but for storage. </s>
<s> That's not a wild guess, but of course that should cover the next few yrs.. A figure often mentioned is roughly 10yrs. </s>
<s> just sitting. </s>
<s> What I found is co-called &quot;industrial grade&quot; cards as well, these will last 2M hrs. </s>
<s> of use. </s>
<s> Important word here is &quot;use&quot; which is the cycles of R/W, handling, etc. </s>
<s> and what if any conditions of actual use. </s>
<s> Use keywords, &quot;MTBF of SD card&quot;. </s>

<s> FYI- As you know nothing lasts forever. </s>
<s> The std. </s>
<s> practice still remains keep more than one copy/back-up of any important data. </s>
<s> What follows is the about the most secure practice of keeping data: 1) actual working copy- in use 2) back-up on your schedule to some media and store near-by 3) back-up and store offsite 4) use some NAS/server/RAID(PC) setup besides a back-up as well(redundancy) tada -----Willy </s>
<s> If I'm not mistaken, SD cards rely on trapped electrostatic charge to retain data. </s>
<s> Over a period of time, albeit a long one, this charge can eventually dissipate. </s>
<s> While this is somewhat simplistic, think of it like a really high quality capacitor that eventually will discharge and lose its data. </s>
<s> That's why the ~10 year life limit. </s>
<s> You may get longer life, but I wouldn't think of them as archival. </s>
