you didn't supply any specific models to compare so one could rig the comparison to go either way.
also needed is the intended usage of the scanner.
there's little reason for some 4800 dpi optical scan for pictures you view on your 100 dpi computer monitor.
but you may want such high optical numbers if you are doing archival work.
