The plugs from the case are: PWR LED + (green) PWR LED - (white) POWER SW (double-width plug, two wires, orange and white) RESET SW (double-width plug, two wires, blue and white) SPEAKER (quadruple-width plug, two wires, red and black). The motherboard pins are designated in the manual as follows: Reserved: (1) Message LED: (2)+5V, (3)GND SMI Lead: (4), (5)GND ATX Power Switch: (6), (7)GND Reset SW: (8), (9)GND System Power LED: (10)+5v, (11)NC, (12)GND Keyboard Lock: (13)LOCK, (14)GND Reserved: (15) Speaker Connector: (16)+5V, (17)GND, (18)GND, (19)SPKR

The LED indicators are somewhat optional and if they don't light up, try rotating the connector. In closing, there are other extra connectors or connections. This might confuse a new builder. Bob

If a connector has more/less of a width problem or mounted differently, understand some connectors are &quot;keyed&quot; in order to mount. Draw a picture to better understand how the connections are displayed if just &quot;listed&quot; (ie: J4 to speaker) pins 1-4 Oh yeah, work under good lighting, brother that helps. There, clear as mud. -----Willy
