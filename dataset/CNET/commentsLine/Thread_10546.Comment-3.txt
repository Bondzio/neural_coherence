having your link explains alot(thanks).
as robert offered, replacing the enclosure would be the better fix &quot;if&quot; you can't find another ac wart.
plus, the cost may push you into getting a new enclosure anyways, if you found one.
i also consider this an unique adapter, because of the dual-voltages, so it becomes harder to replace.
check these links:   -or- google away for surplus or used parts vendors.
