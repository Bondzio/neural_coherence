I'm surprised no one told you that 250 Watts was well on the low side of what over 1GHz machines should have.
Live and learn I suppose, but you'll have to be aware that it's time to consider all the parts that were in the machine to be &quot;suspect&quot;.
The last machine I witnessed do that took out everything except a modem and the fans.
The modem dies a few months later.
NEVER OVERTAX A POWER SUPPLY.
