take a metal object like the tip of a screwdriver and try shorting the two pins where you insert the power switch wires from the front panel.leave all the other pins disconnected.
if it starts,its a problem with your front panel headers.if it still doesnt start,atleast you know there's nothing wrong with your front panel connections.then we can look at what else could be the problem
