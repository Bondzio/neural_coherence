no, i haven't used the logitech drivers, it was a mouse i received from a friend after my last mouse stopped working consistently (i think it had a short in the wire).
i just shut the computer down, plugged the mouse in, and turned the computer on.
i can't remember, but i think the first time, or first couple times, the mouse may have worked in windows ... though maybe not.
aside from logitech drivers, any other suggestions?
