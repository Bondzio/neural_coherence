lpaultracy, I noticed that the power supply on the GT5032 is only 300W max.
The minimum for the GeForce 7800 GT OC PCI Express card is 400W.
Did you also replace the power supply when you tweaked your GT5032?
I'm getting very flaky results with the standard 300W power supply and the BFG help desk said that it was because of the lack of power.
