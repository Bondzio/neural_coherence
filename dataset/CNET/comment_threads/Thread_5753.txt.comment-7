Lock It Xpress to secure folders.
It can only password protect folders (will not lock most System/Program files.)
The only way to access secured folders is though Lock It Xpress.
Lock It Xpress is simple to use, virtually uses no System Resources, only 8 Kb, and is available free at http://mvrao1.tripod.com/lock.html But if you foreget the password foreget your secured folders.
