1.1.1	Hi there, My O/S is corrupted and I need to install it into another machine as a slave, so i can transfer the files I cannot afford to lose off of it, before I format it.	St
1.1.2	Is this possible, and if so, can someone explain how.	St
1.1.3	thanks Daren	Polite
1.2.1	Sorry, should have said need to transfer hard drive to another machine, not O/S.	St
1.3.1	Today's machines use 80 conductor IDE cables and all drives set to CABLE SELECT.	St
1.3.2	I only need to find an open IDE connection and plug the drive there and then the power, then power up to get at the files.	St
1.3.3	If you don't have 80 conductor IDE cables then you get to learn about jumpers.	St
