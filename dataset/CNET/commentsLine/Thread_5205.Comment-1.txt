i wan just wondering if there are some gaming netbooks out there?
at least ones of being capable to play those free mmorpgs that are out there.
if not 3d gaming, could i still run mame on one?
if anyone has a netbook they'd like to suggest i'd really appreciate it.
i've seen the asus n10, but it's a little out of my price range.
