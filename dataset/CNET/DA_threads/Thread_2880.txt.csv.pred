1.1.1	I just recently bought a new video card , an ATI Radeon 9250 256mb AGP card .	St
1.1.2	My old card was an ATI Radeon 7200 64mb AGP card .	St
1.1.3	When I went to switch them out my computer did n't recognize the new one yet it still runs fine with the old one .	St
1.1.4	Basically my monitor never recieves a signal and it gives me the error sound of a long beep followed by 2 short beeps .	St
1.1.5	I hooked the card up to another older computer running a Nvidia GeForce PCI card and it booted up fine .	St
1.1.6	The old computer is 5 years older than mine .	St
1.1.7	I 've tried everything I can think of and I 'm stumped .	St
1.1.8	Any help would be appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	perhaps you have a mobo that ca n't accept an agp 4x/8x card .	St
1.3.1	I have an Aopen MX34 motherboard .	St
1.3.2	I ran some checks and looked on the site and it said the AGP port was 1x 2x and 4x .	St
1.4.1	This is not a problem .	St
1.4.2	What is a problem is , & quot ; You have n't installed the new card & quot ; .	St
1.4.3	You ca n't until you UNinstall the old one .	St
1.4.4	Open & quot ; Device Manager & quot ; and remove old card , go to Control Panel , Add/Remove and remove software for old card .	St
1.4.5	Shut down .	St
1.4.6	Then you can remove old card and install new card .	St
1.4.7	XP ( or any other OS ) will then see new card when you boot up .	St
1.4.8	A piece of advice , I have noticed on a lot of hardware ( even newer stuff ) will not install from XP & quot ; Autorun & quot ; .	St
1.4.9	My ATI 9250 card is one of them .	St
1.4.10	When you put the disc in , stop Autorun and open disc manually .	St
1.4.11	First read the instructions ( may be README file ) .	St
1.4.12	Important .	St
1.4.13	Sometimes things have to installed in a certain order , and some things may not be necessary for your computer .	St

1.5.1	When you installed the new card in the old PC and it booted up OK , were you using the same monitor or a different one ?	Ques
1.5.2	It 's very rare that a video card and monitor have a compatibility issue ( with a particular motherboard ) but I have encountered such things on very rare occasions .	St
1.5.3	Try a different monitor if you have one ( this would be the easiest first step to trouble-shoot the problem ) .	St
1.5.4	If this does n't work , check to see if your motherboard bios is the latest revision available .	St
1.5.5	If not , update and try again .	St
1.5.6	Does your system bios have options for AGP ?	Ques
1.5.7	If so , make sure you select the right compatibility mode for your new configuration .	St
1.5.8	Hope this helps ... Cindy	St
