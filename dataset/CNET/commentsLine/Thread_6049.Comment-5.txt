i feel really sorry for your pc , that's pathetic nobody gave you any helpful reply for this.
anyways if u would have this kind of situation any other time.
to check what kind of ram memory u have in your computer.
go to  and scan your computer.
it will exactly tell you what kind of memory your computer has.
that's right your ram memory will tell ur computer speed and has nothing to do with ur data retrieval.
but anyways if u need any other help please post it here
