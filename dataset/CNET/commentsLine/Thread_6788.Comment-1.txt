i cannot get my ati all in wonder 9800 agp to post when combined with the asus a8n deluxe mb.
the ati board works on an older asus mb and the mb works with a pci video board.
after much conversation with the ati people i am concerned that the agp slot in the mb is defective.
has anyone gotten this combination to work?
the ati people won't comment on this, and the asus people will not reply.
thanks, david
