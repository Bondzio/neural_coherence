Hi, I got another 512 ram through today to add to my 1 gig of memory I already have.
But when I install it, the computer just holds on the motherboard Splash page.
I am running: winxp sp2 2x Samsung 512 memory (new is Crucial 512 memory) p4p800s-e deluxe motherboard I know all the slots and memory sticks work as I have juggled them around to test them all, its just the motherboard doesnt like having more than 2 sticks in at a time.
And I am sure the motherboard will take up to 3 GIG of ram.
I cant think what it can be at the moment, so any suggestions will be appreciated.
Thanks
