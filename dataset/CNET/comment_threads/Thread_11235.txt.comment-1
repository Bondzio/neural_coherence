I'm going to be living on campus next semester and I'll be lacking a Television.
I'm curious if it is possible to connect a Wii to my MacBook Pro and use the MacBook as a screen to play my games on.
If anyone knows anything about this, please let me know if it's possible, and how or what I need to buy in order to accomplish this.
