require you to enter the user name and password from the ISP into the routers setup page.
Other ISPs will give you a modem/router to use and when adding another router you may need to adjust the ISP's modem/router's settings.
So without more information being given, only guesses can be made.
Does the Internet work when connecting the modem directlt to a PC?
