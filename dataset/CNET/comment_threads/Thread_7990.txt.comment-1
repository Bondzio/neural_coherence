I received one reply to another post concerning another topic which was which desktop PC by Velocity Micro was better for basic home office use; the Vector SX-V Value Edition or the Velocity Micro Vector PCX?
The response which I received was the EMachine T6212 was better than either model offered by Velocity Micro.
Do others in this forum agree with that statement or are desktop PC's manufactured by Velocity Micro better than those made by EMachine?
Would the SX-V or Vector PCX be a better desktop PC than the EMachine T6212?
