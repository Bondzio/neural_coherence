I recently bought a Toshiba Libretto 100ct operating on Windows 98se, and included with it was an external floppy drive (PCMCIA connecter). After I plug it in and try and open up a floppy from [my computer; drive a:], it says &quot;A:/ is not accessible, the device is not ready&quot;. Now, after a little research I found out that there is no driver installed so the only way to get files off the floppy is to do a file copy from MS-DOS mode. It tells me to switch in msdos mode to A: , but when I do this it cannot read drive A: ... For this reason, I do not believe that this external floppy drive is considered as drive A: , but do not know what a PCMCIA card command is and how to move files from the floppy to the computer itself. Thanks

If I go into system then hardware profiles, it says something to the extent of &quot;Drive A is using MS-DOS compatibility mode file system&quot;, but won't let me open drive a: in ms-dos mode. This is why I think that an external FDD (PCMCIA) is not considered as a drive.
