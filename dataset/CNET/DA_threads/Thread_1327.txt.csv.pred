1.7.1	Boot up into the BIOS screen .	St
1.7.2	This is done by pressing the DEL key , but it varies from system to system and is shown on your post screen as you are booting up .	St
1.7.3	Check to see if the WOL option ( Wakeup On Lan ) is enabled .	St
1.7.4	There is also may be a modem ring option ... .disable that if it is enabled .	St
1.7.5	See if that helps .	St
