Just to let everyone know, I've yet to find one.
Unless you count the s/w bundle you may get with a new drive or system, don't expect to a freebie out there.
I looked high and low with negative results.
I wanted to head-off so-called complaints of PowerDVD players install for new blu-ray players just wasn't good enough or reliable(upgrades).
While my new player will have PowerDVD it seems others just didn't like it and made bad reviews for it, I hope mine is OK.
Please advise if you locate one.
Thanks -----Willy
