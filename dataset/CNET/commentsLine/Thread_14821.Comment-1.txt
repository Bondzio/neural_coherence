i never thought it could really happen, but my pc did explode this morning.
i was working on it as usual, then i smelled a burning smell, then a loud &quot;pop&quot;, then my machine shut down on its own.
i unplugged and opened it up to see what i could see, but honestly i didn't know what to look for.
i haven't cracked open the power supply yet, but i wouldn't know what to look for.
please help with any suggestions!
i'm so desperate !
!
