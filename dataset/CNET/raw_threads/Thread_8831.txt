8	0	140714	1579432	NR	Murxidon	12/4/05 8:51 AM	1.13368626E12	What games could I play with...	I'm going to upgrade my computer soon. So i'll have: AMD Sempron 3300 2GHZ 1GB RAM Sony 16x/48X DVD ROM Drive Nvidia GeForce 6600 I'm wondering what games I could run smoothly with these specs? I've heard that Sempron is better than Celeron for gaming. I'm particulary interested in playing FPS's, Half Life 2, Far Cry, Halo etc. Could I play these smoothly? (I'm doubting I can play F.E.A.R?)

I would only need to trim back on the display pixel count or size from x by y to 800 by 600 or maybe a few less effects. 2. Not all. Here's why. Many of those games are programmed to take advantage of hardware that has yet to be designed. bob
