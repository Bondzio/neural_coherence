If &quot;case generic&quot; is a mid tower you might want to shop for an Atx mobo. If &quot;case generic&quot; is one of those mini things you might find that psu does not fit.

2256	4	591799	5452627	5452591	bob b	4/29/13 2:10 PM	1.3672446E12	Case	That case supports an atx mobo. Bin that itx thing. Shop for an atx size. http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=100007627%20600093976&IsNodeId=1&name=LGA%201155 Pick one with the features you want. Atx.....not micro atx.

The one you picked will work ...however, why limit your options for more RAM...maybe 8GBs now and 8GBs later or other peripherals....like a better sound capability or perhaps a second GPU. http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=100007627%20600093976&IsNodeId=1&bop=And&Order=RATING&PageSize=100 Re cases....Bob is right there too...you never want a slimline or micro case.........they look great great but once you realize how small and cramped they are and sometimes poorly ventilated ...the sooner you realize the error for now or the future. Let us know how it works out. VAPCMD PS....In the future, suggest providing links to the products you want advice/feedback on. Again the MB you selected will work but may not be best for later as you fill out or expand the system.
