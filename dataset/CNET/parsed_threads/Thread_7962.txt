<s> I want to know if Mac users go through all the security updates like Window users. </s>
<s> I am tired of the updates. </s>
<s> I was told that Mac users don't have security updates like windows. </s>
<s> Is this true? </s>
<s> Macs need fewer (a lot fewer) updates/patches because of two things: * The operating system is much more stable and secure than Windows. </s>
<s> This, in part, comes from its simplicity. </s>
<s> *Such a small percentage of users have a Mac, that hackers don't devote much time to hacking it. </s>
<s> The more people that use it (Windows), the more appealing it is as a target. </s>
<s> Thus, Macs still have security and misc. </s>
<s> updates to download, but not to the extent of its Windows counterpart. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, John </s>
