hi, i just recently upgraded my motherboard to the abit at7-max2.
when using my previous board i'd shut the computer down and the acpi would turn the computer off automatically, and the light on my microsoft wheel mouse optical would go off as well.
since the motherboard upgrade the computer still turns off automatically but the light on the bottom of the mouse stays on.
i have it connected through the ps2 port - i need the other usb ports.
is it a problem and could it wear my mouse out?
