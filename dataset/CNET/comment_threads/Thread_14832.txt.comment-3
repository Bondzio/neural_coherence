If USB-2, it would say so.
Also uses RAMBUS memory.
Hmm.
Big bucks getting that stuff.
Anyway, USB-2 standards were finalized in 2001.
If your board is of that vintage or older, it's not going to work.
A BIOS upgrade doesn't add this feature either.
You'll need an add in card.
BTW, which OS?
Hopefully XP w/SP2.
