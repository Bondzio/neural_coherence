<s> Hi I would like to know if its safe to keep a usb flash key with my backup saved on it in my computor usb drive at all times or when i have finished a backup should i take the usb key out?. </s>
<s> This is because i noticed it flashing red when i was not using it. </s>
<s> and i was wondering why it was flashing and thought it was spyware or was it just windows XP os or firewall checking it. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>

<s> Multiple copies. </s>

<s> Remove the media from the site. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Write protect the media. </s>
<s> There are more but this is not backup as long as there is no write protection, not removed from the computer and no second, third and more copies. </s>
<s> I'm going to answer &quot;no.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> If you open up Windows Explorer or an open/save dialog in most software (which opens up a subset of Explorer), Windows may do a quick scan of what drives are available on the system, thus making your usb drive blink. </s>
<s> No, it's not a good idea, and here's why; a flash drive has a limited life - I've heard 100,000 &quot;writes&quot; mentioned as the limit. </s>
<s> If the drive is flashing, it means that it's being accessed, and it's life being used up. </s>
<s> This is specially true of &quot;journalling&quot; OS's, like NTFS; a read accesses the drive as much as a write. </s>
<s> Burn it to disc(s)and get an external hard drive; most come with backup software. </s>
<s> Yes, and burn that to disc. </s>
<s> Today is a good day to do this. </s>
<s> Bob is absolutely right - if this is your backup - you have no backup if you leave it in the computer. </s>
<s> It's not unknown for USB ports to &quot;spike&quot; which can destroy a Flash drive; if someone accidentally pulls it out without stopping it properly, it can be history (see archive posts) and, of course, some klutz like your pet may knock it and break it. </s>
<s> To be honest, I don't think flash drives are a good long term backup device. </s>
<s> An external hard drive is better and reasonably affordable these days. </s>
<s> Vista has a terrible time with USBs left plugged in. </s>
<s> They can seriously effect the start up of an already slow starting OS. </s>
<s> I kept mine plugged into the back of my PC to run &quot;ready boost&quot; and had loads of problems with it. </s>
<s> There could have been changes made in SP2 to have fixed this problem. </s>
<s> Bottom line for me is, if I can't leave a USB plugged in to run &quot;Ready boost&quot; I will not waste the time plugging one in each time I use my PC. </s>
<s> The small improvement &quot;Ready Boost&quot; provides in performance is simply not worth the effort nor the hassle. </s>
<s> I can understand the logic of keeping backups out of harm's way - up to a point - but I can't go along with the idea that flash or pen drives are any more vulnerable to being damaged or corrupted than any other type of drive - quite the reverse in fact. </s>
<s> All my PC's have USB2 expansion cards installed, with an on-card internal socket; I use a 2 or 4 GB pendrive in that socket as a permanent backup drive for recovery use should the system go down for any reason. </s>
<s> In the case of my Xeon server, the original pendrive is still fully functional after six years of logging site and data changes, plus hit counters and IP logs on a daily basis, so I think the point is proven from that angle. </s>
<s> The other aspect of the equation is that hard drives are heavy, hot and use a lot of power to drive them, which vastly increases the running costs; however the move towards SSHD's is gaining momentum now that initial costs are falling, so we'll probably see the demise of conventional IDE / SATA drives within the nexr ten years or so. </s>
<s> As SSHD's are little more than parallel-banked flash memory modules, I really don't see the distinction between them being of any great importance - the HD version is simply a bigger version of the same thing. </s>
<s> JB. </s>
<s> Thanks every one for the all your helpful advice. </s>
<s> The usb flash key is not my only backup. </s>
<s> I do have cd rw and cd r backup. </s>
<s> There could be something Bob mentioned about the media that i backed up and with the music license that i backed up the write protection and copies. </s>
<s> There is also a possibility what mikebliv said about window explorer doing a quick scan of what drives are available on the system making the usb drive blink. </s>
<s> My usb flash key has 4GB it is a ready boost available. </s>
<s> I do find using it convenient easier than a cd. </s>
<s> I will now not leave the key plugged in the pc as a precaution. </s>
<s> Thanks Hele </s>
