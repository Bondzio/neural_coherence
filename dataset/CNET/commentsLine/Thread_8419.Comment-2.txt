stay at or above the 500:1 contrast ratio.
below that i see murky grey instead of black.
always take a gander at display units.
if they show any defect, don't buy that one.
i've seen the ultracheeps with waves on the display, the salespeople say that's only on the demo unit.
nope... don't get too uptight about going beyond 1024x768 on 15 inch and 1280x1024 on 17 inch displays.
most find the display text gets too small.
even if it is, windows has ways to push up the text sizes.
-&gt; if you know you can live with a 3 year lifespan, your gamble on the warranty.
if it offers a 90 day warranty, don't consider those.
hope this helps, bob
