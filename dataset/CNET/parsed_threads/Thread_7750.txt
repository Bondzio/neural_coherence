<s> there's a computer in my house that has a motherboard that can support both legacy SDRAM, and DDR1 RAM can both types be used together, or are you forced to stick to one type? </s>
<s> The types of memory you can put into a machine is dictated by the motherboard and what it supports. </s>
<s> Just because it fits doesn't mean it will work. </s>
<s> You have more research ahead of you as I know of boards that support both but not at the same time. </s>
<s> Read that manual to see what your board does. </s>

<s> with MBs that have slots for more than one RAM type, you can run one RAM type or the other .... not both. </s>
