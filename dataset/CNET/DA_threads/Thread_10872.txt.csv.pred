1.1.1	I have an older pc which I still want my family to use and I bought a new pc with an lcd monitor that I want to use for professional work but I have no space to put my older pc so I want to know if there is a way that I can connect both my pc to the same monitor so I can switch from work pc to my home pc.	St
1.1.2	Is there a vga cable that I could buy so I can connect them.	St
1.1.3	By the way my monitor only has 1 vga input.	St
1.1.4	Thanks if you help.	St
1.2.1	There exist devices called KVM switches (Keyboard Video Mouse).	St
1.2.2	The best of them are the electronically switched ones, but the only ones I've ever seen in that flavor are 8-way, and quite pricey.	St
1.2.3	A few years ago I purchased a 4 way mechanical switch at a local Mom&Pop computer shop.	St
1.2.4	It was quite reasonable, and has worked fairly well, with only a few minor glitches due to contact problems.	St
1.3.1	Try here.	St
