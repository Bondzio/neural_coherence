But at the office we are working with porting our app over and the input and output is over wifi and bluetooth so given that connection we can input and output to some thousand things. How is that possible? It's over wifi and talks to industrial controllers so please add more to your question. In parting because of the office projects I have quite a few android tablets on hand. The Asus Transformer with it's keyboard dock almost is a netbook in it's own right. Bob

And let's get something else on the table. Once in a while you find folk looking to replace a laptop with these tablets. Most feel burned that it doesn't have the same capabilities. Be sure you are not falling into that trap. Bob

Some 7 inch tablets have all of those ports but for the most part they are missing something. Like the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 has a micro sd card, usb (mini or micro i forget), but no hdmi. Whats your price range, that would help narrow it down.
