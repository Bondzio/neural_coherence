you should be right and the killer was it took 4 for 1 meg - bitts and therefor we ended up with 4 x 9 per megabite - 4 meg of memory took the space of a laptop - well floor space anyway - obviously not height.
ah the old times and if these guys whant to talk about pre-pc's lets see at my fathers ncr operated office 64 k of actice memory was the size of a desk and hardrives like washing mashines with individuall platter units stacked on a spindel that was dropped top loaded into the darn thing - 14&quot; mad tape reels ruled the world.
it all took about 1000 sq feet do do less than my hp-21 calculator (except for storrage)
