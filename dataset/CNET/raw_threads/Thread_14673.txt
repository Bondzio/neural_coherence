Zone Labs may tell you how to tweak it, but given I am not a Zone Alarm person (can't use it), I just eject it. Bob

As long as you have a firewall installed, I can't write if it really is &quot;down.&quot; The permission issue is noted at http://www.wown.com so I don't want to duplicate the content here. In short, it's all about ACCOUNTS. Many strain under having to create matching accounts and shares. Bob
