Hi everyone, I have(Maxtor F01G300 OneTouch III 300GB External Hard Drive USB 2.0/FireWire 400),the old series and I am using it with Sony Vaio laptop 1.8 Hz cpu with windows xp and 512 Mb Ram with Norton 360 antivirus 2008 version which is updated properly. Recently when I plug the external drive, after being recognized by the windows, as soon as i go into the directories after a couple of minutes i can not access to the data. It will come up with the message: it is not accessible and the the external drive would not respond anymore and I would get a message with exclamation mark near the time and date corner of the desktop indicating the same message. The time for this to happen varries between 15 seconds after connection to maximum 5 minutes. I am desperately asking for HELP!! Thanks to all of you guys.
