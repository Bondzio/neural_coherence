I am very concerned that it is about to die. After a little searching, I have read that even the replacements that Samsung sends out are junk. Any suggestions on a different HD of similar size/speed to replace it with?

Off the top of my head, there is Seagate, WD, Samsung, Hitatci and Maxtor. Seagate now owns Samsung a as well as Maxtor. Any other label out there maybe a &quot;rebadged&quot; HD is different from those listed. I have found Seagate to do well to include WD brands. I xclude any ext. mounted drives and any 2.5in. as well also anything SSD based. tada -----Willy :I
