I play a lot of online games so i am looking for a powerful build in a budget. My budget is around $1,300 - $1,500. I already have speakers but need a monitor. I have decided on the graphics card (geforce 8800gt for a little under $200) and processor (Q6600 for about $250). I am basically clueless as to the rest of the components like motherboard, RAM (although i want 4 GB), case, etc.

And is it better than the Q6600? The E6750 is $190 instead of the $250 for the Q6600 on newegg. I still need help with the rest of the components. Thanks
