For Father's day my son bought me a Laptop which I also want to connect to the internet along with my PC. I tried to connect my LT to the Internet using my LIINKSYS, but I just can't do it using my DSL Modem and my LINKSYS. Please explain to me in simple language how I can connect my LT to the Internet along with my PC? Thanks

Also are you testing the connection from the linksys with the same cable as with your PC? If you are using a separate cable you can check if that is okay, by substituting it with the cable you use for the PC.
