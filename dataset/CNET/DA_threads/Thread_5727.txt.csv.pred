1.1.1	I am trying to add a dell laptop to my home network consisting of 2 desktops connected to a 2wire 1000homeportal modem with wireless capabilities .	St
1.1.2	The new laptop had a built in network card .	St
1.1.3	The SBC CD only wants to set up for a 2wire product .	St
1.1.4	I am getting a great signal strength but limited or no connectivity .	St
1.1.5	When I check the ip address it is incorrect .	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	What can I do to get this to work ?	Ques
1.4.1	is done by opening a command prompt and using ipconfig/release and ipconfig/renew .	St
1.4.2	If your IP is now in line with the rest of your PCs , you should be good to go .	St
1.5.1	I did try this with no luck .	Polite
1.5.2	SBC and 2wire both could n't help me .	St
1.5.3	I was hoping someone else had this same problem and a solution .	St
1.6.1	The previous help you got with this was not correct .	St
1.6.2	The reason you got limited or no connectivity on your wireless connection , is simply mistyping your WEP key .	St
1.6.3	If you went to your prefered network list and disconnected from your current wireless connection , you could retype the 10 digit hexadecimal key located on your 2wire 1000sw .	St
1.6.4	I really hope you already found the answer to this a long time ago .	St
