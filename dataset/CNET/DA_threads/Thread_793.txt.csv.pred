1.1.1	I was working on this desktop for a friend, he had several virus' (which I removed).	St
1.1.2	He had a problem with an music maker app, when you run it, it says it cant find an avi file on the cdrom, but it's there.	St
1.1.3	I thought the virus was the cause, but apparently not as the same thing happened after I removed them.	St
1.1.4	The system then seemed to be unstable (couldn't create an xp restore point, it would hang up trying).	St
1.1.5	So I did a Compaq destructive restore and the system went back to normal operation.	St
1.1.6	My real question is why does this comp show 2 processors in device manager?	St
1.1.7	(Intel 2.8 hyperthreading processors).	St
1.1.8	This has to be a low end comp as it has onboard video & audio.	St
1.1.9	Also in device manager in the IDE controllers there are 2 ata controllers, 2 Primary ide channels & 2 Secondary ide channels listed.	St
1.1.10	My comp only has 1 each of the above???	St
1.1.11	I uninstalled 1 of the ata controllers & a primary & secondary Ide channel disappeared along with it.	St
1.1.12	However, when I rebooted, all of the above reappeared via the found new hardware thingy....	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Thanks Bob.	St
1.3.2	Is there any reason there are 2 primary & 2 secondary ide controllers listed (along with 2 ata controllers)??	St
1.3.3	Theres only 1 hard drive & 2 cdrom drives.	St

1.6.1	Drivers... http://www.asus.it/support/download/item.aspx?ModelName=P4SDX&Type=All P4SDX has too many models noted so I can't narrow it down.	St
1.6.2	I think you'll have to point out which exact model you have.	St
1.6.3	In closing, is there an issue that needs fixing?	St
