aaaagggggggttttt, wrong, i have tried all of that, uninstalled all that junk, and reboot and reboot and reinstall.
ive done every thing that the tech service told me to do.
the t5026 is junk.
if you luked out and got a good one, good for you.
but next time i will send the extra 3 or 4 hundred dollars and get something good.
