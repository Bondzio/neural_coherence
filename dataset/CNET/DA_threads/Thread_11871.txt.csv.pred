1.1.1	Hello!	St
1.1.2	I got a new case and swapped all the components over the other day and everything worked fine.	St
1.1.3	Then I went out, when i got back in and turned my computer on there was no power running to the keyboard or mouse and the monitor doesn't display anything ( although it knows something's there because it doesn't display the no signal dialogue box it would if there was nothing plugged in) .	St
1.1.4	My system build is as follows.	St
1.1.5	Mobo- Asus P6X58D-E Psu - Corsair CX 600 Processor -Intel core i7 System cooling - Corsair H50 hydro series Graphics card - Radeon HD 5770 RAM - 3 x 2 GB DDR3 sticks.	St
1.1.6	Then just a 2 tb hard drive, wireless card...etc.	St
1.1.7	I'm running windows 8 compatibility mode at the moment but I've had this for months with no problems.	St
1.1.8	Any help on this would be greatly appreciated, from what I've read It's down to either a short motherboard, graphics card issues, or Psu problems, although all fans and power indicating lights come on when i turn the system on, it just doesn't beep, then turns itself off after 30 or so seconds.	St
1.1.9	Any help would be greatly appreciated!	St
1.1.10	Literally tearing my hair out here ( and with dreads that's no small feat) Thanks!	St
1.2.1	from the case and try assembling them on a wooden or other non-conductive tabletop.	St
1.2.2	If you get the same result, something has likely failed.	St
1.2.3	If not, there is a good possibility that the MB is shorting against the case.	St
1.2.4	A common issue is some standoff post on the MB backing plate that has no corresponding mounting point on the motherboard.	St
1.2.5	These mounting posts often need to be moved or removed in order to line up with the holes in the MB.	St
