<s> The last week or so, our internet connection has been off and on. </s>
<s> The lights on the modem report no internet connection--then sometimes 10, sometimes 30 minutes later, all is well. </s>
<s> I don't know if this is Charter cable, or my modem. </s>
<s> We do not have tv, or a second hookup, so I can't just unplug the modem and then try another hookup. </s>
<s> The modem is 5 years old (Motorola Surfboard 5100). </s>
<s> Unfortunately, we have VOIP phone service so I can't call Charter when this is down. </s>
<s> I have called them before and I've always gotten the &quot;there's nothing wrong with our connection&quot; answer--again, when the internet connection is running, of course its working properly. </s>
<s> Is there any diagnostic I can run, to determine if the problem is an old modem or my ISP? </s>
<s> I can always get another modem and plug it in, then re-sell it on amazon if the new modem isn't any better off, but I'd lose 20-30 bucks in the exchange. </s>
<s> I'd like to try something else first. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> I learned this long ago. </s>
<s> Use their cable modem even if it's 1.50 a month. </s>
<s> Their unit is their problem and the unit my cableco works for over 8 hours after the power goes out. </s>

<s> if its too much trouble for even you... yeah Charter told me it would cost an extra 2 bucks/mo, and I've more than made up for the price of the modem ($80 or so IIRC) by avoiding that fee over the 5 years of service. </s>
<s> Of course I'm experiencing the drawbacks of my strategy now... Anyways, hopefully someone can come up with some magical way/software utility that can help me see if my modem is working right.. </s>
<s> I just got an idea--perhaps the issue is my modem overheating--that might explain why the outages are intermittent--and this is the end of July (live in desert region). </s>
<s> Is there any way to detect the temperature of my modem (apart from dunking it into a bucket of water then sticking a thermometer in the water)? </s>
<s> If in fact this is being caused by overheating, this problem would not be solved by getting a new modem--at least, not solved over the long run. </s>
<s> I have SIW (system information for windows), a nice utility that gives a ton of system information (even keys for MS products), but it didn't have this information. </s>
<s> I've had my modem in an enclosed space, standing right next to the back of the desktop unit, which would be providing a rather warm environment. </s>
<s> Anyways I'll put it in an open space tonight and then see if these problems continue over the next few days. </s>
<s> Here local thrift shops have used broadband modems of all kinds. </s>
<s> If your local area it should be also, depending on town/city. </s>
<s> Its worth the try. </s>
<s> Since, you mentioned thi is a 5yr. </s>
<s> old box, yeah maybe its suffering the effects of wear&tear, so a used modem is worth the swap, we're talking well under $10. </s>
<s> Also, a friend with a cell phone certainly would be a friend if borrowed to call during an outage. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> want to check for oxidiazation of the cable pins at both ends or else, the loose-ness of the fittings. </s>
<s> How old is the cable line itself? </s>
<s> How about the adapter point? </s>
<s> Is it still the same or has been upgraded by the provider? </s>
<s> If you have a spare cable lying around, you could try swapping it. </s>
<s> Its been a day and a half since I shifted the modem to a more ventilated place, and it hasn't gone offline yet. </s>
<s> I'll have to give it a few more days to be sure, but if this remains the case, I won't need to worry about any other troubleshooting. </s>
<s> After three full days of no outages (after moving it to a ventilated location), yesterday afternoon three times it went out briefly--about 10 minutes at a time. </s>
<s> I was just about thinking that this was taken care of.... OK I'll just see how this goes for another few days. </s>
<s> Like I said, I have little faith in Charter's tech support telling me anything but &quot;the line is clear from our end.&quot; That's all I've ever heard from them in the past, as well as AOL in the early years of internet.... </s>
<s> If I can live with a short spell of outages I'll just bite the bullet...if it gets too annoying I'll get a replacement model and see if that won't do the trick. </s>
