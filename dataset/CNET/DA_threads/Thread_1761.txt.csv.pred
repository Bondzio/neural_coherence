1.1.1	My onboard network interface card has n't been working for a while .	St
1.1.2	Its MAC address gets disabled in the BIOS menu .	St
1.1.3	When I enable it and restart the PC , the BIOS first shows an error message , which passes too fast to read , and then reboots with the MAC address disabled .	St
1.1.4	Also , when the pc shuts down , all the keyboard leds remain lit .	St
1.1.5	And if I turn on the PC when the leds are lit , the pc boots but does not respond to anything from the keyboard .	St
1.1.6	If I unplug the PC and plug it again and turn on the PC , the leds are off and the keyboard works fine .	St
1.1.7	Now , I am suspecting two things : Either the motherboard is dying or my cheap PSU ( 300W peak ) is causing issues .	St
1.1.8	http : //extreme.outervision.com/PSUEngine says for my system , the minimum PSU power is 282W and the recommended PSU power is 332W .	St
1.1.9	Can this be a PSU problem , or can it be something else ?	Ques
1.2.1	Pushing a power supply is bad luck .	Polite
1.2.2	And what they do n't tell you is that a 300W PEAK PSU will not do 300W for long .	St
1.2.3	Also as it ages ( just a year ) it loses capacity .	St
1.2.4	Is there any card or device like some hard drives or a second CD/DVD you can remove to lighten the load ?	Ques
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	The keyboard problem does n't occur if I use a usb keyboard instead of a ps/2 .	St
1.3.2	I removed the optical drives , floppy disk and PCI cards .	St
1.3.3	I left only the sata disk and PCIe video card .	St
1.3.4	The keyboard problem did n't occur then .	St
1.3.5	But the onboard nic problem did n't change .	St
1.3.6	The PSU is a 5 year old one that came with the Aopen case .	St
1.3.7	There does n't seem to be something physically wrong with the motherboard , at least visually .	St
1.3.8	I 'm going to look for a decent PSU and then see what happens .	St
1.4.1	At 5 years all electrolytic capacitors are suspect .	St
1.4.2	That 300W PSU is assured to not be able to put out that much .	St
1.4.3	And we are talking about a 5 year old PC so it would be proper to have to disable a balky onboard NIC and install some PCI card to stand in .	St
1.4.4	However you will encounter tech 's that will try anything to avoid that .	St
1.4.5	Go figure .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	I bought a 420W PSU and now the keyboard problem is gone .	St
1.5.2	The onboard NIC issue has n't changed .	St
1.5.3	And a day after I installed the new PSU a strange thing happened .	St
1.5.4	Out of blue , Windows stopped responding and the PC started making an incessant beeping sound .	St
1.5.5	So I shut it down using the power button .	St
1.5.6	The next time I turned the PC on the BIOS stopped loading at & quot ; initializing usb & quot ; ( I looked up the hexadecimal code on the motherboard led dispay ) .	St
1.5.7	This only stopped happening when I unplugged the printer from USB port .	St
1.5.8	Such a thing did not happen again .	St
1.5.9	I 'm using the printer just fine .	St
1.5.10	Everything seems to be normal .	St
1.5.11	I guess the problem is solved for now .	St
1.6.1	If you do n't use it , why fix it ?	Ques
1.6.2	But PCI NIC cards are really cheap .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
