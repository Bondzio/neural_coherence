while it happens less and less i ran into an isp that blocked vpn traffic.
but i find this doubtful in your case since you claim the vpn connects but you can't ping the other side.
-&gt; the lack to details is hampering me far too much.
i know that most won't tell all the needed information since they fear for the security of the connection (why else vpn?)
while i've run over the usual issues it appears we've reached the end with the clues supplied.
time to let the vpn gear maker to step in or return the equipment for one that will tell you it works.
