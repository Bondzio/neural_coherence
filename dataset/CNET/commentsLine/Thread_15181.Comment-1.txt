my wife and i both have win xp laptops.
for some reason, one day we both lost our wireless connection.
however, my wife's machine later was able to reconnect - mine wasn't.
my machine sees the wireless network, sends the key, and tries to acquire the ip from the router.
that's where it gets stuck.
the ip address never gets updated.
