1.6.6	Also , I want a dual-core processor .	St
1.6.7	Would it be smarter of me to just buy a desktop and make all the upgrades myself seeing how expensive Pentium D processors are ?	Ques
1.7.1	How come you are n't going for a SATA interface ?	Ques
1.7.2	I 'm surprised , as most people despise IDE , but there is n't anything wrong with IDE or Ultra-ATA IMO .	St
1.7.3	Also , I would note that people have had software problems with Windows Media Center and ATI All-In-Wonder cards .	St
1.7.4	I personally would just buy a TV tuner card and graphics card seperately .	St
1.7.5	Or maybe it 's just becuz I do n't like ATI , lol .	St
1.7.6	It is also possible to buy just the ATI card and XP Home .	St
1.7.7	Windows Media Center is ''over-hyped '' and has some issues like everything else from Microsoft lol .	St
1.7.8	With the ATI software you will have the same capabilities as Media Center .	St
1.7.9	Plus you will save $ $ $ .	St
1.7.10	Since you desire dual-core , with your socket 939 MOBO you can eventually upgrade to an AMD Athlon X2 cpu when the prices go down .	St
1.7.11	So building your PC with an AMD Athlon 64 3000+ socket 939 is a good idea .	St
1.7.12	It is a lower-end cpu and you do not need to spend $ $ $ on a 3500+ when your going to upgrade to dual-core .	St
1.7.13	Good RAM and PS supply choice	St
1.8.1	I 'm a newbie to this whole build-it-yourself computer stuff .	St
1.8.2	Just a quick question , what is a SATA and IDE interface ?	Ques
1.8.3	And what are the costs and benefits of a SATA vs. IDE ?	Ques
1.8.4	Thanks .	Polite
1.9.1	Are these even in the same category ?	Ques
1.9.2	If so , which is better ?	Ques
1.10.1	NIL	St
1.11.1	The nForce 4 Socket 939 MOBOS your looking at , all support a Serial-ATA or SATA interface .	St
1.11.2	That gives you the option of having a SATA Harddrive .	St
1.11.3	SATA refers to how the hardware communicates or is connected to your Motherboard .	St
1.11.4	SATA is supposed to be ''faster '' but its not really significantly .	St
1.11.5	For more info google Serial-ATA or read this article at Tom 's Hardware .	St
1.11.6	Serial-ATA harddrives are alittle more expensive than IDE drives .	St
1.11.7	The Western Digital Caviar SE 300GB 3.5 '' IDE Ultra ATA100 Hard Drive you picked out is an Ultra ATA or IDE drive .	St
1.11.8	So you could buy a SATA drive if you make that choice , but the one you picked out would work fine .	St
1.11.9	Your choice !	St
1.11.10	Also the SATA interface for CD and DVD drives is still IDE but you will find SATA is starting to emerge in some drives .	St
1.11.11	Plextor makes some , they are $ $ $ $ .	St
1.11.12	Hope that helps .	St
1.12.1	but if u getting aiw..great cuz i suggested it in my very 1st post the card is good for gaming and multimedia	St

1.13.2	It 's been very helpful .	St
1.13.3	Do you think I 'm getting the best bang for my buck ?	Ques
1.13.4	I 'm only looking to spend around $ 1500 on set up .	St

1.15.1	First of all , the MOBO you picked out comes with an AMD Athlon 64 3500+ .	St
1.15.2	If you plan on upgrading to dual-core in the future , spending the extra on the 3500+ would be a waste , buy the 3000+ .	St
1.15.3	Theres a very nice BFG board w/ a 3000+ for $ 278.99 .	St
1.15.4	If you want to buy a bundle .	St
1.15.5	The Tech Report Theres a good review on your TV tuner card , looks like you picked the right 1 , very nice .	St
1.15.6	''The eVGA NVTV , which also has low CPU utilization and great image quality , runs only $ 62 online and comes bundled with the NVDVD decoder , making it perfect for Media Center Edition and thus our Editor 's Choice ... '' You may also want to buy The Remote for MCE for $ 38.25 You could say money buy going with a smaller harddrive , lower wattage powersupply , or video card .	St
1.15.7	The ATI Radeon X850XL is a good pick .	Polite
1.15.8	Although , serious gamers will note that ATI 's cards lack some technologies found in nVidia 's stuff , it 's your choice .	St
1.15.9	Check out Tom 's Hardware Graphics Benchmarks for comparisons .	St
1.15.10	Other little things , you may also want a Ethernet card ( $ 20 bucks ) for dsl/cable internet or a 56k modem for dial-up .	St
1.15.11	If you want to keep your PC cool buy some extra fans and a CPU cooling fan .	St
1.15.12	You could also get some Neon lights in there lol .	Sug
1.15.13	Media-card reader ?	Ques
1.15.14	Overall , you have a nice computer here .	St
1.15.15	Good job .	St
1.15.16	Have fun putting it together .	St
1.16.1	some raid makes access faster while other config .	St
1.16.2	is mostly for redundancy	St
1.17.1	I 've never built a computer together from the ground up , but it seems pretty straight forward after doing some research .	St
1.17.2	In actuality , is it pretty difficult ?	Ques
1.17.3	Thanks .	Polite

1.19.1	Look at the Coolermaster .	St
1.19.2	I used one last month , and the tooless design and front ports work well .	St

1.20.1	My first build was kind of scary .	St
1.20.2	Whatta Ride !	St
1.20.3	I ended up with some issues that took awhile to figure out .	St
1.20.4	I had a lot of fun getting my TV tuner , firewire card , 3D glasses , and RAID configured .	St
1.20.5	I now know the biggest problem was Windows 98 .	St
1.20.6	XP makes all those things easier .	St
1.20.7	Just remember you can always wipe and reinstall 'til you get it right .	St
1.20.8	It just takes time and patience .	St
1.20.9	Get in a hurry , you 're doomed .	St
1.20.10	On another note , I keep seeing Tiger Direct as a recommendation .	St
1.20.11	Stick with Newegg , you do n't want the hassles .	St
1.20.12	Newegg , Zip Zoom Fly , and a new Chief Value will cover your needs with fast service and great prices .	St
1.20.13	They do n't rely on rebate lies for profit .	St
1.21.1	IF you 're doing it from scatch its a heck of a lot easier than rebuilding .	St
1.21.2	Make sure to get a cabinet type that will fit the mother board type such as an XT type , micro ATX or AT ... It was a good thing I had the motherboard book , told me what type and size , I felt I was restricted to that , but the Computer cabinet I have could have taken the largest mobo without a problem - even the different mountings were marked for both mobo types ! , but to me this was the key issue - to be able to drop in a motherboard replacement ( 4 studs and 3 re-uasable plastic support tabs ) -that done I was up and running after processor with heatsink and fan , and RAM installation , ... ... NEWEGG is positively great , delivery always on the money thru Fed-Ex , wait for the month end sales - very good deals , you can also read reviews on each product , most customers write about other components they matched stuff up with and how those work , this will give you plenty of ideas of what to buy and what will work together as soon as you plug it in .	St
1.21.3	Beware , some components do not work well together in many cases that have been documented , there have been motherboard chipset issues with Hard Disk drives and bios setups that you can read about on websites such as techreport.com/reviews and techspot.com as well as informit .	St
1.22.1	Look forget Tiger Direct , for the best service stick with Newegg , Zip zoomfly and chief value .	St
1.22.2	Do the research by reading reviews on the components .	St
1.22.3	Excellent processor choice with the Asus mobo , What ?	Ques
1.22.4	LightScribe DVD Burner , who cares , you wait half hour for an image and HP drives are crap , get this Liteon drive http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16827106967 Get off the tiger direct kick unless you just like poor service and paying more for it .	St
1.22.5	Why not get your video card from newegg , http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16814130203 you save $ 8 from tiger direct after mail in rebate and shipping , is it worth the hassle ?	Ques

1.23.3	Have fun , john http : //www.build-your-own-computer-tips.com/index.html	St

1.25.5	If you already have your own burning software then get Neweggs NEC DVD burner for $ 45 ( or less ) .	St
1.25.6	It 's a bargin !	St
1.25.7	BTW the MB comes with Norton Anti-Virus packaged in it .	St
1.25.8	The ATI RADEON X800XL is capable of displaying true HD and comes with HD Cable and is compatible with ATI 's Crossfire ( ATI 's version of SLI ( Serial Link Interface ) ) .	St
1.25.9	The ATI HD All in Wonder allows S-Video/Cable and Antenna Input and acts as a PVR ( TIVO without a charge ! )	St
1.25.10	With this MB you need 2 sticks of RAM PC3200 to make it work right ( I chose 2 GB Kingston 1GB / Stick ) The ANTEC Case comes with a 550 12V ATX Power Supply ( has 24 pins to power PCI Express on Mother Board and it is Required ) .	St
1.25.11	This is a Gaming machine , Audio/Video machine and Server ( the MotherBoard has 2 Gb LANs ) !	St
1.25.12	New egg is the place to go !	St
1.26.1	I know a guy who can build this system for half the price .	St
1.26.2	I guess that 's the price you have to pay for making yourself feel so macho man .	St
1.27.1	Hi Guys , I just finished a computer similar to the parts you suggest .	St
1.27.2	I agree with the components , but , your estimated prices are a little high .	St
1.27.3	I completed mine for under $ 700.00 .	St
1.27.4	Your much better off buying a case with the power supply you want included .	St
1.27.5	My case and a 485 watt power supply at Tiger Direct cost $ 49.95 .	St
1.27.6	Also , it had a 100 % rebate .	St
1.27.7	I know that that is not always available .	St
1.27.8	I 've found from experience that Tiger Direct and New Egg are about the best sources on line .	St
1.27.9	Tiger seems to have the best sales .	St
1.27.10	Also , Computer Geeks are pretty good .	St
1.27.11	You know the old saying : It pays to shop a round .	St
1.27.12	Goodluck with your build .	St

1.27.14	Jack ( bad penny )	Polite

1.28.2	For price and grins , I added Tekram 315U card for $ 20 ( 21.99 at zipzoom now ) 2 50 to 68 pin converters $ 5 2 IBM DDYS-T18350 18.3GB Ultra3 Wide 68P 10K $ 240 NOTE : shop prices any 68 pin wide SCSI 3 by vendors well documented will do PRICES VARY GREATLY .	St

1.29.3	It just started beating itself to death from the inside .	St
1.29.4	Since it was only about 1 1/2 years old they replaced it with a remanufactured unit .	St
1.29.5	They certainly could n't do anything about the 80 gigs of files I lost .	St
1.29.6	I did n't do much backup thinking everything was fine , now I 'll suffer for quite awhile .	St
1.29.7	I 'm still in shock at all I 've lost .	St
1.29.8	Now I just replaced a bad motherboard in a Presario 6000 to find the Maxtor HD is also trash .	St
1.29.9	So far I 've seen 2 out of 5 Maxtors go bad .	St

1.29.13	Do n't be a trusting idiot like me .	St
1.30.1	NewEgg.com is my fav , and online shopping is the greatest .	St
1.30.2	However , many brick-and-mortar stores have REBATES that beat anything that online retailers can offer .	St
1.30.3	Many times you can get a rebate on a retail version of a component cheaper than the OEM version offered online .	St
1.30.4	Check online at places like CompUSA , Circuit City , Staples , etc .	St
1.30.5	They usually update their offers every Sunday .	St
1.30.6	You may not get the great rebate offer on the part when you want it , but you can save BIGTIME on a part or two .	St
1.30.7	Only drawback is that you have to wait a few weeks for your savings to come in .	St
1.30.8	Also , do n't forget comparison shopping sites like PriceGrabber.com .	St

1.34.3	I know more than the average bear about software but when it comes to hardware I am quite intimidated .	St
1.34.4	I can not afford to have someone else do this for me and I do n't have anyone close who knows enough to help me with this daunting project .	St
