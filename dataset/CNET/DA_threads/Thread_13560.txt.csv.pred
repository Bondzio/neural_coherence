1.1.2	I'm thinking of getting a 32&quot; or 37&quot; HDTV to be use as my PC monitor.	St
1.1.3	My PC have 3.0Ghz AMD Duo processor and an NVIDIA GeForce 9800GT 512Mb graphics card installed.	St
1.1.4	However, I don't know if my card is able to display videos with good resolution in such a huge monitor especially if I watch Blue-ray movies and play games in it.	St
1.1.5	Does anybody have an idea?	Ques
1.1.6	It would be great if you share it to me.	Polite
1.1.7	I appreciate any suggestions and recommendations.	Polite
1.2.1	But to play BLU RAY may require a BluRay player such as http://www.cyberlink.com/multi/products/main_1_ENU.html Some forget that there is no free BR software yet.	St
