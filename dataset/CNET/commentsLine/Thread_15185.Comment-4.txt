since my hint was not strong enough, then let me repeat that the supplier's warranty notice was the proper response to those who will not fit a new proper sized heatsink with a new fan.
how else will they make this issue known?
i strongly suggest not to do this.
unless you double the clock rate, the effect is usually lost since the rest of the machine is the same old speed and you may not feel any gain at all.
but it's a cheap upgrade if it works.
it would be amazing to see hp/compaq support this endeavor.
as to the power supply watts.
the system will only draw what it needs, but as a power ages, it's spare capacity dwindles.
effects of an overtaxed power supply are random booting, unannounced reboots, lockups and such.
since garden variety 450 watt power supplies are under 20 dollars, i fit nothing less than this size.
