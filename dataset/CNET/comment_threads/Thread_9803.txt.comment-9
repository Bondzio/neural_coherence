I was thinking about what could be wrong, and I was looking through my BIOS settings and went to the power tab.
It said something about saving power, so I changed that.
It was ACPI suspend state, I changed it from S1 state to S3 state.
I'm not sure exactly what it does, but it seemed to make my computer shut down after a longer time.
This might just be my imagination and it is completely unrelated, but if someone could give an explanation, that'd be great.
I'd much rather buy a new power supply than a new CPU, so I'm hoping it's the power supply at this point.
