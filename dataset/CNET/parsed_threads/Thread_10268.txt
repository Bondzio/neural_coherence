<s> Helping a buddy set up a wireless network with Linksys Wireless-G. </s>
<s> I couldn't get it working properly! </s>
<s> Here's the setup (all PCs running XP Pro + SP1 + all Updates): Base Station (Located in Basement just below stairs): Cable Modem &gt; Linksys WRT54G Router &gt; Gateway Desktop (wired). </s>
<s> Works as normal. </s>
<s> First set up ~ WiFi Gateway PC (Located on first level approx. </s>
<s> 16'0&quot;): Linksys WRT54G &gt; second Gateway Desktop fitted with a Linksys WMP54G Wireless-G PCI Adapter. </s>
<s> This PC can connect but would disconnect after a few minutes and have to reconnect each time. </s>
<s> This issue cannot be resolved so far. </s>
<s> Have tried changing different channels still it disconnects after a few minutes on line. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Second set up ~ WiFi PC (Located on second level approx 36'0&quot; away from Linksys Router): On clicking connect it shows the signal strength to be below average but the PC cannot connect to the Internet. </s>
<s> Third set up ~ Toshiba Satellite Centrino with built-in WiFi 802.11b. </s>
<s> It shows the Linksys Router with a red &quot;x&quot; and cannot connect at all. </s>
<s> Tried installing a Linksys Wireless-G PCMCIA card and it shows that there is an excellent signal strength but would not connect to the Internet! </s>
<s> Any thought on where things have gone wrong? </s>
<s> Could the fact that the Linksys Router being located in the basement be the problem? </s>
<s> But then it shows that the signal strength to the first Desktop to be strong and this connects but loose connection every few minutes. </s>
<s> Have called Linksys Tech Support and was told to try different channels till one works. </s>
<s> But no joy. </s>
<s> Also note that WEP is enabled. </s>
<s> Any suggestions on how to get this set up working would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Latest firmware all around. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> From the fab http://www.usbman.com I agree that it could be a power management issue. </s>
<s> Yes, this is not USB, but ... Bob </s>
<s> I might move the router upstairs and run a CAT5 line down to the basement to see if that improves the signal. </s>
<s> I have a client with a similar setup and the router move upstairs solved the connection issue. </s>
<s> It seems even the G standard is limited by environmental factors. </s>
<s> Latest Firmware was the first thing I applied when it could not connect. </s>
<s> Moving router was not a preferred alternative. </s>
<s> He thinks that Linksys should have a proper working product a non- fully functioning product. </s>
<s> I have a 802.11b Linksys in my basement at home and my WiFi Laptop can connect even when I am in my bedroom on the second floor. </s>
<s> Though the signal is around 20~30% the connection never disconnects! </s>
<s> What is not told to everyone is that no rigourous testing is performed on every card or device in order to cut production costs. </s>
<s> Every once in awhile you'll find a bad card or device in the field. </s>
<s> On your part you will try the networking within a few feet to make sure that the parts are dead and then begin the exchange process. </s>
<s> The testing of the product may work OK in the factory, but that was many months ago some thousands of miles away. </s>
<s> This isn't an excuse for a defect, but it shows up as stories we read here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I seem to recall reading somewhere that &quot;G&quot; has high data transfer but short range. </s>
<s> Could this be the problem? </s>
<s> Linksys' Tech said there could also be interference from Microwave & cordless phones. </s>
<s> But the cordless phone is in a different location and the microwave is also quite a distance away. </s>
<s> If such is the case then this product is not ready for the market? </s>
<s> I have recommended that he return the product to the store! </s>
<s> &quot;I seem to recall reading somewhere that &quot;G&quot; has high data transfer but short range. </s>
<s> Could this be the problem?&quot; I'll write no. </s>
<s> The distance I'm seeing is the same. </s>
<s> But one situation is unlike another, but 20 feet even with a floor is usually OK unless it's some concrete floor which can have a metal layer in it. </s>
<s> &quot;Linksys' Tech said there could also be interference from Microwave & cordless phones. </s>
<s> But the cordless phone is in a different location and the microwave is also quite a distance away. </s>
<s> If such is the case then this product is not ready for the market?&quot; Again, I'll write no. </s>
<s> Far too many success stories and if the situation was this dire, retailers would have already removed the products from the shelves. </s>
<s> Did you notice how short those tablet PC's showed up? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I recommend returning it as well. </s>
<s> I've got the Linksys G setup in an almost impossible house to try and get a wireless system to work. </s>
<s> &quot;G&quot; has high data transfer AND long range. </s>
<s> I think I was lucky. </s>
<s> I bought a Linksys G router and wireless notebook card and it worked flawlessly out of the box. </s>
<s> However, I suggested a friend try it. </s>
<s> He needed to return it. </s>
<s> Also be advised the Linksys customer service help is inept. </s>
<s> I had to call three times to get an answer on possibly upgrading the router. </s>
