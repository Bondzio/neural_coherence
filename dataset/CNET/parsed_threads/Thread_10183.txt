<s> I just got an 80GB Hitachi external hard drive in an Ultra enclosure, and I can't seem to access it with Win XP using firewire. </s>
<s> My Inspiron 8200 laptop is a few years old, so no USB 2.0. </s>
<s> Instead, I use a PC card with firewire ports to connect to the HD. </s>
<s> The computer recognizes the device and it pops up as a drive in the device manager, but it doesn't display an accessible icon in My Computer. </s>
<s> Does someone know a way that I can get into this thing? </s>
<s> Thanks, Bryant </s>
<s> WHILE its in the firewire case? </s>
<s> And using XP's Drive or Disk Management tool? </s>

<s> Haven't partitioned or formatted it, but I was under the impression that had been done, as it was labeled &quot;plug & play.&quot; I'm not familiar with XP's disk management tool; I will have to look for that. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> NO SUPPLIER CAN GUESS what partitions or file system you want. </s>

<s> I have exactly the same problem with a Maxtor 250 Gb HD in an ICY BOX enclosure, XP, firewire-access and motherboard doesn't support USB2 either. </s>
<s> The disc is still an active disc in my system managment and disc managment but I had no access to it. </s>
<s> But NTSF/FAT32 isn't recognised ... A quick format solves the problem temporary. </s>
<s> But the problem will occur again soon. </s>
<s> I guess the problem is on a driver-level or BIOS-level, recognising the disc. </s>
<s> If you find a solution u can mail me .. christianblock01@yahoo.com. </s>
