i just placed an order with dell for a studio xps system with core i7 processor, and now i am having second thoughts about my choice for memory.
i went with 6gb option which was the lowest offered and is 6 sticks.
it seems sufficient as currently i am running a single core processor with 4gb of memory.
they offer upgrades to 8gb and 12 gb.
the 12gb upgrade costs $300, and replaces the 6 1bg sticks with 2gb sticks.
since later expansion will require replacing sticks in the future if, how likely is it that i will need that much memory in the next 3 or so years?
i realize that this is a bit of speculation which depends on my usage and what happens in the future applications.
i use my system for drafting, rendering, photo work, and a very small amount of home video editing.
so, basically, if you are not into gaming, is 6gb a good choice, or will it choke the capability of my machine?
i would appreciate you comments and suggestions.
thanks, allen ps this is my first post.
i expect this is a frequent question, and i do not mean to be repetitive.
if there is a relevant thread, perhaps you could point me to it.
thanks again.
