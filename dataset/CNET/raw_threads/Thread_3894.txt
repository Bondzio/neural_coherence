I run AVG and ad aware scans regularly but it gets no better. I think it's time to do what i've heard others do which is a system rebuild? I just want to be sure that i wont screw it up so i would be really grateful if someone could give me a basic guide to rebuilding the software on my computer (drivers and OS etc.) Message was edited by: admin for language

A CD/DVD drive? What type of &quot;Recovery Discs&quot; do you have? (If it's a brand name computer, many have &quot;recovery partitions&quot; or 'Recovery Discs&quot; that contain the operating system and all software which will take the computer back to &quot;factory condition&quot;..) Do you have the operating system information and nothing more? The more information you give us, the better informed our answer will be. Hope this helps. Grif
