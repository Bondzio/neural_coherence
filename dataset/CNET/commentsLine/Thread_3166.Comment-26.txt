like all mechanical devices, the more you use them the shorter the life expectancy.
i have also found that by not shutting down my office computer , it continues to function flawlessly for years past those around me that turn their computers off nightly.
go figure.
i have external hard drives , and internal for that fact, that have surpassed their 50,000-100,000 hours mtbf (mean time before failure), yet others complain that their hard drives failed after a week.
some manufacturers warrant their drives for 3 years and others give you 5 years, most people upgrade their computes,drives and all every 6 month to a year, as size increase and price drops.
i have a 200 mb hard drive from the eighties that cost the govt.
$400 , i have flash cards with 2000 mb and they cost $8 now, so i would say that my 200 mb drive is a trash bin item even though it still works !
well you must get my point by now, most drives last longer than they are needed.
