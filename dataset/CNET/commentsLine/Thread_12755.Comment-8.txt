i understand that, what you want to do is like a dial up connection, where you can use one phone line to connect to different isp... right?
but even dial-up.. you can only call one isp at a time... -- you need different phone line to call your other isp at the same time -- now, have you try to connect your device to that line?
does it works and connected to your isp?
my guess is.. even if it is working.. you will be connected to your wife isp... not your isp.
