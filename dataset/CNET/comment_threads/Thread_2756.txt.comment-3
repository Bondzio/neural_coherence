I was wondering if the 4490 office will scan photo paper at 4800 dpi because I need to scan 7,000 photos or more.
If anyone also may know of a high resolution scanner w/ automatic document feeder and can give me any input at all.
I really need to know this information to get started.
Any help would be much appreciated
