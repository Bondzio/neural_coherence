you would use the &quot;line out&quot; connection.
as mentioned, you will need one that splits the signal into the two channels.
radio shack probably has such.
however, you will have some problems if the cable is of much length.
the longer it needs to run, the more likely it will pick up noise and especially 60 cycle hum.
impedance match is important so check to be sure your line out and auxillary ports match in this category.
get high quality (cost more) cables if you go further than 6 to 10 feet.
