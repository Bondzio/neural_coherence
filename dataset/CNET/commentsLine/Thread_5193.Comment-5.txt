the position of the atx power connector is pretty much in the same place as any other motherboard; the fact that this motherboard is a micro-atx form factor, is what's causing the problems with the video card install.
if the motherboard was a standard atx form factor, we wouldn't be having this problem...solution, might have to settle for a smaller (shorter) video card (for example: radeon hd 5670 1gb gddr5 pci express x16, comes in at around 7 inches long) to fit into the 9.6 inch x 9.6 inch motherboard.
