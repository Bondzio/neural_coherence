thanks for the reply.
i'm just looking for an internet and email pc and would probably add microsoft office.
there would be no need for video upgrades.
it looks like the pc does have spare card slots but i see that they are a smaller form factor.
would those be half height pci express slots?
my concern is reliability, as i believe i read that some of the earlier hp slimline pcs had motherboard failures and possibly overheating problems.
it appears that acer, lenovo, and perhaps others have joined hp in offering the slimline pcs, so i am wondering if some brands might be more reliable than others.
