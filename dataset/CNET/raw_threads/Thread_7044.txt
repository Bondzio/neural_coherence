Does anyone know how to replace the DVD-Drive in the original XBOX with a PC DVD-Drive, because the XBOX DVD-Drive is only 5X, which results in slow loading times for me. I want something like a 16X drive so I don't have to wait that long.... Also, does anyone know if I can also replace the internal XBOX hard drive with a PC hard drive, cause I want to rip some games onto the hard drive..... If anyone can give me a feedback, I'll deeply appreciate it.....
