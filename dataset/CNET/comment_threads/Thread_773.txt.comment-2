&quot;What I was wondering was, can I leave the 7-7-7-20 settings and up the voltage to 1.7V with no issues?&quot; http://www.corsair.com/products/xms3.aspx shows that's beyond it's spec so I'll write you should run it at the specified and supported settings.
If you are OVERCLOCKING then you are off the reservation and no one can tell you will be fine.
