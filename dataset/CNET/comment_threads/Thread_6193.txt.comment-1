We just upgraded from our old Belkin G-class router to a new Cisco Linksys E4200 router.
It's a very fast router, but whenever I try to use UPnP to stream an HD video (and by HD I mean real HD - think a Blu-Ray in its full 30-40 Mbps glory) from my Windows Media Player library on my PC to my Google TV, it pauses to buffer more than I would like.
Can I correct this, or am I simply biting off more than I can chew with the whole &quot;Blu-Ray HD&quot; thing?
Also, is there any way I can use UPnP WITHOUT having to have the videos I want to stream in my WMP library?
Windows Media Player has always been a pain for me, from my videos not showing up in the library when I know they're there to not being able to switch audio streams in a video.
(If VLC Media Player or iTunes had a UPnP library, I would be happy... )
