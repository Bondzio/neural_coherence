I have gotten the program to appear on the screen but when I push say,+ part one fractions or any of the commands, table of contents..nothing I have installed or tried to upgrade my QuickTime like it instructed but I get an error.500 I changed my default once to try IE and when that didn't work I change the default to Foxfire. I went and downloaded DirectX Sample browser to tell you the truth I don't know what prompted me to do that, should I uninstall? I click on computer and right click the DVD Introductory and still no results and I don't know what else to do. This all for trying to prep for getting into college, scary huh? I'd give anything to be knowledgable on the computer. Please help me

It appears the CDs are from a place that offers zero support. As it appears that no support is from the CD's supplier why not take those CDs and machine to some repair counter if your PC guru friends can't fix it? Bob

We don't know what's on the CD-ROM (or is it a DVD?) 2. We don't know the system requirements for the program. 3. In fact, we don't even know what program it requires. 4. We don't have the user manual nor the help files nor the instruction that came with the CD's So we can't help in any way. It has been suggested you contact the college that gave you these CD's for help. That's the best advice possible, I think. Kees
