I am planning on opening an Internet Cafe and I have planned to do the networking as shown in the image. Please be kind enough to help me on what sort of Server I have to build (including Hardware specs.) and how to do the networking. Thank s in advance. Please find my sketch in the following link. http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hU48MNkF9z0/T9KJhb6ixPI/AAAAAAAAAfM/xKmgp9GJQCg/s960/Net+Cafe+Setup.png

9898	2	565151	5320931	5320798	yazirarafath	6/9/12 12:32 PM	1.33924512E12	Of course, I am new to the business. :)	By the way, I wanna provide an excellent and Hi-tech service to my customers. So, I selected this way rather than putting cheap stuffs. Talk about the project, not about the cost. Thank you.

It's no longer done for many reasons including the fact the cost is more than a PC at each station. Write back when you are ready. Bob
9898	4	565151	5320988	5320926	yazirarafath	6/9/12 3:50 PM	1.339257E12	I am ready	I agree with you that building a server is more expensive than setting up individual PCs. But, I wanna do it in this way. So, please help me.

That is, once in awhile you get the new person that thinks you can hang display, keyboard and mouse on some server and make it all work. They usually get upset there is nothing less than 2 times the cost of a PC. So here's the company and the products. http://www.citrix.com/English/partners/programs/fourthLevel.asp?programID=1681660&tlID=163199&flID=1859519 So there you go. Citrix on the server and HDX thin clients. Done. I wonder still if you were so new you expected no client hardware. Bob

9898	7	565151	5321040	5320997	yazirarafath	6/9/12 8:04 PM	1.33927224E12	That was a geek to me	OMG! I didn't expect such a setup. It is easy and economical for me to setup individual PCs rather than setting up Thin Clients and stuffs. I thought I could build a big size CPU with some extra VGA outputs and USB ports for my project. So, I am going to set up some vertical Desktop CPUs, so that I can make a compact setup. Anyhow, thank you for your kind information.

Since it was not made in the volumes of your common PC or laptop the prices were always more than your PC. But folk always tried such things. Today I rarely seen a Citrix or Windows Terminal system because the PC is too cheap. Bob

Also, we do computer hardware and software troubleshooting, mobile phone repairing and upgrading, Photoshop and other typesetting deals and so on. I have no idea to sell coffee and treats as you suggest.

In the USA it's pretty much just reset the phone and if it has a bad screen or jack you swap out a new phone. The days of repairing a phone are long gone. I'm guessing this is not in the USA. No one I know would attempt what you wrote here. For many reasons. Bob
