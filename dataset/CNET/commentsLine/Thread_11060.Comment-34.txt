personally, i lost my printer and scanner, and vista thought that i ought to buy a new video camera as well.
a lot of my customers also had to replace equipment.
i don't mind so much the old stuff, but some of the things that i had to replace were still new, or even pruchased after vista came out.
i think that retailers should have to make it clear that an item won't work with a current os, or that i only works with the 32-bit version of the os that is listed on the box.
