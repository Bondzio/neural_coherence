Well, I agree that NewEgg has pretty good deals, but I would avoid ChiefValue!
I ordered a monitor from them last month and received an email receipt for a much higher price than what was advertised.
I told them to either cancel the order or charge the advertised price.
They told me that they could change their prices whenever they want, and they ignored my request to cancel the order.
Since then they've somehow disappeared and not responded to any of my emails.
