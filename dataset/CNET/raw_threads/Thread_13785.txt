I want to move some files/photos from an old computer that is no longer connected to the internet without having to download the drivers from a manufacturer's website ( obviously, since it isn't connected to the internet ). I will be moving the files/photos to Win XP. Any recommendations?

You'll have to carry the driver either on CD or floppy so 98 (any version?) can see the stick. Here's an idea. See if DAMN SMALL LINUX can be on a FAT formatted USB memory stick. Then boot from said stick and copy the files out. Bob
