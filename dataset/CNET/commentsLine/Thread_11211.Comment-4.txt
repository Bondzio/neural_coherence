i say that tongue only partly in cheek - it's the easy way out but very hard way back in.
you could do a hard reset of the router (read the documentation to find where the reset pin is and whether you need to hold it in for x seconds or do a simultaneous power on while dancing nude in the front yard or what...) and that will reset the router to factory defaults - including wiping out all the current security settings.
now you just set all new passwords - and write them down in your documentation rather than leaving them solely in your tech's head.
if you want to experiment a bit before doing a complete reset, you might try logging into the router's configuration menu using the manufacturer's default configuration password in the hopes that your tech left the main configuration password as it was and only configured the wep password to something now unknown.
if you can get into the main configuration page (working from a computer that is wired to the router, not from a wireless system...), just set a new wep passphrase to whatever you like.
you will now have to reset that new wep key into your laptop so it can connect again, but you will now know what to set your son's powerbook to.
to learn the factory default login to the configuration page, read the documentation or go to the website of the manufacturer and download a copy of it from their support page.
