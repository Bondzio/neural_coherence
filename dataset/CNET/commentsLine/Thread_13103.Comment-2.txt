it's like telling me i can't use a mac at a wifi hotspot.
your wifi router is the same technology as what your hotspot uses.
-&gt; there are issues with some oses as you go past 5 machines.
xp has connection limits so a shared printer or files will only allow the first 5 machines.
read  which notes the xp pro and windows 2000 (professional) limit.
no need to create 2 networks.
show them your working network later.
