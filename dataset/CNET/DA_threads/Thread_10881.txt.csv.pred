1.1.1	Hello everybody , I have a rather awkward problem most of the times I try to watch a movie in my PC .	St
1.1.2	The moment I insert the dvd disk in and starts to read then all of a sudden the pc automatically restarts .	St
1.1.3	I have a Pentium 4 in 3.0 GHz with Windows XP home , 512 MB Ram , 80GB Hard drive , LiteOn dvd-RW , and a VGA 128MB PCI-express .	St
1.1.4	The problem doesnt appear in all dvd movies but in the majority of those .	St
1.1.5	With common dvd ( software content ) and CDs there is no problem at all .	St
1.1.6	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	It turned out to be the sound driver .	St
1.2.2	This one had driven many tech insane as all CDs worked as well as MP3s and many DVDs .	St
1.2.3	I will NOT dive into the gritty details but the theory is the DVD used the 5.1 stereo portion of the audio driver and that is where I guess the flaw was .	St
1.2.4	Finding the latest driver was not easy since it was some OEM motherboard by Fujitsu-Siemans .	St
1.2.5	But a little sleuthing and we found it .	St
1.2.6	Your issue sounds oh so familiar .	St
1.2.7	Bob PS .	St
1.2.8	And yes , the Microsoft Update Driver button announced it had the latest drivers .	St
1.2.9	I wonder if they 'll ever fix that .	St
1.3.1	if your Processor isnt getting enough power from your Power Supply Unit then your system will reboot itself under the strain .	St
1.3.2	P4 3.0Ghz CPUs draw quite a lot of power so if you continue to have this problem later in life then I would look at upgrading your PSU ... ... ..	St
