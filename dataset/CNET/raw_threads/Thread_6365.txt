I installed my new DVD drive and had some initial troubles with it. I wanted to see if it would be an all-around useful recording drive. It records to DVD+RW just fine. I don't have a big enough file to test the dual layer functionality. My Lite-On DVD recorder has yet to come across a media it doesn't like. But, of course, it isn't a dual layer unit.
