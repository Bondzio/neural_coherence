<s> My floppy drive is extremely slow. </s>
<s> It takes &quot;forever&quot; reading a floppy disk. </s>
<s> I've tried several different NEW floppies and it's definitely the drive itself. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> a &lt; $10 item. </s>
<s> I wouldn't even think about trying to troubleshoot a floppy drive. </s>
<s> Replace it. </s>
<s> Was scanning that diskette. </s>
<s> Since diskettes are slow already a programming gaffe (never!) </s>
<s> in Norton caused diskettes to run at less than 1/2 the speed. </s>
<s> May happen to other AV software too. </s>

<s> Today's machines. </s>
<s> Even if it was only 360KB and you multiple up the to by 4 to the 1.44MB today's machines are slower at formatting. </s>
<s> This must be an unloved, neglected area. </s>
<s> -&gt; But I did cure it. </s>
<s> I picked up a 2X Sony USB floppy drive. </s>

<s> I'm trying to load a program I got off the internet with my Windows XP desktop into my Windows 95 laptop using a floppy. </s>
<s> Seems like it can't be done because it always says to reformat the floppy. </s>
<s> Guess they're completely incompatible with each other? </s>
<s> What I'm trying to do is recover old photos off of my laptop that I accidentally deleted. </s>
<s> Then I'll throw it away. </s>
<s> I'll skip to what I used to get around it. </s>
<s> -&gt; I formatted the diskette in XP. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Doesn't work. </s>
<s> I formatted in XP, then loaded a file onto the floppy. </s>
<s> Then tried it in my Win 95 laptop and it wanted to format the disc again. </s>
<s> When I clicked NO then no file was shown on that drive. </s>
<s> The reason for the incompatibility was traced down to a virus on the 95 boxes. </s>
<s> But many forget this stuff. </s>
<s> -&gt; The other workaround. </s>
<s> Go to bootdisk.com and get the DOS boot diskette. </s>
<s> Create it on the XP box, boot that diskette and copy files to said diskette. </s>
<s> Done. </s>
<s> The only issue I could see here is if the owner wasn't from 1995. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I followed everything up until Booting the diskette,... </s>
<s> I copied the files to a floppy off of my desktop - XP. </s>
<s> Then I rebooted the desktop and it went to drive A:. </s>
<s> From there I have no idea what to do. </s>
<s> This means you didn't read the instructions. </s>
<s> Sorry but you may have to reveal if you are from 1995 where we used the command line, DOS commands and such. </s>
<s> Given you are asking about Windows 95 I pegged you as the usual user from that time period. </s>
<s> I tried to gracefully note that today's users may be a bit lost but maybe I was too subtle. </s>
<s> I also don't provide step by steps when the web sites supply that. </s>
<s> -&gt; Now run the file that you get from bootdisk.com and it will format the diskette and make the boot disk proper. </s>
<s> Good luck, Bob </s>
<s> I did as the instructions said as such: 1. </s>
<s> Most of the files above are disk images. </s>
<s> Download the file to your C: drive, put a fresh disk in your A: drive, then click on the file to create the bootdisk. </s>
<s> From there I'm stuck. </s>
<s> May be obvious to you but it isn't to me. </s>
<s> 95 is when I got the laptop. </s>
<s> I am mildly used to working in DOS as I haven't bothered with it in eons. </s>
<s> But some of the commands I'm familiar with. </s>
<s> It appears you copied the file to the diskette which isn't what I read for the instruction. </s>
<s> Sorry but you may want to brush up on the DOS COPY command since it's coming up next. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> said I copied the file to the disc but didn't. </s>
<s> I downloaded the Boot6.22 program to the desktop and ran it. </s>
<s> Then it said put a clean disc in the A drive, which I did. </s>
<s> Then it copied all these files to the disc. </s>
<s> I can only go by what you tell me. </s>
<s> Now all you need to do is boot that diskette. </s>
<s> Again, working with the usual 95 owner they'll know how to do that. </s>
<s> Or if they forget they'll look in the BIOS and set the floppy as the boot device. </s>
