He took my hard drive out and exchanged it for another which worked fine. Now it looks like I either need a new computer or a new hard drive. I don't really want a new computer; I love this one. But my friend says that if I get a new hard drive I will have to replace my OS with another Windows XP. Is this true? Why can't I use my replacement disc's on a new hard drive?

Create full image of HDD and keep it on DVD/CD or external HDD (in your case it will be very usefull). And whenever you need, you could easily and fast restore system as ity was before. Really recommend, I always use this way to be sure that all my important data is safe (including OS and all apps).
