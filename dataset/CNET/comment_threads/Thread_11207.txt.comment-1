Hi I have been backing up my files onto an 8gb Transcend Flash Drive.
The other day when I went to access one of the files, the drive asked me to format, which I know is the wrong thing to do.
When I look at the drive properties the pie chart indicates that the drive is full but it also says 0 bytes on the drive.
Is there any way to recover the files on this drive or am I out of luck.
Running Windows XP Media Edition SP2 on Dell PC.
Many thanks for any help you can give me.
