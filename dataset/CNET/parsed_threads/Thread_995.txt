<s> Do you reccomend leaving the power button on all the time? </s>
<s> Power Setting -Turn off monitor: 15 minutes -Turn off hard discs: 30 minutes -Sytem Standby: 1 hour -System Hibernate: Never </s>
<s> The choice to turn off, or leave on a computer system, and the arguments thereabout form one of the ongoing Religious wars in the computer world. </s>
<s> You will hear both opinions expressed vehemently, fervently, acerbically, and loudly. </s>
<s> As a computer maintenacne technician for the last 34 years, my suggestion is to pick a religion, and abide by it. </s>
<s> I have walked in on systems that have been powered on continuously for 8 years without problems (no, not even the disks!). </s>
<s> However, when you power down one of these always-on puppies, you say a lot of prayers when you power it back on. </s>
<s> The power up cycle includes &quot;inrush&quot; current that can blow a weak component, and has on many occassions. </s>
<s> Of course, Now you Broke my machine! </s>
<s> is the first thing you hear. </s>
<s> On the other hand, Fans and disks in particular wear out over time, they can't help it, they're mechanical, and they spin on bearings. </s>
<s> Turning them off of course stops the wear, so instead of lasting the &quot;statutory&quot; 5 years, they may well function for 15 years of intermittent use. </s>
<s> Anything in the machine that is going to die after 2 years of power-on time, may last 6-7 years of intermittent use. </s>
<s> So both sides see that they are right, and they always will. </s>
<s> Pick a side, and join the fun. </s>
<s> like me. </s>
<s> I basically turn the computer on when I get home from school at 3:00. </s>
<s> Then since I am on and off the whole night, I just leave it on. </s>
<s> Then when I go to bed, I turn it off. </s>
<s> Thats just my opinion. </s>
<s> The emachine has trouble starting up, so it goes into standby some hours a day. </s>
<s> It stays on the others to cut on power. </s>
<s> I Tryed the power settings,turn momitor off 15min, Turn Hard Discs off: 30 min. </s>
<s> I then tryed leaving it on all the time with screen saver on. </s>
<s> My wife & I went to town one day & when we came in we smelled something was burning. </s>
<s> We found that one of case fans was smoking. </s>
<s> We were lucky only had to replace the fan & every thing was ok . </s>
<s> I allways turn the cup;s off at night or when we are gone. </s>
<s> Good luck to you. </s>
<s> Gordon </s>
<s> Its now set to do standby every 5 hours. </s>
<s> That way it starts up properly Is that fine? </s>
