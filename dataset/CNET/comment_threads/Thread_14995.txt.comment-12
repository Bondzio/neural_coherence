Definitely a power consumed depends on it's rating that's why it is marked.Look the general power rating is calculated as P=VIcos*,where * is the angle to which voltage or current lags or leads each other.Incase of integrated devices the load depends on the bias of the semi-conductor chip used.Once the component is overloaded forward biased route is replaced by a reverse biased stream and hence excess of electricity used.And as for unwanted components ,yes it is to be removed asap.
