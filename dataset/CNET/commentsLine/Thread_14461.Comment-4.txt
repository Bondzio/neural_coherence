and you wrote about vista ultimate.
if the issue is not about vista, then that is lost in your posting.
however there is an damming issue with those boards and when you fill all the slots.
the memory timing must be relaxed (slowed) for it to work.
the owners are miffed about that and there is nothing you can do for them since it's a design flaw.
they usually take a few weeks to look into it and they discover the truth.
keep those old boards with just 2 sticks to steer around the issue.
