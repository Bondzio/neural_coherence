yall make it sound so difficult.
its probably an ip addroess conflict.
the modem has a default ip address of probably 192.168.0.1 and you router probably does too.
google ur models and they should tell u the exact ip address.
ok connect modem with lan cable to pc.
type in ip address in ie, and u should get to a browser based config utility for your modem.
just change the ip to something other than ur router ip address, and make sure no computer will ever use that address on ur network.
ex 192.168.0.2 instead of 192.168.0.1. then rehook everything and you sohuld get connected.
