Can anybody specify brands and models?
So is clear that I dont need a programmable switch, a regular giga switch will do it, right?
Why not a giga switch (seems cheaper) thatn a Giga router?
What benefits do I get getting a Giga router, I just want to be able to send big video files across the small pc network, is it worth it?
Thanks.
