I &quot;work&quot; for a non-profit therapeutic riding program and we have begun to grow and now need a database to keep up with our horses and kids. I found one that I think will fit our needs EquineMax (I believe it is Access-based), the only problem is that it is not web-based. We all use our laptops and do a lot of work out of our homes. There are about 4 of us that need to access a database and input/delete data from different locations. We work in a remote area that has basically no internet access other than air-cards that we bring. I originally thought that online storage would be a good solution but several people have told me that you cannot &quot;host&quot; a database program on those. I thought about building a simple network but have not done that in 10 years--but I am willing to learn. I agreed to take over this project since I am the most computer savvy--which is not saying much. I have talked to several computer friends but none seem to have a good idea on where to start. We do not have a budget to allow us to hire a company to work it out for us--so any help or direction you could point me in would be VERY appreciated!!!
