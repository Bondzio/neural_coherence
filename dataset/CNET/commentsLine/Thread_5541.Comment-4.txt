because once you have a drive with xp installed on it first (as your current master drive has), even if you install w98 on the second drive, you won't have the ability to dual boot to 'either/or'.
the only way that works is if both drives are ntfs, such as w2k and then xp or xp and then w2k (and even the second option for dual booting would be 'iffy') or if you start with w98 installed on the first bootable drive.
this is because the boot.ini file gets altered during the second operating system installation to include the dual boot option screen as you boot up.
you can easily format the second drive you want to install and just use it as storage instead and save all that harddrive space by not installing an operating system on it.
it will definitely change the drive letter sequence initially because it probably has a primary dos partition on it already so it will become the d: drive letter.
however, with xp, once you boot up, you can go into administrative tools\drive management and give that drive letter whatever letter you want, including the last one in line so it falls into line behind all others except for cdroms.
for example...if you have c,d,e,f now..you could make this drive g and all your programs, etc.
will continue to use the drive letters they originally were assigned for the shortcuts you use.
you could also format that drive to also be ntfs so it matches up with the rest of the drives/partitions by just right clicking it once it's installed and assigned a drive letter you choose.
