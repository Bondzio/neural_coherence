<s> Good Morning, Currently working on two flavours of the Toshiba NB525 and everytime I feel like I'm getting somewhere a wall pops up and smacks me flat on the ass. </s>
<s> See, my current contract holder has decided (against all supported arguement) that netbooks are the future and wishes to replace desktops with them. </s>
<s> In the next few months I am expected to have upwards of 400 of these little ******** rolled out. </s>
<s> That being said, doing each one manually would be a pain in the rear and I've been working with our ZENWorks manager to get our imaging server compatible. </s>
<s> Well images can be made but there are still massive issues with imaging as these netbooks just dont seem to want to work the way I tell em to. </s>
<s> Anyways question is.. Is anyone else doing netbooks through an imaging server? </s>
<s> If so what OS are you using? </s>
<s> (We're trying to use windows7) What hints or tips can you give out? </s>
<s> Microsoft has courses and seminars on this. </s>
<s> Is the IT staff unwilling or unable to take the courses on this? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I only hold the contract to work in the shop, the in-house technicians are reluctant to use Microsoft anything(except as standard OS') and while they have access to microsoft training, I do not and since I am on contract I will not be given any. </s>
<s> To be honest, I feel like I've been placed in a box of bricks, because I am constantly relying on others work to further this effort and it is not a high priority to others but it is a major portion of my workload. </s>
<s> I would love to take any courses offered but have neither the time (as this contract is paid hourly) or the money(as it would be out of personal pocket) So here i am, looking for any assistance. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Over the years I've taken time to go to quite a few. </s>
<s> Fast forward to today. </s>
<s> Once in awhile you find folk that think what you asked about can be written in one or two pages. </s>
<s> Or in this forum in less than a few paragraphs. </s>
<s> Sadly it's not that simple. </s>
<s> If it was, there would be no need for the courses, books, seminars and investing our time learning our trade. </s>
<s> If you must do this at zero cost, be sure to use google but add this -&gt; MSDN. </s>
<s> A lot of the course content is on MSDN. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
