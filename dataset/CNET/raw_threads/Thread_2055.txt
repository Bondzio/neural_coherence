Thanks for all the great insight on this board.

Connect the headphone jack into the speaker out from your PC and the red and white RCA jacks into one of the AUX inputs on your stereo.

As mentioned, you will need one that splits the signal into the two channels. Radio Shack probably has such. However, you will have some problems if the cable is of much length. The longer it needs to run, the more likely it will pick up noise and especially 60 cycle hum. Impedance match is important so check to be sure your line out and auxillary ports match in this category. Get high quality (cost more) cables if you go further than 6 to 10 feet.

I think this would be the most basic of all the solutions.
