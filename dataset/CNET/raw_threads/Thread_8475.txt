1097	0	285595	2715457	NR	tenglert	2/26/08 1:52 PM	1.20403392E12	Wireless disappeared	I have an hp pavillion dv6000 with vista premium, and use a wireless conection. It all worked fine until one day the wlan disappeared! It doesn't even show it in device manager, nor in the &quot;view network connections,&quot; and the wireless switch doesn't do anything. It also doesn't load hp wireless assistant anymore... No hardware problems, and I'm pretty sure I didn't manually change anything... any ideas?
