i currently have a few users from my company using cisco vpn client 5.0.06. sometimes when they're away, they can not connect to the hotel or airport wireless network using the cisco vpn client.
i have investigated and it seems that sometimes the router they are trying to connect to is not compatible with cisco vpn client protocols.
( well..most of the times ) my question is: is there a better solution that cisco vpn client, one that will allow them to connect to any type of router that airports and hotels are using?
thanks!
