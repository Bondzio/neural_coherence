Thanks in Advance, Danny

Since RAM is used to cache hard disk reads and writes the worst things are crashes and next are corrupted data being written to the hard disk (hello format.) But that's par for overclockers and they get used to it. As to any speed hit you should run a benchmark (pick one?) and see the effect before and after. Bob

When you have RAM chipsets that are operating at different clock speeds, the computer most times will default to the lowest chipset speed. Sometimes, though, the computer will even drop RAM clock speed to half of the chipset speeds, i.e. a 350mhz and 266mhz will default to 133mhz. It is best NOT to mix clock speeds. The only thing that happens is your computer will load slow, run slow, and frustrate the ever-loving beegeebers out of you. It has happened to two friends.

It is likely that you will still get a performance improvement becuase the improvement you gain from the extra memory is likely more significant than the performance difference you will experience based on the memory speed. The best option of courase would be to use memory of equal speed. It is not a good idea to tweek your system to try to run memory above its rated speed. this can cause instability.
