I've got a 3Com 10 port managed POE switch were using to connect to wireless APs in a school I give some volunteer support to. We've 8 ports in use with APs and one is used to link with the router. We have a potential need to add 2 more APs but, with 9 in use, we're one port short. I have POE injectors but would prefer to connect to this switch because we turn it on and off separately from the other network devices. This POE switch has an SFP port. BTW, the model # is 3CDSG10PWR-US. Can I buy a module to fit this port that allow me to plug the Ethernet cable from the router into it and gain use of all 10 POE ports? These modules come in many forms and some are quite pricey. The manual for the switch doesn't get into this sort of detail. I guess they expect folks who buy these to know how to use them. TIA

They make a technical product and while I know a little about Cisco gear when it comes down to specific part numbers and does it work with this or that I always call them. Bob

Stupid forum will not cleanly let me post the specs on your switch so. You only have 9 ports. The last port is shared with the SFP module. This is very common trick vendors do when counting ports. The 10th port can either be the built in port or the SFP. Both are not active. In your case the last port is not even POE so should put your router in port 10 In general I do not think I have seen a SFP that can do PoE itself. They can do copper 10/100/1000 but not the PoE. Many times in switches like this they do not support the copper SFP module since its silly to do it since the built in port is already 10/100/1000 copper. I think you are out of luck you are going to have to daisy chain another switch to make this work.

We also have a 50 port switch. 40 are standard 10/100, and 2 are 10/100/1000. It also has an SFP port that, I believe, is shared with one of the gigabit ports. I'll re-read the spec sheet on the POE switch. We originally only expected to need 4 or 5 APs so bought a smaller switch. That became 8 APs very quickly do to some amateur miscalculations on my part. Hey, I'm just a guy off the street and not an IT wizard. We'd now like to add more coverage. We use the management capabilities minimally...mainly to enable/disable ports as needed. You can also enable/disable power to any port. I enabled 1-8 so can easily check to see if I can get power to the other 2. Otherwise, the APs we bought came with injectors and we can use those as needed. You just lose some remote management ability though but that's not critical. Thanks for pointing that out. I'll check to see if you're correct that only 9 ports will available for POE.

It should have 10 available ports	This is the switch http://www.3cbsi.com/other/pdfs/products/en_US/3com_401049.pdf 3Com does list accessories for its products. I should be able to find what I need from them. The SFP port shows as dual purpose...copper or fiber. I need copper and it should work as desired if I just find the right module. Thanks again.

It doesn't say shared or which port but I remember that trick with 5 port hubs. The 5th was just an extension of #4 to be used as an uplink without needing a crossover cable. I suppose that all I need to do is enable the SFP and see if another port gets lost. So much for that idea.

All the sites that sell these seem to have a similar listing. http://www.buy.com/prod/3com-officeconnect-managed-gigabit-ethernet-switch-with-poe-9-x-10-100/q/loc/101/204860509.html The SFP you would need is 3CSP93 The 2 sfp the have listed are mm and single mode fiber. I suspect since it is not listed it will not take the 93.
12463	9	355346	3108479	3108430	Steven Haninger	8/21/09 4:25 PM	1.2508719E12	Thats the one but I linked to the 3Com site	It shows the SFP 91 and 92 as options. These aren't dirt cheap and I don't see what would be the purpose of having 10 POE ports when one obviously has a need for some sort of uplink that won't need power. The only SFP connector we have now links the fiber optic broadband system to the LAN and that part is owned by Time Warner. I can see using these for fiber or longer distances than Ethernet but all I'd want is to use it to uplink to the router to gain one more port. That doesn't, at this point, look to be an economical solution. This is only a small K-8 school. We installed wireless for the laptop/netbook use in the upper grade classrooms, library, and common areas. It's been working wonderfully for that purpose and don't want to make trouble. I doubt this is a good idea now but was worth a shot. Thanks again
