1.1.1	Hi , I 'm working on trying to get a system put together for a specific set of uses , and i 'm curious if anyone would be willing to take the time to assist me in picking out a decent set of parts to go with for it .	St
1.1.2	What follows is my basic spec of what I need .	St
1.1.3	I 'm trying to put together the best system I can for the least amount of cost , as the system will be used primarily for multi-media , DVD playing , etc .	St
1.1.4	1 .	St
1.1.5	Micro Atx size case ( desktop style - that lays flat instead of standing upright ) .	St
1.1.6	2 .	St
1.1.7	Sound card that fully supports Dolby 5.1/DTS 5.1 audio , w/ analog or digital outs that can easily connect to a home theatre reciever .	St
1.1.8	3 .	St
1.1.9	10/100 fast ethernet port or card 4 .	St
1.1.10	3.5 & quot ; floppy drive 5 .	St
1.1.11	16x DVD-Rom that fully supports reading DVD-R/DVD+R DVD-RW/DVD+RW recorded disks .	St
1.1.12	6 .	St
1.1.13	256MB or 512MB of DDR value priced RAM .	St
1.1.14	7 .	St
1.1.15	64MB ( approximately ) video memory with decent quality svideo out .	St
1.1.16	8 .	St
1.1.17	60GB or larger 7200rpm ata 100 or 133 Hard drive 9 .	St
1.1.18	1.5ghz or faster processor ( that handles modern multi media uses ) .	St
1.1.19	Overall , i 'm looking for the best system I can put together that is like this description given .	St
1.1.20	i.e .	St
1.1.21	a system that will give the best performance/speed for the least amount of cost .	St
1.1.22	It will not be used for high end games or intensive business applications .	St
1.1.23	Its primary use will be for serving DVD content , MP3 audio and emulated games .	St
1.1.24	Any assistance with suggestions on parts for such a system would be greatly appreciated .	St
1.1.25	I look forward to hearing from people .	St
1.1.26	Thanks for your time !	St
1.2.1	anything .	St
1.2.2	Modern CPU 's , video , and memory run hotter than hades .	St
1.2.3	Micro ATX is usually mobos that have the sound , video in the chipset .	St
1.2.4	Not certain that you will be happy with such .	St
1.2.5	Get a case that allows some cooling capability in the event that you find the need to upgrade .	St
1.2.6	I use , only towers that have a top exhaust fan .	St
1.3.1	The killer item in your post is that & quot ; emulated games & quot ; item .	St
1.3.2	Such require multi-GHz CPUs and some many hundred Watts of heat to get out of a micro-atx case .	St
1.3.3	This is an exercise in & quot ; how to build your own easy bake oven. & quot ; There are those combo small box units but that budget item makes that a non-starter .	St
1.3.4	Since budget is an issue , do not use the micro-atx case .	St
1.3.5	Bob	St
1.4.1	ok , this is the PRO MicroATX suggestion this case is n't exactly MICRO , but it 's still considered a MicroATX case ( and not so ugly if you ask me ) http : //www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp ? description=11-144-111 & depa=1 avliable in other colors , green is just my favorite ... if you goto newegg , and into cases select Aspire as the brand , and MicroATX-Desktop as the case type , and then hit enter , it should give you all the options IF NOT just select Aspire as the brand , and then they should all be on Pg 3 or 4 ( possibly 5 , they are all together as they all cost the same ) ALSO for low thermal design you need to avoid Pentium 4 , as it will run way to hot ( it 's like 130W currently ) i 'd go with Athlon64 , something like a 2800+ or 3000+ for Socket 754 , or a 3200+ for Socket 939 ( you can get the 3200+ for Socket 754 , it 'd be fine ) that case is n't amazingly small but it 's not huge it 'll fit any MicroATX motherboard , and it 's cooled by a 120MM fan ( which is n't common for a microATX , most get an 80MM or lesser ) 99 % of all MicroATX motherboards will sport onboard video , as their usually designed as a value soltuion ( cheaper to build given that they use less PCB/parts , and therefore you can set up an entire system on a MicroATX board and a Celeron/Sempron for around $ 200 ( how do you think Dell does it ) ) as for a motherboard , I would look for the best chipset you can find ... for Intel on MicroATX the best i 've seen ( that still stays cost effective ) is the 865 , going to LGA 775 on MicroATX is just very expensive , as it 's the 915 with PCIE ( or AGP ) and the GMA 900 , which is actually a good graphics accelerator ( for integrated graphics ) as to cooling there are a lot of modern retail PC 's with cooling lesser than a single 120MM fan ( it will move A LOT OF AIR , and if it 's not powerful enough : http : //www.sidewindercomputers.com/de12tfexhisp.html , please note , i 'm not responsible if the computer becomes airborne while this fan is being used ) if your able to afford maybe..hmm , $ 1500 total you could check out www.dangerden.com and pick up a BASIC water cooling system that uses a 120MM or dual 120MM radiator , and cool the CPU/NB that way , keeping both noise , and internal heat DOWN i would not advise a water cooling kit , as their parts are very low quality and will not give the performance of the same cost if you buy a higher grade of parts , and assemble it yourself	St
1.5.1	that made the original post .	St
1.5.2	By telling Robert , your suggestions may never get read by the original poster .	St
1.5.3	You know your hardware , now , please , learn the forum indentation system .	St
1.6.1	i understand it fine i was replying to Bob , as a comment on the EZ bake oven thing and most people just go from top to bottom reading everything/if he wanted advice he could read it	St
1.7.1	But I 'm not sure if they have much in the way of long & flat designs ... they more go for cubes .	St
1.7.2	Still , I 've heard good things about them , and they 've got a system for most any current processor ( AMD 64 included ) ; a lot of people use them for gaming b/c of their portability .	St
1.7.3	Still , the good barebones are gon na be around US $ 300 ( that is without a HD , Optical drive , or graphics card )	St
1.8.1	I always ask first , & quot ; what 's your budget ? & quot ; That way , I can give a more reasonable response .	St
1.8.2	Anyway , you can find lots of microATX boards with 10/100 ethernet and 5.1 sound onboard that just may support what you want ( 'cept for digital out . )	St
1.8.3	My daughter 's system has it .	St
1.8.4	JMHO , but I 'd get a DVD burner to ensure compatibility with the various types of media you want read- most cd-rom/dvd players wont guarantee playback of so many different types of media , and dvd-burners are so cheap now , I think it 'd be worth the extra $ 20 .	St
1.8.5	Circuit City is forever running sales on large capacity hardrives- I think I got my 250 gig Western Digital for about $ 80 after rebate , and for $ 15 , I purchased an extened 3 yr. warranty from WD .	St
1.8.6	I think you should go for at least 512 megs of ram if you 're running XP-if you want to go cheap , you 'll find it at newegg .	Sug
1.8.7	However , when it comes to ram , I 'd rather go with a name brand like Crucial or Samsung ; 512 goes for around $ 90 .	St
1.8.8	I had a G-Force 4 with 64 megs of memory that had excellent output for vids ... think it was made by Chaintech .	St
1.8.9	If you 're not going to be rendering video or anything , I think you 'd do fine with a 1.5 Ghz .	St
1.8.10	Personally , if I were to go small form factor , I 'd go with a Shuttle type case instead of the flat case .	St
1.8.11	I 'd want just that little bit of air-flow .	St
1.8.12	If your intent is to have a simple media box , I think it 's doable for around $ 500- or possibly less ; newegg sells refurb parts .	St
1.8.13	Just my 3 cents .	St
1.9.1	I did a search at newegg , they only have 1 desktop case .	St
1.9.2	It comes with a 200w PSU , not big enough for you needs .	St
1.9.3	If you want more help we do need your budget .	St
1.9.4	John http : //www2.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16811123030	Ques
1.10.1	gave ? ? ?	Ques
1.10.2	It has a 420 watter .	St
