1.1.1	Current system: Dell Dimension 4550 1 Gig RAM Radeon 9800 Pro Pentium 4 2.66 ghz X-fi audio Moderate gamer, internet, music, productivity.	St
1.1.2	Will a new graphics card allow me to squeeze another year or so out of this system?	St
1.1.3	Played Half-life 2 w/out too much difficulty, F.E.A.R.	St
1.1.4	w/ graphics turned down a fair amount.	St
1.1.5	Thnx	St
1.2.1	...so I'd just save your pennies for a new system.	St
1.2.2	Preferably one that you build.	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	So it's not worth upgrading my card?	St
1.4.2	I think it's actually not the Pro version (only 128 MB).	St
1.4.3	Who has time to build their own system My Dell has actually served me pretty well, looking at the XPS 600.	St
1.4.4	What would be the AMD equivalent?	St
1.4.5	Dell has some pretty good free upgrades, plus I have a 20% off coupon.....	St
1.5.1	A SAPPHIRE 100131L Radeon X800GTO 256MB is about $170.	St
1.5.2	A BFG Tech Geforce 6800GS 256MB is about $200.	St
1.5.3	It's hard to find apples-to-apples benchmarks for the 9800pro and these cards so you'll have to interpolate.	St
1.5.4	The X800GTO will perform between an X800 Pro and an X800XL; the 6800GS will be a bit better than a 6800GT.	St
1.5.5	http://www.tomshardware.com/2005/07/05/vga_charts_vii/page5.html As you can see, both will be a nice upgrade over your 9800Pro.	St
1.5.6	Anything less (6600gt or x1600xt) would not give you any significant boost.	St
1.6.1	...as a 9800Pro with 256MB VRAM.	St
1.6.2	They're all 128.	St
1.6.3	There are regular 9800's with 256MB, but that doesn't mean that they perform better than the Pro.	St
1.6.4	If you don't want to build a new system, and you're planning on spending a couple grand on an XPS600, I'd look at Overdrive PC.	St
1.7.1	Arent' all their systems in the $5,000 range?	St
1.7.2	Also, I'm not sure what the AMD equivalent of a Dual Core Pentium D 3.0 ghz is.	St
1.7.3	With the 20% discount, I can get the XPS w/ the above processor, GeForce 6800, Xi-fi audio, 2 gigs of RAM, and a 20&quot; flat panel for about 2 grand.	St
1.7.4	Seems like a decent deal.........	St
1.8.1	...before they sell them to you.	St
1.8.2	The AMD equivalent of the 930 would be the X2 3800+, but when Overdrive overclocks it, it becomes the equivalent of the EE955.	St
1.8.3	True, the Overdrive costs more than the Dell, but you're getting a better machine from a better company.	St
1.9.1	i assume that's the 20&quot; widescreen you mentioned.	St
1.9.2	the graphics card is wimpy but you can solve that yourself.	St
1.9.3	do you have the corporate discount that includes the 3yr in-home service?	Ques
1.9.4	one of my friends only buys dells (for about 6 years now) and he's only had two problems with them.	St
1.9.5	some small part was broken (a drive rail/clip i believe) and it took 2 weeks of going back-and-forth with tech support to get them to understand what was broken (they kept thinking it was the drive).	St
1.9.6	the other problem was with his wife's laptop which had an in-home warranty.	St
1.9.7	it kept started flaking out after about a year and they replaced the system board.	St
1.9.8	it still kept falking out and the tech started randomly replacing components.	St
1.9.9	so my friend had to escalate it to a manager... they sent swapped out the old laptop with a brand new one that was faster, had more memory, and a larger hard drive.	St
1.9.10	so i have no problem with dell and $2k is pretty good.	St
1.10.1	...but every OEM does that.	St
1.10.2	That 6800 will suck, especially playing at 1600x1200, but at least he won't need to upgrade the PSU for a better gfx card.	St
1.10.3	If I were spending this much money on a PC, I'd get Overdrive becuase they overclock everything to the max, and they use AMD.	St
1.10.4	But it's his money, and therefore his decision.	St
