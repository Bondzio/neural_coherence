I have gone into the router numerous times and reset it, unplugged it, retyped the WEP key, tried to shift to WPA and nothing works. None of three computers in the house will connect unless all encryption is off. We live in a good neighborhood on a cul de sac, don't get a lot of traffic through here, and know the immediate neighbors, but nothing is stopping a stranger with a laptop from sitting on the street and using our wifi. I've talked to the Comcast tech. The trouble just seems to be our boxes won't get past the WEP encryption stage. Has anyone had this problem?

4151	3	557496	5282383	5282295	billj6	3/4/12 5:40 PM	1.3308828E12	Motorola	It's the Surfboard SBG900 router and modem. My SSID is one simple word.

4151	6	557496	5282858	5282845	R. Proffitt	3/5/12 6:26 PM	1.33097196E12	I can't know this.	As the makers can change anything, if we can't see all settings we'll have to go with bum router. It could be as simple as the old hidden SSID issue. Bob
4151	7	557496	5283243	5282858	billj6	3/6/12 4:59 PM	1.33105314E12	Motorola	My computer finds my strong router signal when instructed to search for wireless networks within range then lists two from my neighbors with weak or non existent signal. Two boxes in the house run just fine on wireless with no encryption.
