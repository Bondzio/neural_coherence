1.1.1	OK a few months ago I bought a wired router so I can connect my computer and my playstation 3 to the internet .	St
1.1.2	So having put in the CD to my computer and installing whatever I needed and hooking up the cables to the correct location the connect worked great for the PS3 and the computer .	St
1.1.3	but after a few months something has happened to my router I think .	St
1.1.4	At first MSN messenger would n't login .	St
1.1.5	Then on internet explorer some websites like facebook.com I was told was n't working while it was working on firefox , all a while the playstation connection was working fine .	St
1.1.6	Then the internet a whole went down and one day it just would n't work on the playstation 3 and computer .	St
1.1.7	So after looking at it for a while I decided to just connect the high speed connection box straight to the computer instead of through the router to the computer and playstation and it seemed to work .	St
1.1.8	Internet is working fine on the computer now .	St
1.1.9	So I was wondering did I do something wrong with the router during hookup to only allow it to work for a few months or did the router itself just fail after awhile .	St
1.1.10	The router is a D-Link and were using Windows XP and for the playstation just a default thing Sony has .	St
1.1.11	I tried pressing the reset button on the router and still nothing .	St
1.1.12	If you need more info just ask I 'll try to clarify .	Sug
