hi rhender105, yes it is possible to setup file sharing between the 2 over your network.
windows isnt very &quot;friendly&quot; with non-windows computers so your non-windows computers have to trick windows into thinking its just another windows pc.
the way this is done is via samba.
samba is used in linux and macosx environments to allow sharing of files.
i dont have the exact instructions for macosx but i'm sure apple's website provides good information about it (i've seen it there somewhere before).
i may not be a macosx user currently but i use linux (which both run off unix environment) and they use a lot of the same technics and programs.
hope this helps!
