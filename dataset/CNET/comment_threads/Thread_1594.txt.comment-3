WHY?
Don't cut corners on memory.
Memroy and FBS, not CPU, dictates how fast your system is.
(don't flame..CPU speed is part of the equation, but I've seen systems w/Slow CPUs' smoke faster CPUs' due to the M/B and memory) See http://www.aceshardware.com/Spades/read.php?article_id=5000186 Old but still prevelant Bill
