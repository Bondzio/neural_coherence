the best would be to expand/extend &quot;C&quot; to fill the adjacent FREE SPACE (300GBs).
The other is to use DISK MANAGEMENT in Windows 7 to create the partition and (quick format) it for use.
If you're not sure how to do that.....just 'google' it or search these forums to find a post that has outlined the step by step process.
Before starting, recommend you do a fresh backup to preclude any loss of data.
Here's a link to the 'expand/extend' options.
