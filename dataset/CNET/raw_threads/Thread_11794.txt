These devices are part of my home entertainment center that is in the basement rec room ; away from my router in the upstairs office.

I have a wireless router (D-Link Dir615) for my network and everything is connecting OK most of the time, but my Wii and Sony blu ray need to connect for firmware updates. I have the ability to go online with the Wii but also need a method of hooking up the blu ray. It would complete my system if there was better range to work between floors in my home! -Both have web accessability. Wii has USB but I believe Sony uses RJ45. My connection isn't always present.

I read your first post and it reads as if you want to access your blu ray from other places, same about the games. This is a no go area or rather all the copy protections and more mean we can't use our blu ray and games from other places in the house with any reliable, published, you and I can set it up with stuff I bought at the usual store solution. Your reply however seems to have the usual question about how to get the internet to these devices. That's been done many many times. -&gt; Since wifi seems to fail you and we know N promises more but doesn't always deliver why not the usual power line HD bridge?

I did some online research and have decided to purchase a bridge to create a wireless access point for my ent. ctr. My D-Link router will comunicate with the D-Link DAP 1522 bridge (extending the range)and I will hook up all my hardware w/CAT5 computer wiring. This will enable my devices to go on line. Sorry for the misunderstanding; and thanks again for your help... Tom

I paid 25 for it refurb and know why. The setup instructions would cause most to return it but you can imagine I worked with it and it was just the thing for my kid's 360 and PC bridge. The xbox 360 wifi runs 99 bucks. For much less I got the PC and 360 on the air. Bob
