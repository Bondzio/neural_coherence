as i understand it, based on what i know about my verizon dsl connection, the dslam in the central office (or the remote terminal) maintains a one-to-one sync with the modem at the customer premise.
if you introduce a second modem, the dslam won't know what to do with its signal.
the connection through the first modem may or may not continue to work, but if it does work at all, it will likely work badly.
so don't even think about trying two dsl modems on the same phone line.
if you need to share the internet connection between multiple computers, you need a broadband router.
then standard networking, either wired or wireless, is required between your computers and the router.
there may also be some routing capability built into your dsl modem (you didn't tell us anything about it), but even then you'd likely need additional networking equipment for distributing the connection to the additional computer(s).
