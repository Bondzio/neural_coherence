ribbon got broken almost immediate after printer mechanism gets moving.
it doesn't even require to actually print anything to get ribbon broken.
it's just enough to pull the paper towards and when both media and ribbon mechanism starts to rolling ribbon will rub off just above head starting from left to right.
problem does not occur when i manually turn ribbon spindle (instead of paper) which also automatically makes paper spindle to move.
in that scenario ribbon doesn't got broke.
it must be some mechanical damage but i can't figure out what kind of.
any ideas?
