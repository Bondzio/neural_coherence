I don't know what &quot;tx rate&quot; is, so I have no idea if it is locked at 54 mbps.
How/where do I check?
Tried just about every channel for the router; we are currently on &quot;4&quot; since it is the only channel that doesn't have anyone on it, but there are a few on 2 and a few on 5 and 6, so it's probably interacting... At least this is &quot;rare&quot; and not just us being stupid!
Thanks!
