I have a AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual core Processor 5200+ (2.70GHz) 2GB of ram, a 650watt power supply and an open PCI-E slot I was just curious would my computer be able to handle a graphics card like the NVIDIA Geforce GTX 560/570/580?
I used to have an ATI Radeon HD 4850 but its gone now.
Just wondering what restricts someone from running a powerful video card?
Thanks!
