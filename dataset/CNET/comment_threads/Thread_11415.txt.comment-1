My ISP is Telus.. we have the Speedtouch ST516v6 modem the modem is rated up to 10Mbps and my ISP can provide up to 15Mbps the setup: ISP &gt; DLink (DIR815) wireless router &gt; 2 Netgear Gigabit GS108 switches.
first switch is for the house computers (4-5 computers, all wired connection) second switch has 2 routers connected, they are on different floors.
router2 is a linksys router3 is a netgear.
what settings should be changed in order for people to connect too.. Im expecting anywhere from 30-60 users on at any given time.
there are people telling me that they sometimes arent connecting or connected but have no internet.
