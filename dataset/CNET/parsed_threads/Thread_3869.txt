<s> I want to get new RAM for my notebook, and I've noticed that there can be quite a big difference in price for the same type of RAM, but from different companies. </s>
<s> Some big brands, such as Kingston, can be up to 70 dollars more expensive than the ones that are Generic. </s>
<s> What is the reason for this price differential? </s>
<s> on this website: http://www.ec.kingston.com/ecom/configurator/modelsinfo.asp?SysID=17853&mfr=Toshiba&model=Satellite+P10&distributor=0&submit1=Search it says this: KTT3614/xxx (266) and KTT3311/xxx (333) are both supported for this system, and can be mixed, but will only run at 266MHz no matter what is installed. </s>
<s> Does that mean that no matter what type of RAM i use, it will run at 266 or does it mean if I mix different types, it will run at 266? </s>
<s> if you mix different types, it will run at 266. </s>

<s> &gt; Does that mean that no matter what type of RAM i &gt; use, it will run at 266 or does it mean if I mix &gt; different types, it will run at 266? </s>
<s> Doesn't quite mean either. </s>
<s> I assume the motherboard has a maximum FSB (Front Side Bus) speed of 133, which is doubled to 266 for DDR memory. </s>
<s> So that's the maximum speed the RAM will run, even if it's capable of going faster (eg. </s>
<s> 166/333). </s>
<s> If you put in slower RAM (eg. </s>
<s> 100/200), I've heard that it will slow the bus down to that speed, as opposed to trying to run at the higher speed (eg. </s>
<s> 133/266), but I've never actually tried running RAM faster than its rated maximum speed. </s>
<s> Similarly, if you mix RAM with different maximum speeds (eg. </s>
<s> 100/200 and 133/266), both of which are supported by your motherboard, the faster RAM may be slowed down to the lower speed. </s>
<s> Again, I can't speak from personal experience, but my guess is that that's what would happen. </s>
<s> So for your specific example, I'm assuming that the maximum FSB of the motherboard is 133/266 and they're saying that you can use either 133/266 (aka PC2100) or 166/333 (aka PC2700) speed RAM. </s>
<s> The 166/333 speed RAM will presumably just run at 133/266 instead. </s>
<s> For example, I'm currently running 512 MB of PC3200 (200/400 MHz FSB) and 256 MB of PC2100 (133/266). </s>
<s> The PC3200 just runs at the PC2100 speed, which is the maximum standard (ie. </s>
<s> not overclocked) speed of my motherboard. </s>
<s> As for your original question about the differences between different brands of memory, I suppose to some degree you get what you pay for, but I've used several different brands and had few problems, so I generally just go for whatever happens to be on sale. </s>
<s> If you're going to be overclocking, better quality, or simply faster, RAM might be more important. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> Name brand ram is &quot;expected&quot; to deliever and usually does at its rated use, plus *MAYBE* above and beyond, in other words, its the best they provide. </s>
<s> While generics do work well within thier rating, don't expect them do so once out of that. </s>
<s> Not that users do this and/or push the issue but a dividing line is made. </s>
<s> Plus, namebrand ram is tested more rigourously and more likely to be rejected if not up to par, while generics tend to skirt that within reason. </s>
<s> If so, namebrands also provide &quot;top of the line&quot; ram which offer extreme service or the absolute best for that model of ram, once you compare pricing of that with any generic, there will always be a difference, excluding any competive pricing. </s>
<s> As for your laptop, get a namebrand as laptop tend to be hot running beasts and having a better ram will help. </s>
<s> Plus, consider any &quot;lifetime&quot; warranty, read fine print may come in handy should ram fail. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Kingston's ValueRam is considered generic, why is that? </s>
<s> is just a manufactuers modules that didn't pass certain testing required for more critical purposes (such as for dual channel use) but is ok for general use. </s>
<s> There will be quality assurance testing of all modules before they are sold. </s>
<s> Some won't be good enough to sell at all and must be scrapped. </s>
<s> This costs the manufacturer money. </s>
<s> I would have to think that offering their &quot;value&quot; product helps keep the cost of the high end stuff down a bit as well as there is less waste. </s>
<s> Now, some motherboards are more finiky than others and these manufacturers will qualify certain RAM for use on their boards. </s>
<s> Making sure the RAM you choose has been tested and qualified by the MB manufacturer should improve your chances of putting together a stable system. </s>
