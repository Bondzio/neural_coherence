<s> I've always had Epson printers. </s>
<s> Generally, I like them, but.... </s>
<s> They have a problem, which is actually mentioned in their manual. </s>
<s> You have to use them regularly, or the heads clog up! </s>
<s> I want good quality B&W & colour printing. </s>
<s> Acceptable photo printing.... pretty much all the things any home user wants, but what I DON'T want is to attempt to print something & find the heads are clogged because I didn't use the printer for a month or so. </s>
<s> I've never seen this issue mentioned in printer reviews & was wondering if anyone has ever tested various brands for it? </s>
<s> I would love any suggestions as to what printer i could buy that would not require me to use up trees pointlessly, just to keep it running. </s>
<s> Back when we couldn't afford color printers we went to Kinko's. </s>
<s> Hewlett Packard would be my choice, there are many from which to choose.If you want an all in one, the HP 6380 would be a good choice. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
<s> When you buy a new inkjet type prtr. </s>
<s> stay away from Epson models, they tend to clog all too soon vs. other brands. </s>
<s> You should look at Canon or HP models and find what suits you. </s>
<s> Whatever, for more $ look into a laser prtr. </s>
<s> there are several in the low cost area and will not be effected by clogging issues. </s>
<s> Provided its use is basic and general(home use, right) it should provide long term usage and overall be cheaper to operate, though initial cost is higher. </s>
<s> Even now at this time of the season, you're bound to find great pricing on lasers. </s>
<s> However, if you find ink better because of cost, I did mention, laser. </s>
<s> Again, many a prtr. </s>
<s> is being at good pricing now, so look around. </s>
<s> Remember, cheap is cheap, so beware. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks everyone for the advice. </s>
<s> My personal experience certainly bears out the clogging issues thing with Epsons, so I'm thinking it's time for a change. </s>
<s> I will certainly check laser prices, but as I said, I don't print all that often. </s>
