I think the media server, which is not connected to my mini-network yet, is running Windows Server 2003.
Once I connect that machine will that help solve my problems?
I absolutely do not understand networking.
I can do most other forms of PC repair and the like, but networking and network admin stuff boggles me.
Is there a good beginner's tutorial?
