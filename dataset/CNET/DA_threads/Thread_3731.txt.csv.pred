1.1.2	We have a huge number of iBooks that need to have their batteries recalled.	St
1.1.3	However, one of the instructions is to discharge all of the batteries.	St

1.4.3	Gives off irritating or toxic fumes (or gases) in a fire.	St
1.4.4	Explosion: Risk of fire and explosion on contact with combustible substances and water.&quot; Recommendations I've received include: Tape off the contacts to prevent inadvertent shorting; the batteries can then be shipped by SURFACE movement...not air shipment.	St
