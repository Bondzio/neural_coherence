What I meant was that I was going to unplug the modem (which as I understand is supposed to act like a router itself, as well as a modem, but it is not the main router for the network), and leave my WiFi router plugged in.
That way I can take off my firewalls, because there will not be an internet connection, but leave the network intact.
I did not get a chance to work on it last night as I thought I would.
I will try and see if I can get it done sometime today.
