1.1.1	Hello !	St
1.1.2	I want to make a bluetooth device which acts as a really small speaker .	St
1.1.3	It would connect to a phone and have the option of making noise or not making noise .	St
1.1.4	Something really small which can attach to whatever .	St
1.1.5	Then you call it from your phone and it makes noise .	St
1.1.6	Does anyone know how to make this device ?	Ques
1.2.1	The cost and engineering effort would scare off most folk .	St
1.2.2	Way back when I made my own Bluetooth to RS232 device and can share a picture .	St
1.2.3	But today it 's cheaper to buy said thing .	St
1.2.4	In this case , you either dive in to make it or buy it .	St
1.2.5	No one should offer to put a course in electronics and programming in this small text box .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	I have no idea where to begin .	St
1.3.2	Could you please point me to a good starting point ?	Ques
1.3.3	Maybe let me know what I need to learn ?	Ques
1.4.1	The usual college electronics and programming then decades in the electronics industry .	St
1.4.2	Today you could try using google to research this but I 'm running into folk that think that such things can be condensed to fit in this small space or be re-written for every person .	St
1.4.3	Sorry I 'm not that good .	Polite
1.4.4	Maybe you should search for a ready to use device ?	Ques
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	have to convince me that I need one of the device .	St
1.5.2	From what you have posted here , you have not convince me yet .	St
1.5.3	It seems to me it has no real purpose at all .	St
1.5.4	Why & quot ; makes noise & quot ; ?	Ques
1.5.5	If this device can do a better job than what 's already out there then I might consider buying one .	St
1.5.6	Maybe a little bit more thought is necessary though .	St
1.5.7	Good luck on your idea .	Polite
