It's plugged in when I start the computer, so what's the deal? I've attempted the following to get it to work: *Check Device Manager: no yellow or red devices *Try to use &quot;Add Hardware&quot; - it found nothing *Tried to use &quot;Add Hardware&quot; manually - no mouse in the selection Suggestions on getting the thing to work? It's slightly annoying when using some programs to not have a mouse.

I just shut the computer down, plugged the mouse in, and turned the computer on. I can't remember, but I think the first time, or first couple times, the mouse may have worked in Windows ... though maybe not. Aside from Logitech drivers, any other suggestions?

It's a common failure and unless the PS2 port or mouse is dead which your Linux test shows it's not then this is the registry tree I check then I delete that and the files it points to. I consider this just above average user repairs so not everyone survives this one. Bob

I booted back into Windows today, expecting the PS/2 mouse not to work, or my wireless mouse to work (dead battery, I thought). To my surprise, they both work, and I haven't done anything to actually fix the situation. But hey, I'm not complaining. Just figured I'd let you all know that this computer is magical, or something. That, and that it works again.
