Did you read anywhere in the manual that came with the monitors about setting them up to use a VGA signal?
Are you using an adapter to go from the DVI connector to a VGA connector?
Have you adjusted the properties in the video card to a resolution and refresh rate that the LCD monitor will support prior to hooking it up?
A little more info might be helpful as I'm just suggesting general ideas.
