i don't know if you've made a decision about your plans to upgrade.
may i suggest you reconsider and add a few more dollars to the $400 upgrade estimate and get something more powerful and new.
the celeron processor that comes with the dimension 3000 is not a gaming processor, even if you can put the graphics card you want in it.
that processor is barely good enough to multi task regular office applications.
look at tigerdirect.com go to motherboard / cpu combos link.
sort by price.
they have a great motherboard with a ge force 8400 video card for around $100 after rebate.
add a dual-core cpu, cpu fan, and 2 gig of high speed ram ($29 after rebate) and you've spent barely $400 (without shipping), which gives you room to ad a nice hard drive.
good luck.
