1.1.1	I have a eMachines T5212 with a dual pentium (2.66) with an intigrated video card.	St
1.1.2	As of now im thinking about getting the XFX geforce 8600 GTS extream, thinking that the XXX may run a little hot from what ive read from people, and I dont know if the 8800 will fit in my case (but im not sure).	St
1.1.3	My question is, which works best with Intel Nvidia or ATI or does it matter.	St
1.1.4	And are my assumptions about the overheating and size correct.	St
1.1.5	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	hey dude.	St
1.2.2	you are absolutely right about the size and overheating.	St
1.2.3	now i have seen the 8800 GTX with my own 2 eyes.	St
1.2.4	It measures exactly 10.5 inches in length.	St
1.2.5	I measured it because I'm planning to have one in my new system.	St
1.2.6	so i would suggest you measure the distance from your available PCI-Express slot (the one u want to use) to whatever the graphics card may touch.	Sug
1.2.7	If it is less than 11 inches, you probably can't put the GTX in there.	St
1.2.8	Also, since the GTX is power hungry, it requires two 6-pin PCI-E power connections from the power supply.	St
1.2.9	Make sure your power supply has these connections.	St
1.2.10	And, how many watts does your PSU output ?	Ques
1.2.11	I would want at least about 700W if I'm planning to have a GTX.	St
1.2.12	Finally, what kind of cooling does your case have.	St
1.2.13	Make sure it has good air flow and ventilation, or perhaps you may think about water cooling.	St
1.2.14	Bottom line is this (for 8800 GTX): about 11 inches clearance, two 6-pin PCI-E power connections from the Power supply, at least 700W power output, and good cooling.	St
1.2.15	About Nvida vs ATI, I'd go with Nvidia.	St
1.2.16	I believe its more popular and widely used than ATI.	St
1.2.17	But go with whatever works best for you.	St
1.2.18	Hope this helps.	St
1.3.1	Good lookin out.	St
1.3.2	I just bought this power supply on ebay http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&ih=011&sspagename=STRK%3AMEWN%3AIT&viewitem=&item=320110842716&rd=1&rd=1 .	St
1.3.3	It doesnt say it has ANY 6 pin PCI-E connection.	St
1.3.4	I hope this will work with an 8600/8800 card or i just threw away 30 bucks.	St
1.3.5	DO I need to worry about the height or just the length is what can be a concern.	St
1.3.6	I hope the prices go down once ATI releases their dx10 cards.	St
1.4.1	but the PSU you bought does not have any PCI-E power connections.	St
1.4.2	It's not gonna work with your 8600 or 8800.	St
1.4.3	Keep in mind the 8600s need one 6-pin PCI-E, while the 8800s need two 6-pin PCI-Es.	St
1.4.4	Considering the height, there is one concern: Your card (if it is an 8800) is going to block the adjacent PCI (or PCI express) slot because it is pretty thick and covers 2 slots instead of 1.	St
1.4.5	This is not a hazard or anything.	St
1.4.6	It just means that the slot below (with the case upright) your 8800 card will become useless.	St
1.4.7	If you need a good power supply which will supply enough power to your graphics card (and everything else), I recommend the Thermaltake W0106RU ATX 12V 2.2 700W Power Supply.	St
1.4.8	You can get it on this page: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817153039 .As you'll see, it has 2 PCI-E power connections just for your graphics card(s).	St
1.4.9	It has modular cabling so you don't have unused cables lying around in your case blocking the flow of air.	St
1.4.10	And, it has really good reviews (about 91% positive 4star/5star reviews).	St
1.4.11	I know its a bit expensive but you need it or something like it for your graphics card.	St
1.4.12	Hope this helps	St
1.5.1	Thanks.	St
1.5.2	I was reading more into the power supply issue for the conection to my card and found that they make a adaptor which takes 2-4pin connections and converts them into a 6pin if I understand this corrcetly.	St
1.5.3	I think most cards come with this adaptor.	St
1.5.4	Im thinking of going with the PNY 8800 GTS (640MB).	St
1.5.5	Thanks for your help	St
1.6.1	This is what I would need correct??	St
1.6.2	http://www.cwc-group.com/2x4atxto6pcv.html	St
1.7.1	Running on my Dell with stock 305W PSU.	St
1.7.2	Card minimum is 300W.	St
1.7.3	Dell underrates their PSU's.	St
1.7.4	Card just fits in slot with no additional power connections needed.	St
1.7.5	If you go to a 8600GTS one is needed.	St
