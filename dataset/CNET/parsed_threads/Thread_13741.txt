<s> Ok this is my first post here although I have been a regular reader of the newsletter. </s>
<s> Well I had a problem with my monitor 2 days back. </s>
<s> I was watching a movie on my PC when suddenly smoke started coming out of the monitor. </s>
<s> So I immediately turned off the PC and removed the monitor which I thought is busted because it was some 2 or 3 years old when I got it (may be even older) and already went through 2 repairs. </s>
<s> Then I got this another monitor from my friend its &quot;ViewSonic 6&quot; another old one. </s>
<s> Well today it started to flicker (spellings?) </s>
<s> and changing colors to pink, dull white and then back to normal. </s>
<s> So now Im confused that can this be the problem of the Graphics Card. </s>
<s> I have NVidia Ge-Force 128 mb FX5200 series. </s>
<s> I opened the case and touched the metallic part of the card and it was really hot. </s>
<s> but its always like that whenever the PC is running. </s>
<s> As it is my server PC so I never turn it off and it runs continuously but every now and then I give it a restart. </s>
<s> Now I am going to buy LCD monitor so what bothers me is that if I buy the LCD and the problem is with my Graphics Card so after some time if the LCD also gets busted or something then my money would be a waste. </s>
<s> So what I really want to know is that can a problem with Graphics Card or the VGA/AGP slot can harm the monitor in anyway. </s>
<s> Also if I go for a 3rd party cooling for my CPU and Graphics will it be beneficial like the products from Zalman. </s>
<s> Also keep in mind that Im living in a hot climatic region Abu Dhabi UAE where most of the year the temperature is hot. </s>
<s> i don't think your vga card is the culprit here. </s>
<s> (but your PC would greatly benefit with the extra cooling overall) i believe what you have is more of a monitor problem. </s>
<s> two monitors busted one after the other could be a fluke. </s>
<s> old monitors changing colors are normal problems caused by wear and tear but smoke coming out of it isn't. </s>
<s> it might be electrical. </s>
<s> you should try plugging your monitor in a different outlet. </s>
<s> hope this helps. </s>
<s> life is good </s>
<s> I have a FX5200 video card but yours doesn't have a fan&quot; as mine does. </s>
<s> Well, mine is cool for the most part and if yours has a heatsink only(a big one) then heat is already affecting it so any bad spikes aren't going over very well. </s>
<s> To have the 2nd monitor act so quickly in a bad matter suggests the video card is bad as well when the 1st monitor was taken, so you need to attack both ends of problem, replace both. </s>
<s> Also, its possible another problem exists if the monitor going down took others componets/devices with it if things never settle down or become flaky that's the orginal cause. </s>
<s> Another thought you drove the monitor into a hi-freq. </s>
<s> operation that it shouldn't have been or tweeked to extreme and it was short to live that way, especailly for older devices. </s>
<s> When you get the LCD, I strongly suggest to get new video card anyways in light of this as LCD is very intolerate of this type of operation. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> thanks all for replying and there are many possibilies like monitor going bad, or card getting overheated, and even the AGP slot can be faulty but I have to go with jeniesis1 stating that extra cooling would benefit my pc because I use photoshop, illustrator and 3ds max so I think its a must to get extra cooling for VGA. </s>
<s> normally my PC is at 39 deg celcius and under high pressure it goes maximum to 55 or 56 deg celcius which to my knowledge isn't harmful. </s>
<s> however I don't have any idea about how to check the temperature of VGA. </s>
<s> is there any utility then plz tell me. </s>
<s> also my FX5200 has a fan and when card gets heat up it starts to spin so crazy that I can even hear it what I think is that a fan for VGA would be useful not for processor plus I will currently buy a normal monitor to test for some months about the condition of the card and the motherboard's AGP slot. </s>
<s> if anything goes wrong not much of the money would go to waste and I will buy 512Mb RAM to speed up the PC how do you like the idea? </s>
