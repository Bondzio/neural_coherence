every tablet i've seen runs on apple ios or android, or blackberry os etc.
i haven't seen one that says it runs on windows 7 and includes ms office mobile.
i want compatibility, which my current pda lacks, as its os and office mobile programs are outdated (even though i purchased it just before upgrading my laptop to win 7 and office 2010).
if there are no win 7 os tablets, what tablet would best sync seamless with a win7/office2010 laptop?
i want my seamless integration back!
currently i have to back up my laptop work files, backup my pda work files, then hope activesynch and win mob dev ctr are getting along.
then pray.
then i usually have to manually update files and replace files that should not have been deleted.
then once my work files are on the pda i'm forded to save them under a new name, but then i change them back to their old names.
only then will everything be properly synched, a step a few years ago would have taken minutes and i could do every day.
