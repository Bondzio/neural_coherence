i dunno, its what my case came with, i used to run 3 hard drives and 2cd drives on it, now im just running 1 HD and 2 cd drives, the hard drive is a newer ata 133 HD, it does seem to crash less since i changed hard drives, could it be my power supply ?
i looked at the ATX connector that connect to the mobo on the supply and a few of the connectors look like they burnt alittle bit or something as the plastic is orange
