1.1.1	I built a new pc - Asus P5KR , E6500 , 2gb OCZ ram , Gigabyte Nvidia 8600GTS , a sata HDD and installed windows Vista .	St
1.1.2	After running 3d applications my computer started crashing ( nvidia hardware error ) .	St
1.1.3	At some point it turned off and now ca n't be turned on .	St
1.1.4	When I turn it on it spins the fan and disks for 3 seconds and then turns off for 3 seconds .	St
1.1.5	Then it turns on again and so on - it 's a loop .	St
1.1.6	I tried using CLRTC , it does n't help and I even bought a new PSU - top of the range - it does n't help either .	St
1.1.7	A friend of mine told me that it can be something about Vista hardware attack protection , because of some nvidia-vista issues .	St
1.1.8	But what do I do now ?	Ques
1.2.1	Some more info - BIOS does not POST , I tried running the pc in minimum config - 1 stick of RAM , HDD and video card - does n't work .	St
1.3.1	http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & q=DEAD+PC	Ques
1.4.1	I 've read hudreds of articles on this topic , but none helped .	St
1.4.2	The only topic that made sense was about nvidia and vista incompatibility .	St
1.4.3	This is way I asked for help - did anyone encounter the same problem ?	Ques
1.5.1	But these articles duplicate the methods and fixes I use .	St
1.5.2	This is why I no longer write what to do anymore .	St
1.5.3	- & gt ; Back to you .	St
1.5.4	Since you think it 's a video card incompatibility issue I did n't read where you tried another card .	St
1.5.5	Why is that ?	Ques
1.5.6	And let me be blunt here .	St
1.5.7	Some owners will not change the cards and boards out to find the issue .	St
1.5.8	These owners usually take the longest to get their new systems working .	St
1.5.9	Bob	St
1.6.1	The first day when I saw the problem I went back to the shop and chaged the video card ( same model ) .	St
1.6.2	It did n't help me .	St
1.6.3	I 'll try changing the motherboard too .	St
1.7.1	Did you build it up on cardboard to sniff out case mounting issues ?	Ques
1.7.2	( yes , that 's in those articles but many do n't do that . )	Res
1.7.3	Bob	St
1.8.1	That 's what I 'm going to try next .	St
1.8.2	By the way , I just discovered that my alienware laptop has been dead for the same reaso for 3 months !	St
1.9.1	ok , so I put the MB on a piece of cardboard and tried to run in several configurations - full , only essential stuff and only CPU .	St
1.9.2	Same thing happened in all cases .	St
1.9.3	So , the MB 's dead , right ?	Ques
1.10.1	When I 'm testing I can strip it down to just the motherboard and the PSU .	St
1.10.2	This lets me power up and down which tests the smallest possible amount of parts ( 2 ) .	St
1.10.3	Next I 'll add the CPU+heatsink+fan and the SPEAKER .	St
1.10.4	It should power up and beep under protest .	St
1.10.5	This should not power down on it 's own .	St
1.10.6	- & gt ; The articles I noted detail this baby steps to sniff out where the issue is but unless you have spare parts you ca n't tell which part it is but at least you usually can work down to & quot ; it 's in these parts. & quot ; Bob	St
1.11.1	The SPEAKER does n't beep , so I guess it 's really dead	St
1.12.1	The CPU is not supported , the BIOS is not capable or supporting the CPU or there is something horribly misconfigured ( jumper on CMOS reset , etc ... ) Bob	St
1.13.1	Unlikely , as the PC was working for some time	St
1.14.1	I 've run into this with new hardware .	St
1.14.2	The owner mounted it with some extra metal stud in the wrong place .	St
1.14.3	The insulating paint wore off and what worked for awhile no longer did .	St
1.14.4	Bottom line ?	Ques
1.14.5	Start as small as possible ( 2 parts ) and work up in size .	St
1.14.6	Always use the desd pc guides .	St
1.14.7	Bob	St
1.15.1	Something strange happened - after 999th cmos reboot the pc once started .	St
1.15.2	Then - same thing .	St
1.16.1	Now the fans and disks are spinning , but the screen remains black .	St
1.16.2	But there is no single beep on start .	St
1.17.1	Be sure to leave out the video , ram when we do that test .	St
1.17.2	Bob	St
1.18.1	Ok , I bought an ATI video card .	St
1.18.2	With it the computer starts .	St
1.18.3	It beeps when there is no RAM , for example , bot it does n't do the single beep when all is ok and the screen stays black .	St
1.18.4	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.19.1	The method is to have the 2 parts to power up .	St
1.19.2	No power up and one of the two is bad .	St
1.19.3	Next we add the CPU and speaker .	St
1.19.4	No beeps = one or more of those parts is bad .	St
1.19.5	If you add another part and it fails you are looking at the bad , incompatible or horribly misconfigured parts .	St
1.19.6	What it does not tell you is exactly which .	St
1.19.7	But this method is good enough for us in the shop .	St
1.19.8	Bob	St
