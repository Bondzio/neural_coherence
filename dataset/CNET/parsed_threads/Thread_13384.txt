<s> Hi, for some weeks now, Im searching for a solution to stream live video from a wearable device (glasses, headset) to a windows system for recording. </s>
<s> Requirement is complete freedom from &lt;span dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;any LAN. </s>
<s> Most promising possibility yet seems to be the looxcie camera http://www.looxcie.com/ . </s>
<s> The android market app promisis an integration into browsers to come soon: ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.looxcie.live.android&amp;feature=more_from_developer#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEwMiwiY29tLmxvb3hjaWUubGl2ZS5hbmRyb2lkIl0 ) Currently it seems to be streaming from mobile to mobile only, though. </s>
<s> Whats interesting is that even the CIA starts to get interested in the device, as the spend a lot of money on it recently ( http://www.businessinsider.com/25-cutting-edge-companies-funded-by-the-central-intelligence-agency-2012-8?op=1 ). </s>
<s> Thanks for replies . </s>
<s> You've found a few but the problem remains about the buyer's expectations. </s>
<s> For example a few that don't know about data transfer limits want 1080p video but then are upset about the costs. </s>
<s> It's currently about 1 million and a custom job. </s>
<s> Consumer grade stuff? </s>
<s> You've seen it. </s>
<s> So my question to you is why didn't you buy it? </s>

<s> Yes, it seems definetely the best solution for an limited budget. </s>
<s> But I have seen too many companys promise future features to just believe in a statement on android market. </s>
<s> Its definitely most important to be able to watch and record the stream on a pc. </s>
<s> Wait till they deliver or use the apple iphone in the meantime. </s>
<s> I'm sure there are other solutions out there. </s>
<s> But I won't give a nod to any because I've found such to be too finicky for most. </s>
<s> That is, what happens when the device can't connect. </s>
<s> Most folk have high expectations and low budgets. </s>

<s> http://gizmodo.com/5533916/giz-explains-why-streaming-video-over-3g-sucks The multi-million buck solution I've seen used more than one 3g link (aggregation) to get enough throughput. </s>
<s> Your average Joe will not be doing that and will often whine when they try the usual off the shelf stuff. </s>
<s> -&gt; If you are smart you do the research and then move back to what works. </s>
<s> Record what you want then upload it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Youre right with your estimate. </s>
<s> Somehow it was my fault not be clear about my goals: Im no movie-maker or anything who wants hd / premium quality material to be recorded. </s>
<s> All this is just part of an experiment (university), where the viewer at the at home will be pleased when the area and persons around camera are recognizable. </s>
<s> Would you still say, in this case, that the pure data amount would be so much to just throw away the idea? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> But my background involves DVR for security systems. </s>
<s> We push video over wireless and have programmers and more to get it working. </s>
<s> I can't know if you are simply a consumer or someone that dives in and writes code and builds hardware. </s>
<s> That's why I can't give you any good news. </s>
<s> It seems you want to buy something and play with it rather than build it, program it and such. </s>
<s> Sorry if this offends you in any way. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
