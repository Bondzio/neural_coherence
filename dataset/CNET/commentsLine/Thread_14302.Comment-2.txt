from the images i can see in a google search the screen seems to be fixed at that angle.
all i could suggest is to prop it up.
place something solid under the stand at the back so it tilts forward.
the legs on the monitor itself don't look as though they will stand flat at any other angle so it might be unstable, but i can't see any other way to adjust the angle.
i don't know what ports this unit has, but if it has a spare vga port then you could try connecting another monitor and using that as your main display, but the web cam issue won't be solved.
shame.
it looks a nice, sleek model.
