1.1.1	Issue : Samsung IDE HDD 250GB Is spinning but the needle keeps going to the middle and back , over and over again ( i took it apart to see what could be wrong ) , But it 's not mounting on any PC .	St
1.1.2	I used a Double USB & gt ; Micro USB cable .	St
1.1.3	so it does have sufficient power .	St
1.1.4	( the HDD is normally in a casing , which dropped yesterday and is probably causing the issue ) Does anyone have ay idea if i can make it work again , and what is causing the issue If anyone is interested , i can upload a movie of the spinning HDD tonight so people can see what i mean .	St
1.1.5	Ty in Advance ,	St
1.2.1	Too many and none of them apply to home repair .	St
1.2.2	This is one you send to : http : //www.drivesavers.com This is not to sound cruel but the issue is well known , you could research it but if you ask that means you ca n't recover this hard drive .	St
1.2.3	Sorry I ca n't blunt this any further .	St
1.2.4	If you had the tools and skills you would n't be asking .	St

1.3.1	After investigating the Hdd i took apart , it seems the HDD Reading pins , or whatever they are called , are slightly bent .	St
1.3.2	i 'm going to try and get myself a old similar hdd and put the Hard disk in that one to see if it can still read my data .	St
1.3.3	And you 're right if i had the tools and the skills ( got skills but not much on Hardware ) i would n't be asking .	St
1.3.4	but that 's what forums are for , right !	St
1.4.1	Be sure you pay little or nothing as that no longer works in modern drives .	St
1.4.2	The reasons are out there on the net .	St
1.4.3	Forums are for asking such questions .	St
1.4.4	If someone asks one that shows they are not ready or did n't do the research then you might get a reply like mine .	St
1.4.5	I try to blunt the force or impact but sometimes I fail .	St
1.4.6	If you want your data back I strongly suggest you let drivesavers.com do the work .	St
