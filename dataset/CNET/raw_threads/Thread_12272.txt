Best case will about 50k give or take but speeds above 28800 involve both science and magic anyway. Your copper from home to the central office need to be nearly pristine and those within your home cannot be picking up induced noise from such as cordless devices, etc. If you were achieving a higher speed before the new modem, take that one back and try another. Get a decent brand and forget the generics. I have cable now but always had better luck with external modems than internal ones when using dial up...using US Robotics products.
