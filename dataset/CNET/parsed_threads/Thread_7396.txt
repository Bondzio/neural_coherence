<s> My HP 722c printer stops printing & will not complete a job with Windows XP. </s>
<s> I've updated the driver & had it confirmed on the HP website. </s>
<s> I've also reinstalled the printer several times. </s>
<s> Will appreciate any helpful suggestions. </s>
<s> Besides printer drivers, video, bios and motherboard drivers must be up to date as well. </s>
<s> If this is connected via USB, then review http://www.usbman.com for USB tips. </s>

<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
<s> My computer is a new e-machine which I would think is up to date, but please let me know. </s>
<s> The printer is connected via a parallel port. </s>

<s> Imagine one's surprise? </s>
<s> Another posted here installed some Microsoft Windows Update and immediately began to have issues. </s>
<s> They had taken the offer for a driver. </s>
<s> They didn't think much of that, so we had to go a few rounds and eventually they called Emachines. </s>
<s> The driver was rolled back. </s>
<s> This may not be your issue, but not unheard of. </s>
