had to retire a wireless adapter and an external hard drive.
checked the websites for both products and no 64 bit drivers were available.
apparently, they want to sell new equipment.
it also affected the way i download from my canon eos 10d camera.
suprisingly, canon is not supplying a driver either.
i didn't have to retire this device as the solution has been to remove the memory card and have the pc read it directly.
