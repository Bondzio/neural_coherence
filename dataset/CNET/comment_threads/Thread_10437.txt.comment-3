Ok, that makes sense.
However, is there anyway to preserve my existing state of Windows 7, as my PC being custom built I had to install a buttload of third party drivers which would be a pain to reinstall.
Does the Windows Backup feature selective backup where you can choose what to back up; I've never used it before.
Also, you think I need a 60GB?
I figured 30 should be pushing it but it would be fine right?
