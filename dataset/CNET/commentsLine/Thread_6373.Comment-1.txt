i have a compaq presario, mv540, operating system is window mil one day when i was playing a game, reading blaster, with my 4 yr old son i heard a shattering sound and the computer froze, i opened the cd drive and the cd literally shattered into hundreds of pieces and the cd rom has not worked ever since.
so i use the cd burner to run cd's.
now the cd drive will not even open.
there is nothing in the drive but i push the button and nothing happens.
any suggestions?
thanks!
