I see what you're saying about the proc, seems like a waste of money to get one that surpasses my reqs.
Any thoughts on how the Core 2 Duo E8400 Wolfdale 3.0GHz would hold up?
It seems like enough and I've heard a lot of good things about it.

As for the mobo/graphics card combo, I can see myself going sli in the future, so the p5q pro you suggested seems like a good choice.
With that extra money in mind, I could go upgrade to the gtx 260 like you suggested and spring for a better hd and ram, (any preferences on the latter?)
