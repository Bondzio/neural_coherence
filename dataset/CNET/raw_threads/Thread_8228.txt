It is connected to a Toshiba Satalie laptop. I have been wondering for a while how to fix it. It has a few issues now, and they began with some major errors in downloading a torrent to her. It was a 60 gig torrent that was interupted. So I deleted the torrent off the external. Now the external does the following Displayes delayed write error file E:\$Mfg Displayes delayed write error file E:\. Will not stop when attempting to safely remove Will not allow deletion of current files Will make it through a chkdsk, but not a chkdsk r Will not make itself available for a chkdsk d Will not open or transfer files properly When none of these are present on the system it appears to function quite normally, and will allow deletions and safe removal of the device. What can I do to fix this problem?
