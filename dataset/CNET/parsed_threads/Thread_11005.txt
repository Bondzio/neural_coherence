<s> I'm thinking of creating a home network but the more I read the more confused I'm getting. </s>
<s> First, we have four wireless phones operating at 2.4Ghz. </s>
<s> Does this rule out creating a 802.11b or 802.11g based network due to interference? </s>
<s> Second, are there operating system constraints? </s>
<s> I have a PC running on Windows ME, a laptop running Windows 98 and another PC running Windows 95. </s>
<s> I'm not thrilled with the prospect of upgrading to XP (even though I hate ME). </s>
<s> Can I find networking equipment compatible with Win95? </s>
<s> Lastly, the amount of hardware I need is probably the thing I'm most confused with. </s>
<s> My ME machine is connect to the internet via cable modem. </s>
<s> So, I need a router, yes? </s>
<s> Network interface cards in each computer? </s>
<s> Do I need an access point? </s>
<s> Is anyone familiar with powerline networks? </s>
<s> What's needed with them? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> With all those wireless phones around, not to mention any microwave ovens, it's likely interference would be an issue. </s>
<s> My opinion would be to hardwire where you can(best solution), use a combo wifi/multiported switch/router(such as http://linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=33&scid=35&prid=577 ), then WAP any dead spots with(something like this http://linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=33&scid=35&prid=575 ). </s>
<s> Operating systems are not likely an issue. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Your wireless phones and a wireless network will not interfere with each other. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> You will need a router. </s>
<s> Wireless routers on the marketing allow for wired and wireless connectivity. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> As much as I had to say it, I strongly suggest upgrading your win95 machine operating system, at least to Win98 Second Edition. </s>
<s> It will make your connectivity easier to manage. </s>
<s> You may not have the hardware requirements on your win95 machine to do a full XP upgrade. </s>
