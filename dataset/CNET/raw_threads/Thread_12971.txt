I am planning on getting an ATI 4850 or 4870 sometime in the late spring or early summer when prices would be even lower. I am trying to hold off building a new computer for another year from then (built in in October 2005 - nVidia 7800 GT, ASUS A8N-E, AMD Athlon 64 4000+, Windows XP). Would this single-core, 2.4 GHz AMD processor will act as a bottleneck when used with one of the abovementioned cards in gaming? I know that processors are not nearly as important as video cards, but I am wondering if a processor that old would be an exception to this rule... Thank you!
