<s> Hi, I'm looking to build a new PC for entertainment/media purposes, especially gaming. </s>
<s> I've pretty much specced my PC, but I'm currently looking into speakers (I don't like to use headphones). </s>
<s> Anyone have any suggestions as to which I should purchase? </s>
<s> I have had great experiences with both, but I have not had good experiences with Bose. </s>
<s> Just my 2 cents. </s>
<s> Totally agree with James, Logitech makes some really good stuff for computers, Creative as well. </s>
<s> I use a Logitech system and am well pleased plus they don't cost you an arm and a leg. </s>
<s> Their other peripherals are also excellent, keyboards and mice, joysticks etc. </s>
<s> All of my peripherals on all systems are Logitech. </s>
<s> Try out the new ambx stuff from phillips, speakers included. </s>
<s> Should add something new to your gaming rig! </s>
<s> Logitech and Creative do some good stuff, but not quite like this </s>
