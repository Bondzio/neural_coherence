when did you first start using a personal computer?
1960s (was it even a personal computer?)
1970s (what computer was it?)
1980s (what computer was it?)
1990s (what computer was it?)
2000s (what computer was it?)
just starting now (so what do you think of it?)
if you have a story behind your first personal computer use, get nostalgic and tell us all about it!
we'd love to hear about it.
