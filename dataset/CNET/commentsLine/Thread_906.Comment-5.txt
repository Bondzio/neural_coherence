but notice the first line of my post: &quot;i would like to know if anyone is using iogega's 1tb storcenter network hard drive.&quot; i would take that to mean i am looking for someone who has had first hand experience with the drive, and thus looking for answers from such a person.
regarding your question: -&gt; isn't it better to know why things are the way they are?
if i wanted to know that, i would have sepecifically asked that.
you are providing answers to questions not asked.
regarging vendors.. they are notorious for providing biased answers.. that is, if one can find the proper person to ask, and if they do answer at all.
thus my reason for looking for answers from someone with first hand experience with the product.
