1.1.1	Yesterday when I tried to print something , I got a message that the printer was not responding .	St
1.1.2	The amber screen on the printer was telling me to & quot ; Insert Cartridge & quot ; .	St
1.1.3	I have tried several things , up to and including changing all the print cartridges .	St
1.1.4	No change .	St
1.1.5	I tried to print and the printer driver returned the error message & quot ; Install Print Head & quot ; .	St
1.1.6	I did not remove anything .	St
1.1.7	I suspect that what is generating the errors is a malfunction on the part of the printer and is not user serviceable .	St
1.1.8	A quick search of the web turns up nothing specific to my printer ( Pixma MP780 ) , but some web posts do talk about replacing the print head .	St
1.1.9	How easy is this ?	Ques
1.1.10	Is the printer worth taking in for service ?	Ques
1.1.11	2009 iMac 20 & quot ; OSX 10.5.8 Thanks	St
1.2.1	It 's all about how much will it cost to fix this .	St
1.2.2	Most printers cost less than a trip to the repair counter .	St
1.2.3	If you 've expended all the usuals , read the fine manual then my advice is to make ONE call to Canon 's repair center to ask how much .	St
1.2.4	If it exceeds that of a new printer , then it 's a much easier decision .	St
1.2.5	If the printer is 24 months or older , I also say replace it .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	That 's my thinking .	St
1.3.2	I think the print head went bad .	St
1.3.3	Since I posted my query , I was able to locate and remove the print head .	St
1.3.4	I am not sure if I have it in properly , but I doubt the problem was the print head becoming & quot ; unshipped & quot ; .	St
1.3.5	There is no change in the printer 's error message .	St
1.3.6	It 's amazing how regardless of use or cost , they never seem to last more than three years .	St
1.3.7	Thanks	Polite
1.4.1	It 's not a sure thing so the problem I run into is & quot ; do you feel lucky ? & quot ; That is , how much is that print head and is it worth the risk .	St
1.4.2	I think you agreed the printer was over 2 years so even if that was it , what 's next ?	Ques
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	I 'm looking at a Canon MX 860 .	St
1.6.1	http : //reviews.cnet.com/multifunction-devices/canon-pixma-mx860/4505-3181_7-33529769.html What I want to highlight is Cnet 's claim they set it up with an Apple machine .	St
1.6.2	I like when I see that .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	I think I just finished setting it up - we 'll see .	St
