i liked the many features of the rx600 and was in dire need of a replacement for my hp g55 psc (bought in '98 and mostly still working except for paper jamming).
bought it over the net.
it does a great job scanning slides and negatives, which is a plus for me.
however: &gt;it is very slow with plain old printing, forget photographs.
&gt;there is no separate envelope feeder, you have to remove the regular paper to put in an envelope.
&gt;it is determined to feed a blank sheet between each print job.
i can't find a way to turn that off.
ideas?
&gt;the twain driver (even the new one on the web site) doesn't work, which means i can't use either the epson-supplied ocr reader or my textbridge.
this apparently has to do with a conflict with xp sp2.
&gt;currently it refuses to print page one of a ms word document which is in two columns.
don't know what that is about, it prints the other pages fine!!
(i assume i'll find a way to fix this, but it's aggravating) i miss my old h-p!!
i like to print photos, but i also have a lot of work to do that doesn't involve them.
