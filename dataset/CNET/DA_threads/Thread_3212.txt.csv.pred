1.1.1	Its my first build in awhile and im looking for some help .	St
1.1.2	I got an asus mobo with an onboard sis 180 controller and a samsung 120gb sp1213c sata hdd .	St
1.1.3	i plan on it being the only hdd .	St
1.1.4	Anyway , i tried to have cmos autodetect the drive like the install instructions said but that failed .	St
1.1.5	Continued to the sata menu where it did detect the drive there .	St
1.1.6	However when i continued to try and install xp on the drive it said no hd was detected .	St
1.1.7	Thats a quick summary of where im at now and im at a loss .	St
1.1.8	Its been some time since doing something like this , so any help on what im forgetting is much appreciated .	St
1.2.1	have SATA drivers .	St
1.2.2	These come with the MB .	St
1.2.3	You need to have these available when the XP installation asks for them .	St
1.2.4	Early on , XP will ask if you have device drivers to pre-install .	St
1.2.5	You must acknowledge that you do and what the drivers are .	St
1.2.6	They will be on the MB software/driver disk .	St
1.2.7	A bit later you will need to present the disk .	St
1.2.8	It is usually possible to extract the necessary files to a floppy and the CD that came with the MB might allow you to make them right from it .	St
1.2.9	Sometimes this requires another PC .	St
1.2.10	It can be tricky for one who has never encountered this .	St
1.2.11	The same goes for RAID drivers .	St
1.2.12	If your MB has a RAID controller , XP will see this but not install drivers .	St
1.2.13	You do this yourself .	St
1.3.1	was talking with a friend and he said something about only needing drivers if i wanted a raid configuration .	St
1.3.2	since this hd will be stand alone im not gon na need a raid setup .	St
1.3.3	he also said the hd needeto be detected in the bios , which was my original problem .	St
1.3.4	I cant seem to get it to it to autodetect and i cant put it in manually either .	St
1.3.5	anyway thnx for the help and any more info is very much appreciated .	Polite
1.4.1	because it has the necessary internal software to do so .	St
1.4.2	XP needs to see the drive through the controller .	St
1.4.3	The drivers are for the controller .	St
1.4.4	Other manufactures such as Promise and VIA make SATA and RAID controllers as well and the same applies .	St
1.4.5	XP needs the drivers for these and other devices it does not know .	St
1.4.6	There is a workaround but it 's tricky .	St
1.4.7	You can install the OS on an IDE drive and then extract the drivers easily from the MB CD .	St
1.4.8	Next you need to attach the SATA drive and clone it from the IDE drive .	St
1.4.9	Then remove the IDE drive and the SATA drive should boot .	St
1.4.10	XP will detect it as new hardware but , if it 's a new installation , there is no worry about reactivating at this point .	St
1.4.11	I have done this myself .	St
