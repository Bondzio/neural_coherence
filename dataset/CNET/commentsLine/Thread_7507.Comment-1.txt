hello: when i looked at all reviews of monitors, and i then looked at all manufacturers, i noticed that there were no reviews of iiyama monitors (i have three).
i know that they have no big footprint in the usa, but still, i believe they are quite a big manufacturer.
how come they are not included among the many, many manufacturers on the cnet list?
would anyone know?
thanks, hans l
