There was an issue long ago.
Today it can be debated if there is or not.
I won't enter into that debate but will share I do have it enabled and need it for a device I own.
I also see I can refine the google search to add the word PORT NUMBER or PORTS and see people talking about port numbers.
I purposely did not look at the maker's web site for documentation.
