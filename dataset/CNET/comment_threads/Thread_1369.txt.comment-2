Why?
Because I bought an external USB 2.0 case and used my selection of drives.
Parting hint: They don't use different model drives in those ready to use externals than what you find internally.
The downside to external is the transfer speed is slower.
Yes someone will note ESATA, but many fail to get it to work.
