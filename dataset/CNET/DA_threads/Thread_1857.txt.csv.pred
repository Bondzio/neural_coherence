1.2.1	Do you have any model information or anything we can use to identify the mouse?	St
1.2.2	When you say adaptor, what do you mean exactly?	St
1.2.3	Was it just an adaptor to work with the USB port, or was it the receiver?	St
1.2.4	If you're talking about the receiver, they don't usually sell them separately.	St
