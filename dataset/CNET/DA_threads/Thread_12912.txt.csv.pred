1.1.1	I have two monitors off a HD2400Pro and I want to install a third monitor on my system .	St
1.1.2	As I have unused PCI slots I assumed the best way to do this was install an old 7000 series PCI I had to run the third monitor .	St
1.1.3	I installed the card and on reboot Windows recognizes a Radeon 7000 series and reboots but as Windows is restarting the XP splash screen pauses for a second and the system just restarts again , now requiring safe mode or last known good config to proceed ( which of course does not properly install the 7000 ) .	St
1.1.4	When I remove the 7000 everything 's AOK and the system functions normally .	St
1.1.5	I 've updated the motherboard BIOS to the latest version , set the BIOS to initilise the PCI-E or PCI graphics first and I even moved the card into every PCI slot systematically to see if that would work , but it achieves the same result .	St
1.1.6	I have verified that the PCI card works AOK in another PC .	St
1.1.7	My system specs are : Processor : Intel Core2 Duo E8400 Mainboard : Gigabyte GA-P35-S3G with 1x PCI-E 1 , 1x PCI-E 16 and 5x PCI slots ( no onboard VGA ) Main GPU : Sapphire Radeon HD2400 PRO PSU : Seasonic 12v 500w , OS : Win XP SP2 I 'm currently using the ATi drivers that were installed with the HD2400Pro ( 8.512.0.0 ) .	St
1.1.8	I hope someone can help me or advise me about a new PCI card assuming it 's just a case that the 7000 ca n't work with drivers for the HD2400 installed .	St
1.1.9	Thanks in advance	St
1.2.1	Got the motherboard driver package right .	St
1.2.2	Can you share what version they used ?	Ques
1.2.3	And what 's in the EVENT VIEWER ?	Ques
1.3.1	I 'm not sure what to check to determine the version of the motherboard drivers , but installed them myself from the supplied DVD .	St
1.3.2	There are two errors shown in Event Viewer one is linked to & quot ; ati2mtag & quot ; Event Type :	St
1.4.1	the oldest supported gpu is the radeon 9500 .	St
1.4.2	( note , the 9250 is no longer supported either . )	St
1.4.3	your best bet is to boot into safe mode and force the card to use a standard vga driver but you 'll probably be limited to 1024x768 .	St
1.4.4	you could also add an nvidia geforce based card , but both ati and nvidia drivers are pretty fat .	St
1.4.5	if you want a new card , this x1550 is the cheapest pci card that works with the current drivers ( $ 81 ) : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814161227 this x1550 uses the pci-express x1 slot but is a bit more at $ 107 : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814161197 you could also try to find an old ati rage or mach 32 pci card .	St
1.4.6	they 're still supported by the 8.x drivers .	St
1.4.7	http : //www.geeks.com/details.asp ? invtid=ATI-RAGEXL-8M & cat=VCD	Ques
1.5.1	The I SQUARED C driver which is a motherboard driver issue looks to need work .	St
1.5.2	- & gt ; WHAT MOTHERBOARD DRIVER PACKAGE ( name , version please ) did you use ?	Ques
1.5.3	How to tell which ?	Ques
1.5.4	Fish out the DVD and look at it with explorer , right click , properties .	St
1.5.5	But given this failure I 'd go get the latest from the motherboard maker .	St
1.5.6	HOWEVER this is an INTEL CHIPSET so why not get the newest from them ?	Ques
1.5.7	Maker 's link - & gt ; http : //www.gigabyte.com.tw/Support/Motherboard/Driver_Model.aspx ? ProductID=2729 Intel 's latest - & gt ; http : //downloadcenter.intel.com/Product_Filter.aspx ? ProductID=816 Bob	Ques
1.6.1	No newer chipset drivers available .	St
1.6.2	Thank you for the suggestion .	St
1.7.1	That seems VERY new and your reply is what some Microsoft & quot ; udpate driver & quot ; would say .	St
1.7.2	Tell me exactly what date driver you are using .	St
1.8.1	Date : December 12 2007	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
1.10.1	-- & gt ; catalyst 8.x drivers do n't support radeon 7000 series the oldest supported gpu is the radeon 9500 .	St
1.10.2	( note , the 9250 is no longer supported either ) The the previous system I had the third monitor on had an X800Pro so the Catalyst drivers for that probably supported the 7000 which is why there was no issue there .	St
1.10.3	What I do n't get is how the 7000 is no longer supported but a Rage card is ! ! !	St
1.10.4	Did n't I have one of those like 10 years ago ?	Ques
1.10.5	I 'm sure of it !	St
1.10.6	-- & gt ; your best bet is to boot into safe mode and force the card to use a standard vga driver but you 'll probably be limited to 1024x768 .	St
1.10.7	The monitor is a 15-inch and will only support that resolution so that 'd work for me .	St
1.10.8	Thing is : I can get the card installed with the windows default & quot ; Video Controller ( VGA Compatible ) & quot ; mode but when I click on drivers it says : & quot ; No driver files are required or have been loaded for this device. & quot ; It even boots up in normal mode so long as it 's kept as a standard VGA and I do n't update driver to an ATi , however the monitor attached to it is n't detected and only my two other monitors show up in the Windows display properties .	St
1.10.9	The VGA adapter does n't show up in the display tab either .	St
1.10.10	Is the Standard VGA driver you refer to a physical driver in the sense it will show up as a driver in the driver properties ?	Ques
1.10.11	Is there a file somewhere I can download of find in the CABS that will show up as a physical generic VGA driver as opposed to the & quot ; phantom & quot ; default VGA driver ?	Ques
1.10.12	-- & gt ; you could also add an nvidia geforce based card , but both ati and nvidia drivers are pretty fat .	St
1.10.13	I always assumed they would interfere with each other , I may try the Rage first , should be able to pick one up for pennies .	St
1.10.14	Thanks for the help .	St
1.11.1	If you do have 2 graphics cards now i think it wont work because you have to have a crossfire-compatible motherboard and i dont think and old radeon 7000 has that .	St
1.11.2	i might be wrong but im pretty sure that 2 graphics cards cant go crossfire like that especially with one soo old	St
1.12.1	No mate , I know Crossfire is impossible in my situation , I just want to have a third monitor working independently of the other two , even it worked in 256 @ 800x600 I 'd be happy .	St
1.13.1	It 's mainly to see if we can address that I2C error .	St
1.13.2	If not then you need to get a card that is supported by drivers as noted below .	St
1.14.1	you do n't need drivers for standard vga .	St
1.14.2	it seems the video card is working but windows is refusing to use it .	St
1.14.3	have you tried switching the bios to make the pci adapter the primary/startup adapter ?	Ques
1.15.1	I focused on that since it 's something I 've dealt with before .	St
1.15.2	It 's a simple matter to get the latest Intel motherboard chipset drivers but some do n't get the connection from that to the error .	St
1.15.3	If we could get that installed then it 's crossed off the list and we look deeper at card to driver support issues like you are doing .	Sug
1.16.1	in safe mode are you ?	Ques
1.16.2	if so , try it in regular mode .	St
1.17.1	http : //64.233.169.104/search ? q=cache : EIwArxdnnocJ : www.motherboardpoint.com/t159512-ati2mtag-gives-blue-screens.html+ati2mtag+i2c & hl=en & ct=clnk & cd=4 & gl=us & client=mozilla I 'd like to see that Intel driver installed then you may have to repeat the above chore of driver ( hell ) testing .	St
1.18.1	that 's an issue with the ati drivers , not necessarily the motherboard drivers .	St
1.18.2	the 8.x catalyst drivers do not support the radeon 7000 so that error from when he was trying to apply those drivers to that card .	St
1.19.1	The motherboard drivers tell the drivers how to do that .	St
1.19.2	It 's a small step along the way .	St
1.20.1	It 's also showing two instances of a new error Event Type :	St
1.21.1	( with an unsigned driver 6.14.10.6517 ) and it 's even configurable in Catalylst Control .	St
1.21.2	The I2C error is still appearing in even viewer but is not halting or restarting the system which makes me think it was the other error that was doing that .	St
1.21.3	I do have 2 instance of a new error related to ati2mtag : Event Type :	St
1.22.1	It altered nothing apart from showing the post and BIOS screens in the third monitor but once it booted into windows the primary display adapter ( the HD2400 ) took over .	St
1.22.2	The properties of the & quot ; VGA Compatible & quot ; remained unchanged .	St
1.23.1	I just had the one .	St
1.23.2	The ATi driver gets swiched off anyway once in safe mode and you 're left with basic functionality .	St
1.24.1	Sorry but CPLIB is something of an ATI driver bugaboo .	St
1.24.2	I 've cured this but it 's not nearly so easy .	St
1.24.3	I have to wipe the drivers , install a version , try , if not go down a version ( wipe , install , test ) till I get it .	St
1.24.4	I think you cleared up one error at least .	St
1.24.5	Bob	St
1.25.1	Sorry , I should have been clearer , I still have the I2c and 2 CPLIB errors so that 's 3 errors in total .	St
1.25.2	The I2C is still attached to ati2mag but it does n't seem to effect either adapter in any way I can discern .	St
1.25.3	It 's not preventing the system from starting normally : Event Type :	St
1.26.1	What I learned a long time ago was that I ca n't just install video drivers .	St
1.26.2	I had to clean them out then install ONE version .	St
1.26.3	Otherwise some silly piece is left behind and does & quot ; that. & quot ; If it works , move on .	St
1.26.4	Bob	St
1.27.1	Many thanks to you Bob and those who helped a distraught Irishman with his problem .	Polite
1.27.2	I 'm gon na quit while I 'm ahead with 2 working graphics cards and let those non-intrusive event errors alone .	St
1.27.3	Many thanks again .	Polite
