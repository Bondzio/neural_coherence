About once or twice a day I see my wireless connection bar go down and down until I totally get kicked off my network. The only way to fix it is to run upstairs and unplug the router and plug it back in. This works until I have to go do it again, and again, and again. There our some wireless networks around me and every time I get kicked off there is a new wireless network that I don't usual see. Is it possible that this person and my network our on the same channel and when they get on I get kicked off? I have tried going into the router settings and change the channel but that didn't seem to do the trick. Anyone else have any ideas? Thanks!

Some routers seem to have problems when I turn on NAT filtering or &quot;other.&quot; Please start telling all. It is too much work for me to ask every detail. This is not tech support but you and I discussing it. Just like non-paid support, you have to get out and push. Bob

Not that it's too far from the clients (how far?) but I found a router buried under books and it was simply overheating. Try moving it so that all the bigger sides are exposed to air so it's a little cooler. I take it that you power cycled the router... -&gt; Sadly it looks like the router needs to be swapped out at this point. Sometimes the firmware version matters. Since you are not sharing details I can't look into that issue. Bob
