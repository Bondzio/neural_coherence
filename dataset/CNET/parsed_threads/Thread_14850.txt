<s> I have a Lacie 160 Firewire hard drive that is about 4 years old. </s>
<s> For some reason the upper firewire connection will not work. </s>
<s> The computer does not recoginize the drive although it does cause the hard drive to start. </s>
<s> The lower conection works fine. </s>
<s> Does anyone know if the upper connection can be relplaced? </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> Tech time is around 100+ an hour around here. </s>
<s> Even finding the parts alone could cost more than a nice new case. </s>
