1.1.3	I live in a country where there is no online shopping or stuff like that so that 's out of the question .	St

1.2.1	Order from newegg.com , compgeeks.com and will pick up a low price drive .	St
1.2.2	DVDROM drives are commodity items and the important item appears to be the bundled DVD player software .	St
