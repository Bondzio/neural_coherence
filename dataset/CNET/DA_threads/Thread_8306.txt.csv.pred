1.1.1	I work for a school district and am trying to fix a problem with an Acer AL1715 monitor.	St
1.1.2	The monitor works when I boot the computer in safe mode; however, when I boot in regular mode, the monitor turns off and gives me the message &quot;input not supported&quot;.	St
1.1.3	I have searched help forums online pertaining to this issue, and have found a variety of solutions.	St
1.1.4	One suggested that I may need to change the screen resolution in safe mode, then reboot, and the problem should be fixed.	St
1.1.5	I did just that, but as soon as I applied a change in screen resolution, the computer automatically adjusted and changed the resolution back.	St
1.1.6	I could not find the driver disk for the monitor, so I looked online for a driver of this particular model.	St
1.1.7	I found one, but when I went to install it, I got a message that said there was no hardware on the computer that matched this driver.	St
1.1.8	I also tried to find a driver for the Intel graphics card, so I could reinstall it, but the mirror sites listed on the Intel website no longer contained the driver I needed.	St
1.1.9	I have tried these few things I have mentioned; however, I find it hard to believe that there would be either a driver issue or hardware issue.	St
1.1.10	Probably no driver issue, because the teacher was able to use the monitor a few days ago (she also uses a y-splitter cable to display the screen through a projector).	St
1.1.11	I find it also unlikely that it is a hardware issue, because I can use the monitor in safe-mode.	St
1.1.12	Any suggestion are greatly appreciated!	St
1.1.13	Thanks!	St

1.2.1	While in safe mode set the video mode to 800x600 and 60Hz so when you reboot it might work.	St
1.2.2	Then you can test other modes.	St
