11216	0	203246	2175598	nr	lewmary	9/2/06 9:27 pm	1.15723242e12	generic printer ink	would you suggest buying generic printer ink rather than the company ink that costs 5x the price? i'm weary of doing this because a friend of mine blames generic ink for breaking his epson... suggestions and opinions? thank you.
11216	1	203246	2175844	2175598	willy	9/3/06 1:59 am	1.15724874e12	ok by me	epson printers on thier own are a pita. they tend to be problematic with any inks even thier own. as for any other printer out there, using generic inks is ok but you are at the mercy of that &quot;quality&quot; of inks used. simply put, cheap ink is cheap ink. i suggest you buy at least from a offcie outlet store like staples, officemax, wal-mart, etc. and enjoy some saving. if you plan to refill your own, then buy from a reputable ink refill source, etc.. rememeber, usually the only recourse any refill outlet provides is to replace inks/refilled carts for free if you have problems and they agree to. i buy store refills all the time and rarely have problems, however i don't use epson printers, i repaired too many to find them on my desk at home. tada -----willy

11216	4	203246	2186163	2175598	gnasher	9/8/06 2:54 am	1.15768404e12	look at the costs of the whole package	i use generic ink in my epson printer. the economics are simple. the printer itself is now dirt cheap. the expected operational life without breakdown of modern inkjet printers seems to be about two years. (my current one is 3 years old but has not printed in colour, only black and white for the past 18 months - and will not work at all unless i replace the colour cartridges on a regular basis, no idea where all that ink goes to, but definitely not onto any paper). you can use cheap ink and throw the printer away after two years, or use extortionately expensive ink and throw it away after three. even if you have to throw it away after one year the savings on the cheaper ink are greater than the cost of the new printer. for some reason epson printers suffer from clogged nozzles more than other brands, particularly if you don't use them every day. on my last one even the drastic windex treatment failed. incidentally i have a 10 year old hp deskjet 500 used once a month or less, and it always works first time without fail. the quality of the print is not as good as on more recent models, but it never fails to deliver what it always did.
11216	5	203246	2186170	2175598	bpglenn	9/8/06 3:00 am	1.1576844e12	generic or bulk printer ink	define generic printer ink. the ink sold to be used in all printers should be avoided. but if you buy bulk ink intended for your printer from a reliable vender that also has good suppurt such as  then you should be okay. i have refilled my canon ink jet cartridges so many times i've lost count. you have to be willing to learn how to refill the cartidges. once you leara how you should have no problems. my epson printer has cartridges that require a device to reset factory cartridges and the cartridges are designed in such a way that the ink takes about 24 hours to work. this is where a vendor with good support helps. follow the directions from the vendor methodically. cover the work area with lot of newspaper, have paper towels, etc. available. refill the cartridges before they go dry. i keep a set of full cartridges ready to put into my printer and then refill the ones i take out immediately. i get great results and beautiful photo prints. i could not afford to make aa many photos if i had to pay for the printer company cartridges. printer are fairly inexpensive because the companies know they'll make huge printer with their cartridges. glenn h.

11216	11	203246	2186330	2175598	lotusheart	9/8/06 5:27 am	1.15769322e12	generic ink okay	i regularly print color manuals for a holistic health practice. if i use company inks, it would cost me $40 per manual. i use generic inks and drop the cost down to about $4. regular deep cleaning through the printer maintenance routine keeps things chugging along... previously i owned and used epsons, but got tired of the problems and switched to canon. i just spent $50 after two years to replace the print head, bringing it back to new status. it is against the law, my understanding, for a company to try and void the warranty on a printer because you use generic ink. i also print a lot of photos, and find the generics work just fine. i guess we all have different levels of discernment.

11216	14	203246	2186396	2186163	bpglenn	9/8/06 6:10 am	1.1576958e12	(nt) unclogging cartridge nozzles	windex is the gentle method. if drastic method is used by the companies that recycle cartridges. they use boiling water and it will usually work. pour the boiling water into a container big and deep enough to immerse the ink jets or print head. hold it under water for several minutes until you see ink in the water. you may have to do this two or three times and you may have to squeese the cartridge. once you are getting ink out of the cartridge wipe everything dry with a paper towel and then top of the ink. to get the ink flowing in your printer print out one of these pages:   if the print head is is not in the cartridge you may have to clean it separately. glenn
11216	15	203246	2186478	2175598	walterose	9/8/06 6:19 am	1.15769634e12	the art of cartridge refilling	i have been refilling my ink cartridges for four years. i used it for a couple years on an old lexmark z52 and now on a dell a960 (same manufacturer). true, useing good ink is important and good advice. i have done well with universal - color fast. a few years back i tried another brand that entered my syringe as a jell. needless to say i droped them quickly. i would suggest that if you have pretty much emptied the cartridge before refilling wick the ink through the heads as you slowly refill. this will get the ink flowing around any air bubbles that can block the inks flow. use papertowel as it wicks more slowly than toilet paper which wicks too quickly and can be dusty (paper dust). i have saved thousands in replacement cartridge costs. i replace cartridges once to twice per year, sometimes more. at one time when my work flow was greater i was refilling three to four times per month. for me, there is no better way. howard

11216	17	203246	2186502	2175598	lhathorn	9/8/06 6:40 am	1.1576976e12	great	i have owned many, many ink jet printers, including canon (favorite), brother, epson, compaq, hp, and lexmark. i always replenish my supply with generic ink. i order from a couple of on-line sources, and the quality of the ink matches brand name. i have never had problems with the ink destroying my printers. consider, however, that not all inks are the same. once, i purchased ink from the shelves of a local discount store at an unbelievably low price. the results were unbelievable too. colored water doesn't work.
11216	18	203246	2186531	2175598	rochagomes	9/8/06 6:47 am	1.15769802e12	generic printer ink	i agree with most of the posted messages, generic printer ink has too much of a cost savings, ($2.50-4.00 vs $ 11.00-$12.00 for cannon tanks. the cannon printers (i.e s500) that use the individual tanks, no printer nozzles. by generic i mean the ones you purchase off the web from these ink sites, which do not identify any manufacturer on the box or on the cartridge. for text and most printing purposes they are ok, colors are a little off but for everyday, at home use this is not an issue. i do believe they tend to dried up on the print-heads more often than oems but i just use a damp cotton swab or cycling through mulitple clean nozzle cycles. for pictures or any graphics that you require good to perfect results, i can not vouch for them. i know consumers reports does not recommend them for pictures, and suggested text-only if you want to use them.
