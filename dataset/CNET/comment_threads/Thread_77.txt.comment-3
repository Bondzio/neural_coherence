That will move your new post to the left edge and let the thread continue for the same number of detents.
[it's a confusing message].
For the first post like this some put something in the Subject line that refers to the post that they are now referring to, so that everyone will realize that it is not a reply to the original post..
They can lock a thread but the Moderators only do that when it gets out of hand with nasty comments or such.
Usually only happens in the Speakeasy forum.
