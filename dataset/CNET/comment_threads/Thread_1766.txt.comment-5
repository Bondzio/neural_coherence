The 7800GS and 7600GS are fully compatible with Inventor.
Autodesk Inventor requirements are simply &quot;128+ MB DirectX or OpenGL Capable graphics card&quot;.
All geForce 7xxx are fully backward compatible with geForce 6xxx.
Video card manufacturers typically don't spend the money to certify consumer cards for professional CAD use since they sell professional CAD cards based on the same GPUs.
The 7600GS is faster than a 6600GT in practically all benchmarks including Oblivion.
http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i=2746&p=6 http://www.digital-daily.com/video/7600GS/index04.htm Oblivion generally plays better on ATI cards, but ATI only offers an x1600pro in AGP.
The x1600pro is slower than the 7600gs even in Oblivion.
