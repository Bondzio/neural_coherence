the extra charge for the additional computer occurs only when you install another cable modem in a different room.
two modems, two ip addresses, but maybe not twice the usage (sort of like husband and wife having two cars on the same insurance policy... premium is higher than one car, but not twice as high...).
your proposed setup of one cable modem and internal networking (whether wired or wireless) is only one connection to cox.
therefore only one charge.
what you do with it behind the cable modem is not a business concern of cox.
