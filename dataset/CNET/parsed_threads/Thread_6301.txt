<s> I had a SCSI scanner installed in my old computer but don't see a port I could use to plug it into on my new computer. </s>
<s> My current computer is a Dell model 4700 P-4 with Win XP Home operating system with 512 Ram. </s>
<s> Is there any type adapter that would allow me to use a PCI card slot for a SCSI scanner? </s>
<s> As you can see I'm not all that knowledgeable so if my question is ridiculous try not to laugh. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> We only had one person in 3 years insist on doing that. </s>
<s> We used a new PCI SCSI adaptor and paid for new HP drivers. </s>
<s> I'd leave it on the machine that it works with. </s>

<s> Thank you for the answer, your answer has made my decision for me. </s>
<s> I will take your advice and purchase a new USB scanner </s>
<s> Check AxionTech.com for a used adaptec controller </s>
