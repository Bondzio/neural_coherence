Thanks for the reply, how about I move partition 3 past the unallocated so the unallocated is inbetween partition 2 and 3.
Then give the space to partition 2.
Are there any other programs I could use to do this?
or is partition magic pretty reliable ?
Any further help and advise will be gratefully appreciated.
Thanks.
