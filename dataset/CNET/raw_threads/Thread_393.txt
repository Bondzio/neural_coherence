Previously tried: changing graphics card for a new one had ram tested reinstalled w7 64-bit ran core temp with normal temps recorded throughout, (but I dont think it records temps at the precise moment of bsod) Mainboard : MSI 870-G45 (MS-7599) Chipset : AMD 770/870 Processor : AMD Phenom II X4 840 @ 3200 MHz Physical Memory : 8192 MB (2 x 4096 DDR3-SDRAM ) Video Card : NVIDIA GeForce 8600 GT Hard Disk : HDS722516VLSA80 ATA Device (165GB) Hard Disk : OCZ-VERTEX2 ATA Device (115GB) DVD-Rom Drive : Optiarc DVD RW AD-5280S Network Card : Attansic (Now owned by Atheros) AR8131 PCIe Gigabit Ethernet Controller Ace A-500BR power supply Any help appreciated Dumps attached https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9mlFIkm4S4wUEFJb0hGeGNMMFU/edit

If yiou can tell those, tht would be nice. Is that nVidia 8600 the old card or the new one you replaced it with? And why did you think the video was the cause? Did those crashes happen only during games or some reason like that? Kees

There are folk that use dumps and such but you won't find me looking at them when you spot the usual failing card. I rip the card out and try another. This is not to say that's it but given the clues it's my next move. -&gt; I can't see the PC so I can't see how clean it is. That is, we also see this with clogged heatsinks and old heat sink compound. If anything is over 2 years old we pull all the heatsinks (one at a time) to wipe off the old and apply new compound. I'm sure you know this drill. Bob

I sent reports to them but they can't figure it out. Works fine web browsing etc. So I swapped out the 8600 graphics card for a new GeForce GT630, but the problem remains. Its either BSOD or 'Poker app has encountered a problem and needs to close'. As for the first part of your question &quot;All that might be interesting from that dumps: the error code, like 0x000000A2 and such. If you can tell those, tht would be nice&quot;. - I'm not sure what you mean here, do you require more info? The attached dumps have the error codes listed do they not? Thanks again. Not really sure where to go from here. Where do I start with these codes/dumps?

Thanks for taking the time to reply I swapped out the 8600 graphics card for a new GeForce GT630, but the problem remains. Its either BSOD or 'Poker app has encountered a problem and needs to close'. (I'm a semi-pro Poker player) I thought video was the cause, as at times the screen went all glitchy, + the problem arises ONLY when I play the Poker client pkr.com and run HoldemManager (postgres database manager) simultaneously or independently. I sent reports to them but they can't figure it out. Works fine web browsing etc. So as you say, I ripped it out and tried another. Heatsink - I never really though of cleaning them up. I ran core temp, but temps were normal throughout checking back through the logs. (having said that would core temp record a sudden spike?). Don't know what to do for the best Bob. Just start replacing other parts and save all this hassle? If ram is fine, graphics card is new, what left just processor, power supply and motherboard? I take it ntoskrnl.exe is a very generic term and could lead to any of those above components failing.

OK, let's be sure the heat sink is clean and if it's been a few years since the compound was replaced, do that. I know it's hard on folk to look at the CPU and such temps and do the work but it's cheap and has paid off too many times. -&gt; But there is something else to try (as always) and that is to (google this) Disable Flash Hardware Acceleration. Just in case. If we don't see any improvement then you remove any SSDD and try a normal HDD. Bob

But in any case: 0x0000007f - UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP 0x0000000a - IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL 0x00000050 - PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA
