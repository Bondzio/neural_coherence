i have a sony computer(it is not the greatest computer).
i want to install a second internal hard drive.
the sony techs i contacted told me that it was dangerous to do so and sony does not recommend anyone doing it.
i wanted to know if i should take their advice?
i wanted to install an internal drive instead of an external drive because i heard that the external drives are slower.
i am a novice at computers.
i have never installed anything before.
i don't want to try installing one if i could damage the computer.
i don't have the money to replace it.
any advice will be greatly appreciated.
