<s> There used to be a large difference between routers but they have become very standard and there are few difference in the basic features. </s>
<s> On the power and range issue they are pretty much the same. </s>
<s> The maximum transmission power is limited by the government so this also limits the range. </s>
<s> This means that most routers will get exactly the same coverage. </s>
<s> All the other features is why there are so many routers. </s>
<s> In general I would stay with a larger manufacture just so you can get help from others who have similar routers but that still leave a lot of choice. </s>
<s> If you can afford it I would buy a DUAL band router since those are the most flexible. </s>
<s> At least buy a N router since they only cost slightly more than G and support both N and G. Last I would look for a router that has external antenna that can be removed and upgraded. </s>
<s> Many people find these routers ugly but putting larger antenna on is the only way to increase the coverage of a router. </s>
<s> Some countries it is not legal to put larger antenna on the router. </s>
<s> The other difference between routers are feature you must decide if you need. </s>
<s> Some people need VPN and others need firewall features to limit their children surfing so its very hard to make a general recommendation. </s>
<s> say me the best router model to buy not n and g i confuse say me the model plz give me a model which has great range than other routers it shuld have maximum range and speed i shuld be happy give that type of router model the range should be very far beacuse i saty at ground floor and i want to use in first floor and second floor so plz pick me a excellent router model plz pick a new one and amazing router say model plz </s>
