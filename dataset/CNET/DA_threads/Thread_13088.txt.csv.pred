1.1.1	Hi I am asking for help for purchasing a compact printer.	St
1.1.2	The saleman recommended a hp photosmart A716,but I was wondering about the Canon Pixma Mini260 or the Epson compact photo-printers.	St
1.1.3	Any advise would be greatly appreciated as I did buy the HP A716, but I have not opened it thinking it was not the right choice.	St
1.1.4	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	I almost picked up one until I calculated the per print price.	St
1.2.2	For me the at home print convenience didn't make the cut to add one of these printers.	St
1.2.3	Check out the CNet reviews and note the per copy print costs to help you decide.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
