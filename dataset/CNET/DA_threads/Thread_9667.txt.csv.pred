1.1.1	Hey everyone.	St
1.1.2	I have a Compaq Presario 5102US that will be 3 years old in september.	St
1.1.3	I have Windows XP Professional as the operating system.	St
1.1.4	About 2 weeks ago I had to repair windows xp and everything's back to normal.	St
1.1.5	But now, and even before I had to repair it, the computer would just restart itself and it's really annoying.	St
1.1.6	It can be just sitting there, without me doing anything on it or while being on it and it just restarts.	St
1.1.7	Also, sometimes when it's loading up, it gets to my wallpaper and then restarts again.	St
1.1.8	Can someone PLEASE help me??	St
1.1.9	It is very annoying to have my pc just restart out of nowhere, especially when I'm running my Ad-aware, AVG and things to keep it from having viruses, spyware and such.	St
1.2.1	Besides my reply in the XP forum, review the bad capacitor issue noted at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6127-0.html?forumID=9&threadID=29524&messageID=335670 and see if this is your issue.	St

1.3.1	Make sure that you test out your memory, I have had Win XP do the same thing with a bad memory module.	St
1.3.2	Especially if you have two or more modules.	St
1.3.3	The timimg cycle has to be exact or it causes a reboot,I have found.	St
1.3.4	The machine of mine would run ok on either module, but not the two at the same time.	St

1.4.1	Take the side panels off and try running it to see if it may be heat related.	St
1.4.2	I usually place a big floor fan beside the open box and blow air through it.	St
1.4.3	If you find it doesn't re-boot or as often, then replace your case fans or add some more and consider that after 3 years some components may be getting weaker and more susceptible to heat issues.	St
1.4.4	I'd also suggest you start a routine backup procedure.	Sug
1.5.1	I'm unsure which discussion is live or dead.	St
1.5.2	The original poster appears to have some 6 or more posts about this and I can see why they may just fade away.	St
