i don't really know about standalone lcds, but the one on my laptop has a really nice 1680x1050, a widescreen resolution.
quite seriously, once you've tried widescreen displays you'll never want to go back.
i've also done a fair bit of gaming on this machine and i've never found the response rate of the display to be a problem.
in particular, i've found that half-life two plays a dream, and although it would be nice if the display had a refresh rate of greater than 60hz, the difference is barely noticable.
anyway, that's just specific to my display, and overall, i can say that if you shop around well, as you seem to already have done, then you won't be disappointed.
