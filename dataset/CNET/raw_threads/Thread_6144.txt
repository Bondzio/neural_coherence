It is 16GB Gskill RipjawsX 1600Mhz, with 10-10-10-30 timing. I installed it, set proper timings and speed in BIOS, and after a few minutes of work, I got BSOD. When I restarted my PC, it said it could not load my graphic card drivers. I downloaded newest one from nVidia site, I thought it might be a problem because I was using beta drivers. But the same thing happen. I went and reset speed and timings to auto, which is 1333Mhz, 9-9-9-24, and since then it is working properly, which is some 2-3 hours. I was hoping someone can help me with this problem. Anyway, my configuration is: AMD FX-8320 3.5Ghz Gigabyte 990FXA-UD3 nVidia GeForce GTX480 WD 1TB HD.

Even, if the ram is capable the other half is the mtrbd., etc. to keep pace. If you hadn't yet, look into the bios update level. if it has moved beyond your current level, it's a good bet it handles ram better. It's worth the upgrade provided it addresses ram issues. The mere fact you set the ram level manually says it needs help. As already post to you, up the voltage, .01 until its happy. Allow to work with higher voltage but don't push it. If you install in *ALL* ram slots, timing can be a critical issue long posted for yrs. as a critical factor for ram. A good check is to view the ram status response using PCWizard 2012 and read that all ram is actually the same, regardless of what the sticker states on ram itself. Google for PCWizard to install it. tada -----Willy

I tried reinstalling my old RAM, and I also got BSOD while trying to download GW2.I ran memtest and it came back with approx. 7k errors. I ran memtest with new RAM and I got 40k errors on first pass. The BSOD I was getting before was irql_not_less_or_equal, now I am getting pfn_list_corrupt stop 0x0000004e. Also, my computer would work for hour or two, but as soon as I would try to download something (the only thing I actually tried downloading was GW2) it would get BSOD.

Further, you state now you have errors during tests, so you basically know there's a problem. That should have all been posted in the 1st post, so answers can get to the point. Now, from POV there's really nothing that can be done because it relies on the mtrbd. to be fixed or patched. As i stated, if a bios level is behind, do that as a last resort. You clean out the ram slots as well with alcohol and toothbrush, allow to dry and then retry ram. if the problem persists, it maybe better to get a mtrbd. replacement. Since this also happens with old ram too. You should also look for &quot;bad caps&quot;, even a minor weak cap with cause issues, plus a PSU swap to check as a stable power test. Otherwise, you're left with a mtrbd. problem if nothing seems to fix it. I would do a tear down place on cardboard and test that way, one item at a time for basic or minimum system. because it works and then BSOD when you try to d/l suggest that really you're in a ram stack that hasn't been reached yet, so effectively you enter a ram area and then &quot;poof&quot;. You're hitting whatever is causing ram issue. tada ------Willy
