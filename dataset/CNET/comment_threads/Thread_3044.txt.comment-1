My son recently gave me his computer and i am cvery happy and very grateful,however there is one problem.
the hard drive (c) is absolutely full of dross i.e.
bits of uninstalled programs and such like.
i have used registry mechanic and although it reports that i have 468 errors on my drive it will only repair 29 of them,as have a few others i have tried, therefore my question is this, can anyone recommend a good free program that will actually repair the errors as well as finding them?
thank you for taking the time to read this, and for any help you may offer
