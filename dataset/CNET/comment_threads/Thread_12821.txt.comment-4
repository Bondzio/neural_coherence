Can you provide us more info?
And what do you mean by &quot;...I have also built this PC in June so keep that in mind&quot; Hard drive connector?
Are you referring to an external drive with an USB?
Anyways, I agree with R. Proffitt, make sure your primary (boot) drive is connected to 0 or 1 (lowest SATA ports).
