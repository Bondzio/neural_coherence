<s> Hello all, I recently built a new machine, basically from scratch. </s>
<s> I have been running it for only a week or two, so far and last night I happened to notice that the CPU was touching around 50 degrees C. I remember reading in the manual that it took a good number of processing hours for the heatsink and thermal compound to reach maximum efficiency, but I have to say, I am still a little nervous about letting my CPU get above 50C. </s>
<s> Now, keep in mind that I am not an overclocker, nor do I wish to be. </s>
<s> My new CPU is an AMD Athlon 64 X2, 5200+ and Socket AM2. </s>
<s> I am looking for plausible suggestion for cooling within an already well-ventilated case. </s>
<s> I use a Lian-Li PC-60USB B2, with two front panel fans, one back panel fan and a top panel exhaust fan. </s>
<s> The proprietary fans for the CPU and the videocard are installed. </s>
<s> Any helpful replies will be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks, Eric </s>
<s> Visit the AMD cpu support website. </s>
<s> You will find what is the temp. </s>
<s> range the cpu can handle. </s>
<s> Overall, at 50C, I see no harm, but check the website regradless for your cpu model. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>

<s> Is the 50c at idle or under load </s>
<s> Thanks for the links, Willy. </s>
<s> I'll check out the docs and see if I can find the normal operating temps. </s>
<s> VAP, I am using a program called EasyTuner that came along with my Gigabyte mobo to measure RPM/Temp. </s>
<s> Max operating temperature (C) 55 - 70 The above is what I was able to track down for my particular CPU. </s>
<s> When I was watching it on the EasyTuner app last night, I saw that it was hovering right around 48 - 50 C. This was after the machine had been up and running for a while. </s>
<s> I had been playing games and running applications for probably a few hours. </s>
<s> I guess it is still within it's safety zone. </s>
<s> If anyone has a better suggestion for an app to measure stats, I'd be grateful. </s>
<s> let us know what that says. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS I've got a an AMD 4800 X2 and it isn't anywhere near that hot....it runs under 30c (28c now) at idle with the AMDs stock HS fan. </s>
<s> Ambient temp is 70F </s>
<s> Actually from what I have read at Intel.. Tempature flucuations are more dangerous than some warmer than normal temp. </s>
<s> reading.. </s>
<s> I would go with a steady as she goes tempature reading.. and not create a PC-environment that caused cold air to suddenly hit the machine surfaces.. </s>
<s> I have had had High Heat Flags run on my Machine and nothing ever happened..this was with a Celeron D[331]2.66GHz CPU..I replaced that CPU w/P4[531]3.0GHz..and of course things run exactly so.. .. Video Rendering is CPU intensive..w/P4 I have no issues. </s>
