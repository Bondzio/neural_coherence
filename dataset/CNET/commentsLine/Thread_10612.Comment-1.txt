i am looking for something under $80.
i am also looking to have it completely wireless.
i am trying to boost my signal from my bedroom to my living room, so obviously i dont want to have to wire a ethernet cable from on end of my house to another... do i need a new antenna?
extender?
acess point?
there are so many options!
please reccomend a specific product.
