I want to upgrade my processor to one with hyper threading technology but I'm not sure if I can. Sony's answer to me is they cannot support a processer upgrade. Does anyone know if this is possible? Is there a limit to the speed of the processor I can upgrade too? I have 400Mhz system bus. Thanks

It is my understanding that you cannot use a prossesor with more than 400 fsb. I checked with asus web site as mine has a asus mobo. That limits the prossesor to a 2.8 gi,400 fsb and no hyperthreading Newegg has them for $168. I have consitered putting in a new motherboard but that involves several problems. First the power suppy on my VAIO case is in the middle, I don't know if this makes it a propriatory Mobo but it may cause some problems with fit. Second, if I put a new mobo and prosesor in I will not be able to use my vaio system recovery disc witch includes my operating system so I would have to buy a new copy of XP. I hope this helps.
