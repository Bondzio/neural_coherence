<s> guys, I have a question, can a HDD hard disk designed for windows 98 be compatible to a windows 7 pc? </s>
<s> I will put this HD hard disk as secondary hard drive is it ok? </s>
<s> HDD interface. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I don't know of any hard disk that was designed for Windows 98. </s>
<s> Are you wanting to put a hard disk with Win 98 installed on the same PC as one with Win 7? </s>
<s> Well, Win 7 would be able to see and read from it but you'd probably not be able to run Win 98 on the same machine. </s>
<s> The primary reason is that the amount of RAM needed to run Win 7 would choke Win 98. </s>
<s> Are we close to answering you here? </s>
<s> All HDs will work provided there is no fault present. </s>
<s> Further, understand small older HDs may not be desired not because of OS format but rather it needs juice from PSU by being present. </s>
<s> Thus, I won't install an old HD that's smaller than 20gb in size to be practical, IMHO. </s>
<s> If you want to use a smaller HD like say 10gb, etc. </s>
<s> mount it in the proper ext. </s>
<s> case and use it as ext. </s>
<s> HD. </s>
<s> Seriously consider that you think using a &quot;flash drive&quot; as these are very capable and come easily in 4-16gb capacity. </s>
<s> Of course, you have to prepare any old HD for use and in most cases that FAT32 or NTSF. </s>
<s> This is a generic answer and you didn't state what size old HD you're inquiring about. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> First a hd is not designed for an OS.....it's just a storage device and could not give a hoot what OS or data you put on it. </s>
<s> The maybe part. </s>
<s> Hd's from the w98 era were PATA. </s>
<s> Hd's from the win7 era are SATA. </s>
<s> The cables and plugs are different. </s>
<s> So a quick eye-ball of the old hd connectors and the connectors available in the machine might be of value. </s>
