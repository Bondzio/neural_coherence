yes, only ota cards seem to be available right now.
the question really is if i have an hd tuner from my cable provider (comcast) and just rout the decoded output to my tv tuner card in my mc, will it be able to handle it and push it to the graphics card, an ati radeon x600, and then render it on my monitor, a 19 inch lcd that should have more than enough resolution?
