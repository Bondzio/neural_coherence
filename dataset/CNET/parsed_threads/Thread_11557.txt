<s> So far until today, I've had good luck being a cheapskate and buying expired genuine Epson ink cartridges up to a year past the &quot;use before&quot; date. </s>
<s> Today though, I tried two black ink cartridges that have a &quot;use before&quot; 7/2004 date and no black ink comes out of them. </s>
<s> The black ink light though does not illuminate on my Epson Stylus Color 600 printer. </s>
<s> I used the cleaning feature 2 times and still no black ink coming out. </s>
<s> I wonder why the black ink light doesn't come on? </s>
<s> It always does when there is no ink left. </s>
<s> Will running the cleaning cycle 10 times help or did the ink dry up in the hermetically sealed cartridge? </s>
<s> What has been your luck with expired ink cartridges? </s>
<s> I guess the ink and sponge dried out. </s>
<s> Dont even try it. </s>
<s> The &quot;optium&quot; usage of any inks is to be within its &quot;use by&quot; period. </s>
<s> While the degrading levels can differ it's just a warning to use by and prolonged usage of such inks can only lead to a final gasp. </s>
<s> However, since using Epson or anyone else's ink brand can cause similar results sooner or later as Epson prtheads will clog. </s>
<s> The sad fact is, clearing clogged Epson prthead isn't as easy or quickly resolved by replacing the prthead by a user, so &quot;cleaing cycles&quot; are the best approach and repeated cleaning is a must. </s>
<s> That uses alot of ink and the expense can be high. </s>
<s> I suggest you find a vendor that sells a &quot;cleaning cartridge&quot; which contains some cleaner or solvents that can handle stubborn clogs as the cheapest solution, otherwise repair is too costly, just replace the printer. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
