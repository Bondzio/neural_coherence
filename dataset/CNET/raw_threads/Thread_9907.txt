I'm currently buying a new PC and I would like to know which of the two options gives me more performance. A single 750GB 7200 rpm speed, SATA 3Gb/s hard drive or two 320GB 7200 rpm speed, SATA hard drives in RAID 0. There is no specification for the 320GB drive, so I'm assuming its 1.5GB/s. Which of the two options will give me a better performance? Or will there be barely any difference? Thanks!

In fact a 3.0G drive benchmarked not much faster when we jumpered it down to 1.5 or connected it to a 1.5G interface. Test then decide. Bob
