1.1.1	On Saturday , I had Comcast High Speed Internet installed in my apartment .	St
1.1.2	The modem I was given is a Motorola SURFboard SB5120 Series , connected to my system via Ethernet .	St
1.1.3	A few hours after the installation , I headed out to Best Buy and purchased the Linksys Wireless-G Broadband Router , Model No .	St
1.1.4	WRT54GP2A-AT .	St
1.1.5	This went with this router specifically for its VoIP capabilities with AT & T CallVantage .	St
1.1.6	After a weekend of tinkering , I 've yet to be able to get it working .	St
1.1.7	When my Cable Modem is connected to my computer , everything works fine , but when I add the router to the mix , I can not access the internet .	St
1.1.8	Initially I went through the Linksys Quick Installation Guide , step by step , power cycle to power cycle to get it going , but when I was finished and it was suppose to work , I would get the same T pPage can not be displayed ' message in IE every time .	St
1.1.9	Thinking I may have missed something in the process , I reset the router to its factory defaults , and tried to run the Setup Wizard provided by Linksys on CD .	St
1.1.10	I get towards the end every time , and then I receive an error message that the router is not able to connect to the internet , please turn the modem on/off , etc .	St
1.1.11	I tried to setup the router manually , but my network administration abilities are a bit lacking .	St
1.1.12	Everything I found online seemed to indicate that for Comcast , use the 'Automatic Configuration ( DHCP ) ' , then Clone the MAC Address , and I would be good to go , but I 've had no such luck .	St
1.1.13	When the modem is connected to the router , and the router is connected to the computer : the Power LED , WAN LED , and Ethernet Port LED are all lit and constant .	St
1.1.14	The Internet LED , however , is flashing , as is the PC/Activity LED on the modem itself .	St
1.1.15	Here is my IP Configuration when the modem is connected directly to the computer : http : //www.astuder.com/temp/prompt_01.gif Here is my IP Configuration after initializing the router setup : http : //www.astuder.com/temp/prompt_02.gif Here is the Router Status : http : //www.astuder.com/temp/router_status.gif Is there something I 'm overlooking ?	Ques
1.1.16	Is this kind of configuration even possible with Comcast ?	Ques
1.1.17	I 've stumbled across a few threads on different forums from last year with people having the same problems , but I was not able to get it working .	St
1.1.18	I 've read through both of the documents from Linksys below , but again I was unsuccessful .	St
1.1.19	http : //linksys.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/linksys.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php ? p_faqid=1040 & p_created=1086911813 & p_sid=uGENlxqh & p_lva= & p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9MiZwX3NlYXJjaF90eXBlPXNlYXJjaF9ubCZwX3Byb2RfbHZsMT0mcF9wcm9kX2x2bDI9JnBfc2NmX2xhbmc9MSZwX3BhZ2U9MSZwX3NlYXJjaF90ZXh0PWNvbWNhc3Q* & p_li= http : //linksys.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/linksys.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php ? p_faqid=199 & p_created=1084206387 & p_sid=uGENlxqh & p_lva= & p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9MiZwX3NlYXJjaF90eXBlPXNlYXJjaF9ubCZwX3Byb2RfbHZsMT0mcF9wcm9kX2x2bDI9JnBfc2NmX2xhbmc9MSZwX3BhZ2U9MSZwX3NlYXJjaF90ZXh0PWNvbWNhc3Q* & p_li= I will be extremely grateful to anyone who can point me in the right direction ... thank you .	St
1.2.1	This gets new owners everyday .	St
1.2.2	The wifi router may not have the latest firmware , even when new .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I checked on the Linksys site , but the option to download firmware for my router is 'grayed out ' , or in other words , not available .	St
1.3.2	So I 'm assuming that the firmware that was loaded straight out of the box is the most up to date ...	St
1.4.1	http : //www.linksys.com/support/support.asp ? spid=93 Some ISP 's require you do this or wait some number of hours .	St
1.4.2	In closing , tell what the results of this command when the linksys is installed ... IPCONFIG /ALL The 192.x.x.x addresses give no secrets aways since they are not internet addresses .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Bob , Just wanted to say thanks for your help .	Polite
1.5.2	After I got off work , I tried to get the router configured with no avail .	St
1.5.3	Fed up , I decided to go to Best Buy and just purchase a new router , different brand .	St
1.5.4	When I got the new D-Link router back home , I was having the exact same problems .	St
1.5.5	Realizing that there was some kind of severe networking problem with my main machine I switched back over the Linksys router and dug out the old Pentium II from the closet , and hooked it back up .	St
1.5.6	I moved the cable modem over to that machine , then ran the default Linksys router configuration program , and I nearly fell out of my chair when it worked on the first try .	St
1.5.7	I re-installed my network drivers on my other computer and now everything 's working beautifully .	St
1.5.8	Thanks again .	St
1.6.1	I had same problem 2x 's , once with the b router and once with the a+g+b router.I ended up removing all hardware and software and starting over.then I called comcast and they made sure i connected when hooked up direct and then they told me turn off every thing Modem Router and Computer , also the direct hook up to my omputer , then to wait 1 min , plug modem back in , then wait 1 min and plug router back in , then wait one min and turn computer back on and wireless works fine.I also had the wireless card in my computer and installed before i did the above .	St
1.6.2	Hope this helps you , if all else falls call comcast they were very HELPFULL .	St

1.7.1	the key is cloning your mac address and putting that into the router .	St
1.7.2	that way , the router looks like your pc to the cable modem .	St
1.7.3	at dos : ipconfig /all look at the physical address .	St
1.7.4	that 's your mac open up the router config screens by typing in the ip address of your router .	St
