<s> Hi there people, I have had a Dell Precision 330 with bios version A09. </s>
<s> It was running xp but the computer was meant for Windows 2000. </s>
<s> MY PROBLEMS: 1)When I start the computer it wont load windows but it says press f1 to retry boot f2 for utility setup 2) I would reinstall windows but cd booting does NOT appear in boot menu OR in bios boot sequence </s>
<s> If there is no &quot;CD boot&quot; option, you're left with little to do. </s>
<s> I suggest you remove the HD and mount(jerry-rig) in another PC and do a OS reload there. </s>
<s> Do the basic OS reload and then swap back. </s>
<s> DO NOT install all SP patches, do that once the HD has been returned. </s>
<s> Hopefully, it will see the need for a correction and ALLOW you that option to &quot;repair&quot; Otherwise, try again to boot from CD(if you can) and find the repair option&quot; from the menu and do that to help fix your problem. </s>
<s> Boot into &quot;safe mode&quot; hitting F8 during boot-up and select the repair option if present. </s>
<s> If not, then see if you can run the CHKDSK /R (DOS level) using the networking menu option being loaded. </s>
<s> It should then allow the CD be accessed. </s>
<s> Having the old PC bios if not truly updated, you're SOL w/o CD access. </s>
<s> If this seems odd, then google for the above options for far greater details. </s>
<s> If no CD boot, then you're left with possible USB boot, which can be as difficult as well under its own issues. </s>
<s> I see your problem as a &quot;catch-22&quot; type issue, not having this or that to proceed. </s>
<s> What happens when you hit F1 or F2 and give it plenty of time to react? </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> We used the old floppy disk install method. </s>
<s> It's only 6 diskettes but still available. </s>
<s> The owner of such a machine usually learns how to do this but some forget. </s>
<s> Let's find a refresher on this -&gt; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310994 Good luck in bringing the machine back. </s>
