<s> I have recently had 2 Maxtor HDDs shown to be &quot;Failing&quot; when tested with PowerMax. </s>
<s> One had already completely crashed (failed - see below), and the other is still going, but on its last legs... (Its data is now backed up, of course). </s>
<s> One was 5 months old, 250 giga, and the other was 18 months old, 160 giga. </s>
<s> Thanks to a (fairly recent) backup of the 250 giga, I've still got most of the data, though some was lost. </s>
<s> I think it's scandalous, particularly in view of the fact that the 250 giga one was my main HDD containing Win XP and all that that entails. </s>
<s> Is this normal behaviour for Maxtor HDDs? </s>
<s> Thanks, Chalkbel. </s>
<s> I usually find such in overheated cases. </s>
<s> The lifespans drop as the temperatures climb. </s>
<s> I'd look at that issue from the case and power supply angles. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Were both of these HDs in the same system and one mounted on top of the other? </s>
<s> This is important, as closely mounted HDs tend to create a &quot;hot spot&quot; and heat in general just isn't good for any electronics. </s>
<s> Plus, large HDs are usualy stuffed with platters and they're gettin the most out of the HD space and that can be tense as heat build-up can cause aureal drift and/or wear out the mechanicals faster due to tight tolerances. </s>
<s> It can be one or all of these problems, but they're closely related. </s>
<s> For the most part, I don't see a rash of Maxtors failing more than others. </s>
<s> I do suggest you cool your system as best as possible, when you request warranty replacement, if valid still. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> and one is 4 years+ old </s>
<s> Thanks to all of you for your help. </s>
<s> Bob & Willy, both of these HDs are indeed in the same system and one mounted on top of the other, so overheating looks like the problem. </s>
<s> In that case, I can expect it to happen again if I don't take action, which I will. </s>
<s> nerdyboy1234, I think you've reassured me as to Maxtor's durability. </s>
<s> So I can stop looking at other makes... </s>
<s> Thanks again, Chalkbel. </s>
