<s> i have an atix1900xtx which worked fine but since i have done a bios update everytime i play a game the card seems to reset its self (graphics card fan starts spinning fast). </s>
<s> Could they be a new setting under bios which maybe doing it i dont think its overheating. </s>
<s> When i play a game afte about 10 mins my screen goes white and the card reboots and windows says the graphics card stops responing. </s>
<s> Im running vista and my mobo is an ecs p965t-a Cheers chris </s>
<s> The software that came with it has some overclocking features. </s>
<s> Set it to default. </s>
<s> Also, when you update bios you change all the settings. </s>
<s> So go into the bios and make sure all the settings are right. </s>
<s> I think with that card you disable shadowing. </s>
<s> i did have it overclocked but then i set it to defalt and still no luck. </s>
<s> ill look in bios and let you know the results. </s>
<s> BTW im running vista home premium if that helps Chris </s>
<s> seems to be overheating but i have never had ant problems its not overclocked. </s>
<s> is they an after market cooling way to solve this Chris </s>
<s> If you can't run your video card with the new bios update. </s>
<s> Have you tried restoring the old bios and seeing if that resolves the issue? </s>
<s> I had a question a while ago about my ati card and I went to their ati.com website support forum. </s>
<s> They were pretty fast in replying. </s>
<s> But anyway, usaully when they update the bios for those boards they back up the old one. </s>
<s> I'd try that first, and if it persists I'd open up the computer and make sure everything was seated properly and working. </s>
<s> Uninstall the drivers and update them with the latest (especially if i'm running vista). </s>
<s> And if that didn't work I'd have a very serious problem with my video card. </s>
<s> An expensive problem. </s>
<s> need if you burned up the card. </s>
<s> Newegg.com has a number of GPU cooler ... some by Arctic Cooling, ThermalTake, Vantec, Zalman, etc., VAPCMD </s>
