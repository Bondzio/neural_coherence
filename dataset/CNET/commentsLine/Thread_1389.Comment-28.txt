hello there, you asking do i really need a new computer.
ok i am asuming you use your pc for browsing picture storage and music so i would say that all you need is a new hard drive, in my opinion you have enough pc specs to perform the required operations on your pc a secondary hard drive used as storage would save your c: local disk.
hard drives are cheap these days can if you are not able to fit one yourseft take your computer to a small pc store or pc technician and request a hd install.
if you only have the space for only 1 hd then you will need your windows xp installation cd and cd's for all your hardware or download the necessary software to get your hardware operational if you plan to do a clean install.
