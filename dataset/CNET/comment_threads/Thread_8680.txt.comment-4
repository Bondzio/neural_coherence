That motherboard only supports SATA I drives.
There is a bug in the chipset that prevents SATA II (300Mbps) drives from reverting to SATA I mode.
You can make it work by manually setting the drive to SATA I.
Most drives have a jumper or internal setting to accomplish this (for exactly this purpose).
See the drive manufacturer's website to find out how.
You may have to download a utility program (and find a machine to run it on) to set the drive up the way you need.
