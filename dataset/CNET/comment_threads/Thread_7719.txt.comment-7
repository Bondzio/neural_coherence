The fact that it uses RS-232 connection suggest this is an older model and/or discontinued one.
Most newer UPS that have links to the system for s/w control are USB based.
If you google and find such s/w available, it needn't be directly provided for that brand name.
It *MAY* work as a generic type setup, it just needs A UPS to work.
So, if you find a newer s/w it *may* work also using a RS-232 to USB adapter then again, once you get into deviated manufacturer setup, it could falter as well.
