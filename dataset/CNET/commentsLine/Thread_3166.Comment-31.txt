i expect there are too many variable to make a life time projection for your external hard drive.
however, the reliability of most all electronics is inversely related to operating temperature.
let it get too hot and it is sure to fail far more quickly than under normal operating temperature conditions.
hopefully your external drive is in an enclosure that sucks away the heat from the drive, and the enclosure temperature reflects the temperature of the drive itself.
if you external hard drive is getting hotter than just merely warm to the touch, you are risking an early failure.
if necessary, take a surplus 12 volt cpu fan from an obsolete computer; connect it to a surplus 5 volt dc cell telephone power supply, and use it to keep the external drive cool.
