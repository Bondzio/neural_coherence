i've recently brought an old-ish computer from a friend, so you can imagine not all the install cds/manuals are there.
the sound system is an altec lansing ada885.
the left/right and surround speakers are working fine, however, no sound is coming from the subwoofer.
the subwoofer is on and it does pass it's own diagnostic check (press a button-&gt;makes a sound).
all the connections are fine.
however, it never makes a sound in any windows application or game.
could it be a soundcard issue?
i'm using creative sound blaster!
value card.
it's updated to their newest version.
in the sb control program, there is an option to select 2 or 4 speaker, but none for subwoofer.
is it supposed to be that way?
thanks for any help, i'm very new to this.
