with no IDE support.
Looking at buyer reviews on NEWEGG for SATA DVD drives in the past has done nothing but discourage me from buying SATA optical drives.
That said ..
I've got other peripherals (and suspect you do too) like PCI IDE controllers that could overcome such problems but lets face, most don't have the extra stuff it might take.
Just my 2 cents Keep up the good work.
