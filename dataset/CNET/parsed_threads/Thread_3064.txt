<s> With that said I need some help on this. </s>
<s> It's time to upgrade but I really am not up on the current tech. </s>
<s> More over, my price range is limited with a baby on the way so those of you who are patient and want to help I'd more then welcome it. </s>
<s> I want to be able to play the new PC games so I want decent stuff but I know with my budget the latest and greatest is out of the question. </s>
<s> I want the best bang for my buck over all. </s>
<s> I was thinking of going with the Athalon 64 3200. </s>
<s> Is this a good plan? </s>
<s> (I love playing World of Warcraft and I want this to run smoothly) I also want to know what is the difference between socket 754 and 939 pin. </s>
<s> Now I've figured out I probably want 939 pin but I don't know why. </s>
<s> Finally on this topic, what does 90nm mean? </s>
<s> Do I want this or the standard Athalon 64 3200? </s>
<s> Ok, section 2 of Jon's PC building for idiots. </s>
<s> I need a good mother board recomendation for this processor. </s>
<s> Again, I want it to run games well but I don't need a ton of bells and whistles. </s>
<s> I'm trying to keep this as cheap as possible but still good enough to game on. </s>
<s> Finally, graphic card? </s>
<s> I found a Sapphire Radeon 9250 for $44. </s>
<s> That sounded like a great deal but will it hold up to the most current games out? </s>
<s> Can I run World of Warcraft on a high setting with this? </s>
<s> I've been told the PNY Verto nVIDIA 6800 GS is the best bang for my buck but I wanted to stay under $100 for a video card if possible. </s>
<s> Oh, and once we put something together here I'll need to know what power supply to run. </s>
<s> I'm sure I can figure out ram. </s>
<s> I have 2 hard drives and a well ventilated custom case. </s>
<s> And do you need Windows XP and a monitor? </s>
<s> I do have monitor and XP. </s>
<s> I have everything I need...a fully running box, I just need a new motherboard, processor, and video card. </s>
<s> Socket 754 is dead (no more from the production line). </s>
<s> That means replacement (and upgrade) CPU's and motherboards are becoming harder and harder to find. </s>
<s> Todays AMD desktop CPU's fit socket 939 motherboards. </s>
<s> Current popular AMD desktop product lines: - Sempron (budget, analogous to Intel Celeron) - Athlon 64 - Athlon 64 X2 (dual core) - Athlon 64 FX (gamer) More AMD product line info: http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/ProductInformation/0,,30_118,00.html 130nm, 90nm, 65nm = Size of CPU die (in nanometers) - smaller is supposed to be cheaper, faster, cooler, and more efficient, but actual models don't always see all these benefits. </s>
<s> http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/ComputingSolutions/0,,30_288_13265_13295%5E13337,00.html </s>
<s> Look for a motherboard with an nVidia nForce4 chipset. </s>
<s> Check NewEgg.com if you are in the USA. </s>
<s> Whatever fits your budget: - nForce4 - nForce4 Ultra - nForce4 SLI Descriptions: http://www.nvidia.com/page/mobo.html (Scroll down to the chart) </s>
<s> I forgot the nForce4 feature chart: http://www.nvidia.com/page/nforce4_family.html </s>
<s> DFI nf4 DAGF (board) AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+ (processor) 2GB (2x1GB) Corsair XMS DDR400 </s>
<s> Another question. </s>
<s> With this mother board: BIOSTAR TForce6100-939 Socket 939 NVIDIA GeForce 6100 Micro ATX AMD Motherboard Do I need a graphic card? </s>
<s> I noticed it doesnt have an agp slot and I really want to use this graphic card: PNY GeForce 6800 GS / 256MB GDDR3 / AGP 8x I've decided on these products so far: AMD Athlon 64 3200+ Venice 2000MHz HT Socket 939 Processor Model ADA3200BPBOX - Retail --$154.00 PNY GeForce 6800 GS / 256MB GDDR3 / AGP 8x / DVI / VGA / TV Out / Video Card -- $179.99 I need a suggestion on a good quality board preferably around $50 - $80 that will work with these two components. </s>
<s> The latest & greatest video card slot is PCI Express X16. </s>
<s> Video for gaming: worst &lt; integrated &lt; PCI &lt; AGP 8X &lt; PCI Express X16 &lt; best Note that &quot;PCI&quot; is not the same as &quot;PCI Express&quot; Also note that PCI Express X16 cards are just as inexpensive or even less expensive than AGP cards. </s>
<s> That particular motherboad has integrated GeForce 6100 video and a PCI Express X16 slot. </s>
<s> AGP is dead, and ATI/nVidia probably won't make any new cards for it. </s>
<s> For the price of the 6800GS, you should look at the 7600GT, or an X1800GTO with a large rebate. </s>
<s> Hi I am kind of in the same boat ... </s>
<s> I'm still using an Athlon XP 1800+ with a Via KT 266/333 chipset and that mobo does use AGP. </s>
<s> So, got a cheap eVGA FX5500 256mb card from newegg. </s>
<s> Having problems, think it's the motherboard and/or the chipset. </s>
<s> So, I'm going to probably be buying a cheap &quot;for now&quot; (like eMachine T6528) computer so we have something to use until I can get my custom built re-built. </s>
<s> Then figure out how to network the 2 computers. </s>
<s> I looked at the motherboard you chose, looked around and found this one: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813128286#DetailSpecs About the same price. </s>
<s> If you already have an AGP card and need to upgrade this may work for you. </s>
<s> Personally, I'm reading everything review-wise I can on all the boards I'm looking at. </s>
<s> This site and google can be your friends. </s>
<s> The motherboard, processor and power supply from my (limited) understanding are the 3 most important components in your computer. </s>
<s> You don't have to pay top dollar for the latest or just for a name, but I believe it does pay to spend that little extra to get good quality. </s>
<s> Just my .02 </s>
<s> I was trying to tell the poster that his chosen motherboard has integrated video and a PCI Express X16 slot, that AGP is less desirable than PCI Express X16, and why the consideration of an AGP video card on that motherboard is moot (no AGP slot). </s>
<s> Sorry for my vague post. </s>
<s> ...why he would want AGP. </s>
