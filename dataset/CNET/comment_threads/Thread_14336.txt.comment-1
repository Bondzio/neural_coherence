Hi, I recently bought an Acer Aspire Notebook.
When I plugged a gadget in the USB drive (tried all 3 drives) it says that the USB drive is low-powered.
I have tried a usb hub with a y-cable, a usb hub with external power and a usb 2.0 pcmcia card and it doesn't work.
I checked and the usb port is 2.0.
Is there anything I can do to make it high-powered?
Can I change the USB Controller?
Any advice greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance.
