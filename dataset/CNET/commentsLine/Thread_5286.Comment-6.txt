bob, thanks for your message, but asus told us that we needed to send everything back to them.
didn't sound logical to me, but they insisted.
the frustrating thing beyond this incredibly poor customer service situation is that all they needed to do was spend $20 to overnight the adapter to me, but their internal bureaucracy has prevented that simple solution from taking place.
