Thank you for your help.
Why I'm thinking of Android system at all is that the Windows slates are very expensive.
I bought the hp 500 sometimes in 2011 but in less than 4 months the sliding power switch failed, locking up the system (you neither switch on or off) and is in for warrant repair or replacement.
Meanwhile I needed a slate so I currently have the Samsung Series 7 which most agree is very expensive.
