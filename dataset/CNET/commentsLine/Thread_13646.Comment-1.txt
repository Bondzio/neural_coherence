i need to do some crowd sourcing.
i currently have a dir 655 that is dying.
the problem seems to be the power cord.
i thought about trying to replace only the cord but, we all know that once something like a router starts getting hit with electrical issues its only a matter of time before it dies altogether.
so my question then becomes, which router to replace it with.
ordinarily, i'd stick with what's worked for me.
unfortunately, i don't have that kind of money right now.
there is also a timing factor that keeps me from going online for a really good deal.
i literally have about $ 50 to spend and i'm in a small town with a wal-mart and a radio shack to serve my tech needs.
so i'm pretty much stuck picking from three routers.
netgear wgr614 wireless-g 54mbps broadband router netgear wgr614 wireless-g 54mbps broadband router cisco linksys wireless n router, wrt120n belkin surf n300 wireless router now,, i have to say the belkin is one i'm not really interested in because, i've never ever had a good experience with them.
however, i'm willing to be fair.
the only thing that bothers me about the cisco is, it claims to be wireless n 2.0 but they aren't willing to say what the top speed of the wireless radio is anywhere on the box.
as for the net gear, i've had a hit or miss relationship with them.
had a great hub once, but also had a horrible router once.
the last thing i'll say is, obviously , i want to get the best overall router for the money and while the wireless is certainly important in that regard, right now everything is wired, so i just need something to get me by until i can get a better router.
in other words, something that doesn't need power cycled every other day.
so what do you think?
