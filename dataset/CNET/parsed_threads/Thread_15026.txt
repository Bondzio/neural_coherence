<s> Hi everybody, Is an OCZ PC-3200 DDR400 Value Series 2GB (2x1024MB) Dual Channel Kit (OCZ4002048V3DC-K), with 3-3-3 timing, fast enough for running modern games such as FEAR? </s>
<s> If I choose to use this ram, will I experience any lags, assuming I have an AMD 4400 x2, and a 7800 gt oc. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for trying to help </s>
<s> So I'll just tell you what I see. </s>
<s> If I auto config this mem it sets up to 3,3,3. </s>
<s> Using a mem tester I find that I can config this mem to 2,2,3 and it runs fine. </s>
<s> I've run mem benchmarks both ways and darned if I can see a diff. </s>
<s> Has to do with latency, the first three does any way. </s>
<s> The difference between 2 and 3 latency is 10 nano seconds. </s>
<s> Nano means One-billionth. </s>
<s> Bottom line, 3-3-3 is fine. </s>
<s> Cheers Thanks for your input guys!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> as there are faster ones that are cheaper than that or at least 2x512 sticks. </s>
<s> never the mfr's fastest memory. </s>
<s> But a good performamnce to price ratio. </s>
<s> But I think only benchmarks and maybe a gain of 5-10FPS maximum is the difference you might get from the bottom of the barrell to the top. </s>
