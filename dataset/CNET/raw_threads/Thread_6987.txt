I tried playing a dvd movie, error messages from windows media player. some DVD movie would play but it keeps skipping, motion is not in sync with voice and mouth. 2. also found out that nothing of the most basic in screensaver would allow me to choose. it keeps saying video card installed error! it came original with NVIDIA GeForce 6150.. video card. the box has been sent to HP 2x in Texas for repair and still came back with the same problem. the 3rd time , HP sent me a new video card/mother board and a technician came to my house to fix it to no avail! He says that theres a compatibility issues with this model- and Vista and .... He attempted to uninstall then install new driver from website to no avail. any suggestions? Im awaiting at the moment to hear from HP support. its been 6 months of hel... with this box.
