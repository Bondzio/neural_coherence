1.1.1	I have a Viewsonic LCD monitor and was wondering what was the best cleaning product to use .	St
1.1.2	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	They make special LCD spray solutions .	St
1.2.2	I use the stuff from Monster on my DLP screen , so it should work fine on an LCD .	St
1.2.3	Check your local computer store .	St
1.3.1	Click on this link , then click on step four and read towards the bottom .	St
1.3.2	Cnet says to take a damp cloth and gently wipe it on your LCD .	St
1.3.3	I did what they suggested , and it worked fine .	St
1.3.4	Make sure you do n't spray too much water .	St
1.4.1	Just wanted to make sure I do n't mess up my new monitor .	St
1.4.2	Thanks again .	St
1.5.1	so it is really critical to make sure that you know how to clean an LCD .	St
1.5.2	There was this ad I saw about some sort of tough plastic to protect your LCD .	St
1.5.3	It comes in a variety of sizes like 17inchs , and 19inchs , and is supposed to make text on LCDs look clearer .	St
1.5.4	It is so tough that you can actually use your LCD as a cutting board !	St
1.5.5	I saw an ad for this in PC magazine .	St
1.5.6	I 'll try to find it and post back .	St
1.6.1	I believe this is the product I am talking about .	St
1.6.2	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16824999207 For some reason Newegg only has a 19inch size .	St
1.6.3	The ad I saw for this product had other sellers ( Newegg one of them ) .	St
1.6.4	I 'll try to find the magazine to check for the other sellers .	St
1.7.1	I think I 'll just stick to the method that CNet mentioned in their cleaning lesson .	St
1.7.2	Thanks for the help though .	St
1.7.3	I understand that that would probably be the best way to keep the screen clean but it 's just too expensive .	St
1.8.1	With performance comes price .	St
1.8.2	I wo n't be using my LCD as a cutting board so I wo n't need it .	St
1.8.3	My LCD does get dirty , but a wipe with a damp cloth cleans it just fine .	St
1.8.4	Good luck .	Polite
1.9.1	To protect my LCD monitor 's screen , I bought a piece of thin & quot ; optical quality & quot ; pexiglass from a local hardware store for roughly $ 7 -- had to cut it in half .	St
1.9.2	Taped it on up top .	St
1.9.3	I would n't recommend this for everyone , since it is home brewed , but it is an option .	St
1.9.4	I did it after a pair of round-nosed school scissors dinged my laptop 's LCD ; it keeps people from playing & quot ; darts & quot ; with my LCD monitor .	St
1.10.1	I bought this for my PowerBook , and it works great .	St
1.10.2	They include a chamois with the bottle .	St
1.10.3	You spray , wipe , buff , and all the fingerprints , dust , and beveage splashes disappear .	St
1.10.4	20 bucks for 150 ml , but you use it [ quite ] sparingly for best results .	St
1.11.1	I used iklear , and Moster lcd cleaners , but both left awful smudges and streaks .	St
1.11.2	I later found out that they use polymers which do more harm than good .	St
1.11.3	The Shaggymac Optimist Prime lcd spray is the best laptop lcd cleaner I have used .	St
1.11.4	When used with their microfiber it can not be beat .	St
1.11.5	Even with my Sony glossy Xbrite screen , it leaves it perfectly clean .	St
1.11.6	Also the Shaggymac laptop screen protector pads are awesome ... a must have !	St
1.11.7	http : //www.shaggymac.com/index.php ? main_page=product_info & cPath=2 & products_id=73	St
1.12.1	I use an Office Depot store brand product called & quot ; Screencleaner Non-streaking & quot ; and a Scotch Brite microfiber cloth which you can also get at OD .	St
1.12.2	Spray on cloth and wipe on any off monitor .	St
1.12.3	I use it on my TV too .	St
1.12.4	This system is the goods .	St
1.12.5	JV .	St
1.13.1	I use a 50:50 mixture water and isopropyl alcohol , moisten a microfibre cloth , wipe screen from one side to the other .	St
1.13.2	Continue down the screen til finished .	St
