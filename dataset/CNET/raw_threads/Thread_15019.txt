To regain space on your C drive, run CleanDisk frequently, emptying the recycle bin each time. Since you must have another drive (else you would not have asked about moving the Recycle Bin there), you should move more of your files to that drive. Actually, there are several reasons why it is best to have your OS, programs, and other seldom-changed files on the C drive and have your My Documents folder(s) and other data folders on another drive. Hope this helps Frank
