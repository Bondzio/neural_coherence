Sorry, run through that again.
Im having trouble flashing the bios, but thats another story, Iv been told I have the latest version anyway.
How do you slow down the memory timings?
And what do you mean by pay off?
im running a DAW (digital audio workstation) and need all the RAM I can get when running (often 3) big power hungry programs at the same time...if thats what u meant?
Anyway, thanks.
