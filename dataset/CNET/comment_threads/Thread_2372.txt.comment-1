I was wondering if anyone could tell me how many amps this power supply has?
http://www.ncix.com/products/index.php?sku=23844&vpn=RP-500-PCAR&manufacture=COOLERMASTER I feel foolish but i dont know the symbol for amps :S (i would assume it would be an A...) The ati shopping site reccomends atleast 30 amps on your power supply for the x1950, does this mean i shouldnt buy anything without that or is that just to be safe?
(if i misunderstand then let me know :D) Thanks
