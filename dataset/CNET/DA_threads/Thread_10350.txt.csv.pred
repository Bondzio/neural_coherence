1.2.1	Do a printer & quot ; self-test & quot ; , review your manual or help guide on how that 's done with your model printer .	St
1.2.2	If it ca n't print a self-test page , then likely the printer is hosed .	St
1.2.3	Check to see that the ink carts are firmly seated and/or if any blinking leds are present on the printer .	St
1.2.4	Until , you do a self-test do n't mess with windows at all , you may cause further problems .	St
1.2.5	Also , the support website at HP should explain common problems and resolutions .	St
1.2.6	You can aslo try the printer 's & quot ; toolbox & quot ; if applicable for your model , it should provide some insight and maybe a self-test as well .	St
1.2.7	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.3.1	I 'd lift the cover up , or open the back ( think that 's where HPs have a door ) to look for a paper jam .	St
1.3.2	As Willy pointed out , look for a blinking light .	St
1.3.3	Can mean many things , including a paper jam .	St
