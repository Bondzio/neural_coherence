1.1.1	I have a pentuim 2.53 and i also have 2/512mb of 2100 ddr ram.	St
1.1.2	My question is.. would 512mb of 3200 dddr ram be that much faster then 2100.	St
1.1.3	Would 1 stick of 3200 beat 2 sticks of 2100 or would spending the extra money for 2 sticks of 512 3200 make that much of a differnce?	Sug
1.2.1	Your memory speed will not increase with faster RAM.	St
1.2.2	That's set by the CPU and mainboard, not by the RAM.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	so you are saying that ram does not increase your pc speed?	St
1.3.2	and waht is a mainboard?	St
1.3.3	is that a motherboard	St
1.4.1	yes mainboard/motherboard	Res
1.5.1	my motherboard can handle higher ram!	St
1.5.2	If i put the ram in it still wont make it faster.	St
1.6.1	The memory may be faster, but the machine in total will not see a speed increase in over 99% of the cases cited.	St
1.6.2	You'll have wasted your money.	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	i understan now thanks for the help and saving me money so waht would be a good way to increase my computer speed.	St
1.8.1	Your machine, as configured, should be plenty fast.	St
1.8.2	Some things you can't speed up with Processor, or ram.	St
1.8.3	Like e-mail, and web surfing in general.	St
1.8.4	Or printing.	St
1.8.5	Is there something in particular that seems slow?	St
1.9.1	Simple things like running less apps at the same time.	St
1.9.2	A full hard disk is much slower than one that is 1/2 full for instance.	St
1.9.3	Bob	St
1.10.1	Hmmm....If your computer/motherboard was designed for DDR2100 then the later designed computers for 2700 or still later designed computers for 3200 would make no difference on your 2100 designed MB.	St
1.10.2	Course you can up your RAM beyond 512MB but your computer if designed for 2100 would show no improvement using 2700 or 3200.	St
1.10.3	Crucial.com will tell you what type and max RAM for your particular computer.	St
1.10.4	Personally, I have not heard of any speed increase in gaming for RAM over 512MB, except for bragging about having XXX RAM.	St
1.10.5	Higher RAM for video editing and other intense graphics work may be necessary and advisable.	St
1.11.1	You can decide, if your ram is capable of sending back and forth 1100 more megabytes per second to the chipset on your motherboard is it going to be faster?	St
