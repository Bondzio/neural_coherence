Well, if you need wireless connection (and you say you do) and you have Windows 7 and you don't have a Windows 7 driver for your current appliance, you'll need to buy a replacement that has.
Such can be a USB-antenna, or (preferred) an antenna that plugs into your RJ-45 port or even on a PCI-card.
Plug it in, install the drivers that come with the new device and you're ready to go.
Be sure to tell the shop that you need drivers for Windows 7!
