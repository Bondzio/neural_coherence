i have a p4 2ghz, 2.5gb ram, pny geforce 8600 gt (w/ 256mb ram), and i am using a 32&quot; hdtv.
i bought the card when i upgraded my old pc to some new super pc about a year ago.
about 5 months ago i noticed that when i play games like crysis, hl2, age of conan, left 4 dead, dead space, and day of defeat: source.
i have been monitoring the temp of the video card and it idles at about 56-58c and when under high stress it goes up to 80. pny tech support said that the card normal operating temp is up to 100c.
i tested my ram with memtest over 6 hours straight and it found 0 errors.
i used the nvidia ntune stress test and it finds no errors, but i don't know if that counts for anything.
anyone have any ideas what is causing the lines?
btw i do get some artifacting also.
thanks.
