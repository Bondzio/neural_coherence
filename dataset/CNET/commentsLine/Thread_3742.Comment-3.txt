bob, thanks for your always expert advice.
i will see if they can get a better antenna.
the system is hooked up well by a previous engineer but the antenna really is a good distance from both offices.
perhaps a better antenna woudl correct the problem.
if not they will have to go to strict cable.
thanks from norway,
