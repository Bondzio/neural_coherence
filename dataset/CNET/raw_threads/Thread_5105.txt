I built a PC with the following configuration: MOBO- ASUS M2N-32SLI which includes Nvidia RAID controller Windows 7 Professional (64-bit) AMD Dual Core Athlon processor 4 GB RAM Current RAID confguration is 2 disks mirrored for drive C (all program installs) Mirror 2 has all docs, data, etc My question is this: how difficult would it be to reconfigure the RAID to 5? Would the best solution be to break each mirror, and add an additional drive for drives C and D and convert them to a separate RAID 5 virtual drive for each? Also, would I have to lose all of the data and/or programs, or does the RAID controller automatically reconfigure the data and convert it to RAID 5? The reason that I'm using RAID instead of backup is that I have huge video and music files (I create videos and arrange music) and don't want to add a 2 TB drive to back up everything. However, I can't risk losing my information and files. I hope that this is a bit clearer than mud. If anyone needs clarification or additional info, I will be happy to append it to this original post. Thanks in advance for your help. MIACLOCKMAN

I can reply with the instructions in the message body, but the chapter on the RAID controller is 17 pages long. I have searched the FAQs and every other place on this site, but cannot find where I can upload the pdf. Please forgive my ignorance, but this is the first forum where I've encountered this problem. Thanks, jeff

The pdf download is about at the middle of the page. Again, I thank you for willing to take the time to see if you can help me. Hope you're having a Happy Turkey Day! http://www.givemefile.net/manuals/mainboards/asus/m2n32-sli_deluxe.html Jeff

I would create an image of the RAID 1 array and store that on another HD. 2. I would create the RAID 5 array on a new set of HDs using the BIOS utility to do such. (This will break the RAID 1 array) You will also want to make sure your HD selection is designed for RAID operation. 3. I would restore the image to the new array. 4. I would attempt to boot the PC. With a little luck and cooperation from the imaging software, this should work since the array is considered as one drive. I have used this method to move an OS on a single disk to a RAID 1 array and it worked fine with XP. I've not gone from one RAID configuration to another, however. Your MB claims to support RAID 0/1/5 and JBOD. Good luck.
