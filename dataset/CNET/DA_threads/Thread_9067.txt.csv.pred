1.1.1	I 'm considering buying a netbook that comes with Windows 7 Starter .	St
1.1.2	I checked Microsoft 's & quot ; check-list & quot ; to compare Starter to Windows 7 Home Premium .	St
1.1.3	It seems to me Starter edition would simply eliminate much of the & quot ; fluff & quot ; and not much that would be really missed .	St
1.1.4	Can anybody say what reasons one may be disatisfied with Starter on a netbook ?	Ques
1.2.1	Some folk have put one item or another on a stick to parade around that 7 Starter is garbage .	St
1.2.2	Things like the wallpaper .	St
1.2.3	Ok , let me share I pushed a little netbook to the edge and it did fine .	St
1.2.4	Here 's what we setup .	St
1.2.5	It 's advanced so here goes .	St
1.2.6	Visual Studio 2008 for Windows Mobile development .	St
1.2.7	We ran the debugger over USB & quot ; plus & quot ; we installed Mobiler for remote control .	St
1.2.8	No speed demon but what proof you can do a lot with Starter ?	Ques
1.2.9	Bob	St
1.3.1	Yes , when I searched this forum to see if my question had already been answered , I saw your posted test results .	St
1.3.2	I realize there 's only so much performance you can expect in these little computers- that 's understood .	St
1.3.3	But for normal usage that a netbook is intended for , my only concern is if there are important features left off Starter .	St
1.3.4	I do n't consider Aero and & quot ; shake & quot ; important .	St
1.4.1	Some take the wallpaper item , put it on a stick to parade around as proof .	St
1.4.2	Here even BLUETOOTH works without any driver hunt .	St
1.4.3	I only have 2 adapters but they plug in and just work .	St
1.4.4	This is super nice .	Polite
1.4.5	-- & gt ; & gt ; Another rant we see is the missed DVDRW drive .	St
1.4.6	But this is an optional item that you decide on .	St
1.4.7	-- - & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; And then we have the problem of how to restore the OS when folks or malware kills it .	St
1.4.8	You 'll see rants about how they feel entitled to the DVDRW drive because you ca n't load the OS without one .	St
1.4.9	I do n't know how to respond to those .	St
1.4.10	Ok , NORMAL USAGE .	St
1.4.11	A netbook is not a laptop and should never sub for one .	St
1.4.12	You might understand this if you used one for a few hours .	St
1.4.13	Bob	St
1.5.1	So I can assume Windows 7 Starter Edition is n't missing anything included in Home Premium that 's very important ?	Ques
1.5.2	As for a $ 300 netbook , it 's performance limitations are obvious and should be accepted for what it is .	St
1.5.3	So how would you re-install the OS , if necessary ?	Ques
1.6.1	Pretty simple .	St
1.6.2	I use the usual USB DVDRW drive and the restore media .	St
1.6.3	Some opt out then start a rant about it should be included because its required to restore the machine .	St
1.6.4	Again I do n't handle that rant well .	St
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	OK , I was n't sure if you could boot from an external CD/DVD drive .	St
1.7.2	Did n't know if it would just show as a & quot ; Removable Storage & quot ; USB .	St
1.7.3	I think I 'm all set .	St
1.7.4	Thanks .	Polite
