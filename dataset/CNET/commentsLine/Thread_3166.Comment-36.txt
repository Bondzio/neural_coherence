all things have a life expectancy, but some do last longer than others.
i have had new hard drives fail after a few days, other have gone on for years.
i always back up my data, photos, docs onto cds or dvd.
some makers give 3 or 5 years warranty on a drive, and i have successfully claimed for replacements.
but, this is not much good to you if all your work is on a failed hard drive.
you can get firms to rescue the data, but this is an expensive solution.
i don't know which make of hard drive is the best, but there are some that i would not use again.
your could have a raid set up, to give you a bit more security.
