the worst windows ever was windows millenium edition.
95 had it's initial issues, as did 98, and xp was almost as bad as me was, til sp2 came out.
vista of course has it's own issues.
for some reason, i dont remember the issues with windows as bad with 3.11 and earlier.
does anyone else?
now for the hard drive question: about 10 years ago, i purchased a maxtor h/d.
in those days, you paid $300+ for a &quot;large h/d&quot; approximately 20-30 gigs.
it was horrible to install.
and, once installed, within days, the plates started slapping.
so, i exchange it.
same thing.
last time i trusted maxtor.
i then exchange it for a western digital.
easy install.
actually, the drivers installed so quick, i wondered if it actually installed correctly.
problem with wd, however, is every wd i ever owned, went out within 2 years.
im using seagate right now, so, we'll see.
5 year warranty sounds cool to me.
if it doesnt last, then i'll move on.
i have no loyalty to hard drive companies.
