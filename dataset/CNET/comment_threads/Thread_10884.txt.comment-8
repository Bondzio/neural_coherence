Works in computers also, he loaned me an extra tower, (functioning computer) so that I could swap out hardware to eliminate issues.
Ends up his good power supply would boot her system.
But no video (his video card didn't work in it either)(bad MB problem there) Although her HDD, and Video card worked fine in his.
Her PS wouldn't boot up his working PC.
So looks like her PS and MB are bad.
Thanks for all the help, unless y'all have anything else to add, I appreciate the help on this issue.
