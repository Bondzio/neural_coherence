typing in &quot;portable wifi routers&quot;.
you'll see most are designed for mobile use.
but, since you said that a standard router was too big, are you sure that something the size of a deck of cards would be acceptable but not one as big as a paperback book?
is that what's most important to you.
otherwise, about all i can think is that maybe you insist that your pc be on before the connection even exists.
keep in mind that part of what a router does is handle ip addressing on a network and that connecting such to your laptop would create a separate network as well.
i also can't see anyway that doing what you're asking isn't going to cripple your laptop in some regard.
a wireless router connected to your modem would do all you seem to want if you could find about 40 or so cubic inches of space.
