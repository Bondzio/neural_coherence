<s> Hi All, I recently bought a Maxtor External Hard drive (One Touch II, 250gb) and ever since the first day, I cannot seem to copy a file onto it, if the file is larger than approx. </s>
<s> 4 gigs, is this normal, or should I get it check out?!?! </s>
<s> What are my options ? </s>
<s> Thanks in Advanced Bristowlicious </s>
<s> The drive is supplied in the widely compatible FAT32 format but with that comes a 4GB file size limit. </s>

<s> I have alot of important data on the hard drive and need to possibly transfer files larger than 4gb, as I work with video and film. </s>
<s> I also use Mac and PC. </s>
<s> It is in FAT32 format where the limit is 4Gb as you mentioned, what is the format that will work with both platforms and support &gt;4Gb files, will I have to reformat and delete everything? </s>
<s> Thanks Bristowlicious </s>
<s> Sorry, but I don't know of a solution for you except to use a file splitter. </s>
<s> -&gt; Did you just reveal that you don't have a backup? </s>
<s> In the latest version of MacOSX it's supposed to work better with NTFS than ever before. </s>
<s> But ask in the Mac forums before you convert the drive to NTFS. </s>
<s> While conversion is not supposed to wipe the drive, imagine that a few were surprised with a clean, empty volume. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob, you've been a big help. </s>
<s> Will look it to splitting the file, or the NTFS format. </s>
<s> Thanks Again Bristowlicious </s>
