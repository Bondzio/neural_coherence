hi jose, a little while back, i picked up a motherboard that came with integrated video.
i did this, as i was only upgrading a few things, & didn't want to buy a seperate video card at the time (that is, in addition to the other pieces i was buying).
if the unit you are looking at, allows you to add another card to go along with it later (pcie), than save the money & get it.
i'll explain briefly.
i can later add another video card along with the one i already have, making it two video cards (which increases the video ram).
using the pcie connector on the motherboard.
the one you are looking at, will use some of the ram the system comes with.
in this case, 256 megs.
seeing i put in 4 gigs of ram, i didn't lose much.
is 256 megs of video huge?
not really.
most cards are double that & the current ones are four times that (1 gig).
but you can play many games, with out loss or much loss.
the best way to find out is to see what is suggested on the video card size, of the games you are interested in.
it will list two levels.
minimum & recommened.
minimum is what will get you by & recommended (or better), will play the game smoothly.
also keep in mind, that you may have to buy any additional hardware (like a video card) upgrades from hp (or one of their merchants), in order to work.
these are proprietary computers.
the deal is that they make them at low cost.
which is a great way to get a computer.
the downfall is that you can't always use any hardware that you see.
contact hp of course.
don't be discouraged in buying the computer completly, as you'll have more fun using it, than waiting to find one (to buy) that you can use.
i know you'll hear a few people jump up & down about buying component (seperate or stand alone cards), which is the way to go, but that doesn't always fit into the budget.
good luck in your purchase & remember to save your progress often.
