Long ago another traveler had their drive collection.
They struggled with 4+ drives and I had made it worse by gifting them some old 200MB drive.
I had moved on to a 2GB drive (large for those days) and I continue to this day keeping the drive count low.
I thought the link I shared had a video card with 2 ports not counting the onboard port.
Did I miss something?
