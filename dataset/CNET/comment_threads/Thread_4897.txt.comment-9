when you say you tried to overclock, i assume you just configured the memory as ddr2-667 and then xp failed to boot.
if so, i recommend you just toss your current memory and get all new ddr2-667.
if you're not familiar with ram overclocking techniques, it could take awhile for you to figure out the uppper limits of your current ram and you could wind up screwing something up.
getting memory rated at ddr2-667 will leave you with the cpu overclock which is much easier (fewer settings to deal with).
for specifc help with the overclocking, i suggest you make a post on anandtech.com (the site i referred you to earlier).
