<s> I am planning on building my own PC soon, and have a good grasp of everything I need, the only think I never see mentioned is the netowrk slot. </s>
<s> Do Ineed to buy a network card to plug my calbe modem ethernet cable into or is there on built into the mother board? </s>
<s> Most if not all mobos have the RJ45 network jack built into the motherboard. </s>
<s> Just check the specs on the board to be sure. </s>
<s> I haven't seen a mobo in a while that doesn't have at least one ethernet port built into it. </s>
<s> Even $40 boards do, and many motherboards have two. </s>
<s> Shouldn't be a problem there. </s>
<s> thanks! </s>
<s> So I guess I dont need to buy a ethernet card when I am buying stuff for my new PC? </s>
<s> I can just plug my cable modem right into my motherboard and get online? </s>
<s> Yep, it's that simple. </s>
<s> If your cable modem isn't a combination modem-router, I'd install a router with a firewall between the cable modem and your computers for security purposes. </s>
