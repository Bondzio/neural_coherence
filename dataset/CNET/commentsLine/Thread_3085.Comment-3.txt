were both of these hds in the same system and one mounted on top of the other?
this is important, as closely mounted hds tend to create a &quot;hot spot&quot; and heat in general just isn't good for any electronics.
plus, large hds are usualy stuffed with platters and they're gettin the most out of the hd space and that can be tense as heat build-up can cause aureal drift and/or wear out the mechanicals faster due to tight tolerances.
it can be one or all of these problems, but they're closely related.
for the most part, i don't see a rash of maxtors failing more than others.
i do suggest you cool your system as best as possible, when you request warranty replacement, if valid still.
