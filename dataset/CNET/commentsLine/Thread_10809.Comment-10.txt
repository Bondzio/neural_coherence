i've had mine for about six months now.
never had a problem with it.
everyone i talk to on it says the sound quality is excellent.
from what i can gather from the complaints people have, i've come to (2) conclusions: either they are using lousy phones, or have lousy internet service.
i use a wired phone on mine.
have toyed with the idea of using a wireless but haven't gotten around to it yet.
my internet service is excellent.
so there you are, the (2) variables.
let me say this.
i'm paying $16 dollars a month for local phone service from at&t.
they then charged me $10 a month for (2) hours of long distance service every month, whether i used (2) hours or not (which i don't).
so i dropped the long distance service from at&t and use the magic jack for long distance service only.
since i paid $30 for the magic jack on e-bay and i've had the thing for (6) months, i'm already money ahead.
would i use it as my primary phone, never.
but for long distance service, it's a winner.
