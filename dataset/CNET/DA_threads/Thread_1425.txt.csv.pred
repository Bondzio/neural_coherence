1.1.1	I 've owned the Dell Dimension 4100 I am typing on since 2000 and had very few problems with it .	St
1.1.2	I also understand the last few years have been a downward spiral for quality and customer service , which used to be their strong suites .	St
1.1.3	I need a new desktop and wondered if Dell has pulled their heads out of their butts yet to keep other makers like HP from taking away their market share further .	St
1.1.4	I 'm trying to take some of the current bad stuff written about Dell with a grain of salt .	St
1.1.5	I realize they sell a lot of computers , so they 're going to get a larger number of complaints , but percentage of machines sold that are problems are more important than sheer numbers .	St
1.1.6	Besides , unhappy people are more likely to post than satisfied ones .	St
1.1.7	Given the state of things here in June 2008 , would anyone recommend an XPS 420 ?	Ques
1.1.8	I understand they are supposed to have their own support division .	St
1.2.1	The market has called for ever lower prices so this means support must transition to non-humans and underpaid staffers .	St
1.2.2	We also have Windows itself to contend with as it 's issues continue to this day .	St
1.2.3	Then is no panacea and nothing that appears to be changing this trend .	St
1.2.4	But the hardware looks to be no better or worse than any other maker as I am surrounded by a few hundred dell laptops at the moment .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	There are periodically studies/reports of repair rates .	St
1.3.2	The last I read for desktops had HP/Compaq and Acer/Gateway as top .	St
1.3.3	They all flip-flop and are n't all that far from each other .	St
1.3.4	Dell 's pretty middle of the pack when it comes to quality .	St
1.3.5	World-wide they retain good marketshare .	St
1.3.6	My problems with Dell were more a symptom of being mail-order , getting DOA computer and having to ship it back , wasting a lot of time I did n't have .	St
1.3.7	The XPS 420 and others in that line impressed me as being pretty complete machines and a good value .	St
1.4.1	You have to decide on any merits any OEM maker has nowadays .	St
1.4.2	it changes often and what maybe good to you could easily be offset by another user .	St
1.4.3	The point being , it really does n't matter in the long run , so read the fine print and have any problems act on them quickly and note them down .	St
1.4.4	Often , you can do slightly better buying or doing DIY project or have a 3rd party build one .	St
1.4.5	The parts are generic enough across the board so buy what best fits your needs As for XPS systems , they are nothing more than warmed over basic systems .	St
1.4.6	They offer nothing really special other than maybe support and the package deal .	St
1.4.7	Again , 3rd party builders pretty much offer the system .	St
1.4.8	If available in your area , Best Buy , Fry 's , etc .	St
1.4.9	offer OEM type systems and at least if a problem crops-up you can return to the store before the real OEM warranty kicks-in .	St
1.4.10	Heck , even Wal-mart offers systems that have prices hard to beat and offer similar specs as well .	St
1.4.11	good luck tada -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.5.1	When I started thinking about a new computer a year or so ago I thought of the DIY route .	St
1.5.2	I looked over a few tutorials and parts over at Newegg .	St
1.5.3	I think I could build one just fine , my problem would be being my own Tech Support .	St
1.5.4	The idea of syncing RAM , configuring a RAID setup , and a couple other things freaked me out a little too .	St
1.5.5	I may drop into BB and see what they 've got .	St
1.5.6	Another route I thought of was Costco , which sells Dell with I believe a 90 day No Questions return policy .	St
1.6.1	Given the thread started with concerns about reliability and support , DIY is not a good topic to consider .	St
1.6.2	If something goes wrong , you 're left troubleshooting and putting humpty-dumpty together again .	St
1.6.3	Best Buy has Geek Squad right there , so they 'll be able to help with stuff .	St
1.6.4	I dunno if they have any XPS 420 , but I 'm sure they 've something comparable in Dell or another brand .	St
1.6.5	You wo n't even necessarily pay more than you would for DIY .	St
1.6.6	But the advantage of DIY is you build it exactly the way you want it , rather than settling for the configurations that are supplied in a store .	St
1.6.7	My car needed its oil changed .	St
1.6.8	I know how to change my oil , and could have gone to an auto-parts store .	St
1.6.9	But instead I went to Jiffy Lube and got some reading done as they did the job in 1/4 of the time it 'd have taken me ( not to mention I garage-saled my jackstands and all that junk years ago ) .	St
1.7.1	http : //news.cnet.com/8301-13555_3-9956616-34.html sums this up well .	St
1.8.1	LOL !	St
1.8.2	I used to change the oil in my truck every 3000 .	St
1.8.3	Then we bought a 4Runner and my wife wanted to go to a Jiffy Lube type place , so I thought what the heck , one less vehicle to mess with .	St
1.8.4	Now , with a 3 1/2 year old I love bringing the car into someplace and let someone else climb under the thing , not to mention getting rid of the old oil !	St
1.8.5	I digress ... point well taken .	St
1.8.6	I just wondered at the beginning what people 's experience has been with Dell 's quality of hardware and tech support ( if needed , and I 'm sure with Vista I 'll need a little ! )	St
1.8.7	were like in current terms , not the awful stories I heard a year or more ago .	St
1.8.8	I would probably enjoy a DIY ( if I really had the time , but when thiings go wrong is where I know I do n't have the time nor expertise .	St
