<s> Hi, I want to buy a external hard drive, but I have 1 question I am buying the external hard drive for the gameplay video's I make. </s>
<s> I use a notebook, and a notebook doesn't have a big hard drive. </s>
<s> So i want to save the movies directly on my external hard drive. </s>
<s> For a fast transfer I will buy a external hard drive with USB 3.0 Now i want to know if more RPM makes a faster transfer from PC to external hard drive? </s>
<s> Makes 7200 RPM a faster transfer then 5400 RPM? </s>
<s> Greetings, Noobie ^^ </s>
<s> I don't think that matters much, if at all, even with USB 3. </s>
<s> May I give you a warning? </s>
<s> Experience has proven that external hard disks are quite unreliable and error prone. </s>
<s> Too many members here thought they could be used as storage, forgot about a backup (a copy on one or two other media) and lost everything. </s>
<s> So better buy 2 disks and copy to both. </s>
<s> Three would be even better, especially if you keep the third one on a safe place outside of your home or office (or where-ever those 3 other disks are). </s>

<s> While there would be some improvement, it's not going to rock your world sorta thing. </s>
<s> You'll be better off using a desktop and having an int. </s>
<s> HD that accessing a 10,000RPM HD. </s>
<s> That would be better but again, that's a hard major investment. </s>
<s> Under your circumstances, you might be better served having a NAS setup, not only for work but immediate storage and minor back-up. </s>
<s> You may want to look into SSD setups as well, speed here is greater overall but that's only an idea I'll throw out there. </s>
<s> Back-up should be an important consideration on top of any initial movie storage. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I am thinking you are right Kees, using USB3 on a notebook, the notebook would have to be USB3 compliant, speed increase negligible. </s>
<s> IF however a firewire or ESATA drive were used, there should be an increase in transfer rate, but the notebook would have to have the hook ups. </s>
