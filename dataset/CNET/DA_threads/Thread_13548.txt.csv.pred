1.1.1	I'm am fixing up an old computer to put in my barn to have access to my dairy goat herd records.	St
1.1.2	Currently I have to print out files and write everything down and transcribe in onto my main computer (when I remember).	St

1.1.5	I currently have my two home office computers networked.	St
1.1.6	I want to add my new/old barn computer to the Network and actually use the barn computer as a &quot;terminal&quot; to access my main computer, using the wonderful RealVNC software ( http://www.realvnc.com/ ) that I use to access my main computer when I am out of town.	St

1.1.14	My main computer runs Windows XP.	St
