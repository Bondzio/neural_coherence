1.1.1	What would make several unrelated programs try to access the IP used by my router : CCleaner , MS Word , Windows Media Player , and Java Platform SE .	St
1.1.2	My router is the D-Link model DIR-655 gigabit & quot ; draft N. & quot ; I 've been using it for a month without a single hiccup .	St
1.1.3	However , in the past week , my firewall ( ZoneAlarm ) has been showing me occasional requests by the programs I mentioned to access my router 's IP , 192.168.0.1 .	St
1.1.4	I 've been replying to the ZoneAlarm access requests with one-time denials and my systems and these programs seem to be functioning just fine , as best as I can tell .	St
1.1.5	At first I did n't pay much attention to these access requests .	St
1.1.6	But since these requests have continued to pop-up periodically ( perhaps once or twice each day ) , I decided to note which programs were trying to do this because this behavior seems odd to me ; however , note that I 'm no networking guru .	St
1.1.7	Does anyone know whether this behavior is normal ?	Ques
1.1.8	If it is normal , can you please offer a sentence or two to explain ?	Ques
1.1.9	And if this behavior is not normal , do you have a clue as to why these programs want to access my router ?	Ques
1.1.10	By the way , a login password for the router has been assigned .	St
1.1.11	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	& quot ; CCleaner , MS Word , Windows Media Player , and Java Platform SE. & quot ; ALL of these check for updates when they run .	St
1.2.2	That 's not something to be alarmed about .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
