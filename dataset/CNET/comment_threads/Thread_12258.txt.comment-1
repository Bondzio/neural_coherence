my wife bought an iBook that she uses in her elder care business.
the unit is used so going to a retailer is out of the question.
i've decided to help her get connected at various hot spots and have been having difficulty with the airport subsystem.
the iBook runs OS X 10.2.8 (6R73), with 256 memory, and a processor speed of 700 MHz (PowerPC G3).
Airport does not access a local hot spot that my desktop pc (Gateway G6 450, running Windows XP Professional and using a Linksys Wireless-B PCI Adapter) easily does.
The airport continues to show &quot;server not found&quot; message.
how do i set up this airport user?
thanks.
