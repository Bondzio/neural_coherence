1.1.1	I installed 512k RAM yesterday and did not have the chip in totally .	St
1.1.2	Long story short , when i turned it back on smoke started to come from the motherboard .	St
1.1.3	I unplugged it immediately and after a few more tries got it fully in and it turned on with no problem .	St
1.1.4	Those few tries involved some beeping and a few odd sounds .	St
1.1.5	So it worked fine last night and this morning I was listening to internet radio and it just turned off .	St
1.1.6	I restarted and ten minutes later the screen turned multi-colored .	St
1.1.7	I started it again and backed up what I could and left it defragging this AM .	St
1.1.8	Am I totally screwed ?	Ques
1.1.9	My comp is only 6 months old but I had no idea you could fry your MB by not putting the chip in fully .	St
1.1.10	I was fully grounded .	St
1.1.11	I thought that was the only concern .	St
1.1.12	Am I out the money ?	Ques
1.2.1	Yes , this can be costly .	St
1.2.2	But in most cases , if a desktop , repair can be just the motherboard and/or CPU .	St
1.2.3	The reason why an incorrectly inserted board or part can fry components is simple .	St
1.2.4	Power is on some of the pins and the partial/incorrectly inserted part can send power to pins that ca n't take power .	St
1.2.5	A tactical error on your part is to run DEFRAG on a possibly damaged machine .	St
1.2.6	This is a great TEST of the hardware , but can result in a scrambled hard disk .	St
1.2.7	Installing the OS can outstrip most user skills .	St
1.2.8	Best of luck in your repairs .	St
1.2.9	Bob	St
1.3.1	& quot ; Defrag..This is a great TEST of the hardware , but can result in a scrambled hard disk .	St
1.3.2	Installing the OS can outstrip most user skills. & quot ; Well ... too late now .	St
1.3.3	That really sux !	St
1.3.4	What does installing the OS do ?	Ques
1.3.5	I did not quite understand your comment .	St
1.3.6	Should I do that ?	Ques
1.3.7	Like a restore ?	Ques
1.4.1	Your response shows that dealing with scrambled hard disk contents may outstrip your current PC repair skills .	St
1.4.2	In short , installing an OS is a series of steps that for Microsoft Windows is vaguely documented and does n't seem to be repeatable across your machine and others .	St
1.4.3	In the end , the result is usually you flip the machine on and you see & quot ; Windows. & quot ; Or the OS you elected to install ... What you do next depends on what you need to do and your capability .	St
1.4.4	In your first post , it was unclear if the machine finally died .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Does it still work ?	Ques
1.5.2	Yes .	St
1.5.3	Sorry , i left it still on this AM defragging .	St
1.5.4	It has come back on each time I tried .	St
1.5.5	So it is working as far as I left it two hrs ago .	St
1.5.6	I am extremely inexperienced .	St
1.5.7	I had installed RAM before but I guess you ca n't win them all .	St
1.5.8	So istalling a new MB would be a bad idea for me , yes ?	Ques
1.5.9	Well , if I continue to use it until I can get someone to look at it am I causing furthur damage .	St
1.5.10	Should I just leave it off ?	Ques
1.6.1	In no uncertain words , I would not put a stick into a machine I am not willing to sacrifice to test the stick ...	St
1.6.2	If the machine works , then you can just use it .	St
1.6.3	My note about defragging being a dangerous idea swirls around other people that had bad ram and during defragmenting ( with known bad ram ) they ended up with a nonbooting system .	St
1.6.4	After such problems , defragging is best just put off till you know the system is healthy .	St
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	Well , I know i am in over my head here .	St
1.7.2	I would have no worries if it had not shut off ( once it went blank and once the screen scrambled ) twice within ten minutes this morning .	St
1.7.3	Yes , it restarted each time , but I figure it will keep shutting off sporadically .	St
1.7.4	So I have read that you take each card out except video and test the computer to find out if it is the MB or a card you fried .	St
1.7.5	Maybe I should find an expert to look at it .	St
1.7.6	But a new dell 2400 cost about $ 350 .	St
1.7.7	Would it be worth it to buy a new MB and have it installed professionally ?	Ques
1.7.8	TESting RAM ?	Ques
1.7.9	BTW , I never knew you had to test RAM .	St
1.7.10	I had an old system around the house but it was n't the same so I figured the RAM would not work in it .	St
1.7.11	I got it from Crucial so I figured it would be good RAM .	St
1.7.12	Maybe good ram , bad operator ... .	Polite
1.8.1	That 's where shops and people with spare parts have it over the average owner .	St
1.8.2	They can swap an item out and see if that 's it .	St
1.8.3	As to TESTING RAM , my comment was what to do with that stick .	St
1.8.4	I rarely have to test new RAM and in fact , do n't .	St
1.8.5	My comment was that if a stick of RAM was subjected to such an event , then I would not want to try it in another machine unless it was a GUINEA PIG or SHOP SPECIAL that we use to test parts in .	St
1.8.6	Usually its some offbeat lintball of parts that if it smokes , we have n't lost anything of value .	St
1.8.7	At 350 bucks , you will find it difficult to beat that if the motherboard and CPU is toast and you have to pay the TECH and SHOP fees as well .	St
1.8.8	In the meantime , pull the cover off and make sure the CPU heatsink is in place and all fans are spinning ... Bob	St
1.9.1	.	St
1.9.2	;	St
1.10.1	& quot ; In the meantime , pull the cover off and make sure the CPU heatsink is in place and all fans are spinning ... & quot ; Ok , what is the heatsink ?	Ques
1.10.2	I know where the fan is and can check that .	St
1.10.3	BTW , could I use hardware like CD-RW drive , floppy drive , etc in my new machine .	St
1.10.4	Or are they damaged ?	Ques
1.10.5	Thank you for helping me out .	St
1.11.1	I have a question for R. Profit regarding defragging .	St
1.11.2	What about third party defrag programs like Voptme or Diskkeeper ( any version ) would you recommend defrag only after system is working normally .	St
1.11.3	I 'm curious as to how this affects a system in a bad way .	St
1.12.1	My note about defragging on a suspect or damaged PC is not what I find to be an issue with normal machines .	St
1.12.2	I note it since I 've seem people report a memory error , then they defragment and we never see them again ... Bob	St
