i got the same answer from dell about the a960 printer--only dell cartridges fit.
i did a search on dell printer cartridges and found a web site &quot;http:// that identified that the printers are made by lexmark, but they keyed the print cartridges differently for dell.
therefore only dell cartridges will fit or the 4inkjet.com claims to make a refill kit for that printer.
i plan to check compusa, bestbuy, and staples local stores.
i complained to the salesperson who could care less about my complaint.
good luck.
