<s> The last time I purchased a computer was 6 years ago. </s>
<s> I am ready to buy a new one. </s>
<s> I know that Dell, Gateway, and Apple have done a lot and there has been a lot of tech progress since then. </s>
<s> Any thoughts on who is doing it better. </s>
<s> I don't want to do anything special, I just want to play a few games (though sound and speed are important to me), maintain my MP3s, keep track of my bank accounts and credit cards, and write documents and spread sheets when I need to. </s>
<s> I want an OS and computer that is compatable with most software and hardware (like cameras, printers, etc). </s>
<s> I don't have kids and kids don't come to my house, so parent controls do not impress me. </s>
<s> I would prefer to use XP as the OS due to all the complaints I still hear about Vista. </s>
<s> I lean more to the side of PC only because that is what I am used to, but I am open to arguments from both sides. </s>
<s> I heard that new thin laptop from Mac can run Windows somehow, but I don't have information on that. </s>
<s> If that is true, I would like that in a desktop. </s>
<s> I guess I should say I would like a desktop not a laptop. </s>
<s> I am willing to spend up to $2500 (including a monitor). </s>
<s> Your thoughts and suggestions are greatly needed and appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> You're describing very common tasks, and quite basic needs. </s>
<s> It might help if you could say what the &quot;few games&quot; are like. </s>
<s> If those games are Call of Duty 4 and Flight Sim X it has different implications for choosing a computer than if it's Sims or if it's Hold 'em Poker. </s>
<s> I'm thinking Windows because of your desires to be compatible with all software. </s>
<s> Macs are pretty easy to work with all hardware, but software is much more restricted. </s>
<s> For the things you've described there's really no reason to be frightened of Vista. </s>
<s> It's great fun to rant against Microsoft, but in the reality of choosing a computer system you want something that works and is compatible. </s>
<s> It seems as though you're a person who keeps the same computer for a long time. </s>
<s> Moreover, you can't buy XP computers in stores - it takes special order or build it yourself or go to a custom-building store. </s>
<s> XP has rec'd its last service pack, is officially discontinued at the end of this month, and won't let you do everything you might like 5-6 years from now. </s>
<s> For example, DirectX 10 (the graphics system for games) is Vista-only. </s>
<s> If you look thru these forums you'll see posts by people who are moving to Vista because they can't run all that they want on XP anymore. </s>
<s> MP3s, banking, word-processing & spreadsheets, photos. </s>
<s> Anyone who has troubles with those kinds of tasks in Vista isn't having the problems because of Vista -- that's the basic stuff which was ironed out a year and a half ago. </s>
<s> Yes, some people have troubles doing basic tasks on computers (everytime I go to my mother's I make the clock on her DVD player quit flashing midnight--trust me, it's not the DVD's fault). </s>
<s> Yes people complain about Vista, just as they did about XP and ME -- but you need to look at real issues vs recreational belly-aching. </s>
<s> Where I live we kvetch about the weather. </s>
<s> But in reality, it never snows, it never gets hot, we never have dangerous storms, ... Apple: All current Macs can also run Windows if you want. </s>
<s> A top of the line iMac is $1800 US dollars. </s>
<s> With a XP or Vista operating system and all your software you could still stay under $2500. </s>
<s> The advantages of MacOS vs Windows are freedom from all those virus concerns, stuff that works well without searching for drivers and all, and a really elegant operating system. </s>
<s> It's certainly capable of what you described wanting to do. </s>
<s> On the other hand, the top iMac or any $2500 computer system kinda feels like having a very fancy luxury car when all you want to do is drive to the grocery store and back. </s>
<s> A quite capable Windows computer that does all you described can be had for under $1000 for the hardware. </s>
<s> Pay to have it set up so you don't have to wrestle with OS tasks, buy all your software, and you're still a good bit under budget. </s>
<s> squirtlewa makes a lot of valid points relevant to the things you want to do with this computer. </s>
<s> My understanding is you want a desktop however for mobility around the house, you may want to consider a comparable laptop. </s>
<s> However, I feel the iMac desktop by Apple is a beautiful, aesthetically pleasing device. </s>
<s> And I don't have one, haha. </s>
<s> It would run about $500-$800 more if you decided to go with a Apple Powerbook with a 17&quot; or 15&quot; screen. </s>
<s> The iMac doesn't include the tower unit as a typical PC does. </s>
<s> My experience has always been Windows. </s>
<s> I like one theory I have heard, &quot;Windows for business, Apple for home.&quot; Apple just seems more pleasant to use in terms of online banking, web browsing, picture and other media management. </s>
<s> The only downside to purchasing a Mac now is you would have to purchase Microsoft Word again if you wish to use it on the Mac. </s>
<s> The PC and Mac versions of software are different so that can be a negative when transitioning. </s>
<s> The Apple learning curve doesn't seem great. </s>
<s> If you can work a Windows PC, you can figure out a Mac in a short time. </s>
<s> I find it more pleasing to just generally use in home management. </s>
<s> iLife is a nice suite of software that again, makes visually pleasing documents. </s>
<s> The main feature I like of the iMac is you really get your money's worth for $2500. </s>
<s> I estimated a 24&quot; iMac with lots of software, 4GB RAM, 300 GB hard drive, and a 2.4GHZ processor for around that. </s>
<s> And because you don't seem to be doing high end graphic editing or things like that, about $1500-$2000 would get you a great PC that would respond sufficiently to your tasks. </s>
<s> I hope this helps, I look forward to hearing your decision! </s>
<s> So lucky, my finance is laying the hammer down and not letting me get mine for a little while. </s>
<s> Sigh..... </s>
<s> Let's talk software first. </s>
<s> The software you're asking for definitely exists for both the Mac and Windows. </s>
<s> The game selection isn't quite as broad, but I gather you're not about to play very demanding games if your last computer held out for six years! </s>
<s> Many casual and puzzle games are made for both platforms; you just need to know where to look, and not all of the great ones for the Mac come in a physical box. </s>
<s> Financial and office software is there, too. </s>
<s> You can get Quicken for the Mac if you need it, but there's also software like iBank ( http://www.iggsoftware.com/ibank/ ) and a number of other alternatives. </s>
<s> Of course, Microsoft Office is available for the Mac, and if you don't need to feel reassured by using Microsoft's apps, you can buy Apple's own iWork 08 for less. </s>
<s> Its files can be saved in an MS Office-compatible format. </s>
<s> Cameras and printers will work very smoothly on a Mac; you may actually prefer iPhoto and iMovie for editing your work, particularly if you want to create DVDs for family or upload videos to YouTube. </s>
<s> Microsoft's free apps are still fairly limited in this regard, and the bundled apps with some cameras don't usually do much better. </s>
<s> As for running Windows on a Mac: any modern Mac can do it, but you need to buy a separate copy of Windows (quite obviously, Apple would like you to use their software first). </s>
<s> There's a utility on Macs called Boot Camp that lets you set aside some of your hard drive for Windows and lets you choose whether you start the computer up in Mac OS X Leopard or Windows. </s>
<s> You can also buy third-party software that will run Windows within Mac OS X. </s>
<s> That said, don't buy a Mac just to run Windows! </s>
<s> You'd miss a lot of the advantages of the Mac if you did. </s>
<s> One thing most Windows PCs lack is clever design. </s>
<s> The iMac is great as a compact all-in-one computer; no tower to hog your floor, cleverly hidden speakers, and built-in wireless. </s>
<s> You can get all-in-one Windows PCs, but even now they're usually slower for the money than the iMac (I'm not kidding - I've checked) and in my experience just aren't as well sorted out in terms of how the hardware and software play together. </s>
<s> I personally use a 24-inch iMac ($1800) and love it, and it's the one I'd recommend if you're doing a lot of photo and video editing; if not, a standard 20-inch model ($1200) will probably be more than enough. </s>
<s> I really meant what I said that the 24&quot; iMac would be great and match the budget with software included. </s>
<s> Fast, elegant, easy, lots of capabilities in case the users decide to expand what they do on a computer. </s>
<s> I own a Mac and like the OS a lot. </s>
<s> A $2.5k budget for typical computing needs is kinda like driving a luxury car for your commute. </s>
<s> But I'll be honest -- whereas I drive a little hybrid, I know I'd be more comfy in a Lexus or Benz. </s>
<s> That's the way I'm looking at it squirt. </s>
<s> For $2500, you are going to get a good computer. </s>
<s> I could easily build a &quot;more-hardware-than-necessary&quot; with $2500 whether its Apple or Mac. </s>
<s> When it comes down to it, PCs give you more bloat software when you get them that you'll end up removing anyway. </s>
<s> (Dell and HP are notorious for this, as well as Sony.) </s>
<s> Apple will give you some software, but its useful. </s>
<s> For me it comes down to aesthetics. </s>
<s> For the money, you'll get a good computer either way you go, just make sure you have the necessary RAM and Hard Drive space, as well as other things you may need. </s>
<s> But for a home or office set up, the iMac is just more pleasing to look at. </s>
<s> Walt Mossberg has a good article comparing a Dell's XPS all-in-one with Apple's iMac. </s>
<s> That would be where I turn if I weren't going iMac and wanted an all-in-one. </s>
<s> Check it out and hope it helps! </s>
<s> (Note: Mossberg has been known to have some Apple favorability in the past. </s>
<s> Take that into account.) </s>
<s> http://ptech.allthingsd.com/20071227/dells-all-in-one-pc-has-the-guts-design-to-compete-with-imac/ </s>
<s> Wow, everything you all have said has really given me some things to think about. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> .maybe making it harder to choose. </s>
<s> That being said, if you took away how &quot;pretty&quot; the Macs are, dollar for dollar, which one is better and gives you more value for your money? </s>
<s> Also, if I did go with a Mac, how easy is it to move information and files from a PC to a Mac? </s>
<s> For those who asked what games I play: Sims2 and soon to play Spore. </s>
<s> Thanks to all who have answered so far </s>
<s> In terms of raw performance? </s>
<s> PCs. </s>
<s> If you're more concerned about how many frames per second you get, you can order the right PC that will be faster. </s>
<s> However... </s>
<s> It's not all about frame rate, especially in your case. </s>
<s> Most desktops don't have a built-in webcam, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi, let alone the smaller footprint. </s>
<s> Some of the systems with faster CPUs actually have slower video cards, which hurts the practical performance for games. </s>
<s> There's also the question of security software: while it's always good to be cautious, you simply don't need to run out and install antivirus software the same way you do on Windows (unless you're very knowledgeable) since the Mac is targeted much, much less and is generally less vulnerable. </s>
<s> As for games: you're in luck! </s>
<s> The Sims 2 is already available for the Mac (including multiple expansions), and Spore will be available for the Mac at about the same time as the Windows version. </s>
<s> You can already get the Creature Creator for Mac. </s>
<s> Strictly speaking, the mac laptops are faster than almost anything in the windows world. </s>
<s> For desktops, the same prob'ly holds true, but Mac Pro aren't normal desktops. </s>
<s> iMac 24&quot; has a dual core processor at just over 3 GHz. </s>
<s> That puts it comparable to pretty fast pre-made PCs for most tasks. </s>
<s> I kinda wish they had a quad-core iMac... </s>
<s> I find it easy to go to/from macos to/from windows, actually easier than it's ever been. </s>
<s> Back in the 90s you had to download a lot of plugins to translate file formats. </s>
<s> Nowadays you just &quot;Save As...&quot; </s>
