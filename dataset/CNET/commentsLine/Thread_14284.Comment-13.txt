we have found that there are two reasons for this; 1. running antispyware programs sometimes removes these files autoexec.nt, ntconfig.nt and command.com 2. upgrading to xp sp2 - we are not sure why this knocks out these files but it does... the fix is to replace these three files as stated in a microsoft kb article:  you can also download a quick fix from here that does the trick.
you will need your xp cd ready for either way.
