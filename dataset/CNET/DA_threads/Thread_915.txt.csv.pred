1.1.1	OK so I bought a ViewSonic VX2250WM monitor .	St
1.1.2	I set it up with my desktop and set the resolution at the recommended 1920x1080 .	St
1.1.3	However 2 days later I started getting a pop-up message telling me that the recommended resolution is 1200x1080 , and that I should change my current resolution .	St
1.1.4	When I went to do that my resolution was on 1600x1200 , and my desktop was telling me that this was my highest resolution which obviously is n't true .	St
1.1.5	All my drivers are up to date and trouble shooting reveals no problems ?	Ques
1.1.6	What should I do ?	Ques
1.2.1	It wo n't be the video card driver that determines the native resolution of the monitor .	St
1.2.2	Does your system recognize the monitor by its exact manufacturer and model # ?	Ques
1.2.3	If not , you need the Viewsonic driver installed .	St
1.3.1	As noted , 1200 do not match up with the monitor , hence the pop-up message .	St
1.3.2	I suggest changing the video card setting to as close as possible to 1920x1080 ( but not over that ) .	St
1.3.3	What connection do you use , vga or dvi ?	Ques
