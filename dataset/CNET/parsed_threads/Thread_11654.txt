<s> Hi, first off sorry if is this wrong place was a bit confused where this thread belongs.. </s>
<s> I just need to crimp a RJ11 connector to a heavy duty cat5 cable that can be ran outside and withstand weather. </s>
<s> OR If anyone can direct me to a vendor which sells heavy duty RJ11 cables. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> I exposed some standard interior phone cord to 5 years of New England weather and it's not cracked yet. </s>
<s> Are you sure you need to do this? </s>
<s> Why not just toss it into some PVC pipe if you have animal problems? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> electronics supply store should carry insulated twisted pair cable however many pairs you want. </s>
<s> Tell them you want to bury the cable. </s>
<s> I've done many building-to-building cable jobs using this. </s>
<s> I also have used what Bob's suggested with no problems. </s>
<s> Try cyberguys.com. </s>
