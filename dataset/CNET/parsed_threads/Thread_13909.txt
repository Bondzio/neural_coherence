<s> I have four EIDE hard drives, two of which are in a raid 0 configuration used exclusively for video capture and editing. </s>
<s> The raid is onboard the Motherboard which is shot. </s>
<s> I want to upgrade to an AMD64 CPU and Asus Mobo. </s>
<s> It looks like all of the newer good Mobos use Sata. </s>
<s> Will they accomodate my EIDE drives? </s>
<s> While 90% of my raid 0 data is backed up, I would like to retrieve the other 10%. </s>
<s> Can I plug these drives into a new Mobo's onboard raid? </s>
<s> Will the data be readable? </s>
<s> I assume the drivers will be different. </s>
<s> If that won't work, is there another way to get the data off these presumably good raid drives? </s>
<s> Yes, you could plug them into a new motherboard, BUT that doesn't mean that they will be readable. </s>
<s> At a minimum you will need to be able to use the same stripe size on the new board as was used by the old board to write it. </s>
<s> But there exist a number of variables in how raid is implemented from controller to controller. </s>
<s> Depending on how the raid controller implements the raid, you may or may not be able to do this. </s>
<s> If you really, truly, need the data, try it, but be prepared to take the drives to a data recovery service. </s>
<s> Since the drives are operational (presumably), the price is likely to be acceptable, were the drives &quot;toasted&quot; in any way, the use of &quot;forensics&quot; to recover the data would probably be prohibitive. </s>
