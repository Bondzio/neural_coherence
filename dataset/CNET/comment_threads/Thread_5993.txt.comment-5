The IDE cable is definitely a master, with the end of the cable used.
The hard drive isn't the problem, as I've never installed anything onto it before.
In order to install something on it~I need a disc drive that reads discs.
Right?
I've tried a USB memory stick and it didn't boot either.
I've got someone to lend me a Sata DVD burner.
As the motherboard is naturally SATA-II anyway.
Thinking on it, I've come to the conclusion that it must be the ancient technology that the motherboard simply doesn't recognize without the drivers.
If there is anything in between that might help~ Like, I haven't installed the BIOS drivers yet, because it can't read the discs to get the drivers.
