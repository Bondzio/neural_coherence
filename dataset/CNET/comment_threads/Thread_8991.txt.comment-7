Thanks,I have all those drivers up and running.
I did download the driver from Intl for the wireless card, like Steve said, and it seem to do the trick.
The yellow question mark is gone, replaced by a Intel PRO wireless adapter.
It is now able to see my wireless connection and lets me in, but now it can't seem to aquire a IP address.
Do you know what I need to do for this.
