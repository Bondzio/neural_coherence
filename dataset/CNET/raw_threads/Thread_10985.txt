(I figured you needed to get a glimpse of a decent midrange power pc base component profile)...... Toss in an Inwin or Enlight case (with a front intake fan/extra rear/exhaust fan), CD burner(Lite-On), DVD burner(Lite-On), extra hard drive if you wish, your ''old'' floppy (and burner if you would rather instead of purchasing a new one), ''maybe'' a plug-in soundcard, extra USB/Firewire ports and (although I still prefer Win2KPro-stable, stable, stable OS) a copy of Win XP Pro. This system would be stable (well matched/compatible components), fast and dependable(quality components).

AMD is coming out with a new socket. that will chnage everything. Intel has defintly taken the road of targeting the everyday user, offering high numbers to put on the boxes. which is great for e-mail, and internet, and other lightload processes. but AMD has the gaming demographic. they make superior cpus for gaming. no doubt. they are coming out with a new socket. i guarntee they will abandon the old 939. which in turn is going to change the motherboards. there also is a new case configuartion on the horizion. BTX, buy a case that BTX capable. I have OCZ RAM. it's great, but there is considerably cheaper ram out there. I suggest 2 gigs. as most new games can run on 512, but it sucks you need at least one gig. soon games are going to need more. Dual core also is a factor. i suggest a dual core processor as new games are going to take advantage of this.as for a HD, i suggest a raptor. if you are not going to store media on your computer a 36 gb raptor is by far the way to go. if you need another HD later. HD are getting cheap. and also PCI for the video card. And a video card is important. I like EVGA, more expensive but the EVGA is qaulity. I suggest saving and buying a good system. I started with a &quot;budget&quot; system and was greatly disappionted. My next system was the realm of 3k. I have never been happier. seems like a lot of dough. but the truth is pc gaming is a expensive hobby. but worth it. i hated the rough presentation of consoles. so if a pc is where your hearts at. start saving. with computers, the generic brands and cheaper componets preform like cheap componets.

I also included general prices if you were planning to build. You could get by with less, but you'd probably be disappointed or need to upgrade in a few months. CPU: AMD Athlon 64 3000+ ($125) or Intel Pentium D 805 ($135) PCI Express motherboard (no AGP!): nVidia nForce4 SLI chipset ($80) or Intel 945G chipset ($90) 1GB RAM: DDR-400 for AMD ($70) or DDR2-533 for Intel ($75) 250GB SATA Hard Drive: WD, Seagate, Hitachi, or Samsung ($90) 256MB video card: nVidia 7600GS GPU ($140) or ATI X1600XT GPU ($150) If you were building this from scratch you would also add: Case & Power Supply: Antec SLK with 350W PS ($85) or similar Floppy: Mitsumi combo with media reader ($20) DVD: LG, LiteOn, NEC, Sony 16x burner ($45) Keyboard/Mouse: Logitech ($30) OS: Win XP Media Center ($115) Speakers: hundreds of choices from $30 and up
