1.1.1	I recently tried to setup a VoIP telephone through my wireless network , but experienced a major problem : According to Uniden , the people who make the phone , the phone needs to be wired directly into the router or modem .	St
1.1.2	However , the modem is not in the office , where the phone needs to be .	St
1.1.3	I was able to get the phone to connect to the network in the office by plugging it into a computer on the wireless network , and telling Microsoft Windows to bridge the wireless and LAN connections .	St
1.1.4	However , when I began using the phone , the call would frequently cut out .	St
1.1.5	Someone told me this is because the wireless is not fast enough to relay the voice signal .	St
1.1.6	However , the computers on the network have used voip programs like Skype without any lags or cut outs .	St
1.1.7	Is it possible that the delay is being caused by the windows bridge ?	Ques
1.1.8	In short , if I get a wireless bridge from D-Link/Netgear/Linksys , and plug the phone into that instead of the windows computer , will it eliminate the problem ?	Ques
1.1.9	The computer is running Windows XP SP2 and the wireless network runs off a D-Link DI-524 wireless router ( the network is a wireless G network ) .	St
1.1.10	Thank you for any help , svz90	St
1.2.1	Stray off the beaten path and there is no support .	St
1.2.2	I used such a system for awhile and found that over wifi it was too unreliable .	St
1.2.3	I moved to another system later in which I wired the voip to the router and that worked fairly well .	St
1.2.4	I do n't expect anyone to tell you that this or that will work since wifi is subject to a lot of interference .	St
1.2.5	I decline from writing much about this interference since I 'd be duplicating web content .	St
1.2.6	This is likely why it cuts out .	St
