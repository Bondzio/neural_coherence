<s> ok, i got a deal on a compusa house brand dvd drive with lightscribe a few months ago . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> works pretty well but lately i have been getting a lot of bad burns. </s>
<s> &quot;burn failed&quot; etc etc . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> granted my software is not great, VERY old sonic recordnow and now a slightly dated copy of nero. </s>
<s> but they were working well enough up til recently. </s>
<s> i also had a failed lightscribe label burn once. </s>
<s> I am using various media, altho the sony CD's i have here are the worst offenders. </s>
<s> so i don't know if it's a bad stack of blank disks or the drive. </s>
<s> any way to test a drive to see if it's dying? </s>
<s> thanks - fj </s>
<s> A cd/dvd lens cleaner then reduce the burn speed to at least 1/2 the rated media speed or 1/2 the recorder's max speed whichever is less. </s>
<s> As to tests there aren't many. </s>
<s> If playback is an issue I use a GEEXBOX cd to test. </s>

<s> Well this may sound odd, but I had the same problem happen to me, I was getting more and more failed burns, but on both of my DVD burners. </s>
<s> So I was sure it was something else going on. </s>
<s> What I found that fixed my problem was to clean up my computer, I ran a regcleaner and removed any old programs/files/temp files. </s>
<s> This did not fix it. </s>
<s> Then I defragged the HD and this is what fixed my problem. </s>
<s> By the way I have also had problems with Sony discs in the past. </s>
<s> I now buy the Fry's cheap (always on sale) brand and have had no problems with them. </s>
<s> Also you may want to see if your DVD burner has an updated flash BIOS available. </s>
<s> I updated my Emprex (which is really a BTC), to allow more types of media to work. </s>
<s> One other thing, you may want to turn on verify after burn in Nero for awile until you are sure everything is working. </s>
<s> Its a bummer to find out your backup is no good. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> Nero Six and Seven have a tools section that can test both the drive & Discs </s>
<s> When you start to see bad burn's and have also problems reading, it is usually caused by a dirty lens in your optical drive. </s>
<s> In a house/office where people smoke, you will have to clean your lens every 2 weeks. </s>
<s> The smoke does the same as on your lungs, the lense get covered with e layer of tar or whatever the brown gunge is. </s>
<s> Manufacturers used to suggest to clean the optics after every 8 hours of use, although this is a bit too frequent I think. </s>
<s> Normally once a month - depending on how much you use it - will do fine. </s>
<s> I find it unbelievable that so few people do maintenance on their equipment and perhaps it is because these things have become so cheap. </s>
<s> Still, using a good cleaning disc for these optical drives cost around the 5$ and it still cheaper than a new drive and can be used many times. </s>
<s> I also saves you the job to open up your system to replace the drive. </s>
<s> The good cleaning disc's have like 2 &quot;false eyelashes&quot; stuck to it. </s>
<s> You can even find then in the superstores in the CD section or at Radio Shack's. </s>
<s> If the drive has been a long time in use without maintenace you might have to clean it manually, but that is more for a tecnician to do as you would have to take the drive apart. </s>
<s> Also cleaning up and unfragmenting your system as mentioned before does wonders on improving speed to supply the data to your writer. </s>
<s> The Nero tools can help to diagnose, but do not fix anything. </s>
<s> Best of luck. </s>
