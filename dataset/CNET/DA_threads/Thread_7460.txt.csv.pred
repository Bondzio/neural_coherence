1.1.1	So I recently purchased high-speed and networked my house .	St
1.1.2	One of my computers is running Windows 98FE , so I have this hooked up to my network with a wireless ethernet bridge .	St
1.1.3	However , my computer did not come with an ethernet port , so I had to install one .	St
1.1.4	I bought the Linksys Etherfast ethernet card that is supposed to work with even 95 .	St
1.1.5	However , the cd linksys included only had the drivers for Windows XP on it .	St
1.1.6	The linksys people told me to download the 98 drivers from their website so I did .	St
1.1.7	I installed them , but ever since I did so , my computer will freeze up after I close internet explorer ( browsing the internet works fine though ) .	St
1.1.8	I can think of two possible reasons why this is happening : 1 .	St
1.1.9	The drivers on linksys ' website were for version 5.0 of the card , but my card is version 5.2 .	St
1.1.10	The linksys people told me these drivers would work , but some of them are n't so bright so I would n't be surprised if they were wrong .	St
1.1.11	2 .	St
1.1.12	The 98 drivers from linksys ' website are meant for windows 98 SE .	St
1.1.13	If that is the case , should I try to install it using the drivers for windows 95 ( I heard the 98 FE is more similar to 95 than it is to 98 SE ) .	St
1.1.14	Do either of these sound right or is there something else that is wrong ?	Ques
1.1.15	Also , is there somewhere I can buy an ethernet card that is SURE to work with 98 FE ( i am sick of dealing with linksys ' incompatibility with older OSes ) ... like a 3com or intel one or something ?	Ques
1.1.16	And if so , where can I find one ?	Ques
1.2.1	Try the usual cure .	St
1.2.2	Delete all BHO 's from this machine .	St
1.2.3	What 's a BHO ?	Ques
1.2.4	Ask google.com How do I uninstall them ?	Ques
1.2.5	HIJACKTHIS What is HIJACKTHIS ?	Ques
1.2.6	Ask google.com Sorry if I do n't write a long post but its the cure I use .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	do you really think that is the problem ?	Ques
1.3.2	I did n't think it was just a coincidence that it started freezing right after i installed the ethernet card	St
1.4.1	I was offering the usual cure to lockups when we exit IE .	St
1.4.2	Let 's wait for others to offer something else .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Can you get the free SE updates for this one ?	Ques
1.5.2	As well , try to get your hands on an old 3Com 905 series NIC .	St
1.5.3	These had drivers written for Win 98 and they worked .	St
1.5.4	I 've given a box load of these things away and keep a couple handy for troubleshooting or second NICs in XP machines because XP already knows them .	St
1.5.5	Great old board .	St
1.6.1	Do you know where I can get one of those cards ( besides ebay ) ?	Ques
1.6.2	And is that card compatible with FIRST edition ?	Ques
1.6.3	Also , what would be the best NIC card to get for my Windows ME computer ?	Ques
1.7.1	Google search I 'd get the TX or TXNM rather then the M type .	St
1.7.2	NM means & quot ; non-managed & quot ; and M means managed .	St
1.7.3	Some of these managed types needed to have that feature shut off using a DOS utility in order to prevent their BIOS interruption during boot up .	St
1.7.4	These originally carried a price of well over 100 bucks each but you should be able to get one for less than 10 .	St
1.7.5	If you 've got a local builder who does upgrades , I 'm willing to bet these cards pass through his hands regularly .	St
1.7.6	Check with such a shop .	St
1.7.7	I 'd .	St
1.7.8	The drivers are still on the 3Com web site or easily available elsewhere .	St
1.7.9	I 'd say they should work with ME but have no such experience .	St
1.7.10	ME was a later OS and might even have the drivers built in .	St
1.7.11	I was thinking 98SE had the drivers as well and such is why I mentioned the upgrade .	St
1.7.12	The cards will work with the first editions .	St
1.7.13	The reason I suggested this was threefold .	St
1.7.14	I had a lot of experience configuring these and found them better and more reliable than other brands of that era .	St
1.7.15	Many were made in the USA though some came from Singapore and even Ireland .	St
1.7.16	They were sturdy .	St
1.7.17	Lastly , to me it makes good sense some times to use parts of similar vintage .	St
1.7.18	Though you can still buy hardware that & quot ; works & quot ; with Win 98 , I have to question just how much effort went into tuning that driver .	St
1.7.19	Such is why I recommended an older reliable card with an older OS .	St
1.7.20	Good luck .	Polite
1.8.1	If you did n't complete the BHO removal then you are likely going to repeat this issue again .	St
1.8.2	The issue I note is well known , and easy to fix .	St
1.8.3	Also you can disprove it in a few minutes for free .	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
1.9.1	I rarely use it .	St
1.9.2	You might try a fresh install of Firefox to see if the lockups still happen with it .	Sug
1.9.3	Win 98 is no where near as stable as XP .	St
1.9.4	We 'd have to blow these up and freshly install the OS from time to time as last resorts to unresolved problems .	St
1.9.5	Cleaning out pests often helped but they do come back when using IE frivolously .	St
1.10.1	The BHO removal did n't work .	St
1.10.2	I think it is a driver problem because I am having similar problems after installing the same card on my Windows ME computer .	St
1.10.3	Do those cards on the google search come with the CORRECT drivers ( cough cough , linksys ) on a disk or something ?	Ques
1.11.1	Tell me which motherboard chipset driver you are using .	St
1.11.2	Is it current ?	Ques
1.12.1	How do I find that ?	Ques
1.13.1	When you post the forum asks for details such as make and model of the machine .	St
1.13.2	Given that , members can offer direct links rather than generic answers .	St
1.13.3	Tell a little , get a lot more .	St
1.13.4	Bob	St
1.14.1	I 'm running two Gateway Desktops .	St
1.14.2	One is Windows 98 the other is ME .	St
1.14.3	The 98 is Pentium II , the ME is Pentium III .	St
1.14.4	Do you need anything else ?	Ques
1.15.1	If not , time for a shop to fix this .	St
