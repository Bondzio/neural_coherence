<s> Every time I restart my laptop, a message pops up after I log in saying &quot;S.M.A.R.T has predicted that hard disk 0 may fail soon&quot;. </s>
<s> Is it ok to go ahead and clone this HD onto another? </s>
<s> Or could that cause any problems with a new HD? </s>
<s> If your hard dive is making noise its going to fail soon.I dont think a software can predict that except for the windows one. </s>
<s> My question was: if I close my system to a new HD, would that possible cause any software/OS problems because of my old HD going bad? </s>
<s> If the clone is successful then all your data will be moved to the new HD and be safe. </s>
<s> If the clone is not successful....then you wing it...like maybe try to copy out YOUR STUFF. </s>
<s> If the clone is successful and all your data is nice and safe then you can play with the orig HD......maker's fitness test? </s>
