<s> I bought this HARD DRIVE internal seagate 2TB green caviar last week. </s>
<s> I transferred more or less 1TB size of files to this new hard disk without hassle. </s>
<s> I noticed that when i set this as a directory for my completed downloads in uTorrent, it suddenly disappear on my computer icon. </s>
<s> i check the device manager and it is no longer there. </s>
<s> i also went looking in the storage management but it wasn't there. </s>
<s> I try to restart my PC and it go back to normal. </s>
<s> After this incident, i can no longer transfer file to this new hard drive because it keeps on disappearing and i have to restart my PC over and over again. </s>
<s> Today, the worst thing happen, because it is no longer appearing on my device manager. </s>
<s> pls help me folks. </s>
<s> I've lost count of the troubles what folk get into with torrents. </s>
<s> Sorry to read about your loss. </s>
<s> The thing is, why does my previous 2TB does not affected? </s>
<s> i set this as a directory for almost 6months and it goes well. </s>
<s> Not being in Device Manager might only mean it needs to be repartioned and formatted again. </s>
<s> Only if it's not visible in Disk Management something is wrong. </s>
<s> To see if that something is your PC/OS/settings/malware or that disk, replace it by the old one (your previous 2 GB disk). </s>
<s> If that's OK it's this disk and you should be able to get a new one under warranty. </s>
