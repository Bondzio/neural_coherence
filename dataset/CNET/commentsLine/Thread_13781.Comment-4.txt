you may have two options.
if you can borrow another pc which will allow you to connect your drives and network it to the rental, this might work.
another idea, assuming the rental has usb available might be to get an external drive case and try that with the rental.
this might or might not work.
i have had decent luck putting drives in these cases with data already on them and having them recognized just fine.
some folks haven't been so lucky, however.
it might be worth a try.
you can get these cases in the $30 to $50 dollar range and you can always keep it for later use.
good luck.
