<s> I am looking for the best/cheapest way to get the internet on my television. </s>
<s> I have a ruko for streaming Netflix etc, but I am wanting to be able to watch free videos such as on the network website or from the free tv websites. </s>
<s> I would appreciate any help with this. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> And replaced it with the Logitech Revue. </s>
<s> Now shopping for the Sony Google TV. </s>
<s> Try one of those but these are not PCs. </s>
<s> Some folk are looking for the PC Internet experience. </s>
<s> For that you use a PC. </s>

<s> I have been looking at a LG BD360. </s>
<s> I cannot determine if it will play other video like networks (abc, nbc etc) and free tv. </s>
<s> It sounds to me like it will but do not want to purchase something that will not do what I want. </s>
<s> I looked at your suggestions but doesn't sound like they will let me watch free tv from the web. </s>
<s> I appreciate your response. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> All the free tv from the web is usually dead on BD players. </s>
<s> Unless you get one like the Sony and it plays in the Chrome browser. </s>
<s> Worth a try. </s>
<s> I know I may get it. </s>
