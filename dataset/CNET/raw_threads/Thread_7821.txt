Using Canon Print Preferences window I can set all options except for Print Preview. This worked fine until February when it stopped working. I can preview in all applications (Office 2003 Pro, JASC Paint Shop Pro 9, and in the Preview option of Canon Easy-Web print). I have uninstalled and reinstalled the latest Canon Driver, uninstalled and re-installed Office 2003 but these actions have no effect. Whenever I select the print option from whatever application, I get immediate printing without tha Canon Print Preview screen. Can anyone suggest other options to try? John White
