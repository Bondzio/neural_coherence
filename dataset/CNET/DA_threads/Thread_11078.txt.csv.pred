1.1.1	I have a Dell Dimension 4600 P4 3Ghz 1Gb Ram and i'm looking to upgrade my graphics card to a 6800Gt i have been told i need a new psu existing (250) if this is the case is it just a matter of fitting a new psu or does it have a bigger impact then that i.e will upgrading the psu effect other components of my hardware Thanks in advance	St
1.2.1	your model doesn't have the proprietary power supply that some had.	St
1.2.2	You couldn't just buy another one off the shelf and install it with certain Dells....you had to use one of theirs instead, if I recall correctly.	St
1.2.3	TONI	St
1.3.1	for the Nvidia GeForce 6600GT either in PCIe or AGP versions and you will see it needs more than a 250W power supply.	St
1.3.2	Also in AGP versions of the 6600GT they normally furnish a cable to connect additional power to the power supply.	St
1.3.3	I just bought and installed a new 420W power supply in my PC with thoughts of a 6600GT AGP card pretty soon.	St
1.3.4	Don't have a Dell, but Toni H. is right on....some Dell's especially the old ones need special Power Supply and also special fitting, and some don't.	St
1.4.1	...has sturdy Dell replacements, www.pcpowerandcooling.com	St
1.5.1	More demanding video output are stating at least on thier packaging, &quot;to have 350W p/s&quot;.	St
1.5.2	Having a larger p/s isn't going to hurt the system provided its &quot;doable&quot; as some systems either have propiertory cabling or rewired voltage output, great for thier systems but not &quot;generic&quot; to what typically available.	St
1.5.3	Thus, you need be sure its not only rated to fit and compatible but also be at least 350W or better.	St
1.5.4	Dell, may have an upgrade path from thier wares or not but check.	St
1.5.5	A good vendor to check with is http://www.pcpowerandcooling.com or google for any other vendor.	St
1.5.6	happy USA -----Willy	St
