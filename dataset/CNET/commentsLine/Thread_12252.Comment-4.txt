hi, thanks for the reply.
do you think just leaving the errors alone is ok?
because i have been using the same computer, same board, same hd for about 2 years now and have no major problems.
other than the warning logs in event viewer, the system is showing no sign that any component is failing.
its running at good speed.
no sluggish performance whatsoever.
i don't exactly want to return the board unless the problem becomes 100% noticable.
what do you think?
thanks hope to receive a reply soon
