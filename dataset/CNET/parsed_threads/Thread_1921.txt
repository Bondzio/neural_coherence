<s> Hello, I have a pc and a Mac. </s>
<s> However, I have programs that I use on both. </s>
<s> I've tried using the Flip thing that lets you toggle between the two computers but all it did was cause my Mac to freeze up. </s>
<s> So, I need to know if there is a splitter type of cable that I can use to hook up to the two computers to run off the one flat screen monitor. </s>
<s> Also I need the same kind of cable for my printer. </s>
<s> I searched the forums for a similar thread and couldn't find anything. </s>
<s> Maybe I was using the wrong search words but I could only come up with stuff on using two monitors and one computer. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> Thanks, Donna </s>

<s> if your monitor has both dvi and vga ports, you could connect it to the pc and mac simultanously. </s>
<s> here's a kvm that will switch your monitor between both the pc and mac: http://www.buy.com/prod/trendnet-2-port-usb-kvm-switch-kit-includes-2x-kvm-cables/q/loc/101/202416545.html since you didn't mention sharing your keyboard/mouse, you'll probably be able to plug your printer into the kvm and switch it also. </s>
<s> Thank you R. Proffitt and ramarc for you replies. </s>
<s> The &quot;Flip thing&quot; (my technical term), is actually just called &quot;Flip&quot; and it is made by Belkin. </s>
<s> It is another KVM. </s>
<s> You can see it Here: http://www.belkin.com/flip/ I purchased the Flip, USB with Audio (F1DG102U) that supports both PC's and Macs. </s>
<s> But I ran into problems using this when my computer would go into idle or rest mode. </s>
<s> When I would come back to it, and hit any key or move the mouse, my monitor would be froze on a black screen with an error message that said &quot;no signal found&quot;, or something to that effect. </s>
<s> Causing me to have to re-start my machine. </s>
<s> When I disconnected the Flip the problem ceased. </s>
<s> Maybe the problem was isolated to this particular KVM. </s>
<s> However, I'm concerned that if I purchased another KVM I'll just run into the same problems. </s>
<s> So, there is no &quot;splitter&quot; type of cable that can be used to hook up the two machines? </s>
<s> Thus avoiding the use of a KVM? </s>
<s> As well as a splitter cable for the printer? </s>
<s> Thanks again for your help and time. </s>

<s> did you move the mouse and wait a few second for the computer to come off of sleep? </s>
<s> Yes, I did wait, for a goof 5 minutes or so actually. </s>
<s> I even would get up from the computer and go do something else and come back and it would still be froze. </s>
<s> This was not an isolated event. </s>
<s> It happened allot. </s>
<s> I would disconnect the Flip KVM for a few weeks and the problem would not reoccur. </s>
<s> Then when the KVM was hooked up again the problem would start again. </s>
<s> I assure you, it was not the computer sleeping. </s>
<s> according to the belkin webpage, the F1DG102P does not appear to be compatible with macs. </s>
<s> when you try to 'wake up' the pc do you press the 'flip' twice? </s>
<s> is the problem limited to just the pc or both the pc and the mac? </s>
<s> if it's just the pc, the problem may be with the sleep mode. </s>
<s> some pc's that use s3 mode don't recognize usb activity when asleep. </s>
<s> there's usually a bios setting that corrects the behavior. </s>
