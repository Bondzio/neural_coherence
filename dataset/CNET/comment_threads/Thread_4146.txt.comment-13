adding a second HDD, i have lost all my daata doing things like this before...
The program r-studio 2.0 works and saved my life recovering everything from my delted partition.
Whatever is your slave HDD make sure you move the little plastic thing on the pins in the middle of the hdd plugs (on the back) ninty degrees, so that it is no longer able to recognise that hard drive as a master... you can find out most of the info you need on replcing a HDD on the seagate site: http://www.seagate.com/support/disc/install.html http://www.seagate.com/support/disc/specs/techlib.html
