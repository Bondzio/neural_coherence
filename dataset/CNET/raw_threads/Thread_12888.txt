I offer no cure since we'll have to wait till Redmond issues it but for today I use USB 2.0 for Windows and Firewire connections for Apple machines. Your choice to do otherwise but you may be repeating what others have discovered. Bob

I connect it with USB 2.0 or better yet internally to the IDE connection in a desktop. 2. I try tools like ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY or GETDATABACK. If those show promise and we need the files we pay up. Best of luck, Bob

If you value these files you'll have to wait till you have disk space to copy it off once you get the tools. However some can't wait until they get in the right place, time and tools. In those instances I see most lose it all. The softwares I noted have free demos so it can give you insight to the issue and might give me a clue what other tools could be used. But this issue is dead for now since we can't copy the contents out today. Bob
12358	9	235818	2417674	2417596	21630145999946635326763969088673-vnny463	3/1/07 10:04 AM	1.17274344E12	OK	WELL YES I HAVE USED MANY RECOVERY SOFTWARE TO SEE WHAT WAS GOIN ON BUT THAT STILL DOESNT HELP ME GET THE DIRVE FIXED WITH OUT A REFORAMT THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP I D GUESS I HAVE TO LOOK ELSEWARE

It's why we turn to copying the contents out, wipe the drive, test it and copy the contents back. -&gt; Not all damage is repairable and some repairs will cause more damage. Then again not everyone believes this and will lose it all in repeated repair attempts. I've shared what we do and what I see happen. Your choice here. Bob

PC FILE INSPECTOR may let you copy a few files you need today out until you have all the right parts to do this right. Hey, I love watching a good train wreck (watch others not take the safe recovery path and try repairing such a drive without backup.) Bob

There are a few get upset I don't have a &quot;magic bullet&quot; of software that will fix a drive and get it working again. Since I don't have that I share a few decades of what I do to save drive data today without the k-buck charge at drivesavers or ontrack. You seem upset with such candor which I understand since I've seem many get very stressed over the possible losses. Bob
