In case my laptop is stolen and also for back-up purposes I have bought an external HDD attached by USB. In preparing the external HDD prior to the imaging/cloning I was going to partition it in approx the same sizes as the original. Does it matter what type of partition I use ? The original Has a Primary and a Logical partition. Using Win XP(home), the options seem to be Primary,Extended or Logical. Which type or combination should I set up on my external HDD ? Thanks.

HD for cloning main H	Guess it depends.... - will you only use it with the laptop ? - will you use it with a digital camera or camcorder ? - What OS are you using ? - Ever want to use it as a bootable drive ?

That's the plan, but it would be nice to keep my options open. &gt;will you use it with a digital camera or camcorder ? Well, I will be storing my digital photo's on it. That's about all. &gt;What OS are you using ? I'm using WinXP, home edition &gt;Ever want to use it as a bootable drive ? Wasn't planning to. I don't consider it a 'real' hard disc as such. It's one of those small external drives. If the lap tops drive did die, I guess I'd be getting a new one and just want to transfer all the data back to it (likewise, if the whole laptop is stolen when I'm travelling). OzExpat.

Just make it an 'extended partition' and then create the logical partitions/drives within the extended. What are backing up and SW are you using to do it ...just data or the entire disk ? VAPCMD

My suggestion . . . just make the entire external drive an 'extended partition' with one logical drive. You can create folders on the drive to store the backups and images you make. You can use XP Adminstrative Tools, Disk Management to partition and format the external. Acronis 10 is out and I believe it comes with partitiong SW. Might also setup your system with a BIOS password and startup password. Won't stop everyone but it'll slow 'em down a little and keep nosey folks out of you laptop. Just don't forget the PW. VAPCMD

BTW the new external HD is 60GB whilst the laptop HD is 20 GB. I've downloaded and read the manual for v 9 of Acronis and it seems very user friendly for someone of my IT skills. OzExpat.
