Here are two painless solutions you can try if you haven't already done so: #1 -Download and install Vista SP1 (Highly Recommended) #2 -Right click on your Network Icon in the systray.
-Left click on Network and Sharing Center&quot; or -Click &quot;Start&quot; &gt; Control Panel &gt; Network & Internet &gt; Network & Sharing Center -Under &quot;Sharing and Discovery&quot; make sure that &quot;Network Discovery&quot; is turned &quot;On&quot; If the above don't solve your problem (or you've already done them) we can look at other options.
