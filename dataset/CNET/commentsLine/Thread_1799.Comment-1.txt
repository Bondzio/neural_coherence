i had an i/o magic dvd+/-rw i bought back in 2004 that recently died.
it was an 8 speed (8x).
i recently bought a samsung sh-s182m lightscribe 18x dvdrw as a replacement unit for it.
i'm buying the 18 speed discs for it, but i have a question.
do i have to get rid of all my old 8x-16x discs i had or, can i still use them on my new drive?
i'm currently running the nero 6 software that came with the samsung.
nero has an option that allows you to slow down the burn speed for cd's, but i didn't notice one for dvd's.
please advise.
thanks.
