Turns out it was the wrong kind of drive so I got a USB enclosure for it so it could be used as a storage drive for my newer laptop, an HP Pavilion DV9000 running Vista. I have the drivers installed. I formated it and the device manager recognizes it's there and working properly. However, I rarely get it to show up in my explorer window. When it does show up, I can't add anything to the drive. How do I get this thing to work?
