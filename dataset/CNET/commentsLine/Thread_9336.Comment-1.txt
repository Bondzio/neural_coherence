i have recently purchased a sony dvd rw dw-u18a and haven't succesfully burned one dvd yet!
the burn process fails at the last 10% or so (i can't remember the exact error message, but it entails 'failed').
i have tried burning a dvd (mixed data, film, audio) with the most recent nero and alcohol and yet it still fails.
i have tried looking for updated drivers for the dvdrw but they don't seem to exist...help!!!
i am running winxp.
