<s> Currently I'm a very frustrated PC customer that has always wanted to go to Mac, but it was too expensive. </s>
<s> Now with the release of the Mac Mini ( http://www.apple.com/macmini ), it is now an option. </s>
<s> My questions are the following: -- Concerning clocking speeds, what does the 1.25 G4 compare to in the PC world? </s>
<s> -- Can I put my PC RAM or HDD in this and make it run? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> It's probably comparable to an older Pentium 4. </s>
<s> The G4 chip is kind of old and isn't really that powerful when compared to many of the newer processors. </s>
<s> I BELIEVE the MacMini should run on standard, PC2700 non-ECC 184-pin DIMMs. </s>
<s> The HD SHOULD also be a standard 3.5&quot;. </s>
