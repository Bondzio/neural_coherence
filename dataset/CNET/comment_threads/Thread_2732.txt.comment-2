My mate has just convinced my to get the &quot;Maxtor DiamondMax 10 300GB SATA 16MB 7200RPM NCQ&quot; because it's really fast, only 120 and has 16MB of cache - double the Seagate.
He also mentioned that some Seagate drives are loud and the Maxtor is quieter.
Another big plus with the Maxtor is that you can use either an existing 4-pin power connector and I think it comes pack with a SATA interface/data cable - all that you need to get it up and running.
Are there any other drives like this?
