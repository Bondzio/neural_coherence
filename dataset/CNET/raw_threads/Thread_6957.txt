I found this guide here: http://www.storagereview.com/how_upgrade_crucial_ssd_firmware Along with the official firmware update from the site itself: http://www.crucial.com/support/firmware.aspx?AID=10273954&PID=3332167&SID=u00000626 But both of these are quite confusing. First of all, they don't mention how the SSD is plugged into the motherboard. Do I just plug the SSD into my old motherboard and update first, before starting the build? Or do I plug it into the new mobo and use external storage to supply the firmware? (like a USB stick or an ISO file burned to a disc?) Do I install Windows 7 first, then once I arrive at the desktop I start up Crucial's update tool? Should I update the motherboard firmware before the SSD's? I haven't actually received the SSD yet, so I can't read the instruction manual. I would just like a general handle on how it will work before I get it. I knew it would require messing with the firmware going in, but I didn't realize it would be so complicated.

I'm not entirely sure in which order I'm supposed to put them on the motherboard. Or even how. I know there's something called a &quot;bootable USB thumb drive&quot; but I've never done that before.

You do have a working PC, then update what can be done as necessary for what you have. Once done, await the new SSD and then make sure it works after installation. Once done, you update &quot;if&quot; you like or just update it once all is working 100%. That should be it, no need burden yourself beforehand. I do suggest you get the instructions, print them out and review them. As for the Win 7 install, is this a re-install or new one? tada -----Willy

My current PC is kind of a pre-built Acer (with a bunch of pieces that I've replaced). It came with Windows 7 already in it, so I don't think I can re-use that one. I was just worried because I heard one of the bugs with the m4 is that it can start getting BSODs after... 5000+ something hours of use. Which probably comes to well over 200 days, so it's not too too serious... but I do want to patch that bug ASAP. It makes me wonder though... the m4 hasn't been on the market that long. How did they even find out about this bug? Here's my parts list: Lancool K63 case (acquired) LEPA 80+ Gold 500 W PSU (acquired) 2 x 2 GB Crucial Ballistix DDR RAM (acquired) Western Digital 2 TB Black internal HDD (acquired) Crucial 128 GB m4 internal SSD (in transit) Intel i5-2500K CPU (not yet purchased) Asus P8Z68-V Pro mobo (not yet purchased) Also I have an old DVD drive I have lying around... though truth be told I don't much like DVDs anymore... I know I should get the mobo and CPU... but a naive part of me still thinks I can wait out until Ivy Bridge arrives, lol. I should just bite the bullet and get the damn thing... I need this PC up and running before Diablo III comes out.

In most cases, users refer back to the manufacturers of issues encountered and that gets out and word becomes whatever is required for the fix. Since, you know about this, keep an eye on it and refer to it should anything go wrong. In other words don't try another fix, it seems to be a defective item in the making. Of course, there are issues with manufacturing, a series of product may have been released and later found due to some incorrect make of the product, yada, yada, things happen. That's only a guess on my part. As for Win 7, do what it takes to be &quot;genuine&quot; as MS under its update process may defeat attempts to bypass it, sooner or later. Well, you will need a DVD drive in order for an install under typical conditions. So, while it maybe dislaiked by you, it does serve a useful purpose. Now all you have to do is await until ALL the parts become available to do all that needs to be done. enjoy -----Willy

About 2 months time, maybe that was enough for them to produce corrected drives and ship them to Newegg. Hopefully it will come fully functional right out of the box and I won't have to get my hands dirty. Though... if I plan on tweaking computers on a regular basis, I really should learn how to do this stuff...
