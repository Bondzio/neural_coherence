<s> I'm trying to find out if I can install two Video card on my Computer, one of them is a ATI Radeon X800 XL and I also want an a ATI HDTV Wonder with a TV Tuner, My computer runs Windows XP SP2 and 1GB of Ram and has PCI slots for the upgrade, I want to play some good games on my computer and also I want to record TV programs on it, thanks for the Help, Miguel Martinez from Jersey. </s>
<s> assuming the x800xl is the proper slot type (agp or pci-e) for your mobo, they'll work together just fine. </s>
<s> be sure to google some hdtv-wonder reviews/discissions since it had a lot of issues when it was first released. </s>
<s> Thanks for the tip. </s>
