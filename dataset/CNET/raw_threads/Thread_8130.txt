No details I can find to start a discussion but since &quot;XP&quot; knows nothing about what to do with the fan (that's a driver thing) what you asked can be answered with &quot;sounds proper for XP.&quot; If you want to look into if such is possible we'd have to see if the unit has fan controls. Most desktops didn't have such. Bob

It didn't do much without the service packs and drivers. Until more is known about this machine, it could be working properly. Bob

In standby by this power supply is &quot;on&quot; and since the fans are connected to that supply the fans are &quot;on&quot; as well. This is why nothing may be wrong. Bob
