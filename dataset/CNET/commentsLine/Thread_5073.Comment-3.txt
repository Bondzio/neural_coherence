can you get to your desktop at all?
does your system sometimes freeze up?
what were you doing when the problem first started or was it this way as soon as the upgrade.
if there are not any freeze ups i don't believe its a driver problem.
i think it could be a memory problem or cpu problem.
go into your bios and find your memory readings.
make sure they read right.
look at your clock speed and see if it is right and also check the tempature of your cpu.
it could be running too hot.
it may also be not seated right.
the heatsink and fan may not be seated right.
did you reload xp after the upgrade?
did you download sp2?
give more details.
it could be a lot of things.
maybe even a virus.
