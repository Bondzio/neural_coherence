hi everyone.
sorry if this thread has been done before, i couldnt find any similar ones.
basically ive just come out of uni and want to start a career in video editing.
at the moment ive got a macbook, but its so slow using final cut pro with long footage.
i was thinking of getting an imac or mac pro, but i have a very limited budget.
what do you reckon is the kind of specifications i should concentrate on??
im tempted with the imac purely because its cheaper but have no idea its editing capabilities?
thanks a lot
