Based on your current needs I would go with the G model with MIMO.
Here's why: 1.)
Your current laptop cannot use the pre-N capabilities.
2.)
Since this is Pre-N (in other words the standard has not yet been established) why not wait for the Real N to debut and know that you have the standard, not just someones interpretation of the standard?
Of course that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.
