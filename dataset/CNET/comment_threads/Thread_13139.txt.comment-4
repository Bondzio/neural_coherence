There are folks who know how and have used a Flash Drive as a bootable device?
.
Yes I have.
Have you booted with Linux or UbunTu on a Flashdrive or a CD?
.
Yes I have.
This is well documented and well discussed area of PCs.
The only time I see folk in trouble is if their machine doesn't support this or if they didn't follow the directions on making the bootable media.
