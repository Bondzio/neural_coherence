If you get on the Internet with Windows 98, you're going to be highly exposed to viruses and other malware because it's been unsupported for years and thus is lacking a ton of needed updates to patch vulnerabilities.
You're also going to find it very difficult to find software that runs on it.
If you have some old games you want to play on this dinosaur, that would be OK, but I sure wouldn't want to try going online with something that outdated.
Save your money and get a new computer or tablet.
Good luck.
