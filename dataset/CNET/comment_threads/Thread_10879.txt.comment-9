Hi Ozos, Re: &quot;um...i'd really really really really love to see the day the GeForce FX 5600nU can be on par with the Radeon 9600Pro&quot;.
Well, look at Tom's Hardware and in their test with Doom3 at 1024x768, High Quality 4xAA/8xAF the FX 5600 is at 12.7 FPS and the Radeon 9600 Pro is at 11.8 FPS, so the FX5600 is above par.
However, you are correct that the Radeon 9600 Pro is slightly ahead of the FX 5600 in Call of Duty and probably some others, and I stand corrected as I was looking at the Doom3 figures when I said, &quot;The FX 5600 is about on par with the Radeon 9600 PRO&quot;.
I tend to use Tom's Hardware Tests of cards in games rather than benchmarks.
My other statements seem to be in line with Tom's hardware, ie: &quot;According to Tom's Hardware, in just Doom3 and Half-Life 2, the FX5600 outperforms these: FX5200 FX5200U Radeon 9600 Radeon 9600SE&quot; Thanks for the other information you provided.
