1.1.1	I just sold me house , finally got some cash to build my dream system .	St
1.1.2	Of course I want it all .	St
1.1.3	Great gaming , and great video editing .	St
1.1.4	What should I go with ?	Ques
1.1.5	I 'm even up in the air about Athlon vs P4 .	St
1.1.6	I read Maximum PC and they area praising the AMD stuff right now and suggest waiting for the new dual core chips from Intel to come out .	St
1.1.7	I 've always had Intel Inside so I 'm somewhat biased .	St
1.1.8	TIA Shawn	St
1.2.1	$ 1500 would get you a great system ...	St
1.2.2	The price of a house would enable you to buy many computers .	St
1.2.3	My suggestion build your own .	St
1.2.4	A list of parts would be avilable upon request and $ 1500 is all you need for just the computer .	St
1.2.5	Roger	St
1.3.1	I have never built a system so I do n't know if I could handle it .	St
1.3.2	I 've done everything to an exsisting computer aside from changing the power supply and the motherboard .	St
1.3.3	I have never built a tower either so I would have that built for me as well .	St
1.3.4	I 'm leaning toward the top end athlon 64 , definitely need 2GB of ram .	St
1.3.5	I would rather have one really fast HD for video editing and game playing and another for mainly storage of MP3 warez etc .	St
1.4.1	ok , this is a basic configuratiion I would recommend going with ... CPU- Athlon 64 FX-55 Mobo- ASUS SLI ( do n't no exact name ) RAM- 4 x 512 MB PC3200 OCZ Video Card- 2 x Nvidia 6800 Ultra HDD- 2 x 74 GB Western Digital Raptor 10,000 RPM 1 x 200 GB Seagate SATA ( for MP3s ) Sound Card- Sound Blaster Audigy ZS2 ( or sumthing like that ) Cooling- liquid cooling Case- your decision	St
1.5.1	http : //www.tomshardware.com and read the article comparing the upcoming dual core AMD and Intel .	St
1.5.2	They had versions to test .	St
1.5.3	The AMD left Intel looking bad .	St
1.5.4	When one takes into account the terribly high power consumption of the Intrels there seems to be no choice .	St
1.5.5	You do have to cool them you know .	St
1.5.6	The Intel consumes more power at idle than the AMD at peak .	St
1.5.7	And to hold their heat down , Intel has to run the processor slower than their single core [ 3.2 vs 3.8 ] .	St
1.5.8	Notice also , that since the AMD has the MCH in the CPU die , the Nvidia 4 Chipset for the AMD is a single chip , while for the Intel it is still the Northbridge and southbridge .	St
1.5.9	Yes Intel calls the MCH and IOCH .	St
1.6.1	Configure a high end Dual Core now with Intel : http : //www.velocitymicro.com/wizard.php ? iid=20 ( do n't forget dual WD Raptor 10,000RPM Hard Drives ) Or wait to see what they come up with for AMD 's new 'dual core ' processors .	St
1.6.2	AMD has previously announced that they will not consider their top FX 55 for dual core until games for dual core are out .	St
1.6.3	Intel has been working on that also : http : //www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20050308net.htm ? iid=search &	Ques
1.7.1	the FX-55 will always be a 2.6GHZ HAmmer based chip with 1 core FX-57 is basically a 90nm FX-55 at higher speeds and AMD 's view is that the FX series is for nothing but gaming , so the chip should do basically nothing but ( it 's just a benchmarking/power house chip ) I would n't suggest 2GB of RAM ( you do n't even need it , gaming wo n't touch needing that mouch , video editing ( you have to have bob explain it ( because he does this stuff ) but basically his comment is that you save 5 minutes out of 6 hours ... not worth the extra money ) aside from that I would suggest the Athlon64x2 4600+ or 4800+ the reason ?	Ques
1.7.2	they are amazingly fast , and will help in video editing ( they WILL cut a huge chunk of time off your rendering , as they render almost like a dual Opteron server ) aside from that i would NOT GET THE ASUS BOARD I would suggest the DFI SLI board ( it 's about $ 40 more ) and a pair of GeForce 6800GT 's or 6800Ultra 's ( either would be more than fast ) in addition I would suggest hte Creative Labs Audigy 4 Pro , the 4 is not a new generation card , all Audigy 4 means is that it has 4 inputs/4outputs ( which is nice compared to the 2 ZS Plat/2 ZS Plat Pro 's 3/2 type config ) the reason the 4 Pro is good is because unlike M-Audio 's Delta 1010 , which is 10 in 10 out only the 4 Pro supports 7.1 THX playback at a higher SNR than the Audigy 2 ZS series ( by about 2 dB , so it 's not really anything amazing ) in addition you will want a VERY GOOD power supply , I would suggest PC Power & Cooling 's 850W ( you do n't need something as manly as this , but since you have the money , why not get the best ? )	Ques
1.7.3	it 's about $ 499 find it here http : //www.xoxide.com/pcpc-850w-ssi-psu.html that PSU will drive 2 basic machines or 1 really tricked out machine ( like what your building ) but wait , there 's more so i 'm suggesting this board : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16813136151 with the above PSU and since you have the money to spend http : //xoxide.com/ect-prometeia-cooling-unit-mach-ii-gt-amd64-kit.html THAT is what i 'd cool the CPU with it will do around -45* C then we move to the video cards if you REALLY want the best cooling http : //www.dangerdenstore.com/product.php ? productid=64 & cat=48 & page=1 two of those for your 6800 Ultra 's and put them on a WC loop ( buy the other hardware at danger den ) building it yourself is easy installing the hardware is simple guides exist and it 's cheaper/better than getting a pre-built	St
1.8.1	Thanks for the reply .	St
1.8.2	Great job with the links as well .	St
1.8.3	I 'm going to go with the 4800 then as well as the DFI mobo .	St
1.8.4	If I go with the THERMALTAKE Silent Purepower W0014RU ATX 480W Power Supply 100 - 240V will that work with the dual vids and the 4800 ?	Ques
1.8.5	Thanks again Shawn	St
1.9.1	Forget the thermaltake , the 600W all in one noise taker is what I 'm going to with .	St
1.9.2	The Turbo-cool is out of stock : (	St
1.10.1	Re : & quot ; I 've always had Intel Inside so I 'm somewhat biased. & quot ; Dell has now come out with the new Intel dual core series 820 , 830 and 840 in a 9100 model in addition to their Gamer Gen 5 dual core .	St
1.10.2	http : //www1.us.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/dimen_9100 ? c=us & cs=19 & l=en & s=dhs	St
1.11.1	do n't get the Thermaltake I have the 420W in another rig , it 's not bad from what i 've seen so far , but i would n't suggest it , nor it 's 480W cousin , for SLI and what not i would suggest a PC Power & Cooling 850W if you REALLY want the best if you want to step down a bit , the 510W would be fine also , on newegg the Zippy/EMACS 700W and 600W units would be fine along with Enermax 's 660W unit	St
1.12.1	If I get a Athlon mobo , will I be able to drop in a dual core chip at somepoint ? ?	Ques
1.12.2	?	Ques
1.13.1	processor can be thrown into just any current Athlon motherboard .	St
1.13.2	From what I understand the new AMD Dual Core Processors can be installed in a socket 939 motherboard and be activated through the BIOS .	St
1.13.3	As to the details , I would suggest contacting AMD for clarification on which current motherboards .	St
1.13.4	The pricing is supposed to be : $ 1001 = 4800 $ 803 = 4600 $ 581 = 4400 $ 537 = 4200 respectively , in 1000 unit quantities According to Ray Harinec ... .. & quot ; AMD 's dual core is n't due until late 3rd quarter , early fourth. & quot ;	St
1.14.1	mobos .	St
1.14.2	Of course at that time a BIOS update will be required .	St
1.14.3	Consider the two top Abit mobos , the fatality or the SLI .	St
1.14.4	High price but ready for the future .	St
1.14.5	very highly rated in testing sites .	St
1.14.6	And the heat that the Intel Dual cores put out would scare the hades out of me .	St
1.14.7	My thoughts are that Intel will almost force one to go to a BTX style system [ new case , new mobo , new HSF et al .	St
1.14.8	[ of course Intel has been pushing the BTX spec , and vendors have tried to ognore them .	St
1.14.9	a little like the Intel insistance on sticking to rambus memory until**** .	St
1.14.10	There are some BTX cases available now .	St
1.14.11	The mobo goes in from the right side rather than the left as the current ATX 's go .	St
1.14.12	Change will continue to happen , simply progress , ca n't fight it .	St
1.15.1	http : //www.tomshardware.com to read their in depth article comparing the Intel and AMD dual core CPU 's ? ?	Ques
1.15.2	Tom 's and other such sites get actual devices from the mfrs to use before they are generally available , so they are actually testing the real devices .	St
1.15.3	The heat issue will floor you .	St
1.16.1	it 's $ 10.5k to ship it to your door ( just under ) all parts from newegg dual Xeon 3.6 with EM64T ( they 'd eat an 840 alive ) dual 6800U 's ( the 512MB ones ) 8GB of RAM 2.1TB of storage dual top end dvd burners Alienware ca n't touch this it 's a monster if your interested links and part list avliablble but me , i do n't suggest something this expensive	St
1.17.1	For my third system , I thought , & quot ; What the heck ; I spend so much time tinkering around with this stuff , how hard can it be ? & quot ; The hardest part was getting SP1 loaded on a 200GB Harddrive -- Bill used all kinds of subtefuge to get me to buy into SP2 , but I resisted .	St
1.17.2	SP1 , without a patch , ca n't handle the Large harddrives ( I ca n't exactly remember what the limitation is , but it 's less the 200GB ) .	St
1.17.3	Anyway , I paid twice as much money for a fundamentally limited Gateway in 1998 .	St
1.17.4	Then , thinking to outfox the limitations , in Feb 2004 , I bought an & quot ; expandable & quot ; e-Machine advertised at PC 3200+ .	St
1.17.5	I could never figure out how the nVidia chipset , rated by the nVidia people , the FIC mobo assembly people , and the AMD designers ; all three of these entities said this was 400 FSB / 3200+ ( eMachine said it was a 3200+ machine as well -- it just could n't handle FSB over 333 ( does anyone see a problem ? ) .	Ques
1.17.6	Somehow , e-Machines was able to downsize the FSB to 333 DDR ( I had two 512 DDRs for 2 slots ) .	St
1.17.7	I had been reading the wrangling about whether this is a PC2700 or a PC3200 that I had .	St
1.17.8	I got a good price on a pair of Crucial 1GB 400 DDRs and decided to take the chance .	St
1.17.9	Wrong .	St
1.17.10	The BIOS recognized the 2048MBs of 400DDR , but as soon as I would plug in my AGP ( I was giving the system it 's enema and because the MoBo was designed w/ nVidia integrated video , I had to set the rest of the stuff up .	St
1.17.11	then , load the nVidia video drivers for the AGP card .	St
1.17.12	Before rebooting to the new drivers , I had to disable the onboard nVidea drivers .	St
1.17.13	OK so far -- AGP drivers loaded fine , the 400DDR was up and running so I 'd power off , unplug the power , pop the AGP card in , plug it back up , power it up and everything would load properly until it came time to adjust the new AGP card setting -- Bam -- BSOD .	St
1.17.14	After running in that circle for 2 or 3 times , I said , & quot ; Screw this -- I 'm going to either mess up the new memory or my AGP card & maybe the sound card -- who knows ?	Ques
1.17.15	I need 64 bit processing anyway ( need ?	Ques
1.17.16	BS ; I wanted it ! ) .	St
1.17.17	Down to the local store , bought an ABIT mobo w/ a 64 bit , true pc 3200+ for that Socket 939 .	St
1.17.18	No more Socket A for me .	St
1.17.19	True , that set me back a few bucks , but the total expenditure on MoBo & Chipset was less than a 4th of what I spent on the eMachine .	St
1.17.20	No more trying to make a silk purse out of a sow 's ear .	St
1.17.21	I snatched out the new 200GB HD I had installed in the eMachine , it 's unappreciated new 400DDR mem mods 2GB or did I say that , the 52x ( at the top ) CD burner/DVD reader .	St
1.17.22	The sound card ( and I think that 's it ) .	St
1.17.23	I kept the eMachine 's DVD read/readwrite/re-write ( or whatever ) drive .	St
1.17.24	I forgot -- I also took the PCI USB/Firewire card to put in the new system .	St
1.17.25	So , for about 350 bucks ( I think ) plus all the good stuff already bought and paid for that was wasted on the eMachine , I now have a system that screams .	St
1.17.26	I 'm not a gamer , but this setup could be competetive -- replace the 128MB video card w/ 850 dollars worth of video card ( at that price , take your choice ) , and you 've got a gamer .	St
1.17.27	I guess I 'd also have to go to Serial ATA ( the ABIT board can Serial built-in but my harddrives are IDE ) or a bunch of tiny hard drives -- my 200GB is like a 747 flying against a squadron of F16s .	St
1.17.28	Is n't that what a SCUZZY really is ?	Ques
1.17.29	However , if you do n't feel like tinkering w/ your computer , go ahead & buy the eMachine .	Sug
1.17.30	They are a very good buy -- just do n't plan to upgrade .	St
1.17.31	You get what you pay for and eMachine gets the most out of the little material that they 've put in -- hat 's off on that count .	St
1.17.32	I 'll never buy another pre-assembled desktop ( I 'll be forced to replace my laptop in about 18 mos & I ca n't assemble one of those -- I 'm too clumsy ) .	St
1.18.1	Nice dude .	St
1.18.2	I think 10k is a little much at this point .	St
1.18.3	I can spend 3500-4500 .	St
1.18.4	Keep the suggestions coming , extremely helpfull .	St
1.18.5	I like the fatal1ty from aBit , think I will go with that .	St
1.18.6	I 've been a maximum pc fan / boot reader for sometime and seem to be in love with it .	St
1.18.7	I 'm not much of a gamer at this point , but I know I will be when I get the system .	St
1.18.8	are the vid cards dual slot ?	Ques
1.18.9	If so , is dual PCIe needed or even available at this point ?	Ques
1.18.10	Shawn	St
1.19.1	I 've been reading that site voarciously for a few weeks now trying to get caught up on this stuff .	St

1.21.1	Ok if you really want what my dream system is , you got ta get the Tyan Thunder K8QS Pro Quad Socket 940 Motherboard .	St
1.21.2	Just the thought of running 4 cpus at once makes me drool .	St
1.21.3	Sure the motherboard alone is $ 1,500.00 but if u got the money , it would be amazing to have .	St
1.21.4	10 friggin ram slots , a total of 32gb of ram supported ! !	St
1.21.5	4 AMD Opteron 800 processors .	St
1.21.6	Its expensive , and sure you wouldnt need it , but damn id love to see anyone top you with that .	St
1.21.7	But in serious terms , you should go for a dual intel computer with a nVidia 6800gt graphics card , and as much ram as you can fit on there .	St
1.22.1	Sorry i said 10 ram slots , its 16 .	St
1.22.2	Heres a picture of this beauty .	St
