aren't always customer friendly.
i asked one genius a similar question one time.
he gave me what seemed to be a dirty look and said that would never happen.
at least this time they acknowledged that it would be replaced if it isn't fixed this time.
they're shipping it to the depot, so they won't see the repairs until it comes back.
i hope it comes back before next friday... thing is, i'm trying not to push my luck here.
i was assured that it would be completely fixed when it comes back, and i intend to hold them to that promise, though a new mac would be kind of nice.
they have to look at the airport card, the ethernet hardware, and i hope they look at the board again... plus, the casing is still messed up and the antennae that runs through the top of the laptop may have had issues too.
a little more than greasing i'm afraid.
