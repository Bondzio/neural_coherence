to be honest your gfx card upgrade wouldn't do an awful lot without the memory been upgrading too.
i would check out the games you want to play and see what the system requirments are.
the geforce 4 is quite a step up from the geforce 2, the tnt card were very good in their day like the gf2 mx 400's.
