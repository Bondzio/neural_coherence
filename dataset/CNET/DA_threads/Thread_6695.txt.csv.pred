1.2.6	Thanks & quot ; Temu , You did n't state if date needed to be moved so this will be easy .	St
1.2.7	Just use a nice 80 conductor IDE cable , set both drives to Cable Select and plug the drive pair into a Primary IDE channel .	St
1.2.8	You may need to set the BIOS to autodetect the drives and a BIOS update might be required if the drives are beyond the supported size .	St
1.2.9	Install your OS , pull your files from backup and store the SCSI stuff for a rainy day if you want to recover some forgotten file .	St

1.4.1	& quot ; Just use a nice 80 conductor IDE cable , set both drives to Cable Select and plug the drive pair into a Primary IDE channel. & quot ; Does this & quot ; generally & quot ; work ?	Ques
1.4.2	Or does it depend on the mobo ?	Ques
1.4.3	I have an Intel D845BG mobo , and HDD is set as master .	St
1.4.4	If I were to add another HDD , could I set them up either way , master/slave , or cable select ?	Ques
1.4.5	And is there any advantage of one setup over the other .	St
1.4.6	Thanks .	Polite
1.5.1	The 80 conductor cable does the select and using the higher quality , higher speed cable sidesteps a few issues I 've seen over hair loss trying to install the OS .	St
1.5.2	The rules are simple in IDE land .	St
1.5.3	Just try it .	Sug
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	has Master , and Slave printed on it , which is what concerned me .	St
1.6.2	Now I 'm guessing that it means Master and Slave for Cable Select , or for normal settings .	St
1.6.3	Jumpered in a HDD from an & quot ; antique & quot ; Compaq about a month ago , to copy some files , and set it to Slave .	St
1.6.4	All worked fine , so guess the main HDD is set as master .	St
1.6.5	I 'll try it as Cable Select , when I get the new drive , but may have to get a new power supply first .	St
1.6.6	Have a 300 Watt supply now , supposedly certified for P4 , and Athlon , but do n't want to push it .	St
1.6.7	Appreciate the reply .	St
