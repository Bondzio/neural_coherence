You can't access files on d: exactly as file on c:, because the drive-letter is different.
So you would have to go to another drive.
It's transparent if you move a folder like My Documents (via its right click properties) that you don't access via a drive-letter.
But for all other files - after moving the folder - you'll notice the drive they are on is different.
But that's only a minor difference.
Don't move files from - the root folder - program files - windows - other folders than My Documents in your profile Kees Kees
