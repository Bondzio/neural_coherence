1.2.1	I have an external ESata rail in my HP8100CTO.	St
1.2.2	It requires that I boot with the external Esata drive powered up and connected.	St
1.2.3	If I wait until Windows has booted, it will not be detected.	St
1.2.4	Would like to find a reliable ESata hot swap program that works all the time.	St
1.3.1	Regardless of disconnecting the ESata cable, the external drive case supporting this 2.5&quot; drive must have power from an adapter.	St
1.3.2	The ESata cable supplies data, not power.	St
