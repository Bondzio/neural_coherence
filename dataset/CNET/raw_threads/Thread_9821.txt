And is application like Skype, PC Telephone also considered as VOIP? And I came across an advertisement of D-Link DVG-G1402S wireless router with embedded VOIP functionality. Does this router provide the same functionality of a traditional router (that is to provide Internet connection to the PC) and at the same time, you can connect a analogue phone and fax machine to it if a VOIP service is engaged? Thank you.

To go from analog requires something like Cisco's ATA which converts the anlog signal to digital for use over IP. I have been running Vonage for three or four years now without any trouble and it's cheap 24.95 a month unlimited calls. Anyway they have FAQ section that may help you a bit. VOIP still has a ways to go but day by day it's becoming beter. Most the time my vonage or VOIP phone works beter than ma bells. Mark

After 1 brief international call, the credit shown in PC-Telephone menu went down to about 13,000 units but would not allow me to dial. It is now showing 1 unit credit and will not dial anymore. I sent detailed emails to PC-Telephone support with no response and now their email system is rejecting my emails. What about the money I paid? I am really frustrated. There is no phone number that I could call. What kind of company is this? Are they fly by night or something?
