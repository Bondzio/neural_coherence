In SD you have the option to make the clone bootable.
If yours were unchecked, chances are that SD did not make it bootable.
I would first repeat the cloning making sure that this option is enabled.
If it fails, then return the drive.
I would suggest you get an OWC one.
They have a very good reputation and are portable to boot (no pun intended).
