I have a 2010 MacBook Pro computer that wirelessly connects to the internet via an Apple Time Machine.
I currently have an HP Photosmart C7200 printer that I could never get to function wirelessly.
Is there any e-printers (multi function) Scan and print that I could get to work wirelessly for all functions?
Thanks!
