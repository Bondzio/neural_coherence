I am using a BT HomHub to connect wirelessly to the internet at home.
I have been using this hub for over a year now and i am the only person in the house who uses the wifi as the other computer is connected by ethernet.
Recently the internet on my computer has stopped working, it appears connected but web pages wont load.
When i have a look at my connections the SSID of my hub appears twice and im connected by default to the second one (i have linked to a screen shot below).
While my computer is not loading the internet the one that is connected via ethernet works fine.
Is there any settings i can change that may have caused this to happen or do i need to get a new hub?
