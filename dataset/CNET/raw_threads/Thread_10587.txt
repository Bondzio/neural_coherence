When I put a 3.5 disk into the floppy and try to explore content of the drive, a message pops up asking to &quot;insert a disk into drive A&quot;. Initially I thought the problem was with the disk, but after putting in 3 other 3.5 disks that I knew was working, it looks like the drive is the problem. I am trying to figure out what are some of the possible causes when such error occurs. Any suggestion?

Depending on how good you are with tools and how lucky you are as well, you might be able to fix it. You can try a shot of canned air first. If that doesn't work, it's easy enough to take the covers off of these and get inside. You'll see worm drive mechanism, the heads, etc. Dust get wrapped around the worm drive but you can carefully clean it with the proper tools, solvents and lubricants such as you can get from some hardware stores. The heads actually pinch the disk. I doubt you can get a head cleaning disk anymore but you can use alcohol, swabs and canned air....very carefully....to try to clean them. It's an old drive so you've nothing to lose but the cost of the needed cleaning supplies might just fetch you a new floppy drive.

There are basically two possible ways to plug the cable, with either of the 2 flat sides. I actually tried both ways. One way showed the current result, I figure it's more likely to be the correct way, since the drive is recognized, despite the error. With the other way of connection, when clicking floppy drive under My Computer, the entire desktop crashes. That furthur strengthens my belief the first way is the proper way.

Too often I see cables without 'keys', cables where PIN 1 stripe is so faint it's easy to miss, motherboards where PIN 1 is barely visible and I'm not sure all floppy drives have 'cable keys' either. Take away the things that help the builder ensure it's right and 'stuff' happens. One of the most common symptons is the floppy drive light stays on . . that's a clear case the cable is reversed. Good Luck VAPCMD

With my current connection, the floppy drive light is always on, and I was wondering why. The only problem is with other way of connecting the cable, clicking on floppy drive under My Computer crashes desktop. I believe I should consider the possibility of a defective cable. Now I have to figure where to get another one.

Floppy cable PIN is indicated by the stripe on the floppy cable edge (sometimes very faint) and must go to PIN 1 on the MB. Sometimes the only way to tell which MB floppy connector is PIN 1 is check the system/MB manual. You can see it from the underside of the MB but that's usually not readily visible for most. VAPCMD
