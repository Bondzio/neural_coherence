I recently help a friend of mine to format and re-instal windows XP home edition to his Dell dimension desktop.
On completion the pc is working perfectly but for one snag, his pc isn't recognising his connection, he has a cable/ethernet connection with blueyonder, his modem etc is connected but yet he can't seem to get online.
In his device manager, he has a yellow question mark where ethernet controller and PCI modem are, is this the cause of it and what can be done to resolve this problem?
Any advice regarding this matter will be greatly appreciated, as he is driving me mad with phonecalls every five minutes.
