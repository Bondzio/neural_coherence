Hello, the case will be a weather resistant case that has insulation as well as vents for multiple fans.
The computer is used to analyze and collect environmental data in the wild and very very rural areas.
There are no cables or DSL lines where we are talking about.
It does have power supply, but the only way to transmit this data is through cellular link.
It will be about 20 feet in the air and will gather data on the environment (ie, temp, humidity, ect for scientific purposes) through a series of sensors on the ground.
The temperature extremes will be -20 to about 120F.
Hope this helps.
