&quot;lexar did say i should have formatted the card in the camcorder before use.
but i've never had to do that before... card comes formatted so i just thought it was ok to use that way.
not sure i understand why a card must be formatted in the camera before use.&quot; that advice is well known and accepted as correct.
while using the card without doing so works fine in what must be 99.9% of the time, it's that last 0.1% that can cause folk grief.
to explain why takes me about 5 minutes to cover entirely one on one over coffee so i'm keep it short to &quot;it's good advice.&quot; bob
