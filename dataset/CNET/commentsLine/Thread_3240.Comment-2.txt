i'm assuming this is recorded tv.
if so, the mpeg recording could be overtaxing your cpu.
unfortunately, the all in wonder series is discontinued.
if you're using it for tv tuning/recording, you should dial back it recording quality.
if you have a seperate tv tuner, a new video card with hardware assisted mpeg playback could help.
look for a radeon x1000 or geforce 7000/8000 series video card.
