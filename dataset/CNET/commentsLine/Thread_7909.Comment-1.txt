i recently started a support position at a small manufacturing company.
they have a wireless router for the few laptops that are in use.
apparently it currently only has access to the internet, not the rest of the office network, and my boss would kind of like to keep it this way.
however, people using their laptops and this connection occasionally want to print.
we have several printers in the office, most of which are managed by a central print server.
my question is in essence this: is it possible to somehow 'dual-home' the print server or one of the printers, while keeping the wireless network isolated from the office network?
i don't know specifically yet what the print server is running, nor what the printers are, but most of them are big and new(ish).
not just little desktop models.
also, the network right now is currently all p2p, which, i will be rectifying as soon as possible.
