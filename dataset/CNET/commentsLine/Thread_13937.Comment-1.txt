hi, a small business in my town recently got new ibm pcs.
they then upgraded from win98se to winxp pro.
they took all of there networking configuration from 98se and entered them into xp pro.
the host pc has an ip address of 192.168.0.12. the other three are .13, .14, .11. all subnet masks are set to 255.255.255.0. default gateway is set to 192.168.1.1. there are 3 shared folders, g,h,p.
when the non-hosts try to access info on g:, a message shows that this drive is set as &quot;read only&quot;.
h and p can be accessed with no trouble.
this happens when the non-host pc users are trying to access word perfect files on g:.
also, when the files are edited on the host pc, the other pcs don't see the change.
we have tried to remove the read- only status, but it doesn't stick.
can anyone help?
thanks, paul
