DDR2 RAM will run a tad bit faster than DDR, but it's not enough to really notice a difference.
And it's only if you get DDR2 that's running at a high enough frequency, at that.
Really, AM2 is just a backstop until K8L comes out in about 2 years.
AM2 processors are going to use less power, so if that's something you're concerned about, go with the AM2 system.
Otherwise, honestly, it's really not going to matter too much.
