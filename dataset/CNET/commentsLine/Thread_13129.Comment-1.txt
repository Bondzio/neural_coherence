i have recently purchased a gainward 7950gt golden sample 256mb i do alot of gaming so this cam to quite a dissapointment for me i used to have a 6600 512mb geforce(dont know the make) and in bf2 i used to get an fps of 50-60 average and ever sinse i put this 7950gt in im getting 10-20-40 fps averaging between them i have been told that i need a better power supply i currently have a 400w bog standard psu and i have been told i need one with a special slot for the graphix card  hpu-4r580 the pink one at the bottom i looked on reviews of this card and should be getting 100+fps and on quake 4 around 178fps at the moment i am getting 10-40 fps in bf2(battlefield2) would this power supply really make all the difference from 20fps to 100fps i just dont see how a power supply could make that much effect if anyone could please answer that would be grate thanks
