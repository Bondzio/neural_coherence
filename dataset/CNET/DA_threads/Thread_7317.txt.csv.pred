1.1.1	Recently I 've turned off my psu and unplugged my computer then replugged it from moving .	St
1.1.2	But then from then on , my computer would go straight into the BIOS setup seconds after I turned on my computer .	St
1.1.3	So then I would save setting and exit my bios setup after checking all setting were correct .	St
1.1.4	But after this , my computer would just go to a blank black screen and freeze and would n't boot into windows .	St
1.1.5	I would restart , but it would do nothing forcing me to force shut down my computer .	St
1.1.6	Then I would turn it on again , same thing happens .	St
1.1.7	Because it goes into the BIOS setup in seconds after turning it on , I can not prompt it to go to safe mode or anything .	St
1.1.8	My computer has been like this for weeks .	St
1.1.9	I 've also check my boot settings as it boots first from my hard drive and then my dvd rom .	St
1.1.10	I 've also switched this around with no luck .	St
1.1.11	I 've tried to have it boot from my DVD-rom so I can try reformatting it .	St
1.1.12	But still it jumps straight into the BIOS setup .	St
1.1.13	Any one got suggestions to fix this ?	Ques
1.1.14	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	computer boots to bios Several options there , it sounds like a hardware problem .	St
1.3.1	What do you by chance mean ?	Ques
1.3.2	You shifted the computer to a new location ?	Ques
1.3.3	If so , sounds like loose cable somewhere internally , either on your harddisk side or motherboard size .	St
1.3.4	Check all cables internally are connected securely which could have came off while moving , else , it seems quite bad news to me regarding your harddisk .	St
1.3.5	In your bios , is your motherboard able to detect the harddisk ?	Ques
1.3.6	If no , your harddisk may have it 's cable loose , or worst , damaged .	St
1.3.7	If yes , your partition may have crashed big .	St
1.3.8	If you can remove the harddisk , test it on another system as an external or something to see you can save off important files before doing anything else .	St
1.4.1	Are you able to hear whether the harddisk is making some spinning noise ?	Ques
1.4.2	If it does n't , there 's possibility the powerline supplyiing the harddisk has failed , thus need to switch to another powerline .	St
