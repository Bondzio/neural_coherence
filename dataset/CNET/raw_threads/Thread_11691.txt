My old Pentium 233MX Windows 98 SE with 128MB of ram a 1.2 GB harddrive. The first time the 166MX Processor Burned up. It was under warranty at that time. The second time the power supply went out. Now my motherboard is fried. I will have to get a new motherboard and new case and start all over again. In your case it can be your processor out or something else. If your have friends who know a lot about computers that would be your best bet. For them to check it out.

You can try blowing it out with a can of compressed air. Take the cover off and clean it out. Use a soft thin paint brush on the fan blades and components. It's worth a try. But if lights are going on (real low voltage) and no fans are turning...well... Oh, replace the battery on the motherboard. Good Luck. and life goes on... Jack
