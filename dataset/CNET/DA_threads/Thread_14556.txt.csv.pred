1.1.1	I was just told this video card was no good .	St
1.1.2	No good because of it 's price .	St
1.1.3	My question is this .	St
1.1.4	It 's a new Video Card with not 128MB RAM but with 512MB RAM .	St
1.1.5	Does this make any difference ?	Ques
1.1.6	Well you know for future games .	St
1.1.7	Also crossfire only works if you have two video cards and two pci-e slots right , well and a mobo that can handle crossfire right ?	Ques
1.1.8	http : //www.circuitcity.com/ssm/VisionTek-Xtasy-Radeon-X1300-Video-Card-X1300512PCIE-/sem/rpsm/oid/143571/catOid/-13043/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do	St
1.2.1	in your original thread where you were NOT told it was no good , but that there were better cards for the same or lower price ? ?	Ques
1.2.2	I would suspect that the person could give you further basis for his reasons .	St
1.2.3	I know nothing about tvideo card performance , but have read many threads where a card with a lower amount of memory performed better than one with more memory .	St
1.2.4	There are other factors .	St
1.3.1	You know , I see a lot of that , the reply/new message thing .	St
1.3.2	I think people hit the Create a new message button instead of the reply message .	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	hey man I 'm going to buy the new comp today so tell me which of all the video cards you posted is the best ?	Ques
1.5.2	im not a hardcore gamer but I think ive heard of the nvidia 7800 gpu 's .	St
1.6.1	knowledgeable about video cards .	St
1.6.2	Maybe make a post or email John Robie and ask him .	Sug
1.6.3	He is rather knowledgeable about them .	St
1.7.1	It is the interface that the memory is on that will tell you the speed , and in your case that is 128-bit .	St
1.7.2	Also the other variable is the clock speed of the memory .	St
1.7.3	However , think of the interface as the bottleneck .	St
1.7.4	You can have a 900MHz memory clock running on a 64-bit interface , it 's going to be slow .	St
1.7.5	Ultimately look at the memory interface , 128-bit is fine for lower-end cards .	St
1.7.6	A note on memory size .	St
1.7.7	Most games right now do not use more than 128MB , and therefore 512MB would be considered unnessary at this point .	St
1.7.8	For the future we are seeing games that have more shaders and dynamic lighting for more realism .	St
1.7.9	And alot of games are also depend heavily on the CPU .	St
1.7.10	I would still buy the Sapphire X1600Pro , this card can run with a 6600GT while the vanilla X1300 is performing near a 6200 .	St
1.7.11	A 7800GT is overkill for ZooTycoon games .	St
1.7.12	And you will definitely have to upgrade the powersupply to alteast 400watts .	St
1.7.13	A vanilla X1300 may run on a 300watt , but the X1300Pro wants a 350watt or greater .	St
1.7.14	Also the quality of the PSU is also important as well .	St
1.7.15	Make sure you have 12V rails ... What computer are you buying ?	Ques
1.8.1	He sums up the previous post nicely when looking for a second opinion .	St
1.8.2	Too bad hes going to get the same opinions ...	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
1.10.1	The x1300 is the entry-level GPU from ATI .	St
1.10.2	Consider these benchmarks : http : //www.hothardware.com/viewarticle.aspx ? page=13 & articleid=734 & cid=2 http : //www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1875353,00.asp The x1300 is slower than a 6600gt and x1600xt yet those cards are only $ 140 ( compared to the $ 200 price for the x1300 ) .	St
1.10.3	To quote ExtremeTech : & quot ; We 're starting to see a pattern : ATI 's new low-end card is slower than all the other cards in its price range. & quot ; Every card I mentioned in my previous post will PERFORM MUCH BETTER than the x1300 and cost less than $ 200 .	St
1.10.4	Many articles have proven that 512MB offers no benefit except at super-high resolutions ( 1600x1200 and higher ) with 8xAA .	St
1.10.5	The x1300 can not support those resolutions .	St
1.10.6	At 800x600 and 1024x768 ( which is really all that card can do smoothly ) , 128MB is adequate and 256MB is more than enough .	St
1.10.7	512MB is just marketing gimmick on this card ... like putting a spoiler on Kia .	St
1.10.8	It may look cool , but it wo n't make it go any faster !	St
