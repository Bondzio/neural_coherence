1.1.1	Hello , I have a win CE 6 , 7 & quot ; laptop .	St
1.1.2	at first i couldnt get online ( ie ) .	St
1.1.3	i got sent a file to install from the sd card , and it now works fine - except that when using it to browse the web , for no reason i can see , on random pages , it just suddenly goes off the internet and connects itself to the local intranet ... meaning i cant view webpages - as i am just a personal user and dont actually have an intranet at all ... its not certain sites or pages ... because its never the same ones , sometimes i can see a page sometimes i ca n't ... any ideas how i can disable the intranet function entirely or stop this happening ?	Ques
1.1.4	i can not click on the icon , and there just doesnt seem to be anyway to stop it ... if i hit the back button , it goes back online ... if i need to look at a page and it wont let me , if i just keep trying over and over it will eventually let me stay online to see it ... but then go off at another random page .	St
1.1.5	this are just normal sites like facebook , yahoo , etc .	St
