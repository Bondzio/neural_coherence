<s> My friend has this HP Pavilion 7935 Desktop PC which came with WinXP, 1.3 GHz AMD, 128 MB RAM. </s>
<s> He had some problems with it and now, after a format, he has Win2K Pro on one of two partitions. </s>
<s> The display adapter has been installed after heavy searching. </s>
<s> The Network Adapter was automatically installed by Win2K. </s>
<s> Now I need to install the modem and Audio drivers but don't know the manufacturer/model. </s>
<s> The HP site was not helpful. </s>
<s> Does anyone know this machine (HP Pavilion 7935) and what modem and Sound Card it has? </s>
<s> or Do you know a utility that will tell me the manufacturer/model/make etc. </s>
<s> of the hardware BEFORE it has been installed and working? </s>
<s> Belarc only tells me stuff about hardware that is already installed with the correct drivers. </s>
<s> I need to install the drivers for the modem and the sound card but don't know the manufacturer/make/model etc. </s>

<s> Look in the HP support forums. </s>
<s> You find discussions like this one: http://forums1.itrc.hp.com/service/forums/questionanswer.do?threadId=250432 Bob </s>
<s> Strange you can't find the driver for the modem, just going to the HP driver site, putting in Pavilion 7935, immediately brings me to the XP drivers and shows a modem driver specifically. </s>
