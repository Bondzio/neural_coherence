I have a bit of a unique problem that I am not sure if it is coming entirely from my graphics card or from various other sources as well.
Whenever I tell my computer to shut down it always will try and restart (I have to use the &quot;on&quot; button for the off purpose) and in some games I notice decreased performance from a decent graphics card.
My system is as follows: AMD Athlon XP 2600+ Creative SB Audigy 2 ZS Plat.
nVidia GeForce FX 5200 w/256 MB of RAM 80 GB Maxtor UltraATA 133 Hard-disk DFI KT400A Socket A motherboard 1.50 GB DDR PC2700 RAM and the games I find trouble with are Indiana Jones: Emporers tomb and Halo The reason I say decreased performance is because my older system with GeForce4 MX 440, 512 MB PC133 SDRAM and an ancient Intel Pentium 4 at 2 GHZ runs Halo about 95% as good as an Xbox while my GeForce FX can't keep up, yet it has more ram and is newer.
Any suggestions?
