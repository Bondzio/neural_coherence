1.1.1	Hi everyone .	St
1.1.2	I 've been having problems with programs that act as servers .	St
1.1.3	For example , I use JumiMouse , which is an iPhone/iPod app that allows you to connect to your computer at home over a network or internet connection .	St
1.1.4	It works like Remote Desktop , except that it is faster and works on computers that ca n't use Remote Desktop , like mine .	St
1.1.5	This program is supposed to work over the network and the internet , but it only works over the network for me .	St
1.1.6	( JumiMouse has two parts : the iPhone/iPod app and a server program on my computer . )	St
1.1.7	I have tried making my computer the DMZ server .	St
1.1.8	Did n't work .	St
1.1.9	UPnP is on .	St
1.1.10	Does n't make a difference ( it 's always been on ) .	St
1.1.11	NAT is set to Open .	St
1.1.12	Does n't work .	St
1.1.13	I have tried forwarding ports 53 , 88 , and 3024 to my PC .	St
1.1.14	( This was for an Xbox 360 connection before I could set NAT to Open , it kinda worked , figured I 'd try it . )	St
1.1.15	Did n't work .	St
1.1.16	I 've read that it could be some firewall .	St
1.1.17	The SPI firewall has been disabled for some time , so that ca n't be it .	St
1.1.18	That 's the only firewall I can see that is provided by the router other than the wireless password/encryption .	St
1.1.19	This has all been done in tandem with each other .	St
1.1.20	Still does n't work .	St
1.1.21	Can anyone help me ?	Ques
1.1.22	Thanks in advance .	St
1.1.23	Computer : OS : Windows 7 Home Premium x64 Firewall : COMODO Internet Security Free Router : Netgear WPN824v1 Firmware version : 2.0.120	St
1.2.1	Hi .	St
1.2.2	Since you have already mentioned that you tried forwarding ports to your PC , I will assume you know how to forward ports within the router .	St
1.2.3	The ports associated with JumiMouse are not explicitly mentioned .	St
1.2.4	However I found the following tip that may help you .	St
1.2.5	PC should have a different listening port ( e.g .	St
1.2.6	5720 & 5721 ) .	St
1.2.7	Set these in the Jumi Controller & enter the same port numbers in the & quot ; Connection Settings & quot ; in the Jumi App .	St
1.2.8	Finally forward these ports in the Router .	St
1.2.9	I hope that works .	St
1.2.10	Take care .	St
