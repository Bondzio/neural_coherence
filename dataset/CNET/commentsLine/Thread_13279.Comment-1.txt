we have 2 computers (1 has an xp pro os while the other has a win98 se os) that are connected to the net via a cnsh-800 8-port switch that is hookup to a dsl modem-router.
our problem is that the connection between the switch and our win98se pc has somehow stop working.
no, it doesn't have anything to do with the lan card or the utp wire being busted because when we tried to hook them up directly to the dsl modem-router, we could still get a connection.
i think the same is also true for the switch because the connection between it and our xp pro pc still remains unaffected.
so my question now is this: where do you think our problem lies?
do you know of any solution to fix it?
