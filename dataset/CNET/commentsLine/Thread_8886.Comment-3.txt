forget the celeron and get the p4.
as for cooling, get whatever suits you as there are so many now but make it a copper core.
if you pick a large one, make sure you have room to install it as some are ridiculously large.
check with &quot;modding&quot; websites for the best reviews, etc.
plus tips/hints on such oc'ing as well.
but, any oc'ing is hardly a plus now as you gain very little and place the cpu into a 100% constant stressful enviroment.
cooling must be as reliable as you can make it.
