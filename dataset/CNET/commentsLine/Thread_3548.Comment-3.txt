video card first; having dedicated video (vs. integrated video), will greatly improve the way your games will run-they will generally perform faster.
be cautious of upgrading as many of the newer models will require you to upgrade your psu as well the video card you are considering is good; but only has 512mb of dedicated memory, whereas this one xfx geforce gt 240 has 1gb of memory (which will really make the games run faster), is the same price as the card you looked at and will probably work without a psu upgrade  after upgrading the video card; i would look at getting 2gb more of (good quality) ram, then a newer dual-core/ quad-core cpu.
