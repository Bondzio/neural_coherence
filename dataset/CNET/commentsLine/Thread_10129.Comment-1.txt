i recently acquired an hp omnibook 6100 with a cd-rw dvd rom.
it had no operating system due to a hard drive replacement, so i installed a legal copy of windows 98 se.
i've done all the upgrades thru ms and the unit works fine, except that it won't play a dvd.
i know the unit works because it plays cd's and writes to cd's just fine.
it appears the drive is a toshiba.
help.
