<s> Hi there, first of all I'm new to the CNET forums but not CNET.com itself. </s>
<s> I'm trying to make a fairly powerful desktop computer for ~$1300-1400(CAD) before taxes. </s>
<s> I will be running 64-bit Windows 7. </s>
<s> Here are the current components that I'm looking at (all prices are from tigerdirect.ca) -Case: Cooler Master HAF 932 Full Tower Black Case ($149.97) -Motherboard: XFX nForce 750i SLI Extreme Motherboard ($119.97) -CPU: Intel Core i7 920 Processor ($309.97) -RAM: Corsair XMS3 Tri Channel 6GB PC10666 DDR3 Memory ($139.97) -Graphics Card: EVGA GeForce GTX 260 Core 216 Video Card - 1792MB GDDR3 ($312.99) -Power Supply: Corsair TX750W 750-Watt Power Supply ($114.97) -HDD: Western Digital WD5000AAKS Caviar Blue Hard Drive ($69.97) -DVDRW Drive: Samsung SH-S223B/RSBF DVDRW Drive ($47.99) ***************************************************************** Total Cost: $1315.80 (before s&h and taxes) Please feel free to give me any thoughts, opinions, or advice on this build or any specific components. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136319 Great user ratings (including mine), larger cache buffer (32MB vs 16MB) and 5yr (Black) vs 3yr (Blue)warranty. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS...Did you look at the i860 ? </s>
<s> 750i chipset is only for core2duo/quad. </s>
<s> for core i7 920 you'll need a mobo with an x58 chipset but they're generally $200CAD and higher. </s>
<s> suggest you consider a core i7-860 ($330CAD) and a gigabyte ga-p55 or msi p55 ($120CAD). </s>
<s> a single radeon hd 5850 $290CAD will be comparable to dual gtx 260 and run cooler. </s>
<s> if you must have dual 260s, an sli-enabled p55 mobo will be about $25 due to the nvidia license fee. </s>
<s> Thank you both, I'm unsure if I will bother switching the hard drive or not yet but I have solved the motherboard issue. </s>
<s> My only problem now is that the Radeon HD 5850 is over $350 on tigerdirect.ca for any of the versions they have. </s>
<s> they're $290CAD but sold out at newegg.ca but should be available in a week or so. </s>
<s> hd 4850 benchmarks </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Getting 140GB more disk space on a highly rated drive (including mine), with larger cache buffer (32MB vs 16MB), 5yr (Black) vs 3yr (Blue) warranty for $5.00 more makes a lot of sense to me. </s>
<s> Good Luck on your system. </s>
