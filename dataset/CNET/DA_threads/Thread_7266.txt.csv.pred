1.2.1	Seems like you want to your PC to be a media center pc.	St
1.2.2	A cheap case that I like is the ThermalTake Soprano.	St
1.2.3	DVD burners are cheap; $60 or less gets you a dual layer.	St
1.2.4	Since you have an SLI ready motherboard, it makes more sense going with nvidia.	St
1.2.5	If you want a tivo type thing, then get a seperate tv tuner.	St
1.2.6	ATI all in wonders are good since it doubles as a t.v.	St
1.2.7	tuner and graphics card.	St

1.2.9	As I said, get a graphics card and a seperate t.v.	St
1.2.10	tuner card, or an external t.v.	St
1.2.11	tuner.	St
1.2.12	As for the graphics card, you have such nice specs on your system that you should get a better graphics card, and also your motherboard is SLI ready.	St
1.2.13	As I said before, you should get a Gefore 7800GT, but if that is to expensive then get this http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1648482&CatId=0 You can also put the 6800 GS in an SLI configuration.	St

1.3.2	Don't forget windows or arctic silver 5 thermal compound.	Sug
1.3.3	Suggest getting new creative xi-fi extreme music card instead.	St
1.3.4	Get a 6800gs gfx card and tv-tuner card.	St
