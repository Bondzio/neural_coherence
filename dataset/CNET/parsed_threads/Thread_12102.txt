<s> I foolishly installed CloneCD, and then decided to uninstall it, now my DVD drive won't recognise ANY discs at all (message: 'Insert disc in drive' even when i've put a disc in and double-clicked the drive icon). </s>
<s> I'm sure I read here somewhere (can't find the link)that CloneCD deletes crucial files and causes this problem...does anyone know how to remedy it? </s>
<s> My DVD drive is a Samsung SD-616-T, and yes, i've tried Samsungs site but couldn't find a cure. </s>
<s> All help greatfully appreciated! </s>
<s> Try this first. </s>
<s> Remove the upper and lowerfilters noted at http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;314060 Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
<s> I was following it to the letter but upper and lower filters weren't there... Any further help would be appreciated </s>
<s> It would be very odd to not have such. </s>

<s> Excuse my ignorance, but i've used the windows search function for the file name HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318} but I just get a message saying that it is not a valid folder... </s>
<s> Try the Regedit search for lowerfilters (the word.) </s>

<s> I think my computer is now possessed!!! </s>
<s> hahaha Since my last post the drive has started reading CD's and DVD's...on it's own!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!woohoo! </s>
<s> Thanks for the suggestions anyway, Bob. </s>
<s> Another post in which the owner walked in with a screwdriver to remove the case and the machine straightened right up? </s>
