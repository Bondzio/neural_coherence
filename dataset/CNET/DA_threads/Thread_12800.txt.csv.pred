1.1.1	I recently purchased a Hypersonic desktop - the small form factor .	St
1.1.2	I also purchased the on-site warranty .	St
1.1.3	The PS2 port does not work .	St
1.1.4	Well , I can use my USB mouse , of course , but I prefer to leave the USB port free for other things in the future .	St
1.1.5	Anyway , when I called them this morning they said that I should send the machine in .	St
1.1.6	No on-site warranty if they have to replace the motherboard ( which seems likely ) .	St
1.1.7	Of course , I do not want to do that .	St
1.1.8	For one thing , I need the machine , and for another , they were a month late sending me the machine , so who knows when I will get it back if I mail it in .	St
1.1.9	I really should never have done business with them again .	St
1.1.10	The laptop I bought from them has bad speakers , and now I am afraid to send it in , since I may never see it again .	St
1.1.11	Anyway , I am avoiding Hypersonic forever after this .	St
1.1.12	I should also mention that the software they gave me for the external modem does not install properly for some reason , and I have yet to hear from them about that .	St
1.1.13	I have made arrangements to make a formal complaint with the New York Consumer Protection Agency .	St
1.1.14	Maybe that will get their attention .	St
1.1.15	If anybody has any suggestions , please let me know .	Ques
1.2.1	as the company has been in business for some time .	St
1.2.2	It is always good to check about a company 's & quot ; on site & quot ; warranty .	St
1.2.3	Besides the New York Consumer Protection Agency , which I assume is like the Better Business Bureau ( BBB ) , I would write a letter to the president of the company .	St
1.2.4	Came across this old 2000 interview and this Mr. Fred Kohan may still be president .	St
1.2.5	http : //www.guru3d.com/interview/hypersonic-pc/index1.html	St
