To find this out I need to determine what kind of power source I already have in this cheap wal-mart computer, so can anyone help me? Or is there anything else I need to know, maybe I'm going about this wrong... any help would be greatly appreciated!

Take off the Computer side cover and there should be a box 9 x 6 x 4&quot;. On the side there should be a description, like 'ATX 12 volt' 'with 'PFC' etc. Then there should be a data sheet in small writing with wattage, etc. beneath the description. Depending on what card you bought, think about a minimum of 400 watts.
