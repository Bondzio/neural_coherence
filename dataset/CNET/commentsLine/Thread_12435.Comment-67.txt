i am wondering what level of help i could reasonably expect with a drive problem.
this wd 250 gb usb drive had worked fine when last used about 8 months ago.
it has been carefully stored and now will not be recognized in windows explorer.
the computer &quot;beeps&quot; when the drive is connmected and the device manager recognizes that there is a usb device without drivers installed.
the windows new hardware wizard tries to install the drive when first plugged in and is unable to.
i have two other wd usb drives that work without problem.
the blue power indicator light does not come on with this problem drive.
i have had little useful help so far from wd.
the diagnistics they want me to run can not be run because that program casn not see this drive.
how do i determine if there is something wrong with either the power connection to the drive or the usb connection to the drive?
how far into checking these things out can i expect wd to go?
the web page seems to say if the diagniostic tests fail then the drive is bad and they go no further in discussuing how to investigate the real cause of the problem.
has anyone had similar problems that were solved?
