I took a speed test for my internet: Download Speed was 781.7 Kbps Upload Speed was 215.5 Kbps Ok, I checked in network connection and its reported speed was: 100.Mbps How is that? The speed in the 2nd one, in Windows in Network Connections, is much faster, faster than any connection that a company advertises, excpet T3. Are they recording different types of speed? Just wondering, nothing serious. -Ibrahim

Your ISP can probably sell you a symetric (upload = download) connection, but will charge you more. Most people do not host their own website or download site, so asymetric speeds are fine.

Network speed is symmetrical, the same speed both directions. And network speed is between each PC on your network, or the maximum speed at the NIC. If you have a router and several PCs connected, on a good day you can get 100 Mb/s data transfer rate between the PCs. Wayne Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach that person to use the Internet and they won't bother you for weeks.
