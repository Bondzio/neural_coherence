<s> I bought a brand new seagate freeagent 500gb usb desktop external hard drive from CompUSA (on sale for $120 + tax). </s>
<s> I plan to use it on an older laptop running xp and hopefully a new pc (haven't bought yet) running Vista. </s>
<s> My question is: How can I get a bunch of data off an old PC running windows ME ? </s>
<s> The machine recognizes the device as a USB disk; but it is not available to browse in My Computer. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, s </s>
<s> The really new versions require zero linux skill and write to most USB drives. </s>

<s> ...the 9x/Me drivers for the external drive in place ? </s>
<s> Then- Apart from Linux or DOS, or an OS on a CD, there is &quot; Slave &quot;. </s>
<s> You boot a CD, some windows show up with drive letters and files and you copy them as you learned in Windows. </s>
<s> Now, what Linux skill did that involve? </s>
