&quot;i'm seeing entire drive contents vanish.
(not mine, just people bring me these things.
)&quot; all the drive files vanish.
&quot;always properly eject.
please.&quot; please shutdown properly.
&quot;next look into some sync program like syncback.&quot; if you are using a drag and drop method like explorer, look up syncback on google.com it may help you get what you wanted done.
&quot;in closing since the filesystems may differ, byte counts can differ.&quot; here's a wikipedia on filesystems since it's too big for me to put here and i can't condense it to one line.
