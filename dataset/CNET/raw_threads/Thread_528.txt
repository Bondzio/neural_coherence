I like that &quot;Bose&#174; IE2 Audio Headphones&quot; but it is not value for money product. Can you help me to get a good quality headphone? I need it to listen to some hip-hop music and mostly for good beats and sometimes soft music as well. Need to like go for jogging and it must be comfortable in ear also. If i listen for 2-3 hours then it must be comfortable. Hope you get me..:).. Thanks
