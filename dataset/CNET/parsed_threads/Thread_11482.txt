<s> I have two machines running WinXP Pro. </s>
<s> I use a Microsoft wireless Desktop (comfort keyboard and mouse). </s>
<s> When I try to use my Belkin Soho KVM switch neither machine will recognise the keyboard and mouse. </s>
<s> Has anyone tried a similar setup and had success? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I'm bringing this post back, because I'm trying something simliar. </s>
<s> I have a Dell Dimenson 8250 (desktop), a Inspiron 700m. </s>
<s> I hooked them both up to a 19'' LCD monitor using a Belkin KVM Switch. </s>
<s> I also use a wireless keyboard and monitor. </s>
<s> 2 Problems. </s>
<s> The desktop computer looks great on the monitor, but the laptop only fills part of the screen...any thoughts? </s>
<s> Additionally, the wireless keyboard and mouse work fine on the desktop but not the laptop, I really want to be able to use the keyboard for both? </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
