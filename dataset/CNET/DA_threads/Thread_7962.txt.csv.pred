1.1.1	I want to know if Mac users go through all the security updates like Window users.	St
1.1.2	I am tired of the updates.	St
1.1.3	I was told that Mac users don't have security updates like windows.	St
1.1.4	Is this true?	St
1.2.1	Macs need fewer (a lot fewer) updates/patches because of two things: * The operating system is much more stable and secure than Windows.	St
1.2.2	This, in part, comes from its simplicity.	St
1.2.3	*Such a small percentage of users have a Mac, that hackers don't devote much time to hacking it.	St
1.2.4	The more people that use it (Windows), the more appealing it is as a target.	St
1.2.5	Thus, Macs still have security and misc.	St
1.2.6	updates to download, but not to the extent of its Windows counterpart.	St
1.2.7	Hope this helps, John	St
