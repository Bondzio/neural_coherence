i don't mean to make the current plan with the new hdd (hard disk drive) take a step backwards (so to speak), but i thought i would try to revamp the original concept you were asking about in your first post.
in post 15 of this thread, r. proffitt issued a &quot;try this!!!
-&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot; suggestion to the article at the following website:  you began working through the &quot;try this&quot; article as mentioned in post 49, which was on 6-23-07. i now ask you the following: have you had the opportunity to successfully complete working through the two (2) methods and numerous steps to determine a success or failure with that suggested article?
i may be out of line with the following statements, but i would like to vent some frustrations i've had that originally prompted me to peruse through this entire thread and respond.
quite frankly, i'm surprised a moderator would bicker with a user with how to help instead of simply helping.
in post 27, said moderator explained why he declines to answer &quot;easy&quot; questions, which is, in and of itself, contradicting to the effect this is a forum where users help others.
if users wanted to find out information on their own, then they wouldn't post a thread with the topic of &quot;help me!&quot; in post 29, said moderator referred to his &quot;try this&quot; suggestion in post 15 without duplicating the suggestion as to avoid making the user try to find which post the suggestion was made.
(note the statement, &quot;.

hopefully save you many many hours.&quot;) i'm disappointed a moderator would use such antics as to avoid excessive posts while in the process create more strife (and, coincidentally, more posts) and wasting &quot;many many hours.&quot; anyways, in post 46, you stated, &quot;i want to make a complete backup, hopefully without the corrupt file that is causing the problem.&quot; this is close to where we want to be; however, i see two (2) fallacies in this statement.
1) a &quot;complete backup&quot; (aka image, among other names) literally copies everything in the computer/software, down to the error that prompted the backup (in your case at least).
furthermore (and this has been mentioned a number of times), creating an image of your computer and then transferring that image to a new hdd, in an attempt to salvage programs of which you no longer own any installation media, will only yield the same issues you are experiencing now.
2) it may not be a &quot;corrupt file.&quot; as we do not know the culprit of your situation, it could be, in fact, an issue in the registry (as the &quot;try this&quot; article attempts to examine and correct through the steps).
also, throughout the thread, you had a number of questions, a couple of which have not been answered.
as to what a usb drive is, that was answered in post 45. if you have any more questions about that, we can address this further.
just keep in mind that a &quot;usb drive&quot; has many different names.

as to what an &quot;interview&quot; is, that was something r. proffitt mentioned and never explained.
personally, i think he simply meant exactly what it is: an interview.
asking you technical questions and receiving technical answers.
if you ask me, that comment was a bit inane for this thread as he was obviously frustrated for whatever reason and was simply trying to ridicule you and try to make you look stupid and foolish because he wasn't getting the answers he wanted, even though this was a thread about you (namely: not him).
also, no one ever explained what acronis is.
it's simply a backup software.
search for it on download.com and you'll find it has a &quot;free to use; buy for $xx&quot; liscense.
personally, i stick to freeware apps and only buy hardware.
i was also thinking .
.
.
if you bought an internal hdd, are you still planning to do a &quot;double switch&quot;?
you would be better off installing the newer hdd as your permanent primary hdd and using that once you get everything onto it instead of doing the work twice over.

do you follow or have i misinterpreted your plans?
i hope this post answered all of your questions you had throughout the thread and addressed viable concerns.
