1.1.1	I have 2 X2Gen 22 & quot ; widescreen monitors on my office PC .	St
1.1.2	The monitor resolution is 1680x1050 .	St
1.1.3	The vid card in the PC could not drive them at that resolution .	St
1.1.4	I think I was able to get 1024x786 .	St
1.1.5	The card was 256mb .	St
1.1.6	I bought a 512mb ATI Radeon X 1650 Pro .	St
1.1.7	I can drive the monitors at 1280x960 .	St
1.1.8	But if I try both set at 1680x1050 60Hz refresh rate , one screen works fine and the other blinks on and off .	St
1.1.9	If I swap the cables at the monitor end the problem moves to the other monitor .	St
1.1.10	To me this means the problem is the video card .	St
1.1.11	The card says it has Dual Link Dual DVI output .	St
1.1.12	Should I use Dual Link cables ?	Ques
1.1.13	Should I be able to drive 2 22 & quot ; screens at 1680x1050 with this card ?	Ques
1.1.14	If not what card can do it ?	Ques
1.2.1	Yes .	St
1.2.2	There is another discussion about this on this forum but the bottom line for this monitor is you need that cable .	St
1.2.3	And one for each monitor too .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	dual link cables are only necessary monitors that exceed 1920x1200 .	St
1.3.2	it sounds like you 're using an ati clone or extend mode that is merging a single display over both monitors rather than dual displays .	St
1.3.3	reduce your resolution back to 1280x960 and check your windows display properties .	St
1.3.4	do you have 2 monitors or 1 ?	Ques
1.4.1	Vid card is ATI Radeon X 1650 Pro with 512 meg vid RAM .	St
1.4.2	2 DVI connectors .	St
1.4.3	Windows properties show 2 screens .	St
1.4.4	Native resolution on the screens is 1680x1050 .	St
1.4.5	I want all the screen real estate that that resolution gets me .	St
1.4.6	And anything other than native resolution is extrapolated and never as crisp .	St
1.5.1	if so , ensure media center is configured without TV support and get the latest catalyst drivers from http : //ati.amd.com/support/driver.html if you 're running xp , also get the catalyst 7.4 drivers .	St
1.5.2	after you 've installed them , turn off the the right-hand monitor and reboot .	St
1.5.3	next , open catalyst control center 's advanced view and select & quot ; displays manager & quot ; , ensure you only have 1 monitor detected , and set your desired resolution and color depth .	St
1.5.4	select & quot ; digital panel properties & quot ; and enable & quot ; alternate dvi operational mode & quot ; .	St
1.5.5	now turn on the right-hand monitor , go back to & quot ; displays manager & quot ; , and click & quot ; detect displays. & quot ; click the 2nd monitor and set your desired resolution and color depth .	St
1.5.6	go to the 2nd & quot ; digital panel properties & quot ; and enabled & quot ; reduce dvi frequency on high-resolution displays & quot ; .	St
1.5.7	if that does n't work , enable & quot ; reduce dvi frequency & quot ; on the first digital panel also .	St
1.5.8	as a last resort , you could use the dvi-vga converter and use your 2nd monitor with a vga input .	St
1.6.1	Using XP Pro .	St
1.6.2	Did not install any of the Catalyst stuff .	St
1.6.3	Just the plain drivers .	St
1.6.4	Got the Dual Link cables late yesterday .	St
1.6.5	Plugged them in this morning .	St
1.6.6	Both monitors running 1650x1080 , 60Hz , 32bit color with no problems for 8 hours .	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
