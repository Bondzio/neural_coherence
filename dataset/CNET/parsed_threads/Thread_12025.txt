<s> Hi I have a client who requres tablets for a number of users. </s>
<s> Am having problems sourcing the best tablet: Requirements: O/S Windows or Android as a vital app they/program they use is only available on Windows or Android 3G capability (either through direct sim or dongle) as they work rurally and will not always have a wifi connection Be able to print. </s>
<s> We have had trouble finding a printer in NZ that is cheap enough to purchase and is easily connected to by the tablets. </s>
<s> Seems to be a hard ask finding Samsung tablets in NZ at a reasonable price. </s>
<s> Any ideas would be really helpful. </s>
<s> I haven't found connections to printers to be any harder than usual for Windows 8 Pro tablets than in the past. </s>
<s> Maybe you mean something else but I'm seeing folk demand easier than the usual. </s>
<s> They want no drivers, it just connects and prints. </s>
<s> Is that what you are seeing? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks - yes thats not a problem with Windows8 but its also finding a tablet that is 3g compatible which is causing the issue. </s>
<s> Any ideas on a tablet that meets all those needs? </s>
<s> Why is not too interesting except it gives us a better choice of carriers, lower costs. </s>
<s> As importing is a problem I can't share models we see in the USA. </s>
<s> But it appears you have yet to find any in your market. </s>
<s> Doesn't that clarify that what you want is going to be something in the future? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Am going to find a forum in nz! </s>
<s> Thanks again </s>
<s> You probably won't find what your looking for in a retail or online consumer outlet for a pure Tablet based device. </s>
<s> My advice is to check with the local NZ wireless providers for a tablet based device as they will have to support the data/wireless plan for Windows or Android and the hardware was most likely designed specifically for them. </s>
<s> By comparison Apple supports the iPad regardless of wireless carrier because they own the hardware and OS. </s>
<s> The units with cellular are rarely outside the normal carrier channels for well discussed reasons. </s>
<s> I can't cover this in full detail but here we use the run of the mill tablets but a hotspot box for the reason I gave and more. </s>
<s> You seemed concerned with costs so it seems you either forge an alliance with the cellular carrier or take a big risk in importing something. </s>
<s> I've seen a few try that here and they get burned later. </s>
<s> But folk will continue to try it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
