<s> My friend has a Lynksys model #WPC11 ver. </s>
<s> 3 PC card in a Toshiba laptop connected to a Linksys 2.4 GHz.802.11b router. </s>
<s> Youtube stuff stutters and jerks when it tries to play. </s>
<s> The router is connected to Comcast cable in an urban area. </s>
<s> Where can I get up to speed (heh) on the new technologies, like g and N? </s>
<s> Any web sites or info would be very much appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Since wireless -b, -g and -n are all faster than typical cable Internet speeds, getting a faster wireless setup (wireless adapter plus wireless router) likely will not help. </s>
<s> A test: Disable the wireless adapter and connect the laptop to the router with a standard network patch cable. </s>
<s> Does the problem persist? </s>
<s> What's the model number of your Toshiba laptop? </s>
<s> What OS are you running? </s>
<s> To learn about wireless standards and speeds, try the websites for the major wireless router makers: Linksys, D-Link, Netgear, etc. </s>
