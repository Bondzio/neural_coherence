If I could make two guesses, I would say likely culprits are video card or memory.
A missing or defective video card will do such as will defective memory.
If you have more than one memory module, you can insert them one at a time into the first slot (usually slot &quot;0&quot;) and see if you can make it work.
Another common one I have seen with AGP video cards is they are not quite seated properly even though they seem to be.
Check this closely.
As for the key lock, these are sort of outdated but were used to disable the keyboard...sort of a cheap and ineffective security device.
Hope this helps.
