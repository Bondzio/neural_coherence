So after 6 years of ownership of a now sluggish and ancient Dell Dimension e520, I've decided it's easier to run a clean install of Vista to boost performance rather than bother with uninstalling programs, etc.
My question is, should I still use the 250 gb Seagate Barracuda 7200.10 hard drive that came with the system?
Or am I rolling the dice by doing a fresh install on a drive that old?
I bought a new WD 1TB 7200 Caviar Blue to add as a 2nd drive for storage, but now I'm wondering if I should use it instead as my primary drive and use the 6-year-old drive for extra storage.
What do you all think?
