hopefully this will take you to the correct site.
the link is copied and pasted from the web page.
the psu needed is a &quot;atx +12 2.0&quot;.
the &quot;2.0&quot; version psu or higher is the one needed.
most come over 400 watts which is also better for supplying the needed amps.
the higher wattage the less strain and heat produced from the psu.
if link above does not work, may need to do a search on &quot;emermax pc power supplies&quot;.
