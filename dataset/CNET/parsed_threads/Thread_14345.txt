<s> Canon MP800/950 - seems to offer excellent quality but no ADF, fax MP780 - excellent set of features but outdated HP 7210/7310/7410 - inks are too expensive Others - so-so quality Will there be an updated version of the canon mp780: a business-like multifunction with photo quality prints? </s>
<s> I really want ADF, if only the MP800/MP950 has that feature, or an add-on that can fix that. </s>
<s> I already have a Canon ip4000 and since the MP780 is built around that printer, it doesn't actually qualify as an upgrade. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The ip4000 and mp780 have the same printhead and carts so you can be assured that you can interchange them. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The MP780 is excellent in text and photos and solid in graphics. </s>
<s> The MP800/MP950 is not much better, maybe faster. </s>
<s> It does look sleeker. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> The MP800 has the new nazi carts which means high quality carts from http://www.swiftink.com can't be used. </s>
<s> You can still refill but it's turns off the low ink warning and writes a notice to the memory. </s>
<s> Also voids the warranty even though this is illegal in the USA. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> The MP780 has ADF and fax and cost less money, $200 on sale at OfficeMax and: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16828102161R http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16828102161 I would snag the MP780 it's the last of the V8. </s>
<s> That's exactly it.. </s>
<s> I'm looking for a printer (multifunction actually) that prints better than what i currently have. </s>
<s> And since I'm hunting for a multifunction, it'd better have an ADF, or better yet, and ADF + fax. </s>
<s> I just wish canon release a new multif. </s>
<s> with an ADF... </s>
<s> The MP950 looks good and uses 7 carts maybe they will release a MP980 that has the ADF + fax on it. </s>
<s> I'm only guessing though and the MP950 is already listed at $449 so I would hate to see how much a MP980 model would be. </s>
<s> I can't imagine Canon wants their flagship to be the MP780 for very long. </s>
<s> http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ProductCatIndexAct&fcategoryid=103 Keep a watch on their site for the MP980. </s>
