it looks like it could get locked in on two corners, but i can't even fit the heatsink into the bracket.
i could force it, but then i risk doing some serious damage and i still wouldn't be sure that there is good contact between the heatsink and the chip, so no dice.
the heat sink that's in there now measures 63mm x 89 mm.
the new one i bought is 68mm x 83 mm.
that extra 5mm is really killing me.
