<s> Trying to upgrade boot drive (80GB) to 100GB (both Western Digital) have partitioned and set active, formated NTFS. </s>
<s> Have not had any luck transfering to new drive. </s>
<s> Tried using &quot;Data Lifeguard Tools&quot; no go.. tried &quot;PartitionMagic&quot; wouldn't work also tried to use &quot;Drive Image&quot; 100GB drive has been working as a slave in computer. </s>
<s> Added larger drive for backup want to use 100GB for os. </s>
<s> Tried using Recovery Console now every time I try to boot off drive computer goes so far and reboots.. </s>
<s> You're right. </s>
<s> Partition Magic is not a system transfer utility but I am curious as to why your Drive Image program did not work. </s>
<s> First, you need a version that supports XP w/NTFS and I believe this means 5 or above. </s>
<s> You don't use the image function but the drive copy function of the program. </s>
<s> Since I have used this many, many times with and without success, I would be curious as to what went wrong and, if you still have the 80 gig drive in tact, maybe try again. </s>
<s> Now, if you did not override the default to hide the original partition of the drive you are copying from, you cannot use it without reversing this. </s>
<s> You do not partition and format a drive before using drive copy from Drive Image. </s>
<s> Next, it seems you got something transfered and tried to use the recovery console but it sounds as if you'd be better off doing a repair install. </s>
<s> The rebooting behavior can occur if you've breached the hardware change limit and a repair installation / reactivation can fix this. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
