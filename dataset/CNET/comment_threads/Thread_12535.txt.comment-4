If the router has multiple jacks to plug the RJ-45 cable into, it has a switch built into it.
This is probably the easiest way to go.
Individual users could add ZA or another software firewall if so inclined but as long as they don't have File and Printer Sharing enabled and shared folders on their machines, they should be ok for most uses.
Sygate personal firewall is another easy to use one FREE for home use.
If the router only has one output, you may be able to put the switch on the downstream (PC) side of the router and have everyone connect.
You may want to do some additional checking on that one though.
