1.1.1	I currently have an old computer and need to upgrade it's old slow processor.	St
1.1.2	I have the AMD Athlon XP 3000+ with 1.5GB of Ram running Windows XP home.	St
1.1.3	I need to know which newer processors are compatible with my current configuration and what prices are like as I have no idea.	St
1.1.4	Thanks,	St
1.2.1	if you don't know this info, install cpu-z: http://www.cpuid.com/ the 'mainboard' tab will have the info.	St
1.2.2	the 'cpu' tab's name, and package will show the exact cpu and socket type.	St
1.2.3	if your athlon 3000+ uses socket 754 (which has been obsolete for a number of years) there will be no new CPUs compatible with it.	St
1.3.1	OK so I installed cpuz, my main board shows no manufacturer in the box but it does have a model number (K7S8X).	St
1.3.2	It is running American Megatrends BIOS.	St
1.3.3	For my socket it says socket A 462.	St
1.4.1	http://www.asrock.com/mb/overview.asp?Model=K7S8X Do you have the manual ?	Ques
1.4.2	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	You need a new system, go with a cheap mATX board and a cheap Pentium Dual Core, as the Athlon XPs are completely phazed out and rarely available, so i advize you to build a new system, rather than upgrading the old one, its cheaper and it also allows for newer technology.	St
1.6.1	I guess I'll open up and check.	St
1.6.2	I also do have the manual.	St
1.7.1	I will consider that.	St
1.7.2	I will need to upgrade this machine or get an entirely new one sometime anyway.	St
1.8.1	course of action.	St
1.8.2	Then you're starting the project with the facts.	St
1.8.3	VAPCMD	St
