Currently my computer is hook up to TV as the monitor and I feel the video card is not good enough because it is blurry and I have tried to change the setting, but it still not clear on file name but all other looks fine. I always have a hard time to see the file name on the desktop. So what kind of video card is good when the desktop is hook up to the TV. Also if I brought a new PC that don't have S-video card to hook up to the TV, can I take the s-video card from the old pc and install to the new PC. I will appreciated if anyone can give me some advice on what to look for when I shop around for a new PC. Many Thanks

If you are using anything but the latest sets (which are designed so that they can be used as monitors as well as TVs) then you are going to get blurry video. The best thing you could do would be to either get a new TV that specifically states it can be used as a monitor or buy a dedicated monitor. The upside to this is that a good monitor will have incredible picture quality if you want to watch a DVD on your computer, but the picture will be darker than usual. Denise
