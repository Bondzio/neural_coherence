<s> Ok before you tell me I should build my own or have one built or get a different computer..I cant its not my choice and it has to be a Alienware computer. </s>
<s> My budget is $4,250 thats with taxes and a 3 year warranty plan, and a 19 or 20 inch monitor. </s>
<s> I would like dual processors and a real good graphics card. </s>
<s> I also want 4gb of ram. </s>
<s> I would like to be able to expand on the ram also.. </s>
<s> It will be used alot for 3d modeling and animation, graphic design and some good gaming. </s>
<s> So 4,250 budget with tax, on WWW.Alienware.com 19/20 inch monitor 3 year warranty plan Duo Core Processors 4gb of ram (hopes of expandibility) a real nice graphics card 300 gb hard drive atleast 7200rpm(maybe raid?) </s>
<s> Thanks guys any help you can give would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> A) Do not waste any money on 4GB of RAM. </s>
<s> I gaurantee that you will never ever use more than 2GB of it. </s>
<s> Also as of now, 4GB is the max and Alienware does not offer any computers with motherboards that will allow more than this. </s>
<s> B) You really need to decide on what you want to do with your computer. </s>
<s> It is impossible to build a computer that will be perfect for both gaming and graphical design: 1)If you take the gaming route, then you will want a graphics card designed for gaming (nVidia 7900GTX for example). </s>
<s> Also you will want a faster hard drive, a 10,000 RPM raptor drive which Alienware offers. </s>
<s> 2)If you take the 3d modeling route you will want a graphics card designed for these applications (nVidia Quadro series or ATI FireGL series). </s>
<s> You will also want more space so going with a 7200RPM 300GB drive would probably be the best bet. </s>
<s> Now, since you want to combine the two of these options, its good to go for the Duo Core Processor like you have selected. </s>
<s> Also, you can get 2 different hard drives. </s>
<s> You can select a 7200RPM 300GB harddrive for all your 3d application stuff, and a 1000RPM 80GB drive for all yours games. </s>
<s> This is just some things to keep in mind when configuring. </s>
<s> I'd recommend the Alienware Area-51 7500 for gaming, or any of the MJ-12 workstations for 3d applications. </s>
<s> Hope this helsp a bit. </s>
