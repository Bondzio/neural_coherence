Hey, thanks heaps for the reply.
I am copying the pictures and music from my computer to my HTC (running android 2.2 I THINK, not positive how to check this I'm a bit of a newb).
The files themselves are not read only but when they are put on the card they become read only as is everytihng else on the card, and I try to change it but they wont stay that way.
I have tried transfering the files onto the card via my phone/USB connection and a USB microSD adapter if that makes any difference.
