1.1.1	Ok so im a trainee in a IT dept , and i was tasked to configure a WAP ( WAP-6011 Level One ) .	St
1.1.2	The WAP needs to be configured to extend a network from a WIFI router so that coverage is available for all corners in the office .	St
1.1.3	Having little knowledge in networking , this task was meant to provide some exposure on configure network devices .	St
1.1.4	However i cant seem to get the WAP going .	St
1.1.5	I 'd tried almost every single operation mode that is given with universal repeater seems to be the most plausible option to go for , in which i can get connected to the WAP from other devices but no access to internet .	St
1.1.6	Any guides/pointers would be much appriciated .	St
1.1.7	( Do excuse my posting should it contain any errors because its my first time posting ) .	St
1.2.1	I think it 's best if you go and talk with your mentor or supervisor or whatever he 's called , and ask for a little bit of help .	St
1.2.2	After all , a traineeship implies being trained .	St
1.2.3	And showing you 're open to learn from him makes a good impression .	St
1.2.4	Kees	St
1.3.1	It might .	Res
1.3.2	It 's just that i 'd like to somehow try myself first before i go to my supervisor for help else it 'll make me look like a lazy person no trying .	St
1.3.3	So far the options i tried I had no clue or whatsoever they does so it does help if you give me some general idea/description on where should i be heading towards .	St
1.3.4	Thanks for the reply	St
1.4.1	Then you get out the book on the product and follow its install/setup procedure .	St
1.4.2	If it requires information about the installed system you ask for that .	St
1.4.3	I 've encountered new IT staffers that get upset as I go to the manual and we read it together .	St
1.4.4	They do n't last long .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
