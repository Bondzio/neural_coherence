<s> My PC crashed (OS windows XP Home)and i want to retrieve data from the 80gb SATA HD. </s>
<s> I have removed HD and inserted into a USB SATA caddy enclosure. </s>
<s> I have connected caddy to my laptop (OS Vista) which displays as a local disk G. when i try to open it requests that i need to format the disk in drive G before i can use it, if i do this will i lose data,how can i access the data?? </s>
<s> If it helps, in disk mgt drive G is RAW file system and has healthy,active primary partition status. </s>
<s> Please help </s>
<s> The filesystem shouldn't be RAW, but NTFS. </s>
<s> That's why Vista says it needs to be formatted. </s>
<s> And, indeed, you'll lose everything that's on it. </s>
<s> Zero assumption recovery (from http://www.z-a-recovery.com/ ) usually is able to get the data from such disks. </s>
<s> Worth a try, although not free ($49.99). </s>
<s> It's up to you to decide if your data is worth that much. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> Kees, many thanks for your prompt response. </s>
<s> I used ZARs free evaluation version to recover all my precious family snaps. </s>
<s> Many thanks. </s>
