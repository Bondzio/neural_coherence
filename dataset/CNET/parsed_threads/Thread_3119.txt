<s> Hello - I'm thinking of buying the Samsung 244T widescreen LCD for my PC. </s>
<s> I'm also buying a new PC and want to make sure everything's compatible. </s>
<s> What will I need as far as a video card? </s>
<s> I know that some PC games are compatible with 16:9 ratio, but what about the ones that aren't? </s>
<s> Will they be stretched out or just normal size (4:3) on the screen - with black bars on the left and right of the screen? </s>
<s> Any help is much appreciated? </s>
<s> Thanks Tim </s>
<s> If a display ain't wide enough, black bars appear along the top and bottom. </s>
<s> If it's too wide, I'm sure black bars appear on the sides instead. </s>
<s> As for a vid card, just check to see it supports widescreen resolutions (divide the numbers to see if you get the 16:9 ratio) </s>
<s> I run the http://www.widescreengamingforum.com We work to find solutions for individual games. </s>
<s> Each game is different in it's support of widescreen. </s>
<s> Some games won't support it, and you will have the option of stretching or black bars. </s>
<s> Those that do support a non-stretched resolution, might not have a perfect FOV. </s>
<s> If your montior supports 1:1 or Aspect Scaling, then you won't have any problems. </s>
<s> If not, Nvidia offers this option in their drivers. </s>
<s> ATI does not. </s>
<s> You won't see a widescreen res in your driver list until you hook up a widescreen monitor. </s>
<s> They should appear automatically. </s>
<s> If you're looking for a res that isn't there, you'll have to add it manually. </s>
<s> You can use a tool called Powerstrip to do that. </s>
<s> I believe you can also add custom res in the driver panel in Nvidia's driver set. </s>
<s> I have posted a query along the same lines but I now wonder if its a coincidence that the vast majority af TFT's are standard 4:3 aspect. </s>
<s> Perhaps widescreen is more bother than it's worth as there are few unknowns about standard monitors. </s>
