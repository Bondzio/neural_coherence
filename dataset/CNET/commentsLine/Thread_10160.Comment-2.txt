i am so sorry for the above message.
i was in a terrible fix when i wrote it last night.
i can hardly make heads or tails out of it myself this morning.
what it comes down to is the fact that i can't get a second hard drive bootable.
i have tried to install it on the second hard drive cable as well as the second c.d.
rom cable.
jumpered as slave.
i can't get the hard drive to recognize in the bios to install the operating system.
i can use all of the help that i can get.
thanks for the patience and help, laraine
