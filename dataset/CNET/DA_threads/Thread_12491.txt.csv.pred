1.2.1	It sounds like the McAfee firewall is blocking your access .	St
1.2.2	If you still can not connect , try an ethernet cable to the Linksys router and see if you have a connection .	St
1.2.3	If you have a connection to the Linksys router , try updating the firmware and Broadcast SSID .	St
1.2.4	Use WPA security .	St
