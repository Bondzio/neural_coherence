But I'm reasonably confident I can install a new card . . . took computer data from CPU-Z software - recommended somewhere here I'm only going to watch internet video (TV networks and Netflix) with this computer - connected to a 1080 hd samsung TV. that's it! Don't need anything special; but have no idea how to find a graphics card that's compatible with MB thanks in advance Let me know if I forgot some spec you need Happy Holidays! Kelly

Proffitt	12/20/12 2:40 PM	1.3560144E12	I didn't see the computer's power supply	But look at the usual ATI 5450 1GB low profile compatible card you find for 30 bucks at newegg. It's a sleeper of a card that has HDMI and enough oomph without need to change the power supply in all the boxes I've seen. Bob

If I'm looking at the right card - it says pci express 2.1; and DDR3 memory .. does it have it's own memory boy I really don't know anything about this . . .. ;- ) thanks kelly

Sorry but the card's memory is only of interest to those that dissect cards. Here we need a video card. The memory could be DDR, static or core and it would not matter to the host PC. Bob

It's refurbished (joy systems) - so I'm not sure that the components are original - it could actually be 'rebuilt' - with some other components but this was the description: Lenovo IBM ThinkCentre M55e Desktop PC - Intel Dual-Core 1.6GHz, 2GB DDR2, 80GB HDD, DVD-ROM, Windows 7 Home Premium 32-bit, Also - won't buy from newegg anymore - nothing but headaches with UPS lost shipment . . . but found this at tigerdirect: http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=7373215&CatId=1558 looks very similar and heck of a deal . .
