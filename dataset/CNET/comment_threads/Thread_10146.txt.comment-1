Hi, I'm about to start my undergrad this fall and hopefully major in Industrial Engineering.
Every living fibre in me is telling me to get the new MacBook but I can't help but wonder if a PC would be much more suitable for my studies.
I'll be using the laptop mainly for music, movies and work.
So, Mac or PC?
