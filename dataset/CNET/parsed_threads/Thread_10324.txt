<s> Hi guys, I'm looking into buying a new Wireless-N Router. </s>
<s> Linksys or Netgear? </s>
<s> Anyone experience either one of these makers? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Netgear is what I have It has WPA security. </s>
<s> That's what you need for your router to be secure. </s>
<s> I'm sure the other one has WPA security. </s>
<s> Just remember to update the firmware for your router, since most come shipped with outdated firmware. </s>

<s> Some of the firewall options are better in the Linksys. </s>
<s> Example? </s>
<s> Block an IP range. </s>

<s> I just switched from a Linksys wireless G router to a DLink Extreme wireless N router - DIR 655. </s>
<s> The difference is night and day. </s>
<s> Now the kids play their online games and the internet works perfectly. </s>
<s> No one complains of slow load times. </s>
<s> I had to many issues with the Linksys. </s>
<s> Set up with the DLink was a breeze. </s>
<s> Consider this one another option. </s>
