I wanted to see if I could gather up some ideas and suggestions from fellow technology enthusiasts. I thought I would show you my current workstation and ask for any comments or suggestions you might be able to offer. I want to make it look more modern and advanced. Oh and of-course this is on a budget. I also would love to see photos of other peoples work stations, especially the ones in my field. I am an Architectural Draftsman. I spend most of my day designing and modeling our homes. It would also be nice to see other multiple monitor systems. I look forward to seeing what you all have.
