1.1.1	Every time I start up my computer I get & quot ; Checking NVRAM & quot ; .	St
1.1.2	What is that ?	Ques
1.1.3	I 'm not sure when it starting but it takes about 40 seconds to complete and then my computer starts fine .	St
1.1.4	Boot time is longer now and I ca n't remember when this started or what I installed when it did start .	St
1.1.5	If I restart my computer at any time it does not do this check .	St
1.1.6	If I hit escape when starting up it stops the & quot ; checking nvram & quot ; but am I doing some time of damage when I escape this check ?	Ques
1.1.7	I ca n't find anything in my bios set up to by-pass this check .	St
1.1.8	In other words I have by-passed checking the A drive in boot up but can not find anything about this NVRAM thing .	St
1.2.1	Did you recently update your bios ?	Ques
1.2.2	Sounds like the bios settings are in default and your memory is being check everytime you boot .	St
1.2.3	You can turn that off in the bios settings at boot , just hit the & quot ; delete & quot ; key during boot and the bios screen will come up .	St
1.3.1	Typically Non-VolatileRAM is used to store the BIOS code itself , as well as your BIOS settings .	St
1.3.2	Checking NVRAM generally consists of running a checksum on the NVRAM contents to determine if the contents have changed .	St
1.3.3	I have no idea why your BIOS is running a self check now where it seems it has n't before , but it certainly should be harmless to let it run .	St
1.3.4	If the NVRAM is being held by the battery , it may be that your battery is low .	St
1.3.5	( although that is not usually the kind of NVRAM used for the BIOS )	St
1.4.1	Thanks !	St
1.4.2	It seems you know what you are talking about .	St
1.4.3	I have seen this in other computers that I 've worked on and I have told the client the same thing .	St
1.4.4	Just let it run .	St
1.4.5	I guess I feel kind of stupid not knowing why this is happening to even my own computer now when it was n't for years .	St
1.4.6	I really appreciate you taking the time to answer my question , again thanks !	Polite
1.5.1	Hi there .	St
1.5.2	Thanks for taking the time to answer but in this situation make/model or even OS are irrelevant .	St
1.5.3	Even the motherboard type is irrelevant .	St
1.5.4	I have seen this on many types of machines .	St
1.5.5	I had googled several things prior to posting this message .	St
1.5.6	I found that most folks had errors or problems when getting this kind of behavior .	St
1.5.7	In my case there are no errors or problems other than my lack of patience while waiting for my machine to start up .	St
1.5.8	But thank you anyway .	Polite
1.6.1	Hi , I updated my bios long before this started happening .	St
1.6.2	I have changed my bios so it is not set for default .	St
1.6.3	Also there is no setting to disable this particular & quot ; check & quot ; .	St
1.6.4	Thanks so much for your suggestions though .	St
