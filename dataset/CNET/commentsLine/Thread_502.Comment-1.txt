hello, i just bought a notebook with that being its processor, and now am having some serious second thoughts.
i know that the celeron is for the &quot;budget&quot; users, and does not hold up too good when compared to the pentium m. my question is, the celeron m processor is 1.50ghz/1mb cache/400mhz fsb and the pentium m processor 730 is 1.60 ghz/2mb cache/533mhz fsb to me it looks like its just a small difference.
i mean, its just a .1 difference for the # of ghz, and 1 mb for the cache, etc.
what do these numbers mean anyway?
can somebody explain it relatively?
would a .1 difference in ghz be that big?
if it would help, i'll be using my notebook for lots of multitasking, but just between word documents, internet, playing mp3's and small videos.
i wont edit videos on it or anything, but will want to watch dvd's and download music.
and for gaming, just want to play sims 2.
