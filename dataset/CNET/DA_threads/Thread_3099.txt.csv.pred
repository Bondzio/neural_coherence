1.1.1	I need forum recommendations on good reliable memory sticks , 4x4 GB or 8x2 GB ( do n't sure which is better ) .	St
1.1.2	Mostly PC will be using for games and some audio recording .	St
1.1.3	Do n't know what clock 1866 or 2400 ( O.C . )	St
1.1.4	for motherboard will be better .	St
1.1.5	Can somebody share his experience with me ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thank you !	St
1.2.1	But stable I can do .	St
1.2.2	I go to crucial.com Bob	St
1.3.1	Head to newegg.com and pick out some ram with those heatsinks and good looks ( colors are fun . )	St
1.3.2	And then read the reviews there .	St
1.3.3	If no one complains that 's a sign .	St
1.3.4	Buy that !	St
1.3.5	But in short , prepare for the support vacuum as you exit the airlock and overclock .	St
1.3.6	Bob	St
1.4.1	http : //forums.anandtech.com/showthread.php ? t=2344114	Ques
1.5.1	I was thinking that may be wider audience will be more helpful sorry for duplicating my question on another forum	St
1.6.1	These forums do n't seem to attract overclockers .	St
1.6.2	Most of the discussions are about boring stable or how to make it boring stable .	St
1.6.3	I 'm sure some folk love whiz-bang ( go very fast and crash ) but I think the best advice is to read the user comments and then leave support demands at the door when overclocking .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	No , I 'm not going to overclock .	St
1.7.2	All I need is a future proof system for the next few years to play games , like Skyrim , FarCry3 , Biosgock Infinite , Last Metro 2033 etc .	St
1.8.1	For games we go to the GPU .	St
1.8.2	You have a fine CPU so let 's read something about bottlenecking the GPU .	St
1.8.3	& quot ; Our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $ 225 LGA 1155 Core i5-2500K and a $ 1000 LGA 2011 Core i7-3960X , even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved .	St
1.8.4	It turns out that memory bandwidth and PCIe throughput do n't hold back the performance of existing Sandy Bridge-based machines .	St
1.8.5	& quot ; http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-cpu-review-overclock,3106-4.html OK , so there little gain here .	St
1.8.6	I 'd go to THE LIST at http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html Bob	St
1.9.1	Your cpu supports 1600 ram ... native .	St
1.9.2	You said you want 16GB of ram .	St
1.9.3	Your cpu and mobo support quad channel .	St
1.9.4	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx ? Submit=ENE & N=100007611 % 20600006073 % 20600006127 & IsNodeId=1 & name=DDR3 % 201600 % 20 % 28PC3 % 2012800 % 29 Pick one .	St
1.10.1	recommendations on RAM for your MB .	St
1.10.2	Just be careful of DIMMs with tall heatsink as they can be difficult to install under large CPU heatsink fans .	St
1.10.3	GSkill DIMMs with tight timings , CL9 or better , run well in systems I 've put together .	St
1.10.4	Like others have suggested ... .gaming relies heavily on GPU so it pays to get something decent ... .if you ca n't live without ultimate detail at the highest resolution ... .you wil pay and pay and pay .	St
1.10.5	Not enough bang for the buck for me .	St
1.10.6	Also make sure the have a good PSU for whatever GPU you select .	Sug
1.10.7	Having a good stable PSU with enough reserve power is required for stable , reliable gaming PC .	St
1.10.8	Let us know how it works out .	St
1.10.9	VAPCMD	St
1.11.1	Thank you !	St
1.11.2	I have GTX 295 videocard and 1000wt PSU .	St
1.12.1	NIL	St
1.13.1	video performance .	St
1.13.2	Perhaps a faster GPU or even a second GTX 295. http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107-7.html By the way ... .what RAM are you running now ?	Ques
1.13.3	VAPCMD	St
1.14.1	If you want to utilize all the RAM slots then go with 4x4 otherwise go with 8x2 .	St
1.14.2	The 2400 ( o.c ) will be always better then the 1866 as it has high speed and the best RAM manufacturer 's are Corsair Vengeance and G.Skill ripjaws .	St
1.14.3	You can also check for the vendor list for your motherboard and decide which type of ram suits your configuration .	Sug
1.15.1	That was a top of the line gpu ... ... .4yrs ago .	St
1.15.2	If you 've got 100 bucks you could replace that with a hd 7770 and double your gpu power .	St
1.15.3	As an extra benefit you would use 2/3 less watts .	St
1.16.1	now I have 4 gb Corsair dominator , but going to buy 4x4 gb Corsair Platinum 1886 or 2133	St
1.17.1	Or is it 4 x 4GB for 16GB , or 4 x 1GB for 4GB and what speed ?	Ques
1.17.2	If you 've already got 16GBs , might just better to get a second GTX 295 or perhaps a single GPU that gives you a good bump without spending a fortune to get it .	St
1.17.3	It 's a never ending chase for more speed with a diminishing return on investment .	St
1.17.4	VAPCMD	St
