Over at www.pcpowerandcooling.com you can find PDF documents with exact dimensions of what I will call &quot;standard size&quot; ATX power supplies. While I've grown familiar with these to the point I can just look at the PSU then check the connections a new technician will need such a document and learn what the ATX, ATX12V and other power connections are as well as determine if the replacement supply has enough of each connection. One owner spent a year seeking out a PSU because they couldn't find &quot;the right one.&quot; They were looking for one with exactly the right number of power connections but imagine them passing up unit after unit because it has &quot;too many&quot; power connections. Hopefully this won't stop you. Tell me how it turns out. Bob

While you can find replacement psu of larger wattage, it will be expensive for the reason mentioned. HP does offer larger psus for sale if they still have them in stock. Just be sure whatever replacement psu you do get is HP compatible and what the return policy is if a mistake is made. Understand typical generic psu won't work in the HP system unless you're lucky due to tje physical size and shape of the psu in question. Google HP replacement psus online. As for PCPowerandCooling, they're very expensive but darn best quality you can get. tada -----Willy

Now go here. http://www.pcpowercooling.com/ Click on the &gt;contact. Send them an e-mail. Tell them what you want to do and include all the make/model/s# of what you have. See what they have to say.
