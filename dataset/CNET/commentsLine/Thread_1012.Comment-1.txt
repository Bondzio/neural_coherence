please let me know if i should post it there.
i recently purchased a linksys wrt54g wireless g broadband router and a wmp54g wireless g pci adapter.
i hooked the router up to the cable modem in the basement and the pci card to my computer upstairs (win xp home sp2).
i get a good, strong signal as long as i have the ssid broadcast enabled.
when i disable it or try and set any of the other security settings i lose the connection upstairs.
i have gone to the linksys site and downloaded all the current driver updates.
i also called the support number a couple of times but got the standard &quot;unplug the card and reinstall it&quot; type suggestions.
when i open &quot;network connections&quot; on the computer with the pci card in it and click on &quot;view available wireless networks&quot; there aren't any listed, even after using the &quot;refresh network list&quot;.
strange, considering that i am online now using the wireless connection to access this forum...lol according to the xp help and support information, there should be an &quot;add&quot; option in the related tasks menu of the choose a wireless connection window, but there is no such option .
so i am at a loss as to where i can input the security information so the pci card can communicate with the router.
last but not least, i have un/reinstalled the pci card and disc a few times and, according to the user's guide included on the installation disc, there should be a &quot;wireless network monitor&quot; icon in my system tray but there is not.
there is no &quot;custom install&quot; option so i would assume everything on the installation disc is being installed.
i would appreciate any suggestions.
i am worn out from going up and down the stairs only to find that nothing is working...lol sysytem specs : windows xp home sp2 amd athlon xp 2200 1.8ghz 768mb ram
