They had the USB 2.0, but after they partitioned and formatted it, the drive worked fine in the box. They tested it by putting the drive into the PC and again it was unreadable. You may have to use some laptop to desktop adapter (they are cheap) to drag your data off this drive. Bob

Tried my new 100g seagate in box same result. Tring to find way to use both drives already formated on my laptop without having to remove one to use the other.I guess what I am saying isthat I would like to use the drives by selecting which one is the boot on start up but my bios does not seem to do that.If I take the one out of my computer,just get error message it does not see the one connected to the usb as bootable.

Just that in many USB 2.0 drive cases, you have to partition and format such in the new USB 2.0 case. Many wish it wasn't so, but this is how it is. Hope this makes it clear how things work. Bob

I'm game to refomat it re partition or what ever; but how do I find it to do these opeerations?
