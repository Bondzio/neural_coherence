1.1.1	I am running Windows Xp SP3 with an Asus A7V600 Mobo , CPU is an AMDAthlon XP3200+ Barton core , 1 Gb SDRAM by Corsair , 1 ATI 9600XT Graphics Card w/Dell 21 & quot ; LCD widescreen , 2 HD 's ( 1 SATA & 1 IDE ) , 1 Asus 52x CDROM ( IDE ) , 1 Plextor PX-755SA DVD ( SATA ) writer and 1 Plextor PX-708A IDE writer with all drivers and firmware updated running ECDC 7 basic including Drgtodsc which is what I use most to move all my data and programs to my dvd+rw 's .	St
1.1.2	Everything was working fine for a good while , then I burned some audio cd 's with windows media player 11 and all went fine .	St
1.1.3	Then I ripped some cd 's with windows media player with no problems .	St
1.1.4	Then I tried copying some data files to my dvd+rw where I keep all of my saved programs and that 's when all my troubles started .	St
1.1.5	Windows does not recognized my dvd 's as dvd 's .	St
1.1.6	It shows them as cd 's .	St
1.1.7	I have checked just about everything there is to check according to the searches I have done through Google and my dvd shows up as cd 's and I can not read or write to my dvd 's at all .	St
1.1.8	It gives me an error , & quot ; please insert disk & quot ; and the dvd is in the writer .	St
1.1.9	It also says media not recognized .	St
1.1.10	I put my dvd+rw in either writer and it just shows it blank and i know I have plenty of data on them .	St
1.1.11	I can put cd 's in my dvd 's and read , copy , move , etc .	St
1.1.12	to them all day , but of course I can not write to them .	St
1.1.13	I use a Linksys Router for my firewall and I also have a firewall for spyware , adware , and all those other kind of baddies that try to get through to my PC and I have not had any problems on that end that I can find .	St
1.1.14	I ran some rootkit scanners and they come up okay .	St
1.1.15	I think something changed when I ran media player to burn the audio cd 's , because everything had been running fine for a good while .	St
1.1.16	If it was happening on just 1 dvd , I could surmise that it might be bad but , since I have two burners doing the same thing I think something else has happened and I need some big time HELP !	St
1.1.17	I have uninstalled Roxio ECDC 7 basic and some other things advised by others and still nothing good has come about .	St
1.1.18	If someone out ther could give me some help I would be greatly appreciative .	St
1.1.19	Thanks a bunch for listening .	St
1.2.1	Never has .	St
1.2.2	But about ECDC .	St
1.2.3	A recent poster noted they had to get some update from Roxio and it worked .	St
1.2.4	I wo n't go find that for you but Windows XP does n't know what a DVDRW drive is .	St
1.2.5	Never has and never will .	St
1.2.6	Do n't try to fix that .	Sug
1.2.7	Work on your Roxio issue .	St
1.2.8	& quot ; I can not read or write to my dvd 's at all .	St
1.2.9	It gives me an error , & quot ; please insert disk & quot ; and the dvd is in the writer. & quot ; Research removing the UPPERFILTERS and LOWERFILTERS entries in the registry if no media is being read .	St
1.2.10	Also if you use any packet writing software you have to reinstall that or the media is not readable .	St
1.2.11	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for your advice .	Polite
1.3.2	I understood what you said and I went for a fix for Roxio ECDC 7 and software .	St
1.3.3	I uninstalled Windows XP Pro SP3 , then updated SP2 , then I uninstalled Internet Explorer 7 and it reverted to version 6 and I updated version 6 and then I did a clean uninstall of Roxio ECDC 7 basic .	St
1.3.4	Then while leaving my computer with Windows XP Pro SP2 ( updated ) and Internet Explore 6 ( updated ) , I reinstalled Roxio ECDC 7 Basic from my Plextor DVD and everything has worked fine ever since .	St
1.3.5	I had to make a few adjustments as they came up , but none were real hard and now I can write to my all my optical drives with Roxio ECDC .	St
1.3.6	DrgToDsk works great again without a hitch .	St
1.3.7	Again thanks alot for steering me in the right direction .	Polite
1.4.1	Sorry I could n't tell you exactly what to do but sometimes it helps to read what others have run into .	St
