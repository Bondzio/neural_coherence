I've been using my Linksys Wireless B USB network adapter ver 4 to get my Internet connection for about 3-4 years now & I know they there is something newer & better than my linksys network adapter out there.
I want something that does exzactly the same thing & hooks up to my laptop exzactly the way my Linksys does....just something more modern & perhaps more powerful.
Any suggestions?
Please & thank you!
