i my computer had been turned off and without power supply for four hours, if not longer when i initially removed the faulty ram.
by the time i received replacement ram, my computer had been sitting, turned off, without power supply for two weeks.
i don't think i need to worry about that.
however, when i took it into a shop this morning; the guy told me my mobo had still managed to short itself and i'm in need of a new one -.-
