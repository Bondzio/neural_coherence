<s> I installed a new lexmark x3470 all-in-one printer/scanner/copier last week on my computer. </s>
<s> I have xp with sp2. </s>
<s> Today I turned on my computer and it took about 10 minutes to boot-up. </s>
<s> If I unplug the printer cable from the computer it boots up as fast as ever. </s>
<s> Any ideas why? </s>
<s> when this happens? </s>
<s> The printer was turned off, but I uninstalled the software for the printer and then re-installed, and everything seems ok. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
