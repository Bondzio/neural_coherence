1.2.1	I would expect such an overtaxed power supply to show many such issues .	St

1.3.1	I apologize for the typo , PS = 350w .	St
1.3.2	I also have two HD 's 40G & 2.5G Plus CDROM & CDRW and 2 addn'l case fans .	St
1.3.3	Being a dinosaur , and having 350w instead of 180-200w , Problems with the PS never entered my head .	St
1.4.1	Thanks , Bob for your help and quick response .	St
1.5.1	1. http : //www.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/ & quot ; It happens more often than many users realize .	St
1.5.2	An old graphics card or a slow processor runs smoothly and without a peep for weeks , and then suddenly , after a system upgrade , system failures start occurring with nasty regularity .	St
1.5.3	Frequently users blame problems like this on sloppily programmed drivers or hardware mined with errors. & quot ; Read the rest .	St
1.5.4	2. http : //www.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/ & quot ; THG continues to receive hundreds of e-mails regarding the causes of sudden and sometimes frequent & quot ; crashes & quot ; of users ' computers and computer systems .	St
1.5.5	As these computer crashes are random and unpredictable , users are losing important data and other critical information as a result .	St
1.5.6	These issues of & quot ; stability & quot ; can cost hours of use time while the system is continued to be tinkered with in vain in an effort to resolve the issue .	St
1.5.7	When this occurs , ambitious users are inclined to search for the cause in the processor settings , system memory or on the motherboard , since the Front Side Bus , CPU core voltage and GPU of the graphics card are often pushed to the limit to achieve maximum performance .	St
1.5.8	This results in the user resetting all of the system parameters to default values - but to no avail .	St
1.5.9	The computer continues to crash , eventually so frequently that it is no longer possible to continue using it. & quot ; More fun reading .	St
1.5.10	In short , even if your 350 Watt unit worked when new , pulling so much from it ages it quickly and its capacity dwindles to about 70 percent of new in the first year or less .	St
1.5.11	I ca n't tell if this is your issue today , but it does continue to show up in the 300 and 350 Watt units daily .	St
1.5.12	The in-shop test is to just pull up a 450 ( or larger ) PSU , attach it ( we do n't unbolt the old unit ) and see if the problem vanishes .	St
1.5.13	Bob	St
