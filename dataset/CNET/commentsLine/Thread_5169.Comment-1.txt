hi!
when trying to play &quot;age of conan&quot; or &quot;freerealms&quot;, or the star trek online beta after a few minutes i get a crash, which according to win7 is being caused by atikmag.... just upgraded drivers and catalyst control center to 09.12 (also tried removing the catalyst control center because a post on the web said that might be the problem (it wasn't).
tried switching off aero, tried 9.12 hotfix, tried re-seating memory (ran windows &quot;memory diagnostics utility&quot; showed no problems) nothing doing any good... help please!
