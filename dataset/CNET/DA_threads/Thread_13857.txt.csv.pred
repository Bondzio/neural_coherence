1.1.1	I 'm sorry if my question may be redundant .	Polite
1.1.2	I 'm just short of time to study every thread in forums.I 'm a soldier currently deployed in Iraq .	St
1.1.3	I 've been able to get internet access through one of the contractors here for some of our soldiers .	St
1.1.4	We have a couple of ip addresses .	St
1.1.5	We have the main line coming from the contractor going into a router with lines going to a couple of computers and one line going to linksys router .	St
1.1.6	I have one of the ip addresses in the linksys router ( model befsr41 v2 ) , so we could connect up some more computers .	St
1.1.7	Most of the laptops hooked to the linksys work fine by just setting the tcp/ip to obtain ip and obtain dns automatically .	St
1.1.8	I have a couple of computers that get the error message limited or no connectivity , when hooked to the linksys .	St
1.1.9	I can hook these same computers on the lines where we just assign static ip 's and they work fine .	St
1.1.10	I 've tried setting these up with the appropriate ips given in the owners manual but that has n't worked either .	St
1.1.11	I also have another computer that will work if I give it a static ip address but if I go through any router to obtain ip automatically it just sits and displays acquiring network address .	St
1.1.12	I 've read in some stuff that xp sp2 causes problems , and some winsock stuff , but I 'm not sure if that applies since these will connect using a static ip and not through a router .	St
1.1.13	Any help would be greatly appreciated and this problem is not just with a linksys routers because I 've been asked to help out with a couple of computers in our personel office , but they just get the acquiring nework address bug , while they have other pc 's that work fine .	St
1.1.14	sorry about the length , but I tried to explain the best I could .	Polite
1.1.15	thanks in advance .	Polite

1.2.1	Set the linksys to hand out more ip addresses ?	Ques
1.2.2	You did n't say what number of DHCP items you have it set to .	St
1.3.1	I have the router set to hand out 10 ip addresses .	St
1.3.2	The most computers I have hooked up at a time is 3 because we have only 3 cables .	St
1.3.3	As for the problems our personel office is having , it could be that they do n't have enough ip 's set in the router they are coming off of .	St
1.3.4	The computers they ca n't get to connect always gets acquiring network address .	St
1.3.5	Thanks I 'll look into that for them .	St
1.3.6	Do you suggest anything else it could be .	St

1.4.1	intermittent swapping of a few cables around amongst many client systems on the network can cause exactly the problem you are seeing .	St
1.4.2	Unfortunately , it 's not quite as easy as sharing an electric outlet - you plug your shaver in and shave for a bit and then after you 're done I plug mine in .	St
1.4.3	When a modestly intelligent router is turned on , it polls all the ports to learn who is out there and where .	St
1.4.4	It builds a little table in its memory of the MAC addresses ( serial numbers ) of the client adapters it finds , assigns an IP address to a port through its DHCP server , and then uses that information to send data out the appropriate port as needed .	St
1.4.5	When a client system is shutdown normally , it will release from the network and the router will remove it from the routing table .	St
1.4.6	However , if you just unplug the cable from one and connect it to another , the router wo n't recognize the new connection ; it still is expecting the old client MAC address at that port .	St
1.4.7	When you rearrange the physical layout of the network , you will have to at least go through a full shutdown of the exiting system , change the cable to a powered down system , and then boot the new client system normally so that it registers itself with the router .	St
1.4.8	In an extreme situation you may even need to reboot the switch .	St
1.4.9	That means everybody goes down for a few minutes while one cable is swapped and then everybody comes back up together with the one new partner in the dance .	St
