Ailing Philippine Airlines and prospective investor Cathay Pacific Airways have clashed over the laying off of PAL workers, prompting PAL to revive talks with another foreign airline, an official said Tuesday.
PAL resumed domestic flights Oct. 7 and started restoring international flights last month after settling its labor problems.
