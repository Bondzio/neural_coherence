Back 'in the day' we went to great lengths to eliminate ESD.
After leaving 'the industry', in my home usage I make sure I take the basic precautions, although devices are much better protected (internally) than they used to be.
When I work on PCs, I just wire my wrist to the ground lug on the outlet box, and make sure the PC is also connected to same.
I never pick up a board/component unless both connections are made.
About soldering irons - don't use the cheapos that are just the 2-prong versions.....think about it...there's 120V there, maybe the tip of the iron isn't QUITE neutral...use a good iron system (Weller comes to mind) Most good irons will have the tip connected to earth ground.
The whole idea is that you & the board/computer are always at the same potential.
Keep in mind that most static is generated when you get up from your chair/desk etc...after you get up, don't touch anything unless/until you are again grounded.
