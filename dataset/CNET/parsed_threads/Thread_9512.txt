<s> drives in 2 different computers. </s>

<s> Bad cables, bad motherboard drivers (or no one installed such) or too much heat in the case or out of date firmware in the drives... </s>
<s> Given that the media is never perfect, I'd clear the logs and ignore them if the machine works fine. </s>
<s> Again, if you only get this in the logs, I would not fix it. </s>

<s> other problems involving sudden memory dumps an what appears to be corruption of programs. </s>
<s> The programs that seem to cause the problems are ones that were installed from CDs via DVD-ROM. </s>
<s> Thats why I'm suspicious of it after the error reports. </s>
<s> Suspecting OEM PS was too small (325watts) given 4 optical drives plus removable thumb drive, scanner, camera, I had a 450 watt PS &quot;dual fan suitable for always on applications&quot; installed about 1 month ago. </s>
<s> The air being blown out is cool to the skin of my hand. </s>
<s> The motherboard & chips are Intel as are the drivers and the extreme 2 on board graphics & drivers. </s>
<s> MB is Intel 865GBF and drivers are a version released in Feb/05 for that MB. </s>
<s> Given this additional info does it suggest another idea? </s>
<s> &quot;Out of date firmware&quot;: Not sure what that means: 6 months old standard DVD-Rom is too old by type? </s>
<s> Or : May be worn out already and need replacement? </s>
<s> Thanks again for your thoughts. </s>
<s> Its like telling a doctor the test results and not saying why such tests were performed. </s>
<s> I'd start over and at least honor the forum note you see with each post. </s>

<s> After much Google Searching for &quot;Toshiba SD-R2002 the device, \Device\CDRom0, has a bad block&quot; I found: &quot;You will need to go to the Device Manager and open the 'DVD\CD-ROM Drives' listing. </s>
<s> You will Right click on the &quot;SD-R5002 DVD-ROM Drive&quot; and select 'Un-install' from the Drop Down Menu. </s>
<s> Do this for all listed drives. </s>
<s> Do not re-boot on this step. </s>
<s> Next you will need to open the &quot;IDE ATA\ATAPI Controllers&quot; listing. </s>
<s> You will need to right click on the Bus Master IDE Controller and select 'Un-install' from the drop down menu. </s>
<s> You will be prompted to re-boot, so do so. </s>
<s> It will need to re-detect the devices and will take longer to boot. </s>
<s> Once it finishes it will prompt for a second re-boot. </s>
<s> After that finishes, try the drive again.&quot; My Event Viewer showed the error &quot;the device, \Device\CDRom0, has a bad block&quot; which led to the above search and apparent fix for an older Compaq Presario laptop. </s>
<s> It all started when I tried to run Acronis True Image and it failed. </s>
<s> The problem has probably existed for several years because I could never &quot;burn&quot; a CD at faster than 2X. </s>
