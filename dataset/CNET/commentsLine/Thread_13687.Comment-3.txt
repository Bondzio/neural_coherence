if your colleague's tv has matching inputs, it'll work fine.
use the vga out on your laptop + a standard vga (dsub) cable.
a heads-up: resolution on tvs is lower than computer monitors, in the sense of pixel size.
which is just fine because we usually sit next to our computers, but view tv from a distance.
so it's not any different than a regular lcd monitor, but it is what it is.
1080 lines is great for tv, not going to be crystal sharp up close as a computer monitor at that scale.
for a business/mobile style laptop, even a 19&quot; monitor will feel like a nice big screen when working at a desk, so i'm confident you'd like the 22&quot; lg, too.
but hey, bigger is better, eh.
