3469	0	160405	1780056	NR	cmetat2	3/1/06 1:10 AM	1.1411754E12	New Computer	I am really confused about buying a new computer. I am saving up for a top of the line computer and I am stuck between 4 companies, Alienware, Falcon Northwest, Dell, Voodoo. I am leaning towards Alienware because I really like their cases(I'm a sucker for cool cases), but I have read nothing but negative things about their customer support. I have also read that Falcon and Dell both have really good tech support. Not sure about Voodoo's support. Help please!

When Alienware introduced the cases, sales really took off and thier support dropped as well. Basically, they outgrew themselves and haven't caught up. Plus, the users they sell to are bound to demand the most from thier systems as gamers typically punish thier systems going to extremes. Even though Alienware makes good systems, its still off the shelf componets, they simply put it to together in a cool way(duh). But, the other vendors do well too, exclude Dell for now. Check those others and see what they got. If none do well, you can buy a Alienware &quot;looking&quot; case as many are out there really jazzed-up cases for DIY'ers offering pretty much the same item. VooDoo seems to be relatively new and none have come across my repair bench, but then again, alot of $2K+ systems rarely do, those $400 ones all the time, I exclude servors and such. tada -----Willy

Im planning on spending 6000 to 8000 on a high end gaming computer so I just wanted to make sure the company I go with has good technical support (at least enough to act like they care). Falcon Northwest from what I have read has excellent customer service. I'm not in it for just the cool case but if I spend this much on a computer I figure I should get what I want. Thank you for your help!
