Re: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7591-0.html?forumID=26&threadID=39852&messageID=467204 Hey old buddy, New 450 watt PS ws delivered today.
Installed same, and my old odd noise is gone.
Of course this supply has 2 fans, so now listening to a bit more &quot;whoosh&quot; noise.
But this is totally acceptable, compared to what I had been hearing, so PS did fix my problem.
Just wanted to let you know.
