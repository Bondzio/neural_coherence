The laptop itself won't boot (even from Linux on a CD). So, if I get an external enclosure, is there anything I need to know? I've read that you need to format drives to get them to recognise, but as this is 'recovery mission', that obviously isn't an option. Any help/advice as to the type of enclosure or the process itself would be greatly appreciated. -Nav

Usually it's 9.5 mm but while I'd say that I'd bet on it the odds are not as good as item 1. 3. If the drive can't be read in your new machine, notable names to look up are: PC FILE INSPECTOR GETDATABACK ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY 4. Also, do a little research ahead of the move with these words in google.com XP TAKE OWNERSHIP Bob

If the drive fits into the enclosure, (PATA drive for PATA enclosure, SATA drive for SATA enclosure.)you should be able to access your data, after &quot;taking poscession&quot;, if necessary. As for formating the drive, your old drive with data should have already been formated. The &quot;formating&quot; you referred to concerns a brand new drive fitted into the enclosure.

My drive (an IBM Travelstar) has a wider interface than the enlcosure, with two layers of ~20 pins. The enclousure (a Dynex) has only one layer. Did I get a SATA interface for a PATA drive? As usual, the help is sincerely appreciated. -Nav
