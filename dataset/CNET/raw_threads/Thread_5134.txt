I get the following messages on the two frequently used computers on the LAN: Status: Limited or no connectivity You might not be able to access the Internet or some network resources. This problem occurred because the network did not assign a network adress to the computer. If clicking Repair does not restore connectivity, the problem might be with the network, not with this computer&quot; I tried to repair and this was unsuccessful. I updated my Lavasoft Ad-Aware SE Professional ref. file (23.03.2005) recently and i read something about some people having network problems after. I am using an IBM ThinkPad (XP Professional SP 2, Intel Pentium M 1400MHz 598 MHz. 256 MB of RAM). I had to connect to internet via 56k Modem. I just updated ref. file (11.04.2005) on this IBM and i am now up-to-date on Windows Update. The other computer is a &quot;clone&quot; (correct term?) running XP Home SP 2, Pentium 4,...) The LAN was running perfect 2 days ago up to now and i checked all cables. DSL modem says all go. Is there any other information u need? I need my internet back!

Usually a driver the person who installed or they didn't know to install. Today I'm finding too many that think all they need is on the Microsoft CD or &quot;driver update.&quot; Think again. Bob

I noted that many new Windows installers thought Microsoft would fetch drivers for us. -&gt; This has never been true. The burden is entirely on the owner/user/installer. The magic button &quot;Update Drivers&quot; is nothing but a demo. Bob

I think if you plug your DSL modem into your other PC and share it that way it'll work..... still I'd buy a new one.
