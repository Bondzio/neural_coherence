i have seen this problem before, and it has not been resolvable.
some systems just don't leave it on all the time, even if the bios and windows are both correctly configured to leave it on.
check out this article for settings windows to leave it on, but i have found it to be enabled and numlock still would not stay on until pressed, so it may not help.
