I'm looking to get a new wireless router because I'm upgrading my internet speed (it's going to be at 12Mbps) and want to take advantage of it.
So far I've looked at a limited number of them, and the main one that has caught my attention is the Netgear Wireless-N Router WNR2000.
I don't want to spend much more than $100, but I want to make sure I get one that will allow me to seemlessly do everything I want (use internet, watch movies through netflix with GOOD quality, HD movie streaming, gaming, etc.).
Would this Netgear one be good enough to handle that?
Or does anyone have any other suggestions that they know would handle all this?
Thanks!
