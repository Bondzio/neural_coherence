Well, first i think you should download HD Tune from http://www.hdtune.com/ So you can throughly check your hard drive for problems and the SMART Status if your Hard Drive supports it.
Bad Sectors do tend to spread over time.
YOU CAN fix bad sectors if you really want to save your drive, and the software i recommend for that is HDD Regenerator @ http://www.dposoft.net/ however it is shareware but it can repair the first bad sector it finds.
If you have alot of bad sectors like you think you might have then it probably can restore your drive back to good working form if you buy the software, or better yet buy a New Hard Drive as they are not expensive nowadays.
