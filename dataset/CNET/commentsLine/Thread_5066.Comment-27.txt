asking us to help you choose the solution at the which part to buy level.
hardware systems and operating systems are optimized differently ...some chipsets have max addressable ram limits and so do some oss so knowing what pc system or motherboard you have, what os you're running and what you're using the pc for often helps us help you better.
vapcmd ps...when you buy from crucial specifically for your motherboard or brand make/model pc...they guarantee compatability.
if you buy essentially the same ram (same spec) from any etailer usually under another part number... crucial doesn't warrant compatability.
you can always return or exchange the ram with the etailer but who wants to go thru that?
ps....what's &quot;bml&quot; ... bill me later ?
ps2...i've used aol and observed it used a lot of ram....you might be better off browsing without it.
