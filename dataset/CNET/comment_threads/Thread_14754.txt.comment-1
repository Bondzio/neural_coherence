I currently use a Powerbook, and I access the internet though our AirPort Extreme router.
Recently, for some reason, although I am on the right network, and signal strength is full - I am unable to connect to the internet!
I've called my provider, and everything is fine on their end according to their systems.
I've tried power cycling, and checking my settings, and everything SEEMS to be ok. Am I doing something wrong?
What do I do?
I am very frustrated.
Please help.
