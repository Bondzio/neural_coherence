the problem you are having is a real pain if you own an older model 17&quot; mb pro but if you have the latest model then simply decreasing screen res should do the trick.
current model mb pros don't suffer the slightly soft, out of focus screen that results when you use any setting other than the highest screen res.
but if you did buy an older model then you are just going to have to live with command+ every time you open a new browser window.
or you can decrease screen res and learn to live with the slightly soft screen.
1600 x 1000 is the lowest setting i can tolerate but image/text will still appear proportionally smaller than on a 15&quot; mb pro set to a native res of 1440 x 900 or a 20&quot; apple cinema display set to its native res of 1680 x 1050.
