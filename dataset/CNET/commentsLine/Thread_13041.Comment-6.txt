having had this discussion some hundred times i can only share the story about how most will not accept the diagnosis.
many will run back home to reload the os, post on forums and search for drivers to correct the failing card.
to make it more fun the card may spring back to life for a time almost as if it is taunting the owner.
i've found that all i can do is share the story and wait for the owner to give up trying to save the internal card.
but you may wonder why i no longer replace the internal card.
it's very simple.
ready?
it only fails again and then the shop is on the hook to replace it.
since we know this we refuse to replace the card and offer only one fix.
it's noted above.
