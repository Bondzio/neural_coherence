the situation in usa is different to australia as here computer shop builds of desktops are far superior to brand name.
the pcuser magazine, almost monthly set a set of criteria to build a desktop too and the larger computer shop builders always are superior and cheaper.
only occasionally do brand name desktops get anywhere near the selected criterior, that also includes price and performance.
pc user magazine is the largest computer mag in australia and is highly regarded within the industry.
many local computer shops are crooks here too, so by getting a desktop built to a pc uers specification can be the only safe way to build a system if you are not very computer savy.
when you buy a desktop here you get much more detail as to what is inside than usa sites i have looked at.
good computer shops will give you a full 3 year hardware warranty as this is what good manufacturers give.
a good shop will just replace any faulty parts and deal with the manufacturer for you.
if components are sourced from a chinese supplier direct, not a local agent this causes all the warranty problems.
our overall pricing is cheaper here than usa our au$ is worth 75 cents us.
overall computer salesman here are rated like car salesmen,not reliable and they tell lies.
a good honest local techie is hard to find especialy if you know about computer hardware and cannot be bluffed and lied to.
