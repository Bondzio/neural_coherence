<s> I have a non-branded PC that my brother-in-law put together for himself and the passed it over to me. </s>
<s> It has a AMD x52 chip and runs on XP Pro. </s>
<s> I have a constant problem of where it boot's up everyday mysteriously. </s>
<s> I always shut it down completely in the evening. </s>
<s> Without fail in the morning it is running. </s>
<s> I have the Mcafee virus and spyware scan but doesn't seem to pick up anything. </s>
<s> If I shut the main switch behind, then it does not start up on it's own. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>

<s> Other people. </s>

<s> Wake on LAN, Modem, etc settings. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> The BIOS has that feature to wake at a scheduled time. </s>
<s> It sounds like the BIOS has a startup timer in it. </s>
<s> Just disable it. </s>
<s> A dumb question. </s>
<s> How do i get into the bios. </s>
<s> Is that at startup? </s>
<s> To get into the BIOS, you have to do it before the Windows startup screen. </s>
<s> It is the screen that you see where it says 'press [a key] to enter CMOS, or BIOS'. </s>
<s> This (key) is probably [delete], [F1], or whatever else it says. </s>
<s> After you press the correct key, you should be taken to a blue or gray screen. </s>
<s> Just look through there (don't tamper with anything that you don't know what it is) and find something to the effect of a 'timer'. </s>
<s> When you find the timer just disable it. </s>
<s> (Oh, and the BIOS is controlled with the keyboard, there is no mouse. </s>
<s> And be sure when you find and disable the timer, save the settings. </s>
<s> To save it, it is usually the [F10] key, if not, it should say how at the bottom of the BIOS screen) </s>
<s> Everything except the &quot;PME Event Wakeup&quot; was enabled&quot; I am going to disable that and try it. </s>
<s> That's probably it, because 'PME' stands for &quot;Power Management Event&quot;. </s>
