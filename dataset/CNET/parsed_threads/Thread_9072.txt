<s> I recently installed a third harddrive in my comp for more storage space. </s>
<s> after turning the comp back on and formatting the partition, i have had nothing but trouble. </s>
<s> the comptuer is going slow. </s>
<s> (eg, playing winamp, if i try to open firefox, it will start stuttering...it is truly horrible) Is there any way to find out what the problem is? </s>
<s> my system: 512 ram 2.4 GHZ pentium 4 the harddrives: 80 gig primary, 2 secondary at 200 gig and 160 (the 160 is the new one) any help would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> If the CPU usage is constantly 100%, then it is your CPU. </s>
<s> If not, check Physical Memory. </s>
<s> If there is not much available, then that might be why. </s>
<s> I honestly don't see why the hard drives would give you any trouble anywhere. </s>
<s> i checked my physical memory, and increased it. </s>
<s> does it matter which drive the physical memory is on? </s>
<s> i honestly tried putting physical memory on all drives ( i dont even know what that does...) the cpu is not constantly at 100, it just gets jammed up it seems. </s>
<s> if i try to do things at once, the comp slows down considerably... </s>
<s> If the added hard drive in some manner has caused the CPU to run at a higher temperature, it is possible that the CPU is being internally throttled down due to the higher temperature. </s>
<s> The stuttering would be typical. </s>
<s> Maybe you blocked airflow in some way. </s>
<s> The drive adds more heat, but that alone should not do it. </s>
<s> Did you accidently disable a fan? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> if it is a heat issue, wouldnt the problem be more progressive, and more pronounced over time? </s>
<s> right now, i start the computer after hours of it being off and it will stutter. </s>
<s> i keep it on for a week straight, and there is no worsening or improvement of the situation. </s>
<s> im sorry if i sound stupid saying this, i am definitely no expert when it comes to computers (hence why i am here, lol) </s>
<s> installed the new HD --&gt; system slows reomve new HD --&gt; what happens? </s>
<s> Where are all of your drives located (HD and optical)? </s>
<s> Where is your drive with the operating system located? </s>
<s> Primary IDE master Primary IDE slave Secondary IDE master Secondary IDE slave SATA Other? </s>
<s> overheat in minutes or fractions thereof. </s>
<s> in the computer helath section of the BIOS, after it has been on for a few minutes, hit the reset and then look in the BIOS. </s>
