<s> Restart in safe mode and set the card to the refresh rate of the monitor. </s>
<s> Also set the resolution to the monitor's default. </s>
<s> For DirectX we need to click Start, Run and enter DXDIAG Wait a moment and click on the RIGHT MOST TAB labeled &quot;More Help&quot; Click on &quot;Override&quot; Set the Override value to 60 for your first test. </s>
<s> Click Ok. Click Exit. </s>
