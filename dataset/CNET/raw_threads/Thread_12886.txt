14424	0	145555	1629630	NR	justanothernoob	12/27/05 9:29 AM	1.13567574E12	graphics problem?	well i just got a new computer and its working great so i decided to go download FEAR(demo) since my last computer i had whould blow up if i tryed to and as i got in the game everything was perfect i could play it at the max settings at 1024 by 768 with 4AA and 8AF and be like 90 some percent always over 40FPS. But when i walk around a corner or something or see a corner with shade on it sometimes it gets kind of edgey and feels like its draging. my computer spec is AMD X2 4800, 2 GB of RAM, geforce 7800 GTX 256mb. I hope you guys can understand that its kind of hard to decribe. thanks for the help.
