<s> how do I connect my case led temp wires ie.. were do they need to be they look really primative almost like im just supposed to tape the wire to the cpu and hard drive. </s>
<s> PLEASE HELP ME. </s>
<s> temperature sensor. </s>
<s> You can locate that anywhere that you would like to check the temperature at. </s>
<s> DO NOT tape over the sensor, that will cause erroneous readings, however, you can tape the wire just back from the sensor to hold it in place. </s>
<s> Probably a waste to put it by the CPU since there is very likely a sensor in the CPU mounting socket under the CPU that gives valid CPU temp readings. </s>
<s> Maybe locate it near your hard drive, or video card if you have a hot running video card. </s>
<s> Since hot air rises, possibly locate it high in the interior to see if the air in the upper part of the interior is too hot. </s>
<s> Hopefully, you can keep the interior ambient air temp below 38C [100F], anywhere in the interior. </s>
<s> Shoot to keep it down near 33C [91.4F]. </s>
<s> Try at different locations to get a temp profile of your system. </s>
