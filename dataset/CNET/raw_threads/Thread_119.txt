I have just bought a SONY VAIO NR38M and as soon as I turn the wireless function switch on the front to 'on' it makes my WRT54GS wireless router restart over and over. It does this every 20 seconds while the wireless is activated!! I checked my PS3 (connected via it's wireless function) and my old laptop (that has a Belkin USB wireless adaptor) to see if they were going to affect my router, but they never did before and still don't! The baffling thing is, that I bought the vaio 3 days ago and it's only just started doing it! As soon as I got home and started it up it connected fine, but the past 24 hours it has started to have this effect on the wireless router! I have tried power-cycling, but this had no effect. Please can anyone help?!?!

The laptop/router works fine if I connect using an ethernet cable, so it's something to do with the vaio's wireless!!!......I'm clueless!!

And yes, it has something to do with the Vaio but as you can guess it's been discussed and no router should crash on such a connection. If the router crashes then you are proving the bug in the router. Bob

My neighbour has a different make router (netgear) and he's given me the pass code to access it, and it connects straight away and there are no problems with router! I'm able to use his wireless perfectly!! Well, off to the shop I'll be going for a new router! Think I'll get a netgear one too as this seems to work ok! Thanks for your help.
