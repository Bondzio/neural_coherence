1.1.1	hello everyone, i'm going to buy a tablet soon but i just don't know wich one to choose.	St
1.1.2	my budget is around 500 dollars.	St
1.1.3	things that are important to me are a large memory (expendable via micro sd works for me too), a fast device, absolutely zero lag, a great screen and great looks.	St
1.1.4	at first i was thinking to buy the apple ipad mini 64 gb or the ipad 4 32 gb.	St
1.1.5	please help me out, thanks	Ques
1.2.1	I've yet to see any device with no zero lag.	St
1.2.2	Can you share why a tablet at all?	St
1.2.3	It sounds as if you were shopping for a gaming laptop/tablet.	St

1.3.2	But I'm still on my laptop.	St
1.3.3	Go figure.	St

1.4.1	hey, i'm not buying a tablet for gaming and stuff as i already have a gaminglaptop.	St
1.4.2	i'm just looking for a tablet with fast webbrowsing and short loading times for things like youtube, email, spotify... the tablet will be used at home because i don't feel like booting my pc up every time i want to check my email.	St
1.4.3	and with &quot;zero lag&quot; i do not mean zero lag, i mean the fewest lag possible (sorry for my english).	St
1.5.1	The tablet with the lowest lag will not be one we can discuss as even if I noted it here, it would be out of date by tomorrow.	St
1.5.2	The top 10 are all nice and I have one of those in the 10 and another model of another in the 10.	St
1.5.3	Why not one of the top 10 models?	St
1.5.4	Bob PS.	St
1.5.5	Correction.	St
1.5.6	I don't own these.	St
1.5.7	The office is porting apps so I get to use them a lot.	St
1.6.1	i decided to buy the ipad mini 64 gb.	St
1.6.2	just got it yesterday and i love it!	St
1.6.3	fast response and fine build quality, also a quick tablet overall.	St
1.6.4	the only downside is that is has no retina display, but the screen is still magnificent!	St
1.6.5	thanks for the advice!	Polite
1.6.6	bye	St
1.7.1	i decided to buy the apple ipad mini	St
