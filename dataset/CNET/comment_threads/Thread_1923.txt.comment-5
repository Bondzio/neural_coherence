With a card for your laptop, the antenna is confined to a very small space and thus will not get very good reception.
With a USB adapter, designers are free to add an external antenna and make it as effective as possible.
I have gone through both adapters and by far the usb adapter is the best.
I have much fewer dropped connections and it really makes my life easier.
Hope this helps
