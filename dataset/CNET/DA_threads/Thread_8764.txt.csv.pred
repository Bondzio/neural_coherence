1.3.1	http : //www.ehow.com/how_2012292_reset-axim.html this is the link for the soft and hard reset .	St
1.3.2	The password that i wont to reset is for the EMC Navisphere Express .	St
1.4.1	The Dell Axim the link you give refers to is Pocket PC ( PDA ) ; pics on http : //www.google.com/search ? q=dell+axim+x30 for example .	St
1.4.2	The EMC Navisphere Express is a NAS-device from EMC2 .	St
1.4.3	That 's quite something else and your link is n't applicable to that at all .	St
1.4.4	I assume such a professional device came with a manual and a support contract .	St
1.4.5	So all I can say at the moment : read the manual and call your support company .	St
