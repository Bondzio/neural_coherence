I'd have to use the glossy paper.
I don't use the glossy paper since it's under glass or acrylic.
In closing it does not look like what comes from walmart since its a slightly differenct technology.
But I will not go to said walmart since its great stuff.
If you want exactly what walmart would look like, then you can not use an ink jet.
You'll look at dye sublimation printers.
If that's what you want?
