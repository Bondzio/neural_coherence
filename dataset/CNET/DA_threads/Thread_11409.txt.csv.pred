1.1.1	Hi all.	St
1.1.2	I'm in the market for a new AMD cpu.	St
1.1.3	I've checked out the specs on all AM3 cpus from dual - quad cores.	St
1.1.4	Htpertransport features in some of the models but not all, mostly in the quad core series.	St
1.1.5	Is it worth taking into consideration if the cpu features hypertransport regardless of how many cores it has?	St
1.1.6	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	Just find benchmarks for said CPUs next time.	St
1.2.2	It's almost like we could dwell on other CPU internals like &quot;Cache Line Size&quot; and debate where it should be for optimum cache hits.	St
1.2.3	Just google CPU CHARTS TOMSHARDWARE and you'll be on your way.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Nothing really convinced me that hypertransfer makes a significant difference within the AMD range of cpus but some of my long held suspicions about Intel's excessive pricing for a cpu that, sometimes, AMD can make better and cheaper, are confirmed.	St
1.3.2	I was going to buy the Phenom IIx2 550 AM3 3.1ghz because of its exceelent stats.	St
1.3.3	for the price of 75.	St
1.3.4	Then I got waylaid by the x3 and x4 options.	St
1.3.5	I don't really need more than 2 cores because the prime function of my system is gaming and as of yet PC games haven't utilised the multi-core/multi-threading programming.	St
1.3.6	Anyway after looking at some of the stats.	St
1.3.7	on the webpage you suggested the Phenom IIx2 550 came on top (even over Phenom II x3 and x4) in some tests so I guess I'll stick with my original choice and not consider hypertransport as a 'have to have' feature.	St
