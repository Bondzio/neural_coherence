When I put all the parts back everything worked fine, even the unpredictable internal wifi antenna, but the trackpoint mouse is no longer shown in system devices. The keyboard works fine and the trackpoint is all one piece with the keyboard. I bought a wireless mouse which is recognized and works well. Any suggestions?

These are notoriously difficult to keep working as you disassemble devices. Basically the thin platic film has small bared ends, which go into a very narrow slot (which is the problem). Then a little clip slides in which is supposed to pull it fully home, and into proper contact. It's easy to get it wrong, and even with it looking like it's right, and firmly clipped in, it's not contacting correctly. Or maybe it's just broken? GeeBee.
