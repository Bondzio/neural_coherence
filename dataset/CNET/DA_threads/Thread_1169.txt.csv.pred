1.2.1	Disconnect the hard drive, and try again.	St
1.2.2	You should at least get a BIOS screen.	St
1.2.3	If that's been done, it's time to take it to professional help.	St
1.3.1	something vibrated loose from the move.	St
1.3.2	Take the cover off and make certain everything is plugged in properly.	St
1.4.1	thanks for the repy but have tryed all that and put different leads ect on aswell and still no luck	Polite
1.5.1	Maybe when you moved it, the button got disconnected from the motherboard.	St
1.5.2	You should find the chord (usually connected to the front usb) and follow it to the motherboard.	St
1.5.3	Make sure it is connected.	Res
1.6.1	&quot;&quot;pc wont come on light on the front does but then nothing, have changed the psu aswell and still nothing dont even hear the fan starting &quot;&quot; What light comes on??	St
1.6.2	The Power LED??	St
1.6.3	If so that means that you have 5 volts at least.	St
1.6.4	Are symptoms before changing PSU identical or did some of them change???	St
1.6.5	What fan is it that you don't hear starting??	St
1.6.6	Was the second PSU a new unit of same or higher wattage, or an old one that you had laying around??	St
1.6.7	Do you know how to turn the PSU by itself?	St
1.7.1	try reseating the memory	Sug
1.8.1	yes its the power led, symptoms are the same and yes it was a new psuand same wattage aswell as the old one its 340wts, and no i dont no how to turn the psu by itself, thank you for the reply can you help any further pls	St
1.9.1	yes i have looked at that and all things are conected properly	St
1.10.1	how do i reseating the memory pls	Ques
1.11.1	you said that you tried replugging everything.	St
1.11.2	The memory sticks [or stick] should have been one of the items.	St
1.11.3	The memory sticks are held in by a plastic tab at each end of the stick.	St
1.11.4	One lifts up the tabs which then allows the memory stick to be unplugged.	St
1.11.5	Just remove them and plug them back in FIRMLY and then lock the tabs down again.	Sug
1.11.6	Did you replug the video card in??	St
1.11.7	If you want to test the power supply by itself [probably not needed if you tried two different ones], plug it in to a wall outlet [a hot one LOL] and with the supply connectors not plugged into the computer.	St
1.11.8	On the 20 pin [24 pin on newer computers]connector find the green wire, use a small piece of wire to connect the green wire to any one of the black wires.	St
1.11.9	As long as the connection is made the supply will turn on and stay on as noted by its fan rotating.	St
1.11.10	The Molex connectors are a sloppy fit so with a fine piece of wire one can usually make the connection from the rear of the connector.	St
1.11.11	It is simply a logic connection so there is no voltage that you can feel.	St
1.12.1	i have even done a bench test now and still nothing, my mp3 player charges though when i plug it in to a usb port	St
1.13.1	thanks for replying but we have tryed that aswell and still nothing	Polite
1.14.1	have 5 volts.	St
1.14.2	Does the hard drive rotate?	St
1.14.3	The newer mobos provide power to the CPU via the 12 volt line [at one time they used the 5 volt line].	St
1.14.4	If you have the 5 volts and no fans or anything running you then have no 12 volts, which depending on your computer mobo may mean that the CPU also doesn't get power.	St
1.14.5	For this to happen on two power supplies is hard to understand for me, although in the last month or so in these forums I have seen others with that problem.	St
1.14.6	Wonder if they were all eMachines.	St
1.14.7	Normally if the CPU were shorted and overloaded the supply, all the main voltages would shut down automatically.	St
1.14.8	Possibly your power supply only shuts down the voltage main that is overloaded.	St
1.14.9	I don't think that I can offer much help.	St
1.14.10	At this point AFTER you go back and make certain that you replug everything in, the only thing left is remove/replace trouble shooting.	St
1.14.11	Doesn't sound too good for the CPU.	St
1.14.12	Good luck.	St
1.14.13	You wouldn't be the first in these forums that found the PC suddenly working after rechecking all connections for the third time.	St
1.15.1	no the hard drive dont rotate, im totally lost with it now thanks any way	St
