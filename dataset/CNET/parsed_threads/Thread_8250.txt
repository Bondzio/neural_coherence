<s> Hi To all Mac Gurus My good old Dual Power Mac G4 Sawtooth 1.42 Ghz --- shuts itself down after 10-15 seconds during powering up.... i do hear the chimney though... </s>
<s> Tried to do a PMU reset - nothing helps.. </s>
<s> Totally lost - have no access to my Powermac for a week thanks in advance for any input best regards, Milka Nice, France </s>
<s> Shut down and remove all connections from the Machine. </s>
<s> This includes the KB, mouse and power cord Press the ON button on the front of the machine. </s>
<s> Open the side and remove the battery Press the CUDA button ONCE (It is next to the battery holder, is a little square metal thing with what looks like a tiny pencil eraser in the middle of it) Leave everything for 20 mins. </s>
<s> Put the battery back in (Make sure the polarity is correct) Close the side. </s>
<s> Connect the KB and Mouse Connect the power cord Press the ON button. </s>
<s> Any better? </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> hi, thanks for your reply i've opened the Powermac as the 1st thing ... before posting and didn't removed any battery - just pressed the CUDA button for 5-6 sec. </s>
<s> closed mac connected keyboard ---- nothing helped. </s>
<s> I will try your method , bu pressin' CUDA only once and leavin' the Pomermac for 20 min.... but what battery needs a removal... where is it? </s>
<s> in a holder on the logic board (Motherboard). </s>
<s> The battery is Half AA size, NOT a silver circular battery. </s>
<s> It is usually in a black holder. </s>
<s> Some G4 machines have it on the right hand side of the logic board, as you look at it, open, from the front of the machine. </s>
<s> Others have it roughly in the middle, just in front of the PCI/AGP slots On pressing the CUDA switch. </s>
<s> That's a Press, let go button and not a Press, hold, count to 5 and then let go button. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Hi again, thanks for your tip on removing the AA size battery and pressing CUDA button once--- it did help : the POwer MAc has started up and have been working for couple of days.... i would put it in sleep mode for a night... </s>
<s> But i had i small 1 second power outage in the hood ( happens quite often here in Old Nice) that Power does shuts itself down after the chimney sound on startup .... </s>
<s> I've tried the same AA battery removal + CUDA reset::::: but this time it didn't help?? </s>
<s> what is really happening ... is it the dead AA size battery or something else? </s>
<s> what would be my solution? </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> It's worth replacing it to find out. </s>
<s> Be sure to take it along to the store, probably Radio Shack, when you shop for a replacement. </s>
<s> (Radio Shack does carry them) The other thing you can do, if power outages are the norm in your neck of the woods, is to get yourself a UPS device. </s>
<s> Big enough to run the computer and the monitor for 10/15 minutes or so, so that it will carry you over the smaller power outages and allow you to shut down the machine nicely in the event of a longer outage. </s>
<s> That size are quite cheap. </s>
<s> Computers do not like having their legs cut out from underneath them, too often. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply, but there is unfortunately no Radio Shack in where i live ( France) so i gotto find some sort of compatible battery .... is it a rechargable battery and what exactly it does that its so important to the Powermac G4? </s>
<s> is that the battery that keeps the settings ( day, time , etc)in the memory till the next startup...or? </s>
<s> Why does computer shuts itself at the startup process...how can this battery influence that? </s>
<s> milka </s>
<s> in a state ready to boot. </s>
<s> When you removed the battery, pressed the power button and left it for a while, all the residual power in the board went away so that the system had to reload a fresh copy of the firmware. </s>
<s> This resulted in a successful startup. </s>
<s> You are correct, the battery keeps things like date/time/etc going by supplying power to those items on the board that have volatile memory. </s>
<s> A low battery can cause things to not be correct and can cause all sorts of weird problems. </s>
<s> The battery is a 3.6v lithium (NOT rechargeable) and is Half AA size. </s>
<s> I'm sure that there is some place in France that sells them, either in a store or on-line. </s>
<s> Google is your friend. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> I, don't know anything when comes to using a mac. </s>
<s> I pick up a G4 500 SERVER SAWTOOTH it's got a 1G of ram and I HAVE ASKED a few if I, could upgrade to a dual 1.42 and I ; was told no, I, couldn'T What can you tell me about this? </s>
<s> Thanks MZ ... </s>
<s> make a new thread with your problem which has nothing to do with the current problem being dealt with in this thread. </s>
<s> Yes, you an upgrade to a Dual 1.42 P </s>
<s> Hi again - its been a while i haven't posted anything... ( even though i use MacBook Pro 2010 lately - i just refuse to give up on my good old Power Mac ) News Update: My Power Mac G4 ( Sawtooth FireWire800) won't even give a &quot;sparkle&quot; of ignition now when pressing the power button - the button it doesn't even light up anymore.... does it mean that the Power Mac is dead ( refuse to believe that) or does this mean that the famous AA 3.6v lithium battery is completely dead? </s>
<s> pressing CUDA and removing the battery doesn't help any longer.... what should i try now? </s>
<s> thanks in advance for your great help </s>
<s> Replace if necessary. </s>
<s> Anything below 3 is not good P </s>
<s> thanks for your prompt reply cannot measure the voltage ... got no tools but my guess its dead.. so if i find a replacement would it bring my Power Mac back to life.... hopefully? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Just bought new battery , installed it when i push power button it light up for split second and than nothing happes, trying to push it again --- no light sparkle ...:( what else could it be? </s>
<s> CUDA reset dousn't help , Just bought new battery , installed it when i push power button - the button blinks light for a split second and than nothing happes, trying to push it again --- no light sparkle ...:( what else could it be? </s>
<s> Logicboard failure Power supply failure did you press the CUDA button after taking out the old battery and before installing the new one? </s>
<s> Go back to my first post and repeat the steps it contains p </s>
<s> i have followed your instructions again: pushed power button once, removed new battery, pressed PMU buttoon once shortly waited 20 min power Mac powered up for 30 sec... than shut itself off before screen even lighted up.... now if i press power button it shws light but Mac doesn't powers up. </s>
<s> What made it behave so strange, what else could i test , reset or try? </s>
<s> and use the G4 as an anchor. </s>
<s> You obviously have some sort of hardware failure going on there. </s>
<s> Make sure that everything is disconnected, not the keyboard and mouse, remove all but one stick of RAM and go again. </s>
<s> I think you are flogging a dead horse P </s>
<s> well , the srtartup probs started after few power outages in the ancient downtown of Nice ( where i am located) in the past i ould always &quot;reanimate&quot; Power Mac G4 by PMU reset but than it wouldnt go beyond +- sec starting up and subsequent shut down.... i usually disconnect power cable and monitor when doing the these recovery tests.... do you mean it could be a dead RAM? </s>
<s> that's why i need to remove the RAM chip? </s>
<s> as I already mentioned, we are just grasping at straws right now. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Good news : After doing exactly what you've suggested i removed one memory chip from the two, removed battery pressed CUDA one long press waited few hours, and now i am typing this on my POwer Mac! </s>
<s> but, i am afraid to put it to sleep mode or shutdown cause last time it could never come back from sleep .... What do you thing was wrong with it , bad memory chip or? </s>
<s> the removed memory chip is made by Infineon if it makes any difference? </s>
<s> How could i diagnose/repair my Mac further .... what tools , steps to undertake to ensure that its won't have any startup probs anymore? </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> at leas i am so happy its not completely dead </s>
<s> the start up after removing the RAM stick may have been coincidental. </s>
<s> If you wanted to push your luck, you could restart with the stick out, and if that works, shut down and add the stick back. </s>
<s> If it fails to boot then the stick may well be bad. </s>
<s> However, maybe it would be better if you just left the thing running, no sleep and no shutdown. </s>
<s> Your call. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> after checking my HD with Disk Utility i got message that volume needs minor repair.... </s>
<s> from the OS X installation disk or the Restore Disks and run Disk Utility from there. </s>
<s> Disk Utility cannot repair the disk that the computer is booted from P </s>
<s> Good News: just dared to restart the computer, all was fine. </s>
<s> than i've reinstalled the RAM chip back and started fine aswell so the memory is fine. </s>
<s> what was the matter with my Power Mac shutting itself off all those months than, the old battery or...? </s>
<s> thanks again for all your great insight and help </s>
<s> tiptoe away from the machine and not try to second guess it any longer. </s>
<s> Battery could have been the cause while RAM is still a suspect. </s>
<s> Sometimes reseating a card or memory module is enough to make sure that all the contacts are connecting well and solves the problem. </s>
<s> Enjoy the G4 P </s>
<s> thanks you, just another observation: when i try to put G 4 into slip mode it just shuts itself off. </s>
<s> than i have to restart it by pressing the power button on the LCD monitor....? </s>
<s> the sleep mode used to work.. </s>
<s> not so much on the first. </s>
<s> Don't know what to tell you here. </s>
