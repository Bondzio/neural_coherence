In principle, it is possible, although you may find it hard to find such a device in the market, for the obvious reason - Bluetooth is only good for about 10 meters. Mobile phones with bluetooth connectivity can transfer images. A singapore firm manufactures a small blutooth camera known as &quot;OptiEyes&quot;. You 'll have to search. Easier would be to get a pair of 2.4 Ghz transmitter and receiver. Find a receiver with USB connectivity, and you have it.
