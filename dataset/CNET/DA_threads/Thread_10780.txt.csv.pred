1.1.1	I am considering building a new computer for the first time .	St
1.1.2	I have begun doing some research into it and would like to know : 1 . )	St
1.1.3	A good estimate of what building a moderate ( 2.0 ghz+ , 40 gb , 512 RAM , etc.. ) computer WITHOUT including the cost of the monitor .	St
1.1.4	2 . )	St
1.1.5	I would also like to know more about the AMD Sempron compared to Athlon XP .	St
1.1.6	Which one is the better choice ?	Ques
1.1.7	Compared to Intel , are the AMD chips a better deal for building moderate level computers ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thank You for your help !	St
1.2.1	The AMD chips take a little more care in the heatsink and power supply area .	St
1.2.2	Some first time builders power up the machine without the heatsink and fry the CPU .	St
1.2.3	They take as much time to build as other machines .	St
1.2.4	So the cost is similar .	St
1.2.5	If you were looking for prices , they vary by country and more .	St
1.2.6	You should try newegg or such if in the US .	Sug
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	But how do they match up ?	Ques
1.3.2	which is better ?	Ques
1.3.3	AMD Sempron ?	Ques
1.3.4	XP 64 ?	Ques
1.3.5	P4HT ?	Ques
1.4.1	I do n't compare CPUs .	St
1.4.2	You do that at the usual websites like http : //www.tomshardware.com But that 's a fool 's errand .	St
1.4.3	Here 's why .	St
1.4.4	Selecting the & quot ; best & quot ; CPU and not understanding that hard disk and video can be a drag chute on the CPU 's performance is always fun for me to watch .	St
1.4.5	I 've seem people fret over the CPU but miss their performance mark by putting in a substandard or recyclying their old video card .	St
1.4.6	If I was to build a new machine today , I would start with the 64-bit capable CPU for a simple reason that I 'd want that for the video work and Suse Linux .	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	I bought an athlon 64 3500 and i love it !	St
1.5.2	If your into games than this Cpu is right down your lane .	St
1.5.3	When bundled with the right Video card and enough ram you will have a killer RIG .	St
1.5.4	www.pricewatch.com Great site , get pretty much anything from here	St
1.6.1	Yeah I see , or NOT !	St
1.6.2	Okay so you 're running a 64bit processor there but not using 64 bits - hmmmm really efficient .	St
1.6.3	The reason I know that you are n't using it is because - Windows XP is n't 64 bit !	St
1.6.4	Only now is Microsoft offering beta testing of Windows XP Pro 64 bit .	St
1.6.5	And all the software available is 32 bit - all of them have to be recompiled for 64 bit when it comes out .	St
1.6.6	Are you going to need 64 bit power ?	Ques
1.6.7	Not really - nor is it neccessary .	St
1.6.8	The majority of the power users will do just fine with the increased speed of a faster cpu and efficient running subsystems .	St
1.6.9	Just a thought !	St
1.7.1	You would n't write that if you used one .	Polite
1.7.2	In closing video editing is much better on these systems .	St
1.7.3	Have you tried it ?	Ques
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	LOL Have your run Linux or windows XP 64bit ?	Ques
1.8.2	Oh wait I do	Sug
1.9.1	go to pricewatch.com you can find AWESOME prices for parts	Sug
