1.1.1	I decided I ca n't go on any longer without a portable HDD for video editing ( ca n't upgrade my laptop for another 7 months thanks to Applecare 's restrictions ) .	St
1.1.2	So I scoured the web for a 7200rpm+FW800 option and boiled it down to either getting the Seagate 2.5 500GB 7200rpm HDD with OWC FW800 enclosure ( ~200 $ ) versus the Seagate Freeagent Go Pro of the same specs ( 190 $ ) .	St
1.1.3	I also know that Lacie has the rugged option but it is 320GB and more expensive than the Seagate for less space .	St
1.1.4	Nevertheless , I ca n't decide between the two .	St
1.1.5	On the Seagate hand , I 'll have a 5 year warranty versus 3 years for the Seagate drive and 1 year for the enclosure .	St
1.1.6	On the OWC side , I can always switch out the drive without voiding any warranties since I put it together myself .	St
1.1.7	What do you guys think .	St
1.1.8	I think I 'm leaning towards Seagate 's warranty but want to hear some wisdom before swiping the card and a good chunk of my pay check .	St
1.2.1	Why I ask is that all these drives eventually suffer the same fate and sooner than most internal drives .	St
1.2.2	Besides the drive , what backup copy is needed ?	Ques
1.3.1	I have n't heard that these drives have a shorter lifespan .	St
1.3.2	Is there an article you can point to ?	Ques
1.3.3	Why do they have a shorter life than most internal drives ?	Ques
1.3.4	Please fill me in on more details .	Sug
1.4.1	all the more reason to get the Seagate with 5 yr warranty , eh ?	Ques
1.5.1	You can read this forum and many others to learn this .	St
1.5.2	Of course you could learn it on your own .	St
1.5.3	After decades in and around computers of all shapes and sizes this is what I 've learned .	St
1.5.4	& quot ; Backup is learned rather than taught. & quot ; While we can teach , write about backup each new user appears to question the need for backup until they suffer loss .	St
1.5.5	Then they no longer need to be told or taught .	St
1.5.6	Sorry about that but it can upset some when you write it harshly .	St
1.5.7	Bob	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	So I backup everything I have on the portable HDD , I still need a portable HDD for the work that I do .	St
1.7.2	You say that the drives I mention have a shorter life , then I ask which drives have the longer life ?	Ques
1.7.3	Is this a portable vs. desktop issue , a 7200 rpm issue ?	Ques
1.7.4	I do video editing on the go and need a solution for carrying around files larger than my laptop can hold .	St
1.7.5	It sounds like it does n't matter what drive I get as long as I back it up .	St
1.7.6	Is that correct ?	Ques
1.8.1	I 've seen all makes and models show up in need of recovery .	St
1.8.2	I ca n't say that any maker has one that is better than all the rest .	St
1.8.3	Bob	St
1.9.1	So I 'm just going to put together a 500GB solution that is 7200 rpm for video editing , and make sure to back it up .	St
1.9.2	Thanks for the advice .	St
1.10.1	NIL	St
