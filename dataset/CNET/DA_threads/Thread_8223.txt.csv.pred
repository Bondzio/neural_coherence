1.1.1	My PC : HP Pavilion Media Center m7750n Athlon 64 X2 ( W ) 5000+ 2.6 GHz 4 GB DDR2 ram 400 GB SATA 7200rpm HD Running Vista I purchased a HP 1TB Personal Media Drive to use in the removable drive bay about 1 month ago .	St
1.1.2	Well the drive is loud and rather annoying to say the least .	St
1.1.3	I have one free internal 3.5 & quot ; bay available .	St
1.1.4	Is there any preference ( internal or external ) with regards to speed , noise and performance if I wanted to replace the noisy drive ?	Ques
1.1.5	My use for the drive would be to store all my media and the drive would be used frequently as I stream my media to my PS3 .	St
1.1.6	Any good brands to use ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks in advance	St
1.2.1	See http : //reviews.cnet.com/external-hard-drives/hp-media-vault-mv2010/4505-3190_7-32104818.html HP 's link at http : //www.hp.com/united-states/campaigns/mediasmart-server/	St
1.3.1	so I would be more inclined to purchase a HD .	St
1.4.1	Seems like you are done ?	Ques
1.5.1	I was hoping to get some feedback on whether or not there was any preferrence to an internal or an external hd with regards to speed , noise , etc .	St
1.5.2	I was also looking for help in picking a hd brand .	St
1.5.3	Thanks .	Polite
1.6.1	You are now asking the Ford or Chevy , which is better question .	St
1.6.2	You can find 1,000+ long posts on that so let 's not do that again .	St
1.6.3	Given we can control the noise and speed can be the same in or out with SATA that 's a tossup too .	St
1.6.4	Why not get what you like ?	Ques
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	Thanks anyways .	Polite
1.8.1	Internal disk is faster than external , and apparently they are more reliable ( few posts about failing internal disks in our Storage forum , hundreds of posts about failing external ones ) .	St
1.8.2	For sound level : why not try ?	Ques
1.8.3	Get the disk out , put in your PC and compare .	St
1.8.4	As you already have bought a hard disk , why ask about a brand for another one ?	Ques
1.8.5	Do you happen to know what brand HP put into their case ?	Ques
1.8.6	I do n't think they make their own .	St
1.8.7	Well , I know .	St
1.8.8	You need a second and third hard disk to backup your first .	St
1.8.9	That 's a smart idea !	St
1.8.10	Many of our members do n't backup and lose everything on their external .	St
1.8.11	Kees	St
1.9.1	To have you think about the question .	St
1.9.2	Given the Ford vs. Chevy nature of the products , how would we choose ?	Ques
1.9.3	I still like internals for the very simple reason they last longer because : a .	St
1.9.4	It 's more protected .	St
1.9.5	b .	St
1.9.6	People tend to not drop a PC tower .	St
1.9.7	c. They turn it off to move it .	St
1.9.8	d. All of the above .	St
1.9.9	c. All of the above and more .	St
1.9.10	e. None of the above .	St
1.9.11	I hope you see the Chevy vs. Ford issue here .	St
1.9.12	Bob	St
1.10.1	That is my impression as to one the purposes that message boards serve .	St
1.10.2	I might just go get a Toyota then .	Sug
