Windows 7 64-bit HP Desktop 3 GB Ram 290 GB Hard Drive Hello, I'm looking to purchase an internal hard drive for backup purposes only.
Somebody mentioned that it was cheaper to buy a used internal hard drive, adapt an external enclosure, and use it as an external hard drive.
Taking that into consideration, I would only assume that IDE drives are going for a lot cheaper than SATA drives due to age, speed, and technology right?.
Just how big is the difference between IDE, SATA, 7200 rpm, 5400 rpm, for backup purposes only.
