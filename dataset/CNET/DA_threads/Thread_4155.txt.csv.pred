1.1.1	For no apparent reason , after my 1150 has been on for awhile , the power source changes from AC to battery with no warning .	St
1.1.2	The laptop is not being moved or jostled at all when this happens .	St
1.1.3	Can anyone give me a clue as to why this is happening and what I can do about it ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thank you !	St
1.2.1	Even moderate bumps or pulls on the power connection can cause cracks or failures there .	St
1.2.2	It does not matter that you did n't move the connection or laptop since failures run the map and we ca n't see the parts involved .	St
1.2.3	If it 's the usual , a good technician can reflow the solder and maybe clear up the problem .	St
1.2.4	In closing , the number of laptops I see transported with the power cord connected makes me think that this problem is widespread .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
