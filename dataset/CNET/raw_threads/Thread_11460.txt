I've hooked both hard drives up inside my computer and loaded the new one with Windows XP. I wan't to transfer all the data, programs, files and settings, from the old hard drive to the new one. I'm not completely computer illeterate but this is the first time I'm trying something like this and would like to know the easiest way to accomplish it. I used the Windows backup utility to make a backup of all the old HD's data to the new hard drive's desktop but I&quot;m sure if that does any good.
