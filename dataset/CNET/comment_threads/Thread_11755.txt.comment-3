SOLUTION: A cross-over cable solved my firewall (WAN port) to CISCO LAN port connection problem.
The rule is simple: Since a firewall and a router are &quot;like devices&quot; they require a cross-over cable to talk to each other.
A switch and a router, or a switch and a firewall are not alike and therefore can utilize a straight through cable.
BONUS TIP (albeit somewhat unrelated to the solution to this thread): You'll need a &quot;rolled cable&quot; if you want to communicate with a console on many CISCO routers.
A rolled cable has ends that are exact opposites (reversed) at each end.
