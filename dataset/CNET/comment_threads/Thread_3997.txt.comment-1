Every time I start up my computer I get &quot;Checking NVRAM&quot;.
What is that?
I'm not sure when it starting but it takes about 40 seconds to complete and then my computer starts fine.
Boot time is longer now and I can't remember when this started or what I installed when it did start.
If I restart my computer at any time it does not do this check.
If I hit escape when starting up it stops the &quot;checking nvram&quot; but am I doing some time of damage when I escape this check?
I can't find anything in my bios set up to by-pass this check.
In other words I have by-passed checking the A drive in boot up but cannot find anything about this NVRAM thing.
