1.1.2	I believe the problem may be with the USB ports , but I have tried everything I can think of to fix it .	St
1.1.3	The only other option I have left is to buy a powered USB hub .	St

1.1.5	I am using a Dell Inspiron 8600 and Windows XP .	St
1.1.6	The USB ports are 2.0 .	St
1.2.1	come with any software or drivers ?	Ques
1.3.1	Yes .	St
1.3.2	I installed everything that was on the cd .	St
1.3.3	I have been thinking that the USB ports are underpowered , but I have changed some of their settings and still can not get the device recognized .	St
1.4.1	I do n't know if you are still having this problem , b/c your post is old , but I had the same problem with my Creative Zen Micro .	St
1.4.2	I do n't think it is your USB ports - I had the problem on my Dell and then on my Toshieba Tecra - where I plug in my device but the Zen software does not see it - but Napster sees it .	St
1.4.3	With some ( or perhaps all and I never noticed ) USB drivers , you have to use the same port that you used when you installed the device .	St
1.4.4	But I think your problem is just a Creative problem .	St
