I am using AT&T 3mbps DSL service. My current modem is a Motorola 2210-02 DSL Modem. It is okay, but i just might have gotten a good one cause a lot of people had trouble with theirs. The tech at AT&T suggested a Netgear 7550. It has gotten some poor reviews. I would just like the correct modem that works well and lasts a while.

The most important thing is that it is able to work with AT&T. Kees
