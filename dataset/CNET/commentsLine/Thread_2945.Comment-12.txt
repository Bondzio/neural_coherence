if you tend to download and uninstall a number of programs, apps, and games, uninstall does not clean out everything.
example: if you have yahoo messenger installed and then 'uninstall&quot; it the right way, and then check in the registry, you will find the entire installation still sitting there, right down to the executable bits.
the only way to remove them without a registry cleaner is one at a time, hundreds and hundreds of bits.
every time you download anything on your computer, when you delete it, it leaves a fingerprint behind in the registry.
a cleaner will go after those fingerprints, cleaning out all the loose flappy things that don't belong to anything anymore; dll files, missing files, bits of games and apps you thought you had deleted years ago.
they dont do any harm, perhaps, but over time they build up.
when i installed registryfix, i had about 200 of those things in the registry.
now i get maybe two or three a week, and can manage them nicely.
