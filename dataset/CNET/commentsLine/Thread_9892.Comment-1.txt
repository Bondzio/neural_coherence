i recently put together a computer that has a blank harddrive.
i bought windows xp (bootable) to use as an operating system.
when i turn the pc on it says that there is no harddrive.
when i put in my old (2gb) harddrive it uses it right away but not the new harddrive.
ive tried everything.
it works, i know that much.
any thoughts?
