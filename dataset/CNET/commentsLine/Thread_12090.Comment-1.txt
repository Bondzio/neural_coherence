hey guys, i need help deciding on a new video card for my computer.
i have a p4 2.8 gh, 1 gb ram, and a fx 5700 le 128mb video card.
i might need to upgrade my power supply to accomidate the new card.
i do not know the wattage rating of it.
i have a agp slot.
my current choices are: a diablotek geforce 6600 le/256mb ddr for $95 from tiger direct, a diamond radeon x1300 / 512mb ddr2 for $130 also from tiger direct, and these newegg cards: an apollo 6800 geforce 6800 128mb 256-bit ddr for $130, an asus 512mb geforce 6800 128-bit gddr2 for $180, a bfg tech geforce 6800gs 256mb 256-bit gddr3 for $200, a diamond radeon x1300 512mb 128-bit gddr2 for $114, a evga geforce 6600 256mb 128-bit ddr for $100, evga geforce 7800gs co 256mb 256-bit gddr3 for $270, and a pny geforce 6600 256mb 128-bit ddr for $112.
i would prefer to stay below $200, around $150ish.
i want to be able to play oblivion at decent settings on a 17&quot; moniter, and some other games like it.
any other video cards that i have not listed here that you recomend would be fine as well.
thanks!
