the computer that i use at my home won't start intitially when i switch it on.
The led lights are there bt no display in my monitor.
However, if i keep the computer on like this (i.e.
with no display) and restart it again after like 5 mins then it would go till the windows xp logo n than crash again....and if i reboot it (by pressing reset ofcourse) after another 5 mins later i would finally hav the desktop and only than can i work.
Plz help!!!!!!
