<s> This has happened twice already. </s>
<s> I managed to get the storage drive back when I did a system restore. </s>
<s> Now it's down again and the computer doesn't detect the drive at all. </s>
<s> I was using my Easy CD Creator file to create a data disk when it shut down both times. </s>
<s> I think that file has been corrupted. </s>
<s> I can't even get the disk out of the drive now. </s>
<s> Roxio is notorious for this issue. </s>
<s> Try... 1. </s>
<s> Deleting the Upperfilters and Lowerfilters you find in articles about this and Roxio from the registry that you search about such on google.com 2. </s>
<s> The eject bug was cured in a Roxio update but many forget about that. </s>
<s> My workaround was never to use DirectCD. </s>
<s> Ever. </s>

<s> You're going to need to be more specific on this. </s>
<s> I did a google search on Roxio. </s>
<s> And all it showed me was a free copy of their 7.5 version. </s>
<s> Am I to download something on to my computer or look for an update to the program I've already got on it? </s>
<s> Step by step would be awesome! </s>
<s> My system is an Adaptec Easy CD Creator 4 </s>
<s> http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=314060 The eject issue is WELL KNOWN with that version. </s>
<s> Cured in an update, if you didn't get the update you may have missed the opportunity. </s>
<s> I can not find it either. </s>
<s> Workaround? </s>
<s> Don't install DIRECTCD. </s>
<s> In fact, why bother with this old software when CDBURNERXP (works on 98/ME/NT/2000/XP) is free and does 99% of what I use a CDRW drive for. </s>

<s> I do a search for Regedt32.exe and my computer isn't picking it up. </s>
<s> I run a Windows ME system. </s>
<s> I found it now but there is no file that comes close to a 4D36e The closest I've found is : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceClasses\{4d1e55b2-f16f-11cf-88cb-001111000030} and then it has a bunch of other subfiles underneath it. </s>
<s> I'm getting closer. </s>
<s> I can feel it! </s>
<s> Thanks for your patience by the way. </s>
<s> My mistake for not requiring the OS. </s>
<s> In your case, you must check the BIOS noted the drives plus you installed the motherboard driver package. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
<s> How do I go about doing all of that? </s>
<s> 1.) </s>
<s> Check the Bios 2.) </s>
<s> Install the motherboard package </s>
<s> You didn't follow the forum note which writes: Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. </s>
<s> As such, I can only offer what I would do, but nothing specific. </s>
