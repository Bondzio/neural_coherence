hi!
m having problem solving whether the geforce graphic card would work on my pc or not.... the make of my pc motherboard is asus- p5p800-vm....512ram,80gb hard disk,d pc does also have agp slot.
(pentium D-dual core) and the make of the graphic card goes as Geforce 7600 GS 512mb ddr2 128 bit agp 8x im confused & need recommendation if this particular hardware is appropriate...also interested to know if a pci-e graphic card would be installed on the motherboard or not.
feedback would be much appreciated!!
