Hey guys, gotta question for you.
I built my first desktop yesterday.
Everything seems to be going well except... sometimes when I turn the system on, the motherboard screen comes up with the fancy picture that says &quot;asus m2n4-sli&quot; and says press delete to enter setup.. so I leave it to continue booting, and sometimes at that screen the system resets and trys to boot again.. sometimes the 2nd boot is successfull, other times it gets caught in a loop where it keeps resetting.
This doesnt happen all the time tho, maybe once every 10 times i try to start the system.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
