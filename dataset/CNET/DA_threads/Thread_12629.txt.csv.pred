1.1.1	Hello , I am looking for a storage solution which can work as an USB & a network storage at the same time .	St
1.1.2	It can be a ready-to-use NAS with USB or an enclosure for IDE or/and SATA HDD which support USB & Ethernet at the same time .	St
1.1.3	The devices I did see can support network or USB but not both at the same time or does not have a reasonable price for a home user .	St
1.1.4	I need something reliable but the speed is not very important .	St
1.1.5	1 MB/sec is enough for me .	St
1.1.6	As I know an internal 500GB hard-drive is below $ 150 now so I would like to have a complete solution for $ 200 .	St
1.1.7	Can abybody advise me anything ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thank you .	St
1.1.9	V .	St
1.2.1	is a home built PC running XP Home connected to my home network .	St
1.2.2	It has 6 USB ports and is available on my LAN .	St
1.2.3	It 's also my web server running my web site .	St
1.2.4	Nothing fancy , just a good home built .	St
1.2.5	Since I do not need a lot of storage I only have a 60 Gig master drive and an 80 Gig & quot ; storage & quot ; drive .	St
1.2.6	You can spend a gazillion dollars on a dedicated server , or you can build your own for a few hundred .	St
1.2.7	Wayne There are 10 types of people who understand binary ; those that do and those that do n't .	St
1.2.8	Click here to see the CNet faces , learn a little about analog and digital data , internet connections , spyware removal , and download free software .	St
1.3.1	I have 3 home built PCs .	St
1.3.2	This is just because I got rid of 2 more recently .	St
1.3.3	The storage I need is supposed to be connected to my home theater since I have a DVD player with USB .	St
1.3.4	And I would like the storage to be available on the LAN at the same time .	St
1.4.1	I take it that you are not open to discuss options ?	Ques
1.4.2	If so I do n't think I 'll comment what I use .	St
1.4.3	You might flame me .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	I am open to discuss options and I think I described what I need in details .	St
1.5.2	Thanks .	Polite
1.6.1	Should be all that is needed .	St
1.6.2	Use one of your PCs , install a large HD , and enable F & PS .	St
1.6.3	Connect the DVD player to a USB port .	St
1.6.4	Use F & PS and a router .	St
1.6.5	Complete your home LAN .	St
1.7.1	What is F & PS ?	Ques
1.8.1	I still do n't understand how that can be an option .	St
1.8.2	Probably I am missing something but how can I configure a computer with a shared drive to work as a USB-drive ?	Ques
1.8.3	DVD player has an & quot ; A & quot ; USB socket and works fine with flash drive and USB-HDD formatted with fat32 .	St
1.8.4	I have A-USB on the computer wich is not close to the playre BTW .	St
1.8.5	But if it was how can it be recognized as a USB-drive ?	Ques
1.9.1	NIL	St
1.10.1	That 's all you need to add to complete the brew and create the solution .	St
1.10.2	Bob	St
1.11.1	If you mean something like that http : //www.usb-ware.com/usb-2-usb-data-link-file-transfer-cable-uc250.htm It can be used for data transfering between 2 computers .	St
1.11.2	But it does not convert a PC to an external USB storage .	St
1.11.3	Also to make it work special software must be installed on both computers .	St
1.11.4	That software creates something like network bridge via USB .	St
1.11.5	Unfortunately I can not install software on the DVD-player .	St
1.11.6	.	St
1.11.7	The thing which could help me would be a device connected to the LAN and emulating a USB-drive .	St
1.11.8	But I do n't know is something like that available .	St
1.11.9	At least I 've never heard about that .	St
1.11.10	That 's why I think a USB-drive with LAN interface is an easiest solution .	St
1.11.11	But as I told I can not find one working with 2 interfaces simultaneously .	St
1.12.1	Now that 's new in your spec .	St
1.12.2	So without a clear spec I do n't see anyone that will guess what you are trying to do .	St
1.12.3	We were close .	St
1.12.4	- & gt ; Bottomline .	St
1.12.5	Go to the store , go to newegg.com and see if what you want is made .	St
1.12.6	Yes ?	Ques
1.12.7	Buy it .	St
1.12.8	No .	St
1.12.9	Make it .	St
1.12.10	Bob	St
1.13.1	I did read specs for multiple USB-drives and enclosures on newegg.com , buy.com , pricegrabber , etc. , visited some manufacturers ' sites .	St
1.13.2	But still no luck ... . And now I am here hoping anybody can help me .	St
1.14.1	But a new spec emerged and the solution is no more .	St
1.14.2	I think a new complete spec is needed .	St
1.14.3	Bob	St
1.15.1	DVD-player is Philips DVP-5960 http : //www.consumer.philips.com/consumer/catalog/catalog.jsp ? fhquery=fh_secondid=dvp5960_37_us_consumer & fh_secondid=DVP5960_37_US_CONSUMER & fh_location=//consumer/en_US/categories & lt ; home_audio_video_gr_us_consumer/categories & lt ; dvd_players_recorders_ca_us_consumer/categories & lt ; dvd_players_su_us_consumer & & productId=DVP5960_37_US_CONSUMER & activeCategory=HOME_AUDIO_VIDEO_GR_US_CONSUMER & fredhopperpage=detail.jsp & language=en & country=US & catalogType=CONSUMER & proxybuster=http : //www.consumer.philips.com/consumer/catalog/catalog.jsp ? fhquery=fh_secondid=dvp5960_37_us_consumer & fh_secondid=DVP5960_37_US_CONSUMER & fh_location=//consumer/en_US/categories & lt ; home_audio_video_gr_us_consumer/categories & lt ; dvd_players_recorders_ca_us_consumer/categories & lt ; dvd_players_su_us_consumer & & productId=DVP5960_37_US_CONSUMER & activeCategory=HOME_AUDIO_VIDEO_GR_US_CONSUMER & fredhopperpage=detail.jsp & language=en & country=US & catalogType=CONSUMER & proxybuster=AQYYATR1P2KN1J0RMRCSHQNHKFSESI5P It has a USB port and can read data from any standard USB drive formatted with fat32 including flash drives , mp3-player and usb hard drives .	St
1.15.2	BTW I tried NTFS-formatted drive and it 's not working with the player .	St
1.15.3	Next to the player I have a router with WiFi & Ethernet .	St
1.15.4	And I have a LAN with XP , Win2003 & Linux .	St
1.15.5	Linux box is gon na be the closest to the player .	St
1.16.1	Here is a link : http : //www.pricegrabber.com/search_techspecs_full.php/masterid=19958029 Click on & quot ; Manufacturer Link & quot ; at th bottom of the page .	St
1.17.1	I think I see where you are going here .	St
1.17.2	I wanted a player that could fetch from some other place so I could have a digital jukebox .	St
1.17.3	My first solution was the Dlink Media Lounge .	St
1.17.4	It almost worked .	St
1.17.5	It 's downfall was Dlink never revealing how to properly encode video for this box .	St
1.17.6	Next I used a full blown PC and http : //www.mythtv.org/mythimages/menuiulius.png At the time MythTV was still getting fixed up .	St
1.17.7	I may try it again but any day now the Apple TV will ship .	St
1.17.8	So this is what I 'm considering next ( Apple TV ) and since I already have nice Wifi NAS units like the DSM-G600 we 'll see how it all gets along together .	St
1.17.9	Happy hunting for your solution .	St
1.17.10	Bob	St
1.18.1	http : //www.pc4usa.com/detailProducts.asp ? Catn=7 % 20 & Scatn=9 & parCat= What I would like to know is the device I am looking for exist or I am spending time in vain ?	Ques
1.19.1	As the Dlink .	St
1.19.2	They never revealed what encoding would make it work properly .	St
1.19.3	The Dlink ALMOST worked .	St
1.19.4	But even at my best guesses somewhere 10 minutes into the playback the video would stall , audio would keep going and at 11 minutes the video would pick up again .	St
1.19.5	I never found a good demo file to show it working .	St
1.19.6	It sits back in it 's box in case I ever find the answers in either firmware updates or another encoding .	St
1.19.7	- & gt ; There will be another reply to the top question explaining a technical reason why you ca n't connect the ethernet NAS and the USB port at the same time .	St
1.19.8	Bob	St
1.20.1	After a few days it finally occurred to me that I 've been here before .	St
1.20.2	Another fellow tinkerer found a box that claimed you could run the USB to 2 machines to share the hard disk .	St
1.20.3	What they did n't reveal is that only a modified version of Linux could be used .	St
1.20.4	Until you read the instructions .	St
1.20.5	- & gt ; Here 's the bottom line .	St
1.20.6	No USB host to said drive ever expects the hard disk directory contents to be changed underneath it .	St
1.20.7	The file allocation system when Windows connects to the drive is expected ( by Microsoft and just about any other OS ) to be under the sole control of the machine that connected to it .	St
1.20.8	When one machine writes to the drive , the next machine has not a clue that the allocation table is now invalid and it writes to clusters it knows are free promptly trashing contents on the drive .	St
1.20.9	So there you have it .	St
1.20.10	Why your product does n't exist and never will .	St
1.20.11	Sorry I did n't remember this earlier .	St
1.20.12	Bob	St
1.21.1	As for me I do n't care of file allocation table since player is gon na have read-only access .	St
1.22.1	Even if some USB port was marked & quot ; read only & quot ; the host would still fail as the machine altering the drive could and will rewrite the directory contents .	St
1.22.2	At first this does n't sound too bad until you discover that directory entries can change cluster locations too .	St
1.22.3	I 'd rather not describe every scenario here but after a few you discover & quot ; this will never work & quot ; and therefore no product will ever be found to do this .	St
1.22.4	But we still found a solution to your first post but not with the product you noted later .	St
1.22.5	Bob	St
