<s> Hi, I have a desktop pc with a maxtor SATA which holds my OS etc. </s>
<s> I have an old hard drive with some important video's on that a need to transfer onto my pc. </s>
<s> It's an IDE. </s>
<s> I have connected it to the IDE cable that currently runs my DVD rom, I have also plugged the power cable in. </s>
<s> Here's the problem, it doesn't show up in the BIOS. </s>
<s> I have tried setting the jumper to Primary & Slave but still no luck.. still the BIOS shows the DVDR as primary IDE and when I enter secondary IDE there's nothing there. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> J </s>
<s> But let me share a tool I carry in my bag -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=2020-OTB&cat=CBL </s>
<s> that's sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet! </s>
<s> i may have to purchase one! </s>
<s> The model without the OTB feature. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> It may knock off 2 bucks from the cost. </s>
<s> But this device is all I've ever needed for almost any drive that has been used in PCs for the past ten years. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ..thanks matey, i'll have a look on eBay because i'm in the UK so a US site won't work. </s>
<s> Hopefully this will solve everything. </s>
<s> thanks again matey! </s>
