So they always have thier on domain to log in into the network. So my problem is everytime when i at site offices, i have to manually change the domain at &quot;My Computer&quot; setting. Would like to know if there is any ways to add the domain that I would use in to login screen so that i only have to choose which domain to login... Thanks
