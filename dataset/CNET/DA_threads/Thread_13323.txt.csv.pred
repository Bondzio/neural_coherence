1.1.1	i have an old motherboard its has three traditional pci slots i have ordered a 8400gs( my budget aint high) it does not have any pci x16 slots, but through videos and other images i got to see that the card goes in x16 slot.	St
1.1.2	wat shud i do, can i put the card in the pci slots that have been provided or i wud have to buy a new motherboard	Ques
1.2.1	Sorry, but PCI-E x16 doesn't fit in a pci-slot.	St
1.2.2	So you need to buy either another video card (the 8400 is cheap because it isn't so good) or another motherboard.	St
1.2.3	Kees	St
1.3.1	I'm not sure of your skill...but you should have a brown 3&quot; slot next to the PCI slots.That's a respectable card in AGP form(im on a 7600GS 512,lol),but if you have the PCI-X model,DEFINITELY get a new board.PC hardware is getting REAL cheap.	St
1.3.2	You can get a decent board for 50 bucks or less...problem is,you'll need new RAM (cheapest is $50 for 4 gigs),and a new CPU,...at least.	St
