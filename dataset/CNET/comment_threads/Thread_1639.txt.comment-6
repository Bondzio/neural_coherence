Ok..
I like that idea.
What is the best way to accomplish a periodic backup?
Do I just copy the entire HD over to the 'backup HD' once in a while?
Or can you suggest another way?
Also, is there a way to connect directly from HD-to-Backup-HD?
I only have one Firewire 800 port and would prefer to avoid transferring files from one HD through firewire to computer then from computer through USB to the backup HD.
