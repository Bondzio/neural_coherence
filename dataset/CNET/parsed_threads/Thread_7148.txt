<s> I am wondering how to tell when a power supply upgrade is recommended. </s>
<s> Here is some information about my current PC configuration: Windows XP SP2 Pentium D Processor 1GB RAM GeForce 6600 Video Card ATI TV Tuner Card SoundBlaster XFI Sound Card Qty. </s>
<s> 2 250GB Seagate Hard Drives (one as PVR and other a main drive) Qty. </s>
<s> 1 160GB Seagate Hard Drive (used for backups) Linksys Wireless Card From what I can see, the power supply is 350W. </s>
<s> Any other information that would be helpful? </s>
<s> Are there symptoms to look for that indicate the power supply is not sufficiently powering the system components? </s>
<s> If an upgrade is recommended, what is a good brand....easy to install and won't drain the bank? </s>
<s> Also, I have an LCD TV connected to the video card (GeForce 6600) via DVI to HDMI. </s>
<s> I have not been able to get the image to fit the screen precisely - the resolution is either too high and the whole image cannot be viewed or it's too low, leaving empty space around the edges. </s>
<s> There's a place in the card driver that allows for a custom resolution but it won't allow the resolution of the TV (1366x768). </s>
<s> Is anyone aware of a card that will allow such a resolution? </s>
<s> I've been looking at both ATI and NVIDIA cards but I don't see anywhere stating anything specific about this resolution. </s>
<s> To head off any power problems just buy a decent namebrand PSU that's a 100W over your current rated PSU. </s>
<s> However, if you get a cheap PSU consider one that's at least 500W or better, even a 600W one that suitable plus fits as it should in your system physically. </s>
<s> Visit this website to gauge your power needs, http://www.pcpowerandcooling.com and if you buy one from them consider money well spent, they provide a stable and dependable PSU of highest quality. </s>
<s> A good stable PSU is the foundation of a good system. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> One possible investment might be a battery backup/surge protector. </s>
<s> They have small enough batteries for them to be almost as big as a regular surge protector. </s>
<s> But with the added bonus of monitoring how much power your computer needs. </s>
<s> They have this so that they can calculate how long the battery will last before shutting down your computer. </s>
<s> Some of them will even shut down your computer automatically. </s>
<s> And with that software you can see for yourself what wattage your computer uses. </s>
<s> I guess theres those &quot;quality watts&quot; verses those &quot;cheap watts&quot;. </s>
<s> Unless your computer is crashing, I'd leave it be. </s>
<s> site. </s>
<s> They have complete instructions on how to modify their drivers/software? </s>
<s> to handle the wide screen resolutions. </s>
<s> Very likely that ATI also can provide such info. </s>
<s> I have the link on my computer at home but won't be back to that computer for about a week. </s>
<s> As far as a power supply upgrade, if you are not currently having a know power supply, I say if it ain't broke don't fix it. </s>
<s> Yep as Willy says, if you get one go up another 100 watts over your 350. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=PSU+Calculator The only thing they don't tell you is which PSUs are really worth installing. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> and found that the system is only drawing about 200 watts, even when I pushed the system to utilize as many resources as possible simultaneously. </s>
<s> I tried a couple different of the PSU calculators and they indicated that I would need one over 400 watts. </s>
<s> only 70% efficient...some of the higher end unit go 80%-85%. </s>
<s> And the greater the efficiency...the lower your electric bill will be. </s>
<s> Do they show the same (220W) at startup ? </s>
