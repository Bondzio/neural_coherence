Does it connect at any hotspot anywhere.
Usually and if I can connect at home using the setups we note in our forum note we usually skip trying at home and head out to a hotspot with a laptop and the device in tow.
We connect with the laptop just to be sure the area works and then try the device.
Hope this helps but I'm offline soon so recheck our forum sticky note.
If you use any other setting in your router than stock and what we write about please share.
