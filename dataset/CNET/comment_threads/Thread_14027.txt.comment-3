when I try to renew my IP, it just remians idle until my connection attempt is timed out.
Is my only other option network wizard setup because I'm not sure how to configure it correctly.
It seems my only problem is on the receiving end and not the sending end.
My OS is Windows XP Pro btw.
Any other suggestions would be great...
