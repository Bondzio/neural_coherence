It may run smoothly for more than 1 hour but I never checked it. (I can play songs, movie, browse internet simultaneously).If I restart the PC, it freezes. And if I try to boot it again, it doesnt boot. I keep it OFF for 1 hour. After 1 hour it runs for sometime and freezes again. Mouse and keyboard also stop working. The only way to restart it to press cabinet button for 5 sec so supply to motherboard get cut off. So if I want to run it for long time, I need to keep it OFF at least 1 day and I cant restart it. I checked RAM. IT is working fine. My configuration is AMD phenom x2 550 black edition. ASUS M2N68-AM Plus motherboard PSU: Xtech 450-24,Max 450w GPU: NVIDIA GeForce 7025/nforce 630a Initial processor temperature is 36C which increases to 48C in 5 mins under zero load. I have updated my BIOS version from 0701 to 0804. So what could be the problem??

If not, then place fan to help cool it. If it continues to cause a problem at the same stop intervals as before, you may have a &quot;bad caps&quot; situation, google for examples. Next, your PSU maybe petering out, check all fans to see they're running to include PSU one(if present). I won't return side until it appears fixed. If upon returning side cover and it still stops/freezes, then you have some component(anything) that's been compromised by heat stress and will fail all together at some future point. Then and only then will it becomes obvious as it will work intermittently until failure. In this case only swapping parts may do to help determine cause. tada -----Willy
