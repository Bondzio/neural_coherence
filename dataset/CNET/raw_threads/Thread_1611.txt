I have it hooked up to my main computer in my room and the laptop also in my room. My connection goes from 54Mbps to 2.0Mbps in a matter of about 30min. I always seem to loose strength even though the router is right there next to the laptop. I have to reboot my laptop just to get back to 54Mbps. Not sure why I have to reboot once it goes between 1.0-2.0Mbps, when my laptop is right there. Any ideas?
