1.1.1	hi guys.	St
1.1.2	im trying to find a bday present for my girl and i remembered shes been moaning about not having wireless printing capability.	St
1.1.3	i figure it might have been a hint... shes got a brother hl-5140 printer and a sony pcg - frv25 laptop.	St
1.1.4	i cant find anything to work with her printer other than brother's expensive wireless print server.	St
1.1.5	and i dont think her laptop has bluetooth.	St
1.1.6	any help is appreciated.	St
1.1.7	thanks!	St
1.2.1	Depending on the rest of her setup, you don't need the printer brands hardware.	St
1.2.2	She will need a wireless network card....either mini PCI if available or using an available add in slot (pcmcia types).	St
1.2.3	Something with 802.11 b/g should be fine.	St
1.2.4	These can be bought for under $50.	St
1.2.5	Wireless print servers come in parallel and USB types and tend to run about $80 and up though bargains can be found.	St
1.2.6	If this is within your price range, options are many.	St
1.3.1	Some print servers just don't work with certain printers.	St
1.3.2	I was trying to find the HL-5140 on a list of printers known to be comaptible (or incompatible) with particular print servers.	St
1.3.3	I haven't done a comprehensive search, but I didn't see it on any list one way or the other.	St
1.3.4	SUGGESTION FOR coolanticool: you might want to contact the major mfgs.	St
1.3.5	(Linksys, Belkin, D-link, Netgear, etc.)	St
1.3.6	and ask them which of their print servers will support the HL-5140.	St
