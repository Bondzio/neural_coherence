well, i did not know that micron and crucial is the same.how come one chips is taller that another one ?
that's what i thought was a cheat.
computer is p4 (it was bought long time ago in 2001 i believe) and it is custom made.
has an intel mb gag915.
4 memory slots present on mb...memory is working in dual channel mode 1gb-512mb-1gb-512mb.
like i mentioned in my first post - even though i returned to my old configuration that i just stated i still continue having problems.
should have stayed with my previous config (it was working just fine) but i wanted to upgrade (forgetting about that for windows xp pro) which i am running..it would not matter because if i use 3gb or 4gb ram it will still be as 3.
