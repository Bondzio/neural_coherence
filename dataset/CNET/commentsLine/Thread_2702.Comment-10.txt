my problems are that i can't connect to my dsl connection, i might be picking up the neighbours broadband connection and i can't file and print share.
as well, when i created a netsetup file (with the network setup wizard) on my windows xp laptop my windows 2000 computer told me that netsetup was not compatible with windows 2000. however, i finally got windows xp so i'm going to install that and then reset the router.
hopefully then i will be able to set up the network.
thanks for your help anyways.
