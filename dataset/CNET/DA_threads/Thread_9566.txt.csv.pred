1.1.1	I've been having some trouble with my wlan lately so I try to upgrade the firmware on my DI-524 I've downloaded the new version off dlink marked march 2009, when I apply it my router claims upgrade was successful and restarts but I still have the old firmware marked april 2006.	St
1.1.2	Anyone have any idea what's wrong?	St
1.1.3	Thanks	Polite
