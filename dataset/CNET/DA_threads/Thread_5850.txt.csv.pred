1.1.1	system: intel p-4, 1.4ghz, 256mb rdram, 80gb hdd I replaced a blown power supply in my computer and am unable to get any display whatsoever.	St
1.1.2	Upon looking at the graphics card I noticed that one of the capacitors was &quot;expanded&quot; (the top seemed to be growing up out of the body of the cap), I'm pretty sure it's blown so I temporarily installed a radeon 9250 from another computer that I know is good and connected to a differant monitor as well to eliminate these 2 as potiential causes of the problem...all I get upon booting up is a blank screen!	St
1.1.3	Could I have fried the mobo when the old power supply blew?	St
1.1.4	I am unsure as to how to determine if the mobo is faulty or not.	St
1.1.5	Any help would be muchly appreciated...	St
1.2.1	Is anything starting up/spinning up ?	Ques
1.2.2	Hard drives, CPU fans, case fans ??	Ques
1.2.3	?	Ques
