<s> I had the opportunity to restore Windows XP on a E Machine model T3092 with a 3000XP Athlon and 512mb ram and was amazed at how fast it could boot up and load programs compared to my P4 2.8 with 1024mb ram. </s>
<s> I know I have not had a reason to reload my computer for some time but have done at least one other P4 2.8 and I always thought they were quick until now. </s>
<s> This E Machine is running factory and not over clocked and I am surprised as to how quick it is. </s>
<s> Should'nt the performance on these two computers not be closer. </s>
<s> Looking for opinions and not any real tech stuff I wouldn't understand. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I have a P4 3.4 GHz, with 4GB RAM DDR2, ATI X700 256MB, with SATA RAPTOR 10K RPM. </s>
<s> On which I use to run program for PIC MicroChip Emulator, to test programs that I make for PIC Processor. </s>
<s> At that time I also had a P4 2.8, 1GB Laptop. </s>
<s> But one of the guys from my office walked up to me and asked me to exchange his laptop for mine, his was a brand new Athlon 64, with 512MB but it had few other things like Wireless and better looking screen, he wanted to exchange it because I had a serial port on mine. </s>
<s> So I thought it was a good deal but not a great one, still I did exchange it, after installation I Ran the same emulation program to my surprise the program actually was running 5-6 times faster. </s>
<s> Which is really amazing. </s>
<s> BTW if you want your machine to boot really fast don't install MS Office, I use OpenOffice and it really boots up faster and works faster after being booted up. </s>
<s> I keep my start menu and services trimmed and is very close in content to the new install I just did to the E machine, so I am sure this is not the difference which is large. </s>
<s> Also the P4 I did awhile ago was fresh as well and was not noticeably faster than mine. </s>
<s> I have looked into comparisons at various sites and found these configurations should be close in operation speed. </s>
<s> Are Athlons normally quicker at start up? </s>
<s> Webroots Spysweeper has been slowing my computer down immensely and when turned off it is much faster, but is still slower than the Athlon version. </s>
<s> Download 3D Mark 06 and SiSoft Sandra if you want to compare them. </s>
