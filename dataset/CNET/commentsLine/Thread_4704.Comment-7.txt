...to everyone who answered.
judging from what i've read, i will choose to store all of the photos on dvds, making three copies of each, following safe storage practices in three locations.
and, because i have my grandmother's photo albums which contain decent-quality photos from as far back as the 1860's, i will also print what i consider &quot;irreplaceable&quot; photos and store them in archive-quality sleeves in albums.
