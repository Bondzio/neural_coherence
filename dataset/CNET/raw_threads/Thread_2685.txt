1496	0	19390	207960	NR	bones1060	4/12/04 9:16 AM	1.08176136E12	Tech Illiterate	After reading and researching several home/small business printers and scanners, I still can't decide what to buy. The scanner I am thinking of is the Epson 1670 Photo (comments?) but the printer I am looking for (please help!) would offer high quality color and text, have an ADF, prefer multiple colors so to only replace colors as necessary. I would be using this for cards, invitations, letters, pictures (next purchase is 1st digital camera) mostly creative personal stuff but some small business things that I want to look professional. Speed is somewhat an issue because I normally do 200 cards, etc. at a time. Any suggestions? I'm just mind boggled by all the variations.

Proffitt	4/12/04 12:21 PM	1.08177246E12	Re:Tech Illiterate	An issue that can catch most people offguard is that you may find that ink will have to be handy at 200 sheet runs. When I do my yearly mailing, I have one spare ink cart before I print and usually have to replace all but one... Today's printer at home is the Epson C80. It's getting a few years old so when it messes up, the C84 or the 6 color with CD printing capability unit is what I'll probably get. Bob
