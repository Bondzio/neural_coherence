Is this a common problem with the Intel Fans? Should I just buy a less loud aftermarket fan? Any thoughts on why it's so loud? Thanks for any help. Russ

Power down and check the fan blade area to see if anything is touching the fan blades as they spin around. Every once in awhile, someone will have a bent blade or a cable the is in the wrong place, but I bought some Intel HSFs to replace some third party fans so to drop some noise. Bob
