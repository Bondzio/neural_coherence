I have ran Lexmark printers for a number of years and have had great results and yes the ink levels are accurate as with ALL other printers that have this tool.
I have had the best results with Lexmark printers so much so that it is the main one that I recommend to my family and friends and we use them at work as well.
With this being said Lexmark also has the best tech support as well in my opinion.
I use to run Canon printers and they were not up to par.
