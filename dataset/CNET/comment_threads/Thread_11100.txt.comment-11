Not necessary to have a switch on both ends as long as you have enought ports to use.
But I placed the wireless router for you on both ends to allow your laptop (or any WiFi Devices) to roam between two location.
Routing function should NOT be use on router #2 (WAN Port should not be plugged in at all).
DHCP should be DISABLE.
The purpose of wireless router #2 is to provide wirless access to your network for all your WiFi devices.
