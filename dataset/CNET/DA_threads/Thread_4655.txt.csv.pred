1.1.1	So I've finally snagged myself a dandy gaming computer for $660.	St
1.1.2	Here's the specs.	St
1.1.3	http://i405.photobucket.com/albums/pp138/NightHawkXi/ComputerSpecs.jpg It came with an intel graphics card, integrated, which I imagine isn't good.	St
1.1.4	It runs Counterstrike Source, and other games just fine, smooth, no lag, half life 2 runs like a peace of cake, but I want to upgrade the graphics card to play better looking games, like Modern Warfare 2, APB, Global Agenda, and Blacklight Tango down.	St
1.1.5	Any recommendations?	St
1.1.6	I'm looking between $119 - $169	St
1.2.1	My recommendation would be an ATI 5770 card.	St
1.2.2	It would be near the upper end of you budget, but with some looking, you could find something.	St
1.2.3	What kind of Power Supply do you currently have on your computer?	St
1.2.4	Depending on what you get, you might not have the power(or proper connectors) to use the new card.	St
