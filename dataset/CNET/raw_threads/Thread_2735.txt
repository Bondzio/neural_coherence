After 5 seconds it blacks out. I called HP in November 2005, and they told me I was no longer under warranty and could buy a new one. I did not, but decided to continue to get info. Yesterday, I found out that they have admitted that some HP 1703 monitors have existing &quot;hardware issues&quot; which HP is NOW willing to replace! Below is the link. If you speak to an HP service rep to tell them about your problem, they don't tell you anything about the replacement unless you KNOW ABOUT IT. Stinks. But true. Please pass this along!!! ~Irma http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/genericDocument?cc=us&docname=c00409521&lc=en This document pertains to the HP Pavilion f1703 Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitor. Some of these monitors have been identified as having a hardware issue that can cause intermittent video, no video, or no backlight. You may be eligible for a free product replacement or repair depending on the service options available in your country.
