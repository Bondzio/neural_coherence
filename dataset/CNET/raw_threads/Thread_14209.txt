I don't want to &quot;rent&quot; the current modem ($7.00 per month) I have from Comcast. I want to 1. stream internet TV from the router and 2. use my laptop wirelessly for browsing the internet. I have Comcast cable internet with 20/5 service. Thanks for any info!

If you are in a D3 area that will give you 4 bonded channels down. If your not now in a D3 area, you will be before long. Your speeds will be more constant with the bonded channels. No more of the 6 to midnight slowdowns. They are also testing bonded channels on the upload so that will just be a matter of time. I use a Motorola SB 6120 modem and a Netgear WNR 3500L router and that setup works excellent doing the same thing you want to do. Bestbuy carries both the modem and router.
