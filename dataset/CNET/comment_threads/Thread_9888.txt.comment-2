YES!
I will be able to use your wifi connection since WEP, even with MAC FILTERS is crackable in about 120 seconds now.
If there is any way to get the old insecure stuff gone I strongly suggest it.
Even if it means getting wired or using a BRIDGE.
I use a WGPS606 on WPA today for such a connection.
