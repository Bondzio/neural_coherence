Maybe you are confusing with a BIOS reset.
If you have the mobo book, it'll tell you how.
Else, open the computer, pull out the button battery (you can't miss it - you may only damage the mounting if not careful! )
wait for about ten minutes and put it back.
Warning!
If you are not aware of the BIOS settings and what they mean, get a knowledgable person to do this.
