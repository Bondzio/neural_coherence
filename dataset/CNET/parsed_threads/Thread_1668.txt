<s> I want to max out my Gigabyte 7IXE4 motherboard. </s>
<s> I currently have a Duron 850Mhz and want to go up to a 1.4Ghz. </s>
<s> Yes I know it still isn't that fast, but getting a new motherboard is not an option. </s>
<s> I wanted an Athlon Thunderbird 1.4Ghz, but I'm not sure if I'll even be able to find one anywhere. </s>
<s> There's the Duron 1.4Ghz, but that would require a BIOS upgrade, which I've never done before and could be risky. </s>
<s> My mom also uses this computer for important things so if I were to mess it up it would be hell. </s>
<s> There's also the option of an AthlonXP, but I'm not sure if the motherboard will support it. </s>
<s> The FAQ on the Gigabyte website says that the board supports Duron and AthlonXPs, but on the same website there is a processor compatibility chart that doesn't list any of the XPs as compatible. </s>
<s> I'm not really sure what to do and could use some advice as to the best path. </s>
<s> Thanks Adam </s>
<s> I made this jump 2 years ago. </s>
<s> Big difference between Duron850 and Athlon T-Bird. </s>

<s> In short. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> BIOS Update. </s>
<s> It's something I've done many times (2^9 times?) </s>
<s> and for me has never lost a board. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> If it doesn't list the XP, then it's not going to support it. </s>
<s> But did I look at the wrong board at http://www.giga-byte.com/Motherboard/Support/CPUSupportList/CPUSupportList_GA-7IXE4.htm since it lists some XP CPUs. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> I don't see a lot of these CPUs out there either. </s>

<s> Thanks Tharpeli, but unfortunately I live in Canada. </s>
<s> I think I will upgrade my BIOS and then see what the local tech shop can do. </s>
<s> R. Proffitt, I was just curious as to what method you use to upgrade the BIOS. </s>
<s> The Gigabyte website has three utilities, one updates from the operating system, one searches the internet and the other is through DOS. </s>
<s> I just want some more advice because I really don't want to screw this up. </s>
