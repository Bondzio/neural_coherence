i checked on newegg.com, and i couldn't find any specs on the power supply other than it was 400 watts.
i also checked rosewill's website and couldn't find any stats on the power supply.
all power supplies are not created equal.
i have a cheap power supply fry a motherboard when it failed after 8 months of use.
todays motherboards, processors and video cards can really stress a power supply, especially when used for long gaming sessions.
the cheapest 400 watt power supply (which there are stats for) on rosewill's website has a msrp of only $10 less than the msrp of the r114a case.
you can bet you are not getting that power supply in the case.
you are much better off buying case and power supply separately.
it cost more initially, but it is my experience that you will most likely have to replace the no-name power supply in two years anyway, after an infuriating period of searching to figure out why your computer keeps crashing.
it is definately cheaper than replacing your motherboard.
whatever powersupply you get, make sure it has dual fans and will shut down before it overheats.
i only use antec truepower power supplies now.
they were one of the few in all the tests and reviews i found that actually delivered what the stats promised.
in fact, they actually exceeded antec's published stats.
as for cases, i am hooked on lian li.
they may not have the fancy lights and graphics, and they are definatily more expensive, but with thumb screws for almost everything, plenty of fans, and a back panel/motherboard tray combo that slides out the back, they are the easiest case i have ever worked on.
