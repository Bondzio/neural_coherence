<s> I plan to build a PC primarily for use in professional digital still photo editing. </s>
<s> There are a number of graphic cards on the market geared towards gaming and 3D workstations. </s>
<s> Many of these are popular, such as nvidia 6800 and ATI 800, but I don't know if they are technically suited to my purpose. </s>
<s> I don't mind overkill however, I would like to at least have the minimum requirements covered. </s>
<s> Can you recommend a graphic card(s) to use for digital photo editing? </s>
<s> Many forget color calibration tools like this one -&gt; http://www.mysimon.com/Pantone_ColorVision_Spyder_with_PhotoCAL_display_color_calibration_kit/4014-6513_8-30481787.html?tag=ob_20&orderby=20&sort=asc If you don't get calibrated color, then the edits can be a waste of time. </s>

<s> The monitor would be more important than the video card. </s>

<s> if its any help i use 256MB NVIDIA GeForce FX 5500 card in a 3.2 pentium4 with 512 mb memory system this suits me fine for photo edits </s>
<s> IF you have cash to throw around buy yourself a Nvidea geforce 6600GT with 128mb ram. </s>
<s> That is an overkill, and only around $200AU. </s>
<s> you would do fine with anything upwards of a geforce 5200 for editing - but I recommend grabbing a new display at the same time - dell or Apple's flat panels are nice if u have a lot of cash, but if not just get a flat screen CRT from Samsung or somebody. </s>
<s> Things to look out for without getting yourself buried in specs: Video Card: GPU clock speed - most GPU are 300-600mhz. </s>
<s> The 6600GT is 1000mhz I think - not sure atm. </s>
<s> 128mb ram would be fine, u could even scrape by with 64 - go no lower though. </s>
<s> Monitor - Refresh rate isn't really important for what you want, but be on the lookout for things like colour fidility. </s>
<s> If you can get an LCD over a CRT as they are 1) much better for your eyes, and 2) Take up less desk space, so you have somewhere to put your camera. </s>
<s> The video card needs enough memory to do the highest color depth possible at the resolution you choose to run. </s>
<s> That is it. </s>
<s> Then, you need to look at more important things, like the monitor. </s>
<s> The monitor will make a huge difference because of color correctness issues. </s>
<s> Good monitors come with software to let you adjust the colors to be correct so that you can count on the color. </s>
<s> Again, this is a function of color correction being configurable, and having a good monitor. </s>
<s> Save your money when it comes to the card, you will more than make up for it when you buy the monitor. </s>
<s> It is more important to have the correct monitor than the video card. </s>
<s> You must remember that what you see on your monitor is not exactly how it will appear printed. </s>
<s> You can feasibly get by with any cheap video card. </s>
<s> I think that your needs should be met within the $150.00 US range. </s>
<s> Try a NVidia 5700 LE or ATI 9800 series card. </s>
<s> Any well-known brand of video card that has AT LEAST 32mb of ram should be good enough. </s>
<s> I use an older 32mb ATI Rage and a 17&quot; CRT with VERY GOOD results. </s>
<s> Many times, though, I have wished for a little more ram on the video card to speed up the process. </s>
<s> Enough ram in the computer is important, too. </s>
<s> That has not been mentioned in any of the posts. </s>
<s> If you are building the machine now, use a motherboard that will accept at least a GIG of ram & use it. </s>
<s> You will not regret having the extra ram. </s>
<s> Any good video card with 128k should be more than good enough. </s>
<s> Stay with a GOOD CRT. </s>
<s> Get the largest you can afford. </s>
<s> A 21&quot; if you can - and flat screen. </s>
<s> It is my understanding that the CRT refresh rate is usually better and that the colors are truer. </s>
<s> Use good photo editing software (Adobe Photoshop is one of the best). </s>
<s> Adobe is one of the software packages that will allow you to configure the color output of your monitor so that it most closely matches your printer. </s>
<s> Speaking of printer - this was also not mentioned in any of the posts. </s>
<s> If a printed photo is the desired result, make sure that you use a good quality PHOTO printer. </s>
<s> Use the best ink carts you can get (usually the factory ones) & be sure to use &quot;photo&quot; inks and be certain to use good quality photo paper. </s>
<s> I won't mention any brand, but there are several good ones and they are not cheap! </s>
<s> If you do these things, you will have good results and not many complaints (assuming that you do a good job retouching)! </s>
<s> You are just using this for 2D so great calculations of polygons isn't an issue. </s>
<s> From what I have read of the past few years is that ATI is going to give you better images but nvidia is going to give greater speed. </s>
<s> Going with one of their top end cards is overkill for what you are using it for. </s>
<s> ATI X600 is great and not too expensive. </s>
<s> Yeah, flat panels are great on saving space, but not as versatile as the old-fashioned, but undeniably better CRT. </s>
<s> Get a 21 or 25 inch CRT monitor by a name brand manufacturer and you will get, aside from less desk space and higher electricity bills, a machine that is more apt to get you better color rendition and the variable resolutions ESSENTIAL FOR THE PROFESSIONAL. </s>
<s> I have had really good luck with fairly cheap cards for video editing. </s>
<s> I find the most important thing to be the software that you will be using to edit with. </s>
<s> you can get very good software quite reasonably, I reccomend Photoshop elements unless you are a real techie, than I would go with the full Photoshop program, it is spendy but well worth it. </s>
<s> The monitor issue is not all that important either if you use the right software you can calibrate any good monitor to work very well. </s>
<s> here is a link for a very good card at a great price. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/app/viewproductdesc.asp?description=14-170-065&DEPA=0 </s>
<s> You don't need a 400 or 500 dollar card unless your planning on gaming also. </s>
<s> For editing photo's you might want to look at the Matrox Millennium P750 with 64mb ($213.00) or even the Millennium G550 with 32mb ($94.00) http://www.matrox.com/mga/3d_gaming/products.cfm Matrox makes other cards like the Parhelia DL256 PCI graphics card but there prices are out of most users range. </s>
<s> Before settling on anything check prices on http://www.pricewatch.com/ and others. </s>
<s> * For still digital editing you need two things: 1. </s>
<s> True color fidelity video card that support 32-bit color pallette at the highest horizontal refresh rate comparable with your monitor. </s>
<s> 16-bit color pallette is acceptable. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> 17&quot; or larger monitor that support 32-bit color at the color pallette size you want (32-bit); the screen resolution you want (1024x768) or larger; the smallest dot pitch that you can afford to buy; and the highest supported horizontal refresh rate at the screen resolution and color pallette size you want. </s>
<s> Video card works in tandem with your monitor. </s>
<s> Don't waste your money buying a high-end video card when your monitor can only support low-end resolution. </s>
<s> Check the specification of your monitor before buying video card. </s>
<s> Horizontal refresh rate of 75 HZ or higher is strongly recommended if you were to spend alot of time editing pictures. </s>
<s> Higher rate may be required for some people who're more sensitive to &quot;flickering screen&quot;. </s>
<s> Higher refresh rate (horizontal) helps reduce eye straint/fatigue. </s>
<s> First, find out the size of your monitor (14&quot;, 15&quot; 17&quot;, 18&quot;, 19&quot;, 21&quot;, etc.). </s>
<s> Next, find out the horizontal refresh rate of your monitor at the 16-bit color pallette and screen resolution of 1024x768 and at 1280x1024 resolution. </s>
<s> Repeat the above step with 32-bit color pallette, if applicable. </s>
<s> You should see a table similar to this: ------------------------------------------ Monitor Screen Color </s>
