1.1.1	Hi , Recently , I purchased a DVD writer and I am using Nero suite from Samsung for CD burning , which came along the DVD writer.	St
1.1.2	I did write a few DVDs, but now I broght a HP Re-writeable DVD, which is 4.7 GB, but now when I insert the DVD in the DVD Rom , the system hangs and just to check if the Cd empty , I completely erased the DVD using Nero , but even then, when I write sample movies for trials , the system hangs and only after I eject the DVD , the system becomes normal.	St
1.1.3	I have intel pentium Dual dore , 512 MB Ram , 80 GB HD.	St
1.1.4	Please let me know if there is any problem with the DVD or is it with the OS , FYI:I reinstalled the Nero suite once agin .	Sug
1.1.5	Please advise .	St
1.1.6	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	DVD writers are created equal.	St
1.2.2	Learn the difference between +R, -R. +-RW both on the dvds and the writers.	St
1.2.3	Make sure you have the correct mix.	Res
1.2.4	Most of today's writers do it all, including CDs.	St
1.2.5	Then there is the issue of each writer's laser alignment.	St
1.2.6	If either is off just a little bit, you'll have the same problem.	St
1.2.7	Good Luck!	St
1.2.8	Let us know.. and life goes on... Jack	St
1.3.1	In your Nero Installation, there will be an area that allows you to check for upgraded components to the Nero Suite.	St
1.3.2	These upgrades may solve a majority of the problems you are describing with your burner.	St
1.3.3	Know that whenever you install Nero OEM out of the box, you are never getting the latest version of the program.	St
1.4.1	I went thru that pain in the neck.. NERO is an advanced product..I started w/ROXIO Software.. ..	St
1.4.2	I would/in my experiance..recommned that you purchase a Full Version..don't even use some FREEbie that came packed in the Drive Box.. ..	St
1.4.3	I use the NERO Brand these days and its in need of good PC Hardware.. ROXIO is a nice beginner's software..	St
1.4.4	They really go for like....$$70.00 to $$100.00/no big deal considering the headaches of BOXED software.	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
