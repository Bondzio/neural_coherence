I'll be up front, this is a question for homework help.
I'm not asking for an answer (that'd be cheating), more like direction to where I can find an answer (or if I'm on the right track with my hunch).
I want to create a website but only allow a certain user or group of users access to that website.
Assuming that user or users will be from the same location, and likely the same static IP, can I throw a firewall between my internet connection and web server and only allow that specific IP address access to my web server by a rule?
If there is a better way to handle that, I'd appreciate being pointed in the right direction.
Thanks!
