<s> I purchased an HP dv8000 laptop last April 2006, along with the Cingular 3G Connect card. </s>
<s> I agreed to a two year Cingular contract. </s>
<s> Since then, my HP has been sent in for repair to HP 3 times. </s>
<s> (a monitor problem) Since they could not fix it I received a New HP dv9000 last week. </s>
<s> Now I have two big problems, not only does Cingular NOT have the software for the communications Mgr out yet for Vista; BUT my new laptop does not have a PCMCIA slot. </s>
<s> Cingular does not have any wireless card for the new system. </s>
<s> They will NOT let me out of the contract and HP has no solution. </s>
<s> Verizon has a USB style card for $129.00 online (149.00 in store) supported by Vista with 2 yr agreement and $79 a month w/o voice account. </s>
<s> This is a mess and all because HP could not fix the XP laptop; with two slots standard. </s>
<s> They promised to replace my defective 8000 with exactly the same features but they don't make them exactly the same any more saying the PCMICA slot is old technology. </s>
<s> They should pay for my $175.00 break of contract fee with Cingular but will not. </s>
<s> Technology perhaps is going to fast. </s>
<s> It only helps those that use it at work or home. </s>
<s> Look up the EVDO ROUTER on google.com. </s>
<s> As to the slots, people move too fast and get a laptop and don't notice the new slots that have been out for over a year now. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> and ask if they will upgrade your replacement to a refurb business notebook that has the PCMCIA slot. </s>
<s> You may have to pay for the upgrade. </s>
<s> In any case it looks like you can't avoid additional expense and that's disgraceful for all the vendors in your situation. </s>
<s> Re technology going too fast...it's certainly not well planned for consumer products and every competitor is rushing to grab the money as long as consumers are anxious to part with it. </s>
<s> Next time if you need technology stability, look for the business products that have longer lifecycles. </s>
<s> Costs more but you can expect longer usability than the consumer cousins. </s>
