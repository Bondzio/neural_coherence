You also have to allow the other firewalls to let the network data through. I am told, but I haven't tried this myself, that each XP computer on a network needs an account for the other computers; eg, if 3 users use one XP computer, so they should each have their own account names. The same is true in a network that each computer needs an account on the others, but like I say, I have never done this myself, so I can't say that this is definitely so. Mark

3369	6	244170	2467247	2467226	frankzxcv	4/22/07 6:43 PM	1.17726738E12	success	well thanks very much for the free coaching. it worked. duh, i forgot the ustair firewall! now i have to remember to configure the firewall on the other downstaors comp. well while i read every book i could find on home networking i never found a simple checklist, and i am no expert but this is what i did networking xp and 2k machines: 1) on each machine, create an identical username (that will exist as a username on each machine), with the same name and password. (give this name admin rights) this user must have a password, but for wake onlan etc i have another username with no password be the default startup user, with no sign-in window. all that matters is those common names and passwords just exist on all computers, they don;t have to be logged on apparently. 2) in win2k, use the network wizard (sytem/ network id) to create a workgroup name. have each computer join this network (same name). 3 in windows explorer, under properties allow sharing. use the window to turn the disk names to plain, not with $ sign as that makes it invisible. 4 allow access to ip addresses in all firewalls on all computers. may not be totally correct but that's what worked i think. never saw this simple list anywhere. --fj

I have my XP networked to an old Windows ME computer, and setting it up on my own was a nightmare. But at least you're up and running now, which is good. Mark
