the inlet fan also blows over the processor and is quite a good design however i wish there was a way to adjust the rpms of these fans.
i believe a 100 rpm increase or less would make a substantial difference from what i have read in the intel site the fans stay pretty much constant until the processor gets to 72c and then goes to full throttle which seems like a poor design to me if you or anyone knows of a way to incrementally increase the (either) fan rpm please let me know, thanks
