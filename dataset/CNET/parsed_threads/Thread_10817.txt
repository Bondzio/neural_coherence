<s> whats is the recommended app for remote desktop? </s>
<s> i tried using pocketcloud free edition but the desktop redraw is kinda slow and no sound. </s>
<s> also the pro ver is too expensive i mainly use it view desktop, no gaming, so i guess i want about 5 fps-is it to much? </s>
<s> anyone tried airplay? </s>
<s> i am using window 7 64 bit and 400 kilobytes/s broadband, if possible i want to use the local wifi wireless router to collect-meaning dont use bandwidth since 400kb/s is kinda slow for high fps i guess. </s>
<s> I can only guess this is your first encounter with that technology but not one remote desktop I've seen comes close to what you get on the real machine. </s>
<s> In fact, the reason for such access is pretty simple. </s>
<s> To get at the desktop for the things you can't do on the other machine. </s>
<s> For me I use it to grab a file I forgot and when done I'm back to my machine. </s>
<s> If you see over 1 FPS, that's pretty normal. </s>

<s> I can look around their system and fix things. </s>
<s> I believe you can even reboot the PC remotely. </s>
<s> I tested it out already and it loaded VERY quickly and using it very impressive. </s>
<s> Moving around is very fast. </s>
<s> I am guessing you could probably remote into your own PC, but I haven't tried this yet. </s>
<s> It's one of the best apps for remote PC help. </s>
<s> It is also FREE for private use. </s>
<s> If you are a business, then you have to pay for it. </s>
<s> I know it works for MAC and I believe they have a dedicated iPad app as well. </s>
