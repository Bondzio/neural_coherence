is a rather obscure german clone, that's sold at shops like aldi and lidl here in holland.
nothing wrong with it, i assume, cheap and no doubt built from very standard components.
the first post about the model i find google isn't negative at all: &quot;i have a medion 1467 desktop pc, built like a rock and stable to boot.&quot; but i fear they don't publish detailed specs.
the best thing to do: go to a computer shop, take the case with you and let them advise you about a compatible psu.
