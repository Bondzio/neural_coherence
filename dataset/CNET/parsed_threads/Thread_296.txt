<s> hello, i just did a clean reinstall, abit kd7a mobo, soundblaster live! </s>
<s> 5.1 win 2000, but now my audio sounds like its underwater-- I think it's out of phase somehow. </s>
<s> I recall having this problem before but can't remember the fix! </s>
<s> creative labs site says my driver is up to date. </s>
<s> any ideas on how to fix? </s>
<s> thanks! </s>

<s> make sure you have all your chipset drivers that w2k may not have had. </s>
<s> Via? </s>
<s> Intel? </s>
<s> I agree with refurbb about reinstalling all the various motherboard chipset drivers. </s>
<s> I think that most people forget to reinstall the motherboard drivers when they reformat a drive to reinstall the Operating System. </s>
<s> I my case, I know that one of the motherboard drivers is for sound, though possibly for the integrated sound on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Anyway, check to see if when you installed the drivers for your Soundblaster card, it installed any 'utilities' for the card. </s>
<s> I'm thinking of utilities that allow you to 'shape' the sound for the room you are listening in. </s>
<s> These different 'evironments' make the output from your speakers sound different for each environment (concert hall, living room, large room, etc). </s>
<s> I had a similar problem with my card, and I had a heck of a time getting the setting back to where I thought it should be, or where I thought it sounded best. </s>
<s> You may have the same problem. </s>
<s> Check START\Programs\ and look to see if there are programs related for your card. </s>
<s> One might be a configuration utility program. </s>
<s> Otherwise check in C:\program files\ to find a soundblaster folder, and check inside for anything that looks like a configuration utility program. </s>
<s> Or third, check the driver CD that came with the sound card. </s>
<s> Hope it helps. </s>
<s> Good luck Larry </s>
<s> Frankzxcv: Check in Device Manager to see if the version of the driver that is installed is the most current. </s>
<s> Assuming that you have the latest drivers, you may want to try uninstalling from Device Manager, then reboot, letting XP reinstall the hardware. </s>
<s> I've had to do this with other hardware in the past. </s>
<s> Somehow drivers sometimes don't install properly. </s>
<s> thanks for the advice all, I was using the driver that came with the card and the creative site has a software checker that told me my driver was up to date-- but it was wrong. </s>
<s> I downloaded and installed the most recent driver and voila everything was fixed - fj </s>
<s> Frank: Glad to hear you solved the problem. </s>
<s> It seems that all to often on a new install, that Windows will install some outdated version of the driver. </s>
<s> When you check in Device Manager it says that the device is working properly, when in reality it may not. </s>
<s> I've been in that circle before, myself. </s>
<s> Not a lot of fun, but a good learning experience. </s>
