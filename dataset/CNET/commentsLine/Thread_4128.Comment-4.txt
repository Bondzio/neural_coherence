the container will be similar to a round ashtray.
in the container, you can put either paperclips, ipod, phone or post-it notes.
it would contain things you use or reach for everyday in an office setting.
i would like to clip this to my flat screen monitor.
the container will be at the side of the monitor but should be able to move to the back of the monitor if i want to hide it.
what materials do i need to ask for when i go to a local hardware store?
