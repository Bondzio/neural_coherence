i would look into a better psu, a dvd-rom, or media-card reader?
don't forget extra fans for cooling, windows and arctic silver 5,if you don't have windows cd, but oem or layman, if you have a store-bought windows computer's hard drive.
crucial ram, suggest change to corsair value instead.
other than that, looks good.
