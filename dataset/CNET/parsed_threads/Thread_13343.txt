<s> Honestly, I don't see a difference between the two. </s>
<s> The specs are exactly the same for both. </s>
<s> If you're concerned about ghosting, look at the response time, the lower, the better. </s>
<s> The only way to tell is to go into the store and look at it yourself. </s>
<s> Otherwise you can only rely on specifications alone. </s>
<s> I'd say get whatever one is cheaper. </s>
