<s> I got my new Maxtor 300gb ultra ata hard drive. </s>
<s> After i plugged every thing in, i turned on the computer, then it takes like longer then usual to boot up, i just keeps on saying detecting ide master and slave. </s>
<s> Is it suppose to take this long to boot up? </s>
<s> also, the windows boot screen was taking a little longer too. </s>
<s> Detected as 300GB by BIOS? </s>
<s> What OS version? </s>
<s> Windows XP SP1 or later? </s>
<s> How is drive attached (motherboard controller, PCI card controller)? </s>
<s> Master or Slave? </s>
<s> DMA or PIO on HD controller? </s>
<s> (should be DMA) </s>
<s> ultra ata133, the system says theres 279gb max, but isnt there suppose to be 300? </s>
<s> I have windows xp pro with sp2. </s>
<s> Im using the ide thing on the motherboard, i have a 450 watt power. </s>
<s> Im using this 300gb hard drive as a slave. </s>
<s> 300g unpartitioned is a whole lot to scan on boot. </s>
<s> I would diskpart anything over 80g for speed reasons. </s>
<s> so should i like partition the drive into like 150gb each? </s>
<s> and the 279 is primarily due to the fact that the drive mfr's report the size in decimal giga bytes, while Windows reports the size in Binary Gigabytes [higher number of bytes]. </s>
<s> Thus divide the decimal by the Binary and you'll get the lower number. </s>
<s> so do i still get the full 300gb's even though it says 279gb? </s>
<s> Here is the explanation from Maxtor's Knowledge Base: ''Why does my hard drive report less capacity than indicated on the drive's label?'' </s>
<s> ok so why is it still booting so slow. </s>
<s> Is the IDE CHANNEL that the drive is on set to DMA or PIO (see your Device Manager and look under IDE ATA/ATAPI CONTROLLERS)? </s>
<s> both primary and secondary say ide channel say dma in the advance settings. </s>
<s> Scan for viruses. </s>
<s> Scan for spyware with MORE THAN ONE antispyware program (try EWIDO, Spybot, Ad-Aware, MS-Antispyware Beta, SpySweeper-free trial). </s>
<s> For a clean system: http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1819090,00.asp </s>
<s> i know i don't have any viruses or spyware. </s>
<s> I got norton,spybot,spyware blaster,ad aware, and microsoft anti spyware. </s>
<s> How is the drive jumpered: Master, slave, cable select? </s>
<s> Is it on an ATA/100/133 data cable? </s>
<s> Is it the only drive on the data cable? </s>
<s> What is slow? </s>
<s> Can you post a boot time (min:sec)? </s>
<s> after i installed my new hard drive its been booting so slow. </s>
<s> I takes about 2 mins to get to the log in screen. </s>
<s> The new hard drive is set a slave and the original is set to master. </s>
<s> My 2 hard drives are on the same wire. </s>
<s> There both ultra ata133. </s>
<s> Its the black screen part where the pc boots up when you turn it on thats slow. </s>
<s> it the part before the windows boot screen. </s>
<s> Set the primary boot drive as a master and the only drive on the cable. </s>
<s> Put all other drives on the other IDE channel (other cable). </s>
<s> Restart and confirm that the it is the boot drive. </s>
<s> Also, go into BIOS and enable fast/rapid booting if it is not enabled. </s>
<s> After you get it up and running Windows, check again to make sure that it is in DMA mode. </s>
<s> ok it now not taking soo long to boot up, but now i don't see the drive on my computer. </s>
<s> Drive jumpered as Master? </s>
<s> Drive set in master position on cable? </s>
<s> (end of cable) Did you set the drive that has Windows as the first/primary boot voulume/disk? </s>
<s> (This is done in the BIOS settings). </s>
<s> thank you linkit, i now doesn't take a long time to boot,i just had to swith to the second ide channel and fix the jumper... thanks a lot! </s>
