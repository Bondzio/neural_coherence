Overdrive is going to be making my next PC that I will buy.
It actually seems like the &quot;better&quot; bang for my buck.
I know the prices are steep, but it looks like OPC will deliver.
Every single review I've read of theirs: A perfect score.
I hear the Tech Support is awesome.
Just look at this Rating: (and the reviews!)
