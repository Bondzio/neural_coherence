i have a lenovo mt-m9384-d5u cpu and a ibm thinkvision flat screen monitor.
the most bizarre thing is occuring on the computer.
the monitor is displaying everything at a 90 degree counter clockwise angle!
i restarted the machine and the windows xp startup screen displayed correctly, but when i got to my login screen, it is twisted to the 90 degree angle.
i've never seen that before.
someone have a solution for this?
thanks.
