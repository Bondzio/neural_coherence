when i start the computer a file called desktop.ini appears on the desktop which should be hidden.
when i try to delete it a notice comes which says the file desktop.ini is a system file.
if you remove it, your computer or one of your programs may no longer work correctly.
are you sure you want to move it to the recycle bin?
please what i can do to be able not to see this file which comes as a pair on desktop?
