i have cable internet (cable modem) with a wireless home network setup.
i have a desktop computer connected (wired) and a laptop which i use wirelessly via my home router.
pardon what may seem like a &quot;dumb&quot; question but my wireless connection with the laptop...would that be considered a wlan (wireless lan connection) or is it still a lan connection?
