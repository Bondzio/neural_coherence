i will not enter into any debate about any topical subject about activation.
my only input to you is to proceed with care on oem versions since others have felt burnt over patches they can't get from microsoft or if the oem version locks onto the machine its installed on and won't budge to the next machine.
since its an oem version, microsoft is not your supplier and will not help you move the license to another machine.
again, contain any ire and spit over this since i'm only trying to share that a few have been burnt.
be sure your oem supplier will supply support in patches that you can't download.
