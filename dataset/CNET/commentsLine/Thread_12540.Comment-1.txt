ok boys and girls, i have a few questions.
i have a dimension 4700 and i'm thinking about a few upgrades.
first, i'll tell you what and how i have it running.
here are my specs: 4700 ram: 2 x 512 433mhz ddr2 interrogated video intel pentium iv 3.4 ht 140 gb hd running vista enterprise (same as ultimate, minus media center) i tried to max it out as best as possible when i bought it.
now as to what i want to put in it.
i'm planning on adding 2 extra gigs of ram 2 x 1gb.
here is the url for the product.
now i don't think i will have a problem.
they match specs with the exception that this runs at 533 and the ram in the system is running at 400-something.
from what i understand, it'll just run at the slower speed, right?
now a graphics card is needed.
this is the one i had in mind.
again, i have the pcie card, so there shouldn't be a problem.
my only concern is my 305watt power supply.
i don't use all the features with the computer (all 6 usb ports) and things like that, so i'm not too worried.
so at the end i'm hoping to have these specs dell 4700 ram: 3 gb 2 x 1 gig and 2 x 512 video: geforce 7600gs 256 mb pentium iv 3.4 does that sound like a mean system or what??
what you you all think?
will i have issues with those parts?
anything i should know?
should i pull out the 512mb ram cards and leave it with 2 x 1gb or will it be fine with all four dimms taken?
thanks for all the advice.
jf
