<s> When I hit my e-Machine desktop's power button, things start to happen for about five seconds, then everything stops. </s>
<s> Punching F8 does nothing. </s>
<s> Holding the Esc key down causes the power and copyright screen (e-Machines) to remain on, but boot-up does not commence. </s>
<s> Am I probably looking at an OS or bios problem (WinXP Home), or is it more likely in the power supply itself? </s>
<s> What should I do? </s>

<s> It's definitely some hardware problem (if I define the boot portion of the BIOS as hardware), most likely the motherboard. </s>
<s> If you were able to get into the BIOS setup, you could try to reset it to defaults, but I expect that doesn't work (is it your f8, or is there another key on the e-machine to do so?). </s>
<s> Then all you can do is repair the machine yourself or have it done. </s>
<s> Be sure the costs are reasonable. </s>
<s> If they have to replace everything, a new PC could be cheaper and better. </s>
<s> But if it's just a rotten memory stick, it could be very cost-effective. </s>

<s> How long have you have you had it? </s>
<s> Is it still under warranty? </s>
<s> If you can't get it to work, I wouldn't do anything to void the warranty. </s>
<s> Just return it. </s>
<s> Given that it's a three-year-old Sam's Club special and that I wanted to replace the CRT with a flat panel anyway, and that it has some other annoying quirks, I think I'll just get a new one. </s>
<s> (Not from Sam's!) </s>
<s> I may be able to plug the hard drive into the new machine, but that's not a critical issue. </s>
