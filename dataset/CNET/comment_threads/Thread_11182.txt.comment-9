Have indicated several times the T6212 is a good buy for the $ and was one of the first to recommed it on these CNet forums.
The ATI X600Pro and X700 video cards are fine cards and beats the heck out of the ATI 300 cards that Dell was giving as standard for some of their computers.
I personally would not argue that the 6600GT is a better card than the X700.
It is natural that a recommendation for a ATI card would be made because of the motherboard having ATI Integrated (on board) graphics.
The majority of Integrated graphics on modern computers are Intel and I have never heard of those PC's recommending Nvidia cards.
You do, however have a good point concerning the warranty, and would be something to check out with Emachine.
One of my older computers is a Emachine that I have never had trouble with.
I took one of Best Buy's lowest cost add on warranties at the time of purchase, and had one of their 'Geek' guys install upgrades inside before I took the PC home for the wife.
