Right now I have an ASROCK board that works just fine although they tend to be the cheaper motherboards, so I am wondering if I can get better performance with another (more expensive) brand. And if so, what are good brands in motherboards? I am also a big fan of ATI graphics cards but have noticed may new motherboards come with NVIDIA chip sets. Are these chip sets compatible with an ATI graphics cards? Are they good chip sets or are there other chip sets I should look into? Thanks For All Your Help, Eric

There are 3 versions of nForce 4's and certainly they are totaly compatible with with ATI video cards, unless you go with the PCI X16 video and also want SLI, then the latest ATI &quot;SLI&quot; thing may have problems. I doubt if you want to spend in that class of video.
