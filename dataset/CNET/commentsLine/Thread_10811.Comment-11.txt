in the examples given all are boot and run from cd so to not disturb an otherwise working machine.
i'm sorry if that was lost somewhere as why these tools are so nice.
zero install, low to no risk.
the example given from 6 years ago used knoppix.
today you can do better with newer bootable cds like ubuntu.
-&gt; hope this clears that up.
