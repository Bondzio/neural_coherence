p. thanks for the link (  you saved me hours looking for the upgrade.
probably would not have found it on my own.
went directly to the site and ordered it for $49.95.
two day shipping was $11.95.
the only other shipping option was an overnite at $22.
received the secure package from fedex today.
the sonnettech site will notify you on any updates available for the purchases that you have just made.
nice idea.
next step: install.
thanks again, kevin
