numbers 13 and 14 in the diagram.
The parts list has &quot;no&quot; in the column for user replaceable.
The exploded picture shows them below the lid, but outside the case - which is impossible, they have to be inside, connected to the card somehow.
I think it was just artistic license to get them somewhere in the drawing, knowing full well that it couldn't matter to an end user as it is not a serviceable part.
Note that the diagrams and parts list are for the generic 2100 series, and I stand by my notion that even though the drawing shows the potential presence of the antenna, it may or may not be in that actual one.
He's got to find it himself - and if he didn't find it easily the first time (hence the question here) it may very well be that it isn't there at all, never was, and never will be.
If so, it's too bad he spent good money for the mini-PCI card.
Or maybe he just has to look harder now that he knows what to look for.
