cloning (vice copying) for most part implies 'cloning or replicating the complete content one hard disk to another hard disk.
in such cases, the destination or target drive is overwritten.
if there were were 50 directories and 50,000 files on drive 1, cloning drive 1 would put 50 directories and 50,000 files on disk 2. when you use product like ghost or true image ....you can clone the source drive to the target drive or alternatively image one hard drive (or partition on a hard drive) to another hard drive.
the difference is .
.
instead of the 50 directories and 50,000 files you get with cloning, imaging might give you say 15-20 image files which contain the 50 directories and 50,000 files.
and if you compress the image files during creation, you might end up with only 12-15 files using less disk space and not overwriting files on the target drive.
assuming there was sufficient disk space, you could create another image next week and the week after too.
hope this helps.
