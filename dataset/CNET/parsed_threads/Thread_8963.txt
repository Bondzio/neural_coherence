<s> I am a genealogist and I frequently go to libraries and other locations in search of documents. </s>
<s> These documents can be single sheets, photos, or even pages in books. </s>
<s> Is there a scanner that anyone knows of that is &quot;portable&quot; that I could take with my laptop to use when I'm in these environments? </s>
<s> It has an 8 megapixel camera and more. </s>
<s> There is no issue about enough pixels for the &quot;scan&quot;. </s>
<s> 8x11 = 88 square inches. </s>
<s> 8,000,000 divided by 88 = 90,909 pixels per square inch or 301 pixels per inch. </s>
<s> It's the HTC EVO 4G and you can find 8 Megapixel cameras today at many stores. </s>

<s> Thanks, Bob! </s>
<s> I have an 8 megapixel Canon camera that I could stick in my backpack and take along! </s>
<s> Don't know why I didn't think of that! </s>
<s> And scanning at 300 DPI you may find you want to have a few &quot;scans&quot; so you can pick the best one. </s>
