whats is the recommended app for remote desktop?
i tried using pocketcloud free edition but the desktop redraw is kinda slow and no sound.
also the pro ver is too expensive i mainly use it view desktop, no gaming, so i guess i want about 5 fps-is it to much?
anyone tried airplay?
i am using window 7 64 bit and 400 kilobytes/s broadband, if possible i want to use the local wifi wireless router to collect-meaning dont use bandwidth since 400kb/s is kinda slow for high fps i guess.
