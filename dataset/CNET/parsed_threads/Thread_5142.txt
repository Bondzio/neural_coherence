<s> I have an HP Pavilion computer with windows ME operating system. </s>
<s> It is connected to an HP deskjet 932C printer. </s>
<s> For a while now, when I print in color, I find that I get pink and black, but no blue and yellow. </s>
<s> I uninstalled and then reinstalled the printer. </s>
<s> I used the toolbox to clean the cartridges and recalibrate the printer. </s>
<s> Since this has happened with two cartridges, bought at separate times, I don't think it's a cartridge problem. </s>
<s> I have also cleaned the surfaces around the cartridge with a damp rag. </s>
<s> Nothing has worked thus far. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be most appreciated. </s>
<s> Hello Ruthinor, After going through the issue, I understood the issue could be with the printer copper contacts. </s>
<s> If the copper contacts get damaged, such issue occurs. </s>
<s> I have some steps to clean the copper contacts of the printer. </s>
<s> I am providing them below, pelase perform them: NOTE: You will need a clean, dry, soft, lint free cloth, cotton swabs and distilled water. </s>
<s> (Use of cleaning agents or cleaning alcohol may damage the electrical contacts.) </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Power on the printer and raise the printer's top cover. </s>
<s> Wait for the carriage to stop. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Unplug the power cord from the back of the printer. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Remove the ink cartridges from the cradles and place them on their sides (with the widest side down) onto a scrap piece of paper. </s>
<s> CAUTION: Keep the print cartridges out of the reach of children and make sure that the cartridges are not kept outside the printer for more than 30 minutes. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Ensure that the copper flex circuitry on the back of the cartridge is intact and not damaged. </s>
<s> Black HP No. </s>
<s> 45 (HP 51645 series) Tri-color HP No. </s>
<s> 78 (HP C6578 series) 5. </s>
<s> Clean the cradle contacts: a. </s>
<s> Position yourself at eye level with the printer. </s>
<s> b. </s>
<s> Locate the cradle that holds the ink cartridge. </s>
<s> c. Using clean, moistened swabs, wipe the underside of each wall of the carriage where fibers may collect and come in contact with the paper. </s>
<s> Repeat until no ink residue is seen on a clean swab. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> Clean the print cartridges: a. Grasp the top of the Black print cartridge. </s>
<s> b. </s>
<s> Wipe the copper-colored strip on the back of the cartridge with the dry cloth. </s>
<s> Use an upward motion, from the nozzle end to the top of the cartridge. </s>
<s> Wipe the contacts only once. </s>
<s> c. Dip a clean cotton swab into distilled water and squeeze the excess water from the swab. </s>
<s> d. Clean the face and edges of the inkjet print cartridge. </s>
<s> Do not wipe the nozzle plate. </s>
<s> CAUTION: Be careful not to touch the ink nozzles on the bottom of the cartridge or the copper contacts on the back of the print cartridge with the wet swab. </s>
<s> Touching these parts of the print cartridge can result in clogs, ink failure, or bad electrical connection. </s>
<s> e. Hold the print cartridge up to the light to inspect for fibers on the face and edges. </s>
<s> If fibers are still present, repeat steps (c) and (d). </s>
<s> f. Repeat steps (a) through (e) with the Tri-color print cartridge, using a clean, moistened cotton swab to avoid any contamination. </s>
<s> 7. </s>
<s> Reinstall the ink cartridges and ensure that the cartridge latch is in the &quot;lock&quot; position. </s>
<s> 8. </s>
<s> Close the printer's top cover. </s>
<s> 9. </s>
<s> Reconnect the power cord to the back of the printer. </s>
<s> This should resolve the issue. </s>
<s> Reply me with the result. </s>
<s> Arun. </s>
<s> Have the same situation on an HP 952C printer, magenta and black prints, nothing else. </s>
<s> New cartridge installed, same thing. </s>
<s> Tried everything Yadev suggested with no success. </s>
<s> Contacts on back of carriage and cartidge appear perfect. </s>
<s> Anything else? </s>
<s> I have the same problem on a hp 7755 - no yellow. </s>
<s> I have just changed the printer & cartridge and STILL have the problem ! </s>
<s> I reckon it must be the power supply as it's the only remaining common item. </s>
<s> I'm trying to source another one. </s>
<s> Try downloading the drivers for your printer off the HP site according to your OS. </s>
<s> If you use a Windows 98 driver for your Windows XP it may not function correctly. </s>
<s> I do suggest using a soft toothbrush and some alcohol, dip brush and gingerly brush the carriage contact area. </s>
<s> Wipe with a clean cloth or shop towel, leave no towel residue, repeat 2-3 times, allow to dry. </s>
<s> return ink cart, but you should wipe ink cart contacts as well. </s>
<s> test and check results. </s>
<s> best done with new ink cart. </s>
<s> If results are the same, possible bad carraige cable harness or electronics on logic(rare), in eiither case, the repair cost if no warranty will suggest buy new printer. </s>
<s> I thought any s/w issues if the test pattern HP uses fails. </s>
