&quot;I've re-formatted before and not had any problems, &quot; So you seen to have fixed it.
Or maybe not?
Be careful with what you write... As to drivers, many don't understand the driver issues.
In short, Microsoft doesn't do them all.
We get to do all the drivers when it doesn't work.
Seek out those motherboard drivers and when networking, don't install that firewall until you get the network up and working, then flip it on.
