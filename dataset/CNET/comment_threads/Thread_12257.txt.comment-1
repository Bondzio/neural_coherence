Hi, I am trying to decide between 2 PSU's.
I don't want to have to pay more than $200 for it.
I have found these two PSU's.
The PC C&C Silencer 750 Quad ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817703009 ) and the Rosewill RX950-S-B ATX ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817182096 ) I can get the Rosewill for a deal with the processor I am getting (the Intel Quad Core Q6600) for $120 where as the PC C&C PSU will be $170.
I want to be able to use it with my Quad core and two Nvidia 8800 GT video cards using and XFX nforce 680i motherboard ( http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8434385&type=product&id=1182557691186&ref=09&loc=01&srccode=cii_5766179&cpncode=09-44158805-2 )which one is better in the end and will meet my requirements and I would prefer that no one just tell me that the Rosewill is better since the wattage is higher on it.
I also should say that I noticed that the efficiency on the PC C&C is 83% and on the Rosewill it is 75%.
If you could reply ASAP that would be great since I am pressed for time.
Thanks, Chris
