Can this be considered normal? Thanks for any help - rjjp

Was the printer plugged into a power outlet first? If not, always plug external powered equipment into the power outlet before connecting it to the PC. The ground on the power plug will drain any static charge. Wayne Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach that person to use the Internet and they won't bother you for weeks.

Thanks for your suggestions Wayne, but the printer was already on when I plugged in the usb cable to the back of the PC and the power cable is earthed (theoretically there should be no static)- so Im still somewhat baffled.
