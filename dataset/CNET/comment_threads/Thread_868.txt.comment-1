I set up my network of 3 PC's today with a netgear switch, 2 crossover cables and one &quot;normal&quot; cat5 cable (the netgear switch auto detects cable used so works fine with crossovers etc).
Well the problem is PC1 can transfer files fine to PC2 (200megs takes maybe 2mins max to transfer), similarly PC2 can transfer fine to PC1.
however PC3 is having huge problems, it shows 137mins remaining for the same file!.
I'v tried copying files from PC 1 and PC2 but still having same problems, I have no idea as to what could be wrong.
I routed the cable thru the loft so was wondering maybe there is electrical interference if its next to a power cable, will double check that tomorow.
Does anyone have any ideas as to what could be wrong?, the same PC ran fine with a crossover cable with 2 PC's so i know its not the NIC, this situation has me totally confused!.
Any help much appreciated.
