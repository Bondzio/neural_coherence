<s> I had to reset my folders they were not set up the way I had them, (When I go to open any off my drives the search pannel comes up on the left) I use to open my drives and go to my items, how can I change that back to when I open the drives it will go to the items and so I do not have to seach for them. </s>

<s> All the rest off my main Folder or OK My Documents, My Network, control Pannel. </s>
<s> When I go to open one off the internal or external Drives even C drive it opens onother folder, instead off using The My computer folder to open one off the drives. </s>
