If you have the install CD, check to see if there a printable manual there.
For all intents and purposes, it really doesn't provide much other than pictures and basic install and info.
Just make a 1-page document that describes how to install, laminate it if you want.
HP may have a reference file on that model, check to see.
good luck -----Willy
