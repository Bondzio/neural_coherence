I am looking to get an external harddrive to store my photo's on. I am also going to be purchasing a MAC soon...That brings me to my quesiton...If I buy a hard drive and connect it to my PC and dump all of my pictures on it, will I be able to then connect it to my MAC (when I get it) without losing any of the pictures? or is it better to wait to get the hard drive and continue to store pictures on CD's for the time being?

Once you get the MAC and get the PICs moved, then take the PC HDD, put it in an external enclosure and use it as extra backup. You might also consider putting your important stuff on DVDs and store them offsite ... just in case. VAPCMD
