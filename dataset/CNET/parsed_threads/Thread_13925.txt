<s> Before my trusty roommate was shipped off to Iraq, I bought his router so now I have two exactly same routers, the Linksys WRT320N. </s>
<s> Both units are still using oem firmware. </s>
<s> I have been searching online to find out how I can use both in my network. </s>
<s> I would like to use one for G network at 2.4mhz and another for N at 5mhz. </s>
<s> The information I found online is very technical and for a noob like myself, little hard to follow. </s>
<s> Can anyone here give some pointers on how to set up my network? </s>
<s> I have been researching online for the past week or so and I am still confused... </s>
<s> The top posts about post 18 and 19 note how to do this. </s>
<s> This will not help those that can't configure the wifi portion of the router but it shows how to get both connected and working. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob! </s>
<s> Is this the link you are referring to in your post? </s>
<s> http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/965 If so then how many routers can I daisy chain in this manner? </s>
<s> Can I add a third router as a access point? </s>
<s> So, Linksys #1 N @ 5mhz Linksys #2 N @ 2.4mhz Airlink #3 G @ 2.4mhz Would this set up be possible without too much interference? </s>
<s> Or should I just drop the Airlink and focus on the two Linksys? </s>
<s> Thank you once again Bob..Looking forward to your reply.. </s>
<s> If our netmask is 255.255.255.0 we have some 254 devices we can assign addresses to. </s>
<s> We are at 253 possible more WAPs but then that would have no clients so my answer is 251 WAPs with one client. </s>
