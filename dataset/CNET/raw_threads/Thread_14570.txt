I have a 320GB 7200rpm SATA-HDD already running off SATA port #1 on my Mobo, and my DVD/CDRW running off of the single IDE channel. I have a 40GB 5300rpm IDE-HDD lying around and I was thinking of running it on the IDE port as master with the DVD as slave. The plan is, I was going to just use the 40GB drive for storage only , just for keeping stuff that sits on the faster drive taking up space (documents, images, etc). I've seen comments on a few other forums that if I do this, it could cause problems for normal operation, even though it's on the IDE channel instead of the SATA where the 'main' drive is. I realize that there would be problems if I'm using the DVD and the IDE-drive simultaneously, but I doubt that the situation would arise very often, if ever. The way that I envision it, the SATA and IDE are separate channels, and that there would be no conflict between the two of them. However, I may be wrong. Any thoughts? Cheers!

While, IMHO you really don't gain that much other more storage. What *may* happen and what becomes a problem is thre old HD will slow things down when accessed and/or become a bottleneck area if used alot. What you can do, if you like is mount it in an ext. USB case and use it that way. Robert also offered using the newer 80-connector IDE cable as well plus CS setting. Of course, once you set this up, you're &quot;real world&quot; usage will decide for you. tada -----Willy
