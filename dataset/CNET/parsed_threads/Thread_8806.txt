<s> I am running a P-IV, 1.6, 512 ram,92GHD's, Win XP Pro and dial up. </s>
<s> I just installed a stick of 256 memory, (identical to the first stick) and since doing that, my computer is quite a bit faster, (offline) but when I connect to the web, everything loads so much slower than when I only had 256 ram. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>

<s> Tools like EWDIO and HOUSECALL are free and may show what pest moved in. </s>

<s> Bob, I routinely run Spy-bot and Ad-aware on a weekly basis. </s>

<s> I am going to go ahead and run a scan using housecall and the other one and report back. </s>
<s> Thanks, Bill </s>
<s> Bob, I scanned the system using &quot;Housecall&quot;. </s>
<s> It found two cookies that my programs did not find, I deleted them and the system is working properly. </s>
<s> Thank you so much, Bill </s>
