A search of Western Digital show the following small drive available. wd400jd 40gb serial 150 ata wd800jd 80gb 3.0gb My current hard drive is the 3.0gb same as the 80gb. What is the performance of the 3.0gb as compared to the sata 150. Dollar wise the 80gb is a couple of dollars more and the extra storage is worth that much. I just don't understand what the 3.0gb is telling me. Once installed will I be able to format to fats32 using xp disk management. I've been using ME for a number of years and always formatted with fdisk so this will be new to me. Thanks for all the help in advanced. Ray

If you PC has the SATA connection I would suggest going with the 80GB drive since most SATA 2 drives are backwards compatible. As for the drive format NTFS is traditionally more stable then FAT32.

Another option would to be let the linux discs format the drive for you, so it's a native linux file format. Depending on the Linux you should still be able to setup a Dual Boot system

To trouble yourself with partitioning and formatting is wasted motion since the FAT32 partition will be unusable for Linux and you'll battle yourself as you learn more about Linux. You might even post a question why Linux won't install. Instead I'd boot my prospective Linux CD and take it's offer to install on the blank hard disk. Bob

Thanks Bob will install on 80gb and manually partition to 40gb and swap and the rest free space. Will use ext3 format from Dapper Drake. Thanks again to both of you for the reply Ray
