<s> I need to get an ac adapter for my LCD monitor, but I'm having problems finding a compatible one. </s>
<s> Here's the specs for the original adapter that comes with the monitor: Input: 100-240V, 50/60hz Output: 12V, 2.09A Anyways, my question is would I be able to use an adapter for a different peripheral if the output voltage and amps where higher than the original adapter? </s>
<s> I've been looking into universal notebook adapters that have variable output voltages from 15 to 24 volts, and also higher amp output. </s>
<s> Would one of these adapters work, or would the higher output cause damage? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> The device needs the exact voltage specified, but it will handle more current (power/amps). </s>
<s> The circuitry will shunt the excess power, but excess voltage will fry it. </s>
<s> Look at these from http://www.bgmicro.com They're two listed in 12v/3a range. </s>
<s> As for proper usage, you do need the right voltage period, the amps can be higher, but lets not get crazy. </s>
<s> I did mention those, they seem to fit what you need and are new and cheap but verify the connection barrel type. </s>
<s> part# PWR1207 and PWR1206 good luck -----Willy </s>
