you always run into clients that tell you how many fans are on the case or &quot;it's not heat.&quot; i don't see the video (could have missed it) but you see the 8800's and others failing now.
you asked about latency so let's read this from toms.
&quot;our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 lga 1155 core i5-2500k and a $1000 lga 2011 core i7-3960x, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved.
it turns out that memory bandwidth and pcie throughput don't hold back the performance of existing sandy bridge-based machines.
&quot;  since you have a nearly same cpu and it can drive three cards without much issue, your issue must be somewhere else.
if it's crashing, then you know to try the usual.
ask if you didn't know.
