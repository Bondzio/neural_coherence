at the office we are porting apps so i get to play with a lot of tablets.
we got to try the cheaps, that is the ones half the cost of a nexus and lower and always came away with issues.
now those that buy such have their reasons but for now i think the bottom end is the nexus and the rest is for folk that have a budget to meet.
that is, they have to compromise what they want to meet the budget.
the ipad with retina is great too.
and take another look at the kindles.
remember you didn't tell what use this is.
a rather poor and now poorer student thought it could stand in for a laptop!
ouch!
