you're going to want to run in an lcd's native resolution which sounds like 1680 x 1050. anything else will degrade the image quality.
you can always customize the settings to increase icon and font size.
as for the buzzing, that doesn't sound typical if it's coming from the monitor.
that might be a warranty issue.
if the noise is coming from your sound system, that might be correctable with shielding or cable placement.
