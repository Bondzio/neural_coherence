File sharring has worked in the past, however I am having trouble after some recent changes. Both computers are on the same network. I have installed LTTD on the Xp machine. When I view network map on my laptop, I am able to see my desktop connected on the network. When I go into network on my laptop however, I am not able to see the shared folders that I have on my Xp machine. Also to add, when I am running Azureus on my desktop, I am able to see a media folder under networks on the laptop. Any ideas as to why I cannot see my shared folders? Thank You

As to recent changes, I had done a system restore a few weeks ago, and since then have not been able to share files between the two.
