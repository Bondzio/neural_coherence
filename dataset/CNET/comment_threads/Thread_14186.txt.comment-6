I did Ghost but something isn't right.
First, I notice my 160 Gig HD has only 149 Gig available even after I formatted it.
Hate to lose 11 Gig to something unknown.
After formatting, I ran Ghost to copy my original C: drive and then disconnected the original C: drive and connected the new drive.
It went through the startup but only to the blue screen with the MS Windows XP logo and the light shine in the upper left corner.
I am using XP Home SP2.
I thought I could just add the new HD and make it my master and keep the other for backup, but I can't get it right yet.
Suggestions?
Thanks.
