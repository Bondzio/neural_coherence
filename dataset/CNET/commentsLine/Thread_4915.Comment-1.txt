my gateway has an onboard graphics chip.
i wanted to upgrade it so i bought an xfx 8600gt pci express nvideo card.
it worked for about 5 months, then it died.
i could still hook up the monitor to the onboard graphics chip and it worked.
next, i bought a sapphire 8650 pci express ati card.
it worked fine about 3 weeks and then it failed.
again i can still hook up the monitor to the onboard graphics chip, but of course its graphic capabilities are slow.
can my motherboard be frying graphic cards?
i am afraid to buy another one for fear it will fry after a couple of days.
i returned the xfx card under warranty and eventually they will send me another and i can try that one, but who knows how long that will last.
anybody has any ideas?
