I have always been a big fan of AMD.
Intel is just fine, but I prefer AMD because their processors tend to be cheaper, while still having excellent performance.
While I do not own an AMD-64 system, I have used many for gaming, and the systems deliver great performance.
I do own a P4 system as well, as I got a good deal on a processor/mobo combo.
However, I still think the AMD 64s I have used are a little bit more powerful.
I don't have much experience with graphics programs, but I have plenty of experience gaming.
I would say go with AMD for the lower price tag, but AMD also has some very fine high-end processors.
