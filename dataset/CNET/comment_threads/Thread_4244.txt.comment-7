I'm going to head over to Microcenter and purchase a USB enclosure, I have the HD in the freezer still so maybe I can fire it up again.
I would like to try and take the info from there and put it back on my hard drive.
I'm not too concerned with the drivers and what not, I replaced most of them using the back up cd but my documents, pics, and music are important.
When I was copying the data from the old hd, I couldn't find any specific folders that had &quot;my documents&quot; or &quot;my music etc.
And I had my win7 library set up with about 20 different subfolders as well but I guess I can kiss that all goodbye since I reinstalled the os after I replaced the hard drive.
Thank you for all of your help Steven, it is greatly appreciated.
