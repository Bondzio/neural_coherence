1.1.1	I think I may have a uinque little situation on my hands.	St
1.1.2	I have just received the airave from Sprint.	St
1.1.3	I received my airave, and set it up as per the instructions - modem&gt;airave&gt;router&gt;devices (and there are a lot).	St
1.1.4	This, inevitably, knocked my server out.	St
1.1.5	I've searched around, and I understand that I can hook the airave up behind the router through port forwarding.	St
1.1.6	This, however, is not an option.	St
1.1.7	My router allows me to forward 20 ports, all of which are required for my server.	St
1.1.8	Thus, I can forward the ports for the airave and put the airave behind the router.	St
1.1.9	I also have investigated the option of a switch or a hub, to 'split' the signal from the modem, and start two networks, one for the router (192.168.2.x) and the airave (192.168.17.x).	St
1.1.10	From this, I gather that it will not work.	St
1.1.11	One would need to be classed as the 'gateway to the internet' - and I will be essentially back to where I started, having spent money on a switch.	St
1.1.12	Thus, I need to find a solution.	St
1.1.13	I know that there is a firewall settings portion to the airave, to allow port forwarding and act as a virtual server.	St
1.1.14	I have fiddled with this, yet the default outgoing and ingoing port settings (block on schedule and block always) cannot be removed.	St
1.1.15	It is not allowing me to forward ports through the airave - so I can't get the server to communicate with the outside world.	St
1.1.16	So... suggestions?	St
1.1.17	Is there a way to work around all this?	St
1.2.1	Why so many networks.	St
1.2.2	When I setup a second router I configure it as a WAP.	St
1.2.3	And on page 4 of http://now.sprint.com/airave/files/AIRAVE2.5_Eng_Online_TTG.pdf?INTMKT=MKT:MS:20121004:AIR:MSU:EEE:TechTSEng25 I see you can put your server on that PC port.	St
1.2.4	Of course if this doesn't have a DMZ to put your server on, then you are indeed SOL.	St
