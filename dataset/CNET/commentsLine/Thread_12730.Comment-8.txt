if you do alot of large file transfers between the pc's on your wireless network go with g. if your just gonna use the internet with different computers b is the cost effective solution and you won't notice any difference anyways.
also, g is backwards compatible with b so you can mix-and-match the cheapest parts but you would be limited to b's transmission speed of 11mbps.
