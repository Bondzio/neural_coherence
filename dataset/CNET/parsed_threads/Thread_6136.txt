<s> I currently use a NetGear WGT624 108mb wireless router and associated PCI card. </s>
<s> I am using WPA-PSK network auth, and AES encryption. </s>
<s> My question is; with the Network SSID brodcast turned off, can any one using a scanner even see my network? </s>
<s> Thanks, ~jdk </s>
<s> New wifi hack tools now get the SSID just by listening to other packets. </s>
<s> Since some systems start &quot;dropping wifi&quot; when this is off, my advice is as noted in our forum note. </s>
<s> This is dated advice (turning SSID off) and it's time this information was updated. </s>

<s> Thank you Bob. </s>
