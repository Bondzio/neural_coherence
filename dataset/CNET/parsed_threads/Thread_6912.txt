<s> I have a Gateway laptop (Windows Vista) with a built-in wireless receiver. </s>
<s> I like to work outside (mall food court, park, sidewalk cafe, etc.) </s>
<s> and cannot always get a good signal from the nearby free wi-fi transmitters. </s>
<s> Could someone recommend an external antenna/receiver, that is plug and play via a USB connection, to help receive the weak signals? </s>
<s> Thanks, AC </s>

<s> its called best buy. </s>
<s> jsut go look. </s>
<s> there will be usb wireless adaptors in the computer section. </s>
<s> ask somebody. </s>
<s> and its alright the get the cheapest one, they all work more or less the same. </s>
<s> For my own sanity, I will ask a seemingly &quot;Wi-fi for Dummies&quot; question: Plugging in an &quot;Advanced Wireless USB Adapter&quot; like the Hawking Technology antenna or the Dynex Adapter will not conflict with the antenna already inside my laptop? </s>
<s> By conflict I mean the laptop deciding which antenna receiver to use. </s>
<s> I assume Windows Vista will give me the choice which to use... or can/will both antennas be used ? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I could use one or the other depending on my need... </s>
