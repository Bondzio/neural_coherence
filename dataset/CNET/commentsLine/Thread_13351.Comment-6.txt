you have a machine with on-board sound.
i suspect you have a machine that requires mobo drivers, w98 won't do this for you.
so...what you need to do is id the mobo and then visit the makers site and then look around for sound drivers.
while at the makers site you might want to look around for other drivers that support your mobo.
