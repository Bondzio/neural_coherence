I also use Epson printers (I have 5 of them) and was about to get a more professional level model.
I have read from some of the Amazon reviews that shipping back and forth directly to Epson is a hassle.
I was still considering buying directly from Epson, but after your email, I'll purchase it locally.
Thanks
