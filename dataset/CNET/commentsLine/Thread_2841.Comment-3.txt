i have to ask.....bob?
whats' with the decaf thing?
lol as for another optical drive, i'd definitely go with a faster optical drive for games and cd burning.
given the rock bottom prices, i'd recommend a 52x32x52 cd burner.
as for brand, lg is available just about everywhere, and are decently reliable.
if you wanted to go high end plextor is the way to go.
*note* be forewarned that dell machines are not the most optical drive friendly machines on the planet.
you may have to try different jumper configurations and switch the channels around unitl you find one that works.
dell's boards don't have the most rock solid bios' out there.
in addition, be prepared for the fact that in order to reduce costs, dell typically uses one ide cable to connect both the hard drive and optical drive to the same ide channel.
a performance no no, but in the world of mass production, the cost saving using only one cable by far out way any performance gains obtained by doing it properly and having the hard drive on it's own channel set as master either by jumper or cable select.
when you do do the upgrade, (you'll likely have to purchase an ide cable - make sure it's 80 pin)first attempt to configure the hard drive as the master on the primary ide, and the two opticals on the secong ide.
this will give you the best hard drive performance, but bear in mind it will impact your optical drive performance if you're one of those people who try to use both optical drives at the same time.
(i have no idea why people do that) as i stated previously, this might not work out so well on a dell board, so use whatever config that works.
really you'll never actually notice any performance differences with a optical drive on the primary channels unless you're trying to burn and do something else that transfers large amounts of data back and forth to the hard drive.
