i have been researching the sempron compared to other more expensive processors.
the only thing i found that sounded negative was that sempron only has 32-bit &quot;whatevers&quot; and they are not compatible to 64-bit.
this doesn't mean much to me because i don't understand.
can anyone explain what the reprocussions might be if i am not &quot;compatible&quot; with a 64-bit &quot;whatever&quot;:) lol!!
