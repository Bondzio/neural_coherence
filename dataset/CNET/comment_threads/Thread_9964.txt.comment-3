No this is my old original hard disk which I had brought along with my assembelled PC parts some 4 years back.
If you are suggesting, I should buy a new hard disk and see if this problem is solved with it; then that is not an option for me right now (financially).
Unless I am really sure that my current hard disk is dying and there is no other option for me but to buy a new one and backup all the data on it while the going is good for my previous hard disk, I can't buy a new one.
Any more ideas mate..
