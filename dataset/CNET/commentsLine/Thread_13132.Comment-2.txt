why didn't you fix those?
the issue/plague of bad caps was easy to find on google but you tell about ordering such but didn't share why you asked or posted here before you fixed that issue.
also, if the bad caps were not addressed early, they can destroy the board or boards in the device they are in.
bad caps (see google) are a plague in the industry but you know this (if you did the research.)
