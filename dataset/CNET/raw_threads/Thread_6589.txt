I need to buy an ext. storage device that can work with my WinXP PC and be written to on this public Mac running OS X. Please suggest a Brand and Model that will work for this, I am at a loss.

As to the PC and MAC issue, deeply discussed so while NTFS will give ME THE BEST results I wonder if a public mac is up to date to use that. FAT32 is an option but is not reliable for me. Bob

Thanks for the input, I'm still at a loss because I'd have to figure out this formatting issue on my PC, and I'm not sure that's possible from the research I've done. In response, the Mac is very new, it's some sort of a pro computer that I'm using FinalCutPro on, so not only do I need my hard drive for memory but also to use as scratch disk space. I'm not tech savvy at all, and I can't really try it out again because Office Depot told me that they made an exception, but there are no refunds on this item (just even exchanges). So, unless I buy something online someplace else and wait and pay for shipping, then O.D. is my only local option. Any additional input would be greatly appreciated. I wish I were better at this stuff... Marcy
