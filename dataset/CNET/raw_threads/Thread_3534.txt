If you don't have one, then How do you expect to browse the internet? If you are hoping, there are some wireless signal in your area.. then Think again.. you are in a military base... probably they banned all signal..

(Give it a name/SSID, enable WEP/WPA/WPA2 security, then your laptop will pick up the signal... enter the name and password required (you create this when you enable the security).. thats it...
