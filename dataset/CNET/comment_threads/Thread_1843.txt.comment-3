its hard to know for sure, but it sounds like your power supply may be the problem.
you can buy one comparable to what you have and install it yourself, just pay attention to everything you disconnect from the motherboard on its way out.
you're only talking about a couple of connections and securing the supply to the board.
its really fairly straightforward.
if it works, great.
if not, you've not spent much trying to salvage your system.
hope this helps.
