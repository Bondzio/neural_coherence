after three monthsof using the new version of yahoo email i experience freezing several times a day.
this version to me is still not bug-free!
i am back using yahoo classic with no freezing.
the last version of classic had more features than the one i am using now.
could you please assist me in getting back the last version of classic before the new version of yahoo email became available.
thanks.
p.s.
if i could transfer all my stored emails i would transfer them to google gmail.
any comments please.
