I have a HP XL759 desktop and it became obvious to me that I needed more RAM.
When my computer boots it loads three programs.
After it boots, I checked the System status and noted that only about 40% of the installed 256 MB memory was available (i.e., 60% was being used by the start up programs)....so I decided to double the memory.
I checked HP website for applicable RAM and then installed the recommendation of HP upto the max amount allowed by this PC (512 MB).
Once installed, I checked the System again upon booting up and the computer recognizes/sees the RAM....but it still says only about 40% of the installed 512 MB RAM is available...as if the computer can see the additional RAM but it isn't using it.
Any ideas on how to solve my problem?
Thanks...
