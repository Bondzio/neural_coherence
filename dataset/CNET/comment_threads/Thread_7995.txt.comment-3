I want to upgrade the mother board and the processor but I do not want to have to reinstall all of the software.
Can I swap the hard drive to the new mb & proc.
?
I have a full installation of XP Pro.
The mother boards are both Intel and the Processors are Intel.
Intel Duo to Intel Duo 2 If so, what chnages do I have to make to the registry?
