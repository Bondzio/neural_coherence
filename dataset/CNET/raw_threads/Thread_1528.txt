Well, when i was looking for the motherboards I ran across on a web-site that I dont have in front of me stating whats a good MB's for intel. They said that these 2 MB's are pretty good if you want to overclock your PC. ABIT LG-81 Socket T (LGA 775) Intel 945G Micro ATX Intel Motherboard-119.00 MSI 945P Neo-F Socket T (LGA 775) Intel 945P ATX Intel Motherboard-123.00 Both Support INTEL D

Not to say that Abit and the other aren't good boards, but when you get to dual-core you want something that has the best chipsets as well. That's why I use ASUS. Check them out. They have the largest selection I've seen yet. and life goes on... Jack
