<s> I have a Dell 4400 running Windows XP Home. </s>
<s> I presently have 256mb of memory. </s>
<s> I would like to upgrade and add 512mb. </s>
<s> It takes DDR PC2100 memory. </s>
<s> Dell says I should buy their memory for $100 but I can find the same memory specs for less than $50. </s>
<s> What gives? </s>
<s> Do I really have to spend the Dell price for an upgrade? </s>
<s> Anyone else done this successfully? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> you don't have to buy dell's however make sure the memory's correct by using www.crucial.com or www.kingston.com, or belarc.com. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> yes u do not need to buy from dell. </s>
<s> go crucial, kingston, corsair, pny or any other ram manufacturers website where u can use configurators, to determine the ram that fits ur system. </s>
<s> this is very important because if u buy the wrong ram, wont work and waste of money. </s>
