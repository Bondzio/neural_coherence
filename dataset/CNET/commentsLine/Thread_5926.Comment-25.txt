i'm pretty sure no partitions were created at all.
it's just a blue screen that says windows setup in the top left corner and the bottom just reads off all the files it loads and when it is done loading files it says starting windows setup... a couple seconds later i get the error screen.
i don't have anything of floppy.
also if i put something on floppy off of hitachi's website then i don't think i would be able to run that.
