1.1.1	Hi, newbie here.	St
1.1.2	My computer at home is about 10 years old and runs windows 98.	St
1.1.3	That should give you an idea of how out of touch anc clueless I am about this stuff.	St
1.1.4	I want to buy a new computer, primarily for games.	St
1.1.5	But, I would also like to be able to do some word processing on it and possibly network it to my work PC for file sharing.	St
1.1.6	I'm a lawyer so I have a lot of word document type files with all my notes in them that I would like ot be able to access from home.	St
1.1.7	But, my top priority is gaming I went to Dell's website and started looking but, I am so clueless I have no idea what is good, what is necessary, etc.	St
1.1.8	As far as a budget, I would like to keep it under $4000-$4500 and that includes all the peripheries as well like a nice monitor.	St
1.1.9	If I could do it for around $3000 that would be great, but the brief looking aroudn that I've done makes it seem like that won't be possible for a nice gaming pc.	St
1.1.10	I am mostly interested in playing FPS games and possibly giving WOW a try as well as some RTS.	St
1.1.11	So, does anyone have any recommendations?	Ques
1.1.12	Also, I looked on EBAy but that was even more confusing since I don't understand all the technical talk and I'm scared about buying something like a computer from a private vender in case it breaks down after purchase.	St
1.1.13	Any tips or ideas would be GREATLY appreicated from this noob	St
1.2.1	see this thread: http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6142_102-0.html?forumID=68&threadID=251181&messageID=2509439&tag=mcnt	St
1.3.1	thanks for the link, however I don't think it really helps me since that is a thread about gaming PC's under $1500.	Polite
1.3.2	I have a higher budget than that and don't mind spending more to get more.	St
1.3.3	I hear that Alienware is really good, but does anyone know if I can use their computers for other functions like wordprocessing, internet access, photo storage, etc?	St
1.4.1	To do top of the line gaming you need an Nvida 8800 Ultra.	St
1.4.2	But most any 8800 cards would be fine now days.	St
1.4.3	The more extrem PC building sites are: http://www.alienware.com/ http://www.voodoopc.com/eden.aspx But I would think even these are a little more then you need.	St
1.4.4	How much gameing are we talking about?	St
1.4.5	You probably better going through Dell and look at some of there XPS systems.	St
1.4.6	Even there two top of the line models http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/xps?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs are way more then I think you well need but they are top of the line gameing machines.	St
1.4.7	These you get two graphic cards to handle the games.	St
1.4.8	Unless you really think you need two graphic cards these are kind of an overkill.	St
1.5.1	but if you have a 10 year old pc now you can't be playing many modern FPS and RTS games and any new PC will significantly outpeform it.	St
1.5.2	so why would you want to spend $3K on a rig to play games that you've not seriously played before when a $1500 rig will play the games also?	Sug
1.5.3	and any pc, gamer or not, cheap or not, can handle your wordprocessing, internet, and photo needs.	Ques
1.5.4	boutique brands are for folks who either obsess over peformance ($500 upgrade for a 2% boost) or want to brag about their hardware (which will be superseded/obsoleted in 6 months).	St
1.5.5	if you want a good computer that can play games, here's a $1500 gateway with a very good video card: http://www.gateway.com/systems/product/529665346.php add a 22&quot; widescreen lcd for about $300 and you'll have a pc you'll be thrilled with.	St
1.6.1	At 3K you definitely could entertain a Mac Pro.	St
1.6.2	It runs not only Windows but 2 other major operating systems with ease and my next machine has to do this -&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr5YW9l2Yzw More at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9jNNeEd98 Bob	St
1.7.1	thanks for the replies.	Polite
1.7.2	I don't NEED an expensive PC, but I am such a noob that I just assumed that the more you spend the better the machine.	St
1.7.3	Also, I am worried that if I buy a less expensive PC it will be obsolete in a matter of months.	St
1.7.4	Yes, you are right, my 10 year old PC doesn't play any modern games.	St
1.7.5	In fact, the last game I even attempted to play on it was the original Half Life.	St
1.7.6	I haven't played a game on my PC in at least 8 years.	St
1.7.7	As far as building a PC, I have no idea how to and would be very wary of buying from a private vender.	St
1.7.8	As for the Dells, that is where I started, but from what I've read on this forum the Dells have TERRIBLE customer support.	St
1.7.9	Plus, we just got two new dells for our office and in less than a year one is already broken.	St
1.7.10	Also, I was looking at the high end Dells adn even those end up around $4000 when you are done adding things on and modifying them.	St
1.7.11	What about the Cyber Power Gamer Infinity Ultimate?	St
1.7.12	Its about $4000 and it won all sorts of awards from PC world and computer shopper.	St
1.7.13	Here is the link to the system http://www.cyberpowerpc.com/system/infultimate.aspv=d#configurator_top And no, I don't want a high end PC to brag.	St
1.7.14	I'm 37 years old and I don't know a single person that even games anymore so if anything I would be more inclined to hide the fact that I spent that much on a gaming computer	St
1.8.1	- Has laughable video hardware in terms of gaming.	St
1.8.2	You'll need to buy both a card for Windows AND OS X, negating any cost savings.	St
1.8.3	- Has laughable audio support in terms of gaming.	St
1.8.4	- Still is not rock solid under Windows.	St
1.9.1	I must have missed something.	St
1.9.2	Bob PS.	St
1.9.3	You seem to take shots at me a lot.	St
1.9.4	Remember that I can ask for a timeout if you don't behave.	St
1.10.1	I got the XPS 710 H2C, which has now been superceded by the 720, which is off your budget.	St
1.10.2	There are air-cooled versions for less but I wouldn't recommend them as they're BTX based.	St
1.10.3	If that doesn't worry you Dell's XPS support isn't bad, at least what I'm experiencing here.	St
1.10.4	There were definitely some hiccups with the XPS 700, the first of the 'slightly more extreme than Dell usually does' machines and I had some bad experienced with it, but even though the machine had problems the support was fine too.	St
1.10.5	I also have a Mac Pro which Profitt suggested but to me, in comparison to genuine gaming hardware it falls completely flat on it's face both in terms of architecture and hardware support, not to mention it's habit of overheating when pushed very hard as a gaming machine would (third-party solutions exist, but for God's sake this is supposed to be professional hardware).	St
1.10.6	Totally forget it for a games-centric machine.	Sug
1.10.7	Those who are using it as such are tying one hand behind their back and they don't even realise it in their Apple blindness.	St
1.10.8	A single 8800GTX is really more or less sufficient for most titles.	St
1.10.9	Quad-core is nice to have but most games wouldn't take full advantage of it.	St
1.10.10	Taking a brief look at Velocity Micro's site, I make it $3700ish for an X6800 CPU (3Ghz Dual Core, overclockable) machine with a single 8800GTX, 1.2Kw PSU for the option to add a second 8800 later, 2Gb, 2 x 320Gb HDD, X-Fi Xtremegamer card, Home Premium and 3 year warranty (1 year onsite).	St
1.10.11	That leaves $800 or so for a monitor, Dell's 24&quot; article should be fine.	St
1.10.12	Something like that would be what I would suggest.	St
1.11.1	NIL	St
1.12.1	BTX = dead motherboard layout format.	St
1.12.2	Actually better in many ways than the overwhelmingly popular (and what the Velocity Micro / Voodoo / etc would use) ATX format but it's ended up with zero third-party support.	St
1.12.3	Dell's XPS 700-series (including the latest 720) is based on BTX and it means you're reliant on Dell offering you a motherboard upgrade path as noone else supports it.	St
1.12.4	The 720 board can be fitted into the 710 and Dell will be offering it as an upgrade later this year, but beyond that who knows.	St
1.12.5	I bought into the 710 as I only intend to keep the machine for 2-3 years then I'll just give it to someone else, and also because I get a corporate discount.	St
1.12.6	I quite like Dell these days, they seem to be making an effort all round but I think if you want a flexible system in term of upgrades the XPS 7-series is not one to choose.	St
1.13.1	thanks, but I have some questions.	St
1.13.2	What is the XPS?	St
1.13.3	That's a Dell, right?	St
1.13.4	And are you saying that if I get a Dell I would be better with the 710 than the 720?	St
1.13.5	Also, you mentioned something about Velocity Micro?	St
1.13.6	I don't know anything about that brand, do they have a website?	St
1.13.7	Are they a good brand?	St
1.13.8	And the $3700 PC at Velocity, how much more would it be if I got two graphics cards and a 20&quot; LCD monitor?	St
1.13.9	I could see myself spending $5000 total for everything if push comes to shove.	St
1.13.10	Despite the amazing reviews, I've heard terrible things about Cyber Force which is kinda weird.	St
1.14.1	It kind of makes sense that the XPS would be a Dell Velocity Micro is a fairly well known name in this field.	St
1.14.2	Not as much as Voodoo or Alienware but many enthusiasts will be aware of it.	St
1.14.3	The Gamer's Edge PCX system which I priced up with the bits received a good review on HardOCP, which is known to be pretty independent and reviews in a way that's more representative of an owner than a benchmarker, a good thing: http://consumer.hardocp.com/article.html?art=MTIxNSwxLCxoY29uc3VtZXI= CNET gave very high marks to another system based around a pair of ATI graphics cards.	St
1.14.4	This looks like a good deal but I'm not familiar with the ATI cards so can't say anything from personal experience about how it might run.	St
1.14.5	http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/velocity-micro-raptor-dcx/4505-3118_7-32445621.html?tag=prod.txt.1 What you mentioned regarding the 20&quot; monitor, NVidia SLI or ATI Crossfire (dual graphics) and a 20&quot; monitor wouldn't make sense for a number of reasons.	St
1.14.6	First, SLI as opposed to Crossfire would be the more desirable in terms of being able to pair the fastest (NVidia) cards out there.	St
1.14.7	Second, SLI support in Vista is flaky at best at the moment so you might not get the full benefits right now, and you might even end up deactivating one card to run stably which will defeat the object of getting the second card.	St
1.14.8	This is a driver problem and will undoubtedly be solved later, and you can pick up a second card for less by then as well.	St
1.14.9	Lastly, SLI / Crossfire with the more powerful cards (which you'd be looking to get with that budget) only begins to take effect at higher resolutions and unless you're on a 24&quot; monitor or above, it wouldn't give you significantly better performance.	St
1.14.10	A 24&quot; monitor is a good basic starting point for a high-performance gaming rig, unless for some reason you're limited for desktop space.	St
1.14.11	It's also good in everyday use / working.	St
1.14.12	Reading your post though, it looks like you've come here doing zero research of your own.	St
1.14.13	I'd suggest doing that and reading some of the more hardcore games and enthusiast PC orientated forums like anandtech and hardforum as well.	Sug
1.14.14	Oh, and there's this amazing site called Google.com where you can look up stuff like &quot;Velocity Micro&quot;.	St
1.14.15	http://www.google.com/search?q=velocity+micro	St
1.15.1	...teenagery for you in terms of image (glowing blue lights, etc) you could visit Canada-based Suissa Computers for something that would be at home in a classic home office setting.	St
1.15.2	Be prepared to double your budget, but at least it would stand out.	St
1.15.3	http://suissacomputers.com/collection.htm	St
1.16.1	yeah, the dell question was pretty obvious.	St
1.16.2	But, you never answered my question regarding the difference between the 710 and the 720?	St
1.16.3	Also, you mention Vista being a problem with two graphic cards.	St
1.16.4	I was plannign on getting XPPro with whatever PC I got based on the horrible things I've heard about Vista..so would that solve the problem?	St
1.16.5	And thanks for the tip regarding the monitor.	Polite
1.16.6	I didn't know that it made a difference regarding 20 vs 24.	St
1.16.7	I sit about 2 feet from the screen so that is why I thought the 20 would be more than enough...but if you say it lacks in performance then I will start looking at 24s instead.	St
1.16.8	Also, the fact that I'm using XP Pro instead of Vista, does that make the performanc better on the 20&quot;?	St
1.16.9	And regarding the somewhat snide research comment, I've been doing research all week since I started this query...part of my research is asking questions on message boards, kinda like what I'm doing now.	St
1.16.10	But, I'm starting at square one since I know NOTHING about computers which is why I am hoping more experienced people like you could help me out.	St
1.16.11	I would rather hear about a computer from someone on a board than by going to their website.	St
1.16.12	Even reviews are tainted from what I hear based on the grear reviews for the Cyberpro vs the low opinion of them on the boards.	St
1.16.13	But, I do really appreciate the in depth help you are giving me...and if I gotta take a couple shots regarding my computer related intelligence, hey I can live with that as long as I get some solid answers	St
1.17.1	... answer it in the first post.	St
1.17.2	The 710 that's currently available is air-cooled.	St
1.17.3	The 720H2C is the direct replacement to the liquid/solid-state cooled 710H2C.	St
1.17.4	The 710 uses (H2C used) a slightly flawed NVidia board which lacked a lot of the stuff that overclockers and enthusiasts look for... the 720 is supposed to be better, but until they start the upgrade plan and I dust off my XPS 700's (which qualifies for a free motherboard upgrade and a CPU discount once the plan kicks in, the reason I didn't get rid of them) I won't know how good they are.	St
1.17.5	As I said, both are BTX so you're still dependent on Dell for upgrades beyond the current 720 motherboard.	St
1.17.6	Also as I said, for that reason unless you want the top-dog H2C for the best rig from a mainstream manufacturer *now* for immediate access to the performance, I don't think any lesser XPS is worth it.	St
1.17.7	I'm running the 710H2Cs in XP and they're for the most part very stable and I find any instability is caused by - no guesses required here - the NVidia drivers.	St
1.17.8	So if you get an XP rig, yeah I expect very little problems.	St
1.17.9	The SLI thing?	St
1.17.10	I may not have been crystal clear.	St
1.17.11	Card doubling with high-performance cards *only takes real effect at higher resolutions*.	St
1.17.12	Resolutions that 20&quot; monitors are not capable of displaying.	St
1.17.13	i.e.	St
1.17.14	with a 20&quot; monitor you're wasting the additional card.	St
1.17.15	It's not really an OS thing, but a card thing.	St
1.18.1	... if you're asking for it	St
1.19.1	thanks,I am finding this very helpful...and thanks for your patience with my ignorance as well.	Polite
1.19.2	I know it can be frustrating to have to dumb it down when explaining stuff and I recognize that.	St
1.19.3	Thanks.	St
1.19.4	Couple follow up questions.	Sug
1.19.5	What is overclocking?	St
1.19.6	I've seen that term pop up over and over again so I figure I should probably know what it means.	St
1.19.7	If I'm reading your post right, it sounds like the 710 is limited in performance due to the nvidia board.	St
1.19.8	If that's the case, I guess I should only look at 720's.	St
1.19.9	What is BTX?	St
1.19.10	And our upgrades that important?	St
1.19.11	How often would I need to upgrade and would I be able to get someone out to my house to do it or do I need to send it in to Dell for that?	St
1.19.12	I was hoping the computer could last me at least 2-3 years without becoming technologically irrelevant.	St
1.19.13	Is that a reasonable hope?	St
1.19.14	Thanks for the clarification on the 20 vs 24&quot; debate.	St
1.19.15	That makes total sense to me and I'll definitely be looking at the 24's from now on.	St
1.19.16	I'm gonna price out a 720 XPS later today and see how much it is.	St
1.19.17	Do you recommend changing any of the default settings on the rig?	St
1.19.18	Like, do I need more memory, etc?	St
1.19.19	I always see like five choices and some are only a few dollars more so I always try to upgrade just cause I don't know any better and just assume that more $$$ must = a better rig.	St
1.19.20	Are alot of those upgrades completely useless and only thrown in there to take advantage of ignorant shoppers like me or do I really need them for optimal performance?	St
1.20.1	Google for overclocking.	St
1.20.2	I'm just pointing it out, like.	St
1.20.3	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overclocking BTX - I explained it a few posts back.	St
1.20.4	It is not a big deal if you're going to stay with the motherboard for the duration of your ownership of the machine, and you don't plan to make major changes to the hardware.	St
1.20.5	The 710 is indeed limited in terms of memory choice, overclocking choice, etc.	St
1.20.6	The 720 board is expected to be better but as I said, I don't have it yet so I can't say anything about it.	St
1.20.7	If you're going with Windows XP with the $5999 system and you're happy with the included 24&quot; monitor, then no need to change anything but the storage, physics coprocessor and accessories.	St
1.20.8	You will probably want more hard disk space and I'd suggest the 320Gb Performance RAID0 + 750Gb.	St
1.20.9	And you might decide you don't need the Blu-ray (GOOGLE IT) drive but just go for the regular twin DVD drives.	St
1.20.10	I'd say skip the Physx card ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_processing_unit ) but you may want it depending on the games you want to play.	St
1.20.11	With XP, you can stay with 2Gb of RAM.	St
1.20.12	I'd get the 3 or 4-year in-home protection.	St
1.21.1	thanks again, can't say that enough.	Polite
1.21.2	I'm definitely starting to narrow my search.	St
1.21.3	Do you know anything good or bad about Velocity Micro?	St
1.21.4	And how about Gateway vs Dell?	St
1.21.5	I've already nixed Cyberpro from consideration as well as Alienware.	St
1.21.6	Falcon Northwest I hear is way overpriced and the same goes for Voodoo so those might be out.	St
1.21.7	I'm really disturbed by the great reviews I see online for cyberpower.	St
1.21.8	Considering all the HORRIFIC things I read on the forums about this company it really makes me question the objectivity and ulterior motives of established review sites like PC World and several others that are giving this company GREAT reviews.	St
1.21.9	Now I don't know if I can believe ANY reviews I read.	St
1.22.1	I can't give you advice beyond my personal circumstances.	Polite
1.22.2	My business - which is basically me - spends a lot on the big three, Dell, HP and Apple.	St
1.22.3	So if one of these guys offers something akin to what I want, it makes more sense for me to buy this than an offering from a boutique builder.	St
1.22.4	Neither of my HP or Dell account managers knew much about Voodoo (owned by HP) or Alienware (owned by Dell) and both of them indicated that I would have to deal with them separately... so no corporate discount.	St
1.22.5	For that reason for me the H2C (and all the XPS's before it) were really a no-brainer as home PC's.	St
1.22.6	If on-site support and the likes of Dell's backup aren't on the cards then I'd actually prefer to build my own, or at least collar someone on the harder-core forums to do it.	St
1.22.7	I don't know Gateways.	St
1.22.8	Velocity looks very good from what I've read so far and always reasonably priced, which is why I thought of them when you mentioned your $4K all-inclusive budget (about the middle of the road in terms of 'ultimates').	St
1.22.9	Anyone who concentrates on performance, build quality *and* value has to be applauded, but I've never bought a PC from them.	St
1.22.10	I have used / poked around inside a Voodoo Omen, and although it's not my style in terms of the cosmetic casework I would say it showed the sort of attention to detail which I rarely see anywhere else.	St
1.22.11	You get the best of an enthusiast PC, but at the same time you get workstation-grade reliability for the most part - and if it fails to deliver you've got one company to go back and complain to.	St
1.22.12	You are paying over the odds, but really you can't call these overpriced.	St
1.22.13	Those who do and who write 'reviews' on sites like CNET of things they don't own are the same sort of guys who poke fun at Ferrari owners from their turbocharged Civics.	St
1.22.14	Theirs might on a good day go nearly as fast, but it's not the same and the laugh's really on them for not knowing the difference.	St
1.22.15	So I'd take the forum comments (including mine of course...	St
1.22.16	I could be a Voodoo shill!	St
1.22.17	:p) with a pinch of salt.	St
1.22.18	You don't always get more for your money, and the more you pay the more you come up against diminishing returns.	St
1.22.19	You may also not appreciate some of the things that money is spent on in the upper-end rigs (custom paint jobs for example).	St
1.22.20	But if you can afford it and you want it,the high-end rigs do reliably deliver the performance and present the image that only the most competent amateur-built PC's can - at great cost in time for said amateur.	St
1.22.21	And more importantly for some perhaps, all of these boutique machines have a service and support backup that a self-built doesn't.	St
1.22.22	So it's up to you, the performance you think you'll really need and your wallet... or do it all yourself.	St
1.22.23	However, given my interpretation of your situation I would take a serious look at the two velocity Micro systems I pointed to.	St
1.22.24	What I think you'd want is a midrange dual-card / one high-end card, air-cooled machine with decent storage.	St
1.22.25	And that's what the systems I pointed to can deliver.	St
1.22.26	Hope you get what you want.	St
1.23.1	I think the below configuration for a gaming sustem will meet your needs very nicely.	St
1.23.2	From reading the threads I can suggest a few changes.	St
1.23.3	Upgrade Microsoft works 8.5 to microsoft small Business or professional(add about $150-250 to cost).	St
1.23.4	You don't need the netgear wireless(I use it for home networking-multiple computers--substract about $50 from cost).	St
1.23.5	Pick up a monitor (about $300 - 400)and a new keyboard & mouse (about $100 - 200).	St
