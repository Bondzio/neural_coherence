My question is: I cant tell which of the disks in my computer is the new one. I bought the hard drive at a local computer store and it didnt come with any instructions or docs at all. It shows disk:C, D, G,and H. The C i know isnt it. and the D-i think it is a &quot;partition&quot;(not really sure). (my cd & dvd is E,F) i need to format the new one(i guess) How on earth do i find my new one? and no, i cant get any help from the place where i bought it-he is not very helpful. Thanks, Lizzie

What is the model name of the HD? What is your operating system (and service pack)? Click: Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Computer Management Double-Click: Storage &gt; Disk Management From there you can rt-click any HD and initialize, partition, and format it.

Like 'Linkit' suggested ...get to 'Disk Management' do a right click on one of the CDs....and change the drive letter to say &quot;R&quot;. Then do the same to the other CD...make it &quot;S&quot;. Shut down the PC and disconnect the new HDD. Then reboot the PC to to see how the drive letters show up....you should have a &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot; plus an &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot;. If this is the drive line up ....open explorer and right click on &quot;C&quot; on type in a name for &quot;C&quot; in the label box. Do the same for &quot;D&quot;. Now shut down again and reconnect the new HDD..and see what shows up as other than &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot; or &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot;. Then you should be able to identify the new HDD and prepare (partition and format) it for use with your system. Keep us posted VAPCMD Note: The reason I suggest changing the CD-ROM drive letters to R and S is to avoid the confusion that develops when you add a new hard drive or hard drives to the system... HDD takes precedence over the CDs in drive letter assignments...leaving unused drive letters beteween the hard drive(s) and the CD-ROM eliminates the CD-ROM drive letters from being bumped/changed in the future.

Go to the Windows &quot;Start&quot;... &quot;Control Panel&quot; &quot;Admin Tools &quot;Computer Management&quot; &quot;Disk Management&quot; Do a right (mouse) click on one of the CDs....and select change the drive letter to say &quot;R&quot;. Then do the same to the other CD...make it drive &quot;S&quot;. Shut down the PC (uplug it from AC power) and disconnect power or data data cable from NEW HDD. Then reboot the PC to to see how the drive letters show up....you should have a &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot; plus an &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot;. If this is the drive line up ....open explorer and right click on &quot;C&quot; on type in a name for &quot;C&quot; in the &quot;Label Box&quot;. If present do the same for &quot;D&quot;. Now shut down again (unplug from AC power) and reconnect the new HDD..and see what DRIVES shows up other than &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot; or &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot;. Then you should be able to identify the new HDD and prepare (partition and format) it for use with your system.
