Here's a link to it: http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2365881,00.asp The article goes at the question from the angle of how much scanner one needs.
Of course, how much printing one does, what kind of printing one does, and whether or not one needs to do that printing in color would also be relevant considerations.
Laser toner cost/page vs. inkjet cartridge cost/page would also be worth considering.
For example, OEM Samsung toner cartridges for my current laser printer run about $80, and are rated for 3,000 pages each.
(Those seem very expensive, though, so I've been buying generic compatible toner cartridges on eBay for approx.
$30 each including shipping -- but I'd prefer house brand toner cartridges from an office supply chain, if anyone made them for the Samsung.)
How much would inkjet cartridges for that many pages cost?
(I'm guessing they'd be more expensive, but let's assume a best-case scenario of a MFP brand which already has cheap name-brand regular (&amp; high-yield, where available) ink cartridges and/or widely-available even cheaper house-brand or generic compatible ink cartridges, plus separate cyan/magenta/yellow cartridges instead of a single multicolor cartridge (in addition to the black cartridge).)
