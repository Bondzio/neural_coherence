stock or default setting will do fine.
like i mentioned, if you experiment, just find a stable and sustainable level that everything seems to work, ok. stock setting are also called the &quot;default&quot; setting, though you may need to tweak abit for some device if required and that becomes your &quot;norm&quot;.
don't get to caught-up in bios setting, they are pretty straight-forward and make sense once you get in under your belt.
your manual or download one from the system or mtrbd.
support website usually give details on bios settings.
