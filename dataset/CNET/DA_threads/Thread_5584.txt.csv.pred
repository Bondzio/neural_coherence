1.1.1	On my current machine I have two 500gig SATA hard drives both in working condition, one running windows 7 and the other used for storage.	St
1.1.2	Now I also have an 80gig IDE hard drive running Ubuntu; which I have from my old machine.	St
1.1.3	The 80gig IDE ran perfectly with a different SATA hard drive in the old machine (all I had to do was switch the boot order to use either Ubuntu on the 80gig IDE or Windows 7 on the old SATA hard drive).	St
1.1.4	I just recently tried bringing the 80gig IDE drive over to my new computer but it doesn't seem to be working.	St
1.1.5	The Bios recognizes it as a 2500mb drive for some absurd reason.	St
1.1.6	Any Ideas on how to get this to work?	St
1.1.7	Additional Info: Mother Board: Asus A8-NE Jumper settings for the IDE drive: CS	St
1.2.1	Some Asus boards, and probably many others, have hard drive controllers that are either/or but not both SATA and IDE.	St
1.2.2	I've seen this mainly if a RAID configuration is possible.	St
1.2.3	If you select to use SATA, the corresponding IDE ports become unusable.	St
1.2.4	Check your manual to see if this is the case.	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the suggestion I double checked the manual and it appears I should be able to run both SATA and IDE concurrently.	St
1.3.2	While browsing the manual I came across this, &quot;If the hard disk was already formatted on a previous system, the setup BIOS may detect incorrect parameters.	St
1.3.3	Select [Manual] to manually enter the IDE hard disk drive parameters.&quot; After looking up the parameters for the hard drive, I tried to manually enter the IDE hard disk drive parameters; however, I was not able to do so.	St
1.3.4	The Sectors, Heads, and Cylinders all had adjustable values but when I set them to the proper values and hit enter, they just reset to the incorrect values.	St
1.3.5	Any other suggestions?	St
1.3.6	Thanks	Polite
