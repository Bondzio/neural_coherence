i appreciate the info.
however, i'll have to look into what an ultrabook is.
also, i'm thinking of waiting for windows 8. i've read that some win 8 tablets might go on sale in the third quarter of this year.
taoskier (otherwise known as bill) ps--office mobile is just a scaled down version of office that came w/my last three hp pdas.
however, hp appers to be turning their attention to phones.
i thought my first non wifi pda was great, the second even better (with wifi), but the third had little memory or power and, as i see it, it was almost obsolete on arrival.
