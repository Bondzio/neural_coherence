<s> I have a plextor PX-712a I have two dvd roms which do not run most of the time. </s>
<s> When i insert them the LED starts blinking and shows orange light. </s>
<s> But after some time when i insert the disc again it works fine. </s>
<s> At first I thought that this problem might be due to scratches on the disc but there are very few scratches on the disc surface which normaly should not cause the problem. </s>
<s> Is the problem due to bad quality of the disc. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Awais Rauf. </s>
<s> Hi. </s>
<s> difficult to tell what could be wrong If it was not only a problem in two disks I would think it could be a dusty lens. </s>
<s> Have you tried burning copies of the disks when you get them to run? </s>
<s> good luck Srewart </s>
