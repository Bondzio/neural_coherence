But it all comes down to amps per rail and we have to get very technical.
And to head off any question, YOU get to find the numbers.
That said I am running an old AGP HIS (another maker) ATI 3650 512MB on a 230 Watt PSU.
The entire box averages 140 Watts on a Watt meter so I'm just there.
I don't suggest anyone exceed the 50% mark.
