<s> I mistakenly fouled up my broadband connection on my home wireless network when I was trying to clear some space to install Norton Systemworks Go Back. </s>
<s> When I reinstalled the software, it said that I should not have the network card attached to the computer during installation. </s>
<s> I dutifully disconnected the unit. </s>
<s> When it got to the place where it says to connect to a powered USB port, it did nothing when I plugged it in to the USB port on my USB hub, the port from whence it came originally. </s>
<s> I then tried plugging it in to the one free usb port on the computer. </s>
<s> The whole computer shut down. </s>
<s> Instantly, like I'd pulled the plug. </s>
<s> I checked that everything was plugged in properly, started over, and the same thing happened when I plugged into the computer's USB port. </s>
<s> It all worked ok yesterday. </s>
<s> SPECS: Gateway desktop (Bought in 2000. </s>
<s> Several hardware upgrades since then,including DVD drive and 80 gig second hard drive.) </s>
<s> XP professional OS The wireless network is MSN. </s>
<s> Base unit is on my son's Dell, which is tne newest computer in the household. </s>
<s> Any help would be much appreciated. </s>
<s> I tried reaching Gateway's tech chat, but it throws me back to the desktop when I try to connect. </s>
<s> (From my son's computer,not the one with the problem, natch). </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Apparently whatever you are connecting to the POWERED USB port [it the powered port is mandatory], is something that draws considerable current from ther 5 volts. </s>
<s> If you connected the device to the powered hub, but DID NOT have the hub power adapter plugged in, the device may have drawn too much current from the 5 volt USB connection within the computer. </s>
<s> This may have caused the computer shutdown. </s>
<s> The amount of current required for the device certainly shouldn't be too much for the main 5 volts from the Power supply, however, the computer's USB circuits may have built in protection to prevent getting burned out by overload. </s>
<s> [of course, it is possible that the device has failed and is shorted] This is simply a WAG, because I see that no else has answered for quite a while, although on summer weekend days many people that normally reply are enjoying something else. </s>
<s> I am not absolutely sure what device was being connected. </s>
<s> Possibly a little more precise explanation of what you were doing step by step would clarify it further. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Try powering off the computer, then plug in the device and restart. </s>
<s> My computer sometimes complains when I plug in with the machine on. </s>
