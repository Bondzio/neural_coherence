back in high school, i remember that when ever we worked on a pc in electronics class we use a static discharge wrist strap.
also my teacher would have us ground the machine to the electrical outlet ground.
he took old pc power cords and removed the positive and negative prongs.
all the while leaving the ground prong alone.
we also connect the wrist strap to the pc power supply.
that way if we remove the power supply from the pc we will stay grounded.
