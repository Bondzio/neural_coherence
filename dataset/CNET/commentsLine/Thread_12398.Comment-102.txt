we have had all the problems you refer to and then some.
the worst problem, and the reason we are returning the unit, is that the color match is not even close.
i have spent considerable time and countless wasted copies with tech support trying to resolve this issue.
they thought that the ink amy be bad and had me run hundreds of copies through the machine to make sure that all the ink was used before putting in new ink blocks.
that did not work.
it is worse when going direct from computer than from the glass.
xerox installed this copier free of charge and &quot;just&quot; charges us for meter clicks.
as it takes about 10 copies to get a job running if it runs at all, this is a very costly &quot;free&quot; copier.
i don't understand their marketing strategy here as we will be replacing it with a copier purchased in the normal way, but it certainly won't be xerox,
