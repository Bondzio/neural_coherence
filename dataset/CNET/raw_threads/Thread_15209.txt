At the moment, my HP Pavilion a1020n desktop, running on XP SP2, will not even initiate startup. I have disconnected all cables and reconnected the power cord. When I do this, a green light on the back of the tower comes on indicating that power is being received to the unit. However, when I depress the start button, nothing happens except the green light goes out. No attempts to start up, no fan, nothing. If I depress the start button for about 5 seconds, the green light on then back comes back on, but that's it. During the night, there was some sort of power surge. The computer was plugged into a power strip. All other periferals are working fine. I am not sure if there was a surge in the area/house or if something within the computer created the surge. I did call HP and they had me reseat the RAM. This produced no results. They then told me if I sent the tower to them, they could repair it for $250-300, plus shipping. I don't think so. I know that you all can help me out and greatly appreciate it.

Keep in mind that the green light on the back of the computer comes on but it simply will not do anything when I depress the start button. I do find it interesting that the surge protector seemed to protect everything but the computer, unless the computer initiated the surge. At which point I am surprised that surge went throughout the house. BTW, there were no lightening storms, etc.

If i was in your postion i would try a new PSU if that does'nt work then there could be to much to troubleshooting so i would just send it to HP. Also if they said to try the memory also try to the video card. If you have a PCI, AGP, PCI express remove it and use the on-board. If you are using the on-board see if you can get a cheap video card and try it. -sai

I am very surprised that issues as seemingly unrelated as a video card can prevent the computer from even turning on. While events suchs as this cause great concern for me, I also learn so much more about computers, primarily due to the advice on this board.

Most likely it is the CPU or it could be your PSU check the temp. that your computer is running at in the BIOS if it's running hot try cleaning out the fans (Really your PSU fan).
