I stopped using IE some time ago as I found other browsers to be quicker. But some downloads will automatically open IE when they are trying to install them selves. then the fun begins!!!! It begins by opening a single page that opens for a few seconds then closes then opens and closes again. Then 2 pages will do the same independent of each other, then 3, then more and more until my screen is a mass of IE pages open and closing randomly and I have no option but to close down and reboot. I have tried all sorts of remedies as follows: - I have tried uninstalling IE but the same thing happens with IE7 I have checked on the Microsoft web site and they suggested running their online antivirus and anti spy scans which has done nothing. I have tried numerous other anti spyware, antivirus and general utility programs which do nothing. I have run out of ideas can any body help?????? Neil Liverpool England
