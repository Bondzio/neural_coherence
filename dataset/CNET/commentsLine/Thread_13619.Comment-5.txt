verdict (according to the specifications): the asus comes out on top in my opinion.
*they are both equally matched on the core spec side.
these are the minor differences.
* gaming friendly asus viewsonic yes no display type asus viewsonic lcd led screen surface asus viewsonic glossy matte vertical refresh rate asus viewsonic 76hz 75hz inputs asus viewsonic dvi dvi hdmi vga vga thats all i can gather.
if anyone can debate my choice/verdict.
please do.
i'm open to question.
