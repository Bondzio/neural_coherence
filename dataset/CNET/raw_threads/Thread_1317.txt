Well, when I go into Control Panel, System, Hardware, Drives, I can find it. But I can't find it in Windows Explorer. It looks like this Vaio already has 2 hard drives, but they must be in a RAID setup. What do I need to do to get this new drive recognized? I recently upgraded from XP Pro to Vista Home Premium.
