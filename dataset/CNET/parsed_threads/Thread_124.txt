<s> Hey everyone: My cooling fan is starting to die. </s>
<s> On starting the computer the fan vibrates hard (up & down grinding tone (as in a bearing going out)) for 2 to 3 minutes. </s>
<s> The 875P chip is on a gigabyte GA-81875 with a 478 socket. </s>
<s> After the initial warm up time the sound goes away and it runs smooth from then on. </s>
<s> Does anyone know where to purchase just a replacement fan? </s>
<s> It seems if you want the fan you have to buy the mother board but then it's older so a new board then a new CPU $$$$$. </s>
<s> Thanks Craig </s>
<s> http://www.1coolpc.com/ has many small fans. </s>
<s> Click on the chipset link. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> Yes, I've bought from them. </s>
<s> Thanks Bob, I 'll go see what they have. </s>
<s> Craig </s>
<s> I confess ...I've bought there too. </s>
<s> Looked around and then looked some more, hoping for the right fan. </s>
<s> The have them for everything else, just not for the 875P chip itself. </s>
<s> Thanks, I need to keep digging, any other thoughts? </s>
<s> Can the fan even be replaced? </s>
<s> Thanks again Craig </s>
<s> a specific heatsink fan solution for the i875 but you should be able to find a replacement fan that's dying. </s>
<s> In some cases folks are buying and installing better bigger, better heatsinks .. made by Zalman, and using no fans. </s>
<s> I've had to use close enough then use epoxy or other means to replace a few. </s>
<s> But the link I supplied sufficed for them all. </s>
<s> jameco.com has some fans too, but it will take awhile to dig there. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ya know, it finally hit me that the cooling fan is NOT an exotic piece of precision equipment inside the PC but just cooling that can be adapted to ones needs. </s>
<s> Thank You All... </s>
<s> NIL </s>
