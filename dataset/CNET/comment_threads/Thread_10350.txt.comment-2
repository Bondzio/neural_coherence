Do a printer &quot;self-test&quot;, review your manual or help guide on how that's done with your model printer.
If it can't print a self-test page, then likely the printer is hosed.
Check to see that the ink carts are firmly seated and/or if any blinking leds are present on the printer.
Until, you do a self-test don't mess with windows at all, you may cause further problems.
Also, the support website at HP should explain common problems and resolutions.
You can aslo try the printer's &quot;toolbox&quot; if applicable for your model, it should provide some insight and maybe a self-test as well.
good luck -----Willy
