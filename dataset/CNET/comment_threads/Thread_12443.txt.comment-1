Hey guys, was hoping I could get soem advice on the parts I picked up and why I should or shouldn't get what I've chosen.
My main gripe is to not get something that is incompatible and have to deal with sending it back out.
I also wanted to buy a soundcard under $100 but to stay under $1600 total.
Aaaand i'm looking for a nice sound system with at least 5.1 surround for around $200.
