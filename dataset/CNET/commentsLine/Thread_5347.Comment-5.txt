the picture(s) seem to be of the wireless antenna.
if it is possible for you to do, hardwire to the router via an ethernet cable, this would be a much more efficient hook up than wifi.
as far as printers or peripheral devices, proximity and impediments (walls doors etc.)
can play a major role in defeating wifi signal.
bluetooth is an entirely different ball game, generally requiring a bluetooth dongle, not the same as wifi.
