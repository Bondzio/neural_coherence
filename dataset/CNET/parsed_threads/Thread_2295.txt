<s> I have an hp8000 something(vauge I know, I'm at work sorry) laptop. </s>
<s> It has an 80GB hard drive in it. </s>
<s> I have been trying to burn bigger image files and things on to dvds and cds but I still feel unconfortable with how full my hard drive is becoming. </s>
<s> This also means I feel uneasy about loading more programs and things on to an already fullish laptop. </s>
<s> Ideally I would like to run atleast games off of an exteral hard drive and some programs. </s>
<s> I would also like to store all of my music on it. </s>
<s> (and ofcourse back lots of other things up) Is it possible to run things like this off of it, or am I simply asking to much of an external hard drive? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help in advance. </s>
