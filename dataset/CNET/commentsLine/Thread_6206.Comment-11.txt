you are so late to the party :p i've been using it since i posted that i had it installed.
i don't have very high graphical demands, just that i can run everything with some decency.
mass effect/dragon age are both wonderfully smooth, and even moderate graphic hogging games like tropico 3 are fine.
portal 2/fallout 3/new vegas/oblivion all run like a dream.
even f.e.a.r.
manages to be smooth on the card... just about :p so in regards to the cards performance, it works fine.
now the above isn't with everything maxed, i generally avoid v-sync/aa to pump the max out of shadows/textures.
if i were doing it again, i'd probably shoot for an nvidia card honestly.
not because the ati card isn't great... it's quiet and does everything wonderfully.
but due to nvidia's &quot;the way it's meant to be played&quot; campaign, a lot of games run better on nvidia cards than ati cards.
an example would be borderlands.
your ati card would need to be twice as good as an nvidia card, just to be comparable graphically.
mind you, i haven't found any other game as bad as that and nvidia cards generally need a lot more power.
and i am not upgrading my power supply :p so, in summary, yes the card is good.
buy one.
they work.
even on terrible power supplies like mine.
tl;dr: read the tiny paragraph above this.
