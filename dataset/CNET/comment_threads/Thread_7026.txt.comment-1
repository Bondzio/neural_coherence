Winxp SP3, RAM 2GB,HD 160GB When I first time put my memory stick of my Camcorder into the slot of the case of my computer it jolly well recognizes it and the contents get displayed very well.
I use 'safely remove hardware' icon and then remove the stick from the slot.
Now supposing I want to use the memory stick again the slot does not recognize it.
I have to reboot the PC and then it gets recognized.
This cycle ---remove reboot -- remains the only solution to me at the moment.
This is true for all the memory sticks I do have here.
Kindly guide if this problem could be solved?
Thanks in advance.
