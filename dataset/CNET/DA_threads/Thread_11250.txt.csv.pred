1.1.1	Is there anyway to share a printer when one computer is dialed into a VPN network and the other one is not ( Outside of swapping the USB cable back and forth ) .	St
1.1.2	I have a work computer and a personal computer at home that share the monitor/keyboard/mouse and would also like it if they could share the printer .	St
1.1.3	Both systems run Win XP pro and access the internet via a netgear router ( wireless but both are hardwired ) .	St
1.1.4	My work computer has wireless but my personal does not .	St
1.1.5	If I added a print server could my work computer access it via wireless ( while still on VPN ) while my personal used USB ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks for any help .	St
1.2.1	If you allowed such , VPN would have a security hole .	St
1.2.2	Think it over and over and over and you 'll understand why a VPN drops other network connections .	St
1.2.3	But you can plug the printer directly to the VPN 'd machine and print .	St
1.2.4	Nothing broken ... Bob	St
1.3.1	What about a USB hub , splitter , or something so that I could plug both computers into 1 printer ?	Ques
1.3.2	Thanks for the help .	St
1.4.1	Such USB sharing ports , splitters and such cost just as much as some printers .	St
1.4.2	Try justifying this with a little math .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	A bluetooth printer .	St
1.5.2	Sadly this is not cheap .	St
1.5.3	Could be more than another printer .	St
1.6.1	How would bluetooth be any different then adding on a wireless print server ?	Ques
1.6.2	Not that money is no object but for the convenience I would n't have a problem spending $ 100 .	St
1.7.1	As such , VPN would not block its use .	St
1.7.2	Bob	St
1.8.1	Found a USB share switch that pretty much does the trick .	St
1.8.2	Allows you to connect 1 device to several PC 's .	St
1.8.3	Does not switch automatically when needed but provides a hot key that makes it pretty easy .	St
1.9.1	If you have two computers running Win XP pro on the same Router , all you need to do is enable file/print sharing on both computers ( Use the Network Setup Wizard ) and as long as the computer with the printer on it is on , the other will have access to it .	St
1.10.1	That would work if I was not connected to my VPN .	St
1.10.2	That 's why I started this thread .	St
1.10.3	Without the VPN its easy .	St
