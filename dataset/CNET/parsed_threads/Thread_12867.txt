<s> I am looking for a new video card, but i am not really sure what good ones are our there. </s>
<s> i hear that nvidia cards are pretty good but i dont really know which cards are worth the money. </s>
<s> my pockets arent that deep and i do not want to spend $200 on a video card. </s>
<s> im just looking for some suguestions on specific video cards. </s>
<s> Hopefully something that can run good games like Battlefield 2, FEAR, half-life 2, etc. </s>
<s> I see another post by you that says you have NVIDIA GeForce 7300 LE. </s>
<s> A more detailed post of what motherboard and processor you have and how much memory etc. </s>
<s> There is more to it than just asking &quot;which cards are worth the money&quot; </s>
