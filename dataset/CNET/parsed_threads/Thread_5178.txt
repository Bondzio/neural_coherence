<s> I have been reading many pages of the forum and it seems like everyone is having problems with the USB Ext hard drives. </s>
<s> I have a Dell desktop, 512mb mem, 40 gb hard drive that is full, and Win XP Pro. </s>
<s> Just wondering if anyone has had any luck buying and using a USB Ext hard drive on a system similar to mine. </s>
<s> Any answers appreciated. </s>
