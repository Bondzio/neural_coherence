It is a &quot;b&quot;.
It is fast enough on the XP computer that is hooked up with the ethernet cable and most of the time it is ok on the one running ME using the usb adapter.
But there are time when it is slow on the one using the usb adapter.
I was hoping to solve that by using a ethernet cable on that one.
What do you think?
