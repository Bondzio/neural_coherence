Maybe you just need to use it for the web, word processing and such? May I suggest you try PCLinuxOS and Ubuntu which are popular and free, easy to install CDs. Bob

If you can't boot that, there are problems with the machine or you forgot to set the CD as the boot device. http://www.bootdisk.com has... boot disks. I'm unsure what good they will do without an OS CD. Bob
