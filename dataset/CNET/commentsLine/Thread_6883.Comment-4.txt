...when your target is one of the most power hungry games, and you're considering cutting corners on graphics cards.
as an indicator of just how badly anything lower than a 6600gt will do in splinter cell, and keeping with that same site, have a look :  notice the 1024 x 768, shader model 3 scores?
using the frame rates as an indicator (splinter cell prefers cards with more ram), go back to the other review and look for a game there which shows similar 6600gt scores.
gun metal - game 2 1600 x 1200 shows a slightly higher frame rate score for the 6600gt (20% more) than splinter cell...and look where the le comes in (don't forget to substract 20%)!
