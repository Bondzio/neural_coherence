that is quite intense and a little too bulky.
i am thinking of painting a small amount of glue across the top (the keyed part and the hole that the key fits into) similar to glue that is used to lock screws in place, but with a little force will let go.
does anyone know of a glue/pint that will bond non-permanently in this way?
