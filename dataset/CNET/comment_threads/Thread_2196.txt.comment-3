Got it fixed, turns out it was my !
@#$% ipod nano.
I thought I had everyhting disconnected but what i thought was my mouse actually was an external usb hub.
The computer will not boot when the Nano is hooked up.
I've seen some othe rpeople have had this problem as well.
Bizarre symptoms, I was very close to buying a new board..
