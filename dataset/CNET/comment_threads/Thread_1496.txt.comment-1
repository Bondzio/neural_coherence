hi guys, i've been a pc user my whole life looking to switch to mac.
problem is that i really like to play counter strike source, and some other older pc games that i have.
i know i can install windows xp to play these pc games, but i dont know much about mac hardware.
what kind of hardware would i need to run counter strike source good?
i was thinking about getting a refurbished dual core mac mini to make the switch the cheapest way possible, but it has integrated graphics.
is there any way to put in a video card, or do i need a whole other mac?
