<s> http://www.comet.co.uk/shopcomet/product/499331/EPSON-SX100-MULTIFUNCTION-PHOTOPRINTER/tab/specification http://www.ebuyer.com/product/152149 I need the scanner to scan childhood photo's in. </s>
<s> But if I'm buying a scanner, might as well get a 3 in 1? </s>
<s> BUT I want my scans to be good quality. </s>
<s> For enlargemnts. </s>
<s> (Not huge, but book size- I don't want to lose quality) What would you recommend? </s>
<s> I don't want to spend much more than 60. </s>
<s> I know - the dpi is better on the stand alone scanner - but how much is visible to the eye? </s>
<s> The size of the image files. </s>
<s> but at least you 10x the pixels for passable scans. </s>
<s> Epson used to bundle some amazing software. </s>
<s> Look at these scans: http://s175.photobucket.com/albums/w146/rproffitt2000/?action=view&current=before.jpg http://s175.photobucket.com/albums/w146/rproffitt2000/?action=view&current=after.jpg </s>
<s> oh my Lord, that's amazing!! </s>
<s> I'm so glad I have bought the Epson stand alone. </s>
<s> I hope this will do this sort of quality! </s>
<s> That's phenominal! </s>
<s> If you would be so kind, if you find they do or do not include such software it would be nice if you could update me on this. </s>
<s> There is so much going on that I need updates from members like you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It should arrive today - I'll re-post and let you know what is included, and how good it is working. </s>
<s> I'm really excited now you've shown me that photo though! </s>
<s> It's amazing! </s>
<s> It doesn't include any software, except the scan software, which I'm not sure about. </s>
<s> There is a one touch scan to email button, a one touch, scan to pdf, a one touch scan to 'something else' button and a power button. </s>
<s> There isn't a plain one touch scan button. </s>
<s> you have to do that from the PC which is okay, but each time you have scanned, it closes the scan software window, which is a little annoying when you're doing a lot. </s>
<s> I have discovered a way though, that it will automatically scan when you open the scan software. </s>
<s> so I've dragged the icon onto quickstart on the toolbar, so even when I'm working something else on the PC it's a little faster. </s>
<s> I've downloaded photoshops 30 day trial, and am impressed what I've seen so far. </s>
<s> It pays to pay apparantly! </s>
<s> I remember when I was younger, about 14 years old (7 years ago!!! </s>
<s> :o) my dad raving about photo editing software what he'd read in the paper. </s>
<s> And the things it would do. </s>
<s> But having tried microsofts free downloads was left a bit dissapointed. </s>
<s> I wish I'd discovered this years ago now. </s>
