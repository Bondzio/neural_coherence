<s> Hi guys, The printer is a HP deskjet D1520 and is less than 6 months old. </s>
<s> Worked great untill i insallted a crap progame it came with called greeting card. </s>
<s> From there the printer stopped printing so i uninstalled all the HP software and deleted all the USB root thingys in device manager restarted and still i got an error &quot;This device has malfunction and windows does not recogonise it&quot; After tyring everything and being convice its the old PC i bought a new one. </s>
<s> This time when i connect the printer it says &quot;unknown device&quot;, &quot;the new hardware is installed and ready to use&quot;, &quot;this device has malfuncion and windows does not recogonise it&quot; So back to the old drawing board i went with deleted USB root thingys. </s>
<s> I made sure the BIOS is set to recogonise all usb devices. </s>
<s> I'm at wits end, can someone please provide me on somethings i can try? </s>
<s> Anyone? </s>
<s> u should not delete the USB root things that ur talking about.They are the USB controllers that allow u to use USB devices... U will need to install the chipset drivers if u have ur motherboard disk then install the printer software with the printer connected to it...FOllow the instructions in the manual u got with the printer.... </s>
