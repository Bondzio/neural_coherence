I'm not sure what other info I can give you.
The power, connection, and wirless lights are all on the router.
It works fine for connecting and getting on the internet with my Ipod Touch so I know the router is working and sending out a signal.
But for some reason when I go to view the wireless network connections on my laptop the router does not show up.
Is their anyway to turn on the wireless on my laptop
