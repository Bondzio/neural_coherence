i read this, and i suspect you are talking about the clear eprom header that a lot of motherboards have.
it is a three pin connector with a jumper that you pull from the one side and put across the other side to clear the eeprom(to reset the bios eeprom back to the factory defaults) i may be off base about this, but from your post i am guessing that you are not talking about a special eeprom like the one wire eeprom... if i am wrong, then never mind... if you are trying to clear your bios eprom, then you need to look in the motherboard manual, or just look at the motherboard and find the 3 pin header with erase marked next to the pin that is not jumpered.
