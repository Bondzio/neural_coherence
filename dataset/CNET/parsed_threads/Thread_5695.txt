<s> And what mobo // graphic card should i get? </s>
<s> Please commen Thx! </s>
<s> i would go for the gigabyte one. </s>
<s> dont use the psu from the case. </s>
<s> get the 37 bucks thermaltake. </s>
<s> dat should do fine. </s>
<s> about the mobo, i'm not sure because u might want to consider sli in the future. </s>
<s> go with the gigabyte gpu. </s>
<s> i would go with the ultra mobo http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813130484 go with a different power supply, antec or ocz 480+ watts your mobo will come with the cables for your drive. </s>
<s> everything will fit, nice first time list enjoy ur build! </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> My quick observation, don't forget about an Operating System...say $82+ for WinXP Home . </s>
<s> I would like a card reader like 8-in-1 or so..inexpensive. </s>
<s> Also a modem and NIC. </s>
<s> Plan on other small costs. </s>
<s> On the video card...go with the Gigabyte you listed as the Fujiplus doesn't list 'Core Clock' or 'Memory Clock' neither at their home site. </s>
<s> Note absence of 'reviews'. </s>
<s> Processor OK, I would go with the Platinum Ultra on the mobo. </s>
<s> Case power supply may be a cheapo, but can change out later if not good enough. </s>
<s> I'm not going for SLI in the future I won't play high-end games maybe some BF2 but I am fine with playing with low - med setting, I'm not an *extreme* gamer. </s>
<s> With that should i go for the cheaper mobo? </s>
<s> also I'll get the gigabyte videocard. </s>
<s> Anyone post links for a seperate power supply, should i find a cheaper case then that doesnt include a power supply? </s>
<s> As for an OS i have already one here and I don't need one of those 8 in 1 readers since i can just hook up my camera via usb and shouldnt onboard NIC be good enough? </s>
<s> I plan on using cable internet so i don't to waste $$ on a modem. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> in the future for sli. </s>
<s> you might become a gamer, your playing bf2 = VERY graphics intensive game. </s>

<s> power supply, show around newegg for antec or ocz, get at least 480 watts. </s>
<s> onboard sound uses the cpu, aka adds more usage to it which lowers gaming performance. </s>
<s> for me, i do fine with integrated sound, but i do plan on getting a soundcard in the future when i have enough money. </s>
<s> i use a logitech headset as my speakers i think you will be happy with your build. </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> Thanks for the info AKonny, i got another question, is there any difference if i get a refruibished items like a graphic cards then retail verison? </s>
<s> I am going to stick with this mobo http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813130491 I truely beilve that I'm not going to play extreme games, i stated i was going to play BF2, as in maybe a hour a week or even a month, most of my friends don't play it. </s>
<s> Another question is I am thinking about buying this case http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811144001 instead of the this one http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811144026 I dont see a difference in the 2 cases. </s>
<s> Final question, will i need to buy a 20pin to 24pin converter mobo to psu? </s>
<s> no there isnt that much of a difference between a refurbished item than a regualar item. </s>
<s> most are just returned for a newer model and such. </s>
<s> also, you can always return it if there is a problem and get another one. </s>
<s> smart on choosing that motherboard. </s>
<s> as for the cases, i dont see a difference either. </s>
<s> yeah, for bf2, none of my friends' computers can handle it lol. </s>
<s> no you will not need to buy a 20 - 24 pin connector. </s>
<s> read this thread as it helped many others including me. </s>
