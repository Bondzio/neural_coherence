I have a Maxtor OneTouch II Drive I have used for the past year. For some reason when I've tried to access it (via my computer and multiple other computers) I cannot find my files. I never manually deleted them, so I'm confused as to where they went. When I plug in the usb to a computer, the drive IS recognized. But it dopes NOT show any of the files. When I click on &quot;properties&quot; it lists a capacity of only 87 GB instead of the full 300+ GB. This harddrive is my primary backup and the contents are desperately needed for my business. I've spoken with Maxtor and recieved little help. When I use the Windows Disk Management function it tells me that there are 87 GB available and 192 GB &quot;Unallocated&quot;. I've seen through a generic recovery program that there are files there (although I can only see extentions and not any actual file names). So it appears that the 192 GB are the files I am looking for. My question then is: How do I access/recover these files that are showing up as &quot;Unallocated&quot;? Any ideas, data status theories, or places to outsource the recovery to? Thanks, Matt

That's not resistant to damage. Try this. ZAR or Zero Assumption Recovery. If it works then it's a simple question of &quot;are my files worth it?&quot; Bob
