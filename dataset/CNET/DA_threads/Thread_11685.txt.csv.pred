1.1.1	I've never tried using a different type of ram other than what the motherboard calls for.	St
1.1.2	However I found the recent disscusion of switching DDR RAM to SD RAM or visa versa interesting!	St
1.1.3	So can anyone tell me other than the Name, Number of pins, and the positioning of the slots on the ram where it connects to the motherboard.	St
1.1.4	What is the real difference?	St
1.1.5	One other thing I know you if your looking to use faster ram than is currently installed to check with the motherboard manufacturer because most will except more than one speed as long as it is the same overall type such as changing DDR ram pc 2100 to DDR ram pc 3200 on the computer that I built is allowed.

1.3.1	Thank you for trying to answer my question Mark.	St
1.3.2	However those links were not much help.	St
1.3.3	maybe i was unclear in my question.	St
1.3.4	Other than the physical connections from the ram card to the motherboard what is the actual difference between SDRAM and DDR RAM?	St
1.3.5	Is there some difference in how they help to make calculations?	St
1.4.1	DDR is running at double the clock speed of SDR.	St
1.4.2	They are not interchangeable but some motherboards offer a choice of using one or the other, not both.	St
1.5.1	Perhaps one of these may help.	St
1.5.2	http://www4.tomshardware.com/motherboard/20010104/amd-133fsb-01.html http://www.futureshop.ca/learnmore/AskTheExpert/en/computers_ram_difference.asp?logon=&langid=EN&dept=0&WLBS=fsweb11&test%5Fcookie=1 ------------------------------------- Is there some difference in how they help to make calculations?	St
1.5.3	Well the calculations are done within the cpu so the faster the cpu gets the data (needed for the calculations) from the ram the faster the cpu can make the calculations.	St
1.5.4	(less wait time)	Sug
