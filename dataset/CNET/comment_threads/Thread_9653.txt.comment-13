Hi folks.
I just got off the phone with a couple of dell technicians, and I was told that the reason that my network is bouncing is because of my Belkin router.
So I have to go out and buy a new one.
Here is my question for all of you.
Now I have a Belkin router that isn't going to be used.
Is there a way to hook both up so that I can extend my wireless signal?
I know that's pretty silly to ask, but I am just trying to find something to do with the Belkin.
Thanks folks.
