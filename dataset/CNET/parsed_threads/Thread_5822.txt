<s> I don't intend in overclocking a CPU, so what CPU would be best for me that has an excellent gaming performance (can handle most games out there right now that won't overheat so fast) and not over $1000? </s>
<s> Here are CPUs that I think they'll perform well when not overclocked? </s>
<s> : 1. </s>
<s> Intel Core 2 Duo E6850 Conroe 2. </s>
<s> Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 Kentsfield 3. </s>
<s> Intel Core 2 Duo E6600 Conroe If you have any other suggestions, feel free to recommend! </s>
<s> Addition to my initial post: I don't intend to have more than one graphics card. </s>
<s> I'm considering on buying a 8800GTX or 8800GTS or 9800GTX </s>
<s> You'll get more from the bucks in the GPU than the better of those CPUs. </s>
<s> Here's the list I like to use -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-cards,1805.html My answer changes if you tell me you are editing video clips. </s>
<s> As to overheating, none of mine overheat. </s>
<s> Why would they? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Okay. </s>
<s> I'm asking what processor should I get, not graphics card because I already know what I'm getting. </s>
<s> I'm not editing videos or anything like that. </s>
<s> All I'll be doing with the computer is playing the latest games. </s>
<s> What I mean by overheating is, I don't want the CPU to get hot so fast (high temperature) and causes the computer to have major problems or just overall low performance. </s>
<s> I've decided to go with the latest quad core, 9450 </s>
<s> hmmm... did your budget increase by 50%? </s>
<s> the q9450 is $350; the other CPUs you listed are in the $200-$230 range. </s>
<s> also, why did you skip over the 3ghz e8400 (also $200)? </s>
<s> I've seen this with a great video card and BioShock ran smoothly. </s>
<s> I'm looking to future-proof the computer I'm about to build, so I've decided to go with a quad core processor. </s>
<s> My budget for CPU is no more than $400. </s>
<s> That was not in your top post. </s>
<s> the 8800gtx is slower than and more expensive than an 9800gtx ($400+ vs $300). </s>
<s> the 8800gts/512 is more/less the same performance as the 8800gtx and only $240 or so. </s>
<s> the e6600 is $230 for 2.4ghz/1066mhz fsb/4mb L2 cache vs e8400 $210 for 3.0ghz/1333mhz fsb/6mb L2 cache. </s>
<s> even with the extra 600mhz, the e8400 will run as cool as (if not cooler than) the e6600. </s>
<s> penryn is the last revision of the core2 architecture. </s>
<s> when intel releases its next-gen Nehalem CPUs in late 2009, they will require a new motherboard since the processors will use a different socket. </s>
<s> so, every current intel mobo will become more/less obsolete in 2009. the new Nehalem will have integrated memory controllers and should debut in the 3+ghz range for quad and should also have sex(y) (6) and octo (8) cores. </s>
<s> they should run circles around penryns like conroes ran circles around pentium Ds. </s>
<s> I have an Intel Q6600 quad processor, and it is the best processor that I have ever had in a computer. </s>
<s> Go for the quad over a dual, since when you need it, you will have power to spare. </s>
<s> I also have 4 gig of ram, and every program on my computer launches in 2 to 10 seconds, their operation is also speedy. </s>
<s> I have Pinnacle Studio 10 on this new computer and it edits videos quickly and smoothly. </s>
<s> I had it on an older one with a hyperthreading processor and 2 gig of ram, and this program was a lot less speedy on that one. </s>
<s> If you get the Q6600, you will never be sorry, and have a computer that will last you many years into the future, at least until they come up with a 8 core processor!!!! </s>
<s> Ha! </s>
<s> Ha! </s>
<s> You can only run the CPU(s) it will allow. </s>
<s> Buy a board that will allow you to buy the &quot;best&quot; available today when the prices for the &quot;best&quot; comes down. </s>
<s> The best might not be the newest or the fastest, it might be the coolest. </s>
<s> Momentary hangs/crashes are an indication of CPU over heating. </s>
<s> With &quot;major&quot; over heating problems the PC will shut down. </s>
<s> To avoid over heating clean your PC routinely. </s>
<s> I'd suggest every three months. </s>
<s> Use this software for demanding applications like, gaming, video, anti-virus scan, malware scans, etc. </s>
<s> : http://www.almico.com/sfdownload.php Writing programs for multi core processors is difficult. </s>
<s> There maybe delays in getting quad core programs to run on quad core processors. </s>
<s> The most important program being your operating system. </s>
<s> My PC uses a Pentium D processor the first of the multi core processors. </s>
<s> These CPUs are &quot;fire-birds&quot;, they fly fast but they fly hot, soon they'll be arriving in flocks. </s>
