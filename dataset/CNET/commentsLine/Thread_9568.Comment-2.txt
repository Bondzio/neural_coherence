it will cost you anywhere from 100 to 200 bucks though.
i got myself this linksys wireless music system.
there are a couple just like that from diff manufacturers.
it ok, although the support is crappy.
i did have it up and running with almost no problems.
read reviews on amazon, it helped me avoid problems.
could not get the internet radio to work as their firmware is not updated.
you can listen through your normal stereo or though the provides speakers.
good luck
