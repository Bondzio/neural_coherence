I avoided technical questions at your request and now you write this.
I'll try if you will but very few forums will help folk when they write such a post.
-&gt; Yes, it's technical stuff.
But it's the stuff that matters.
If you don't want to figure out this stuff that's OK but then you need to find help that can come over and find out the details and what the issue is.
Good luck!
