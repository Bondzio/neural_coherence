1.1.1	Im looking to change my video card , since I have a nvidia mx4000 that sux badly .	St
1.1.2	regardless to price ... which video card would you recomend for this computer ?	Ques
1.1.3	Intel 3.0 Gz HT Procesor Intel D865PERL Motherboard 1024 MB DDR Ram The idea of this is playing any sort of games that have been lunched reacently to the market ... thx	St
1.2.1	I recommend you to get a BFG Nvidia GeForce 6800 Ultra OC .	St
1.2.2	This card will cost around 400-500 bucks , and it 's basically the fastest AGP 8X gaming card out there .	St
1.2.3	You could probably get one for cheap at www.tigerdirect.com or www.newegg.com Good Luck !	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	and what really changes from a 128mb card to a 256mb one ?	Ques
1.5.1	is this any good ?	Ques
1.5.2	SAPPHIRE 100592-BL Radeon X800XT 256MB GDDR3 AGP 4X/8X Video Card - OEM	St
1.6.1	the difference between 128MB and 256MB is pretty large .	St
1.6.2	Its the difference of the RAM on the video card .	St
1.6.3	so putting in the extra $ for the 256 doubles the RAM and greatly increases the speed of the video card .	St
1.6.4	i 'm pretty sure thats what it is .	St
1.6.5	i would put forth the extra money for it .	St
1.7.1	Games these days usually just need 128 mb .	St
1.7.2	or video memory to run smooth , so having a 256 mb .	St
1.7.3	of video memory is n't going to give you any major boosts in performance , because games only need 128 and buying a 256 is a waste of money and the game is not going to use the extra 128 mb. , so just stick with the 128 .	St
1.8.1	for example , which is better ?	Ques
1.8.2	xfx geforce 6800 128mb 256bit DDR 12 pipeline or xfx geforce 6600gt 256mb 128bit GDDR3 8 pipeline the price diference is 10 $ more to the second one .	St
1.8.3	and in other things , the clock on the secondone is 200 mhz faster ... my guess is the first one , but im not sure ...	St
1.9.1	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16814129048 Its faster than a 6800 for sure .	St
1.10.1	the 6800 has 256 bit way better ... .and 12 pipelines way better ... .big boost in performance ... .. also 256mb is not really required in most games ... but some new games do take 256mb if u put like all settings to high and anti aliasing and all on i would go with the 6800. even though the 6600gt has faster core clock , the pipelines and memory interface makes up the difference	St
1.11.1	u can pick up a 7800gt for around the same price ... .and dats faster and has newer technology dont suggest cards that will be outdated and replaced soon due to lack of sm 3.0 and fp32 .	St
1.12.1	I im going to buy an agp card , 7800gt its out only for pci express anyway , thanx to all who responded	St
