look at your hardware configuration under device manager.
click on processors.
how many do you show?
if you show 2, ht is enabled and recognized.
asus boards come with a nice manual.
they have several pages on bios configuration.
the book should contain this.
if you have not manual, they can be found and downloaded on the asus site.
on my asus board, the ht setting is under advanced/cpu configuration.
see if you have anything like this.
