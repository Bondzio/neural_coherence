I'd boot my Ubuntu CD (it's LIVE!) and see if I can get in there BEFORE ANY DATA RECOVERY APPS are used. Link about -&gt; http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer/ At the top of this forum is the Lost and Found welcome post where you will find apps for free, free to try and recovery services.

A full chkdisk (including surface check) after that won't harm at all. If it happens repeatedly, this might point to a hardware issue or to you handling this drive incorrectly. Let's hope it was a one time glitch that won't happen again the next 5 years. Kees
