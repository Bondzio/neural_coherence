I'm trying to find somewhere that sells a small power supply as I need a replacement for the PSU in a MEGA 180 PC (Made by MSI).
http://www.msi.com.tw/program/produc...il.php?UID=546 The PSU is a FSP250-60MS.
These look like a special made for MSI by FSP However FSP do a FSP275-50BW http://www.fsp-group.com.tw/english/...d=56&proid=395, which looks like it'll probably do the job but I can't find one anywhere and FSP and MSI don't seem to want to reply to any of my mail/posts.
Has anyone found anything else that'll fit this type of PC?
Dimensions need to be around 140 x 105 x85mm which is quite a bit smaller than most standard XT PSUs.
