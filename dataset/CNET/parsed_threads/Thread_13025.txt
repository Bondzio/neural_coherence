<s> My hard drive stopped. </s>
<s> I replaced the control board and it is now spinning however it can not find track zero. </s>
<s> Can any one help me with the next step to make this drive work long enough to duplicate it? </s>
<s> HD Specifications: Western Digital EIDE, Drive (40GB) params: LBA 78125000, model WD400BB-75CAA0, date 05 MAR 2002,DCM DSEANA2CH. </s>
<s> =Many Thanks= -HOW- </s>
<s> Changing the PCB rarely works. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> Not only must you match the make/model, but the FIRMWARE version and PCB revision levels. </s>
<s> Many will not find a working drive to steal the PCB from. </s>
<s> They'll get another dead drive and hope it works. </s>
<s> Companies like DriveSavers and Ontrack (dot com) offer data salvation services every day. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sounds like the hard drive has a bad surface area not allowing it to find track 0. </s>
<s> The old Western Digital hard drives used to have a 3 year warranty. </s>
<s> I suggest you call them and get an RMA to get a new one. </s>
<s> The fact that you replaced the control board in it may have voided your warranty. </s>
<s> I have removed the media from the bad drive and installed it in a known good drive. </s>
<s> (I have facilities to do this kind of stuff) The heads seek but never find home. </s>
<s> Finally, drive gives up and stays parked. </s>
<s> I have tried Total Recall but they will not talk technical also, want $&gt;K to recover. </s>
<s> I can't afford. </s>
<s> If I can talk to knowledgeable tech I will learn what I don't know and may be successful. </s>
<s> how? </s>
<s> &quot;If I can talk to knowledgeable tech I will learn what I don't know and may be successful.&quot; You ready to go to work? </s>
<s> Start here http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/hist-c.html http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/index.htm Re-read Bob's post. </s>
<s> A full and complete understanding and history of H/Ds' is needed, not just talking. </s>
<s> The talking comes after, to clarify understanding and proceedures. </s>
<s> You will not be succesfull swapping controller cards, Period. </s>
<s> Open the H/D case outside a clean room will destroy the drive. </s>
<s> Drop a H/D more than 1&quot; you might get lucky and not destroy the heads. </s>
<s> Trying not to sound harsh. </s>
<s> Just trying to get your attention. </s>
<s> Cause their is no easy way to gaining Knowledge. </s>
<s> Bill . </s>
<s> You may have ignored the reasons I supplied why it rarely works. </s>
<s> The firmware and PCB revision levels must be exact matches. </s>
<s> Beyond that, a failed head, cable from drive to PCB can be broken and that will be beyond many. </s>
<s> Data salvation services are held daily at the noted companies. </s>
<s> When you write you can't afford it, what you may have learned is that backup never looked cheaper. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Amen to that!! </s>
<s> My back up of all the really important stuff was my salvation. </s>
<s> But, I didn't realize how much stuff was not included in my back, many photos and the like were not included in that back up. </s>
<s> I would like to recover them and then, there is the challenge of doing it........... </s>
<s> Thank you Bill, I've always done the hard stuff and somethimes the hard way. </s>
<s> I off to start.... how </s>
<s> you don't seem to understand, having a new HDD isn't what he wants...he wants the data from the old one... </s>
