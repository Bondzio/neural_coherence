<s> Gateway 510 S 512 MB RAM Pentium 4 Windows XP When I turn the comp on, it stops during the boot-up. </s>
<s> I have tried replacing the RAM sticks. </s>
<s> Tried disconnecting the CMOS battery, I was told by a Gateway Tech that the motherboard failed. </s>
<s> Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Maybe it's the failed hard disk or something else but details will matter. </s>
<s> When I ush the power button, the machine starts, about 5 secs later I hear 1 short beep and the boot-up sequence stops. </s>
<s> Do you need more details?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> As you can imagine we have the start, the middle and the end. </s>
<s> The middle is a big place so there isn't much I can offer yet. </s>
<s> You could tell if the screen displays a bios page, settings in the bios work or it's dead to the point of no display, etc. </s>
<s> I will not be asking for details from this point on. </s>
<s> I hope you will apply yourself in helping to fix your machine. </s>

<s> just frustrated with the situation... After I attempt to turn on the computer, all peripherals sound like they are starting up... </s>
<s> When the beep happens, the monitor does not turn on, no bios screen, fan shuts down, there are still lights on inside the case, the entire boot-up process shuts itself off... Again, my apologees... Nighthamar </s>
<s> Test the monitor on another machine. </s>
<s> If it displays then back to the failed machine. </s>
<s> Try unplugging the IDE cables from the motherboard (remember where things go) and try again. </s>

<s> Monitor worked on a diff machine... Disconneced the wide beige cable bundles from the motherboard, (I hope those were the IDE cables). </s>
<s> Still same problem... Night </s>
<s> Try reseating the video card. </s>
<s> No go? </s>
<s> Try resetting the CMOS. </s>
<s> It varies with each machine so check the manual. </s>
<s> Yes, there is a added videocard, I do not know how to reset it... NVIDIA GeoForce4 4200 video card... And to reset the CMOS, just take the battery out again, right? </s>
<s> Night </s>
<s> That is the video card on my laptop... ROFL PC is GeoForce 6200 DDR2 256 MB &lt;=== NOOB Night </s>
<s> Small difference. </s>
<s> For the added video card you could unplug it and let the onboard video do the work for now. </s>
<s> Reseated the videocard and reset the CMOS... </s>
<s> When I pushed the power button, the first time I heard 2 beeps... </s>
<s> The second time, I only heard one... Is this making sense??? </s>
<s> Night </s>
<s> Since that model had onboard video we try that. </s>
<s> We don't care at this point if the customer wants the video card or not, the machine needs to work first. </s>
<s> Took out the video card, tried to power it up, still stops and gives the single beep warning... Night </s>
<s> NIL </s>
