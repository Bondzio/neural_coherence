9225	0	10633	122015	NR	Jatim	2/4/04 9:22 AM	1.07588652E12	Computer will not fire up	I tried to build a computer with a Asus P4S133 Motherboard a Intel Pentium 4 CPU but when I try to boot it up there is nothing on the screen there also is nothing from the speaker, there is power to the monitor, I have tried another monitor with the same result, the LED inside the computer is lit, the CD tray will open and close. Does anyone have any idea as to what I can check or what I can do to try and get it to work. Thank you Linda

Some notes about what new builders seem to trip over: 1. The CMOS reset jumper is in the reset position. (Who checks the manual?) 2. A motherboard manual had the HD LED on the REST connection. The manual was wrong, but the markings on the motherboard was marked proper. (So much for reading the manual!) 3. The machine was put all together and it won't fire up. TRY LESS PARTS. All I need for BEEPS (forget video!) is the CPU, heatsink/fan, power supply and the speaker. No video, ram, ide cables, cards or anything but the four parts. No beeps? Remove the case. No beeps? You are looking at the four possible dead parts. Bob
