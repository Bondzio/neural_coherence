to have you think about the question.
given the ford vs. chevy nature of the products, how would we choose?
i still like internals for the very simple reason they last longer because: a. it's more protected.
b. people tend to not drop a pc tower.
c. they turn it off to move it.
d. all of the above.
c. all of the above and more.
e. none of the above.
i hope you see the chevy vs. ford issue here.
