found it won't copy write protected dvd's.
it might work with dvdshrink but i don't know if it was the dvd or dvdshrink that had my computer going around - had to shut down and go into safe mode to resolve problem though that update i mistyped and version is 6.6.1.4, if yours is ver.6.6.0.14, it is the first one but the latter is jan. 31, 2006 darrell l.
