<s> Alright so I just bought a new Linksys wireless router, model no. </s>
<s> WRTG54G2. </s>
<s> I got it all setup and such and got it working with my iTouch. </s>
<s> But for some reason it won't work with my laptop. </s>
<s> When I go to the view available wireless networks, it doesnt show up. </s>
<s> I have a feeling the problem is with my laptop not seeing the router since the iTouch and the router work fine. </s>
<s> Anybody wanna help? </s>
<s> Please share if not. </s>
<s> Yes I did. </s>
<s> Your post was light so all I can write is the above. </s>
<s> Try making a complete post. </s>
<s> I'm not sure what other info I can give you. </s>
<s> The power, connection, and wirless lights are all on the router. </s>
<s> It works fine for connecting and getting on the internet with my Ipod Touch so I know the router is working and sending out a signal. </s>
<s> But for some reason when I go to view the wireless network connections on my laptop the router does not show up. </s>
<s> Is their anyway to turn on the wireless on my laptop </s>
<s> a little button to turn the wireless on and off. </s>
<s> Dell sometimes uses Fn & F2 at the same time. </s>
