The modem that they provided (rental) is Motorola Surfboard SB5101N. Is this modem the best option if I decide to buy rather than rent? Also what router should I need to optimize the service? No gaming or other uses, just internet connection for laptop, iPad & iPhone.

The Internet is changing to IPv6. Get a modem that supports both. I just purchased a Cisco DCP3000 that supports the new DOCSIS and IPv6, and is Gigabit output. For a router I have the D-link DIR-655 Gigabit wired/wireless N. These two together will serve you well into the future. And I hate to brag, but here is a screenshot of my Roadrunner cable speed after I installed the modem. http://www.wayne2.net/speed.jpg

Since I taught dial-up back in the 80s, back then I would never have imagined this speed. Back then a T-1 at 1.544 Mb/s was blistering speed.
