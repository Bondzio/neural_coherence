1.1.1	Hi I still have the 40 Gb hard drive that came with the Dimension 2400 , however I have upgraded RAM to 1Gb and video card to Fx5200 .	St
1.1.2	I read around and there seem to be a lot of things to consider such as different types of hard disks and maybe I am short on power supply and that the Dimension 2400 only has one power source for hard disk .	St
1.1.3	There is a lot more than that as well it seems .	St
1.1.4	Below are some information from Belarc advisor Operating System System Model Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2 ( build 2600 ) Dell Computer Corporation Dimension 2400 Enclosure Type : Space-saving Processor 2.40 gigahertz Intel Celeron 8 kilobyte primary memory cache 128 kilobyte secondary memory cache Main Circuit Board Board : Dell Computer Corp. 0G1548 A00 Serial Number : ..CN708213C2G0HP .

St
1.1.6	A hard disk of around 100 Gb would be great .	St
1.1.7	Thanks a lot in advance .	St
1.2.1	Google this : http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & lr= & q=SUPPORTED+Hard+Drive+SIZES+Dimension+2400 finds this on the first page : http : //www1.us.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/dimen_2400 It notes 160GB drives so with Dell 's latest BIOS it seems you can support 160GB drives without further research .	St
1.2.2	If you need another power connection , there are Y connectors at the stores .	St

1.3.1	I 'd upgrade your BIOS to the most recent and check to see if it mentions LBA 48 ( 48-bit Logical Block Addressing ) ?	Ques
1.3.2	If it supports that then you can get any drive you want .	St
1.3.3	Just buy one and hook it up as slave and see if your bios id 's it as the correct size ?	Sug
1.3.4	If it does your off and running .	St
1.3.5	If not buy this .	St
1.3.6	http : //www.circuitcity.com/ssm/Western-Digital-Internal-Hard-Drive-WD800JBRTL-/sem/rpsm/oid/56383/catOid/-12976/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do You can also go with and ATA pci card with lba-48 support ... . the only problem is your power supply ... . you may need to upgrade that and dell ( unless they 've changed ) uses proprietary PSU 's so it could be tricky ?	Ques
1.4.1	Cheers	Polite
