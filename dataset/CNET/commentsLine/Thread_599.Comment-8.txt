difficult and time consuming to perform...and you won't do it.
nothing i hate more than spending time looking for cds, product keys, installing the os, the drivers, the apps, setting preferences and all the rest when if i backed i could have simply restored the os and the apps in less than 15 minutes from an image.
re vista...you don't have to but at some i think you'll want to.
you've got a great 64-bit cpu which when coupled with a 64-bit os (vista) and 64-bit apps (soon to follow .
.
.
some 64-bit games already here i'm told)and that makes things just go faster.
