7377	0	192234	2079200	NR	Mac_Simon	7/19/06 9:13 AM	1.15330038E12	Switching Router Manufacturers	I just purchased a Dell laptop that came with a free 802.11G Netgear Router. I currently have a Linksys 802.11b router with one wired desktop (windows 2000), 2 wireless desktops (one running xp - one 2000) and three laptops (XP). My question is .. Do I need to get two netgear usb adapters to replace the linksys adapters or will they work with the new router( at the slower speed). I figured I would ask before I start ripping everything apart and have no internet in the house. thanks for any assistance jim

If LAN transfers are not an issue then you can live with the mixed mode method, elsewise upgrade to all ''G''.
