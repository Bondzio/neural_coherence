Try the last 50 packs of DVD-R or DVD+R I picked out at a midnight madness sale.
Try $11.75 for 50.
While it can't beat Officemax's 200 CD pack they offered for Zero bucks after rebate which you still paid tax and mailing fees so that was about 4 bucks, I can see that per GigaByte, the prices are on par with CDR.
