1.1.1	Hi I am a tad confused .	St
1.1.2	I have a generic desktop PC running an ASUS H61-MX-USB3 board .	St
1.1.3	To date I have run this wired to my router ( a D-LINK DSL-2680 ) but as I now have a multitude of other ( potentially ) wireless devices , such as games players etc I wanted to re-rig to run wireless .	St
1.1.4	I have two old redundant ( generic ) desktops both with ASUS boards and PCI cards installed .	St
1.1.5	I took one of the cards out ( a Belkin G ) to use but the motherboard ports are different ?	Ques
1.1.6	No amount of google etc has indicated when they or if they changed .	St
1.1.7	I realise having read elsewhere on CNET that I could use a USB adapter ( but which one ? )	St
1.1.8	but the consensus seems to favour a card .	St
1.1.9	I am a simple soul and your advice would be appreciated ; greatly !	St
1.2.1	Why ?	Ques
1.2.2	Less dropouts , less lag , more reliable .	St
1.2.3	And the time has passed where I used to skip USB sticks .	St
1.2.4	Why not something like I use ?	Ques
1.2.5	Example at link .	St
1.2.6	http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037G2BMY/ It 's about 10 bucks and on Windows 7 I do n't have to find the drivers .	St
