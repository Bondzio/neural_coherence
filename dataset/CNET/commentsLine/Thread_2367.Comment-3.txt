i use my toshiba netbook all the time showing microsoft powerpoint presentations.
and some of those even have linked video files, which play fine.
when connecting to a projector, i have found that netbook running windows 7 starter edition syncs with the project without a hitch.
i do these presentations on the road a lot, and being able to just carry the lighter weight netbook is great.
also, the 7+ hours battery life means that i don't need to plug in the netbook's power cord.
much nicer set up than even my 13&quot; laptop.
