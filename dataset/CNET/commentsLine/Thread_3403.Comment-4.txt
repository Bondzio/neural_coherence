at your plight... windowsxp is pretty robust at detecting wireless signals in the air around it and then proposing a dialog box where you can fill in any missing details about the connection, and then it usually takes care of itself.
but you said you have w2k.
that os predated the wifi craze and so it requires the device manufacturer to provide a client interface.
what does that mean for you?
it means you need to learn how the utility operates as well as obtain from the hotspot owner/manager (e.g., whoever in your church is responsible for maintaining the wireless network) any relevant information, such as access point name, channel, encryption keys, whatever.
then you open the utility and manually establish a new profile for that location.
if the profile is correctly set (i.e., no typos) then your system should connect.
you would only need to do this once, as the profile will be saved; but you might need to open the utility to tell it which profile in the list to use when at church and which other profile to use wherever else you might go.
