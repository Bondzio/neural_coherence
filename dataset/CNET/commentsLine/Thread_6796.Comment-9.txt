i have about 48 100 mb iomega zip disks most of which were written with xp and w2000 although a lot were written with versions prior to w2000.
vista sees the drive but doesn't read anything.
i have numerous downloaded apps on these disks either in .exe or .zip format which i can't use.
i'm not a newbie or a power user...somewhere in between.
would appreciate and suggestions, directions, etc.
thanks charles equipment: 2 gb athlon dual core processor, 2 gb ram, 320 gb hdd in two partitions, 4 printers including pdf995, 1 epson 4990 photo scanner.
