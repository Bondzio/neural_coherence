well, maybe someday they will fade.
thanks for the help - i guess i'm on the road to some sort of answer now.
perhaps ultimately to ditch this computer and get a new one that doesn't hiccup every time i look at a new program.

thanks again for your help.
at least i got the newsletter out without my computer dying - and that's a good thing!
