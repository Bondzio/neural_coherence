1.1.1	I recently acquired a 250 GB Western Digital hard drive that had been formatted on a MAC.	St
1.1.2	On both Vista and XP machines it is seen in Device Manager and Disk Management but not recognized in Explorer so I can't access it to reformat it or use it.	St
1.1.3	In Disk Management it does not have a drive letter assigned to it and when right clicking on its icon all options except HELP are grayed out.	St
1.1.4	Other than putting it back on a MAC (as that is not a convenient option) is there anyway that I can get Windows to assign it a drive letter so that I can reformat and use it?	St
1.1.5	Thanks James	St
1.2.1	I booted up GPARTED and dispatched the issue in less than 5 minutes.	St
1.2.2	Sorry but maybe there is a Windows way but I have my solution so I stopped looking.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the input.	St
1.3.2	I neglected to mention that the HD was in a SATA USB enclosure.	St
1.3.3	I took a look at the software you suggested but I couldn't find where it supported usb devices.	St
1.3.4	However your suggestion that I try a partition software reminded me that years ago I had added an additional Western Digital HD to my system and that it had come with a CD containing some set up tools.	St
1.3.5	The program is called 'Data Lifeguard Tools' and one of the options allows me to partition / format a HD on a USB port.	St
1.3.6	It worked smooth as silk.	St
1.3.7	I am currently moving some files to it.	St
1.3.8	I will eventually add it to my wireless network using a Belkin wireless USB hub.	St
1.3.9	This will allow all of the computers on the network to access it and use it as a file storage / transfer device.	St
1.3.10	Again thanks for the input.	Polite
1.3.11	James	St
1.4.1	Yes I've used GPARTED on both USB to IDE and USB to SATA drives.	St
1.4.2	Data Life Guard tools is fine too!	St
