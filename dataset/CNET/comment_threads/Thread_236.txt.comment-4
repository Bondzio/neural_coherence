Baybreeze.
Many thanks for your responding in a pleasant way, something laking on here of late.
In fact I have looked at your suggestions and am interested in buying one but thare are a couple of other machines which also interest me, other than them not having JellyBean.
I am still left with the question as to how you can know, in advance, that a machine which only carries ICS may be upgraded to JB soon or at a later date or, if in fact, never.
This is really the hub of my question which I would really love someone to answer me.
Many thanks.
