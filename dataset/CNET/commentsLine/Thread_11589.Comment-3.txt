thanks, the one with the broken pin i'll give the monitor to someone they can fix it, i build my own pcs myself (i'm no tech lol) but never worked on a monitor won't either.
i have several video cards and i tried all of them specially with the monitor that shows something on top of monitor screen, so is this one out of order also, it sounds like it, their both several years old, thanks again i've read up on working inside a monitor i won't go inside too risky thanks again
