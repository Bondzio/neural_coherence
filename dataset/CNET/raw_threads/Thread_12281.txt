I can create a new folder but it doesn't give me the option to save it to the server. Is there a book that explains this and other server related items? I originally had a computer consultant set up the system but don't want to have to rely on them every time I need to change or create something. Would this be considered a public folder? I consider myself to be fairly computer literate if I have the right information.
