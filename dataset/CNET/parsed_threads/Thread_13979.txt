<s> ANYONE HAVE THIS ITEM THAT CAN SAY WHETHER OR NOT IT'S WORTH IT </s>
<s> I bought this tablet at NCIX for $122+tax. </s>
<s> They are no longer available from that seller. </s>
<s> A different tablet of the same size can run you $500+. </s>
<s> The pen works really good especially if you have carpal tunnel. </s>
<s> A regular mouse makes my hands fall asleep and my fingers go numb. </s>
<s> I'd been using the pen almost exclusively since I got it. </s>
<s> I work on a computer all day long and it's nice to be able to come home and use my pen mouse. </s>
<s> The cordless 2 button scroll mouse is nothing special. </s>
<s> the weird felt strips on the bottom attract lint. </s>
<s> I've not used it much. </s>
<s> The tablet itself is a cheap kinda silver colour. </s>
<s> It could have been made prettier like in black or another colour. </s>
<s> The surface is very large, maybe too large for my uses. </s>
<s> I probably just use about 1/4 of the tablet. </s>
<s> It is currently holding some photos and a dvd right now and I still have enough room. </s>
<s> My recommendation is that if you can by it for cheaper than a really small one like a 4x5 for $150, then go for the big one. </s>
<s> If you are needing it for work, buy the more expensive one and write it off as expenses on your taxes. </s>
<s> If you just want a new toy, why not get this one. </s>
<s> If you have carpal tunnel like me, go for it!!! </s>
<s> Your hands would thank you. </s>
