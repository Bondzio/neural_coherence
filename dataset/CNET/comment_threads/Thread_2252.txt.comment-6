We see far too many people here putting things on an external hard disk and losing all (or having to pay for recovery) when it breaks down, because they forget making a backup and trust the drive will live forever.
Which it doesn't.
So, if you've got 1 Tb of data, it makes sense to have another 1 Tb somewhere for your backup.
That's 40 BlueRay DVD's or a professional tape drive with tapes or a second hard disk.
