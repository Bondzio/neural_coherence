so we recently bought a broadband router and when i connect to the name of wireless it requires me a password, after filling it, there is near the clock a sign that it is connected, but on that connection sign there is again that exclamation sign saying no internet access.
it is clear that the network is connected cause it even gives me the option of saying if it is home, public or work, but then after that it says no internet connection!
