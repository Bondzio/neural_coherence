type xp sata at google and some thousands are having issues.
this old os is not up to speed on sata.
the problems are many and it is best you keep it fed with parts and interfaces that were around back then.
the most common workaround is setting the bios to ide emulation but there was no standard there so no one knows if your machine can do that.
to add more trouble, if your original xp install was &quot;xp&quot;, &quot;xp sp1&quot; then troubles are too common as the base os was pre-127gb or pre-sata days.
some have a problem with an os's passing.
