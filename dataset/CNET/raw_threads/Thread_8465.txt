In one graphics forum I visit, someone had said that if you have a second hard drive in your computer, and you do not install any operating system files on that drive and just put your files on it (my case would be word and excel files, graphics, and an user created game content), that should you get a virus on the main drive, it wouldn't harm your documents on the slave. Is this true? I'm curious since Office Max is having a really good sale on some drives this week and wanted to know if it's worth the drive to the store for a look. Thanks in Advance

(Folder Lock is a very good utility to purchase.) http://www.newsoftwares.net/folderlock/?id=ew I try to make it a habit to run my security tools on drive C:and shut down my internet service before I open any off the other drives. When I run Ad-Aware, Nortons Antivirus, Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal tool, all off them checks all drives. Go get that extra drive: Good Luck Wendell H

My external hard drives are only turned on once a month or less often Even doing that there is no guarantee that my Anti-virus and spyware programs picked up everything.

Backup all data you wish to keep on CD/DVD and then you will not have to worry about virus infecting your files.

There have been viruses that purposely seek out files with a particular extension such as .doc, .xls, etc. and either infect them or delete them. There was one virus years ago that would seek out .mp3's and delete them (lets just hope the music people don't get their hands on that one). The best protection is a backup to a CD-R/RW or DVD-R/RW. Make sure your virus protection and spyware protection is fully updated and you will be fine. The only thing a second hard drive protects you from is the loss of files when the O/S drive either needs to be reloaded or dies completely. I have had to help recover files on many friends computers because they saved their photos and personal files to the C:\ drive and then the boot partition got corrupted or the drive up and died. After paying my bill many of them added a second drive or external and started doing backups. I say get the second drive but still think about keep backups on a more permanent media. Primitive man had it right....backups were carved in stone.

I always had an infected (you wouldn't believe how infected) OS but all the files that were put on my D drive are A-OK. I have no antivirus, no firewall, no nothing. Anyway, most crap disturb the Windows directory and the registery so if I were you I would not worry.
