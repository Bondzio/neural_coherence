Thanks for the reply.
I've posted in other places on the Internet, and I rarely get anything more than ''PCChips ist teh SuXoRz!''
and no further direction.
The advice I have basically has made me abandon what I really wanted to do, because I apparently don't understand enough about chipsets, motherboard companies, and types of RAM, I shouldn't be allowed to touch the inside of a computer.
But I do know that I want around 500 GBs of HD space, a lot of RAM, a DVD drive with a separate dual-layer, dual format lightscribe burner, and a video card that lets me input and output TV.
Beyond that, I just want a good computer that works, not the pure performance that I think most are thinking of.
The biggest thing I'm worried about is the video card.
I think I can handle everything else, providing the other parts are compatable.
If I bought an Emachine or HP, I still wouldn't know exactly what video card to buy.
