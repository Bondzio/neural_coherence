i don't know what you're talking about now.
i'm not interested in becoming a linux convert.
there is no damage to the drive or anything like that, so getdataback etc might be the wrong kind of program.
cloning the drive - is that possible?
the computer i took the drive from was vista, this new one is windows 7
