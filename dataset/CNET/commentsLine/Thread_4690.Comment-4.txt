connecting two computers to a router forms a network of two computers.
the icon in your taskbar that indicates you are &quot;connected&quot; means only that you are successfully connected to your router.
that doesn't mean that your router made the proper connection to your cable/dsl modem.
the router needs to be configured according to the instructions that your isp provides for using a router with their service.
internet --- modem --- router &gt; &gt; &gt; computers this usually means setting the router to &quot;pppoe&quot; for dsl or &quot;automatic dhcp&quot; for cable service.
sometimes mac address cloning is required.
don't rely on me, though.
you need to follow the instructions from your isp for configuring your router.
