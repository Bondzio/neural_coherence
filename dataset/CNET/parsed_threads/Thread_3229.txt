<s> HEy everyone, I'm running a Dell Dimension 4700 PC and I have recently just bought a MSI 7600gs graphics card to replace onboard graphics. </s>
<s> I plug it into my PCI-E slot and everything is fine, the fan spins and it seems alright. </s>
<s> However, I un-installed and disabled the onboard drivers and plugged my monitor into the card. </s>
<s> I get nothing, my monitor doesn't even recognize a new device in the system. </s>
<s> I went into the BIOS and made sure it was set on 'AUTO' to read new devices, and it was set. </s>
<s> This is the first time I am using the PCI-E slot, is there anything I have to do to activate the slot? </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank You </s>
<s> The version of motherboard driver package you used. </s>
<s> Also try setting the &quot;Init display&quot; to PCIe or others. </s>
<s> Sorry if that isn't the right words for your BIOS but there is no standard so I just look to see if it's an option. </s>
<s> Also, some of these boards need a power supply connection. </s>
<s> I note this in case yours did and you forgot. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> No power supply connection needed. </s>
<s> Did you let the generic windows driver install before installing new drivers? </s>
<s> it does not notice the card at all, it notices the onboard graphics after i uninstalled the drivers, but not the new card. </s>
<s> and the BIOS says nothing about any pci-e slot. </s>
<s> According to the Dell site that computer has 2 PCIe slots. </s>
<s> one is a x16 the other a x1. </s>
<s> I know that card (as I have the same card) is a x16 and I don't know what putting it in the x1 slot would do. </s>
<s> It also takes a minimum 300 watt power supply and I couldn't find what the 4700 comes with. </s>
<s> It also mentions that you have to tell what slot you are putting the card into for it to work. </s>
<s> Hope that helps. </s>

<s> I only see one pcie slot in the system. </s>
<s> And it is right over what appears to be pci slots, i'm not sure though. </s>
<s> I don't see a second pci-e slot </s>
