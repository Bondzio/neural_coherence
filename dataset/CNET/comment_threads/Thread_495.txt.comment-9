Personally, I can't justify the cost for my uses (not a high-end gamer).
I usually don't consider purchasing such items until there are more models with the new chipset, prices drop, and bugs are worked out; however, I did notice that many of its bad reviews seem to come from consumers with less hardware experience.
Test labs have had success.
It definitely is not a novice board.
