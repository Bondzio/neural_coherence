i'm having the same issue as the original poster.
i'm using a dell vostro 1500 laptop running xp pro with a nvidia geforce 8600m gt graphics card.
trying to use the acer v223w monitor for a dual display setup.
any ideas on what i can try?
i've tweaked every setting i can find, using the monitor's button controls, windows settings, and the included software, and nothing fixes the issue.
any help would be *greatly* appreciated!
