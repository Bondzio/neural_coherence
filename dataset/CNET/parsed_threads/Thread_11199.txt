<s> Ok, so I have a Dell Latitude D505 laptop that I received for free. </s>
<s> I came with a Fujitsu 60G ATA-100 hard drive which I quickly filled up to capacity. </s>
<s> I purchased a new Western Digital 160G drive from newegg which is ATA-6. </s>
<s> I used a hard drive clone device to copy my smaller drive and then pulled out the old caddy and replaced the drive. </s>
<s> Upon start-up, I received an error message that the new drive was no bootable. </s>
<s> Is this due to the difference between ATA-6 and ATA-100? </s>
<s> Thats the only discernable difference. </s>
<s> The new drive has ~40 pins and the old drive has like a bar type connection. </s>
<s> If that is the case, is there anything I can do to use the ATA-6 drive or am I screwed? </s>
<s> Hey, I figured it out. </s>
<s> No need to respond. </s>
<s> of helping others ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
