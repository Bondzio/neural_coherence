i have a dell dimension 4700 and it no longer boots up windows xp.
after doing some research i learned that maxtor hard drives have a high failure rate.
i have a maxtor.
return code 7 is bad.
i got return code 7. i have a friend who said she has a cd that may find the hard drive but i thought i'd throw the question out to see what kind of advice i can get.
thank you.
