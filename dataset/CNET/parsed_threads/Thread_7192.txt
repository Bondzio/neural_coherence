<s> Again, these externals are not &quot;storage&quot; but fine copies. </s>
<s> The noise is telling me that if you want the files out you will go to drivesavers.com. </s>
<s> Sure, you can try removing the drive from the case and in another case but the sound is one where the surface of the platter can be scraped off and along with it the data. </s>

<s> This is usually when the computer owner learns why so many others tell them to keep backup copies of what they can't lose. </s>
<s> Even in Mauritius I'm sure you can use DROPBOX to keep a few things you can't lose safe. </s>
