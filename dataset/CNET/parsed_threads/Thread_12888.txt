<s> Hello everyone. </s>
<s> I am a new bee sort of external drive galaxy tvisto macpower tech. </s>
<s> 3.5 IEEE 1394 sbp2 device-enclosure inside is Drive Hitachi HDT725032VLAT80 (298 GB) comp info is as follows Field </s>
<s> A recurring problem I see is with external drives connected with firewire. </s>
<s> I offer no cure since we'll have to wait till Redmond issues it but for today I use USB 2.0 for Windows and Firewire connections for Apple machines. </s>
<s> Your choice to do otherwise but you may be repeating what others have discovered. </s>

<s> C:\Documents and Settings\Owner&gt;chkdsk L:/f The type of the file system is NTFS. </s>
<s> Unable to determine volume version and state. </s>
<s> CHKDSK aborted. </s>
<s> if that will help any one with my problem thank you </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> I connect it with USB 2.0 or better yet internally to the IDE connection in a desktop. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I try tools like ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY or GETDATABACK. </s>
<s> If those show promise and we need the files we pay up. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
<s> don't write to the disk, take it out of the case and connect it directly to the IDE cable and see if you can recover the files with data recovery software. </s>
<s> Lcn of $MFT is invalid this is what i have found to be causein the problem now if some one knows a way to get to that file or even find it fix or anything else thank you for the help so far but in order to recover the files i need another hard drive aboput 320 gigs but dont have the money so i need to find a way to fix that file i believe thank you for anmy help past ppresent or future </s>
<s> Since no response to my post and the items there I take it that you are still connected with firewire and didn't try the demos of the software noted. </s>
<s> Looks grim from my view. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> 1 i did connect it with ussb but cant recover files cuase i dont have 320 gig s free on any drive no internal or external </s>
<s> If you value these files you'll have to wait till you have disk space to copy it off once you get the tools. </s>
<s> However some can't wait until they get in the right place, time and tools. </s>
<s> In those instances I see most lose it all. </s>
<s> The softwares I noted have free demos so it can give you insight to the issue and might give me a clue what other tools could be used. </s>
<s> But this issue is dead for now since we can't copy the contents out today. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> WELL YES I HAVE USED MANY RECOVERY SOFTWARE TO SEE WHAT WAS GOIN ON BUT THAT STILL DOESNT HELP ME GET THE DIRVE FIXED WITH OUT A REFORAMT THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP I D GUESS I HAVE TO LOOK ELSEWARE </s>
<s> I've encountered drives we can't repair with any tool known. </s>
<s> It's why we turn to copying the contents out, wipe the drive, test it and copy the contents back. </s>
<s> -&gt; Not all damage is repairable and some repairs will cause more damage. </s>
<s> Then again not everyone believes this and will lose it all in repeated repair attempts. </s>
<s> I've shared what we do and what I see happen. </s>
<s> Your choice here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ok first off i never said that i didnt believe you i was lookin for an alternative method as i dont have funds to buy another drive and im in a time constrant to get to all the files soon ok it seems to me that if its a system file cruuption that it should be fixable as all it is is numbers and yet im just a novice here but eveerything hats not damage caused by trame physical damage only a fault in writing then there should be a way to rewrite a broken file without a reformat if i had the funds i d get another external drive and just recover all files to that drive reformat this drive and thats it id e one happy camper </s>
<s> Sadly I see a disaster happening soon. </s>
<s> You are in a hurry so I predict a bitter end. </s>
<s> PC FILE INSPECTOR may let you copy a few files you need today out until you have all the right parts to do this right. </s>
<s> Hey, I love watching a good train wreck (watch others not take the safe recovery path and try repairing such a drive without backup.) </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i love the way your assumeing what i may or may not do im not goin to do anything as i dont have enought knowldge to try to fix i did say that i am a new bee and i cant recover much i need all or nothing so its goin to be nothing so i losse either way i was just makin a statement of what it should be not that its like that but just an opion like your opion that you see a train reck when there isnt going to be a train hahaha and i love watching peeple make wrong assumptions wich you just did bye BOB </s>
<s> I hope if anything I've scared you enough to not lose it all. </s>
<s> There are a few get upset I don't have a &quot;magic bullet&quot; of software that will fix a drive and get it working again. </s>
<s> Since I don't have that I share a few decades of what I do to save drive data today without the k-buck charge at drivesavers or ontrack. </s>
<s> You seem upset with such candor which I understand since I've seem many get very stressed over the possible losses. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> first as a moderator you should be neutural at all times and well no i wasnt upset but you have some eggo i only had a comp for a little over 2 years and i have learned alot and i share all my knowldge without that hugh eggo that you have so go right ahead and cancil my membership on cnet i gave you the same treatment as you gave me yo8u mad a bad assumption and now are blamin another (me) for gettin upset which i was not </s>
<s> I really wish you the best of luck in recovery. </s>
<s> But this is all volunteer efforts and I will not be neutral when it comes time to saving our skins (data.) </s>
<s> Wishing you the best of luck, Bob </s>
