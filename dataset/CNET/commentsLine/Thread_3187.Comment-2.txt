hi i bought i gaming laptop (2.6ghz dual core amd with nvidia 7900gtx go -17.1&quot;) graphics and was happy for a short space of time...the reason, when i wanted more performance after a year, there was nothing i could do except to get faster ram, bigger hard drive and re-install windows.
it cost me 1600 and i regret it up to this day.
recently i spend 1450 on building my own core i7 pc (my first build) and it was really easy - i have a large 24&quot; monitor, 920 i7 processor, 4870 1gb ati card, 1tb hdd, 12gb ddr3 ram, asus p6t deluxe motherboard, coolermaster m850, thermaltake armour case, creative titanium x-fi sound card, compro dual dvb-t tv card and windows vista 64 bit.
the processor can be overclocked with ease whenever i want to (although, it's not currently necessary to do so as it is able to run everything well) and i have no problems - when i need more power, i can always upgrade components one at a time at a later stage.
at the end of the day, it depends on your needs - do you want a computer that you can take everywhere, or do you want something with performance that can serve you for many, many years with upgrades?
since, you are 16, you probably need a computer that you can carry around to do all of your academic studies and some light gaming (not sure about macs for gaming -never used one before), but this is the rationale that you should use when trying to make a decision - good luck with the choice and remember, whatever you get will only be regarded as the 'best choice' if it is able to serve all of your needs/requirements - hope this helps.
