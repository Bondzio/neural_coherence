first: in two nic and ics running, usually there is a configuration for each nic (in ie, tools, internet options, connections, lan setting) one for file sharing and the other for internet access...you have to know which nic for each.
second: prior to windows xp days, you might have to uninstall and reinstall ics and remove and add tcp/ip protocol.
third: check your tcp/ip binding.. (in windows me, tcp/ip should be 'binding' to client microsoft network and file and printer sharing)-- (in stand alone win 9x/me, this should be unbind).
again its only a few thought...
