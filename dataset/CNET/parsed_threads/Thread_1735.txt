<s> Hi there and hope someone can help or advise if possible. </s>
<s> I cant see where the 4 pin connector from the ATX PSU (2 yell 2 blk wires - 12 volt I think) is supposed to connect to my motherboard. </s>
<s> The m'bd is a PC100 socket 370 and has PSU input sockets for either AT (2 x 6 pin) or ATX (1 x 20 pin)The M'bd manual shows a 22 way connector(J7) and shows where to connect Spkr, Power Led's, Keylock Pins, HDD Led's, Reset Switch and Power Switch. </s>
<s> Not all pins are used with the old AT PSU. </s>
<s> Please help, thank you, Heather </s>
<s> At least none I've seen. </s>
<s> New power supplies will have this as well as SATA power connections that you might not use. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob, much appreciated Heather </s>
