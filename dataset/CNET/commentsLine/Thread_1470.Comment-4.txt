if you have a wireless router/access point.
i would just share all of the devices while connected to the tower, the tower must be on to access them but the wireless print server is not going to work properly with a mulitfunction device!
if you attach everything to the tower and share it across the network you should be able to find and install all of the devices remotely without the print server at all.
