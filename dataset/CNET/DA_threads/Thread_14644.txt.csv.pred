1.1.1	I am having problem w/ my WRK54G Linksys router dropping the connection to my Linksys cable modem .	St
1.1.2	My cable modem is on a DHCP network .	St
1.1.3	I have plugged my laptop directly into the modem and can surf fine .	St
1.1.4	However , once I connect the router back up , it will only stay connected for 5 minutes .	St
1.1.5	At first I thought it was the connection between my laptop and the router , but when I connected via a cable I had the same issue .	St
1.1.6	I then tried to log into the router itself via wireless and sure enough I was able to .	St
1.1.7	I have changed out the cable with a known working one , and that did n't solve the problem .	St
1.1.8	Any ideas why the router would be dropping the connection after about 5 minutes ?	Ques
1.1.9	David	St
1.2.1	can be resolved with a firmware update .	St
1.2.2	Look into your Linksys program and then to the website to see if one exists .	St
