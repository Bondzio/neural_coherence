most bios's do that.
not much that i can add here.
maybe you wanted a bios to change which is the primary display but for most machines onboard is .. onboard and the other selection is the other card no matter if it's pci, pcie, agp or another.
hope this helps.
and no, i see no signs that bios writers will ever get this right.
