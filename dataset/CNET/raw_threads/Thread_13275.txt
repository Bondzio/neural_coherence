Server is the PDC and acts as a file server (everone stores most of their files on the server) and also acts as an FTP server. The FTP server traffic is sporadic, but sometimes we use it to transfer some rather large files. The server also acts as an App server for 1 application. Right now we're on a 10/100 network (all computers connect at 100) with 2 switches (have to have 2 because of the way the wall outlets are situated) all behind a DSL router. I'm wondering if it would make a noticeable difference if I upgrade the network to a Gigabit network. It would cost about $675 for the new cards and switches and labor. We already have cat 5e cabling. The network doesn't really run under a heavy load, but I do transfer some large files over the network in my every day work and I was thinking that might speed up. Any thoughts or experience in the matter? Thanks! Matt
