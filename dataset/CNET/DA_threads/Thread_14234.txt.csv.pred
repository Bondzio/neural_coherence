1.1.1	I am in need of a upgrade for my main computer.	St
1.1.2	I mostly use that computer for gaming and graphic/web design.	St
1.1.3	I have never used AMD so I am not sure if I want or can come up with a good system based off their CPU's.	St
1.1.4	However, if someone can come up with some ideas for highend AMD system that will work with what I have in mind; I may take a look.	St
1.1.5	I will list the parts I have come up with so far and I would love to hear any feedback.	St
1.1.6	Also, I have a limit of about 2300 to spend.	St

St
1.2.1	wow that is an extreme system.	St
1.2.2	although, if you do do gaming, you might want to look more at amd.	St
1.2.3	they are the best when it goes to gaming.	St
1.2.4	everything looks good, and the power supply should handle that, but you should look at antec's new line of true power II.	St
1.2.5	water cooled - nice gpu - either is fine where is your hard drive btw?	St
1.2.6	i would say go 2 raptors in RAID 0 and maybe add another 120gb drive cuz you have alot of moooonay!	Sug
1.2.7	case - ???	St
1.2.8	i would recomend the new p180 from antec.	St
1.2.9	the cooling on this is superb esp if you choose intel.	St
1.2.10	yah other than that, you are building a beast.	St
1.2.11	konny	St
1.3.1	I was thinking of overclocking the 3.73 to 4.0.	St
1.3.2	I have seen gaming benchmarks with the EE overclocked to 4.0 and it was performing only a little bit under the FX-55.	St
1.3.3	Plus, I am guessing the other parts that I am getting will make up in performance in the games.	St
1.3.4	I have a 120 internal and 60 external that I will use.	St
1.3.5	I was thinking about getting one raptor but would only one SATA HD ruin the point of raid?	St
1.3.6	The case is the first Koolance item I listed under &quot;Stuff I already have&quot;.	St
1.3.7	The water cooling system is built into a custom Lian Li case.	St
1.4.1	requires at least two drives.	St
1.5.1	Beat the Intels in both the PCWorld and PCMag bench tests.	St
1.5.2	Kick on up to the dual processor and it will kick the Pentium's butt.	St
1.5.3	Get a DVD-ROM too.	St
1.5.4	Never know when you might want two DVD drives, hint, hint.	St
1.5.5	Don't wast your time, even thought you didn't mention it, on a dual layer drive.	St
1.5.6	The disks are outrageously priced, about ten bucks each.	St
1.6.1	I would obviously get the FX-55 with a nice Asus mobo...maybe even SLI if u felt like it	St
