Ya, my little rig is maxed at 512 (2x256) but bc I got it from ubid.com and it was my fault for getting the wrong one Ill just keep it for now and sell it on ebay after I do what that one guy said, test it in a friends computer.
I was just a little freaked out bc with just the 512 chip in, it ran show and only at 64mb
