6495	0	134925	1520751	NR	Pelham Manor Cats	11/6/05 12:15 PM	1.1312793E12	Maxtor 5000XT	I cannot ask Maxtor, because they charge for support. I have a Maxtor 5000XT external hard drive which has 1 USB (1.1/2.0) and 2 FIREWIRE ports. I want to be able to backup my Notebook and my Main Frame. My notebook has only a USB port and my Main Frame has Firewire ports. Can I attach the notebook using a USB cable and attach the Main Frame using a Firewire cable to the same Maxtor 5000XT? I would never be backing them up at the same time. Can both wires be attached at the same time or will there be a conflict? Windows XP SP2

There is no electrical issue but the Microsoft OS caches some tables (directories) and more so when the other machine changes a file, the other machine will not know the file allocation table was changed. Total data loss would occur. As to the rest, try it out. Bob
