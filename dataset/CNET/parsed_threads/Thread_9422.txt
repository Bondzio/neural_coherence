<s> I don't have much experience with networking and usually find this very frustrating. </s>
<s> There's no simple &quot;on&quot; setting. </s>
<s> I don't even know where to begin. </s>
<s> Anyone want to help walk me through? </s>
<s> Since I don't research devices, the question would be, does the modem incorporate a router? </s>
<s> And does this router contain a wireless radio? </s>
<s> If the answer is no to the router, you need to purchase a wireless router to attach to the modem. </s>
<s> Connect thus: Modem -&gt; router -&gt; PC. </s>
<s> Please answer the first two questions. </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> The Modem incorporates a 802.11g wireless router and broadcasts a signal that can allow 255 users to receive. </s>
<s> But like I mentioned above, there's no &quot;on&quot; setting, there's a whole lot of settings that weren't in any of my previous modems. </s>
<s> Is there such? </s>
<s> Installation CD? </s>
<s> More settings because the modem contains the router. </s>
<s> In general you access the router (wired), you'll need to find the documentation for the specific IP address used. </s>
<s> Generally it will be 192.168.x.x. </s>
<s> After you enter the router setup you navigate to the wireless settings. </s>
<s> Wireless on should be the default setting. </s>
<s> Does your PC have wireless capability? </s>
<s> If so have you searched for wireless networks? </s>
<s> I'm really not prepared to give the full tutoral for your specific modem/router. </s>
<s> It should come with the setup instructions. </s>
<s> Not that I don't want to help, but I decline to duplicate any existing documentation. </s>
<s> The CD that came with the modem/gateway contains the installation manual. </s>
<s> It is an amazing 41 pages long and, I think, personally written by the techs at 3BTECH. </s>
<s> I followed all the instructions. </s>
<s> (((Yes my laptop has built in WiFi and a switch on the front to Enable/Disable. </s>
<s> The switch is Enabled and I can usually see 2-4 other networks.))) </s>
<s> My laptop is a Toshiba Satallite A215, AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual-Core TK-57 1.9 Ghz, 2 GB Ram, Vista Home SP2. </s>
<s> And before I go further, I will say that I am a computer expert with very little knowledge of networking but a tad bit of experience with it...trial and error type stuff mostly. </s>
<s> When I go to &quot;192.168.1.1&quot; I am redirected to &quot; http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/webcm&quot; and there I log into my modem. </s>
<s> I find myself at the HOME page. </s>
<s> Across the top are tabs labeled Home, Wizard, Setup, Advanced, Wireless, Tools, Status, and Help. </s>
<s> I have played around with some settings under most of these to try and &quot;turn on&quot; the wireless and haven't gotten anywhere. </s>
<s> The HOME tab displays basic status information. </s>
<s> For this post I will qoute what I currently see. </s>
<s> System uptime: 09 hours 58 minutes DSL Status: Connected DSL Speed: 512/3008kbps Wireless RF: Disabled Ethernet: Connected Software Version: 3.6.0C_2N00 SSID: ASUSMATT At the bottom there is two buttons &quot;log out&quot; and &quot;Refresh&quot; Per the instructions in the included manual and of my ISP's (AT&T) particular settings, I went to WIZARD. </s>

<s> Obviously, I saved and restarted and was online in seconds through Ethernet. </s>
<s> The next TAB is SETUP where I have: (HEADING) LAN Setup LAN Configuration Ethernet Switch (HEADING) WAN Setup New Connection Modem (followed by a green light) Wizard Gamer Log Out The First thing I did was go to New Connection because there wasn't clear instructions concerning the wireless feature in the manual. </s>

<s> I just read your post and noticed the &quot;Wireless RF: Disabled&quot;. </s>
<s> And one of the options you state at the top is Wireless. </s>
<s> All you need to do is Enable wireless. </s>
<s> If this modem/router is supplied by your ISP they can walk you through the setup. </s>
<s> Does Wireless RF: Disabled at the Home page mean that my wireless is turned off and not transmitting? </s>
<s> Go to the Wireless option at the top of the page. </s>
<s> Nope, The modem is a 3rd party buy. </s>
<s> I got it for like $20 instead of AT&T's $70 option. </s>
<s> In hindsight, maybe next time I'll use there's. </s>
<s> If it's the 2wire like I had a couple of years ago, it's so easy to use it's pathetic. </s>
<s> lol. </s>
<s> Yeah. </s>
<s> I wondered about that. </s>
<s> I can't figure out how it's disabled or how to turn it on. </s>
<s> There's no simple &quot;on&quot; button. </s>
