13928	0	266495	2597817	NR	wrytat	10/3/07 1:53 AM	1.19137638E12	Problem using HP LaserJet 1022 on network	I have 2 computers, A and B. Both computers are running on XP Professional SP2. Computer A is installed with a HP LaserJet 1022. Computer B is installed with Epson Stylus C79. Both printers are using USB interface. As both computers are in the same network, I shared both printers out, so that computer A can use the Epson printer, while computer B can use the HP printer. After all the setup, computer A can use the Epson and HP printers. Computer B can also connect to both printers. But when printing using the HP, only blank page comes out. And when I login using administrator account to look at the HP printer Properties, it tells me that the driver of the printer is not properly installed. But I tried installing the driver from the CD and also downloaded the driver from the website to install... all didn't work. So I tried connecting the HP printer directly to computer B, and install it. But while installing the printer, I got error message telling me that the required section was not found in the INF. I have another computer C. C can successfully connect to both printers and use them. Let me tell you some history of computer B. Before using LaserJet 1022, it was using LaserJet 1100. What should I do?
