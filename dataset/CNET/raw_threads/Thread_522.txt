However, as stated above, I've been told that if I increase the voltage going to CPU, I can overclock even further. the current voltage is 1.650V. What can I safely increase this to so I don't damage the CPU?

It's top temprature at the moment is 46 degrees C. That's when I'm in the BIOS, I'm led to believe that this puts a 100% load on the CPU. Windows is averaging around 40-43 degrees. Whats the acceptable temprature limit?
