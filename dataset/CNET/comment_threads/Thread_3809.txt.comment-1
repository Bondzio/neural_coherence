I was looking at a hec X-Power Pro 650 650W Continuous PSU.
It costs only $55 off new egg and it seems perfect for a gaming rig I want to build.
I've read the reviews but came across no horror stories, yet.
has anyone had experience with this PSU or others like it?
I'm on a tight budget and that's why it seems to perfect for me Also, does anyone know of a device that will ensure that if my PSU fails, the rest of my hardware will be OK?
