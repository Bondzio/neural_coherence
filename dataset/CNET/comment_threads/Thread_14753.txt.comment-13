I am currently trying to move XP to another larger hard drive and I have already used XXcopy and copied the files over the other HD.
I also must mention that I am changing from IDE to SATA.
The only problem is my computer wont reconize my new HD as the C drive.
even when I take out my old HD the computer will not boot.
Is there another step I must take such as using a floppy for something?
