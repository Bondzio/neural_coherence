<s> I've been looking at tablets for quite along time now and i happen to come across these awesome deals. </s>
<s> The only thing is I cant decide on which one is the best. </s>
<s> Office depot has the Google Nexus 7 32Gb for $240. </s>
<s> They have the Asus Transformer pad 32Gb for $300. </s>
<s> They also have the Samsung Glasaxy tab 2 10.1 16Gb for $300. </s>
<s> And lastly they have the Samsung Galaxy tab 2 7&quot; 16Gb for $170. </s>
<s> I would like to use a tablet for school and use the polaris office to type documents. </s>
<s> I would use it to play games often. </s>
<s> The design and feel of the tablets does not bother me, but I would rather like to have a 10 inch tablet. </s>
<s> Just please give me some insight on what is the best deal and which one would be best. </s>
<s> The office works on apps so at my desk I have the Nexus 7 32GB and a tf300t Transformer. </s>
<s> But the problem as I see it is I don't see how you could replace the common laptop with either. </s>
<s> I did stumble over a deal for an Asus for 300 which is pretty nice if touchscreen is what you were after. </s>
<s> It was a refurb and the office popped for it and it's not bad. </s>
<s> http://www.woot.com/offers/11-6-touchscreen-core-i3-vivobook My only wish was it's fan was a bit quieter but for 300, I'm in. </s>

<s> Well I was wanting a tablet for the portablitly and convenience and the ones that I am looking at are cheaper. </s>
<s> Do you like the nexus 7 or the tf300 better? </s>
<s> The Nexus 7 is the de facto standard for Android tablets. </s>
<s> It has every Android gizmo (did you know it has the magnetometer?) </s>
<s> and is very nice. </s>
<s> The Transformer is the one with the keyboard dock so you get a few 32GB memory slots so it is probably the biggest storage tablet today. </s>
<s> It goes for a few days on a charge and it's almost a laptop as I use it with a bluetooth mouse. </s>
<s> But neither are used as laptop replacements but demo units for our apps. </s>
<s> For work, I can't see how it could fill the laptop's shoes. </s>
<s> Maybe and since they are all pretty equal in apps I'm going to write you should buy the cheapest tablet from your post so far. </s>
<s> That way you won't get too burned. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> apple makes in my mind the best tablets in the world. </s>
<s> if you are in the 300$ price range the Ipad mini would be I tiny bit more expensive but worth it . </s>
<s> they have the best os and it will get even better with IOS7. </s>
<s> you can download more games and better games with it and I think that the extra 30$ would make a big difference. </s>
<s> this is the link to it. </s>
