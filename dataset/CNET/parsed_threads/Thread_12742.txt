<s> I m facing 2 problems with my hp Compaq dx 2009 VSFF System (the small CPU) 1. </s>

<s> you can't be helped. </s>
<s> Assuming you downloaded the XP drivers from hp.com and installed them in correct order (primarily chipset before vga), the default display mode must be beyond the range of the monitor. </s>
<s> Only way you can set a resolution/refresh within range of the monitor is to use another more capable monitor with wider range of display res/refresh (beg/borrow?) </s>
<s> to alter the display mode and then re-connect to your w15v. </s>
<s> Via CPUs derive their low power rating by using software instead of hardware to execute some functions. </s>
<s> Since most, if not all, low-end AIOs require the CPU to process vector graphics, the C7 is likely underpowered for the task. </s>
<s> Item 1 is sometimes corrected by booting SAFE MODE (which I no longer tell how since we can research that on our own) then setting the display mode to what the monitor supports (or lower!) </s>
<s> Item 2 is because the machine doesn't support this. </s>
<s> Since we can't change this you may want to have others print the pages for you. </s>
