It mentions...&quot;A Bluetooth passkey (PIN code) is required for you to connect to the printer. Please make a note of your Bluetooth passkey before you start the set-up process.&quot; Question: Will this &quot;passkey (PIN code)&quot; come with the BU-20 adapter? Then is states: &quot;If you are connecting to the printer for the first time, enter the passkey for the device from the [Bluetooth Passkey (PIN Code)] window, and then click on the [OK] button.&quot; This sounds like a window will pop up with the &quot;passkey pin code&quot;. If this is the case, why did they state &quot;make a note of the passkey pin code BEFORE starting the set up process?
