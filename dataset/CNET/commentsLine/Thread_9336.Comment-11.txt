as to bob's question to you about nero and alcohol working together, i think(just listening to people that use them together) the answer is sometimes.
dvdshrink and nero work very well together.
another factor you might consider.
dvd burning (more so than cd) reinstituted the old problem of media compatibility.
you have to find what media works best on your machine(mine doesn't like sony) and then pick out the good quality from that list.
good luck.
