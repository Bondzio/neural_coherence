Hi Bob, The second part of your answer is exactly what I was asking for.
The thing is I don't have a ton of room and I wanted to ask the CNET community if they had any other suggestions for me.
I just found the bad caps yesterday so yes I am replacing them.
I live out in the country in Canada and it's not the easiest thing to just go and get something and try it.
I have ordered all different sizes of caps that I need and I will be trying them when they get here (likely up to two weeks) I was simply wanting to know if this was something I should try (yes I did spend a few hours googling this stuff) or if my monitors were likely to just be toast.
