You stated that you get eight options in your setup menu.
Those options probably have SUBMENUS in them.
Use the arrow keys to navigate through the menus, use the Enter key to select a menu or option.
Sometimes you may have to use the plus or minus keys to move items up or down a list.
Look for something that says: startup disk startup order boot volume boot disk boot order etc.
