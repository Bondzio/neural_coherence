I actually got someone knowledgable at XFX that agreed that I could basically get two 7900 GS cards for the price of one of the 8800 GTS cards and accomplish my objective.
And there's another benefit... apparently the 8800's are real power hogs, requiring one 500 watt power supply EACH!
The other issue I guess is the distinction between Extended Desktop and Desktop Spanning.
I was looking for Desktop Spanning, which is not possible with rotated displays I've been told.
Extended Desktop is able to rotate and use all 4, apparently, &quot;with a little tweaking&quot; but not as one continuous desktop.
