Hi, It is almost impossible to have that many faulty sectors on a HD and still being able to use it.
If it is working is is totally unreliable and I would replace it at once before you loose your data.
If you know sombody who own's &quot;spinrite&quot; you could run that to see what's going on.
If you have to buy spinrite, skip that and and spent the money on the new HD.
Cheers, Joseph.
