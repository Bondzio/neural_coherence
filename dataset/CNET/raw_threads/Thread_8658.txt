This system will be used for 3d graphics. I hope to configure a system that will be able to be upgraded with newer parts as prices fall in the future. I can't justify spending more than $1100. Can you computer gurus out there have a quick look and let me know if I am mismatching. OR, if you have any suggestions, I am more than happy and greatful to know what you think. Thanks allot guys! motherboard and cpu http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=5649918&amp;Sku=M69-7016 memory http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=40739&amp;csid=_61 graphics card http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4811223&amp;CatId=7387 hard drive http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=744346&amp;CatId=2459 optical drive http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=6078414&amp;CatId=1624 OS http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4864603&amp;csid=_61 power supply unit http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817182133 case http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811112154

The only other thing that gives me trepidation on the 7870 are the user comments about it not being recognized by the mobo. This is my first build so I am kind of nervous about the assembly stage.
