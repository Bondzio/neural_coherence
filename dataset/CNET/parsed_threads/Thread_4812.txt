<s> VOIP gurus, I am thinking of to buy own VOIP adapter but I can not decide which one to buy. </s>
<s> I will use this to get VOIP service ( either free or minimal $) for my home as 2nd line for long distance. </s>
<s> I will prefer with more hardware features to avoid any tech problem if I have to transfer from one provider to another. </s>
<s> My Budget is around $70. </s>
<s> I am stuck with HandyTone 286,386 or Sipura 1001,2002. </s>
<s> TIA. </s>
<s> -from Houston </s>
<s> I have been using VOIP for a while and I have used a couple different models. </s>
<s> I strongly recommend the 2100. </s>
<s> It is small and it has a built in router. </s>
<s> This will save you a lot of headaches. </s>
<s> You can find a review on the companies man website http://www.sipura.com/products/spa2100.htm I went to this site http://www.igonet.com/default.aspx?loc=us&pin=12380 and got the 2100 and you can get one month of unlimited calling in North America for around $70 dollars. </s>
<s> After that it is only 23.95 a month, check it out. </s>
<s> On the flip side if you don't wont to use there voip service cancel and it and keep the router. </s>
<s> Win-Win!! </s>
