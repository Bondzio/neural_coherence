1.1.1	I keep my PC on at all times except when there is a major lightning storm , when I do turn it off .	St
1.1.2	As an Electrical Engineer I feel by leaving the PC ON keeps the electronics at a more uniform temperature and eliminates the surges that occur when turning it ON .	St
1.1.3	Possibly turning it OFF overnight would not be to bad , but it is saving a minimal amount of KWHr to be left OFF .	St
1.1.4	Turning it OFF/ON for several times a day is not very good for the electronics .	St
1.2.1	I highly agree about this -- further reasons -- the heating and cooling effect of turning on and off your computer can cause solder joints to & quot ; dry out & quot ; making them less conductive , and brittle .	St
1.2.2	This causes easy breakability , and overall unstability of your computer .	St
1.2.3	So it is definately worth the extra dollar a month to keep your computer running .	St
1.3.1	Hi , Sciencebook .	St
1.3.2	It 's arguable ( very ) whether it 's better for YOU to keep it on or off .	St
1.3.3	But in terms of energy demand ( and we 're going back into what was once called an & quot ; energy crisis & quot ; ) and global warming , the answer is simple -- TURN IT OFF !	St
1.3.4	Furthermore , if you 're on a network or broadband , the increased risk of someone sneaking in an open port and doing nasty things with the computer again outweigh the arguable benefit in longevity .	St
