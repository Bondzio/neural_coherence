1.1.1	I have a motherboard ( ASUS P4PE-x ) that supports PC3200 , which gives the machine a faster front side bus ( fsb ) .	St
1.1.2	I originally began with a single PC2700 - 512 RAM .	St
1.1.3	I bought two 256 RAM sticks of PC3200 , and removed the PC2700 .	St
1.1.4	My question now is , I have three slots for memory , can I run PC3200 w/PC2700 ?	Ques
1.2.1	it will operate at the 333mhz rate .	St
1.2.2	this if course given it 's the same kind of ram just different speeds .	St
1.3.1	What does the book that came with your ASUS P4PE-x say ?	Ques
1.3.2	You can put different speeds in , but they will all run at the slower speed .	St
1.3.3	John	St
1.4.1	Never miss match ram !	St
1.4.2	It defeats the purpose !	St
1.4.3	Sell the pc2700 on ebay and buy pc3200 to match what you have .	St
1.4.4	Better yet I would look for three sticks of 512 at 3200 that match .	St
1.4.5	More bang for your bucks !	St
