<s> I'm trying to set up a wireless home network. </s>
<s> I have connected the router and modem to my desktop and we have two laptops:one is wireless and the other on eis not, I have to use the USB wireless adaptor. </s>
<s> I set up the network and the wireless laptop already receives the signal. </s>
<s> (I haven't set up my other lap top) At first, the internet works on both my desktop and the wireless laptop. </s>
<s> But a few minutes later, the connection gets &quot;lost&quot; and then I'm not able to connect to the internet anymore using the wireless connection. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thank You- </s>
<s> like the Forum Sticky suggests. </s>
<s> This will fix your connection from dropping. </s>
<s> Also 2.4gh cordless phones use the same frequencies as your wireless router and you can and will get disconnected if using one. </s>

<s> Try reinstalling the USB wireless adapter at your laptop. </s>
<s> Do you get its icon at the system tray (near the clock) ? </s>
<s> Do you get any pop up messages ? </s>
