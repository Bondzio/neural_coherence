I believe both the razer barracuda headset, and sound blaster fatal1ty pro are mono, it seems to fit in perfectly as well.
Also, it worked for the longest time, about 2-3 years, and 2 months after I bought the new computer (still using the same sound card and headset).
This is the oddest problem I've seen
