<s> I need a recommendation on a program for scanning my hard drives for any sort of surface damage. </s>
<s> I've been hearing a noise from time to time on my 2nd hard drive sort of a squeaking noise and I'm worried it might be something wrong. </s>
<s> What make drive? </s>
<s> Many makers offer such software. </s>
<s> While I could note some names I prefer to start with the maker's offerings first. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The model is a WD Caviar SE16 500gb I checked out the page on there site and downloaded a data lifeguard program, but it said it was incompatible with vista. </s>
<s> &quot;The DOS version is required if installing a hard drive in a new system without existing operating system support.&quot; We can use that since you might have Vista 64 bit (do you?) </s>
<s> You may have to change a BIOS setting to enable booting from CD or even emulate IDE over SATA but this is their test tool. </s>
<s> http://support.wdc.com/product/download.asp?groupid=603&lang=en shows this version. </s>
<s> There is also some confusion where a person does not try the Windows version on Vista 32 bit. </s>
<s> I found that to work fine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The nice thing about the free version of http://www.hdtune.com 's free version is that it won't let you do anything dangerous. </s>
<s> On some drive/controller configurations it won't display the SMART attributes; but, the error scan will simply read the entire drive at the sector level. </s>
<s> It will take over an hour to check a 500GB drive; but, even one red box is notice of impending failure and I recommend running it about once a year for safety. </s>
<s> I'll tryout HDTune davis. </s>
<s> Thanks Bob for trying to help me out too. </s>

<s> I want to get a second opinion from there program, but don't understand how to use it. </s>
<s> I am running 64bit vista. </s>
<s> NWCDEX was the MSCDEX equivalent from DR-DOS. </s>
<s> But now I read it is part of Partition Magic. </s>
<s> But it had to do with mounting and reading a CD in DOS. </s>
<s> So please tell more. </s>
<s> What program do you mean? </s>
<s> What do you want to do with it? </s>
<s> And a link to releevant info (like a manual, if possible) on the Internet, please </s>
<s> On the dos screen it says nwcdex.exe needs me to specify a driver name. </s>
<s> The program I was trying to use is called Data Lifeguard Tools from Western Digital the windows version didn't work so I was going to try the dos, but there seems to be a problem running this too. </s>
<s> Here is a link to there page http://support.wdc.com/product/download.asp?groupid=613&lang=en </s>
<s> I was trying to install the wrong tool. </s>
<s> What I needed was the Diagnostics program it installed without a problem. </s>
<s> I can be so silly at times. </s>
<s> Thanks everybody for helping me out and sorry for wasting time. </s>
<s> The questions were fine and with a little trial and effort on your part you found which tool they offered that worked. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> GRC's SpinRite is the best disk tool there is for surface and read/write errors. </s>
<s> It costs 80 bucks, but it's worth it for all it does. </s>
<s> I would like to thank all you guys for your postings,I had NO idea such utilities existed,I had a problem with my HD few weeks ago,where the error message said &quot; No operating system installed &quot; I have since got the drive working again,at the cost of losing all my photo's etc,and although I had backed up with CD, I had still lost a great deal that I had not had time to back-up. </s>
<s> Having downloaded the freebie suggested, I find my HD is in good health,and NO I will not download a Reg-cleaner again,as I think this caused the problem {:o( Manny </s>
<s> If you're hearing squeeking from a HD, it's not scraping from the surface. </s>
<s> HD platter surfaces are extremly sensitive, if the heads crashed on a platter it'd likely ruin the entire drive. </s>
<s> To check a drive, right-click the drive icon, click on Properties, then on the Tools tab. </s>
<s> Click on Error Checking to test for bad sectors and other problems. </s>
<s> As you now know, there's more extensive checking programs, but you were concernend about surface damage and this'll check for that. </s>
<s> hard drive noise is a sure sign of a problem. </s>
<s> I'd suggest you replace it and in a hurry. </s>
