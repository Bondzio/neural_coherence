If you have an Nvidia card running Forceware drivers, you may be able to unlock an integrated OC called Coolbits. I have a 5700LE OC'ed to over 100MHz from stock core and mem on stock cooling. To unlock Coolbits: 1. Open the Start\Run dialog box, and type Regedit and hit OK 2.Browse to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\NVIDIACorporation\Global\NvTweak\ 3.Then right click and go to New and choose DWORD Value 4. Rename the DWORD value the comes up to CoolBits(without quotes) 5. Right click on it to Modify it 6. And then change the value to 3 and the base to Decimal Once you do this, go back to your nVidia control panel. You should see some new options. One of these options is Clock Frequency Settings. Select this, click Manual Overclocking and then hit Detect Optimal Frequencies. Ive found this to be fairly reliable. However use this at your own discretion. Keep on eye on temperatures in your case. For ATI cards, I suggest using the lastest Omega Drivers with ATI tool or ATI Tray Tools for OCing. Check Tweakguides.com for more info.

Search enthusiast sites and forums (anandtech.com, hothardware.com, guru3d.com, beyond3d.com, etc.) since they'll be the ones with the info. Locked pipes are sometimes present in 'baby-brothers' (next-to-the-top-of-the-line products) and product line 'refreshes' since they often use scaled back versions of the same GPUs. For example, the X1800GTO (product line refresh) has locked pipes but it's the same GPU as an X1800XT. Unlocking those pipes effetively turns a cheaper video card into its bigger brother. Pipes are unlocked with a 'soft-mod' that usually consists of flashing your card's bios with either a bios from another card or a hacked bios. A bad flash/bios can sometimes render a card useless, so watch the hardware sites and let others burn their fingers and figure out how to do it right before you jump into soft modding.
