Hi everyone, I have an HP Pavilion f1903 desktop with Windows XP, and while I was using it.. there was a blackout.. I did not have a battery backup.. the computer still turns on but it goes to a screen where it gives me choices on how to boot my computer such as &quot;safe mode&quot; &quot;normal setting&quot; etc.. but when i click one of these it just returns to the same screen.. how can i fix this.. [aside from getting a new pc] Help would be very much appreciated...
