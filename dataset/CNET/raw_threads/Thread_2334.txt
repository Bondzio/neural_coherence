I don't have a backup copy of boot disk. According to Symantec, I can use a Norton Antivirus Rescue Disk to clean this virus. However, I have to create a rescue disk from an uninfected PC having Norton Antivirus software. http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/eco.b.html Is it ok if I create this rescue disk set on a PC running a different windows o/s? I currently have Windows 98. Thanks in advance. SN.

For me, I make a virus free boot diskette (run win98se.exe from bootdisk.com) on a virus free machine, then boot that write protected diskette and type... FDISK /MBR The boot sector virus is now removed. BUT if it's in the OS or elsewhere, you still need to deal with that. Bob
