<s> Recently, I have begun looking into digital notepads. </s>
<s> However, all of them seem to require paper, which is something I definately don't want. </s>
<s> Some E-readers like the iLiad have got a similar function, but they are expensive, and I don't need the E-reader functions. </s>
<s> A PC-tablet is not an option, because I want it to function independantly from my laptop while still being able to see what I'm writing/doodling. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Wacom offers the Cintiq and Adesso offers the cybertablet. </s>
<s> I too am searching for a viable paperless option. </s>
<s> Good luck in your search. </s>
<s> I am looking for like a digital etch n sketch. </s>
<s> Just something I can use word on and doodle with. </s>
<s> Thats all. </s>
<s> I want to see what im doing with out paper. </s>
<s> If anyone knows of any please let me know. </s>
<s> If you're still looking for something I'd recommend checking out the Infinity Binder (www.theinfinitybinder.com). </s>
<s> It's very cheap and works easily with and android/ios smartphone or tablet. </s>
