1.1.1	I purchsed an HP system at Sam's clug several months ago.	St
1.1.2	The monitor has had a flicker from the beginning, which is getting worse.	St
1.1.3	I have tried everything in HP help and nothing seems to correct the problem.	St
1.1.4	I have heard of the blackout problem.	St
1.1.5	Is this the way this problem starts?	St
1.2.1	If its just flickering reduce the hertz to 60 and see if that works Right click on desk top, then properties,then setting,advanced, monitor.	St
1.2.2	there you should see screen refreshing rate.	St
1.2.3	Set it at 60 hertz and see if it helps.	St
1.2.4	When it starts blacking out you will know because after about 1 minute when the computer turns on the monitor will blackout	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the &quot;reduce the hertz&quot; messege.	St
1.3.2	It was at 60HZ when the flicker began, and as it worsened.	St
1.3.3	I changed it to 75HZ yesterday and it worked fine for about a day, then began flikcering again.	St
1.3.4	I begins slowly and gets worse.	St
1.3.5	Sometimes the screen turns red and there are lines across the screen.	St
1.3.6	Any other suggestions?	St
1.4.1	just by chance is they a light next to them monitor or your speakers next to it.	St
1.4.2	That may cause the monitor to flicker too	St
