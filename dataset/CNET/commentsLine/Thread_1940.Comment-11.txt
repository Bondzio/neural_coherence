when i tested the rx600 at best buy i too found it took forever too.
this was a big deterrant for me.
i don't have a lot of patients when it comes for waiting for printing time.
the printing quality was better on the rx 600 but that was because the photo quality print cartridge was not installed in the hp.
and i have been told that that makes a huge difference.
two different best buy's employees recommended the hp 2610 based on their experience with each machine in the store.
it turned out that the rx600 was returned more often and ran out of ink quicker.
i also liked the fact that the hp offers a fax.
i haven't been able to set up my 2610 because they have been doing a lot of work in my home.
when i get to use it i will post my feedback.
ps.
i do not ever see myself purchasing another lexmark... i don't need to learn that lesson a third time.
