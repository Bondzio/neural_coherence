My old computer fried a capacitor, when I got my new computer and put my old wireless network card in, everything booted up and the wireless was searching for a signal.
Without the antenna attached, the computer works fine.
As soon as I plug in my antenna and click refresh list, my computer reboots.
Any suggestion?
Thanks
