He didn't have the software but said I could get it off the internet. I downloaded the driver and installed. Now the buttons on the new mouse work but when I try and move the cursor it won't register. Also, the mouse wheel on my old mouse won't work anymore. What should I do? And where can I get drivers, I think this might not be the right one. Thanks in advance.
