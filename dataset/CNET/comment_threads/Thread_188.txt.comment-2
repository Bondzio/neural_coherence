I figured out a bit more about my problem.
It almost has to be a problem stemming from a large electrical storm that happened yesterday, which I'm certain damaged my previous router, which I've since replaced with a new WNR2000.
The old router and surge protector is gone, but I still cannot connect via wired or wireless.
Perhaps this sheds more light on the problem.
