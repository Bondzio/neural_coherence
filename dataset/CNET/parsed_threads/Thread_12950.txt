<s> My grandmother has a four year old system that i built for her with a biostar motherboard(cheap). </s>
<s> Up until recently it has ran smooth. </s>
<s> Now her intergrated graphics card acts as if it is disabled. </s>
<s> The computer will start up but the monitor will never turn on. </s>
<s> I ran a test to see if it was the card by installing a new card in the PCI. </s>
<s> It worked, so i pluged the monitor back into the original intergrated card. </s>
<s> Now it works. </s>
<s> It is like by pluging up the PCI card awakened the old one. </s>
<s> [It is kinda like when a PCI card quits working and you can move it to another slot to make the comcuter recognize it again.] </s>
<s> But now the card has quit working again and it is too much a pain to keep pluging in this PCI card to get the old intergrated one to work. </s>
<s> And she lives nearly 2 hrs away, which makes it a pain. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what causes a computer to not recognize an intergrated graphics card? </s>
<s> It doesn't make any sense to me. </s>
<s> However, i was told that she has had some kids fooling around with her computer at her office. </s>
<s> Can this be more of a software problem? </s>
<s> Tyler </s>
<s> Umm, not too sure?.... </s>
<s> maybe if you play with the bios or even restart it (take out the CMOS battery) prehaps a bit of compressed air over in your PCI/AGP/DIMM slots?.... </s>
<s> I'll keep my fingers crossed for you! </s>
<s> It is a chip located on the mobo. </s>
<s> Frequently it is part of the basic chipset. </s>
<s> If you could give us the model of the mobo we might be able to find a little about the video. </s>
<s> Normally one can download the manual for the mobo for the manual from the mfr's website. </s>
<s> Cheap in solid state does NOT necessarily mean crappy. </s>
<s> It takes a lot of effort to make crappy solid state devices. </s>
