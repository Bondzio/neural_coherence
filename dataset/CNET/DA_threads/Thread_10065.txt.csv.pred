1.1.1	operating system is XP home edition and the printer is a Lexmark X73.	St
1.1.2	i've loaded software on a new drive after having problems with an old one.	St
1.1.3	before having problems with the drive, the printer in question worked fine.	St
1.1.4	i have tried to install the printer using 2 methods.	St
1.1.5	one is to use the disk provided with the printer.	St
1.1.6	the other is to use a downloaded install procedure from Lexmark.	St
1.1.7	after installing, using either method, i can print.	St
1.1.8	my problem is that after a shutdown/startup, i can only restart in safe mode and restore to a time before the printer was installed.	St
1.1.9	I've been sending emails back and forth to lexmark for three weeks with no useful suggestions.	St
1.1.10	does anyone have a suggestion besides buying a new printer which i'm about to do.	Ques
1.1.11	thanks in advance, geneg	Polite
1.2.1	Your adding a new HD may be culprit.	St
1.2.2	If you cloned system drive do a Windows XP repair.	St
1.2.3	If that doesn't work, re-install XP.	St
1.2.4	Let us know.	St
1.2.5	and life goes on... Jack	St
