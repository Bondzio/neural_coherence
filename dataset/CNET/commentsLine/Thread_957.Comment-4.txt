since we don't want to replace the dsl modem, i see from your link it does support &quot;setting up bridging (rfc1483)&quot; you can do that and use a wifi router of your choice (again, many names are one is just like the next.)
or you can check out this forum's sticky about post 18 where we use more than one wifi router.
