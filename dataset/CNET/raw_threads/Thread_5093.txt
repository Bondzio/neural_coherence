My apps will reside on the tab and all other data will reside on the card so I don't want to over buy for my needs. Can someone tell me what would suffice for my needs? Thanks, Mike

Not a deal breaker if I ever wanted to change it to a class 10 if the price was right. Plus it could serve as a memory stick for a few dollars.
