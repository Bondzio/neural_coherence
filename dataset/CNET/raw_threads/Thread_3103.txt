My question is what is the equivalent of Motherboard in the older generation computers (like the 1st Gen computers) ??? I heard it was vacuum tubes. If so, I would like to know how they performed the function of a motherboard. Thanks in advance.

Later these advanced to such as the VMEBUS http://duckduckgo.com/?q=vmebus+backplane and for the personal computers the S-100 was very common. With the Apple 1 you see the beginnings of the motherboard where the computer was small enough to be put directly on the backplane. Bob

If anything these were dedicated devices, etc. that did a task in/out or to process. Those computers that were mechanical and/or before anything transistors were mostly in the 50-60's era. There were modules at best or wirewrap to include backplanes, black boxes or PCB's mounted on busses which are concidered backplanes. Also, tubes found on older computers may have been power related rather than logic. Google for computer museums, even WWII era ultra enigma decoders. However, don't confuse analog computers to what was the 1st electrical or non-mechanical type computers. http://www.computerhistory.org/ tada -----Willy
