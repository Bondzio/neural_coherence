a copy of it from the pc chips site.. no use getting it if you are not going to use raid.
i assume that you will install the operating system on the pide drive [p = parallel, as opposed to sata ide].
if that is so you can wait to install the mobo drivers that will allow you to use the sata ports when you get s sata drive.
if you were going to install to a sata there is a step in the xp installation that allows you to install the sata/raid/scsi et al drivers.otherwise you can install all of the mobo drivers after xp is installed.
the xp cd will allow you to partiton the drive, format the partitons, choose to format in fat32 or ntfs.
if you use fat 32 and format using mthe xp cd you are limited to a 32 gb partition for each logical drive in fat 32. if you have a large drive and want a fat32 partiton larger than 32 gb you then format using a boor floppy abd fdisk and format.
you can then install xp on the partition when the install cd sees the partiton.
