<s> I've contacted soundblaster to no avail. </s>
<s> Yesterday I installed a few things into my pc (wireless card and xp SP2) didnt notice the problem until i installed everything. </s>
<s> The external hub isn't getting any power it seems. </s>
<s> The sound card works fine, but nothing works on the box, and none of the inputs are available in windows. </s>
<s> I really have no clue whats going on with it. </s>
<s> I googled it up most of today without finding any information or support for the hub, i've tried the diagnostic program, updated all of my software/drivers, nothing has worked so far. </s>
<s> The product has worked fine for about a year now, anybody here had a similar problem? </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> What does Device Manager tell you about the hardware? </s>
<s> Any question marks or exclamation points? </s>
<s> If they show to be installed and working properly, you may have to get help from the Mfg. </s>
<s> under sound video and game controllers, nothing has any problems. </s>
<s> Under &quot;other devices&quot; there is a &quot;multimedia audio controller&quot; listed with a question mark next to it, however i dont know what that is. </s>
<s> I dont think the hub is listed, the things listed are: -Audio codecs -Creative game port -creative sb audigy 2 zs (wdm) -legacy audio drivers -legacy video capture devices -media control devices -standard game port -video codecs </s>
<s> Somewhat obvious is that SP2 may have bumped out the Audigy. </s>
<s> To test I would uninstall SP2. </s>
<s> I uninstalled windows SP2, that didnt work. </s>
<s> Since you've uninstalled SP2, I would uninstall the device, then re-install. </s>
<s> I'm not sure about the Multimedia Device with the question mark. </s>
<s> Could be onboard audio, or may be related to the sound card. </s>
<s> I always try to eliminate all question marks by reinstalling. </s>
<s> I'm unsure if this will solve the problem, but it's easy enough to try. </s>
<s> ive figured it out, i bumped the power connector loose from the sound card when i was installing another card </s>
<s> i have the same problem, but all of my power connections are secure. </s>
<s> can you recall any of the help creative gave you on the problem? </s>
<s> i have updated everything, and am running on the xp pro sp2 with an asus a7n8x. </s>
<s> i can't think of anything else, and i am sick of waiting for creative to respond to my tech support request. </s>
<s> i use more features on the external hub than anything else, and would greatly appreciate any help anyon can give me.... the only thing i havent checked is continuity on the firewire part of the cable to the external hub, as i don't have a cable tester for firewire cables, and my probes on my multimeter are too large to fit in the slot on the end of the cable. </s>
<s> thanks for any help you can give me </s>
<s> this problem started occuring when my computer goes into stanby over night (cuz i run the puter 24/7 for online game hosting) and the first couple times it occured a simple reboot was all that was required to fix the problem. </s>
<s> now nothing i do seems to help. </s>
<s> thanks again for any help any of you can give me </s>
<s> it was a really simple solution, the power cable to the soundcard wasnt hooked up right. </s>
<s> silly me </s>
<s> i had a conflict with irq's, and had to move the internal card to another slot. </s>
<s> sounded like ******** to me when tech support told me to do it, but it worked. </s>
<s> had to reinstall all the drivers too. </s>
<s> on the upside, i finally found out how to get my optical spdif to put out more than just a stereo signal... woohoo! </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> Hey UltimateDave I was having the same trouble but the guy from SB told me to ensure the converter cable was plugged into the card and he was right (it wasn't). </s>
<s> Now the hub has power but I don't know what to do with it. </s>
<s> The remote doesn't seem to work..... </s>
<s> I mainly bought it for the card </s>
