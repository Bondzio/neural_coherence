There was no error message or any kind of warning. Rarely it would restart by itself, but usually it wouldn't. And the strange thing was, I couldn't restart it at the CPU casing unless I turn off the main switch at the 3-pin power outlet socket at the wall of my room, wait for a while, switch it on again and then restart my PC. I sent it to the computer shop for diagnostic, and the technician there said the hard disc was dead and I had to get a new one. I did, and my PC worked perfectly fine for around two weeks. Now it started to turn itself off again, exactly like before, randomly and frequently. I sent it to the computer shop again, but it wouldn't turn off itself there!! The technician switched it on for one whole day and nothing happened. As soon as I brought it back to my room (university hostel), the problem occurs, whether my Windows XP Pro had been loaded or not. I scanned for viruses and errors using Norton Systemworks, but there was none and my Firewall is up and running. The temperature never exceed 45 Celsius. I've also disabled every auto-off or auto-restart functions of the PC, but it still turn itself off ( &gt;10 times a day ). I even got some technician to check the power outlet in my room. Nothing's wrong with it.Please help.

Do you have a surge protector between the computer and the wall outlet? You may want to try a UPS (Uninterruptable Power Supply) to see if you are getting voltage dips/spikes. If you do get a UPS, make sure the voltage rating is sufficient for your computer and don't plug your printer, especially laser printers, into it. If that doesn't remedy the problem, you have either a faulty power supply or mobo. computerdag

I'm no expert however, I suffered similar problems in that my comp, without warning, would switch itself off completely and then restart and boot to the welcome screen as if nothing had happened. I persevered for around three months until I could take it no more. I checked all my wiring connections inside my comp to start - no probs there! I did a virus scan - no probs there! I changed my RAM - still had the problem. Then I changed my PSU from a FSP 250-60 GTA (250W) to a Jeantech 400W (30 from PC World) - Problem cured!!! Since changing the PSU (it has been running for around two months now) I have not experienced any more unexplained shutdowns. I hope this helps. Regards Daz
