Think over this one.
If you set the video refresh rate to 60 Hz, and your card tops out at 60 FPS, then a benchmark like you noted could give you low marks even though it was giving you a solid 60 FPS.
There was no need to generate more than that.
This is just one example of how a benchmark is flawed.
