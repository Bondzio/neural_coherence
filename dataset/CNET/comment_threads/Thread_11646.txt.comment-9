over repetitive given the other answers you have already received.
Life is simpler when you go from socket to socket (or patch panel) for wall wiring.
RJ45 receptacles are easy to connect to the wires.
OTOH RJ45 plugs and crimping are a b**** to deal with, so use ready made patch cords from wall to switch and the PC.
Good luck.
