for a while i wanted an lcd monitor as i liked the space & weight saving, lower energy and heat but was put off by people saying crt will always be better for gaming due to refresh rates among other factors and cost.
i used to play half life on my old sony laptop and it was quite horrible-all that ghosting!
but last year i got a new pc so it was a perfect opportunity to try lcd and i was impressed as they have improved nowadays.
now mines got 13ms refresh rate (which shouldnt't always be the deciding issue) and was really impressed by the picture as it wasnt really an expensive one and so i thought the performance wouldnt be great but i love it.
even though i dont play a lot of fast pc games (i've played half life and now i'm playing moh allied assault) i really cant complain, its ok for me as i'm not a hardcore pc gamer (i prefer consoles) who can pick out all the niggles.
now that lcds have even quicker sub 10ms response times they must be even better so go for it as you wont regret it unless you already made up your mind about crt.
almost forgot, they are great fro movies too!
