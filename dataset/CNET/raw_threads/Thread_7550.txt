I'm not sure if its my service provider Comcast limiting my broadband usage or what but its really annoying. My game lag will get progressively worse until I lose all connectivity and disconnect. Windows won't recognize that I've lost connectivity until I either reset the connection or unplug the connection. I won't be able to use the internet from anywhere from thirty seconds to two days. I'm using a brand new DI-634M wired/wireless router. There are two other computers connected through wireless that experience the same problem at the same time. The connection is protected. I have a feeling its something with Comcast though.
