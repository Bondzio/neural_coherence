<s> My daughters Compaq SR1130NX keeps rebooting. </s>
<s> I have replaced the hard drive and performed a complete recovery. </s>
<s> Windows xp came up fine, no problems until I tried to set up the internet connect. </s>
<s> In the middle of the process, the system rebooted. </s>
<s> This was a problem that I have had and thought it was tied to the OS. </s>
<s> I am starting to think it may be the processor. </s>
<s> This computer took a lighting strike last summer and I had to install a NIC to bring it back on line. </s>
<s> The computer is: Compaq SR1130NX AMD Athlon 3000 512 memory Note, I have replaced the ram as well, as I thought that might be the problem. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> You mean it never gets into Windows or it spontaneously reboots after running for X minutes or hours or what ? </s>
<s> Have you checked any of the system TEMPs ? </s>
<s> Thanks for responding. </s>
<s> It does go in to windows, but it seems to reboot every time i try to perform a task. </s>
<s> e.g., I try to set up the network connection or I try to check stats under my computer and all of a sudden the computer reboots. </s>
<s> I was having this problem before putting in the new hard drive and running recovery on it. </s>
<s> I thought I had it fixed when windows went through the entire new user start up process. </s>
<s> But it seems as though, whenever I tax the system, the computer reboots. </s>
<s> Could the temp files be bad if the entire system was restored? </s>
<s> Sorry, I don't know what the PSU stands for. </s>
<s> Is that the power suppy unit? </s>
<s> If so, that would make sense to me if it happened after a period of time, but this seems to be random. </s>
<s> tested the RAM using something like DocMem v3.2 or MemTest-86 ? </s>
<s> run scandisk to see if there any corrupt files on the hard disk ? </s>
<s> tested the hard drive with the mfg's diagnostic utility ? </s>
<s> I have replaced the ram and the hard drive. </s>
<s> Both are new as well, so I don't think that would be the problem. </s>
<s> I keep coming back to the processor. </s>
<s> Is there a way to &quot;load test&quot; the processor to see if it will cause the system to reboot? </s>
<s> I would replace it, but don't have a chip that will work in the socket. </s>
<s> I haven't run any of the tests that you recommeded. </s>
<s> Given that I have replaced both items and ran a recovery, should I run these tests? </s>
<s> or try running with cover off. </s>
<s> Then try a CPU test or two and see what that produces...watch the temps too. </s>
<s> ...turned out to be the CMOS battery dying. </s>
<s> Rebooted when the voltage dropped to 2.98v. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if this is related, but here's my story: Everything was working PERFECTLY on my friend's Compaq desktop, running Win2k. </s>
<s> We installed Google Desktop and started having spontaneous reboots. </s>
<s> We uninstalled Google Desktop, but now have new problems: All printers disappeared from Printers list. </s>
<s> Can't move desktop icons (as if they're locked). </s>
<s> Unable to copy & paste anything, in any program. </s>
<s> Unable to listen to streaming audio with WMP. </s>
<s> We have run all of these anti-spyware and anti-virus scans: PestPatrol, AdAware, HijackThis, Spybot S&D, Spyware Doctor, SpySweeper, Norton, AVG, Panda, TrendMicro, CW Shredder and RootKit Revealer, both while the HDD was in the computer, AND as an external drive connected to a clean computer. </s>
<s> Each scan revealed some issues. </s>
<s> After deleting the items it finds, the printers all reappear, desktop icons are movable, everything works again!....... </s>
<s> but then the spontaneous reboots start happening! </s>
<s> Apparently, we can't have it all. </s>
<s> The spontaneous reboots do not happen when we're in safe mode, so is it proper to assume that it's not a PSU issue? </s>
<s> We're running MemTest now to see if bad RAM might be an issue. </s>
<s> Or can we trace it all back to the installation of Google Desktop? </s>
<s> We THINK we deleted every trace of it, including all registry references. </s>
<s> Then again, maybe we missed something? </s>
<s> I was looking for some advice. </s>
<s> You were giving some advice to a guy trying to help his daughter. </s>
<s> I thought I might chime in and pick your brain. </s>
<s> My Compaq Deskpro at work keeps rebooting just before the login dialogue box. </s>
<s> I think that when I shut down the last time I may have shut down from the logon/login dialogue box. </s>
<s> Would that cause a problem. </s>
<s> Anyway it rebooted all night the other day. </s>
<s> I turned it off before I left work Saturday. </s>
<s> What I have tried. </s>
<s> Safe modes. </s>
<s> The computer will not go into any safe mode. </s>
<s> It begins to load, but before the logon dialogue box the computer reboots. </s>
<s> I never see windows only the progress bars. </s>
<s> Unplugging the hard drive and A: drive. </s>
<s> I have tried using the A Drive to reboot with floppies that I downloaded from bootdisks.com. </s>
<s> I can't get passed the administrator's logon line. </s>
<s> The administrator at work tried his password and it did not work. </s>
<s> My computer does not have a CD-ROM. </s>
<s> But maybe I can borrow one. </s>
<s> I got a page of advice for Windows ME, but this computer still has Windows NT 2000 Professional. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Perhaps driver of the modem, to the connection which u r trying to connect to the internet, is not supporting. </s>
<s> That might be the problem </s>
