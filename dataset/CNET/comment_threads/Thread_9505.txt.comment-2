From Apple, you can get http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=75A42EE8&nplm=M9319G%2FA which allows and RCA (yellow-video equivalent) or S-Video connection out to a TV/monitor... http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=6C04E07A&nplm=M9321G%2FB which allows you to connect a DVI cable - if your monitor/TV can use that connection... http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=6C04E099&nplm=M9320G%2FA which allows a VGA connection more commonly found on computer monitors but finding its way onto many of the better flat-screen LCD and plasma panels.
