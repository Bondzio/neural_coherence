my advice was &quot;everything i change to be as compatible with the most things.&quot; the advice at the top of this forum is well worn advice.
don't hide the ssid.
it's not adding security and in some setups folk find the connection drops out.
ok, ok yes this means there is some driver or other item that is showing there is a bug but it is our choice to &quot;go with what works and is secure.&quot; wpa has no ready exploit that we know.
yes there is that tool that you can run and then take a day's reading then pay for a cloud service to crack it in a few days but this is far beyond what your average kiddie will do since &quot;they have to pay for it.&quot; hope this helps and remember to try the latest router firmware too.
