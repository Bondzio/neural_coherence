1.1.1	I 'm in the process of either buying a new pc or building a new pc .	St
1.1.2	I just bought a camera and plan on buying mini DV camcorder to do some minor video editing .	St
1.1.3	I would like to use my pc to watch tv and perform other media related events .	St
1.1.4	I 'm not a pc gamer ...	St
1.1.5	I have a big screen and an X-box so I get my fill of games from that .	St
1.1.6	I 've never really built a pc before but I 've done some work inside the box before so I 'm pretty sure I can get the thing up and running , I 'm just not sure if its worth my time .	St
1.1.7	I know you pay more for a pc rather than buying it part for part but i 'm not too sure how much more and combine that with some of the service packages offered ... and what it really comes down to is I 'm just to lazy to price it out and see how much I will save if I build it myself .	St
1.1.8	Any thoughts or ideas would be appreciated .	St
1.1.9	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	I am not convinced that you can build much cheaper than you can buy for a general application PC .	St
1.3.2	Whether you can or not , you leave yourself open to a lot of warranty hassles if you build your own , because every manufacturer can point the blame at a component you bought from somewhere else .	St
1.3.3	There is also the issue of compatability among components as well .	St
1.3.4	My hat is off to all who want to buils their own , but even though I know I could do it , I have seen the hassles many have , and do n't need that grief .	St
1.4.1	I guess if I were enthusiastic enough I could build my own tv .	St
1.4.2	But why ?	Ques
1.4.3	Turn on your homebuilt and sparks fly and you wish you had had gone to the local store or just ordered online .	St
1.4.4	I let the guys at the assembly plant take the blame for an incompatible component .	St
