1.1.1	I am looking for portable desktop replacement notebook , for graphic design and Arts .	St
1.1.2	i have been looking at one mac notebook and two Gaming notebooks , the dell xps , the Alienware area51 , and the Mac powerbook .	St
1.1.3	I have an Imac G3 , and i am comfortable using both mac and PC .	St
1.1.4	Money is not an issue cause i want a good machine , wieght is not a problem cause i can use the workout , and battery life is not a problem cause i will buy an extra battery and mostly use it pluged in .	St
1.1.5	that said , I have been looking at the Area-51 because it seems to have the most memory and two optical bays .	St
1.1.6	it also has alot of customizing and seems to be a bit more upgradeable than most loptops .	St
1.1.7	so i am asking if a Gaming notebook which is for game graphics and such , is a good machine for Graphic Arts .	St
1.2.1	im interested on buying the m5700 .	Polite
1.2.2	it looks like a good laptop .	St
1.2.3	really nice video card ! besides the design is very very very sleek .	St
1.2.4	im sorry i dont know if its any good for graphic work as a fact but my opinion is that its excellent for it	Polite
1.3.1	well i recommend the Dell XPS M170 because , eben though you dont mind about battery or travel , it is a top of the line processor and probably equivalent to a P4 3.2 in many ways .	St
1.3.2	it also comes with the best graphics card out at the moment ( nVidia GeForce 7800 GTX ) and 2048 Mb DDR2RAM .	St
1.3.3	it has all the nessesary ports and 100Gb 7200Rpm Hard Drive and all the extras like bluetooth .	St
1.3.4	The Dell XPS Gen 2 ( the previous model of this machine ) was tested against the best alienware machine and the Dell won .	St
1.4.1	the customization .	St
1.4.2	Their top-of-the-line , the Area51 m770 can have 3.8GHz Processor ( desktop ) , 3GB of RAM ( 533Mhz ) , the GeForce 7800GTX , Dual Hard Drives ( Totaling about 200GB of 7,200RPM ) , Dual Optical Drives , and lots of extras ...	St
1.4.3	It seems faster than the Dell .	St
1.4.4	The only thing that worries me is the heat.. Hopefully , you may have a heat-resitant table around .	St
1.4.5	No , I 'm joking but these laptops CAN get rather hot and I 've read laptops on laps are not the best idea for men ... .I 'm not assuming are one , but I 'm just saying ... . Anways , to me the Alienware seems better .	St
1.5.1	The new Dell I hear is supposed to a be a graphical pwoerhouase .	St
1.5.2	Not that Alenware is bad , but I do think that the Dell XPS M140 or the Toshiba Qosmio G25-AV513 are better choices .	St
1.5.3	These are monsters that can do any graphics work you can throw at it and can play any game today .	St
1.5.4	I would prfer the Toshiba Qosmio over the Dell XPS M140 because the Qosmio comes with a TV tuner so you can watch T.V .	St
1.5.5	from your laptop , and overall it 's a gigantic media center pc with a host of media center functions .	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	You are talking about a dekstop and not a laptop .	St
1.8.1	Another reason to go with an alienware is because i believe they offer workstation laptops that have special professional grade video cards , these cards have some more advanced features over their consumer grade brethren but unfurtunatly they are a lot more expensive .	St
1.9.1	i 've got an alienware 5100m that i 've had for about a year and a half now .	St
1.9.2	it has held up quite well to my rough use and is quite quick as far as graphics go .	St
1.9.3	got the NVIDIA GeForce FX5700 128MB in it with a gig of ram and a 40GB 7200rpm drive .	St
1.9.4	only problem i 've had with it is i 've burned too many cd 's , screwing up the power calibration for burning .	St
1.9.5	but it was A LOT of cd 's , so i would n't expect this regularly .	St
1.9.6	customer support was even pretty helpful , even though my warranty had already expired .	St
1.10.1	How can I compare the Intel M processors to a P4 processor ?	Ques
1.10.2	I can not see any XPS notebooks at Dell with anything but the M processor and getting information from Dell is next to impossible .	St
1.10.3	Based on this experience alone , Im very leery of even getting involved with Dell .	St
1.11.1	If you get an XPS , you will get am exclusive number from Dell which well address your cusotmer needs .	St
1.11.2	This goes for desktops and notebooks .	St
1.11.3	If anything has an XPS you are allowed in this elitle group .	St
1.11.4	Anyway the difference between the P4 and an M is that the M is a fast notebook processor .	St
1.11.5	The M reduces size of a notebook and gives better battery life .	St
1.11.6	With a P4 in a notebook , you get a large mammoth laptop , that overheats alot ( it is a desktop processor ) and you barely get any battery life .	St
1.11.7	The P4 is basically a desktop processor in a notebook .	St
1.11.8	Do n't get a P4 , you are better off with an M .	St
1.12.1	Pentium M 's such as my XPS M170 's 2.23Ghz processor is capable of clocking at about the equivelant of a P4 3.6Ghz processor , but it largely depends on the aplication .	St
1.12.2	Obviously there 's no Hyper Threading technology on the & quot ; M & quot ; series and the FSB maxes out at 533mhz .	St
1.12.3	That 's because the & quot ; M & quot ; has a Pentium 3 architecture .	St
1.12.4	There are some really good articles on the net if you look closes that will give a more acurate technical description .	St
1.12.5	If you 're buying a laptop forget about getting one with a P4 .	St
1.12.6	It is too hot and you 'll get no battery life .	St
1.12.7	If you think you do n't need the battery , get a desktop .	St
