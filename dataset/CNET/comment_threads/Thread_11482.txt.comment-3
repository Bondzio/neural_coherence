I'm bringing this post back, because I'm trying something simliar.
I have a Dell Dimenson 8250 (desktop), a Inspiron 700m.
I hooked them both up to a 19'' LCD monitor using a Belkin KVM Switch.
I also use a wireless keyboard and monitor.
2 Problems.
The desktop computer looks great on the monitor, but the laptop only fills part of the screen...any thoughts?
Additionally, the wireless keyboard and mouse work fine on the desktop but not the laptop, I really want to be able to use the keyboard for both?
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks!
