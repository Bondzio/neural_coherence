My PC config is a AMD Sempron 2400++ Socket A 256 MB DDR PC 400 Inno 3d GeForce 4 MX 440 AGP 8x Kinda sucks cause the GF 4 cant play splinter cell because it dosent have a shader.. Im planning to upgrade my DDR and graphic card so please help me to choose between 6600/6600LE thanks....

As an indicator of just how badly anything lower than a 6600GT will do in Splinter Cell, and keeping with that same site, have a look : http://www.pcstats.com/ArtVNL.cfm?articleid=1983&page=7 Notice the 1024 x 768, Shader Model 3 scores? Using the frame rates as an indicator (Splinter Cell prefers cards with more RAM), go back to the other review and look for a game there which shows similar 6600GT scores. Gun Metal - Game 2 1600 x 1200 shows a slightly higher frame rate score for the 6600GT (20% more) than Splinter Cell...and look where the LE comes in (don't forget to substract 20%)! GB.

I ve upgraded my pc to a athlon x2 and a 2 gig ddr2 i have a Inno 3d 6200 pcie.. I think I could buy a 6800GT or a 7200... I think this would do the trick...

It could play all the latest games at nearly break neck speed. Though if you could go for, say a 7900gt or an x1800gto or x1900gt, then go for it.
