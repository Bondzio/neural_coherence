12833	0	8207	95687	NR	JodyWood	1/11/04 11:00 PM	1.073862E12	PC Diagnostic Tools	I am looking into purchasing some PC Diagnostic Tools, such as tools from Micro2000 ( http://micro2000.com/ ), Ultra-X ( http://www.uxd.com/ ), etc. Has anyone had experience with these tools? Are they worth buying? Any recommendations? Do you know of any reviews on these products? Thanks, Jody Wood

Much comes with trial / demo versions, which allow you to perform some tests though limited. I'm still researching. Any thoughts and references to these and other similar products would be awesome. Thanks in advance, Jody Wood

It is said that their diagnstic cards thoroughly eliminated the &quot;initial codes&quot; and solved problems like wrong codes, redundant codes and omitting codes, which greatly reduced guesswork in PC troubleshooting. Maybe you can have a try.
