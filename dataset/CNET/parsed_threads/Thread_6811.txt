<s> Hello everyone, I have a Sony Vaio F Series laptop (Model VPCF111FD/B) which runs Windows 7 and came with a Wireless N network adapter, Atheros AR9287. </s>
<s> I also purchased a TRENDnet 652 Wireless N router, for my home network. </s>
<s> When I look at my Wireless Connection Status, it has always shown my Speed as 54.0 Mbps. </s>
<s> I thought this was the speed of Wireless G? </s>
<s> Does anyone know how I may troubleshoot the network adapter or router to figure out why I am not connecting at Wireless N speeds? </s>
<s> I have ruled at range as an issue, and I believe my drivers are the most current. </s>
<s> I don't know what to check from here. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Look at the router setup, specifically the 802.11 mode, or something similar. </s>
<s> Most routers are selectable for the specific mode, B, G, or N. </s>
