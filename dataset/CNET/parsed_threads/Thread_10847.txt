<s> I had a quick question, will a AGP gfx card, specifically Radeon X1600 pro, fit in a PCI Express x16 slot? </s>
<s> I was thinking of purchasing the Gigabyte GA-P35-DS3L LGA 775 Intel P35 ATX. </s>
<s> Can anyone tell me if my current gfx card will fit in this mobo? </s>
<s> Thanks, Devin. </s>

<s> AGP and PCI-e are very different video cards, thus no go. </s>
