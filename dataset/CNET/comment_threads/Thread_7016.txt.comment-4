You wrote &quot; not open it so that anyone that can look into source &quot;.
That's a little muddy but for years folk have danced around and lost far too much time over trying to hide or obfuscate source in HTML.
Sorry but it's right there in all the web browsers I use if I view source.
The source code is in the clear.
It's a shame that the real goal seems hidden here.
Sometimes folk try to avoid revealing they want access to the files on that PC.
