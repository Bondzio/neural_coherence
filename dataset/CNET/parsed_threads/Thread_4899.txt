<s> I have an HP desk top with a 80GB hard drive, I want to upgrade to a larger hard drive and also wanted to be able to use the system disks I created when I bought the computer so that the programs that were installed on the computer would still be there. </s>
<s> I have never done this before so I thought I might contact HP and ask if it was possible to do this. </s>
<s> They asured me that it was possible as long as the new hard drive ran the same rmps as the old one. </s>
<s> They told me if the rpms were not the same I would not be able to use my system recovery disks that I created from the computer. </s>
<s> They then tried to sell me a external hard drive which I was really not interested in. </s>
<s> I want to upgrade to a larger hard drive but I want an internal one. </s>
<s> I just wanted to ask if any one knows that this might be true and what has the rpms got to do with my system disks. </s>
<s> The hard drive I now have is an 5400 rpm and I did look at the new one I wanted to buy and it said it was 7200 rpm..Would it be better for me to buy an external hard drive. </s>
<s> I don't want to go into the expense of a new hard drive and then not be able to use my system disks..Thank you, Wright5972 </s>
<s> I have built and upgaded many of systems and never heard that upgrading your hard drive to higher RPMs would cause a problem. </s>
<s> The easiest thing to do would be to clone the drive you have now and copy that image to the new drive. </s>
<s> OK, how do I clone a hard drive? </s>
<s> Given the limitation stated by HP...why not just add a decent size 7,200 RPM as a second internal hard drive ? </s>
<s> Get at 7200 rpm drive with at least 8MB cache. </s>
<s> You can download the free HD cloning utility from the HD maker if the utility isn't included with the new dreve. </s>
<s> The cloning utility copies the image of the old HD to the new HD. </s>
<s> clone or what???? </s>
<s> I downloaded hdclone and it has partitioning capablitlies I just don't know which to do first. </s>
<s> Just a word of caution. </s>
<s> Not sure what OS you are running. </s>
<s> If you are using any of the OS that needs Microsoft activation, moving the OS to a new hard drive may cause the OS not to work (MS think that you are installing the OS to another PC). </s>
<s> This may be the reason why HP is giving you the warning of RPM different. </s>
<s> You need to call MS to reactivate the system for you. </s>
<s> For simpilcity, I'll just add a new internal or external (USB) HD. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> 1) You want to scrap the 80gb hard? </s>
<s> Otherwise, why not keep the OS and 80g HD? </s>
<s> You can do both you know. </s>
<s> The 80gb would be your c: and the additional Drive would be a storage D: Installation is easy and you can even format the new drive using your existing C: windows drive. </s>
<s> Also, you should note on your HP, there is a sticker with the license number. </s>
<s> If you had to install your OS again. </s>
<s> This number would be what you use. </s>
<s> In the rare case Microsoft gives you a hard time. </s>
<s> A phone call to their customer support will take care of it. </s>
<s> Not sure if you wanted to replace the drive. </s>
<s> In that case you will want to back up the information you want. </s>
<s> Obtain an OS disk(that matches your current version) and do a fresh install. </s>
<s> That is the easiest sure fire method. </s>
<s> Cloning a drive as stated earlier, can cause license issues. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> So I wanted a bigger drive cause I have a lot of music,pixs and games. </s>
<s> Plus when I do install some of the games the files or part of them go to the C drive which eats up more space. </s>
<s> That is the reason why I want to go to a bigger drive. </s>
<s> I haven't attempted the clone because I still haven't had my ? </s>
<s> answered about the partition. </s>
<s> The C drive is partitioned into a D drive. </s>
<s> I am trying to find out what to do in this and whether I will need to partition the new drive or not. </s>
<s> This part of puters I am still new at. </s>
