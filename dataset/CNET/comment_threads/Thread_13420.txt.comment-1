I am looking for a wireless router for my sister, who would not know the first thing about setting one up, so I'm trying to find one that's easy to set up.
In my own experience, I've found Netgear to be pretty easy &amp; quick.
I've never had problems with them and they work great for me, however I always buy the more expensive, feature-rich routers.
She doesnt' want to spend much and she only wants one to be able to connect her Nook Color via wi-fi to download books.
She probably wouldn't need dual band, though in my opinion it wouldn't hurt to have it.
I've read a few reviews on some Belkins where people said they were easy, but I've never used a Belkin myself.
I know Netgear is good as long as it comes with the easy set-up disc, but I think she wants to spend less.
Does anyone have any suggestions?
