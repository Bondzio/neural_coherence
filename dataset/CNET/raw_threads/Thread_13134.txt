I checked the box that enabled cd burning and it still would not coppy...i even tried to update drivers but there were no new drivers. Any suggestions? ohh i ran Nero Tool Info and it said ASPI files are missing.does that have anything to do with it? (WNASPI32.DLL) n/a and (WINSAPi.DLL n/a I thought of the ASPI files because i did the trouble shoot thing and it said somthing about them. On the nero tool thing it has a drop box that has system ASPI, and Nero ASPI. I am missing system ASPI, but it says nero ASPI is installed and working properly Nero ASPI = (wnaspi32.dll version 2.0.1.74)

I looked at the link you sent for the download and it said to put it in the nero folder...what one do i put it in? i reinstalled nero 7 and still not working. should i uninstall my cd/dvd rw drivers? if so do i just click uninstall and when i restart my computer they will install themselves? This is really annoying. is it possible since i installed nero 7 ultra, that it cause a messup in my burner?

I have been having troubles, at odd times, burning to dvd discs. I read your posts about the ansi files, and I also get the report &quot;ansi files are missing&quot;. How did you get the replacements, and did it help? I also had problem burning to cd's, but the issue was resolved by clicking the check box to allow burning to cd's. Like I said, my burning problems are hit and miss, sometimes it works, sometimes it don't. Can't burn a mpeg in media center, for instance. Oh, I thought it was a Samsung burner and installed a Samsung automatic upgrade program, but it reported my burner an &quot;odd&quot; configuation and said it wasn't supported. No new firmware for this particular model is available. Our version number is G04 and firmware update from Samsung is TS06. I don't know anything about firmware and such. I just suspect the 6522 has a &quot;generic&quot; version of the Samsung burner and don't think it is supported.

If the ASPI driver is outdated, isn't installed correctly, or is damaged, Adobe Audition returns an error when you try to rip CD audio&lt;br&gt; clay smith says: ok clay smith says: is there a way i can fix this? Ava_EMC0142 says: Try to Install the Adobe Audition ASPI Driver Patch. &lt;br&gt;Download and install the Adobe Audition ASPI Driver Patch available from the Adobe website at www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=2517 . Be sure to follow the installation instructions as provided. &lt;br&gt; Just go to (www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=2517) and download the the aspi thing and install it. If you have nero it says to reinstall it too.

Only &quot;Adobe&quot; a search comes up with is Adobe Acrobat. I assume that is the program you use to create DVD's? My 6522 came with Cyberlink Power DVD to perform that function. So I guess going to Adobe would be fruitless for me. Thanks for trying though.
