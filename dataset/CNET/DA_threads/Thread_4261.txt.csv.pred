1.1.1	When I insert a blank DVD to burn , the burning process does not start right away .	St
1.1.2	I have a delay of between 5 minutes and 2 hours before the process starts .	St
1.1.3	This is after clicking burn , with the burn window open , buffer is at 100 % , CPU usage at 0 % .	St
1.1.4	Happens with both Alcohol and Nero , any burn software I try .	St
1.1.5	Tried turning off anti-virus , firewall , closing all programs and still occurs - but does not occur when I reboot and burn the DVD prior to opening any programs ( other than start-up items ) .	St
1.1.6	Running XP , all updates etc .	St
1.1.7	recent fresh install ( to see if that fixed the problem ) .	St
1.1.8	An odd note is that when this occurs , the window that pops up asking what you want to do with the DVD you just inserted pops up a long time after the DVD was inserted - like it takes a long time for Windows to see it has a new DVD .	St
1.1.9	But any program that uses the DVD ( other than burning ) works right away .	St
1.1.10	Any thoughts ...	Polite
