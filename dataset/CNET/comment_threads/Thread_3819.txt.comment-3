Thanks for the help, but I've already tried that to no avail (indeed, if someone had configured their router as an access point, they'd not want that setting removed every time they performed a factory reset).
How can I find the IP address?
Using ipconfig in windows (or ifconfig in Ubuntu) will only show my modem's WAN IP - not my router's LAN IP - suggested (as I suspect &quot;access mode&quot; implies) that the connection is effectively bypassing the routing function entirely, and treating the router as a simple (if quite expensive) ethernet switch.
Does anyone have any experience of using a Belkin F5D8236, or indeed of switching off access-point mode in any router once enabled?
