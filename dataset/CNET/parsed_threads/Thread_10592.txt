<s> I have a somewhat old computer (a Dell XPS 410) I'm looking to add a bit more RAM to. </s>
<s> I was flipping through the owner's manual and found that it takes dual-channel 533-, 667- or 800MHz DDR2 RAM. </s>
<s> How can I be sure that's what I should get or should I take the manual's word for it? </s>
<s> I'm also wondering about the 'limit' of memory it states in the manual, which is listed as 4GB. </s>
<s> Once again, how can I be sure that's all I can put in it or should I again take the manual's word for it? </s>
<s> And a bit of a silly question, but I feel I should ask - Would it be best to buy an 800 MHz over the other two? </s>
<s> Would it run/load faster than 533- or 667-? </s>
<s> Thanks a bunch! </s>
<s> Go to www.crucial.com and input the PC's specs. </s>
<s> It will recommend the exact fit. </s>
<s> As far as speed, the new modules will run at the existing module's speed. </s>
<s> Okay that answered my first two questions. </s>
<s> But what do you mean &quot;the new modules will run at the existing module's speed?&quot; Are you saying the MHz I choose doesn't matter; they all run at the same speed? </s>
<s> So far the speed is set by either the lowest speed in the memory sticks or by the CPU or chipset. </s>
<s> If they give you faster, fine. </s>
<s> If they give you what you have or what the machine support, all good. </s>
