<s> So we finally got some RAM for our horribly under-RAMed eMachines W3623 running vista. </s>
<s> It had 512mb and it was just unbearably slow. </s>
<s> I bought a compatible 2GB RAM chip, installed it and the computer is still as slow and task manager only shows 512(510)mb of the 2GB. </s>
<s> I've tried reseating the ram twice and upgrading the bios but I've had no luck. </s>
<s> Anyone have any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Does the BIOS shows the RAM? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Is this the right RAM? </s>

<s> Vista does have a LIMIT MEMORY setting but I'd like to see answers to 1 and 2 first since not all 2GB sticks work. </s>

<s> based on the information in the link Bob provided. </s>
<s> I'd return what you bought and get 2GBs of RAM at the link provided. </s>
<s> &quot;Memory Type: DDR2 PC2-5300, DDR2 (non-ECC) Maximum Memory: 2GB Slots: 2 Each memory slot can hold DDR2 PC2-5300 with a maximum of 1GB per slot. </s>
<s> * Let us know. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> The others zero-in on your problem. </s>
<s> Allow me to explain further or in basic terms: Your PC may allow a total of 2gb of ram installed but only as 1gb per ram slot. </s>
<s> You can't defeat this and there is no word-around. </s>
<s> There is the outside possibility of accepting that new 2gb stick alone provided the bios is updated to the latest release and even do that as a last resort, no sure thing. </s>
<s> However, you maybe best served to return that new 2gb of ram and get 2x1gb ram set. </s>
<s> IMHO, return and swap for true compatible ram sticks. </s>
<s> Also, you'll need to remove the 512mb ram stick in order to install the new 2x1gb set. </s>
