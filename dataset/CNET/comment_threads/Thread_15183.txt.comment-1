My HP PSC 2410 is on it's last legs.
It makes grinding noises at startup.
I've been to the HP website, chatted with the tech on-line and I refuse to send it in for servicing.
Not worth the money.
The bottom line is I'm looking for a reliable printer.
I don't want an HP.
I no longer need the scan or fax capability.
Color or just B&W would be fine.
Suggestions welcomed....
