The AMD 64 cpu's were designed to run cooler.
And there stupid fast already so no need to overclock them.
Of all my buddies with super fast systems only two of them use the water cooled sulutions and they both run overclocked Intel P-4's.
My AMD 64 FX is just as fast and I have no problems with cooling it.
Can't wait to get my new AMD Athlon 64 X2 processor.
