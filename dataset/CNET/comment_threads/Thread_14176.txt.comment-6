Actually, the Vostro desktop came pre-installed with Vista Business from Dell.
I never did the original Vista install, nor would I even have attempted doing so.
At first I was torn between staying with XP Pro and advancing to Vista.
I finally went with new technology rather than old.
Perhaps my last resort should be to contact Epson directly re this matter.
Thanks.
