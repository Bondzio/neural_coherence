I was unsecured for a few weeks...called them up..now my internet connection is secured, but I can only get on if Im hooked up (ethernet)..if I'm wireless, the pop-up immediately shows indicating it cant connect..no asking for my key or anything..but if I try to connect to a neighbors secure...the key question does come on.... its also interesting that I can connect to another neighbor's unsecured network, but not my own...any thoughts would be appreciated.

What does the pop-up say ? Thought: the access point or wireless router is probably not configured properly to allow you to access your own now secured network wirelessly. (whetehr SSID is broadcast, whether wireless enabled, security mode...)
