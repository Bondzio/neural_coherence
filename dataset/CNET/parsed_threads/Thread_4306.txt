<s> Hi, for the past few years ive had a computer with 2 internal hard drives (Master 160GB, Slave 40GB), the slave was from my old computer. </s>
<s> Recently the slave drive died on me, luckily i was able to save all the information to the master drive before it completely died. </s>
<s> Last week i purchased a brand new 160 GB drive to replace the Slave and installation went great. </s>
<s> Now here comes my question. </s>
<s> In the past whenever i needed to do a total system restore the computer would clean the C Drive (Master) to store bought status while not touching the D Drive (Slave) which was great because i could save all the info i needed. </s>
<s> Now that i have a new Hard Drive in place of the old Slave will i be able to do a system restore and have the info i need kept safe intact on my new hard drive? </s>
<s> One note: The new salve drive is named M instead of D. Just though id throw that out there incase it made a difference though i think it doesn't. </s>
<s> Reason i ask is because i didn't install the old slave so i don't know if there is something i need to do to make sure what i want to happen happens. </s>
<s> Also i want to make sure that after the restore my computer won't ask me to format the slave drive. </s>
<s> That also would be bad new for my files. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help . </s>
<s> Well when you are restoring your hard drive it most likely is restoring from a factory image sotred on a hidden partition. </s>
<s> If this is the case it will not affect your 2nd HD. </s>
<s> To be safe I would image your C: drive to the new slave HD. </s>
<s> Aslo in this case the restore software would not let you overwrite the HD with the image on it because it is the source drive and not the target drive. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> The best imaging software is Acronis in my opinion. </s>
<s> Ghost is lousy and cumbersome compare to Acronis and Acronis is faster. </s>
<s> You will need to make sure the slave has been formatted,that's if it hasn't been already,it might also adjust the letter of teh drive to D:.. </s>
<s> And also make sure a logical Partition has been created... </s>
