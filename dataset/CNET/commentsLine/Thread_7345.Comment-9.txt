but there are so many settings in the online configuration and i'm new enough at this that i don't have a good sense of what's important and what isn't, or even what some of these settings do.
so ask me what you need to know and i'll do my best to answer.
i've tried to adjust various settings (too many to list) and nothing has caused any improvement.
right now the router has all its default settings because late last night i reset it per instructions from d-link tech support.
i have zone alarm on my desktop pc and comodo on my notebook and the internet speed through the router is the same on both.
i have no indication (via error messages, popups, etc.)
that the firewall is the issue.
but i will check those settings and turn off the wi-fi tonight and see if that helps.
