<s> Ok i just installed this belkin wireless router and was setting some configuration settings on it. </s>
<s> i went to the address 192.168.1.2 and was able to configure settings that affected my belkin router such as the DHCP server settings and such. </s>
<s> I made a mistake and changed the LAN default IP to 192.168.1.1, which was the IP for my actual other router which actually connects me to the internet. </s>
<s> My belkin router was previously assigned 192.168.1.2(that's how i accessed this menu to alter these settings). </s>
<s> As a result now i'm unable to access menu's for my modem to connect me to internet, and my belkin router. </s>
<s> How do i solve this as this is not a small ordinary problem about hardware? </s>
<s> Thanks i really hope you can think of a solution. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Did I read this correctly you have TWO ROUTERS? </s>
<s> Maybe you should have just one. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ok, point taken but how do i solve the IP problem. </s>
<s> i can't configure either router now? </s>
<s> thanks lots </s>
<s> For me, both routers I have at home have a reset button so I can start over. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> o...i see what u mean i see my reset button too what happens when i press it? </s>
<s> and what should i do after that? </s>
<s> thanks lots of course =) </s>
<s> For my Dlink and Linksys here, it returns it to the factory settings. </s>
<s> It will be a DHCP server so I can boot the PC connected to the LAN ports and port the web browser at it to configure it. </s>
<s> The Linksys has one other option and that's the USB configuration, but I don't suggest that since for some, USB things have issues. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> hmm sounds good. </s>
<s> ok i'll do it and let's see what happens for the belkin thing. </s>
<s> thanks =) </s>
<s> well i pressed reset for both routers... i configured my alcatel 510 speedtouch first...got the net connection up for tt...then managed to get back the ip required for it... then reset belkin and reinstalled the thing assigned a separate IP for it... then reassigned the cables again... and vuala! </s>
<s> my belkin now creates the wireless network...while the alcatel 510 provides the internet connection... cause my belkin doesn't have a modem inside only a router/wireless thing so in the end all is well thanks alot moderator =) </s>
