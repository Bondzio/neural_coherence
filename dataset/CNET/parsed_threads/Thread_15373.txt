<s> Hello, I can't watch a single youtube video without experiencing a freeze. </s>
<s> Here is what happens during 6 minute video clip: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4x5ydW4fBM&feature=youtu.be As you see it's almost impossible to watch... </s>
<s> This happens occasionally in other sites too. </s>
<s> I remember once or twice even speedtest.net froze during the test. </s>
<s> Same with bigger downloads from sites - I have to pause then resume to finish downloading but file gets damaged from it. </s>
<s> Sometimes it downloads smoothly though ;l Torrents download with no problems. </s>
<s> Also, sexy videos never freeze So what's wrong with my internet? </s>
<s> Changing browsers or anti virus didn't make any difference ;l maybe I should configure router in some specific way? </s>
<s> Specs: Win7 64bit newest updates Gygabite P61-USB3-B3 Intel i3-2120 HD5670 No parts were OC'ed Please help! </s>
<s> Did you try the usual? </s>
<s> Google this phrase. </s>
<s> -&gt; Disable FLASH hardware acceleration. </s>
<s> This only affects some machines but when you write YouTube, I do that first. </s>

<s> I remember trying this out ages ago but it was not related to the issue! </s>
<s> Given the sparse clues I'll wait for more. </s>
