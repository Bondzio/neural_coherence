<s> A friend of mine just presented me with a thumbdrive he reformatted at work which refuses to work now. </s>
<s> I took a look at it and it states in the info panel that it is read only. </s>
<s> There is no visible locking switch on the outside of the case. </s>
<s> His problems began when he threw away the security software folders that came in the drive and then reformatted it with the disc utility. </s>
<s> There is no manufacturer's name or identifying serial number on the case of the drive. </s>
<s> I have tried to reformat it using both the utility on my mac and the utility built into my XP windows machine. </s>
<s> The XP says the drive is &quot;write protected&quot; and won't do anything with it. </s>
<s> Mac Disc Utility gives this bit of information when I try to verify the disc... </s>
<s> Verifying volume reformatted Checking HFS volume. </s>
<s> Checking Extents Overflow file. </s>
<s> Checking Catalog file. </s>

<s> Given its present state, I would be tempted to use Disk Utility to erase the disk. </s>
<s> Select the disk and choose the Erase tab. </s>
<s> Then select Security Options and choose Zero Out all Data. </s>
<s> This will write zero's to the disk, the default method just messes with the directory, and leaves the stick with no readable format on it. </s>
<s> Once that is complete, format the stick as you would normally do for a Mac disk. </s>
<s> It's worth a try. </s>

<s> ... the Security Options button is grayed out. </s>
<s> I ejected and stuck it back in... no luck. </s>
<s> I unmounted and mounted it from the disc utility... no luck. </s>
<s> Maybe I will try rebooting my computer and see if that helps. </s>
<s> I will let you know. </s>
<s> Thanks grim </s>

<s> like TechTool Pro or DiskWarrior... but no guarantees... </s>
<s> partition it... into two partitions. </s>
<s> That would cause the existing partition to be completely re-written... and that *might* be the issue... Then take it back to a single partition... </s>
<s> ... </s>
<s> I don't have the Mac repair utilities you mentioned so I took the drive and stuck it back into my winbox and took out an old copy of Norton DiscDoctor for PC on disc. </s>
<s> It registered problems in the FAT32 allocation on the drive when I booted it up and began to repair the DOS partitions on all discs. </s>
<s> The thumbdrive registered as Apple formatted when plugged into my mac... but registers as RAW files when Properties are checked when connected to the PC. </s>
<s> I wasn't sure if it was registering the PC's HD or the thumb drive so I stopped it and retried the thumbdrive in my mac. </s>
<s> Disc Utility now allows the erase function to be selected... but still fails to erase or partition because it says the disc can not be &quot;unmounted&quot;. </s>
<s> The thumbdrive will not eject either but Finder does allow some old files to be viewed and the info button says you can read and write to the drive. </s>
<s> I will try the drive again on my PC... but right now, I'm waiting for the darn thing to defrag. </s>
<s> I use it so seldom that I figured to do the maintenance on it before I try to fix this thumbdrive. </s>
<s> Just for my personal information... </s>
<s> If I am able to erase and reformat this drive, how should a thumb drive be formatted for use exclusively on a mac running OSX ? </s>
<s> The disc utility offers a variety of choices (journalized, standard, etc). </s>
<s> Thanks for everyone's input so far ! </s>

<s> ... using my PC. </s>
<s> I double checked the formatting on my personal thumb drives and the mac info window listed them as FAT16 formats, so that is what I reformatted my buddies' thumb drive to be. </s>
<s> If anyone one could advise a better file format for this thumb drive then let me know before monday so I can make the adjustments before I give it back to my friend. </s>
<s> Thanks all. </s>
