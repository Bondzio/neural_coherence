with so many laptops to choose from i don't know where to begin.
all i want the laptop to do is word processing, running programs like matlab or mathematica and surfing the internet.
now i understand i can get one that performs all these operations for a low price, however i hate waiting!
when i click the application i want it load almost instantly.
so what kind of laptop should i get?
i was told that centrino is great for word processing and has a good battery life.
any opinions?
