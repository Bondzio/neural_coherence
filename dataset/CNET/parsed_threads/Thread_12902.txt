<s> I thought it was the power supply at first after updating nvidia drivers, but I decided to try msi's kombustor benchmark software and ran the fuzzy and furry stress test. </s>
<s> My pc did not shut off for the whole 10 minutes I ran it while my graphics card was under 100% load and 101% power draw. </s>
<s> This threw me off completely and now I don't know what is going on. </s>
<s> This didn't start happening until I reinstalled bf3 and punkbuster. </s>
<s> (PB is for connecting to servers in bf3) I also would like to add that updating my nvidia drivers only made it shut off instantly when graphics were loaded instead of a few minutes after. </s>
<s> I have had the same setup for about 4-5months and I have never had this problem until now. </s>

<s> It looks to be in warranty. </s>
<s> Have the maker fix this machine since you can crash it on demand. </s>

<s> I built the system myself. </s>
<s> The power supply is still under warranty. </s>
<s> I am just trying to make sure it isn't something else before I send it out for an RMA. </s>
<s> When it did fine during the benchmark it baffled me. </s>
<s> You seem to created this when you updated the drivers. </s>
<s> Go back to what worked? </s>
<s> I said it had already been shutting off when playing games for a few days. </s>
<s> I figured updating the drivers might fix it, but only made it worse. </s>
<s> I guess I didn't clarify that actually my mistake. </s>
<s> The problem didn't start until I moved into a new place and reinstalled bf3 and punk buster. </s>
<s> I tried updating the drivers to see if it would fix the issue a few days later. </s>
<s> Sadly you have to use what you've learned so far to make your best guess at what to replace. </s>
<s> From my lessons in the field I find it's usually the video card if the machine is fine in respect to power, cooling and such. </s>
<s> The hard part is the owner. </s>
<s> Most paid dearly for the video card and will second guess you every time. </s>
<s> That's fine but you have to base your decisions on either a hard fail, swap a thing or what you've seen over the years. </s>
<s> In this case I give the nod to trying another video card given the story so far. </s>
<s> HOWEVER!!!!! </s>
<s> Be sure to research that BF3 game forums. </s>
<s> It would not be funny to find folk with lockup/reboot/freeze issues in that forum and then find a patch there. </s>
<s> I did not do your research for you on that topic. </s>
