The system is a Gigabyte GA 7ZX motherboard with Socket A for AMD Duron/Athlon processor; a VIA KT133/686A chipset, with support for PC133 SDRAM . I did something very simple ---- I replaced the CPU Duron 900 with a Duron 1200 and I added a stick of 256 memory. I made sure that the CPU and memory pieces were compatible with the motherboard. The machine will not pass the POST. I took out the memory and put the old processor back in......no POST I took all peripherals off line and added them one at a time.....no POST I replaced the power supply......no Post I replaced the motherboard with a brand new one exact model.....no POST I pulled the video card and checked it.......no POST I switched the new CPU back in.....no POST I switched out the memory sticks one at a time....no POST I'm stumped, any ideas.

Although, it's still possible that the bios may need upgrading to accept the Duron 1200. I just need a post so I can get at the Bios

887	4	301753	2815280	2815269	westrock77	7/19/08 7:15 PM	1.2164949E12	bad caps not an issue	The original motherboard did have slightly bulged caps and that was the main reason that I replaced it with a new board. The capacitors on the new board are good so I've ruled that out.

Also many cracked the cpu cores when putting on the heatsink. Those were not good for do it yourselfers. If you strip it down to just board, CPU+HSF, power supply and a speaker and it does not beep you are looking at the 4 possible bad parts.

The initial upgrade was just the CPU and memory, that's all I touched. I just find it hard to believe that both CPU's would have been destroyed since I was maticulous about the transfer paste and installation of chip.

On the motherboard are a few things such as jumpers and that battery. You can check the jumpers and the battery with your voltmeter. Too low and many boards don't boot. Same for the CMOS CLEAR jumper. Bob

Was your power plug still plugged in. I wiped out two CPU's by NOT following ESD procedures. When you attach your ESD strap to the computer, it needs to still be plugged into the wall so that you have a ground path through the ground pin on the power plug. This post is really only for future replacement, it does not fix your current problem. I agree with the person who told you to try just MOBO, CPU + Heat sink, and speaker and see if you hear BIOS beep errors. Good luck

Upon insertion of ram (the ram is good, and has been checked) then it's back to square one, and no beeps no POST. The processor is good as it works with other boards. So.....the system does respond to no ram with a beep code but goes dead with ram installed.

The wrong RAM or have them placed in the slots incorrectly. Usually , the larger MBs goes toward the CPU. Check the manufactures web site for the details. Also, see the manufactures web site concerning those beeps. Do not assume. Be sure. Your running CAD on this PC? I wouldn't spend a dime on it. Time for a new one and you'll be glad you did.

It's an old system but it's the software that I'm trying to save as I don't have many of the original disks.

Might be worth a shot. Yes, the RAM might be good but is it good on your PC? May not be compatible contact crucial too see. http://www.crucial.com/store/drammemory.aspx See specifications here as an example: http://www.crucial.com/store/partspecs.aspx?IMODULE=CT2KIT51264AC667 Module Size: 8GB Kit (4GBx2) Package: 200-pin SODIMM Feature: DDR2 PC2-5300 Specs: DDR2 PC2-5300 CL=5 Unbuffered NON-ECC DDR2-667 1.8V 512Meg x 64 What they mean: http://www.crucial.com/support/mem_type.aspx?type=package&value=choose &quot;The devil is in the details.&quot; If no, then replace the board as Bob suggests. $$$ lost.
