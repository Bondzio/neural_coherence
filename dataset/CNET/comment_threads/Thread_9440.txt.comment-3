the same methods of processing video as computer monitors do.
If you are using anything but the latest sets (which are designed so that they can be used as monitors as well as TVs) then you are going to get blurry video.
The best thing you could do would be to either get a new TV that specifically states it can be used as a monitor or buy a dedicated monitor.
The upside to this is that a good monitor will have incredible picture quality if you want to watch a DVD on your computer, but the picture will be darker than usual.
