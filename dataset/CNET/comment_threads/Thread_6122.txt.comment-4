Even though the Runtime Software site advises against using their product for physically damaged drives, I thought what the heck?
I've got nothing to lose!
It worked like a charm!
I was able to restore all of my files and they operate just fine!
I wish I had know about this from the beginning instead of using that rip-off data recovery place.
Thanks again!
