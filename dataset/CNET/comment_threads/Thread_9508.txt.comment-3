for giving me such an excellent answer.
however, I'd just like to say that with all respect, I don't ever upgrade my computer or find the need to.. when it comes to computers, I pay once and use the device for like 2 to 3 years before buying a brand new one.
I actually use PC at my office when I work and like you said, it does run those editing softwares and programs but I am not so much satisfied with its performance..
I can easily tell that it's struggling to run it as smoothly as possible and it's quite annoying when it glitches once in a while..
I get that PC gives you a lot of options and it's excellent for gaming but like I mentioned, I'm looking for computer with better media performance and I think staying with Mac would be best.
If there is any more opinions on this that I should know about, please feel free to reply
