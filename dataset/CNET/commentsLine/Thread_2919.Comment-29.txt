in april 2007 i encountered a virus that managed to attach itself to the core programs that run windows xp.
i was able to remove it, but only through some dos commands, as every time i booted up normally, the virus started running.
as a result i had to do a partial restoration.
thankfully i had the appropriate cds for restoration purposes which came with my puter (a dell).
i was able to salvage most of the files on my hard drive but did lose some.
the only problem the virus left is that i now have to activate my quick launch toolbar every time i boot up.
it is annoying but at least it's better than having a virus.
i should also mention that i did have virus software (avg) at the time i got the virus, but it was one of those types that didn't have a fix available for it when it happened.
