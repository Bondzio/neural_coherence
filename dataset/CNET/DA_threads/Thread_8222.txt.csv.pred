1.1.1	I 'm Running Windows XP home edition and i 've installed the ATi radeon 9600 SE video card but im having some toruble .	St
1.1.2	When i installed it everything seemed to go fine , windows found the hardware and installed it .	St
1.1.3	But when i tried to install the drivers and software that are on the CD it says the following : & quot ; INF Error , Video driver not found , click ok & quot ; and when i click ok it says the following & quot ; Try to set up your display adapter with a standard VGA driver before running setup. & quot ; Ive tried downloading the drivers directly from the ATI site but i cant get anything to work .	St
1.1.4	The video card isnt busted or anything , im using it right now but i just dont know what to do .	St
1.2.1	XP installs its own drivers when you first put in the card .	St
1.2.2	The usual sequence is to uninstall ATI software from Add and Remove Programs , uninstall the display adapter in Device Manager .	St
1.2.3	Then you use the latest drivers from here : http : //www.nvidia.com/content/drivers/drivers.asp	St
1.3.1	try this : http : //ati.com/support/driver.html	Sug
1.4.1	Do NOT reboot after deleting the adapter from the device manager .	St
1.4.2	It 'll ask you to do so though , but if you do , the same drivers will be installed again after reboot .	St
1.5.1	Hi , Try downloading the Cat uninstaller and running it that will get rid of all ATI files on your machine .	St
1.5.2	then try two things .	St
1.5.3	1 , Just install the driver and not the control panel and multimedia driver .	St
1.5.4	2 , Install everything and then turn off fast write in the smartgart section of the advanced settings of the display .	St
