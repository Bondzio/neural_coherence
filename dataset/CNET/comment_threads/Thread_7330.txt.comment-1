I am in the process of trying to make to most of my new super-router.
One of the challenges is to allow two work laptops tied to respective corporate domains to share not only the basic WLAN/Internet connection (that bit works already), but also to use the HP LaserJet 10221 printer connected via USB to the WL-700gE and hopefully also access the disk drive.
My home network is a Windows Workgroup (W2K Pro SP4) and I cannot change the network settings of the work laptops (with Windows XP).
I there a way to solve this problem?
Thanks in advance P.S.
IMHO, ASUS has some unutilized opportunities to improve the WL-700gE Manual...
