i serve as a one-man it shop for our medium-sized family business and i don't have the time to learn, much less understand, all of the intricacies of networking, although i've managed to keep everyone connected, working and secured for about ten years now.
one of our little 5-person office networks utilizes cable broadband and a mix of wired and wireless connections using dhcp on the router and clients.
now we've purchased a networked bizhub for which the installation techs say they will need a static ip.
how does one use dynamic and static addressing at the same time??
if i provide one static ip address for the bizhub will i have to assign all of our clients static ips?
and how will that affect our mobile clients that travel to other company locations where dhcp is also the rule?
would anyone out there have a walk through for a linksys wrt54gs router that would help with the necessary config changes?
lastly, how does one determine the appropriate static ip(s) to use in these cases?
