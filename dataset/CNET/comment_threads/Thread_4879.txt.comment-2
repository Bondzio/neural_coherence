I suspect you have the &quot;coin type&quot; battery, probably CR2032 or similar.
If this is so, then install new battery as you did the old.
I like to think this is a straight-forward replacement.
If too much force was used, then rebent the top spring contact in order to better hold it it in.
The top of the battery is the totally flat side, no crimping maybe embossed lettering to ID the battery.
If you want post a picture and then the link to that picture using a free photo service like &quot;photo bucket&quot;.
