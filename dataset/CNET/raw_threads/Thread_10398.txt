You install it on the PC, connect your TV inputs, satellite, cable, or off the air to the suplied connectors, use the software that came with the device, save the program to the HD, play it back on the PC, use the software to &quot;capture&quot; a still image, save it as .jpg or .bmp. Wayne Do not condemn the judgment of another because it differs from your own.
