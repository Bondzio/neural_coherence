This is problem with some of the unique cpu cooling fans now.
You really got the check the specs or dimensions of the cpu HSF in order to be able to use it.
Yeah, you're in the upper limit of the careful temp control.
I suggest you get another one that &quot;fits&quot; the bill.
Sorry, but you learn the hard way, get another HSF.
Otherwise, you'll pay the price of a replacement cpu and that's not cheap.
