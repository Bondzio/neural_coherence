thanks to all of you for your help.
bob & willy, both of these hds are indeed in the same system and one mounted on top of the other, so overheating looks like the problem.
in that case, i can expect it to happen again if i don't take action, which i will.
nerdyboy1234, i think you've reassured me as to maxtor's durability.
so i can stop looking at other makes... thanks again, chalkbel.
