Problems or Goal: to make both LAN/Network can share Data/files. Question: How to setup the connection of both LAN/Network together, so it can share data/files? Thank you for any help.

Use the same IP, Gateway, DNS entries and change the NETMASK to 255.255.0.0 and it will work fine with internet traffic still going to each respective DSL and Cable box. If this isn't a solution for you, then you will have loads of fun with net route commands and another (real) router. But I won't be doing that because it's too much for this small space. Bob

Currently both LAN/Network are separated physically. Can I just plug in both modem (Cable and ADSL) in one Switch (Cable + ADSL Modem -&gt; Switch --&gt; PC's) and make the IP, Gateway, DNS entries and NETMASK to 255.255.0.0, configuration as you suggested? If I understand it correctly then: For the Cable modem I set the IP: 192.168.1.1 For the ADSL modem I set the IP: 192.168.1.2 Disable DHCP Set DNS (as per ISP (cable/ADSL requirement?) Set Gateway (192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.2) Set Netmask (255.255.0.0 on both modem?) For the PC's, I configure each PC's accordingly. Does it matter if they use different workgroup name? Please advice, Thank You

Then you SET all the IP, DNS, GATEWAY on each client, but all the systems use the NETMASK value of 255.255.0.0 Done. Bob

After more coffee, it occurred to me that only 1/2 or less of the CLIENT machines and just ONE dsl/cable needs work. 1. Select which router has the most users or which one you want to set to DHCP. 2. Disable DHCP in the router that you will not want DHCP. 3. Alter the router that remains a DHCP server to hand out the NETMASK 255.255.0.0 4. on the Lan with no DHCP, change all the CLIENTS to Static IP addressing using what they got as a template and change the NETMASK to 255.255.0.0 5. Connect the two LANs. Bob
3242	6	25718	289790	289549	Melati Hitam	6/13/04 11:46 AM	1.08712716E12	one little question	Both modem/router have a default IP 192.168.1.1 is this default only valid with DHCP enabled? if both have that same IP.. and connected to the same switch, aren't they conflicting? Anyway I will try it on monday, before that, Please help with this details: Cable modem-router, DHCP enabled, with IP address 192.168.1.1, netmask 255.255.0.0 no changes on the pc's ADSL modem/router, DHCP disabled, with IP??, netmask 255.255.0.0 On the PC's, IP 192.168.?.?, Netmask 255.255.0.0, Gateway ???? others?? Thank You

3242	8	25718	290793	290393	Melati Hitam	6/14/04 11:41 AM	1.08721326E12	I tried something today, please advice	Cable modem router, DHCP enabled, IP: 192.168.1.1, netmask 255.255.255.0 -- Client pc's are Automatic IP.. (with an IP range 192.168.1.100 -&gt; 140) ADSL modem/router, DHCP disabled, IP: 192.168.1.2, netmask 255.255.255.0 -- Client pc's IP: 192.168.1.2xx, gateway 192.168.1.2, DNS: as ISP required. It seems to works... but did I do it correctly? Why you stressed out the netmask of 255.255.0.0? Tried to use fix IP under 192.168.1.140.. on ADSL modem/router, but then I concern with conflicting IP when the PC's are started.. (thats the reason of IP above 200) Tried using different IP on each modem/router (i.e Cable IP: 192.168.1.1 and ADSL IP: 192.168.2.1), it didn't work for LAN(file/data share) If I could make it better or fix something, please advice.. Thank you

It can work, but I was concerned that the NAT/Routers may not know how to handle the packet bound for the other LAN. Good to see it works. &quot;It seems to works... but did I do it correctly?&quot; The file sharing and route to/from each LAN may fail. If so, you change the netmask so that both LANs are in the same LAN. Bob

But then I have another question regarding the 'Fixed IP' on a couple of Laptop involved in the LAN. Those Laptop are configured to use the ADSL with fix IP address. What should be done to make it 'mobile' from one LAN/network environment to another (i.e. from the adsl modem lan/network to cable modem lan/network -- or from office to home LAN/network) Thank you again for the help
