My usual back up drive is a WD Passport USB 80GB drive, I use it constantly. Today I was dumb and formatted it and tried to install Leopard on it and couldn't get it running. So after that I try to go back into Windows and format it so I can use it as a backup again and it didn't show up in my computer. I did the obvious and replugged it in and got an unknown device what ever, so I told it to look for drives but it couldn't find any. At this point I'm freaking out, so I pull up device manager and see the unknown device, but it's also under Disk Drives, working properly. I then plugged it into my XP desktop, works like a charm, shows up, works fine, read/write/copy, everything, so no problems with the drive. I think I've cornered it to a driver problem in Windows, and don't know what to do now. Anyone have an idea?

Installing Windows on your Mac requires a special procedure and only certain versions will install. If this is a PC then this post is heeded to be locked since we can't discuss pirated material. Bob

We have a great moderator that can address this there. http://forums.cnet.com/5204-6126_102-0.html?forumID=10&tag=forum.fd -&gt; Beware that external drives in FAT32 will go missing for a very simple reason. FAT32 is not damage resistant. Bob
