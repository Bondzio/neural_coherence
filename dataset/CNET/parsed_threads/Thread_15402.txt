<s> Hello all, I Am having challenges with accessing webmail and downloading e-mail from that account on my Lenovo T61 wirelessly. </s>
<s> I have Vista 32b with 140g hd. </s>
<s> I did update my system yesterday to connect to a wireless hot spot within one of my offices and had no problems at that time. </s>
<s> It was not until I arrived at another office the challenges started. </s>
<s> I have tried doing a restore to no avail, as it fails. </s>
<s> I Am able to get e-mail and access webmail from other computers, so I know it is up and working. </s>
<s> Any other suggestions or tricks for me to try in order to resolve this? </s>
<s> Thanks.. </s>
<s> The security software (unlisted in your post) is set to maximum security and that new malware has damaged the OS. </s>
<s> Bob, thank you for your reply. </s>
<s> I have Kaspersky. </s>
<s> Do I need to refresh/reinstall Vista? </s>
<s> I can try that for sure. </s>

<s> http://usa.kaspersky.com/support/ listed many products. </s>
<s> While installing Vista is one thing, getting Windows to work proper afterwards is far too hard today as the 10 or so drivers we must find after we install Microsoft's OS. </s>
<s> The reason for your issue or the clue is not in your posts. </s>
<s> This is why I noted the 2 most common reasons I run into. </s>
<s> There are others but if I listed them it would go on and on and not help much. </s>
<s> Think over when it stopped working. </s>
<s> What changed? </s>
