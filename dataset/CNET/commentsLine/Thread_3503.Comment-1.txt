quick question: i have a printer with a usb connection currently connected to my win xp desktop.
i don't really care for the windows print feature on xp, seems to be hit or miss with my other pcs on the network at times.
i would like to know if i can connect the printer directly to the network router port.
i understand there are usb to ethernet adapters, will this assign an ip from the router that other pc's can use as a network printer, or do i need to get a mini print server?
also, the printer port is the type b square usb connection, while most convertors have a type a to lan.
do they sell a type b unit?
