I recently added a new Maxtor 250 GB with a 16 MB cache internal hard drive as a slave to my existing internal WD 250 GB drive which is the master.
The master was left as the C: drive and I removed the CD ROM drive to make room for the new Maxtor which was designated as the D: drive.
Now, when I boot up my system, the screen tells me to Control, Alternate, Delete, which restarts the system and then I have to go to F2 to get to the startup BIOS screen.
If I choose the &quot;boot system&quot; option, it takes me to the choice of drives to boot and I then have to choose the WD drive and hit enter in order to get my system to boot successfully.
I'm not real savy about fooling around with the BIOS, but isn't there something simple that I can do to get my system to boot up normally?
