Desktop running XP Media w/SP2 is hardwired and encryption seems to have taken using Netgear Wizard. Desktop running XP Home w/ SP2 is wireless using Netgear WPN111 USB connection. Problem: Using Netgear Wizard I tried to enable WPA encryption with code (same as one used on wired desktop). Wireless computer is active on the network when I start but when I apply the WPA encryption the Wizard goes red and the network drops out. Seems to be searching for a connection. I tried applying the encryption with the Windows firewall disabled but it does not take. (note: I also tried to set up WEP but same problem) Other info: Wireless system uses NSW 2005 Antivirus along with Aluria Adware software. Any thoughts on what's going on here and how to correct this? I talked with Netgear and they said drop all firewalls and uninstall the software if necessary. Call back if any problems. (Once I get the issue fixed I'll be ready to review Netgear products for all to see)

For those interested, here's what I did. I went to the router (WPN824) setup configuration screen and set up encryption for WPA accessing it through my wired computer. Funny thing after I did this, the wireless computer dropped out as it wasn't set up for encryption (since I was having problems as previously described). I then set up the wireless WPN111 USB adapter for WPA encryption and all seems fine now. Funny how the Netgear tech did not bother to run down the setup sequence and figure this out. Seems he must have assumed that I set up the router via the wired computer already but that wouldn't have made sense the wireless computer had access without encryption.
