<s> Hi, This is my second post regarding the same problem. </s>
<s> Win 98, Celeron 170, 256 ram, hp 610 c printer, (ink refill used). </s>
<s> C, D, E drive. </s>
<s> Window reinstalled after C is formatted just a few days ago. </s>
<s> D, E were untouched. </s>
<s> My printer works fine on other pc s and print all kind of files. </s>
<s> On my pc it print only text files. </s>
<s> No problem in text files. </s>
<s> But Don't print word, doc,web pages. </s>
<s> Even don't print text page as of&gt; from printer services. </s>
<s> When it start printing them &gt; it starts and than inside the printing thing hit on sides too (bit harder) and than I get unable to communicate with printer port lpt1 message. </s>
<s> Than I get alternate flashing lights in printer. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> Thanks Aron </s>
<s> You may also find it annoying that a perfectly good parallel printer cable may need replacing with some IEEE cable or the BIOS set to EPP or standard before this will work. </s>
<s> In short, my question is whether YOU installed all those lovely drivers. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You need to do a complete de-install and remove all references to that printer. </s>
<s> Then physically disconnect ptr. </s>
<s> and then reboot and allow it to finish. </s>
<s> Once done, to a shutdown. </s>
<s> Upon next reboot or power-up follow whatever instructions they're for the install, you may need to connect ptr. </s>
<s> now or later, just follow the instructions. </s>
<s> Don't take anything for granted, if you haven't already get another LPT cable or swap port(s) if multiple ones. </s>
<s> If none of this fixes the problem, reload windows over itself, it won't change any setting but may reload OS pgms. </s>
<s> required. </s>
<s> Make sure to reload the system or mtrbd. </s>
<s> drivers from restore CD or driver CD after the OS reload. </s>
<s> You haven't already visit the HP support website for clues, hints, tips on the topic. </s>
<s> They do supply some info its worth the visit, plus check for any newer drivers. </s>
<s> FYI - Refilled ink carts can cause problems that are weird to understand. </s>
<s> Take into account a refilled ink cart can be done so many times, before it has to be pitched, usually I consider 5-6 refills tops, then toss-out. </s>
