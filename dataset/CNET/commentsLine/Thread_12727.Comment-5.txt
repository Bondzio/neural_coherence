thank you for telling the story in your first post.
it has enough clues plus a story to have me to think about something specific to try.
and yes, the new techs at many &quot;shops&quot; will think nothing of pulling off the heatsink to look and of course it works fine &quot;in the shop.&quot; you made the &quot;perfect&quot; post and put the advice to good use.
best of continued self made luck!
