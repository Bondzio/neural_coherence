1.1.1	Hi all !	St
1.1.2	I just purchased a brand new Mad Dog external CD/DVD for my Gateway Profile P4 PC .	St
1.1.3	( Windows XP home-sp2 ) I bought it because the drive attached to my computer could no longer be depended upon to burn CDs .	St
1.1.4	( My computer is 5 years old ! )	St
1.1.5	This new drive is great , and now I can burn DVDs , which my old drive could not do .	St
1.1.6	It also burns CDs from downloaded digital music brilliantly .	St
1.1.7	The only problem is , when I open iTunes to play a CD , this drive will not play CDs in iTunes !	St
1.1.8	It WILL play music CDs in Windows Media Player though .	St
1.1.9	( But my ENTIRE music library is in iTunes !	St
1.1.10	So I burn all of my music CDs using iTunes . )	St
1.1.11	So , I called the manufacturer , and sure enough , he said this drive is INCOMPATIBLE with iTunes .	St
1.1.12	My question to you guys is , is there any way AROUND this fact ?	Ques
1.1.13	( Is he just telling me this because of some loyalty & quot ; deal & quot ; they have with Win Media ? )	Ques
1.1.14	Because I can not figure out a way to get music from CDs uploaded into iTunes .	St
1.1.15	When I try , the song , and all of it 's info , APPEARS in iTunes AND on my iPod , but the music simply does not play even after I 've converted the song to a format iTunes plays !	St
1.1.16	( By the way , I use these CDs for my job as an exercise instructor .	St
1.1.17	So I depend on my equipment to enable my work ! )	St
1.1.18	Had I not already gotten rid of the box and receipt , I would 've returned this drive .	St
1.1.19	( Nothing on the box or in the instructions says the drive is incompatible with iTunes .	St
1.1.20	I think that 's a bit shady . )	St
1.1.21	Am I doomed to be unable to upload music CDs ?	Ques
1.1.22	Do these external drives EVER say they are compatible/incompatible with iTunes ?	Ques
1.1.23	I 'd appreciate any info you-all have on this topic .	Polite
1.2.1	I picked up a new drive from newegg.com or geeks.com and it 's fine .	St
1.2.2	That 's the solid fix .	St
1.2.3	Next you research the internet for new drive FIRMWARE ( goodbye warranty ) and hope that gets it done .	St
1.2.4	- & gt ; Why keep such a drive ?	Ques
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Bob , thanks for the quick response !	Polite
1.3.2	Now , my only reason for keeping this drive has to do with an abject fear of buying YET ANOTHER drive that will not work with iTunes !	St
1.3.3	( Remember , there was no indication that this new drive would not work with iTunes till I called the manufacturer and ASKED !	St
1.3.4	So how is one to know ? ? ?	Ques
1.3.5	$ 70.00 down the tubes because I immediately disposed of the box and receipt .	St
1.3.6	Yup , stupid . )	Polite
1.3.7	Now that I 've learned THAT lesson , I invision myself buying and returning drives until I hit one that 's compatible !	St
1.3.8	That 's my only concern .	St
1.3.9	So I am definitely going to newegg.com or geeks.com , if I can be sure the drives work with iTunes !	St
1.3.10	( Also , I 'm hoping I can find an external drive so I wo n't have to open my computer for installation . )	St
1.3.11	Thanks again man .	St
1.4.1	I 'm sorry to read your plight .	Polite
1.4.2	It 's been hard for me to encounter or find such a drive today .	St
1.4.3	I can understand how this would make a person gun shy .	St
1.4.4	Let 's try this .	St
1.4.5	If you can give me the dark details of your drive I will ( one time ) for the firmware .	St
1.4.6	Here 's the tool to see what 's in that MAD DOG - & gt ; Look at the & quot ; Drive Model and Region Status Identification Programs & quot ; at http : //forum.rpc1.org/dl_utility.php Bob	St
1.5.1	Bob , I have no idea what is , or where I 'd find something called , a REGION STATUS IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM !	St
1.5.2	But , the model number of my drive is MD-18XTFE .	St
1.5.3	But would n't you think it really would n't matter , considering the dude at Mad Dog told me the drive was incompatible with iTunes ?	Ques
1.5.4	OR do you think there might be a chance it could be the firmware , and he did n't know what he was talking about ?	Ques
1.5.5	( I did check out newegg.com and found an external drive by LG that is in my price range .	St
1.5.6	I 'm going to email them and ask if it will work with iTunes . )	St
1.6.1	And you someday want to risk it , that unit might also be a TSSTCompCD/DVDW SH-S182D by Samsung .	St
1.6.2	I 've used many Samsungs with many softwares .	St
1.6.3	I ca n't test your unit for you but it it gets to the point you are going to trash it then here 's the firmware to try .	St
1.6.4	http : //www.samsung.com/us/support/download/supportDown.do ? model_nm=SH-S182D & mType=FM & vType=L Sorry , I am not endorsing this in any way shape or form but as reference material as a last ditch idea prior to the scrap heap .	St
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	Bob , this idea of firmware is real new to me .	St
1.7.2	And I notice on the page the link brought me to , there are many different versions of this firmware .	St
1.7.3	Which version would I chose ?	Ques
1.7.4	The latest , no ?	Ques
1.7.5	And is installation simple ?	Ques
1.7.6	This IS my last ditch effort , so I think I will try it .	St
1.7.7	And if it does n't work , I got my new choice on newegg.com to start fresh with .	St
1.7.8	( Anyway , I am grateful I 'm not losing 100s and 100s of dollars because of not keeping the box and receipt ! ! ! )	St
1.7.9	Thanks for your patience with me .	St
1.8.1	Is always the latest .	St
1.8.2	There may be someone , somewhere that can find a reason for the older versions .	St
1.8.3	Bob	St
1.9.1	I never tell how here .	St
1.9.2	This is between you and it 's maker since if I mistype one word or you read it wrong then I 'm to blame .	St
1.9.3	Sorry about that .	St
1.9.4	Bob	St
1.10.1	I totally get why you ca n't do serious details about this subject .	St
1.10.2	And again , I am soooo grateful for the help you 've extended to me .	St
1.10.3	I 'll let you know how this-all pans out .	St
1.10.4	Ken	St
