problem is that you are using data lifeguard tools which is a wd product not seagate.
i am assuming you are using a new sata drive which has no jumpers - it assumes cs.
put the new drive in a secondary interface slot on your mobo you may be required to run the seagate setup disk.
i prefer to run the setup disk with only the new drive in the system to ensure no accidental data loss.
after setup put your 80gb drive back in play as master and the 320 as slave.
you need to use norton ghost or acronis software to image the old drive to the new one.
acronis will cost you $49.95 and it is worth it.
you can get a free copy of barts tools by download which includes norton ghost.
you can boot to barts universal boot disk and run ghost.
when it is complete- take the old drive out after shutting the system down and reboot.
the new drive should boot.
if my assumption is not correct and you are using ide connections- the same procedure applies.
the position of the drive on the cable will determine master or slave.
use the same procedure after completion.
disconnect the 80 gb drive and put the 320 in master position and reboot.
you should have a 320 gb c drive.
be safe
