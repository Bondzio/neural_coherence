<s> Take a look at Pinnacle Systems USB video capture cards. </s>
<s> They start at $100 and up depending on the features. </s>
<s> I like the Movie Box Plus at $150 for the better features and much better software. </s>
<s> At the least you can capture video to your computer with any of these and play it back once in. </s>
<s> The better cards will let you edit your video for a more polished look. </s>
<s> You can also google &quot;video capture&quot; for more options. </s>
<s> These can be found at Best Buy, Circuit City or almost anywhere computer related devices are sold. </s>
<s> Check out pinnaclesys.com for more info. </s>
<s> As for #2, almost any VHS machine can hook up to these cards. </s>
<s> What worked best for me was two things. </s>
<s> #1. </s>
<s> Get a capture card that supports S-video and get a vhs machine that also has that option. </s>
<s> #2 Get a good quality cable! </s>
<s> This will ensure a higher quality of video on your computer. </s>
<s> I hope you find this of some help. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>

<s> Right now I have the Pinnacle Studion 10 to capture the PC Cam mini tape then edit it. </s>

<s> While you are in the helping mood, I bought two Notebooks this past week, both are about 1.7 MGZ speed, 512RAM, 80 GIG HD. </s>

<s> My old laptop was an Acer ter-600 or Pentium 3 at 600 MHz. </s>
<s> You have more than that and I was able to edit videos. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If you have win xp you should be ok with 512 ram, but if vista I would crank it up to 1 gb if not 2 gb. </s>
<s> I run 1 gb on win xp and can still use my computer while its doing its thing. </s>
<s> You might consider some external storage for your media. </s>
<s> On average it take 13 gb for one hour of raw video. </s>
<s> Some crawfish etoufee would be SWEET! </s>
