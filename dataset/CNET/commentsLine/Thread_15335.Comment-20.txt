there are always excuses for everything.
endless excuses.
why should i pay more to have the junk removed or never installed?
dell, hp, gateway, etc.
has the problem -- knowing their customers are dissatisfied, but doing it anyway!
no wonder mr dell just fired his company leader and took leadership back.
and the phone help from india is another solution to real bottom line -- even though very few customers like what was done in the matter of tech support.
all i'm asking for is the right to have the choice to install or not install this junk software.
i believe i deserve such a right if i am paying for the machine.
if these companies do not believe i have such a right, let them wait until i purchase one of their machines again.
(which will not happen!)
