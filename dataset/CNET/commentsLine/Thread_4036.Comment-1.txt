problem with a printer here.
compaq ij1200 printer running on win2000 pro.
every time i try to print something, only half of it shows up on the page with the other half of the page being blank..... in the sense that the entire picture seems to be &quot;moved&quot; to one side so much that half of it gets literally cut off.
printing quality is fine.
the alignment has been done and the test page prints fine as well.
it worked ok on the same computer while running winme - the problem has only occured upon installation of win2000 pro.
any ideas?
