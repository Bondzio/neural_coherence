all good advice, but if the g5 is anything like the g4's, it is very important to make sure that the &quot;master drive&quot;, or the original drive in the g5 is the last in the chain or you will be in hell.
so make sure the drive you are adding is set on slave, connect it to the middle connector and then connect the master drive.
because of ide cables that you may have to do this, you may have to take the original drive out of the bottom bay and put the new drive in on the bottom, then install the g4 drive above it.
i know this sounds like a pain in the ass, but it isn't much more work and results will be perfect.
make sure that the blue end of the ide cable is connected to the mother board if it has one.
you can connect both of the g4 cables if you want to purchase an ide pci card.
then you can expand your machine to 2 extra drives, just put them both on the same new bus.
