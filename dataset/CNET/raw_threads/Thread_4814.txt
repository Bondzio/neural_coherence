I'm having trouble accessing 1 particular site (page not found). When I bypass the router completely, I can access the site. So I think the router's built-in firewall is blocking the site. How do I unblock this site? I can't find where I can configure the router's firewall. I can access the router's set-up page via the http link, but I don't see any option for configuring the firewall. I'm using Windows XP, with a desktop, laptop and cable modem. Thanks in advance, Ed

But I can't connect the dots without that last detail. To see if it's a lookup failure use DNSLOOKUP (see google.com) on your machine. Also my router has this feature (DNSLOOKUP) to help in such troubleshooting. Bob

I think the router firmware may be corrupted or something. I'm going to try to reset the router and upgrade the firmware.
