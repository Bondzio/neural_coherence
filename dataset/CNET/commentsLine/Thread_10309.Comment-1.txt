greetings forum.
i'm building my own media center computer.
i started out with an old hp vectra vli8 desktop system.
i put in a bigger cpu (1.3ghz celeron), increased the ram(512mb), put in a 300gb hard drive, i also installed a hauppauge dual-tuner card wintv-pvr-mce-500, upgraded to a hp dvd840i dvd writer(dl + lightscribe), and to cap it off, i changed the operating system to windows media center 2005 sp2.
i am at my vertical limit with this problem.
can you tell me how to install the driver software for the hp dvd840i super multi dvd writer?
i can't burn the programs i've saved on my hard drive to dvd until i clear this up.
