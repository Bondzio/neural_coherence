<s> For whatever reason my USB-based HP 7300 All-in-One printer, stopped printing. </s>
<s> On-board print tests work fine, so it's not the printer. </s>
<s> I swapped USB cables, USB ports, and uninstalled / reinstaled the s/w, plus undated my USB drivers. </s>
<s> I'd also used this printer periodically on my desktop system and that too stopped printing. </s>
<s> I reinstalled it as a network printer and was able to print a test page, but when I sign-on my laptop through my companies VPN, it no longer prints, though the fax, scan and copy capabilities work fine. </s>
<s> Our Help Desk says there's no work-around and it won't work through a network connection and VPN. </s>
<s> It's most likely the USB port within the printer, and I'm not sure what I can do about that, any suggestions? </s>
<s> I'm running XP (SP2) on both my laptop and desktop. </s>

<s> Then it may be game over. </s>
<s> It's quite proper that the VPN shuts out the network printing. </s>
<s> If anyone was able to fix that, then they just discovered a gaping security hole in VPN. </s>
<s> (hint, not going to happen.) </s>
<s> The cheap fix is likely going to be a new printer if this one is out of warranty. </s>
