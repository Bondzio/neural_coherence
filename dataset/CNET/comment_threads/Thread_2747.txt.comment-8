Well that's an understatement.
With each Windows release I hope the backup and restore would be without issue but so far, without fail you find folk backing up but can't get the restore to work.
Here I have a few new Windows 8 laptops and the factory restore fails.
Fortunately Samsung didn't rely on Microsoft.
