I still keep thinking power supply.
I believe there are many Gateway, Dell, eMachines and HPs out there that use &quot;mini-ATX&quot; power supplies, if that is what you have from what I've seen, many are only 80 or 100 watt.
Marginal IMHO.
Look at the BIOS setup, while you are there choose a &quot;failsafe&quot; mode if available.
Often in the many newer BIOS setups you will be see CPU voltage and teperature.
