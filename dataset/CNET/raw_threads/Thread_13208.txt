I add a Netgear WGT624 router to connect a PS3 & Xbox and average about 2000 KBPS at my computer. I took these speeds when the game systems were turned off. I do not use the wireless option on this router. This is more of a drop than expected. What type of Ethernet cables should I use? Will cat6 cables help? Should I upgrade my router? Thanks in advanced

While I will comment you have a bargain or cheap router that takes a bite out of the speed you might boost it if you can install Openwrt in that router. Sadly it's not the cables. Then again I wonder if you tried it with the WIFI disabled. I can't count the time I found moochers on the wifi. Bob

I have found (from experience) that the Xbox is picky and needs a compatible router or it will not work. http://www.xbox.com/en-US/support/connecttolive/xbox360/homenetworking/equipment.htm

I never use my wireless, so I took the advice and disabled it. Looks like I am getting better speeds (high 3000-low 4000 KBPS). My home backs up to a school parking lot, maybe I did have some moochers. Still curious on what routers are recommended. My router is about 4 years old.
