1.2.1	Clean all the rollers and paper feed mechanism ( basically all the parts which come into contact with the topside of the paper as it feeds through ) with some safe solvent like that used to clean cassette players or CD discs .	St
1.2.2	use cotton-buds for the more inaccessible areas .	St
1.2.3	You should also try running several sheets of plain paper through after that with the 'paper out ' button .	Sug
1.2.4	The paper will pick up any stray or excess ink from places you ca n't reach .	St
1.2.5	repeat with fresh sheets util you start geting unmarked pages .	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the info .	St
1.3.2	Ive cleaned the rollers with ethanol but it has n't helped .	St
1.3.3	I do n't think it is excess ink as the lines are consistant throughout .	St
1.3.4	I have taken a photo of a printout which shows the lines , could I email this to you or somebody else in hope that you can see what the problem is ?	Ques
