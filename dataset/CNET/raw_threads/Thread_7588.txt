I was wondering what people think of HP's; I've heard rumours from some people that they cut a lot of corners, but others are really happy with them. Are they reliable computers, or should I look elsewhere? I'm thinking of getting a custom built computer too, but that would be a bit more expensive and I don't know if it would be worth it.

I had a couple of software conflicts between an HP scanner and camera, but they were resolved to my satisfaction. HP support is like everyone else's, it's now off shore, but I have been happy with my experience and will definately buy HP again.

Though many can be upgraded, something can amiss easily if you don't get the right part. However, I don't consider any harder to install vs. a homebuild system. Any custom build system tends to lend itself to easily upgrade or even a wholesale swap of mtrbd. etc. to the existing case, not so with OEM. That pretty much covers the basic difference. You should consider what &quot;s/w bundle&quot; is included besides the OS as that can be a healthy bonus or not provided you can use it. Many times, besides the OS installed or not, custom systems have no s/w bundle. So read the fine print on what you get for your money. tada -----Willy

I sell hp, compaq, sony, gateway ( and emachines) and i know a little about the inner workings of the HP prebuilts. First of all they come with alot extras you dont really need, software wise which is hard to wipe out of your system, also the support for HP's is really bad, hard to understand and even harder to get warranty service. If you do run into problems most computer repairmen(shops) will run away from you when you tell them its an hp. To be honest with you, and this is going to catch alot of flack from everyone else, I would purchase the emachines athlon 64bit system, they are IMMENSELY easier to work on, they are now owned by gateway and they are more properly priced. If you must go for a prebuilt system, go with the emachines T6524: brand name eMachines manufacturer eMachines model name T6524 processor type AMD Athlon 64 3500+ processor speed 2.2 GHz frontside bus 2000 MHz memory 1.0 GB maximum memory upgrade 4 GB memory speed PC3200 memory type DDR SDRAM hard drive capacity 200 GB video memory 128MB shared video hardware ATI Radeon Xpress 200 audio hardware AC '97 6-channel audio modem standard 56K V.92 Wi-Fi capability included (Wi-Fi ready) no Ethernet port yes infrared port no included integrated drives DVD+R DL/DVDRW; CD-ROM integrated memory card reader yes number of FireWire ports 2 number of parallel ports 1 number of PS/2 ports 2 number of S-video out ports 0 number of serial ports 0 number of USB 1.1 ports 0 number of USB 2.0 ports 7 number of VGA video ports 1 peripherals included keyboard; mouse; speakers operating system Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 software included yes warranty 1-year this would be a better deal in my e-pinions.

The shop that sells the hp has a really good financing plan, so that's one reason I was thinking about it, whereas I don't know about the financing from the store that sells the emachine. That's one reason I'm leaning towards the hp.

They seem to forget they even made a system once it's out of production. They do very little if any driver support for systems once they are out of production. While I know many people don't like DELL at least you can go to their supprot web site and get drivers for any OS the system migth support for any componets taht DELL originally supplied. I can pull up a support page for a 5+ year old system from DELL and download XP drivers. I have an HP laptop that had a video driver bug and even while it was new no driver update ever became available. I've tried to help a few others with similar issues on old HP systems desktops and aptops and found the same thing. Hardware custom modified for HP no supported by the componet manfacture and not supported by HP. Now for their laser printers I can pull up may old workhorse printers and get current drivers.

I decided years ago that I would never buy an HP PC, although I have several HP printers. In May I bought an HP 1020n, and within 2 weeks had also bought an HP scanner and my 2nd HP digital camera. I have had a few issues, all software related and due to the camera/scanner combo, but HP did a pretty good job of helping me straighten them out. There is a lot of basic and intro software, but I had the same thing with my last PC which was a pre-HP Compaq. I just uninstalled the stuff I didn't want. If you go HP, make the System Recovery DVD/CD set ASAP just in case.
9403	11	135387	1536246	1531414	Willy	11/14/05 6:33 AM	1.13194998E12	About the same...	I find support for HP quite easily though at times need to dig. I do know what to get besides what HP offers in dealing with direct componet details which helps alot. However, I don't find HP any harder to deal with than other systems. Yeah, some days are better than others but can be for any system out there. remember, some suystems its really a good idea to walk away from after usually 5yrs. in order to keep abreast of the latest offering out there. Staying with older systems can only get harder, but even then it can be done just harder. If you really want to complain about a system vendor look into Sony, wooo!. tada -----Willy
