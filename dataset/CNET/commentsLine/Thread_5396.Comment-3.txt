have not tried different driver versions, no raid, programs in background are fewer than my slower system (i run minimal background apps-running about 200-220mb pf usage...msconfig...).
yes it is amazing how much memory is used, however my older system handles up to 850mb pf usage, (not sure if the pf is a good tell tale, but it is something i can go by...lol)new system slows and &quot;thinks&quot; at about 350mb pf usage.
video bios settings have been taken care of---256, not sure what pallette snooping is.
ready built system, i added vid card.
intel 915g socket 775a....i think it is &quot;a&quot; onboard video, sound, etc.
i disabled onboard vid in bios when i installed card.
i am thinking it may b a mobo problem as this is a refurb, or just operator problems...lol.
going to try resuming onboard and see if maybe vid card is bad.
