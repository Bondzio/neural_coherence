all produced boards with both agp and pci express, they are almost all exclusively based on the via pt880 series of chipsets, and usually offer a pcie x16 mechanical slot, which is only wired for x4 transfers.
i would suggest considering a tv tuner board in addition to your new pci express board, instead of spending a great deal of time and money looking for a fairly proprietary motherboard design, especially as the pt880 is no longer a new chipset, which causes some problems for future upgrades.
asrock at a time produced an amd motherboard which offered pci express x16 (full x16 transfers) and agp 8x (full speed as well), based on a uli solution, however this board is notoriously hard to find, especially now that uli is part of nvidia.
additionally, this board was designed for socket 939, socket am2 could be ammended to it through means of a proprietary add-in board, which is usually even harder to find.
the setup actually work fairly well, it was just very hard to find available for purchase.
i know that at one time newegg sold the board, however i'm doubting if they still do.
