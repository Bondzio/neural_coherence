Hello, I'm a high school student, and I was woundering what type of motherboard/CPU combo would be something that I could afford. I don't really want to spend more than $300 on the pair. I am a gamer, I would like to have Serial ATA, Raid 0 + 1, and at least 4 slots for memory(specificly DDR400), AMD hopefully, and other goodies like that. What would be the best bang for the buck for the things that I would like? Also, i would like a bios that i can overclock with, and set memory timings.

Pricewatch searches many different sites for the best prices for a lot of stuff. Newegg's prices are very competitive. I would recommend getting it there if it is only a few dollars more than somewhere else.
