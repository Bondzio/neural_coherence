since you already have a working network, just put your printer directly &quot;on the wire&quot;.
you didn't say what type of connection your printer has, but even if it's parallel, you can buy one for about $50-$75 that goes from parallel (usb,ect) to rj45 (lan cable)and has a web based interface to setup.
i've use in an office environment and it worked well.
good luck.
(an example:)
