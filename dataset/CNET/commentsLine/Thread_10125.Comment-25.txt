along with many of the common sense ways to cool your computer, there are also two major ways you can also keep your invesment cool.
------------------------------------- positive airflow vs negitive airflow ------------------------------------- ++++++++++++++++++ +positive airflow+ ++++++++++++++++++ -positive airflow is when you have more air flowing into your case than you have flowing out.
-if you can constantly have cold air blowing in, then this works great.
-its not the best because you will have more dust flowing in.
-it may circulate already hot air thats trapped in your system.
***this only works well if you have a 120mm fan stuck to the side of your case that runs high rpm.
it's not so good because the hot air takes longer to circulate out.
if your room is constantly cold, then you might be able to pull it off*** ++++++++++++++++++ +negitive airflow+ ++++++++++++++++++ -negitive airflow is when your fans are sucking out more air than they are forcing in.
-works well even in cramped or hot rooms.
-circulates the hot air out a lot faster.
***i use negitive airflow, i also recommend it.
blowing air on your componets are one thing, but it wont mean jack if your blowing hot air on them.
so having a case setup to circulate new air in and circulate the onld air out even faster is, in my opinion, the smarter thing to do.
*** my setup(good example of negitive airflow setup): +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ air blowing out- rear: 2x 80mm fans front bottom: one 80mm fan +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ air blowing in- side of case: one 80mm fan +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ neutral cooling- -cpu fan -video card fans -chipset fan -memory cooler -harddisk cooler +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ hope this helped!
