I have an old HP that's going to have to last me a little longer.
So yes, I realize some of these dated CPU's are overpriced relative to more powerful options.
I am however, limited by my motherboard.
Here is the situation.
My motherboard: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00906129&lc=en&cc=de&dlc=en&product=3424294%E2%8C%A9=en My current CPU: http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103776 The Options: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103645 I realize this is above 5600+.
However, TDP is still 89w.
Is it safe to say this would be compatible?
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103771 Though this is an older core and has TDP of 89w rather than the 65w of its Brisbane equivalent, it boasts double the L2 cache.
This is for a PC that is heavily used for gaming, and 3-D graphics software (decreasing rendering times is a huge thing).
What do you recommend?
