i just moved my dlink 524 router to another computer.
the internet works, im surfing it now.
i just cant open up the window to configure the router.
i dont know if it matters, but the pc that was connected to the router before was using a cable modem, but now we switched ISPs and now its running through a DSL line.
pc: P4 1.4GZ, 128MB Ram (im upgrading soon), 64MB VRAM, Windows XP Home Ed.
