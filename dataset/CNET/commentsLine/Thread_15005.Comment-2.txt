the a+ cert will not get you a job in this day and age.
if you already work in the computer it field, employers will often require that you keep current certifications from comptia, microsoft, etc.
at their expense.
in my opinion, getting a bachelors or preferably a masters degree will greatly increase your chances of employment as well as greatly increasing your salary.
