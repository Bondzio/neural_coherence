I'll have my desktop which will act as my main computer and 2 laptops that will access wirelessly. I want to have these 3 computers backup to, and store data on a 500gb external hard drive. Is there an adapter that I can run from the router to the external drive so the laptops don't have to access through the desktop first. Thanks.
