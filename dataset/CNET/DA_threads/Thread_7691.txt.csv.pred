1.1.1	i have DSL but i am getting cable internet next month .	St
1.1.2	I want to know do i need to buy a cable router or will my existing DSL router work with the cable internet ?	Ques
1.1.3	I have verizon DSL and I am switching to Road Runner ( time warner cable ) internet .	St
1.2.1	because a cable is n't a phone line .	St
1.2.2	If the adsl-modem is integrated in your current router ( or if the router is integrated in your current modem , that 's the same ) you 'll need a new one .	St
1.2.3	But I think Roadrunner will supply you with a modem .	St
1.2.4	A only-router router will be able to talk with it .	St
1.2.5	A ADSL-modem-router combined may have the necessary connection to talk with it .	St
1.2.6	And possible Roadrunner will supply you with a 'multi-PC-modem ' .	St
1.2.7	And that IS a & quot ; cable router & quot ; .	St
1.2.8	Better ask Roadrunner what exactly they have in store for you .	St
1.2.9	If it 's for one PC only , ask them what you need to connect it to multiple PC 's and if your current router will work .	St
1.2.10	It might depend also if they give you something with a USB-connection or with a RJ45-connection .	Sug
1.2.11	Only they know what you 'll get , and only you know what you have .	St
1.2.12	Together you must be able to find out how it 's going to work .	St
