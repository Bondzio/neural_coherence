1.1.1	Hi , recently my friend is looking for a good computer that would be good for gaming , his price range is 350 .	St
1.1.2	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.2.1	Done .	St
1.2.2	Gaming is a sure thing .	St
1.2.3	For the computer they could get a free old one from freecycle or the free area of craiglist and that will do the rest .	St

1.3.1	Typically prices for gamer PC 's are n't cheap or within that $ 350 range .	St
1.3.2	You can buy a PC in the USA when on sale or & quot ; entry level & quot ; models that are in $ 350+ excludes taxes and/or any S/H , but a decent price should start in the $ 500 or more .	St
1.3.3	It still depends on what is put into the PC as well , because better named devices or performance to include GPU , PSU and/or extra cooling etc .	St
1.3.4	not to mention the case as well would push pricing up .	St
1.3.5	So , let 's be realistic in finding a gaming PC would demand better funds to spend .	St
1.3.6	I exclude the availability of any used parts or carry-over parts to a newer PC that one can build .	St
1.3.7	Also , the OS for now is generally when a retail versions is in the $ 100+ range as an added expense if not carried over from old PC in legitimate fashion .	St
1.3.8	good luck tada -- -- -Willy	Polite
