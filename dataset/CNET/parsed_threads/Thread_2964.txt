<s> Hello all, I use dual Samsung 245BW SyncMaster monitors and I've recently noticed that one of them displays a slight yellow or off-white hue. </s>
<s> I use the exact same display settings on both monitors. </s>
<s> Additionally, I tried playing with the settings on the suspect monitor and it doesn't seem to help the problem at all. </s>
<s> Below are links to two pictures of the problem. </s>
<s> These aren't the best photos in the world, but hopefully they help. </s>
<s> The monitor in question is the one on the right. </s>

<s> As CCFL (the lamp) age you see that happen. </s>
<s> Somewhere around 5 years they tend to move to pink or red. </s>
<s> This is why you want to replace these with LED back lit displays when they have grown old. </s>
<s> I will not write word one about any monitor settings. </s>

<s> http://benchmarkreviews.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=168&Itemid=68&limit=1&limitstart=6 is worthy reading since it shows how CCFL and some displays are less than perfect in the lighting. </s>
<s> Now we have to ask how much is a perfect display? </s>
<s> I think we need to look at BARCO displays to see how much this could cost. </s>
