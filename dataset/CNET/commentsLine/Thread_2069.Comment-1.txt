i have inherited an old 500mhz machine that i am looking to turn into a media server.
it came with a 10gb hd, so for obvious reasons, i'm looking to increase the storage.
i have found a 300 gb ata/133 that i am interested in, but i don't know if my machine can handle it.
are there maximums for a machine's hd size?
also, before i buy a hard drive, i want to make sure it has a compatible interface.
i know my machine works with ata drives, and this drive says it uses parallel ata.
is this the same thing?
my machine is a hp pavillion 6630. thanks in advance!
