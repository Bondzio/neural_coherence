sadly the last test is to try it on another pc.
often a part of these all in ones will fail and if the &quot;copy&quot; button works we still need to test if it works on other pc as a test of the all in one.
there are other reasons today such as malware damage, firewalls and more but your post didn't tell if you tried the uninstall and reinstall without the pc being &quot;protected.&quot; bob
