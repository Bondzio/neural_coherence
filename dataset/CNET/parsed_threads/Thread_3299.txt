<s> Just picked up a NAS box for my Seagate 400 Gig SATA drive. </s>
<s> Got it connected to my network and in the process I found that the drive needed to be formatted in EXT3. </s>
<s> Never heard of it before. </s>
<s> I used the NAS and it's software to format the drive and it works perfectly. </s>
<s> A short search said EXT3 was a Linux format. </s>
<s> Anyone know why the drive had to use that format? </s>
<s> Is that standard? </s>
<s> Is the little computer inside that box is running Linux and to avoid Microsoft's fee for that other file system they went with an open source or free file system. </s>
