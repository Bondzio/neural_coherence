<s> So, I guess it's relatively self-explanatory. </s>
<s> The Original Asus Eee Pad Transformer was supposed to update to Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0) on the 24th when it was released to the rest of the world. </s>
<s> However, I've been constantly smashing the check update buttons for the last few days. </s>
<s> So, can someone please explain to me why my Transformer hasn't updated and when it may come? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> So, I called Asus Support and they said that the ICS update servers were congested [just like my nose]. </s>
