noticed there was not much on cnet regarding them so i thought i give a short post about my experience maybe someone will find it helpful.
i am extremely impressed with their customer service and quality of craftmanship.
their ordering system is also very pleasing and simple to use.
i get to easily pick and choose which parts i want to put together without being restricted.
i wasn't sure exactly what i needed and spoke to one of their live chat agents who suggests anything that will improve your system given your budget and the purpose for your computer.
i will continue to purchase my systems from this company, because i haven't seen a better company, yet.
they by far outperform dell, hp, and all the big name computer retailers with their low prices, great customer service, quality work, and personability.
i think they are a smaller company which is probably the reason they are striving so hard to make a good impression, which is the business model all small businesses should follow.
overall, a recommended company.
thanks for a great experience ironside and hopefully this post helps spread the word about your great company.
