<s> i just got a new video card that needs at least 300W power supply. </s>
<s> i'd like to replace the one I have which is only 250W. </s>
<s> What should I get? </s>
<s> I use Antec in my home-builts. </s>
<s> Affordable and reputable. </s>
<s> For your use, something around 500 watts. </s>
<s> with 135 mm fan and pfc. </s>
<s> i have had good success with it. </s>
<s> volt/amps are very important and you want to look for 12v/34 amps. </s>
<s> you need the amps/volts to run newer video cards these days. </s>
<s> this is almost more important than wattage. </s>
