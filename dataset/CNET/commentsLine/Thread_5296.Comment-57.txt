many systems sold today include integrated video with allows the systems to be immediately useable for basic users.
todays integrated video can handle most basic tasks like internet explorer, word, excel, etc.
however, virtually all systems that offer the integrated video also provide at least 1 pci-e slot to accomodate the addition of a more powerful graphics card.
due to the universality of the graphics cards sold today, most, if not all, will work in any standard pci-e slot.
because of that, most systems can be easily upgraded to an external graphics card with a simple settings change to the bios.
some systems are sophisticated enough to automatically sense the installation of an external graphics card and will automatically disable the integrated video for you.
thue, the bottom line is that you shouldn't worry about the graphics upgradabiliy of the system that you are considering.
rather, concentrate on the storage capacity, processing capability and manufacture support as these are more likely to be issues for you going forward.
