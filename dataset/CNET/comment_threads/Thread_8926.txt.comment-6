It's a little slow on the menus.
In fact, I'd say it needs to get about 1/2 the time to display stuff for me to never note it as a nuisance.
The other gotcha is that Dlink doesn't reveal how to encode video for playback.
I've had to use the old trial and error method and still haven't nailed it.
I'd try another Media Center like that when I can this year, but for now its working.
