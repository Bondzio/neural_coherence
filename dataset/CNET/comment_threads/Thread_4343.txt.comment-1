Can you recommend configuration?
I will have DSL next wk for 2 home PCs (WinXP) both in same room to be used mainly for music downloads, netsurfing by my 2 teens.
Although PCs will share same DSL line, at this time, there's no need for them to share data and each has own printer.
If a router is required, what type to buy to avoid the common dropped connection problem?
Money is an issue.
