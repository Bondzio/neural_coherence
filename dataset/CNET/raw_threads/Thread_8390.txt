7700	0	62298	738580	NR	Michael Geist	2/3/05 6:26 PM	1.10745516E12	Curious firewire issue....	I have a 3 port Via 6306 chipped 1394 card, which I am installing under XP Pro. XP ids the card with its native Via drivers but also adds a 1394 Net Adapter which is disabled in Network Adapters. It seems XP alone adds this networking functionality because the same card in 98SE and W2K does not. I thought I read something about a patch which addressed this issue but I have been unable to find it. Any ideas?
