1.1.1	hello , I just recently purchased a new samsung 80 gig hard drive and did a clean win 2000 install on it , however once I was done and checked in my computer and looked at the c : drive it says it only has a capactiy of 7.82 gigs , also when I did the install I chose to use ntfs but it says im using fat file system , is this a reason for the missing size ?	Ques
1.1.2	the computer is an hp x86 with 32 kb ram .	St
1.2.1	your using the old fat 16 format .	St
1.2.2	You must choose to use the large file system .	St
1.2.3	which will be fat32 or ntfs .	St
1.2.4	Also , 2000 requires at least 128 megs of ram .	St
1.3.1	your using the fat 16 file system .	St
1.3.2	you must choose to use large file system in the beginning .	St
1.3.3	Which would be fat32 or ntfs .	St
1.3.4	You also need at least 128 megs of ram for 2000 .	St
1.4.1	is there a way to change this now or do I have to do a complete reinstall ?	Ques
1.4.2	btw I didi choose to use ntfs so I have no clue to what happened	St
1.5.1	is to start over .	St
1.5.2	did you use a disk to format your drive besides 2000 ?	Ques
1.5.3	you should of recieved another disk with your new drive .	St
1.5.4	You can also use a old 98 or ME startup disk and boot to dos and type fdisk .	St
1.5.5	choose large disk format , delete partition then make new .	St
1.5.6	you would need to go into your bios first and change to floppy boot first .	St
1.6.1	File system issue : Fat16 has a hard limit of 2gb in 9x and 4 Gb in NT based oses .	St
1.6.2	It is not fat 16 .	St
1.6.3	Probably fat32 .	St
1.6.4	from a run line type & quot ; convert c : & quot ; ( or d : or whatever ) & quot ; /fs : ntfs & quot ; to convert to ntfs .	St
1.6.5	Size : Is it 7.82 or 78.2 ?	Ques
1.6.6	Computers think in a base 2 system , so where we think 1000 MBs to a GB they think 1024 .	St
1.6.7	So reporting is usally off because that .	St
1.7.1	after I make new partition what do I do , I trie to format from dos but couldnt so I used win 98 cd because I do not have enough memory to run win 2000 and the hard drive still only came up showing 7.82 gig 's .	St
1.7.2	btw the option i was to choose when it was time to make new partition was make primary dos partition correct ?	Ques
1.8.1	ok I have figured out the formatting and partitioning issues ... ( thx for the help ) but no matter what I do and I chose large disk support and everything as instructed but it still is only showing as it 's an 8 gig hard ddrive instead of 80 , im at wits end and dont know what to do to get it to use all of my disk space	St
1.9.1	From what I can tell you have a many year old machine with a BIOS that may not understand large drives .	St
1.9.2	You 'll want to try some 32GB drive , then under 64GB drive to see where its limit is .	St
1.9.3	Bob	St
