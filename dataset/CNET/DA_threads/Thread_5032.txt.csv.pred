1.2.1	& quot ; Tip : If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem , please be sure to include all the necessary information ( ie : operating system , model number , hardware , software , etc ) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution. & quot ; No mention of the OS , but your mention of RPC gives a clue your machine may have become infected with one of the MS Blaster , Nachi or other worms .

1.2.2	Before you think & quot ; Oh , that ca n't happen because I run an Antivirus , be aware that these worms are not stopped by today 's antivirus programs. & quot ; Such worms can cause a posting like yours .	St
1.2.3	Here 's an article about MS-Blaster and it 's removal .	St
