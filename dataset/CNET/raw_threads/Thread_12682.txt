If I recall correctly, this system has &quot;Integrated&quot; sound - which I thought was built into the MoBo. Here is the system info. for the sound. (Device Description) (Type) VIA AC'97 Enhanced Audio Controller PCI

Most MOBOs only accept sound from 1 drive, even when having 2 plugs. These are for different types of plugs, not both at once (I fell for that one, way back when). Good luck. chuck

I have made sure that the mute button on the player is unchecked, and I can't find any other settings that might be causing this.

Make sure the &quot;Wave&quot; sound source Mute box is UNCHECKED and its volume is up. (If there is no Volume icon next to your clock, go to the &quot;Sounds and Audio Devices&quot; control panel, click on the &quot;Volume&quot; tab, and and click &quot;Advanced&quot;.) To make it simple, you might want to UNCHECK all Mute boxes and turn up all volumes, to cover all sources. Also, if you installed a retail version of a DVD drive, there should be a port for a 3 or 4 pin audio cable in the back of the drive. The other end of the sound cable plugs into the motherboard (if you have motherboard integrated sound) or into your sound card (if you have a PCI sound card).

I also have an old DVD-ROM in the system (with same problems) It plays audio cd's, mp3s, and even a DVD created with the packaged nero6. So, when I put in a commercial DVD... NO AUDIO. I got one pop up about Dolby decoders, but unable to find a reference to this online. Any help is appreciated. MrB
