i downloaded a program called sea tools from sea gate for checking the new disk.
i restarted the computer and checked that the disk was recognized by the bios.
then i ran the sea tools program.
it did not recognize the disk.
i checked rescan in the program.
the program hung and i had to restart the computer.
may be the bios recognizes the external connections.
but when some program tries to access the disk, the error creeps in.
looks like my new disk is doa.
