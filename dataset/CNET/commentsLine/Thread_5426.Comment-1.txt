hello ive done something really stupid.
i sent my computer off for repair (apple powerbook g4) but as it was not going to be ready before i left on my travels i asked the repair company to send me my hard drive (60gb).
i put the hard drive in a caddy and connected it to my friends mac (heres the stupid bit) i put an ac power source and not dc as it said on the caddy and now my friends (ex) usb port dosnt work nor does my hard drive.
i have tried it in a new caddy but it still does not work.
does anybody have any ideas?
cheers lee
