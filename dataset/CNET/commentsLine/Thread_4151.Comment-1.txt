my dvi port on my gateway fdp2185 monitor (built april 06) has gone bad.
now i have to use the vga port and there is blurriness around text (images look fantastic).
native resolution 1680 x 1050. i have a nvdia 8600 gt dual dvi card with the latest driver.
i'm using the dvi/vga adapter that came with this card.
in xp/sp3, i have changed the smooth edges from cleartype to standard and back again.
cleartype looks better than standard, but it is still blurry.
is there a way to get clear text?
this is my work computer and 90% of its use is completely text.
i was told replacing the dvi port needs microsoldering and it is probably more cost effective to buy a new monitor.
