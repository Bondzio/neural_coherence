my inquiry is a general question about lcd monitors about which i hope someone can enlighten me.
my current lcd monitor is a 19&quot; monitor.
i am looking to buy a new larger lcd monitor for a new computer system i am building.
i noticed that there are many new larger lcd monitors.
all of the larger lcd monitors are wide-screen monitors.
that is, they retain the same height as my current 19&quot; monitor but are wider, anywhere from 20&quot; wide to 30&quot; wide within a reasonable price range.
while i am interested in some of these new lcd monitors for my new computer system i am curious as to why the larger lcd monitor technology are all wider than my current monitor but not proportionally taller as far as the display area goes.
why is that ?
i would have assumed that as newer, larger lcd monitors are being engineered that the display area of the monitor would be proportionally larger so that it could display both a greater width and a greater height.
