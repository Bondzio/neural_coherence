1.1.1	which video card is best for moderm video games : is it RADEON 9200 , or RADEON 9600 ?	Ques
1.2.1	The 9600 wins on better .	St
1.2.2	That model is however bested by even more current models .	St
1.2.3	Let me be clear the 9200 is a value card and while better than last years cheaps , is today 's value card .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I just bought ATI Radeon9200 128 DDR PCI ( I dont have agp slot ) .	St
1.3.2	Its cheaper and work fine and have TV Out option with Dual monitor support.If you wantcheaper card with very good performance than go for 9200 .	St
1.3.3	If you have money then go for 9600 agp .	St
1.4.1	He is right , 9600 is better .	St
1.4.2	I do n't know what games you want to play ... or what processor you use , or how much RAM or if you have an AGP ( Accelerated Graphics Port ) on your Motherboard .	St
1.4.3	But all of that aside .	St
1.4.4	If I were you , looking for a relativley inexpensive soulution to play modern video games ( I 'm assuming games such as Unreal 2004 , Half-Life Counterstrike , Half-Life 2 , Hitman : Contracts , Halo etc..etc..etc.. ) I would splurge on something like the Radeon 9800Pro 128MB .	St
1.4.5	You might ask why ?	Ques
1.4.6	Here is why The Radeon 9600XT ( Top of the 9600 line , above pro ) costs around $ 150- $ 240 ( $ 240 is for AIW ) The MSI RX9800PRO ( Radeon 9800Pro ) costs $ 195.99 To explain this more to you , the Radeon 9800 Pro is one of the best cards you can buy .	St
1.4.7	It will perform just like its $ 400 Big brother the Radeon 9800XT , and it can double the performance of the 9600 .	St
1.4.8	The 9200 for modern video games basicly is n't an option , it runs like a GeForce FX 5200 , they are budget cards designed for some gaming , but more for basic computing .	St
1.4.9	If you would specify if you have an AGP that would be very nice .	St
1.4.10	Also how big is your PSU ( Power Supply Unit ) the 9800Pro needs either 300W or 350W minimum , I know its somewhere in there .	St
1.4.11	Hope this helps .	St
1.5.1	http : //graphics.tomshardware.com/graphic/20031229/index.html http : //graphics.tomshardware.com/graphic/20031229/vga-charts-03.html # unreal_tournament_2003 Can check other games for performance there .	St
