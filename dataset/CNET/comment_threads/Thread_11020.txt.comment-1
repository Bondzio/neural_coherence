I have a P4 2.4 Ghz (800 Mhz FSB, HT) with 1 GB of RAM, and 8xAGP.
I currently have an nVidia GeForce FX 5200 video card with 128 MB of RAM.
The card is decent, but I notice it slowed down on some of the newer games I have.
I want to upgrade, but have a limited budget (less than $200) to spend.
I've been looking at ATI's Radeon 9800 Pro with 128 MB of RAM.
Is this a significant upgrade over what I have?
I just want to make sure I'm making a decent upgrade...meaning an upgrade that will speed up the newer games out there.
Any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks, BB
