<s> I divided my hard drive into two partitions, C:/ which contained the OS, and D:/ which would be for storage. </s>
<s> Some time later the Windows 7 installed on C:/ became corrupted to the point of no boot. </s>
<s> I backed up everything necessary, formatted D:/, and installed a fresh copy of Windows 7 there. </s>
<s> It works fine, and when booting, boot manager gives me the option to boot Windows 7 or Windows 7, and selecting the first one boots the fresh install without a problem. </s>
<s> Note that the 217GB storage partition previously known as D:/ is now known as C:/, containing the fresh functional OS, and the 80GB partition with the old corrupted OS is now D. I don't know why they switched. </s>
<s> A screenshot from Disk Management captures the problem: http://i.imgur.com/x4Gey6A.png I want to (safely) format D, containing the old corrupted windows, but cannot do so as it is the primary partition and the system partition. </s>
<s> After formatting I wouldn't mind merging the partitions either. </s>
<s> Why not do just that and once done, reformat the whole drive or wipe it clean. </s>
<s> Then reformat and make that whole drive available as &quot;C&quot;. </s>
<s> All you're doing is safeguarding your old &quot;C&quot; drive data either by backup or save critial data you deem necessary. </s>
<s> Again, once done reformat. </s>
<s> In the install the OS, once it asks do you want to use the whole drive, select yes and allow to reclaim all space. </s>
<s> However, I like to truly wipe it clean to remove all past anything and thus start fresh. </s>
<s> Once that's done, I then reformat or install the OS providing it reclaims all space and proceed. </s>
<s> I use KILLDISK or DBAN free versions for disc wiping. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I want to format D, which used to be C, and D is currently the primary partition and the one containing the boot info. </s>
<s> I cannot format it in any of the usual ways, and if I circumvent the warnings and do so anyway, my computer will not boot. </s>
<s> I would like to get rid all of the old corrupt windows data in D and merge it with C, without installing windows again.There was no option during install to use the whole drive. </s>
<s> Since, you don't want any data from the old &quot;C&quot; partition, then proceed to use the same info I posted earlier for the current &quot;C&quot; drive. </s>
<s> Now, you want to do w/o clearing or making a mess, BUT you already did that when you accepted the old &quot;D&quot; partition as &quot;C&quot; making this process diffcult. </s>
<s> You have to start all over again and remove *ANYTHING* as in prior formats, FAT setup, data, etc., in order to start fresh. </s>
<s> Once all that is done, install OS again and retrieve any data you saved back to re-installed pgm. </s>
<s> folders/directories or simply from scratch again. </s>
<s> No matter what you do outside of what I already suggested is going to be a hassle or require intense effort and still not be 100% sure it will work. </s>
<s> If you acquire any s/w to do this, then you rely totally on it doing the job again you build on a framework of the old, even if corrected. </s>
<s> So, if that s/w if free and available get it, otherwise you need some partition s/w to do this. </s>
<s> Look at PM, partition magic or similar. </s>
<s> More than likely if it works will be a one-time use unless repeated faults. </s>
<s> http://www.top5freeware.com/top-5-free-disk-partition-software-for-windows Hopefully one of the above should work. </s>
<s> However, in the time involved you can do this as I suggested and clean the mess and re-install. </s>
<s> IMHO, partition manager and GParted I like. </s>
