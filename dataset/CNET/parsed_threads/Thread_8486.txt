<s> I recently upgraded from 2K to XP Pro and all was well, for awhile. </s>
<s> The system started getting slower and slower and would lock up at times. </s>
<s> I would have to hit reset to get back up. </s>
<s> I ran all the necessary scans on the system and found nothing. </s>
<s> After a few more lockups, I took it to my shop thinking I had bad memory. </s>
<s> Changed to new memory and no change. </s>
<s> When turned on one time, I heard a &quot;pop&quot; in the area of the PS. </s>
<s> Installed new PS and no change in system performance. </s>
<s> Ran the Windows task mgr and under performance saw that CPU usage would spike to 95% most of the time and I had nothing running. </s>
<s> I disconnected the network cbl and the usage dropped to 5% MAX. </s>
<s> Everything worked fast again. </s>
<s> Put cbl back in and I was back to the same bad performance with 95%+ CPU usage when nothing was running. </s>
<s> I have reinstalled the XP upgrade several times with no change. </s>
<s> Thinking it might be the 10/100 adapter on the mobo, I put in a PCI card and disabled all the other adapters. </s>
<s> Same problem. </s>
<s> I am at a total loss here. </s>
<s> Any help would be great! </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> I can't find any make or model in your post. </s>
<s> I can't find if you installed drivers that Microsoft won't either. </s>
<s> Sorry if I missed it but could you fill me in on what I couldn't find? </s>
<s> Sorry for the omission Home grown XP Pro SP2 (with all updates - I think) 2.20 Gig AMD Athlon XP 1 Gig Ultra PC3200 memory Asus A7n8X-E Deluxe Mobo with Marvell Yukon 88E8001/03/10 PCI Gigabit Ethernet controller built in 2 NEC 3550 Cd/DVD drives 3.5 floppy 200 gig WD (drive C) 260 gig WD (drive D) Nvidia TNT2 graphics card I took out the D-Link ethernet controller Hope this helps. </s>
<s> All the drivers for the Asus A7n8X-E, video card and more. </s>
<s> Just installing XP SP2 is not enough. </s>
<s> Downloaded the Nforce 5.10 update from Asus site. </s>
<s> Seemed to only update the audio drivers. </s>
<s> Saw on another site that this update would &quot;update&quot; the whole mobo. </s>
<s> Not sure what the video card has to do with it. </s>
<s> The network worked ok before this problem started and the video card has not changed. </s>
<s> But let's not talk about SYSTEM IDLE PROCESS and it's 95%... </s>
