Is this possible, and if so, how feasible (reasonable temps even on air cooling, stability, etc.), and what accompanying RAM overclock is required? Secondly, will DDR2-800 RAM be sufficient (assuming I will have to OC it to at least somewhat)? (I saw DDR-800 here since I have seen a few discussions that seem to say that RAM with stock speeds above 800 are sometimes unstable. Any input is appreciated. If it matters, I will be using some flavor of Asus P5Q motherboard most likely.
