Allright... something is wrong with my display - whenever I boot up my comp now, its checkerboard colors... I can tell that it is changing and loading, but something is wrong. I sent my videocard back to ATI, and got a new one back but it didnt help any. Ive got an AMD 2500+ OC'ed to a 3000+ I have - ATI Radeon AIW 9800 Pro 512 MB Ram Basically, I need a mobo that is AGP compatible and a decent CPU to go with it; and also it needs to have decent onboard audio because I have a 4.1 logitech system. I have AMD now, but would not care really if it was AMD or Intel, whatever is better for the money. I plan on ditching the mobo/cpu i have now bvecause i feel like it would be too much of a hastle to swap CPUs with a new mobo... not to mention the CPU might be the prob anyway. I spent around $200 when I built the comp 3 years ago... I would prefer to spend about that or less if I could. Thanks in advance for any help!

Awesome, thanks for the recommendation... the reason I dont care about pci-express as much is because i think that the card I have still sells for a couple hundred and it would not be worth upgrading it... but i may be wrong on that part...? anything anyone can recommend for under $150? Im not sure if 64 bit or dual core is better? And would it be worth it to wait till next month or anything? Thanks again!

I don't know what you use your computer for (gaming, office, Home theater, etc.) so it's kind of hard to make a solid recommendation. The CPU/mobo combo I listed above is what I would call a budget, best-bang-for-the-buck, upgrade. If you want nothing to do with gaming or multimedia then you could easily get a celeron D and save another $50 or so. The PCI-express thing is more about &quot;room to grow&quot;, AGP is an EOL (end of life) technology, which means that at some point graphics card vendors are going to stop producing cards that use the AGP bus. If you at some point to want to upgrade your video card, you could end up having to do a complete system upgrade. As a stop-gap, inexpensive upgrade however an AGP motherboard is fine. as for dual core (64bit extensions are not as important for your needs I would think); it's pretty much the industry standard now and for $120 is a helluva deal.
