yes... but a 7900gtx is a tad outta my budget.. say if i had to stay with the 7600 series, you're recommending the 256 mb with 590mhz rather than the 512mb 420mhz?
i suppose it is a matter of the card being able to use all the memory sufficiently.. i'd need an agp version as well, i don't have pcie slots.
do you know any good sites for graphics cards?
