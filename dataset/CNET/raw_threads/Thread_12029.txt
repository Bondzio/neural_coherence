2121	0	332688	2992118	NR	WatArun	3/1/09 2:11 PM	1.23591666E12	Beware of Asus M2A-VM	Bought an Ibuypower 528-GN, through Tiger Direct, on 18 Dec 08. System arrived on 8 Jan 09. Video kept locking up. Screen would freeze or go black, using both video card and on-board vga outputs. Troubleshot with local experts (after no response from Ibuypower tech support) and discovered the Mobo was bad. Got replacement Asus M2A-VM from Ibuypower, and that was bad too. Perhaps IBuypower got a bad batch of Asus M2A-VMs, and I got two of them. Bought an Asus M3A78-CM Mobo, installed, and system works fine now. I tried getting IBuypower tech support from 9 Jan to early Feb, and gave up. Just some words to the wise. Good luck out there.
