<s> I have 2 X2Gen 22&quot; widescreen monitors on my office PC. </s>
<s> The monitor resolution is 1680x1050. </s>
<s> The vid card in the PC could not drive them at that resolution. </s>
<s> I think I was able to get 1024x786. </s>
<s> The card was 256mb. </s>
<s> I bought a 512mb ATI Radeon X 1650 Pro. </s>
<s> I can drive the monitors at 1280x960. </s>
<s> But if I try both set at 1680x1050 60Hz refresh rate, one screen works fine and the other blinks on and off. </s>
<s> If I swap the cables at the monitor end the problem moves to the other monitor. </s>
<s> To me this means the problem is the video card. </s>
<s> The card says it has Dual Link Dual DVI output. </s>
<s> Should I use Dual Link cables? </s>
<s> Should I be able to drive 2 22&quot; screens at 1680x1050 with this card? </s>
<s> If not what card can do it? </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> There is another discussion about this on this forum but the bottom line for this monitor is you need that cable. </s>
<s> And one for each monitor too. </s>

<s> dual link cables are only necessary monitors that exceed 1920x1200. </s>
<s> it sounds like you're using an ati clone or extend mode that is merging a single display over both monitors rather than dual displays. </s>
<s> reduce your resolution back to 1280x960 and check your windows display properties. </s>
<s> do you have 2 monitors or 1? </s>
<s> Vid card is ATI Radeon X 1650 Pro with 512 meg vid RAM. </s>
<s> 2 DVI connectors. </s>
<s> Windows properties show 2 screens. </s>
<s> Native resolution on the screens is 1680x1050. </s>
<s> I want all the screen real estate that that resolution gets me. </s>
<s> And anything other than native resolution is extrapolated and never as crisp. </s>
<s> if so, ensure media center is configured without TV support and get the latest catalyst drivers from http://ati.amd.com/support/driver.html if you're running xp, also get the catalyst 7.4 drivers. </s>
<s> after you've installed them, turn off the the right-hand monitor and reboot. </s>
<s> next, open catalyst control center's advanced view and select &quot;displays manager&quot;, ensure you only have 1 monitor detected, and set your desired resolution and color depth. </s>
<s> select &quot;digital panel properties&quot; and enable &quot;alternate dvi operational mode&quot;. </s>
<s> now turn on the right-hand monitor, go back to &quot;displays manager&quot;, and click &quot;detect displays.&quot; click the 2nd monitor and set your desired resolution and color depth. </s>
<s> go to the 2nd &quot;digital panel properties&quot; and enabled &quot;reduce dvi frequency on high-resolution displays&quot;. </s>
<s> if that doesn't work, enable &quot;reduce dvi frequency&quot; on the first digital panel also. </s>
<s> as a last resort, you could use the dvi-vga converter and use your 2nd monitor with a vga input. </s>
<s> Using XP Pro. </s>
<s> Did not install any of the Catalyst stuff. </s>
<s> Just the plain drivers. </s>
<s> Got the Dual Link cables late yesterday. </s>
<s> Plugged them in this morning. </s>
<s> Both monitors running 1650x1080, 60Hz, 32bit color with no problems for 8 hours. </s>
