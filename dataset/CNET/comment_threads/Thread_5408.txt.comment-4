You also need a piece of gear such as HP's RF Network Analyzer http://wwwasic.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/testlab/g_info/HP4396A.html to see what the signals do on the cable from your USB 1.x speeds of 11 Mbps to 480 Mbps.
Given that it's a dollar for the cable, I don't understand when people don't use the right cable.
And since the cables are a dollar, why not slice a few open and see the difference?
