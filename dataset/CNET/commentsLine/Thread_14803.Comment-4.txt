as robert stated you can physically check to see if any additional hd mounting can be done.
however, since you already have 2 hds and probably a cd drive as well, your space is limited.
i assume you plan a 3rd hd and thus the physically check for space.
you can however, replace the smaller of two installed hds(should it be done) and install the newer larger hd.
full new hd kits usually have all you need as minor h/w and any s/w to make the install easier to include proper imaging of old hd to swap over.
-or- find info at hd maker's support website, worth the visit.
otherwise, as in a 3rd hd your mounting &quot;space&quot; is critical.
fyi- having all this installed will place a burden on your current psu if original to pc, so a larger capable psu is strongly suggested plus any additional cooling as having 3 hds will heat stress the pc.
just because if you get things going doesn't mean sooner or later issues won't arise to all installed.
the win7 os will quite capably handle additional hd.
any help guide, manual or setup guide should be read before the install as you maybe required additional steps for new hd install, don't take things for granted because of last install, though you are more aware of such.
