Hello, I need to build a PC that will be outside 24/7.
It will need to be in a protective casing that can withstand the elements.
Can you give me some recommendations on parts that can withstand the extreme in temperatures.
I need recommendations on motherboards, CPU, harddrives, fans and cases.
I will also need to get a PCMCIA card in order to send information back to the server.
Thanks in advance.
