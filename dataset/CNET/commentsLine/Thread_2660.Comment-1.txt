good day, well i've been on hear a few times with an issue of my pny 7600 gs graphics card running hot.
i have installed the card twice with new product.
i used the online live chat that emachines offer and was informed that the pny 7600 gs has known compatibility issues with emachines and to change to a different brand.
so i'm guessing that's why it was running hot.
any suggestions/comments would be great as to what graphic card will work.
thanks
