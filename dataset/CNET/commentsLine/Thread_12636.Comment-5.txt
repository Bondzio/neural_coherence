yeah, there is no partition manager free for merging partition, but there are most all of partition manager for extend partition, just for basic disk, not for dynamic disk, if you disk is dynamic disk, then merging or extend is the same cost.
if your disk is basic one, you can try this free partition wizard, minitool partition wizard, yeah, if your disk is not, you have to pay for it, for another minitool partition wizard edition.
, wish your disk is basic one, .
