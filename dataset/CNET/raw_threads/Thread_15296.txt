I plug it in my computer as usual and opened a document from a folder in the drive and start editing it. After working for a while I wanted to save.. when I click save it says that the path does not exist. So I checked my flash drive for the folder where I opened the document from... the folder is gone... only that folder, everything else is still there... Any ideas how it happened and more importantly is there anyway I can recover my lost files? Please help....... thanks
