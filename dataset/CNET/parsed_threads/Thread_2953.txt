<s> Win XP, 1.7 ghtz, 512ram, 60gb boot drive and 120gb slave. </s>
<s> I have Itunes on both drives. </s>
<s> I want many songs on my 120gb slave but not on the boot drive. </s>
<s> Every time I put songs on the slave they are automatically copied onto the boot drive. </s>
<s> Is there a simple way to avoid this? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> You probably have the option enabled in iTunes to copy songs to the iTunes folder when you add them to the library. </s>
<s> Disable that, and make sure you place the iTunes folder in the correct location and you should be all set. </s>
<s> Thank you for the reply. </s>
<s> I checked, and this selection: &quot;Copy files to iTunes Music folder when adding to library.&quot; is not checked. </s>
<s> Is there another possibility? </s>
