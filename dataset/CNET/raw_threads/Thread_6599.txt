I would also like to pay to have certain things overclocked. I did my vid card a little bit yesterday but the rest I would like to have done by a person skilled in that area as I do not want to read many guides on overclocking, This also was denied by best buy for same reason and not to my supprise my friends said that it was the same in almost all places except custom made computers on the internet however if you know of a place i would like to hear about it.

Im starting to wounder if there is a company that allows you to send in a computer so they can provide either or both of those services, I just know that there are webpages with customs that let you buy new ones that way. thanks for your post though.

Overclocking is not an assured thing and a business could be held liable for the failures, reboots and you may even be upset over a disk data loss. So let's just say &quot;never going to happen.&quot; If you want to do this, you will be doing this. Bob
