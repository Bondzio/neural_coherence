I don't really know what that means.
A new case for the external hd?
And then what?
Take the hd out of the old case?
Basically, again: I can't get the external hd to show up when I click &quot;My Computer&quot; even when the external hd appears to be turned on.
So I can't even run data recovery software until I can get the computer to recognize that the external hd is hooked up, right?
