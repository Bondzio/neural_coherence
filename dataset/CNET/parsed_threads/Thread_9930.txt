<s> I am having problems with dust in my computer. </s>
<s> I have my computer on for several hours a day, and I think that it is overheating, and when I took the case of my PC, I discovered that there was a lot of dust inside, especially on the fans. </s>
<s> Does anybody know what I can do about the dust, or if there are any solutions? </s>
<s> If you do, please let me know. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Blow out all case filters, fans, heatsinks and other components with a can of compressed air. </s>
<s> Add case filters to air intake vents. </s>
<s> Purchase them or fabricate them out of any fine mesh--nylon stocking, ScotchBrite pad, piece of household air filter, etc. </s>
<s> As another poster offered you can use some type of filter arrangement. </s>
<s> Just beware that you *HAVE* to maintain those filters and clean them, because if those get clogged up they will be worse than just a dusted fan or so, you cut-off the airflow supply. </s>
<s> If your system is on the floor or close to it, elevate it at least 6in. </s>
<s> or place on stand/small table, etc. </s>
<s> to reduce dust pick-up. </s>
<s> If you have pets, try to reduce thier dander or understand that can attribute to the dust problem. </s>
<s> You wil always have some dust and thus be prepared to maintain at &quot;your cleaning periods&quot; what's best for you. </s>
