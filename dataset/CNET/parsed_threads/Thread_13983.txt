<s> I'm looking at buying my new computer, since my Duron 1ghz of 3-4 years doesnt quite cut it for me anymore. </s>
<s> Choosing most of the specs have been very simple for me: Here's what I've lined up so far CPU: AMD64 Venice 3200+ Mobo: Gigabyte K8N Pro-SLI Mem: 1G Kingston DDR2 HDD: Maxtor 16M SATA 250G Drive1: Benq DW-1640 Gigabyte 16x DVD-RW Drive2: CD-RW/DVD Combo At the moment my system totals around $900+ Australian including setup My current dilemma is what Graphics card to put with it. </s>
<s> I had initially settled for a 256mb Gigabyte 9550 for $80 or so dollars to put into AGP, but as I've read more and more into it I've found that AGP is being rendered Obsolete by PCI-E. My question is, is there any sense shelling out $200-300 for a PCI-E card with the same RAM as opposed to sticking with AGP? </s>
<s> And with the aforementioned specs, are there any graphics cards that you could recommend that are within the low to medium budget range? </s>
<s> Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> If it helps I am interested in using the PC/Graphics card for gaming, 3D rendering on the side and also photoshop work. </s>
<s> If you are going to use the Gigabyte K8N Pro-SLI motherboard you have no option other than to use a PCIE videocard, there is no AGP slot on that board. </s>
<s> If you don't want to spend alot on a video card go with a 6600 series card minimum, and check out the 6800GS too. </s>
<s> Either of those would handle what you want to do fairly well. </s>
<s> Thanks, you saved me some considerable embarassment! </s>
<s> I didn't realise that it was without an AGP slot. </s>
<s> Thank you for your card recommendations. </s>
<s> Now I have to determine whether to go ATI or Radeon. </s>
<s> &quot;Now I have to determine whether to go ATI or Radeon.'' </s>
<s> Whoops--Radeon is an ATI product line. </s>
<s> I think you meant you have to determine whether to go with an ATI Radeon or an nVidia GeForce video card. </s>
<s> The gamers will tell you to go with nVidia cards. </s>
<s> Since you are going to buy an SLI motherboard your best choice would probably be an SLI capable Video card. </s>
<s> So you could get almost any of the nVidia based graphics cards from the 6600 LE and up, depending on how much money you want to spend. </s>
<s> nVidia SLI Zone: http://www.slizone.com/page/home.html nVidia certified SLI hardware: http://www.slizone.com/object/slizone2_build.html </s>
<s> Whoopsadaisy indeed. </s>
<s> I realised in hindsight and I had meant ATI or Nvidia, but sometimes the fingers type faster than the mind works, haha. </s>
<s> Thank you for your input </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Nvidia is the way to go. </s>
<s> Many of nvidia's graphics cards are now SLI ready. </s>
<s> Besides, nVidia currently has the best graphics card in the market, the 7800gtx. </s>
<s> In my opinion get the nVidia 7800gt, which isn't as good as the 7800gtx, but is close and you save alot more $$$ going with the 7800gt. </s>
<s> Also if you want, you can put the 7800gt in an SLI configuration later; to help with your photoshop, your 3-d gaming, etc. </s>
