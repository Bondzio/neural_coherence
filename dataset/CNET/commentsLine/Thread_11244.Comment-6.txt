this was brought at an auction, &quot;as is&quot; so the buyer beware always applies.
the sticker is probably stuck on some parted system somewhere.
these are the chances one takes at such affairs, but brother you can come out on top more often than not.
i rarely ever get loaded systems, but s/w is sometimes part of a lot or load as it were, you never know what you get.
in this case, i went for the xp as the hd i assumed(wrongly) would have the key, nope!
