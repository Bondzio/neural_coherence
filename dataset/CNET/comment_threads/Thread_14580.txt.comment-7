So far this monitor has been great except for one problem.
The 1680x1050 resolution is only working in analog mode.
I cannot get it to work in digital mode.
Instead it downgrades to 1280x1024 resolution and clips the output.
I can still get to the clipped areas by panning the screen by moving the mouse to the edge of the screen.
Is this expected or should I exchange the monitor?
I was planning on going back to the store and have them test this on another monitor and see if the blame is on my old video card.
