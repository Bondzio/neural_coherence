microsoft bought out a company that sold a virtual operating system called vmware.
they then brought out virtual pc and sold it for $99 bucks a copy.
this virtual pc allowed you to install it on top of a microsoft system nt200, xp, and now vista with virtual pc 2007. here's the kick, microsoft has made the system free, no more $99 bucks.
you can download it from the microsoft site  i bought the early version and installed it on a xp system and then installed four other versions of linux, and windows 98. it worked successfully and made it so that i could call up any one of the systems i needed.
i have not tried it with vista yet but according to microsoft's site, it works with vista.
