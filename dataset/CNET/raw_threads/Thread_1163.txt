Hey everybody, Looking for some help utilizing my Panasonic TH-42PX75U as a computer monitor running from my iBook G4. Unfortunately, my Panasonic does not have a VGA input. It does, however, have HDMI, S-Video, Component, and Composite. Anyone have any ideas as to how I could make this work? Will the picture quality be worth it? I'm a video editor who uses Final Cut Pro, so I'm hoping image quality can at least be decent... Thanks!

Some things went from VGA to composite but the resulting quality was not worth the effort. Hopefully you will get an answer to your problem P
