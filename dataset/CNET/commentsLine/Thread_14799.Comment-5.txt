hp has a bad habit of sticking with a &quot;standard&quot; in their company even if the customers are screaming.
in this case its dvd plus r/w drives.
you will not be happy with just a plus drive and you will be told by hp (or any sales-droid) that plus will be all you need.
given that i can buy an all format 8x dvd recorder for under 149 bucks, this is a piece of the machine that is definitely out of tune with today.
