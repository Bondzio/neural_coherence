1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	I got a 7640 model with the same specs and x2-5000.	St
1.5.2	Works great.	St
1.5.3	The only thing I will do eventually is put in a $100 video card with like the one of the 7600 nvidia's.	St
1.6.1	ive read its only a tiny 300w but im not absolutely certain... anyways its not over 400w for sure	St
1.7.1	Watch those posting dates.	St
1.8.1	I bought an HP a1730n just over a year ago.	St
1.8.2	It was great at first.	St
1.8.3	ONE day after the one year warranty expired, it completely crashed.	St
1.8.4	The hard drive and motherboard had to be replaced.	St
1.8.5	HP pre-loads and locks down the operating system to prevent theft or something, so the recovery disks made with the original don't work on the new hard drive.	St
1.8.6	They sent me replacement disks at my cost and those didn't work either.	St
1.8.7	After several frustrating calls to HP, they assured me they would send the correct disks (overnight delivery which was going to take 3 days - figure that one out!).	St
1.8.8	I never did receive those disks.	St
1.8.9	So, I marched right back to where I bought it, and after almost 5 hours (yes, five hours) of their tech service talking to many HP techs, HP couldn't figure out why the operating system wouldn't load.	St
1.8.10	HP never even offered to reimburse me for the disks that didn't work and told me that &quot;customer compensation&quot; is not covered under the warranty (which had expired by one day).	St
1.8.11	I sent a certified, return receipt letter to the President, who simply handed it off to a customer service rep that was empowered to do nothing more than apologize.	St
1.8.12	DO NOT BUY AN HP PRODUCT.	St
1.8.13	THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE AFTER-THE-SALE SERVICING AND DO NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS.	St
