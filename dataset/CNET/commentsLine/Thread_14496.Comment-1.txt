i'm recently subscribed to verizon dsl, and am attempting to network my 2 computers (a desktop and a laptop.
i ran the home networking wizard in windows on both computers, and correctly installed the westell versalink router i received from verizon, but when i try to send something from my laptop to my printer (connected to desktop), i get a printer not responding error message.
i am running windows me on the desktop, and xp on the laptop if that matters.
help!!!
!
