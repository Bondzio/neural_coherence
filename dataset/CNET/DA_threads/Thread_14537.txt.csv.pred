1.1.1	hi everyone, im looking for a storage solution.	St
1.1.2	i need it to be a usb 3.0 and an internal sata 3 6gbit/s interface.	St
1.1.3	3.5&quot; in size that needs no external power.	St
1.1.4	thanks in advance Roman	Polite
1.2.1	Does your PC support USB3?	Ques
1.2.2	Few do.	St
1.3.1	its a lenovo w510.	St
1.3.2	I believe it does, i got supertalent usb 3.0 flash drive, works like a beast.	St
1.4.1	http://www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory.aspx?SubCategory=92&name=External-Enclosures	St
1.5.1	if no 3.5 then 2.5. if a compatible drive is available.	St
1.6.1	i believe that there is no sata III interface enclosure out there in the options.	St
1.6.2	please advise...	Sug
1.7.1	your requirement is..no external power.	St
1.7.2	I believe any 3.5 harddrive will require extenal power to be effective (just my opinion).	St
1.8.1	is there any chance to use multiple jacks, like 2 or 4 usb ports to power the enclosure?	St
1.9.1	that are self powered USB are for laptop drives.	St
1.10.1	I don't know; but do you have such cable or are you going to make your own?	St
1.10.2	Give it a try and let us know.	St
1.11.1	Is not that complicated, it requires more motivation than skill.	St
1.11.2	USB 2.0 Ports are minimum 100ma of current supply - in desktops.	St
1.11.3	USB 3.0 Ports have a greater supply of current, at-least in theory they have 500ma of supply - again in desktops.	St
1.11.4	What about laptops, i cant get that information from lenovo, if someone has that information it would be great.	St
1.12.1	the features re drive capacity, power, port types, drive size, internal interface etc., you want.	St
1.12.2	The loss of speed would be negligible and the choices of external enclosures is endless depending on your criteria.	St
1.12.3	Later when USA 3.0 enclosures are available...you can switch.	St
1.12.4	VAPCMD	St
1.13.1	usb 3.0 are available its that sata 3 aren't.	St
1.14.1	NIL	St
1.15.1	$19 for a case and $19 for a controller.	St
1.15.2	It's not so if it can hit 2/3 of its max.	St
1.15.3	target (5Mbps).	St
1.16.1	5Gb vs. 6Gb.	St
