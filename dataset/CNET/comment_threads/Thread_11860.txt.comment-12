right click My Computer icon.
Choose properties General tab click on Device Manager Expand the item all the way on the bottm &quot;Universal Serial Bus Controllers&quot; one of the expanded entries, likely halfway down will have the word &quot;Enhanced&quot; as part of it.
If you do NOT see the word &quot;enhanced&quot; then you're on USB 1.1 Note, some PCs when they reinstall Windows, win may not reconize your USB 2.0 ports being usb2.
Windows may thnk that they're usb1 despite having usb2 hardware.
U'll need to install USB drivers to clear that up.
Furthermore, when u connect a usb2 device into an actual usb1 port or a usb2 port that thinks it's usb1, u'll get a popup balloon telling u &quot;high speed device plugged into a standard port&quot; or something like that
