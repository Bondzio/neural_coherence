on wireless routers we usually update the firmware.
some automatic updates don't work.
normally we broadcast ssid use wpa security use nothing else.
do not use mac addresses.
since you're not using the wireless part, then turn it off.
check your firewall settings and turn them off.
also turn off any of the filtering devices in the d-link router.
setup should look like wall &gt; cable modem/router &gt; d-link router &gt; wired/wireless i don't know if there's some type of filter in the d-link that will limit usage.
