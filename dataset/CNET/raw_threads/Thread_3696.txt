Although you might give your ESSID name identical to your workgroup name.

I can not change them to my desktop's workgroup. I tried conencting one of my laptops through wired connection and tried to ping to it through the other laptop which is connected through wireless and i am able to connect to either of them without anyproblem. Both the laptops were in different domains but still they were able to conenct to each other. I have file and printer sharing enabled on my desktop. I dont have any antivirus software on my machine. Can this problem be because of some virus attack or something. Thanks Nirmala

One is my husbands work laptop which has his company's domain and i have mine which has my company's domain name. But they are able to connect to each other and i am able to access all the shared folders on my husband's laptop. I tried renaming the workgroup of the desktop to one of the laptop's domain names but with no success. The net switcher that you suggested looks more suitable for wireless networks than for desktop PCs. Correct me if i am wrong. Please let me know if anyone needs more info to solve my problem. Thanks Nirmala
