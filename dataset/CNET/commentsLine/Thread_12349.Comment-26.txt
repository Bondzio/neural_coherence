as a networking consultant, i've used linksys, d-link, and netgear for various network projects, not only wireless.
i like linksy's wireless products, but they lack the features of netgear and d-link and they tend to be a bit pricey.
d-link has a decent user interface and tons of features, but they fail too often and the range is sometimes poor.
right now i'm happy with netgear.
of all the times i've setup and used netgear products i only called tech support once.
unlike d-link and linksys tech support people who do not respect my mcp/network+ along with being a past student of itt tech, the netgear rep (in india) was courteous and realized that i knew what i was talking about.
immediately he directed me to a webpage for a firmware upgrade and i was soon back to business.
right now i'm recommending netgear prodcuts for all my clients, because i need a network that will actually work, and that is easy to manage.
by the way, i'm using a netgear wired router at home with a built in print server.
i'm using a replaced d-link di624 as a wap simply because i got it free.
