earlier tonight it was raining by my house so i turned off my pc after there was a short power outage.
a few minutes ago my dad came over to use and turned it on and it wouldn't work.
the boot screen showed up and it asked me if i wanted to start up the desktop normally or in safe mode.
thinking nothing was wrong, i chose normal and then to my surprise, after the boot screen showed up, the monitor went blank.
i then tried turning it off by pressing the power button, but it wouldn't so i had to unplug the power from the back.
i started it over and started it in safe mode which worked.
i'm going to try reinstalling windows, but before i do that i wanted advice from you guys.
as for system info, i've got a gateway 504gr with winxp home edition with integrated gfx (for those who think it might be my gfx card).
please help!
