hi: i have purchased a webcam (model no &quot;sn9c103&quot; make tevion) in last year.
this webcam was working perfectly fine with windows xp operating system loaded on my old laptop.
i changed my laptop, which has &quot;windows vista&quot; pre-loaded on it.
now i am trying to install this webcam on the new laptop and it is not getting installed.
during installation, i am getting a message &quot;not enough storage is available to complete this operation&quot;.
can anybody help in installing this webcam?
warm regards chandrashekhar s. joshi
