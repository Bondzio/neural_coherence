hi we are looking to get a new pc would anybody be able to advise if we should get hp pavilion all in one ms210 or perhaps dell inspiron one 19 - we need it mainly for sufing the internet, downloading itunes, photos and the odd letter writing.
ideally something basic and not complicated to use - any advice would be much appreciated
