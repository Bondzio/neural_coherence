I also got this monitor, and one of the reasons I went for it over the similar LG monitor is that the Samsung has the 3 video inputs.
If you are looking for an HDTV, you should get an HDTV and not a computer monitor, but having the video inputs seemed useful to me.
If you are looking at this monitor for its video inputs, you should be aware that the component video will only go up to a 480p signal.
A &quot;film mode&quot; is available for interlaced video as well.
The DVI port is HDCP compliant, so it looks like you might be able feed a HDTV signal to this monitor that way, BUT I can't find anywhere in the docs what HDTV resolution might be supported, if any.
I'd guess 720p, but I do not have anything that makes a HDTV signal to test this with.
Anyway, I got this as a computer monitor and am very happy with it.
