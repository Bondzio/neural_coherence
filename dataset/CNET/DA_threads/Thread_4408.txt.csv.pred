1.1.1	Hello, I never had this problem before and I can't find any possible settings that would be causing it.	St
1.1.2	I have a Motorola Surfboard Modem that is connected to my DD-WRT 54G Wireless Router.	St
1.1.3	If I put in my external IP address in the browser while connected to my wireless network, It directs me to the correct Local IP that I have it set to.	St
1.1.4	If I try to access it outside my network it just times out and says &quot;Response Error.	St
1.1.5	Technical Description: 502 Bad Gateway - Response error, a bad response was received from another proxy server or the destination origin server&quot; Any ideas of what I can look for?	St
1.1.6	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	You didn't share what you mean by access so I can't tell if this is a FTP, Telnet or other type of access.	St
1.2.2	Because of problems that occur with &quot;users&quot; many ISPs now block network sharing ports.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thank you for your quick reply.	St
1.3.2	I am connecting for browser access.	St
1.3.3	It is going to my Raspberry Pi that I have running Raspbmc (XBMC).	St
1.3.4	I have tried using different ports because like you said they block access certain ports.	St
1.3.5	I wonder why I am able to connect within my network using my external IP though, that seems strange to me.	St
1.4.1	By browser access I mean I am literally entering my external IP into the browser window.	St
1.5.1	Ok I just changed it to port forward to another web server I have and it will connect to that in the browser outside the network no problem.	St
1.5.2	This leads me to believe it's an issue with the PI and not the network.	St
1.5.3	I will have to do more research.	St
1.5.4	I can connect to the pi by it's internal IP address however so I am not sure why I can't connect by port forwarding.	St
1.6.1	Turns out that by default raspbmc on Rasperry Pi refuses any connection from any port outside the network.	St
1.6.2	Something to do with IP tables.	St
1.6.3	Something I will have to look into another day.	St
1.7.1	I take it that you put the Pi into the DMZ if you have a router?	St
