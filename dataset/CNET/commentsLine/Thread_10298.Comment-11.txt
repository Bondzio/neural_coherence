but i was talking of checking for that stray mounting post.
but this sounds like progress!
&quot; no signal on monitor after changing power supply&quot; to windows at least starting.
as the machine crashes it can corrupt the os.
maybe the next step is to slip in some new blank hdd and install windows on that to see if the machine is ok?
