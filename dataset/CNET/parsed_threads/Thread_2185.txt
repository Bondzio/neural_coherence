<s> I just installed a new 250 GB HD into my Dell Dimension 8250. </s>
<s> BIOS recognizes it and that it has 250 GB, however, I can't boot from the CD-ROM to start to format the drive. </s>
<s> I've changed the boot sequence and still doesn't work. </s>
<s> Don't even hear the CD spn. </s>
<s> Thoughts? </s>
<s> Make sure the HD harnesses and those of the CD as well are properly configued either for master/slave or CS setup. </s>
<s> That bios is setup for &quot;AUTO&quot; or similar mode that the wire harness refects all that. </s>
<s> Verify jumpers on CD & HD are what you need. </s>
<s> Power is firmly seated, etc.. What are your results? </s>

<s> I too am having a problem installing a new hard drive in a Dell Poweredge server, 500SC. </s>
<s> I removed the old drive and installed a new one, both IDE. </s>
<s> However, the new drive shows in bios, however, when the Windows 2000 Server CD gets to the point to reformat the drive a message comes up and says no drives are available. </s>
<s> I did clear the bios configuration so it would see the new drive and since then , not even the old drive will boot up. </s>
<s> any suggestions would be GREATly appreciated! </s>

<s> If that Dell server has a bios area for this, check it. </s>
<s> It seems some Dell servers when in bios, asks if you &quot;repaired the cpu&quot;, check YES and then will check the HDs required to boot-up from. </s>
<s> Maybe, i got this confused but if the HD has been repaired as well(replaced) be sure it look for a bootable path. </s>
<s> Dell sometimes offers encpyrtic lingo and suggests something but its what you need to check into. </s>
<s> Surf, the bios into all areas and verify that. </s>
<s> Dell offers similar and better help at thier support website. </s>
