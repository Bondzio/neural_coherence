this kinda normal for sbc yahoo.
you need to connect with a pc first to setup the account, then logoff hookup the router and configure the router with your account info and then have the router logon to sbc.
also about once every 3 months or so i can seem to get a conection.
so i logon with a pc then logoff and hookup the router again and it's fine.
