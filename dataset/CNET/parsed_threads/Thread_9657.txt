<s> I am working with two computers, a desktop and a laptop. </s>
<s> I have both computers hooked up to a router. </s>
<s> My internet connection on both computers is fine, but I am unable to share files. </s>
<s> (So I know that the physical connection is ok.) I ran the Home Networking Setup Wizard on both computers and everything went ok. Now, when I open Network Places and click on View workgroup computers, I get the following error message. </s>
<s> --------------------------------------------------------------------- Mshome is not accessible. </s>
<s> You might not have permission to use this network resource. </s>
<s> Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. </s>
<s> The list of servers for this workgroup is not currently available. </s>
<s> --------------------------------------------------------------------- I get this same error message on both computers. </s>
<s> What can I do to fix this? </s>
<s> I encountered the same problem and here is what I did to resolve it: Select the files/folders you want to share on your network, right click the folder and select &quot;Sharing and Security.&quot; Then click on the &quot;Sharing&quot; tab and click the option for &quot;Share this folder on the network.&quot; I also selected the option for &quot;Allow network users to change my files&quot; only because I work between my notebook and desktop. </s>
<s> Once that's complete, click &quot;apply.&quot; If you've done this correctly, you will see a hand supporting the folder which indicates you've successfully shared the folder. </s>
<s> Repeat this process for both computers. </s>
<s> http://www.home-network-help.com/file-sharing.html Best of luck! </s>
<s> Shared folders have already been setup, but I went ahead and double checked everything anyway and followed the instructions. </s>
<s> I am still having the same problem. </s>
<s> I get this proablem and think i have tried almost everything!! </s>
<s> Now i've given up :P I can get into my network files thats all i care about :P Other people can try more themselves if they think they can do it! </s>
<s> ***** Oviously they cant!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> I was messing around with my computers and finally found the problem. </s>
<s> My firewall software was not correctly configured to handle file-sharing. </s>
<s> Thanks for all of your advice. </s>
