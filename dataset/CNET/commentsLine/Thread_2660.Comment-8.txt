or  or here  two of these are no longer being updated, everest home and mbm but both still work wonderfully.
i don't know if speedfan is going out either , doesn't seem so.
everest decided only to go with paid versions but the home version still works good for me.
remember a couple of things, your motherboard has to support certain sensing ability, if it doesn't you won't get that particular sensor to show.
also, these programs run off your motherboard sensors and the shown motherboard temps can be + or - depending on how accurate they are.
