with the relativley cheap large volume hard drives around nowadays, its easier to always have an external backup of your external backup.
thats the way i backup, after making my mistakes.. as for the life of a hard drive..they can go at any time...but most will give you many years of service if properly looked after.
like the man said you can never have too much memory...
