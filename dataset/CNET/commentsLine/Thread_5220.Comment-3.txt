i guess i'm somewhat old school.
i use (and am very happy with) a viewsonic graphic series g220fb.
it's a flat screen crt.
quite frankly, i haven't seen a lcd that can match it.
and it costs far less that a lcd the same size and resolution.
ati and nvidia probably are the best out there.
go for their high-end cards.
you didn't say what video cards your mobo supports.
something with 256mb should work fine.
i've heard great things about the new pci express standard.
i'm a freelance photographer and i use the ati 800xpro and believe the pair make a good match.
about the second monitor... i just saw a reasonable 19&quot; lcd for under $200.
go figure.
and life goes on... jack
