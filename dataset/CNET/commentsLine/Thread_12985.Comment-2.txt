no.
it won't.
here's why.
look closely at flash memory specifications and you only have some 100,000 to 1,000,000 erase cycles before they wish you the best of luck.
hard disks exceed that by some million times.
but such is used in high vibration and unfriendly to hard disk applications where the flash wearout factor is a non-issue.
