I have the HP Photosmart 8250 and have the that problem since day one with Vista, so it's not just your model.
After many calls to HP I was told they have no plans on fixing the problem.
My neighbor bought a new HP computer and printer and it wouldn't print two sided, so it appears that HP has totally dropped double sided printing just as Bob said.
