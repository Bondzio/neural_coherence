From the reviews, it all looks great but I have a few questions: 1. Is the display really worth the price tag in terms of picture quality and overall performance? I mean I could get a pretty reasonable LCD Display in this price but still if Apple is the best out there, then its worth it. 2. Do these displays also carry problems such as dead pixels or bright dots (specially) right out of the box? 3. Any other problems related to LCD technology?

It's a problem with LCD production. 1 dead or bright pixel does not constitute a defective monitor for any manufacturer. 3. Not as far as I know. I have two of Apple's LCD displays, both have been running for years with no problems. P
