is this a global problem?
my screen blacked out before the 1 year warrenty, it settled down and was stable until 2 months after the warrenty expired.
now i'm in the hp blackhole alongwith my screen.
hp refuse to show any customer skills- how stupid were we to trust a hp product?
hp claim this is not a common problem and have no evidence of widespread complaints - they have no plans for a product recall - obviously they won't listen, it would cost them too much !
the f1703 is not fit for the purpose intended and not of merchantable quality on a global scale.
im taking it to the press in the uk and would appreciate your support.
we need to show some consumer power and hp need to show they are fit to present themselves as a quality global brand.
