1.1.1	Hi all , I 've got a slightly out of date computer that fell into my hands ( P4 running windows 2000 with an 8-disk RAID array attached - the obsolete controller drivers for the RAID array is probably the most crucial part on that computer ...	St
1.1.2	I ca n't find them anywhere on the web ) that has some important stuff on it for my research lab , it 's just stuff that 's been set aside for a while .	St
1.1.3	After a day or so of moderate exploratory use , I started running some video capture to see if that functionality was still working ( what the system was partly designed for ) and apparently it was too much for the computer .	St
1.1.4	The hard drive shut itself down .	St
1.1.5	A couple of attempts to restart had the hard drive powering on for a while ( long enough to boot windows fully once or twice ) , but within progressively shorter time-spans , the drive cut out ( could hear it whine down ) each time .	St
1.1.6	To be clear , I 'm not talking any clicking or hitching noises from the drive .	St
1.1.7	It just simply powers up for a little while ( hear the disks spin ) and then a little while later you can hear the spinning go back to nill .	St
1.1.8	Obviously my next step was to stop completely before I destroyed it ( if it was n't already ) .	St
1.1.9	I was thinking one possible next step would be to remove the drive from the computer ( remove other possible sources of bad influence ) , put it in an external enclosure ( I only have one ) and clone it to another drive if I can get it to power up again .	St
1.1.10	Problem is , I ca n't put a blank drive in my own desktop , ( a horrible little unmodifiable shiny thing ) and I do n't have another modifiable desktop .	St
1.1.11	I 've read up on procedures for doing a basic clone ( acronis ... ghost ...	St
1.1.12	etc .	St
1.1.13	) , where you have a HD on it 's way out but still functioning , but that is not the case here .	St
1.1.14	It seems to me that I need three hard drives together ; the failing one , a blank one , and one that is fully functional and able to manage the transfer .	St
1.1.15	Assuming I can even get my failing drive to power up in the enclosure , could it be possible for me to buy another enclosure and blank hard drive , and use my desktop to clone from one enclosure out to another ?	Ques
1.1.16	Thanks for any advice you can offer .	Polite
1.2.1	If such a machine landed here I 'd remove the failing raid , pop in a single good drive and install the OS I have a license to .	St
1.2.2	I do n't discuss how to save an OS that we do n't have the CD or license for .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
