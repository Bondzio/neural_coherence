<s> Hi I was wondering if my printer will work if I switched to 64 bit computing. </s>
<s> I am talking about the office. </s>
<s> We have a few printers and the 4-5 PCs can access them as necessary. </s>
<s> Right now we work with 32 bit computers. </s>
<s> If we were to switch, what would I have to do to make the printers work? </s>
<s> Intels processors are said to work seamlessly with 64 and 32 tasks. </s>
<s> Now does that mean that I can install Windows XP or Vista 64 bit editions on my computers while utilizing 32 bit printer drivers? </s>
<s> If this does not work then can I get a print server and connect multiple printers and computers and make 64 bit computers work with the printers? </s>
<s> I will have to check out if 64 bit drivers are available or not. </s>
<s> My questions are for the time when there are no printer drivers available. </s>
<s> Thank You </s>
<s> Unless your staff can write drivers then you need to stay off the 64-bit versions of this OS. </s>
<s> While a print share might be visible on the network, it doesn't mean you can print to it. </s>

<s> Here's what happens when a big change takes place, I've noticed: 1) Wait and see 2) Not supported 3) Will work for x-models 4) You need something more(options) 5) patches, fixes or updates required If none of the above seems to be the answer, guess what, they are. </s>
<s> Alot of time, big changes mean a &quot;break aawy time&quot; for makers/vendors and time to upgrade or update if you want to keep in the loop. </s>
<s> More often than not, unpopular or unique devices get left behind. </s>
<s> However, &quot;the squeaky wheel gets the oil&quot; does apply over time if enough noise is made, but again sometimes not. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I had numerous driver problems after upgrading to win 64. </s>
<s> Printers, webcam, Dazzle 150. after contacting the manufactures and being told no drivers were currently in development I immediatly re-installed win XP home. </s>
<s> New OS's can be great but before up grading confirm your hardware has available 64 bit drivers. </s>
<s> everyone! </s>
<s> So that kind of finalises it. </s>
<s> I will not consider 64 bit processing for the time being. </s>
