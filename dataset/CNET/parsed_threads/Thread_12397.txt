<s> My sound has gone out on my secondary PC. </s>
<s> It is a Gateway about 4 years old using a creative labs soundblaster pci 64v. </s>
<s> It looks like everything is integrated on the motherboard since I see a creative chip on the motherboard and no separate soundcard when I open up the case. </s>
<s> Can I simply install a new soundcard in one of the expansion slots to fix this? </s>
<s> The machine is running Windows 98. </s>
<s> Thanks in advanace to anyone who can/will help. </s>
<s> You can plug in a new card if you have an available pci slot. </s>
<s> You will need to enter the BIOS and disable the onboard audio, change to pci. </s>
<s> I should also mention that you have to install the driver software that comes with your new card. </s>
<s> I do have available slots. </s>
<s> The hardward profile under System in the Control Panel already says this is a PCI card so I should have to change that designation should I? </s>
<s> How do I disable the &quot;onboard audio&quot; as you put it. </s>
<s> Thanks.... </s>
<s> As stated before, you have to enter the setup (post/pre-boot/bios) usually via delete or an F (function key). </s>
<s> In the menus will be an enable/disable onboard sound. </s>
<s> It is probably mapped to PCI, even though it is onboard. </s>
<s> Step 1 will be to disable the device before you power down. </s>
<s> Install a new PCI sound card. </s>
<s> Probably need to move the CDROM sound connector to the new board, from the onboard connector. </s>
<s> Then power-on, enter the setup, disable the onboard sound, save the settings and when the system comes up it will see the new device and ask you to load the drivers (supplied with your new sound card). </s>
<s> Remember to move your external connections to the new card. </s>
<s> If you have a manual for your machine it should show you examples of the bios setup functions. </s>
<s> Thanks very much both of you for the steps to do this. </s>
<s> It seems clear to me now so I'll give it a try. </s>
<s> If you don't care too much about sound, then get a simple soundcard for about $10-$15 online. </s>
<s> CMedia makes good cheap sound cards if you're just looking for some sound. </s>
<s> Search http://www.pricewatch.com for prices on soundcards. </s>
