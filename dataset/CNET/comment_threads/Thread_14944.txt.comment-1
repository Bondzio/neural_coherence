I just bought a Sony RA820 with 200G hard disk, however I found there is only one local drive (C), I tried to create another local drive for data and media storage just in case my operating system fails and I should lose everything.
I checked the support and help areas for creating partition, but both methods in window interface and DOS interface are not working after I followed the instruction.
Where can I get references for this task?
