i was doing that recently on 2 hdds.
hda1 had win98se.
hda2 was linux red hat 9. chose os to boot to at boot up.
hdb had fedora core 1 while i was working out some kinks in it(dialup winmodem).
hard drive b wasn't there unless i used a boot-disk.
then it automatically booted to that os as long as the boot-disk was in.
hopes this helps.
