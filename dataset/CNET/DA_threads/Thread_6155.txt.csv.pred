1.1.1	Just bought a Buffalo WHR-HP-G300N router that is capable of 300 Mpbs.	St
1.1.2	I have an HP DV4-1120us laptop with a built in Broadcom 4322AG 802.11a/b/g/draft-n WiFi Adapter.	St
1.1.3	Got the router set up this morning, set it to the N settings, but my connection speed is still 54 Mpbs.	St
1.1.4	Can anyone advise me on configuring my NIC, or is it a waste of time?	Ques
1.1.5	Should I simply go with an N USB adapter?	St
1.1.6	I'd like to take advantage of the faster router.	St
1.1.7	Thanks, Steve	St
1.2.1	Back in draft n days you learned that higher speeds only worked where the client and the router were from the same maker.	St
1.2.2	The lesson repeats today.	St
1.2.3	But a comment.	St
1.2.4	Since your internet connection is about 10 times slower than 54 megabit, why fix this?	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Well...	St
1.3.2	I guess I got caught up in the numbers.	St
1.3.3	I'm planning on buying a Roku HD (XR) box http://www.roku.com/roku-products to stream Pandora and Netflix wirelessly and just thought if everything was set up to be as fast as possible, I'd have less issues.	St
1.4.1	I have a Lenovo y530 over 802.11g and hulu does fine over 802.11g.	St
1.4.2	I've tried cbs.com and a few others too.	St
1.4.3	But there is one thing.	St
1.4.4	My network is setup exactly like the sticky at the top of this forum.	St
1.4.5	Which is likely why I have so little trouble.	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	Which sticky (exactly)?	St
1.6.1	There are a few.	St
1.6.2	Try the one with the most entries.	St
1.7.1	Hmmm... well, nothing sounds very complicated there...	St
1.7.2	I DO have my new router working fine, connected all external devices with no problems.	St
1.7.3	I just set it up WPA2-PSK (TKIP) at 40Hz.	St
1.7.4	Seems fine, guess I'll find out when I hook up my Roku.	St
1.7.5	Thanks, Steve	St
1.8.1	But the forum sticky leans to WPA.	St
1.8.2	I like WPA2 if only it would work with everything.	St
1.8.3	Bob	St
