Thanx again.
I actually did have Belarc Advisor but that doesn't help now because I can't even get windows to open to access it.
I actually think my Hard Drive is the problem and I committed the ultimate sin-that's right-I didn't back up.
Live and learn.
Hope that's not it.
Any other ideas will be appreciated.
Thanx.
