1.1.1	So I 'm looking to upgrade my RAM in my HP a6157c .	St
1.1.2	I 'm running Vista 32 .	St
1.1.3	I 've learned that means that I ca n't have more than 3 gb ram .	St
1.1.4	Right now I have 2X 1gb PC2 5300 DDR2 RAM and I 'm obsessed with having the best I can possibly have .	St
1.1.5	My question is do I have to buy 2gb more of RAM so that it 's paired up ?	Ques
1.1.6	Meaning , do I have to have 4gb of ram in the computer even though i 'm only using 3gb of it ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks in advance !	St
1.2.1	While you can use the /3GB switch to tell XP or Vista to let applications use more than 2GB RAM the brutal truth is there is so little payback that I 'd not do this .	St
1.2.2	And yes you get to ( in most machines ) buy a pair of 2GB sticks and live with 2.9 to 3.5GB being reported or usable with the Windows you have .	St
1.2.3	I would n't .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	thanks for the input bob ... .so I really wo n't see much of a difference if I upgrade huh ?	Ques
1.4.1	Yes I tried BIOSHOCK on 2GB and it ran fine .	St
1.4.2	I 'm thinking this is one of the piggiest games yet .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	You dont have to buy a 2nd 2gb if youllonly be running 3 , as thats as much as the 32bit OS recognizes .	St
1.5.2	There are windows boot commands I believe as /maxmem you can use to manage ram size , but truthfully you dont need more then 2 gb .	St
1.5.3	Your just bored looking for something to spend money on !	St
1.5.4	Dont get more ram unless your desktop is a workstation , heavy on photoshop or 3d design , in which case youll probably want to upgrade your proc or GPU first .	St
