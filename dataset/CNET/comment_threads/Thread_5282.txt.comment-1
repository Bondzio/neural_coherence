I have a desktop connected to the router via cable and a laptop connected wireless, both connect to Internet without a problem, but there is no way to get any of the computers to see each other.
Desktop runs XP PRO SP2, laptop XP Home SP2, both run Zonealarm, Windows Firewall is disabled in both.
Router was updated to the last Firmware.
Both are defined as Workgroup MSHOME, with different names.
Any help, please?
Raul.
