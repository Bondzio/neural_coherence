<s> Hey all, lately I've noticed a very weird problem on my monitors. </s>
<s> I have random pixels that are strangely coloured all around the screen, things are still visible. </s>
<s> I am fairly sure it isn't dead pixels as my main monitor is very new, and when i play my xbox 360 through it, it doesnt seem to occur, i have uninstalled and reinstalled different video drivers and it has had no affect. </s>
<s> My specs are as follows.. XP SP2 Evga Nvidia 7900gt/ko acer 22'widescreen and if you need any other specs dont mind asking. </s>
<s> since your card is factory OC'd, you might want to dial it back a bit. </s>
<s> use atitool (works with nvidia cards also) to test your video memory and see if its causing the problem: http://www.techpowerup.com/atitool/ </s>
<s> so it would seem that my problem has gotten worse, now my computer is crashing in some instances, it seems to be triggered by gpu usage. </s>
<s> Some videos i open will suddenly stop and the computer freezes, then crashes. </s>
<s> I crashed while running a test in ATItool and it also says i have high amounts of artifacting... is there anything other then buying a new card that i can do or...? </s>
<s> you should definitely dial back your gpu core and memory to stock settings and try it again. </s>
<s> also check you gpu fan to ensure it's spinning properly. </s>
