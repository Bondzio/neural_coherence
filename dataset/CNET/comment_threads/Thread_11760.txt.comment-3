Thanks for the info.
But I can add to a partially completed CD on my other computer if there is sufficient space.
It asks me if I wish to erase on an RW and when I reply &quot;no&quot; it allows adding data or music.
The computer that won't allow adding to a partially filled disk has lots of DVD/CD burning software on it so there may be a conflict somewhere.
