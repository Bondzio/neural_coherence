Seems my query was too complicated and with no simple answers ?
O.K.
What about technical ones ?
To add to the list: half-bridge modem- now what on earth is that ?
And what is a router ?
or a bridge-router ?
or a half-bridge router, if there is such a thing ?
It also seems that a dsl modem can be described as a router, but surely they are not the same ?
Thanks for any enlightenment !
