<s> Ok, so I built a computer a while ago and I just haven't had time to update the BIOS so I'm going to make time and do it. </s>
<s> This is my first time doing this so I'm a tad nervous because I've heard all the story's about people frying their motherboards when they do this. </s>
<s> So there's two ways that you can update the BIOS according to the instruction manual:1. you can use a floppy disc. </s>
<s> 2.you can use a flash drive. </s>
<s> So I guess I have three questions: 1. </s>
<s> How dangerous is it to update your BIOS and is it very hard? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Is it easier to use a floppy disc or a flash drive? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Besides added options to the BIOS(mine is extremely basic) is there a performance boost? </s>
<s> Any help at all would be great on this topic. </s>
<s> Thanks so much. </s>
<s> is don't bother unless the new BIOS addresses a problem you are having or adds a feature you desire. </s>
<s> As for the best way, I prefer bootable media of any type rather that will allow you to make a backup of the old BIOS version first. </s>
<s> Make sure there's no way your PC can power down during a flash or it may be dead. </s>
<s> This means a good working UPS. </s>
<s> As for performance boosts, that depends. </s>
<s> Read what's fixed or added in each revision. </s>
<s> Some might offer support for newer processors that might be faster but, on the whole, overall system speed ups aren't part of the MB sustaining crew's objective. </s>
