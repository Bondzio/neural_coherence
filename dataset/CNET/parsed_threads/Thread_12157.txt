<s> Hi i just installed my new AMD Athlon XP 2600 on an asus a7z8x mother board AMD says i should get 2GHz Yet the system is only showing 1.14GHz how do i fix this? </s>
<s> Thanks, Marc </s>
<s> Have a look in the Bios and try resetting the FSB to 133mhz. </s>
<s> You need to go into the BIOS and check the FSB and clock multiplier settings. </s>
<s> If you set them incorrectly the machine will boot into a failsafe configuration which will give you the lower clock speeds. </s>
