Is now enabled in both machines.
I tried to print from the dell (which does not have a printer hooked up and kept getting message that said &quot;file to print was deleted&quot;?
Is there a way where I can see the other computer...went to my computer and didn't see anything either... maybe I'm looking in all thew wrong places.
Although I feel I'm getting some where.
Thanks
