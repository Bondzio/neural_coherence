My keyboard and mouse are a Belkin wireless keyboard and mouse. My monitors are both Dell My video card is NVidia. My hard drives are Samsung. I have a no-name DVD ROM and a no-name CD drive, my PSU is a Thermaltake Toughpower one. My router is a Netgear. So, I'm all over the place and in fact much of the hardware is 'supplied' with the system I purchased. Yours is such a general question that you are only going to get general answers. Let me say we don't do 'surveys' in these forums so unless you have specific questions there is not much we can do for you. Mark
