<s> Hi, Here is my problem. </s>
<s> After I restarted my computer, it stopped working. </s>
<s> Tried the following things, no sucess: 1- A different monitor. </s>
<s> 2- Changed the VGA/DVI cable.. 3- Different graphics card 4- Different HD 5- Memory sticks 6- Different CPU 7- All cables Can't even see the POST. </s>
<s> Noting on the screen, no beep. </s>
<s> Nothing. </s>
<s> When I turn the computer on, the mouse and keyboard lit up. </s>
<s> Even cleared the CMOS according to Intel's support. </s>
<s> The MoBo is a Intel D945GNT/D945PSN. </s>
<s> I appreciate any help. </s>
<s> Hi guys, It finally worked after I googled this. </s>
<s> Here is the solution for those of you you might have this problem. </s>
<s> ------------------- REMOVE YOUR POWER CORD AND HOLD THE ON BUTTON FOR LIKE 30second TO A MINUTE AND THEN CONNECT IT BACK AND TURN IT ON. </s>
<s> ------------------- At first, I thought it was the MoBo. </s>
<s> When I read this post on a different website, I thought it will never work! </s>
<s> Believe me, it worked!! </s>
<s> I was looking at the monitors light going from red to blue! </s>
<s> Now I have my computer back and running!! </s>
<s> No idea why it worked that way, but hey! </s>
<s> I works! </s>
