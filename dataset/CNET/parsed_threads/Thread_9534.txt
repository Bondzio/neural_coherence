<s> Which is better or is it simply a matter of preference, a wireless usb adpator or an internal wireles card? </s>
<s> I'm thinking of linking my notebook from work to my home wireless notework. </s>
<s> Any opinions. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> The internal cards or what the laptop maker put INSIDE the laptop has fairly nice antennas compared to a PC-Card. </s>

<s> All internal wireless-g or better cards I have tried in notebooks work very well--plus you don't have to worry about losing or breaking the external adapter. </s>
<s> If you are talking PCMCIA VS USB for Wireless? </s>
<s> PCMCIAs Tend to have better performance, and are usually More Expensive... if you haven't Bought a Router/Card yet, I suggest Getting Same Brand name (Even though it won't matter) It will help if you have to call for support. </s>

<s> I was thinking jingram105 was comparing internal wireless cards (like mini-PCI) vs. any external wireless adapter (USB or PC-Card/PCMCIA). </s>
<s> Maybe jingram105 can clarify this. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I did mean how do PCMCIA cards and USB adpators compare. </s>
<s> My fault for not being more clear. </s>
<s> I already have a Motorola Wireless router in the house (model WR850G). </s>
<s> That's about all I know about the router, and I had planned to just buy a 54Mb PCMCIA card at Walmart for about $35.00. </s>
<s> I wonder if I would be better off with the 108Mb card, or if with my router, I should just stick with the 54Mb card. </s>
<s> I don't want to spend a lot of money, especially since I'm putting this in a computer owned by my employer. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>

<s> To achieve the ''up to 108Mbps'' that you have seen advertised on a particular ''enhanced'' wireless-g network adapter, you need to have a router (or wireless access point) that is also ''enhanced.'' </s>
<s> You also need to be in fairly close proximity to the router. </s>
<s> I took a look at the specifications for your router, and it looks to be a standard wireless-g router (up to 54Mbps). </s>
<s> An enhanced wireless-g network adapter will work with the router, but its connection speed will be limited to 54Mbps. </s>
<s> If you had a MIMO router, you would see a range and speed boost with either the standard or enhanced wireless-g adapter. </s>
<s> PCMCIA card = PC Card While ''PCMCIA'' is really the name of the standards organization that governs such card technology, many manufacturers and retailers use that name instead of the more proper ''PC-Card.'' </s>
<s> As for for PC Card vs USB wireless adapter? </s>
<s> I see it as more of a convenience issue. </s>
<s> Using a PC card in a notebook frees the USB 2.0 ports for other uses; however, a USB 2.0 adapter can later be used on a desktop if the need arises. </s>
<s> I have used both kinds. </s>
<s> These days, I just get the inexpensive wireless-g USB 2.0 adapter and have no regrets. </s>
<s> Thanks everyone! </s>

<s> I'm buying a Linksys Wireless router, should i buy a Wireless-G Notebook adapter or should I continue with the built in Adaper. </s>
