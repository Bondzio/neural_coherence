1.1.1	I need to run a computer about 500 feet from a wireless router, the problem I am having is I am using a Linksys wireless router, and the signal is very weak at the ending computer I have tried range boosters, with no help at all I do have a coax cable (from a old network) running from the building with the router in it to the building with the computer in it, but cant find an adaptor to convert from coax to rj45 I also have thought about putting an exterior antenna up, but have never played with them Any ideas would be great Thank you	St
1.2.1	May be the solution if you have straight line-of-sight layout.	Sug
1.2.2	This is because the gain is at the cost of antenna being unidirectional -- so alignment and lack of obstruction is critical.	St
1.2.3	I'd look at e-bay or a large network equipment dealer for dish with correct connector.	St
1.2.4	You need to keep the connecting wires between wireless devices and antennas as short as pos, incidentally.	St
1.3.1	I'm presuming it's 10 base2 and still in good shape.	St
1.3.2	I believe this cable allows something like 185 meters but, if it's old, that might be a stretch.	St
1.3.3	If that's the case, one option might be to find an old NIC with a coax jack.	St
1.3.4	You'd also need a T connector and a terminator, of course.	St
1.3.5	Is that an option?	St
