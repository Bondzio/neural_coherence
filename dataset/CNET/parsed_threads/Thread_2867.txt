<s> I had a Gateway laptop with a 20GB internal drive that contained a good bit of data. </s>
<s> The laptop bit the dust (motherboard issue), so I removed the hard drive from the laptop, and now have it in an external (USB 2) enclosure. </s>
<s> When I jack the old drive into the USB 2 port on my desktop, it recognizes that the drive is attached. </s>
<s> Everything looks good in Device Manager. </s>
<s> As seems to be everyone's problem, it does not show up in My Computer. </s>
<s> The volume is showing as Disk 5 under Disk Management, layout is partition, type is basic, file system is NTFS (same as the root drive), and the status shows Healthy (Active). </s>
<s> It is not assigned a drive letter, and the only activity available to me is to delete the partition. </s>
<s> I am trying to access the drive to recover the data, so I'd like to avoid reformatting (for obvious reasons). </s>
<s> The desktop is a VAOI RB42G running XP with Media Center. </s>
<s> The laptop was running Win2k. </s>
<s> Any insight would be appreciated. </s>
<s> I boot a KNOPPIX (please use google) to see what it thinks. </s>

<s> Thanks, Bob. </s>
<s> I am booting KNOPPIX off of a DVD, and it does in fact see the drive and can access the data. </s>
<s> Forgive me fo not being a Linux user, but I cannot transfer the data between drives. </s>
<s> I believe it because I do not have write privileges. </s>
<s> I've tried changing up permissions, but I do not know the root password. </s>
<s> Are you aware of a default? </s>
<s> Thanks for the help to date. </s>
<s> I hunted down the root password issue on my own and can log in under it, but I still don't seem to have rights to create folders on any drive or transfer the data. </s>
<s> I'm booting off of the DVD burner drive, so that doesn't work as an option either. </s>
<s> Further thoughts? </s>
<s> Thanks, Shawn </s>
<s> An USB memory key, USB hard disk in FAT32 format or USB CDRW drive or go across a network to backup in that situation. </s>
<s> The KNOPPIX confirms the files are still there. </s>
<s> Can I ask if you partitioned it with Partition Magic? </s>
<s> It seems to be a source of this issue. </s>
