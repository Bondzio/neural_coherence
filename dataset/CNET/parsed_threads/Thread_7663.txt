<s> I have had a Dell Inspiron 1300 notebook for almost a year which I primarily use to surf the web and send and receive emails. </s>
<s> A few days ago I purchased Quicken Basic 2007 and installed it on the notebook. </s>
<s> At the end of the day when I close out my Quicken I'm prompted to back up my data. </s>
<s> I haven't backed it up yet but would like to do so. </s>
<s> On an old desktop PC I used floppies to back up my Quicken data. </s>
<s> This Dell notebook doesn't have a floppy drive but I could buy an external floppy drive to use to back up the Quicken data but are there other ways available to back up the data? </s>
<s> Easier; less expensive ways to back up the data? </s>

<s> Nobody is willing to offer me any advice on how best to go about backing up Quicken data or any data on a notebook? </s>
<s> If this isn't the correct forum to post such a question advise which forum is. </s>
<s> I guess I should post this one in the &quot;Computer Newbies&quot; forum. </s>

<s> Go to Quicken 2007 support Enter the following in the Search box: How do I back up my quicken data file? </s>
<s> Thanks for the post. </s>

<s> Hi -searched the forum and found your old question regarding Quicken 2007! </s>
<s> How did you make out with that? </s>
<s> I have XP so needless to say, I have learned the hard way, that simply backing up on a CD like we did in the 'old' days, by selecting A Drive and backing up on a floppy just isn't possible! </s>
<s> According to Microsoft, in order for Quicken to write a back up file directly to the CD-R or CD-RW, the compact disc must first be formatted and support 'packet writing'. </s>
<s> The Windows XP CD recording program does not support packet writing and does not contain a feature to format a recordable CD. </s>
<s> So, I have an external hard drive backing it up but I still long for a way to format the re-writable CD's. </s>
<s> I know some people are using a staging area saving method which, again, is just too complicated. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks, Archer..... </s>
