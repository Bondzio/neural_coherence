i have an old compaq presario 5102us with an amd 1ghz athlon, 200mhz fsb, 384 sdram, 40gb hard drive and it's almost 5 years old.
i recently bought a processor from ebay for it cause the one that it had before fried (fan came loose and was separated from the cpu, causing it to fry).
i've been trying to fix this pc for months, but being in college and working, i don't have a lot of time to try to fix it.
yesterday, i decided to take a look at it, everything came on except for the monitor.
i hooked up my hp a1010n's monitor, an hp vs17 monitor, and it didn't show any image either.
it keeps telling me to &quot;check the video cable&quot;.
i started playing with the cables and connectors, thinking maybe i put them wrong when i put the new processor in a few months ago, but that wasn't doing the trick.
i also found a very small little black piece coming off the mother board, near where the processor sits... i took it out since it was loose anyway.... i also changed the cmos battery like it was suggested to me, but that did not fix the problem.
my question is: is it the video card or the motherboard?
does that little piece be the reason for the motherboard to be bad, or could it be something else wrong with the motherboard?
or is it the video card since the monitor will not come up but it does tell me to &quot;check video cable&quot;?
which ever the problem is, what do i do now?
thanks!
