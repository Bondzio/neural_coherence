<s> hello all, i'm trying to build my first gaming desktop but i dont know much about computer. </s>
<s> I found this bundle online. </s>
<s> Can anyone plz tell me if the price is reasonable? </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.ca/Product/ComboBundleDetails.aspx?ItemList=Combo.591939 any tips or advices to start with would be very appreciated too. </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> Believe you could do as well or better especially on the power supply, HS Fan cooler, etc., If you haven't looked at video cards (GPUs), take a look here... http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-hd-6950-1gb-geforce-gtx-560-ti-gaming-graphics-card,2857.html Hope this helps. </s>

<s> Congratulations on deciding to build your first computer. </s>
<s> It is a very rewarding and educational process that can also save considerable money - a little with the first build and even more later when you upgrade reusing many of the basic components. </s>
<s> I would not recommend that package for gaming: 1. </s>
<s> Has a lot more CPU power than you need for gaming - and note that it includes no graphics card. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> You are paying a premium for mobo that matches CPU - you can save on both to allocate more to GP 3. </s>
<s> The power supply is not one of the models most people recommend and is not rated as highly as others for the same money at the sites that rank them 4. </s>
<s> You can get a better heatsink/fan for less money. </s>
<s> To get a start on picking components, you might consider these links: 1. </s>
<s> For general information and guides on building: http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/288241-31-read-posting-buyer-guides-troubleshooting 2. </s>
<s> A specific list of recommended components at different price levels from list in #1: http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/269162-31-recommended-builds-usage Note that at about one-third way down page you will see two recommended builds for about $1,000 INCLUDING GRAPHICS CARD, that would be better than your choice above (note that neither these builds or the one you selected above include operating syste, monitor, mouse of keyboard so you need to ensure you leave money in budget for these if you need to purchase them) 3. </s>
<s> Tom's Hardware Guide (one of the most respected computer sites on the internet) has a recommended build model that includes the components list and a lot of discussion about the selections http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/build-a-pc-core-i3-overclock-system-builder,2809.html 4. </s>
<s> Great information about selecting and installing graphics cards with lots of links to other resources: http://www.upgradevideocards.com/index.html Note that you can build a respectible gaming rig for about $600 to $800, depending on preferences. </s>
<s> For $1,000 you should get a powerful enthusiast rig. </s>
<s> Thank you very much for your insightful guide. </s>
<s> You made my life much easier and helped me save alot of money. </s>
<s> I really appreciate your help. </s>
<s> I agree with rockyjohns in that you could get a better gaming rig then trying a package from any on-line store. </s>
<s> You first have to decide on which processor will give the best power for the game or games you wish to play. </s>
<s> I have read that an Intel Core I3 Processor will play the most intensive games currently available in conjunction with a good gpu card. </s>
<s> I have found that watching a great number of &quot; building a gaming pc &quot; videos on youtube were very helpful. </s>
<s> Good luck on your build. </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> Most web site have a disclaimer that states the bundled components may not be compatable with each other. </s>
<s> Hey guys, please give me your opinion and advices for this build. </s>

<s> http://www.frostytech.com/articleview.cfm?articleid=2572&page=4 Xigmatek has some excellent units that are worth looking at....esp compared to the CoolerMaster unit you've identified. </s>
<s> Re PSU...much better choice ! </s>
<s> Re Sandy Bridge... </s>
<s> Depends on when you plan to build. </s>
<s> You could get the CPU now but there's no MBs to put them in at the moment...notwithstanding the first MBs to hit the shelves may be repaired or patched MBs vice new builds with the updated chips. </s>
<s> Re ...thermal grease....not a problem....just order some Arctic Silver from Newegg...always good to extra grease ...just in case you need to reinstall it. </s>
<s> re SSDs ... can't help you there. </s>
<s> No firsthand experience with them yet. </s>
