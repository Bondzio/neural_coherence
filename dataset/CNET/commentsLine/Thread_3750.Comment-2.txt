it is bound to happen i suppose.
of all the thousands of computers sold every year around the world by dell, hp/compaq, etc, some of them are bound to have faults.
it is the same with anything that is manufactured.
sometimes they fail.
from my own experience i have now purchased 4 retail computers, from packard bell, hp, and dell, and have had no problems with the machines themselves except old age.
if you are having problems, perhaps we can help?
there's a lot of free advice available on forums like these.
