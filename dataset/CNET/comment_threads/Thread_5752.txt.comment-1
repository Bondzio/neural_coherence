I already have my OS as well as other software programs installed on my Western Digital hdd.
I doubt it's possible because all the software is already installed on my current hdd, but I would like to add another of the exact same Western Digital hard drive in conjunction with my current hard drive to create a RAID 0 or stripped system.
Does anyone know if this is possible, and, if so, how I would go about it?
My second question about a RAID 0 system is if it is possible to backup all its files onto an external hdd?
