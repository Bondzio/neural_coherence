<s> I just installed a home wireless router. </s>
<s> I have 2 laptops. </s>
<s> The IBM T42 is connecting fine. </s>
<s> The Sony VIAO 505 connects automatically, then disconnects in about 2 seconds, then flips on and off every couple of seconds. </s>
<s> This happens even when I bring the laptop right next to the router [ie I do not think it is about signal stregnth]. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Updating the routers firmware fixed it. </s>
<s> Some will think that can't be it... Bob </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I followed the directions at dlink.com Bob </s>
<s> Thank you Jerry </s>
