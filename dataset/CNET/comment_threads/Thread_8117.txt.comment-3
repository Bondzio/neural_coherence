As Bob implied, be sure your motherboard has the latest bios updates.
That chipset has been around for a while and has likely been updated.
Check the mfg.
website for the the latest bios updates.
I recently replaced a board (new out of the box) in an old PIII machine.
I had to update the bios before XP would install.
Best of Luck
