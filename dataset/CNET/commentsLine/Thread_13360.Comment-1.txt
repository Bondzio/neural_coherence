hi, i'm trying to trouble-shoot a desktop computer that won't boot.
it's a gateway 700x.
motherboard is an intel d850mv.
when i turn it on, i get 3 long beeps, and that's it.
no video.
the psu and cpu fans are running, and the hard drive spins too, so there is some power.
according to docs, 3 long beeps mean &quot;memory error&quot;.
however, i assume if the motherboard isn't getting enough power, perhaps the memory is good, but no power is going to it.
might also explain why there's no video.
so, i narrowed the problem down to psu, motherboard, or memory.
the motherboard has a 20-pin atx connector, and i happen to have a multimeter, so i probed each wire while the computer is running.
all of the wires seem to be in acceptable range, except for the blue wire.
i got a reading of -30v.
the specs say the blue wire should be -12v.
for people who regularly test psus, does -30v sound strange?
what components of the motherboard use the -12v line?
