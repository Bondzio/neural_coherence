<s> Windows 7 64-bit HP Desktop 3 GB Ram 290 GB Hard Drive Hello, I'm looking to purchase an internal hard drive for backup purposes only. </s>
<s> Somebody mentioned that it was cheaper to buy a used internal hard drive, adapt an external enclosure, and use it as an external hard drive. </s>
<s> Taking that into consideration, I would only assume that IDE drives are going for a lot cheaper than SATA drives due to age, speed, and technology right?. </s>
<s> Just how big is the difference between IDE, SATA, 7200 rpm, 5400 rpm, for backup purposes only. </s>
<s> Both IDE and SATA are faster than the USB (even USB-3) you use to connect the external to. </s>
<s> So it makes no difference. </s>

<s> an internal hard drive is much faster. </s>
<s> But it's less safe as a backup, because: - you can't store it at another location (to protect against fire, and theft of the PC) - it's much too easy to delete or files from it by accident - there is a risk that viruses or power outage or peaks damage or erase the internal hard disk - it can be infected with malware easier So maybe you want an internal hard disk for a fast backup, done regularly (a few times a week an incremental backup = only new and changed files) and an external one to use less often. </s>
<s> Your backup strategy is totally your choice. </s>

<s> If you buy an ext. </s>
<s> case, get one that *maybe* optional for either EIDE or SATA use. </s>
<s> While it's still connected to the PC via the USB port, it's usually the way to go. </s>
<s> The only other option is use of SATA-e provided you have or install a SATA-e port on your PC. </s>
<s> You then need an ext. </s>
<s> HD case that offers SATA-e as well. </s>
<s> This is faster than plain USB, but generally isn't widely accepted. </s>
<s> Your last option if you care to be more open to it, is an ext. </s>
<s> adapter setup. </s>
<s> These accept various connections and even devices that require those ports. </s>
<s> google ADA-2020 or similar adapters that use USB ports. </s>
<s> Thus, you get your hands on whatever HD is available. </s>
