1.1.1	Hello All .	St
1.1.2	I need to upgrade my HP Pavilion p6210y with one or more hard drives .	St
1.1.3	The Upgrade & Installation manual has some nice phtos of uninstalling/reinstalling the factory drive .	St
1.1.4	The photos show a & quot ; drive cage & quot ; which appears to be big enough for a second drive .	St
1.1.5	However , there is no help on where new hard drives should sit , nor specs on the type/number/size of new hard drives supported .	St
1.1.6	In the p6201y specs in HP 's website , I found the following availability statements for hard drive bays : Drive bays Bay type Quantity 5.25 & quot ; Two ( One available ) 3.5 & quot ; Three ( Two available ) Does anyone know where these available installation points are located ?	Ques
1.1.7	From the factory drive uninstall/install photos , it looks like there is room enough in the drive cage for a second drive .	St
1.1.8	However , I ca n't tell whether the factory drive is 5.25 & quot ; or 3.5 & quot ; .	St
1.1.9	Also , I ca n't find room other than the factory drive cage where 2 additional 3.5 & quot ; drives should be mounted .	St
1.1.10	Any help in understanding drive bay installation would be greatly appreciated .	St
1.1.11	Thanks .	Polite

1.2.3	They both have side mounting screws ; optical drives have fine thread , hard drives have standard thread .	St
