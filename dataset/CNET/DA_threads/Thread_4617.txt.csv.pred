1.1.1	With so many years-old 35 mm slides I want to scan them and create .jpegs using my new Canon PIXMA 610 multi function printer/scanner/copier .	St
1.1.2	Does anyone reading this have any idea whether this is possible ?	Ques
1.1.3	I tried raising the resolution to the maximum of 600 and scanned the slides as color photos .	St
1.1.4	THAT definitely did not work .	St
1.1.5	Thanks in advance to anybody who may have knowledge about this .	St
1.2.1	Some scanners have an adapter for scanning slides and even negatives .	St
1.2.2	They have to capture light passing through and not reflected from an image .	St
1.2.3	They also need software to accommodate this kind of scanning feature .	St
1.2.4	I have used such and my old HP 5470 has a slide/negative adapter .	St
1.2.5	I can tell you that the quality is only so-so but it does work .	St
1.3.1	Yes , I have discovered that my very new Canon PIXMA will NOT acommodate my need ... . ( sigh ) .	St
1.3.2	I am going to take the slides to a professional , who will make prints and also digitize them on a CD , so I can at least be able to manipulate them !	St
1.3.3	Thanks again .	St
