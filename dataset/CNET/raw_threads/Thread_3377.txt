8132	0	303324	2825064	NR	wbblack	8/2/08 10:48 AM	1.21767408E12	Do I need to upgrade video card when I'm upgrading to 64 bit	I'm upgrading to a a AMD Athlon 64 X2 4200+ chip and Asus M3A AMD 770 motherboard. I'm running XP. I bought new Ram, and then I thought I might need to upgrade the video card as well. The video card is about 7 or 8 years old. The paper work says it's a ATI Radeon 64MB DDR AGP. I guess I should upgrade the video card, and I will, but I just want to put everything together to make sure everything works. If I can, I'd rather wait to get the video card.

You treat it like a fresh install which means you backup what you forgot to in the past, collect drivers and then install the 64 bit OS you want. Bob
