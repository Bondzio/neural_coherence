cd and dvd media is a good way to keep backups.
depending on the type of data and whether it is personal or business.
for small amounts of data and less critical data cd and dvd media will work fine.
for more business like situations, tape backups are still the way to back up systems.
with the cost of huge capacity hds now days it is relatively inexpensive to create a raid array of hd that can provide an excellent form of backup and protection.
redundant hd systems work well too.
what you are willing to do and what you are willing to invest in your data will help you determine the backup system you choose.
