hey, thanks heaps for the reply.
i am copying the pictures and music from my computer to my htc (running android 2.2 i think, not positive how to check this i'm a bit of a newb).
the files themselves are not read only but when they are put on the card they become read only as is everytihng else on the card, and i try to change it but they wont stay that way.
i have tried transfering the files onto the card via my phone/usb connection and a usb microsd adapter if that makes any difference.
