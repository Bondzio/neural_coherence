When it comes to gaming, it varys based on the game.. Should the game support multi-core processors, the 4400 would definately be the better, but for older solo core games, you would probably see a minor speed buff in the 4000. To be honest though, compared to todays CPUs, neither of those would be considered gaming level anymore. If you are planning to run newer games on either of those CPUs, you are going to see equally poor performance.

If you're planning on the possibility of overclocking, then that's the CPU that you'd want to get. Build in progress: GA-770-UD3 Mobo AMD 7750 BE CPU Antec 650watt PSU Sapphire HD 3870 Video Card
