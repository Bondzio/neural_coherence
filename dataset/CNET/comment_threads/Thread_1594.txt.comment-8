Yes it is possible, it depends on your MOBO.
If you are getting something like a DELL then you might not have this option.
In your BIOS you will need to find your memory properties.
You need to set it to DDR266 look for memory speed: AUTO or LIMIT or simply DDR400/333/266/200.
As an overclocker, this can come in very handy if you know how to use it.
GOOD LUCK
