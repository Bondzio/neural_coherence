Everything depends on your budget, of course.
An Nvidia FX5700 is ok or an ATI 9600 (better).
If you can stretch for it, that would make a sparkling improvement.
Whatever you go for, try and avoid the XT from Nvidia or the SE from ATI, these are cut down brain damaged versions of the full card (although either would blow a kyro out of the water!).
Just to be awkward, the XT from ATI is the cooking version!!!
good luck
