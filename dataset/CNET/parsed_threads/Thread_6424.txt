<s> I'm running Windows ME and several of my older programs have stopped operating. </s>
<s> I am considering purchasing an external Hard Drive to re-load these programs on so they will be usable. </s>
<s> Will this work? </s>
<s> As it stands programs try to open, but then close again. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> You'd be well off to try to correct problems with your troublesome system before adding more potential problems. </s>
<s> Perhaps the best case would be a good cleanup, AV and pest scan and attempts to reinstall your apps. </s>
<s> At worst (and this may not be a bad choice) backup what you can and completely restore your system. </s>
<s> You can add an external then. </s>
<s> If your USB is 1.1 and not 2, I would not put an external drive on it at all. </s>
<s> The performance of the original USB specifications is pathetic in comparison to USB 2. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply, I probably would be better off to completely restore everything. </s>
<s> I feel like Pest and AV scans got me to the point I now am, by removing certain things I shouldn't have removed! </s>
