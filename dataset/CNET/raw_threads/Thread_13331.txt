2609	0	88433	992872	NR	vbhisey	2/24/05 9:48 AM	1.10923848E12	Multiple monitors	I need to work on graphic apps like CorelDraw and CAD apps like AutoCad, sometimes at the same time. I currently use my tablet PC with another monitor as extended desktop. I want to put together a desktop machine, preferably with an AMD 64 CPU. Which Graphics card will serve my purpose best? Gaming performance is not an issue. (The ATI Radeon Xpress 200 chipset supports 2 monitors, but the only motherboard I could find based on it - MSI 480M2-IL has only a VGA out - weird)

2609	4	88433	999816	994361	vbhisey	2/26/05 9:21 AM	1.10940966E12	Not available here	The ATI FireGL workstation video cards are not available here in India. The NVidia Quadro cards are, but the prices are atrocious (equivalent of $900 or thereabouts). Will the GeForce V 9400 do the trick?
