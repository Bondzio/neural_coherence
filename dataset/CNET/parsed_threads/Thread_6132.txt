<s> As Bob Proffitt said, the P-TOUCH units are a really good way to go. </s>
<s> You can do labels with an all in one or a stand alone printer but I am still in favor of the P-TOUCH they are, in my opinion, easier to use and in the long run more cost effective, especially over an inkjet unit. </s>
<s> How many labels do you plan to print? </s>
<s> This will greatly narrow down your selection. </s>
<s> Further, the s/w yu use can be a great help as it can when using &quot;label sheets&quot; typical of any printer use will enhance where it prints if you say, half of the labels present. </s>
<s> -OR- if you use a rool, again the s/w can replicate the output to your needs. </s>
<s> While a P-type printer will do good, these are not intended for continuous usage but short output. </s>
<s> Gain, you need to suit your needs to the printer is being used for. </s>
<s> Also, using a P-type printer the paper rolls aren't cheap as well for any brand. </s>
