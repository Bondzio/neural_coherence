1.1.1	I need to find a graphics card that is 200.00 $ or less .	St
1.1.2	The card can be AGP or PCI .	St
1.1.3	The card must run Autodesk Inventor 11 perfectly .	St
1.1.4	Autodesk lists all certified graphics cards on their website and I must have one that is 100 % green on the list .	St
1.1.5	The other requirement is that the card must be a killer gaming card .	St
1.1.6	I want to run games like Oblivion and Age of Empires 3 on the maximum settings with all of the shading and smoke and everything .	St
1.1.7	So I ask you ... can it be done ?	Ques
1.1.8	What card should I buy ?	Ques
1.1.9	If you know of one that is more than 200 $ please mention it anyway .	St
1.1.10	Perhaps I can find a used one .	St
1.2.1	$ 200 for a *fast* AGP card is going to be tough .	St
1.2.2	AGP is obsolete , so the fastest video cards use PCI Express and those that are AGP based are more expensive than their PCI Express versions .	St
1.2.3	Consumer nVidia based cards perform very well with CAD packages ( because of their excellent OpenGL implementation ) and are fully compatible with Inventor .	St
1.2.4	The fastest AGP card is a geForce 7800GS and is about $ 290 .	St
1.2.5	The only other option is a geForce 7600GS for about $ 150 but it 's not a 'killer gaming card ' .	St
1.3.1	but $ 600+ have trouble running Obilivion on high settings .	St
1.3.2	I 'm not kidding , once you step outdoors , major lag .	St
1.3.3	Trying to get a card UNDER $ 200 with that kind of performance is impossible .	St
1.3.4	I looked at the compatible cards and none will provide a great gaming performance and with 100 % green .	St
1.3.5	The AI X800 is good , but it has two yellows .	St
1.3.6	The best card you can get is the nVidia 6600 , which will not get you all the highest settings , many of them must be set at medium or low .	St
1.3.7	It does , however , get all greens .	St
1.3.8	~Ibrahim~	St
1.4.1	Autodesk Inventor does not list the 7 series in the compatible list , at all .	St
1.4.2	~Ibrahim~	St
1.5.1	The 7800GS and 7600GS are fully compatible with Inventor .	St
1.5.2	Autodesk Inventor requirements are simply & quot ; 128+ MB DirectX or OpenGL Capable graphics card & quot ; .	St
1.5.3	All geForce 7xxx are fully backward compatible with geForce 6xxx .	St
1.5.4	Video card manufacturers typically do n't spend the money to certify consumer cards for professional CAD use since they sell professional CAD cards based on the same GPUs .	St
1.5.5	The 7600GS is faster than a 6600GT in practically all benchmarks including Oblivion .	St
1.5.6	http : //www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx ? i=2746 & p=6 http : //www.digital-daily.com/video/7600GS/index04.htm Oblivion generally plays better on ATI cards , but ATI only offers an x1600pro in AGP .	St
1.5.7	The x1600pro is slower than the 7600gs even in Oblivion .	St
1.6.1	Sorry , your needs are at the opposite ends of the spectum .	St
1.6.2	Basically , it boils down to these two factors , speed and stability .	St
1.6.3	A gaming card usually promotes speed at any cost and certainly some stability along with it .	St
1.6.4	On the other hand a CAD graphics card wants stability and useability above all else , hey this is business , thus it has to produce .	St
1.6.5	You will notice why AutoDesk offers its list of cards in order to run its s/w to be at the best operational demands and that means stability and & quot ; proven & quot ; output .	St
1.6.6	Pay the extra $ and get what it takes as anything will certainly be compromised if not part of the AutoDesk listing .	St
1.6.7	As for gaming , check those websites that offer hints/tips/clues for waht works best at a certain $ outlay and then pick and choose .	St
1.6.8	While you may find a card suitable for both s/w needs , its a hard cookie to come-up with , you 'll be better off building another system and deciate it solely for either games or CAD .	St
1.6.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.7.1	Autodesk does not test specific cards from manufacturers but instead a representative card of the GPU family with certain driver sets .	St
1.7.2	Also , Autodesk does not test every new card/GPU ; only those submitted for testing .	St
1.7.3	The geForce 4 ( ancient ) with nVidia WHQL drivers passed certification .	St
1.7.4	Both the geForce 6200TC ( ultra low-end ) and 6600 ( low end ) are also certified .	St
1.7.5	Do you really think that a 7600gs/7800gs are going to be inferior or riskier to use than a GeForce2 GTS ?	Ques
1.7.6	I know an architect and a mech engineer who both have Autodesk products ( Autocad 2005/2006 and Inventor ) and run them on their home PCs without complaint .	St
1.7.7	The architect prefers his home PC with a 6800GT to his work setup .	St
1.7.8	The me has a Toshiba laptop with geForce go 6600 graphics and he seems satisfied .	St
1.7.9	( p.s .	St
1.7.10	: with its tv tuner and widescreen , that is one sweet laptop !	St
1.7.11	but i digress ... ) The main issue with Autodesk products running with consumer cards is the OpenGL driver .	St
1.7.12	nVidia supplies a professional OpenGL driver with their Quadro cards *and* provides support for that driver .	St
1.7.13	But nVidia 's consumer OpenGL driver is very good ( much better than ATI 's ) .	St
1.7.14	Their consumer cards are perfect for the home office CAD user who 's balancing work and play and can live with the necessary compromises .	St
1.8.1	If you reread my post , you will notice , I mentioned the & quot ; Autodesk listing & quot ; , no prculiar chipset or type , etc.. AutoDesk is a business s/w that people depend on to make real products .	St
1.8.2	While certainly graphic cards have gotten better , I would n't depend on just any card when the manufacturuer of said s/w implies what is needed and if on the list , great if not , move on .	St
1.8.3	People in business do n't need to play around , they want results .	St
1.8.4	Gamers on the other hand look for special needs of speed and again while graphic cards are better than past , they too are n't all cut out to be great gamer cards .	St
1.8.5	I did n't recommend any card but I did refer what one is getting into .	St
1.8.6	I have n't found too many gamers that are ever for long on any given system that could n't be tweeked some more on this or that was tried .	St
1.8.7	The complete opposite of a CAD system , which from day one has to deliver the goods , thus it needs to be & quot ; stable & quot ; .	St
1.8.8	tsk -- -- -Willy	St
1.9.1	the original poster asks for a single card for both CAD and gaming .	St
1.9.2	since he/she wants to play games , i assume this is not for a dedicated CAD workstation , but a home/dual purpose PC .	St
1.9.3	i also assume the poster knows the compromises between a consumer and pro CAD card .	St
1.9.4	so rather than question their stated goal , i offered suggestions to met that goal .	St
1.9.5	suppose someone says & quot ; i want a really fast car with room for 6 people & quot ; .	St
1.9.6	rather than point out that the fastest sports cards typically have only two seats , i would suggest a cayenne , caddy srx , or infiniti fx-45 .	St
1.9.7	i simply try to give folks what they ask for .	Sug
1.9.8	as for the specific card suggestion , because a gpu/driver combo has n't been tested does n't mean it wo n't pass certification .	St
1.9.9	the point i was making is that even low-end nvidia cards can pass certification so it 's highly likely that a 7600/7800 will pass also .	St
1.9.10	likewise , the experience of folks who use autodesk products for their livelihood further indicates that consumer nvidia based graphics cards are OK ( not perfect , not best , but quite acceptable ) for home use with autodesk products .	St
1.10.1	So - I was originaly asking for a CAD/Gaming card which IS still what I want .	St
1.10.2	I 'm really loving the info so far too and thank you all .	St
1.10.3	What do you think of the Nvidia Quadro4 900 XGS ?	Ques
1.10.4	Would this card play games like Oblivion or AOE3 or could it only do Inventor11 ?	Ques
1.10.5	It is a fully certified Autodesk Inventor card .	St
1.10.6	I also know that Inventor 11 added openGL compatabilty which may open the doors for newer cards ... What do you think ?	Ques
1.10.7	Alternately what if I built a dual card system ?	Ques
1.10.8	I have PCI and AGP open on my Asus motherboard .	St
1.11.1	The Quadro4 900XGL card is circa 2002 and ca n't be expected to handle any games mentioned .	St
1.11.2	The only PCI based Quadro that I can find is a Quadro4 NVS280 but it only has 64MB of RAM and ca n't handle 30+ windows .	St
1.11.3	It too ca n't handle any modern games since it only has 64MB of RAM .	St
1.11.4	3DFuzion made a PCI geforce 6200 and that GPU passes the autodesk certification tests .	St
1.11.5	The 3DFuzion card is drying up and pretty hard to find -- here 's a new one for $ 55 from eBay : http : //cgi.ebay.com/3D-Fuzion-3DFR6200P-Geforce-6200-128MB-PCI-Video-Card_W0QQitemZ300010102958QQihZ020QQcategoryZ40161QQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem The geForce 6200 ca n't handle those games either .	St
1.11.6	But since its PCI , it can coexist with one of the gaming cards that I mentioned earlier .	St
1.11.7	If you combine the PCI 6200 with the AGP 7600GS , you 'll be right at your $ 200 budget .	St
1.12.1	I built some PCs specifically for Autodesk Inventor , requested by a design engineer .	St
1.12.2	He brought me the Inventor software to insure that it would run it..The only card that in my opinion will do the job would be 7900 gt Nvidia Geforce .	St
1.12.3	For the CAD thats not top of the line but it will perform .	St
1.12.4	To be honest I would realy like to know your system better .	St
1.12.5	It all plays an important part .	St
1.12.6	Maybe spend a little more and get PCI Express Motherboard .	St
1.12.7	They recommend a Quadro card with 512MB for Graphics workstations due to the extreme high res and multiple monitors .	Sug
1.12.8	I have Inventor on P4 HT 3200 with 1gig mem and GEforce 7900 GT PCI Express and I rotate complex 3d assemblies , not just single parts and they flow like realtime at 1280 x 1024 .	St
1.12.9	At higher res I dont think that would be the case .	St
1.12.10	The Quadro Cards cost upwards of 2500.00 for the really nice 1 gig model .	St
1.12.11	Some are as much as 6700.oo Just for the video card .	St
1.12.12	But the state that they are Vista ready .	St
1.13.1	which 7900 do I get ?	Ques
1.13.2	The PNY ?	Ques
1.13.3	The Asus ?	Ques
1.13.4	The Nvidia ?	Ques
1.13.5	Is there a difference ?	Ques
1.13.6	Also I read reviews that said the 7900 was n't very good for games and not good for future games .	St
1.13.7	Is that true ?	Ques
1.14.1	Ok ... after much review I think I should buy the GeForce 6800 Ultra .	St
1.14.2	I 'm not sure if this card would be compatible with Inventor but I think it might be .	Res
1.14.3	I would like to find a 6800 Ultra with 512 MB oof RAM but I ca n't find one anywhere .	St
1.14.4	In fact I ca n't find any 6800 Ultras anywhere !	St
1.14.5	Anyone have any idea if this is a good card for Inventor and games and if so where I can get one ?	Ques
1.14.6	?	Ques
