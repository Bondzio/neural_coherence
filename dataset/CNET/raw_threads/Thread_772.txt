I went into devise manager and they both have the yellow exclamation sign. I uninstalled both of them and added them again in add new equipment that didn't work. I removed them and did a restart that didn't help. I took the side off and checked to make sure the ide cable wasn't loose all is well there. I removed the drives and installed a couple I had from a old computer along with a new cable and get the same thing. I changed the jumpers to cs, slave/master and that doesn't do any good. It shows all the drives in bios when I use detect drives and exit command. Any help would be very much appreciated. Thanks Wayne
