1.1.1	I recently bought an eMachines T6410 , and I 'm quite impressed with the power , especially for the price , but I 'm planning on adding a new video card ( http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16814131420 ) , and adding 1 gig of extra RAM .	St
1.1.2	Is the video card compatible ( I 'm pretty sure I have the PCI express x16 slot ) , and what kind of RAM should I look for ?	Ques
1.1.3	Do I have to worry about static-electricity ?	Ques
1.2.1	and people dont follow antistatic discharge basics neways ... i would just suggest grounding urself by touching metal part of the case b4 installin the ram	St
1.3.1	Newegg.com good site for cheap memory .	St
