i'm wanting to build a low-end graphics workstation.
it's sole function will be for digital illustration: 2-d rendering, so i know i don't need all the crazy performance for animation and such... but i also understand certain components are better for graphics programs and the like, but i don't understand enough to make an intelligent purchase.
all i need is a bare bones set-up: case motherboard cpu video card memory power supply i've already got drives, and monitor, etc this isn't supposed to be a dream machine, all i care about is comfortable performance: i want be able to work big, and in multiple layers without freezing-up, that's it.
