if you're gonna play oblivion with your pc, then i say you'll have to get the 6800 card rather than the x1600 pro cuz it's gonna give you better frames, and the 6800 can be overclocked pretty well.
as for your cpu, i think the settings won't be able to go max, maybe some medium, some low, 800 x 600 resolution.
your ram is quite sufficient, although 2 gb.
ram is recommended....
