I got a new one and it works perfectly but I have another set problem, my Dell AIO 962 cannot communicate it appears that the Dell 3300 Wireless Adapter is connected but it cannot connect to the Printer do I have to update the drivers for the printer because my current router is: WNR834Bv2 Version 2.1.13NA or something like that the most recent.
