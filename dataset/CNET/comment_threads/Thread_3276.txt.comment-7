I am trying out an Acer Aspire with 1G RAM & 250G memory.
It is very, very slow; the touchpad is very skittish no matter how I adjust it; and it simple is not powerful enough to have multiple screens open.
I'm extremely disappointed and am returning it (I purchased on a TV shopping channel that gives me that ability to return with no restocking fee).
But, I do like the portability and long battery life.
There is an HP Pavilion DM1Z that has an 11.6&quot; screen, 3G RAM, 320G hard drive, and you can select a Turion dual core processor for about $525.
It only weighs in at 3.25 lbs.
according to specs.
I'm seriously considering this purchase since I would be able to multi-task, not be so frustrated by slowness, and still have portability.
