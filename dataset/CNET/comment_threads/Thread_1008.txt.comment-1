I have just recently installed Windows XP Pro on one of my computers.
I cannot connect to other computers on my network.
I have run the network setup wizard many times, and the computer is on the same workgroup as the others.
Also, I cannot access the internet.
The version of Windows I installed did not include SP 1 or 2.
The network adapter is 3Com Etherlink XL 10/100 PCI For Comple PC Management NIC (3C905C-TX), according to Device Manager.
System Specs: AMD K6-2 300mhz 128mb RAM ATi Rage 128 Pro 4gb HDD w/ Windows 40gb HDD extra storage
