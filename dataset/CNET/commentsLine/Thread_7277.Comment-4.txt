put the cd in the drive and note it's orientation.
close it, wait a second and open it.
if the cd comes out in the same orientation the drive is likely dead.
there isn't much more information needed yet.
it sounds like some repairs are required.
more story would be nice such as that infection you noticed and cleaned off.
