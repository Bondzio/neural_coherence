Hi, I need to controll 2 computers by one set of keyboard and mouse.
I do NOT need a KVM switch.
I need a USB switch that will keep the first KM connection active even when I am connecting to the second computer so that when I connect back to the first it would not give me the &quot;HUD&quot; pop-ups each time.
Any idea what I could use?
Thanks!
