<s> This may be a common problem so hopefully there is some advice out there for me. </s>
<s> I recently bought a Seagate 40gb 2.0 USB external hard drive to use on my laptop for saving audio files. </s>
<s> It says that it is plug and play and does not require anything but XP to find the driver. </s>
<s> My setup is not top notch but will do. </s>
<s> PIII, 512mb ram, and I added a PCMCIA USB 2.0 cardBus to upgrade from the 1.1 in the back of the laptop. </s>
<s> When I first plugged the ext. </s>
<s> drive in I got a &quot;this device is not working properly&quot; meassge but it recognized it. </s>
<s> Then when I went to investigate in the device manager it was there with the yellow exclamation point and said that the drivers weren't installed. </s>
<s> So I updated the drivers but the ones installed were the best for the device. </s>
<s> When I went back a page to the properties it said &quot;this device cannot start - code 10&quot;. </s>
<s> So that WAS/IS(?) </s>
<s> the problem to be solved. </s>
<s> I tried to restart and try again. </s>
<s> The drive won't even be recognized now unless I put it in the slow 1.1 usb and not the 2.0. </s>
<s> I still get the same messages when I look at the properties in the device manager too. </s>
<s> The 2.0 still won't recognize it as it did the first time I plugged it in. </s>
<s> I don't think it's a power problem. </s>
<s> The PCMCIA is powered to 5VDC like it should be and it comes with a power cord to plug it in the 1.1 slot for extra juice if you need it and according to the hard drive I do not. </s>
<s> I also tried plugging it into the wall using another power cord. </s>
<s> No luck. </s>
<s> Also tried it on another computer that only had the 1.1 an it recognized it but same device properties. </s>
<s> Sorry for the manifesto but I'd really like to get this fixed. </s>
<s> Any advice? </s>

<s> It's likely defective. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I installed an updated USB driver for the XP SP one that I have installed and it now recognizes the drive but still have the &quot;code 10&quot;. </s>
<s> If the drive doesn't work in any machine then it's either blank or defective. </s>
<s> So far your story points to defective. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You may be right about it being defective but blank is what I want. </s>
<s> I bought it new. </s>
<s> Maybe it needs formatting but a) I can't access it to do so (even though it comes up as &quot;USB mass storage device&quot;) and b) it's supposed to be plug and play. </s>
<s> I really appreciate your help. </s>
<s> I'll give it a little more tweaking before I return it. </s>

<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> So I can't format it. </s>
<s> I can't get to it. </s>
<s> I will say that I optimized the laptop for audio recording and may have turned something off? </s>
<s> Not sure what (was following a list of things to do). </s>
<s> If there's something that MUST be on and I turned it off to save cpu power, maybe that's it. </s>
