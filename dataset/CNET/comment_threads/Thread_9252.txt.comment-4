Here'w why.
If you mean that driver update button in Windows, that is nothing more than a demo from my experiences.
Better than 1/2 the time it results in degraded operations or failures.
Microsoft does not produce your PC and can't get this one right.
-&gt; Use the drivers from your PC's maker.
Please.
