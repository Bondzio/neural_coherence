There are definitely 2 connections to the server in that diagram.
As to no switched hubs, I can see where newer owners can say that but there is a switched hub in your common multiple Ethernet port router so I'm at a loss as to how to nicely put this.
My apology if I presented it and hurt anyone's feelings.
