<s> My monitor powers up but seems to stay in standby. </s>
<s> I changed the graphics card and it still doesn't bring up my desktop. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any other suggestions. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> The quickest test is to swap the monitor to another system. </s>
<s> If it works then, boot your orginal system into safe mode and reset to basic defaults and save upon exit. </s>
<s> Hopefully, when you boot-up next time and it displays something, reset the system setting as they once were, etc.. </s>
<s> If it fails with the other system, the monitor is bad and usually fixing it isn't cost effective unless its some unique monitor. </s>
<s> If you've recently updated any video drivers, etc. </s>
<s> return to the old ones as a last resort. </s>
<s> This is where I'll start... good luck -----Willy </s>
