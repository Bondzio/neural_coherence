The type and duration of beeps on bootup vary with the type of BIOS you have.
Look in your motherboard manual, as they sometimes give you a translation of what the different type of beeps mean.
Or,take a look at this link, in the big yellow box in the middle, the links may help you.
But you need to know what type of BIOS you have; you can normally see this on bootup when the screen is black, and the text is white.

Do check your motherboard's manual/website first.
Good luck.
