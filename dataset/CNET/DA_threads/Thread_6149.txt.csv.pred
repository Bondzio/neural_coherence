1.3.1	Get a LightScribe DVD/CD burner and discs and print directly to the dics without a printer .	St
1.3.2	Prices have come down and they work great .	St
1.3.3	There are a couple draw backs .	St
1.3.4	It is a pretty slow process , about 15 to 20 mins per disc .	St
1.3.5	Another is Right now there is only one color , but HP is coming out with more colors this spring .	St
1.4.1	well lightscribe is ok but i want to have a more colorful look to the dvd 's to promote their use .	St
1.4.2	.	St
1.4.3	.	St
1.4.4	i have shied away from printing stick-on labels for fear of them making the dvd wobble at hi rpms .	St
1.4.5	.	St
1.4.6	.	St
1.4.7	would that be the way to go ?	Ques
1.5.1	Buy the dvd media with the ready to print surface .	St
1.5.2	While I did run into someone that railed against that ( media costs more ) , this is one solution .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	i took from your previous post that these direct to disk printers were not good .	St
1.6.2	.	St
1.6.3	.	St
1.6.4	did you mean epson in particular ?	Ques
1.6.5	i do n't mind paying the extra dough for the media .	St
1.6.6	-- fj	St
1.7.1	Limited lifespan .	St
1.7.2	Today 's cheap prices come at the price of short lifespans .	St
1.7.3	The units work for a year or two and why you see some complain .	St
1.7.4	The media with ready to print surfaces also have detractors .	St
1.7.5	They want the cheap price they get with bulk media .	St

1.8.6	.	St
1.8.7	i may just get a NIB canon on ebay and get the tray attachment -- any word on how well those canon tray attachments work ?	Ques
1.8.8	or should i just stay simpleand go with epson ?	Ques
1.9.1	Had the CD/DVD printer function with the printer .	St
1.9.2	I ca n't say I 'd go with some & quot ; addon. & quot ; But now that you 've revealed the 50 to 100 quantity I 'll suggest that there are services that may rival the price you 'll pay for printer , media and learning that not all machines or DVD players work with DVD recordable media .	St
