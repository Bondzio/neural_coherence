i lost two hp printers and my diabetes meter.
i didn't really care too much about the printers, but to not be able to interface my meter has been a real pain.
i must now wait to get to my doctor to down load my readings.
would have been nice if the meter company ad upgraded their software to work with vista 64 or microsoft made vista 64 truly xp compatable.
