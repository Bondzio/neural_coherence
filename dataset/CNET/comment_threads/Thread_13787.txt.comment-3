thanks for notifying me about the warranty.
It still has the warranty, as I just purchased it 2 months ago.
But how should I approach the problem then?
I don't want to void the warranty, but I would really like to get a new cover.
How should I remove the screen from the lower half first?
It seems like the screen is connected to the ''thing'' that makes it possible to move the whole screen.
I can't really find any rubber cushions or any other kind of connecting points around the screen.
The spill was situated around the ''F1-F4, 1-4, Q-R''-area.
I would like to remove the whole upper left corner of the keyboard.
