1.2.1	If your OS is XP , then that 's it , 2.2gb limit .	St
1.2.2	There is nothing you can do and even if so , it would be another cost and hassle .	St
1.2.3	Only the newer mtrbds .	St
1.2.4	and Vista and later OS ( 64-bit ) will work as clean as possible .	St
1.2.5	Visit the Seagate support website and review it 's FAQ .	St
