1.2.1	Or much explanation.	St
1.2.2	The newer owners are being tossed into the deep end and just like it has been for decades we save or install our apps on the drive of our choice.	St
1.2.3	There seems to be a thought among newer users this is a design flaw but let's say it is.	St
1.2.4	Why not return it if the retailer and maker won't answer your questions?	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	i will bring it to the store where it came from for an explenation for the drive and the mistakes in the specs	St
1.4.1	Such can be changed and 8GB is a good upgrade.	St
1.4.2	There was a member that was upset the sticker didn't match and we never heard if they were able to get a new sticker.	St

1.5.1	After formatting, your 500GB HDDs it turns into about 465GBs of usable disk space.	St
1.5.2	You might want to check DISK MANAGEMENT to see how the total space is allocated.	St
1.5.3	You've already accounted for 258GBs and 186GBs...that's 444GBs....is there more FREE SPACE or perhaps a hidden recovery partition somewhere?	St
1.5.4	If yes....then you got what was advertised and maybe then some.	St
1.5.5	Recommend you verify the facts before losing more sleep or wasting more time.	St
1.5.6	VAPCMD	St
