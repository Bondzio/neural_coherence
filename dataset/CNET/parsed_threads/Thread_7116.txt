<s> I connected a SATA HDD I got for christmas and it has never worked, the computer simply doesn't find it. </s>
<s> The HDD is a Seagate Barracuda 7200 RPM 200GB S150. </s>
<s> I am using a Asustek S754 K8T800 ATX A L R mobo (which is supposed to be SATA equipped) and my existing HDD is Maxtor DiamondMax Plus9 80GB UDMA133 which works fine. </s>
<s> Running Windows XP, AMD ATHLON 64 3000+, 2gb RAM, GeFrce 5950 GPU. </s>
<s> ATM I'm thinking the problem is in the Hardware but I need a way to determine that exactly otherwise I can;t return it to DABS (if I return it and they determine its not a problem with their hardware I end up paying all the delivery costs and still have an HDD that wont work) Would be grateful for any help </s>
<s> Download and install the SATA/RAID driver from the motherboard mfg website. </s>
<s> You need to have Windows XP (SP1) or later to handle HD larger than 137GB. </s>
<s> Reference: 48bitlba.com If installing Windows XP on that HD, you need to install the SATA/RAID driver by pressing F6 when prompted during the early part of the installation process. </s>
