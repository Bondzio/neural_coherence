I buy the parts, put it together and then sell it. I'm going to post the specifications, and how much I paid for the parts, and I'm wondering how much you would be willing to pay for said computer. 1. AMD Athlon II x3 450 Triple Core CPU 2. 450W Power Supply (Triple Rail) 3. Ultra Mid Tower Chassis 4. Gigabyte 760g mATX Motherboard 5. 500GB 7200RPM SATA HDD 6. AMD Radeon HD 6750 1GB 7. 2x4GB DDR3 1333MHz RAM Dual Channel - Optical Drive - Extra Case Fan This is just an idea. Please don't be too harsh. Instead of telling me about the mistakes and leaving, give me constructive criticism and tell me what I should replace it with. This build will cost around $320, and I would like to sell it for more. Thanks for the help!

It's a little light and no OS so you are unlikely to get a good price above the part costs. The OS alone is worth a bit as a great install with recovery media is worth hundreds on its own. But I have encountered those that build PCs that can't wrap their head around this area. That is, they think nothing of installing Windows but we are solidly into the consumer age. If they machine is not ready to use and can not be recovered without a guru or hundreds at a service counter it's just another clone. Clones are plentiful and cheap. How will you make this unit stand out and not be yet another Ebay clone? Bob

I can't afford to spend $100 on an operating system. I also include all of the warranties that come with the parts. Other than that, I can't imagine doing anything to make it stand out and be more worthy. Do you have any suggestions?

It's not ready to put to work so where's the value added beyond you bolting together parts? -&gt; Let me tip my hand a little. I have friends in this industry and those the didn't exit the desktop marker were deeply hurt later. Bob

Build one......test it.......float it out on the market for 400 bucks. Should not take very long to see if there is any demand. You could not sell that machine to me but I doubt I fit your target audience.
