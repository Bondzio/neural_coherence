<s> For work I'm using a Dell Precision M90 notebook with a NVIDIA Quadro FX 2500m video card, and they just gave me a plug and play Acer V223W 22&quot; LCD monitor to use with it. </s>
<s> In the display settings, the max 16:10 widescreen resolution is 1680x1050, with 1440x900 being the next step down. </s>
<s> When I set the resolution to 1440x900, the display fits on the entire screen and is not distorted, but I want better resolution. </s>
<s> When I switch to 1680x1050, the display fits vertically, but I lose some off the right edge of the monitor (the clock plus 1 tray icon). </s>
<s> When I move the cursor over there, it slides into view, but pushes the left side of the display off the screen (so I can't see the &quot;start&quot; button). </s>
<s> I've messed with the display settings in both the Windows interface and the NVIDIA controls, but I can't get it to fit. </s>
<s> Why would two resolutions with the same aspect ratio (16:10) produce different results? </s>
<s> Is there anything I haven't tried to adjust it? </s>
<s> I'm having the same issue as the original poster. </s>
<s> I'm using a Dell Vostro 1500 laptop running XP Pro with a NVIDiA GeForce 8600M GT graphics card. </s>
<s> Trying to use the Acer V223w monitor for a dual display setup. </s>
<s> Any ideas on what I can try? </s>
<s> I've tweaked every setting I can find, using the monitor's button controls, Windows settings, and the included software, and nothing fixes the issue. </s>
<s> Any help would be *greatly* appreciated! </s>
<s> Turn off laptop monitor if you are going to use external </s>
<s> Since the laptop's running at 1680x1050, which is the native resolution of the auxiliary monitor, there shouldn't be a conflict, right? </s>
<s> And the issue persists whether I am extending the desktop or using only the auxiliary monitor: The full frame of the screen is still partially lost. </s>
<s> just as you want to sync the laptop and Acer. </s>
<s> Premise1: Your laptop has a WSXGA+ (1680x1050) native display. </s>
<s> Not just Windows setting at 1680x1050 but the panel itself has that native res. </s>
<s> Premise2: &quot;using only the auxiliary monitor&quot; - means you toggled the display output to only the Acer so that laptop display is extinguished. </s>
<s> Not just closing the laptop lid. </s>
<s> Premise3: You set the Windows res of laptop at 1680x1050 @ 60 Hz and you set the Windows external res at 1680x1050 @ 60 Hz. </s>
<s> Not different refresh rates. </s>
<s> Premise4: Acer is hooked up to laptop's VGA port directly. </s>
<s> Not thru some KVM. </s>
<s> And you still have the problem? </s>
<s> Premise 1: Correct - my laptop has native 1680x1050 resolution. </s>
<s> Premise 2: Also correct - the laptop is set to display *only* on the Acer - totally blank screen on the laptop's display. </s>
<s> Premise 3: Also correct - Windows res is set to 1680x1050 @60 Hz, external display res also set to those numbers. </s>
<s> Premise 4: Correct. </s>
<s> Acer is hooked up directly to laptop's VGA port. </s>
<s> No intermediary devices. </s>
<s> And yes, I'm still losing about 1/8 of the screen (i.e. </s>
<s> what should be displayed) on the Acer. </s>
<s> Other steps I have taken: 1) Used the Acer's &quot;auto&quot; function to sync with laptop. </s>
<s> Result: Still missing 1/8 of the screen. </s>
<s> 2) Installed and updated monitor management software (Acer Desktop Management) that came with the Acer. </s>
<s> I did not do this initially because I wanted to the use the monitor as a simple plug-n-play. </s>
<s> Result: Still missing 1/8 of the screen. </s>
<s> 3) Manually adjusted the horizontal position of the screen so that it is as far to the right on the display as possible. </s>
<s> Result: gains a small portion of the &quot;missing&quot; part of the screen, but still missing a significant part. </s>
<s> Hope this gives you a better idea of what's going on. </s>
<s> I'll post a photo, if that would help... </s>
<s> I looked at Acer spec and it didn't show VESA DDC or PnP. </s>
<s> One has to assume these stds exist in all modern monitors, but you should verify with Acer. </s>
<s> Ensure nVidia (Dell) drivers are up-to-date. </s>
<s> Lastly, take your laptop to a store and hook up to other monitors of same res. </s>
<s> I took the monitor and my laptop in to the local store where I purchased the monitor, and one of the guys there did say that there had been issues with this particular monitor and some video cards. </s>
<s> Apparently systems with some ATI cards have the same problem that I had. </s>
<s> I just returned the Acer and tested, then purchased, a Viewsonic instead. </s>
<s> Thanks for your input, Samkh. </s>
