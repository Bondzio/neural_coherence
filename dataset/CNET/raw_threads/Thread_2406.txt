1693	0	66044	783912	NR	rph	2/22/05 7:15 PM	1.1090997E12	Remote Server Access using SBC DSL	I have a home and shop LAN using a Netgear WGR614v4 router. (Home and shop are two buildings adjacent to each other and both hardwired and wireless.) There are currently four PC's on the local area network and one is a server for my CCTV setup using Integral Technologies Master Control software and MSSQL as the server and RemoteView client on my laptop. When connected to the LAN everything works fine but when I try to connect remotely over the internet from a different location I can't connect or ping the server. I've set the IP in the server to static using the DNS provided by SBC. The client software is setup with the same server IP address. The router Port Forwarding is setup with the server IP and software manufacture assigned ports. The Port triggering is setup with the same port assignments. The WAN Setup has the DMZ set with the server IP also. The SBC DHCP is PPPoE and dynamically assigns the Interne IP address when power is cycled to the router. My question is if the router is setup correctly (and if anyone knows about Netgear please feel free to jump in) one - do I need a static Internet IP address assigned by SBC, two - is there anything that SBC has to do on their end to make the remote internet connection work and three - does the Internet IP have to be set in the router as well and if so where?

But I can't tell what's wrong since you didn't supply any IP PLAN for me to look over. Since many will not tell such the discussion dies instantly and the poster is left to call in onsite help. Next time, reveal the firewall settings a bit of the IP PLAN and forget port triggers. Just port forward. And again, you didn't tell what ports you forwarded. All you didn't tell... matters. Bob
