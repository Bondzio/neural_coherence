<s> My CD-ROM Drive only reads DVD cd's... </s>
<s> I can't play anything but DVD's... How can I solve this problem... </s>
<s> Please help me... eddyespina9@yahoo.com </s>
<s> But with no mention of any operating system it would be too much for me to supply fixes for Apple, Linux, Windows and the many Windows there are. </s>

<s> First off, allow me to say, you invite spam if you place your full email here and any other forum, so use caution. </s>
<s> Next, check under the system mgr. </s>
<s> and see if any &quot;?&quot; is next to the line item for CD drives. </s>
<s> If yes, check to see if any error # is present. </s>
<s> If yes again, then look-up by googling for what that error # is and what it means. </s>
<s> You can then proceed to fix by googling further for known fixes on such an error #. </s>
<s> Otherwise, since you offered no info on CD make, OS, etc., you pretty leave us in the dark. </s>
