1.1.1	I went to newegg and it seems all the rdram is way more expensive than all the other kinds .	St
1.1.2	Why is that ?	Ques
1.2.1	It 's most expensive because it 's not widely produced and was expensive to begin with .	St
1.3.1	as only a few chipsets support it and it 's actually lesser in performance than DDR PC 1600 in dual channel it 's a rather old technology ( think 2000-2001 )	St
1.4.1	supposed to be the wave of the future but , just like VHS and Beta VCR 's that changed .	St
1.4.2	So , rambus is n't widely produced and is more expensive because of it .	St
