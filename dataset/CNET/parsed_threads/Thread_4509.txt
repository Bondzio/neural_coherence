<s> im in need of a laptop and i will need it for the everyday what not, but i will also be using it for dj'ing which needs speed. </s>
<s> so... should i go for the... Intel Pentium M Processor 730 (1.6GHz, 2MB L2 Cache, 533MHz FSB) or Mobile Intel Pentium 4 Processor 538 (3.20GHz1, 1MB L2 Cache) http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=2342&p=15 according to allot of research, i know its just gaming specs, but u can get an idea that these M cpu's dont suck in speed and even better than some P4's. </s>
<s> but this is one of the reasons of the thread, im confused on this chip. </s>
<s> The 64-bit wave is very much in plain sight now. </s>
<s> The changeover will leave thousands with a bad taste in their mouth as they mumble about paying top dollar for just a 32-bit machine. </s>
<s> I don't suggest the 3.2+ GHz P4 HT models since they are hot desktop replacements with short battery times. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Wnat chip would you suggest? </s>
<s> im in need of speed and battery is not a problem for me. </s>
<s> While at the office we are picking up Athlon 64 R3000 laptops, that may not be enough for you. </s>
<s> Keep shopping if you don't want to complain in just 2 to 3 months over the 64-bit issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I just contacted HP/Compaq support yesterday, and they said they were going to offer a bios update that will enable users with motherboards capable to upgrade to em64t processors to upgrade. </s>
<s> When this comes out, i'll update the processor to 64-bit. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, i doubt compaq/Hp will offer free processors, so you still have to get money out of your own pocket. </s>
<s> But this is better than getting a new machine. </s>
<s> Quoted technician &quot;Yes, sure it will be released in future. </s>
<s> Research is being carried out to check it workability. </s>
<s> I will forward your messages to our Research engineers and do my best to fasten the process.&quot; Roger </s>
<s> basically what that is saying is that if you have a Pentium 4 Sequence 5, they'll give you a Sequence 6 once the BIOS revision is done, but not a new chip in 2006 (as they will probably require new chipsets (intel's new chips (just released) can't run on any of their chipsets, except the 945 and 955) I would wiat i'd wait for the Intel Yonah to be completed (it's a dual core version of the Pentium M with 64-bit extensions) but it's probably not out until around July or later the Sequence 8 chips were just released (Sequence 8, Intel Pentium D 8xx, their dual core) not only would I suggest 64-bit (either AMD64 or EM64T) but i'd also suggest dual cored 64-bit (so you have two EM64T equipped Prescott's, or a pair of AMD64 equipped cores) so that you can run 64-bit applications, AND multi-threaded applications (both of these are going to be a reality soon) </s>
