Hi, my computer is getting old so I'm gonna be getting a new one as a birthday/graduation present.
Well anyways I know a fair amount about computers so I have decided to build my own.
These are some of the parts I wanna use for my comp.
But there is still somethings I have not figured out yet.
CPU AMD Athlon 64-bit 90nm 3800+ CPU with &quot;Venice&quot; core MOBO Asus A8V Deluxe Mobo ATHLON64 S939 K8T800PRO DUAL DDR AGP 5PCI SATA 1394 SOUND 1000LAN Video Card eVGA E-GEFORCE 6600GT 128M DDR3 AGP8X VGA DVI HD OUT VIDEO CARD Memory CORSAIR VALUE SELECT DUAL CHANNEL 1024MB KIT PC3200 DDR CAS2.5 2X512MB That's what I've pickeed out so far, I still need a psu(prolly 450-500W would be good), cooling stuff and a case.
BTW, I'll have about $1200 cdn to spend and I allready have mouse/keyboard and a monitor.
So if any one could comment on the choices and reconmend a psu, case and cooling stuff that would be great.
Also tell me if I forgot something that I will also need (Not cd/dvd/floopy tho).
Incase this matters I will probably get this stuff around the end of may so tell me if something good will be coming out by then, that I should consider getting.
