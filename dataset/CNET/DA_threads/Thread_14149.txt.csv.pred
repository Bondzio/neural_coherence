1.1.1	Recently my 1-year old pc suddenly unable to detect the master SATA Hard Disk Drive .	St
1.1.2	So I have no choice but to revert to my old IDE HDD , and meanwhile I purchased another SATA HDD as a back-up to this IDE HDD .	St
1.1.3	But upon installing this brand new SATA HDD , again my pc BIOS can not detect it .	St
1.1.4	It looks like the problem all the while is concerning the SATA function of my Motherboard rather than the SATA HDD itself .	St
1.1.5	What went wrong ?	Ques
1.2.1	2 .	St
1.2.2	Is the BIOS current ?	Ques
1.2.3	3 .	St
1.2.4	Why are the details not in your post ?	Ques
1.2.5	Hint : make/model/version/revision/pictures/stories , etc .	St

1.3.1	My apologies , here are my system specs : Operating system : Windows XP Professional sp2 Motherboard : MSI 865PE Neo2-P ( 2004 ) BIOS ( as per original , not updated ) Hard disk : Seagate Barracuda 80G SATA ( 2004 ) Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 9 80G SATA ( 2005 ) Quantum Fireball 20G IDE ( 2002 ) I am now running on the IDE HDD because basically it is the only drive detectable by my pc .	St
1.4.1	& quot ; BIOS ( as per original , not updated ) & quot ; I know to update it as I get hardware to sidestep issues like these .	St
1.4.2	There is another possible issue here , but I ca n't tell in your posts .	St
1.4.3	You may have tried to install XP onto a SATA drive without supplying drivers along the way .	St
1.4.4	This rarely works .	St
1.4.5	The motherboard manual should detail what 's needed .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	I did not want to temper with the BIOS as long as the pc can operate , this was fine over a year until recently the SATA HDD was suddenly undetectable .	St
1.5.2	I guess I 'm wrong .	St
1.5.3	Should/must I update the BIOS ?	Ques
1.5.4	I was forced to re-install XP on an older IDE HDD and it is working .	St
1.5.5	But a newly purchsed SATA HDD can not be detected , so I suspect the motherboard 's SATA function is damaged .	St
1.6.1	It 's a lesson I learned a long time ago .	St
1.6.2	You can goto the motherboard maker 's web page and read what was fixed .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	IEEE , Bob recommended a good start .	St
1.7.2	No manufacturer will want to talk to you unless you have up-to-date bios .	St
1.7.3	However , since this failure occurred on two seperate new drives , I suspect you have a motherboard failure .	St
1.7.4	The motherboard should also have more than one SATA port on it .	St
1.7.5	Try moving the cables to a different port ( plugs on the board itself ) and try that .	St
1.7.6	Hopefully you only have a partail failure of your motherboard 's SATA controllers .	St
1.7.7	Let us know OK ?	Ques
1.7.8	regards Jack	St
1.8.1	In my case - a stock HP Media PC M7248N with a MSI MS-7184 AmethystM Micro ATX motherboard .	St
1.8.2	The power in the house went down , so the box took a hard powerhit .	St
1.8.3	After the power came back , the same old SATA root drive that came with the box was undetectable .	St
1.8.4	Looking at it on another box - the disk is fine - that leaves the motherboard .	St
1.8.5	Same situation ... Stock BIOS , No hardware changes - no intervening MSFT updates ... .. box was working - box takes powerhit - box not working .	St
1.8.6	I conclude BIOS has nothing to do with it .	St
1.8.7	I was never totally thrilled with this PC .	St
1.8.8	When I first got the box , minor physical shock would cause the system to hang .	St
1.8.9	I reseated all the memory chips and the problem went away .	St
1.8.10	Maybe I 'll try punching in the disk parameters manually , but BIOS just does n't see it .	St
