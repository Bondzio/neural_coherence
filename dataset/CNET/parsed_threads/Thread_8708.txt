<s> I bought an ASUS EEE 1000 (no h) from craigslist a few days ago. </s>
<s> When I got it only has 7.48 gb on the c: drive and almost all of that is already being used. </s>
<s> I took it to a tech he found a partition under disk management and told me that there is 7 more gigs not being used and created an icon for me under &quot;my computer&quot;. </s>
<s> However moving things over there is not really freeing up much space. </s>
<s> I am running Windows XP. </s>
<s> I have done the disk clean up. </s>
<s> Nothing... Where is all this space being used. </s>
<s> I mean under add/remove programs it's just got the main stuff to run the pc. </s>
<s> No extras at all. </s>
<s> Any advice would help. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Well, we can't look at your machine, so we don't know the answer. </s>
<s> All we can do is tell you how to find out: 1. </s>
<s> Delete all but the latest system restore point from the disk cleanup wizard (advanced). </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Download Treesize Free from http://www.jam-software.com/freeware/ and start analysing the contents. </s>

<s> You would have to tell us (or post a screenprint at some image hosting site) what disk management says exactly. </s>
<s> 7.48 GB on the c:-drive for XP certainly is unworkable and it will become worse with each Windows update. </s>
<s> So either you have to merge partitions or (better) replace the drive. </s>
<s> You can clone the contents of the current c:-drive to it, so you wouldn't have to lose anything. </s>
<s> That your father has the same netbook but with a bigger hard disk only means it's not the same configuration. </s>

<s> How hard would it be to merge the partitions? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Such a merge is not without risk. </s>
<s> In your other discussion GPARTED was noted and I've used that in the past HOWEVER once in a while the OS won't boot and I'll have to boot the XP CD to fix the boot information. </s>
