hi lelia, well, if considering the emachine t6212, you may as well wait for the next big sale.
last week was when to buy the t6212.
the packaged deal for the crt monitor and printer with the emachine t6212 for $550 expired at best buy after this past saturday, april 9th.
they change their sales flyers every sunday.
circuit city also had the same $550 package deal with monitor and printer for $550, but unaware of when it expires...probably last saturday also.
since best buy indicated in last weeks flyer for a upgrade from the 17&quot; crt monitor to a 15&quot; lcd monitor for $80 increase on their emachine t3882 and t3958, perhaps they might consider doing the same on the t6212 for the next sale.
