hey guys, i was wondering, is it possible to put an lcd and crt togther for dual monitor??
if it helps at all, this is my video card: xfx nvidia 5200  mine is the same except it is 128mb instead of 256. i no this most likely isn't possible but just wanted to make sure.
also, would it be possible with a better video card?
