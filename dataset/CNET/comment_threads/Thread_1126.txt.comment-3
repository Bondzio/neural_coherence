I don't have another backup- the Maxtor is an external hard drive to which I manually transferred my documents before I reimaged my laptop.
Normally, the maxtor will automatically offer to transfer documents (One-touch, I believe), but when connected to my laptop it did not offer me that option, so I copied and pasted to the Maxtor.
