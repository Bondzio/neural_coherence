I've been looking at some of these external HD's that can be connected to a network by ethernet. Are these any better than, say, a USB external HD? Are they used only for storage or could I install software there as well?

And USB 2.0 drives seemed 1/2 the speed of IDE drives. The units work but some will not like the speed. Since the units I've used can be mapped to a drive letter, software could be put there but the speed loss would have me switching to dial up. Bob
