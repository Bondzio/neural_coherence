<s> Hi, a few weeks ago both my eMachine desktop and Gateway laptop broke. </s>
<s> I would like to replace both, the laptop with a Thinkpad, and either build the desktop or buy an HP. </s>
<s> This post is going to focus on the desktop. </s>
<s> The PC I would like to build consists of these parts, I really need help deciding on motherboards, that is the most confusing for me. </s>
<s> I dont know if the one I selected would live up to the power of the processor. </s>
<s> MOBO </s>
<s> Well I realized that my motherboard was not compatible with my RAM. </s>
<s> Would this work? </s>
<s> ECS P45T-A LGA 775 Intel P45 ATX Intel Motherboard - Retail? </s>
