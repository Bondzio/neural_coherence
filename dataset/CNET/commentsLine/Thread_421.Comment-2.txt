your model might be newer, and thus, the batteries don't need to be recalibrated, but some do.
this is necessary when the battery has a large charge, but the computer thinks the battery has little or none life left.
an excerpt from hp's manual for that computer: ''to maintain maximum battery capacity and accuracy of the battery gauge, perform this calibration procedure every few months: 1. click start, programs (or all programs), hewlett-packard, notebook, hp battery optimizer.
2. follow the displayed instructions to test and condition your battery.
the process could take 4-6 hours or more per battery.
you can use the computer during the process.
if you interrupt the process, the battery might be left with a low charge.''
also, sometimes this battery recalibration option is found in the system bios menu.
