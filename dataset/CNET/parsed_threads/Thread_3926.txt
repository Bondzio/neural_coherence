<s> I was given an external harddrive which I set up and put pics and files onto and I accessed it a couple of times and then left it for quite awhile. </s>
<s> When I tried to open it again I got no response. </s>
<s> The green light was on but can't find anything on my PC to show me where to open it. </s>
<s> I have Windows XP. </s>
<s> The Harddrive is an LACIE . </s>
<s> Not real savvy with this. </s>
<s> Can someone walk me through what I may be doing wrong as it is a nuisance not being able to access the info on it. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> Now you may know why the ext. </s>
<s> HD was given to you, *if* it had a known history of being iffy. </s>
<s> I suggest because it is a LaCie that too maybe yet another cause or root of problem. </s>
<s> If in fact this is relatively a new ext. </s>
<s> HD, see if warranty can be sued. </s>
<s> Last, don't ever consider an ext. </s>
<s> HD a trusted source to save your data especially *sole source* of precious whatever, it just isn't as trusting as that. </s>

<s> Alas, dismount the drive properly that too can be an issue even done before w/o regard. </s>

<s> I went through a great deal of trouble with a LaCie 1Tb Rikiki drive, but through endless Googling came up with the strangest solution in the world. </s>
<s> Put it in the Freezer for 10 to 20 minutes, and then try to access it again. </s>
<s> My Rikiki started off functioning for only 5 minutes at a time, and pretending that it had lost all its data. </s>
<s> Having dumped the former data through re-formatting, and having loaded new data, it pulled the same trick. </s>
<s> Only about 10% of the drive used, but the drive said it had no data. </s>
<s> I put it in the freezer for 15 minutes, then brought it out and connected it. </s>
<s> It took about 2 minutes to warm up to working temperature, but there was all the data magically recovered , and it worked fine until I tried to Eject it at which point it claimed it was in use. </s>
<s> So I shut down the Computer, disconnected the drive, powered back up, reconnected the drive and it claimed it had lost all the data again. </s>
<s> I didn't go through the Eject procedure which refused again, I just disconnected the drive took it to the Freezer and chilled it again. </s>
<s> It worked just fine. </s>
<s> Note this problem continued to happen, and I continued to apply this same cold cure, and now the drive works like a dream and rarely requires a chill. </s>
<s> I have no clear idea why this works. </s>
<s> It may be that contracting all the parts allows things to operate more freely. </s>
<s> It may be that it changes the viscosity of the lubricant used, or that it causes poor solder connections to contract and form their connections better. </s>
<s> All I can assure you is that in my case it has completely rescued what I had thought was a $100 mistake. </s>
<s> It is now completely full and I'm looking for a new External, but LaCie is off the menu. </s>
<s> I don't trust their quality. </s>
<s> I will be looking for Western Digital or Seagate or some other more mainstream brand. </s>

<s> Use many build it yourself models. </s>
<s> We get a bare drive, some nice looking case and rarely see such troubles. </s>
<s> Most of the time the owner admits to the drop. </s>

<s> thanks zics 511 I will definately try this because I am at my wits end. </s>
<s> Hate it when things don't work the way they should. </s>
<s> How do I access the other forum where this subject is also thrashed out as I would love to read others problems with the hard drives? </s>
