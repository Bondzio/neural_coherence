On starting the computer the fan vibrates hard (up & down grinding tone (as in a bearing going out)) for 2 to 3 minutes. The 875P chip is on a gigabyte GA-81875 with a 478 socket. After the initial warm up time the sound goes away and it runs smooth from then on. Does anyone know where to purchase just a replacement fan? It seems if you want the fan you have to buy the mother board but then it's older so a new board then a new CPU $$$$$. Thanks Craig

The have them for everything else, just not for the 875P chip itself. Thanks, I need to keep digging, any other thoughts? Can the fan even be replaced? Thanks again Craig

In some cases folks are buying and installing better bigger, better heatsinks .. made by Zalman, and using no fans.

I've had to use close enough then use epoxy or other means to replace a few. But the link I supplied sufficed for them all. jameco.com has some fans too, but it will take awhile to dig there. Bob
