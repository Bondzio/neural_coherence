HOWEVER IF YOU ACCEPT ALL RESPONSIBILITY AND RISK I WILL SHARE THE FOLLOWING. I have a hp dv4999t with a Zotac GT240 FANLESS 1GB PCIe video card and on the Watt meter it draws in total under 99 Watts when running Windows. When a game runs it pulls about 120 Watts. This means it might be ok for your machine. But the risk and choice is yours. Bob

I could replace it with new 450 - 650 Watts. Sorry, I forgot to tell my job. I am freelance graphic designer. So working in Photoshop and Illustrator (And dreamweaver for coding) is the main purpose. Gaming is not at all there. Sometime I edit videos (I am using MS Expression Encoder 3 for now). And I like watch movie using my system. I hope these information will help you to suggest me the right one. Thanks, Ram.

Proffitt	10/28/10 8:31 AM	1.28825466E12	There is no &quot;the right one.&quot;	There is however a fine list at: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gts-450-radeon-hd-4850-gpu,2732.html Most of us can get by with the midrange cards. Some have to use the 410 dollar and up cards. Bob
