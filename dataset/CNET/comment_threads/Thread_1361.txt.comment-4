fan connector to the mobo, that voltage is provided by a separate chip [or two] on the mobo.
The voltages are modulated by a variable on/off cycle, thus the voltage readings cannot readily be accurately read by a Digital voltmeter [nor a D'arsonval movement.
Got an Oscilloscope???
The chip probably got zapped.
Get an adapter and run them at 12 Volts from a PS Molex.
