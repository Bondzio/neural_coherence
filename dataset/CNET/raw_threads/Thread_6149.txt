Prices have come down and they work great. There are a couple draw backs. It is a pretty slow process, about 15 to 20 mins per disc. Another is Right now there is only one color, but HP is coming out with more colors this spring.

The units work for a year or two and why you see some complain. The media with ready to print surfaces also have detractors. They want the cheap price they get with bulk media. Bob

I can't say I'd go with some &quot;addon.&quot; But now that you've revealed the 50 to 100 quantity I'll suggest that there are services that may rival the price you'll pay for printer, media and learning that not all machines or DVD players work with DVD recordable media.
