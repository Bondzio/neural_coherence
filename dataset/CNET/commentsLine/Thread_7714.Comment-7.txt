ok so new cpu eh.. woww i aint into computers that much.. well i am but not very technically inclined to that degree.. anyway.. motherboard driver.. yes i am using xp's its kinda difficult to find drivers for xp.. but for the hardware its running on..and i am contemplating the thought that it may be heat issue.. i plugged the card in after the scans you told me to do the house calls and ewido.. and the chip gets realllly warm on the vid card.
i put a ice cube in a plastic bag and placed it on the chip while i start up the pc and the computer runs a little longer b4 it decides to shutdown ...not very long but about 1 minute longer at most
