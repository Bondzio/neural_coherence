1.1.1	I am trying to come up with a linux machine config for data crunching purposes using C. This is my first time in building a machine .	St
1.1.2	I 'd like to know the following : 1 .	St
1.1.3	I dont intend to overclock the processor which is an Intel Core 2 Duo E6550 Conroe 2.33GHz 4M shared L2 Cache LGA 775 Processor .	St
1.1.4	It comes with a heat sink and a fan .	St
1.1.5	Do I still need to buy an additional processor fan for $ 25 ( see http : //www.newegg.com/product/product.asp ? item=N82E16835103016 ) 2 .	St
1.1.6	For the motherboard I am considering Intel BOXDP965LTCK LGA 775 Intel P965 Express ATX ( click on the & quot ; Spec & quot ; tab in http : //www.newegg.com/product/product.asp ? item=N82E16813121035 ) .	Ques
1.1.7	There is a note in the spec section stating & quot ; Only DDR2-800 memory supporting JEDEC approved 1.8V operation with timings of 5-5-5 or 6-6-6 is supported on Intel Desktop Boards based on Intel 965 Express Chipsets. & quot ; Does this mean it will not be compatible with a 1 GB DDR2-800MHz RAM using 2.2V with 4-4-4-12 timing ?	Ques
1.1.8	If not , please specify a motherboard with LGA775 socket/Intel Core 2 Duo support/4MB L2 cache/FSB= & gt ; 1066MHz configuration .	Sug
1.1.9	The other parts of the machine are : 1 .	St
1.1.10	ATX tower 2 .	St
1.1.11	PSU : 550W , and three 12 V rails .	St
1.1.12	Is this an overkill for my config ?	Ques
1.1.13	( http : //www.newegg.com/product/product.asp ? item=N82E16817371002 ) 3 .	Ques
1.1.14	250G SATA hard drive 4 .	St
1.1.15	SATA DVD burner 5 .	St
1.1.16	Additional 1 GB RAM ( cumulative RAM = 2GB ) Apart from the peripheral components ( monitor , keyboard , mouse ) , am I missing anything ?	Ques
1.1.17	( Do n't require video/sound cards ) .	St
1.1.18	The total cost for the machine is roughly $ 700 .	St
1.1.19	Please suggest .	Sug
1.1.20	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	The memory sockets support a range of voltages but let 's knock it down to a few sentences .	St
1.2.2	Many pages note the 1.8v because it 's the latest and greatest but support for the older 2.x volt sticks is still on the board .	St
1.2.3	What this means however is you ca n't mix and match memory sticks .	St
1.2.4	Use the same technology in all sockets unless your motherboard manual states you can mix .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	I 'm using the stock Intel HSF and it seems quite nice .	St
1.4.1	Thanks for the response on HSF and RAM .	St
1.4.2	Since I am not using any video cards , is the PSU ( 550W , three 12 V rails ) an overkill for the configuration ?	Ques
1.4.3	If yes , is there a way to determine the minimum power supply required to support the machine ?	Ques
1.4.4	( Assume no external devices attached to the tower except keyboard , mouse )	St
