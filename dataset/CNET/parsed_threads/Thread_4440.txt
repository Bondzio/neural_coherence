<s> I am a victim of sporadic system instability, ranging from blue screens, to desktop hangs to file system/Windows corruption. </s>
<s> I'll fix one thing, and everything will be fine for weeks to months, and then some other problem arises. </s>
<s> I think it's something to do with the IDE bus, because sometimes an IDE device won't be detected during boot, or POST won't get beyond &quot;Detecting IDE devices&quot;. </s>
<s> I've run diagnostics on memory and disk drives, replaced a disc drive (I try to run 2 Western digital 200 GB Caviar drives and a Seagate 200GB Barracuda) and upgraded BIOS on everything I could), just installed a new MoBo (Asus A8N5X), went to an ATX case with 3 fans, and just today I got a blue screen &quot;a process or thread crucial to system operation has unexpectedly exited&quot; when I tried to add the WD drive to a simplified Seagate/HP 840i DVD writer ide chain. </s>
<s> I'm plunking down big $$ to get an Antec 550W powersupply today. </s>
<s> Has anyone ever heard of a defective IDE device ruining another IDE device? </s>
<s> Am I asking for trouble with 4 IDE devices in my box? </s>
<s> - if so, will replacing one IDE drive with a SATA relieve the strain? </s>
<s> You never gave a good description of the machine but people who max out drives and such do have these issues. </s>
<s> Then again you could have the wrong IDE cable. </s>

<s> Currently I have a 420W power supply. </s>
<s> Windows XP Pro, 2GB of Crucial memory. </s>
<s> I've been swapping cables in and out. </s>
<s> Some times it seems to fix the problems, but it never &quot;stays fixed&quot;. </s>
<s> My last hope is a new 550W ps. </s>
<s> There's no description of the machine, the drives, drive age, details about the OS install etc... </s>
<s> I had this one owner that was a P2P user. </s>
<s> They lost it all weekly for about a year until we figured that out. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It's definitely a mongrel machine, upgraded on a component by component basis as desired/required. </s>
<s> The Western Digital WD2000JB drives are one year old, and two years old respectively. </s>
<s> Today it's a fresh XP PRo install, with all Microsoft updates applied. </s>
<s> AMD A64 X2 4400+ processor and a eVGA GeForce 6200 video card. </s>
<s> Weekly, huh? </s>
<s> I guess I should consider myself lucky.. </s>
<s> About motherboard drivers. </s>
<s> Version please. </s>
<s> The computer in question is in detention in my closet until the new power supply arrives, I'll have to get back to you on that. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help thus far, though. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help thus far, Bob. </s>
<s> But since I swapped in the new power supply, things have been running as smooth as a gravy sandwich. </s>
<s> But, if it follows the pattern, things will go belly up in a month or two... </s>
<s> The good news is, I can't think of anything else to replace! </s>
<s> Thanks again for your prompt responses! </s>
<s> As power supplies age they can't deliver as many Watts. </s>
<s> So when I replace a supply I add more Watts. </s>
<s> I almost bet you'll be fine for awhile. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Too large a load on the PSU often creates a variety of symptoms ...erratic drives, spontaneous reboots, etc,. </s>
<s> etc., Shame you didn't ask earlier before you replaced all the other stuff. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Sobering information. </s>
<s> Still, I hope my new 520W unit will be error-free for its 6-year warranty period. </s>
<s> Further reason to hold off on getting that USB coffee cup warmer I read about.. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
