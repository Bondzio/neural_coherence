But are they of any help at all if I'm still using 32-bit applications on a 32-bit OS? And is there any point at all to go into 64-bit if I'm using less than 4GB of RAM?

It's a general argument that I've heard from various sources that 64-bit won't become mainstream in quite some more years to come. If that's the case wouldn't it be more sensible to go down a grade and get a 32-bit CPU instead of a 64-bit?

Essentially you get EM64T for free. But the real payoffs for many is the video card (games.) I have to stick with generic answers since we are not talking specifics here. Specifics? MySQL gets a speed boost from 64 bit. Games in general get nothing but by curbing the cost of the usual 64-bit OS and putting that into our video card we gain FPS. Bob
