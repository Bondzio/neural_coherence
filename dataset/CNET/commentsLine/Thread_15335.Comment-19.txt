$150 more for a pc w/o junk?
michael dell once said he would consider leaving junk out if he could sell a pc for $150 more.
but he can't control what hp and others will do.
so, just growl and bear it...or you could spend the $150 on another copy of windows and install over the oem's image.
oh, did i mention that business version desktops and laptops come with fewer junk?
sometimes they are even competitively priced compared to consumer versions.
