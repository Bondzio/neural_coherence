I'm having a Samsung Galaxy Note II, more commonly knows as the 'Phablet&quot;. Initially I was happy that I needn't invest in a tablet as this is combination of both the interfaces. Well, later I was really fascinated by the Windows 8 Pro Tablet that had come up in the market, and I had wished I had one. So basically my question is like, will buying a Windows 8 Pro Tablet render my 'Phablet' useless? Or is there anyone out there, who inspite of having a Phablet owns Tablet? Please provide me with some details! Thank you very much for the help in advance!

If so, you can buy a $15 adapter for the laptop and copy stuff back and forth. I have an LG smart phone that works like that, although I've never had any other brand. I do have an Android based Kindle Fire which I can connect to my laptop via a micro USB cable, and it works just fine as well. ` Good luck.

What are your needs? You didn't tell. How about the new Asus Fonepad? That's a 7&quot; tablet (like the Nexus 7 or the iPad mini) that doubles as a phone. Maybe that's what you were looking for but didn't know it existed. Kees

So will the Acer Windows 8 Pro Tablet supplement my Galaxy Note II? I....... 1. Make Presentations. (ppt) 2. Create Java Programs and Applications. 3. Read articles of or pertaining to technology. 4. REQUIRE PORTABILITY. 5. Use a lot of the camera at the class to capture stuff on the board. (that's where the &quot;Phablet&quot; helps me) 6. Do a lot of social networking like: WhatsApp, Facebook, Viber etc. 7. Use a lot of the internet for browsing and study purposes. 8. Am a music freak on the go. 9. Watch HD Videos. 10. Play light games. 11. Require a lot of typing. (Presentations and Programming......) That's much of my use, though there are more. Anyways, now can you tell me?

Just what is a phablet anyway? It's an attempt to give you the utility of a smartphone and a tablet in one device. Let's put it another way. Your &quot;phablet&quot; is just a very big smartphone, at 5.5&quot;, a lot bigger than the typical smartphone (say, a Galaxy S4). But, it's still smaller than a 7&quot; tablet and a lot smaller than a 10&quot;+ tablet. Just as your Galaxy Note might be easier to navigate and view because of its larger screen, getting a full size tablet will also improve your experience over what you have in the same way for the same reason. But, there's an obvious cost. The larger full-size tablet, is just that, larger. You're not going to carry around a 10.1&quot; or 11.6&quot; or 12.5&quot; Windows 8 Pro Tablet as your phone. Even a 7&quot; tablet is really pushing the envelope. Now, only you know for sure what's useful for you, but I'll try to answer your basic questions plus a few more. Will a Windows 8 Pro Tablet be useful for you in a way that your Note isn't? Probably yes. You already said you wished you had one. Will a Windows 8 Pro Tablet replace your Note? I seriously doubt it (unless you plan on carrying it in a backpack with a bluetooth hands-free perpetually in your ear). You're not going to carry your tablet everywhere, and your Note still offers you convenience that a smaller smartphone doesn't have. Will your Windows 8 Pro Tablet replace your laptop? Again, probably not. Even the best and biggest ones fall a little short of the typical laptop or ultrabook. Everyone is different. For some, the Note is too big for a phone and too small for a tablet. For others, it's the perfect compromise. I imagine you'll probably use the Note the way you're using it now. You'd likely use the tablet when the Note falls short, when you want a better movie viewing experience or easier data input, but still want extreme portability. Last, you'll use your laptop when you really need the best performance and the convenience of more ergonomic data entry and viewing. You didn't mention it, but you'd also probably use a desktop or at least a docking station if you spend any serious amount of time in front of your computer and don't want to end up with some sort of repetitive stress disorder. Personally, I use a cell phone, a 7&quot; android tablet (which still fits in my pocket, but would never suit me as a phone), and a desktop PC (I do too much work at my computer to tolerate using a laptop, but I do have one for times when I need to do serious work on the road). Good luck with whatever you decide. Remember, there are no wrong answers here. There are many, many choices. Pick what works best for you.

Thanks a ton for getting me understood about the whole thing! Good day! I vote this to be the 'best' answer.
