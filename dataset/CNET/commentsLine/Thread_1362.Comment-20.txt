i downloaded &quot;speed fan&quot; - [free] after article about it in pc world.
it determined that i have three fans and the program reads the speed of each fan and the temperature, i assume, in each fan area.
i conferred with hp who confirmed that i do have three fans and that the operating temperature should be 90deg.c.
the program allows you to change fan speed and re-set the operating temperature range.
i did both of those things - reducing 100% power to the fans to reduce the noise and reset the temperatures per hb's notice.
they now will come on and run when the upper temperature limits are reached - this is rare - and all seems well.
