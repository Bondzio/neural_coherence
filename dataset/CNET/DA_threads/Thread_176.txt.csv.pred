1.1.1	I 'm getting ready to start a new build in a few weeks and need opinions on which processor is right for me .	St
1.1.2	Like the thousands of other threads across the internet I 'm deciding between the E8400 and the Q6600 but also looked at the E8200 and E7200 .	St
1.1.3	I ruled the E8200 out right away since for only $ 10= $ 15 I can get the E8400 .	St
1.1.4	I do n't game very much now since my current system is over 5 years but would n't mind gaming once I build my new system .	St
1.1.5	Besides doing some gaming I use Photoshop CS3 quite a bit for photos and graphic work , The GIMP , occasionally Dreamweaver when I need to update my site , web surfing and listening to music .	St
1.1.6	I watch movies too and would like to able to play back HD content ( 720P and 1080P ) .	St
1.1.7	Which processor would fit my needs ?	Ques
1.1.8	I plan on keeping this computer for at least 3-4 years maybe longer .	St
1.1.9	I 'll update the GPU every year or so .	St
1.1.10	Although the quad core is n't really being utilized right now it seems to be the most & quot ; future-proof & quot ; .	St
1.1.11	I understand the logic behind this but in 3-4 years wo n't the Q6600 be a little under-powered , even at 3Ghz+ , to really matter ?	Ques
1.1.12	The E8400 is faster now but is still only dual core .	St
1.1.13	Any advice on the parts I selected is much appreciated .	Polite
1.1.14	ASUS P5E-VM HDMI 8800GT , not sure which one yet G.Skill DDR2 800 2x2GB Seagate 7200.11 500GB HDD Thermaltake 500W PSU Cooler Master case , either the Centurion 5 or the CM-690	St
1.2.1	http : //www.xbitlabs.com/articles/cpu/display/core2quad-q9300_8.html # sect1	St
1.3.1	I was going to recommend the q9600 .	St
1.3.2	It 's the latest quad on the market and the same price as the q6600 ( a little more , but worth it ) .	St
1.3.3	When talking about overall design , the quads are the future .	St
1.3.4	Without getting to complicated , programs and executions can be assigned to operate on individual & quot ; cores & quot ; .	St
1.3.5	The quad cores will be optimized to move massive amounts of calculations by doing this .	St
1.3.6	Besides the awesome numbers and benchmarking these things produce , they are the best overclocking processors on the market .	St
1.3.7	I personally have seen a q6600 @ 2.4Ghz get to 3.8Ghz without breaking a sweat .	St
1.3.8	They claim the q9600 will go even further .	St
1.3.9	Regardless of application it makes sense to go with the Quad .	St
1.3.10	Duals will lose their appeal shortly .	St
1.3.11	Hope this helps and you are successful in your build .	St
1.4.1	Sorry it 's Intel Q9300 .	St
1.4.2	The 9800 must refer to the Nvida 9800 series Graphic cards I have been reviewing .	St
1.4.3	Sorry for the mistake !	St
