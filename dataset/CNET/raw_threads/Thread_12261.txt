The network has a WPA encryption.I am not able to discover the network on any of my devices,though i am able to connect manually by typing the network name and password.how can i get around this issue? Also another one, I am gonna switch all my computer at home to Macs and i don't want to buy an airport. I wanna use the same linksys router but it doesn't have setup disc for a mac sadly.I want to set it up(incase) easily using my mac in the future when i don't have a pc. All i know is the ISP name,username and password. And i would like to have the setup smoothly like i do with the setup discs on a pc. Or atleast if there is any other easy way. Thanks you
