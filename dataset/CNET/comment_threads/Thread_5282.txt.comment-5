Hears how to solve the problem: 1) Double Click on the Zonealarm icon on the system tray in the lower right corner of your screen 2)In the zonealarm window, click the Firewall tab on the left hand side 3)Under trusted zone security, ensure that the slider is set to medium 4)Click on the zones tab near the top right hand corner 5) You will see information on your network adapter, what ip address the router assigned the entry type, and the zone 6)Click once on what the zone is listed on for your network card and click trusted.
Then you can share and see both the computers.
By setting the network type to trusted, this will protect your computer from malicious attacks, but allow you to see the computer and share files, printers, etc.
Like you, I have a linksys wrt54g and the firewall included in the router does an excellent job so setting your zonealarm setting to trusted does not compromise your data at all.
Hopefully this will work T. Ward
