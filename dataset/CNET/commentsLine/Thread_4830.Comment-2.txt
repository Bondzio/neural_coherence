it doesn't tell us the nitty-gritty of your system (eg: psu size/wattage, o/s-32 or 64 bit, ram manufacturer, etc.
), so i'm assuming you're using vista 32 bit, form your post of 4 gb (usable 3.8 gb).
from this information; i went to  (looking up your mobo model), and found at least 4 drivers that are not up to date.
chipset driver (2008/1/18) realtek audio driver (2009/10/10) realtek lan driver (2008/1/18) bios version 5001 (2010/4/14) your ati 4000 series catalyst drivers are also out of date:  i don't know where you got the firmware drivers for the dvd/rom, but here is the link for the latest firmware for your optiarc:  some gamers claim that using an independant soundcard improves frame rates, and you don't have to spend a fortune on them:  from my own experience; i used to run with windows xp 32 bit, once i changed to a 64 bit o/s, my frame rates went way up and were stable-no over-clocking needed.
others say that shutting down some of the background services of your o/s will also improve frame rates; this can be done safely using either amd's fusion for gaming  or iobit's game booster  after you have installed the new drivers/ bios, etc.
report back and tell us if anything has changed (better and/ or worse).
