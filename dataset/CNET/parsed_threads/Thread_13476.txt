<s> I know most modern laptop PCs have wireless capabilities so they can access the Internet in any Wi-Fi hotspot. </s>
<s> However, I would like to know how you can access a Wi-Fi hotspot with a desktop PC. </s>
<s> My parents live in an apartment complex that operates a Wi-Fi hotspot. </s>
<s> They only have a desktop PC (and a very old one at that). </s>
<s> My sister can access the Internet with her laptop PC in the apartment. </s>
<s> Is it possible to connect a wireless router via Ethernet to the desktop PC to take advantage of the hotspot? </s>
<s> If so, are there any extra settings or software required to access the hotspot with the desktop PC? </s>
<s> Sorry for being a bit of a newbie in the area of wireless routers but I've always used wired routers, and I don't have a laptop myself. </s>
<s> My only experience with wireless Internet access is with my 3G Samsung BlackJack II smartphone, not desktop PCs. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> is a wireless NIC installed in a PCI slot. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833127080 Or something from any other vendor or computer store. </s>
<s> You will need to make sure that the PCI wireless card has drivers for the operating system of the old computer. </s>
<s> a couple of years ago I was in a similar situation and a Belkin product wouldn't work on a computer with Windows 98 on it, where a Linksys was OK. That may be even more of a problem now. </s>
<s> Another solution would be an ordinary PCI network card, may need an old second hand one? </s>
<s> and a wireless access point that can be setup as a wireless client. </s>
