Ok i found something on the net about installing SATA harddrives on an ASUS mobo and found out that VIA and Promise are both raid controllers and that you should disable the promise controller in bios since it doesn't run as effectively with the mobo's chip set as the VIA does.
However I'm still clueless as to how to make use of my SATA drives...
I still can't access their storage...WTF !!!
Their hard drives right?
Why can't I use them like i use my normal IDE hard drive?
They're listed in the Device manager but not in the &quot;Hard Drive&quot; section of the &quot;My computer&quot; folder...
I'm lost and very frustrated...
