My Lexmark started the same thing.
Programs other than Excel and Word print black fine.
If I highlight the text and choose a color close to black (so close I can't tell the difference) it prints fine.
I just chose one of the black squares one notch up from black.
I still do not know what the problem is I have a new cartridge.
Have you found out what is wrong?
