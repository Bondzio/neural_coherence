1.1.1	I have a razer megalodon gaming headset , but when i switch it to 7.1 mode the sound seems to be 'blurry ' and unclear , without its surrounding effect .	St
1.1.2	when i switch it back to 2.1 mode the music and sounds sound crystal clear .	St
1.1.3	I did set my games to 5.1 or 7.1 output , so idk whats wrong .	St
1.1.4	Megalodon has its own sound card , so does that mean it will totally ignore my original sound card ?	Ques
1.1.5	I have ASUS P5SD2-A mother board and it has 6 channel audio so i 'll assume its integrated sound card can support 5.1 audio anyway ?	Ques
1.1.6	On to the next question , Im interested in getting a logitech G51 5.1 surround system , so as i mentioned above , will my motherboard ( integrated sound card ) support this system ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	bump ...	St
