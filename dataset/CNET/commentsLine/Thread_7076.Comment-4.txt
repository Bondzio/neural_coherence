your cpu is probably not a huge issue but upgrading a graphics card that significantly improves frame rates is tricky.
you have to see what speed your pcie slot runs at?
plus, you have to possibly upgrade power supply to run any significant card upgrade.
as i said, your motherboard maybe somewhat limiting your options if your pcie slot runs at a 2.0 or 1.1 speed.
if its newer it might run at the higher speed.
this makes a big difference on weather a new card can fully improve speeds or is de clocked because of your motherboard.
