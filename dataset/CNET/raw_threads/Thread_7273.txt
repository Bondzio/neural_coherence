Lately, when I have tried to connect to any PC, I get an error message stating that the PC's USB port is experiencing a power surge of some kind and I am not able to get the HDD to start up. I have tried using the USB cord from my printer but I still get the same error message. Can anyone help me with this problem? Thanks

I am not sure if Buffalo drives are sold in the US. Could you point to where I find more info about the long discussion you mentioned or at least about the patch I should be looking for? Thanks

I tried reading throught the posts but most of it was over my head. I am using a Fujitsu FMV-820NUB laptop. I am not sure if a patch or fix exists for that type of PC. Is there any way to for me to patch or fix this problem? Is there any kind of download from Microsoft? If anyone can help me I would be most grateful
