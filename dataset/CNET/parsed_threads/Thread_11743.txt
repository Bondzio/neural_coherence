<s> So I have a few 23 and 30-inch ACD's dotted around my home office, but one 30-incher I just keep having problems with. </s>
<s> What it does is the entire display flickers off and on at random intervals - anything between 5 and less than 1 second. </s>
<s> If I unplug it from the power brick and plug it in again immediately, the problem goes away until the monitor is turned off. </s>
<s> And it doesn't do it all the time. </s>
<s> It did it today, which is the first time in about three weeks. </s>
<s> It's been away twice to Applecare, during which they couldn't see anything wrong. </s>
<s> All devices in my home office are directly plugged in to a socket on APC switched PDU' s which in turn are connected to a redundant APC Symmetra extended-runtime UPS. </s>
<s> Current draw, faulty socket, etc are not issues. </s>
<s> Power brick has been replaced - also tried bricks from other working monitors, to no change. </s>
<s> It struck me that today it was pretty cool in my home office now that I've turned the heating totally off - no timer operation. </s>
<s> And having thought about it, the problem only started happening with noticeable effect in Octoberish if I remember correctly. </s>
<s> I don't really see though how a few degrees can affect operation that much - especially as the monitor is absolutely fine once it has been unplugged from the brick and replugged (literally replugged, not even a seconds' delay), for the rest of the day. </s>
<s> The above is just a hunch though, I don't really have anything. </s>
<s> Anyone else have a more concrete explanation to what's happening? </s>
<s> It's not a display adapter / machine problem as it had the same issue when I had it attached to different Pros at home (with FX5600 or 8800GT) and in the past I was also able to replicate the problem by attaching it to a couple of my PC's (XPS 730H2C w/GTX280, Dell Precision with FX5600's). </s>
