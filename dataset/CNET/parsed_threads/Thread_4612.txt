<s> i am getting a new monitor which is HD ready ,which has inspired me to want to buy a tv tuner for my computer. </s>
<s> i have 512 ram, 200 gb hdd, integrated modem and audio and video card. </s>
<s> it is a cisnet. </s>
<s> i am thinking my price range is within 100(ish) dollars. </s>
<s> any suggestions on which to get or the best type of tuner(usb or internal) to get. </s>
<s> While I'd stick with ATI or Hauppauge due to consistently good experiences that HDTV expectation may be dashed for many reasons I won't dive into. </s>
<s> But the most common one is HD capture. </s>

<s> the dvico fusion ($99) is a good HD card with true HD capture: http://www.cyberestore.com/dvico-m-25.html?ad=Dvico if you have window xp media center edition, the averTVHD MCE ($79) is compatible. </s>
<s> this one is a white box (no software) and only records at 480p widescreen (not true HD): http://www.buy.com/retail/product.asp?sku=10406587&loc=101&sp=1 </s>
