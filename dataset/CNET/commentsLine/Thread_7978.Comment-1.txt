hi all i have this issue with my pc where it is connected to the internet.
i can ping ip addresses and that works in my browser.
however the real issue is when i type the name of a website e.g.
that is where the browsers (pural) fail.
i have tried all of them to no avail, which makes me think this could be registry or the tcp/ip settings are messed up.
either way i have no idea what to do about this and help would be greatly appreciated.
*just to clarify the browser will show the website when i enter the ip address, it is when i type the actual name that it doesn't work
