when i insert some discs into my optical drive, they don't show up in finder, and won't play in dvd player.
i looked in my disc utilities, and it sees the dvd there.
i can play the dvd in vlc player, but i can't access it in other programs.
the same problem is happening with some data dvds i've burned, however, some still work.
any clue what's going on?
