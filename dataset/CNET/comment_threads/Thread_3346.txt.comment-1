I finally have a network.
When I clik on &quot;View Workgroup Computers&quot; I see the computer I am networked to.
When I clik on the computer though, I get an error message: This computer is not accessible.
Please contact the server administrator to see if you have permission to access this computer.
I set absolutely ZERO security.
Could it be those pesky firewalls?
