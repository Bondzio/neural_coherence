<s> Hello, I have an Asustek p4b motherboard, which has 3 slots for memory. </s>
<s> I have 2 sticks of 512 in there and I am trying to add a third stick of 512. </s>
<s> I can put in any of the 2 sticks, into any of the 3 slots (conclusion all the memory is fine and the 3 slots are fine also). </s>
<s> BUT whenever I put in all 3 sticks of memory Windows XP will not start up. </s>
<s> It keeps trying to start up over and over again. </s>
<s> I cannot even get it to start up in safe mode. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what might be the problem? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> You tried it with just the one new stick. </s>
<s> But there are boards that do that. </s>
<s> You have little choice but to replace ram or the motherboard. </s>

<s> have been many MBs that simply won't function when all DIMM slots are used/populated even if the RAM is 100% compatible with the MB. </s>

<s> Hi All, Thanks for your replies. </s>
<s> I finally figured out what the problem is. </s>
<s> It seems that the P4B motherboard cannot take 3 double-sided memory sticks! </s>
