are graphics cards used for anything other than games?
i mean, if i go for the one with the lower end graphics card, is it going to affect anything like movies/internet ect..?
appreciate the help.
oh also, each post window seems to get smaller and smaller, if a thread gets enough replys, do the last posts in the thread become unreadable?
