1.1.1	I should connect apartment 2 network to ap1 network and provide it with internet .	St
1.1.2	Equipment is as on drawing , wep is disabled , ap router from ap1 and ap client from ap2 are properly connected via channel 13 , 54mbps .	St
1.1.3	Signal is 70db .	St
1.1.4	Problem is that computers from ap2 can not ping anything beyond 192.168.1.131 .	St
1.1.5	Where did I do wrong ?	Ques
1.1.6	How should be DHCP config ?	Ques

1.2.1	It looks like you 've bridged from one network to another .	St
1.2.2	I ca n't think of a reason for a second router .	St
1.2.3	The one in apt # 1 should be able to provide DHCP addresses to PCs in both locations .	St
1.3.1	I dont quite understand you , wireless router 192.168.1.1 is now DHCP enabled , rest of them are dhcp disabled .	St
1.3.2	Basic problem is that I san not acess 192.168.1.130 from ap # 2 computers , and 192.168.1.131 from ap # 1 computers .	St
1.3.3	Not even with ping .	St
1.3.4	Both APs are TP-link tl-wr543g with latest firmware , one set in router mode , another in client mode , connected properly , dhcp disabled on both .	St
1.4.1	Those should be from the DHCP pool dispensed from the router that does DHCP for the entire complex .	St
1.4.2	Also there can be issues with what you used for GATEWAY entries all around .	St
1.4.3	I do n't see the NETMASK , GATEWAY and more in the diagram .	St
1.4.4	I am guessing this is new ground for you .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	I do n't know those brands/models but what I 've done is use two APs in bridge mode .	St
1.5.2	As I recall , I needed to enter their MAC addresses from each to the other .	St
1.5.3	In bridge mode , however , clients can not connect so you 'd need another AP to broadcast the signal .	St
1.5.4	My I 've only needed to do this once and the remote bridge went to a switch and the that end of the network was wired .	St
1.5.5	In any event ... and from the drawing ... you 're connecting two network legs via a wireless bridge so I 'm presuming that copper is not an option .	St
1.6.1	Here is screenshot from ap-s web interface , I can enter several AP-s mac adresses to bridge , howewer on the other side ( client ) there is only connecting without entering mac-s [ URL=http : //imageshack.us/photo/my-images/696/bridgea.jpg/ ] [ IMG ] http : //img696.imageshack.us/img696/1763/bridgea.jpg [ /IMG ] [ /URL ] Uploaded with [ URL=http : //imageshack.us ] ImageShack.us [ /URL ] I presume problem here lies in settings of one of theese routers , or both .	St
1.7.1	Hi Bob , this is not really new ground for me , I have some experience on it .	St
1.7.2	Dhcp server is 192.168.1.1 and ap2 can not reach it so it has problem obtaining adresses automatically .	St
1.7.3	Gateway is 192.168.1.1/24 .	St
1.7.4	Any information you request will be added to diagram , I would really appreciate help on this one	St
1.8.1	Sorry but the make , model of the devices are eluding me .	St
1.8.2	Without them I ca n't check if they block or do n't bridge the DHCP .	St
1.8.3	Bob	St
1.9.1	Both APs are TP-link tl-wr543g with latest firmware ,	St
1.10.1	Nothing in the manual tells me the bridge mode will do what you want .	St
1.10.2	Unless the maker tells more , I 'd get my money back or try other modes .	St
1.10.3	Bob	St
1.11.1	Any chance for using copper ?	Ques
1.11.2	If they 're not physically attached , I 'd go underground and use the proper type for that purpose .	St
1.11.3	If you can DIY , it could be cheaper than using all this wireless hardware and definitely more reliable .	St
1.12.1	Yes you are right , all options are drained .	St
1.12.2	I will try to get at least one AP more for testing .	St
1.12.3	Thank you for your time Bob !	St
1.13.1	When I need to extend my range I 've used a common router but set it up as a WAP .	St
1.13.2	This is covered in the CNET Networking Forum sticky as well as GOOGLE & quot ; How to use a router as a WAP. & quot ; With that out of the way , I place this WAP where it gets the best shot at reaching my other location .	St
1.13.3	Now on the other side I can use a GAMING BRIDGE or a bridge that I used many times as a WIFI CLIENT is the WGPS606 The GAMING BRIDGE or WGPS606 is also placed where it has the best shot at connecting to the WAP ( which I used a common router ) and at that point I can test connectivity by plugging into the bridge 's ethernet ports .	St
1.13.4	If I want to get wifi coverage in that area I add one more router as a WAP and I 'm done .	St
1.13.5	That 's my formula that I 've used too many times .	St
1.13.6	Due to failures of those & quot ; bridges & quot ; I had to come up with something that I could make work .	St
1.13.7	Bob	St
1.14.1	I have read what you suggested me , and I did all like people wrote there , thing is still not working .	St
1.14.2	Maybe this is problem , it is my final guess : [ IMG ] http : //img97.imageshack.us/img97/3973/opmode.jpg [ /IMG ] This router has only these two modes , there is not regular Client mode ?	Ques
1.15.1	no way for wires Apt1 and Apt2 are not so close to each other ...	St
1.16.1	other physical barriers , you may also have problems getting a good wireless signal from one to the other .	St
1.16.2	You 'll probably need directional outdoor antennas .	St
1.16.3	Good luck	Polite
1.17.1	And you 're right .	Res
1.17.2	Maybe these are not the right parts .	St
1.17.3	After all this I thought it best to share my old setup that I 've used ... too many times .	St
1.17.4	Bob	St
1.18.1	Yes that is the problem , few minutes ago I replaced router TP-link tl-wr543g from Apt2 with regular AP with regular Client mode , and in a few minutes internet is in Apt2 ! !	St
1.18.2	Modes of LevelOne AP : [ img ] http : //img824.imageshack.us/img824/2509/levelone.jpg [ /img ] Thank you all for your time and efforts , and remember ( because I will ) that TP-link tl-wr543g CAN NOT be used as regular Client AP !	St
1.19.1	And right or wrong I find the maker 's support lines for this sort of setup to be quite poor .	St
1.19.2	Bob	St
