<s> The formatting is TERRIBLE. </s>
<s> I couldn't find your requirements. </s>
<s> Can you tell us this and keep it short? </s>
<s> All that you would have to share is the machine make, model, graphics card slot type and the power supply size in the host machine. </s>
<s> This should take much more length than my reply. </s>

<s> the game calls for a dx9 card with at least 32mb of ram. </s>
<s> the PC's video is dx7 and only has 16mb of ram. </s>
<s> the PC has no AGP nor PCI expansion slots at all so its video cannot be upgraded. </s>
<s> Huh? </s>
<s> Can I not just take out the old video card, and install a new one? </s>
<s> I am unsure of the slot type, I was hoping the information I posted would tell you. </s>
<s> Either way,the computer should show up today or tomorrow, so I will find out for sure then. </s>

<s> This machine is from about 8 years ago and the power supply is quite the weakling. </s>
<s> DO NOT UPGRADE. </s>
<s> I agree with the other posts here. </s>

<s> My god, if I had known it was that old, I may not have purchased it. </s>
<s> But how can it be that old? </s>
<s> XP professional didn't come out until 2002, and that is what this thing came with from the manufacturer. </s>
<s> Are power supplies computer specific? </s>
<s> If not, maybe I can pick up a better one for cheap somewhere, and finish this upgrade over time... </s>
<s> From what I could tell. </s>
<s> This unit has zero expansion possibilities. </s>
<s> If you find a better document link, please share. </s>
