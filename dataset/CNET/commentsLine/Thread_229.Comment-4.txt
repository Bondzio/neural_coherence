i hear you but are you willing to pay for the repairs that cost more than the printer?
it's not planned ob... it's simple economics.
if you can make a printer for 50 bucks retail that lasts for 2 years then why not?
it beats having to pay about a grand for a printer that lasts a decade.
250 bucks is cheaper than 1,000?
