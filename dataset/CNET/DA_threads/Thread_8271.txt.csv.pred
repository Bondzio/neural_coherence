1.1.1	Hello, first time poster here.	St
1.1.2	Hopefully someone can help us.	St
1.1.3	First my husband tried to install my old harddrive from an older computer into my newer computer.	St
1.1.4	We had everything shut off, touched the chasis so it would get rid of any static.	St
1.1.5	He had to take the video card out of the motherboard in order to fit the 2nd harddrive in the computer.	St
1.1.6	He didn't set the 2nd drive as a slave because he thought he could do that at the bios screen.	St
1.1.7	After everything was screwed in securely, he put the video card back in and put the cover back on the tower.	St
1.1.8	Plugged everything up, the fans were going, lights were going on the tower but we have no video.	St
1.1.9	We thought maybe it was the monitor, but we hooked it up to a working computer and the monitor checks out ok.	St
1.1.10	So we turned the computer off, opened the chasis, took the video card out and made sure no dust was in the video card slot.	St
1.1.11	We even took out the second harddrive incase it was conflicting.	St
1.1.12	We put the video card back, the chasis back on the tower and plugged everything back up.	St
1.1.13	We still get no video.	St
1.1.14	Now after the frustration of that, we tried hooking my harddrive up to his computer and it now has an error on it from all the shutdowns.	St
1.1.15	That is another thing that is frustrating us but that's another post.	St
1.1.16	We really need some help.	St
1.1.17	I really can't afford another computer nor right now someone to fix it.	St
1.1.18	I would greatly appreciate any help in this matter and would name my first born son or daughter after the person that can give us the resolution.	St
1.2.1	Unless your drives on the new system and old systems were jumpered cable select then you MUST change the jumper when you move the drive.	St
1.2.2	If both the old and new were CS then that is fine, but there is no way to do this at the BIOS.	St
1.2.3	The fact your husband thought he could do it in the bios shows he doesn't have a clue about working inside a computer.	St
1.2.4	Does the computer beep at all when you turn it on.	St
1.2.5	YOu must firmly seat the video card in the slot, was that done, sounds like it night not be all the way in.	St
1.2.6	You could try his video card in your system to see if that works.	Sug
1.2.7	Putting your drive in another system may have been the biggest mistake, it is going to get nothing but errors unless it goes into a system that is exactly the same.	St
1.2.8	If you booted it up in a different system with different hardware it may be be real messed up now and need Windows re-installed.	St
1.3.1	To be a little more detailed on your troubleshooting you should also try the video card in a different system if you have another that is compatible with the card.	St
1.3.2	Also, if you have on-board video, try using it.	St
1.3.3	Make sure on-board video is enabled in CMOS/BIOS Setup if you have that option.	Res
1.3.4	If you dont get any video with the on-board setup, then there is just a conflict with the hard drive jumper settings.	St
1.3.5	BIOS is registering both of the drives as your main(primary) drive which is a critical conflict when it comes to booting your system.	St
1.3.6	It basically means that although your fans, led lights, and possibly on-board sound, will work, none of your other hardware will work because the conflict is preventing windows from loading and, therefore, preventing the drivers for your hardware from loading.	St
1.4.1	They [she] also posted the problem in the Computer Help forum.	St
1.4.2	You might want to take a look there, and post your helpful inputs there..	Sug
1.4.3	Problem re BIOS is that they have no video, thus can't get to see BIOS.	St
