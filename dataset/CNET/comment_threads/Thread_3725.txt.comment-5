I don't find them anymore expensive to run as any other printers thye all can be very expensive to run it all depends on what kind of quality and prints you want.
I use Lexmark as I truly love the tech support.
I have tried getting tech support for Cannon, HP and Brother and the tech support was terrible and tjey were not helpful at all.
They all said you need a new printer and let me help you pick one out.
Overall I truly like the quality and clarity of the prints as they are printing true colors ex true purple and true reds and they are actally purple and red and not the washed out blues and deepened pink.
Like I said before this is my opinion.
