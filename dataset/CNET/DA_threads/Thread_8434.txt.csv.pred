1.1.4	Q: Is that normal that there is clicking sound when you turn your external hard drives on?	St
1.1.5	2) When I want to turn it off, I first go to safely remove hard drive and stop the drives there.	St
1.1.6	With my Seagate, I manage to turn it off silently after a few trials and errors but with my Adaptec, I always get the clicking sound when I turn it off.	St
1.1.7	Q: Is it normal that there is clicking sound when you turn off your hard drive?	St
1.1.8	(my seagate can be turned off without making any clicking noise.	St
1.1.9	The Adaptec makes sound when turn off, even after i stopped it through the safely remove hardware thing.)	St
1.2.1	not sure abotu external drives but NOTHING should be making a clicking sound in a hard drive.. that normally indecates a failure of the drive or read head.... but for external... i don't know if its the drive or something with the casing	St
