Since i have a low budget and I'm not even an extreme gamer, I just want to know - Is Nvidia Geforce 8400GS good for gaming (as compared to Nvidia Geforce 7300GT and Nvidia Geforce 7600) ? Also ,Is 256 MB Video Memory (512 MB with the Nvidia TurboCache feature) sufficient to play the current generation games quite smoothly ?

It's definitely off the bottom rung of those Intel GMA solutions and the other Nvidia 6150 but you will read less than glowing reports about speed on this DX10 capable chip. However it's going to run games at &quot;reasonable&quot; settings and the drivers are not done yet so stay tuned for updates. I'd take that one. Sorry, to compare to the other cards find benchmarks and compare. Bob

The Nvidia Geforce 8400GS has 6.4 GB/sec Memory Bandwidth while Nvidia Geforce 8500GT has 12.8 Gb/sec Memory Bandwidth ,Does this difference in Memory Bandwidth reflect in the gaming performance since most of the PC games have size lower than 6.4 GB. So, what's the use of these high Memory Bandwidths ?
