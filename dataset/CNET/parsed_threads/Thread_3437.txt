<s> My new antec case has a 3 pin power LED female connector (middle not wired). </s>
<s> The motherboard I'm using (ASUS) has a 2 pin connector for the power LED. </s>
<s> Its on the end so I might be able to move a pin to the middle and still use the case connector, or I could solder in a two pin; but I was wondering if anyone actually makes a jumper eg. </s>
<s> 3 pin male to 2 pin female or two single females? </s>
<s> Does it have a name if someone does make it? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> What case model? </s>
<s> What motherboard model? </s>
<s> Antec 160B ASUS P5PE-VM </s>
<s> I looked at your motherboard manual and saw what you meant about PLED+ and PLED- pins being immediately next to one another. </s>
<s> I wasn't able to confirm the configuration of the cable form the Antec 160B (I couldn't find the manual online). </s>
<s> Frontx.com sells different sizes of terminals, header connectors, and tools if you decide you need them: http://www.frontx.com/order_c.html How to: http://www.frontx.com/head_con.html </s>
<s> I moved one of the pins to the center position and it works fine. </s>
<s> Hadn't done it before so I was a little nervous about damaging the pin insert, but it worked out OK. </s>
<s> If the pins had not been on the end, they do make single male on one end and female on the other so I could have gone that route. </s>
<s> Anyway thank you for responding. </s>
<s> Back to building. </s>
<s> Its a great case by the way. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
