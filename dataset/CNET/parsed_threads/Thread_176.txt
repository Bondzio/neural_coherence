<s> I'm getting ready to start a new build in a few weeks and need opinions on which processor is right for me. </s>
<s> Like the thousands of other threads across the internet I'm deciding between the E8400 and the Q6600 but also looked at the E8200 and E7200. </s>
<s> I ruled the E8200 out right away since for only $10=$15 I can get the E8400. </s>
<s> I don't game very much now since my current system is over 5 years but wouldn't mind gaming once I build my new system. </s>
<s> Besides doing some gaming I use Photoshop CS3 quite a bit for photos and graphic work, The GIMP, occasionally Dreamweaver when I need to update my site, web surfing and listening to music. </s>
<s> I watch movies too and would like to able to play back HD content(720P and 1080P). </s>
<s> Which processor would fit my needs? </s>
<s> I plan on keeping this computer for at least 3-4 years maybe longer. </s>
<s> I'll update the GPU every year or so. </s>
<s> Although the quad core isn't really being utilized right now it seems to be the most &quot;future-proof&quot;. </s>
<s> I understand the logic behind this but in 3-4 years won't the Q6600 be a little under-powered, even at 3Ghz+, to really matter? </s>
<s> The E8400 is faster now but is still only dual core. </s>
<s> Any advice on the parts I selected is much appreciated. </s>
<s> ASUS P5E-VM HDMI 8800GT, not sure which one yet G.Skill DDR2 800 2x2GB Seagate 7200.11 500GB HDD Thermaltake 500W PSU Cooler Master case, either the Centurion 5 or the CM-690 </s>

<s> I was going to recommend the q9600. </s>
<s> It's the latest quad on the market and the same price as the q6600(a little more, but worth it). </s>
<s> When talking about overall design, the quads are the future. </s>
<s> Without getting to complicated, programs and executions can be assigned to operate on individual &quot;cores&quot;. </s>
<s> The quad cores will be optimized to move massive amounts of calculations by doing this. </s>
<s> Besides the awesome numbers and benchmarking these things produce, they are the best overclocking processors on the market. </s>
<s> I personally have seen a q6600 @ 2.4Ghz get to 3.8Ghz without breaking a sweat. </s>
<s> They claim the q9600 will go even further. </s>
<s> Regardless of application it makes sense to go with the Quad. </s>
<s> Duals will lose their appeal shortly. </s>
<s> Hope this helps and you are successful in your build. </s>
<s> Sorry it's Intel Q9300. </s>
<s> The 9800 must refer to the Nvida 9800 series Graphic cards I have been reviewing. </s>
<s> Sorry for the mistake! </s>
