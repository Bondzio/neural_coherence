<s> I bought an HP PSC1401 printer/scanner. </s>
<s> The install disk requires over 300mb of system memory. </s>
<s> Talk about a memory hog! </s>
<s> Is there a way to make this printer functional with less memory usage? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> But I think you meant 300MB of disk space. </s>
<s> I have yet to see the driver require 300MB of system memory or &quot;RAM.&quot; Did you look at hp.com for a driver only without the apps? </s>

<s> Sorry about that! </s>
<s> I meant disk space. </s>
<s> I will look on HP's website. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> During the printer install, verify if you can install a basic or limited version w/o all the bells and whistles. </s>
<s> Thgis assumes, that it allows this, I know my 1350 did but I found later I wanted the full install, so again see if yours allows this. </s>
<s> tada ----Willy </s>
