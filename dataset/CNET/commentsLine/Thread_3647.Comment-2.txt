clamping mechanism, [to me the brute strength seems a little bit of an overstatement] you'll find that the thermal grease/tape seems to have bonded the cpu.
simply gently rotate the hsf a little in each direction and it will come free with no problem.
of course to take the cpu you must gently depress the zif lever,move it outward a skosh and lift it up.
