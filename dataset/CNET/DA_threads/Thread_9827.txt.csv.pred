1.1.1	I need help finding pricing for systems , the RAM amount used when the systems first appeared .	St
1.1.2	The table below is what I am trying to comoplete .	St
1.1.3	Excel does not paste well into this format .	St
1.1.4	Is there a site that has pricing and RAM for a 1989 486dx 50 MHz machine ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks , astiller Year	St
1.2.1	More than likely those systems used 30 Simms Ram as my 486DX4-100 unit took 78 Simms Ram .	St
1.2.2	I worked on a number of 486 units with the 30 Simms Ram ( just threw out a whole slew of them two weeks ago , btw ) and 8MB ran over $ 30 per stick and had to be purchased as EDO/pairs by 1994 .	St
1.2.3	I do n't know the original price in 1989 , but assume it was much higher at that time because the 78 Simms was priced about the same $ 30 by 1994 .	St
1.2.4	TONI	St
1.3.1	PA in Sept 1994 its new computer had FOUR megabytes of RAM .	St
1.3.2	Accounting program [ Peachtree ] would n't run .	St
1.3.3	Added 4 MB for $ 200 .	St
1.3.4	$ 50 per MB ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	St
1.3.5	They were 72 [ or was it 78 pin ? ? ? ]	Ques
1.3.6	pin Fast Page Mode SIMMS .	St
1.3.7	EDO came out about that time .	St
1.4.1	A 1985 PC Magazine DRAM Chips ( 9 required ) 64K 9 for $ 20 128K for IBM AT $ 15 each ( 9 required ) 256K for IBM AT $ 15 each ( strange..same as 128K ) .	St
1.4.2	A 1992 PC Magazine shows 1meg 80ns Simms selling for $ 35 4meg 70ns Simms selling for $ 135 ( 30 pin ) 1993 Magazine shows 1meg 80ns SIMMs $ 39 4meg 80ns SIMMs $ 140 70ns $ 149 60ns $ 159 1997 PC Mag shows 168Pin DIMMs 8meg $ 50 16meg $ 94 32meg $ 179 64meg $ 429 128meg $ 950 256meg $ 1925 1999 used PC133 SDRAM at this time These are my costs for Resale .	St
1.4.3	32meg SDRAM $ 42- $ 49 64meg SDRAM $ 97 128MB Sdram $ 125 2000 The first P4 's used only RDRAM which costs about $ 200 per 128meg , extremely expensive and over priced .	St
