1.1.1	I need advice from someone familiar with internal technical details of the Pentium 4 CPU.	St
1.1.2	The P4 has a circuit which &quot;shuts the CPU off&quot; if a very high temperature is detected.	St
1.1.3	It is automatic and does not involve any software.	St
1.1.4	I suspect that the bus signal THERMTRIP# causes the CPU to drop into a SLEEP or DEEP SLEEP state.	St
1.1.5	My question #1: If the CPU goes into a SLEEP/DEEP-SLEEP state in the midst of normal operation, would I see the following?	St
1.1.6	(1) Complete absence of any sign of activity other than continued spinning of the hard disks and fans; (2) Complete nonresponsiveness to any user action (mouse, key presses, even pressing the power-off button uinless held for 5 seconds or longer); (3) All visible indications (screen display, indicator LEDs) frozen in the exact state occupied at the instant that the SLEEP/DEEP-SLEEP state was entered - in other words, the screen continues to display desktop and application displays (frozen), not a blue, dark, or corrupted screen.	St
1.1.7	Finally, what circumstances other than an extreme over-temp condition can cause such a switch to SLEEP/DEEP-SLEEP?	St
1.1.8	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	reduces it's clock rate well before it hits the shutdown temp.	St
1.2.2	It doesn't go to sleep, simply slows down.	St
1.2.3	Read at some of the gamers forums where they run into the throttling because it slows the game performance down.	St
1.2.4	They then do whatever is necessary to greatly improve their cooling capability.	St
1.2.5	Please be aware that one can download [PDF's] a plethora of detailed thermal design, performance analysis engineering documents, white papers on key subjects, that provides the info.	St
1.2.6	Takes some wading through many pages but it is all there, except that I find no really clear explanation of quad pumping to get their 800 MHz and 10XX FSB..	St
1.3.1	go to the Intel site, download 30056401.PDF Title is Intel Pentium 4 on 90 nm Process thermal design guide.	Sug
1.3.2	On page 26 it shows how the PROCOHT# signal modulates the Normal clock by an internal clock duty cycle resulting in an intermittent clock rate that allows the CPU to keep running at a slower rate, thus reducing the power consumption.	St
1.3.3	Further on one can read about the shutdown signal.	St
1.3.4	It never goes into a sleep mode.	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	when that signal trips, it tells the mobo to shut the power supply off!!!	St
1.5.2	Obviously your mobo doesn't have the necessary shut down logic circuits or they have failed.	St
1.5.3	This info is also discussed in the refenced document.	St
1.6.1	Here's what Intel's P4 data sheet says about the THERMTRIP condition.	St
1.6.2	My interpretation of this is that the system is still powered but the system clocks are stopped (or the CPU clock at least) and, probably, certain voltages lowered.	St
1.6.3	Here's Intel: The processor protects itself from catastrophic overheating by use of an internal thermal sensor.	St
1.6.4	This sensor is set well above the normal operating temperature to ensure that there are no false trips.	St
1.6.5	The processor will stop all execution when the junction temperature exceeds approximately 135C.	St
1.6.6	This is signalled to the system by the THERMTRIP# (Thermal Trip) pin.	St
1.6.7	Once activated, the signal remains latched, and the processor stopped, until RESET# goes active.	St
1.6.8	There is no hysteresis built into the thermal sensor itself; as long as the die temperature drops below the trip level, a RESET# pulse will reset the processor and execution will continue.	St
1.6.9	If the temperature has not dropped below the trip level, the processor will continue to drive THERMTRIP# and remain stopped.	St
1.7.1	I think my earlier reply didn't go through, so ...	Polite
1.7.2	Thanks.	St
1.7.3	However, my question unfortunately was not academic - I am experiencing the exact symptoms I described so the situation is not a normal clock-throttling situation.	St
1.7.4	Basically, my question is: What hardware situation (and I'm 99.99% sure it is hardware)can produce these symptoms?	St
1.8.1	path to.	St
1.8.2	Intel expects the mobo mfr to shut the power supply off when that signal goes [true] [or whatever the shutdown state is.	St
1.8.3	If that happens, what the CPU does becomes a moot point, and certainly a reset will occur at the next power up.	St
1.8.4	Not at all sure what will cause the RESET# automatically.	St
