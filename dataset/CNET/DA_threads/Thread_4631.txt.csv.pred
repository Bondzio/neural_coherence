1.2.1	I 've never used a green drive , but from my understanding all it is is that it uses less power ( hence & quot ; green & quot ; , to lower you 're carbon footprint ) .	St
1.2.2	Everything else works the same just the drive uses less power .	St
1.3.1	Generally , the ones I 've seen with this feature have a shorter warranty .	St
1.3.2	I do n't know if this relates to quality standards that are relaxed in these or not .	St
1.3.3	But , a drive that breaks and goes to the dump earlier than one that does not , loses some & quot ; green & quot ; appeal ... or so I 'd think .	St
1.3.4	It takes energy to make the drive as well .	St
1.3.5	It 's only & quot ; greener & quot ; if the overall consumption of energy from manufacturing to disposal is less than one without that label .	St
1.3.6	But earlier disposal can mean additional environmental impact and this makes it 's & quot ; greenness & quot ; difficult to qualify .	St
