i am upgrading from a sony trinitron to probably a sony or dell 19&quot; flat panel.
my video card is 3 yrs old but works very well with my current monitor.
what card would you recommend i upgrade to or is it necessary.
the monitor will probably run around 400 so i don't want to spend too much or i might as well just buy a new computer.
thank in advance.roy
