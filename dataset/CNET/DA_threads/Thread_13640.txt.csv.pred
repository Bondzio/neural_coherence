1.2.7	Some computer parts stores will do COD ( cash on delivery ) .	St
1.2.8	Perhaps you can setup an account before you go back .	St
1.2.9	Self build is best if you have the know how but built to order is allot easier .	St
1.2.10	As to the price list in your post I can not say good or bad .	St
1.2.11	In the computer world of pricing a price quote is like a letter written on the sand of the waters edge while the tide is coming in .	St
1.2.12	Price the parts out at a site like NewEgg or Tigerdirect .	St
1.2.13	Then try to beat it at Dell , or HP built to order site .	St

1.3.1	Here are my observations : 1 ) Those prices are kinda on the high side .	St
1.3.2	That processor is available online for $ 225 .	St
1.3.3	$ 40 is n't the end of the world , but when you 're on a budget ALL students are on a budget ; lol ) , every dollar matters .	St
1.3.4	2 ) Why 3GB of RAM ?	Ques
1.3.5	By getting 3x1GB sticks , you wo n't be able to have dual-channel .	St
1.3.6	I 'd stick with 2x1GB for now , and then , when Windows Vista comes out , MAYBE upgrade to 4GB .	St
1.3.7	3 ) 7600GTs are available for as little as $ 110 online , on sites such as newegg.com .	St
1.3.8	4 ) Get a different brand of hard drive , as Hitachis are n't known for being reliable .	St
1.3.9	Another name for the Deskstar is the Deathstar .	St
1.3.10	5 ) For the case , I 'd get anything made by Lian-Li or Antec .	St
1.3.11	6 ) For the power supply , I 'd get an Antec TruePower 430 watt .	St
1.3.12	If you 're not up to building a computer , you should look at Monarch Computer , as you can choose every individual component ( down to the RAM and power supply ) , and they 'll build it for you and ship it to you .	St
1.4.1	I agree with Nathanpsz2 about that hard drive , Stay away from Hitachis .	St
1.4.2	I bought one 3 years ago and it died in 4 months .	St
