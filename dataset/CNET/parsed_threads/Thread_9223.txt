<s> My daughter will be traveling abroad soon. </s>
<s> We want to Skype while she's gone. </s>
<s> She's taking a 4 yr old Dell Vostro 1500 laptop w/ XP and we have a 5 yr old Dell Inspiron 9300 laptop with XP. </s>
<s> Does anyone have suggestions on reliable webcams that will run well on our laptops? </s>
<s> Logitech and surprisingly the Microsoft Life Cams. </s>
<s> Thanks for the fast response! </s>
<s> I noticed most require Pentium 4 as a minimum requirement. </s>
<s> My Inspiron 9300 is a Pentium M and I'm not sure about the Vosro. </s>
<s> Will it be compatible? </s>
<s> Also, what if the processor speeds required are higher then what we have, will the webcamstill work? </s>
<s> The will it work should be yes. </s>
<s> How well it works varies on user expectations to how good the internet connect is. </s>
<s> But those names tend to be fine. </s>
<s> About processor speeds. </s>
<s> The Pentium 4 clock rate and how the Centrino clock rate was lower but the Centrino still outpaced the old P4 is an old discussion. </s>
<s> Let's say you only need to be close. </s>
