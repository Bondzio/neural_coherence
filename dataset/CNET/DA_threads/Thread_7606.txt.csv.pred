1.1.1	Hey, I've got a Dell Inspiron 531 with a Geforce 8600 GT and I would like to upgrade it to a HD 3850.	St
1.1.2	Will it fit and will it work?	St
1.2.1	Yes, it will fit but you need a new power supply.	St
1.2.2	They are standard ATX now (not sure if they were before) so any ATX power supply will do.	St
1.2.3	Go for one that is at least 400-450 watts with bare minimum 18A on the 12v+ for the video card (if its split up into multiple rails, usually the highest amperage is to the video card) and remember it MUST be PCI-Express and Serial ATA ready.	St
1.2.4	I highly suggest a supply with 4 SATA connectors but 2 will work fine (unless you have 2 harddrives and/or 2 CD drives), if it is only 2 SATA on a single line, then you will need to flip the harddrive around so it will reach (meaning no more screws holding in the harddrive).	St
1.2.5	Other than that, I managed to weasel in an 8800GT fairly easily, if you have two harddrives, you will have to temporarily remove the second one (labelled HDD1) and you WILL have to buy a 4 SATA PSU (usually 550 watts or more)	St
