If a driver for your modem is not offered for Windows XP and it's not natively supported, go shopping.
About 10 bucks finds modems that have XP drivers.
Compgeeks.com for example.
Another avenue is to call the place that sold you the modem, ask for the XP driver or ask them to trade it for one that does XP.
