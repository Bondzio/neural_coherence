could i backup all my fixed hard drive data on an external one only for purpose of keeping backup in case of break.
then if suddendly the fixed hard drive break on my computer i've just to recopy the external drive to my fixed one.
i'm thinking of that manner compared to keeping cd data who is very limited.
