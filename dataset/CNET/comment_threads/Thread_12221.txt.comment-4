If you want to be able to setup access and permissions for a shared folder as if you and the remote computer were on your home network, use Hamachi, a free, easy-to-install software-only VPN solution.
Hamachi (www.hamachi.cc)has the endorsement of well-known security expert Steve Gibson (see http://www.grc.com/sn/SN-018.pdf ) If you are sharing large files, and you want to have access to them even if the remote system is turned off, you'll want a solution that duplicates the files on each machine (to avoid waits when you access them) and keeps those duplicates synchronized.
Use: Folderhare (www.foldershare.com, acquired by Microsoft).
Note that a foldershared folder allows you to set very basic permissions, unlike Hamacchi.
For example, if you are sharing a folder &quot;Folder1&quot; containing files &quot;A,B,C&quot; to users X,Y,and Z. Hamacchi will allow you to use standard Windows file sharing to: Allow user X to only see A,B,and C Allow user Y to see and change all the files.
Allow user Z to see or change file A and B, but only see file C. In contrast, when you share the folder through foldershare, if you permit a user to change any file in the folder, you must grant him the ability to change ALL of the files in the folder.
Thux, you can Allow user X to only see A,B,and C Allow user Y to see and change all the files.
Allow user Z to see or change file A and B, but you cannot prohibit him from changing C. Finally, when a file has been changed on a system that has been offline (and therefore not immediately synchronized), you can have version conflicts which will be flagged to you.
This is not the case with Hamachi, where one computer is accessing the file across the network on another computer.
