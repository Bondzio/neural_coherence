I recently acquired an HP Omnibook 6100 with a cd-rw dvd rom.
It had no operating system due to a hard drive replacement, so I installed a legal copy of Windows 98 SE.
I've done all the upgrades thru MS and the unit works fine, except that it won't play a DVD.
I know the unit works because it plays CD's and writes to CD's just fine.
It appears the drive is a Toshiba.
Help.
