For some insane reason, after so many years with an HP desktop, i foolishly decided to take the hook, and by an imac osx 10.6.4 2.66 ghz intel core 2 duo 2gb 1076 mhz ddr3 ram. Can anyone help me with a way to improve the audio?? I use a logitech x540 5.1 speaker system which sounds AWSOME on my old hp, but sounds like @#$% on this mac. the store where i bought the mac suggested these speakers, said speakers i have no problem with. Before i throw this mac out the 2nd story window, anyone have any ideas?? Thanks JC

The built in speakers on the iMac do a decent job. Is the sound from the internal speakers better than the sound from the external speakers? In the System Preferences\Sound Preference pane, is the output set to the external speakers? P
