okay, i've noticed that the red light will keep blinking and the printer will tell you to load the envelope in tray 1 even if you already have.
i've found just jiggling the paper/envelope against the sensor or pushing down gently on the tray will get it to recognize that it's been loaded.
is that the problem you're having?
?
