They also don't show up in &quot;Disk Management&quot;. This is the second time in a week this has happened. The last time it was fixed was after I rebooted the PC. Both times I was trying to play a song in Itunes, when I was unable to access the drives. My D drive is for my media files. G is my bluray drive and works fine. My DVD drive is L... I think. How do I fix this? Thanks for any info! Windows 7 64 bit, i7 980x @333 6 core processor, 12 GB ram DDR 1600, Radeon 5850 GPU, OCZ Vertex 3 120GB SSD

If the BIOS does not, you ask the machine's maker big questions. I'll take it that it's out of warranty and you are not comfortable with checking cable connections. Bob

It's possible the builder didn't install the chipset drivers, latest BIOS and overtaxed the PSU. Looks like you have questions for this PC's maker. Bob
