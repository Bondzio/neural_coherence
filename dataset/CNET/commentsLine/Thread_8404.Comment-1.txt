i am putting a barebones system together from tiger direct.
not my first.
everything seems ok but i have the 24 pin power connector on.
but dont have the 12v 4 pin coming from the power supply.
there was a 6 pin connector off the power supply which i plugged in, and the system booted ok.is this ok to use as is.
its a thermaltake v2 case with a 450 watt psu.
