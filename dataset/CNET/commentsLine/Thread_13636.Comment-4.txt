you could try re-installing the tcp/ip protocol, and microsoft client, but that's not going to help if you have spyware or a virus.
you could download stinger:  and it fits on a floppy, since you don't seem to be able to get to the internet.
does the computer have any antivirus software running?
are the signatures current?
any antispyware software?
