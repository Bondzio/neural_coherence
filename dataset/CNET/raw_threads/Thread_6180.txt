AMD Athlon XP 1600 ASUS A7V133 Mobo 1 gig SDRAM e-GeForce FX 5200 Video LG DVD Reader LG DVD RW+-R I was doing a new OS install on it yesterday and in the middle of it the Power Supply died. It was an old 300w. I got it replaced with a 450w and today when I was doing the install it died again. Do you think its just bad luck or could this be caused by something else ? Up untill i decided to reinstall the OS (XP Prof), the comp was running fine

We keep upping the power supply wattage until one day the one with a 550 Watt supply did not burn out the supply but the motherboard went BANG!!! and there we found out about that issue. Type MOTHERBOARD BAD CAPS into google.com Bob
