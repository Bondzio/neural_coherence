And neither iPad's not (most) Android laptops support that. And, of course, don't have a very good speakers. So you should use either a headphone/earbuds or external speakers. But for those external speakers the tablet should have a connection. And, of course, it should have WiFi, so it can connect to your wireless router. So you've got some nice selection criteria, when you visit a shop: - must have WiFi - must be able to use external speakers - must be able to play that specific radio channel Let the sales person show that it work, before you buy it!
