Thanks for the advice, but I already removed the legacy device in Safe Mode, so it no longer exists.
I did however disable the soundblaster's main driver in Safe Mode, then rebooted, and attempted to enable it.
It detected the legacy device again, and hung the system.
Any other ideas?
Thanks again.
