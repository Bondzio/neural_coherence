1.1.4	I want to build a System with both PCIE and AGP slots and use my old card instead of tossing it .	St
1.1.5	So is this a Possibility .	St
1.1.6	Please Assist if U can	St
1.2.1	get a motherboard that can take both an agp & a pcie card ?	Ques
1.3.1	you can choose to do more research on this if you like .	St
1.3.2	The first thing might be to see if such board/s exist .	St
1.4.1	you 'd have to check whether you can use both at the same time .	St
1.4.2	Check out the ASRock Motherboards .	St
1.4.3	http : //www.asrock.com/index.asp Let us know .	St
1.4.4	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	All produced boards with both AGP and PCI Express , they are almost all exclusively based on the VIA PT880 series of chipsets , and usually offer a PCIe x16 mechanical slot , which is only wired for x4 transfers .	St
1.5.2	I would suggest considering a TV tuner board in addition to your new PCI Express board , instead of spending a great deal of time and money looking for a fairly proprietary motherboard design , especially as the PT880 is no longer a new chipset , which causes some problems for future upgrades .	Sug
1.5.3	ASRock at a time produced an AMD motherboard which offered PCI Express x16 ( full x16 transfers ) and AGP 8x ( full speed as well ) , based on a ULi solution , however this board is notoriously hard to find , especially now that ULi is part of nVidia .	St
1.5.4	Additionally , this board was designed for Socket 939 , Socket AM2 could be ammended to it through means of a proprietary add-in board , which is usually even harder to find .	St
1.5.5	The setup actually work fairly well , it was just very hard to find available for purchase .	St
1.5.6	I know that at one time Newegg sold the board , however I 'm doubting if they still do .	St
1.6.1	Well All I want to do is use agp and pcie cards thats it not anything Fancy Just dont want to toss my old card since it works fine ...	St
1.6.2	I could care less about a MB with bult in Crap I wouldnt buy anyway cause Bult in meens Not upgradable .	St
1.6.3	Not that you cant hook a newer tv tuner into that mb .	St
1.6.4	And who knows maybe the mb will be dumb and fight the new card .	St
1.6.5	All I wanted to know was plainly This Do the new Generation MB still Fight for Video Dominece between Ports .	St
1.6.6	Example back int he day if you had Onboard Video and a new vid card if you didnt disable the On board the PC tried to feed bits of into to both Video sources .	St
1.6.7	So you were Forced to Disable Onboard Video .	St
1.6.8	BUT will 2 video cards nowadays do the same Retardation or have we leaped forward from this glitch and I dont know steped forward in PC Intelegence ... Me am just want use 2 vid cards agp/tvtuner and pcie new purdy stuff can u am answer me rationaly internet world people .	Sug
