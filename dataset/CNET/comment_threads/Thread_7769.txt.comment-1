I have been having frequent disconnects there records show error code one which means user disconnect which is from my router.
now that being said I have replaced numerous routers that display the same symptoms of either disconnects and slow bandwidth.
the Isp sends out a tech armed with only a laptop and using a speed test to test there systems and nothing else.
according to the techs either help desk or their service techs since there is no modem.
which tells me they haven't figured out the fiber optics has to translate to and from the computer or modem.
one fiber optic line to multiplexer demultiplexer to go from one serial to how ever many cat 5 address lines what i just wrote is a oversimplification of the process since telephone cable tv uses this line as well.and other processes occur as well to get Internet access.
now the big question what test equipment do i need to see the true speed of my access i have to prove to them it is not the routers fault since i agree with linksys that to have the same symptoms appear on all the routers I have owned.
