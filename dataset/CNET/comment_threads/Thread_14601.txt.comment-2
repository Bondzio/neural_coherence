If your graphics card has a VGA output and you have an adapter and the proper cables the hook into a TV you should be ok.
If this is true what graphics card do you have.
Some older ones have VGA output and won't be able to support that awesome 1080 p resolution.
and also i think all TV's can support as a screen.
don;t quote me on that because i might depend on your operating system and system specs, but your a computer programmer so i suspect that you have a pretty nice system.
