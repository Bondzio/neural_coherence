thank you for your reply.
you seem to be suggesting that major renovations would be required to install another hd on my pavilion computer.
perhaps buying a new computer would solve the problem, but i cannot afford that.
i understood when i bought this computer the future limitations.
the sales rep admitted this computer would be obsolete in 2 years i thought having 2 unused sata sockets on the motherboard might make this possible.
also chucking my present 750gb storage drive is an unlikely action.
i guess i need something like 2 tb, which are really expensive, and would still require increased cooling capability.
it appears i have reached the limit with my present desktop computer.
perhaps i should consider an external storage drive with the slower data transfer rates.
oh.
and i forgot that my lacie backup drive is 1tb.
so there is more than one investment here.
thank you for the information.
