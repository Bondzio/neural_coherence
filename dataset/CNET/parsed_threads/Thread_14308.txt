<s> I recently changed to Charter from ATT DSL. </s>
<s> The modem that they provided (rental) is Motorola Surfboard SB5101N. </s>
<s> Is this modem the best option if I decide to buy rather than rent? </s>
<s> Also what router should I need to optimize the service? </s>
<s> No gaming or other uses, just internet connection for laptop, iPad & iPhone. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Cable is going (eventually) to a new protocol called DOCSIS 3.0 (much faster speed). </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The Internet is changing to IPv6. </s>
<s> Get a modem that supports both. </s>
<s> I just purchased a Cisco DCP3000 that supports the new DOCSIS and IPv6, and is Gigabit output. </s>
<s> For a router I have the D-link DIR-655 Gigabit wired/wireless N. These two together will serve you well into the future. </s>
<s> And I hate to brag, but here is a screenshot of my Roadrunner cable speed after I installed the modem. </s>

<s> are you all by yourself on the line, hehe? </s>
<s> I am going to complain to my ISP. </s>
<s> You think it's the HARDWARES that doing it? </s>
<s> Actual steady speed is around 40 Meg. </s>
<s> I get that every day. </s>
<s> I do attribute it to the new modem. </s>
<s> Since I taught dial-up back in the 80s, back then I would never have imagined this speed. </s>
<s> Back then a T-1 at 1.544 Mb/s was blistering speed. </s>
<s> Where did you buy the Cisco DPC3000 and how much? </s>
