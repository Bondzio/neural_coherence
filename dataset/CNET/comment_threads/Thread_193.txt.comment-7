it's already known that SM3.0 is going to be a requirement of upcoming games the FP precision thing hasn't been an issue for ATi, and probably won't be for a long time (i'm guessing the game will be overall too demanding/beyond the card's overall ability before the FP issue arises) but SM3.0 is going to be a part of upcoming games because it's a part of current games (Half-Life 2 and FarCry can use it, and do use it on GeForce 6 cards) my take is basically this: if your fine buying a $300-$500 card that you already KNOW will have issues with games due to lack of feature support, go for it, just know that you have to upgrade sooner me personally, I cannot justify purchase of a $300-$600 card that won't support things I want it to support in the future i'd rather be able to play the game at the settings I like 6800GT allows that, I don't feel that if i'm spending a fair deal of my hard earned money that I should have to compromise just to say I have a different brand or to get 2-3% higher in a benchmark
