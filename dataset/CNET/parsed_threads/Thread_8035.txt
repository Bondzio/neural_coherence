<s> i have a sony vaio (PCV-RZ50CG), i keep getting a low space error. </s>
<s> so i do a disk clean up and that is good for about a hour but then it needs it again. </s>
<s> my c drive is 13.9 GB with 159MB of free space left, my d drive is 212 GB with 3.25 GB free space left. </s>
<s> I know my d drive is filled with media center files that i can transfer to dvd but im having trouble with my C drive. </s>
<s> i try to scan it and see what files i can erase. </s>
<s> all the temp files and cookies get deleted but that dosent help the problem. </s>
<s> I come across so many files that i dont know what they do and i dont want to erase them and not have the computer not start up next time. </s>
<s> does anyone have any ideas on getting rid of mystery files, or if there is a software that would scan my computer and tell me if i need them or not? </s>
<s> thanks for the help! </s>
<s> 13.9 gigs is fairly small. </s>
<s> Even you secondary drive is getting full. </s>
<s> You might get a much larger drive than your existing secondary and transfer the data to that one and use your existing secondary as the primary. </s>
<s> There are some files you can manually delete that might help. </s>
<s> All of your Windows update files can probably go. </s>
<s> If you have XP, these are in your Windows folder. </s>
<s> If you have your advanced power settings set to allow hibernation, turn that off and remove the file it creates which is about 512 megs. </s>
<s> If you have adequate physical RAM, reduce the size of your swap file. </s>
<s> If you use IE, configure it to delete cache upon exiting. </s>
<s> If you use another browser, reduce the cache size allocated. </s>
<s> You can also reduce the size allocated to system restore. </s>
<s> All of this might get back a couple gigs but it does look like a new drive is in order. </s>
<s> Either buy a larger drive or go to your control panel click on (Add Remove Programs) go down the program list if you don't use it uninstall it. </s>
<s> you should keep at least 500 meg or more freed up. </s>
<s> Grab a copy of this and let it scan,,,see what it finds. </s>
