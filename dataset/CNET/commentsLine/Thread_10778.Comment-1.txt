i was hoping someone could give me some advice on upgrading memory.
i hate to ask what might be a basic question but i also don't want to either buy the incorrect or best option for memory.
i am looking to upgrade my pc to i think 4gb of ram.
i currently have a hp m7248n with 1 mb of ram.
more specifically acording to the stats i have 2 x 512/ 184 pin, ddr sdram.
the pc has a athlon 64 x2 (m) 4200 2.2 ghz processor and i am running windows xp media center edition ver 2002 service pack 2. i also believe i have 4 slots for memory (2 in use, 2 available).
i have included a link to the hp web site with my model below if i left out any additional information.
in regards to use, i am not a huge power user except for the fact i burn a lot of dvds of home movies.
also burn cd's, listen to music, transfer songs to mp3.
i also do a lot of uploading photos etc.
(dad of 3 kids basically).
i don't do gaming really at all, so beyond the power intensive dvd rendering and other items above my use ends up mainly limited to internet etc.
here are my questions: 1) right off the bat, what kind of memory should i get?
when i did a quick look i saw options such as 800 mhz ddr2, 1333 mhz ddr3 etc.
i know what memory is in general, but get lost on the ddr2 vs ddr3 etc 2) if i have 4 slots open, and am interested in 4 gb, can i actually buy 2 2 gb cards and keep my existing 2 and actually end up with 5 gb?
or am i better off yanking what i have and just putting in the 2 2 gb (or maybe 4 1 gb if the cost make more sense) i hope i provided enough info and made my questions clear.
if not scold me, i have a thick skin, then tell me what else you need to know.
also i am fairly comfortable with opening the system, removing the memory i have, putting new in etc - i have done that before, it is not a matter of how to but what i need.
thanks thanks thanks in advance agian, if needed, additional link to pc model with technical stats:
