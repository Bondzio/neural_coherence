Have an adaptec USB hard drive enclosure.
I got it hoping that I could use it rescue data on some drives, or just as an external drive as well.
I've read through a bunch of the forum posts where they say you need to prepare a drive to be used in such a situation.
The drives I'm hoping to use are already formatted, one of them is dynamic NTFS.
It seems to boot up and is spinning but my XP Pro system doesn't see it.
Would appreciate any assistance as I really need to get the data off this healthy drive.
