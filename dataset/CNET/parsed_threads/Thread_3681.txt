<s> I tried to build a computer with a Asus P4S133 Motherboard a Intel Pentium 4 CPU but when I try to boot it up there is nothing on the screen there also is nothing from the speaker, there is power to the monitor, I have tried another monitor with the same result, the LED inside the computer is lit, the CD tray will open and close. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any idea as to what I can check or what I can do to try and get it to work. </s>
<s> Thank you Linda </s>
<s> You may have a warranty issue with the supplier. </s>
<s> Ask them what parts you need to return. </s>
<s> Some notes about what new builders seem to trip over: 1. </s>
<s> The CMOS reset jumper is in the reset position. </s>
<s> (Who checks the manual?) </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> A motherboard manual had the HD LED on the REST connection. </s>
<s> The manual was wrong, but the markings on the motherboard was marked proper. </s>
<s> (So much for reading the manual!) </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> The machine was put all together and it won't fire up. </s>
<s> TRY LESS PARTS. </s>
<s> All I need for BEEPS (forget video!) </s>
<s> is the CPU, heatsink/fan, power supply and the speaker. </s>
<s> No video, ram, ide cables, cards or anything but the four parts. </s>
<s> No beeps? </s>
<s> Remove the case. </s>
<s> No beeps? </s>
<s> You are looking at the four possible dead parts. </s>
