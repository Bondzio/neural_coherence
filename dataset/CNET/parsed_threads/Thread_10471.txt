<s> I have a Canon MP730 4 in 1 printer that uses USB to connect to my desktop PC. </s>
<s> I am using a D-Link wireless broadband router for my wireless network. </s>
<s> My desktop is connected to the router via patch cable, but my 2 laptops are using D-Link Wireless cards. </s>
<s> I want my laptops to be able to share the printer, so I thought about getting a wiresless print server. </s>
<s> But with the Canon printer using a USB cable for commumnication, cant I just get a USB Wireless adapter? </s>
<s> Its a lot cheaper than the print server. </s>
<s> Any suggestions???? </s>
<s> I am running Windows XP on all PC's. </s>
<s> 1) You will need a print server, as it has the necessary firmware and software controls for managing the flow of data into the printer and printer comminications back to the source. </s>
<s> A plain USB wireless adapter cannot do that. </s>
<s> 2) USB Printer servers come in wired and wireless flavors. </s>
<s> For best performance, I recommend you should use a wired model. </s>
<s> This gives best speed between the network and the printer and it keeps the printer communications from burdening the limited bandwidth of the wireless portion of your network. </s>
<s> (Remember, the printer data must traverse the wireless network twice - once from the host to the router, and then back out from the router to the printer.) </s>
<s> Physical configuration is easy - an ethernet cable from one of the unused ports on your broadband router to the print server, and then plug your printer into the USB port on the server. </s>
<s> If for whatever reason you can't put another ethernet cable between the broadband router and the printer, then you can use a somewhat more expensive wireless print server. </s>
<s> As with the wired model, the printer plugs into the USB port on the print server, but the connection to the network is via radio signals to the broadband router. </s>
