1.1.1	I was wondering how do you wire an RJ45 wall socket after it has been daisy chained.	St
1.1.2	My friend said that the wires need to be connected for the sockets to work.	St
1.1.3	For example, cable A is connected in its respected slot and cable B is connected in its respected slot.	St
1.1.4	How would I connect cable A to cable B?	Polite
1.1.5	In fact how would I connect the cables together if there were 4 or 5 cables that need to be connected?	St
1.1.6	I have a guess that I would need to create some sort of jumper wire between the sockets but I don't want to jump the gun on this one and have to redo all the work.	St
1.1.7	If more details are required just ask.	St

1.3.1	&quot;You cannot &quot;piggy back&quot; a digital connection.	St
1.3.2	Voice OK, not digital.&quot; By your statement above it seems to me that you are saying you can connect telephone together?	St
1.3.3	How would one do that?	Ques
1.4.1	Digital no.	St
1.4.2	Telephones can be daisy chained or home run, your choice as they are all hooked in parallel.	St
