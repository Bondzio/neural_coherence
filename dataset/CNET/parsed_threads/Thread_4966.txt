<s> Hiya peoples I have just upgraded my computer and am having difficulty getting sound.. </s>
<s> I have...ecsk7s5a mother board and pentium 4.. no sound card at the mo.. </s>
<s> I have checked all bois settings and as far as i can see they are correct.. got all drivers including the sound driver.. checked the bios and ac97 is enabled and still no sound from the speakers.. i know my speakers work as i tested them on another machine. </s>
<s> I am a real newb at anything outside of windows so any advice on how to &quot;get some bloomin sound&quot; would be a bonus.. Any tips??? </s>
<s> thanks in advance.. willy </s>
<s> have the Sound icon in the toobar? </s>
<s> no i dont have the sond icon in the toolbar, i disbled it due to the fact there was no point it being there as i have no sound output. </s>
<s> looked at Sound Properties and made sure your outputs were not on mute? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Make sure you have them plugged in the green jack in the back. </s>
<s> I have seen many people pull out their hair and the jack order was different. </s>
<s> they did not look at the colors. </s>
<s> Try removing and reinstalling the driver again. </s>
<s> Did you get the driver from the CD that came with the board or was it something you downloaded? </s>
<s> (Try the CD to be safe) After that, go pip up a Sound Blaster Live or Audigy. </s>
<s> You will be much happier anyway. </s>
