1.1.1	Hey guys , I really need help on choosing the right gaming pc in time for Christmas-ish .	St
1.1.2	This will be the first gaming pc though I am a devout gamer , consoles mainly until my friend introduced me to the world of pc gaming so this is the first time I have ever bought one so be gentle with me .	St
1.1.3	I 'm looking around for a good pc that runs the latest games and is going to be future proof for a number of years .	St
1.1.4	I have a budget of around & # 163 ; 1000 though I may be able to go up and down a little bearing in mind that I have got to buy a monitor and keyboard etc ( Using a laptop at the moment ) .	St
1.1.5	I have been snooping around and the amount of choices are insane .	St
1.1.6	So essentially what I would really like is advice on graphics cards , processors and the likes and what I could get for most bang for my buck .	St
1.1.7	Recommendations are welcome whether it be desktops or sites but I have no intention of building my own I 'm afraid .	St
1.1.8	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Any dual core CPU is about all we need .	St
1.2.2	4 or more GB RAM and then the ALL IMPORTANT VIDEO CARD .	St
1.2.3	I have a list I really like .	St
1.2.4	Here it is - & gt ; http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-performance-radeon-geforce,3018.html Frankly any card above the 101 USD line is going to rock compared to most off the shelf desktops .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Why go with a dual core , when you can get an i3 quad core for another hundred dollars or so .	Sug
1.3.2	A dual core may work just fine , but the op was requesting a machine that would n't be horribly outdated for a couple years or so .	St
1.3.3	My advice would be to look for an Intel i5 quad core .	St
1.3.4	You will notice a difference in performance between the two .	St
1.4.1	Do you have some online shopping sites in the UK that you would consider buying a pre-built PC from ?	Ques

1.5.1	Sorry about late reply have n't had the time to check emails properly in ages .	St
