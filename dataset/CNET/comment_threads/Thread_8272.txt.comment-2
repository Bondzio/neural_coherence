I don't want to repeat the long discussion about media encoding but what I've seeing are folk expecting these tablets to play whatever you can on a PC.
Nothing is farther from reality.
The iPad is a little better at this as you funnel most content through iTunes and it can re-encode content (sometimes) and if you get content from the store, it's encoded properly which makes some folk think it's a better player.
And a runner up is the Kindle Fire.
It's not that expensive compared to the others and with Amazon Prime you get a lot of content.
About the media card.
With streaming and more, that idea is losing ground.
