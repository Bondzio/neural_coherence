1.1.1	should i get an intel core2duo?	St
1.1.2	or an AM2?	St
1.1.3	Which will prevail in future?	St
1.1.4	Because i was thinking when if AMD comes out with a new processor that beats the e6600 will that be a waste of my money?	St
1.1.5	or will intel come out with another processor to beat the one that beat the e6600?	St
1.1.6	but when intel makes the octacore processor will it be for another socket?	St
1.1.7	I'm just wondering because i was thinking of upgrading from socket 939 to either AM2 or LGA 775.	St
1.1.8	NEED OPINIONS HERE PLEASE	St
1.2.1	...but then I'd also probably end up in prison for insider trading.	St
1.2.2	I'd buy what is &quot;good&quot; right now (Core 2 Duo or better).	St
1.2.3	My history with upgrading is that by the time I really need to upgrade the CPU, there have been so many new developments with motherboard chipsets and other integrated hardware that a motherboard upgrade is also desirable.	St
1.2.4	As of today, Intel already has a handful of CPUs that are faster than the E6600.	St
1.3.1	The future.....got to wait 'til we get there and buy what's best then.	St
1.3.2	If you buy selectively ...you could buy a MB which takes a C2D and later a Quad Core CPU if it's the best buy for your needs.	Sug
1.3.3	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	What is the main reason for the upgrade being done really soon?	St
1.4.2	I'd note that my socket 939 system is pretty good with an FX-60 processor that just a year ago was considered one of the best processors.	St
1.4.3	If one wants to think a few years down the line, neither Core 2 Duo or AM2 will be the best but they may be fine for some users that don't want to play games on 30&quot; screens with the highest details spending hundreds of dollars to get top of the line cards every 6 months.	St
1.4.4	AMD will come out with a processor that beats the e6600 if you read up about Barcelona and it shouldn't be hard to see that if you can wait for something better there usually will be something coming soon.	St
1.4.5	The key is what kind of gains are there to be had, what budget do you have and deciding when to do it.	St
1.4.6	Aside from processor upgrades, there will also be DDR3 coming soon that could mark another change to things.	St
1.4.7	There is also the question of when to upgrade to Vista.	St
1.4.8	Regards, JB	St
1.5.1	$300.00 or lower	St
1.6.1	maybe socket F if i save up?	St
1.7.1	nvm	St
1.8.1	NIL	St
