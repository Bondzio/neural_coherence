here is a link to spinrite, a gibson research hdd maintenance & repair software program:  the downloadable program needs to boot your system from a floppy or cd.
if you don't have a floppy drive, you'll need burning software that can create a bootable iso image cd.
spinrite analyzes your hdd (or even floppies) sector by sector, removing and recovering data from a bad sector to a good one, and quarantines the bad sector from future use.
spinrite will also warn you of a failing hdd, hopefully in plenty of time to either save your data or clone your hdd to a new drive.
it will also work on tivo hard drives, although you have to connect the hdd the drive from the tivo to your computer.
the only downside is the price.
$89 for the download, but when compared to the cost, downtime and inconvenience of dealing with a failed hard drive, it's cheap.
if you need to clone your hdd to a new drive, i recommend acronis.
they have a free trial period so you could probably do a quick hit & run to check it out:
