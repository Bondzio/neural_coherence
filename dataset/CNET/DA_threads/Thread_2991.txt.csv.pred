1.1.2	I'm debating if i should order this from the Dell website.	St

1.2.1	The system seems brilliant.	St
1.2.2	Seems as powerful as anything I'd ever imagine anyone would need...The only think I can add to your debate would be...&quot;why pentium D.&quot; Frankly speaking that processor sucks.	St
1.2.3	If you are going Pentium Dual Core spending this much money you shouldnt have a hiccough in you processor.	St
1.2.4	The P-D is 2 P4 pasted together and frankly doesnt show much improvement over HT which is bad enough.	St
1.2.5	I would never go for a Pentium if I was going dual core.	St
1.2.6	I know Dell stays away from AMD but HP doesnt.	St
1.2.7	Their systems can be configured with this and you can get yourself a beautiful X2 4600+ or 4800+ instead.	St
1.2.8	If you HAVE to go for Intel, the Extreme Edition (800 series) with HT gives a little competition to the AMDs... P.S : Check out Dual Core Duel...PDs get whipped by X2 4400+ forget 4800+	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
