first time builders often try to install everything at once.
instead, a test as you go approach is a good idea.
1. motherboard, powersuppply, speaker and cpu+heatsinkfan(hsf) will get you beeps.
the power switch is pushed and it usually beeps.
no beeps and you are looking at the possible misconfigured or bad parts.
2. some system board come with the cmos reset in the reset position.
will not power up either.
