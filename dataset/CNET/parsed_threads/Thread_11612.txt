<s> Hi There! </s>
<s> I am in Canada and buying a new PC. </s>
<s> This is the quote I got from a local PC Builder. </s>
<s> Since I am new to all this, I thought i'd ask all you experts if it was a good deal or not. </s>
<s> Background info first. </s>
<s> I have always had a pentium, Dell because I got the EPP Dell discount throught work. </s>
<s> I use my PC every day for work functions, (word, excel) as well and the internet, download DVD's, music, photos. </s>
<s> My Hubby wants a decent system to play some games but nothing too fancy. </s>
<s> I am looking for upgradability as well as speed. </s>
<s> Right now if I have word and internet up at the same time, system crashes. </s>
<s> Not sure if I should go for Dual core AMD or Pentium (definitely want dual core). </s>
<s> Here is the quote (in Cdn Dollars): System Configuration: Processor - Intel Pentium D930 3.0GHz - 800MHz FSB 4MB Mainboard - Asus P5LD2 S775 i945P Chipset 1066Mhz PCI-Ex16/3+1PCI/4DDR2, w/Sound GB-Lan SATA Raid USB 2.0 Memory - Corsair VS1GBKIT533D2 1GB Kit 2x512MB DDR2 533Mhz Floppy - Peri Power 32-In-1 Memory Card Reader w/2xUSB,1x1394 Black CDRW drive - LG GSA-4167BB/BK 16x16 DL DVDRW w/Software Hard drive - WD WD2500KS 250GB 16MB SATA II Video card - eVGA E-GEFORCE 7600GT 256M DDR PCI-E (256-P2-N553-AX) Sound card - Sound Blaster Audigy 2 ZS 7.1 (OEM) Network card - Marvell 88E8053 PCI-E Gb LAN controller Modem card - Acer Rockwell 56k v92 PCI Modem Casing - Sonata II 17'' Black ATX w/450W PS (8xbays) Monitor - LG 19'' L1932TX-BF 1280x1024 1400:1 4MS BK DVI LCD Keyboard/Mouse - Logitech Cordless Desktop S510 Media Remote KB & Mouse Combo Speakers - Creative Inspire 5.1 P5800 5 Speakers w/subwoofer Software - Windows XP Media Center 2005 Edition OEM (cd,manual & license) Printer - Lexmark X3350 - Multifunction ( color ) - ink-jet - copying (up to): 15 ppm (mono) / 9 ppm (color) - printing (up to): 22 ppm (mono) / 15 ppm (color) - 100 sheets - USB Other - MS Office 2003 Basic Edition (Word, Excel Outlook) Other - AP System Installation Service and AP Standard System Manufacture Warranty (1 Yr Parts & 3 Yrs Service) $2321 plus tax. </s>
<s> Is this good, bad, overkill for our needs? </s>
<s> Any components you'd swap for others? </s>
<s> Thanks so much for all who chose to reply. </s>
<s> I am very grateful! </s>

<s> Forgot to add that I can replace the CPU with: $339 Athlon 64 X2 3800+ Dual Core 1000HT 512KBx2 (take $50 off the price) or Athlon 64 X2 4200+ Dual Core 1000HT 512KBx2 (add $26 to the price). </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>

<s> Only suggesttion I have is adding a second hard disk drive for fast system backup and restores (should that become necessary). </s>
<s> Just assures you can get back up and running quicker if the primary hard disk dies or becomes corrupt. </s>

<s> ...and change the RAM to DDR; AMD's don't support DDR2 yet. </s>
<s> You'll also need to change the motherboard to an AMD board. </s>
<s> Other than that, it looks good, and it's a good price for a complete computer with Windows, a monitor, and even a printer. </s>
<s> That price looks pretty standard for the configuration that you are running. </s>
<s> In regards to AMD vs. Intel, the way the 3 processors that you are looking at would be rated overall, imo, would be the X2 4200 then X2 3800 and then the D930. </s>
<s> However, if you plan on getting this system upgraded, I would suggest going with intel dispite it being the slower processor because the current AMD chips are reachign the end of their lifespan. </s>
<s> but if you're willing/able to wait a few months...you could have more choices .. the new AMD CPUs based on the socket AM2 and DDR2 plus a slightly longer upgrade window. </s>
<s> Good Luck on your choice. </s>
