1.1.1	Hello experts, I have a dell dimension XPS T850r desktop (ATX casing, PIII, 887Mhz,760MB RAM, WinXP).	St
1.1.2	It is very slow machine now, and I was trying decide between upgrading it or buying a new one... since my budget is around $200.	St
1.1.3	IfI bought a new motherbaord, RAM and processor, will the new motherboard fit in the current casing or will there be any misalignment?	St
1.1.4	Which motherboard should I buy?	St
1.1.5	I highly appreciate any advice!	Polite
1.1.6	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	use the PC for ???	St
1.2.2	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	The current hard drive is 300 GB.	St
1.3.2	The PC is for general purpose, e.g.	St
1.3.3	browsing internet, data storage/backup, little bit of Photoshop and word processing.	St
1.3.4	Also, since it is connected to the internet thru LAN cable and not wireless, I use it to download large files, etc.	St
1.4.1	This is your manual http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dkub/techovu.htm#system_board_jumpers I don't see any extensions on the mother board it looks like a pretty straight forward ATX mother board.	St
1.4.2	You might want to write down it dimensions before you go shopping.	St
1.4.3	Just some general recommendations....get the most universal socket you can find so lots of processors fit it and try to find a board that also can run as many CPUs as possible for your $$$$.	St
1.4.4	If you up date the MB then you'll most likely have to set your own Bios.	St
1.4.5	Keep this in mind.	St
1.4.6	I wouldn't spend much on it.	St
1.4.7	A new systems about $700.00 that's Vista ready and has a dual core.	St
1.4.8	If you shop hard you might get one for even less.	St
1.4.9	There seem to be lots of deals around for mini towers right now, maybe somethings up?	St
1.4.10	Anyone heard anything?	St
1.5.1	proprietary and do not accept 'clone or standard AT and ATX' peripherals.	St
1.5.2	So bottomline, if you're going to upgrade, don't plan on reusing the Dell case and PSU.	St
1.5.3	I'd optimize and try using the existing system until you save the $$ to buy or build a new one.	St
1.5.4	Good Luck.	St
1.5.5	VAPCMD	St
