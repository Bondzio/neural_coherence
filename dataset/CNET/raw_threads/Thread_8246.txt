The monitor is blank and the pc just beeps for about 5 seconds, pause, beeps for 5 seconds, pause and etc. There is no short/long beeps, just one standard beep. I tried pressing the F keys to no avail. I noticed the power supply fan was not working and replaced the power supply. I also replaced the RAM, since I was planning to upgrade. Again, the same beep with nothing on the monitor (no signal). I took out the RAM and made sure the new RAMS were seated properly to no avail. I tried to ensure no dust inside and it looks clean inside. I put back the old RAM, just in case the new RAM were incompatible, again to no avail. I took out the video card and RAM and started up the PC, but only get the same beep. Since I did notice the power supply fan was not working, but the CPU fan was working. Nonetheless, is it possible the CPU or motherboard is fried? Any help greatly appreciated, as I'm a novice. Here's the original specs: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&docname=bph07045#N751

Since, you know the beep sequence then find the bios maker and allow it to tell you. Because, your system is constant and you'll noted the cpu working but not the PSU, then its either a bad PSU(test it) or the mtrbd. to include the cpu itself. Now, it really appears like a total failure, IMHO. Google for the bios error code for beeps. tada -----Willy

The power supply was broken (fan wouldn't work), so the power supply did need replacing. However, I was also upgrading the RAM and it appears the new RAM cards (I have two of them) are incompatible. I tested each one and it gave the same beep. I replaced with the old RAM and my PC is working. I did this earlier, but I must not have seated it properly, as I put one old card back in at a time and now it's working again. I'll try to return or exchange the RAM card, if possible. Thank you for your feedback.
