after testing every part on it.. swapping every possible combination ive given up and bashed the case against the wall and floor.
its completely trashed now and i've wasted 1500 bucks.
i've given up.
i have way too much bad stuff going on in my life and i refuse to let this thing bother me anymore.
eventually i'll have it paid off and then i'll buy another pc from dell or somewhere.
i've discovered that god hates me and i have no desire to trick myself into thinking the something positive will ever happen.
