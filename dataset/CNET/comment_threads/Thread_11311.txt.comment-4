Windows doesn't offer a system to route sound from an application to a specific card.
If it did, this would have made for some very interesting applications of the PC today.
Since you don't run Linux, then it becomes a costly endeavor with cards or devices like http://www.protools.com/products/digi002/systems/002hw.cfm and software to match.
