1.1.1	I own a emachine W3107 AMD Sempron processor 3100+ IE 7 Windows XP 32b 1.80 Ghz,1600 Mhz,256 KB L2 Cache,512 DDR-SDRAM,With a DSL modem I've been looking at an add on dual core processor upgrade.The cost is $75.00 Are these add on processors good,bad or otherwise.	St
1.2.1	The machine I found does not support dual core CPUs.	St
1.2.2	You'll have to supply a link to the product for me to change my mind.	St
1.3.1	Support emachine link: http://www.e4me.com/support/product_support.html?cat=Desktops&subcat=W-Series&model=W3107 It doesn't show info on a dual-core upgrade.	St
1.3.2	Follow the upgrade link and see if it does, but I thought it.	St
1.3.3	As an AMD cpu and socket provided.	St
1.3.4	good luck -----Willy &quot;0	Polite
1.4.1	I found it the other day on Amazon.com.The ad said turn your single core computer into a dual core computer.Handle twice the workload.It's half the size of a normal processor.	St
1.5.1	I can only *assume* you're talking about a &quot;overdrive kit&quot; type of thing.	St
1.5.2	I don't recall such an item, it's probably cheaper(maybe) to get a new mtrbd.	St
1.5.3	that truly supports dual-core cpu and go from there.	St
1.5.4	That way, you'll have a greater range of upgrades as its needed.	St
1.5.5	If you can provide that Amazon link, review it again and match it against your current system specs.	St
1.5.6	Otherwise, its a dead-end for dual path, only a single core will do.	St
1.5.7	Using the link I provided in the last, find the upgrade link and post a question to eMachine support and see what they may suggest.	St
1.5.8	Heck, it doesn't hurt to ask.	St
1.5.9	tada -----Willy	St
1.6.1	Just go to amazon and write in processors.They should come right up.	Sug
1.7.1	You can't put in another processor and hope it will work.	St
1.7.2	Please be very specific as to what kit you are looking at.	St
1.7.3	That is, a link.	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	Send me an adress and i'll send you the paga.	St
1.9.1	Then all can comment.	St
