there are also good hp deals.
i've had good experience with emachines and hp.
but gateway owns emachines so its probably good too.
you could always build your own computer?
other brands to consider include monarch, overdrive, hypersonic, voodoo, falcon northwest, and alienware, but all of these are expensive.
some cheaper manufacturers, with some positive and many negative reviews include cyberpower, ibuypower, and elite.
there are also many smallers brands which i would not advocate buying from.
