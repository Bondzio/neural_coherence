tech support is ok. wireless performance is the same as competing products from linksys & netgear.
general experience is good.
the part that won me over was the detailed firewall logs.
it was also nice to have some basic cable/ ping test utilities built in.
linksys & netgear products have one advantage - wireless mac address filtering.
dlink has mac address filtering, but you can not specifically control access for wlan clients.
also, netgear appears to be the only brand that offers 256-bit wep security in their routers.
always remember to implement some form of wireless security.
it is a necessary pain/ evil.
