I know doubling would be suitable so what is best...get a single 256MB module, or can I slap another 128 module in the other slot?

What works fairly well is to get another stick of what you have if you can't identify the machine or if some homebrew, the make/model of the motherboard. Bob

It's too bad you didn't reveal the make and model number since such may not be one of the BX or i8xx chipsets that I know to proceed with care. Easy out? Use Crucial at http://www.crucial.com Bob
