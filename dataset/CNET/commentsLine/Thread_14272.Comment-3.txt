thanks, sorry i wasn't specific enough, i don't want to increase my virtual memory, i just want a flash drive to store music files and data files, but my concern is if the ready boost feature takes up a significant amount of space on the flash drive because i want all the space i can get for other files.
so i just wanted to know if those features could be taken out or any comparability issues i may run into..but by your post, i suppose just reformatting the flash drive will take care of any extras.....
