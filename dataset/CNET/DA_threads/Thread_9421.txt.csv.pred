1.1.1	I have a 2003 Small Business Server .	St
1.1.2	Just last week I had 37G total , 19G free .	St
1.1.3	A few days ago , I had 403 M free .	St
1.1.4	When I check the disk usage total it shows the builtin/administrators account using 35G , but I ca n't figure out what processes could be using it .	St
1.1.5	The shadow copy service had been running , and that was using 3G , once I disabled it I got it back , but the next day my storage was used up again .	St
1.1.6	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.2.1	Wow is my first reaction .	St
1.2.2	My second is WOW again !	St
1.2.3	I do n't think I have ever ran across that but having said that , my guess is a virus can be the cause .	St
1.2.4	You did not mention what type of files are taking up your disk space ?	Ques
1.2.5	Also , are you able to remove them ?	Ques
1.2.6	I would check the & quot ; Services & quot ; file under Administrative Tools very closely and determine any suspicious entries .	St
1.2.7	It took half a day to help fix a friends laptop that was saturated with trojans , spyware , uname it and I found several entries in the Services file .	St
1.2.8	These hackers set the recovery of their programs to 4977 times to restart ! !	St
1.2.9	!	St
1.3.1	Exactly what folder is the data being held in ?	Ques
1.3.2	It does sound like an infection , since that account is the only account that a quota ca n't be used to keep in check .	St
1.3.3	*************************************************** BTW Shadow Copy = Good .	St
1.3.4	Do n't turn it off .	St
1.3.5	Leverage its capabilities .	St
1.3.6	Just my opinion .	St
