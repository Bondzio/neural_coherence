I suggest getting an amd, because even with ddr2, the onboard memory controller, hypertransport with dual-channel ddr pc3200 memory will still beat intel with its ddr2.
Keep in mind nothing's future proof, amd already has new socket M2 on the drawing boards.
As for multitasking, depends on how intense that is, if its not very like, just microsoft office and winamp or w/e, then amd will work.
