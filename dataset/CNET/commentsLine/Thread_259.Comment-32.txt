i know its late, west coast 0115 - and i am not on till noonish, but you asked 'what was a usb drive' do you know if you have a usb connection on your pc ?
if so you would need an external hard drive with a usb port so you could plug the two together.
that last reply '' do u still have the dell resource cd '' from chrisfst it might be a good idea to go to; control panel/system/hardware/device manager and go to the 'cd/dvd rom drives' double click on the that, then the 'drivers' tab - at the end click the button 'uninstall' then restart.
this should create a new device notice and you can load your drivers as fresh from the dell cd.
it should work.
if not - let us know and we can go thru the save etc.
