ATI3DUAG.dll is part of your video driver library, get the latest drivers or at least reload the current video drivers.
It appears that error is known, so google for other corrective actions if so warranted.
Also, if your video ram gets too hot, that too can be at fault, as a weak ram chip peteers out, so swap if possible or try another video card.
