<s> Firstly thanks for taking the time to read this... </s>
<s> Scenario: a) press power button - computer starts and works perfectly b) press power button - computer doesn't even post bios. </s>
<s> The mobo is powered, and the fans start, but no usb power/vga output etc. </s>
<s> I have both a) and b) happening on a whim at the moment. </s>
<s> For example, got back from work. </s>
<s> Pressed power on, and nothing. </s>
<s> Switched off, jiggled cables, unplugged hard disk, unplugged dvdrom, changed psu power cable, changed a 12V psu cable (it's modular). </s>
<s> Turned psu on and off and tried restarting 10 to 20 times, and still no bios post / nothing but fan noise. </s>
<s> Walk away for an hour come back and try it....and it's working. </s>
<s> How is that possible. </s>
<s> However when it does start...i get a bios post of verclock settings...blah blah incorrect..press f2 to reset. </s>
<s> (syntax is correct there is a missing O, as i presume it means overclock on bios post output??!) </s>
<s> But I don't have any overclock settings, considering after the first time this faulted I pressed f2, went into bios and loaded all defaults. </s>
<s> I think this started after transporting my desktop on a long journey the other day. </s>
<s> I have an asus p5-b deluxe, and i've watercooled the cpu and graphics card. </s>
<s> Could it be a CMOS battery issue? </s>
<s> The computer had been dormant for a few years before I started using it last weekend. </s>
<s> So what can make a computer this binary! </s>
<s> Did you measure the bios battery voltage or put in a new one? </s>
<s> The p5-b is getting old. </s>
<s> Inspect for bad caps and swap if you see the battery didn't help. </s>
