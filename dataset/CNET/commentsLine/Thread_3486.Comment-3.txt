i know its just a print server, but are there any driver hacks or something that will make it possible to do this without buying more equipment?
and i'm just an average high school student, my freinds are not geeks, and like most typical american families, they throw away a computer if they get a new one, so most likely no one has any.
i have no job, due to age, and i'm not really interested in spending money for a media server.
i guess i can continue lugging around the enclosure -_-.
