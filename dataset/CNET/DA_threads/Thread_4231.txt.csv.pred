1.3.5	will actually be used .	St
1.3.6	If your system is capable install win7 64bit as better solution .	St
1.3.7	Also , your system may need a bios update to handle such ram if not already installed .	St
1.3.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	The issue of less than 4GB is widely discussed .	St
1.4.2	To curb the phonecalls Microsoft changed the reported RAM to include all installed RAM but as you research this you find the same old 32 bit limits are still their .	St
1.4.3	Beyond that , apps are still limited to 2GB with one rare exception .	St
1.4.4	While interesting I 'd skip any 32 bit Windows today .	St
