I'm looking at the Asus 1101 Netbook.
I really like the larger screen, 11.6&quot; compared to the 10&quot; screens on the other netbooks.
The only issue is that the processor is 1.3 ghz while most of 10&quot; netbooks have a 1.6 ghz processor.
I'm only using the netbook for internet and emails when I travel.
Any thoughts?
Is the processor too slow for what I want?
Also, the Asus 1101 has Windows XP.
Some of the 10&quot; netbooks have Windows 7 Starter.
I am I better off with the newer OS?
