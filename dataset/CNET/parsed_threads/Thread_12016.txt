<s> I am having trouble picking an iMac. </s>
<s> What is the difference in speed running programs like Photoshop CS3, Flash and Corel Painter on the iMac with the 3.06GHz Intel Duo Processor and the iMac one step below? </s>
<s> 2nd, what graphic card should i chose? </s>
<s> the NIVDIA GeForce 8800 or the ATI Radeon? </s>
<s> Which would be best for these programs and minor gaming? </s>
<s> Any help (AND LINKS) you could provide would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> The change is nearly linear. </s>
<s> From 3 to 2.8GHz you use straight division. </s>
<s> Reading http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/reviews/4258725.html?page=2 I can see why you like this machine. </s>
<s> Just look at the sub 30 second startup. </s>
<s> Look at the Photoshop benchmark. </s>
<s> You'll do fine. </s>

<s> The link was helpful. </s>
<s> What graphic card do you recommend? </s>
<s> I looked at the apple.com site and can't see where you can change the video system. </s>
<s> The 24&quot; model does give you a choice. </s>
<s> That's strictly a choice of more 3D performance. </s>
<s> I'm sure someone has benchmarks but it's likely to show up as games or FPS rather than any payback for Photoshop or video editing. </s>
