<s> I have to catch throughtput when recovering from some packet lose. </s>
<s> that`s supposed to be done on various TCP types (TCP Reno, TCP NewReno, TCP Tahoe, TCP Westwood etc..). </s>
<s> I`ve been serching a lot but to no avail. </s>
<s> CAN ANYBODY HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE WITH THAT? </s>
<s> PLEASE Thank you, Radim </s>
<s> The best thing to do: talk with your professor about it. </s>

<s> I'm guessing this is not what you meant to write. </s>
<s> But thesis work is something you choose then work with your prof or adviser when you get stuck. </s>
<s> But I must comment here that I've seen such before. </s>
<s> That is, the person sometimes thinks that such a study or data is on the web. </s>
<s> Or they are trying to avoid setting up a lab to do the work. </s>
<s> The lab setup seems to be the most common issue I see. </s>
<s> It's really a lot of fun to set it up and then create the software to simulate, capture and more. </s>
