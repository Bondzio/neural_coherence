They would both be the same size (19 inch), but I wanted to see what people think the pros/cons would be of getting one vs the other. I assume they would be able to achieve roughly the same resolution and performance as a computer monitor, and if I got an HD tuner for my computer, they might be similar as TVs too. Would there be any difference in expected life or other factors? Thanks.
