<s> what type of radio has an output besides to the speakers? </s>
<s> Searching advanced features in New Egg, I found a menu option for ''FM Tuner Yes/no''. </s>
<s> Also in http://www.ati.com/products/radeonx800/aiwx800xt/index.html there is the comment: ''All-in-Wonder X800 XT is the first video card to feature DVI-I and VGA monitor connectivity plus a TV and FM Radio tuner in a single slot device''. </s>
<s> It seems that it could collect FM signals from an attached antenna and send them (music) to the sound card for listening or to the CD for saving ??? </s>

<s> nothing illegal here in this. </s>
<s> The standard FM band is located between TV channel 6 and Channel 7,, that's what divides the &quot;low&quot; band channels and the &quot;high&quot; band [not UHF] channels. </s>
<s> Thus a continuous TV tuner will be able to tune in the FM Band. </s>
<s> Only addressing the tuning issue, not how the sound gets processed. </s>
<s> in this thread erroneously addressed to dragon, the standard 88 to 108 MHz FM band is located between TV channel 6 and TV channel 7. </s>
<s> Thus any continuous tuner for the TV bands WILL be able to tune in the FM radio signals. </s>
<s> And for Dmastra, as in any type of radio, the RF signal must be detected and demodulated to get the audio. </s>
<s> The tuner in the ATI performs that function </s>
<s> Appreciate the info. </s>
