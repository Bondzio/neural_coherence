I've recently purchased a BenQ 52X24X52 EXTERNAL CD rewriter, and i'm experiencing some difficulties. I'd really apreciate it if anyone could help me out... here we go: I use win2k pro on a sony vaio laptop computer. The rewriter came with no device drivers of its own, and documentation suggested the use of standard windows drivers, which worked fine... I can burn Cd's just fine, but i cannot select any other burning speed than 4X, even with ultra-speed compatible CD-R's. i went to the company's site for drivers.. all i found was firmware, which didn't fix the problem. Being a novice in CD burning, i'm very frustrated not to be able to use the cdwriter to its full potential. Any help at all would be sincerely apreciated. thanks.

DON'T FIX ANYTHING! Your setup is working properly. A poor soul I ran into noted almost the same as yours and ended up reinstalling the OS trying to fix this. The sad part of the story is it wasn't broken... Bob

In the company's website, they said that the 2.0 usb driver was not needed for win 2k and XP... only for win98... so i think i already have 2.0 in my os.... Is there a way to check? i couldn't find any info in device manager... besides, i forgot to mention that in nero, at one time, i was able to chose only between 4X and 52X writing speed... but i couldn't chose 52 because my CDR's are designed for 48 max... anyways this soon was over because i couldn't chose anymore, it was back to 4X only! i'm goin NUTS!!! what's goin on!? oh and another problem, i cant format my CDRW with incd, it won't read... maybe smashing the thing against a walll would do the trick.... no? :(please help!
