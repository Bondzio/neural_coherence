if you want to go cheap, look for a used hd.
ebay, amazon, overstock auctions, even possibly a refurbished one.
i've bought a few to put in older pc's to sell.
there are always (of course) risks, to buying used.
i would probably just look for a deal on a new 40+gb.
that way you can always re-use it when you get a newer pc.
i have no idea why people are bringing up more memory.
your guestion was about your lack of storage, and had nothing to do with memory.
368mb is more than adequate for what you are doing, and is probably all you can use in a pentium 3, (some p3's won't allow more than 256mb).
from your question, it sounds like the simple solution is to increase your storage, and worry about a new computer later.
