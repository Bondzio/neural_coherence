Thank you Ramarc.
Of all the replies I have had on different forums regarding this subject, yours is the best and most practical of them all and the HIS 2600Pro card you suggested seems like it offers everything I need for a lot less money than the others.
I have a couple more questions though please.
1 - I assume the HIS 2600Pro wont put any power consumption strains on my PSU and also wont require an additional PSU connection directly to the card?
2 - I don't see moir patterns, 'waviness', or ghosting from the Dell running on the VGA connection, the issue is only a slightly lower level of sharpness.
This may or may not be improved from changing over to a DVI connection on that monitor, I guess that remains to be seen, but from what I read on another forum the sharpness issue may actually be related directly to the DPI rating of the monitor itself.
I havent compared the DPI rating specs between the Apple and the Dell as of yet, but do you think this might be the root of the issue?
3 The extra RAM, by going from a 128MB card to a 512Mb card, I understand will reduce the strain on the 2GB of system RAM I have since Photoshop is a RAM intensive program.
Dont you think?
