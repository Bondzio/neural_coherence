1.1.1	I Have a hardwired local area network .	St
1.1.2	It consest of modem to rounter to switch to another switch .	St
1.1.3	My wife got a new laptop with wireless card .	St
1.1.4	She wants a wireless conection .	St
1.1.5	How can I come off of my switch to turn one port into wireless ?	Ques
1.1.6	I looked for a wireless switch can find nothing but commercial stuff .	St
1.1.7	I was under the impression that if you added a router it would confuse the other router up stream or vise versa .	St
1.1.8	ANY IDEAS WOULD BE GREAT ! !	St
1.1.9	THANKS	St
1.2.1	Use any of the common consumer broadband routers with wireless - your choice of brand .	St
1.2.2	I wo n't start a row here over which brand and model is best , you can research that easily enough .	St
1.2.3	When you get one , just substitute it for your existing wired router .	St
1.2.4	Be aware that nearly all the wireless routers in fact have the usual complement of four wired ethernet ports on the back too , so it will be a one-for-one swap of devices with your current router .	St
1.2.5	First you 'll need to configure it for your particular ISP service , and then SECURE IT .	St
1.2.6	Securing your router is important , but often ignored .	St
1.2.7	dw	St
1.3.1	1. add a Wireless Access Point ( WAP ) to your current setup .	St
1.3.2	2. replace the old router with a wireless broadband router .	St
1.3.3	I prefer replacing the old router with a wireless router .	St
1.3.4	Makes life simpler and often is less expensive than a WAP .	St
1.3.5	Look at your local computer stores , electronics stores , and office supply stores for the major small office/home office brands ( Linksys , D-Link , Netgear , Belkin ) .	St
1.4.1	I meant to write that you have TWO OPTIONS : 1 .	St
1.4.2	Add the WAP to your current setup .	St
1.4.3	- OR - 2 .	St
1.4.4	Replace the old router with a wireless broadband router .	St
1.5.1	Ok..I see what your saying .	St
1.5.2	I think I will just at the Wireless point .	St
1.5.3	I know this sounds crazy but the network is already sensitive enough , lol , i would rather add downstream .	St
1.5.4	I am on my 2nd router in 3 years and about every 3 or 4 days it seems I have to reboot the router for unknow reasons .	St
1.5.5	I starting to wonder if its my ISP doing that somehow .	St
1.5.6	I know they would rather me pay an extra 10 bucks a month per IP address..	St
1.5.7	ThANKS AGAIN	St
1.6.1	Adding a WAP to an exitsing wired network is common .	St
1.6.2	Many consider it a good idea to use the same brand of hardware to reduce problems and make any tech support calls a one-stop affair .	St
1.6.3	Sensitive network hardware ?	Ques
1.6.4	I have seen such .	St
1.6.5	As to flaky routers and other network hardware , using the latest firmware upgrade usually solves the problem .	St
1.6.6	Spyware infestations have also become a common cause for when good connections go bad .	St
