<s> hello, one day I turned on my monitor and noticed it was flickering and makes everything look a little darker. </s>
<s> It is very annoying. </s>
<s> I can see when I move windows around that it flickers even more. </s>
<s> I know it is not my monitor because i just tried switching it with another and i get the same problem. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> I am running on Windows XP. </s>
<s> Did you recently update XP to SP2? </s>
<s> Hopefully you haven't updated any drivers with Microsoft update. </s>
<s> Try System Restore to rollback to when things were OK. Or download new drivers, if you can ID the video model and MFG, and can fins website, which may have to be the mobo and it's site. </s>
<s> If an Abit mobo, see www.pcstats.com for a class action suit on Abit for bad capacitors onboard. </s>
<s> Look at your capacitors for puffed or leaking. </s>
<s> I have a used $5 cheap 2mb video card hanging around to put in to see if it's the video or mobo. </s>
