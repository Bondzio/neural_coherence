<s> I'm in the market for a high end gaming desktop and was looking around at the Alienware machines and Dell's machines which would run over $4500 for everything I wanted. </s>
<s> I figure I can probably build for cheaper and was looking for suggestions for a $4000 budget. </s>
<s> This would be my first time building, so I'd also like to hear if it's worth it for me to be building such a high end system as a newb. </s>
<s> Thanks, Gautrau </s>
<s> Here's my suggestion. </s>
<s> It's a bit over-budget ($4235) but these prices are ball-park... agressive price-shopping could shave a couple-hundred off. </s>
<s> The Logitech 5450 speakers are $300 but the 5500's are just as good (if not better) and only $200. </s>

<s> ...get the X2 4800+ and save $400 while minimally sacraficing performance. </s>
<s> I personally wouldn't get anything over the X2 3800+. </s>
<s> Get 2 gigs of RAM because 4 is the limit for a 32-bit OS, and XP 64-bit edition is rather buggy. </s>
<s> When Vista comes out, gamers will need 4 gigs of RAM, so get two 1GB sticks and upgrade when it's needed. </s>
<s> Because price is no object, get XMS RAM rahter than ValueSelect. </s>
<s> I've never heard of ePOWER before, so I'd get an Enermax: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817194004 If the power supply goes, the system goes, so you don't want to skimp on that to save money. </s>
<s> Also, save money by getting a 300GB hard drive. </s>
<s> Just my thoughts </s>
<s> With a good coolor (like arctic cooling's freezer 64 pro) you should easily be able to OC it to 2.5/2.6 ghz and it will be just a smidge slower than a fx60. </s>
<s> (check out the forums at overclockers.net, xbitlabs, anandtech, etc. </s>
<s> to get OC tips for this mobo/cpu.) </s>
<s> Don't cheap out and get VS RAM. </s>
<s> Cut back to 2GB and get DDR-500 RAM (g.skill extreme is on sale now at $157 for 2gb). </s>
<s> 2GB is more than enough for any of today's games, and you can always add more in the future when the price goes down. </s>
<s> With these suggestions, you've saved $600 so why not move up to a widescreen monitor. </s>
<s> 20&quot; WS's are about $100 more than the 19&quot; Samsung. </s>
