i'd pay them a visit, give them your needs, and let them put together a pc for you.
they can provide oem versions of many software applications at a decent price and you get all the disks.
much really depends on the level of support you need after the purchase.
a local builder will provide warranty and hardware support but will be limited when it comes to software.
oem versions of software don't usually allow phone calls to their support personnel but so much is available on line today that it's not that important any more.
