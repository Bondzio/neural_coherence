<s> Hi, I have a Win XP SP2 with 2 Ethernet Cards (1 with motherboard and 1 seperately installed). </s>
<s> I have 2 internet connections 256 kbps each connection hooked to the computer via ethernet cards (no router is used). </s>
<s> Both connections are from 2 different ISP - 1 having dynamic IP while the other having a static IP. </s>
<s> I would like to combine both the connections into 1 (512 kbps conenction -- not balance them) and the output connection should be using the static IP. </s>
<s> How can I go about doing this? </s>
<s> System config: AMD 3000+ with 512 MB RAM Two 100/10 Ethernet Cards (1 inbuilt in motherboad while other is seperately installed) Win XP SP2. </s>
<s> Any help provided would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank You </s>
<s> Just to add, each of these connections have their respective logins without which they will not work. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Windows has no concept of ECMP (Equal cost multi path) routing. </s>
<s> Using 2 different ISPs is also a bad choice. </s>
<s> This typically requires using BGP and obtaining an Autonomous System number. </s>
<s> You would be better off dumping one ISP and upgrading the other. </s>
<s> SKrall </s>
<s> That is sad. </s>
<s> Now if that is not possible, can I do load balancing so that I constantly get 256kbps connection or I cant even do that? </s>
<s> Regards, Hiren Mehta </s>
<s> I came across this post right now because I am trying to do some load balancing too. </s>
<s> Until now I have found that you can do a load balancing with a built-in load balance router. </s>
<s> To my opinion microtic OS router would be a good choice </s>
