i can't even create a new sub folder i get error 0x80070052, the folder structure is that i have the jump drive, then the folder &quot;pictures&quot; then my jpg files, i can create another folder on the main directory but not in the sub folder.
can the folder itself become &quot;full&quot;?
the other oddity is that i can pull the folder off the jump drive and save it onto my external(click and drag) and then still save files to it.
