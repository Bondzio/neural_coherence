i just don't understand why the new monitors are mostly widescreen ones.
i can see that if you are using the monitor to watch a movie, widescreen would be nice.
but for general home computing; word processing, simple spreadsheet, internet surfing, email, etc.
is the widescreen format of any benefit at all?
i happen to enjoy using my screensaver function to display our vacation photos.
if i purchase a widescreen monitor will my photos be stretched such that people all look short and fat?
or will the photos appear in normal dimensions?
thanx for any info.
