hey earl, thanks for the response.
unfortunately that's not good enough for me cause i work as a composer, so having a wireless system that causes any stuttering is really bad.
for the time being i'm still on my G adapter and just hoping that the N router has been helping with the connection however it can.
maybe not by being N but being more up-to-date maybe it has better range.
then for those moments when i'm really stuck with say an FTP upload i use my cheap D-Link N adapter.
this is not ideal though but hey better than drilling holes in my house for wiring.
