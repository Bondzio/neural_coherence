Hey all - Simple question: Looking for a network storage device that can act as a central data area for multiple (heavy home use) computers. I.e store all the digital pictures, etc. Plus be able to backup the area easily. I see everything from $100 to $1000, but I just want to make sure it's easy and dependable. Help! Thanks!

That is a system that prevents data loss from virus or simply pressing the delete key. Also, most are hard disk based which causes them to have some number of years till the drives fail. http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7590-0.html?forumID=67&threadID=28919&messageID=328179 is a testament to this issue. -&gt; Yes I use a NAS, but I also have a backup system to add reliability.
