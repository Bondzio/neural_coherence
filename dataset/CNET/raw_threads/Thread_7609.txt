So I have a shared Laser jet 2600n printer on XP based computer, but when I try to connect my Vista based laptop, it gives this error : &quot;Windows cannot connect to printer. the local spooler service is not running. Please restart the spooler or restart the machine&quot;. I dont know even what is spooler. Thank you for your help

It's about the same printer. If it doesn't help, try the many other ways I found in: http://www.vistax64.com/vista-networking-sharing/16978-spooler-error-windows-cannot-connect-shared-printer-xp-pro.html http://forums.microsoft.com/TechNet/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1275803&SiteID=17 http://www.vistax64.com/vista-installation-setup/106482-need-help-problem-adding-printer.html Many different ways, and they worked with some and not with others. It's unclear, to say the least. Hope this helps. Kees
