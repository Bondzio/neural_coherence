i have, but the bsod are to random and frequent to be accurate, it gets through with no errors til it bsod, but its always at different times.
and like i said i tested with another pair of memory sticks out of a working stable computer, and upped the voltage (2.0v) along with tinkering and timings, even lowered spped to 667mhz with both pairs, bsod seemed to happening just as frequent.
and no nothing is overclocked
