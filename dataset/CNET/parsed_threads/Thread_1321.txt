<s> I took a hard drive (Western Digital 40 GIG) from my Win98se machine, placed it into a USB 2.0 hard drive (from COMPUSA) enclosure and hooked it up to my XP laptop. </s>
<s> The Xp laptop does not recogize the drive. </s>
<s> It does not show up in &quot;My Computer&quot;. </s>
<s> It shows up in the Computer management/disk management window as a disk with no Volume (e.g. </s>
<s> C:, D:, etc), a blank file system, and 100% free space (although I know there is at least 15G info on the drive). </s>
<s> When I right click on the drive, the only option I'm given is to ''delete the partition''. </s>
<s> Since this will delete the data on the machine, it is not an option. </s>
<s> It appears that the XP machine can see the drive but cannot read or recognize the files. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> That sometimes works, sometimes not. </s>
<s> Also, this can happen if the port is all of USB 1.1. </s>
<s> I've run into this too many times to count and know to use the USB 2.0 ports, cables and such. </s>
<s> Try this. </s>
<s> Boot KNOPPIX and see if it sees the drive contents. </s>

<s> Bob, Not sure what ''that's not a supported method'' means. </s>
<s> Also where can I obtain the KNOPPIX you refer to? </s>
<s> Thanks, Mike </s>
<s> It means that it may not work and no maker of OS or hardware will tell you it works (if they have been at this game long.) </s>
<s> About KNOPPIX. </s>
<s> Please try google.com. </s>
<s> I'd rather not duplicate web content when and where I can. </s>
