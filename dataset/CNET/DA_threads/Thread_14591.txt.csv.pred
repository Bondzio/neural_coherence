1.1.1	I 'm setting up a home office and I 've been doing some research on finding the perfect MFP for my needs .	St
1.1.2	I do mostly B/W printing ( 200 pages/week ) with just text , but I do print about 100 color prints a week that have minimal coverage and contain mostly text with a couple simple graphics .	St
1.1.3	I want a MFP for fax and scanning/copying and I want to be able to scan straight to my PC .	St
1.1.4	Right now I 'm leaning towards the Xerox 6180mfp .	St
1.1.5	I 'm looking to spend between $ 700- $ 1000 after taxes and shipping and this falls in that range and appears to do everything I need .	St
1.1.6	My only concern is that some people have mentioned some concern about the job life of the toner and that it is kind of pricy to replace .	St
1.1.7	Not sure if that would affect me since I 'm not utilizing the color all that much .	Res
1.1.8	Any other printers that are comparable I should look at or any feedback on the 6180 .	St
1.1.9	Thanks for reading .	St

1.2.1	Maybe you should look at two printers ?	Ques
1.2.2	1 .	St
1.2.3	A b/w laser AIO .	St
1.2.4	This will cover all your faxing , scanning , copying needs .	St
1.2.5	I like Brother personally .	St
1.2.6	Good high capacity cartridges ( find one that takes the TN580 , like the MFC-8460 or 8860 ) ) 2 .	St
1.2.7	Get a color inkjet printer for the few pages of color you need .	St
1.2.8	HP has some good ones , but look for printers that take the 74/75 or 96/97 , as those you can refill yourself , if you want , get replacements on the web or at local stores .	St
1.2.9	This way if one of them fails , you still have a back up printer .	St
1.2.10	Plus it can save you some money .	St
1.3.1	I 'm doing essentially the same search , though my needs will be less color-intensive .	St
1.3.2	The Brother 9840 has an astonishingly high percentage of happy users ( 18 out of 19 5-stars - at Amazon , I think . )	St
1.3.3	I did find one review at Government Computer News that suggested the layout of the physical plant leads to accidental popping open of the paper tray door , which would drive me crazy .	St
1.3.4	The same review gave top marks to the Okidata 5550 , which has the advantage of having a straight paper path ; however I ca n't find any user reviews on this unit .	St
1.3.5	Maybe somebody will give you some more input .	St
1.3.6	The one caveat I have run across for the Xerox units is that since they use solid ink , 1 ) it smells like melted crayons while they 're running , and 2 ) if color prints get folded , the & quot ; ink & quot ; flakes off .	St
1.4.1	I purchased the Brothers MFC-8860DN brand new for $ 437 with no tax and free 3 day shipping through PCNation.com .	St
1.4.2	My girlfriend 's color printer might work for me or I 'll go spend $ 100- $ 200 on one .	St
1.4.3	Thanks for the input .	St
