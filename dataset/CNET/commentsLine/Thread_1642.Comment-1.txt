i have had my hp computer for a while now and have decided it is undoubtedly time to upgrade.
i know i can't get much for a price range of strictly $500-$700, but can someone help me out?
i need to know what is the best computer i can get in terms of hd memory, ram, video, and basically just overall stats.
thanks in advance
