So I just bought a 4GB Sony Memory Stick PRO Duo for my cell, and it came with an adapter, so I can plug it into my laptop. However, every time I do, I get a lovely blue screen and a free restart. When I put the 256MB SanDisk that came with the phone in the adapter, it works fine. What's the deal? Any way to fix it? Thanks!

After some investigation I've determined this stick is a counterfeit, and a very good one at that. There is a guide here which explains the counterfeit chips: http://reviews.ebay.com/FAKE-Sony-Memory-Stick-Pro-Duo-MagicGate-Cards-Exposed_W0QQugidZ10000000001236041?ssPageName=BUYGD:CAT:-1:LISTINGS:2 I purchased mine on ebay so I'm going through the process of getting a full refund from the seller.
