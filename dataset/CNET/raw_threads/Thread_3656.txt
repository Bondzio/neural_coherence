3466	0	55137	657060	NR	XelNaga	1/4/05 6:52 PM	1.10486472E12	DVD MEDIA HELP PLEASE!!	I own a dvd burner with 4x burning on dvd+/-r media and 2.4x on dvd+/-rw. I recently bought some 8x dvd+r media from memorex and I have a problem. I can only burn at 1x my applications do not let me choose any other speed other than 1x and I've tried multiple applications. I've noticed something different with the dvd media. It says dvd+r but above the letters it has a logo with the letters &quot;rw&quot; in it. It's like a square box with the two letters rw in it. What does this mean? It's obviously dvd+r media because the backside is purplish but it has a rw symbol and my burner can only record at 1x. Can anyone help me out and tell me what this means? I'm so confused!!! I've been burning dvds for a whole year now, I don't get it. How can I fix this problem? HELP PLEASE!! THANK YOU!!!

RW means read and write. RW disks act like a floppy in that you can use them over and over like a floppy.Also they run at a slower recording speed.(the 2.4 or less). there is a free program called DVD info that you can get from a google search that will tell you all kinds of imformation on a disk inserted in your drive. Hope this helps.
