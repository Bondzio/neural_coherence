<s> I just bought a new 120 gig seagate harddrive, (it is the &quot;E:&quot; drive on my machine); and I transferred bunch of .wav and .mp3 files to it from C: drive. </s>
<s> when I play the files back, it's like I'm back in LP record land. </s>
<s> clicks and pops all over. </s>
<s> (the files sound fine when played off the c: drive.) </s>
<s> anyone have any idea what is causing this? </s>
<s> is this a defective drive? </s>
<s> I tried xferring files one at a time, no help - fj </s>
<s> this an 1800 AMD chip system on an MSI mobo running windows 2000. the C: drive is a 30 gb WD drive. </s>
<s> the 120 gb e: drive in question is on the same cable as the C:, cable select jumpers, so it's the primary slave. </s>
<s> has a soundblaster live card, never had any problem with it before. </s>
<s> --fj </s>
<s> well these clicks and pops are all happening at the same time the &quot;hard drive read&quot; light flashes. </s>
<s> is this a dead drive? </s>
<s> I just bought it from tiger direct. </s>
<s> --fj </s>
<s> Double click the controller for drive in Device Manager. </s>
<s> See if it shows under Advanced settings that it is using Ultra DMA 5. </s>
<s> If you forget to change the BIOS and set it to Auto for a new drive it will work, but it will not work at the optimal speed. </s>
<s> in device manager, under IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers, clicking on properties/ advanced I see the c: drive is in ultra DMA mode BUT for the new troublesome drive, the transfer mode says &quot;DMA if available&quot; but the &quot;current transfer mode&quot; says PIO Mode. </s>
<s> -- what the heck is that? </s>
<s> ??? </s>
<s> thanks for your help! </s>
<s> (I think everything was set to auto in the BIOS but I can check again) --fj </s>
<s> seagate support is sending me some diagnostics-- they think it's not the drive, they've never heard of this before. </s>
<s> will try a differnt cable! </s>
<s> - fj </s>
<s> One thing to check is that you don't have an IRQ conflict. </s>
<s> Device manager, system, view by resource connection. </s>
<s> It could be each disk access is causing an interrupt on the same address as the sound card. </s>
<s> Just my thought but I tend to make hard drives masters on each IDE and let the less used devices be secondary. </s>
<s> well I put the drive on the secondary IDE cable and all is fixed. </s>
<s> fyi PIO mode is a really slow mode. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> probably caused by faulty cable. </s>
<s> time to get to microcenter! </s>
<s> - fj </s>
<s> Try buying a new UDMA cable. </s>
<s> They're usually not that expensive. </s>
<s> Search http://www.pricewatch.com for some. </s>
<s> Actually the PIO mode is usually caused by not going into the BIOS and setting the drive to AUTO when you add a new drive to a system. </s>
<s> Are you sure you did this when it was plugged into the other connector? </s>
<s> hmm, no i didn't, but i seem to recall it was set to that anyway when i looked-- is that not the default? </s>
<s> next restart I'll give it a look! </s>
<s> thanks - if that's the fix you'll save me buying a new cable --fj </s>
<s> well I set eveyrhting to auto in the bios and it still came up in PIO mode-- i think it's the cable. </s>
<s> I hope it's not anything on the mobo! </s>
<s> - -fj </s>
