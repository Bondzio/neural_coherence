<s> It started mid November when my computer suddenly wouldn't boot up. </s>
<s> It would look like it was going to and then go to blue screen, then to another screen and then to the initial Microsoft Windows picture, over & over again. </s>
<s> All I can think that happened shortly before that that I had done was try to download a couple photo viewers that were suggested in a couple emails my father had sent me. </s>
<s> I can't seem to figure out if they actually installed onto my computer. </s>
<s> At the same time, I thought, as long as I'm into this process, I should install the CD that came with a 5.0 Polaroid camera (disk has: Photo Express 5.0, Photo Explorer 8.0 and PC-CAM Driver. </s>
<s> Again, not sure if it installed or not. </s>
<s> I then thought I could plug the cord that came with the cameral into the front USB port on my computer (HP Pavilion a600n. </s>
<s> That did nothing. </s>
<s> Then I remembered I could put a SD card into the battery compartment & download pictures that way and forgot about it. </s>
<s> The problem did not arise immediately after any of these things, but not too long after. </s>
<s> My computer is also set for automatic updates, so that is a remote possibility. </s>
<s> Now I can't recall when it first happened. </s>
<s> Whether i was using the computer or when I turned it on. </s>
<s> I tried over and over to turn my computer on and always the same thing. </s>
<s> I ended up with a DOS screen and none of the options there to start the screen worked except the option to take the computer back to out of the box condition, which I didn't want to do, as I'd never get it back to where it was & hadn't backed up my computer for a long time. </s>
<s> I simply didn't even try to use it for at least a week. </s>
<s> Then I tried once more and it booted up fine. </s>
<s> When I went to print something, I realized I had powered off my printer while I wasn't using the computer, so I turned it on and immediately: Blue Screen. </s>
<s> Recently, I've figured out that basically it's anything that connects to my computer via a USB cable that also has its own power cord that causes the problem. </s>
<s> The few USB devices I have that use the computer's power seem to work without causing the boot problem. </s>
<s> My big problem is I can't figure out how to back up the computer at this point since my external hard drive connects via USB & has a power cord, so causes thecomputer to not boot. </s>
<s> Any ideas would be appreciated. </s>
<s> It is one long paragraph so while it would be nice to know the make and model I may have missed it because of that long paragraph. </s>
<s> Let me share a laptop I own had a similar issue. </s>
<s> I cured it by using a powered USB 2.0 HUB inbetween the PC and the drive. </s>
<s> Now it boots up fine. </s>
<s> If you get a random reboot, check your laptop's maker for &quot;motherboard&quot; drivers. </s>

<s> Hi there, I am being driven demented by what appears to be the same problem as you have had and I was wondering if you solved it yourself and if so, how exactly...?!? </s>
<s> here's hoping and thanks a million??? </s>

<s> &quot;check your laptop's maker for &quot;motherboard&quot; drivers.&quot; I deal with a lot of machines. </s>
<s> The issue pops up a lot but sadly many owners can't deal with finding drivers so what are we to do? </s>
