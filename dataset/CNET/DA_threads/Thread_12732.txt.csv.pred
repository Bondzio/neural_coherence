1.1.1	Hello.I am new to this so please bare with me.I just bought a new desktop that has the NVIDIA GeForce 6150 SE Integrated graphics card.It has a open slot for a PCI-E card.Can the integrated card be upgraded ?	Ques
1.1.2	Or will this card work for gaming ?	Ques
1.2.1	You can buy a PCI-Express card and set it as the primary card in the BIOS , so that the PC will prefer the PCI-e card as its video output .	St
1.2.2	A 6150 will & quot ; work & quot ; for gaming , but is not the best choice given the plethora of cheap cards on the market that will easily outperform low-end cards from the past .	St
1.2.3	- Vr/Z.. & gt ; & gt ;	St
1.3.1	THANKS !	St
1.3.2	!	St
1.4.1	power from the PSU .	St
1.4.2	So make sure you check the video card power requirements before making the final purchase .	Sug
1.4.3	Otherwise you might end up forking up another $ 50 to $ 100 for a new Power Supply too .	St
1.4.4	VAPCMD	St
