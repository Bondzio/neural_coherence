first of all... do a system restore.
you don't say which os you are using but let's say it's xp... click start - run - type cmd - ok - this brings up a dos box.
type chkdsk c: /f and hit enter.
it will tell you that you have to do this on a re-boot so hit y and enter - then do a reboot and allow the check to take place before you do anything else.
i'm also guessing that your hard drive is formatted as ntfs.
i assume you have done a good clean up of your hard drive - if not, run ccleaner with all the boxes checked.
also run wise disk cleaner free, run the wizard at start-up and make sure you check the box to remove windows update uninstall files - i've never known anyone need to uninstall a windows update - just to be on the safe side, don't check any of the boxes containing log or txt.
now run the registry cleaner on ccleaner and also (because they all find different stuff) run wise registry cleaner free as well... after the clean, you can then use this program to compress your registry.
you can also download a swap-file defrag program from cnet.
you can be shocked at the gigantic amount of 'stuff' that windows collects - it is usually 100's or megs and has been known to be well over a gig.
now reduce your browser cache size to a max of 50 megs.
if you are running plenty of memory, reduce your swap-file size to 200 megs - or even switch it off if you run 2 gigs or more of memory.
reduce the size of your system restore point space.
if you run norton protection on your recycle bin, reduce the size or switch it off.
lastly... uninstall everything that you don't use - then run all the clean-up programs again and run a full defrag.
please tell us how you get on - we all need feedback.
