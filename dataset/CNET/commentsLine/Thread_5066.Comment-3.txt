crucial ballistix is a line of ram for computer modders (overclockers).
it is pc4000 ram operating at 500mhz and 2.8v.
i seriously doubt that the compaq bios will allow for any significant overclocking, if it allows it at all.
if you are installing it in a compaq presario pc s4020wm , it will clock down to operate at pc2100 speeds (133mhz) because that is the fastest speed the motherboard supports.
all the ram listed at crucial.com for that computer is *compatible* but will only run at the 133mhz speed, so there's no bonus for spending more money on fast ram.
my advice: don't spend extra cash on fast ram for that computer.
just get the inexpensive pc2700 (ddr333) or pc3200 (ddr400) 512mb ram module that has the same voltage as your existing 512mb module and is from a good manufacturer (kingston, crucial, corsair should be fine).
see if this matches your existing ram's voltage.
from time to time, i see rebate special 512mb pc3200 kinston ram for 29.99 (fry's, staples, etc.).
