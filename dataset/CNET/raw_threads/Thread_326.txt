The system keeps telling me that the drive is copy protected on windows XP, and the files on the drive are copy protected and it is read-only files and I should have read help files on how to deal with read-only files on Windows Vista Ultimate. However, I am unable to see if there are any files on the drive nor to open it or use it for anything. I have tried to format it on different computers, different operating systems, and using the C-command, no progress I still got the same response. The formation process was using the Default Allocation , 1024, and quick and normal format. No progress. Help me, I need to reformat it and just reuse it.

Proffitt	6/17/07 5:10 PM	1.1821002E12	Links, comments.	http://www.sandisk.com/Retail/Default.aspx?CatID=1415 as noted by http://kristagrothoff.wordpress.com/2006/08/24/removing-u3-and-associated-bundled-software-from-the-sandisk-cruzer-micro-usb-flash-drive/ is a good read. You need such a tool from your U3 Drive's maker to kick all that out and start over. I did see a Launchpad update at their site so if the drive is loopy, update that and try again. Next? Read http://www.u3.com/uninstall/ Bob

However, the links you have sent to me was just useful, but it was not addressing my problem-although I have tried them. thanks though. could I use a specific partition software besides to DiskKill?
13158	8	252745	2518857	2518806	R. Proffitt	6/20/07 5:20 AM	1.1823168E12	Sorry no.	Once I've removed the U3 software I've used the HP formating tool (even on non HP sticks!) to format the stick. But there's the Linux way so let's do that. http://pendrivelinux.com/ has a variety of LiveCDs to choose from and at http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2007/05/16/usb-pendrivelinux-install-tutorial/ we see how to use FDISK to partition our USB stick. I don't offer tutorials in the forums since that usually duplicates content on the web. But I do try to point at solutions I've used before. Bob
