My interest in the memory was more reactive.
I bought a dell about 5 years ago that came with rambus memory.
Now that I want to add more memory to it, that rambus memory costs an arm and a leg!
The new system alreay is upgraded to 4gb so that might be fine.
My question was more about the reviews that list in the &quot;cons&quot; - no 64 bit windows, yet Dell says it comes with 64 bit vista and can support memory beyond the 32 bit limitation.
