<s> I was in the process of changing my power supply when the bulb in the lamp I was using exploded in front of the open case. </s>
<s> After cleaning up the mess I continued with the installation. </s>
<s> I pushed the power button and the PC wouldn't come on. </s>
<s> So I took the new one out and put the old one back in same result no power. </s>
<s> The green LED light comes on but when I push power it goes out then comes back on but nothing turns on. </s>
<s> Could the bulb exploding have damaged my motherboard. </s>

<s> You have to wonder why the bulb &quot;blew-up&quot; and take it from there. </s>
<s> Don't take it for granted things should fall into place, bulbs just don't normally blow. </s>
<s> I suggest, return the PC back to the way it was and see if it works at all. </s>
<s> If it does, then restart the install one item at a time. </s>
<s> Check all connections and setting, cabling, etc. </s>
<s> and proceed. </s>
<s> if it still doesn't work, then rebuild the PC elsewhere away from that AC outlet for now. </s>
<s> Reverify nothing remains of the bulb inside the PC, to be safe. </s>
<s> If the new PSU has a 115/230 sw. be sure its in the proper selection. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Did a thorough cleaning. </s>
<s> Found one small piece of glass. </s>
<s> Started over. </s>
<s> PC powered up. </s>
<s> Finished my upgrade. </s>
<s> Thanks for the advice. </s>
<s> I put a 95w bulb in a lamp that 75w is the max. </s>
<s> Never had anything like that happen before. </s>
<s> The lamp was made in China. </s>
<s> Glad everything fell into place and all is working. </s>
<s> Your reply is enough of a reward to know another PC is up and running. </s>
<s> adios -----Willy </s>
<s> Interesting. </s>
<s> Glass is an insulator, but it does have a property (all materials do) called permitivity that could impact the capacitance of very closley spaced PCB tracks, at high frequencies. </s>
<s> Modern MBs are astounding, and really do push the limits of PCB design, a can see how a minor thing like this might impact the system's behaviour, but this is still a bit surprising. </s>
<s> SC. </s>
