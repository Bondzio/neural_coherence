...i change out everything: hardware desktop, monitor, printer, and operating system.
so i started with w95 in 1997, then xp in 2002, and now vista.
each time i bought hardware components that were typical of the generation and capable of running the software.
this way i keep everything compatible.
i also go to the latest ms office when i make these changes; right now i am using office 2007. whatever is current in 2012 will be my new system at that time.
usually after five years small things start getting flaky (a power supply, a dvdrw, etc.).
i paid less for my vista based hp system in 2007 than i did for the xp based hp system in 2002. and now i have a nice big 22 inch lcd monitor for these tired old eyes....
