<s> Okay, originally I started out buying an E-machines T2245. </s>
<s> It has a 40GB WD hard drive. </s>
<s> The computer crashed, and I couldn't boot up the computer. </s>
<s> I had a 20GB WD hard drive as my slave drive. </s>
<s> Before the crash everything worked. </s>
<s> I went out and bought a 80 GB WD hard drive. </s>
<s> I removed the slave drive until I could install Windows XP on the 80 GB drive. </s>
<s> I put the 20 GB drive back in as a slave (jumpers in correct positions)and now can't access it. </s>
<s> It doesn't show up in &quot;My Computer&quot; folder as it should. </s>
<s> It does show up in the device manager, and it says it's working properly. </s>
<s> Same thing with the 40 GB drive. </s>
<s> I'm trying to get files off the old drives because I didn't back anything up (hey, I'm still new to this computer thing). </s>
<s> Please tell me what I'm doing wrong and how to fix it. </s>
<s> It's driving me nuts. </s>
<s> My mother-in-law passed away in April and I have irreplacable pictures on the other drives. </s>
<s> HELP!!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Since the pictures are irreplacable, then ANY home remedy or repair is not advised. </s>
<s> You would move to recovery services like DRIVE SAVERS or ONTRACK immediately. </s>
<s> http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6142-0.html?forumID=5&threadID=22988&messageID=249951 shows use of FDISK /MBR by Microsoft and an article why this is done. </s>
<s> Of course, this can be counterindicated if you have some oddball, non-stock method of an OS install, but the MBR is a cause of a missing drive. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
<s> do this: when you u turn on your pc go to CMOS utility by pressing &quot;delete&quot; on startup!! </s>
<s> then go to &quot;ADVANCED BIOS FEATURE&quot; check your &quot;BOOT DEVICES&quot; make 1st Boot device ur new hard disk and 2nd boot device ur old hard disk if it doesnt work try it vice versa!! </s>
<s> and if doesnt work then turn off ur new hard disk to BOOT!! </s>
<s> just make 1st boot device ur old hard disk and 2nd Boot device - cdrom or disabled!!! </s>
<s> dont boot ur new hard disk!! </s>
<s> so ur computer will read the old hard disk! </s>
<s> try it!!! </s>
