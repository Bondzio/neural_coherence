On the 1703, such a problem is commonly caused by poorly soldered toroidal coils on the inverter board.
My sister had the same monitor and problem, and I fixed it by popping it open and re-soldering the four toroidal coils.
A guide on how to do this, if you are so inclined, can be found here: http://www.lesliewong.us/blog/2005/05/02/hp-pavilion-f1703-flat-panel-display-blackout-solution/
