my father is in the market for a color printer to print high quality pictures from a canon s60.
i would like to hear from people in this forum, what they would suggest.
right now we are looking at minolta magicolor 2430dl, canon i960, epson stylus photo r800 and there are so many hp that i do not even know where to start (though i will look at the photosmart 7960).
am i missing anything?
as for price, it is not a big concern, he just wants quality prints.
