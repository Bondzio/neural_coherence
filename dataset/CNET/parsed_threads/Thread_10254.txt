<s> I own an HP Pavilion 6913 that has only one internal HD rack/cage. </s>
<s> Where/how can I get a second rack/cage or a dual rack/cage to install so that I may add a second internal HD -- which I've already purchased. </s>
<s> Thanks for any advice/suggestions -- Phil </s>
<s> The HP site shows 2 5 bays and a 3 listed as &quot;other&quot;. </s>
<s> If one of the 5 bays is available, HD carriers are available that will plug in like CD ROM devices. </s>
<s> If nothing occupies the &quot;other&quot; bay, this should be usable. </s>
<s> These are mostly meant for Zip and tape drives but HDs can be made to adapt. </s>
<s> If neither of these is an option, you might be better off buying an external enclosure for the drive you've already purchased. </s>
<s> These won't add an appreciable load to your PS which another internal will. </s>
<s> Many name brand PCs come with little reserve for adding such devices. </s>
<s> It's a desktop, right? </s>
<s> So why does it matter, if you're not going to move it around anyway? </s>
<s> Set the harddrive upside down on the bottom of the case and plug in the cords. </s>
<s> Just make sure the side with exposed circuit board don't scrap against the metal cage floor. </s>
<s> Just from experience, I cut a paper cover to cover the exposed electronics of the drive. </s>
<s> A few dead drives from staff because they dropped something conductive on the circuit board taught me this one. </s>

<s> but you get to deal with cables that only have so much length between devices. </s>
<s> You can also velcro a drive down if you wish. </s>
<s> Perhaps this is a bit tacky but it's up to the creativity of the user. </s>
<s> He did not mention if every bay was full or how many IDE devices were already installed. </s>
<s> This could make a difference in the answer. </s>
<s> Personally, I'd fill the bays first. </s>
<s> A case with only one bay for harddrive couldn't possibly be that big. </s>
<s> Also, very few people have more than 2 CD-ROMs. </s>
<s> I'm sure the cable will be long enough. </s>
<s> Having a technican over just to get a pair of bracers cost extra money. </s>
<s> Not really worth it. </s>
<s> Why pay when you don't have to? </s>
<s> Neither of us can physically see the case. </s>
<s> I took the time to look up the specs for that model. </s>
<s> It &quot;appears&quot; to have room for as many as 4 IDE devices if the bay referred to as &quot;other&quot; will work. </s>
<s> If the poster has all of those filled, he is not going to be able to add another IDE device without an add in card. </s>
<s> If one of those bays is empty, and it doesn't need to be designed for HDs only, this would be a good place to put the drive. </s>
<s> If he has 3 IDE devices already...say a CD ROM a burner and a HD, then he has 2 IDE cables already in use. </s>
<s> The distance between the master/slave jacks (on 80 conductor cables) tends to be 4 or 5 inches. </s>
<s> If that is the case, he is probably not going to put the other HD in the bottom of the PC. </s>
<s> If he only has 2 IDE devices, he has at least one open bay...even if it's a 5 &quot;. </s>
<s> Carriers are readily available to make this a simple operation. </s>
<s> If that was the case, he could just as well lay it in the bottom as you said as a second cable would only have one device attached anyway. </s>
<s> Personally, I would not do this but it's not my PC. </s>
<s> Given what we both know and don't know, plenty of options have been laid out and I hope one of them will be sufficient. </s>
