hi there can someone point me in the right direction of a web site that shows how to test a atx psu ie what voltages etc should be coming out of what leads etc.
i realize it should be under load conditons, mobo and at least one hard drive but the rest i have no idea.
so your informed help would be greatly apreciated.
kindest regards tony b.
