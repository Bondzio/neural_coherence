i would suggest format pc using ur window xp cd(or whatever cd u have.)
first back up ur wanted data (really important) turn off ur pc turn on ur pc and insert cd and then format cd on the disk c, it will automatically delte everything on the drive c and back to the condition which ur first start it.
