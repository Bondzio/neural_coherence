with one of my western digital drives ......on another forum someone answered me the following &quot;you might need to crack the case open and plug the hdd directly into the pc , could be the usb controller on the case gone.&quot; that was verbatim and all he said .

hate to ask , but someone else on here needs to know the voltage output specs on the same drive as yours .
