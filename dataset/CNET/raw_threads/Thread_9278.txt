I have a aGP slot. Which one of these is better? Is there something else that is better than these for the price? Thanks. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814150106 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814130202

Here's a good price for it.... http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1642902&CatId=1560 Hope you can get this one... My friend got one and now he can play any game at any settings with jaw-dropping results!!! Good Luck, and peace out!!!

Since the 6800 is slightly better than the 6600GT because it has 4 more pixel pipelines, it makes sense to get the 6800. But just the original 6800 won't give you awesome gaming performance, unless you overclock it like I do, which will definetly give you a extra boost in frame rates....

Wouldn't have to use the adapter to hook up to an analog monitor. One small thing I wouldn't need to remember to bring with me when I go somewhere. Never purchased any XFX stuff, yet. I will, though, eventually.

Check this out: http://firingsquad.com/hardware/geforce_6800_unlocking/ You can unlock 4 extra pipelines and make the 6800 into a 6800GT, this only works for the AGP cards. Next step is to overclock with coolbits: http://www.iamnotageek.com/a/39-p1.php Do these two things and you'll have a rocking card at a low price. Buy the lowest priced 6800 card, none of them stray very far, if at all, from the nVidia reference design. Please don't be mad at me if you nuke your registry, or mess up your system, extreme caution should be taken when modifiying any software or system files!
