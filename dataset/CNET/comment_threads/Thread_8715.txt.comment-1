I am looking to upgrade my speaker system which at the moment is Creative Inspire T7900, Which is OK for games and DVD's but the sound reproduction is not that briliant for music.
I am more interested in music.
My sound card is a Auzen X-Meridian 24bit/192kHz High Definition 7.1 Channel Surround Sound Board and I am running Vista Ultimate 32bit.
My music is on my H disc and have 67gigs stored.
The library contains everything from classical, electronic/dance, Pop/Rock, Big Band & Swing, Easy listening, New Age and everything in between.
I have looking at the Logetech Z-5500 because of the TOSLINK optic conection but was a little disapointed that review reported that the mid range was a little muddy and the base was a little overpowering.
I am limited to a budget of 220/250.
Any sugestions?
