But this is the last Christmas before college. Anyway, I have asked for a netbook (Dell Mini 10v). However, I am torn between whether I should get the netbook or the money for it. I plan on getting a Macbook before college and hopefully Apple will have a back to school deal. I just dont know if it would be worth it. My gut is it would, but I dont have both yet, so I cant be sure. Anyone have both a netbook and normal sized comp in a college environment? What are you thoughts? Thanks

I find it nice to have a machine that I don't have a big investment in. But frankly if I had a 13 inch macbook I think I'd not need the netbook. Bob

Using some simple reasoning I'm guessing by next school year you will have around $1,400 to spend, which could get you a laptop that will not only be easy to take to class, but also powerful enough to do everything you need well.
