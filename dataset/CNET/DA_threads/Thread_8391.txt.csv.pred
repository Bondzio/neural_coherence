1.1.1	We have ( had ) two computers .	St
1.1.2	The older one is ( was ) a Compaq with 2 WD ATA HDDs .	St
1.1.3	It suddenly died today , and I 'm wondering if there is a relatively painless way to transfer the data on the two ATA HDDs to the newer ( Acer ) SATA computer .	St
1.1.4	No need to move programs - just data .	St
1.1.5	Any help appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	This even is n't called recovery ( one talks recovery when the disk is damaged ) .	St
1.2.2	This is just copy .	St
1.2.3	Buy a USB2 to SATA/IDE-cable and use that to connect these drives to a USB-port on your newer PC ( like any USB-stick of external drive ) .	St
1.2.4	Then copy what you need .	St
1.2.5	An enclosure is better than a cable if you want to keep using these disk as ( for example ) a backup medium .	St
1.2.6	It seems you do n't yet have one .	St
1.2.7	Three notes : - for older drives this has to be an externally powered cable or enclosure ( that is : with a power adapter ) - probably you 'll need to set the disk to 'master ' , not slave , when using it this wad - you might need to 'take ownership ' of some or all info on that older drives - easy to google how to do that if you get an 'access denied ' message on that data Any computer shop will be able to sell you what you need and give advice .	St
1.2.8	This really has a near 100 % success chance .	St
1.2.9	Unless , of course , the breaking down of your old PC was caused by a failed hard disk .	St
1.2.10	You did n't tell that .	St
1.2.11	Then it will only work with the other disk .	St
1.2.12	Kees	St
1.3.1	if the drive is so old it needs external power ?	Ques
1.4.1	Older PC = older drive .	St
1.4.2	Only a 2.5 & quot ; laptop drive has a good chance ( but no more than that ) to function correctly without external power .	St
1.4.3	Kees	St
