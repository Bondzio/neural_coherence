I've scanned a number of pages into the hard drive of my computer with my HP 6110 All in One fax/scanner/copier. I want to combine them to send them as a single document by email attachment (it's a brochure with 8 pages). The HP Photo & Imaging software program I downloaded on my computer doesn't seem to allow me initially to scan all the documents into a single file nor allow me to combine them later. I've also tried playing with the attach files command of my Hotmail account to combine them there, without success. I've read all the documentation and used the help function to no avail. Does anyone know how that can be done? Many thanks if you can help.

Just paste all the image in, then blow each up so that there is one per page. Hope this helps, John
