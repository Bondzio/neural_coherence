<s> Hi, I have an older motherboard that has 3 pci and 1 AGP(4x and 8x rated) slots. </s>
<s> I am looking at an Nvidia NVS 280 AGP card. </s>
<s> Want to make sure that it would work, or if there are things that I need to look at. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> You may need Windows NT, 2000 or XP. </s>
<s> Vista seems absent. </s>

<s> Sorry, should have mentioned that I have XP Pro sp3. </s>
<s> With that, would it then be a card that I could use? </s>
<s> That card is not too heavy on the power requirements and the typical dual display card I've used in the past. </s>
<s> I have not used this specific model but some of the predecessors of that card. </s>
<s> Remember that like all things PC no one can issue a warranty it will work but it should be fine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks Bob, Just wanted to make sure there were no differences like with the PCI and PCIe, before I purchased one. </s>
<s> Thank you, </s>
<s> and incompatible with your mobo. </s>
<s> unless you're doing *professional* cad/cam work, there a cheaper agp geforce cards that will do dual monitors. </s>
