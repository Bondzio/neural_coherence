I had to send my acer desktop in for repair three times.
Each time they claimed they fixed the problem, but they didn't.
Their computer would show changed motherboard and memory, but the print out sent to me would show software reinstalled.
The boot problem never went away until the third time.
Thankfully the Acer office was not too far from my house - otherwise would have to pay shipping.
Tech support want to an Indian call centre and was very scripted.
So frusturating!!!
I didn't learn my lesson.
Today I purchased another Acer thinking that my first experience was just my bad luck - well right out of the box and the back end is dented in!
