My computer: Gateway GT5648E AMD 64x2 6000+ 3GB DDR2 GeForce 6150SE 300 watt power supply I know this is not much of a gaming computer, which is fine because I am not a hard core gamer.
I just like to play the occasional flight sim and am wondering if I can upgrade this computer slightly.
As it is, IL-2 still plays a little choppy.
I don't need to run the sims at their maximum settings - just above average settings would be fine for me.
Am I right that I can still install an external card along with the 6150SE?
I would rather not bother with a stronger power supply if I don't have to, but I will consider it.
I don't want to spend more than $200 total.
Any suggestions?
Thanks.
