<s> I intend on installing it myself. </s>
<s> Ifixit has great instructions for this, which includes a guide for keeping the various screws you remove sorted by type and location. </s>
<s> Question that came to me was raised by someone else recently asking a similar question. </s>
<s> Do I need to worry about upgrading the firmware for this drive? </s>
<s> How would I even determine what the firmware version is? </s>
<s> If the firmware does need upgraded, do I do it before I reinstall the OS? </s>
<s> I've upgraded firmware in windows machines and digital cameras but this is my first hardware experience with a mac. </s>
<s> The new hard drive is a Toshiba MK1234GAX 120GB ATA-6 (I picked it from a list of HD's that iFixIt gave as replacements they would install for my model iBook) The computer is an iBook 12&quot; 1.2 ghz G4 Thanks for any info... grim </s>
<s> I have never felt the urge to update the firmware on a HD so I would have no idea of how that would be accomplished. </s>
<s> It is a topic that has never raised its head since I started to use any of Apple's computers. </s>
<s> Wind it up and let it go. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> because if you take a look at the Power Macs and Pros, you'll notice that you just have to stick a drive in them and go. </s>
<s> Of course an iBook isn't the same, but same principle in a way... LOL. </s>
<s> I've never even heard of updating HD firmware for computers, but my PCs are from the Pentium era, so there's not much to work with. </s>
<s> I would think that once you install the system, the iBook will do everything it needs to for you. </s>
<s> What HD are you upgrading from? </s>
<s> My MBP has a 120GB HD, and I find it to be a tad small, though I haven't used up half of it... yet. </s>
<s> Surely it can go a bit bigger, but maybe 120GB is plenty for you. </s>
<s> I have never owned an iBook but the G4 models are still pretty good, considering that a lot of the good ones were produced a little over two years ago. </s>
<s> I've seen a friend's iBook and he just loves it. </s>
<s> Too bad he got it the day before the MacBook came out LOL . </s>
<s> Cheers. </s>

<s> It was a reasonable price (around $77 US). </s>
<s> It's a 5400 rpm drive. </s>
<s> I thought about a faster drive but decided against it, in favor of longer battery life. </s>
<s> I won't be using this computer for anything more than basic graphic design, and web design while on the go. </s>
<s> If I need more room I also have a portable 120 gb usb drive. </s>
<s> I will need to get a new apple sometime in the near future capable of decent speeds for video editing. </s>
<s> times is pretty good, LOL. </s>
<s> Well, enjoy. </s>
