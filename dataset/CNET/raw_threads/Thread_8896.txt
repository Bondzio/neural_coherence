But hey if you have no clue of how to build your own system then don't. Sometimes you might get the wrong hardware, might have put in somethimg wrong, etc. There was a guy on the cnet desktop forum ( his post is still there) who made a post about he built his own computer and might have blown something up. If you don't know anything about computers THEN don't build one. Learn more about computers and then you can try. As for companies that sell gaming machines, you can click on this link. http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html?forumID=68&threadID=137170&messageID=1548015 It is a post I made before. In it is some companies that make gaming rigs. Voodoo is one that I did not mention in that post. Of course you can customize them to your liking. You may choose a faster graphics card instead if a faster processor, etc. If you are a gamer and you want the most out of your dollar, I say you get the Dell XPS 600. My friend got it and it is amazing how much hardware you get. You get Logitech 5.1 speakers, 2 GPU's, 24 inch lcd monitor, tv tuner card, MCE 2005, and 1 terabyte of hard drive space.

The rest are high end gaming systems that roach wants. You won't get a high end system from Compaq. You will only get them from builders such as Falcon Northwest which is an extremely reliable company. My friend had a problem with his optical drives. He sent it back to them and got it fixed within a week. I have never bought from Overdrive. Their systems are top notch and I have read tons of magazine articles commenting Overdrive for their overclocking and keeping everything stable at the same time.

You get ALOT, I mean ALOT when you buy their systems( at least the really high end ones). Check this link out. It leads to one of IBuyPower's high end desktops. It comes with so much hardware, but the problem with IBuyPower is that they have terrible customer support. I have read where people were frustrated with IBuyPowers customer service and tech support. http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1881888,00.asp

It actually seems like the &quot;better&quot; bang for my buck. I know the prices are steep, but it looks like OPC will deliver. Every single review I've read of theirs: A perfect score. I hear the Tech Support is awesome. Just look at this Rating: (and the reviews!) http://www.resellerratings.com/seller2262.html And then take a look at iBuypower: http://www.resellerratings.com/seller2001-p2-s1-d1.html#reviews The price of iBuypower may be hard to beat, but what is the point of a cheap, yet high-end computer that's only purpose is a &quot;foot rest&quot;. ~Ibrahim~
