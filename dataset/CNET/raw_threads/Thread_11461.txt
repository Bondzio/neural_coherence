(mistake Blue-ray is wrong model for streaming video). This leaves my printer in another location, no longer connected to the wireless router I can no longer print from anywhere. The printer is located near another broadband connection and is an All-in-one that connects with USB (has Ethernet option). Though the cable is live, it is now presently unused. Between the two wants: 1.

Another member pointed out this new Dell box -&gt; http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/inspiron-zino-hd?c=us&l=en&s=dhs&cs=19 NOT a bad idea. Sorry I don't own one as I use a laptop for that position. 2. I just picked up a HP C4780 wifi printer and yes it works and yes it was a PAIN IN THE NET to set up. YES I got it working but after 4 hours I was about to pack it up until I thought it over one more time. It appears it was having trouble with the 802.11n router. I guessed and set the router to 802.11g mode and now it's ok. But there's a new lesson here. Bob
4160	2	376274	3211060	3211044	perflexed	1/1/10 5:35 PM	1.2623673E12	for clarification	Thank you for the quick response. Does your laptop have a HDMI connection or is there a cable that runs between VGA and HDMI? My VGA signal is not recognized by the TV. I have a request for information out there to Toshiba -- I'm using a VGA cable (15 pin, male both ends, to connect the two). So far no response. The printer is not something I do not want to replace, got a great deal on it and it is more heavy duty (small business vs home use). I'd rather move all equipment back if I could find an alternate way to stream movies (more important to my husband than me-- I need the office capability). I'm taking a serious look at the Dell you sent the link for, thanks again.

Today, it's connected with the HDMI connection. I can use VGA but because the HDMI pipes audio it's a cleaner solution. 2, My VGA signal is not recognized by the TV. I have a request for information out there to Toshiba -- I'm using a VGA cable (15 pin, male both ends, to connect the two). So far no response. Yes it's troublesome for some to setup. I used the clone display option. Some have not played with dual displays or it just doesn't work for some. Let's just say I futz with it and so far I usually get it to work unless it's some OS the owner loaded and there is a missing driver or bum OS install. 3. The printer is not something I do not want to replace, got a great deal on it and it is more heavy duty (small business vs home use). I'd rather move all equipment back if I could find an alternate way to stream movies (more important to my husband than me-- I need the office capability). There are small print server boxes galore out there. From 25 to much higher prices. But the problem I see is some of them falter on features. Such as my wifi HP C4780 lets me scan from any machine. 4, I'm taking a serious look at the Dell you sent the link for, thanks again. RAMARC, a member posted that. Nice find. I had missed that one.

I picked the same printer up the Monday after Thanksgiving when Staples had a sale, buy a new laptop, get the printer for $40. When I tried to connect the printer to the router it would not connect after repeated tries, wouldn't even turn on. The next day I boxed it up and returned it to Staples. They swapped it for another one, same model. The replacement one worked perfectly.
