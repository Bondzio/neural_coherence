you open yourself to a possible glitch as it wasn't intended to support pc3200 ram.
however, keeping it to 2 slots of ram and equivalent types will help keep the problems at bay.
there's no guarantee on this as your manual already states it doesn't support pc3200.
if possible and available, see if the bios has an update that may address this issue, but be sure what that updates does, as you may not need it or benefit from it.
pc3200 is nothing more than faster ram and keeps the same voltage requirements, so its up to you.
