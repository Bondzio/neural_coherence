i am looking at a new pc in the next couple of months - will either be a dell or gateway.
the options for dvd and cd drives seem to be endless these days.
i want to be able to burn audio cds, and also use have the ability to transfer videos and pics onto dvds for storage, and of course use dvds for backups of my hard drive data.
i know i want two drives - but what makes the most sense these days?
a dvd burner and cd burner?
or if i can use the dvd burner to make audio cds, then maybe just a cd rom?
i don't have a good understanding of what is compatible with what drive - so i find it a bit confusing - hope someone can help!
