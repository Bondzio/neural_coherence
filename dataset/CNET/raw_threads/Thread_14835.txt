After i do &quot;easy install&quot; and it installs drivers and everything directx and what not it aks to reboot. This is the funky part... After rebooting it shows the windows bar... about 26 times across =\ and then it goes to the black screen for about 6 seconds while you hear the hd kicking in, and then it shows the mouse with the busy icon next to it for about half a second, then it disappears and then nothing =( the screen just sits there and does nothing. Ok let me tell you how i have my BIOS set up, the agp is read first and then the aperture size was 128 cause i just had a 9200se but then i changed it to 256 for this new 9550. okay ALSO when i uninstall all the drivers and hydravision etc from the add/remove (HAVE TO BE IN SAFE MODE)it will work once more on regular mode, yet as soon as windows installs it's default OR i install any one of the two drivers on the retail disk, it screws the same again, and again. another weird thing i noticed is the driver says 9600 series yet when i do a manual install to the driver and UNCHECK compatible devises there are dirvers for the 9550 but when u CHECK compatible devices then it only shows &quot;9600 Series&quot; ONE MORE WEIRD THING.... ok my monitor is VGA and when it installs either default or through disk... it comes up that there is TWO display drivers... one is &quot;9600 Series&quot; and the other is &quot;9600 Series-Secondary&quot; that is how it show on my system hardware... i am not sure why my computer just goes black with any drivers installed.. but i have tried to play ut2004 with just default drivers and it tells me something about directx which i have 9c right now, or it says something about my drivers... =\ i am very confused. PLEASE HELP SUMONE

Uninstall everything you have put on so far and run the basic driver file. Now, the two monitors means your card has two video ports. I am guessing one VGA and one DVI so this is ok. You did not mention if your board was ATI built or from another manufacturer (such as Sapphire) that uses their chipset. I can't speak for this card but had a similar experience where the a card was finiky about who supplied the drivers. In short, don't add all the features and controls until you get a basic driver working.
