I fire up a couple of burning programs and can't get them to see the drive. So I look around, see that maybe I need to use Burnrights. Nope, it can't see the drive. So I read somewhere that I should flash the firmware. So I download the firmware flasher (Binflash and K34503CQ from dell). No go, they can't see the drive either. NECWinflash also says no supported devices. Freakin vista. Geez. Drive shows up in Device Manager, but none of these programs can see it. Anyone got any advice on how to proceed?

Moved to Vista, works fine for reading. Just can't get any burn program to recognize it. It's either a Vista problem or a firmware problem.

For Vista it would have to be a pretty current version of either. But I would give it a shot, especially since it shows in device manager.Good luck!
