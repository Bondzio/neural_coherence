<s> I live in an apartment complex that includes internet access in the unit. </s>
<s> I have a wall jack where I can plug in my network cable and plug the other end in to my computer, and it works every time, all the time. </s>
<s> I have a Linksys WRT54G router that I'd like to use for a wired and wireless network, and it will work sometimes, but not all the time. </s>
<s> I can plug it in and set up the network, and the internet access will work for a few hours, but then it stops and there's nothing I can do to make it work again except wait a few days and try again. </s>
<s> I've tried disabling DHCP, but still no luck. </s>
<s> Do I need to have it set as a router or a gateway? </s>
<s> Is there another setting that I need to change? </s>
<s> I know there's a way to do it, because I can pick up quite a few wireless networks on my laptop. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> The setup is not too hard but I will only offer this piece of advice. </s>

<s> Your building IP scheme might be 192.168.0.x 2. </s>
<s> Your LAN IP scheme must be something else like 10.0.0.x Your router could be defective? </s>
