1.1.1	Which case should I buy ?	Ques
1.1.2	There is the Praetorian 730 and the Antec P180 .	St
1.1.3	I have researched both and they both seem like good choices .	St
1.1.4	I have recently found the Antec P180 at Provantage for under $ 130 with shipping , while NewEgg offers it for $ 157.72 with shipping , a rather large price difference for this case .	St
1.1.5	The Praetorian 730 , no matter where one looks for it , is still $ 160+ with shipping .	St
1.1.6	Here are the two cases , both very attractive in my opinion .	St

1.4.1	but since i always favor antec , i 'd have to say that .	St
1.4.2	it has better airflow .	St

1.5.1	I was planning on buying a $ 65 case , but the more expensive cases , generally , have better cooling , a quieter design , a non-flimsy design and overall much better looks .	St
