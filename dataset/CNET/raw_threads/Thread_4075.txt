I wanted it because it works, was cheap, but mainly because it can hold up to 4GB of RAM. I'm not a pro at this but I love my games. The only problem is that it has 5 PCI slot 1 AGU and No PCI-E slots. Can any one name a few of the best card I can fit in a PCI slot? And or AGU. PS. Under 200$ would help this poor boy

Armed with that list I head to tomshardware.com and see how each card fares on the VGAcharts. Just so you know, I won't do this for you. Bob

What are the rest of the components in your computer build? You won't use more than 2GB of RAM for gaming, so getting a 4GB motherboard is not an issue. If you pay more for a motherboard with a PCI Express X16 expansion slot, you likely can get a more powerful PCI Express X16 video card for a price less than a comparable AGP video card.
