1.1.1	So begins an unusual build .	St
1.1.2	Put together a custom PC for a buddy of mine .	St
1.1.3	During OS install got several errors regarding memory stops and could not read sections .	St
1.1.4	After several reboots .	St
1.1.5	Was able to install OS and use it normally .	St
1.1.6	Next day , started it up cold and OS would not load , start-up recovery manager did .	St
1.1.7	Ran Memtest86 found a stick was erroring out every single test .	St
1.1.8	Took the stick out .	St
1.1.9	System booted fine and OS ran smooth .	St
1.1.10	Next day , cold started the machine , OS would not load .	St
1.1.11	Ran Memtest86 , found errors .	St
1.1.12	Took stick out of slot A and put it into slot B , ran Memtest86 again , no errors .	St
1.1.13	OS loads fine .	Polite
1.1.14	Operates fine .	Polite
1.1.15	Shut system down for an hour .	St
1.1.16	Started it back up .	St
1.1.17	Tested Ram again , found errors .	St
1.1.18	Swapped the stick slot , booted fine .	St
1.1.19	Ran a Burnin test on the RAM in OS and it found errors every time , but far less then Memtest86 .	St
1.1.20	-My guess .	Res
1.1.21	The motherboard is a Gigabyte GA-P55-USB3 r1.0 and the RAM is Corsair VS2 1333 .	St
1.1.22	The RAM is not on the approved list so I ordered RAM that was .	St
1.1.23	Have not received it yet , but the results I have been getting would lead me to believe it could be the motherboard as well .	St
1.1.24	I have already condemned the RAM and sending it back .	St
1.1.25	However , I would be wasting RMA time if the mobo is bad .	St
1.1.26	Nutshell question- What does it mean when the RAM tests bad after a cold boot , but after swapping slots , tests fine ?	Ques
1.1.27	Any help would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	Did you check the BIOS Settings for timing , voltage , etc. , ?	Ques
1.2.2	Did you contact the RAM mfg ?	Ques
1.2.3	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	The bios settings are set to default , except gigabyte by default enables RAM & quot ; turbo & quot ; mode .	St
1.3.2	So I set it to off .	St
1.3.3	So everything in Bios is set to defaults , no overclocking .	St
1.3.4	I have read on several forums about cold boot issues with gigabyte boards and commonly Corsair RAM .	St
1.3.5	Like I said before , I got & quot ; approved & quot ; RAM coming .	St
1.3.6	Followup Question- If it were the motherboard , would n't it not work at all ?	Ques
1.3.7	Can it be intermittent ?	Ques
1.4.1	If it were mine I 'd contact the MB mfg and the RAM mfg to get their recommendations .	St
1.4.2	Perhaps increasing the RAM voltage might help .	St
1.4.3	I 'd might also try another RAM test just to be sure .	Sug
1.4.4	Let us know how it turns out .	St
1.4.5	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	The tests are still coming up bad after a cold boot .	St
1.5.2	The OS is most likely not booting due to the Memory errors .	St
1.5.3	After a DIMM swap the memory will pass a 15 minute test .	St
1.5.4	I use Memtest86 to test my RAM and I trust it 's results .	St
1.5.5	However , if a RAM tests bad , it could still be the MB .	St
1.5.6	I have contacted Gigabyte Last Thursday and they have not wrote back .	St
1.5.7	( way to go 24 hour rule ) .	St
1.5.8	Will let you know when the new ( approved ) RAM gets here .	St
1.6.1	Here are some other tests ... .all I 'll say is they 're worth trying http : //pcsupport.about.com/od/toolsofthetrade/tp/memorytest.htm VAPCMD	St
1.7.1	I terminate the test after 15 minutes of no errors .	St
1.7.2	I still have to configure this machine for a friend .	St
1.7.3	I also used Burnin test in the OS to test RAM and CPU functions .	St
1.7.4	The Burnin Test finds issues with the RAM in the OS within 15 minutes .	St
1.7.5	The issue has now presumably become where the issue actually is .	St
1.7.6	The RAM or the Mobo ?	Ques
1.7.7	We will find out soon enough , I have the New Ram coming and if that flunks , I will RMA the board .	St
1.8.1	NIL	St
1.9.1	Got the New RAM today .	St
1.9.2	Threw it in before first boot .	St
1.9.3	System came up and booted right into Memtest86 .	St
1.9.4	Tested for 1 hour and found no errors .	St
1.9.5	Booted into OS right after , Ran BurnIn Tests on RAM , found no errors .	St
1.9.6	With the other RAM I would get an error by now .	St
1.9.7	So I am confident the RAM is good and not an issue .	St
1.9.8	Like I said , this is preliminary testing , any errors popping up in the next 36 hours will prompt an RMA of the motherboard .	St
1.9.9	I speculate the errors came from the other RAM , not that the RAM was bad , but it could have been a compatibility issue .	St
1.9.10	Voltages are often brought up when researching this issue .	St
1.9.11	It is just possible the Corsair was not getting what it was supposed to .	St
1.9.12	However all tests at this time report 0 errors .	St
1.10.1	brand/model did work ?	Ques
1.10.2	Posting that specific info might really help someone in future .	St
1.10.3	To make sure ... .run the RAM test overnight ... .you want more than 1 hours worth of testing if possible and better now than later .	Sug
1.10.4	VAPCMD	St
1.11.1	NIL	St
