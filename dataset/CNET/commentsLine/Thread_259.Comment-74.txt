there are apps on this hard drive that are there only because they were copied from my previous computer using pc relocator and i'd like to know what is the method of reinstalling win xp that is least likely to lose those programs.
i just want that to be part of our decision making.
you all have been great and i trust your opinions.
i have no other concerns except the ultimate $$$ cost of the external drive.
i mean, i can buy a new computer for $400, not that i want one that would cost that much.
just wondering?
thanks, ann
