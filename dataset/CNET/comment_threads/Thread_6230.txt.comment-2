All router &quot;power&quot; is limited but the FCC so no router is more powerful than the next.
I will write the DWL-G550 is a card that was indeed SO-SO and using another antenna helped.
This is why we have other solutions like moving the router to a central location or using a second router as a WAP.
Sorry but the answer is no.
