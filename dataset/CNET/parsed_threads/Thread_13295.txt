<s> Hey, I was wondering if anyone could link me to a place where I can buy white data sided DVD's. </s>
<s> The kind that DVD movies and DVD video games are printed on. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> http://club.myce.com/f34/inkjet-printable-dvd-white-vs-silver-179200/ explains why some folk want White DVDs. </s>
<s> Example source at http://www.amazon.com/Verbatim-DataLifePlus-Inkjet-Printable-Spindle/dp/B00020T4UK Bob </s>
<s> I'm talking about the data side though. </s>
<s> Are we talking about the same side? </s>
<s> Because that article talked about printers and I'm pretty sure ink on the data side wouldn't be a good idea. </s>
<s> I'm thinking you might be thinking you want to get some of those silver white blanks that games and such are made from. </s>
<s> HOWEVER these are not &quot;recorded&quot; but pressed. </s>
<s> Here's a video about this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZKD2aYLTWw Can you clarify what you are looking for? </s>
