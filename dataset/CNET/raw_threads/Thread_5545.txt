Since the Motherboard manufacturer and model is showing as :&quot;To be filled by OEM&quot;. Can u tell me any way to find the size or voltage of the power supply in my PC. But at the back of my CPU ,a sticker states &quot;DC +12V/4A&quot; Is that the size of the power supply ?

Hopefully, its visible and states what it is and specs. If not, its on the other side, do what you have to to inspect. If this is an OEM(Dell, Gateway, etc) then look-up that model# on the respective support website and check for specs there, but even so, the decal should be present. Most graphic card makers supply what the basic requirements are for its usage, again visit the support website for the model# in question. Don't assume anything, check. For the most part, a decent 350W is required but system demands should be well served by at least a 400W psu of a brandname or better. tada -----Willy
