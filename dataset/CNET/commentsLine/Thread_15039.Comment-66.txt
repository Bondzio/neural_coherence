true, but the op said that he wants to use the drives as external drives.
these low-cost adapters are great for quickie maintenance, but i don't think you'd want your bare drives exposed to &quot;the elements&quot; during ongoing use as an external drive.
even if only used occasionally for backup, then storage; a drive dock might be a more convenient choice.
