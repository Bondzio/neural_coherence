hello, i want to build a nice gaming computer, and i have slightly over a grand to spend on parts (not including monitor and operating system, those are covered already).
i have some general computer knowledge, what parts handle what and i have a pretty good idea of where to plug them in.
that being said, when buying parts i'm at a bit of a loss.
i'm not sure when looking at a motherboard for instance, what i need to be looking for.
i think i might could find some high performance parts, but i'm really worried about them being compatible if anyone has ideas on some good compatible parts or possibly tips as to what i could run into as far is incompatibility issues, that would be great.
thanks, nicholas
