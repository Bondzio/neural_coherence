3 times this weekend my computer had the blue screen on it saying it was dumping the physical memory.
Nobody was using it, I just saw the message as I was walking by.
The first 2 times I rebooted, it started up normally.
The 3rd time it gave me a ''harddrive not found'' error.
I am using XP sp2.
The hard drive is less than 6 months old.
I don't have any extra hard drives, just a cd-rom & a 3'' floppy.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
