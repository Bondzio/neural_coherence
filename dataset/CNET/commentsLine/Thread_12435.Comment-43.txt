i had forgotten that spinrite costs $89.00 for a first time buyer; i've been upgrading since the original spinrite, and it only costs $29 to upgrade, which is a bargain if you need it in your toolkit - especially if you have multiple computers, and use it to investigate problems with friends' computers.
but it's powerful and its diagnosis is well-accepted.
