ok i have a vivo nvidia agp 8x card i dont want to toss.
and i want to upgrade to the good stuff and i want to use my vivo for tv as well and recording tv wile i work.
but i want to play the new games and the power of this card is outdated hell it barely lets me play wow at near max.
i want to build a system with both pcie and agp slots and use my old card instead of tossing it.
so is this a possibility.
please assist if u can
