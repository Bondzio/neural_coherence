My school is being retarded and making all the students buy mac computers (ugh)I just bought my laptop last summer and don't feel like spending $1800 for A computer I hate and will only use in school. They said i can't use windows but they never said I had to use an apple. Is there an easy way I could install mac OS X leopard to my Vista PC, without losing any of my vista files, having to reinstall vista, or having any major problems with my pc? thanks for any help

Both points of view, of course, are irrational. And it's uncommon to see a school prescribing a Mac indeed, either the hardware or the software. They might have good reasons for it, but as you don't write anything on that, I can't comment. But I'm sure it can't be called 'retarded'. Anyway, Apple doesn't allow install of it's OS on other hardware than its own. And discussion on illegal hacking activities is explicitely forbidden by the forum policies. So I'm locking this thread.
