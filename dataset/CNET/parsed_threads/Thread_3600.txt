<s> I'm looking to upgrade my AMD processor but I am confused about what is compatible with this Motherboard. </s>
<s> Here is what I have: Compaq Presario SR1703WM Name AMD Sempron 3200+ Codename Palermo Specification AMD Sempron(tm) Processor 3200+ Package Socket 939 Chip set: Northbridge ATI Xpress 200 (RS480) rev. </s>
<s> 10 Southbridge ATI SB400 rev. </s>
<s> 00 Motherboard: Mainboard Model Amberine M (0x390 - 0x1DB08328) Can any point me in the right direction for a tool to help or recommend some AMD processors that I can use? </s>
<s> Thanks, Ken </s>
<s> Sadly there are very few 939 chips around. </s>
<s> Since you didn't reveal your country, research what 939 AMD chips you can obtain and then supply a list here. </s>
<s> NO DUAL CORE UNITS! </s>
<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
<s> I live in the USA. </s>
<s> Are you saying that any socket 939 will work on that Motherboard? </s>
<s> I did find one processor AMD-Athlon 64 Single Core 3500+ Processor-2.2GHz-34p1044 from a vendor. </s>
<s> It is a step up but if I can get a faster one that is compatible I'm open to that too. </s>
<s> This is a hand-me-down computer that I thought might make a good DVR but I do need at least 2.2 GHz to do the job from what Hauppage says. </s>
<s> Ken </s>
<s> That you should search for non-dual core socket 939s, put the list here for members to shoot down or give a thumbs up. </s>
<s> Sorry if I was unclear. </s>
<s> As to DVR, my old 1.0GHz Via C3 based computer does that work. </s>
<s> Why would I need more horsepower than that? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Bob, OK I will search for the processors. </s>
<s> As to the DVR I was looking at the Hauppauge HVR 1250 card to process the cable signal and the tech said this: &quot;If that is a single core system then it is recommended to have a 2.2 GHz or higher anything lower can cause issues such as stuttering video. </s>
<s> If you have a good video card to pull some of the strain off the CPU then it could possibly work in that system but if not you will most likely experience some issues.&quot; This is digital and analog capable, but I could go down to just analog since I will be recording off my cable. </s>
<s> Compaq has integrated video processor which is crap. </s>
<s> I'm all ears if you have a better plan. </s>
<s> Thanks again, Ken </s>
<s> OK, here is a list I was able to compile. </s>
<s> Does it matter if I upgrade to Athlon and not Sempron? </s>
<s> AMD Athlon 64 3800+ 2.40GHz Processor $30 AMD Athlon 64 4000+ 2.6GHz 512KB L2 Cache Socket AM2 62W Single-Core Processor AMD Athlon LE-1600 (ADH1600DHBOX) 2.2GHz AMD Athlon LE-1620 (ADH1620DHBOX) 2.4GHz $53 AMD Sempron LE-1300 (SDH1300DPBOX)2.3GHz $39 AMD Sempron LE-1250 (SDH1250DPBOX)2.2GHZ $29 AMD Athlon LE-1640 (ADH1640DPBOX) 2.6GHz $38 I think these are all 939 sockets but they also call them AMD2 sockets? </s>
<s> I hope you all have some answers for me. </s>
<s> Thanks, Ken </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socket_939 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socket_AM2 Strip your list to just 939 single core units. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> your mind is made up on getting the 1250, why shop for a CPU before you have tried it in your PC? </s>
<s> Some things in life are better when serialized. </s>
<s> I agree. </s>
<s> TRY the 1250 before you decide a new CPU is required. </s>
<s> Most of my DVR speed is all about the hard disk and not the CPU. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Good point. </s>
<s> That is what I most likely will do, try the HVR 1250 first but at least I have some idea of what processor upgrade I can use if needed and they don't seem to be expensive. </s>
<s> The options are not a big jump in speed either 2.2 or 2.4 GHz. </s>
<s> What is confusing is socket 939 vs what the AMD site lists sockets AM, AM2 and another one. </s>
<s> I wish terms were consistant across the board. </s>
<s> Thanks again for the advice. </s>
<s> I've bookmarked the wiki links you provided and I will read more. </s>
