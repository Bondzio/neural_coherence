i stupidly formatted the wrong hard drive when there are two external hard drives connected on my computer.
it is a wd external hard drive.
i heard about the data recovery software which could help restore the saved data back from a formatted drive.
but, i am afraid the program may make things worse.
do i have to use a data recovery program to get back my videos?
is there any one that could give me some suggestions?
thanks!
