<s> I need help choosing a photo scanner that can handle black & white negatives, black and white prints, color negatives, color prints and color transparencies-- all with good quality results-- and transmit them directly to my PC for editing and storage. </s>
<s> I use Picasa now. </s>
<s> I also have available Irfanview and Microsoft Digital Image suite 10. </s>
<s> I've never owned a scanner, but I've heard that I'm not asking too much of a single unit. </s>
<s> If the same machine can also be used as a printer, so much the better but that isn't essential. </s>
<s> There are several on the market that have the capability to do what you want to do. </s>
<s> Hewlett Packard makes several different models. </s>
<s> Epson makes a nice one also, it is called the PERFECTION and works well. </s>
<s> There are several units that do it all, printing, scanning(slides and transparencies) and copying. </s>
<s> Check out your local box stores and see what they might have. </s>
<s> They are not that expensive probably between 200 and 300 bucks should get you there. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
<s> Thanks, Phil. </s>
<s> That will get me going. </s>
<s> BTW, what's your personal experience with the scanners you mentioned? </s>
<s> ztiw </s>
<s> Epson Perfection years ago included cleanup software. </s>
<s> Example at http://s175.photobucket.com/albums/w146/rproffitt2000/?action=view&current=after.jpg Your &quot;spec&quot; is a little odd. </s>
<s> Can you explain &quot;transmit them directly to my PC for editing and storage&quot;? </s>
<s> Some thought about a scanner that you hovered over tapping some copy button and never touching the PC. </s>
