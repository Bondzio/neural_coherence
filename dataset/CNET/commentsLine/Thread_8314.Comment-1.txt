my grandson installed a new graghics card in his computer and his lcd monitor wouldn't work right.
after doing the calculations and going to the antec website to verify the numbers it turns out he needs to upgrade his power supply.
there are so many brands out there, which is the best brand?
he wants to stay in the $100 or below range.
we are going to put in either a 500 or 550 watt unit (he has a 300watt now) and am looking at the antec or thermaltake brand.
is there any difference dependability wise of these two brands or are there better ones.
any advise would be appreciated.
