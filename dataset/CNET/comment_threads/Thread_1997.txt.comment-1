We have a modem connected to a Cisco 506E PIX firewall, connected to a 25-port Cisco switch.
We're using the PIX as the DHCP server.
One server machine (functioning as DNS server, etc.)
connected to the switch, 23 wired desktop connections, and two Netgear wireless access points.
The APs have the DHCP function turned off.
Here's the problem - I can connect multiple PCs to each AP, but only one PC per AP can be connected to the server and internet at a time.
I need to be able to connect multiple PCs to the server/internet via these APs!
I've configured the same wireless APs elsewhere at our remote sites with no problem - but they were connected via a router to a modem - no server or PIX involved.
Any suggestions on how to troubleshoot?
