&quot;pcmark04 it reads my fsb bus speed as 200mhz&quot; i've found that some programs can't report this reliably over the few thousand makes/models of pcs.
you can try cpuid or cpuidz you can find with  and if it gives a different answer, contact the authors as to why that happens.
but more to the point, the supplier of your machine should answer your inquiry about the jumper settings (if there are any.)
