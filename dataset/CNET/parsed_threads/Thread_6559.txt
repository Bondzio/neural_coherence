<s> i got an old Pentium 4 hyperthreaded, and when i run any of the three standard torture tests in prime95, my cpu processing tends to stay at approximately %50. </s>
<s> it jumps higher for a millisecond or so once in a while, but it tends to stay at 50. shouldn't it be at %100? </s>
<s> ive noticed this tendency in other applications as well. </s>
<s> You can run 2 instances to make it go to 100. </s>
<s> if i try to do that it automatically closes the new one </s>
<s> read this for an explanation: http://www.playtool.com/pages/prime95/prime95.html with a hyper-threaded p4, you SHOULD NOT run two instances of prime95 since you don't have 2 cpus. </s>
<s> I used to do that with the old SETI program on my HT and it worked fine with more results per hour. </s>
<s> I guess prime95 is a different beast. </s>

<s> prime95 is. </s>
<s> launch 2 of them on an HT p4 and it will be next-to-unusable. </s>
<s> The idea was to get it to max out the CPUs and since I was not at the machine, just what I wanted. </s>
