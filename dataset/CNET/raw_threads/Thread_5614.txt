These typically use a Firewire connection while the Hard Drive based ones use USB. Sony make a good range, which work with iMovie but there is one major brand that does not work with Mac at all. I'll find the name and post it here later. You can edit the footage from the one you have but you first have to convert it to something that iMovie can handle. Take a look at this page on the Apple site. It deals with importing video from a disk. Click Here P
