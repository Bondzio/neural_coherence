Can you help with a Boot On Flashdrive Or CD?
What are any methods to boot to update the BIOS?
Sometimes the Laptop or Desktop will not update the BIOS with the standard methods.
Can you boot with Linux or UbunTu on a Flashdrive or a CD?
Then flash / update / the BIOS?
But after creating a bootable CD how you can copy the BIOS file over to it?
Thank you for all of your time and new and creative ideas.
