<s> I know most of my family thinks im the big tech guy, so I feel extremely dumb asking this question. </s>
<s> I have this 2 or 3 year old dell that has 256mb of DDR 2100.I want to upgrade to 512mb . </s>
<s> DDR 2100 is hard to find and in some cases the new DDR 3200 is cheaper. </s>
<s> Would 512mb of DDR 3200 work fine in my PC? </s>
<s> Or is DDR 2100 the only solution I have? </s>
<s> I know for a fact some one told me i wont experience any better bandwidth but he was not totally sure if it would work thats why im asking before i buy. </s>
<s> Thanx and Happy Holidays </s>
<s> so i was looking and ther is a good deal for a stick of 512mb of DDR 2700. is it OK? </s>
<s> PC3200 would be backwards compatible. </s>
<s> A check on Dells site might give a clue. </s>
<s> Take a trip here and plug your machine type into their memory finder. </s>
<s> It will tell you what type/speed memory your machine needs and what it is going to cost. </s>
<s> In theory you can mix an match speeds but if the cost is only a few bucks then I would just get the proper one. </s>
<s> www.crucial.com </s>
<s> lower priced?? </s>
<s> Then when he upgrades to the next computer he can use it in that one. </s>
<s> He seems to know that it won't run at the higher speed, so buy the lower price. </s>
<s> Buy from a vendor that provides return and life warranty. </s>
<s> Most do. </s>
<s> Obvioulsy don't get ECC or Registerd if the present isn't. </s>
<s> If the board will only take 2100, so be it. </s>
<s> If the board will accept 2700 or 3200 but only run at 2100, that means he has faster memory for a future board. </s>
<s> I was upgrading my hardware slowly and went this route. </s>
<s> New board runs faster memory the old MOBO was running at 266. chuck </s>
<s> Most of todays memory is backwards compatible, so the 3200 would read the 2100 bus speed. </s>
<s> save a little more and use the 2700. you'll never notice the difference. </s>
<s> Thanks i ordered the 512 at 3200. my friend has the smae mobo and sid it works but at 2100. im plaing to upgrade later so its a good deal. </s>
