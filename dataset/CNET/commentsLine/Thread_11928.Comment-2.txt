apparently the imac will perform a little better with matching pair of memory modules.
i doubt you will notice the difference in everyday use.
get the single 1gb and later you will be able to get the second on and have a matching pair.
i don't know what the bench marks are for the different configurations but i'm guessing that unless you are doing something really ram intensive, it will not show.
good luck p
