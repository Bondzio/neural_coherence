<s> Hello everyone, I have a 2003 Western Digital 40GB IDE hard drive. </s>
<s> My purpose for this hard drive was to run Windows Sever 2003 for a server. </s>
<s> I went to reinstall Windows on it, and after the setup says &quot;Starting Windows&quot; I get a BSOD with PAGE_FAULT_IN_NON_PAGED_AREA , error, I know it is the hard drive and not the ram. </s>
<s> I Have used 5 different ram sticks, each individually. </s>
<s> The hard drive was working just a few days ago in this pc. </s>
<s> This hard drive works in my HP Pavilion a810n, but not on this older Pentium 3 motherboard. </s>
<s> I have done extensive formatting, and still nothing. </s>
<s> The PC thinks the hard drive is just about 60GB when its really 40GB. </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> Please! </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> That's strange. </s>
<s> Things to try: 1. </s>
<s> What does the BIOS say about its capacity? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> How does it behave when used as an external disk? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Formatting is one thing, deleting an rebuilding the partition(s) on it is another thing. </s>
<s> What happens then? </s>
