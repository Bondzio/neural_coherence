<s> i have just built my own computer & it keeps saying boot disk error enter system disk & press enter no matter what i put in the cd drive it keeps coming up with the same message & i'm lost for what to do please help </s>
<s> did u change the boot order in the BIOS setup to first check the CD-ROM? </s>
<s> I assume u have a brand new hard drive, so u'll need to format and partition it before installing the OS. </s>
<s> Take a look at the 'advanced chipset features' in the bios, is the cd-rom drive listed, and the hard drive? </s>
<s> Also it would help to have a few details of your set up. </s>
<s> phantazy </s>
<s> i have the cd drive as the first boot drive then the hard drive and then the floppy. </s>
<s> how would i go about formating and partion a new hard drive on a brand new computer build? </s>
<s> or at least a setup/formatting program from the drive manufacturer. </s>
<s> The OS, say XP, comes on a CD that is bootable and most of the time the CD is placed in the CDROM drive and away you go. </s>

<s> Hope this helps. </s>
