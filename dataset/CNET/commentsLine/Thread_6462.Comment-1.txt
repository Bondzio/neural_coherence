ok, so here's my problem.
i'm home from school and for some reason or other my laptop will not connect to the internet.
i was home for thanksgiving break and it was working fine.
it seems to be working fine now, aside from it not connecting to the internet.
my wireless signal is as strong as can be and it connects to the router, but when i open ie it wont connect to the internet.
does anyone have any idea what could be wrong or how i could fix it?
