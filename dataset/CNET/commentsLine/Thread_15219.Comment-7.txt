so i tried downloading the driver update (from 6/28/2008) from the intel site for my computer, windows vista home premium 32bit edition.
the first page of the installer said the drivers the installer updated, and the 945gm express chipset family was included on the list.
then setup quits saying &quot;the driver being installed is not validated for this computer.
please obtain the appropriate driver from the computer's manufacturer.&quot; hm... but it says my driver is from 12/12/2006, and when i try to update it from the device manager and tell it to search the internet to find the upgrade, it says that i already have the most up to date version.
