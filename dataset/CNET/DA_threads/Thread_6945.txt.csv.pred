1.1.1	Hi All, Appreciate, if someone could please advise me, at what price will I be able to sell my Lenovo Ideapad S9e which I bought in June'09 for &#8364; 320.00.	St
1.1.2	Thanks All.	St
1.2.1	The best thing to do is to check the price for a comparable laptop at the usual second-hand sites in your country.	St
1.2.2	A three year old netbook without warranty can't be worth much.	St
1.2.3	If it's the cheapest one I see it has: Atom N270 processor, 512 MB, 8.9&quot; screen, 80 GB hard disk, XP Home, 3 cell battery (the original one).	St
1.2.4	Let's say 25 euro's.	St
1.2.5	Maybe 50 but not more.	St
1.2.6	Kees	St
1.3.1	Hi Kees, Thanks for your reply.	St

1.3.3	It has 1GB HD memory.	St
1.3.4	Thanks.	St
1.4.1	The model/make does not have to match to be one you are comparing.	St
