A friends laptop broke and they had the whole harddrive backed-up onto my home PC, software, program, files and folders the whole lot. She bought a Toshiba MK6025GAS portable hard drive to move it all off my PC and onto her new one. It comes with just USB cable which when I plug it in the USB icon at the bottom of my screen is displayed but my PC does not recognise it as a 'Drive' at all so I cannot select it to copy to it. The hard disk came with no instructions and I am at a total loss as what to do! In Systems&gt;Device Manager it is displayed simply as 'Toshiba MK6025GAS USB Device' but cannot be selected. HELP!! I have very little 'computer' know-how and am stuck as to what I need to do..can anyone help me in baby steps? My PC has Windows XP home edition. Many Thanks for any help offered in advance

Here's a web site showing how to prepare a new drive. http://www.samspublishing.com/articles/article.asp?p=418013&seqNum=9#windowsxp Bob
