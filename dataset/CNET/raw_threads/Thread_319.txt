On Networks N300MA USB 2.0 N300 Wireless Micro Adapter - Newegg.com. The step-by-step instructions on the back of the box say to push the button on the adapter, and push the wps button on your router. my router is downstairs. Our router is an older netgear one that does not have a button for wps. it's number is mr814v2. I installed the adapter with the installation disc. Is there any way to get internet in my room?

If the antenna is not connected..then connected it. I know I never connect my antenna unless I have a reason to do so. I don't want other people to use my router for a wifi spot.
