1.1.1	Hi , I was wondering what motherboards might support Crucial 's 2GB kit ( 1GBx2 ) DDR2 PC2-8500 Ballistix Tracer 240-pin .	St
1.1.2	I am looking to buy this memory and also a motherboard , but I do not know what motherboard supports it .	St
1.2.1	What you want to do is search the mobo sites and find out what the mother board supports .	St
1.3.1	I dont want to sound lazy or anything , but wuold you might have heard of one .	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	have official ( you can call tech support ) support .	St
1.6.2	mobos with the intel p35 chipset are n't readily available in the retail channel yet though .	St
1.6.3	many p965 and 650i/680i motherboard can support ddr2-1066 via the overclocking/tweaking options in their bios .	St
1.6.4	unless you plan to seriously OC ( and have the necessary patience ) , a good ddr2-800 kit can perform equally well as the crucial kit .	St

1.9.1	If one uses the search tool at NewEgg.com , that is currently the only motherboard listed as supporting DDR2 1066 .	St
1.9.2	The trick is that many other motherboards with nVidia 680i and 650i chipsets can be overclocked to support those faster RAM speeds .	St
1.10.1	EVGA 122-CK-NF63-TR LGA 775 NVIDIA nForce 680i SLI ATX Intel Motherboard I think it will work	St
1.11.1	See if you can Google that model for performance issues and quirks ( if any ) .	St
