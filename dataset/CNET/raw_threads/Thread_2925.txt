There are files inside my DVD+RW, so whenever I want to copy or add more files into the DVD+RW, it always ask me to erase all the files inside the DVD+RW before copying or adding files. Hence, every time I want to copy or add files into the DVD+RW, I have to copy the files inside the DVD+RW to my laptop and then recopy those files from my laptop back to the DVD+RW together with some new added files. I believe that DVD+RW shouldn't work this way but I really don't know how to solve this problem. Can anyone help.....?

While InCD and other software will allow use of RW media as a disk drive the stories you read here when it burbs and they want to know how to recover the files are legendary. Bob

On the other hand, if the disk is not full, it should add the files. Not closing the disk will enable this. If you close the session then you need to erase the disk first.

So, I did not even close it but why I can't write my files into the DVD ever there are more than 50% of the space? I believe that DVD+RW works like a floopy disk. Hence, can anyone tell me what should I do?

If not you may not be ready for the technical answers. But let it suffice there are limitations to multisession CD/DVDRW use. Is that good enough? Bob

I believe that my problem is not a matter whether my technical knowledge is up to a standard. I believe that copying of data into DVD+RW is a simple thing, just like copying data into diskette. Hence, if you could guide me the steps of copying the data, that will be great. FYI, I did format my DVD+RW before the 1st usage. I'm not sure whether formating will affect my DVD. Thank you.

There are deeper issues here and limitations in the packet writing systems. I can't duplicate how it works here but in a nutshell multisession does have limitations and is not exactly like a diskette. Bob

In the first place, why DVD+RW is created? How come it is not user-friendly?
7874	11	288881	2738195	2738104	R. Proffitt	3/26/08 6:05 AM	1.2065115E12	Think back in time.	DOS was considered user friendly just a few decades ago. Some may not consider this an answer but if we add on that there is NO STANDARD in packet writing and the makers competed (campaigned?) for theirs to be &quot;it&quot; you might begin to understand how we got here. -&gt; There it is. You would not only want to research how packet writing works but how we got here and the battles/skirmishes along the way. Bob

But then again the lessons learned here show it's not reliable enough. What I find is most won't agree until it happens to them. Bob
