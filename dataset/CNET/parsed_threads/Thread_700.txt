<s> I'm investigating the best way to provide connectivity between two locations 2200' apart, with at least 2 sub-locations at each end. </s>
<s> The current plan is pulling rg6 and cat6, but I'm not sure that would even work? </s>
<s> I'd like to see a wireless implementation, possibly including VoIP phones at the remote location. </s>
<s> There are 2 phone lines into the main house only, though the 'barn' could be wired, too. </s>
<s> I'm thinking satellite broadband, distributed wirelessly. </s>
<s> It's not currently obvious that there is LOS to the retreat area, but NLOS, I'm pretty sure. </s>
<s> Would it make more sense just to put satellites at either end? </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the two locations are on different transformers, so connecting over the power lines is not an option. </s>
<s> What might be a ballpark budget for connecting 2 computer in the remote location(also wirelessy) and 2 or 3 at the main house and 'barn'(separated by about 300'? </s>
<s> Thanks for any ideas_________compwire </s>
<s> There are microwave links for just such an application. </s>
<s> They run from 1 to 5 thousand per end and line of sight is required. </s>
<s> Usually people will not do this and just drop a wired connection into the ground. </s>
<s> In the 300 foot range, you can go with consumer items such as WiFi and place repeaters to extend the range of the Access Point. </s>
