unless you're running xp pro, you won't have a software raid option.
software raid will affect performance but if you're main concern is 'backup' (rather than fault-tolerance) then raid is overkill.
a backup solution will protect your data AND allow you restore old items...
RAID will not help you if you delete something and find you need it a few days or few months later.
the maxtor one-touch and western digital mybook both come with automatic backup software for far less than $600.
