1.1.1	I recently bought a Dell computer with a CD/DVD ROM.	St
1.1.2	The ROM is a dounble layer burner.	St
1.1.3	I Haven't had any complaints with burning, it does DVDs at 16X, but I am unhappy with it's read speed.	St
1.1.4	It seems when I play computer games the ROM just doesn't read the CD fast enough.	St
1.1.5	I have a second open bay that will fit another ROM drive.	St
1.1.6	Should I look into getting a faster CD-ROM drive, and use that for gaming and copying CDs?	St
1.1.7	If so any suggestions on the brand?	St
1.2.1	For under 99 bucks you could get one of those CD copier machines.	St
1.2.2	But switching to decaf may be cheaper.	St
1.2.3	As to switching drives, sure.	St
1.2.4	But I wouldn't fix a working machine.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	I have to ask.....Bob?	St
1.3.2	Whats' with the decaf thing?	St
1.3.3	LOL as for another optical drive, I'd definitely go with a faster optical drive for games and cd burning.	St
1.3.4	Given the rock bottom prices, I'd recommend a 52x32x52 cd burner.	St
1.3.5	As for brand, LG is available just about everywhere, and are decently reliable.	St
1.3.6	If you wanted to go high end Plextor is the way to go.	St
1.3.7	*NOTE* Be forewarned that Dell machines are not the most optical drive friendly machines on the planet.	St
1.3.8	You may have to try different jumper configurations and switch the channels around unitl you find one that works.	St
1.3.9	Dell's boards don't have the most rock solid bios' out there.	St
1.3.10	In addition, be prepared for the fact that in order to reduce costs, Dell typically uses one IDE cable to connect both the hard drive and optical drive to the same IDE channel.	St
1.3.11	A performance no no, but in the world of mass production, the cost saving using only one cable by far out way any performance gains obtained by doing it properly and having the hard drive on it's own channel set as master either by jumper or cable select.	St
1.3.12	When you do do the upgrade, (you'll likely have to purchase an IDE cable - make sure it's 80 pin)first attempt to configure the hard drive as the master on the primary ide, and the two opticals on the secong ide.	St
1.3.13	This will give you the best hard drive performance, but bear in mind it will impact your optical drive performance if you're one of those people who try to use both optical drives at the same time.	St
1.3.14	(I have no idea why people do that) As I stated previously, this might not work out so well on a dell board, so use whatever config that works.	St
1.3.15	Really you'll never actually notice any performance differences with a optical drive on the primary channels unless you're trying to burn and do something else that transfers large amounts of data back and forth to the hard drive.	St
1.4.1	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine notes the stimulant effect which could lead to the consumer being a bit more impatient.	St
1.4.2	My best advice is that for the extra few seconds you may have to wait, fixing a working box is just a bad idea.	Polite
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	as usual.	St
1.5.2	I don't see a real issue.	St
1.5.3	By the way, it is not a ROM (read only memory), it is a burner.	St
1.5.4	That burner is probably reading CDs at 40x or 48x.	St
1.5.5	If your games aren't playing right, you probably have other issues, like a too full HDD.	St
1.5.6	chuck	St
1.6.1	I can't stand decaf.	St
1.6.2	I am a huge coffee fan and prefer only caffinated.	St
1.6.3	I drink a fair share of it in a day but still have patients for a 16X among many other things.	St
1.6.4	If anyone has seen that guy from mad tv(i think), the caffine junky with the bulging eyes, yeah that's me.	St
1.6.5	Of course I am not one of those sit in my chair and watch the progress bar(no offense to those who do).	St
1.6.6	The old saying, a watched pot never boils.	St
1.6.7	Decaf?	St
1.6.8	Yuck!	St
1.6.9	Do they still use embalming fluid in that stuff?	St
1.6.10	Paul	St
1.7.1	First of all thanks for the suggestions and thoughts.	Polite
1.7.2	I don't how the coffee discussion came up.	St
1.7.3	I was reading around the Dell website and it looks like the CD/DVD combo reads and burns CDs at 40X.	St
1.7.4	Games that run from the CD like Doom 3 and Vice City run a bit lagging.	St
1.7.5	It's not the system it's a 3.4 Ghz with 2GB of RAM, and 256MB Video card.	St
1.7.6	My brother had an extra burner so I installed it, and it was rather easy.	St
1.7.7	The computer had everything I needed, but I'm looking at getting a brand new one either a LG, Plextor, or Sony.	St
1.7.8	Again thanks for the help.	Polite
1.8.1	after a second read I made the connection, but the thanks for the link.....LOL	Polite
1.9.1	You could have a Cray Supercomputer and have problems if it is junked up.	St
1.9.2	Have you cleaned out all the temp and temporary internet files recently.	St
1.9.3	Ran &quot;Checkdisc&quot; and &quot;Defrag&quot;.	St
1.9.4	Things like that.	St
1.9.5	A lot of unnessary programs.	St
1.9.6	Spyware, adware, etc.	St
1.9.7	As the Beatles said &quot; A clean Machine&quot;, to paraphrase.	St
1.9.8	chuck	St
1.10.1	I clean my system pretty often with CCleaner, spyware removers, my virus software, and I have zone Alarm.	St
