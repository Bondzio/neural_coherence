8917	0	64680	767964	NR	fragile	2/16/05 6:19 AM	1.10853474E12	buying an LCD monitor	I have an old IBM computer in my bedroom (350 MHz Pentium, 192 MB RAM) that is strictly used for checking e-mail, occasional online shopping. Considering buying a bigger monitor, leaning towards a 17 inch LCD. What should I look for to make sure that if I buy an LCD monitor it will be compatible with this computer? Mostly curious about the plug-in, are LCDs compatible with old analog ports?
