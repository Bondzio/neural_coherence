i'm thinking about getting the in car router from autonetmobile.com ... but i'm not really sure... best i can tell... the main difference between it and other devices like it, is that it supposedly features some sort of special technology built specifically for your car.... or for use while the car is moving.
has anyone out there actually tried this thing out?
a friend of mine has the mifi product from sprint and it definitely does not work seemlesly while the car is moving.
is it worth the $199 ????
any advice would be great!!
!
