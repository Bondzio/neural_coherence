If you have had that computer for a while and you haven't cleaned the dust out yet, I suggest you do so.
My P4 3.0C computer dropped about 10C after using a can of COMPRESSED AIR on all case filters, all fans, and all heatsinks.
You may have to remove the CPU heatsimk fan to do a good job on that heatsink.
