Yes, I`ve used other devices both my USB ports with no problem.
The little symbol next to the time in the system tray only gives me the &quot;safely remove hardware&quot; option when I select it.
When I plug the cable for the phone into the USB port, the computer gives the little audio sound that says a device has been connected to the ort, so the computer knows it`s there, but it gives a question mark in the device managed, saying there`s no drivers, even though they`ve been installed correctly, and that has been aknowledged by the installation program.
It`s just that the software for the phone will only look for COM port 1 or 2, but it`s supposed to be a USB cable?!!!!!
It`s doing my brain in!!
Thanks again for your help so far......
