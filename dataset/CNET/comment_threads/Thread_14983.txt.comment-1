Hello ...
I have an old compaq desktop whose onboard video circuits have gone bad.
But I also have an ATI Radeon 9800 pro video card on the machine, so I figured I'd just use its display output as a substitute.
When I boot up, I get the usual bios text and the Windows XP splash screen displayed normally ... but when XP continues to load, a suddenly get a letterboxed display with about ten smeared copies of the XP logon (some even look like they are being reflected off the sides of the monitor tube) so I obviously can't read what's going or or use the system.
Although the ATI card was been installed ages ago, I obviously never used its monitor output.
Would this be a driver problem of some kind?
Any ideas how I could get back in action, short of trying to replace my motherboard?
Thanks in advance for any help.
