is a usb connected modem, then you may want to change to the combo if it offers an ethernet interface rather then trying to add a stand only router .
the built in router if a &quot;g&quot; type will run at close to 54mbps.
add a wireless &quot;b&quot; device and the speeds drop to 11mbps.
not having to run cat5 cable is the main advantage in going 802.11x.
&quot;is there any performance difference between a wireless cable modem and a standard cable modem with wireless router.&quot; i would think not.
