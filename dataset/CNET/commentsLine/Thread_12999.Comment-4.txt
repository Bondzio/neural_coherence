&gt;&gt;spyware, adware... &gt;no; i forgot to mention... it was even with a new installation of windows, and then again with a brand-new hard drive.
&gt;&gt;power source/4 pin/etc &gt;my pc has a 300 watt power supply, with a 20 pin plus a 4 pin connector for the motherboard.
&gt;&gt;updating drivers/paging size/ram &gt;well, the thing is, it sometimes even locks up in the bios, as it gets ready to boot into windows.
anyway, i think the problem is most likely either in the motherboard, or the power supply, but i haven't another power supply that has the 20 & 4, so i can't try that.
any other suggestions (thanks for those who have tried to help so far)?
