hmmm.. i just put in a new 300watt antec in and its doing the same thing.. but i have figured out what the main problem is, i just don't know how to fix it.
i can only load up windows if the driver isn't installed..and when its not installed, the first 3d image that comes up makes my monitor go in standby mode and wont come back..and then i have to restart.. i've tried 4 different drivers already..
