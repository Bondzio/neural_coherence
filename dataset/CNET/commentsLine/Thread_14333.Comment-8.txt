that might be the problem i have an athlon k7 1.2 gig chip on a k7sem board... and i took it all apart last night and the heatsink was mighty dirty... i removed the fan from the top and cleaned it out the best i could... i reseated the cpu and heatsink and cleaned the fan... there is another fan in the box so air flow shouldn't be an issue.
i'm going to go get my *legit* cd's and try again i can't give up oh and btw the memory chip is 512ddr pc 133. it should work fine it did in my other machine.
thanks for the help.
