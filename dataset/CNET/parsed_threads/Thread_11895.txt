<s> I have a Vaio FW laptop with a wireless adapter running Vista Home Premium. </s>
<s> Regardless of the wireless signal I connect to, I will be on for hours then all of a sudden my connection will be lost. </s>
<s> When I look at the switch on the front of my laptop, the light that signals the wireless (card?) </s>
<s> that was on when I first started the computer will now be off, even though the switch is still in the &quot;on&quot; position. </s>
<s> Toggling it off then back on does nothing, and I don't know of another way to get it back on aside from turning the computer off for 10-20 seconds, then restarting. </s>
<s> After all that, I can get back on the internet fine, but it will eventually disconnect again. </s>
<s> What is causing my wireless to shut off like that (could it be my network card is bad? </s>
<s> ), and is there a way I can get it to turn back on without rebooting? </s>
<s> In Warranty, let Sony deal with it. </s>
<s> Out of warranty I'll disable the internal card and slip in a stand-in wifi PC-Card and see if the issues continue. </s>
