1. add a wireless access point (wap) to your current setup.
2. replace the old router with a wireless broadband router.
i prefer replacing the old router with a wireless router.
makes life simpler and often is less expensive than a wap.
look at your local computer stores, electronics stores, and office supply stores for the major small office/home office brands (linksys, d-link, netgear, belkin).
