<s> Just wondering because the Sound Blaster X Fi only has 3 line outs. </s>
<s> I'm guessing more than one speaker channel is encoded on a line and it is separated within the speaker system or receiver. </s>
<s> Well I'm pretty sure a speaker set for PCs could do it, not sure about a receiver. </s>
<s> 3 jacks? </s>
<s> If it's jacks, then these jacks are probably in stereo (is my guess). </s>
<s> Of course! </s>
<s> Can't believe that didn't occur to me. </s>
<s> One channel with have front L/R, another will have rear L/R, and the third will have center. </s>
<s> The speaker system I guess will then decide what goes to the sub and what finally goes to the speakers. </s>
