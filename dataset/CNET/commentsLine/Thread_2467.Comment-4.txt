use the osd setting of the monitor to select or default to hdmi, instead of svga if that is the method of setting for use.
be sure if required to save that setting as well.
make sure by reviewing the manual for your monitor but a quick check of the osd should be enough.
the same applies to your pc, it may need to know where to output the video stream to that device.
i checked manual on page 3-8, the hdmi supposely works as an output from an hdmi device like a player, so it may not work as direct hdmi-to-hdmi but still the setting might be the fix regardless.
the manual does offer an adapter should work.
