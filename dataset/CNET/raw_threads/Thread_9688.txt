I want to hook up a Bluetooth GPS to use in my truck with my existing mapping software. Any reccomendations or experience with a particular card and car mounted receiver?

Since it would be surprising that I run your un-named software title I'll have to pass on answering your post. However I will share that if I were to do this I'd look for a WAAS enabled NMEA compatible Bluetooth GPS. I wonder what &quot;card&quot; you are asking about. I use a variety of 20 or less dollar USB Bluetooth dongles in my system. Bob

Add another 20 for the USB Bluetooth dongle and you're done. Just check the GPS for NMEA v2 . I'll let you research why I think WAAS is needed. Bob
