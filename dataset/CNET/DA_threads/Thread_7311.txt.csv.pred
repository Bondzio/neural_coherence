1.1.1	I know this probably gets asked all the time , but I would really like some help with this ...	St
1.1.2	I 'm looking to hopefully get a new desktop PC sometime soon , and I 've just heard a few things that lead me to question just how much I really know about picking the right PC parts , so I thought I would ask around and get people 's opinions on just what to look for .	St
1.1.3	I would like this new PC to be a great gaming rig , preferrably for the least amount of money .	St
1.1.4	I 'm a fan of Intel and Nvidia , and I would really like this next PC to be able to run games in 3D and in 7.1 surround sound .	St
1.1.5	If possible , it should play games like Witcher 2 ( new , really awesome looking games ) on max graphics , but I would also like to use it for Star Wars : The Old Republic ( whenever it comes out ) .	St
1.1.6	It should be easily upgradable ( should the need arise ) , and last as is for a while ( I hesitate to use the term & quot ; futureproof & quot ; ) .	St
1.1.7	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.8	Also , any recommendations on where to find a 3D monitor , and any recommendations on what customization site to go through ?	Ques
1.1.9	Or should I build it myself ?	Ques
1.1.10	Keep in mind , I am a beginner at all this .	St
1.1.11	Thanks in advance , everyone !	St
1.1.12	!	St
1.2.1	And you being a beginner my advice is to get it all at one place .	St
1.2.2	I 'm not happy as I read posts where folk are complaining about getting their 3D to work .	St
1.2.3	It appears there are not ways to solve their issues without changing video cards or displays so the lesson can cost more than getting a ready to use 3D game machine .	St

1.3.1	I would only recommending building your computer if you have a friend who can supervise .	St
1.3.2	I tried building my own computer , and honestly the building part was easy , it was just the troubleshooting afterwards if something goes wrong , that makes it hard .	St
1.3.3	If you 're looking for a good company to build your computer , you might want to try Ironside , Ironsidecomputers.com .	St
1.3.4	They just started selling online earlier this year , but they do a fantastic job at building computers , and their customer service is great .	St
1.3.5	At least from my own experience .	St
1.4.1	I agree with grafixdude .	St
1.4.2	I do n't know anything about building a computer your self , but I can say that Ironside did a great job on my computer .	St
1.4.3	I 've had it for awhile now , and so far I have n't had a single problem .	St
1.4.4	In my opinion it was definitely worth the money .	St
