I am deciding on an HP H8xt desktop and was wondering if I have enough power running the machine I put a 460w Power supply to run these specs: Genuine Windows 7 Home Premium [64-bit Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600 quad-core processor with Turbo-Boost [up to 3.8GHz, 8MB cache] 8GB DDR3-1333MHz SDRAM [2 DIMMs] 1.5TB 7200 rpm SATA 3Gb/s hard drive 1GB DDR3 Radeon HD 6450 [DVI, HDMI.
VGA adapter] 460W Power supply SuperMulti DVD Burner Integrated Ethernet port, No wireless LAN 15-in-1 memory card reader, 2 USB 2.0 (front), audio, 2 USB (top rear-facing Also I am considering a 23&quot; inch screen is that to big?
