<s> Hi, I have a Dell Dimension 3000 that I want to upgrade. </s>
<s> It has two 256 mb sticks in it now. </s>
<s> Can I put a single 1 gig stick in, and when I can afford the second put that in then? </s>
<s> Running XP home, 3.0 pentium 4 with HT. </s>
<s> Thanks Rick Davis </s>
<s> Your computer does not require both slots be used, so you can safely run it using the 1GB and add a second GB down the road. </s>
<s> For that matter, you can insert the new 1GB module in one slot and leave one of the 256MB modules in the second slot until you purchase a new 1GB stick. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, John </s>
<s> Keep that dual channel feature in mind. </s>
<s> 512MB@dual channel vs 1GB@single channel. </s>
<s> Speed vs capacity. </s>
<s> In the future when you go for a second 1GB stick you might have to get a close match to get this feature to work. </s>
<s> memory architecture system so a new 1GB plus one of the 256MBs should work just fine provided you buy the right 1GB DIMM. </s>
<s> Later you could add another 1GB DIMM if desired. </s>

<s> I appreciate the help! </s>
<s> Makes more sense to buy a single stick of 1 gig now, then upgrade to two as money permits.And I will keep that single channel vs dual in mind. </s>
<s> To be safe I will get the identical stick down the line. </s>
<s> I appreciate your help! </s>
<s> Thanks Rick Davis </s>
