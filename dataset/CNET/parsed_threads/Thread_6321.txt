<s> What equipment I need to do the following: I need to connect the computer and display controller who is on the street (100m distance) (LED display like billboard), by default with cable (standard cable with RJ45). </s>
<s> Now could I connect them without cable, but in such a way that from the computer (some special sending card) go cable to the BRIDGE, data is transferred to another BRIDGE who is connect with controller also with cable with RJ45 on the end? </s>
<s> Signs that the cable does not go across the street, but its cable ends out of the computer and enter the controller. </s>
<s> Transmitting video, if it is important for the flow. </s>
<s> Whats bridges and the antenna to buy for a total of $ 350? </s>
<s> Please give me a few specific model. </s>
<s> Thanks and sorry for bad English. </s>
<s> You can use bridges from dlink, linksys and others but at 100 meters expect the signal to be interrupted by rain, fog or other things. </s>
<s> Also the speed should drop to about 802.11b speed to maintain some spare space is the band... </s>
<s> The WET54G looks close but you still need a wifi lan on the other side. </s>
