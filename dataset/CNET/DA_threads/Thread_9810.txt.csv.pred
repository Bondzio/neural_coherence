1.1.1	I have a HP Pavilion 8505 , year 1999 model .	St
1.1.2	It 's having a Pentium III 450 Mhz clock and 100 Mhz FSB cpu .	St
1.1.3	It 's a Katmai Slot 1 SECC2 processor .	St
1.1.4	I want to upgrade the cpu to 800 Mhz .	St
1.1.5	But i think katmai CPUs have max 600 Mhz clock rate .	St
1.1.6	Will 800 Mhz Coppermine be compatible with my ASUS P2B-VT Motherboard having Intel 440BX Chipset ?	Ques
1.1.7	If no , then would upgrading the RAM from 192 mb to 384 mb ( max possible ) improve the system performance instead of the above mentioned cpu upgrade ?	Ques

1.3.1	I do n't think the computer is worth upgrading .	St
1.3.2	Save the money for the next computer ( be it used or new ) .	St

1.4.1	Basically i 'm upgrading this pc for improving the internet surfing ( cos ' browser is working slow ) , a lot of downloading and also some applications sometimes takes 30 sec - 1 minute to start up .	St
1.4.2	Does a change from 450 Mhz to 800 Mhz Cpu clock would improve the above or the RAM upgrade from 192 MB to 384 MB or Both ?	Ques
1.5.1	But if you 've got 50 bucks to spend go here .	St
