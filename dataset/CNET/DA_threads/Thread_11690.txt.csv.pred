1.1.1	This is what I have: Trendnet TEW-452BRP wireless router version B1.1R attached to optimum online modem(service provider).	St
1.1.2	I have a dell desktops wired (router is attached to the dell desktop), a dell laptop wired, an ACER netbook wireless- all with XP.	St
1.1.3	I also have an IMAC wired, and a Compaq laptop wireless w/Vista.	St
1.1.4	All have no connection issues.	St
1.1.5	What I want to do: I just got a Compaq DC7100SFF desktop with XP and it has a wire connection for internet but I would like to use it downstairs with a wireless card.	St
1.1.6	I called trendnet to ask what pci adapter to get for the TEW-452BRP router and they said to get the TEW-423PI 54Mbps wirelessG PCI adapter.	St
1.1.7	I went to Neweggs website and they have it for $21.00.	St
1.1.8	BUT, the reviews were not that good.	St
1.1.9	So, My question is should I get it or does anyone know of or could suggest a better adapter in the same price range?	Ques
1.1.10	I dont know how important it is the have the adapter match the router, or if it is even important at all.	St
1.1.11	I use the wireless Vista laptop in the same room I want to set up the desktop and have no connection issue with it even though it is the room farthest from the router.	St
1.1.12	When I looked at the manual online for the DC7100SFF it said there are 2-standard PCI expansion slots, 1-PCI express x1 slot and 1-PCI express x16 slot.	St
1.1.13	(Have no idea what that means).	St
1.1.14	Assume I would be using the standard PCI slot?	St
1.1.15	Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated.	Ques
1.2.1	You're going to want to know which security method you will be using.	St
1.2.2	It appears that today's thinking is that WPA2 is desired as the minimum.	St
1.2.3	Some of the bargain/closeout devices seem to offer WPA but not WPA2.	St
1.2.4	You could also go USB as these are portable.	St
1.2.5	There are mixed reviews as to whether a fixed card or USB device works best.	St
1.2.6	I've used both without serious issues.	St
1.3.1	the trendnet router and adapter card both offer WPA2 AND WPA.	St
1.3.2	I am using WPA because I just couldn't get everything to work when I tried to set up WPA2.	St
1.3.3	I would however like to have that option with whatever wireless adapter I end up with.	St
1.3.4	I am assuming that if the router I have is &quot;54Mbps&quot; I would have to get an adapter with the same MBPS?	St
1.3.5	A higher Mbps would not have an advantage?	St
1.3.6	Or would I need to know what my service provider is?	Ques
