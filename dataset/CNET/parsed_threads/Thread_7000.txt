<s> Hi, I have an all-in-one desktop PC and it has two HDMI ports but I called the manufacture and they said its an input (for gaming devices etc) I am just wondering if its possible to change and HDMI input to an output? </s>
<s> Maybe some sort of device or extension thingie? </s>
<s> Thank you for taking the time to read and/or respond to this. </s>
<s> Guesswho </s>
<s> I would say no such device. </s>
<s> What brand and model is it? </s>
<s> If the manufacturer says, &quot;No&quot;, then that covers it. </s>
<s> It's build that way, you can't change it. </s>
<s> You could however check if any installable cards offer that option to an empty slot and provides any support s/w if applicable. </s>
<s> The only HDMI item that even comes to mind to output is for HDMI TV setup. </s>
<s> Thus, if you plan to replace or upgrade the video card/port, look for HDMI as a port. </s>
<s> A quick google for GT-610 should provide some idea. </s>
<s> The messy way of doing this would be some USB adapter setup. </s>
<s> As for your current PC, the manual should readily explain what it can or can't do. </s>
<s> You didn't offer what you have, so little given to fully answer you question other than basic generic answer. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
