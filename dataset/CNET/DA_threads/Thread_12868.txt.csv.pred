1.1.1	Hi Following monumental failure of Samsung HD, I replaced it with Seagate Barracuda 300gb (ST3300831A).	St
1.1.2	In order to avoid future reinstall catastrophes, I also purchased a Maxtor (now owned by Seagate...) One touch II 200gb USB/Firewire backup.	St
1.1.3	I have Norton Ghost installed (along with NAV & NSW).	St
1.1.4	MY OS is XP sp2 with all updates.	St
1.1.5	Processor is P4 3.2ghz (ht).	St
1.1.6	Motherboard is Gigabyte GA-8KNXP Ultra.	St
1.1.7	Video card is NVidia Geforce FX 5200, Sound SB Live 5.1 I have 1 gig ram, one Pioneer 104DVD and and one Pioneer DVR 111D.	St
1.1.8	Internet is via D-Link ADSL router (Ethernet) DSL 502T.	St
1.1.9	The problem is that after a while (sometimes a few minutes sometimes hours, the computer just hangs - and nothing (CTRL-ALT-DEL even) gives me control back - I just have to reboot, which is not really good enough...	St
1.1.10	I DID NOT install the Dantz Retrospect HD S/W that came with the drive.	St
1.1.11	I DID install the One Touch software (but have not used that feature).	St
1.1.12	Can anyone see anything wrong in this setup that may be causing the lockups?	St
1.1.13	Your help would be greatly appreciated.	St
1.2.1	I have a customer that has a Dell, which I put a Maxtor One Touch II on via Firewire.	St
1.2.2	Pretty much same symptoms: erractic hangs at ramdom times.	St
1.2.3	I have gone in and made sure that the external drive is not being indexed, and turned off automatic application startup on file types.	St
1.2.4	All to no avail.	Res
1.2.5	I can have the machine up for a LONG time with many applications, and all is fine.	St
1.2.6	But the minute I access the external drive, bang, she hangs, and nothing works except power down.	St
1.2.7	Ran across this: have not tried it yet https://maxtor.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/maxtor.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=2172&p_created=1099094001&p_sid=atk_ZC9i&p_lva=&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9MjA5JnBfcHJvZHM9MywxODcmcF9jYXRzPTAmcF9wdj0yLjE4NyZwX2N2PSZwX3NlYXJjaF90eXBlPWFuc3dlcnMuc2VhcmNoX25sJnBfcGFnZT0x&p_li=&p_topview=1 Would be really curious if anyone gets this fixed.	St
1.2.8	If not, I will have to pull the external drive and replace with an internal drive option.	St
1.2.9	Thanks	Polite
