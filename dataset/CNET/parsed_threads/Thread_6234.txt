<s> I recently purchased a used dell c840 laptop/ 1,8GHZ-1.79GHZ/ windows xp pro.version 2002 service pack 2/Intell(R) Pentium(4) 1GB RAM memory /40G HDD / I have been trying to install a new extended range mini wireless card (description-54Mbps 2.4GHz TP LINK TL-WN560G Mini PCI wireless LAN WI-FI 802.11g/b Adapt.Atheros Chipset # AR5005G OR AR2413+SST12LP14) I've been trying as you see to install it on the laptop but all I keep getting is -driver not intended for this platform- am I trying to install a card that is not meant for this type of laptop???? </s>
<s> can anyone help me PLEASE T.Y. </s>
<s> Besides, why not just use a nice PC-Card? </s>
<s> That's what I use and it works fine. </s>
<s> what does a pc card have to do with a laptop mini pc card </s>
<s> That card that slides into the side of your laptop. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_card has pictures if you need to catch up. </s>

<s> are you saying that this card is not goog </s>
<s> are you saying if I change the internal pci card I cannot enhance the distance ??? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> NOT YOUR MODEL. </s>
<s> It is unsupported, unsupportable and you may not find a good answer. </s>
<s> For me I'd do my research on google.com To let you know how my install played out, I had to edit the BIOS (not trivial) and find drivers from another laptop model by the same maker. </s>
<s> While it worked out, there was NO INCREASE IN RANGE. </s>
<s> But I did get 802.11g capability. </s>
<s> The old card was 802.11b only. </s>
<s> I don't think such changes are for just anyone. </s>
<s> For example, if they complain they are not getting helped, then they should go try a PC-Card. </s>
