1.1.1	hello , I installed a 6 ( 1 internal , 5 external ) hub usb 2.0 card on my pc .	St
1.1.2	it is a PIII 800mhz , running xp professional SP2 with 752mb ram .	St
1.1.3	I thought it was working fine , but I plugged in two devices to them , a wd backup external hdd , and a dazzle hi-speed usb 2.0 memory card reader/writer .	St
1.1.4	now , when I either turn them on , or turn the computer on with them plugged in , i get a yellow baloon on the bottom right with this message ( paraphrazed ) : ''this device can work faster if you plug it into a usb 2.0 hub .	St
1.1.5	Click here for a list of available hubs . ''	St
1.1.6	when I hit that , it seems to show the ones they are plugged in ( the computer has 8usb ports .	St
1.1.7	two 1.1 's that came with the pc , and the 6 ( one internal ) that I installed and where these devices are plugged into ) .	St
1.1.8	Now , I know those devices are plugged into the 2.0 card I put in .	St
1.1.9	I tried to look online for some kind of usb speed check , much like you find for internet speed connection , to compare the 1.1 's to the 2.0 's , but had no luck .	St
1.1.10	does anyone have any suggestions on this .	Ques
1.1.11	If I am getting the usb 1.1 and could get it to work as fast as the usb2.0 , it would make backing up the computer and writing/transfering memory cards much faster .	St
1.1.12	I also looked under device manager and it does say & quot ; enhanced usb & quot ; , so that looks fine !	St
