Computer Info: p4 3.2ghz 800mhz fsb 512kb l2 cache. winxp pro sp2 2 74gb raptors on raid 0 Asus p4c800 e-delux mobo 2x512mb Corsair Dual Channel Ram Problem: A while back, i had a power surge which cause my motherboard and cpu to stop working and i had to rma it. i was also unable to boot up my comp because the bios was NOT detecting the old harddrives that i had before (2x120gb western digital 7200rpm, no raid). i finally figured out my harddrives were finally dead after 3 years(that gave me an excuse to buy a pair of raptors). now everything is working properly. i just remembered that i had about 400 pictures from a vacation to china i went on last year (on the 2 dead harddrives) and....I FORGOT TO BACK THEM UP. usually when a harddrive &quot;clicks&quot; at you....its a lot harder to recover the data. but these 2 dead drives do not make a noise which leads me to think it should be a fixable problem. it just seems like there is no power going to them. and since there is no noise, i'm hoping the data on it should still be in tact. how would i go about recovering the data i had on the harddrives?

I try the following software but won't dive into details of jumpers or proper IDE cables, power connections (some need a manual for that) then it's likely to be beyond a home based retrieval so the next stop is DriveSavers.com http://www.pcinspector.de/file_recovery/UK/welcome.htm Bob
