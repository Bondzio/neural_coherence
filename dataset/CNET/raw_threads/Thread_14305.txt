If i can play it? What resolution is best played at. In the GPU i listed above whats the difference between them? Is it performance and graphics improved. Im gonna use my previous crt monitor, would i be able to use it with my new graphics card? Does an LCD monitor make a huge difference in the visual or just aestheticly better? I cant afford a new LCD monitor. Is is still okay? Is it all compatible, the computer parts ive chosen? do i need an extra fan? Is there restriction on how many hours i can play games? Is there a lifespan for the GPU? Is there a difference in ddr2 667mhz or ddr2 800mhz? PLEASE REPLY.. IM ALL EARS???

I need it to last atleast 2 years or more. Need more feedback from gamers using the GPU ive mentioned. Please reply more, more information is needed till next years. Final decision.

Those GPUs will certainly last you two years, but do not expect to play any games at an acceptable frame rate over a res of 1280 x 720. If you try playing Crysis with those GPUs, they will be at its mercy and be ripped apart. 8500 GT is fine if you want to watch dvds and movies, but not gaming at all. 8600 gt won't give you much gain either. I don't recommend purchasing these GPUs. Are you on a budget?

I mentioned Crysis because i saw videos in youtube playing Crysis, and it was running pretty smoothly on less ram and less cpu, playable framerate. Saw bioshock, oblivion even better on the pc than my xbox360. My xbox360 had red ring of death. again and again. Blowdry trick doesnt work anymore. So i was looking for an alternative gaming.
