... you should be able to support bigger monitors at least in terms of pixels.
i would suggest you double-check, but 22&quot; level resolutions of 1680 x 1050 - ish should not be a problem.
not sure how the bigger picture will look or how it will perform though.
(btw your hp link is dead) at $200, you're in 22&quot; territory.
samsung make some decent budget 22-inchers - shop around on newegg, etc.
i'm not an enormous fan of large cheap monitors (since they tend to be based around tn panels, which results in noticeable colour changes at the edges of a &gt;20&quot; monitor when sitting in front of it), but a 22&quot; is bearable for me for the most part and i'm sure for most, the colour shift wouldn't even register most of the time.
i've used the '08 predecessor of this monitor in quad-monitor configurations and i felt it was as good as any 22&quot; monitor i've tried.
