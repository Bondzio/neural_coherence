For most of us the N speed only helps when we copy a file from PC to PC.
For internet use, no payoff.
As to WAPs, I don't use a WAP anymore since most wifi routers can be configured as a WAP.
And any router that can be programmed with OpenWRT (they have a list of them) can be turned into a WAP.
So the cost is the same as a router.

Why not duplicate what you know works?
