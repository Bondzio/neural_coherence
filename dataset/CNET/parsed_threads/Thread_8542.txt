<s> When I changed the black print cartridge,, The printer behaved as though the cartridge was empty and gave up faded black letters. </s>
<s> This was an oem cartridge, not refilled or anything. </s>
<s> What could have caused this? </s>
<s> What happens if you clean the contacts and then a cartridge from the printer maker? </s>

<s> Where are these contacts and what do I clean them with? </s>
<s> I did not see this in the manual, but I probably didn't know to look for it. </s>
<s> Look carefully over the cartrigde for copper or silver contacts and here's what I do. </s>
<s> A little alcohol on a q-tip and swab the cartridge and where it contacts in the printer. </s>
<s> Be sure to read any notes about seals you remove prior to install. </s>
<s> I don't have your printer so I won't know if yours has such. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you so much! </s>
<s> You are always so helpful. </s>
<s> Have a blessed day. </s>
