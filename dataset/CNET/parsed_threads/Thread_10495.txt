<s> Hi, I have a custom built computer with an Intel Pentium D processor, ATI Radeon X800 video card, a 250 gig hdd, and an Intel mobo. </s>
<s> My computer worked for 3 months until one day, upon turning it on, both my mobo and my power supply fried. </s>
<s> I replaced both, and it started working again. </s>
<s> However, 6 hours after it started working, it just turned off. </s>
<s> It had no response to anything. </s>
<s> I replaced the power supply with a more powerful one from a amore reliable company, and now, wheenever I turn on the power supply the computer's case fans and the video card's fan will click on for a second. </s>
<s> At the same time, there is a strange clicking noise that the computer makes. </s>
<s> What could be the problem? </s>
<s> Is it a grounding issue? </s>
<s> Or is it something else I haven't thought of? </s>
<s> Too bad, you're learning the hard way that power issues effect the whole system. </s>
<s> 3mo. </s>
<s> isn't long for a decent system to feel the effects of a poor psu. </s>
<s> You did the right thing in covering the repair, replacing both psu and mtrbd. </s>
<s> but it &quot;seems&quot; you settled on a lesser wattage unit(same value?) </s>
<s> and not a higher wattage one in the replacement process and in all probably used the same cpu, etc. </s>
<s> componets to rebuild the system. </s>
<s> A secnondary problem was lying in wait of one of the other componets. </s>
<s> You should remove all HDs, CDs, and even the FD drive and make it as simple as possible system. </s>
<s> Try then to reboot, if it fails quickly, shutdown. </s>
<s> Now, teardown the whole system and rebuild it with care to mounting posts, cabling etc. </s>
<s> back to a simple system to rerty again. </s>
<s> It need not be in the system case, on cardboard or *NON-CONDUCTIVE&quot; surface to make the system to see what the results are. </s>
<s> If it still fails, then again the mtrbd. </s>
<s> or psu was made kaput. </s>
<s> If not and it boots-up, then add &quot;one&quot; componet at a time until it fails or seems to be stable. </s>
<s> Allow it work for awhile, just leave it alone for hrs. </s>
<s> and see if it still works. </s>
<s> Return to system case if it does and proceed there one step at a time. </s>
<s> Verify all your work, etc., no guessing or taking anything for granted, if any thoughts, replace or test elsewhere. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> last fall i built two PCs similar to yours... intel 945 mobos, antec cases/power supplies, dual sata drives, p4d 3.0ghz in one, p4 3.4ghz in the other. </s>
<s> the first build went smooth as butter and booted up the first try. </s>
<s> the second one took me another 4 days because it wouldn't boot. </s>
<s> the lan leds would come on, the cpu fan would spin for a sec, then nothing. </s>
<s> i tore down the functioning pc and started swapping parts and still no luck. </s>
<s> my problem was the extra 2x2 pin mobo power connector (12V processor core voltage)... i forgot to plug it in. </s>
<s> hope your problem is as simple. </s>
<s> I already made sure that was plugged in. </s>
<s> My case fans start up and the LED lights do turn on, as well as the CPU's water cooling starting up for about a split second... then they all turn off. </s>
<s> The light on the mobo is on. </s>
<s> And it is a 600 watt power supply, should be almost excessive. </s>
<s> I did take it to Best Buy once when I got this problem... they got it to boot but I have no idea how. </s>
<s> You should check out this page which helps you understand how your computer starts up, then troubleshoot from there. </s>
