<s> Hi, I am buying an external hard drive and I heard that there are problem with portable hard drives not getting enough power from the USB port. </s>
<s> And I am not sure if my computer will supply enough computer when I checked in the device manager in Windows it said my USB port supplies 500MA and I am not sure if it's enough to supply it without out having to buy a dock just to get 2 usb ports. </s>
<s> Thanks Dell Dimension E520 </s>
<s> USB power is never a sure thing. </s>
<s> If you have a device that demands more than 1/2 the possible 500 mA then you should never chance it. </s>

<s> If I use a 2 USB connector will that be risking it? </s>
<s> When it comes to USB power, the moment you go over 1/2 the available power I must write no. </s>
<s> PCs have multiple usb root hubs. </s>
<s> there are usually two or more ports per hub and each port must share the usb power output of that hub. </s>
<s> the hubs are shown in device manager under &quot;Universal Serial Bus controllers.&quot; you need to locate two ports which are on different controllers so each port will be delivering full power. </s>
<s> plug in any usb device (a flash drive is ideal) and double click each &quot;USB Root Hub&quot; and check the &quot;Power&quot; tab until you find the usb device. </s>
<s> then plug the device into other ports until it shows up under a different hub. </s>
<s> but if you're worried, a powered usb hub will definitely give you enough juice. </s>
<s> Will any USB powered usb hub? </s>
<s> Except the issue of tapping USB power for hard disks is one where it work 99% of the time for 99% of the people. </s>
<s> You seemed like you wanted it to be 100% assured. </s>
<s> For that you can't be so sure until you get the wall adapter for power for this drive. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> just like a western digital passport will work. </s>
<s> these drives use low power hard drives (like those in notebooks/laptops) and get their power solely from the usb cable. </s>
<s> there is no ac adapter. </s>
<s> older drives needed 2 ports. </s>
<s> newer drives only need 1 port but the hub for that port should not be shared by another device with a high power draw (like a scanner, another portable hard drive, usb sound device, or a usb powered coffee warmer). </s>
<s> for most folks with newer pcs the &quot;go&quot; and &quot;passport&quot; are plug-and-play. </s>
