there are many chinese manufacturers out there.
just asking if this is required to buy the keyboard.
i use a few 83 key mini keyboards for servers and at booths to save space.
after picking up one i found more for 20 bucks at game sellers.
it's the one they sell for the ps2 that connects with usb.
while they don't tell you it works with a pc, it does and at under 20 bucks not a big investment.
