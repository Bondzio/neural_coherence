<s> Hello, I read the cnet.com review on this hard drive and it seems a good choice for my daughter to take to college. </s>
<s> She'll be using an Apple MacBook Pro with Snow Leopard, but will sometimes be on a Windows platform while at the library. </s>
<s> My question is related to the optional cables that can be purchased and which are required. </s>
<s> Their adverts say 'can be upgraded to Firewire 800', well I have a Firewire 800 cable that's compatible with her MacBook; so can it be plugged to the Seagate from her MacBook and that's all I would need? </s>
<s> Thanks much. </s>
<s> The speed gain is there on the Apple but here's the big deal. </s>
<s> Windows still has proven to be less than happy with firewire connected drives. </s>
<s> I won't vet all my answers but here's what I would use. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Said drive. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> USB 2.0 3. </s>
<s> NTFS for the file system since the new Apple OSX can read and write to that. </s>
<s> Be sure that they know to not &quot;store&quot; things there. </s>
<s> It's not &quot;storage.&quot; If there is any doubt about that, read all the posts in this forum. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I've got some more reading to do on all this and you've given me a good start - Thanks </s>
