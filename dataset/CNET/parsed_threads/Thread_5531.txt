<s> hi there, my additional keys on my keyboard is all mixed up, the usual ones still work normally, but the media keys, hot keys, and the F-keys are all mixed up into each other, such as when i press stop in the mdia keys, it turns out to run previous track, and when i press iTouch, it turns out to be decreasing the volume. </s>
<s> pls help as soon as possible. </s>
<s> if any info were needed, pls say so, i'm using win XP pro </s>
<s> You'll have to master the logitech software and assign keys as you want them. </s>

<s> the problem is, the software is kind of screw up as well, i look at the instructions, and it tells me to go a particular place, which is imposible to get there, becoz 3~4 tabs is missing. </s>
<s> anyway, i have the exact problem and the same key changes as this guy after playing cs. </s>

<s> If Logitech can't make it work, all I can share is that I also don't have a ready fix. </s>
<s> But I will share that my lessons over the years taught me to never install Logitech mouse or keyboard drivers. </s>
