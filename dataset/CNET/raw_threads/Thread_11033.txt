I have tried the power supply on another Dell system and it is working perfectly. What are the other possible courses for this problem.

Does the monitor go into standby ? Do you hear any sounds, e.g. peeps, whirring from the hard disks ....when you try to bootup ? Are the fans of the case/tower runing ?

Your Dell model, appears to have a common problem. usually, it boils down to a bad mtrbd. or in some way its not up to par. Since, you've tested the psu elsewhere, that pretty much leaves the mtrbd.. Though, i would reduce the system to a minimum setup and check results. If it still fails, replace the mtrbd. or if any warranty use it. If none, inspect the mtrbd. for &quot;bad caps&quot; google for pix on such for examples. Also, remove all drives(unplug) and check results. Other users have reported similar &quot;amber status&quot;, as you've explained. Most, have been ref4erred to a bad mtrbd. at fault(usually). As a minimum setup can you see the bios display then? tada -----Willy
