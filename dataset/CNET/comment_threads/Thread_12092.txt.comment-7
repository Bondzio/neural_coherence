You have one PC ... a desktop right ?
You originally had the 300GB with VISTA in the PC..right ?
You took an 80GB HDD, put in in the PC and put XP Home on it.. right ?
Then you connected both HDDs in the PC booting from the 80GB with XP home right ?
But...booting from then 80GB with XP...you can't see the data on the 300GB that has Vista on it...right ?
