So I just plugged it in and managed to get about 7 GB of files transfered. Then it went retarded and my comp wouldn't recognize the drive in Explorer (there was no icon for an &quot;F Drive&quot;). Well, it's recognized in Disk Mgmt, and I can now create a partition and format the X Drive, it says with a max of 93 GB. Question: If I partition and format now, will I lose that 7 GB of files I transfered earlier? In case it matters, I have Windows XP and SP2 upgraded.
