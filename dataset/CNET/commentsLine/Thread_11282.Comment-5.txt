i remember reading &quot;how to install ram&quot; and its pretty straight forward==until you try to do it.
do you just place it vertically and push down until &quot;it&quot; snaps in or do you install at an angle and raise it up?==or do you go midway inbetween and wiggle it a little?
how much pressure do you use before you figure out you have the ram backwards?===etc.
all my questions were resolved at the local fry's electronics store.
they had some model motherboards on display with ram installed.
the sales guy allowed me to uninstall/reinstall the ram sticks a few times which taught me how to do it in 30 secs.
find a store or repair shop that will let you play with this stuff just a bit.
most repair shops have a cardboard box with throw aways in it you can use.
i would say the same thing for installing the cpu cooler.
still scares me how much pressure/force it took to get the snap to go overcenter--still don't know for sure if something was off center or not==but its working.
hard drive is a bit more simple.
read up and set the jumper as described--power up--and format the drive.
easier than installing ram in my opinion.
