I have a crashed SATA drive from another system that I want to retrieve info from.
I'm running W2K, MSI mobo KM400-825 Ver 1, BIOS Phoenix 6.00PG, 512 MB RAM, Athlon XP 2500, ST 40GB.
I bought an Adeptec Serial ATA card.
It's installed with the SATA drive connected but does not see the drive when I get the prompt to hit F3 for configuration.
I've already tried 2 of the 3 PCI slots.
What can I do to make the SATA drive available to retrieve the info?
Is it possible?
