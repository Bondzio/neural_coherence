1.1.1	I have a T3312 e-Machine .	St
1.1.2	On the machine it used 512MB DDR ( 1 512MB ) , 400MHz ( PC3200 ) .	St
1.1.3	http : //www.emachines.com/support/product_support.html ? cat=Desktops & subcat=T % 20Series & model=T3312 I am going to buy SuperRAM DDR-400 , BUT I WILL ONLY HAVE ONE 512MB RAM NOT TWO ( Part Number - MPXC22D-38KT3R ) http : //www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/Reviews/Specific.aspx ? ArticleId=15049 After googling I found this as a compatible specs for ram on the T3312 .	St

1.1.5	The difference is their voltage ( T3312 - 2.6v , SuperRam - 2.5v ) , CAS Latency ( T3312 - 3 , Superram - 2-2-2-5 / 2.5-3-3-7 ) , and type ( T3312 - 184-pin DIMM , SuperRam - 184-pin DDR SDRAM ) & lt ; I am not sure about the last part & gt ; Can I install the SuperRam into this computer ?

1.3.1	Thank you for directing me to this website .	St
1.3.2	I guess the question I am asking is can you mix RAM with different voltage , CAS Latency , and if DIMM and DDR SD-Ram can work together .	St
1.4.1	comes to RAM ... I do all possible not to mix brands , speeds , timing or voltages ... I prefer to eliminate as many of the problem possibilities or incompatibilities as I can .	St

1.5.1	Well , I will take that into consideration then .	St
1.5.2	Thank you for your opinion .	St
1.6.1	over 20 years of years experience building and upgrading PCs .	St
1.6.2	I strongly recommend getting the max you need when you originally buy the system thus avoiding the upgrade and the potential mismatch conundrum .	Sug
1.6.3	Let us know how it turns out .	St
