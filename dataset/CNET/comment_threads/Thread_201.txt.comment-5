First, I read somewhere that windows wizard for networking takes into account about firewalls...regardless, I had it disabled anyway on both computers.
Your right about Magic Network..it is fickled..so I removed it.
Now, my systems were working when i had a ethernet connection, and that was done with xp wizard.
Now that i got a usb adapter wi-fi for my laptop, i couldn't get to share files or folders although they were chosen in setup.
I am able to get to the internet though.The adapter is not at fault, because me and a tech of theirs established that, plus the fact I am able to get on the internet.
I was wondering if the software that came with the usb adapter may be at fault...if I remove it, then most likely I would not be able to get on the internet also.
So I am at a loss.
