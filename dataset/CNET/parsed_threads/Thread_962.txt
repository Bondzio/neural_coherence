<s> I need to run a computer about 500 feet from a wireless router, the problem I am having is I am using a Linksys wireless router, and the signal is very weak at the ending computer I have tried range boosters, with no help at all I do have a coax cable (from a old network) running from the building with the router in it to the building with the computer in it, but cant find an adaptor to convert from coax to rj45 I also have thought about putting an exterior antenna up, but have never played with them Any ideas would be great Thank you </s>
<s> May be the solution if you have straight line-of-sight layout. </s>
<s> This is because the gain is at the cost of antenna being unidirectional -- so alignment and lack of obstruction is critical. </s>
<s> I'd look at e-bay or a large network equipment dealer for dish with correct connector. </s>
<s> You need to keep the connecting wires between wireless devices and antennas as short as pos, incidentally. </s>
<s> I'm presuming it's 10 base2 and still in good shape. </s>
<s> I believe this cable allows something like 185 meters but, if it's old, that might be a stretch. </s>
<s> If that's the case, one option might be to find an old NIC with a coax jack. </s>
<s> You'd also need a T connector and a terminator, of course. </s>
<s> Is that an option? </s>
