1.1.1	When your home desktop PC is not in use , what do you think is the best practice to ensure its longevity and why ?	Ques
1.1.2	-- Put it in sleep/hibernate mode .	St
1.1.3	-- A complete shutdown .	St
1.1.4	-- It depends .	St
1.1.5	-- I have no idea .	Res
1.1.6	Please tell us the reasons why below .	Sug
1.2.1	I am no pro by a long shot .	St
1.2.2	But I think it would just be the sensible thing to do to shut down during the night .	St
1.2.3	I run mine all day partly because I use System Mechanic for many things and it runs in the background or when I am away from the PC ... it checks the registry , drivers etc.etc .	St
1.2.4	and I seldom have problems .	St
1.2.5	Also I do n't open a lot of different programs at once only what I need for whatever I am working on at the time .	St
1.2.6	Norma V !	St
1.3.1	If you are n't going to use the computer for more than a couple of hours , I would shut it down .	St
1.3.2	The time saved by using the Hibernate function is minimal , and I 'm sorry Microsoft , but hibernate has always had problems .	St
1.3.3	Sleep is a viable option for short durations , such as an hour or less , and/or if you need your computer to be up and running in a real hurry .	St
1.3.4	But powering it down and allowing Windows to reboot when you need it , will always save you money , hardware usage , and headaches .	St
1.3.5	If you are in a hurry to reboot Windows , try a Solid State Drive for your operating system and programs .	St
1.3.6	Mine boots faster from scratch than it ever did coming out of sleep mode with a regular Hard Disk Drive , and with fewer glitches .	St
1.3.7	That 's just my experienced layman 's opinion .	St
1.4.1	Hello Everyone Actually we should completely shutdown the system if we do n't have to use it , for longer time .	St
1.4.2	because the hibernate option put effect on your memory i.e .	St
1.4.3	RAM because every system program has to be saved in the running mode .	St
1.4.4	This think on one side have advantage for memory also have one disadvantage for system which is we have to boot it when we want to use it .	St
1.4.5	On the other hand if you are not using system but for shorter time period we should hibernate because it will save the boot time of the system .	St
1.5.1	Overnight , computers at our house get shut down .	St
1.5.2	For a couple of hours , they are probably left on .	St
1.5.3	For a laptop or desktop not on a VPN , I would let it sleep .	St
1.5.4	However , if my desktop or laptop are connected to my work VPN ( a pain to manually reconnect to ) , I would just leave them on , no sleeping or hibernating .	Sug
1.5.5	Then they 'll stay connected to the VPN , although they might need to do an automatic reconnect depending on how long it 's been .	St
1.5.6	So there 's no one answer for me , whatever makes more sense given the situation is what I 'll do *smile* .	St
1.5.7	But off overnight , definitely .	St
