1.1.1	I turned off my computer and monitors (2) and when returning a day later both monitors had the power light blinking.	St
1.1.2	Neither monitor would allow me to turn it off.	St
1.1.3	The only way to turn off the monitors so they don't blink is to unplug them from wall.	St
1.1.4	When plugging them back in they start blinking again.	St
1.1.5	Pushing the Off/On button on either monitor has to no effect.	St
1.1.6	I know the PC is booting up because of the various beeps I can hear, but the power light on both monitors just blink and they never turn on so I can see anything.	St
1.1.7	Suggestions/Recommendation?	St
1.1.8	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	But you didn't share the make and model so I can't find a manual to check.	St
1.3.1	I have a Dell 1700FP and a IBM 9519-AG1 that have the same problem.	St
1.3.2	They were both being used on a Dell Optiplex GX110.	St
1.3.3	Since they are both doing the same thing I was wondering if they are stuck in EnergySaving/hiebernation mode or something like that?	St
1.3.4	We pushing the on/off button on either one nothing happens.	St
1.3.5	They just continue to blink.	St
1.3.6	No screen.	St
1.3.7	Doesn't even flicker.	St
1.3.8	Can only turn them off if I unplug them from the wall.	St
1.4.1	http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/monitors/1700FP/En/specs.htm#Power The manual does show that's how it supposed to work.	St
1.4.2	I'll let you find the other display's manual.	St
1.4.3	Hope this helps, Bob	St
