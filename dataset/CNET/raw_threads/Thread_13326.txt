And I need that much memory for video editing & compositing. So, how can I attain 8, 12 or 24 GB, as I've read some people have?
6330	5	513072	5061105	5060992	VAPCMD	1/8/11 1:47 PM	1.29449442E12	Both reference sources, Asustek and Crucial,	indicate a limitation of 4GB for that MB. Might check to see if that's a limitation of the Intel G31/Intel ICH7 chipset....and therefore your MB. MB specs show: &quot;4 x240-pin DIMM, Max. 4 GB, DDR2 1066*/800/667 Non-ECC,Un-buffered Memory Dual Channel memory architecture *Support max. 2 DIMM modules only for yellow DIMMs when over-clock to DDR2-1066 *When installing four DDR2 DIMM modules, install only single-sided memory modules. *When installing total memory of 4GB capacity or more, WindowsR 32-bit operation system may only recognize less than 3GB. Hence, a total installed memory of less than 3GB is recommended.&quot; If you truly need a system supporting that much more RAM, you'll probably need to switch to a new HW platform.
