<s> Looking to purchase a new computer. </s>
<s> I mainly do my gaming on my PS3 but would like something capable of gaming to switch it up once and while. </s>
<s> Want something that doesn't bog down when running multiple applications also. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> &quot;doesn't bog down when running multiple applications&quot; I have yet to find such a machine. </s>
<s> Maybe we'll have to wait for the next big change? </s>

<s> We know there is not an affordable machine made that won't tax you in too many ways from electrical use to spending as much as a new home that does not slow down. </s>
<s> But let's say you want a gaming desktop. </s>
<s> The easy path is to go get one. </s>
<s> Look at the video card list at http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-geforce-gtx-480,2598.html as you can scale up according to your budget. </s>
<s> As to the host PC I suggest the usual Core i7 or 4 to 6 cores and start with the usual 4GB RAM and the Windows 7 64 bit OS. </s>
<s> If you don't want to learn how to build this machine, get it ready to use. </s>
