hi guys!
!, i just want a good blu ray player for my new hdtv gp1u 1080p 1920x1080, that can be connected to the pc internally.
i dont like a lot the blu ray burner because each disc cost around $22.. its a lot of money for only just one.
so i saw this one:  , but i dont now anything about blu ray.
i know that nmy video card its a bfg 8800 gt hdcp ready, and my procesor intel e6850 3.0ghz with corsair xms2 4gb 800mhz .
thanks you!.
