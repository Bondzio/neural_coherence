It should be Cable &gt; Cable modem &gt; Wireless Router &gt; Wired desktop or Cable &gt; Cable modem &gt; Wireless Router If it's connected like this, your settings for your wireless router should NOT change.
If you have it hooked up like this: Cable &gt; Wireless Router &gt; Cable modem &gt; wired desktop or Cable &gt; Wireless Router &gt; Cable modem This is wrong!
Hope this helps.
