My question is if i bought 2 sticks of dual channel ram at PC3200 DDR. would it increase my speed by a large amount. My Specs 2.53 pentuim 1 gb ram 80 gb hard drive 480 power supply radeon 9800 pro

Then, proceed to get some benefit from faster ram, however it also ties in with the cpu as well as a good match with FSB/speed. Even, if the cpu won't help, the benefit will be there but don't expect a &quot;gee whiz effect&quot;, in other words, &quot;wow&quot;. good luck -----Willy

SHOULD I DO THAT OR PROCEED FOR DUAL CHANNAL MAMRY BY APPLYING 256 +2X128+ 256?
