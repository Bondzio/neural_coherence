In August of 2005, I purchased a Fujitsu laptop that cost approximately $1450.
With that, I also purchased a 3-year extended warranty.
Lately, I have been having problems with my ac adapter.
The connection doesn't always work and usually requires that I fidget with it to show that the battery is charging and/or that the laptop is plugged in.
I also had to do 4 system restores because the laptop kept crashing.
I shipped the laptop to Seattle for my step-dad to take to the Fry's and they told him they wouldn't even look at the laptop until I paid $200 for them to fix the ac adapter jack, including ordering a part on laptop.com.
I have a call into the manager, but it doesn't make sense that this isn't covered by the warranty, especially since it was a problem that isn't due to accident or abuse, and that they won't even look at the hard drive or run a diagnostics test because they said the problem with the adapter and whatever else is wrong are connected.
Any advice or suggestions?
