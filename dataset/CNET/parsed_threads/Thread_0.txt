<s> Greetings Everyone, My friend has a Compaq Pressario desktop using Windows Me. </s>
<s> He bought it through the phone company and it came with an internal dsl modem installed. </s>
<s> His kid recently bought a new Dell desktop using Win XP and they would like to share the dsl connection using a cable/dsl router. </s>
<s> Here's my question: Is there a way to do this using the internal modem or will he need to buy an external modem? </s>
<s> He's been a customer of SBC for several years so maybe he can talk them into a free modem update. </s>
<s> Thanks for taking a look at this post and for any feedback. </s>

<s> OOPS! </s>
<s> By searching the forums here, I have found the answer to my question. </s>
<s> I appologize for not doing a search in the first place. </s>
<s> Thanks anyways, -Ironjaw- </s>
