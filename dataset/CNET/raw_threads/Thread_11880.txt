Do you mean it went through post and then lost the screen going into the operating system? Which drive is now slave and which is primary - is there a conflict there? If the boot you are going through is because you copied the O/S, including boot sector to your secondary there very well could be.

In closing, it may help if you revealed more about what the problems were. For instance, a disturbing trend is that more people are posting they don't have antivirus software installed. In short, what do you think will happen? Bob
