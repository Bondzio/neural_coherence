If your drive is making sounds, there's a good chance that's there is a hardware issue.
IE the heads are scrapping against the platter, which will destroy the drive completely.
If the data is very important, I would definitely look at a data recovery service, which is expensive as others have said.
If you want to give it a shot yourself, you can always try the freezer method.
The chances are slim that you'll be able to recover everything, but you might be able to boot off the OSX cd and recover a few files at least.
The problem is once the freeze wears off, and it's rather quick, the drive will start to bang again, and damage the disk even further.
