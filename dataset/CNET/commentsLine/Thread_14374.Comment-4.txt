batches of media.
if other media works you have proved this batch is not good for these drives.
rare but it happens.
as to the setting.
after years of pc repairs i have yet to see such.
but i do see failed drives daily.
and owners that don't want to change the drive but want it fixed.
swapping the drive for a demo seems to only make them think we want to sell them a drive.
someday i'll find an easier way to get the old drive out and a new working one to them without all the haggling.
