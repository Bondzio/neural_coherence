Thank you for all of your information.
My PSU is Corsair HX520W I think it is not very old.
This computer is my first built and now it is my secondary computer.
I will try with another PSU and I will try to find out about BAD CAPS.
Once it started I can use as long as I like and there is no problems of reboot too.
Regards Wildbird
