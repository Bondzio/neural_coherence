i also had a very bad experience with the dell home (consumer) business model of only providing poorly trained, outsourced technical & customer no service.
i also wrote a letter to the corp. office in tx, as well as returned the pc for exchange (21 day return policy).
i received a call a week or so later.
the gentleman similarly stated that he wished more people would file formal complaints so dell corp. would listen.
enough business customers complained about the poor quality of the outsourced customer & technical no service that dell was forced to return part or all support to the usa (for usa business sales).
until dell changes their business model for home (consumer support) they have lost me as a long time business and home customer.
this is only my opinion and judging by the response here and other avenues, this is an opinion shared by many.
if your experience with dell was negative, i would encourage you to file a formal complaint with dell corp.: dell corporate headquarters: dell inc. one dell way round rock, texas 78682 united states if your experience was bad enough, you may also want to consider filing a complaint with the bbb (bbb.org), filing a complaint with your states attorney generals office, as well as joining the class-action law suit against dell.
conversely, if you had a positive experience and feel so inclined, you may want to express it to dell via the same means.
