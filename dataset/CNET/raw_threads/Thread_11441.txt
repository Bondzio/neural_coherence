Tech support and good in-home service as needed are important considerations for a non-techie like me. Any guidance would be appreciated.

See if they lived up to it. OR This is kinda sneaky but here's what I'd do. Go to the store and write down the serial number from one of the display models. Next, I'd call the company's tech support deptment. Tell them you are an existing customer. Give them the number and you are in. Tell them a horror story that your system died. Now you will REALLY see how they treat you! I hated to give away that secret because I've used it for years, enjoy!
