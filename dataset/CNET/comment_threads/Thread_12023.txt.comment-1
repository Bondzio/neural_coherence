I have a Creative SB Audigy 2 ZB (WDM) into which I have a Microphone plugged in.
I am running XP PRO in a Dell Dimension 8400.
Setting the Mic recording output to 100%, I'm having very little output, I tried a different Mic with the same results.
is there any other setting in the board to increase the output, when I want to use the Mic with Skype and any other programs I need the Mic almost inside my mouth to get some signal output.
Any help?
