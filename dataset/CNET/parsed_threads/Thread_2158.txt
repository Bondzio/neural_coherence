<s> Hi everyone, newbie here. </s>
<s> I'd like to get a wireless webcam so I don't have to have my computer on all the time to have the cam running. </s>
<s> If I get a wireless webcam can I view a stream of what is going on in my house from somewhere else or do I need to have server space somewhere else first? </s>
<s> I'm leaving on a vacation soon so I'd like to set one up asap if possible. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Go to a local box store, Best Buy, etc. </s>
<s> and tell them what you have in mind, they sell kits that should meet your purpose. </s>
<s> There can be issues with wireless set ups, proximity to router, etc. </s>
<s> so before you do this, get a bit of advice on what is best to use for your application. </s>
<s> Thanks very much, I'll try that! </s>
<s> Let me lead with just one. </s>
<s> http://www.amazon.com/Foscam-FI8918W-Wireless-Camera-Viewing/dp/B0046710G6 It's not a bad unit but you are going to be ready to learn a bit about networking. </s>
<s> If any maker tells you &quot;nothing for you to learn about this&quot; they lied. </s>
<s> It's not hard stuff but what you want is out there and about this price. </s>
