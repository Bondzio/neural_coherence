<s> Hey guys. </s>
<s> I'm new to PC building and hope to build my first gaming machine probably this coming summer. </s>
<s> I was wondering how you connect two nvidia cards w/ SLI. </s>
<s> I was looking on Newegg and the picture says there is an SLI connector on the bottom on the opposite side of where you connect it to your PCIe slot. </s>
<s> So how to I link them together is there a cord or something? </s>
<s> Also what is the highest amount you can have connected through SLI? </s>
<s> I was thinking of buying 2 1GB cards and SLI them together could I do that or is there a limit? </s>
<s> Thanks ahead for the help, Will </s>
<s> On the top of the card there is a notch where the SLi bridge goes. </s>
<s> Most of the SLi compatible motherboards come with an SLi bridge included. </s>
<s> You can get 2 Nvidia GeForce 7950GTX2 cards, which have a Gigabyte of memory and 2 chips on the one card. </s>
<s> Having two of these in SLi creates Quad Sli, and requires a compatible motherboard, power supply, a big enough case (the cards are long) and another SLi bridge. </s>
<s> Alternatively, you could buy a single 8800GTX card, for about 3/4 of the price of the Quad SLi. </s>
<s> A single 800GTX card beats a Quad Sli setup. </s>
