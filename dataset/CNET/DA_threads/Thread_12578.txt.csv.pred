1.1.1	I reformatted a hard drive, but most of the space is unallocated, and i need to recover this.	St
1.1.2	I looked into some demos of partition software, but they all seem to do nothing, just let you look, and then ask you to buy the software.	Sug
1.1.3	So is there a demo that will let me do this?	St
1.1.4	Could i also do this myself?	St
1.1.5	I'm running windows 98, what if i just adjust the virtual memory of the hard drive up to the max size of it, under the system properties performance advanced settings?	St
1.1.6	Would that cause any problems, like wipe the hard drive?	St
1.2.1	When the installer used FDISK, they answered no to LARGE DISK SUPPORT and end up with a 2GB C drive.	St
1.2.2	I think it's best to start over.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I would rather not start over, wipe the drive then go through all the headaches of installing the hardware and drivers.	St
1.4.1	It's a few bucks and will fix this.	St
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	Or a demo that will do the job?	St
1.6.1	I'll note a name but also that many crash their partition and data with such as RANISH (google.com) I can't offer any support for such dangerous items and if you lose it all on some freeware, I can't be help accountable.	Sug
