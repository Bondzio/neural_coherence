have any cordless phones that are 2.4 mh?
if so, every time the phone rings or the cordless is in use, you'll get disconnected.
also try these settings in your wireless router and see if you stay connected.
if the desktop is plugged into the wireless router, it won't get disconnected because it's not using the radio frequency.
update the firmware in your wireless router.
manufacturer's website, make & model needed.
broadcast ssid(you may want to change this to make it easier to connect) use wpa security.
most wireless devices work best with this type of security.
mixed b and g mode(n if available) use channels 1, 6 or 11. most devices work better on these channels.
save and exit.
power everything off for 30 seconds.
power everything back on, wait 30 seconds,now try to connect.
