<s> Hi i am new to this forum and wanna enjoy much and wanna learn more so please describe each and every thing very clear. </s>
<s> Let's say you are shopping for a tablet. </s>
<s> You should go to the store and ask your question of those that sell these things. </s>
<s> If they won't answer, then don't buy there. </s>
<s> Eventually you'll get your answers and maybe a nice tablet too. </s>

<s> I cannot say about the others. </s>
<s> But I owned the Asus Transformer TF101 and I really liked it, the only reason I sent it back was because I found it cheaper online and I desided to wait for the Asus Transformer Pad 300...tho I do not know if the 300 comes with GPS. </s>
<s> I didn't get the Xoom because its the oldest of the tablets, the acer was really heavy and I read some bad reviews on it as far as video playback..plus the asus had the dock which the others didnt. </s>
<s> Asus has not been the same since the bad weather in Japan that nearly destroyed the island. </s>
<s> Asus found other supplies during the difficult time when the TF101 was being released. </s>
<s> Trust me, not the same Asus quality we have known for years. </s>
<s> I sold the Asus TF101 and all it's issues basically because of the reputation that Asus &quot;had&quot;. </s>
<s> So, I bought the Asus TF201 thinking the quality problems would be over come. </s>
<s> WRONG !! </s>
<s> Where's the quality control? </s>
<s> The TF201 best points was that it made a good door stop. </s>
<s> For a few extra dollars I will buy a &quot;quality&quot; tablet made by Apple where the quality control is supreme. </s>
<s> I know they may be hard to find now but if you can find a Blackberry Playbook for $200 like they were selling for that is a steal of a deal. </s>
<s> That's a great tablet but with limited Apps. </s>
<s> a non-wifi tablet will cost $$$$$$$$$$. </s>
<s> Laptop magazine listed subsidized 3g/4g tablets in the top 10 charges you'd be an idiot to pay. </s>
<s> They took a Galaxy Tab from Verizon selling for 429 with a 2 year contract (which is 30 a month). </s>
<s> They calculated that 949 over the life of the contract and the wifi version is 448. </s>
<s> I suggest a Wifi Tablet and use your phone for GPS. </s>
<s> Now if you don't have a smartphone thats a different story. </s>
<s> I know my phone GPS helped me in Pittsburgh when the cd in the dashboard GPS failed. </s>
<s> The only way to get the best tablet is just to read all the customers reviews for each product online </s>
