have older ibm thinkpad with insufficient memory.
using win xp, with excel and word (have eliminated all data files), and norton 360. constantly getting virtual memory notices, and insufficient drive space to perform updates.
hd data indicates drive is full.
i don't want to spend the several hundred dollars for a complete new, larger hard drive, and don't have the provision for copying all the executable programs from the old to the new anyway.
i thought about getting a 1g sd card with usb adaptor and moving all the programs to it-in essence using the sd drive as my permanent drive.
a local computer repair center said this wasn't possible, but i would like a second opinion.
i am using this pc with a wireless card to primarialy check e-mail, but don't want to delete the excel/word/norton stuff to free up space.
