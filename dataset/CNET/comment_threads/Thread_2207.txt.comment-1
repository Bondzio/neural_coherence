My dvd burner broke it reads dvds/ cd and will burn cds but when I put in a blank dvd it all the sudden thinks its a cd drive and says that the drive cant be accessed when I try to open the drive through my computer.
This happened to my laptop and desktop when I was burning dvds.
I thought that maybe the drives broke so today I went out and bought an external sony dvd drive and guess what same thing.
I have uninstalled the drivers, windows and just about everything else and in out of ideas so please help!
