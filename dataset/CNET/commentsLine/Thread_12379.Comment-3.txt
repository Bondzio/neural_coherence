you could probably buy something like the adaptec 2906 controller, that is pci and works with almost all scanners....but....the cable you have may or may not work and between the cost of the controller and a new cable a replacement scanner may be the same price.
the 2906 has an end connector that looks just like a parallel port connector (25pin female) what cable comes with the 5100. you might find a used 2906 on ebay in your price range.
