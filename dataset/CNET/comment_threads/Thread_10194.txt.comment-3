If you don't have actual &quot;dedicated memory&quot; on some device, then whatever device(usually video) is using system memory for it needs.
It will use what it needs or expands on what it already has.
No matter any &quot;shared&quot; memory from actual system memory installed gets used.
If you increase system memory, do so it usually does better qand if shared presents a larger memory resource.
Don't confuse the term &quot;memory&quot; for a stored media device which in turn gets used as memory as well.
This is generally speaking some type of &quot;virtual memory&quot; on a temporary basis.
However, as already asked of you, in what way has the terms shared and shared video come to light?
