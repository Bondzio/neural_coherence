<s> Hey guys, I just wanted some feedback on the question of if I should replace my two year old Asus K50IJ laptop with the new Asus Transformer TF201. </s>
<s> I'm mainly looking for a more portable alternative to a laptop to bring to my college classes and I'll also be mainly using it for extensive media consumption, i.e. </s>
<s> video's, web surfing, games and such. </s>
<s> One of the main reasons why I'm considering this so much is that I would have a desktop at home that has Microsoft Office loaded onto it. </s>
<s> My plan is to at least be able to start word/powerpoints on the tablet and then be able to finish and edit them at home on the desktop. </s>
<s> Any suggestions/feedback would be greatly appreciated Thanks! </s>
<s> If you look at games they are a different class than PC gaming. </s>
<s> As to the Office there is no Microsoft Office for that tablet and some rushed out and bought this to learn that later on. </s>
<s> Curb the enthusiasm and do a little more search and DEMAND A DEMO of the apps that let you open Office documents. </s>
<s> I found them to be OK but no replacement for the real thing. </s>
<s> I'm back to a laptop but still have 3 tablets on my desk as we work on Android apps. </s>

<s> I have a Sony Viao that is my main computer an had a net book. </s>
<s> Well the net book was good for a time but SLOW. </s>
<s> Replaced it with an iPad. </s>
<s> My dad has Dell laptop and netbook. </s>
<s> Same problem. </s>
<s> Laptop too big to travel with netbook to slow. </s>
<s> We looked at transformer for him but he chose a HP 11 inch full laptop. </s>
<s> Has 6 gig ram and a decent hard drive. </s>
<s> He loves it. </s>
<s> Portable but able to do every thing he wants. </s>
<s> I made this move about 6 months ago. </s>
<s> At first to a net book and now to the prime. </s>
<s> I use Google apps which are not as functional as MS office but the do the job when out and about, store docs on the cloud and use a HTC sensation as a hot spot to provide the 3g connection that the Prime is missing. </s>
<s> I save docs to the cloud then access at home and if need be download and finish off in MS office (which is not very often). </s>
<s> Its not perfect but it is relatively hassle free, the number of quality 3g and free wifi connections seem to be improving and I carry very little with me as we scan all incoming mail. </s>
<s> We have recently ported our business application to the cloud on rackspace and now have full 24/7 access to our environment from mostly anywhere. </s>
<s> Benefits too many to mention, downside a change of thinking required. </s>
