1.1.1	I have 1 gb of memory currently installed .	St
1.1.2	I recently caught a nasty bug , removed it , but every time I shut down the pc , I get an error about unable to read memory .	St
1.1.3	When my pc boots up , at the dos screen before windows , it reads 512mb memory , but I know there is 1 1024 installed .	St
1.1.4	Also , windows tells me that 1024/1gb is installed .	St
1.1.5	Whats going on ? .	Ques
1.1.6	My system info is on my profile .	St
1.2.1	1024MB and 1GB are equivical , so Windows is probably displaying one or the other ( or both , either way its just a registry value that determines whats displayed there ) .	St
1.2.2	If you 're getting memory read errors thats probably a problem with Windows , you might consider reformatting , or at least running something like CCleaner to see if you can glean some of the issues out .	St
1.2.3	Not sure why POST is giving you 512MB of RAM , if its a 1x1024MB stick it shouldn't/ca n't read half of it ( unless the mainboard can only address 512MB per DIMM , which would be an entirely different can of worms ) .	St
1.3.1	I have 4 256mb modules installed , and still just the initial dos boot screen says 512 ok and windows system info says 1gb ok .	St
1.3.2	The error reading can not read memory location is random , never occuring repeatedly .	St
1.3.3	My system has been running slower recently too .	St
1.3.4	I cleaned up the hard drive and defragged , but problem persists .	St
1.4.1	I 'd suggest a reformat of the system , sounds like Windows dearly needs it	St
