<s> I have been a user of SuperDuper! </s>
<s> for some time and understand the process of making a bootable clone of my startup drive. </s>
<s> The other day, my bootable backup drive crashed. </s>
<s> It was an Iomega that had been partitioned and worked fine as a bootable backup until the drive itself failed. </s>
<s> The Iomega was a Firewire 400 drive. </s>
<s> When I bought a replacement, I bought a Western Digital FW 800/400, USB 2, eSata connection system. </s>
<s> 1 TB. </s>
<s> I partitioned it and created a bootable clone with the latest version of SuperDuper! </s>
<s> The operation went smoothly until I tried to actually boot from the newly created clone. </s>
<s> I could select the clone from the Startup Disk panel, but my Mac refuses to boot from it. </s>
<s> It looks, then says, &quot;Hmmm! </s>
<s> I think I'll start up from the internal drive.&quot; I have another WD FW 400, USB 2.0 drive and it is bootable as well as a LaCie FW 400 that I can make bootable. </s>
<s> Only this one drive that has no specific FW 400 port will not boot. </s>
<s> I tried it as FW 800, no dice. </s>
<s> I connected with the adapter cable to the FW 400 port, no joy. </s>
<s> I can return this WD drive for exchange. </s>
<s> My question is should I expect the same results if I exchange it for another drive of the same type? </s>
<s> Or is there a chance that a new drive of the same type will work? </s>
<s> PowerMac, dual G5 2 Ghz, OS X 10.4.11. </s>
<s> It has a FW 800 port as well as FW 400. </s>
<s> Thanks for any advice you can offer. </s>

<s> In SD you have the option to make the clone bootable. </s>
<s> If yours were unchecked, chances are that SD did not make it bootable. </s>
<s> I would first repeat the cloning making sure that this option is enabled. </s>
<s> If it fails, then return the drive. </s>
<s> I would suggest you get an OWC one. </s>
<s> They have a very good reputation and are portable to boot (no pun intended). </s>
<s> In fact I did have &quot;Make bootable&quot; checked both times a tried. </s>
<s> Under Startup Disk, the folder on that drive showed up as bootable, but when it came to push and shove, it would not start up from there. </s>
<s> I guess I'll switch to another brand. </s>
<s> I liked the idea of an FW800 drive, but being able to boot is the key element I need. </s>
<s> Thanks for your suggestions. </s>
<s> Regards, Ed </s>
<s> If that option was checked, then SD would have booted from the external after having finished cloning. </s>
<s> This would mean that the drive is in fact bootable and some glitch in the startup disk pane on the main computer just precludes its selection as a boot drive. </s>
<s> I would repeat the cloning (or if you remember what happened, don't do it) and see that the external is booted into indeed. </s>
<s> If this is the case, I would create another account with admin preferences and see if you can select the boot drive from its preference pane (I am not sure there is a pref file for this pane to trash). </s>
<s> If it works OK, then you have a problem with the main account and you might like first to apply another combo update (not from software update) or run TechTool Pro or DiskWarrior. </s>
<s> If nothing works, I would then exchange or return the external drive. </s>
<s> SD IS setting the drive to be the boot drive. </s>
<s> It says so. </s>
<s> The Startup Disk pref panel let's me choose the clone and SD had it selected. </s>
<s> When I boot, no joy. </s>
<s> In fact, if I hold down the option key after during startup, I should be allowed to choose the startup drive. </s>
<s> THAT does not work properly: The newly created drive does not show up. </s>
<s> If I take a different clone, created previously, and attach that to the Mac, I CAN boot from it just fine. </s>
<s> I have even returned the drive for a new one (same brand/model) and it also will not start up my Mac. </s>
<s> This is not user error. </s>
<s> It is a drive that will not boot an older Mac no matter what SD says or does. </s>
<s> The startup drive is not an account issue since it fails to start long before the account information is relevant. </s>
<s> I'm going to take this one back and get a FW400 drive like the one that will boot my Mac. </s>
<s> Since this is an interesting case that may affect others, let me ask you a question: are the other drives that boot also partitioned so that only one partition has an OS X? </s>
<s> If it was installed on the whole drive, that could be the issue. </s>
<s> If you do not partition the 1 TB but just clone the internal to it, maybe it would work as intended. </s>
<s> But you are right about the issue related to the drive itself. </s>
<s> I have a 1TB LaCie drive that I partitioned into 4 equal partitions. </s>
<s> I proceeded to use that drive to create clone startup volumes that work fine on four different PowerPC computers running 10.4.11. </s>
<s> The drive I had that crashed (prompting the purchase of the present drive) was an Iomega that had two partitions, one for the bootable clone and the other for data. </s>
<s> In every case, I have always partitioned the drives into at least 2 partitions, one slightly larger than my internal drive and the other taking up the rest of the available space. </s>
<s> I am not interested in cloning my internal 150 GB drive to a 1 TB drive that has not been partitioned. </s>
<s> Summary of what I have: 500 GB Iomega drive, partitioned to two volumes, one volume clones my internal drive. </s>
<s> This drive crashed last week after working for about 3 years. </s>
<s> 1 TB LaCie, partitioned into 4 equal volumes. </s>
<s> Each volume successfully will startup the computer from which it was cloned. </s>
<s> 500 GB Western Digital, partitioned to two volumes. </s>
<s> One volume clones one of my other Macs (a 2004 iMac) and works fine. </s>
<s> 1 TB Western Digital, FW800/400/USB2/eSata, partitioned to two volumes (200 GB and the rest of available space). </s>
<s> This is the problem drive. </s>
<s> SuperDuper! </s>
<s> will make a clone of my internal drive, but the clone will not boot the computer. </s>
<s> I intend to replace this drive with a LaCie like the one above. </s>
<s> I should also mention that in partitioning the drive, I choose the option for using the Apple File System intended to boot PowerPC Macs. </s>
<s> When partitioning and cloning, I start up in &quot;safe boot&quot; mode and have verified with both Disk Utility and TechTool Pro 5 that all drives are free of volume errors and have run repair of permissions on my startup volume before cloning. </s>
<s> for a detailed reply. </s>
<s> I agree that partitioning by itself does not seem to be a factor. </s>
<s> Your assumption about the defective/wrong drive might be the right one. </s>
<s> I and many others had good luck with OWC drives. </s>
<s> I returned the WD drive and traded it for a LaCie like my other one. </s>
<s> I partitioned it and SuperDuper! </s>
<s> made a bootable clone of my internal HD. </s>
<s> No problems starting up from the clone. </s>
<s> My conclusion is that either the WD FW800 drive will not start an older Mac or possibly SuperDuper! </s>
<s> may need to be updated. </s>
<s> I will drop them a note so they will be aware of the situation. </s>
<s> I guess another possibility is that WD's drive might require an OS later than mine (10.4.11) to be bootable. </s>
<s> I asked Shirt Pocket software about this. </s>
<s> Here is the reply: &quot;...WD external drives do not support startup on Power PC Macs, Ed. </s>
<s> That's one reason we never recommend them...&quot; That is interesting and I wish I had known earlier. </s>
<s> Recall, however, that I actually have a WD drive that starts up my wife's iMac (Power PC, 2004 vintage). </s>
<s> First, SD has been updated several times in the last two months; maybe YOUR version is old. </s>
<s> Second, I just saw something about the partitions on external drives to the effect that they may need a firmware update; see http://www.finetunedmac.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=5120#Post5120 Anyway, I am glad you resolved the issue! </s>
<s> In fact, I WAS using an older version of SD. </s>
<s> Boy! </s>
<s> Did I feel stupid! </s>
<s> I discovered my error as I was composing my email to Shirt Pocket, so I told them what I was using and asked if that might be the explanation for my problems. </s>
<s> The response to that part of my email was &quot;NO&quot;. </s>
<s> I'm going to have to take their word for it. </s>
<s> It's looking like WD is abandoning making drives that will boot Power PC Macs. </s>
<s> So, it might be a firmware issue after all... </s>
<s> I don't know much about firmware and how it might be involved in this, but I do like the fact that my new drive shows no problems starting up my Mac. </s>
<s> Thanks much for your ideas on this. </s>
<s> I hope the discussion has benefited someone else. </s>
<s> Regards, Ed </s>
