<s> Hello Everyone, I am Rahman. </s>
<s> I am studying IT first year. </s>
<s> I am a freshmen to IT. </s>
<s> I want to buy a desktop which fulfills all the needs for an IT student like large storage, graphic cards..etc. </s>
<s> I am totally confused about what to buy?. </s>
<s> I am willing to pay good price for a best configuration. </s>
<s> i want the latest one also. </s>
<s> Kindly give me your suggestions like brand, hardware configuration...etc. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Full of surprises. </s>
<s> Your IT classes may not require you to need much more than a machine with a web browser and not much else. </s>
<s> IT covers such a wide range of topics but today you might get by with a web browser, google docs and mail. </s>
<s> So the need for large storage and video cards might be for playing games, and not about the college work. </s>

<s> Thanks for your kind information. </s>
<s> Actually i use pc for programming, web designing, multimedia editing, networking, animation...etc. </s>
<s> i can afford a good value for a computer which can run the above programs and i want the latest one i.e from core2duo </s>
<s> And my heavy duty programming machine is the 589 buck HP G62 with i5 CPU, 4GB RAM, 250GB HD and simple Intel 4500 GMA. </s>
<s> I author Windows Mobile and other apps with that and it's plenty fast. </s>
<s> It's also not a desktop. </s>
<s> Animation runs fine on it too. </s>
