<s> The other day the fan in the power supply started making a noise. </s>
<s> It was about five years old so I sent for a new one. </s>
<s> About the same time there was no picture on the monitor. </s>
<s> There was a message on my monitor that said it was working to check the cable and the computer. </s>
<s> I turned the computer off and disconneted the cable and reconneted it and it was ok. </s>
<s> But I didn't want to use the computer with a weak power supply. </s>
<s> So today the new p/s came and I installed it. </s>
<s> But now I get the same message. </s>
<s> What do you think? </s>
<s> Did the video card bit the dust? </s>
<s> When I start the computer I get a beep code of one long and three short. </s>
<s> I have award bios with a AMD cpu. </s>
<s> If I have missed any need info for a answer let me know and I will try my best to supply it. </s>
<s> beep code is for bad video card.Try reseating card if it doesnt help replace card. </s>
<s> Thanks hounddog! </s>
<s> I reset the video card and now that works. </s>
<s> But now the NIC card and the usb card do not work. </s>
<s> I don't know what happen. </s>
<s> But I bet it has something to do with the fact that when I started the computer up after I installed the p/s windows started in the safe mode. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> ? </s>
