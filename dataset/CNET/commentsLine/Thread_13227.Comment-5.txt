graphics card is bascially just one little chip.
with no moving parts, unlike a harddisk, how much power would it really consume?
i've heard of people using larger powersources, but only for these really weird servers with dozens of harddisk arrays connected to one machine.
300w comes standard.
how much more do you need?
