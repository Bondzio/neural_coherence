I am in need of a new pc as my old Emachine crashed.
I believe the motherboard crashed and it seems that in many forums states that Emachines tend to blow the mobo quick.
I would like to stick to XP and it seems that my only way is to go online.
I am not a gamer only a budget minded user.
Any site suggestions?
I would like to build a pc one day but just not right now.
My only concern is that will I be able to recover my old system drive if i use it as a slave on the new pc?
Any help thanks.
Gene
