sorry but firewalls in routers is a very new thing.
and most of them tend to be uncontrollable, bad, get in the way or don't work.
i turn them off.
the second thing is that in a double nat setup, i doubt such file shares work.
enough written.
the last big thing is the issues of workgroups, accounts and more.
from the posts above i can't tell if the account names/passwords on the machines in question are synchronized.
