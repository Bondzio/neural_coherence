the nforce 590 sli intel chipset from nvidia is the last piece of hardware that i'm waiting on so that i can finally build a core 2 duo system.
does anyone here have any clue as to its release date?
i heard it had a parallel release with the conroe line (released to manufacturers thurs july 27th).
the retail release for the conroe e6600 and above is august 7th, i believe.
but i have yet to see a definitive release date on the nforce 590 intel board.
