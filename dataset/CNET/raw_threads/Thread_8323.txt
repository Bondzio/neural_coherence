I removed the 2MB drive and tried to install a new 13.6MB drive. I plugged the IDE cable labeled &quot;slave&quot; and the power cable into my new hard drive, and when I turned on my computer it failed to boot. It says it cannot detect a master drive. What happened? I never even touched the master hard drive! P.S. I'm running Windows XP.
