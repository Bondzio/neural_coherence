that combination should be fine, but you might inspect the motherboard for leaking and swollen capacitors.
many machines of that vintage had a bad capacitor problem.
as another poster mentioned you cannot play dvds in a straight cdrw, however as cheap as these drives are these days you could upgrade to a cdrw/dvd for very little money.
i must disagree with leotech about xp.
this system will run xp fine, but when you start doing anything it's going to run out of steam pretty quickly, you would probably be a lot happier with windows 2000. just as a point of reference i can legally put xp on this system, but it's an old dual p3 powered ibm intellistation with win2k, and it runs just fine.
