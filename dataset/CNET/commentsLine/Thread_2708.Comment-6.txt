i had the dlink wireless camera and there is a fatal flaw in that design.
here's the flaw.
set it all up as the wireless link and start recording.
hunkey dorey and all is well.
now, remove power to the camera, count to 10 and put the power back to the camera.
the software locked up on the pc and no more recording.
this is not worth buying.
bob ps.
i'm sure you've read the forum tip.
if you can, in the future tell more about what you are doing and with what parts, forum members can be very helpful.
as you can see, i found the camera to be a &quot;dud&quot;.
