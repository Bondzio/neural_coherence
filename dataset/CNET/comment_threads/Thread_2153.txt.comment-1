I have a linux/ubuntu box I built in 2008 that doesn't want to boot up now.
I took the HD out of it and put it in another box that I built a couple months ago.
It'll boot up in that box, so I'm assuming it's going to be something wrong with the MOBO, or the CPU, maybe both.
Is there a way to isolate it to find out what it is?
Here's everything I have in it excluding the optical drives.
XFX MOBO, Intel Pentium D processor and a Seagate 500 GB HD.
