<s> I don't have enough money to buy a new computer. </s>
<s> However, I'm looking to save a bit by upgrading my old computer with a new motherboard, processor and ram. </s>
<s> The question that I have is whether the new motherboard will fit, will the ports line up? </s>
<s> my current case is a big dell desktop case. </s>
<s> it's 600 mhz p3. </s>
<s> i'm looking to upgrade a p4. </s>
<s> will the new motherboard fit and will all the ports line up? </s>
<s> also will the power supply be enough? </s>
<s> I know that upgrading to a new case, everything will be ok. but keep in mind I'm a poor college student and I need to save a little bit of money for luxuries like food. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot </s>

<s> If you jump to a P4 system, you will probably also need a new video card if the motherboard doesn't have integrated video, a new PSU, and maybe a case fan or two. </s>
<s> If you need a new PSU, you might consider the bargain of a new case bundle that comes with a PSU and an exhaust fan or two. </s>
<s> Of course, your budget will help you make this decision. </s>
<s> Really, the only thing keeping you from easily upgrading in your existing case is if Dell used nonstandard case, motherboard, and PSU. </s>
<s> This can be solved, however, by a little modification with a Dremel-type power tool. </s>
<s> Give us some details about your current system: What Dell model number? </s>
<s> You may benefit from looking atthis discussion: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6142-0.html?forumID=68&threadID=134052&messageID=1510382 </s>
<s> You may have to spring for that case after all. </s>
<s> I don't believe that case will match. </s>
<s> Upgrading to a P4 usually requires an upgrade to the ATX form factor case. </s>
<s> The ATX standard came about when the P4 was introduced. </s>
<s> This allowed all the different case and motherboard manufacturers to standardize their product lines. </s>
<s> Not to mention power supplies. </s>
<s> And speaking of power supplies, (now don't cry) the one you have will not be powerfull enough. </s>
<s> Which is really a moot point at this juncture. </s>
<s> You can pick up a decent case for around $40 w/a power supply. </s>
<s> Good Luck and let us know. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> thanks for your replies. </s>
<s> I've been researching some information about upgrading for the past hour or so. </s>
<s> It does seem like getting a new case is the way to go. </s>
<s> What level of a PSU do I need? </s>
<s> 400 watts? </s>
<s> 450? </s>
<s> I will probably install a p4 3.0 ghz. </s>
<s> Is getting too high of a wattage bad? </s>
<s> For example, if I only needed 350, is using a 450 bad in anyway (other than a few wasted bucks)? </s>
<s> Thanks again </s>
<s> If you are not intending to add a lot of extras, ie..high-end graphics, two or more hard drives, a few USB devices, high-end processor then a 400w should be the minimum. </s>
<s> Otherwise get a 500w. </s>
<s> Excess wattage won't bother the system. </s>
<s> And very few power supplies actually get all that power to the motherboard and devices. </s>
<s> These values are pretty much the rule of thumb for those of us who build computers. </s>
<s> Manufacturers will put in the lower wattage units to save money. </s>
<s> Hope this helps a bit. </s>
