<s> I have an old HP Pavilion running XP. </s>
<s> My initial problem is that i can't connect to any wireless networks without setting it up manually via the ISP. </s>
<s> (obvs can't do that if it's a public one). </s>
<s> I tried solving that, but no luck, and now, I can't even see the list of wireless networks, even though my wifi switch is on. </s>
<s> I've checked the drivers, and it's Intel&#174; PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection - which all seems to be on and functioning. </s>
<s> I've tried updating the driver via the Intel website. </s>
<s> Having trouble with that too. </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> Is it possible to update this driver? </s>
<s> Can i install a brand new one? </s>
<s> Any other tips? </s>
<s> Thanks!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> by the way the driver is a 2006 version. </s>
<s> For example there are two issues here. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> XP. </s>
<s> Just last month we installed XP and sure enough it could not connect to our Wireless LAN. </s>
<s> Turns out XP could not work with our WPA2 WLAN. </s>
<s> There is no fix for this as it's not a driver issue. </s>
<s> After we connected it with the Ethernet LAN and let it update to XP SP3 and got a new driver from the laptop's maker (it was dated 2005) then the XP SP3 laptop could connect to our WLAN. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Can't see networks. </s>
<s> Now there is a common issue that if some took the outdated advice from say -&gt; http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/hide-wifi-network-prevent-detected/ &lt;- then you would have to enter the information manual (which you did) and then it works. </s>
<s> So here we are with a long list of issues and since you can make it work with the manual entry I have to write that all is as expected. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the response. </s>
<s> It didn't exactly help but it gave me ideas. </s>
<s> However, I solved it by doing a system restore to when it was working. </s>
<s> And now it's all good. </s>
<s> I still had the issue of the browser not connecting, but after changing some firewall settings it's all good now. </s>
