<s> Macbook OSX Maxtor External HD 250 GB I recently switched over to macs from an hp pc computer. </s>
<s> i have a maxtor external hd that went along with the pc and i saved all of my music/videos/movies on the hd so that i could bring them into my new laptop. </s>
<s> i've installed the cd that came with the hd and while i can delete/copy/bring files into my computer, i cannot add or bring anything into the hd from my mac. </s>
<s> i've scoured over google/this forum/the world for an answer and i have yet to come across one. </s>

<s> You'll have to copy out the files you want to save then format the drive in an Apple supported file system. </s>

<s> How'd you manage to see the files?!! </s>
<s> Hope you don't mind me ask, I am also riddled with a similar scenario after purchasing a MacBook Pro and selling my netback. </s>
<s> I have a military grade Maxtor External HD and I CAN NOT even seem to be able to find it when plugging it into my MBP via the USB portals. </s>
<s> PLEASE HELP ANYONE!! </s>

<s> If the OSX is dates it can't see the NTFS (file system) and files. </s>
<s> Current versions can see NTFS volumes just fine. </s>
<s> There is also other solutions like having a friend with a PC copy then out to DVD or another HDD. </s>
<s> I've used Linux (Ubuntu to be specific) to connect 2 HDDs, one in NTFS and the other in AFS and drag the files over. </s>
<s> MacFUSE is worth some research if your OSX is outdated. </s>

<s> My macBook Pro is BRAND NEW up to date. </s>
<s> I had Windows XP on my Netbook, and this sucks. </s>
<s> lol The situation, that is. </s>
<s> Something's amiss. </s>
<s> Try Cnet's Apple forums. </s>
<s> Here it just worked. </s>
<s> On the new machines NTFS just works. </s>
