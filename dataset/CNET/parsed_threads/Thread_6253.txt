<s> There have been a number of thefts and some vandalism in my neighborhood. </s>
<s> In fact my Hobby Truck was broken into and several high-dollar radio control planes and transmitters were removed. </s>
<s> I would like to do some sort of video surveillance of my driveway, recording to a hard drive. </s>
<s> Wireless would be ideal since this would have to mount over the garage door and is on the other side of the house from my office. </s>
<s> What I would see as ideal is maybe a motion sensor that only records when theres activity, and I would like to be able to have it run passively on a spare PC, logging onto a hard drive Do you know of anything turn-key that would do this? </s>
<s> Or is there some way I can cobble something together that will get me there? </s>
<s> Im running WinXP Pro on some homemade boxes- willing to install large HDs if needed. </s>
<s> Thanks for considering this. </s>

<s> If you don't want to cobble such together try geeks.com and newegg.com These surveillance items now cost a fraction of what they used to years ago. </s>
