jrmar explained it pretty well and how the emachine lcd flat panel monitor works with dvd.
high end gamers prefer the old crt flat screen monitors over lcd as they claim faster response.
recently i have read that lcd monitors have improved and the ones with 8mn response time is not that bad.
the 15&quot; emachine e15t4 has 16ms response time with 1024x768 max resolution.
newegg has an acer 17&quot; ali714cb-8 with 8ms and 1280x1024 max resolution for $229.
the samsung 19&quot; 915n with 8ms and 1280x1024 resolution for $400 is also nice.
