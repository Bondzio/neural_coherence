I have tried adjusting the resolution of the laptops and the projectors - no joy! To prove the issue, I finally disconnected the laptop from the projector then restarted it with the laptop still disconnected - the result is that the projected 'image' is still badly pixelated. To my non-techie brain this shows that the problem is with the projector and not the laptop. The possible soutions are to either repair or replace the projectors - methinks the latter will be quicker and cheaper and a lot less heartache considering we have three courses starting on Monday!!!! Any advice would be greatly appreciated!! TB

If you happen to still have warranty on them, I'd call them also. If you don't, I'd call the shop where you bought them or Optoma tech support to see what they advice. Kees
