I loaded the CD in the new computer, but nothing happened to indicate anything was happening? I know the CD is good because it is a back up and was used to load from before. I'm new at this operation!!! Thanks much.

God the job done. The strange thing was. the first one I tried and pictures and other files on it. The only thing that come up for loading was the pictures. No folders! That is what was driving me crazy. I like to get answers!!! But thanks!!!
