part of my problem right now with the asus setup is it no longer will boot.
the mb does not post any clear message as to the problem and i have no keyboard and/or monitor.
i did you and external device to check the output of the antec neo 650p and 550s power supplies and they checked out ok. as far as what i would like to use with the new intel mb i am considering the option below.
