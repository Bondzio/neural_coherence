<s> Trying to rule out power supply and video card , before motherboard. </s>
<s> I followed instructions in another thread about measuring voltages with the computer on. </s>
<s> The 12v and 5v rail checked out OK. </s>
<s> I was not able to find an AUX connector. </s>
<s> Is there a 3V aux with my computer? </s>
<s> e machines T6420 Athlon 64 3400+ Here are the symptoms: On a few occasions, my computer would kick into a mode with the fans racing after I walked away for an hour or two. </s>
<s> (had to hold power button in for 10 seconds to turn off) Sometimes the screen saver would be frozen also and I detected sounds. </s>
<s> I turned off the hibernate mode thinking that might be causing this glitch but it recurred again with the fans racing. </s>
<s> The last time this happened I turned the computer back on and the fans stayed in this racing mode and the screen remained black. </s>
<s> (Won't boot} The video is nVidea GeForce 6100 and I assume this is built in as there are no other cards. </s>
<s> Could this be why I have no monitor (amber light is on) yet monitor works with my other computer? </s>
<s> Would putting another video card in the open pci slot bypass the built-in video? </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> sounds more like a mobo problem to me. </s>
<s> have you tried clearing your cmos and booting from default settings (i doubt if it will help but if its a bad mobo there's not much you can do besides replace it). </s>
<s> Your fans run on 12v. </s>
<s> The 3.3v are for the processor and memory. </s>
<s> Look for &quot;bleeding&quot; capacitors. </s>
<s> You PSU is probably not the problem. </s>
<s> And neither is your video card. </s>
<s> Sooooooo.... guess that leaves the mobo. </s>
<s> Sorry. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> How do I check for 3.3V AUX as I don't see a connector like that to test? </s>
<s> What exactly am I looking for with a bleeding capacitor. </s>
<s> Is this a visual check, and what will you see? </s>
<s> Pictures galore... </s>
<s> Thanks R. Proffitt, I found no leakage or expansion so at least visually they look OK. </s>
<s> This board is 1 yr. old though I understand it can happen with new ones too. </s>
<s> How do I check for the 3.3V to the CPU as that's the one voltage I haven't been able to check. </s>
<s> In another thread, someone posted a link with pictures showing how to check these voltages but it failed to discuss the details about the AUX if mine actually has one? </s>
<s> There are 2 connectors from the power supply to the board. </s>
<s> How would you know if it's the CPU or the motherboard if that is the problem? </s>
<s> How would you know if it's the CPU or the motherboard if that is the problem? </s>
<s> Sadly you need a good board to test the CPU on. </s>
<s> Power supplies are thankfully plentiful at the shop bench. </s>
<s> -&gt; About the other items. </s>
<s> Be sure to check the CMOS battery voltage too. </s>
<s> On some boards if it's too low, the board never comes out of reset. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Battery voltage was 3.3 for a CR 2032. </s>
<s> After doing this I read you need to write down settings which I didn't do. </s>
<s> Of course the system is not booting up anyway and the monitor is blank. </s>
