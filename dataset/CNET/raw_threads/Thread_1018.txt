The computer has 2 GB of DDR2 667 memory. I want to add a Graphic Card to the configuration . Now my question is if I add a Graphic card of the Nvida 2 series like the 240 , will the Graphic card confict with the configuration because of the ATI Xpress 200 chipset ? Is it best to stick with the ATI brand of GPUs ? Actually a few years ago , we were assembling a PC with Core 2 Duo E6600 processor , Intel Motherboard with 965 chipset , 4 GB of DDR2 RAM and a 8400 GT graphic card . There was a conflict between the Graphic Card and the Intel 965 chipset motherboard . The motherboard and the graphic card was sent to their respective support centers , but it was said they were working fine ( We suspected that either Mobo or G-card was having a problem ) . Finally the problem was sorted out by swapping the Intel 965 mobo with a XFX NForce chipset mobo , and till date the configuration works like a charm . So my question is , will I be facing any compatibility issues if I pair a Nvidia GPC card with a ATI Xpress Chipset motherboard ? Or is it is best to stick to a ATI GPU card with a ATI Xpress 200 Chipset ? Thanks for reading Sam

I would dismiss any 8400 troubles and move forward. Then again I have a friend that tries to overclock and constantly has issues. Go figure. Bob

I want to know if you have encountered any issues with the NVIDIA 240 GPU and ATI Xpress 200 chipset . I have configured PCs with Intel G31 and G41 chipsets as well as the X58 chipset ( Intel X58BP server board ) with NVIDIA GPUs cards ; No issues at all . I am just asking because I have no experience with the ATI Xpress 200 chipset . Thanks Sam

No.	And the Nvidia card with the 240 which I have has never given me any sign of trouble but it's on some Intel chipset. I guess you can google it but keep in mind I can bet somewhere someone had trouble. And then with each card, someone somewhere reported trouble. My card has (keeping it to my hardware) been in the HP d4999t and d5000t without issue. Bob
