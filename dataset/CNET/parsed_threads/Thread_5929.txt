<s> Having a problem surfing the internet on a hp dv1000. </s>
<s> If I unplug the ac adapter the pages take forever to load, but it works just fine if it is plugged in. </s>
<s> HP seems to think it is a defective battery, but never have seen such a problem. </s>
<s> Any help? </s>
<s> And is there SPYWARE on this machine? </s>
<s> I don't see a hardware issue yet. </s>

<s> There is no spyware on the machine. </s>
<s> It now won't let me download anything. </s>
<s> If the power cable is plugged in I can, but if it is unplugged it won't let me download. </s>
<s> I have a Toshiba laptop. </s>
<s> The ethernet port will not work if the AC is unpluged, it will only work it the AC adpter is pluged in. </s>
<s> I guess you HP is the same way. </s>
