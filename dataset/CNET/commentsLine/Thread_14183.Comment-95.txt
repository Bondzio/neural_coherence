well, i started very early, my first pc was an 8086 from ibm, 64k of memory, cga display and a low density diskette unit.
lol, then my father buys a ibm pc286, of 8mhz and 640k of memory, then some years later i changed to a ibm 386mhz, hdd of 60mb, an 4mb of memory and as a showing of riches lol, we set it with an adlib gold sound card.
