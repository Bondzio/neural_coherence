do you have enough power, is what i am asking.
3 new drives that all click?
something doesn't add up.
maxtor is well known for being quieter than its competion.
another poster said remove one.
i would remove two then try it.
how new are they?
are they new from ebay?
drive that were dropped to the ground have little chance of lasting long, although they could work for a while.
