i did several tests with occt and latencymon when i do 100% load to cpu or 100% load to gpu it's working fine when using 100% load on both the same time i got frame rate drop in spikes and hiccups on the 3d rendering i did a latency test with latencymon.
it was actually ok i even got less latency under heavy load then with normal use of pc switching between programs gives a short high latency spike though in short how can i make the hiccups and framerate drops dissepear?
