1.1.1	Hello everyone , I 'm just looking to upgrade from my old computer to something a little more modern .	St
1.1.2	I mostly use the the computer to browse the internet and play games .	St
1.1.3	I 'm not looking to spend too much on a new PC but this is the best deal i have found : DELL XPS 420 PROCESSOR : Intel Core2 Q6600 Quad-Core ( 8MB L2 cache,2.4GHz,1066FSB ) OPERATING SYSTEM : Genuine Windows Vista Home Premium with Digital Cable Support MEMORY : 4GB Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM at 667MHz - 4 DIMMs HARD DRIVE : 500GB - 7200RPM , SATA 3.0Gb/s , 16MB Cache OPTICAL DRIVE : Blu-ray Disc Combo ( DVD+/-RW + BD-ROM ) MONITORS : No Monitor VIDEO CARD : 512MB Nvidia GeForce 8800 GT SOUND CARD : Integrated 7.1 Channel Audio TV TUNER & VIDEO XCELERATOR : Hauppauge HVR1250 Hybrid TV Tuner and Remote KEYBOARD : Dell USB Keyboard MOUSE : Dell Optical USB Mouse BLUETOOTH AND MEDIA READER : Dell 19 in 1 Media Reader with Bluetooth FLOPPY & MEDIA READER : Dell Media Card Reader included in Dell Bluetooth Package WI-FI AND MODEM : 56K PCI Data Fax Modem All this runs for $ 1,214.92 with taxes and shipping .	St
1.1.4	Tell me what you guys think .	St
1.2.1	Good deal , I am seriously considering purchasing that machine .	St
1.2.2	I would recommend a downgrade of the RAM from 4gb down to 3gb ( Windows 32bit can only use a maximum of 3.3 gb ) .	St
1.2.3	And I noticed that you 're & quot ; upgrading & quot ; from the original 3gb that runs at 800Mhz , the 3gb at 800Mhz is more suitable for gaming .	St
1.2.4	Also , keep in mind though , that there have been numerous Dell threads that talk about how the eSATA port does n't work .	St
1.2.5	It 's fixable , but the current solution is a complete clean reinstall of Vista .	St
1.2.6	If that 's not a huge problem for you , then this deal definitely looks really sweet .	St
1.3.1	I 'm going to decide on this config by the end of the day ... yes or no ... hmmm..

1.4.2	They do offer their XPS 210 computers with XP .	St
1.4.3	I 'm going to call them today to see if they 'll make an exception .	St
1.5.1	yeah the eSATA is n't really a big deal for me .	St

1.7.1	Just finished chatting with the Dell guy .	St
1.7.2	Getting this computer with XP just is n't an option .	St
1.7.3	Does anyone have any experience installing XP on this computer , or is it a & quot ; Vista & quot ; Centric computer ?	Ques
1.8.1	i remember somebody telling me that one can install both OS on the same computer and that you get the option of choosing whether you want to use XP or vista .	St
1.8.2	I remember reading that somewhere a long time ago .	St
1.8.3	Anybody know if i right or wrong ?	Ques
