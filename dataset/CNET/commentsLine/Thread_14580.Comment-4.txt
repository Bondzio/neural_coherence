as you can see in the previous message, i just bought this samsung 215tw at bestbuy for $545 plus taxes and since i didn't see any reviews on this and bought it on the blind, i'm going to share my thoughts and impressions on this unit for your benefit as i think it might help you buy your lcd.
my first impression was, &quot;pretty solid display&quot;.
it did not come with any dead pixels or back light bleeding.
i haven't calibrated it yet, but from what i can see it won't require any major adjustments.
the screen displays crisp, well defined images.
max resolution is 1680x1050.
text is very readable as my wife pointed out since she does a lot of word, typing, etc.
you can fit two word, or windows in it without a problem and it's very readable.
as i'm typing i'm standing about 3 to 4 feet behind it and it's as good as it can get.
its base holds the monitor securely and it doesn't vibrate as you adjust it.
its height is decently adjustable, it tilts front and back, and it also rotates to the vertical, and i mean vertical, unlike some gateway reviews i've seen.
all the menu buttons are on the front of the display, all its inputs/outputs are on the back and side for the extra audio/video/composite.
it doesn't come with any usb ports if you're looking for that feature.
it does come with the dvi cable, although it's not gold tipped, and the vga one.
it also comes with a cd that contains drivers, rotation software which works perfectly, and a color/mode tool.
it also has built in speakers that are decent for very basic ops.
if you want something decent get it separately.
what else.
set up was easy and i' going to paste information that came with the cd for specs on the unit and i hope this helped you decide.
