Someone I know needs a good cheap laptop printer.
The price for cartridges is also important.
So important that the next time I buy a printer I'll make my decision based on the cost of ink cartridges then choose the printer based on this information.
Recently my wife and I made a visited Walgreen's where they refill cartridges for less then new ones can be bought.
$5.00 less.
