sorry about your loss.
never have only one copy of anything stored digitally if at all possible.
i have so many photos that i could not keep them all on my laptop.
moved them to two different external drives, so there are two copies.
one of the drives is portable and i carry to work each day...just per chance something happens at home.
next step is to burn to dvds...over 50 gb of data, so that will be at least 10-12 full dvd-rs.
but after hearing your story and others, i'm going to spend the time doing just that.
of course, the dvds have a shelf life too!
as to toshiba's liability: i'm afraid that no drive maker eve warranties against loss of data, only the repair/replacement of the hardware.
