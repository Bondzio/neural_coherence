I have found these two PSU's. The PC C&C Silencer 750 Quad ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817703009 ) and the Rosewill RX950-S-B ATX ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817182096 ) I can get the Rosewill for a deal with the processor I am getting (the Intel Quad Core Q6600) for $120 where as the PC C&C PSU will be $170. I want to be able to use it with my Quad core and two Nvidia 8800 GT video cards using and XFX nforce 680i motherboard ( http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8434385&type=product&id=1182557691186&ref=09&loc=01&srccode=cii_5766179&cpncode=09-44158805-2 )which one is better in the end and will meet my requirements and I would prefer that no one just tell me that the Rosewill is better since the wattage is higher on it. I also should say that I noticed that the efficiency on the PC C&C is 83% and on the Rosewill it is 75%. If you could reply ASAP that would be great since I am pressed for time. Thanks, Chris

Already got the MB ? Heard there we some issues with the 680i chipset MBs with the Q6600. Maybe it's only the eVGA MB For more ref on PSU.....go to http://www.jonnyguru.com VAPCMD

Also, I looked online for conflicts between the motherboard and the processor and I could only find issues with and older version of this motherboard by the looks of it. Am I incorrect? Can you find me something on this if possible? Thanks, Chris

I just heard/read mention of it...I'm thinking it was the eVGA version. If it were me...I'd try the MB mfgs site and see if they have a forum on MBs and specifically a forum on the MB you want. Usually lots of good info re user problems with their boards. Another MB option worth looking at is the Abit IP35 Pro ....I've read some good tech eval ratings and 245 buyer reviews on Newegg where 83% were 5's and 11% were 4's. Let us know. VAPCMD

Also, if possible I would like to add a physics accelerator. Lastly, what does &quot;MB mfgs&quot; mean, and where is there site? Thanks, Chris

I looked but did not see a user forum on the Abit site...bummer. Asus has good user forum for posting questions about Asus products by type....such as by motherboard and model number. Very good for pre purchase product review or troubleshooting. VAPCMD PS . . . Just double check re the Quad Core and the 680 chipset MBs. Good support for Dual Core.
