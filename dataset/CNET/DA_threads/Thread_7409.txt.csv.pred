Ques
1.1.2	Does it matter ?	Ques
1.1.3	I know the price difference is insignificant .	St
1.1.4	I am currently using a 8 yr old HP Pavillion with upgraded XP 850 Mhz 256 MB I had ME and it was a complete disaster !	St
1.1.5	I do not want to go through it again with Vista .	St
1.1.6	I guess I need reassurance that it 's a good OS or stay with my trusty XP .	St
1.1.7	Any advice ?	Ques
1.2.1	XP was suppose to be out of the picture by now but Vista still has issues and thus being offered .	St
1.2.2	If you want Vista , get it , if not and far more stable use XP .	St
1.2.3	As for the dual optical drive , you can always add that later , even Vista should you need to provided you went with the XP system .	St
1.2.4	The difference is n't that great and IMHO , you 'll be more happy with XP based system .	St
1.2.5	Dell , is also having some problems with Vista itself for whatever reason as least it seems so .	St
1.2.6	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	But for those with old printers , cameras , scanners it will be .	St
1.3.2	You may find my posts about & quot ; Vista is the new Windows ME & quot ; which is turning out to be true for those that have old gear .	St
1.3.3	If you do n't have the old baggage then it 's usually OK with just a few tweaks ( and 2GB RAM ! )	St
