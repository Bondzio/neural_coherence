my recommendation is to take the windows 7 laptop and connect the modem to the laptop and put a wireless router onto the laptop.
i would recommend you do this with the windows 7 laptop as it will be able to keep up with the xp laptop but not the other way around.
next you attach the xp laptop to the win 7 laptop, the wireless router should automatically discover and configure the connection for you and you should not have to do anything.
