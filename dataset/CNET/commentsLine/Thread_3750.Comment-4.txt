i built my own and they have no junk software, which frees up plenty of space.
i started using good dependable free programs that are not invasive, such as opera and open office on a mepis/linux platform.
everything works fine now.
haven't had a virus.
however; my son bought a new hp with xp.
it took hours to clean out the useless garbage and it was set up to connect and share automatically, including allowing remote access.
this means i sure that i have missed some that ms and norton wanted me to overlook.
as a note: i have purchased 3 laptops and at least 6 desktops for my personal use.
i have programmed in everything from cobal and fortran to c++.
maybe you are not aware how exposed you are as a user?
