i have a system that was gutted by a friend, and i am wanting to turn it into a 'new' desktop system for home.
it was originally a server that they used, with dual processors (2 - amd 2ghz).
like i said, they gutted it, and left only the motherboard, processors, case, fans.
i tried flipping it on, to see if it was even worth messing with, and after only 1-2 seconds, the fans shut down, and a led came on in the middle of the mobo, signalling that it was overheating.
i pulled the heat sinks off(dual processors, remember), put new thermal grease between them and the processors, and tried to start it up again...no difference.
it still shut down after 1-2 secs, and the overheating light came on.
i was going to buy ram/hdd/etc, but if it won't make it more than 2 secs, i figured it would need some more help.
any suggestions, or should this be 'retired'?
system specs: (not much right now!)
dual amd socket a processors, 2 ghz (amsn2400dkt3c) mobo: gigabyte ga-7dpxdw-p 450w power supply, 4, 80 mm fans in case
