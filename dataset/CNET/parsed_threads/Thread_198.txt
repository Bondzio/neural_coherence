<s> from what I understood so far, it's the mobo that decides if there's triple channel or dual channel. </s>
<s> with RAM memory it just means you have a kit of 2 or 3 same sticks. </s>
<s> My question is: if I buy 3 triple channel kits (9x 2gb in total) and use 4 sticks in one dual channel board and other 4 in another dual channel board, would they be running fine? </s>
<s> ( i will sell the remaining 1 stick) or should I just buy kit with even number of sticks to be on safe side? </s>
<s> it's these 2 kits: http://www.corsair.com/cmx8gx3m4a1333c9.html this is 8GB (4x2GB), i'd buy 2 kits http://www.corsair.com/cmx6gx3m3a1600c9.html this is 6GB (3x2GB), i'd buy 3 kits and sell 1 stick afterwards PS: i know one is 1600 and one 1333. </s>
<s> The memory distribution will be 4x2GB in P5Q3 and 4x2GB in P5P43TD/USB3. </s>
<s> what do you recommend? </s>
<s> thanks for advice </s>
<s> the idea of these RAM memory kits is that all components in it are tested to be as nearly identical as possible. </s>
<s> This would mean that putting all three sticks from one kit and then putting a stick from another kit could have one odd stick. </s>
<s> I've personally had no trouble with dual channel systems buying two sticks of the same PN RAM rather than in kit form but, technically, that's the idea of the kit. </s>
<s> So, popular advice would be to buy what's made for MB and do check with the MB manufacturer for RAM that's been certified as compatible if you want the best results. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> for the MBs they're going in ? </s>
<s> Would they be ASUS P5Q3 and P5P43TD/USB3. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> the 1333 4x2GB kit is listed in supported, the 1600 being triple channel obviously not. </s>

<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231440 Personally if I was adding RAM I'd consider 2 @ 4GB if the RAM voltage was std (1.5V) and timings are tight like the GSkill above. </s>
<s> No point buying a Triple Channel Kits with all the Dual Channel kits packages available. </s>
