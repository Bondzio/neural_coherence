<s> I'm looking to get a new wireless router because I'm upgrading my internet speed (it's going to be at 12Mbps) and want to take advantage of it. </s>
<s> So far I've looked at a limited number of them, and the main one that has caught my attention is the Netgear Wireless-N Router WNR2000. </s>
<s> I don't want to spend much more than $100, but I want to make sure I get one that will allow me to seemlessly do everything I want (use internet, watch movies through netflix with GOOD quality, HD movie streaming, gaming, etc.). </s>
<s> Would this Netgear one be good enough to handle that? </s>
<s> Or does anyone have any other suggestions that they know would handle all this? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Mine is setup EXACTLY like this forum's sticky tells us. </s>
<s> Latest firmware, default settings, then WPA. </s>
<s> It has run for months without a reboot except for those pesky power outages. </s>
<s> Downstairs (the router is on the top story as basements are a bad idea) a simple lenovo y530 with hdmi can play hulu via hdmi to the hdtv. </s>
<s> And this with the wifi set to 802.11g mode only. </s>
<s> So is that your hd answer? </s>
<s> What else? </s>

<s> Even wireless G is rated more than 4X what you'll get over the internet. </s>
<s> N is only going to (potentially) improve LAN speed where a wired connection isn't practical. </s>
<s> I have a Netgear WNDR3700 wireless router that I really like. </s>
<s> I had read great things about it, and it has lived up to it's billing. </s>
<s> I've had it since about November of last year, and have not needed to touch it since. </s>
<s> Totally reliable, very fast, and the mixed wireless g and n approach that they have is great. </s>
<s> In fact, my daughter is living here with us while she finds her own place after graduating from college and getting a job, and she has her new desktop computer in her bedroom. </s>
<s> I just happen to have a Netgear WNDA3100 USB adapter lying around, and am using it on her desktop (wireless n, 2.4GHz. </s>
<s> ), and it is just like a hard-wired connection for her. </s>
<s> My other daughter has a laptop that uses wireless g, and they can both use wireless at the same time with no problem. </s>
<s> I also had some visitors the other day and finally set up the guest network for them in about 2 minutes, and they used that (an iPad and a Mac laptop). </s>
<s> Oh yeah, the wireless is excellent throughout my house, even where I had problems with my old Linksys WRT54GS...I've got nothing bad to say about the Netgear WNDR3700, it has been excellent for me...I had tried a couple of other wireless n routers which had not worked as well, the Linksys WRT310N just didn't work right, and DLink DIR-655 was fine but not nearly as fast as the Netgear, and was a single-band router as well. </s>

<s> They're all good, but I prefer the D-Link routers for several reasons that include their performance, their user interfaces, their ease of setup, their versatility, their rock-solid reliability, and most importantly their absolutely SPECTACULAR customer support. </s>
<s> I personally use a D-Link DIR-655 which reaches every corner of my rather large, three-story home with excellent throughput. </s>
<s> As with most routers nowadays, when wired it serves as a gigabyte switch. </s>
<s> I got mine very soon after their introduction over three years ago now and it has never suffered as much as a hiccup requiring a reboot. </s>
<s> But understand that any router, even old 80211.G routers (please get an 80211.N -- it really makes an ENORMOUS difference), can swallow a 12MBPS network connection -- or MUCH faster than that -- without a hitch. </s>
<s> Your router will NOT be the choke point effecting Internet performance. </s>
<s> Please note that my preference for D-Link in my own home and my recommendation of them to others is what a lawyer would call a &quot;statement against interest,&quot; in that I own stock in Cisco, manufacturer of LinkSys home routers. </s>
<s> I am sorry but.... </s>
<s> I would never buy another Netgear. </s>
<s> I have had problems with mine and the tech support I had with them was horrid! </s>
<s> I almost just forgot about accepting the new one and bought a different brand (after hours of trouble shotting...of which they finally decided was defective). </s>
<s> It was such a terrible experience I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. </s>
<s> I actually had laryngitis when I called and the tech insulted me..and all senior citizens...thinking I was OLD and incapable. </s>
<s> My son also has similar problems with his and has to unplug the router and wireless and plug back in on a very frequent basis. </s>
<s> My experiences was just the opposite of yours. </s>
<s> I went though 3 Linksys wireless N routers in two weeks and had to reset them every couple days to keep them working. </s>
<s> Took those back and picked up the Netgear WNDR3700 router, hooked it up and never looked back. </s>
<s> Best router I have owned. </s>
<s> There are lemons in about everything you buy now, you just have to be lucky and not get one of them and be forced to call their tech support. </s>
<s> an inexpensive alternative would be the Netgear WGR614. </s>
<s> It's a wired/wireless router, b/g but it cost only $29.99 at my local Shack. </s>
<s> I had mine up and running w/ 3 laptops and two desktops within 2 hrs. </s>
<s> (OK, so I took the long route and maybe did some browsing to 'test' the connection) and there hasn't been a hiccup yet. </s>
<s> Netgear stuff is fairly solid (IMHO) and I couldn't beat the price. </s>
<s> Example at http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=torrent+614+router Sorry I can't suggest that model. </s>
