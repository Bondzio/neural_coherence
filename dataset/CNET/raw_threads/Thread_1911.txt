2450	0	380194	3231930	NR	Lisa Holz	1/26/10 5:16 AM	1.26448296E12	Mouse problems	I am running Widows XP with a Logitech wireless mouse. I have deleted and reinstalled my mouse driver that windows chose, installed logitech driver, ran Norton Antivirus and other spyware & malware programs and nothing has solved my problem. I have also dropped my mouse from device drivers and rebooted my pc and this did not help. I used another mouse, problem still present. When I boot windows, I am unable to click on the desktop icon of my choice, only the first icon is highlighted no matter what icon I click on. When I click on my start menu, only the top icon will highlight. I can start the 2nd, 3rd and so forth by right clicking to lauch that program. I can make the problem stop by doing a search in google (my default home page) and then I can select any icon on my desktop or start menu icons. I can also add that if I go directly to a web site without searching, my mouse can not scroll using the scroll wheel. Also if I open up advanced search in Google, the text box displays all my previous searches since I last cleaned up my internet files and displays all the searchs at once and highlights the top and bottom search alternating back and forth. Any suggestions welcome.
