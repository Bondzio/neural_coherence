so it seems the webcam might be working.
it's just some program (you didn't tell what program) that gives an error message.
- did you try to close other programs that might be using your webcam?
- is there an error or warning in device manager for the webcam?
- did you happen to run a registry cleaner or disable some services for better performance?
- does the user manual tell something about prerequisites for using the webcam?
- does that program work if you boot into safe mode?
