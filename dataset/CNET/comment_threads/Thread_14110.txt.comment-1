Alright so I just bought a new Linksys wireless router, model no.
WRTG54G2.
I got it all setup and such and got it working with my iTouch.
But for some reason it won't work with my laptop.
When I go to the view available wireless networks, it doesnt show up.
I have a feeling the problem is with my laptop not seeing the router since the iTouch and the router work fine.
Anybody wanna help?
