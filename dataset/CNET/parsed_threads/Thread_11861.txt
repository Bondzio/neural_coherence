<s> Having problems with an optical drive. </s>
<s> If you place a known good disk in the drive and access the data on the disk it will not eject from the button on the drive. </s>
<s> However you can still eject the disk by going to the drive in my computer and right clicking it and selecting eject. </s>
<s> But, however you can insert a disk into the drive and after it has registered the disk but before you access the data you can eject it with the button on the drive. </s>
<s> All the CD recording software makers including Roxio, Nero, others had a bug at one time that did that. </s>
<s> While you didn't share much, a patch usually fixed it. </s>

<s> Thank you very much for the quick response. </s>
<s> The PC has both Roxio and Nero on it. </s>
