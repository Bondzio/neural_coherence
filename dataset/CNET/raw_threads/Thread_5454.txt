I am not asking in terms of radio signal reception but what I want to know is, does the AP maintain a table/list structure with the SSID of clients or its MAC address or its IP address? If yes where does it keep it?(in the sense, in which file system of its OS?) Also, a wireless router operates at netwok layer level maintaing NAT tables and inspecting packets at that level and routing IP packets. I assume in both wireless router case and AP#s case they must do the client detection at the physical layer level. How does this detection recored before sending the packets higher up the stack in case of wireless router? I assume in case of AP, it just detects clients and routes the WLAN packet directly to client. Is this true? It is important for me to know this as we want to tweak the AP/wireless router for some security needs.

This layer is where packets are router to different subnets using IP's. WAP's and/or AP's use up to and including layer 2--the data link layer. To answer your question, an AP deals with MAC addresses and it keeps them in a re-writable ROM chip (EEPROM). Each layer adds encapsulation going up the stack.

7704	4	337884	3019849	3019762	bkirby	4/7/09 7:25 AM	1.2390891E12	Yes, exactly!	Much like the ARP table dynamics, there is a one to one and/or one to many relationship between SSID's and MAC's which is stored on EEPROMS in the AP.
