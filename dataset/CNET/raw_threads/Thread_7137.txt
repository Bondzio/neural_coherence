I would like to hard wire 5 PCs using Cat 6. I am not presently concerned w/ internet speeds but I would like to have fast PC to PC speeds. Can I attach a Gigabyte switch to my router and get wired gigabyte speeds of transfer from PC to PC?

Since all switched PCs route through the router, the router must support GB also. In short, all devices must support GB speeds to get what you want.

Since the whole network could run just fine without a router, it doesn't need to be gigabit capable. The switch routes via the addressees MAC address all by itself. It doesn't need to hand off the data packets to another device. The router could be Cat5 and so could the cable to it.

With SWITCHED HUBS or &quot;Switches&quot; (use that name you want) the packets are switched with a store and forward scheme so speeds are switched up, down as needed. Bob
