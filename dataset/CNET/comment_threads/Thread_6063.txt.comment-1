My 89-year-old mother wants desperately to have &quot;a copying machine&quot; so she can copy family documents and photos to distribute to relatives before she dies.
She won't go near a computer, although she will use a photocopier.
My question: Is there a personal copier for $200 or so which will operate as a standalone item, i. e., without a computer connection?
It would need to be compact enough for her to use in her room.
It would need to be easy to use, with clearly marked controls.
The device only needs to scan and print, nothing fancy.
