1.1.1	hi , in one of days when i was using of my pc , i heared some voice from case and i realized its from the my Hard disk !	St
1.1.2	it was like chatter !	St
1.1.3	when i got this voice , all thing has locked up !	St
1.1.4	then hanged every thing , so i got restart , but it continue it again !	St
1.1.5	what is the main problem with it ?	Ques
1.2.1	Hard disks do n't speak , generally .	St
1.2.2	They turn until they crash , and that 's the end of their life .	St
1.2.3	Sometimes they start making strange noice , but that certainly is n't like chatting and voices .	St
1.2.4	So I think nothing is wrong with your hard disk .	St
1.2.5	Kees	St
1.3.1	Do n't be afraid , there is not gost in your PC..	St
1.3.2	I agree that HD never speaks but some motherboard does ( like ASUS P4.. ) .	St
1.3.3	They have a system that speak ( instead of beeping ) when something is wrong.. this systen could be enabled and disabled trught the BIOS configuration and it is very useful to diagnostic problems .	St
1.3.4	You must check your motherboard manual .	Sug
1.3.5	The important isue here is : what the voice told you ?	Ques
1.3.6	It is the error report ... according to that error you can identify the failure component , HDD , Video card , etc ...	St
1.4.1	Open your system case and disconnect the HD entirely via the cables .	St
1.4.2	Turn-ON your PC and if the noises disappear then you know the HD is going bad or is bad .	St
1.4.3	If the noise appears then likely a bad fan or similar , locate noise source .	St
1.4.4	Now , if the HD is bad , then you need to replace it , provided you 're capable .	St
1.4.5	If you have warranty , use it .	St
1.4.6	It appears if the HD is bad , it gone too far and physical damage , you probably ca n't recover data .	St
1.4.7	If the noise is elsewhere , repair that , then retry powering-ON system and check results .	St
1.4.8	Also , take notice of any heat build-up , as that alone can cause all sorts of issues with a failing HD and anything else in the system that it finds the weakest and generally heat will cause failure .	St
1.4.9	So , take that into account if so found .	St
1.4.10	It would be a good time to clean out your system case of any dust build-up and overall clean-up .	St
1.4.11	tada -- -- -Willy	St
