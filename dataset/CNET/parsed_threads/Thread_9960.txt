<s> I have problems with my Liteon 1610b Burn-proof 16x10x40 when I try to burn an audio cd or even files i get focus or tracking error about half way through. </s>
<s> I bought a cd-rw CD but same thing happens. </s>
<s> but when i burn about 100 megabytes, it works on both cd-rw and cd-r cd. </s>
<s> Ive even updated my firmware. </s>
<s> Help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Reduce the write speed to 1 or 2X to see if that fixes it. </s>
<s> Such drives age, media can get picky or you can try CDBURNERXP to see if that helps. </s>
