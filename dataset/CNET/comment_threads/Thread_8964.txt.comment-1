Im going to need a PC that will run a few apps and probably a couple of games that dont require high-end graphics.
I looked around and came up with these specifications: Intel Core 2 Duo [2.6 GHz] DDR2 Ram [2 GB] Hard Disk (sata) [250 GB] Graphics Card [256 MB] Now, I'd like to know if this will do the job and also if there are any additional things that I'm going to need other than a case.
