4383	0	236756	2420467	NR	tlh523	3/4/07 9:49 AM	1.17300174E12	Firewire to USB	I need a dedicated USB port on my laptop for my USB Digital Audio adapter. I am looking for a device that will connect to my firewire port on my laptop and will provide USB port(s). Pixella offers just the opposite of what I am looking for, but the price is a bit steep. Any suggestions?
