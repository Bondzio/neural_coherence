odd, i never got a reply notification.
anyway, the motherboard is sitting on its static bag, on my desk.
so, no shorting on the back of it.
the only things present ... power supply, motherboard, cpu, heatsink & fan, ram, monitor no beeping, though the board does have an onboard speaker.
any more suggestions?
