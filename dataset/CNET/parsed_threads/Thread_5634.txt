<s> I was in walle over the weekend to pick up a router for vacation home (single level modular home with router installed in back right corner bedroom). </s>
<s> Started with the cheapest which was the belkin n300($40). </s>
<s> Top signal bars with phone and laptop through out home. </s>
<s> Stable range and connection for 2 days. </s>
<s> Read reviews and specs and noticed no wireless printing. </s>
<s> Packed up and returned for netgear n300 ($50) which specs. </s>
<s> wireless printing. </s>
<s> Dropped a bar each for phone and laptop and unstable connection with phone. </s>
<s> Returned and will try another next time I'm down there. </s>
<s> They had a cisco (e1200 or e1500 can't remember at $60). </s>
<s> I'll test this one next time i'm down there (400 miles away). </s>
<s> No time to thoroughly test and both routers left to default settings although the netgear was set to 150 mbps and i changed to 300 mbps with no better results. </s>
<s> Didn't read up on this router class but I will before purchasing another. </s>
<s> I have the cisco e4200 at my home and have had no issues except for the blinking logo which a firmware fixed. </s>
<s> Looking for advice. </s>
<s> Thanks, Mike </s>
<s> This is pretty much the standard why is there so much difference of opinion on what router works best. </s>
<s> When you deal with radio waves you have both the router design and the location it is running in to content with. </s>
<s> A router that works great in one house may work poorly in another. </s>
<s> Almost impossible to predict this so other than what you are doing keep trying until you get one that works for you. </s>
<s> When tested in very controlled conditions there is not a lot of difference between routers so this leaves the persons house. </s>
<s> You best bet may be to use the belkin you know works well and buy a USB print server and plug that into the router. </s>
<s> I am assuming this is what you mean by wireless printing since if you have a printer that has wireless already you don't need anything special on the router. </s>
<s> Thanks for your input. </s>
<s> These are the model #'s i briefly tested. </s>
<s> Looks like I would have to step up to the Belkin N600 for wireless printing support according to website. </s>
<s> Most likely the printer will be hardwired to the router though. </s>
<s> Just didn't have time to get that far and might not make it back to vacation home for another 3 months which is beyond walle return. </s>
<s> Next time i'm down there I will buy both the Belkin n600 and cisco equivalent to the 2 I've tested already. </s>
<s> See which one fits the bill. </s>
<s> Just wasn't sure if a laptop would be able to print to the printer even if the printer was hardwired. </s>
<s> Wish i would have had more time to test. </s>
<s> Just got off the phone with belkin. </s>
<s> Not an issue for me since the printer is in the same room as the router. </s>
<s> I'll repurchase and try it next time I'm down there. </s>
<s> Excellent signal strength. </s>
<s> Only can hope it will retain a connection but for $40 its worth the risk for me. </s>
<s> Trying not to over buy for my needs. </s>
<s> what I have. </s>
<s> The D-link DIR-655. </s>
<s> Excellent router for a little more money. </s>
<s> It consistently gets the best reviews. </s>
