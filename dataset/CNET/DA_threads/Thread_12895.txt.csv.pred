1.1.1	Hello , All ... Well , first , here 's my System info : LAPTOP PC : -DELL Inpiron 9300 Laptop , WinXP Media Edition Vers .	St
1.1.2	2002 Serv Pack 2 , Pent .	St
1.1.3	M proc .	St
1.1.4	1.86 GHz , 1.00 GB RAM , 51.1 GB HDD , built-in TSSTcorp TS-L532B Dual-Layer DVD+-RW drive .	St
1.1.5	Built-in WiFi & Bluetooth -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Okay with that out of the way ; Online , I ordered a LiteOn 16X Super AllWrite DVD/CD Writer & ReWriter w/ LightScribe ( Model # SHM-165H6S ) , and decided I want to mount it Inside an AirLink 101 USB 2.0 , 5.25 & quot ; Enclosure Box ( Model # AEN-U55 ) .	St
1.1.6	Here 's what is happening : I 've checked and reChecked my connections inside the enclosure .	St
1.1.7	And when I flip it 's swich with the USB plugged in , I get a brief flash of one side of the Built-in fancy Blue lights , the fan begins to whirr , and after roughly 1 minute , Both sets of lights come on and stay lit .	St
1.1.8	I can even get the DVD drawer to Eject and go back in .	St
1.1.9	However , even though the USB cable is connected into my laptop i get NOTHING ... Not a & quot ; Bing-Bong & quot ; or Anything .	St
1.1.10	It 's like Windows XP is NOT & quot ; Recognizing a New Device & quot ; like it normally does .	St
1.1.11	I 'm at a loss ; I do n't even see it in Device Manager or & quot ; My Computer & quot ; I 've even switched a couple USBs just to make sure it was n't a cable thats faulty .	St
1.1.12	By the way , the Enclosure came with one of those & quot ; mini-CD drivers & quot ; but it 's not compatible with XP , only Win98 .	St
1.1.13	The LitghtScribe DVD burner came with Nero OEM , PowerDVD 5 , and a couple sample media .	St
1.1.14	- If anyone out there has a Clue , please let me know .	St
1.1.15	Thank You .	St
1.1.16	Tony	St
1.2.1	The problem could just be that the enclosure is n't compatible with the drive .	St
1.2.2	Another thing , that I noticed you did n't put down , was that you used the driver CD that came with the DRIVE on your laptop .	St
1.2.3	That might be your problem .	St
1.2.4	Windows XP might not have the driver in it 's driver library , so you will have to use the installation CD that came with the drive to install the correct driver , then plug in the enclosure .	St
1.2.5	That 's why my best bet would be , it is not recognizing that the drive is there , because it does n't even recognize the DVD-RW drive as BEING a drive , since it is so new .	St
1.3.1	spend the extra thirty dollars and get the version actually made by hp .	St
1.3.2	it works really well , have one my self..the lite on ones work for about a month if you get them to work at all	St
1.4.1	I dont think you can call a drive crap just because you think another one is better , the market is full of drives all designed to do a job of work and mostly they do , sometimes it 's the people who operate them that are crap , your word not mine , I 've been using Lite-on for years and have no trouble at all .	St
1.5.1	First of all , I 'm going to Reply to all three ( 3 ) responses Seperately , b/c Everyone had some valid points regarding my dilemma .	St
1.5.2	Once again , I TOTALLY appreciate your advice .	Polite
1.5.3	( thumbs Up ! )	St
1.5.4	Here 's what I did to Get the DVD/CD drive working : - I took it out of the case , started Re-examining the connections ...	St
1.5.5	Suddenly !	St
1.5.6	( Do n't Laugh ; -D ) I thought of actually READING the DVD/CD drive 's MANUAL !	St
1.5.7	( Hmpf !	St
1.5.8	Imagine That ! )	St
1.5.9	( Ok , go ahead and laugh !	Sug
1.5.10	I am ! )	St
1.5.11	- What I kind of realized/discovered by BOTH examining the rear of the unit AND reading ( there 's that word again ... LOL ! )	St
1.5.12	was that by Default it was set as as ''SLAVE '' drive from the Manufacturer : Lite-On !	St
1.5.13	- Now , with a quick removal and Re-placement of the ''Jumper '' to the MASTER side , and closing back up the Enclosure unit , Plugging it all in , Suddenly All lights were Instantly ON on the Enclosure housing , and almost Immediately after that , Windows XP ''Found New Hardware '' AND ( check This out ) INSTALLED it , but without any hesitation !	St
1.5.14	- So , as you see Leria , its only that little thing called : ''Consulting one 's Owners manual First '' that I SHOULD have done in the first place .	St
1.5.15	This one Seriously has Egg on My Face !	St
1.5.16	- Thank you for your Reply though .	St
1.5.17	It is Well Appreciated .	St
1.5.18	Take care , Leria !	St
1.5.19	Btw , why do n't you Update your profile ?	Ques
1.5.20	Just wondering ... L8ter ... Tony	St
1.6.1	In all honesty , you COULD be right about LiteOn , ( and if you are , I 'll be the First to send you an Email to attest to it in about 30 days .	St
1.6.2	- My thing , is that since I am fairly New to the ''LightScribe '' thang , I ca n't see spending about a ''C-Note '' on one , and risking even HP giving me crap .	St
1.6.3	( I do n't think there is One manufacturer out there who does n't have ANY probs , am I right ?	Ques
1.6.4	- I mean , Yes , HP did Indeed Make /Invent the LightScribe , but Thank GOD for Competition , so all these ''Big Biznessez '' ( spelled wrong on purpose ) ca n't MONOPOLIZE on new technology .	St
1.6.5	- If you read my Reply to this issue above , you 'll see that it was indeed MY Fault as to not being able to run it in the Enclosure box .	St
1.6.6	- I did a ''Test '' LightScribe ''burn '' with a picture from the movie ''Maid in Manhattan '' , and quite honestly , it 's pretty Freekin ' Good , Man !	St
1.6.7	: -D - I recently learned that LiteOn is a Mitsubishi Co. which Does make some quality tech !	St
1.6.8	( I 've owned a 36 '' Stereo tv by MGA/Mitsubishi for about 8 years !	St
1.6.9	It has Multiple connections for Surround / Theatre Sound , AND ... Still has Bomb-Ass Picture and Sound quality ! )	St
1.6.10	- ( I 'll probably STILL get that ''Vertically-Standing '' black unit by HP because I do wish to Compare quality !	St
1.6.11	And I think HP is American-made !	St
1.6.12	Least I Hope so !	St
1.6.13	: -D ) - As I said , you may be right , Blazer ... we 'll both know soon , right ?	Ques
1.6.14	- Take Care Dude !	St
1.6.15	( Two thumbs Way up ! )	St
1.6.16	- Thanks again for your Reply post !	St
1.6.17	I appreciate it !	St
1.6.18	- One !	St
1.6.19	~Tony~	St
1.7.1	Yep !	St
1.7.2	Sometimes , it 's like the & quot ; Luck of the Draw & quot ; with almost ANYTHING !	St
1.7.3	PCs , HDDs , DVD/CD drives , Media ... You name it !	St
1.7.4	- As you can see from my Replies to both above responses , it was MY BAD that I was not initially able to use the LiteOn DVD/CD LightScribe in the Enclosure box .	St
1.7.5	I can , and HAVE admitted to it .	St
1.7.6	- Subsequently , I HAVE got it going fine now .	St
1.7.7	- As a fellow consumer of LiteOn products , You and person 's like us , are who I should get the advice from because you Have and do USE their items .	St
1.7.8	- True enough , as I said , from time to time , there ARE manufacturer 's DEFECTS , but in ALL areas , right ?	Ques
1.7.9	- Yet , like you said ... SOME TIMES it is INDEED the people ( Like me ) who Fail to READ the Manuals/Booklets OR to seek Info in Forum/Posts like here at CNET , then end up complaining to the Big Company , when all it takes is a bit of RESEARCH on the issues .	St
1.7.10	Am I right ?	Ques
1.7.11	- I appreciate you Defending LiteOn , VikPaul !	St
1.7.12	I have n't used their products for long , and I 'm New to LightScribe also , but I have heard some pretty Positive things about LiteOn !	St
1.7.13	( And recently hearing that its a Mitsubishi Co. makes me Happier as well !	St
1.7.14	( Please read my Reply to BlazerDude20 for my reasons why I like Mitsubishi , ok ? )	Ques
1.7.15	- That said , Thank you again for your Reply ... AND your Defence !	St
1.7.16	: -D - I 'm out ... ~ Tony ~	St
