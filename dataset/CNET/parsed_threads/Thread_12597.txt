<s> I have an older Compaq computer 5320 CA from about 2002, I'm using Windows XP. </s>
<s> I used it for a couple of years then not for approximately 2 years. </s>
<s> I have been using it for the last year without any problems. </s>
<s> On Saturday, it is now Thursday, after about 5 hours my computer started to freeze to the point where it was no longer sending data and my mouse wouldn't work, it lasted a minute then was find for a while, then started to freeze more regularly once I turned it off I got a few more hours before it would start freezing again. </s>
<s> Each day the amount of time I would get before it froze has been getting shorter and shorter to the point today where it started almost immediately. </s>
<s> Now it is freezing about every minute or two for a minute or so. </s>
<s> At some point in the last week my cd burner quit working (ie does not recognize when a cd is put into it). </s>
<s> Once it starts its freezing issues the cd burner has a red light on. </s>
<s> The last few times I have tried to turn my computer off, it will not fully shut off competely. </s>
<s> It does into shutdown mode but will not actually turn off. </s>
<s> I thought originally it was a virus but I did a virus scan and it found nothing so then I did a factory reset and cleaned my computer. </s>
<s> I thought maybe it was the fan not working, but I have a fan on it and that is not working, it has actually gotten worse. </s>
<s> Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly welcomed </s>

<s> I just did the fan cleaning today, I will let you know how it turns out and if my problem goes away. </s>
<s> This problem never goes away entirely. </s>
<s> I was at one of the usual stores today and a few machines were frozen... </s>
