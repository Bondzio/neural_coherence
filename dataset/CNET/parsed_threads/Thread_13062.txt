<s> I have a i7 xp 32-bit machine. </s>
<s> It exceeds at 4gb ram, but I have 12. </s>
<s> What should I do in order for me to use all 12 gigs of ram? </s>
<s> For now the Windows 32 OSes limit apps to 2.0GB RAM each. </s>
<s> So why did you put XP on this? </s>
<s> The machine was bought 2 years ago, when i7 first came out and win 7 was still on beta. </s>
<s> Should I upgrade to Win 7 64bit? </s>
<s> Because 4gb ram is not enough memory to run multiple software simultaneously. </s>
<s> If not, what are my other solutions? </s>
<s> Thank you, </s>
<s> XP and in general all 32 bit OSes limit the memory space from 2.1 to about 3.5GB. </s>
<s> At no time has any of the 32 bit OSes given access to the full 4GB RAM. </s>
<s> I noted the 2.0GB limit per app and about the only way around that and keep a 32 bit OS is to install some &quot;HYPERVISOR&quot; and run multiple instances of Windows XP. </s>
<s> --&gt; What a mess. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor I guess we could do that. </s>

<s> Thank you man you guys rock!! </s>
<s> Just one more quick question. </s>
<s> How does one minimize the unnecessary program/software that window runs on the bg? </s>
<s> It really irritates me that every time I have to manually 'force close' programs that I rarely use, but yet it is running in the bg. </s>
<s> Thanks, </s>
<s> Which begs a discussion about why we let them start. </s>
<s> Use the MSCONFIG utility to disable the programs you don't want running at every start up Start &gt; Run &gt; Type in MSCONFIG &gt; ok &gt; Click the Start up tab &gt; Browse through the list &gt; uncheck the unnecessary ones &gt; Hit Apply and ok. </s>
