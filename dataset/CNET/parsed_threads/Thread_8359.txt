<s> I was thinking about buying a laptop and having the screen replaced with one that has a higher resolution. </s>
<s> So, I went to this website and they had 2 Different kinds of 17&quot; WUXGA screens. </s>
<s> One was just a screen and the other was labeled &quot;glossy&quot;. </s>
<s> They were both the same price. </s>
<s> Now, why would I want a glossy screen? </s>
<s> Wouldn't that reflect all kinds of light making it difficult to see, especially outdoors? </s>
<s> If I'm not understanding what &quot;glossy&quot; screens are, please inform me. </s>

<s> They explain it better: http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/how_to/4213062.html I prefer matted myself. </s>
<s> Its a little more costly to make a matted display but glossy with it problems or advantages they both become the ying-yang of displays. </s>
<s> Since, you saw the displays, check them out more closely. </s>
<s> You will find if you look at an angle of a matted display, you don't see all of it proper(great security) while the glossy does reflect light. </s>
<s> However, the color seems to come out more and the matted is more washed out. </s>
<s> But, on very good displays, the differences become slight and really it becomes preference once you decide, do recheck them again. </s>

<s> Great information. </s>
<s> It helps a lot. </s>
<s> Now my problem is deciding which I prefer. </s>
<s> I hate how solving one problem can lead to another. </s>
<s> Many thanks, -Jonathan </s>
<s> You can look at laptops or regular monitors...the glare/reflection issue remains the same on either device. </s>
<s> If you only use the laptop in one location and you can control all the variables...overhead lighting, sunlight, etc, glossy, bright is fine. </s>
<s> If not, then matte finish is far nicer to use overall under a variety of locations and conditions. </s>
