here are some free vcd and dvd players that you can download.
the first one with the divx codecs (which are also free) comes with a player that you can install and it's probably one of the best i've seen to be honest.
you have to copy and paste the above into the addressbar because the cnet filters wipes out the url if i put the  in front of it to make it clickable.
