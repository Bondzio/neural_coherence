<s> I built this myself maybe a year and a half ago but am simplifying and moving to a Thinkpad. </s>
<s> I was wondering if anyone could help me come up with a fair asking price. </s>

<s> this is an instance where you may get more by selling some components seperately. </s>
<s> if you've got a windows license, definitely install it since a functional pc is worth more than an assembled pc. </s>
<s> the case, power supply, mobo, cpu, ram, video, dvd and ide 300gb should fetch $250 (with an OS). </s>
<s> anyone buying an inexpensive pc won't be interested in your higher-end components. </s>
<s> so keeping the raptors in the pc won't add anything to its price but you should be able to sell the raptors seperately for $40-$50 each. </s>
<s> likewise, the blu-ray reader is worth $50 seperately. </s>
<s> the monitor should fetch $225-$250. </s>
