Much like driving your car at 120 MPH, it won't last long.
NEVER STRESS the power supply.
But it's sufficient to get the machine up and tested, but you won't find me trusting it.
I'd expect it to overheat, randomly crash, stress the motherboard capacitors and eventually need replacement of PSU and motherboard.
