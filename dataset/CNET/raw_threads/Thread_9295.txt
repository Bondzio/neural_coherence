You neglected to share the make/model numbers of the items. For instance, the 256 MB memory stick issues on BX based boards is legendary. And such would use SDRAM. Bob

For example, we have some P4 1.9 GHz machines that perform like P3 800 Mhz machines all due to a mistake by me to recycle some sticks of SDRAM. Since the deed is done and the machines are used for email, Open Office and have no payback if I was to fix this issue, I haven't changed the motherboards and RAM, but I still kick myself over that one. Bob PS. Oh, if your board does SDRAM, you won't see the BX issue I noted.
