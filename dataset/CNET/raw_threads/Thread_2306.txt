I don't remember what I have done and I don't know the default values. I went to the Device Manager and changed the advanced settings of Marvell Yukon 88E8056 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Adapter. Please tell me the default values so that I can change it back I am using Windows Vista Service pack 2 Your help will be appreciated Chris christarzan@gmail.com

Only Yukon can do that. I have to wonder if you don't have an older pre-Vista system and have run into hardware compatibility issues. Is that possible?
