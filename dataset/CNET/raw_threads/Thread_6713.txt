Black - a few spots of nozzle pattern after cleaning the print head plate but still no printing. These two carts are new vendor other carts work OK. Already tried to no effect: Twice (once has worked for years, not this time): 1 Isopropyl drops on ink spikes (1 hour to overnight) 2 One normal cleaning cycle. Once: warm d-water/isopropyl/detergent solution in place of alcohol above. Once: Paper towel soak of print head plate in 50/50 d-water and Windex overnight. This helped the black print head go from zero nozzle pattern to a few spots on the pattern. Still no printing. Cleaning solutions I have: 70% isopropyl (effective under normal circumstances) 50/50 d-water/Windex d-water/isopropyl/detergent I have acquired a 10 ml syringe and tubing and want to flush the heads. Question is how to do this safely without damage. I know I am supposed to do it slowly with minimum pressure but how slow is slow. What is the rate of flow? 1 ml per 10 seconds, 1 ml per 30 seconds? Can any of these solutions be used HOT and which would be most effective and safe for this purpose? The printer also had weird carriage sounds/behavior. It kept moving slowly, quietly and continuously even after shut off and shutdown. Only ended after I turned off power strip overnight.
