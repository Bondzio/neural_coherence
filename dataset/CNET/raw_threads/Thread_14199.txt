So far its been running smoothly but I have been considering upgrading and possibly installing new hardware. I have been able to find most of the systems specs at the Dell site but for the life of me I cant seen to find anything on the motherboard. I had heard that Dells customer service/tech support had a lot to be desired. Well I found that out first hand, needless to say I still dont know what brand, make or model the motherboard is. Does anybody know who makes Dells boards and how I can find out which board I have. Thanks.

Keep in mind the Dell's are NOT a standard ATX MB so you are &quot;stuck&quot; with it. And your only going to find out what Dell wants you to know. But you can do video cards, hard drives and memory upgades. John
