Are you saying that the connection is already on property you own but paid for by the company you work for or is it your company's location?
It would seem to me that such would first require permission to do so.
Secondly, your ADSL is a line that terminates at a modem that will have an IP address.
You cannot connect another on to that same line.
As well, the distance from your location to the ranch is only one part of the full equation as the total distance from the phone company's central office to the ranch needs to be considered.
You can't just splice in wiring to an existing location and run it to another in this manner.
The ADSL supplied at your location will need filtering for the phone service so to duplicate this entire setup at the ranch doesn't seem feasible.
You might check to see if ADSL is possible to the ranch by normal methods first.
