<s> Recently added a new (4th) ide drive. </s>
<s> After hours of jumper fun, I finally got all drives to show up in Disk Manager. </s>
<s> Formatted drives 3 & 4. </s>
<s> All healthy. </s>
<s> They show up on boot (I have a dual boot, so can see them in the list). </s>
<s> Problem is, drives 3 & 4 (F & S) do not show up in My Computer! </s>
<s> So I can't access them. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> RickyB51 </s>
<s> What drive letter was assigned to them in Disk Management. </s>
<s> F & S. I notice on boot that one says windows, not slave. </s>
<s> Click start, run and put in this? </s>
<s> F:\ Bob </s>
<s> Hmm - error - F:/ refers to location that is unavailable, etc. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> If you have configurated properly on bios, i.e. </s>
<s> master with HD switched to master a.s.o. </s>
<s> most probably you have a driver problem. </s>
<s> It depends on which chipset has your motherboard. </s>
<s> VIA chipsets are really a pain.. because of the poor reliability of it's drivers. </s>
<s> So I suggest: Identify the chipset. </s>
<s> It is easier if it is a Intel, because Intel provides a utility in order to identify which. </s>
<s> If it'is a branded PC, look at the support page and get the chipset from there. </s>
<s> Look at the device manager My Computer &gt;&gt; right button&gt;&gt;Properties&gt;&gt;Hardware&gt;Device Manager tab&gt;&gt; look at H disk and check the properties in detail. </s>
<s> Which drivers,from whom, details. </s>
<s> Microsoft update, if you have selected automatic updates has the nasty behaviour of replace original drivers whith Microsoft's ones, which are all a piece of... </s>
<s> So, or roll back or better find the latest either on manufacturer (mobo) support page or at the chipset mfct. </s>
<s> web site. </s>
<s> If you have an older PC , you should download the last and a previous Windows certificated drivers, because the last ones may not work properly. </s>
<s> If everithing goes ok, take note of version, keep a copy of the sys file,and eventually dll's and do not allow windows to change or update automatically : choice must be yours not Microsoft. </s>
<s> Before I do anything, here's some info - XP pro, custom built computer, AMD, 2-3 yrs. </s>
<s> old. </s>
<s> 2 boot partitions - office & studio (recording). </s>
<s> Has always worked fine. </s>
<s> Also drive 2 is 2 partitions (for audio) E: & G: ON boot I choose wich partition. </s>
<s> The window says - Studio - hdd1-Primary 1-(size) --- Office - hdd1-Primary 2-(size) --- Hard Disk 2 - HDD2 - MBR - (size)512 by - (mode) none Hard Disk 3 - HDD3 - MBR - (size)512 by - (mode) none Windows - HDD3 - Primary 1 (size) 149GB - (mode) auto (this is the old H:, now F: Hard Disk 4 - HDD4 - MBR - (size)512 by - (mode) none (This is new, now S:. </s>
<s> Checked drivers for all drives - all are mocrosoft, dated 2001, same version number. </s>
<s> All drives - device is working properly. </s>
<s> Seems like the Windows drive could be wierd. </s>
<s> Does this indicate a jumper issue, again? </s>
<s> The windows HDD3 & Drive 4 HDD4 are the ones not showing in My Computer. </s>
<s> Thanks for you helps o far! </s>
<s> Rick </s>
<s> When you replied to my post, you got the command wrong and if you get it right then I may have another idea for you. </s>
<s> Got the same error message. </s>
<s> Just to clear up your message. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> When I did RUN F:\. </s>
<s> I also did S:\, same result. </s>
<s> Now wait for Bob's second idea! </s>
<s> I can't guess. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> But are you writing you put RUN F:\ in the run box? </s>
<s> I can never be sure. </s>
<s> Head to disk management, make it full screen, and take a screen shot. </s>
<s> Post it on photobucket.com for us to see. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> No, I didn't put the word RUN, just - F:\ http://s974.photobucket.com/albums/ae226/RIckyB_photos/ Hope this works. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=XP+HEALTHY+ (UNKNOWN+PARTITION)&aq=f&oq=&aqi= finds this discussed by many others so I'll want more story about these drives. </s>
<s> http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555056 and MANY OTHER ARTICLES cover this. </s>
<s> More details are needed to discover why these are this way. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Is any third party boot manager in play? </s>
<s> Some cause this. </s>
<s> Boot It was used... Again, all was fine until I took ut my DVD drive (F:) and put in the new hard drive. </s>
<s> I see int eh scrn shot that it looks like the new drives are 'hidden', darker blue looks like the studio hidden drive. </s>
<s> A I wrong? </s>
<s> And do the old drives come back? </s>
<s> And is there anything useful on the new drive? </s>
<s> Can you assign a letter to it (in disk management?) </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Not sure why remove. </s>
<s> The old drives are fine. </s>
<s> The new 500GB(4th)dirve is newly formatted, no data. </s>
<s> #3 drive (160GB) is also newly formatted. </s>
<s> These are the 2 that are dark blue. </s>
<s> Letters are assigned, F: & S: </s>
<s> If this was me I would have done something like remove the partition, created it and formatted that new drive again in disk management. </s>
<s> Your screen shot clearly showed no drive letter assigned to disk 2 or 3. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> hmm... </s>
<s> When I formatted, I DID assign a letter. </s>
<s> You're right, now they aren't there. </s>
<s> SO, you suggest I redo the process adn see if it works out, correct? </s>
<s> Though I won't be able to get ot it today. </s>
<s> Thanks, Rick </s>
<s> Sort of like lather, rinse, repeat until its in the shape you want. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ha!I will try that & let you know. </s>
<s> Again, I thank you all so much for your input so far! </s>
<s> Rick </s>
<s> Well, after all of that, the lst idea worked! </s>
<s> Something must've gone wrong first time around, so deleted the aprtition and redid. </s>
<s> Both drives are now there and accessable! </s>
<s> Thanks to all for your kindness. </s>
<s> A great relief. </s>
<s> Rick </s>
<s> Man, this frustrating. </s>
<s> Reformatted & named the 2 drives F: & H:, they showed up healthy in My computer. </s>
<s> I plugged my Ext. </s>
<s> dvd drive in a usb port, it showed up as F: and the drives went away again. </s>
<s> I reformatted etc. </s>
<s> again, named H: & M:. </s>
<s> Plugged the dvd drive back in, came up F:, and the drives were there now, so it seemed to be the F: name. </s>
<s> Rebooted to my studio partition: Drives gone again. </s>
<s> Formatted & healthy, but no name & unknown partition. </s>
<s> WTF! </s>
<s> Rebooted to my office partition again - same thing. </s>
<s> Any ideas, guys? </s>
<s> Rick </s>
<s> if you use a program norton partition manager you can see all your partition in your machine, maby you have forget hidden they partitions i'm not shure for that but a try does not harm! </s>
<s> have nice day ^_^ </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> They are definitely not hidden. </s>
<s> It's something else. </s>
<s> Just asking. </s>
<s> Why didn't you change that external letter from F:? </s>
<s> Also there are some nasties that hide in the autorun of externals. </s>
<s> Let's fix or stop that. </s>
<s> Ready? </s>
<s> -&gt; Install http://download.cnet.com/Autorun-Eater/3000-2239_4-10752777.html </s>
<s> Well, I guess I'm in fix. </s>
<s> I've got calls into some guys for help. </s>
<s> See what comes next. </s>
<s> Rick </s>
<s> Well, about 2 weeks ago I spoe w/ a friend who knows about this stuff, adn found that my problem was that I didn't format the drives as an Extended partition. </s>
<s> Once done, everything works great. </s>
<s> I knew it would be something that simple, but something I overlooked or didn't know. </s>
<s> Now I do! </s>
<s> Thanks to all for your responses. </s>
