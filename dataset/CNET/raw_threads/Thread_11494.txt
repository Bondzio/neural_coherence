If not or you don't want to spend the money, give knoppix live cd a try. You would want to use a program called dd_rescue. Make sure you have the input file and output correct or you will overwrite your information.

But the information I provided are correct. At the moment. I dont have enough money for data recovery company. And I'm in Nigeria at the moment. Not much of them around here. I also don't have much time in retrieving this pictures.

I have seen various post about it. But I haven't seen anyone of them that match my own problem. I have tried to follow their processes which says to initialize disk. Mine however not giving me any options to initialize disk.

Some of the tools work with such damage. If you can't use such tools I suggest you head to http://www.drivesavers.com now. This sort of recovery is not reliable. Some folk forget that or didn't know. Here's the link if you feel like trying it yourself. http://forums.cnet.com/7723-7588_102-354911/lost-and-found-or-the-storage-forum-sticky/?tag=contentBody;threadListing Good luck! Bob

Dont try to initialize disk that could make matters worse.

I do want the drive working so I can transfer my data. I'm yet to work on it. Still bidding my time to take next possible action.

When you recover those files it writes them to some other drive. Think about this. The drive does not need to be fully working to recover files. Why I write this is that some folk didn't know that when we recover files we don't always fix the issue with the drive. That is, we recover the data, then may format the drive and copy the files back onto the drive. Bob

I think it's best I get someone who really understand this to help me. I don't want to mess it up while doing it onmy own. Thanks everyone.

5853	12	589598	5442879	5442764	spicytee	3/29/13 8:53 PM	1.36459038E12	What's the tutorials that Recuva offers?	I'm not sure I saw the thread on Recuver. Is this same as Photorec? And you know what. I'm just being careful. Aint a geek geeky like that. I'm just a Phtoographer.. Have got plenty data in that folder that I can't afford to mess up further. I will try and see if I can find a local guy here who can work on it. Cos I cant do drive saver from here and no time for me. Cos I need the images urgently.

Fortunately a friend let me borrow a copy of the puppy Linux operating system on cd for the second one. You start the computer with cd in drive and external drive attached. If you have ever used dos, it works like that. I am better at showing than telling. Linux recognized the drive and I was able to copy everything to a new drive. It literally took 22 or more hours to copy but worth it. Google Puppy Linux and see what you find. Good luck and Happy Easter.

Even without a tutorial you use -&gt; Recuva &lt;- to scan for the files but save those files on a good drive. Be careful of the spelling since bad people will rename some malware to suck folk into installing something bad. I see the save location in the tab/area noted in the documentation at http://www.piriform.com/docs/recuva/recuva-settings/options-actions Bob
