I thought I would pull the hard drive out of it and use it for a backup drive. I went out to Newegg and picked up a NexStar CX external enclosure and put the hard drive in it and connected it to my desktop via a USB cable and my desktop won't even recognize it - its like its not even hooked up. So then I tried hooking it up to another laptop I have and got the same results. Is there anything in Windows 7 that I need to do to get it to recognize it?? Or is the hard drive just dead?? Thanks

Sometimes I find the drive in need of a fresh partition and format. If no data recovery is an issue I just wipe it and start over. Some folk forget you don't use Windows Explorer for that step. Bob
