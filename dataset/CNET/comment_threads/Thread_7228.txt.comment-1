I have two computers in one room which i currently want to connect to the internet.
(one is an hp intel pentium4 and the other a compaq presario) the hp intel pent.4 computer currently connects to the internet (broadband) via wireless from the main computer (in another room).
I want to connect the compaq to the internet aswell but i only have a cat 5 utp crossover cable connecting the hp intel pentium 4 computer to the compaq presario.
is it possible to establish an internet connection using this cat5 cable or should i shell out top dollar for yet another wireless card?
Urgent help needed, Thank you, P.
