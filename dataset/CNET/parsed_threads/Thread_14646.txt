<s> My brother-in-law is getting DSL installed. </s>
<s> His Dell computer doesn't have a NIC card and instead of hooking it up USB I was going to install a NIC that I have. </s>
<s> The question is, the Dell site says that it uses a 120 pin NIC card. </s>
<s> The ones I have are all 116 pin. </s>
<s> The people I have talked to, say they have never heard of the 120 pin. </s>
<s> Is that just a type o or does Dell have special card they use?. </s>
<s> Thanks Wayne </s>
<s> Mystery! </s>

<s> The Dell 4500s is a desktop. </s>
<s> It is one of those small things that opens like a clam shell. </s>
<s> I know it only has two PCI slots. </s>
<s> Sorry I left that out. </s>

<s> http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim4500S/replace.htm#1101572 shows it will accept a standard PCI network card. </s>

<s> That is what I was looking for. </s>
<s> I was just confused about the 120 pin and the 116 pin. </s>
<s> Thanks again Wayne </s>
<s> Just a wee bit more information was needed for me to reply. </s>
<s> My first hit found laptops and that desktop. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I installed the linksys Nic card I had in his computer and is working fine. </s>
<s> Thank you Wayne </s>
