http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/mainboard/mbd/pro_mbd_detail.php?UID=408 The specifications for your motherboard indicate the following memory is compatible: Two modules of PC1600 or PC2100 DDR SDRAM (184 pins) -OR- Two modules of PC100 or PC133 SDRAM (168 pins) * * * * * DDR SDRAM (DDR for short) is a different type of memory than simple SDRAM DDR memory http://www.crucial.com/kb/answer.asp?qid=4003 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR_SDRAM slowest &lt; PC1600 &lt; PC2100 &lt; PC2700 &lt; PC3200 &lt; fastest * * * * * The fastest RAM that your motherboard can support is PC2100 RAM.
HOWEVER, Since memory makers have decided that it isn't profitable to make the slower (and older) PC1600 and PC2100 RAM anymore, you will have a difficult time finding it in stock.
No need to worry because DDR RAM is backwards compatible, and you could use PC2700 or possibly PC3200 modules in a board that calls for PC2100.
