I was under the misimpression this was a new drive added to a working system.
-&gt; Here's the deal.
With your new information it appears you have some custom machine that you placed a hard disk on a nonstandard RAID IDE connection.
Since you don't have multiple drives this is a mistake in setup.
Also your post is void of all makes and models so I can only offer the best move is to move the drive to the normal first IDE channel and attempt a normal setup.
