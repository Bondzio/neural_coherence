<s> My CDRW doesn't seem to write as fast as it used to. </s>
<s> I'm running XP Home SP2 on a PowerSpec w/ a LiteOn 40x12x48x CDRW. </s>
<s> Any Suggestions to the cause and remedy? </s>
<s> I switch media make, use a CD lens cleaner and then swap the drive out. </s>
<s> Many will reload the OS and do many other things, but I've found that I need to cut the amount of time before I pull the drive. </s>
<s> Such age in about a year... Bob </s>
