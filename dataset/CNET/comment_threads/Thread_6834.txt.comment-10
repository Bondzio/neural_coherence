It's not a company with reviews by the usual sites (such as Cnet) and is what you can find at mom and pop PC clone shops all over.
Yes, the parts are there but are you ready to figure out if they forget a driver or some other thing?
For example many clone shops omit/forget Intel's little Rapid Storage app and the owner suffers needlessly.
Such details are many but you see them all the time.
The final choice is yours but I wouldn't buy that.
If I was going to go down that road I'd copy what another member is doing at this link: http://forums.cnet.com/7723-6122_102-525050.html That's one nice selection.
They picked the top from the people's choices.
