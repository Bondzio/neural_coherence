[during memory count hit deleete, maybe]. Make sure that the boot sequence is A then C not C first. You may not have an operating system on the hard drive.

Floppy light on at all times	yes, I can axcess BIOS...and it says A,C...and are you talking about the ribbon cable as to being reversed (on A drive)...it's not marked nor the type of notched reciever socket...I did reverse the connection ...screen says.... error reading drive &quot;A&quot;
3704	3	25411	284283	284273	Ray Harinec	6/9/04 4:48 PM	1.08679968E12	Possibly a bad floppy drive.	Yes I meant the ribbon cable. The stripe on the edge goes to pin one of both the mobo and the drive. Not all drives show pin one readily, but after you reversed it, I think that it is now in the correct way. Is the floppy drive controller enabled in the BIOS? [probably is, but]. Is there a hard drive in the system??? Change to C A for boot sequence and see what you get. Even a message that there is no Operating System is a useful piece of info. If the hard drive has the sytem files [the DOS sytem files] on it, you can try some DOS commands to see what happens.

The other row is above the connector. Not easy to see it clearly. [any doubt take the floppy drive out and lay it on a piece of cardboard and connect it. Did this twice last week when testing six new floppy drives before I put them on the shelf. Finally checked them outside the case.

3704	6	25411	284432	284420	Ray Harinec	6/9/04 7:08 PM	1.08680808E12	Re hard drives. &quot;No operating system&quot; does not necessarily mean that the	drive is bad. It simply may not have an operating system on it. What do you know about the status of the hard drives from their prior use? The floppy cable could be bad. On the 486's that I remember the floppy drive controller was actually on an IO card [ISA type] Is that true of this one?? Id so, you might be able to pick up another card for a few bucks. If you can get a floppy to work, and have a boot floppy with the DOS system files on it you would be able to do some troubleshooting. I assume that you are taking this as a challenge, because getting a 486 working may be difficult. Therte might be better solutions.

I dont know anything about the status or past of these HD's ...as I said I'm just a layman trying to piece a couple of kids computers together..so I dont even know if their any good till I hook em up and try to boot..when they say &quot;no operating system&quot; how can I get past that point..Ive been using a floppy from maxtor for installing their harddrives...and had good luck getting it to load up and format /partition...then reboot to load win98se....I tried to begin fdisk..indos but I dont really understand what Im reading to select... yes the ribbons are attached to a slot card ..you think it might be bad ...I cleaned its connection ..pulled and reseated...checked ribbon for flaws..looks new

The Naxtor floppy did essentially the same thing. You need a boot floppy that includes the option to boot with CD_ROM support. You can make such a boot floppy using anyone's computer that has Win 98 [or 98 SE] on it. Simply go to My Computer, Control Panel, Add/Remove programs. Click the startup disk tab and follow instructions. Watch the floppy light because MS never bothers to tell when the floppy is complete. Then on your computer use the floppy to boot and when the option is offered select boot with CD-ROM support. Don't be surprised if Win 98 doesn't work well on such an old and limited machine.
