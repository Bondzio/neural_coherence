It's a 1 month old hard drive Western Digital elements 1 TB Se portable . But when i connect the HD to the computer it doesn't click anymore... The USB hub works with any other devices (I am running Linux 10.4 ) Any suggestions ? I have googled the clicking sound, and the explanation to that is that the HDD is getting old and is having mechanical problems, and that i should back it up . Again the HDD is 1 month old, i have approximately 100 GB of photos. I also have my files from my Linuc PC backed up (PC crashing) and 2 GB of my Android Phone (Lag and space issues.) I am really concerned, please help me .....
