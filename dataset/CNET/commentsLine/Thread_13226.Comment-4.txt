what you describe is exactly what can happen with messenger.
out of the blue, even with no browsers open, you will get pop-ups on your screen.
go to my site below, scroll down to the free software link, and download one or both of two messenger utilities.
one will disable messenger &quot;mesenger disable&quot;, the other will uninstall it, &quot;shoot the messenger&quot;.
if you like messenger (i hate it) just disable it as it can be reenabled later.
i recommend uninstalling it.
wayne give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach that person to use the internet and they won't bother you for weeks.
