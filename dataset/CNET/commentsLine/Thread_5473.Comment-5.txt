first of all, i want to start by saying i am a person who has 4 backups of my essential data at any given time.
i keep a golden image of my machines as well backup my personal data in several locations.
but to have a complete disk image of a raid array that i want to eventually reach 4tb would just be impractical.
i understand what your saying.
it is important to have backups of your data so you can get everything back in the event of a catastrophe, but all i want to do is build my system with one hard drive now, and add more in the future, the easiest way possible.
