1.1.1	Hi I would like to know if its safe to keep a usb flash key with my backup saved on it in my computor usb drive at all times or when i have finished a backup should i take the usb key out ? .	Ques
1.1.2	This is because i noticed it flashing red when i was not using it .	St
1.1.3	and i was wondering why it was flashing and thought it was spyware or was it just windows XP os or firewall checking it .	St
1.1.4	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	Multiple copies .	St
1.2.3	2 .	St
1.2.4	Remove the media from the site .	St
1.2.5	3 .	St
1.2.6	Write protect the media .	St
1.2.7	There are more but this is not backup as long as there is no write protection , not removed from the computer and no second , third and more copies .	St
1.2.8	I 'm going to answer & quot ; no. & quot ; Bob	St
1.3.1	If you open up Windows Explorer or an open/save dialog in most software ( which opens up a subset of Explorer ) , Windows may do a quick scan of what drives are available on the system , thus making your usb drive blink .	St
1.4.1	No , it 's not a good idea , and here 's why ; a flash drive has a limited life - I 've heard 100,000 & quot ; writes & quot ; mentioned as the limit .	St
1.4.2	If the drive is flashing , it means that it 's being accessed , and it 's life being used up .	St
1.4.3	This is specially true of & quot ; journalling & quot ; OS 's , like NTFS ; a read accesses the drive as much as a write .	St
1.4.4	Burn it to disc ( s ) and get an external hard drive ; most come with backup software .	St
1.4.5	Yes , and burn that to disc .	St
1.4.6	Today is a good day to do this .	St
1.5.1	Bob is absolutely right - if this is your backup - you have no backup if you leave it in the computer .	St
1.5.2	It 's not unknown for USB ports to & quot ; spike & quot ; which can destroy a Flash drive ; if someone accidentally pulls it out without stopping it properly , it can be history ( see archive posts ) and , of course , some klutz like your pet may knock it and break it .	St
1.5.3	To be honest , I do n't think flash drives are a good long term backup device .	St
1.5.4	An external hard drive is better and reasonably affordable these days .	St
1.6.1	Vista has a terrible time with USBs left plugged in .	St
1.6.2	They can seriously effect the start up of an already slow starting OS .	St
1.6.3	I kept mine plugged into the back of my PC to run & quot ; ready boost & quot ; and had loads of problems with it .	St
1.7.1	There could have been changes made in SP2 to have fixed this problem .	St
1.7.2	Bottom line for me is , if I ca n't leave a USB plugged in to run & quot ; Ready boost & quot ; I will not waste the time plugging one in each time I use my PC .	St
1.7.3	The small improvement & quot ; Ready Boost & quot ; provides in performance is simply not worth the effort nor the hassle .	St
1.8.1	I can understand the logic of keeping backups out of harm 's way - up to a point - but I ca n't go along with the idea that flash or pen drives are any more vulnerable to being damaged or corrupted than any other type of drive - quite the reverse in fact .	St
1.8.2	All my PC 's have USB2 expansion cards installed , with an on-card internal socket ; I use a 2 or 4 GB pendrive in that socket as a permanent backup drive for recovery use should the system go down for any reason .	St
1.8.3	In the case of my Xeon server , the original pendrive is still fully functional after six years of logging site and data changes , plus hit counters and IP logs on a daily basis , so I think the point is proven from that angle .	St
1.8.4	The other aspect of the equation is that hard drives are heavy , hot and use a lot of power to drive them , which vastly increases the running costs ; however the move towards SSHD 's is gaining momentum now that initial costs are falling , so we 'll probably see the demise of conventional IDE / SATA drives within the nexr ten years or so .	St
1.8.5	As SSHD 's are little more than parallel-banked flash memory modules , I really do n't see the distinction between them being of any great importance - the HD version is simply a bigger version of the same thing .	St
1.8.6	JB .	St
1.9.1	Thanks every one for the all your helpful advice .	St
1.9.2	The usb flash key is not my only backup .	St
1.9.3	I do have cd rw and cd r backup .	St
1.9.4	There could be something Bob mentioned about the media that i backed up and with the music license that i backed up the write protection and copies .	St
1.9.5	There is also a possibility what mikebliv said about window explorer doing a quick scan of what drives are available on the system making the usb drive blink .	St
1.9.6	My usb flash key has 4GB it is a ready boost available .	St
1.9.7	I do find using it convenient easier than a cd .	St
1.9.8	I will now not leave the key plugged in the pc as a precaution .	St
1.9.9	Thanks Hele	St
