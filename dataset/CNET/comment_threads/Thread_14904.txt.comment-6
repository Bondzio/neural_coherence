You have what they call a fine mess to sort out.
There are no less than 15 ways to get a SATA drive supported in this old OS so think back which method you used.
And be very careful which SATA motherboard port you choose since when you use the IDE EMULATION method I find boards to be picky which we use.
The mystery is partially solved as to why the drive is missing.
Now to see if it shows up when you place the SATA on 0,1,2 or the third port.
