while i do not know that kind of paper ( i deal with printer cartridges) i would recommend the following steps.
1. how much is the most you would spend?
do not look at anything above this price level.
2. brands to consider - hp, xerox, oki 3. then look at specs for each printer in your price range - narrow down the list to 5 or so.
4. consumables - of those five or so that you have narrowed down too, look at the price of the high yield cartridges (if available) and the page yields.
figure out the cost per page (cost/pages).
that will help you with a rough number of what it will cost you to run.
