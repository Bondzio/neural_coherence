Another processor question: Device manager shows 2 processors on my computer and they are both the same. Intel (R) Pentium (r) CPU 4 3.20 Ghz. WHat is the reason for 2 of them? Also shouldn't 3.20 Ghz mean it is a fast computer (which it isn't)? XP Home, Dell Dimension 4700

This CPU has &quot;Dual Core&quot; or the hyperthread feature. &quot;Also shouldn't 3.20 Ghz mean it is a fast computer&quot; No. There are other parts to the system. A fast boat goes slower when dragging an anchor. Bob
