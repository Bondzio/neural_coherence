1.1.1	Did Soyo ever experience this problem ?	Ques
1.1.2	I have an sy-7vcae p3 mobo that has about 3 with a gentle rise on the top .	St
1.1.3	They do n't look like Marty Feldman 's eyes or anything but they are definitely not flat .	St
1.1.4	No leaking or anything evident and the system seems to work fine , but what I 'd like to know is can I just replace them myself and have everything be hunky dory or is there something else I should know ?	Ques
1.1.5	Should I wait for the system to fail should they really be bad or try to head off more serious damage and try to replace them now ?	Sug
1.1.6	The board is far out of warranty .	St
1.2.1	It affected all sorts of electronics since at the time the company making the parts ... had the lowest price .	St
1.2.2	Let me be blunt .	St
1.2.3	Good caps never bulge or distort .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Remember that the mobo is a four layer printed circuit board and the caps may be connected to an inner circuit layer .	St
1.3.2	So make certain that you have the tools and techniques to handle the job without damaging the surrounding artwork .	St
1.3.3	Also since the Caps were probably bought in a large batch , what 's to say that more wo n't go bad soon .	St
1.3.4	Note that after a class action suit , ABIT has just agreed to replace the bad caps on any of their mobos regardless of age .	St
1.3.5	Try complaining to Soyo .	St

1.6.1	I have replaced hundreds of components , but nothing on MOBOs .	St
1.6.2	It 's a tricky business on multilayer boards any time .	St
1.6.3	We used to have solder suckers , vacuum operated with tip temperatures adjusted for the job , which you stuck over the component lead , right on the barrel ( the through plate ) , using lots of resin flux .	St
1.6.4	Good techs could get away with copper braid .	St
1.6.5	But too much heat too long will destroy the bond , particularly if the inner layers are connected to the barrel .	St
1.6.6	It can be salvaged by using small magnet wire to jump the broken connection , if you know where it 's supposed to go .	St
1.6.7	A map of each layer is a big help .	St
1.6.8	It 's also possible to cut the compnent off - not out ! ! !	St
1.6.9	- and do a surface attach to what 's left of the leads .	St
1.6.10	This is an inferior solution mechanically and electrically .	St
1.7.1	Hi Scott : I 've recently experienced the same issue with a Soyo PIII Sy 7IS2 board .	St
1.7.2	This board was in use for only 2.5 years when the machine started freezing abruptly .	St
1.7.3	I discovered 3 domed capacitors on the board .	St
1.7.4	By far the easiest fix is to simply replace the board .	St
1.7.5	( with another brand ) I have also discovered that these older boards are not easy to locate .	St
1.7.6	Newegg has a Tyan Tomcat i815T ( Celeron/PIII ) that will work for me .	St
1.7.7	Best of Luck	St
1.8.1	Excuse if repeated ... Capacitors on thier own , will with time self destruct because they dry out or are exceeding thier capacity .	St
1.8.2	All componets do degrade over time and since mtrbd .	St
1.8.3	makers provide a decent product but not necessary a high level one when you look at all the makers out there , cheap comes to mind .	St
1.8.4	Some hi-end mtrbds , do quite well but others are n't so , thus they in all probability will have some problem .	St
1.8.5	I exclude the caps of the recent make that are known to be defective about 18mos .	St
1.8.6	or more ago when that problem surfaced .	St
1.8.7	I had caps long before that , that blew-up or bludged then leaked .	St
1.8.8	One or two did n't always cause a breakdown but certainly did n't make things stable .	St
1.8.9	If you experience such , replace as you 're capable of .	St
1.8.10	The cost is very low for such caps but the actual job may not be .	St
1.8.11	Since alot of mtrbds .	St
1.8.12	are multi-layered it could be a hassle to unsolder and/or make 100 % contact .	St
1.8.13	But most replace easily provided you 're careful , its certainly worth the try .	St
1.8.14	But heck , if it ai n't broke do n't fix it provided it does deliver the goods sorta speak .	St
1.8.15	enjoy -- -- -Willy	Polite
