1.1.1	Hey..	St
1.1.2	I have been havin a problem ever since i bought my comp .	St
1.1.3	It either restarts automatically or hangs and then restarts .	St
1.1.4	Happens mostly when i am playin a game .	St
1.1.5	My config : amd 64 3800+ gigabite K8N51PVMT motherboard 1GB Hynix ram with a NVidia 7600GT XFX 250 seagate sata2 hdd .	St
1.2.1	It 's been bad since day one .	St
1.2.2	Let them fix it .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	If under warranty , let them fix it as stated by Robert .	St
1.3.2	More than likely you have either a power supply ( PSU ) or cooling problem .	St
1.3.3	The cuase can be effected by either or even both as when gaming , you are pushing the system to extremes .	St
1.3.4	You can try to trottle back abit and see if things settle down .	St
1.3.5	You can also open the case ( no warranty stickers ? ? ? )	Ques
1.3.6	and see if cooling down helps plus usage or a household fan blowing into the case .	St
1.3.7	Cooling problem , add extra fan ( s ) or better ones .	St
1.3.8	If PSU , add a larger wattage unit .	St
1.3.9	Some video cards demand a at least 350W installed plus if with cooling , understand a hot system degrades the PSU thus cause an unstable unit .	St
