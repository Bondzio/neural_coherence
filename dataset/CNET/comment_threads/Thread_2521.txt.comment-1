I have a Seagate External HD.
Plug into port on my comp, lights up so the powers good.
Open &quot;My Computer&quot; in my Windows XP(stop laughing, I know it's old).
Drive shows up but will not open.
After many moments waiting the error message comes up: &quot;Cannot open due to I/O damage&quot; I need all the info recovered as it stores pictures of a recently deceased daughter of mine.
I'm low tech, so take it easy.
I went to Seagate website to download drivers for updating, could not even find my product!
Downloaded Driver Manager and it says it's not plugged in.... Help - I'm confused.
