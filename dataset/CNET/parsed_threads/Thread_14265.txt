<s> I only have 5gb of music on my macbook, which I backed up using a flash drive and that's it. </s>
<s> My macbook is used primarily for surfing the web and not much else. </s>
<s> I was able to erase my hardrive and reinstall using the osx disc provided to me by apple when I bought my macbook. </s>
<s> I came out of it just fine, so I'm wondering if I need to buy an external hd considering I don't have much of anything to backup? </s>
<s> whether you wish to. </s>
<s> It's personal preference, and for me, I do have an external for storing not just my mp3s, but photos taken, documents created and downloaded drivers/softwares, if I'm heading to a place where I won't need or can't use my laptop, I'll just bring the external hdd. </s>
<s> As a backup also is not a bad idea. </s>
<s> I appreciate your input, thanks. </s>
<s> Using a Flash Drive as a backup solution is not really a good idea. </s>
<s> It's better than nothing at all but those things are notoriously unstable and prone to losing their data, especially if they are formatted as FAT and not as HFS+ (The Mac format) I would suggest that you burn a DVD of your iTunes Library and store it somewhere safe. </s>
<s> DVD's are cheap so burning one a month is not going to break the bank. </s>
<s> If you have a program like Toast, it will will span the data across two, or more, DVD's if your data exceeds the capacity of a DVD. </s>

<s> Thanks, I have been contemplating for awhile now using dvd(data) as a primary backup along with my flash drive for my media. </s>
<s> Appreciate the input. </s>
<s> per GB and I manage to 'kill' my flash drive to no-return (totally failed me), a harddisk is personally cheaper, but taking to consideration it consist of moving parts (not the SSD type), it needs to run off some electricity at times to last, longevity-wise, a dvd can last longer. </s>
<s> Thank you for your input and I have decided that a data dvd backup is what I need right now. </s>
<s> I appreciate your input , thanks. </s>
