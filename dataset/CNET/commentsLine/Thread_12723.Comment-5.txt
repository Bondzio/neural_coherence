check one thing.
is your cpu on the support list for the version bios that is in the machine.
checking the next thing -&gt; you don't need any hard disks or cd/dvd drives to save the bios settings.
also, reveal what bios settings you are changing since one poorer (went to the shop counter) soul was overclocking and couldn't understand why his system would reboot on a bios save never to show a screen until the bios settings were reset with a jumper.
expensive lesson about overclocking.
