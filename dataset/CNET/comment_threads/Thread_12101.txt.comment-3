Is that a cordless, optical mouse?
If yes, the light better stay on.
If it doesn't, you will need to replace the batteries in the mouse.
I'm not absolutely sure if it's an optical mouse with a cord that plugs into your PC, but I would thing it the light should go off when you shut-off it's power source, which, of course is the PC it plugs into.
I've never heard of a mouse with an on/off switch.
