<s> I have a eMachines T1840 with sbc yahoo dsl connected to a 2wire Homeportal ethernet router. </s>
<s> Im getting a new Dell Dimension 2400 and what what exactly would i need to share the broadband connection wirelessly? </s>
<s> Also, will it effect the wireless connection if my emachines is on my second floor and my dimension 2400 is in the basement? </s>
<s> Sorry if these questions have been asked over before. </s>
<s> Im a little new at this and dont know where to start. </s>
<s> wireless internally, then a WAP needs to be added. </s>
<s> This WAP can be placed anywhere providing you can run an ethernet cable to it. </s>
<s> The route is up to you and should be placed close enough to the wireless PC to receive a strong signal. </s>
