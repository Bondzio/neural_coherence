Thanks for your help.
And as for the old computer, I've already transferred my data.
I am giving it to a friend and plan to reformat the hard drive first.
I know that won't make my data completely uncovereable, but I don't know of any free programs for that, so reformating is the best I can do.
Thanks again!
