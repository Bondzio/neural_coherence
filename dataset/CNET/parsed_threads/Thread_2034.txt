<s> I Built a new computer with a stock Intel 3 Ghz CPU and Fan. </s>
<s> The Fan is unbelieveable loud. </s>
<s> Is this a common problem with the Intel Fans? </s>
<s> Should I just buy a less loud aftermarket fan? </s>
<s> Any thoughts on why it's so loud? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>

<s> My Intel supplied fans have been very quiet. </s>
<s> If you got some third party fan, I'd believe it, but do call the supplier and ask for an exchange. </s>

<s> Nope, it's a stock Intel fan. </s>
<s> It is so LOUD. </s>
<s> any thoughts? </s>
<s> Also, put in a new case at the same time as CPU. </s>
<s> Could it be the fault of the case? </s>
<s> Thanks Russ </s>
<s> Power down and check the fan blade area to see if anything is touching the fan blades as they spin around. </s>
<s> Every once in awhile, someone will have a bent blade or a cable the is in the wrong place, but I bought some Intel HSFs to replace some third party fans so to drop some noise. </s>
