The goal is to use the monitor without PC for video, and small PC speakers for sound.
I wasn't looking for that when I bought it.
Since I am using a cable box, I really don't need a tuner.
I haven't reached the point of wanting TV on the PC, but that may change.
The spare PC I have is noisy (fans, hard drives) and not suited for a bedroom TV.
Replacing it would be silly as a PC is overkill for only watching TV.
