Alright.....
I printed a large .txt file and it came out OK (9 pages in total - no flaws).
I checked the margins and they're good.
I also tried another .jpg picture and it came out all screwed up again.
This seems to be only affecting picture files.
Weird.
I think I'm going to contact Compaq and if they don't have an answer, out the window the printer goes.
