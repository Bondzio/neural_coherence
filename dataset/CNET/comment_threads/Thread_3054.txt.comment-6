All rechareable batteries have a finite number of recharge cycles, after which they no longer hold their charge.
(The technology only defines the availabe amp/hours/volume.)
Anything you can do to reduce the number of recharges will extend the battery life.
So your saleman was close: Wait till the battery is (almost) discharged, and then give the battery a full recharge.
