Under &quot;Universal Serial Bus controllers&quot; it lists 17 items, &quot;Standard Enhanced PCI to USB Host Controller&quot; (twice), &quot;Standard OpenHCD USB Host Controller&quot; (four times), &quot;USB Root Hub&quot; (8 times), etc.
Each item refers only to &quot;USB&quot;, not USB2 or USB3.
Does this mean I have only USB1 and not USB 2 or 3?
Thanks.
