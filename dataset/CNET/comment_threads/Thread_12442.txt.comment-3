With power-OFF, reseat the CD drives cables(both ends) several times and try again.
If no go, then at least blow out any dust and use a CD cleaner as well.
If the problem persists, then consider the drive is kaput.
These CD drives don't last forever and find a replacement.
You gave no clue of the age of the Dell system but after 1yr.
of use, expect some type of problem.
As for the yellow flag at the device mgr., note what error it displays and google for it.
IMHO, in most cases the drive is kaput and new one usually solves many an issue.
