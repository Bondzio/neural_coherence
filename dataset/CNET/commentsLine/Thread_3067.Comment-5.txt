&quot;and also i'm just wondering that if my motherboard supported triple channel ram would the 12gb work out fine?&quot; re triple channel (or dual channel) ram ... lets clarify this....ram is ram is ram.
the main difference in this case is how it's used.
when the motherboard architecture is dual channel or triple channel, the ram for it is often referred to as dual channel or triple channel ram.
it's really as simple as that.
using dual or triple channel to max efficiency means using 2 or 3 dimms of the same capacity, same speed, etc.
your system is designed for matched dimms in pairs or &quot;dual channell&quot;.
it would really help if you indicated what the objective is.
you've got 8gbs ram which is normally enough for any standalone system and you really want 12gb because ????
going above 4gb or 8gb usually doesn't give a noticeable performance boost.
re &quot;so you suggest i instead get 2x4gb 1333mhz dimms?
and then just replace two of my 2gb dimms with that?&quot; not knowing what the objective is .... it's just one option that uses some of the existing ram, allows you to add new and raise the total ram.
and it doesn't leave you with an extra dimm.
here's an example of a kit for a dual channel memory system ddr3-10600 that i'd consider for an 8gb ram system.
if you get 2 kits ....you have 16gbs ram.
