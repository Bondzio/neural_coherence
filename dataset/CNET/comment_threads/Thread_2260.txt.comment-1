A few yrs.
ago a small &quot;simplified PC&quot; was promoted for a short while.
It was just for email & internet connections; maybe w/ an integrated screen.
I want just that for a second home in FL......as cheaply as possible; for email & to pay bills.
Small size would be a plus as well.
A really cheap notebook would be ideal, but they're not so cheap in my eyes.
Any suggestions are welcome.
Thanks.
