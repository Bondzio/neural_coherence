the answer obviously is varied.
however, i started computer operating in early 60's, programming in mid 60's, in 70's started repairing them, in 80's started building them, so, have a little experience in that line.
my personal uses are, early days was seagate and they went down hill and went to micropolis (they were good drives), tried fujitsu and didn't like them, went to western digital and had too many failures.
went to maxtor and have stuck with maxtor since the latter 80's.
however, maxtor runs in cycles of lasting a good while and then failures frequently.
i have recently gone to seagate again.
however, bought two 120 gigers at the same time, one started scrambling things in about 6 months.
the other currently is ok after two years.
thought i'd try hitachi and that is the first i ever had dead out of the box so wont try them again.
will most likely stick to seagate even if they are slower ie., ata-100 instead of 133, however i think that is changing in the sata side as the one i just bought has 3g capability.
long story short, they seem to run in cycles for brand failure rate.
and, for those that have the old drives, i find they get so slow you can't tolerate them and buy another, however, we can say the work, but not acceptable.
they haven't failed as yet, we just throw them away.
