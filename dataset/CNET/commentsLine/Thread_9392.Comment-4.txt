ummm... yes, it is.
it is in fact the same drive.
lite-on makes a lot of burners for other companies, and sony is one of their biggest customers.
you can check out this list of the oem re-badged lite-on drives to compare which lite-on model is re-badged as which sony model...  lite-on drives for years have been some of the top-rated drives by many of the burner sites, like  i have used lite-on drives for years without ever having a problem... their cd burners go on sale for $20 at fry's all the time... i have installed probably 25 of them... having said that, i will say that in my own computers i have the nec 3520a, which is an awesome drive, too.
absolutely problem free for me, and they are only $38 plus $4 shipping at newegg.com.
they don't have an external right now, though... if you need an external, i would buy the lite-on without hesitation.
