<s> I have a fairly lower end gaming setup consisting of an FX-4100, GTX 650TI, 550W XFX PSU, and a Gigabyte GA-78LMT-S2 Mobo. </s>
<s> I have the graphics card connected to my 23&quot; 1080p Asus Monitor. </s>
<s> I would like to connect my computer to my 720p Tv for throwing a video/movie on every now and again. </s>
<s> This way, I will not have to sit at my desk to watch videos/movies. </s>
<s> I'm not sure whether connecting my TV to the graphics card as a second monitor will lower my gaming performance or not. </s>
<s> I also have the GT 610 that I upgraded from in the closet that I believe I could connect, and use for the second monitor, as well. </s>
<s> I need some suggestions/advice on how I should connect my TV to my desktop in order to get the best performance and usability out of it. </s>
<s> And yes, gaming performance will drop if you play movies at the same time. </s>
<s> I hope we are not going to repeat the discussion why. </s>

<s> I was never planning on doing both at the same time, I will just keep the TV plugged in but only switch it to the HDMI source whenever I need to play a movie or video on it. </s>
<s> Thanks for replying. </s>
<s> Is that it should not matter if the connection is there or not. </s>
<s> However we have reality and with some million different PCs you can't state it will or will not matter. </s>
<s> We know that folk have tried to play a movie and game at the same time so I commented on that result. </s>
<s> As to it simply being plugged in, you'll have to test what happens. </s>
<s> Should not matter but as you suspect, it might matter. </s>
