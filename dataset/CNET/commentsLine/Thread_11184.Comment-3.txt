i did go to the website and download all of the latest drivers and pathces for the motherboard.
(first thing i actually did) i will pick up a new ps and see if that works.
i am still a little concerned about the motherboard being on the cheapy side as well.
tough to rule out something when your faith in it is declining :-/
