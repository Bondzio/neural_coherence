My dell 8300 is a year and a half old but now does not turn on.
Both the power supply and mother board check out ok. Now the problem seems to be between the on/off button to the mother board.
Is there a way to check for this or get around it?
Where would I be able to fine a replacement if needed?
I have check ebay (can replace the whole case) but nothing.
Dell customer service takes to long and will charge a fee just to tell me that I should send it in.
Any help will do thanks.
