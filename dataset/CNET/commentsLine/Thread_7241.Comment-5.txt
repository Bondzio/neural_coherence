expanding upon the points robert mentioned, let's say, just what is the purpose of the system with 64-bit included.
in most cases if you have no directly supported s/w for 64-bit use, its a waste.
further, though the 64-bit can readily support 32-bit s/w, etc.
it still just waits to breathe fully regardless of memory installed.
for all intends and purposes think of it as a ferrari, having to go only 2mi.
to work and at 35mph, other than show and tell, a family van would have gotten the job done.
but heck, if you want it its not going to hurt overall too greatly provided you want simple demands from it and then expand from that.
of course, any glitches, etc., they have to be 64-bit world fixes.
why not google for 64-bit issues and base something on that.
