- Disconnect the router (repeater) from the 1st router and power cycle.
- Connect a computer to a LAN port on the router (repeater) in order to configure it.
If you can't log in, you may need to reset to factory defaults.
- Under &quot;Advanced&quot; and &quot;LAN Setup&quot;, uncheck &quot;Use Router as DHCP Server&quot;.
Then select &quot;Apply&quot; and reset router.
- Connect the LAN port from the first router to a LAN port on the second router (don't use the WAN or Internet port).
Power cycle both devices.
- You should be able to reconnect all devices with no IP conflict, since all devices will get an IP address via DHCP from the first router.
