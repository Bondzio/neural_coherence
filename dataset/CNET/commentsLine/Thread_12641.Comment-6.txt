just remember this: even if you manage to make it work, when problems occur your ics solution: * will not be supported by the people that made your router; * will not be supported by microsoft, apple, or the people that made your computers; * will not be supported by sprint/verizon/at&t/alltel or any other carrier or isp; * will require you to keep one computer on (not asleep) to feed the others; * will add some wear and tear to your routing computer; * can affect performance on all computers, depending on type of internet activity; * always have certain types of activities that simply may not work right.
