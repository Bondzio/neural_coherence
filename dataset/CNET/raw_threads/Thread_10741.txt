4562	0	176585	1938951	NR	comadore17	5/15/06 6:03 PM	1.14771618E12	Raid-0 Configuration	I am looking to run two Seagate 250GB 7200 16MB Ultra ATA Hard Drives with a Raid-0 configuration and am looking for some ideas for what computer to run these on. I'll be capturing images off of 8mm tape and need something fast enough to keep up with the process. Any help would be appreciated.
