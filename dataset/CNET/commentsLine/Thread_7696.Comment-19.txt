hp is a good mak no doubt but you can probably get a better computer from alienware (  ).
your price range fits the lower end of their line (but these are still excellent because alienware set a very high standard).
also what is good about the alienware computers is because before you buy it you can choose everything in it from how big your cache is to hard drive to what opertaing system you have.
they do you look a bit different.
but i assure you they are very very fast and efficient.
they are good computers and are fully customizable.
also you said you wanted the computer for gaming aswell.
well alienware are practically the kings of gaming computers!!
