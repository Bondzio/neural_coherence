widely noted at  is the need for the (person!)
installer of xp to have: 1. current bios.
2. usb in bios enabled.
3. motherboard and possibly usb drivers installed.
none of these items are performed by microsoft for most machines and certainly not items 1 and 2. in closing usbman notes many issues with some onboard chipsets that can result in mis-identifying an usb device or failure.
if you can tell the make/model of the motherboard or chipset, i'd point to more specific usbman articles.
