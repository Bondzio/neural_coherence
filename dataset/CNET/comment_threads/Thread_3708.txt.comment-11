The performance of the cards are very close and I think the X850 XT has a narrow lead over the 6800.
I would get the 6800 ultra because it supports shader model 3.0.
Just make sure you have TWO power connectors handy.
If you don't then the 6800 GT would be my next choice, which only needs one.
The card takes up 2 slots in the case.
