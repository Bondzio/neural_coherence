<s> Id like to think im atleast semi comptuer literate, but the reality of the situation is that when it comes to computer hardware i really have no idea what im talking about. </s>
<s> Thats why i come to places like these to get suggestions from people that are far smarter than i am. </s>
<s> Anyway, i have a eMachines T2890. </s>
<s> Sad, but its still a computer. </s>
<s> http://emachines.com/support/product...es&model=T2890 Thats all the system specs for everything. </s>
<s> Anyways, im looking to upgrade the computer so i can play some games. </s>
<s> Im not talking top of the line games, but like World Of Warcraft and stuff like that. </s>
<s> Ive already put a 512 ram card in it, so i have a grand total of 768mb of ram. </s>
<s> Im looking for suggestions on other upgrades i should do to make my computer run games better. </s>
<s> I was thinking about putting like a geforce 6800 in. </s>
<s> Or maybe more ram. </s>
<s> Any suggestions are appreciated. </s>
<s> Also, with a video card, how do i check if its compatible with my computer? </s>
<s> Remember, im not to literate when it comes to computer hardware. </s>
<s> According to EmachineUpgraders.info, the motherboard has integrated graphics. </s>
<s> It has no dedicated graphics slots (AGP or PCI Express X16). </s>
<s> It does have 3 PCI slots. </s>
<s> Bottom line: Looks like the best you can do is to add a PCI video card (not PCI Express X16 and not AGP). </s>
