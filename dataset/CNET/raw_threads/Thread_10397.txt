Ideally I'd like one that can feed in postcards (card stock) and envelopes too. A legal size tray as well would be great! I'm thinking of a dell 3100 or 5100 (can't remember the difference off the top). Thought the group would have some ideas. I'd like to keep it under $500 and it won't need to do more than 1000 sheets a month.

So I guess I don't need legal size from them, but having both would be great. Any other good printers have both letter and legal size trays out of the box?
