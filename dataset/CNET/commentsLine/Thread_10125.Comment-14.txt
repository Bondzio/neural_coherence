i use soyo motherboards to build my computers, and they have a display that shows at startup what the cpu temp is, plus a utility with a temperature display.
i dont know that the temps that are shown are accurate, but they do show relative temperatures when they change.
recently i noticed that the machine i'm currently using was running quite a bit hotter than when i built it.
one hot day windows shut down because the temp had reached the danger limit i had set.
when built the cpu temp showed an average of about 136* f. when it shut down it showed 170*.
when i opened the case the first thing i did was remove the cpu heat sink fan.
as i suspected, there was a thin layer of dust over the top of the cooling fins.
very little air was being blown down between them.
i cleaned them and, of course, all the case openings, etc.
as well.
now all is well and it's running at 136* again.
