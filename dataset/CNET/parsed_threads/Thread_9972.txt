<s> I want to set up Xbox Live in my room. </s>
<s> I allready have a wireless network setup. </s>
<s> i wanted to know if I could bridge the internet connection from the wireless USB adaptor to the network card and then plug my Xbox into the network card. </s>
<s> I've never heard of such a setup. </s>
<s> All the working setups I've seen are internet to router and then some connection from the xbox to the router. </s>
<s> Anything else and it's up to you to sort it out. </s>

<s> Do you know if it is at all possible? </s>
<s> I was just wondering. </s>
<s> I will still be able to hook up to my wireless router if the bridge doesnt work. </s>
<s> I'm going to write no. </s>
<s> The parts and such you noted are interesting but why would I not use an accepted and working solution? </s>
<s> If you want to create a new setup, then go ahead but you will have to do it yourself since it is your creation. </s>
