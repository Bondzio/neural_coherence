xp home on dell dimension.
Printer makes a loud sound like something-a gear tooth etc, is malfunctioning when it ejects a print.
I read the posts on the noise the printer makes at the BEGINNING but my noise occurs only at the END.
Prints seem to be fine but I stopped using it because I was fearful of damaging it.
I examined the case and could not find any loose objects in the printer innards.
Any suggestions?
Thanks in advance and happy holidays.
