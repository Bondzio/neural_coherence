I recently converted all family videos (dating back to the 50's) onto DVD.
I have two copies of each.
One kept at a relatives house.
And the other in the safe at my house.
I know DVDs don't last forever, so how often should I re-burn them all?
Is there anything else I should do to make sure they are safe?
Should I rip them all to my hard drive as well, even if its going to take 50gb?
