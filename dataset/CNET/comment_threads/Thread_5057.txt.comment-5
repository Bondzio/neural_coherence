I put an 80 gig WD HD in a cheap plastic enclosure case, and it's been running fine for months- I've even forgotten to turn it off, and luckily didn't toast it.
But, as Bob said, it's TEMPORARY STORAGE.
It's convenient to carry about, works really fast on my usb 2 connection, and my network sees it.
All fine and good.
BUT- I've still archived everything important to cd/dvd disks.
Disaster strikes just when you least expect it....which reminds me, I haven't backed up some important stuff in awhile....thanks for reminder, Bob!
