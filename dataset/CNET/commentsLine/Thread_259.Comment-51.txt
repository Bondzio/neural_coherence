ted when i went to device manager and double-clicked on cd/dvd drives, all i got was the names of the two drives.
i didn't see the drivers tab.
did you mean the update driver icon along the top of the screen?
i wish i could talk to you about this.
ann ps i found your note about the external drive.
thanks
