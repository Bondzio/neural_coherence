1.1.1	Help - my flat monitor screen is now & quot ; wavy & quot ; whenever I scroll up and down on a page .	St
1.1.2	I do n't know why this started or how to end it .	St
1.1.3	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.2.1	Redrover , Start with connecting a good old CRT in stead of the LCD to see what happens .	St
1.2.2	It 's an easy swap .	St
1.2.3	If that 's OK I suspect the monitor itself .	St
1.2.4	If that 's wavy either , I suspect the videocard ( or the driver , but that 's a rather theoretical option , I think ) .	St

1.3.1	wavy ?	Ques
1.3.2	like a narrow large S on the left and right ?	Ques
1.3.3	or it waves as you scroll , as you said ?	Ques
1.3.4	This usually means you do n't have enough video power , video ram ; pics and web pages should also take a bit to load all the way down .	St
1.3.5	This usually happens with 2mb , maybe 4mb Vram .	St
1.3.6	Download and use Aida32 utility to check ... A flat screen does n't need more Vram , so the previous idea of another monitor ( CRT ) is good-quick .	St
1.3.7	XP ?	Ques
1.3.8	W98 ?	Ques
1.3.9	DirectX 8.1 or above ?	Ques
1.4.1	It waves as I scroll up and down on a page .	St
1.4.2	It 's supposed to be smooth .	St
1.4.3	I have to stop scrolling for the wave to catch up so I can read what 's on the page .	St
1.4.4	I have Windows XP .	St
1.5.1	redrover , Check drivers first ... . Then try to slow down the Hwd acceleration .	St
1.5.2	Display Properties - & gt ; Settings - & gt ; Advance Open Troubleshoot tab - & gt ; slow down Hwd acceleration slider is in middle of window .	St
1.5.3	This happened to my main system after upgrade to GeForce2 MX/MX400 video card and third monitor .	St

1.6.1	I formatted the drive in my sons 's Gateway laptop after backing up all data .	St
1.6.2	After installing XP PRO and Office 2003 and running all updates I discovered the same wavy screen .	St
1.6.3	The device manager showed the VGA graphics drivers missing .	St
1.6.4	The correct driver would not download to this workstation .	St
1.6.5	I downloaded and transferred across the network .	St
1.6.6	The file extracted .	St
1.6.7	I then pointed the driver reinstall to the cab files for this download and it installed falwlessly .	St
1.6.8	No more wavy screen and the device mgr shows the drivers to be intact .	St
1.6.9	He also runs a second monitor ( CRT FLAT SCREEN ) and it works fine .	St
1.6.10	One neat trick is if you do not want the laptop monitor on , crank up the resolution where the laptop monitor can not perform and it will shutdown .	St
1.6.11	Now you can use only the CRT external if need be .	St
1.7.1	I turned the slider all the way to the left and now the scrolling is perfect ... Thanx for the fix..MG	St
