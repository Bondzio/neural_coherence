11832	0	54485	649487	NR	gbwanabe	1/1/05 10:24 AM	1.10457504E12	Can I use a 4x or better AGP on a 2x board?	I have an older Compaq and want to upgrade the video card . Will the newer 4x or better cards be backwards compatible on the 2x board or will I be wasting power and not see much improvement? Rob

At even 50 bucks the fx5200's are aplenty. http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=FX5500-128MTV&cat=VCD is a fx5500 for 59 bucks and my kid could play Far Cry at some settings with ease on his P4. The fx5200 is ten bucks less all over, but I'd go one step up. Bob
