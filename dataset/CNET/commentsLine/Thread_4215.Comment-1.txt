so i own a dell inspiron m5010, which came equipped with a 320gb, 5400 rpm samsung spinpoint m7 (hm321hi) hdd.
after about 3 months, the hdd became unusable due to a high count of bad sectors (&gt;500).
i've replaced the broken hdd with a brand new, identical hdd which reached a bad sector count of over 250 in ~1 month.
i have then upgraded the hdd to a 500gb, 7200 rpm samsung spinpoint m7 (hm500ji); at the moment it has 166 bad sectors in about 2 months of usage.
i did not use the laptop under harsh conditions, it is not filled with dust, it did not suffer mechanical shocks.
what should i be on the lookout for?
the current hdd temperature varries from 42-45 when idling to ~52-54 when playing a video game or using it extensively and the cpu temperature is always above 59 degrees celsius, even when first booting up the laptop.
also, the original power supply stopped working after 4 months since i purchased the laptop and i have replaced it with another 90w power supply.
fun fact: a few (1-8) sectors were being marked as &quot;bad&quot; almost every time the song changed in an youtube playlist; not always, but most of the time.
