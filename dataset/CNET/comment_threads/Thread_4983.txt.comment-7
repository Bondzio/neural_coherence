Coryphaeus' reply sums it up nicely: &quot; All drives connected to a PC use a common recycle bin, although the &quot;deleted&quot; data still resides on the original drive.
&quot; Windows only has one Recycle Bin.
However, the Recycle Bin is not a folder in and of itself; it is a virtual folder that simply displays all recoverable files previously deleted from currently-mapped storage devices.
Thus, you are correct that the files are actually stored in hidden system folders on the respective drives, and that occasional glitches can occur such that the files remain but do not appear in the Recycle Bin.
Nevertheless, those are known as recycler folders, not the unified Recycle Bin, which Coryphaeus alluded to in his original reply over four years ago.
And, just to be clear, those individual recycler folders exist, and are used, regardless of whether you choose to manage the drives' maximum allocation independently.

I have pruned this thread so that the original discussion is not overshadowed by today's dispute.
