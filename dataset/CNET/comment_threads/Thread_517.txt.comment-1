If a motherboard, such as my Gigabyte GA-6BXC, has settings to allow a maximum of FSB 133MHz and clock ratio of up to 9.5 will the board support processors up to 133x9.5?
My GA-6BXC manual says it will only support a FSB up to 100MHz, but does not state a max clock ratio for the speed, will it support a 950MHz CPU?
The latest BIOS update gives support for a Celeron 733 but no Pentium is noted.
Please help, I'm looking to upgrade the processor.
