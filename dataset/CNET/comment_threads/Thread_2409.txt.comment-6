I recall offering advice that what you may have spent on phone support could buy a new 40 to 120GB drive that is likely as fast as that 20GB drive.
RAID would be debateable since installation methods are quite diverse so what I know may not apply.
In fact, I prefer boring stable and fast setups over faster and unsupportable any day of the week.
If this was my machine, I wouldn't have the dataloss issues, but would move the 20GB drives to normal ATA ports, and just plow ahead.
DVD writers fell below 80 dollars and 40+GH of DVD-RW disks were all of 20 bucks.
That's one backup set and if the data wasn't worth that much, then what can be written?
