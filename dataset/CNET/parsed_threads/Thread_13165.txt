<s> I have a Sony Micro Vault USM8GL flash drive that is not recognized by any computer that i stick it into. </s>
<s> The last time that I tried to access it it said that something about it being a security device and I popped it out. </s>
<s> Everysine then I have not been able to acess the data on the flash drive. </s>
<s> It is a 8GB drie and nearly full. </s>
<s> It has all of my most precious data on it icluding baby photo's, the book i have been writing and tax information. </s>
<s> I am thinking that somehow it was converted to a security device but I have searched high and low on how to change that as well with no luck whatsoever. </s>
<s> I am quite desperate. </s>
<s> I have not backed it up because of time. </s>
<s> So please don't give me any smart remarks about being stupid for not backing it up....i know that i was a fool for not backing it up. </s>

<s> It lists the most common, free and free to try recovery softwares. </s>
<s> Again, the post title is &quot;Lost and Found.&quot; </s>
<s> Your suggested reference seems to cover hard drives, not flash drives. </s>
<s> I also experienced a sudden &quot;USB Drive not recognized&quot; on my Lenovo ThinkPad laptop with Win XP on a Philips 4Gb pen drive that had been working flawlessly for a year or two, losing access to the 3.75 Gb of data stored on it :-(( Tried on one other PC with same result. </s>
<s> Any suggestions for a possible recovery? </s>
<s> The titles have been used on USB drives as well. </s>
<s> Sorry but it's a shame to post and reply rather than you do a little research or try the free titles anyway. </s>
<s> A shame because we could be discussing if Linux boot CDs found it or not. </s>
<s> Lose a turn? </s>

<s> I may have lost a turn but you sound unreasonably peeved, and anyway your post in the referenced top thread says: &quot;This post is mostly for missing drive letters and not corrupt drives. </s>
<s> For this to apply your USB stick or drive works fine in other machines. </s>
<s> That is, all machines but yours.&quot; I had stated that I have already tried my unrecognised USB stick on one another machines with no luck. </s>
<s> As regards: &quot;A shame because we could be discussing if Linux boot CDs found it or not.&quot; I tried the UBUNTU bootable CD without luck, either: no sign of any USB devices there, unless I should have looked in some mysterious location that I missed. </s>
<s> Drink something mild to soothe your bruised nerves. </s>
<s> Cheers. </s>
