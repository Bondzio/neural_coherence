In combination with a call to the makers helpline I was able to access the firmware directly on the router and reset the channel.
I never had a clue that there were different broadcast channels [like a phone] and of course this makes sense.
It fixed the problem so I can connect from my IBM laptop, but my Sony still does not work - It shows the network and connects automatically then disconnects about 2 seconds later.
It flips back anf forth, connected -- diconnected every couple of seconds.
Any ideas?
