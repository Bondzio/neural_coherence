The network drive will not map unless the VPN connection is completed first. As I usually use my company laptop for this purpose, I have found that if I check off the &quot;reconnect at log on&quot; box while mapping the network drive, it fails to do so at login because the VPN is not yet connected. I tried adding the VPN shortcut to my start up program but Windows trys to logon the network drive prior to processing this folder. Can I set this up so that the VPN will connect first and then map the drive afterwards, each time I start up my laptop? I am using Windows XP Pro and shut down the laptop after each use for transport. Thanks Mike

Logon to the computer and open up the VPN. Go to options and then click on &quot;Windows Logon Properties&quot;. A new box will open...select &quot;Enable Start Before Logon&quot;. Essentially this will cause the VPN to start right when the user hits Ctrl+Alt+Del. This should resolve the drive mapping issue. Hope this helps! Eric.
