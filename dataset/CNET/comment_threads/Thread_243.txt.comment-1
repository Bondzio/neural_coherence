Getting a Dell 4700 WinXP to replace 5 yo Gateway Win98se.
What software do you recommend for transferring files from the old to the new?
A lot of picture folders, all my email (Outlook Express), over 100 desktop shortcuts, PrintMaster, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe PhotoDeluxe, Quicken, Word etc.
Thanks jbt
