Want a system that will handle music, video, web (including some with heavy cpu usage like Google Earth) with speed, but don't do any gaming. Is a Pentium outdated and best to stay away from? What about DD2 v. DDR3 RAM? Thinking of buying a Dell, but have looked at HP, as well. Also, want to prevent malware/viruses from making my new system slow. What is the best way to go about it (i.e., firewall that comes with the system? Specific anti-virus software? Can I just stay away from untrusted sites?).

It depends whether or not you trust using free programs or would rather spend money for a program.
