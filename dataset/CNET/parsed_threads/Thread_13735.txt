<s> I'd like to know how to &quot;delete&quot; a single backed up folder.Searched the manual and help and it just seems to describe to use the &quot;reformat&quot; feature.I must be missing something as this would erase the operating software for the hard drive it's self. </s>
<s> And I would be guessing if I guessed you were asking about some backup software but to delete a folder in Explorer is pretty basic for a Windows user. </s>
<s> They click on the folder then tap the Delete key. </s>

<s> Sorry I didn't make that clear.I can't find how to delete a back up folder on the western digital external hard drive.The only reference is to right click on the drive icon and click &quot;format&quot;on the drop down menu.All I have stored on this external drive at present is my &quot;music folder&quot; </s>
<s> Again, I would have to guess if there was some backup application in play here. </s>
<s> I don't use any that come with drives since I found them buggy, trouble, and proprietary. </s>

<s> Are you using the Windows 7 backup program, the WD supplied backup program, something else, what? </s>
<s> Personally I've been using Norton Ghost for the last 8 years and haven't had the first problem with it. </s>
<s> You can get it for next to nothing if you watch the sales. </s>
<s> Another good alternative is Easeus todo backup free which you can download from http://www.todo-backup.com/products/home/free-backup-software.htm . </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Sorry for delay in responding but was out of town.I used the WD Smartware prog. </s>
<s> loaded on the WD My Passport.I did some additional searching and for the benefit of others I'll note how you can do &quot;deletions&quot; without formating the drive.With your my passport drive connected go to ....computer\external drive(my passport)\smartware.swstor folder and you can delete any file you select in there.Why this isn't detailed in the &quot;user manual&quot; is beyond me. </s>
