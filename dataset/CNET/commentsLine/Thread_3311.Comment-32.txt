the nec is a ide interface correct?
the plextor is a sata interface.
here are the newegg specs on it... write speed: 12x dvd+r, 4x dvd+rw, 8x dvd-r, 8x dvd-rw, 48x cd-r, 24x cd-rw read speed: 48x cd-rom, 16x dvd-rom interface: sata buffer: 8mb os support: windows xp/ 2000 features: lossless linking technology, buffer underrun proof technology, powerec, gigarec, q-check, securec, silent mode.
here are the specs on the 3500... cache size 2 mb dvd specs dvd+r dl write speed 4x dvd+r write speed 16x dvd+rw rewrite speed 4x dvd-r dl write speed 4x dvd-r write speed 4x dvd-rw rewrite speed 4x dvd read speed 16x dvd access time 140 ms cd specs cd write speed 48x cd rewrite speed 24x cd read speed 48x assuming buffer is synonymous(sp?)
with cache, the plextor has more, but otherwise they look to be fairly similar...
