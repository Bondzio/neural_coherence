but let me comment on &quot;router.&quot; this one has changed in definition over the years.
my first router back in 1990 did exactly what the name implied.
today, 2009 the &quot;router&quot; is that consumer piece of gear that comes with wifi, router with nat, switched hub and more.
without nailing down the year you want to define this in and a context the exact definition can be fluid.
