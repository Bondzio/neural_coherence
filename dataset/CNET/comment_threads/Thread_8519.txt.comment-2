Having a good and stable psu is a plus for any system.
When OC'ing that isn't a real problem as any added wattage is minor as the same demands pretty much stay the same.
The real concern is cooling, thus the system MUST BE COOLED to handle all the added heat output and stress placed on the system.
SO your real problem is you OC and thus address that.
Find the stable OC level you can maintain and be happy, otherwise, you will find the weakest link and it isn't necessary the psu.
Once into extreme demands, then all componets must be rated or able to handle the extra demands placed on them, to include ram, video, and cpu being they are good devices&componets you find the level it can sustain.
good luck -----Willy
