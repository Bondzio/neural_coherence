not going into much technical detail choose any one of the following 1) radeon hd 6870 : or 6950 for more power 2) any 80 plus certified psu minimum 550w :corsair and antech are good choice hd 6870 is a decent card.
my brother has it (with intel i7) and plays all kinds of new games in hd monitor (1920x1200), with all details maxed and at decent frame rates: get a good psu.
80 plus means 80% effeciency or higher.
corsair, antech and cooler master is a good choice.
