I really know nothing about the inside of my computer so I am wondering if I need to get the exact same kind of power supply or can they be upgraded? Thanks

The only noteable items are the dimensions and the fan placements (look at that one under the PSU rather than the ends.) Dimensionally it looks like a stock ATX supply and you'll look at your case to see if you have space to accomodate any number of supplies from http://www.compgeeks.com/products.asp?cat=CAS#Power%20Supplies You can fit a much higher wattage PSU such as the 450 Watt units without any negative side effects since the computer parts only draw what is needed. This can be cheap to fix. Bob
