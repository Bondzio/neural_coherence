1.2.1	After you are connected to the VPN Search for the computer you are looking for .	St
1.2.2	You should then be able to double click on it and access the shared folders ...	St
1.3.1	Once you VPN to the other machine , it 's not unlike you unplugged from your network and plugged into that remote network .	St
1.3.2	To allow access to both at the same time would be a violation of what a VPN does .	St
