1.1.2	the fans and lights are on , but it is not doing anything with the HD , i have tried several different harddrives to see if it will work but attempts were futile , does anyone have a solution for this ?	Ques

1.2.1	& quot ; Tip : If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem , please be sure to include all the necessary information ( ie : operating system , model number , hardware , software , etc ) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution. & quot ; Not a whisper of what make/model or any part and the wattage of the power supply .	St
1.2.2	I 've seen many issues , but you supplied nothing for the forum to comment on .	St
1.2.3	Start very small .	St
1.2.4	A piece of cardboard , the CPU/HeatSinkFan ( HSF ) , Power Supply Unit ( PSU ) , Motherboard and a Speaker .	St
1.2.5	Plug just that on the cardboard and touch the power up jumper with a metal pen tip or jumper .	St
1.2.6	Beeps are a good sign .	St
1.2.7	No beeps and one of the four parts are misconfigured or dead .	St

1.4.2	( such as the processor )	St
1.5.1	The AMD would self-destruct if the heat sink is left off .	St
1.5.2	You omitted the results of the cardboard test and the wattage of the power supply .	St
1.5.3	For that list , the usual 450 Watt PSU is fitted .	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	power supply is 350W	St
1.7.1	http : //www.tomshardware.com/cpu/20010917/index.html Great way to show the issue .	St

1.8.1	Much like driving your car at 120 MPH , it wo n't last long .	St
1.8.2	NEVER STRESS the power supply .	St
1.8.3	But it 's sufficient to get the machine up and tested , but you wo n't find me trusting it .	St
1.8.4	I 'd expect it to overheat , randomly crash , stress the motherboard capacitors and eventually need replacement of PSU and motherboard .	St
