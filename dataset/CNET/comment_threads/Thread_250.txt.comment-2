Almost all such machines have the PATA IDE interface you can add your 250GB drive internally and set the BIOS to boot from what you want.
Only requirement?
A whopper power supply and great cooling.
Today's USB 2.0 drive enclosures are fine, but don't delude yourself that the data on that drive will stick around.
Almost all require me to partition and format over 127GB drives in the new USB enclosure.
