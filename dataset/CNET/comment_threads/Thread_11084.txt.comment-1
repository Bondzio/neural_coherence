Having problems with both CDRW and DVD.
Windows sees the drives in &quot;My Computer&quot; but is having problem reading data or even recognizing that a CD is in the drive.
Was trying to Burn a CD today and got a message that an error was received from the &quot;Output Device&quot; (the CDRW) with the suggestion to check that the drive is installed.
Does this mean to check the cables like I saw recommended in another post?
I would think that if a cable is loose or disconnected that the drive wouldn't even be recognized.
I was able to reboot once and the drive recognized data on a CD but would not burn a CD.
Will also do some housecleaning inside .
Thanks patti
