program that it comes with.....and enter all of the configurations there.
i about went crazy trying to get the correct settings of svideo vs the other options only because i wasn't using the tv at all and was instead trying to configure it for my vcr.
a couple of emails back and forth with ati tech support got me up and running pretty quickly and i kept the notes on what i needed to do.....but it was all in the tv player program settings and they were the same for a vcr as they would have been for the tv so start there.
if you need more help, post back and i'll hunt down the notes i took about this.
