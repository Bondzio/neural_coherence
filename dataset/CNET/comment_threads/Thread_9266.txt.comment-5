I use CLONEZILLA.
I didn't read ANY manual or documentation and am able to store IMAGES of machines to such a drive with a single partition.
I find partitions to vanish on folk so I shy away from that advice.
But if you feel it's the answer, go for it.
The CNET STORAGE FORUM is testament to how we can't trust hard drives and more so EXTERNAL HARD DRIVES so make plans for backup and don't let it be the only place a file could be found.
