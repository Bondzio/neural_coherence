The problem that I'm having is simple. When using the cordless phone, I notice a pulsing sound in the background, which I'm sure is the routers signal. That I can deal with. The real concern here is that sometimes when the phone rings, I'll go to answer it and it won't pick up. Is a 2.4ghz router supposed to work alongside a 2.4ghz phone (except for the pulsating noise)? Should I consider paying more for a 5.8ghz phone or can I just get another 2.4 phone that isn't a piece of junk?

Try relocating the router for one. If there is no improvement I would consider changing to a 802.11a/g(5ghz/2.4ghz range) router or change the frequency of the phone.
