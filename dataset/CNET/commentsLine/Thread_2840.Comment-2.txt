these externals are just copies, not &quot;storage&quot; and prone to a much higher failure rate than internals.
-&gt; the most common data saving trick i use is to put the hard drive from that old enclosure into a new one.
however there are consumers that won't do this and will have to take it to a shop counter or demand the maker recover the data.
-&gt; what do i use?
hard disks from newegg.com or geeks.com and an enclosure.
