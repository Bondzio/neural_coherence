thnx for ur reply i think u r asking me to refer to the open source wep cracking stuff.
is there a direct vbscript or any other program sources available for listing the sta's under an ssid like a vbscript that i've got for listing the ap's.
i mean to ask is there any official and diplomatic way in knowing the sta's without using the hacking and cracking stuff.... hoping for ur reply.... baskaran
