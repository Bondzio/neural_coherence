<s> I need a new computer. </s>
<s> I have narrowed it to either the HP d4100e or the Dell Precision 380. </s>
<s> Both will have two hard-drives for automatic data backup. </s>
<s> I am customizing either way. </s>
<s> Mainly, I am trying to decide on which product is more reliable. </s>
<s> Both will cost around $2000; the HP is a little cheaper. </s>
<s> The good thing about Dell is that they will send someone to my house to set up and transfer my data from my old computer to my new one. </s>
<s> This is great. </s>
<s> HP won't do this. </s>
<s> I can't do it myself, and it could cost a lot to hire someone. </s>
<s> (This accounts for the difference in price between the two computers -- around $200 for Dell to have someone transfer data) I had bought a Gateway about 8 months ago, but it did not work very well when I received it. </s>
<s> (Kept dumping memory) After a couple of weeks on the phone with Gateway and a visit by their tech guy to my house, I sent it back for a full refund. </s>
<s> This was after their set-up guy had spent four hours at my house transferring data. </s>
<s> Gateway ate the cost for this when the computer didn't work. </s>
<s> So here I am still with the old, slow computer. </s>
<s> It is a Dell Dimension -- it has not been great, but at least it is still standing. </s>
<s> Its problem is that it is slow and sometimes has error messages. </s>
<s> Dell told me four years ago (not long after I bought it) to wipe the hard drive and start over with putting in the operating system. </s>
<s> I didn't do it due to the data transfer problem. </s>
<s> (It is Windows Millenium) So.... what do I do? </s>
<s> I also want to get a notebook. </s>
<s> I like to use two computers at once. </s>
<s> I have gotten spoiled -- doing research on one while writing on the other. </s>
<s> I was thinking of getting the HP zv6000 notebook. </s>
<s> I have been using an HP zv5000 for the past year (it belongs to someone else), and it has worked ok. </s>
<s> But it has to do nothing. </s>
<s> It has hardly any data or programs on it... so my experience may not really count. </s>
<s> Last, any other suggestions for comptuers? </s>
<s> Although I really hate to start over now. </s>
<s> I plan to get the desktop first, then get a notebook in about a month. </s>
<s> As for what I need.... </s>
<s> I write a lot. </s>
<s> I create and work my own websites. </s>
<s> This is hundreds of pages. </s>
<s> I have a lot of photos. </s>
<s> I am taking a Photoshop class now, so plan to do more advanced photo work. </s>
<s> I am thinking of getting into podcasting. </s>
<s> I want two hard-drives -- so I can automatically back up my data. </s>
<s> I would die if I lost my files. </s>
<s> A friend told me to get a Sony, but it is expensive and does not seem conducivve to customization. </s>
<s> Looking for wisdom. </s>
<s> I cannot build a computer -- I can do nothing more than turn the thing on. </s>
<s> Thanks, Charlotte </s>
<s> i have sa4000t. </s>
<s> Pretty much same as d4100e. </s>
<s> Works good. </s>
<s> i guess. </s>
<s> But seems expensive even to building your own. </s>
<s> My suggestion, get a friend who enjoys building and won't charge you. </s>
<s> ROger </s>
<s> I own one and they do not support their computers, If you're not sure what you're doing don't suffer contradictory information at the hands of Dell support. </s>
<s> Most of the people I know who own an HP are not complaining, I don't really know what to suggest beyond a little observation about these things, I don't know enough tech stuff to provide you with much more. </s>
<s> Buy a Mac? </s>
