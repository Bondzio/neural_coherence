<s> About a week ago, my computer started giving me this error message, so I Googled it. </s>
<s> I rebooted it, and immediately went to it again. </s>
<s> I tried going into the BIOS, and tried CD ROM first. </s>
<s> I have a Windows XP Service Pack CD(I forgot to mention I have that version of Windows), and tried that. </s>
<s> When I put it in my CD ROM drive, it goes in, does nothing, and the door opens up. </s>
<s> So, I put it in the DVD and it spins, but nothing happens. </s>
<s> I have tried F8, F10, and nothing. </s>
<s> There are tons of files, pics, that I really can't lose. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> WE NEVER REPAIR THE FILE SYSTEM OR OS ON THAT HARD DISK. </s>
<s> -&gt; NEVER! </s>
<s> We pull that hard disk out and set it aside. </s>
<s> A new blank drive is put in and we install the OS, drivers and get the machine working. </s>
<s> If your CD dose not boot we fix that too (new CD, new CD drive, whatever it takes.) </s>
<s> Now that we have a working machine we add the old drive on the slave or other connections and get our files back. </s>

<s> I forgot to mention that I am not real tech-savvy, so all of that is pretty much over my head. </s>
<s> You either start learning or have it done. </s>
<s> -&gt; Your plight is not unheard of because no one that sells you these beasts will tell you to put what you can't lose on CD/DVD/other places and if they did you might ask them &quot;How?&quot; Bob </s>
<s> Read above </s>
<s> The help is in the second post. </s>
<s> If you feel you can't do that, find a repair shop to do it for you. </s>
<s> Nothing to be ashamed of. </s>
<s> When my daughters laptop needed a new hard disk (well, it turned out it needed a new motherboard) I went to repairshop also. </s>
