1.1.1	I have a Dell Optiplex GX150 1Ghz with 128MB double-sided SDRAM ( 133MHZ ) installed .	St
1.1.2	I was wanting to install more RAM so I saw a single-sided 128MB SDRAM 133MHZ stick on ebay .	St
1.1.3	I bought it and installed it .	St
1.1.4	The computer recognized it and upped my memory total to 256MB , but crashed during startup , sometimes displaying a number in Hex that I assume was a memory address , other times just stuck with a blinking cursor in the top left hand corner of the screen .	St
1.1.5	It crashed whether it was the only memory module in the computer ( in the first and then the second slot ) , and whether it was in the first position and the other module was in the second position or vice versa .	St
1.1.6	My question is , did I get non-functioning RAM or would my system not support single-sided SDRAM ?	Ques
1.2.1	Install just the new stick .	St
1.2.2	If it crashes then the new stick is not compatible with your system .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks Bob !	St
1.3.2	When I install just the new stick it crashes , but I was wondering if the reason was that I got a non-functioning stick , or if for some reason my PC was n't able to handle single-sided memory .	St
1.4.1	If the new stick on its own does n't function , it 's incompatible with your system and not an issue of sides or other such things .	St
1.4.2	Cut your losses now ( time and other ) and try to obtain a new stick .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
