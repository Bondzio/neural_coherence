I'm getting ready to buy a new video card.
In the specs it states the resolutions and the refresh rates ( i.e.
800x600 70Hz - 1028x720 75Hz etc.
)for the card.
While looking at my monitors manual I also noticed that it included these same numbers (resolutions-refresh rates)and that the refresh rates for the same settings were different.
My question is - which of the two( video card or monitor)determines the refresh rate you see on the screen ?
or how does this work ?
