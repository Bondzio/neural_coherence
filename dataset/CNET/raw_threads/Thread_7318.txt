I plan on playing some games such as CoD4 and using Photoshop CS3. I would also like to have the option to have the tv tuner thing which the hp has and the dell charges extra for. Seem like a better buy with the HP but the dell may let me expand more down the road easily. Any experience or ideas are appreciated?

The 8600GT can struggle in games unless you're willing to turn down the resolution and the effects/detail level. To make the HP a good gamer, you'd need to upgrade to at least a 9600GT and replace its 350W power supply with a 450+W unit.

It is the better gaming PC, especially if you think a couple of years ahead. You'll be able to drop a price-dropped faster 1333Mhz FSB chip in there, and also slap in a second 8800GT (or a single power-hungry card) in there to keep your gaming current. As far as the gaming experience right now is concerned, the Q6600+8800GT combo will also slay a Q9300+8600GT.
