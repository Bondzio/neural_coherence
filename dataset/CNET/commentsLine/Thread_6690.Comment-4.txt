agree with eac430 - do that.
p.s.
instead of calling the companies, go watch some tv and have a good time.
you'll accomplish just as much.
the companies usually don't care, their main concern is bag on anyone else who might be involved if they can't fix the problem.
if the techie doesn't give you a straight answer within 5 minutes, he/she doesn't know.
