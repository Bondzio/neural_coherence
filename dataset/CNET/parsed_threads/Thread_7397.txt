<s> I just bought this camera, easy to install but image quality is horrible. </s>
<s> Anyone has some tricks in this regard? </s>
<s> May be the best trick is to return it. </s>
<s> Some compare such to digital cameras which surveillance cameras rarely compete with. </s>

<s> Standard Television is equivilent to 320x240 resolution. </s>
<s> This typically looks pretty poor on a full screen monitor. </s>
<s> 30 Frames Per Second is considered real time video. </s>
<s> Most of the video capture cards clame 640x480 resolution and 30 FPS but they separate these as 2 different line items. </s>
<s> You usually get 640x480 at 15 FPS or 320x240 at 30 FPS. </s>
<s> You can save bandwidth by reducing to 25fps. </s>
<s> You should compare these numbers with your camera specs. </s>
<s> If it uses a standard lens you may be able to swap that out and improve the picture quality. </s>
<s> SKrall </s>
<s> More than likely the resoulution of this camera is either 320x240 or 640x480. </s>
<s> The 640 may not look that bad but if it is a 320 it would look terrible on a computer screen. </s>
<s> I think D-Link makes a similar camera that has better specs than the linksys, might be worth checking out. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
