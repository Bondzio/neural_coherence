<s> Thought it would be useful to people in this forum about my experiences installing a second hard drive on my PC - a WD caviar green. </s>
<s> Have spent two weeks tearing my hair out as the drive wouldn't format at first, then it was slow access and then total failure. </s>
<s> Was about to send it back but I swapped the SATA cable (which I had bought at the same time as the drive) and everything is great. </s>
<s> Apparently, according to various other forums, SATA cable problems are the source of many hard drive problems: http://users.silenceisdefeat.com/~rwightman/PVRprojects/Blog/Entries/2010/8/3_Recent_PVR_woes.html </s>
<s> Coincidence but someone else I know recently had similar problems and it was the cable. </s>
<s> Are there dodgy cables in circulation or something? </s>
