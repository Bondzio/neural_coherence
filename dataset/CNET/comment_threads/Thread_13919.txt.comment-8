I am also considering an external hard drive.Best Buy put a new hard drive in my sister's computer and the computer never worked right again.I might decide to try the external hard drive just to be sure I don't do anything that will mess the computer up permanently.
Are external hard drives good to use?
I don't want to waste my money.
Thank your for your advice.
