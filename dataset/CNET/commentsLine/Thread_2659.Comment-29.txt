i've had a whole slew of seagate drives fail me, either doa or within two weeks of use.
granted, they were the bottom of the barrel 20gb and 40gb models, but still, if you want to be the best company, you need to have quality across the whole lineup, as evidenced by toyota.
the cheap stuff should last just as long as the flagship hardware.
currently i use wd caviar hard drives, and i have no problems with them.
i had a maxtor, and in a short lifespan, it blew itself out.
i also have a 160 gb maxtor that is running in a usb, and it's not performing too healthily.
i had a samsung, and while noisy as a vaccum cleaner!!!
it lasted a very long time.
hitachi and fujitsu drives are both good brands as well.
same goes with toshiba.
on a laptop, hard drives don't last as long, especially if the lappy runs hot.
all of the above ran for about a year in my evil presario 2100, which eats hard drives on a yearly basis.
