i have already been advised about the canon pixma, so i will definitely check it out.
i live a little bit north of you in southern spain!&quot; - even so i should be able to get a reply about it when i check, completely as an aside, i spent some time in australia back in the 50's for a while and again in the 60's.
down the east coast, visiting the g.b reef, townsville, cairns.
and a survival course lasting 6 weeks from rockhampton down to gympie and on to brisbane.
