<s> I have an MSI 865PE Neo2-FIS2R motherboard, and I'm attempting to rebuild it with a new SATA drive. </s>
<s> XP won't find the HD, so I'm assuming XP doesn't have them built in. </s>
<s> I've searched for SATA drivers fro this board, but I'm not having much luck. </s>
<s> I'd like to slip stream the drivers and move on. </s>
<s> I'll get the slip strea figured out - I just need assistance locating the driver. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Import the drivers by copying onto a disc from another computer that has the same connectors and loading. </s>
