You can supply pix if you like, but you need to thread carefully.
You can unscrew the remaining 4-screws and see if that keeps it held as well.
I was hoping that wouldn't be required.
But, if that does it, then OK.
If not, then I suspect some catch(s) somewhere which at this point is a guess on my part, because a good viewing is required, in other words to be &quot;in hand&quot;.
If that should be the problem some other catch is at fault here, once its all apart it becomes obvious.
What I don't want is some glue or tamper evident device at work here, if so, then I'm unaware of that, so you're on your own after that.
good luck -----Willy
