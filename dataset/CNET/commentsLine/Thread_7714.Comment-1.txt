hey i have had my compaq presario 5000 series since about 1998.. i know.. its old but hey.. itas works fine unless im doing alot of stuff at once on the comp.. it has a amd duron processor at 900mhz.. it came with a ati 3d rage2+dvd video card it has 20mb memory on it and it recently konked out.... i think..well anyway.. i was screwin aroundwith it one day and i installed xp on it.
i decided to take out the ati card and try to install windows xp then(the computer came with windows me)anyway.
the install decided to work except now the comp runs fine except when i play videos.. extremely slow.. the computer has 8mb for the video card built in.
so i think its the memory.
wat could happen to the comp if i tried to plug in my old video card again?..
would it crash windows or something?
