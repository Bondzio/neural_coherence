As an additional bit of information, this notebook as a Sony Memory stick reader assigned to drive &quot;f&quot; I have a Dell issue 64 MB memory key/stick. The key works fine; I've transferred data using it from other PCs, including my desktop at home. However, when I plug it into any of the USB ports on the VIAO, I can't find it recognized by Windows Explorer or My Computer. It makes the &quot;Noise&quot; that says new hardware has been installed, but I don't see it anywhere. I tried to &quot;map a drive&quot;, but I don't know what or where to map a drive to. My op system is XP Home, SP1.

Well, your answer may not have hit the bullseye, but it sure pointed me in the right direction! The detail I forgot to mention was that I had assigned the G drive designation as a shared network drive. I guess the Sony VAIO had by default assigned the &quot;G&quot; drive for the USB ports. When I remapped the network drive to another letter, I was able to &quot;see&quot; the USB key when I plugged it in. I didn't need to use tweakUI to fix the problem. Thanks again.
