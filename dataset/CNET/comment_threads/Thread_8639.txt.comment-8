YAY By using getdataback, I recovered most of my files onto my laptop even though they gave lots of bad sector errors.
I had alerady recovered my Windows partition so I booted into it and continued, my hope lost for the complete recovery of my Data partition.
I tried testdisk once again.
And ta-da it got recovered!
I think testdisk is the best application out there for data recovery because it is powerful, small and fast.
Thank You for your Help!
BTW I dont think I would be able to get that kind of hDD for under 99bucks over here.
I dont live in the USA where the demand and competition is high.
