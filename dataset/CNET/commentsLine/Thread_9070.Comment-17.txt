you need to download and use their powermax diagnostic.
powermax generates an 8 digit code if it is defective.
this info and a link to the powermax is located here: my internal hard drive may be defective, how can i test it?
this link will explain the use of the error code: powermax diagnostic codes - what does the error code mean and what do i do?
you appear to have changed your jumper so you might want to look at this graphic to ensure that you now have it proper for the 3 gbits per sec (normal) configuration.
in short, no pins jumpered together:  could also be a problem with native command queuing.
is ncq enabled or disabled in your bios (or did the drivers you used support or not support it?)
for the sata host controller?
poor write speeds can also result from conflict between bios version and sata driver versions.
since this is such a recent purchase, i personally would waste no time taking it back and letting them (whoever built it) handle the problem.
