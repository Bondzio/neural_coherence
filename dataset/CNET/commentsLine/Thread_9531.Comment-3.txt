ok well i think i've settled with ibuypower because they are very cheap and they look very good lol.
their credibality seems pretty good to.
i did hoever find one disgruntled post from someone who got screwed by them but that doesnt really bother me =/ it doesnt seem like they do it to everyone.
right now for me im having a fight on whether to go sli or to stay with a single card.
if i go single im probably going for the nvidia gx2 one.
its basically sli in one pci slot so i donno does anyone have an opinion on whether to go sli or not?
