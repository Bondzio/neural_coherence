I would like to convert these to wireless to allow flexible positioning of the presenters laptop. Connections I have available are USB B, S-video and VGA. I was thinking of a USB B wireless adapter or USB B to USB A and a USB A wireless adapter not sure if any of these would work. Any advise is appreciated. Thanks
