too bad i don't have another motherboard.
a new mb from hp is like $799, or one from ebay for maybe $300, plus the time and hassle to change it (not my favorite chore).
i don't think the owner is willing to spend that much at this point, but if a new mb was the only way, then we'd be able to make a decision on it.
but i can't buy one just to try it.
i asked the question hoping somebody had a similar experience, or as &quot;is there any possible solution that i'm not aware of&quot;- short of a new mb.
i have a feeling i may be owning this laptop if it comes cheaply enough.
