<s> I have in my mind that the better way to backup photos would be to put them on an external hard drive. </s>
<s> (I am forever hunting for the correct CD or DVD) They would be easy to get to from other computers to edit or to store from a laptop on a trip.I think I would only use it to store photos so I hope it would last many years or am I expecting too much? </s>
<s> Just as dependable as internals. </s>
<s> And just as internals, you still need to back them up since a virus or failure will cause the files to vanish. </s>
<s> In one line... &quot;Hard disks are temporary storage.&quot; Bob </s>

<s> And this is just one of the pleas for help you read about this. </s>

<s> Thanks Robert If I decide to try it, I will definately keep DVD backups </s>
<s> I put an 80 gig WD HD in a cheap plastic enclosure case, and it's been running fine for months- I've even forgotten to turn it off, and luckily didn't toast it. </s>
<s> But, as Bob said, it's TEMPORARY STORAGE. </s>
<s> It's convenient to carry about, works really fast on my usb 2 connection, and my network sees it. </s>
<s> All fine and good. </s>
<s> BUT- I've still archived everything important to cd/dvd disks. </s>
<s> Disaster strikes just when you least expect it....which reminds me, I haven't backed up some important stuff in awhile....thanks for reminder, Bob! </s>
