<s> I have two video cards, a NVIDIA GeForce 7300 LE (which is installed in my computer) and an old Geforce 4 (which is not in my computer) My computer runs slow sometimes when running games and a friend told me that there was a way to run both video cards on one computer and this will make games and such run smoother. </s>
<s> However i am not really sure how to install both, or even if installing both cards actualy makes the computer run faster. </s>
<s> i was wondering if anybody could help me out a bit </s>
<s> Please don't do it. </s>

<s> People who put two toally differant Video Cards together (not SLI) do it not for real perfomance but to have more then one monitor. </s>
<s> If you want good perfmance you have to have a SLI bridge. </s>
<s> Idk if any of the cards that you metinoed are SLI ready but if they are you might be able to bridge them then you get a small perfomance upgrade. </s>
<s> But not really worth it most likely. </s>
