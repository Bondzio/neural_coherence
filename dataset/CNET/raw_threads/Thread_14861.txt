On the computer going wireless everytime i seem to play Counterstrike (for those who know what i'm talking about) i would walk walk walk, then just randomly lag and get this HUGE lag spike for about 3 seconds, then its fine. Occurs occasionally no idea why... then after maybe about 1 hr - 2 hrs... the wireless connection goes down. So then i just right click my wireless connection icon and press repair.. ALL SET... an hour later connection goes back down... its starting to annoy me.. plz help
