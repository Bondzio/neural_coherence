<s> HI guys, Need to know if I should get a dual *simultaneous* band router. </s>
<s> This wireless adaptor is N class with an ISM Maximum Frequency of 2.4Ghz, and a UNII Maximum Frequency of 5 Ghz. </s>
<s> Does this mean it will work in the more stable and faster 5 Ghz band, or is it strictly 2.4Ghz? </s>
<s> I have to buy a new router so for $100 more, I'll get one that does both bands, *simultaneously*, but if this adaptor can't run on 5Ghz, I'll save some money and just get a dual band. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help! </s>
<s> 802.11a (U-NII) bands: 5.15 to 5.25 would mean you want 802.11a gear and not the 802.11n 5.8GHz gear I've seen. </s>
<s> So the dual band router is unlikely to help. </s>
<s> Interesting. </s>
<s> I'm running it (streaming HD movies from office PC about 70 feet away) on an older G router. </s>
<s> I'd like to get an N router for the laptop and netbooks around the house and hopefully the TV can run on it too. </s>
<s> The only thing that would need the G is the PS3. </s>
<s> About post 18 in this forum's sticky reveals how to use more than one wifi router to get more over the air wifi bandwidth. </s>
