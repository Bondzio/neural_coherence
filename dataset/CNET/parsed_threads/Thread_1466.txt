<s> I bought a 160 GB external hard drive that is currently formatted as a fat32 hard drive. </s>
<s> However, that only supports file transfers of 4 gb at once, and thus I wanted to see if it was possible to reformat the hard drive to another file system that would support larger file transfers. </s>
<s> You should see some improvement. </s>
<s> You can even convert from fat32 to ntfs without formatting or file lose. </s>
<s> But you can only go from fat32 to ntfs nondestructively not the other way around. </s>
