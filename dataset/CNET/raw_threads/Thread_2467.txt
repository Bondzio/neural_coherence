Sorry for if this sounds ludicrous but I wanted to troubleshoot as best as possible w/ as little headache as possible. I just finished building a new PC from scratch. When I went to plug in my monitor (HP w2207h) I see that the mobo accepts DVI (and HDMI) and the monitor has VGA (and HDMI). Since there is no VGA to DVI adapter, I am thinking I may need a new monitor (which is fine, if this is the case). I tried to use the HDMI but the monitor says that is does not detect the HDMI input and goes to sleep. Does something else need to be installed, perhaps? I need a screen so I can access the BIOS and later install my OS but, as of now, I can not get my current monitor to work with the new build. Thoughts? Like I said, this sounds ridiculous and I feel stupid typing it but I'll take the heat. If I have to purchase a new monitor, is there anything in particular that I should look for so that the monitor &quot;works&quot; without installing software, etc. since this is a new build? Thanks for any feedback that can be offered. Trying to troubleshoot w/, as I said earlier, as few headaches as possible.

Make sure by reviewing the manual for your monitor but a quick check of the OSD should be enough. The same applies to your PC, it may need to know where to output the video stream to that device. I checked manual on page 3-8, the HDMI supposely works as an output from an HDMI device like a player, so it may not work as direct HDMI-to-HDMI but still the setting might be the fix regardless. the manual does offer an adapter should work. http://www.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c00834092.pdf tada -----Willy
