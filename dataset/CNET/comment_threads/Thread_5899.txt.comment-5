I went to google and put in Dimension 4600.
The FIRST HIT was the documentation.
I clicked on that and saw I/O ports then clicked on that to land at http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim4600/en/4600i/sm/specs.htm#1105813 Hmm, RIGHT THERE IT TELLS YOU &quot;Serial ATA two 7-pin connectors&quot; Sorry if this upsets you in any way but you have the connections for new and old drives.
There is no issue there.
