<s> My PC currently has 1 GB memory (2-512GB chips) with 2 slots for expansion. </s>
<s> I've always read where an upgrade should use the same size chips, but is it written in stone where I have to use 2 more 512s as opposed to dropping in 1 or 2 1GB chips to use with the 512s in there now? </s>
<s> Or do I take the current 512s out & drop in 2, 3 or 4 1GB chips? </s>
<s> I have seen many computers with different RAM sizes. </s>
<s> The things that are important are, to note where the &quot;duel channel&quot; slots are. </s>
<s> It is recommended that you use the same speed and size when filling these slots. </s>
<s> On the other hand, you do not have to match the RAM in the opposing channel. </s>
<s> So Channel 1 could be 2x512 and channel 2 1gx2. </s>
<s> But, why take the chance of spotty operation. </s>
<s> At current RAM prices, you might as well match all the chips. </s>
<s> As with any RAM upgrade, make sure you check the manufacters compatible RAM list. </s>
<s> DDR2 is more strict when it comes to speed. </s>
<s> For guaranteed reliability, (which is my motto) spend the extra $20. </s>

<s> The DDR2 mode if used will better handle ram demands, however usually its demands proper ram slot placement. </s>
<s> Also, the OS being used will limit the ram amount and/or ideal ram installable(search the forums here for topic). </s>

<s> different sizes on different channels only work if your chipset supports it. </s>
<s> for amd systems you will have to check if the cpu will support it. </s>
