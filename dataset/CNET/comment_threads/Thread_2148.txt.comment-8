Found it won't copy write protected DVD's.
It might work with DVDShrink but I don't know if it was the DVD or DVDShrink that had my computer going around - had to shut down and go into safe mode to resolve problem though that update I mistyped and version is 6.6.1.4, if yours is ver.6.6.0.14, it is the first one but the latter is Jan. 31, 2006 Darrell L.
