I just got a program called speedfan v4.34, The readings i got are as follow: Fan 1: 4821 RPM Fan 2: 0 RPM Fan 3: 0 RPM Temp 1: 25C Temp 2: -55C Temp 3: 52C HD0 : 35C So um.. is that normal for a PC or is this software just useless.
If yes then is there any foolproof way to moniter PC temperature.
please explain in details.
Sorry if posted in wrong section.
