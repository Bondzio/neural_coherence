<s> Hello everyone I have been running a Dell Dimension 8300 for about 2.5 years now with almost no hassle whatsover but a strange problem has developed with the monitor (17&quot; flat screen). </s>
<s> I frequently leave the PC on but turn the monitor off when I am away from my desk. </s>
<s> Yesterday, when i turned the monitor on with the PC running in this way, it came on for about 1 second, then the display went to blackout. </s>
<s> The monitor was still on (the on light was still lit up - on green) but the display was totally blacked out. </s>
<s> I've tried the full range of rebooting, restarting, checking all connections etc but cannot identify an obvious cause. </s>
<s> Obviously, on the software side, it is pretty much impossible to start looking at power saving settings etc with a monitor that does not work! </s>
<s> Before I go and find a test monitor somewhere, would appreciate advice as follows: * is there something else I should try * is this a well recognized symptom for which there is a well recognised cause (eg the monitor is burned out? </s>
<s> other?) </s>
<s> Any help/suggestions really appreciated </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Thanks!! </s>
<s> yes, I will if there is no other obvious, immediate action I should take - the problem is that I don't have immediate access to another PC but yes I will arrange that as a next step if needs be. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> That's how the test is done when there is no display. </s>
<s> You didn't mention what type of monitor you had. </s>
<s> But, if this is a CRT, then reseat the cables and finally, give it &quot;smack&quot; on either right or left sides. </s>
<s> If it flickers to a display then disappears again, replace the monitor. </s>
<s> If LCD, place a flashlight against screen and if you see a faint display, backlight or power module is kaput. </s>
<s> Repair is up to you. </s>
<s> There maybe other causes, but repair tends to be costly and replacement is best. </s>
<s> As Robert mentioned, swap out to another system to test it that way. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks both - I got another monitor off a friend and swapped it out and the problem is definitely with my (LCD) monitor. </s>
<s> Looks like I need to get a replacement. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help along the way! </s>
