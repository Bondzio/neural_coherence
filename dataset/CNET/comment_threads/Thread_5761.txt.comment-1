Hi, I am buying an external hard drive and I heard that there are problem with portable hard drives not getting enough power from the USB port.
And I am not sure if my computer will supply enough computer when I checked in the device manager in Windows it said my USB port supplies 500MA and I am not sure if it's enough to supply it without out having to buy a dock just to get 2 usb ports.
Thanks Dell Dimension E520
