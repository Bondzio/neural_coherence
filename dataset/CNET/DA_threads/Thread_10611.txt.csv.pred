1.1.2	I bought a Asus N6600 , and it ran fine for about a day , and then basically anything 3d heavy looked like this : http : //img59.imageshack.us/img59/5726/wow1si6.jpg i thought it was the card , so i sent it back , and recieved a new one ( same model ) a week later .	St
1.1.3	NO CHANGE .	St
1.1.4	i can only assume its my computer , since i tested it on my friend 's computer and it was fine .	St
1.1.5	What could be the problem ?	Ques
1.1.6	a friend suggested it was overheating , but whenever i check , the GPU is always under 40C , usually the same for the CPU .	St
1.1.7	This is really starting to bother me .	St
1.1.8	What is causing this ?	Ques
1.1.9	I have a P4 2.20GHz , with a gig of ram .	St
1.1.10	my motherboard is a Gigabyte GA-8S650GXM ( i can post full spec report if needed ) Also , Yes , I have every driver posssible and everything updateable updated .	St
1.1.11	Please help !	St
1.2.1	running any tweak tools for your graphics card eg , ATI tray tool .	St
1.2.2	What card is it ? ?	Ques
1.2.3	?	Ques
1.3.1	like i said in the post , its an Asus n6600 ( nivida 6600 ) i 'm not using anything to tweak my card , the only thing i 've got is the drivers off nvidia 's site .	St
1.4.1	Note : If you 're asking for technical help , please be sure to include all your system info , including operating system , model number , and any other specifics related to the problem .	St
1.4.2	Power supply ?	Ques
1.4.3	How many watts ?	Ques
1.5.1	I 've got a 350w power supply , some no name brand .	St
1.6.1	On the day after you installed it and it failed .	St
1.6.2	New drivers , other software , hardware , anything ?	Ques
1.6.3	If yes revert back to that day and add them in one at a time .	Res
1.6.4	If no , look for a hardware problem .	St
1.6.5	Did your previous graphics card have a fan and draw power or is this a new load on that power supply ?	Ques
1.6.6	What size P/S is your friend using ?	Ques
1.7.1	before i got this card i had a radeon 9200 se , which had something wrong with it ( with it , comp would constantly freeze , even on other computers ) .	St
1.7.2	it didnt have a fan , this one does though .	St
1.7.3	when i got the card i thought it might be the power supply , so i changed the 250 watt with a 350 watt , but it was pretty cheap , and i 've heard it can cause problems .	St
1.7.4	Also , yesterday i thought it might be the ram , so i ran a momory test program , and i got some interesting results .	St
1.7.5	when i tested each stick of ram individually , i got no errors , but together , i did get some .	St
1.7.6	i tried running HL2 with just one stick , and after 15 muinites or so , it went haywire , much like when using both sticks .	St
1.7.7	so i dont think its the RAM .	St
1.7.8	with Ram and video card ruled out , i gues the power supply could be it .	St
1.7.9	could it be the motherboard ? ?	Ques
1.7.10	can a software problem cause these types of severe graphical glitches ( see screenshot in first post .	St
1.8.1	that the artifacting is caused by your PSU .	St
1.8.2	You may want to upgrade that .	St
1.8.3	You can check this by looking at your current voltages in your bios , or by downloading a program that will show you your current voltages .	St
1.8.4	Check your 12v .	St
1.8.5	If it 's running around 11.5 or lower then that is most likely the problem .	St
1.9.1	I went into the boot menu thing , and watched the voltages for about a min , and this is what it looked like 3.3v was 3.29 or 3.31 5v was 5.16 12v was 12.09 or 12.16 or 12.22	St
