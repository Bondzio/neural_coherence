i agree with mr proffit.
windows has done one of its spike things that happens in the night.
i think its time to try a reload of xp and select the function that saves settings and see if thats good enuf.
have you ordered your external drive yet ?
?
we need to work towards doing a backup of your data and reloading xp fresh.
how big is your hard drive and how much free space do you have ?
?
we will have to start with a runing of defrag - which will take a lot of time.
then create a new partition to copy to, everything u want to save, then delete windows and do a fresh install.
all in all - this will probably be the fastest and easiest way to clear this up.
or wait till you get the ext hd.
