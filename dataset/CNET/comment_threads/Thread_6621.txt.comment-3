When I put the dvd in auto run starts and a window opens and wants to know what program I want to use.
I chose Windows Media Player.
Another window opens and says '' Windows Media Player cannot play the dvd because a compatible dvd decoder is not installed on your computer''.
There are two buttons under that one is ''close'' and the other is ''web help''.
Web help takes me to a site to buy a plug in.
Is that what I need or is there something else?
