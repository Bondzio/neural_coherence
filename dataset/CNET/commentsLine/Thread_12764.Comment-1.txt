hi -- i'm having some real problems with my soundblaster pci128 - i had problems installing it initially, and it was all down to the pci legacy device that it was trying to install.
eventually, it just didn't install the device, and, since i don't use it, it wasn't missed.
i rejigged the guts of my pc yesterday, and moved the soundcard to a different pci slot.
it redetected on windows load, and it locks up -mouse, keyboard - everything - as soon as it detects the 'soundblaster pci128 legact device' - i've removed all references in device manager and rebooted - same problem.
any ideas?
