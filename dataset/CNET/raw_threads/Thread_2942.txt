10015	0	290814	2747393	NR	CN5	4/8/08 5:08 PM	1.20767448E12	Canon MX700	Is it possible to refill the ink cartridges on a Canon MX700. I could do it on my MP730 but this one does not seem to work. If not, I will have to find a printer that will. The cartridges are just too expensive. Thanks for your assistance. TAM

The chip needs to be reset. While you can buy the chip resetter, it runs between $200-$600. Doesn't make it worth it for a home user. There are reset printer cartridges out there for your printer. You just need to look in the right places.

Your printer program will give you a number of low ink warnings and it will eventually ask you to replace the cartridge or if you choose, you may override the safeguards and keep printing. I haven't done it for a while, but you end up depressing one of the buttons on the machine to enable the override. The final prompt will instruct you. Just be careful that you periodically inspect the cartridge levels so you don't run out and damage the nozzles/print head.
