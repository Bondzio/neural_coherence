1.1.1	OK, I recently brought a custom built PC (tower) on EBay with Vista installed and a new monitor separately.	St
1.1.2	Now Ive run into a problem.	St
1.1.3	When i first hooked it up, i plugged the cable from the Monitor, into the back of the PC too the Mother board.	St
1.1.4	When i turned the PC there was no image on the Monitor.	St
1.1.5	This i later found out, was due to the HIS X1650Pro iSilence Graphics card overriding the GC in the Mother board.	St
1.1.6	Now from what Ive been told, the HIS X1650Pro iSilence is made for Vista which is why the sockets in the back of it are different.	St
1.1.7	Thus i cannot connect the Monitor too the card itself, and have to go through the mother board instead.	St
1.1.8	Thus preventing me from using the card at all, because I have to take out the GC for me too get an image on my Monitor.	St
1.1.9	As well as that.	St
1.1.10	With the GC now not inserted, the disc drive will not open, so i cannot even get my Net up on my new PC because i need to do an installation.	St
1.1.11	So what i was wanting to know was.	St
1.1.12	Is the any adaptors out there that will let me plug the normal cord that comes off the monitor into the HIS X1650Pro iSilence Graphics Card?	St
1.1.13	This has been a real head-ache, and am hoping theres a solution to my problem.	St
1.1.14	Thanks!	St

1.2.1	you have in the Hardware forum, and you already have two replys there.	St
1.2.2	Multiple posting is not a good idea and is highly discouraged.	St
1.2.3	You have two threads open, and that could get confusing.	St
1.2.4	Those responding in one thread would not know what had been said in the other.	St
1.2.5	This is counter-productive and can lead to duplication or oposing solutions.	St
1.2.6	Also, the responders often feed off of each others ideas, and therefore come up with a better solution than any one would have alone.	St
1.2.7	If anyone is contemplating a reply here, I suggest going th Coldplayer's post in the Hardware forum where a thread has been established.	St
