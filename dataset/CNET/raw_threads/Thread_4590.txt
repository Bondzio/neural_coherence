Usually when you shut down a pc it turns off, and the screen goes blank. But whenever I shut down my pc, it gets to the point where it says &quot;Shutting down....&quot; then it freezes and nothing happens. I do have alot of programs running like a firewall, a spyware program (SpySweeper 4.0) and pop up blockers. I thought those programs would be the problem, so I shut down each program before shutting dowm my computer, and it still froze. Also I got an lcd monitor a couple of weeks ago. Could that be the problem??? I don't know if the problem occured before I got the lcd, all I know is that it happens. Any suggestions??? Please help.
