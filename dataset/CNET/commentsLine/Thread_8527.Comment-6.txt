have been to intel.com and searched for hours and installed or attempted to install anything that might have been an update.
in all it updated one thing and i think that was the pci bridge but no updates for usb universal host controllers.
in my research i stumbled across this info.
chipset intel 82875p (north bridge) intel ich5r (south bridge).
i have some experience and some training but north bridge / south bridge.
huh??
also i have tried multiple usb devices on the computer including the front and back, jump drives, external hard drives, etc.
and once the first problem occurs nothing newly plugged into a usb port will load properly.
now if i unplug everything but mouse and keyboard and uninstall every usb universal host controller and then reboot and let the auto detect reinstall and then one by one reconnect usb devices they sometimes will load properly and i have thought great i have solved the problem and then 30 minutes later or whatever i try a jump drive or an external hard drive that previously loaded with no problem and it detects then freezes or i sometimes would end up with device not recognized.
also i have d/l every update from dell including bios update.
sound like a defective motherboard to you.
any chance its the cpu.
if i spend $200 on a refurb motherboard and the cpu is defective i am going to be a very unhappy camper.
