<s> I went out and tried to do todays &quot;weekend project&quot; except i had a problem, when I pulled out the older cooling unit, the processor came out as well, apparently it is stuck to it. </s>
<s> considering the cost of getting a new processor i'm not about to force it off. </s>
<s> What should I do? </s>
<s> btw: the socket is a P4 478. </s>
<s> I heard of a thingy that helped you remove the paste or something. </s>
<s> Or maybe use alcohol!?!?!? </s>
<s> Otherwise, if you want to quiet down your PC, I'd get a Sound Absorbing Mat, search on www.newegg.com </s>
<s> You might try applying a solvent such as mineral spirits (Goo Gone is mineral spirits) with a cotton swab around the outside where the heatsink and processor are joined and just be patient. </s>
<s> The idea is to allow it to work slowly into the heat conductive paste or pad that was probably used (I hope it wasn't glued). </s>
<s> This could take time and several applications. </s>
<s> If that does not work, more force might be necessary. </s>
<s> One think you don't want to do is use a sharp metal object between the HS and processor as a first resort. </s>
<s> I'd stick to a twisting motion and some creativity. </s>
<s> At worst and knowing the HS was expendable, I'd go so far as to secure it in a vise and fashion a tool that would span the width of the processor which could be twisted to get some extra torque. </s>
<s> Any such tool should have a non-metalic portion to contact opposite sides of processor such as a spanner wrench would do. </s>
<s> As a matter of fact, a large enough spanner and a couple popsicle sticks might just do it but the tool needs to exert some light pressure that pinches the processor so as not to want to break off the corners. </s>
<s> Again, the twisting force would be the least likely to damage things, I would think. </s>
