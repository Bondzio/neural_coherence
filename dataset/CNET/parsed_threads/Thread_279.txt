<s> I have a few network cables that transmit at a VERY slow rate. </s>
<s> If I replace the cables with other ones the network goes fast. </s>
<s> Could it be... </s>
<s> The slow cables are not in the 568-B nor in the 568-A order. </s>
<s> They are crimped the same on both ends though. </s>
<s> Example. </s>
<s> Orange White/Orange Green White/Green Brown White/Brown Blue White/Blue The reason I came to this conclusion is the &quot;pairs&quot; are twisted, and if If the network has to transmit along the wrong pair could the be interferance of something? </s>
<s> Can anyone explain. </s>
<s> That's not proper. </s>
<s> Here's a link about what's wrong. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_over_twisted_pair Hint, pins 3,4,5,6 are wrong. </s>

<s> It doesn't matter if the cables conform to any wiring standard as long as they are the same on both ends. </s>
<s> This would still be a straight through cable. </s>
<s> Examine the printing on the cable to determine the rated bandwidth/speed. </s>
<s> Cat.3, Cat.5, Cat.5e, Cat.6? </s>
<s> The signal would not be on pairs so you get the effect above. </s>
<s> Please do a little more research. </s>

<s> You're right Bob. </s>
<s> I leapt before I looked. </s>
<s> His wiring scheme on 1,2,3,6 would be org, wht/org, grn, wht/blue. </s>
<s> Consider me busted too! </s>
<s> But thanks for the heads up. </s>
<s> Such cable errors is one reason our tech was able to buy his new hybrid. </s>
<s> The first reason is spyware. </s>
<s> Thank you all spyware authors? </s>
