<s> Comcast recently replaced our old router. </s>
<s> When they did our wireless has been much stronger however the Ethernet cable I use for the upstairs computer no longer works. </s>
<s> Its not the cable itself but the way the Router is configured I am assuming. </s>
<s> When I plug in the Ethernet cable into the router you can notice right away there are no lights showing that the Cable is being detected. </s>
<s> Any Ideas how I can get this working? </s>
<s> The lights are hardware controlled, not software. </s>
<s> They should light up on the router and the PC as soon as the PC has power, and that's long before Windows is up and running. </s>
<s> So either the router is defective, or the cable, or the Ethernet connection on the PC, or the cable is loose. </s>
<s> I'd check the connection on both ends first. </s>
<s> Then try a laptop in stead of the desktop. </s>
<s> Then try that same laptop downstairs with another cable. </s>
<s> Be sure it's a patch cable, not a crossed cable. </s>
<s> Then take the desktop downstairs with that same short cable. </s>
<s> Taken together this should give a clear indication of the error. </s>
<s> If a tech did this, as you write, he did a bad job. </s>
<s> And - if I may say so - so did you by accepting it (and probably signing for it) before checking that everything still worked as it used to. </s>
