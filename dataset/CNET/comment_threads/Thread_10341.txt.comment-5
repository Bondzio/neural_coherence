dear sir: I did exactly what you told me to do and in the presence of a technician.
I'm still at step one, that is in Windows ME I get msxml.dll not regestered whereas in X.P.
the scanner works ok. Any suggestions?
I even tried to install an update for msxml and the dialogue box said That it's already installed and it wouldn't let me install.
