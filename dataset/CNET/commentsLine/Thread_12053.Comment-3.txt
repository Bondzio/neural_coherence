cyperpower is nothing more than a 3rd party building systems with typical off shelf components and putting them in a glitzy case.
you can do all that just as well.
what many consumers complain about is generally they ordering a top-end pc and putting through its paces on gamers demands.
these users are generally the most demanding punishing out there.
make no bones about it, they want the best for the least yet don't really put the effort to really get things going smoothly.
you can't oc and expect things to always be good.
you can't push the pc to the extremes and expect good results.
you can't allow the pc to cook in heat bath for long.
you really can't play for hrs.
on high output and then expect to run every day like that.
you can only if the $ is spend, wisely installed components and everyday tlc.
usage of only the best components and pay attention to the small details.
cooling and more cooling and make it work.
follow the hints/tips/clues of any hic-up via some gamers forum, drivers forum, s/w forum and/or basic google hits.
of course, if cyperpower ships a piece of crap, well that speaks for itself.
check your wishlist against all those gaemr pc systems and see what makes them tick.
-or- look into high-end pcs and just what they offer and see if you can build one.
i generally advise now, is to get a big case, big and namebrand psu and any cooling options.
then build on that because those 3-items i mentioned are not overlooked or taken for granted and/or shortsighted with regard to the classy items a pc will need.
that's all..... tada -----willy
