997	0	61514	729731	NR	irishman	1/31/05 4:40 PM	1.1071896E12	Network set up	I am having some trouble setting up a network for my neightbor. Both computers are running XP.one home one pro. I ahve gone through the network setup wizard on both of them. I dont know which configuration to choose so i just picked one. I think it was the defalut that comes up. I entered in all of the info and it said it was done and that I ahd to restart. so i did. i also did this on the other which connects via 802.11b. I went to My Network Places and tried to view the workgroup computers. Each time i received a dialog box that said I couldn't access the network. It said that a server hadn't been secified. The internet works fine on both of them by the way. I have done other posts in the past and i have not provided enough info. if you need anymore. please let me know.

997	2	61514	729760	729740	irishman	1/31/05 5:00 PM	1.1071908E12	work group and domain	the workgroup names are both the same. I pretty sure that I didn't set up a domain in the first place. just a refresher put what is the domain again.
997	3	61514	729881	729760	Michael Geist	1/31/05 6:06 PM	1.10719476E12	Check in System properties....	on the Computer name tab your workgroup name or the Domain you belong to will be shown. If a Domain name is listed you can change by clicking the Change button and switch to a workgroup.
997	4	61514	729934	729881	irishman	1/31/05 6:37 PM	1.10719662E12	workgroup right?	well in order to do that you would have to be able to view the workgroup computers right.(i think) well thats when i get the error message. it comes up when i click &quot;view workgroup computers.&quot; I came home and i did what you have just explained wheere your click on the name and click on properties so i think i know what your saying. i am going over to their house tomorrow to look at it again
