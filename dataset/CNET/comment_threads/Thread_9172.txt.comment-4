Are a big manufacturer of electronic components for computers and other devices.
Theyalso make scanners, motherboards, CDRoms, DVD burners, just to name a few.
However, I cannot find any reference to a SCSI board.
Adaptec were always the SCSI board of choice for the Mac and probably still is.
They have a 2906 model, part number 1772900, which may be suitable.
It mentions OS X (10.1) but it would be worth the price of a free phone call to find out.
the card is $65 www.adaptec.com P
