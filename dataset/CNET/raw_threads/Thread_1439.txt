Story: Resently I tried to upgrade my CD-burning software. I had Nero 5. I unistalled it and installed Nero 6 Express, and then updated it on Nero's site to latest Nero 6.06. Then I succesfully burned a test CD. Problem: After I restarted computer. My CD-ROM doesnt' want to read any CDs. Details: I put cd in, it spins for 5 seconds with green light on, then ejects CD. I noticed also that in 'My Computer' DVD-CDRW combo icon changed form 'DVD-ROM' to 'CD-ROM'. I ran Nero diskInfo tool, and it shows in ASPI - Windows ASPI corrupted, while NERO ASPI - OK. Reisntalled Adaptec's ASPI for WinXP32 - didn't help. What Do you think is the problem and How to resolve it?
