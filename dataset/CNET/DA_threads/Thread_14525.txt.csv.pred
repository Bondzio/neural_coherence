1.1.1	Ok , this is a big complicated .	St
1.1.2	My system ( a 1.6 P4 ) has two hard drives , both in NTFS format : the master ( C ) is a 40 gig western digital with Windows 2k Pro on it , and the slave ( D ) is a 160 gig Maxtor .	St
1.1.3	Earlier in the week the D : drive ceased to be accessible in Windows ; it no longer appears in My Computer and can not be reached through any shortcuts .	St
1.1.4	However , it is still shows up as the Primary slave during startup ( good thing , as the C : is obviously configured as a master drive and not a single ) , as well as in the BIOS and in Windows Device Manager .	St
1.1.5	My power supply died the next day , so Im assuming that was the culprit , and killed the directory or the partition table or whatever .	St
1.1.6	I replaced the power supply and tried a few programs , trying to get at the files on D : long enough to at least burn some things .	St
1.1.7	HDD Regenerator supposedly managed to fix a few dozen corrupted sectors , and a program called TestDisk lets me see a list of the files and folders on D : , but no other luck .	St
1.1.8	My plan ( and tell me if you have a better one , please ) is to do a complete copy of D : onto another hard drive , in a last ditch effort to save my files .	St
1.1.9	A SeaGate 300 gig arrived in the mail today to serve this purpose , it is currently still in the box , unformatted .	St
1.1.10	My question iswhat is the best way to go about this copy ?	Ques
1.1.11	I have a Maxtor Ultra ATA PCI card that Im not usingshould I try and add a third hard drive to an already packed system ( I have a DVD drive and a CD burner as well ) long enough to perform the copy ?	Ques
1.1.12	Should I temporarily attach the new SeaGate to another computer on my home network ?	Ques
1.1.13	The problem with that is , I imagine I would have to be in Windows to use the network , and the D : is not accessible through Windows ( the heart of the problem ) .	St
1.1.14	If I temporarily take out my current C : and put the new drive in its place , could I do the copy without installing Windows ?	Ques
1.1.15	Any other ideas ?	Ques
1.1.16	Copy program suggestions would also be welcome .	St
1.2.1	On all my machines , I use two hard drives .	St
1.2.2	One for the master and one to backup an exact duplicate of the master .	St
1.2.3	I use two detachable trays to hold and extract every thing .	St
1.2.4	Ghost is a bit copier that runs in a Dos enviornment and will copy everything backwards or forward .	St
1.2.5	I can use any of the machines to & quot ; Ghost & quot ; any disk that I want to by inserting the master and slave in any machine , which I do several times a week .	St
1.2.6	If my master gets corrupted , I can copy from the slave in about 15min .	St
1.2.7	or take the slave , make it master , plug it in and I am good to go .	Sug
1.2.8	I experiment a lot and this arrangement has saved my soul more than once .	St
1.2.9	Now your plan is a good one .	St
1.2.10	Use a machine , any machine , plug the one drive in on the master and plug the new drive as slave , then insert a Boot copy of Ghost in the A drive , power up the machine and follow the on screen directions .	St
1.2.11	I use an old 2002 copy of Ghost .	St
1.2.12	Norm	St
1.3.1	I 've got a copy of Norton Ghost 8.0 .	St
1.3.2	I just tried using it , and while it could 'see ' the D : drive , but it is greyed out in th menu , unlike the C : drive .	St
1.3.3	It ca n't make an image of it , or copy it ... it says the drive is not partitioned , and so can not be accessed .	St
1.3.4	Just formatted the new 300 gig seagate .	St
1.3.5	So I just need to find a copy program that can access the problematic maxtor ...	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	I 've seen this many times .	St
1.5.2	Especially with external drives that have lost power while connected to windows .	St
1.5.3	EasyRecovery DataRecovery can recover the data .	St
1.5.4	It 's $ 200 , but it will do it .	St
1.5.5	You can download a trial from the ontrack website that will let you see what files are recoverable before purchasing .	St
1.5.6	This is the only solution that works that I have experience with .	St
1.6.1	Ghost wo n't work because your file system/ partition is lost .	St
1.6.2	Even if you did a sector by sector copy you still would n't be able to access the data because Ghost wo n't seen the file system .	St
1.6.3	Disk Wizard will not allow you to see or recreate the old file system , just reformat the drive with a new one .	St
1.7.1	Hi .	St
1.7.2	Could you please let us know an update of your situation & gt ; ?	Ques
1.7.3	what did you use in the end and what was the result ?	Ques
1.7.4	I have just had a scare with myE : drive which has about 80G of movies and other things on there , i am right now scanning it in the background with HDD Regenerator .	St
1.7.5	I already have a copy of the program recommended by ontrack so I am armed ; just hoping I do n't need it !	St
1.7.6	I would like to know what happened here though so do let us know .	St
1.8.1	A hard disk is temporary storage .	St
1.8.2	If you do n't believe it , I 'll wait .	St
1.8.3	Bob	St
1.9.1	hi , i work for a professional data recovery company and have a feeling that while you are copying your data , it may or may not be a success .	St
1.9.2	try to seek the help of a professional data recovery company who are experts in retrieving data out of corrupted drives .	St
1.9.3	most data recovery programs are not very expensive , and you could in fact have saved the cost of buying a new hard drive if you had sought help from people like us .	St
1.9.4	the cost of one our products is less than half of what you spent on the new drive .	St
1.9.5	anyway , there 's still hope .	St
1.9.6	my comapny 's website address is http : //www.stellarinfo.com try it out once ...	Sug
