<s> Hello, My (quite) old PC (5 years, I think) has Windows ME and is, of course, as crotchety as Frasier's dad (and as fussy as Frasier). </s>
<s> One day, I downloaded a plethora of MS Windows Updates and installed them. </s>
<s> I didn't notice any particular improvements on my PC, but one thing I immediately noticed was, upon startup, my computer goes into a VERY slow and choppy process, culminating with Windows popping my SYSTEM folder onto the desktop for all to see. </s>
<s> Aside from the obvious security issues this raises, I suspect it's played a not-insignificant role in slowing down my computer's startup sequence. </s>
<s> Does anyone know how I can tell my computer to shut that subroutine off? </s>
<s> Thanx, The Wren </s>
<s> hmm maybe try going to the control panel and opening the add remove programs and removing the update cuz im running a 733mhz with windows xp from a pc thats probably as old as your and has parts that are just mixed and matched. </s>
<s> Those windows updates dont do anything good they just slow everything down. </s>
<s> When i would update from the site i would restart and slower than ever. </s>
<s> But im not to familiar with the Me vers of windows but its worth a shot. </s>
<s> Best bet if you're pc is that old and as of this month microsoft is not supporting wimdows 98 or ME spend a little cash and buy a new pc like from walmart at 500 bucks you will get xp and a computer that will last another 5 years </s>
<s> Can you tell us the PC maker and model number (example: Dell Dimension 2400)? </s>
<s> What CPU? </s>
<s> How much memory (RAM)? </s>
<s> Hard drive total size and free space? </s>
<s> Are you running any security programs? </s>
<s> Antivirus Antispyware Firewall </s>
<s> More specs on the PC: HP Pavilion 7950 CPU is an AMD Athlon Processor 384 MB of RAM (been upgraded twice) Hard drive capacity: 55.8 GB Free space: 35.4 I have an old McAfee VirusScan v. 4.5.1 SP1 that I'm not sure has ever been updated. </s>
<s> Aside from that I occasionally run AdAware and Spybot on this thing. </s>
<s> Oh, and I tried using Add/Remove Programs to remove any old Windows updates in the hopes of extracting the offending startup sequence, but to no avail. </s>
<s> It still shows my SYSTEM folder... </s>
<s> Download AVG Free and run a full scan. </s>
<s> The results will indicate any partition failures. </s>
<s> Run the Windows Upgrade Advisor. </s>
<s> It will tell you if you may have any hardware / software issues. </s>
<s> Tell us what you find. </s>
<s> Hello again, After running the Complete Scan in AVG, it found about 8 Trojan viruses on my computer (all are in a Virus Vault now). </s>
<s> Nothing mentioning a partition failure or the like. </s>
<s> As for Windows Upgrade Advisor... </s>
<s> I'm not sure what this is. </s>
<s> Is it another program for me to download, or is it part of ME? </s>
<s> When I know what to do with it, I'll let you know what it tells me. </s>
<s> Best, The Wren </s>
