take the side panels off and try running it to see if it may be heat related.
i usually place a big floor fan beside the open box and blow air through it.
if you find it doesn't re-boot or as often, then replace your case fans or add some more and consider that after 3 years some components may be getting weaker and more susceptible to heat issues.
i'd also suggest you start a routine backup procedure.
