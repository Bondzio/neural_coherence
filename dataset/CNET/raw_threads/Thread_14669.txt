Before you start posting suggestions, please take the time to read my specs and situation. Most people just start telling me I need a simple KVM switch, but I have already purchased a KVM switch from TRENDnet (the TK-209) and this isn't what I need. I work equally between 3 different locations, home, office, and girlfriend's apartment. I have a monitor, keyboard, and mouse combination at each of the three locations (that's 3 wide screen monitors, 3 keyboards, and 3 mice total). I also have two different laptops (one mac, one pc), and a desktop at Home (for my home business, not work). The solution would be an item that meets the following criteria: 1. simple button/quick switch option for changing between target computers (like how the KVM has 2 buttons, press 1 and it displays input from PC 1, etc.) 2. when pressing the above button/toggling between PCs I need it to bring the mouse and keyboard input along with it (not all of my monitors are USB, and I don't think the USB inputs communicate via the graphics port - is this correct?). The problem with the KVM switch is that I have to unplug my mouse and keyboard every time I want to switch computers. Kind Regards, Seth B. W.

As these 3 locations are unlikely to be in range of any cable or technology today you may be stuck with your current solutions. I will share I made my life easier by putting the same make and model mouse (and keyboard when possible) across all my machines. But found any switches to be a dead end with problems on most of them.

My point about them being in 3 different locations is simply that whatever solutions are proposed will have to be portable to be viable. Not looking for vpn, remote acces, etc, just a simple switch that i can control 3 pcs with. Right now I have my Mac hooked up to the LCD at home if I hit the 2 button on the KVM the display switches to my Win7 desktop machine, but I have to unplug the mouse &amp; keyboard and plug them into the desktop (therein lies the problem).

Your problem is the PCs (Macs, laptops, whatever) are not supplying enough current thru their USB ports to adequately power the KVM chip. Since the TK-209 has no option to use a power adapter, you have to attach at least one PC (not laptop) from its rear USB port. Or buy another KVM which has a DC power input option.
