is when you try to share the the internet connection, your computers become a part two totally different networks.
you may share folders when you are on the same network.
i believe one of your computers is getting its address from your dsl connection on one nic, and the other nic crossed over to the other computer, when internet connection sharing is enabled, is setting a default address of 192.168.0.1 which is typical of windows.
your computer with two nics is a part of the dhcp enabled network and your other computer is a part of another network created when you enabled ics.
two totally different networks, but your second computer can now have internet access.
you just sacrifice the sharing abilities.
get a router with a four port switch and your problems are solved.
both will share printer and files and internet connection and the router becomes additional defense to others attempting to access or &quot;see&quot; your local network and computers.
a kind of hardware firewall.
