<s> I have a system that was gutted by a friend, and I am wanting to turn it into a 'new' desktop system for home. </s>
<s> It was originally a server that they used, with dual processors (2 - AMD 2GHz). </s>
<s> Like I said, they gutted it, and left only the motherboard, processors, case, fans. </s>
<s> I tried flipping it on, to see if it was even worth messing with, and after only 1-2 seconds, the fans shut down, and a led came on in the middle of the mobo, signalling that it was overheating. </s>
<s> I pulled the heat sinks off(dual processors, remember), put new thermal grease between them and the processors, and tried to start it up again...no difference. </s>
<s> It still shut down after 1-2 secs, and the overheating light came on. </s>
<s> I was going to buy ram/hdd/etc, but if it won't make it more than 2 secs, I figured it would need some more help. </s>
<s> Any suggestions, or should this be 'retired'? </s>
<s> System specs: (not much right now!) </s>
<s> dual AMD socket A processors, 2 ghz (AMSN2400DKT3C) mobo: Gigabyte GA-7DPXDW-P 450W power supply, 4, 80 mm fans in case </s>
<s> your HSF's can't possibly be adequately coupled for heat transfer to the CPU's. </s>
<s> You may have too much thermal grease on them, however, I suspect that the clamping system is fouled up. </s>
<s> Clamping the HSF's tight enough can be a very scary process. </s>
<s> Of course they may be totally inadequate HSF's. </s>
<s> I assume while experimenting, the case is off thus the general issue of cooling the total interior of the case is not a problem. </s>
<s> Are the fans running at top speed? </s>
<s> If plugged into the mobo with three pin connectors they are temperature controlled, maybe the controllers are bad. </s>
<s> Get adapters to run the fans at full 12 volts by connecting to the big molex connectore. </s>
<s> They gave you the system with the cpus already present suggests they didn't have much luck with it either. </s>
<s> I suppose the cpus themseleves are already buggered and may well be toast or at least one of them. </s>
<s> Overall, if possible does that mtrbd. </s>
<s> work with one cpu installed alone? </s>
<s> If so, test that way. </s>
<s> otherwise, verify correct amount of cpu grease and further that is clean before install if older thermal paste was used. </s>
<s> Thena pply new grease, otherwise AMDs aren't very overtemp tolerant. </s>
<s> Remove cpus just to check the socket-A's placement, is glased or browned it shows alot of temp was active, not a good sign. </s>
<s> This excludes any other possiible cause mtrbd. </s>
<s> or elsewhere. </s>
<s> Play with it is basically the best t/s I can give, but if the cpus are socket-A type are they transferable to another single socket-A mtrbd. </s>
<s> if so, then try that. </s>
<s> The cpu p/n# is present on the top surface or the die or bottom. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
