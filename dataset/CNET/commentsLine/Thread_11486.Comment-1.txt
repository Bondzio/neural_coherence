i just hooked up a linksys wireless g 2.4ghz router on a gateway pc-pentium 4, 3.0ghz and 512mb ram.
i'm now experiencing a major slow down or non-response in opening up programs, logging onto the internet, opening up email and spastic mouse movements (also wireless, but with two new batteries installed on 8/30).
anyone know what's up with this?
