1.1.1	This is mainly directed at anyone who is running the above monitor and can give me some feedback .	St
1.1.2	Hardware that might have a bearing on the problem Graphics card : NVIDIA GeForce 8400 GS Monitor : Acer AL2216Wbd I received mine on Friday from Newegg and hooked it up .	St
1.1.3	I have both the analogue and DVI connections operative , and have checked the problem on both feeds .	St
1.1.4	The first thing I noticed was the colors seemed rather blotchy and blocky on any photos I have , and do process a lot of photos on my PC .	St
1.1.5	Also , when I go to a mostly white screen like the Explorer panel , there is a very marked magenta color caste and the whole screen has a softish salmon colored look to it .	St
1.1.6	This is when the screen is viewed dead square on .	St
1.1.7	If I raise up and look down at a 20 or 30 degree angle the color caste diminishes quite noticably , and it shifts more to a cooler , more acceptable color .	St
1.1.8	I have run the reset on the monitor and I have run through its own color calibration wizard , none of which really helps much at all .	St
1.1.9	I 've worked with various monitors for years , and the only time I 've seen color like this is when its been on VGA monitors that are years old and on their way out ( just to give the more experiended here an idea of what the display problem actually looks like ) .	St
1.1.10	My wife has a Hann 19 & quot ; LCD panel , and there is no similar problem at all on her display .	St
1.1.11	OK - its a different brand , and its smaller , but I do expect a similar output , which I am not getting at all .	St
1.1.12	I 've been using a 19 & quot ; CRT display up until now , and this & quot ; upgrade & quot ; has been a very sad disappointment to me .	St
1.1.13	I understand that CRT can often give a much better image than LCD , but still , this Acer LCD panel has received very high ratings .	St
1.1.14	Before I RMA it , I wanted to hear if anyone has any similar experience , or can confirm that their 22 & quot ; Acer panel does not display similar faults .	St
1.1.15	I do n't have a second one to use for direct comparison , so this is the next step .	St
1.1.16	It would also help if you post process a good amount of photos successfully on the Acer and can let me know how the monitor performs for that .	St
1.1.17	Maybe I am expecting too much , but even browsing the web in general makes me shudder at some of the color renditions on this particular unit .	St
1.2.1	You may want something better like a BARCO .	St
1.2.2	See http : //www.google.com/products ? q=barco+lcd+display & btnG=Search+Products & hl=en & show=dd & checkout=1 These are much better at proper color without the effect you noted .	St
1.2.3	Remember you will pay a little more for this .	St
1.2.4	- & gt ; If this is not your goal ( color perfection ) try shopping locally where you can test the displays and do n't forget to get a HUEY .	St
1.2.5	See HUEY at http : //reviews.cnet.com/desktop-monitors-displays-accessories/pantone-huey-pro/4505-6513_7-32378689.html Bob	St
