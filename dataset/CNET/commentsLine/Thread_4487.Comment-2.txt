possibles here, the usb hub is bad or the connection is dirty.
the quick fix for a dirty contact is to clean those, use a q-tip with alcohol and swab them down and check results.
also, be careful to view those same contacts for any peeled, or otherwise damaged contact.
if the hub is bad, no fix at all, though you can still check them for presence in the h/w device manager from the control panel area.
if any usb attention flags are present, like yellow or red, report back.
since, your pc usb ports are ok, this is probably only that bad hub at fault at monitor.
you can buy a &quot;satellite hub&quot; attach it to a rear pc usb port and use that in place of now bad monitor located one.
these are of small cost and are easily available, just buy a decent one.
