why are you doling out the details?
i've guessed wrong 2 times now and given your useless information.
sorry about that, but it could explain why you are finding it difficult to find help.
in closing, it seems you have a normal setup.
in that case just read what came with the router.
nothing is out of the ordinary so i bid you well and write that your setup has thousands of web sites of help.
