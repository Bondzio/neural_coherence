Before even picking out the model, I was wondering what your rankings of the companies are. By choosing a company, I can go from there and buy a specific type. Please, anyone, make a top list of the best companies out there. (in your personal opinion of course) Thanks -J

This is where it all breaks down and you find little support. If you look at Apple you find a lot less in the virus, trojan, etc so that issue is not a big deal. Support is better since you deal with just one company for the OS and hardware. And you pay for what you get... Bob
