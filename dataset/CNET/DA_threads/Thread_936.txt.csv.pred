St
1.1.2	I was sad becasue It was like I had 2 hard drive failers within 2 months ... .	St
1.1.3	I WAS WONDERING THOUGH ... is this from me transfering files from my failing HARD DRIVE VAIO ( like mp3s and pix ) to my Windows VISTA XPS420 ... did I bring a virus over that killed my next systems HARD DRIVE ?	Ques

1.1.5	ha THNX , , , , , much HELP/advise wanted	St
1.2.1	Windows does n't work with failing hardware well .	St
1.2.2	So you need to FOLLOW DIRECTIONS .	St
1.2.3	I see it told you to backup your files but it appears you did n't do that .	St
1.2.4	Instead you delayed and now are moving the failing drive to a new machine and complaining that Windows does n't like failing drives .	St
1.2.5	GO AHEAD and complain about that .	St
1.2.6	When you are done you 'll want to try going back to what did boot and work to get your files out .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	There 's no telling by what you did .	St
1.3.2	You should backup , then xfer files , them check for any malware .	St
1.3.3	In fact , you should had checked for malware before xferring any files .	St
1.3.4	It 's possible to cause problems by xferring some malware as it attack continues , but normally , it should have been more obivous .	St
1.3.5	If you have a true h/w fault , then getting problems now by xfering files is nil but again I do n't know what total files they were .	St
1.3.6	Dell , has a know issue with losing HDs under Vista , check thier support website for details and/or check the forums of theirs .	St
1.3.7	Run some anti-virus tests or use the free online services check here at virus & security forum for links to same .	St
1.3.8	good luck -- -- -- Willy	Polite
1.4.1	No No No I Didnt move my DRIVE I was backing up my old data just to a new computer by using the DATA TRANSFER THING in vista ...	St
1.4.2	I was saying that could my new HD failed beacuse I brought a virus over from my old computer ... so I most likely shouldnt tranfer my files or If I do use a SCAN on em ...	St
1.5.1	I would n't discount anything .	St
1.5.2	Let 's look at a recent disaster .	St
1.5.3	The owner was a P2P user downloading cracked software .	St
1.5.4	They had no end of troubles on all their machines .	St
1.5.5	Frankly I think they should get a Mac since this may be the only cure for them since they are convinced Windows is buggy as ell .	St
1.5.6	They ca n't see the cracks for what they are .	St
1.5.7	Their last comment was that Norton ( yet another cracked software ! )	St
1.5.8	should have protected them .	St
1.5.9	The protection starts with us .	St
1.5.10	No , I 'm not saying you have such an issue but thinking that Norton or other software will stop today 's pests is wishful thinking .	St
