The thing is, I have a desktop that needs to be connected to the internet. Now, the thing I realized is that I don't have a cable outlet where the desktop is placed in. All I have is an ethernet outlet in that room and I am using that outlet for my wireless router. What should I do? should I just buy an wireless adaptor for my desktop?
