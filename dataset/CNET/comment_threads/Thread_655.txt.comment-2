Motherboard, could be something else.
Try different RAM first.
If that fails, it it likely the motherboard.
But just about any component could cause that to happen for one reason or another (or no reason).
Since you have reinstalled windows and it still happens, I am not very inclined to think it is a software issue, although it is possible.
