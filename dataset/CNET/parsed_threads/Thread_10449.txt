<s> 256mb!?! </s>
<s> Man thats bad. </s>
<s> Depending on how fast you get money, some of your stuff your upgrading now will become useless! </s>
<s> Save it for a while and build a nice new pc. </s>
<s> Check out the &quot;new computer ~1500$ budget&quot; Thread. </s>
<s> There's some nice desktop specs for a new PC in there for under 1500$. </s>
<s> It's not worth upgrading little by little. </s>
<s> the more i think about pouring any money into that old computer the more i don't want to, i think i'm gonna take your advice and just save for a while </s>
