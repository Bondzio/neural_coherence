I bought a Asus N6600, and it ran fine for about a day, and then basically anything 3d heavy looked like this: http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/5726/wow1si6.jpg i thought it was the card, so i sent it back, and recieved a new one(same model) a week later. NO CHANGE. i can only assume its my computer, since i tested it on my friend's computer and it was fine. What could be the problem? a friend suggested it was overheating, but whenever i check, the GPU is always under 40C, usually the same for the CPU. This is really starting to bother me. What is causing this? I have a P4 2.20GHz, with a gig of ram. my motherboard is a Gigabyte GA-8S650GXM (i can post full spec report if needed) Also, Yes,I have every driver posssible and everything updateable updated. Please help!

If yes revert back to that day and add them in one at a time. If no, look for a hardware problem. Did your previous graphics card have a fan and draw power or is this a new load on that power supply? What size P/S is your friend using?

Also, yesterday i thought it might be the ram, so i ran a momory test program, and i got some interesting results. when i tested each stick of ram individually, i got no errors, but together, i did get some. i tried running HL2 with just one stick, and after 15 muinites or so, it went haywire, much like when using both sticks. so i dont think its the RAM. with Ram and video card ruled out, i gues the power supply could be it. could it be the motherboard?? can a software problem cause these types of severe graphical glitches (see screenshot in first post.

You can check this by looking at your current voltages in your bios, or by downloading a program that will show you your current voltages. Check your 12v. If it's running around 11.5 or lower then that is most likely the problem.
