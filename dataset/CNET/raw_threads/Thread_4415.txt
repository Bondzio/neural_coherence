I've done a lot of research with respect to its performance for Xbox Live. I have an Xbox Live account but my console simply cannot connect. Even fiddling with WPA/WPA2, etc doesn't do the trick. A lot of other people have this problem with this Arris unit. My question is, how do I make a D-Link Wireless N router as the gateway, leaving the Arris ONLY as the modem? Thanks!

No one can answer your question until you exactly tell the router model. If you do require the solution urgently try to go for your local network support service provider who can communicate with you quickly. This might help you more.
