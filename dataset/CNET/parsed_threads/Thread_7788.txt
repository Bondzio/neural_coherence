<s> possibily damaged/faulty OR imcompatible ram. </s>
<s> This is given that you've tried all possible combination of testing and the system works when it's using the original ram. </s>
<s> If you have another system to try the new ram and works, then imcompatibility, but if the other system also displays same problems, then the problem lies with the ram itself. </s>
<s> Did the ram comes in its original packing? </s>
<s> Check on the ram for any scratches as it would indicate damage as well (that is if you are able to do so). </s>
