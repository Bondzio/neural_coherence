<s> I have an 80GB USB Iomega HD hard drive attached to a Windows XP desktop. </s>
<s> I purchased the Iomega in part because I really liked the Iomega backup program--automated, worked in the background, reliable. </s>
<s> I have no trouble transferring files to and from the hard drive. </s>
<s> But the Iomega backup software works once, maybe twice, and then gives an &quot;error starting backup&quot; message. </s>
<s> Sometimes going to the control panel and using 'repair program' works. </s>
<s> But more often it doesn't. </s>
<s> This is not what I'd call hassle-free backup. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what might be going wrong? </s>
<s> I'm running ZoneAlarm and AVG as well as AdAware; could there be a conflict with one of those or is the Iomega backup software just problematic? </s>
<s> &quot; is the Iomega backup software just problematic? </s>
<s> &quot; I've yet to encounter non-problematic backup software. </s>
<s> It's always &quot;something&quot;. </s>
<s> As it is that way, I've developed my own backup methods such as written at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6138-0.html?forumID=31&threadID=44323&messageID=523281&tag=srch This is not an Iomega Backup web site, but just a general discussion forum so all we can do is share our experiences and if we are lucky, find a cure for such issues. </s>
<s> If you feel that the Iomega software is buggy or needs fixing then the only place to go is ... where you suspect. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> The Iomega site is naturally the first place I checked. </s>
<s> The &quot;support&quot; offered there is nominal, and they definitely aren't making it easy for customers to get in touch with them. </s>
<s> I like your backup method; it's similar to what I've been doing since Iomega backup has been misbehaving. </s>
<s> It would make life easier, though, to find a program that would synchronize a specific catalog of files with the backup folder. </s>
<s> I have a list of about 15 folders and several individual files that need to be backed up frequently, and selecting them individually is a pain. </s>
