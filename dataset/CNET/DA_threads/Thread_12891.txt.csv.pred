1.1.1	Hi , I do n't know if this is the right Forum page but ; I have 2 computers in the house and wonder how I can connect them together and run both from the same internet address .	St
1.1.2	Both on XP home Is it USB or other ?	Ques
1.1.3	Any help will be greatly appreciated	Polite
1.2.1	Two PCs can not have the same IP address on a network .	St
1.2.2	Therefore , I will presume you have an internet connection you wish to share .	St
1.2.3	There are two ways to do this depending on what type of connection you have .	St
1.2.4	If it 's a dial up connection , you can share the modem connection with another PC .	St
1.2.5	You need to setup Windows ICS ( internet connection sharing ) .	St
1.2.6	It requires separate IP addresses for each PC , however .	St
1.2.7	If you have a broadband connection , you can also share it the same way but the best approach is to use a router with separate ports for each PC .	St
1.2.8	The router has 1 IP address and is referred to as a & quot ; gateway & quot ; .	St
1.2.9	The PCs can can connect to the router but , again , they will have their own IP addresses as well .	St
1.2.10	No two devices on the same network can have the same address but can share resources with any .	St
1.2.11	Hope this makes sense .	St
1.2.12	If you want to post back with more about your internet connection type you will get a better answer for your application .	St
1.3.1	Hi , yes thanks , I have Broadband ( AOL ) and want to share the account with 2 computers .	Polite
1.3.2	What I need to know is how to physically connect the computers together ( if thats needed ) to share the AOL B/band account	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
