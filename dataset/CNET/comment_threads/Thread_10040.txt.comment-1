ASUS M2N32-SLI Deluxe AM2 motherboard, AMD 64 X2 3800+ CPU / 1 stick of 1 gb Corsair pro 800 ddr2 ram / 500 watt Antec PSU .
I have Windows XP home sp2 that is installed on a IDE drive that was running fine on a older Asus A7V 133 system .
I have installed the new components and windows won't boot even in safe mode .
The system goes through POST fine with standard 1 beep , I can access BIOS and all components and memory are recognized without problems .
My skill level is a novice at these problems , any input would be helpful .
Thanks .
