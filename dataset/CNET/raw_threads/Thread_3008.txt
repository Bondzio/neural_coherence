9647	0	106993	1221268	NR	leewint	6/2/05 10:15 AM	1.1177073E12	Loading Maxblast3 on desktop	For some strange reason I haven't figured out yet why, I can't get past the following, when attempting to load Maxblast3 on a clean (formatted) drive. &quot;IDE CD-ROM device driver installed&quot; The screen displayes this message then hangs up. I thought it might be something in the the CMOS setup but I don't see anything there that is out of line - so to speak. I have a MSI K8N Neo Platinum 3000+ board with an eVGA video card and 512 Kingston stick of memory. Since this is a &quot;home build&quot; I can't go to the mfg for an answer . Oh yes, this is an 80Gb Maxtor drive that I want to run Maxblast on. Would anyone share their knowledge of this type of problem? Thanks in advance Leland Winters leewintl@cox.net

MAXBLAST is not usually installed to the hard disk. Most of the time you use it to test a drive. If you want less spam, make a new (safer) post and ask this one be deleted. Bob
