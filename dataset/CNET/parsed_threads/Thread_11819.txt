<s> A couple of weeks ago, I was blissfully using my computer, minding my own business, when the screen flickered and dimmed as it switched over to battery power. </s>
<s> I'd had problems with A/C adapters with other computers in the past, so I assumed it was a short in the wire. </s>
<s> Moving the cord around a little briefly got it back on A/C power, but even that quickly stopped working and I could see the battery was draining. </s>
<s> (I hardly ever use the battery, so I guess it's no surprise.) </s>
<s> I had enough time to save many large directories to an external hard drive before I shut down. </s>
<s> I called Dell to order a new adapter, but they told me they no longer stocked the model I needed as my laptop is one and a half years old (!!! </s>
<s> ), but they could send me a &quot;travel&quot; adapter for more money. </s>
<s> I agreed. </s>
<s> but when I received the travel adapter the next day and tried it out, I discovered my computer was running very slowly and the adapter was getting extremely hot. </s>
<s> I returned the travel adapter to Dell and found the regular adapter on eBay listed as new. </s>
<s> My computer ran fine with the new adapter for several days, then switched over to battery again with no warning. </s>
<s> This time moving the cord had no effect, and the battery drained even faster then before. </s>
<s> I quickly shut down all my programs and turned off the computer just before it drained completely. </s>
<s> So, perhaps I got a faulty adapter off eBay, but now I'm wondering if my problem is really the battery. </s>
<s> I'm reluctant to try returning the adapter only to get a new one from eBay, plug anything in and turn it on, only to have something fry because the problem was elsewhere. </s>
<s> Any advice on what I should try next?p </s>
<s> the port in which you plug your cord has probably become loose over the year. </s>
<s> since your laptop is out-of-warranty, you could try resoldering it yourself (really cheap), finding an electronics shop to do it for you (reasonably cheap), or finding a laptop repair shop (EXPENSIVE). </s>
<s> if you've got any soldering skills, open that puppy up and warm up your cold soldering tool! </s>
<s> I agree with Ramarc. </s>
<s> It sounds like a broken adapter socket. </s>
<s> I have had this problem in the past and after Opening the case (which is a big pain for such a small repair)and resoldering,I cut the adapter cord about four inches from the end and rejoined with a standard small connector. </s>
<s> Instead of unpluging from the notenook I now undo the connector and leave the fourinch pigtail in the socket. </s>
<s> I know this approach offends those with a perchant for tidieness but I rate utility over tidieness. </s>
