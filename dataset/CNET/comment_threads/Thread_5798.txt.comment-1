Hello folks, I am in need of a portable scanner.
The one that perfectly fits the bill is, VuPoint Magic Wand but its not in the market yet.
According to the customer service, it will be available by November this year, so I guess, they are prepping for holiday season.
I wonder if there is any other product similar to this.
There was one from PanDigital but I doubt they make it anymore (and their customer service is close to pathetic so I am not interested in their product).
Will be glad to know.
Many thanks in advance.
