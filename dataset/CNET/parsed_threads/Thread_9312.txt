<s> Hi guys, My desktop PC has two SyncMaster 940N 19&quot; LCD monitors. </s>
<s> Lately (noticed it for the first time a couple of days ago, and it's happening again now) I've noticed an problem with the right hand one only. </s>
<s> I'm not sure how to describe it, but it seems as if high contrast things leave a &quot;shadow&quot; (darker or lighter depending on how the contrast is) to the right of them. </s>
<s> I've taken screenshots and added the shadow in how I see it - it's something wrong with the monitor itself displaying things, hence the shadow doesn't show up in screenshots. </s>
<s> http://members.westnet.com.au/gbaatard/monitor1.jpg The bars of shadow have been added to the right hand column which is meant to be solid blue. </s>
<s> Here's the original page: http://www.techspot.com/news/29994-mpaa-demands-154-million-from-the-pirate-bay.html As you can see, the shadow lines up with lines of text / buttons, and is darker where the blue &quot;Techspot Pricewatch&quot; bar is. </s>
<s> http://members.westnet.com.au/gbaatard/monitor2.jpg This one is more obvious... the background is meant to be solid black, yet there's a lighter section to the right of the notepad window. </s>
<s> In the past I've very rarely (total of 2 or 3 times over a couple of years) had one monitor (im sure it was the right one most of if not all the times) go entirely solid bright grey - the pc keeps working fine, but nothing can be done to make the grey go away other than rebooting. </s>
<s> I put this down to an occasional wibble in the powersource or videocard... </s>
<s> In both the current issue and the greyscreen, turning the monitor off and back on doesn't help. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> The PC was built by a friend (who I've lost contact with) from parts he got wholesale, so it's not under warranty... </s>
<s> Thanks, Kefka Some PC Specs, although I doubt they'll be too relevant: Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU 6600 @ 2.40GHz (2 CPUs) DirectX Version: DirectX 9.0c (4.09.0000.0904) Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS 640 MB </s>
<s> Swap monitors around, if the problem persists in the same side, think the video card is faulty. </s>
<s> If not and appears on other side then monitor. </s>
<s> You should also use a monitor testing gauge/pattern to check results and fine tune output and make as best as possible beforehand, to help in these matters. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Sometimes the shadowing problem can be attributed to a faulty video connection between the PC and monitor. </s>
<s> Try these simple things first. </s>
<s> Reseat the video cable at both ends first, and make sure they are securely fastened. </s>
<s> If the cable is poorly shielded, you may have to separate the cable from other nearby power cords in order to isolate interference problems. </s>
<s> If the above actions do not fix your problem, then try swapping the cables between monitors. </s>
<s> Thanks, I tried that briefly the other night when it was happening, and it may have helped a bit - it's not a permanent problem, and when it does happen it's often very subtle and barely noticeable... At least, until I notice it, after which I can't stop noticing it :P Will fiddle with the cables properly and see if it helps. </s>
<s> If no luck with that, will look into it further as suggested by Willy and try to isolate the problem. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Reseated the plug in on the monitor end, no help... </s>
<s> But noticed the shadowing got a bit better/worse when fiddling with the cable... Reseated it on the video card end, and shadowing disappeared. </s>
<s> Yay! </s>
<s> Thanks muchly. </s>
<s> Great job! </s>
<s> Glad you were able to fix it without too much trouble. </s>
<s> I was going to say that it is a common problem, Happens with VGA cables, fidgeting is a short fix, if it returns, replace the VGA cable. </s>
<s> I have seen it dozens of times. </s>
<s> I think thats what your problem is. </s>
