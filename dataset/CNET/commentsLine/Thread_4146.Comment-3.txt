just my preference, when i put in a second drive i always format it as a system disk and put an os on it too in case the other drive dies suddenly.
i don't know xp but i always do &quot;cable select&quot; on the jumpers.
works well for me and makes things easier and more versatile if you're &quot;the mess around with it&quot; type.
i also always put in a second parition of about 1 gig so i can put my delorme map cd on that and not have to put it in the cd drive for it to work.
