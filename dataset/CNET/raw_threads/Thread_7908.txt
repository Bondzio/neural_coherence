7452	2	222938	2344954	2344926	linkit	12/12/06 12:08 AM	1.16588208E12	sound card	Adding a dedicated sound card should give you more FPS in gaming and possibly better sound than the motherboard's integrated sound. &quot;Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeMusic&quot; PCI card has the X-Fi 24-bit Crystallizer and X-Fi CMSS-3D that the $53.99 Xmod adapter has. You can find it right now for $72.99 after rebate.

7452	5	222938	2345514	2345452	linkit	12/12/06 1:08 PM	1.16592888E12	You make a good point	I would also use the onboard sound and divert the savings to other components, but I was thinking that koolman51 seems to value high quality or enhanced music and sound. If it's a choice between the Xmod and an X-Fi card, I choose the X-Fi card if they are similarly priced. Maybe koolman51 can shed some light on what he wants out of this system?

Just a thought.
