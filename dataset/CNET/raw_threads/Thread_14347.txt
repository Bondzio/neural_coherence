I recently shied away from the iMac 27&quot; due to price and upgrade inability and decided on getting another pc. I am a print designer so I will not be rendering video or anything to demanding. I loved the appearance of the Maingear Potenza and also tower size is an issue in my little apartment which has led to me to the Maingear Potenza: http://www.maingear.com/custom/desktops/potenza/ What are your guys' thoughts about this computer and if you have any recommendations that would be greatly appreciated. I want to keep the price under 1,500. Thanks, Tyler

It turns out that memory bandwidth and PCIe throughput don't hold back the performance of existing Sandy Bridge-based machines. &quot; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-cpu-review-overclock,3106-4.html So for a gamer, you usually get that or better CPU and then go as far up this next list as you can go. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html The site you noted appears to cater to those that want good lucks over performance.
