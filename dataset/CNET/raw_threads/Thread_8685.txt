It looks impressive,however; I have a few doubts - 1. the review said that it does not have media server capabilities : I would like to know what this exactly means because one of the test details provided was read/write and access time for media. 2. would i be able to remote-access the drive using a VPN (Hamachi) thank you

Pls elaborate I am not considering this for backup purposes, I just want a centralized location for all my media (have backups on DVD's and CD's). Cnet rates ximeta as having a good transfer speed (the fastest in the list). Nas or NDAS I just want a drive from which I will be able to read/write media files (350MB - 8GB)without glitches/interruptions I am also not bothered by the requirement to install driver software for use( the number of computers that would be accessing files stored on the drive is just one) I would also like you to elaborate on the media serving shortcomings of Ximeta in some detail(I just dont understand what it means) Thankyou
