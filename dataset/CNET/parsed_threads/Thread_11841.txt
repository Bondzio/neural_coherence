<s> HI, I;m looking at building my own system. </s>
<s> this is the question i had. </s>
<s> is the XFX GeForce 8400 GS (with 512 ram) good? </s>
<s> I would be using this with a Asus M2N-E SLI. </s>
<s> here's a link to where I was going to buy it. </s>
<s> thanks, http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3324267&CatId=1826 </s>
<s> games? </s>
<s> no. </s>
<s> this 8500gt is faster (but still not fast enough for games) and cheaper after rebate: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127297 this 8400gs is cheaper: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130288 don't be fooled by 512mb. </s>
<s> on this class video card, 512mb is useless. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> good for games like battle for middle earth 2. </s>
<s> (A RTS game.) </s>
<s> pretty much light to medium gaming. </s>
<s> if this card isn't good that would you recmoned? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> as little as possible, but I'm think about 70-100$ for the card. </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com Best info about the current video cards avialable. </s>
<s> Cards are covered in all price ranges .... the lower the cost, the slower the card and the video card makes a HUGE difference in gaming. </s>
