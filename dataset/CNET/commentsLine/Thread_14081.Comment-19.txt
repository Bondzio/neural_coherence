any help i'm afraid.
and according to your reference ..which is consistent with my experience, the limitation pertains to a jumper on the hard disk drive as indicated below...not the mb 2. jumper setting limiting hard drive space a minimal mistake of inserting the jumper into hard disk jumper block will result in limiting the hard disk capacity to 32gb if hdd is of higher capacity or 2.1gb otherwise.
the first and last jumper block confusion will lead to such problem.
the first placement will be for master, and last for limiting, users confuse it and find their hard drives limited to 32 gb.
refer to this diagram which illustrates the jumper usage in hard drives.
