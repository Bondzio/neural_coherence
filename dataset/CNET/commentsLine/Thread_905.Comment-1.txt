i use a hughesnet satellite with a d-link dir655 router.
hughesnet limits me to 425m per day.
once exceeded, i get knocked down to slow dialup for 24 hours.
i need a router based bandwidth monitor for total traffic accumulating daily (but starting at 4am).
i need to be able to see how much bandwidth i've accumulated at any time during the day.
i have two wireless clients and four wired clients constantly connected.
total bandwidth is all i absolutely need, but having the bandwidth separated out by clients would help a great deal to isolate usage problems when one of the clients runs away.
i've perused the tomato and dd wrt firmware packages but haven't found enough detail to know if they will work.
plus, my dir655 does not appear as supported.
if i need to get a new router, i need one with wireless capabilities.
i had a linksys wrt54g previously but it needed reboots off and on, plus the wireless connection was too slow (for skype - our only means of communication out in the remote oregon coast range where i live).
the dir655 has never hung up and the speeds are good.
so, has anyone ever addressed this issue?
is there a router that allows real time and cumulative bandwidth monitoring?
if there is not, and i need to use tomato or similar, what router might be equivalent to the dir655?
if there is a router that offers this monitoring, does anyone have personal experience with it?
thank you for your consideration.
have a great day!
