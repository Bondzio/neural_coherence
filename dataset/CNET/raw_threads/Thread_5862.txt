8184	0	106750	1218371	NR	Tim Corbett	5/31/05 6:47 PM	1.11756522E12	D-Link 802.11g/2.4GHz Wireless Router	I'm currently using a D-Link 802.11g/2.4GHz Wireless Router to Link my modem to my computer system as well as my xbox gaming system to the internet. Currently I'm not using any wireless features, just the 4 wired ports on the back. Randomly the router disconnects and reconnects to the internet for no reason. This problem never happened while I was only using the modem. So I'm just wondering if anyone has any sujestions? Tim

First, completely disable the wireless side of it if you are not using wireless. That might stabilize it if it is not &quot;responding&quot; to stray radio interference from microwave ovens and cordless phones. If it still is unstable, you'll have to call D-Link and see if they'll replace it. dw

From other sources, I understand that the latest firmware version, 1.11, released just recently on May 17, resolves the disconnect issue for those who are having it. You can download it from this D-Link support page: http://support.dlink.com/products/view.asp?productid=DI%2D524 (And, as an object lesson for all, this is an example of why Bob always reminds us that the firmware version should be checked on brand new routers. Even if the router was bought just yesterday, it is unlikely that you got one that was manufactured within the last 2 weeks. But the firmware update released just 2 weeks ago is needed to make it work properly.) HTH, dw
