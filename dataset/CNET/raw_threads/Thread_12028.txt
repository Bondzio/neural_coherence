If I try to browse the XP computer, it prompts for a user name and password but won't log me in even when I try to log in as Administrator. I can, however, get to the windows 2000 computers from my XP one. Have any of you ever ran into a problem similar to this? Thanks, Chris

I not a 100% sure if this will correct the issues with 2k machines accessing it
