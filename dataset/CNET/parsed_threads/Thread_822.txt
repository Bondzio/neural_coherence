<s> I just bought the Buffalo Linkstation Live, and have it installed with my 2wire router/modem combo. </s>
<s> When I copy a bunch of files to it, Windows tells me that I am writing at about 1 MB/sec (capital B). </s>
<s> This isn't too bad, and the read speed seems to be very good, but my friend has a Western Digital NAS that is doing 35 MB/sec. </s>
<s> Anybody know where I should poke around to improve read/write speed? </s>
<s> I'm connecting to it wirelessly, but so was he.. </s>
<s> Thanks a ton, Brian </s>
<s> You need to check connection speeds but all the numbers you shared are possible. </s>
<s> The 1MB speed was common in 802.11b days. </s>
<s> I tested it with an ethernet cable, and it writes at over 5 MB/sec, which makes me think that part of it is simply because wifi is slower, but I also think that my router is slowing things down. </s>
<s> Still, it works well. </s>
<s> Thanks, Brian </s>
