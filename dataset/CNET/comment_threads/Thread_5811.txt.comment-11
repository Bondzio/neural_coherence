Find what Amperes you will be putting on each &quot;RAIL&quot;.
It does not have to be exact but it should the numbers &quot;under load.&quot; Now double that and add up the resulting Watts.
For a long life PC you'll want rails that you never exceed 50% of the Amperes for each rail and for total Watts you don't want to exceed 50% of the total Watts the PSU is rated for.
If you're read power supply shootouts like http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/stress-test,1073.html and others you learn that those ratings are usually optimistic and after a year or two are not to be believed as the part ages and loses capacity.
Sure you can go higher on the 50% mark and many use the 75 or 80% of the rating but it's your design.
Make it a good one.
