<s> Hi, I have a desktop (costom built) and I was just wondering if I should get an ssd? </s>
<s> Is it worth it to replace my 7200rpm 2tb hard drive with an ssd or should I just stick with the hard drive I have??? </s>
<s> Specs: 2tb7200rpm hdd, 12gb ram, gtx 650ti(2gb), win7(64bit), and an intel core i7 2700k </s>
<s> The immediate effect of having a ssd is speed. </s>
<s> The response is going to be noticed. </s>
<s> There is however the negative effect over time that usage causes some degradation due to the nature of data storage as R/W wear isn't so easily gotten rid of. </s>
<s> This all depends on the maker's quality of product and how they deal with it. </s>
<s> It shouldn't be that different from one maker to another but cheaper models aren't going last long. </s>
<s> take what you want from this but overall your 2tb is already providing use that at about the best traditional HD offer. </s>
<s> It's best advantage is they are cheaper for the amount of storage media provided compared to ssd. </s>
<s> Since, you already have the 2tb, use it then you can add a ssd later as time passes. </s>
<s> You may want to make the ssd the boot drive for quick boots. </s>
<s> You may want to look at &quot;hyreid drives&quot;. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I'll give the nod to &quot;drive accelerators.&quot; I'll stop here and add that on the laptops we are using the hybrid drives since we want the boost without the restrictions. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> In fairness to Willy, I'd agree that speed is the main advantge of SSD drives - access times are a tenth of the best of traditional HDD's, but the other big advantage is that of heat - specificlly, lack of it. </s>
<s> Another one is the relatively small current needed to run an SSD drive; five years ago I built a webserver with five SATA2 drives, one carried the OS and programs/drivers etc., and the other four were storage drives. </s>
<s> When fully booted, that rig was marginal on a 550-watt PSU with 2xOpteron 275's and a watercooling system on the chip, CPU's and GPU. </s>
<s> My main server now runs two 500Gb SSD's, one x6 Phenom with NO secondary drives and just two 120mm fans. </s>
<s> Three cloud providers host over seven hundred gig of data on the web, and even doing it that way, it's still 30% faster than the big bomber I started with. </s>
<s> As far as longevity is concerned, well I can't really comment; all data on the server is backed up to &quot;conventional&quot; HDD's on the old server, which only lights itself up when changes are made. </s>
<s> All in all, the SSD setup has saved me over &#163;200 a month, so it's already paid for itself. </s>
<s> that came with my system and moved it to a second bay. </s>
<s> It was when my system was new and after I installed the apps I needed and then I cloned it. </s>
<s> I moved the SSD to bay 1 and the HD to bay 2. </s>
