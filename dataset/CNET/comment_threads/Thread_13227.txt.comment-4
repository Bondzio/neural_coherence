The emachine T6212 comes with a 300W power supply.
The ATI x800xl is a fine card.
SeaninWA in this theard installed a x899xl and didn't mention upgrading the PS: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html?forumID=68&threadID=104179&messageID=1194079 Someone else in that thread, rickgut2004, installed a 450W power supply with his T6212.
If you have problems, then of course increase the PS.
