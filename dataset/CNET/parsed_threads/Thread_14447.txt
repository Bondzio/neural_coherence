<s> Hi, I bought a western digital passport external hard drive(60 GB). </s>
<s> I was told i have to reformatt it. </s>
<s> I have windows XP with service pack one.How do I reformatt it? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> My WD Passport is still in the box. </s>
<s> My boyfriend got the same external hardrive and when he istalled it, it only took 4 gigs. </s>
<s> He needed to get someone over to reformatt it to be able to work with his machine. </s>
<s> My machine has 160G.So i am jumping ahead in case I too will have to reformatt. </s>
<s> If it is easy, i will attempt it myself,if not I will have someone come over. </s>
<s> I was hoping you just plug it into the usb and go. </s>
<s> Maybe that is the case. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Plug the HDD into AC power... Connect USB cable to HDD ONLY Turn on HDD Turn on PC and get it up and running. </s>
<s> Now plug in the USB cable into the PC. </s>
<s> The PC should acknowledge that the drive was plugged in. </s>
<s> Once the system recognizes the HDD.. - Go to Start - Got to Settings - Go to Control Panel - Go to Adminstrative Tools - Go to Computer Management - Go to Disk Management - Look for a drive in the right windows with &quot;Unallocated Space&quot; - Select the drive with the &quot;Unallocated Space&quot;. </s>
<s> - From there you'll need to create a partition (logical or primnary) on the new drive using all the space - Once the partition is created (disk space allocated) then you can format it...thereafter it's ready for use. </s>
<s> - Just make sure sure you've identified the new NEW DRIVE before partitioning or formatting. </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>

<s> Thanks for replying. </s>
<s> Before all that I was having other problems anyway so I had the computer tech guy come over and install the second hardrive and other technical stuff. </s>
<s> (I didn't want to mess anything up further). </s>
<s> I appreciate having the forum though for help!Thanks again! </s>
