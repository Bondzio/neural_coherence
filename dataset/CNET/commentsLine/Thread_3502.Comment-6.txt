looked around notebookforums.com and it cannot be upgraded.
yes, it can be replaced but unless fujitsu er some other company make a special gpu to fit that then no.
suggestion - overclock ur gpu.
it will automatically be underclocked to conserve power.
use ati tool.
but make sure it doesn't overheat or artifacr.
