i had to install a new hard-drive on my pentium 4 dell 8100 series computer.
win-me operating-explorer 6.0. maxter hard-drive 180 gig.
i installed the drive, used the disk sent by the manufacturer to format the drive for operating system install.
i installed win_me then started to install my accessories, usb printer,usb- scanner, and didgital camera usb.
everything was fine up to this point.
when i installed my dsl modem( with disk from manufacturer) i was asked to restart system to enable device.
i did, and now all i can get on start_up is two new hardware found messages.
one for an unknown item the other for a pci controller.
i even contacted the vendors for each of my devices and under their instructions removed and reinstalled each item with a new restart each time but the new hardware boxes still pop up at each restart.
if you let windows search for the best driver, none is found.
i removed all add-on items, printer, camera, scanner, modem, etc., did a clean boot and the messages still appear at each restart.
each vendor for my add-on items say their product has nothing to do with either new found hardware message.
help!
!
