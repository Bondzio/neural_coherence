i need some ideas, i've built a new system with an msi 945 neo5-f mobo, pentium d 820 processor, 4g of kingston pc5300 ram, 2 wd 160g sata hd, nvidia 8600gt and a new 500wt power supply.
when i try to boot up and load the operating system it shuts it down when i try to save the bios settings.
all the components listed except the processor and video card are new.
the only thing i did in the bios was to change the boot order.
is this mobo defective?
any ideas would be welcome.
