The problem with OEM type systems is you're &quot;dead-end&quot; path to better options or upgrades or very limited.
Review your manual and find out if and what upgrades are available or visit the Dell support website.
I provide Celeron D link as Dell model 3000 also was sold as such.
The Intel info is here: http://www.intel.com/products/processor_number/chart/celeron_d.htm http://www.intel.com/products/processor/pentium4/index.htm If that class of cpu(find yours) then see if adding a higher Ghz rating is possible.
The cpu itself will drop-in and should be seen automatically and be reset as so.
HOWEVER, that's not always a given with OEM type systems and you may need to reset the bios to accept the new cpu.
As for duo-mode cpu, NOPE.
You have a different class of cpu, though don't take my word for it, recheck the specs.
