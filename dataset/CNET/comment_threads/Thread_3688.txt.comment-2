is a USB connected modem, then you may want to change to the combo if it offers an ethernet interface rather then trying to add a stand only router .
The built in router if a &quot;G&quot; type will run at close to 54mbps.
Add a wireless &quot;B&quot; device and the speeds drop to 11mbps.
Not having to run CAT5 cable is the main advantage in going 802.11x.
&quot;Is there any performance difference between a wireless cable modem and a standard cable modem with wireless router.&quot; I would think not.
