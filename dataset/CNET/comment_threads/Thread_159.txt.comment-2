To disable on-board devices you need to be into the BIOS setup, not Windows in safe or any other mode.
To get into the BIOS you usually hold down the DEL key as soon as you power-on, and keep it pressed until the blue BIOS setup screen appears.
If DEL doesn't do it, try F1 or some other F key.
When in the BIOS category page, highlight &quot;Integrated Peripherals&quot; then press Enter to open that page.
You should see an entry for 'on-board video' - press 'Page Up' or 'Page Down' key till it says 'Disabled'.
Press 'Esc' key to get back to main category page - then press F10 (usually) to save and exit.
If you get a prompt &quot;Save and Exit (Y/N)?&quot;, be sure to press the 'Y'then press ENTER.
PC will re-boot.
You may have to remove and re-install drivers for new card AFTER making sure that integrated video driver is uninstalled from device manager first.
