1.1.1	I am using a Belkin Wireless Router .	St
1.1.2	The home PC is on a workgroup and has a wired connection to the router .	St
1.1.3	The work laptop is on a domain .	St
1.1.4	I am able to access the internet wireless fine from my laptop .	St
1.1.5	IP addresses are as follows : Wireless router : 192.168.2.1 Home PC : 192.168.2.2 Laptop : 192.168.2.3 Both the home PC and laptop can ping the router but they ca n't ping each other .	St
1.1.6	I do n't know why this is happening .	St
1.1.7	1 reason I have in my mind is that the laptop connects to the wireless connection created by the router .	St
1.1.8	But the Home PC does not connect to this connection .	St
1.1.9	Still my friend said that they should be able to ping each other as they are in the same subnet .	St
1.1.10	Please help .	St
1.1.11	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	Sadly there are many reasons for ping to fail .	St
1.2.2	We have firewalls ( even in the router ) , the OS settings and a feature that has MANY NAMES .	St
1.2.3	I 'll give it one and leave it to you to find what your router calls it .	St
1.2.4	The name is CLIENT ISOLATION .	St
1.2.5	I decline to write down the other hundred names I 've seen this by .	St
1.2.6	But what is DIFFERENT about your post is & quot ; The work laptop is on a domain. & quot ; This can mean that it 's on a VPN and it would be absolutely proper to not be able to ping machines that are not on the DOMAIN .	St
1.2.7	Your IT staffer should explain this but it is proper .	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
