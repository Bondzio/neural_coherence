1.1.1	I am about to purchase a new computer proably the CyberPOWER GAMER ULTRA SLI PRO.	St
1.1.2	The system comes configured with 2 NEW!!!	St
1.1.3	NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS 320MB 16X PCI Express graphics cards (Major Brand Powered by NVIDIA) and a STANDARD CASE POWER SUPPLY.	St
1.1.4	However a 500W Power Supply is recommended for using dual 7900 and X1950 or above video cards.	St
1.1.5	Should I stay with the STANDARD CASE POWER SUPPLY or should I upgrade to 500W [for +$49], 600W [+79], or even a 700W (quad SLI ready) [+146]?	St
1.1.6	I have more of the specs right here: - Free!	St

St
1.1.8	Thank-you	St
1.2.1	I like having the extra 100 Watts because the electrolytic capacitors degrade pretty fast in the first 2 years.	St
1.2.2	It's a cheap thing to add the extra 100 Watt capability and saves headaches later.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	there's more than 1 AM2 4400.	St
1.3.2	And for a few more bucks, you can get a 4800 (2.5GHz) http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103778 VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	I'm getting a (Socket AM2) AMD Athlon64 X2 4400+ Dual-Core CPU w/ HyperTransport Technology and I do not plan on upgrading CPU.	St
1.5.1	If you had a power supply JUST BIG ENOUGH, it would have an issue in about a year.	St
1.5.2	That's why we move up the the next size.	Sug
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	As previously indicated .... AMD has many CPUs...case in point THERE ARE TWO AM2 X2 4400s ... which ONE comes with your system ?	Ques
1.6.2	The 89W or 65W CPU ?	Ques
1.6.3	Or the 65nm or 90nm technology ?	Ques
1.6.4	2200Mhz or 2300Mhz ?	Ques
1.6.5	2MB Cache or 1MB cache ?	Ques
1.6.6	http://www.amdcompare.com/us-en/desktop/SideBySide.aspx?opn=ADO5000IAA6CZ&opn=ADO4800IAA5DD&opn=ADO4400IAA5DD&opn=ADA4400IAA6CS The other point is you should ask to find out how much more for a 4800 or 5000.	St
1.6.7	It's often the case you can upgrade to a faster CPU for only a few bucks more than the one you're buying.	St
1.6.8	Can't figure why you're putting such a low-end CPU in an otherwise high-end system ?	Ques
1.6.9	VAPCMD	St
1.7.1	I am getting the (Socket AM2) AMD Athlon64 X2 4400+ Dual-Core CPU w/ HyperTransport Technology.	St
1.7.2	You can see more specs @ http://www.cyberpowerpc.com/spec/getspec.asp?n=CPU&v=%28Socket%20AM2%29%20AMD%20Athlon%u212264%20X2%204400%2b%20Dual-Core%20CPU%20w/%20HyperTransport%20Technology .	St
1.7.3	No I am not changing my CPU.	St
1.7.4	I just need to know what power supply I should get.	St
1.8.1	you'd know exactly what is was you were getting (paying for) and that there were CPU options that better matched your system without spending much more.	St
1.8.2	But since you're not interested in knowing more or scoping out better options...I'll leave you to your power supply.	St
1.8.3	VAPCMD	St
