I just got a computer case to build a computer, and i need to decide which Motherboard i need.. Im looking for a not so expensive but good quality that has 2 PCIe x16 slots at least, and 2 or more PCI slots, 4 or more USB ports, and a socket 755 CPU connector thing. I was thinking a nVidia nForce 600 series, but i want to know if theres anything that is better, for the same, maybe a little more. Also, if its bundled with a CPU that would be great, but it isnt that important. Any suggestions?
