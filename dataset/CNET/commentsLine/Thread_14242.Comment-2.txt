im sorry, it says &quot;cannot find the operating system&quot;.
i just changed the hard drive, this one is used 10 gig ibm quantum.
not sure if it has operating system loaded or not but i would guess so.
i want to reformat and tried to put 2000 pro booting from cd and it went through process and in partition it said to quit.
