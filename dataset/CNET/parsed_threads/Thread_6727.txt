<s> Wondering on this. </s>
<s> My Dad says I need a laptop to take around and everything, like to show photos to family on trips, etc. </s>
<s> I know that would be nice and everything, but we don't travel a whole lot. </s>
<s> Maybe 5 times a year to go to Cincinati, since we live in Lexington Kentucky, and that's only for a day. </s>
<s> Then, maybe a large trip once every three years or so. </s>
<s> Now I'm also looking at the new iMac's which I'm really liking the look of. </s>
<s> They look AWESOME to me. </s>
<s> I really liked the new keyboard. </s>
<s> (Just tried it today) I would like to get the 20in or 24in in either way. </s>
<s> High or low one. </s>
<s> To watch movies on in my room and the shows I buy off itunes. </s>
<s> Thanks treemen </s>
<s> Why not use one of the image sharing companies out on the web for this? </s>
<s> Better yet, get the .mac service and use the new iPhoto and iWeb sharing options to build your own, online picture gallery. </s>
<s> You can pass word protect it and allow others to post their pics as well. </s>
<s> Download the new pod cast highlighting iLife 08 and its new features! </s>
<s> Credit to Kevin for originally posting this link over in SE... http://www.apple.com/ilife/guidedtour/ Also, a portable thumb drive allows you to take gigs of photos anywhere and display them on any computer available. </s>
<s> Laptops are nice but if all you need is a way of sharing photo's then there is no reason to get one. </s>

<s> Thanks alot. </s>
<s> I just had my first day of High School here and I'm in the IB program there. </s>
<s> Some real big program. </s>
<s> And from what my teachers said today, we'll have plenty of writing things to do. </s>
<s> So I'm trying to decide if a laptop would be better or not. </s>
<s> What ever I buy is going to last for about 3 years, until I get out of High School, so for now the iMac might be better, then a few years from now get the laptop. </s>
<s> I trying to think of a way to earn something like $200 a month, so buy the time I get out of High School and into summer I'll have enough money to buy my new Mac, or maybe even before then. </s>
<s> Thanks and keep the info coming. </s>

<s> Where can I get AutoCAD. </s>
<s> I'm starting an engineering class and would also use it for college after High School. </s>
<s> Thanks treemen </s>
<s> If you want autocad, you can go to the Autodesk - student site. </s>
<s> It will require a school based email address to register with the site. </s>
<s> Once you get registered you can down load a student version of autocad for free (last year they were giving a choice of the civil engineering or the electrical engineering versions... which both include the basic version). </s>
<s> One thing. </s>
<s> autocad only runs in a windows environment. </s>
<s> If you have a MS machine or if you have a mac-intel capable of booting up in windows you will be covered. </s>
<s> If you have a power pc mac then you are out of luck in running autocad. </s>
<s> I think I decided on the MB or MBP. </s>
<s> Don't know which one yet. </s>
<s> I'm leaning towards the MB, since I can hopefully buy the extra monitor, new camera, and speakers, etc, with the money I save. </s>
<s> So, say I went with the pro, I might not be able to get a new camera or monitor. </s>
<s> Don't know yet though. </s>
<s> And if I bought this to replace my PC, then should I go with the Pro over the MB. </s>
<s> Thanks treeman </s>
<s> I'm pretty good at using autocad, but not sure about the equipment requirements. </s>
<s> Since autocad is a vector line program... is a more powerful graphics card essential for its smooth running on a mac book booting to windows? </s>
<s> If it was a raster based image I would say you need the beefier video support the MBPro offers, but since it is a vector based image the program displays then is the processor power more important? </s>
<s> I will have to look this up. </s>
<s> Along these lines... has anyone here got an opinion about mac-cad ? </s>
<s> cheers grim </s>
<s> I went into a local electronics store and tried to type on the MacBook keyboard. </s>
<s> It wasn't pretty. </s>
<s> My hands are too large. </s>
<s> The MB Pro keyboard looks identical but I had a much better experience typing on it, fewer errors and overall just a better feel. </s>
<s> Before you decide on which computer to buy you should go to the store and demo all of them. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>

<s> Hey Guys .. </s>
<s> I have the same problem but worse !!! </s>
<s> I live in Egypt now and I'm going to Canada the next year and I even don't know if I'll use a laptop on my studies in the high school or not . </s>
<s> I Agree that the macbook Is a very good choice for a high school student . </s>
<s> But me for example .. </s>
<s> I like it but the 13 inch is too small and even If I bought the blach one and with a 2gb of memory I will have that 64 mb of graphics wich SUCK !!! </s>
<s> So as a student and homeworks or projects its good but as a gamer or musician It's bad and by the way I can bye a good DELL laptop with the same price and 15.4 inch monitor and GeForce 256mb of Graphics . </s>
<s> So I think there are lots of people or &quot;students&quot; having this issue. </s>
<s> right now I don't know what to do but I think if there is someone bought a macbook before , he can tell us about he's experiense .. Oh , one more question .. On the website of apply the say for example .. &quot;as low as 50 a month &quot; OK FOR HOW LONG ?!!! </s>
<s> I think that's all .. Bye , </s>
