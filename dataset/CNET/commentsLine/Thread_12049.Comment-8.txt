every time i decide it's not worth it, something about it suggests that it is really really close to working : just now i set up things to print, with the &quot;devices and printers&quot; window open, ready to plug in the printer.
next to the icon of the printer it said &quot;hp 2100 pcl6 : offline&quot; when i plugged in the usb end of the cable, that changed right away to &quot;hp 2100 pcl6 : ready&quot; so it's seeing the printer, but just not being cooperative.
(because when i tried a print, it changed to &quot;error&quot;).
and refused to print, of course.
okay.
last chance for inspirations, anyone ..... ?
