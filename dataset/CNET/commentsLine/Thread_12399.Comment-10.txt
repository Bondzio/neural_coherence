sorry, it's not the cost of the software i am worried about, i am just trying to make sure i have what i need.
you had mentioned above &quot;as to the software, you dont have to buy that.
it's only needed for playing blu ray discs.&quot; but i don't know why else i would want to install a bd drive if i wasn't going to play discs with it.
thanks for the replies!
