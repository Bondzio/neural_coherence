It's a Connexant K56V Data Fax modem. I am running Win XP SP2. It works goot until I install new software with hardware. After that every time I try to connect, I can hear the dialing tones from the modem, but nothing happens: it can not acces outside line ore another line - the line is like death. Can somebody help? Stefan
