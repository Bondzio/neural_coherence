Any comments would be appreciated.

The i3 also has graphics on the CPU. While I don't have personal experience with either of these as mine are different, I think you'd want to look at your personal needs. If you want to game, you want your own graphics card and not the i3. If you like to open multiple programs, you want more actual threads.

I won't detail what this CPU feature is but it is growing in importance to many. http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=46472 shows a solid yes to VTx and given the higher clock rate I could safely bet that for almost every use this would outperform the older q8300. But if you could get the old gear for cheap, it's still a great choice if the price is right. Bob
