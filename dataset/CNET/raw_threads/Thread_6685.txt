I have to look (search on the maker's site) for these three software or drivers. 1. The machines chipset driver package (many skip this.) 2. The wifi card drivers. 3. Any &quot;Helper&quot; app that turns on the wifi. For Dell it's called QuickSet. For Acer it could be eManage or eSomething from memory. Many forget item 1 or 3 and can't get it to turn on. Bob
