Motherboard chipset drivers? Latest Direct X? Give us your system spec's & let us know what you have installed & we will be glad to help. Good Luck

If you don't have a CD with drivers, you can download them from the website of the card's manufacturer. IE: If it's an ATI card, download drivers from the ATI website . If it's an nVidia card, download drivers from the [url=http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html]nVidia website[/url.
