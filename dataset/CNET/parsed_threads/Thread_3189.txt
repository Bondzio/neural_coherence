<s> I bought this video card: NVIDIA GeForce4 MX 420 for my computer to support all my pc games. </s>
<s> I have never had a problem until now. </s>
<s> When I installed Call of Duty 2, I got an error message that my video card did not support alpha blending, which was strange to me because I have two other Call of Duty games as well as many other pc games that never gave me a problem. </s>
<s> I looked at the NVIDIA web site to see about downloading an update, but I'm nervous about picking the correct one. </s>
<s> Can anybody tell me which download is the right one? </s>
<s> The Nvidia drivers are quite nice and won't install unless they work with your card and OS. </s>
<s> You can't go wrong. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Bob, I downloaded the driver and while the game can now be played, my regular display setting are distractingly massive. </s>
<s> How can I get my display (desktop picture, icon size and internet display, etc. </s>
<s> )to be the same size as before? </s>
<s> If I use system restore, will it take out the newly downloaded driver? </s>
<s> Is there another way to change the display? </s>
<s> Some of the page is so far off the screen that I can't even get to the arrow to move it across the page. </s>
<s> Sue </s>
<s> Remember that I'm going to take everyone as being familiar with how to change the desktop properties and set them to their favorite 800x600 or 1024x768 pixels or such. </s>
<s> Tell me which you used. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Found it: 1280 x 960 -- Thanks! </s>
