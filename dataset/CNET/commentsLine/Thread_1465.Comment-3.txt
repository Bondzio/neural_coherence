it seems that the os takes forever to load one program.
when i first built the system, it would let me run two or three different tasks at once with no problem.
now i have issues when i am trying to use internet explorer and media player at the same time.
i just get tired of reinstalling windows.
is there a reason that causes this slowdown, as i have defragged and optimized the page files and all already.
