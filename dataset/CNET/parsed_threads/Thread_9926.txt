<s> my XP home OS is truly messed up. </s>
<s> I want to uninstall it and reinstall it from scratch. </s>
<s> Or maybe even uninstall it and install XP pro instead. </s>
<s> How do I go about doing this? </s>
<s> (it is the OS that came with my computer. </s>
<s> IT is not an upgrade.) </s>
<s> Simply a matter of inserting the XP cd into the drive and restarting the computer. </s>
<s> If the Bios is set to boot primarily to the CDrom drive, you will get the options you are looking for. </s>
<s> I know I'm completely ignorant about this, but if I boot from the CD and choose to install XP, will it wipe out my old version, or will it partition my drive so that I have the old and the new? </s>
<s> I dont want a partition. </s>
<s> I just want one XP, and I dont want any remnant of the old version. </s>
<s> I did that. </s>
<s> Chose to install. </s>
<s> It asked what to install on: which partition There was one partition on my harddrive, and 8 mb of unpartitioned space. </s>
<s> I chose to install on the partition, (where my old OS is) and it said they dont reccomend it, the OS wont work right. </s>
<s> I dont want the old OS at all. </s>
<s> I want to DELETE IT! </s>
<s> How do I delete xp? </s>
<s> Anyone? </s>
<s> is it possible? </s>
<s> 3 forums, I suggest you concentrate on one. </s>
<s> R.Proffitt provides one of the most experienced viewpoints available. </s>
<s> Deciphering his somewhat unique style of writing challenges your problem solving abilities, but does lead to increased skills on your part if you want them. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> It always says that and then you get to the format screen. </s>
<s> format and then it will install new xp, or you can delete all partitions and start out raw and then the next step will format. </s>
<s> Just follow the steps but,ignore the part about installing on same partition. </s>
<s> It won't! </s>
