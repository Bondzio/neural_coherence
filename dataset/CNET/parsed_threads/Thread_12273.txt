<s> I have an old computer that I occasionally use and today I found that the CMOS battery is now dead. </s>
<s> I opened the case and thought I'd find a small 3 volt battery that's common to so many motherboards but I didn't find that. </s>
<s> I'm very sure that the motherboard is a Shuttle Hot 541. </s>
<s> But when I checked the internet for info on where the battery is and how to replace it, I found nothing. </s>
<s> Here is a photo of the board http://mail.lipsia.de/~enigma/neu/pics/mainboard_i430fx66.jpg I'd appreciate any help in changing it out. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> You can google for datasheets but the ds1287a device has a battery in it. </s>
<s> These should be good for over 10 years. </s>
<s> That board looks familiar. </s>
<s> You might see a sticker with make and model on one of the slot connectors. </s>

<s> I actually found this page earlier this afternoon, but I wasn't sure about that post until I read the one from Bob. </s>
<s> Putting them together helped clear it up. </s>
<s> I did find the datasheet and I looked on the internet for Dallas Semiconductor. </s>
<s> I checked their website for this product and it came up with no hits, because it looks like the ds12887a is a replacement for the ds1287a. </s>
<s> I Googled it and got a number of hits. </s>
<s> Since I've never bought anything like this before I'm a little unsure of where to go. </s>
<s> One of the hits was Amazon and there were several different prices. </s>
<s> I'll speak to a person I work with, but if you have a place that you'd recommend I'll check it out. </s>
<s> This seemed so much easier when I thought I'd be changing a 3 volt battery. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> This device was put out because there was pressure to reduce parts and costs in those models of the PC. </s>
<s> Folk back then were getting upset about yearly battery replacements and back then some makers were using proprietary battery packs or making it non-user serviceable. </s>
<s> So Dallas Semiconductor saw an opening for a RTC that included it's own battery and could work without external power for over 10 years. </s>
<s> In those models there is no battery to replace. </s>
<s> It's a shame the make/model and documentation on this board is not supplied as I may be able to check if there is a way to add a battery. </s>
<s> Are you sure this board works? </s>
<s> It's way past it's shelf life and socket 7 boards were twitchy even back then. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> very well until yesterday when I noticed the time on the clock was wrong and then I saw that the computer no longer knew it had an A drive. </s>
<s> I figured this was a symptom of the CMOS battery going bad. </s>
<s> On my newer computer when the CMOS battery went bad I noticed the computer did some odd things, but they went away once the battery was changed. </s>
<s> This old computer is 17 years old, but it doesn't get used very often which is likely why it's lasted so long. </s>
<s> I wish I had more detailed documentation on the motherboard. </s>
<s> I dug up the receipt that listed all the parts that went into the computer, but didn't see anything which would give more details. </s>
<s> Although in my searching yesterday I found this diagram which appears to match my system http://stason.org/TULARC/pc/motherboards/S/SHUTTLE-COMPUTER-INTERNATIONAL-INC-Pentium-HOT-541.html#.UauUAthwe6E I want to make sure I understand, I should be able to buy an RTC and replace it on my own and hopefully fix all of this? </s>
<s> These boards have been out of production for a very long time. </s>
<s> In fact, in a move to reduce costs that part is usually soldered in. </s>
<s> I can't answer if you will find the part and have the tools and skills to replace it. </s>
<s> If there is a chance, close JP11 and then remove JP11's jumper. </s>
<s> Maybe it will reset and work for a bit longer. </s>
<s> I don't see the old option of another battery to stand in. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> at it and tried pulling on the RTC, it didn't seem to budge, so it probably is soldered in. </s>
<s> As for the JP11, I thought I located it, but the item I was looking at seems to be soldered to the board too. </s>
<s> I noticed on the board were some other things with JP's so I looked for JP11 on the board. </s>
<s> I saw that printed next to the RTC and the BIOS chip. </s>
<s> The item next to the print &quot;JP11&quot; is two pieces of metal pointing straight up. </s>
<s> I know that's not the right technical jargon but it's the best I can do. </s>
<s> I'm not sure what I can or can't do from this point on. </s>
<s> It is odd that last night when I was looking for the RTC to check on prices, I got the idea that anyone could buy one and replace it like it was RAM or something else, but I guess that's not true. </s>
<s> I get the feeling this maybe too much for you. </s>
<s> You can try and all that, but according to your answers it will be rather new experience. </s>
<s> You're getting to do techie type stuff for the real fix, though it maybe simple techie fix. </s>
<s> I mention that as anything you may try could cause further issues or problems. </s>
<s> i will part with a possible fix, provided you can do it and if you really want that PC to work again. </s>
<s> Understand, if there is any data on that old PC you want you can swap the HD into an adapter or ext. </s>
<s> USB case to retrieve data. </s>
<s> If on the other hand, that PC is specific to some task, then maybe my fix will do. </s>
<s> You need to be absolutely sure of the specs of that DS12887A chip. </s>
<s> From two(2) legs that are part of it will be the +/- voltage outputs. </s>
<s> There you solder on some small wire leads, to be +/- then attach to battery harness or cradle. </s>
<s> You now have fresh batteries and apparatus to exchange those when dead. </s>
<s> Otherwise, you would need a new DS12887A replacement chip for old one. </s>
<s> Yours is probably soldered-in and thus you need to unsolder and place a IC socket in its place. </s>
<s> Then mount new chip ordinated properly and set it up as usual. </s>
<s> As you can see it gets complicated if your talents don't match the task. </s>
<s> Some techs may simply solder an IC socket over the old DS12887A, making sure of no shorts and mount the new chip on top or battery setup. </s>
<s> -OR- Looking at the spec sheet I see pin 24 is Vcc(voltage +) and pin 12 is ground(-) this is where I attach +/- wires if done that way. </s>
<s> The battery setup is supplying ext. </s>
<s> power directly to the chip as the old int. </s>
<s> RTC one is weak or dead. </s>
<s> The spec sheet Vbat reference is for the int. </s>
<s> RTC battery. </s>
<s> *NOTE* anyone can correct me if i got the pins wrong here. </s>

<s> to replace old one. </s>
<s> Your old setup is at least 10yrs. </s>
<s> old and not much can be had from it unless you deem otherwise. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> It's not to be removed but a jumper block placed over it, the machine powered up, then down then remove the jumper block then power up and set the CMOS settings and hope they hold. </s>
<s> These models were built for a purpose to avoid adding what folk were gripping about back then and had a 10 or so built in life span. </s>
<s> As I noted, the socket was unusual to find because that's added cost so again, not much for me to add here. </s>
<s> Your replies tell me that you must have inherited or found this old gear. </s>
<s> I'm sure there are socket 7 boards for sale out there. </s>
<s> But more current machines are under 99 bucks now so it's rare to see anyone try to save such an old PC. </s>
