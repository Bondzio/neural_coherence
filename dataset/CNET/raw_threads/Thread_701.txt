I'm afraid my tech skills have diminished quite a bit over the last few years. Never had the time to keep up with the exploding tech. Deciding between two. AMD Phenom II X6 1055T 2.8GHz Processor 64 bit Six-Core 8GB AMD Radeon HD 6670 1GB Intel Core i5-2320 3.0GHz Processor 64 bit Quad-Core 8GB AMD Radeon HD 6770 1GB I'm leaning toward the second one, I believe i can actually upgrade RAM on this one, but I'm confused on the &quot;core&quot; amount. Four vs. Six? Meaningful? Necessary? Any help or thoughts would be great. Thanks in advance!!
