i think it's the motherboard.
on a cardboard box with nothing but the psu/cpu/mem/cpu fan it clicks still.
usually when i take out the the cpu it would turn off.. it doesn't .. doesn't when i put it in either.
i wiggle in around with a crapload of pressure and it turns off.. so i'm thinking mobo issue.
the pins on the cpu are absolutely straight, i just got the cpu in the mail today.
