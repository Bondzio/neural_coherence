I have a Lenovo Desktop (Model - lenovo 3000 Q series 8822 11Q).
It has a 300 Watts SMPS(PSU).
I'm planning to upgrade to a 400 Watts SMPS.
But, there's a problem.
My Lenovo SMPS has a 2-pin Power slot for the Lenovo LCD-TFT Monitor.
Does all SMPS have that slot ?
Or else then what should i do now?
