that is what i fear.
luckly i backed up about 80% of the data on an external hard drive about 7 months ago.
of course, it was a one time thing so everything for the last 7 months has not been backed up.
what is an external raid capable nas?
is it worth giving this option a shot?
if so, what are my options?
any particular brand/model that is reasonably priced.
