in fact, i was using an older version of sd.
boy!
did i feel stupid!
i discovered my error as i was composing my email to shirt pocket, so i told them what i was using and asked if that might be the explanation for my problems.
the response to that part of my email was &quot;no&quot;.
i'm going to have to take their word for it.
it's looking like wd is abandoning making drives that will boot power pc macs.
