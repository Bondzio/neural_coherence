OK, here is a list I was able to compile.
Does it matter if I upgrade to Athlon and not Sempron?
AMD Athlon 64 3800+ 2.40GHz Processor $30 AMD Athlon 64 4000+ 2.6GHz 512KB L2 Cache Socket AM2 62W Single-Core Processor AMD Athlon LE-1600 (ADH1600DHBOX) 2.2GHz AMD Athlon LE-1620 (ADH1620DHBOX) 2.4GHz $53 AMD Sempron LE-1300 (SDH1300DPBOX)2.3GHz $39 AMD Sempron LE-1250 (SDH1250DPBOX)2.2GHZ $29 AMD Athlon LE-1640 (ADH1640DPBOX) 2.6GHz $38 I think these are all 939 sockets but they also call them AMD2 sockets?
I hope you all have some answers for me.
Thanks, Ken
