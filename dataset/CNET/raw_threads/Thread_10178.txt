Find a website that will add up all the power for each part of the system to find out how much total &quot;continuous&quot; (not just max) power you will need. Thermal take has a great power calculator.

You want a mid tower or full tower. Gpu? Look here. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html Go as high up the list as your wallet will allow. Psu? Quality single rail unit. Watts? That will depend on what gpu you pick since you have already picked a 125w cpu.

Also didn't see a CD-DVD Burner/Drive....another must for me. Perhaps most important....I'd be looking at other MBs.....like the GA-970A-D3P it stipulates support for the CPU you listed and rates way better based on buyer feedback. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=13-128-627&SortField=0&SummaryType=0&Pagesize=50&PurchaseMark=&SelectedRating=-1&VideoOnlyMark=False&VendorMark=&IsFeedbackTab=true&Keywords=%28keywords%29&Page=1#scrollFullInfo VAPCMD

This changed and now that many hook up with HDMI (with sound over HDMI) the sound card is just another item that could create problems for the new PC builder. Let me be very bad here and write that very few can install Windows properly and then they complain about lockups and more. WHICH IS WHY I like simpler machines for the beginner. The sound card is not going to add value here. I see you didn't pick a video card so please pick from THE LIST . -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html You don't have to go too far up the list for great game play.
