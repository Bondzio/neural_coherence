Now, I am unable to boot to desktop(again) but I do not want to erase my pictures and videos in order to do a restart/recovery as had done before.. How do I retrieve my info if the computer will not boot? If I remove the hard drive, can I take it somewhere to retrieve the pictures? I just purchased a &quot;My Book&quot; external Hard Drive and did not get to use it because of my OS X problem. I have an E-machine with windows XP, and a HP with windows 2000, but they won't be of any help? I also tried everything suggested in &quot;the Missing Manual&quot;. I had this problem before and Apple had us erase all of our stuff. It was okay then because I did not have my pictures and videos. I also have a lot of music I would like to keep. The pictures are the most important. No backup of any kind was done because we had just recently added the pictures and videos. Thanks, Sue PS:I still consider myself a computer newbie especially with the Mac.

I find our work laptops start to have severe issues after year 2. Bob

Does it chime? Does the screen light up? Do you see the Grey Apple and spinning spokes? A folder icon with a question mark? Does any happen at all? If the iMac starts from the Recovery CD/DVD, it is a good indication that most of the internal stuff is working as designed. The next thing is to find out if the Hard Drive is still functioning. If it is, then you have a good chance of recovering all your data. If it is not, then I'm afraid your data will only be recoverable using a professional data recovery service. If the iMac booted from the CD/DVD, use the Disk Utility from the Menu Bar and see if it recognizes the Hard Drive. If it does, run First Aid on it to see if it is damaged in any way. If it appears OK, quit Disk Utility. Start the install process BUT choose ARCHIVE and INSTALL as the installation method. Choose ONLY the Archive and Install option. You will find it under Options at the first or second screen of the installer. This will lay down a new System folder, but will preserve all your data. Once the recovery is complete, and the machine restarts, all your data will be where you left it. Now make the backup of all your data! I will not beat the drum about regular backups, I guess you have already become a convert to that regime. Daily backups are not too often. All the above relies on the HD being functional. Pass on more information and we'll go from there Good Luck P

However, when the disc install. is in, the computer chimes, the apple and spinning wheel are there and it goes to the install screen. This is the only way I can do anything. I went to disc utility, did the first aid and it says disc is OK. I even tried to use the archive and install option, but the computer froze. When I tried it again, the archive option was no longer available, only install for first time or erase and install. When in disc utility, I went to the &quot;restore&quot; option...Once in there I went to screen and was able to find my photos, but was unable to click on any of them. They were not in bold print, but they are still there. How can I get them?

If the A & I option was there first, but has since disappeared, it is a reasonable sign that the drive is defective. The flashing question mark means that the system cannot find a viable system folder from which to boot the machine. The &quot;Restore&quot; function in Disk Utility does not do what it sounds like it would do. It is for restoring a disk from a disk image, which you do not have, and will do nothing for you. You would be well advised to leave the disk alone and contact a data recovery service. They are not cheap. Only you can make the determination as to whether your data is worth the price that they charge. Google for &quot;Data Recovery&quot; and you will find lots of hits. You don't have to specify Mac or Windows, they do any platform. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but when a drive appears and disappears, it is not a good sign. P
