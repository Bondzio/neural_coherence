<s> Hi guys, I have an eMachines T6212, with 512mb dual channel ddr sdram from factory. </s>
<s> it has 4 slots total, and 512 is made up of two samsung 256mb pc3200 CL3 ddr memory. </s>
<s> i just bought an Ultra 512MB DDR 400MHz CL3 memory which should get me 1gb memory total, but my computer is only showing 768mb memory. </s>
<s> can anyone help? </s>
<s> Some machines do stop there or have onboard graphics that steal ram. </s>
<s> Try http://www.crucial.com to see if you are in the zone of supported memory configurations. </s>

<s> since i installed only 1 stick, could that be causing this problem? </s>
<s> i have a video card installed, so my on-board video is disabled. </s>
<s> I won't. </s>
<s> But about the onboard &quot;disabled.&quot; That's not always true. </s>
<s> Some machines steal the memory in spite of that. </s>
<s> Here's what I do for the machines I can do this for. </s>
<s> I get into the bios and reduce the video memory to it's lowest value. </s>
<s> This gets us to the best place we can be. </s>

<s> you likely defeated the dual channel mode and is reportinga single channel amount and leaving out the other 256. </s>
<s> so, are you basically saying that i need another one of those exact same stick to make it work together? </s>
<s> i'm sorry, i'm not very knowledgeable on this stuff. </s>
<s> i had that problem before.. the module said 512Mb but after installing it.. the bios only stated 512Mb(i had 1 256 Mb module already installed).. i used another one but still with 512Mb.. then i got 768.. in that case.. the former had some problems.. try changing the module to another one.. the &quot;512Mb&quot; i had when i installed it alone was only 256Mb.. dunno why.. i hope i am of some help.. </s>
<s> Proprietary systems, other than they make very little effort to make useful info about their systems available.. </s>
