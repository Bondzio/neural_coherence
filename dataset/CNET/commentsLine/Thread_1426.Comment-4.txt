thanks... i am not an it person and just wanted to check they won't take me for a ride and make me buy lots of extra stuff... so if i provide the sales reps with laptops, smartphones, printers and some voip telephony (something somebody told me but which i am not too sure about) and have a server and a router at the main office i should be fine right?...
thanks so much for making it clearer..cheers
