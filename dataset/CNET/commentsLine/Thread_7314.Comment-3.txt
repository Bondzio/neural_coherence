dual channel memory architecture, your system can only reach max performance with dimms of equal capacity in pairs in the same channel.
bottom line, you can use one 512 dimm vice two 256 dimms but doing so sacrifices performance.
the other thing is get all the ram you intend to use on your system upfront... then later you won't face the problem of removing low density ram to add higher density ram or finding ram the works reliably with the old ram.
