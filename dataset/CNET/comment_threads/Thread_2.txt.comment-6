Thank You Bob, I have read the Reply 17, which redirects me to the following site: http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/965 I am quite confused on what to do, I have had this router for over 2 years and I have usually been able to access its management.
I had to reinstall Windows XP, and I have been unable to reinstall the routers software (which I am told is not too helpful).
As mentioned earlier, I have set up a static IP address, and I am trying to forward this port to my Xbox 360.
I'm sorry if I am repeating myself, but I have no idea where to go.
I am unable to manage anything related to the router, and therefore, I don't think I can follow the instructions on the website (which asks me to change the IP address of my router, which I am unable to do).
I feel as I am making a mountain out of a molehill.
Thank you for help and patience
