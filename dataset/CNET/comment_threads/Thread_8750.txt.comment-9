Most often what I see is ....a mfg like PB build a system using a MB from a company like GigaByte but often it's not a production MB....it's made specially for PB, HP or Gateway, etc., But in this case it appears that PB is using a retail production GigaByte MB and that you could use the GigaByte BIOS vs the PB BIOS.
There's risk that it might not work or fail however if it works ...it could permit a higher performance Prescott CPU.
The other option is buy new and at today's prices...that's an attractive option.
VAPCMD PS...You would have to get a more robust HS Fan for the Prescott CPU.
Without advertising .. Intel makes HS Fans to match the CPU so they're beefier for the higher end units.
