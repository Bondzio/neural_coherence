<s> I would like to buy a mobile broadband modem from Verizon, AT&T, or Sprint for internet access in my home. </s>
<s> I currently have a desktop and wireless router that I use to network a laptop to the desktop and several printers. </s>
<s> Is it possible to plug a USB mobile broadband card into a wireless router for a home network? </s>
<s> I've heard Linksys has a product that does that but I have had problems making Linksys networks work- is there another source? </s>
<s> Many thanks- Bob S. </s>
<s> Even Windows, PCs and everything had &quot;problems&quot; so with that dismissed, look at the routers at 3gstore.com and call them to chat about it. </s>
