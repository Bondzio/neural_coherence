<s> I have taken a hard drive out of my laptop and connected to cable which had a usb plug. </s>
<s> I have connected it to a desktop and it tells me it has discovered new hardware but it does not show up in my computer as a drive. </s>
<s> When I unplug the cable it shows up as a drive but disappears immediately. </s>
<s> What is up with this and how can I tell if there is anything on this drive to retrieve? </s>
<s> What does Disk Management tell you about the drive? </s>
<s> To turn up into My Computer it needs to have a NTFS or FAT32 formatted partition. </s>
<s> Does it? </s>

<s> What drive? </s>
<s> What adapter? </s>
<s> Which USB port? </s>
<s> (front, rear) Where in Windows did you look? </s>
<s> (device manager?) </s>
<s> And why did you do this? </s>

<s> I have a similar problem with the seagate drive showing n evice manager but not in disc management. </s>
<s> any help greatfully received. </s>
<s> Robin </s>
<s> That makes Bob and me ask the same questions. </s>
<s> Waiting for your answers. </s>
<s> Also, is it a seagate drive coming from your laptop? </s>
<s> Or is the history of this drive different? </s>
<s> Then it's not a similar problem, but a different problem. </s>
