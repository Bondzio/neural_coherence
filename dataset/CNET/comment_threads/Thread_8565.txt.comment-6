The PSU is good enough because m-ATX boards don't consume a lot of power.
SATA 150 is definately supported but you may be thinking of sata 300.
That I don't know, maybe not.
Everything seems to be compatable except maybe the video card and chipset.
Now I maybe wrong, but I don't know if mixing ATI nvidia is ok. Also, your card is a two slotter.
