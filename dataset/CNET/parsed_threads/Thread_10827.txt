<s> I am looking for a 2.1 system and I like the Klipsch Promedia 2.1. </s>
<s> Now my question is has anybody ever hooked up bookshelf spreakers or any other speakers to this system? </s>
<s> If so, how did it sound? </s>
<s> I have two JBL62 speakers laying around that have a 6&quot; woofer and a 1&quot; tweeter and probably are better than the Klipsch satellites. </s>
<s> How well would this work? </s>
<s> I've got a pair of 62Ts connected to my main stereo amplifier but in a basement room. </s>
<s> I'd rate them as OK but not terrific. </s>
<s> My primary speakers are an old pair of JBL L65 Jubals bought in the '70s. </s>
<s> They make the 62Ts sound like a budget boom box from Walmart. </s>
<s> Believe it or not, I also have a set of Klipsch Promedia 2.1s connected to my PC. </s>
<s> I think there is more than one version of these. </s>
<s> Mine have a black and orange plastic oval near the bottom that says Klipsch THX. </s>
<s> If you have these same speakers, I'd say leave them alone. </s>
<s> I wouldn't consider trying to connect them to the satellite wiring. </s>
<s> They work well with the sub woofer. </s>
<s> I don't see what a couple more small woofers are going to add and I also doubt that the signal from the sub woofer would be properly equalized to power other low frequency speakers. </s>
<s> I doubt that's what you're looking for but can't offer much encouragement here. </s>
<s> They are just called JBL62 exactly, thy are older but today I just bought the promedia 2.1 and my left satellite distorts around half volume. </s>
<s> I'm also finding out that the sub can't take much at anything close to half volume. </s>
<s> Am I missing a setting or something? </s>
<s> I'm wondering if my JBL 62 speakers can replace the Klipsch speakers so it doesn't distort on me. </s>
<s> If so, the obvious answer is to return them under warranty rather than risk losing it. </s>
<s> If you bought them &quot;as is&quot;, the distortion could be a blown speaker (loose coil), bad volume control potentiometer or something as simple as loose hardware inside. </s>
<s> Somethings you can find and fix this. </s>
<s> Replacing the satellites is going to mean cutting and splicing some wire and dealing with the volume controls for both the satellites and the sub. </s>
<s> You'd have to fabricate some method of doing this. </s>
<s> I seriously doubt that you'll get better sound from the old JBLs than from a good working Klipsch outfit. </s>
<s> As for the sub woofer volume setting, I run the dial no higher than 9 to 10 oclock or bass tends to get muddy. </s>
<s> Most all of these systems will do this. </s>
<s> The extra power generated by its amplifier was never intended to allow you max out the volume controls. </s>
<s> It's there for damping and such to improve the accuracy of the speaker by controlling its travel. </s>
<s> I really like my Klipsch speakers and hope you get your problem resolved. </s>
<s> Yes I bought the system new, I will consider exchanging it for another after I try a few more things with it. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help and advice. </s>
