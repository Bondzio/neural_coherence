<s> Hi there. </s>
<s> It was recently brought to my attention that my computer will not boot up Windows XP. </s>
<s> Instead, I am prompted with a message saying something along the lines of &quot;System32 is missing or corrupted - please insert Win XP disc to [try] repair file&quot;. </s>
<s> The problem is; My disc drive is buggered. </s>
<s> I can easily get a new one, but will the new disc drive work if Win XP isn't booting up? </s>
<s> Don't I need to install drivers? </s>
<s> How is that going to be possible? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>

<s> The problem is; My disc drive is buggered. </s>
<s> I can easily get a new one, but will the new disc drive work if Win XP isn't booting up? </s>
<s> Don't I need to install drivers? </s>
<s> How is that going to be possible?&quot; Hello, unfortunately files in that folder can become corrupted or missing. </s>
<s> Your system may have suffered a system error recently or a key DLL, etc is simply gone. </s>
<s> Have you checked your BIOS to determine if your optical drive is configured and recognized properly? </s>
<s> Make sure your IDE or SATA cabling is correct along with the jumpers on your optical drive. </s>
<s> With PnP, your Windows OS should read the drive without the use of drivers other than the drivers that Windows provides. </s>
<s> You could check the manufacturers website for new firmware for your drive. </s>
<s> Or your drive simply doesn't function any longer and needs to be replaced. </s>
<s> Replace it with a PnP and bios compatible OS. </s>
<s> It should be recognized and configured without you installing a driver. </s>
<s> Make sure your jumpers and cabling are also correct. </s>
<s> Windows does have a recovery console embedded on the XP CD. </s>
<s> From there, you can type in commands like DOS, to troubleshoot. </s>
<s> You can do a google search for command prompt commands or type help in the cmd. </s>
<s> You can see if hidden system files will do the trick. </s>
<s> Given that error message is not directly related to system file errors, why not try it? </s>
<s> You could copy those system files from your C: root directory, on a floppy or USB or CD from another PC. </s>
<s> You can even copy another version of your OS Windows32 directory. </s>
<s> If its a common XP Professional or Home Wins32 message, your system should boot successfully with those files. </s>
<s> If not, its specific and tougher to fix that way. </s>
<s> Maybe you should go into safe mode and system restore to an earlier time or use a third party software like ERD that has Windows directories and other utilities. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> &quot;Replace it with a PnP and bios compatible OS.&quot; I meant a PnP BIOS compatible CD drive; most are these days. </s>
<s> You can see hidden system files using windows explorer in your C: directory. </s>
<s> Double click onto the C: icon and use your menu bar with the folders option to un-check the option for hidden system files. </s>
<s> To find windows32, double click onto your C: drive and click into Windows, then find the Wins32 folder. </s>
<s> a corrupted registry can prevent booting but does not necessarily mean your hard drive is bad. </s>
<s> the recovery console can fix your boot files/registry. </s>
