hi i have a hp pavilion slimline running 64bit windows7 it has the asus m2n68-la motherboard with a athlon2 x2 chip,when i turn pc on it loses audio after 5 minutes always if i restart it the audio is still not working.sometimes it tells me there is no speakers plug and puts the x over the audio button in bottom right of desktop other times i can see green pulsing on volume bar but still no luck,im totally new to pc,s so i dont really no what to try or even wether i should try anything or just take it to a shop anyway any advice appreciated.
p.s.
i have to leave pc shut down for a couple of hours before audio will come back on again.
