Last month or so I noticed that the battery level (when the adapter was plugged in too) indicated 99% and didn't go over that level... However, if I disconnected the adapter and let the battery level fall under 95%, when I plugged it in again it did go to 100% again. After hibernating though it fell to 99% again... I thought I might try to calibrate, and now it shows 98% and won't go over that level (with the adapter plugged in)... Is there an explanation? Thanks! PS: I have a Gigabyte netbook.

You'll see some odd advice about pulling batteries but this one looks to be a fretful user. Nod a lot and let them do what they want. Bob
