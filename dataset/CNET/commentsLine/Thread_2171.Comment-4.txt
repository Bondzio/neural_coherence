it is the nortek office 200wd, had a power rating of 5volts 100milliamps.
it is quite power hungry and sometimes, not a lot but sometimes, doesn't get enough power from the usb ports and either cuts out for a second or slows down.
but this is very rare.
so i would advise you to look for this in mice too and make sure you have enough power in your usb ports.
as for its thumb buttons, it has the two for back and forward browser (and great for games too) and i never catch them by accident.
both buttons are on the same side, where you'd put your thumb.
unfortunately not very good for left handed people though.
hope this helps.
