Cable modem router, DHCP enabled, IP: 192.168.1.1, netmask 255.255.255.0 -- Client pc's are Automatic IP.. (with an IP range 192.168.1.100 -&gt; 140) ADSL modem/router, DHCP disabled, IP: 192.168.1.2, netmask 255.255.255.0 -- Client pc's IP: 192.168.1.2xx, gateway 192.168.1.2, DNS: as ISP required.
It seems to works... but did I do it correctly?
Why you stressed out the netmask of 255.255.0.0?
Tried to use fix IP under 192.168.1.140.. on ADSL modem/router, but then I concern with conflicting IP when the PC's are started.. (thats the reason of IP above 200) Tried using different IP on each modem/router (i.e Cable IP: 192.168.1.1 and ADSL IP: 192.168.2.1), it didn't work for LAN(file/data share) If I could make it better or fix something, please advice..
Thank you
