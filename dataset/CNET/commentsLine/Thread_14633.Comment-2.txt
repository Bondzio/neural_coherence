just yesterday i found a machine that would corrupt any volume that was plugged into its usb ports.
-&gt; would that upset you?
it did its owner as they had nothing backed up on dvdrw or such.
-&gt; why i note this.
the usb hardware was reliable.
after we found the cause and fixed that, all devices that we could format began to work again so the bottom line was &quot;all the hardware was reliable.&quot; bob
