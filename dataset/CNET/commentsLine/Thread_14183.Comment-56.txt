my first personal computer, when personal meant self not corporate solutions, was an osborne cpm with 2 floppies 180k each, 64kbytes, wordstar, supercalc, and basic.
it cost 1,800. my first work computer was a tr(ash)80 model ii.
we had electric typewrites everywhere.
i even remember the debates over replacing manual typewriters with electric and the incessent arguments of apple vs ibm.
visicalc with no commas and my md-mdot budgets were 1.2 billon dollars.
oh spreadsheets were limited to about 32 kbytes.
it really amazes me that excel still has never picked up some of the finer aspects of the long line of spreadsheets.
i worked on a variety of computers including univac, rca and sds in the 60's.
my first experience with memory costs is the story of two univac engineers who bumped into each other and dropped two 4k blocks of core memory costing an estimated 100k dollars.
nothing but hand wound cores on the floor.
wonder if they got fired?
high speed lines in the military were 1200 baud.
for those who mentioned wang, he was dr. wang, and he developed the single capstan tape drive.
up to that time tape drives had to have two power capstans one each direction of the tape.
does anyone remember &quot;i remember mama&quot;?
