after decades, there is no future proof pc.
as to ddr 4, i think i read a tom's hardware note that read ... our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 lga 1155 core i5-2500k and a $1000 lga 2011 core i7-3960x, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved.
it turns out that memory bandwidth and pcie throughput don't hold back the performance of existing sandy bridge-based machines.
&quot;  so it's not a cpu issue and the items you asked about are not here in mass today.
my advice is to pick the best video card you can stand from this list.
then close your wallet.
