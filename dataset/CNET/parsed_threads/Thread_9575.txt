<s> I am about to buy a high end gaming computer for alot of money and I was wondering if I should wait until the new OS (VISTA) comes out or should I go ahead and buy the computer. </s>
<s> I recently ordered the two best video cards (NVIDIA 7900GTX SLI). </s>
<s> Now on Nvidia's website it says that the cards are Vista ready, but I read a review on CNET that says they'll only be good on DirectX 9.0. </s>
<s> Vista only runs on DirectX 10.0. </s>
<s> Does that mean the video cards will be obsolete by the time Vista debuts or perhaps will Nvidia be able to submit drivers to download so I get full graphics potential? </s>
<s> I also am using the AMD 64 bit chip which also says it is Vista ready. </s>
<s> But is it ready only with the minimum requirements or am I just wasting my time and should wait before I buy. </s>
<s> Please HELP! </s>
<s> If all you are worried about is Vista, then go build your high end machine. </s>
<s> Vista will be pushed back more and more. </s>
<s> Many people are going to stay with XP because it will probably be faster. </s>
<s> All the newest games will be backwards compatible with XP for at least a few years. </s>
<s> HL2 can run on win 2000. </s>
<s> And since a gaming rig is only a gaming rig for about 2 years. </s>
<s> You should never have to say, damn I can't play this until I get Vista. </s>
<s> If I am wrong I will give you my address and you can come give me a punch in the face. </s>
<s> ; ) </s>
<s> Well I actually already ordered the computer not just the cards but I could cancel if I wanted to. </s>
<s> But thank you for your help! </s>

<s> Here's my personal take, Vista seems to be having trouble getting out of the gate. </s>
<s> I know a lot of gamers and they have some new systems much like you and when they put Vista on, they said it ran , well, like crap. </s>
<s> They all went back to XP. </s>
<s> I personally don't care for it and would stick with XP right now and I call Vista the Win ME of NTFS. </s>
<s> I would say it's slow, sluggishly irritating, a bogged down XP and not worth the time. </s>
<s> I would stay with what works for now. </s>
<s> This is just my opinion though and you should still do some self research. </s>

<s> I am beta testing Vista... Its worse than windows xp 64 bit. </s>
<s> I have working hardware becuase ATI is smart enough to give Vista drivers.. but I still prefer xp alot. </s>
<s> I agree that it is terrible currently and as much as I hate to say this, it is &quot;BETA&quot;. </s>
<s> That is a big word for 4 letters. </s>
<s> I got around to thinking , yes I do that once in a while, and I figure maybe MS is doing the right thing. </s>
<s> In the past they put out an OS and beta test the darn thing as legit OSs causing millions to fix issues as they went. </s>
<s> Perhaps this is a better route to take and eventually will be more stable in the near future. </s>
<s> I don't like the resource sucking of the OS but with higher ram, 64 DCPs and all, I suppose you can get more out of an OS. </s>
<s> If it shows little improvment before final, then count me out, i'll wait for the next generation and use XP for now. </s>
<s> Paul </s>
<s> Vista, menrom, ddr3, atis no-link crossfire, hdmi compatibility, blu-ray/hd, dx10. </s>
<s> All coming soon. </s>
<s> It wont run on XP. </s>
<s> this is how M$ is tring to get people to buy their system,Vista only games </s>
<s> Buy one now.........if you want a new system, then buy a new system! </s>
<s> Forget about Vista and stick with XP Pro. </s>
<s> Everybody's hyped-up over Vista but it's going to turn out to be crap. </s>
<s> Vista-Vista-Vista.............. do some heavy research. </s>
<s> I went ahead and purchased the computer, hopefully if I decide to upgrade to the new operating system and play direct x 10 games maybe companies can make drivers to fix any incompatabilites. </s>
<s> Appreciate the advice and it will be a while before I upgrade. </s>
