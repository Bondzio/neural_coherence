I have on my comp: Windows XP SP2 *32 bit Zebronic Motherboard NF-7050 Intel Core2 Duo E4500 SONY DVD RW AW-G170A Above DVD writer mentioned does not read some DVD's on my computer.
It just shows &quot;0 bytes&quot; as the Total Size of DVD and also as the free space on DVD.
These same DVD's are read on my other computer.
Why does it show DVD's loaded with movies,data as blank DVD??
Please Help.
