1.1.1	I have a HP a450n and I just added stick of 512 ram so now my im up to 1GB and I also added a new graphics card, a gefore 7600gs.	St
1.1.2	My problem is that when i play a game of any kind, some kind of box comes up saying something about i need more power in order to fun the card properly or something like that.	St
1.1.3	so i was wonder if i need a new power supply.	St
1.1.4	the one i have right now is 250W.	St
1.1.5	i was think about something around 400W becuase later on i might want to do more upgrading.	St
1.1.6	And i also want to know which kind i should get so that it complies with my system.	St
1.2.1	a good 400-500 watt would work and give you enough power to expand.. Get a decent one.. you will pay a bit more but your paying for effeciancy and reliability.	St
1.2.2	and check to see if your video card has a addon power spot/plug.. it might need more power to use all of it at full speed	Sug
1.3.1	hp's site doesn't give any info on your power supply but it's probably less than 250w and it may be smaller than a standard power supply.	St
1.3.2	Standard ATX: 6&quot;x3.5x&quot;5.5&quot; MiniATX: 5&quot;x3.5&quot;x5&quot; MicroATX or SFX: 5&quot;x3&quot;x4&quot; (or 5&quot;x2.5&quot;x4&quot;) once you figure out the size, i recommend you get a 350w-400w power supply.	St
1.3.3	if you need a MicroATX, 350w will be the max that's available.	St
1.4.1	i will check on the size and try to get something in my price range.	Sug
1.4.2	thanks a lot you guys!	Polite
