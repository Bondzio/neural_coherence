Seems odd.
Normally sound cards on Desktops will have a Mic in, Line in and Line out.
It may also have a Speaker out in addition.
Laptops may not have a Line IN.
In your case, it must be LINE IN and not LINE OUT.
Please confirm.
The CDRW audio cable goes in to the Line IN socket.
Please post a feedback.
