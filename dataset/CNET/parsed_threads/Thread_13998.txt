<s> My hardrive is going bad and I have XP home on it and don't like all the junk on the restore disk. </s>
<s> My objective is to install a new hardrive with windows XP only and nothing else. </s>
<s> I plan to install an XP Pro upgrade after doing this. </s>
<s> What is the best way to go about this? </s>
<s> Can I put the existing windows program files on a flash drive and boot the new hardrive with it? </s>
<s> Suggestions please! </s>
<s> If you are planning on going to XP Pro when replacing the drive, you really do not need too much. </s>
<s> When you buy the new drive, just put XP Pro on it. </s>
<s> If the program is really an upgrade, it just asks for the location of the previous version's install. </s>
<s> I never really tried it with restore disks but you can try that. </s>
<s> If that does not work, then install the old drive in for just the verification (maybe could be in an external enclosure) and then proceed. </s>
<s> Others may be able to give you more info on this for a workaround, or you could just use any qualifying OS install disc. </s>
<s> XP Home install CD. </s>
<s> See here: http://www.howtohaven.com/system/createwindowssetupdisk.shtml That is allot of work though, just for that but if it makes you feel more legal, then go for it. </s>
<s> If yes...you do not need to reinstall XP Home before upgrading to XP Pro. </s>
<s> All you need do is start the XP Pro upgrade and when it asks about the OS to be upgraded ...you put in the XP Home CD. </s>
<s> Once the XP Home is verified, put the XP Pro CD in and finish the install. </s>
<s> If it doesn't work ...lemme know. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
