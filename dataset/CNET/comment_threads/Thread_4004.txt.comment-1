I have a wireless network using a belking pre-N router, the speed of the network is great once it stablishes the connection, but when I try to open a share folder it takes from 30 to 60 seconds to open, but after that I can work find and the file transfer are done really fast... my question is y is does it take so long to stablishe the connection?
is it the router or the computer?
which by the way are dell dimention running xp pro
