Or what do you think is the best way to achieve it? For me, I use Partition Magic but I am not sure if it is the best and whether I doing the right way with it.

For creating new partitions (including logical ones) I use Window's Disk Management and that has never gone wrong for me. However if I want to do more of the complex stuff that Partition Magic offers (merge partitions, rename a partition, redistribute free space, resize, etc.), I would use that. Oh and for installing a new OS, even though PM offers that I don't use it, I like doing it the conventional way. But if you like it, use it. I'm just stating my opinion

In general or in any particular situation, like &quot;tell me the details of your PC and what you do with it, and I'll tell you the optimal configuration for that machine&quot;? If there isn't, the only possible answer to your question is that it is an question without an answer. Something like &quot;how do I walk to the moon?&quot;, or even &quot;how do I reach the end of the rainbow?&quot;. I think for most of us one partition per drive is optimal. And that's easy to achieve the first time you use it. No magic needed. Kees
