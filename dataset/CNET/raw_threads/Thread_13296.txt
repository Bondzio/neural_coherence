I would appreciate any insight into what you recommend as minimum requirements for Photoshop to run without any delay, and also what system would be a good bargain that fits the same criteria. I would prefer to keep the price under $1000. Thanks all.

Since it is price sensitive, let's look at desktops with quad core CPUs and at least 4GB RAM. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883113110 could be a starting point. Bob
