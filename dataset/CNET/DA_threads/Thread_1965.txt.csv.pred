1.2.1	As the old saying goes & quot ; You only lose what you did n't backup & quot ; .	St
1.2.2	That 's especially true for external hard disks , that are so prone to failures and thus utterly unsuited to store the only copy of important stuff .	St
1.2.3	That being said , there are 2 things you can do yourself : 1 .	St
1.2.4	See what Disk Management ( a program in Windows ) says about the disk .	St
1.2.5	If it ca n't find the disk , go to step 2 .	St
1.2.6	If it says something like & quot ; unallocated & quot ; or & quot ; unformatted & quot ; try data recovery software like RECUVA or GETDATABACK ( see one of top posts in this forum & quot ; lost and found & quot ; ; read all ! )	St
1.2.7	2 .	St
1.2.8	Take the disk out and mount it in another enclosure .	St
1.2.9	With some luck , it 's only the electronics in the enclosure that 's somehow damaged and the disk is OK and will function in a new enclosure .	St
1.2.10	If both steps fail , it 's time to send your disk to a data recovery company and pay the bill .	St
1.2.11	That & quot ; weird sound & quot ; is n't promising and might make it rather expensive .	St
1.2.12	Think USD 1000 .	St
1.2.13	Kees	St
1.3.1	Thank you for answering .	St
1.3.2	I tried , but I can not see the HDD in disk management .	St
1.3.3	And how do I disk ou from the HDD ?	Ques
1.3.4	I ca n't open it and I don know how to do it .	St
1.3.5	Could you help me out ?	Ques
1.4.1	There might be some screws you can loosen .	St
1.4.2	And else there 's always that data recovery company .	St
1.4.3	Kees	St
