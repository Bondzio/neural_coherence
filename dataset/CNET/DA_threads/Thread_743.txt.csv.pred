1.1.1	I ca n't seem to be able to get my new graphics card , which is a evga e-Geforce 6200 8x AGP 256mb DDR , to work on my Dell Dimension 4600 .	St
1.1.2	If anyone can help me ( every time I plug in the card into the AGP slot and turn on the computer , even when the cable is connected , the screen stays black ) .	St
1.2.1	They system came with an integrated intel extreme 2 graphics card , if it is possible to disable this , it might help .	St
1.3.1	If you have integrated graphics , try putting the monitor cable back on the original connector .	St
1.3.2	If it is still on the original connector , put it on the video card connector .	St
1.3.3	That will tell which card is working .	St
1.3.4	Also , check the BIOS setting to disable the on board graphics ( although Dell hints it may be automatic ) see here : http : //support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim4600/en/4600i/sm/syssetup.htm # 1138127	Sug
1.4.1	Do i need to have the drivers already on the computer , because every time i try to do that it does n't let me install them .	Sug
1.4.2	Also I would like to know if the dell dimension 4600 motherboards are somehow not compatible with this card .	St
