it's possible with your existing card provided you have a vga adapter for your dvi port.
conect the crt to the vga 15 pin d-sub, use the analog adapter (fits on the dvi port and makes it a vga 15 pin like the other one) connect the lcd, and configure them using the nvidia drivers.
*note* you may want to update the nvidia drivers for your card from the nvidia website.
once you've accomplished this, if you have trouble configuring the driver settings, post back here and i'll try to help you out.
