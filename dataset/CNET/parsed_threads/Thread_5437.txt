<s> I am hoping someone can help me out with this: I had a bunch of old stuff (and some spyware I think) on my computer, so I decided to a complete format and reinstall XP. </s>
<s> I went through the installation and then updated my device drivers from the CD's. </s>
<s> Everything seemed fine... Then I plugged in the ethernet cable. </s>
<s> It was fine until it started downloading the windows updates. </s>
<s> It hadn't actually got to the real updates, just the initial update software it has to install. </s>
<s> I think it was on #2 of 3 when it froze. </s>
<s> The mouse would still move, but I couldn't click anything or bring up the task manager with ctrl+alt+delete. </s>
<s> I was thinking it could be the hard drive, but then I imagine it wouldn't boot at all. </s>
<s> Before the spyware got on the computer, everything was running fine, so I wouldn't think that any of the components just &quot;went bad.&quot; Any suggestions are much appreciated! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> System specs: AMD64 cpu nvidia geforce 6600 video card 1gb ram </s>
<s> I think heat. </s>
<s> So I pull a side cover and blow out the dust, Make sure the fans are all turning, especially the heat Sink. </s>
<s> Then try it again. </s>
<s> I pulled the side cover off and left it off. </s>
<s> The fans/heatsinks are all fine. </s>
<s> I turned it on and didn't even run any programs. </s>
<s> I figure with the cover off and no programs running heat shouldn't be a problem. </s>
<s> The computer still froze after a couple minutes. </s>
<s> I think I'm going to try reformatting again and turning off the automatic updates to see what happens. </s>
<s> I've heard of people having some issues with those before. </s>
<s> And here I was trying to pin all my problems on itunes! </s>
<s> I think my next computer will be a mac. </s>
