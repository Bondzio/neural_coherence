About two weeks ago my PC stopped turning on.
I had no problems prior to this.
I had it looked at by local PC guy and he said power supply was fine, that it was the motherboard or CPU.
Also, said it would be $250.00 to fix.
I wanted to see if this sounded right, or was I getting screwed.
Thanks for any help.
