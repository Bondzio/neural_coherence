<s> Hopefully this is the right spot for this ! </s>
<s> I'm hoping someone can read this and help me straighten this out. </s>
<s> Any help is greatly appreciated !! </s>
<s> A quick background of the situation. </s>
<s> Up until about 5-6 years ago we had a camera that took film and we got pictures developed and that was it! </s>
<s> Since then we have a digital camera,smart phones, tablets and we take more pictures and video than ever! </s>
<s> I usually have to back up everyone's stuff from the phones and cameras . </s>
<s> Some of these digital pics we print. </s>
<s> A lot of them we don't need to print, but we share and want to keep them. </s>
<s> Now, everyone will be super angry if I ever lost anything so I've backed all up onto 2 USB hard drives and a copy on the computer. </s>
<s> I been doing a lot of sharing and backup through windows for a long time this way. </s>
<s> My problem is ,I have to make this simpler and more efficient. </s>
<s> I can fix a computer and I'm technical with stuff ,but I never did any REAL server/backup type things. </s>
<s> Hopefully someone with experience and knowledge can steer me in the right direction ? </s>
<s> I was looking into freeNas (raid) and amahi (greyhole) and I peeked at windows home server ( drive extender). </s>
<s> I've read a lot but I'm not sure which way to go. </s>
<s> Maybe there is better options? </s>
<s> Here's what I &quot;like&quot; to do :/ I have an available PC that's ready to be wiped and configured. </s>
<s> If a Mac would be better for whatever reason ill get one. </s>
<s> But I like to keep the cost down. </s>
<s> I like to have an easy ( somewhat ) way for everyone to back up their own stuff ( in an organized fashion ) and have all info duplicated. </s>
<s> So if one hard drive fails the info is recoverable. </s>
<s> The raid weirds me out a little because if a drive fails do you need an exact same drive to replace? </s>
<s> Same manufacturer ? </s>
<s> Or just any drive that same size or bigger ? </s>
<s> That's where I was &quot;kinda&quot; liking &quot;greyhole and drive extender &quot; . </s>
<s> Also a way to share anything local and remote. </s>
<s> Oh if possible I would like to have another machine at a family members house where they can do the same and we can backup each others stuff remotely on a schedule ? </s>
<s> Again I appreciate and help ! </s>
<s> Thank you ! </s>

<s> that is commonly employed by businesses with multiple users is a centralized network storage. </s>
<s> Budgets determine how high in performance, scalability, fault tolerance and backups they can go. </s>
<s> Home administrators can employ a modest configuration within consumer budgets. </s>
<s> Avoid low end NAS - they are too slow. </s>
<s> Get a gigabit network and put a file server and all your users on it. </s>
<s> If you know how to run Linux, your server OS is free, otherwise use WXP Pro or W7Pro for easier operation than home premium editions. </s>
<s> It would be too exhausting to describe &quot;how to&quot; in this post, so read up about networked file server and use your spare PC to experiment. </s>
<s> One last tip: a 24/7 server can chew up a lot of electricity so a low energy CPU like Atom and 2.5&quot; 5400rpm disk drives will help mitigate the bills. </s>
<s> You don't need high speed PC hardware to achieve good file server performance for a few users at home! </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Backup is a system of more than just a network drive. </s>
<s> It's been well discussed you must have an offline set to safeguard against a rogue app or user. </s>
<s> With that out of the way I upgraded my router to one with a NAS feature (Netgear n600 wndr3800) and plugged in a small form USB 500GB HDD. </s>
<s> It's been out there for months without issue. </s>
<s> It also does not take much power which I find most folk forget about. </s>
<s> Some folk think using an old PC would cut the costs but at the usual 100 or more Watts it taxes them for years. </s>
<s> So my solution is best for home use, doesn't draw much more than 1 Watt and for software I use SyncBack most of the time. </s>
<s> That's the end of the online step. </s>
<s> For offline I sync this with another drive then what I can't lose fits onto USB memory sticks. </s>
