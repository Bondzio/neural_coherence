just bought a d-link di-514 using a lap top to surf the net, the connection constantly drops in speed.
when i download a file, the per second speed starts off high in the 150kbps/second range, then every time falls down to about 30kbpa/second or less.
when using the net with a non wireless connection it is fine.
called customer support and they &quot;tried&quot; to help but i'm still getting the problem.
is the d-link defective?
any help would be appreciated.
thanx.
