<s> I have to ask this. </s>
<s> Considering the size and dimensions of the IPad, is a rear camera really needed? </s>
<s> I mean, I can see a camera mounted facing the user, this has a place, it can be a web-cam for video chat, Skype, etc. </s>
<s> But a back-mounted camera is kinda pointless. </s>
<s> I would be like a hard-back book doubling as a camera..WHY??? </s>
<s> I can't imagine (actually sadly enough I can imagine) people using this book sized thing as a camera, would look [and mostly like be] the most awkward sized and silly to use camera in the world? </s>
<s> I do realize CNet is chock-full of Apple fan-boys so I would love to hear other takes / opinions on the subject. </s>
<s> I think I see another solution. </s>
<s> Look up CameraA and CameraB in the app store. </s>
<s> What you find is that some think that because a product isn't just right for them it is no good. </s>
<s> Read Goldilocks and the three bears lately? </s>
<s> This Goldilocks syndrome is best ignored and we can move to finding what &quot;this one is just right.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> Actually I just watched Tom Merritt talk about this App that led to my posting this question (something that has been bugging me since people have been bringing up having a camera for the IPad and stating that this is a bad thing on the part of Apple for not including it). </s>
<s> I am not looking for a APP that does this. </s>
<s> I am asking why would you want to do this using the IPad (it's dimensions make it impractical to use as a camera)? </s>
<s> I stated my logic for this question is the previous posting. </s>
<s> I am really curious for the reasoning people have for wanting a camera for the IPad (I mean a camera in the back of the device, not a web-cam [like I said earlier that makes sense]). </s>
<s> I did miss your point. </s>
<s> Or maybe I didn't. </s>
<s> Not every product is suited for each person. </s>
<s> Let's say they did what you wanted. </s>
<s> Now the next person comes along (just like Goldilocks) and doesn't like it. </s>
<s> Choice is good. </s>
<s> Let the market decide. </s>
<s> Make yours? </s>

<s> OK, while I do not see IPAD sales slipping because they included a device that does not get used very often (or at all considering the alternative devices out there), I do see your point about letting the sales numbers speak for themselves. </s>
<s> I agree that a webcam on the back of an iPad doesn't sound ergonomically useful. </s>
<s> However if you could plug in an external webcam and point it to the professor during class you could record the lecture and see the screen. </s>
<s> And when you want to Skype you could point the external webcam toward you. </s>
<s> Yes, I second that idea. </s>
<s> My idea is an external camera that has no cable just a dock connector and a swivel head so it can face forwards or backwards, or any way you want it to face. </s>
<s> The camera would be very compact. </s>
<s> Since the iPad can be used in any orientation you the user could turn it upside down and have the camera on the topside. </s>
<s> Although, one could use the camera in landscape orientation if wanted. </s>
<s> This would make the camera very compact to carry around. </s>
<s> I would buy one as soon as one is created. </s>
<s> How about you? </s>
<s> I have the Ipad 3G and this is the perfect device for skyping. </s>
<s> I think just for video conferencing a built in camera would be a cleaner looking feature and one would not have to carry around an added device. </s>
<s> Since one is not included an external camera as described above would be nice. </s>
