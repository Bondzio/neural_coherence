And this discussion has so little detail about the setup that I can't offer much more.
That is, do you feel that a member should post no details, get asked, then begin or should the member go ahead and share the details and skip the first round?

And if you want a direct link, I'm going to bow out.
That flag on vista is widely discussed and quite a pain.
In closing, why dig up an old thread when you have a new issue?
