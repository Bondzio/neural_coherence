Many systems on startup will kick-in the fan to a high speed then settle down. If you had a system for awhile, it cooling fins or fan maybe lacking a good cleaning, do it ASAP. If this is a laptop, the same applies. Use a can of compressed air or direct brush cleaning for best results. if the problem persists after a cleaning, then replace fan as likely cause of noise. Those systems build as extreme of OC'ed will need better cooling if only &quot;stock cooled&quot; to better cool the heat build-up. If cleaning all areas should be addressed.
