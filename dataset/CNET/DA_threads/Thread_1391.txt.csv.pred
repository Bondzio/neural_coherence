1.1.1	Hey all , I have a 2 year old pc with decent specs but nothing special when it comes to the video card .	St
1.1.2	I 'm looking to upgrade so that I can play Diablo 3 on decent settings .	St
1.1.3	I am not sure which video card is in my range ( $ 50-100 ) and would be compatible with my PC , and/or if I need to upgrade my power supply first .	St
1.1.4	Below are my specs .	St
1.1.5	Any help would be appreciated !	St

1.2.1	The neat part here is you are starting with that 5450 .	St
1.2.2	That card is fine .	St
1.2.3	It should run that game but most want more .	St
1.2.4	Here 's the list - & gt ; http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html You can pick from that list in the price range and then see if you have enough Amperes and Watts in your PSU .	St
1.2.5	You did n't supply the PSU rating so I ca n't comment .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	If I 'm looking at the proper machine .	St
1.3.2	That unit is a slim-line or a mini-tower with a 300w psu .	St
1.3.3	Neither case is designed for gaming You might need a low profile card .	St
1.3.4	With a 300w psu you might not be able to move up the gpu ladder .	St
1.3.5	Even a GF gt440 might push the psu into overload .	St
