Hey thanks... OK If I connect a switch to a router, is that connected with a crossover cable or just a standard cable?
Same with the Punch Panel to the switch...standard or crossover cable?
The splitters will be used for RG6 cable splitting and I was asking is this the way to route the cable the signal.
I have no telephone service yet, and not sure I will, but I was going to use 4 wires of one cat5 cable to wire one phone connection and the other 4 wires of the cat5 cable for the other phone line.
similarly I was going to use a 66 panel to wire all the phone lines.
