Did you have it as a username before the PC crashed?
If not, it could be your user account directory.
Did you check its contents?
Anyhow, connecting an old drive with Windows system files to a new PC via IDE or SATA is a bad idea.
Better to connect thru a USB converter or external USB enclosure.
Your files might all be gone now, or they might not.
Before you do more harm to the old files, try connecting the drive with a USB converter.
Good luck.
