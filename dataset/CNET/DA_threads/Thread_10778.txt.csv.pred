1.1.1	I was hoping someone could give me some advice on upgrading memory .	St
1.1.2	I hate to ask what might be a basic question but I also do n't want to either buy the incorrect or best option for memory .	St
1.1.3	I am looking to upgrade my pc to I THINK 4gb of RAM .	St
1.1.4	I currently have a HP m7248n with 1 mb of ram .	St
1.1.5	More specifically acording to the stats I have 2 X 512/ 184 pin , DDR SDRAM .	St
1.1.6	The PC has a Athlon 64 X2 ( M ) 4200 2.2 GHz processor and I am running Windows XP Media center edition ver 2002 service pack 2 .	St
1.1.7	I also believe I have 4 slots for memory ( 2 in use , 2 available ) .	St
1.1.8	I have included a link to the HP web site with my model below if I left out any additional information .	St
1.1.9	In regards to use , I am not a huge power user except for the fact I burn a lot of DVDs of home movies .	St
1.1.10	Also burn cd 's , listen to music , transfer songs to mp3 .	St
1.1.11	I also do a LOT of uploading photos etc .	St
1.1.12	( dad of 3 kids basically ) .	St
1.1.13	I do n't do gaming really at all , so beyond the power intensive dvd rendering and other items above my use ends up mainly limited to internet etc .	St
1.1.14	here are my questions : 1 ) Right off the bat , what kind of memory should I get ?	Ques
1.1.15	When I did a QUICK look I saw options such as 800 MHz DDR2 , 1333 MHz DDR3 etc .	St
1.1.16	I know what memory is in general , but get lost on the DDR2 vs DDR3 etc 2 ) If I have 4 slots open , and am interested in 4 gb , can I actually buy 2 2 GB cards and keep my existing 2 and actually end up with 5 gb ?	Ques
1.1.17	or am I better off yanking what i have and just putting in the 2 2 gb ( or maybe 4 1 gb if the cost make more sense ) I hope I provided enough info and made my questions clear .	Ques
1.1.18	If not scold me , I have a thick skin , then tell me what else you need to know .	St
1.1.19	Also I am fairly comfortable with opening the system , removing the memory I have , putting new in etc - I have done that before , it is not a matter of how to but what I need .	St
1.1.20	thanks thanks thanks in advance agian , if needed , additional link to PC model with technical stats : http : //h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document ? docname=c00511049 & cc=us & dlc=en & lc=en & jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN	Polite
1.2.1	2.25GB RAM .	St
1.2.2	So why go much over 2G ?	Ques
1.2.3	www.crucial.com has your model listed so stick to that and you 'll be fine .	St
1.2.4	But I do n't expect more than 2 per cent speed gains on anything you said you are doing .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	just for clarification : are you saying if I go from 1gb to 2gb I wo n't get much more than a 2 % or so improvement ?	Ques
1.3.2	Or that if I go much beyond 2gb I wo n't get much more ?	Ques
1.3.3	In regards to what I am doing , yes I should of been more clear .	St
1.3.4	For the basics I do n't have any issues at all - email , internet , excel and word stuff etc .	St
1.3.5	The ONLY reason I am thinking about a bump up is when I go to download either a huge number of photos and edit them or when I am creating DVDs .	St
1.3.6	I know the additional memory may not actually cause the burn of the dvd to occur faster , nor do I care that much - I run it before I head to bed .	St
1.3.7	But the editing , dumoing of a lot of video , comes to a crawl at times .	St
1.3.8	I figured especially if I only do about 2gb for $ 50.00 if it helped it would be worth it .	St
1.3.9	so given that , sorry for the additional question but do you think at least bumping to 2gb would help ?	Ques
1.3.10	and if so are you saying that might but then beyond 2gb is just overkill , especially with an older processor etc .	St
1.3.11	thanks again for your help	Polite
1.4.1	It was XP with 2 identical machines .	St
1.4.2	The DVD render took 6 hours on the machine with 512MB RAM .	St
1.4.3	The 1GB machine did it 5 minutes faster .	St
1.4.4	We could n't believe the results so we swapped RAM and re-ran the tests .	St
1.4.5	Same results .	St
1.4.6	You are asking for speed so this is not where to get it as you are already at 1GB and have XP ( not Vista which would change my answer . )	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
