my computer has these specs: amd anthlon xp 2400+ 640 mb.
pc-2100 ram 160 gb.
maxtor diamondmax 9 hard drive nvidia geforce fx 5700ve 256 video mb.
250 watt power supply ( not sure what the motherboard is....) whenever i buy games, i do look at the system requirements and the recommended requirements, however some games like world of warcraft and far cry has a recommended spec that is close to my computer's specs, but when i play those kind of games, i experience lots of lags, and my computer won't be able to handle graphics to the max.
since my computer is a recommended computer, how come it lags?
