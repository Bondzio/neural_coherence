i recently bought an external case and a 250 gig ide drive for under $150 total.
what you can do is find the current &quot;sweet spot&quot; in drive prices by dividing the price by # of gigs.
you will find that there's a point where the price per gig is lowest.
250 seems to be the spot about now.
these are easy to put together yourself and most of these cases will accommodate at least a 300 gig drive.
