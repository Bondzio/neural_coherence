<s> I have been researching, but still am not convinced i need an external Hard Drive. </s>
<s> I share a computer and would like to keep my person music and video files on an EX HD that could be password protected. </s>
<s> Is this even possible with one? </s>
<s> Also is this a good enough reason to invest in one? </s>
