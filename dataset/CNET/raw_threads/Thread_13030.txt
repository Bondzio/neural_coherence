Which external HD is most likely to last the longest. Is there a best brand or any difference between brands. Is it true that an internal HD will generally last longer then an external one, why is that? Thanks

While external HD's dont seem to last as long. Maybe that is because of wear and tear, but an internal HD is used much more then an external one.
