<s> I've got to think that this question gets posed somewhat regularly but I couldn't find much in the forums about it. </s>
<s> My laptop for work is configured to be on the network at work. </s>
<s> It has a static IP and DNS server address. </s>
<s> I'd like to be able to use my laptop at home on my Workgroup network. </s>
<s> I just can't figure out how. </s>
<s> At home everything on the network is set up to Obtain the IP and DNS addresses. </s>
<s> I have already joined my work laptop to my home wireless network. </s>
<s> This only accomplishes getting me access to the internet. </s>
<s> How do I arrange to share files and printers? </s>
<s> On the Home PC if I double click My Network Places there is an option to Set Up A Home or Small Office Network. </s>
<s> That's usually what I use when I'm configuring a PC at home. </s>
<s> But the work PC doesn't have this option. </s>
<s> It's only options are: Search Active Directory or Set Up A Wireless Netowrk For A Home Or Small Office. </s>
<s> I found a program that will easily allow me to switch which network I'm on but don't I have to join the home network before I can switch to it? </s>
<s> Thanks for the guidance. </s>

<s> Look at http://www.netswitcher.com/ As to file and printer shares you might want to use a batch file to make the connections? </s>
<s> &quot;don't I have to join the home network before I can switch to it?&quot; No. </s>
<s> The idea of joining the network is for corporate lans. </s>
