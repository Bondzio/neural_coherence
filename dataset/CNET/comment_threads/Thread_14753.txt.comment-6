I don't recommend this.
As said earlier external hard drives are ment to be used for mirrors; backups; and extended library function.
I HIGHLY recommend you to get a new internal hard drive same configuration; same transfer speed but larger.
You can pickup 160 gb hard drives now for less than 100$ You will save yourself a lot of heartache by keeping the boot disk ide.
If you go the route of using external hd your computer will have errors and you will have a lot of problems on your hand.
Also do you have recovery disks or a recovery partition?
You especially don't want to go external if you recovery is on the hd.
