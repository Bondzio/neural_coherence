i installed a brother mfc 420cn successfully on my netgear wireless router that both my ibook and windows me pc can see.
but after installation, a brother hl-1435 laser printer and an hp photoprinter 1100+ &quot;stopped&quot; according to printer setup utility in os x panther.
i tried reinstalling the brother laser driver but the ibook doesn't see it under usb in printer setup utility.
any suggestions would be appreciated!
(ibook g4 running os x 10.3.9, netgear wireless g router, brother mfc 420cn networked printer, local brother hl-1435 laser printer and hp photopriner 1100+ using usb)
