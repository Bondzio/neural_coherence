1.1.1	Hi all , I 'm currently running Windows Vista Home Premium 32-bit on an Intel Duo 2.2GHz with 2 gigs of RAM .	St
1.1.2	I recently acquired a Panasonic TX-26LXD50 TV , with the intention of using it as my primary monitor so I could play WoW on a larger screen .	St
1.1.3	I 've connected it via a SCART to S-Video cable .	St
1.1.4	The problem is that the setup for my graphics card ( NVidia GeForce 8400GS ) informs me that I ca n't have a resolution higher than 1024x768 on the TV , which is rather blurry and not very easy on my eyes .	St
1.1.5	I 've tried updating my graphics card driver ( which did allow me to choose 1440x900 for my -smaller- monitor , but not the TV ...	St
1.1.6	I also tried using PowerStrip to force a custom resolution , but if anything that 's worsened the problem .	St
1.1.7	Can anyone possibly help me to fix this , or even just inform me that what I want to do is n't possible and I just wasted money on a TV I do n't need ?	Ques
1.1.8	: P	St
1.2.1	Sorry , bummer .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Should I have used something else ?	Ques
1.4.1	which do not make good monitor use .	St
1.4.2	I think the RGB might make better connection for computer use .	St
1.5.1	DVI or HDMI different Vid card ( s ) .	St
1.5.2	DVI would give you Video only , you would have to tap off for audio , HDMI would give you both .	St
1.5.3	Your computer specs are a bit light , however and you would likely , unless you already have , need to upgrade the power supply , assuming this is a storebought puter .	St
1.5.4	Plus 2gb of ram with Vista will just get you by with 32 bit system try to run 3gb , if possible .	St
1.6.1	Yes PAL might be a tad lower or higher depending on how you look at it , but at 480 lines the screen should be only good for playing a DVD .	St
