<s> Hey guys, recently I purchased new RAM memory for my desktop. </s>
<s> It is 16GB Gskill RipjawsX 1600Mhz, with 10-10-10-30 timing. </s>
<s> I installed it, set proper timings and speed in BIOS, and after a few minutes of work, I got BSOD. </s>
<s> When I restarted my PC, it said it could not load my graphic card drivers. </s>
<s> I downloaded newest one from nVidia site, I thought it might be a problem because I was using beta drivers. </s>
<s> But the same thing happen. </s>
<s> I went and reset speed and timings to auto, which is 1333Mhz, 9-9-9-24, and since then it is working properly, which is some 2-3 hours. </s>
<s> I was hoping someone can help me with this problem. </s>
<s> Anyway, my configuration is: AMD FX-8320 3.5Ghz Gigabyte 990FXA-UD3 nVidia GeForce GTX480 WD 1TB HD. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Under such circumstances it's telling you what's best to operate at or safe level. </s>
<s> Even, if the ram is capable the other half is the mtrbd., etc. </s>
<s> to keep pace. </s>
<s> If you hadn't yet, look into the bios update level. </s>
<s> if it has moved beyond your current level, it's a good bet it handles ram better. </s>
<s> It's worth the upgrade provided it addresses ram issues. </s>
<s> The mere fact you set the ram level manually says it needs help. </s>
<s> As already post to you, up the voltage, .01 until its happy. </s>
<s> Allow to work with higher voltage but don't push it. </s>
<s> If you install in *ALL* ram slots, timing can be a critical issue long posted for yrs. </s>
<s> as a critical factor for ram. </s>
<s> A good check is to view the ram status response using PCWizard 2012 and read that all ram is actually the same, regardless of what the sticker states on ram itself. </s>
<s> Google for PCWizard to install it. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I don't think the speed or timings are the problem. </s>
<s> I tried reinstalling my old RAM, and I also got BSOD while trying to download GW2.I ran memtest and it came back with approx. </s>
<s> 7k errors. </s>
<s> I ran memtest with new RAM and I got 40k errors on first pass. </s>
<s> The BSOD I was getting before was irql_not_less_or_equal, now I am getting pfn_list_corrupt stop 0x0000004e. </s>
<s> Also, my computer would work for hour or two, but as soon as I would try to download something (the only thing I actually tried downloading was GW2) it would get BSOD. </s>
<s> If you can't get memtest to run error free.....stop. </s>
<s> Use memtest as your test vehicle and fix the machine. </s>
<s> Since you have ram faults you want to see 12&gt;24 hrs of memtest with zero errors. </s>
<s> If you don't think ram is the problem, what's left? </s>
<s> that's the mtrbd. </s>
<s> and all it entails. </s>
<s> Further, you state now you have errors during tests, so you basically know there's a problem. </s>
<s> That should have all been posted in the 1st post, so answers can get to the point. </s>
<s> Now, from POV there's really nothing that can be done because it relies on the mtrbd. </s>
<s> to be fixed or patched. </s>
<s> As i stated, if a bios level is behind, do that as a last resort. </s>
<s> You clean out the ram slots as well with alcohol and toothbrush, allow to dry and then retry ram. </s>
<s> if the problem persists, it maybe better to get a mtrbd. </s>
<s> replacement. </s>
<s> Since this also happens with old ram too. </s>
<s> You should also look for &quot;bad caps&quot;, even a minor weak cap with cause issues, plus a PSU swap to check as a stable power test. </s>
<s> Otherwise, you're left with a mtrbd. </s>
<s> problem if nothing seems to fix it. </s>
<s> I would do a tear down place on cardboard and test that way, one item at a time for basic or minimum system. </s>
<s> because it works and then BSOD when you try to d/l suggest that really you're in a ram stack that hasn't been reached yet, so effectively you enter a ram area and then &quot;poof&quot;. </s>
<s> You're hitting whatever is causing ram issue. </s>
