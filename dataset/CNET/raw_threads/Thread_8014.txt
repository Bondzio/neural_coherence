I have 2 computers both win XP, a network laser printer, and a broadband internet connection, all hooked up to a linksys befsr41 router. I had the 2 computers networked to each other but now I lost the connection between them and can't get them to find each other. However each computer can access the internet through the router. How come they can't find each other? I have run the necessary XP programs and rebooted. What could be the problem?

Upgrade to SP2? Viral or spyware infestation? Have you checked the workgroup names? Done a search for computer from each computer? Tried to ping each others address?

That re-set whatever was wrong so I was able to connect again, however different problems arose with my internet connection. But now it seems to be working Ok. So I'll go forward from this point. I just wish I knew what was wrong so I could have fixed it myself.
