Or did I not understand your post correctly? Tell us more. What are you attempting to do, and why? Which OS, and what make/model computer? Is this hard drive the one with your Operating System, (OS), on it? If so, how are you trying to reformat it? Generally, you cannot reformat a hard drive which has the OS installed, whilst you are logged in to that OS. The OS will not let itself be deleted like that. You will need to format it using tools with the OS not loaded. Why can't you access the data? What error messages do you see? Mark

If you simply plan to format, I suggest now you google and then use KILLDISK or DBAN pgms. that totally wipe out the HD. Then, reformat using the windoze OS disc, I suspect to reuse the HD. There will be no data to recover unless, the data is on another HD or partition(?). tada ------Willy
