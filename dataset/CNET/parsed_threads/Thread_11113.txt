<s> Hi guys I'm having problems connecting my desktop PC (running windows XP) to my wireless Thomson TG585 gateway. </s>
<s> I'm attempting to use an Intellinet 150N usb adapter, but I'm getting nowhere. </s>
<s> The wireless network is detected but I am unable to connect to it. </s>
<s> After a few minutes I am told that the connection has &quot;limited or no connectivity&quot;. </s>
<s> I am able to connect fine via my macbook. </s>
<s> I'd be happy to provide any further necessary information, and I'd be grateful for any possible pointers. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot, Thomas </s>
<s> Since there are no details I can only suggest you try it setup the ways we note at the top of this forum. </s>
