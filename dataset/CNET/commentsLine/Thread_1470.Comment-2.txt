let's see you have now: sony vaio, rs420 1. wireless-g w/speed booster adapter (linksys wmp54gs) 2. a router (linksys wireless g broadband wrt54gs) 3. printer server (motorola wps870g) - 4. second printer has only ethernet port (connect this, directly to the router)... --- if you only need this printer to be networked, you don't need the print server --- question, what about the first printer??
--- and a scanner, that you want to connect wirelessly (i don't think you can do this, you need a scanner with a network/wireless capability) and you want a wireless monitor (for this, what you need is a monitor that have a wireless feature, google it.. you might find one, maybe one that used bluetooth) now, the basic connection would be: cable/dsl modem --&gt; access point/router (linksys wireless g broadband wrt54gs) ---&gt; computer and other devices, such as, printer server (motorola wps870g) --&gt; printer, network printer, etc.
first, you need to make sure your wired and/or wireless network works and function as it would.
then (if you still need it) connect your print server to the router, and install the drivers (read the manual, and follow step by step -- you may need to add port and ip address into it) then, connect the (first printer, if you like, using usb or parralel port), to the print server, and install the drivers on every computer that need it... (you need the information that you get when you install the print server, such as port name and ip address) --- remember, that the second printer, already have an ethernet port, that you connect directly to the router!!
--- i hope you get the picture of what i'm talking about.
good luck
