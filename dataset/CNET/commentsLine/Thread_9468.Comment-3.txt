thanks for your reply.
i heard other people say that it would be better to take a dual core, because the quad core is quite good at multitasking, but the dual core performs better at gaming (single application) and in this setup it has a slightly better graphics card.
then again in other topics ive been reading that intel is now slightly better with intel core 2 processors then amd.
so im getting confused and don't know what is true and or better.
