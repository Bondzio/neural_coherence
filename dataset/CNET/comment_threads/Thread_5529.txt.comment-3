dual link cables are only necessary monitors that exceed 1920x1200.
it sounds like you're using an ati clone or extend mode that is merging a single display over both monitors rather than dual displays.
reduce your resolution back to 1280x960 and check your windows display properties.
do you have 2 monitors or 1?
