&quot;where should i put files?&quot; where you can find them.
&quot;should i keep xp on the 20gb and move all my data and programs to the 120gb?
or vice versa?
any ideas on this?&quot; i just did something similar.
i used ghost2002 to copy a system from one drive to another, removed the older slower drive as a backup and made the newer faster drive as the master and wher the os is and files are.
much nicer and no big questions.
&quot;one thing i will be doing is putting old hi8 tapes through my camcorder (via firewire) so i can convert them to dvd.
i would assume i am best off transferring these to the 120gb as it is faster and larger.&quot; you'll answer this soon enough since for each 2 hour home movie (which is best limited to 1 hour, your choice), i see my temp workspace to be about 20 to 30 gb.
this question will sort itself out as you will soon realise.
&quot;but should i move anything off my old slower 20gb hd; would my system performance increase by moving everything over to the new drive?&quot; your choice.
but what i did.
&quot;oh, and how would i do any of this?
&quot; i used ghost 2002. but the drive may have come with software and instructions to do this move.
try that.
