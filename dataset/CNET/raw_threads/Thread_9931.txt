Did the drive (system) run disks normally in the past? Again a bit more information.

You need to tell more. If the CD contents show in Explorer (which is that app that fires up when you open &quot;My Computer&quot;) then we're partway there. http://store.steampowered.com/app/32370/ shows XP and Vista support only.
