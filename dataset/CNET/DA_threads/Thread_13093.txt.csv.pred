1.1.1	Hello I have recently changed hard drives as my older hard drive was too small.	St
1.1.2	I used a cloning program and it worked without a hitch.	St
1.1.3	I kept the partition between O/S and data but proportionately bigger.	St
1.1.4	Recently I lost data & want to reconnect old HD to transfer the lost data across.	St
1.1.5	unfortunately it asked for a boot disk which I don't have nor a floppy drive.	St
1.1.6	Do I need one?	St
1.1.7	Will the O/S on older HD conflict when both old & new HD are connected?	St
1.1.8	Can anyone shed some light?	Ques
1.1.9	Regards Illya PS.	St
1.1.10	O/S = XP Home Edition	St
1.2.1	Normally, there are no such problems expecially since one is a clone of the other.	St
1.2.2	Just properly slave the other drive or temporarily connect it to another IDE port until finished.	Ques
1.2.3	XP will see this as a hardware change, however, and the meter keeps running until enough of these prompt a reactivation.	St
1.3.1	Sorry.	St
1.3.2	Did I mention that I am a novice?	St
1.3.3	How do I 'properly slave the other drive or temporarily connect it to another IDE port until finished'?	Ques
1.3.4	Can you please give me a quick run down or link me to an appropriate site.	Ques
1.3.5	Either way, thank you very much for your help Steven.	Polite
1.3.6	I assume I go into 'bios' and slave it there.	St
1.3.7	Can I slave it before I connect it?	St
