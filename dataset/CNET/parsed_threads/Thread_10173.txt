<s> I have not made any changes to my computer settings nor have I installed new programs but now it is not working. </s>
<s> I am using Nero and Roxio and neither will get passed 3%. </s>

<s> I thought I could consider Verbatium or Imation pretty name brands when it comes to DVD's. </s>
<s> The thing is, these are DVD's that have ALWAYS worked on this burner until this week. </s>
<s> I will uninstall Roxio since I never use it anyway, its just a backup system incase something doesnt work, plus it was there before I bought Nero. </s>
<s> I will try this and update if I still have problems. </s>
