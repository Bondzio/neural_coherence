<s> I have been using my new custom built PC for a while now and it worked fine. </s>
<s> Recently, I removed some broken sata-IDE connectors and molex power from unused CD/DVD drives and hard drives, so theres just the main hard drive and DVD drive on an IDE cable. </s>
<s> I turned the computer on, and it won't boot into bios. </s>
<s> I tried resetting bios, then it says _QS training failed on previous boot, reverted to lower VRAM speed, press f1 to resume. </s>
<s> (first character is cut off by edge of the screen, even if I move it to the right). </s>
<s> I press f1, and it says detecting master and slave IDE disks which works fine, then CMOS checksum bad CMOS time/data not set, press f1 to enter setup. </s>
<s> I do this and set the time and data and everything, save changes and exit, then it reboots and wont come up with bios unless I reset it again. </s>
<s> Any ideas how to solve this problem? </s>
<s> I need to sort this out fairly quickly. </s>
<s> I have not done any bios updates. </s>
<s> This sounds like an abused system. </s>
<s> When we see that we know all bets are off that boards are any good. </s>
<s> We'll replace the boards with the broken parts (new motherboard if need be) to bring the machine back to life. </s>

<s> Its a brand new motherboard, I have never touched any of the components on ir and I always wear an anti static wrist band. </s>
<s> The sata-IDE convertors are broken because they are cheap ones from hong kong, and even the ones that do &quot;work&quot; dont actually convert sata-IDE, so I simply removed them all. </s>
<s> Now that it has a warranty it's time to use it. </s>
<s> But I wonder what the real problems are. </s>
<s> The post was very unclear with notes about broken stuff which I took to be as something an abusive owner might do to their machine. </s>
<s> We see those at the shop all the time with hammer marks on cases or when the owner &quot;kicked the machine to make it start.&quot; -&gt; We know that bad IDE devices can stop a machine from showing the BIOS screen so it looks like you have bad components to remove still. </s>

<s> yeah looks like its a deffective motherboard then. </s>
<s> I have had some previous troubles with it too, Im pretty sure its nothing to do with the sata-ide connectors and the actual sata connectors on the motherboard because it dosent recognise a sata card reader either, or my 22 shop bought sata-ide converter. </s>
<s> I tried looking at recovering a corrupted bios and reinstalling it online, but you have to boot it from a floppy and the only computer that has a floppy drive is the broken one. </s>
<s> If they do decide to not give me a refund, you can buy just the motherboard online for about 40. </s>
<s> They also supplied me with an insufficient CPU fan, it was only doing 2900RPM max and it even said in the booklet recommended minimum 4800, so I got a 6000RPM fan and i works fine. </s>
<s> Even on the box it shows an aluminium fan, and they gave me a cheap plastic one. </s>
