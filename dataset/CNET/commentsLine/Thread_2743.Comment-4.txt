the bios issue is so pervasive that the first thing i do with a new motherboard is to update the bios.
let me excuse myself from telling all the reasons and the problems that ensue from this outdated item.
some shops will not update the bios since they just push product.
as to the hard disk.
if it's dead, its dead.
just be sure the bios is current since some will call an over 127gb drive non-existant and some will not try cable select on the drive on the 80 conductor cable.
looks like a rushed out the door system.
