i have a pressario sr5410f and it will only start evry 20 or 30 times i press the start button.
when it does not start i do not get a post beep, or get into the bios...just nothing, then every once and a while it will just start up.
when it does i get the resume windows screen, it reboots and then won't start again.
i have checked the following: -power supply (checked on a tester and swapped out for different one) -ram (ran memory test - aok) -ran hdd test - everyting aok -removed and replaced cpu with new thermal grease could it be the motherboard, if so how do i check?
also if i do replace the motherboard will any uatx 775 board work as the compaq one, if i can find it is about 250.00...not worth repairing.
any ideas on my next step would be greatly appreciated.
thanks sean
