<s> I have two short throw projectors which are used for presentations. </s>
<s> I would like to convert these to wireless to allow flexible positioning of the presenters laptop. </s>
<s> Connections I have available are USB B, S-video and VGA. </s>
<s> I was thinking of a USB B wireless adapter or USB B to USB A and a USB A wireless adapter not sure if any of these would work. </s>
<s> Any advise is appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> So I have to ask if they are sure they want to spend that many thousand bucks. </s>
<s> There is another way with VeeBeam which isn't as hard on the budget. </s>
