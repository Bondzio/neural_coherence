let's (repeat) a few common mistakes and a troubleshooting method i use with great success.
1. the motherboard mounting.
a high percentage of new dead pc builds find an extra mounting stud on the backside of the motherboard.
this in the best scenario just causes the machine to do nothing.
at worst it fries the board.
2. the jumpers and cables.
it's no fault of the home builder but occasionally you'll find an error on the documentation.
i was burnt on this so i always try it with all ide and other cables, cards unplugged so see if it's something simple.
3. finally the 4 item test.
place the psu, motherboard, speaker and the cpu with it's hsf on a piece of cardboard.
no other parts!
power up and it should beep in protest.
this is the beep test.
if it fails then you are looking at the 1 to 4 bad parts.
