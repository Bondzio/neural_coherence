...mr814 (b).
as i said in a post above, surfing was fine, but accessing my network was just too slow.
think i'll look online for an 80.11g wap just for surfing purposes on my laptop.
in the meantime, i'll stay hard-wired, and drag the 50 foot cat line from living room to bedroom, lol.
thanks for input.
