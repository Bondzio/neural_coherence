i called off the ubuntu memory check at 5 hours with no results that i could discern.
i swapped the two sticks, and used each one individually, but whenever the new one was in there i still got blue-screen errors and immediate shutdowns; so quick i couldn't read all it said.
but everything i did read, there and in event viewer, pointed to a ram problem, so it's being returned for exchange.
a useful memory tester would still be nice, but in this case i didn't have to tax my brain to figure out what the problem was.
simple problem-solving techniques usually work well.
