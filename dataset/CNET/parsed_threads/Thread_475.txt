<s> I have a desktop that has Adobe Creative Suite CS3 on it, and I am no longer using that desktop. </s>
<s> I have a new laptop, but I lost the installation discs for the software. </s>
<s> I was wondering if I could remove the hard drive from the desktop, treat it as an external hard drive for the laptop and run Adobe Creative Suite from there. </s>
<s> If possible, this will save me a lot of money not having to buy the software again. </s>
<s> I imagine that I would have to change some settings somehow since the desktop boots from that hard drive, but this is getting into territory that I am almost clueless about so I would appreciate any assistance helping me do this, if it is possible. </s>
<s> My desktop is running Windows XP Professional. </s>
<s> My laptop is running Windows 7 64-bit. </s>
<s> If more information is needed, please let me know. </s>
<s> THANK YOU!! </s>

<s> Cheap compared to the alternative. </s>
