<s> Hello everyone, I'm in the process of configuring my first custom build. </s>
<s> This system will be used for 3d graphics. </s>
<s> I hope to configure a system that will be able to be upgraded with newer parts as prices fall in the future. </s>
<s> I can't justify spending more than $1100. </s>
<s> Can you computer gurus out there have a quick look and let me know if I am mismatching. </s>
<s> OR, if you have any suggestions, I am more than happy and greatful to know what you think. </s>
<s> Thanks allot guys! </s>

<s> You might want to look at the Hd 7870. </s>
<s> Seems to be a little more &quot;bang for the buck&quot; </s>
<s> I'm really interested in CUDA tech but not completely married to it. </s>
<s> The only other thing that gives me trepidation on the 7870 are the user comments about it not being recognized by the mobo. </s>
<s> This is my first build so I am kind of nervous about the assembly stage. </s>
