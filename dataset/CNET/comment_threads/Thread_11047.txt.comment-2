If your second router can be configured as an access point, that should work.
It would need to be wired to your other router and get it's IP address from it.
An access point is, in a sense, like a wireless switch.
You're laptop negotiates a connection to it and then gets its IP address from the router.
If either router allows a WAP mode, you should be ok.
