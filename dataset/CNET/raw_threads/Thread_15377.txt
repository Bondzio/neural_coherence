I ve got a Shuttle SFF system that I plan on using as a DVR, and I m not sure what TV Tuner to get. The pc is going to be displayed on my Panasonic TH-42PD50U, and I will be using a DVI-HDMI connection from a Geforce 68oo Vid card. While the TV is not a true HDTV (its ED) I want to get the best picture possible. Looking for some advice or advice from people with experience in this area. Thanks much for your help.
