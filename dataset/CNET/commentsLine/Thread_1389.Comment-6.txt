yes, life goes on.
but with me, computers are very difficult.
i want something a little better but wondering if i realy need it.
i know i need a new hd but again, you mentioned i need a new usb2.
as i only have two usb1 with a hub.
so there are things i should upgrade and i think i will upgrade as with another hd and a new usb port.
thanks
