1.1.1	Hi i 'm really just looking for something better than what I have and not insanely pricey , but I am looking for something good .	St
1.1.2	The Graphics card that I have now is a Sapphire Radeon X1550 64-Bit 256M and something better , I just do n't know what would be good .	St
1.1.3	I basically use 3D art design software like DAZ 3D and Photoshop , also I watch a good amount of video .	St
1.1.4	Not much gaming involved but it can happen .	St
1.1.5	If you have any advice on how I can make my PC better PLEASE let me know .	Ques
1.1.6	Computer Specs : Motherboard Name	St
1.2.1	I 'm just a consumer , not a computer geek .	St
1.2.2	You can have a look at the benchmark test results which will tell you what cards are & quot ; better & quot ; .	St
1.2.3	http : //www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpu_list.php Whether getting a more powerful card would be noticeably better for you , I 'm not sure .	St
1.2.4	I 've got computers with old hardware and computers with & quot ; good & quot ; graphics .	St
1.2.5	I 'm sure there is a difference & quot ; under the hood & quot ; but for everyday things , I ca n't really tell the difference .	St
1.2.6	Hopefully , it would make a difference for your photoshop and art design .	St
1.2.7	The extent of the improvement might be impacted by your processor .	St
1.2.8	Also , what type of monitor do you have ?	Ques
1.2.9	A mediocre monitor might not give you the results you want from a better video card .	Sug
1.2.10	I 'd start with the cards available at your local computer shop at a price you like the look of , then check it on the benchmarks ranking and then google some reviews and see what the reviewers have to say .	St
1.2.11	You might also be better off looking for a secondhand card .	St
1.3.1	W7 and 1GB of ram might not play nice .	St
1.3.2	Perhaps a little help in that area .	St
1.3.3	http : //www.crucial.com/index.aspx Video .	St
1.3.4	Here 's a little chart ... .you can see where you are and what 's better .	St
1.3.5	http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-radeon-hd-geforce-gtx,2676-7.html	St
1.4.1	as though your system has integrated video .	St
1.4.2	That means it uses some of your system RAM ( only 1GB ) for video .	St
1.4.3	So bottom line ... .you 've only got 1GB of system RAM ( too little in my opinion ) and some of it perhaps up to 256MB is being used for video .	St
1.4.4	My suggestion ... try adding system RAM to bring your system up to a total of at least 2GB or budget permitting , 4GB .	Sug
1.4.5	If you want more speed , then look at some of the video options offered ... .just keep in mind you system PSU must provide enough power , watts and AMPs , for the video card you select .	St
1.4.6	Let us know how it turns out .	St
1.4.7	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	thanks to all of you , and also my monitor is a ViewSonic VA930m [ 19 & quot ; LCD ] screen , oh and uh maybe i sound a little stupid but , im not sure if system RAM is what i 've been adding or not .	St
1.5.2	See originally the computer came with 512 mgb 's , but i added in two more 256mb memory cards , and since i see no other slots im guessing that its the SYSTEM RAM , but I had no idea Memory Cards costed so much , i can get them cheap for 10 bucks a gig .	St
1.5.3	and I 'm possibly getting 3 one gigabyte cards so maybe if i can get that my system will run better .	St
1.5.4	Also i 've downloaded Directx 11.0 to my system so i 'm thinking it should make a difference .	St
1.5.5	And to VAPCMD : If I add the memory , will it automatically upgrade the amount of memory used for video ?	Ques
1.5.6	Another Problem , Maybe the reason I ca n't run DAZ 3D on my PC is because I 'm missing the Multimedia Controller and the Multimedia Video Controller , but I ca n't find out where to download them free	St
1.6.1	permits .	St
1.6.2	Adding 2 1GB DIMMs in place the 2-256MB DIMMS would help considerably but will not add to your video RAM unless it can be allocated to video RAM thru the system BIOS .	St
1.6.3	Your system can not run efficiently on 768MBs of RAM ( 1024 MBs - 256MBs for video ram ) as you 're currently running .	St
1.6.4	See how that does first and then if a separate video card ( GPU ) is still needed , then explore those options as recommended above at Tomshardware.com .	St
1.6.5	The only caution is to make sure your power supply ( PSU ) is powerful enough to support the new video card as the higher end cards are power hungry too .	St
1.6.6	Let us know how it works out .	St
1.6.7	VAPCMD	St
