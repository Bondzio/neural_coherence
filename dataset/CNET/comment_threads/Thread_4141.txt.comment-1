When using my laptops in the other end of the building from the present router, the wireless is disconnected, and signal is zero, because of many walls in between.
Rather than spending on wireless extenders, or repeaters, or antennas, I thought of plugging in a second dsl modem into the phone outlet in that other end of the building.
This means I would need to buy a second router for that second setup.
So, is there such a thing as a combo modem/wireless router available, that I can just plug a cable into the phone outlet (like a conventional dsl modem), and then 4 wired connections to computers from the same combo unit, plus getting the wireless capability?
Sorry for this wordy description.
If any info, would appreciate links to some vendors or models.
Thanks.
