1.1.1	I have a HP D7160 .	St
1.1.2	It 's indicated for a few weeks that the ( icon ) needs to be replaced soon .	St
1.1.3	All ink colors are represented by icons , and nowhere is the color spelled out .	St
1.1.4	I finally replaced it with a brand new , boxed , sealed HP ink cartridge bought at CVS .	St
1.1.5	It then said something about a previously used cartridge .	St
1.1.6	I was blown away !	St
1.1.7	It does seem to be working almost normally now .	St
1.1.8	None of the other ink indicators showed that any other cartridge was anywhere near low in the last two months .	St
1.1.9	I do little printing .	St
1.1.10	Now it says that the following cartridge is now depleted - and displays an icon with no color - the inside of the icon is white , as the background color of the printer display is white .	St
1.1.11	I can not get any response at all on the HP site .	St
1.1.12	Anyone here have a clue about this ?	Ques
1.2.1	If & quot ; previously used & quot ; this might be a third party cartridge , not an original HP one .	St
1.2.2	But you forgot to say when it said something , what that it is and what exactly it said .	St
1.2.3	I 've never met a speaking cartridge .	St
1.2.4	If that 's the case indeed , HP wo n't support it .	St
1.2.5	Back to CVS then .	St
1.2.6	Kees	St
1.3.1	This may sound strange but I have seen similar situations with HP printers when cartridges are changed , generally with all-in one units .	St
1.3.2	Try reloading the software , uninstall then reinstall , if that does n't do the trick then go to the HP site and see if there is an update for that unit .	St
1.3.3	Where issues arose , some years back , was the transition from Win XP to Vista and now of course Win 7 .	St
1.3.4	The D7160 is not a new unit and as I recall had software bundled compatible with Win XP , so unless you have done an update and are running against Vista or Win 7 you may have some issues .	St
1.4.1	Well , there are & quot ; intell i/c & quot ; abroad the ink carts nowadays .	St
1.4.2	It knows when its been changed but you should as you already know proceed foward .	St
1.4.3	It will a nagging sorta thing until it too is empty .	St
1.4.4	I do n't see any way around this as its part of the overall setup by HP and other makers .	St
1.4.5	While , I suspect the ink displayed is really low its not entirely empty so you can use whatever is left the next until it actually registers empty or wo n't go any further .	St
1.4.6	The warning usually refers to a level ( 20 % ) left in the ink cart , maybe more .	St
1.4.7	Also , do n't prioceed after installing a new ink cart the install process or & quot ; align .	St
1.4.8	one & quot ; so it can work at its best .	St
1.4.9	That too is a nagging condition if not worked on .	St
1.4.10	tada -- -- Willy	St
