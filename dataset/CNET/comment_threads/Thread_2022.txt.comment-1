Hi there, Ever so often my computer would not boot.
When I press the on button the fans would start, the motherboard lights would go on and thats it- no beep, no spinning HDD.
And the light on my webcam woulb be constantly on.
When I press the power button for a few seconds the computer switches off but the webcam still shows the light.
However, when I unplug and plugin the power cable again-everything would boot up o.K.
without any alert messages.
How can I solve this problem?
The computer is home build.
