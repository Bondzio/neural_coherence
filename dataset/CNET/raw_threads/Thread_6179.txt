In XP (not XP SP1 or later) the USB speed is version 1.0 or low speed. USB 2.0 speed was not enabled till later. Why are you at XP and not updated? Is there a reason? Also, given no make, model and more of such listed in your post, I can check on things. --&gt; It is worth noting that Web cams are notorious for missing drivers. It's a common problem to find an owner that has a web cam with no make/model and for them to ask for help getting it to work. You know to nod and hope they figure it out. Bob

The problem is not for specified web cam, any web cam doesn't work with network usb modem in the old pc. And the web cam working with usb modem in other pcs. Thanks

We have found SP3 to correct again USB issues along with all the drivers you hunt down for the motherboard and more. If you can't find the make/model of everything I understand. bob

And SP3 is one of the known things I've done to bring USB up to working again. As you have worked with many machines, by now you can see that supplied the above, not much can be offered. Bob
