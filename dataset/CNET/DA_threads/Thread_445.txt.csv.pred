1.1.1	i want to build a computer.can someone let me know a good source to buy everything ? or is it better to buy each item from different places on each peice of hardware ?	Ques
1.1.2	thanks , edward	Polite
1.2.1	First , we will assume you 've done your homework , have decided on which components to buy , and are just looking for the best way to buy .	St
1.2.2	Way 1 ) : Log in to pricewatch.com amd get the lowest price period for that item .	St
1.2.3	Make sure , however , that you are really getting the model you want .	St
1.2.4	Lots of vendors substitute keywords and letters that mean a lot ... an SE is n't an XT , etc .	St
1.2.5	Double check before ordering .	St
1.2.6	Most items will be OEM or bare ( bare HDD 's actually have a longer warranty thean retail box ! )	St
1.2.7	there 's nothing wrong with that , they will come w/ drivers .	St
1.2.8	Always get a mobo in retail box .	St
1.2.9	Lowest price is your winner , but trust your gut .	St
1.2.10	This way is the most fun , as pieces trickle in from all over and you do pay bottom dollar .	St
1.2.11	TIP : One place to NOT scrimp is RAM , unless you 're just building a number-cruncher .	St
1.2.12	For power users , there really will be a difference , stick with Brand names like Corsiar , Crucial or Kingston .	St
1.2.13	1GB is minimum , ( 2 ) -512MB has a lower latency than ( 1 ) -1GB stick .	St
1.2.14	Way 2 ) : Buy everything in one place , like newegg.com .	St
1.2.15	This is the way I 'm headed more & more , as the slight cost difference is worth the convenience .	St
1.2.16	There 's a few things they do n't carry , and I 've had to go elsewhere for pieces , but I usually give these guys the meat of ny order .	St
1.2.17	Really easy checkout too .	St
1.2.18	Good luck & email me if you have any problems or questions !	Polite

1.3.1	I 've never bought stuff from online , but Ihear Newegg is pretty good THeres this store called NCIX ( I think it 's located in Canada though ) that is also pretty good .	St
1.4.1	i bought the vase majority of my current builds parts from them and had no problems whatsoever .	St
1.4.2	delivery time was extremely quick too .	St
1.4.3	i ordered a few flash drives first to test them out and since i used the budget shipping i figured it 'd be a week or 2 before stuff showed up .	St
1.4.4	i think it was 5 days later i got home from class and they had arrived so they are very quick when it comes to getting stuff to you .	St
1.5.1	THANKS for the replies ! !	St
1.5.2	i am going to check out the newegg .	St
1.5.3	Edward	St
1.6.1	the fedex shipping is almost unbelievably good .	St
1.6.2	I always get the item one day before the date in the original fedex tracking info .	St
1.6.3	Many other places give a low price and steal from you with the shipping cost .	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
1.8.1	Newegg has an & quot ; expedited shipping & quot ; for $ 2.99 that 's for suckers only , I 've NEVER used that and still get my parts within 3-4 days .	St
1.8.2	I do n't see how they could do it faster , unless they do them in their sleep !	St
1.8.3	Always choose the least-expensive shipping method , unless it 's an emergency .	St
1.9.1	Newegg is good for SOME parts , but I 've found their shipping a little pricier than ChiefValue .	St
1.9.2	Both are EXCELLENT , however .	St
1.9.3	Everything I 've ordered from them ( RAM , speakers , video card , etc . )	St
1.9.4	has arrived at least 1 day earlier than the FedEx expected delivery date .	St
1.9.5	Tip : Newegg is cheaper on sound cards at the lower end , but ChiefValue is cheaper on the higher end ones ( and usually they have free FedEx shipping ! )	St
1.9.6	Also , compare them , since they seem to be in direct competition with one another .	St
1.9.7	( Some mornings one will have a monitor on sale and when I check the other , the exact monitor is also on sale ! )	St
1.9.8	RAM is usually cheaper at ChiefValue and Video cards , I 've found , are less expensive at Newegg .	St
1.9.9	Like another poster stated , if you 're looking at pricewatch.com , pay CLOSE attention - I 've noticed some model numbers advertised are n't the same ones when you visit the seller 's web site .	St
1.9.10	Good luck and have fun !	Polite
1.9.11	Graham	St
1.10.1	Well , I agree that NewEgg has pretty good deals , but I would avoid ChiefValue !	St
1.10.2	I ordered a monitor from them last month and received an email receipt for a much higher price than what was advertised .	St
1.10.3	I told them to either cancel the order or charge the advertised price .	St
1.10.4	They told me that they could change their prices whenever they want , and they ignored my request to cancel the order .	St
1.10.5	Since then they 've somehow disappeared and not responded to any of my emails .	St
1.11.1	... about ChiefValue .	St
1.11.2	I 've never had a problem , but I 'll pay close attention when ordering ( like I always do ) based on your comments .	St
1.11.3	Ciao , Graham	St
1.12.1	You have received some good advice , and practically everyone ( including me ) in these forums who have had dealings with Newegg have good results .	St
1.12.2	I have read some time back of only one slight complaint , and that was them charging a 'restocking fee ' on a certain item , but just about everyone charges a 'restocking fee ' on certain returned items .	St
1.12.3	About buying ''OEM '' .	St
1.12.4	There may be a longer warranty on certain OEM hard drives , but I always advise people who are new at buying mail order , installing parts , and not familiar with OEM parts to buy ''RETAIL '' boxed .	St
1.12.5	When you see something that is indicated as ''White Box '' or ''Bulk '' it is normally ''OEM '' .	St
1.12.6	OEM ( original equipment manufacture ) parts may be made for a specific computer company like Dell , HP , Emachine , and others that may have given specific paramenters/specifications of what they want in the items construction , or the OEM may have cut corners in selling the OEM bulk parts .	St
1.12.7	The OEM factory that actually makes the part may advertise their product commercially and sell it as ''RETAIL '' , while making and selling an OEM version to a factory ( or distributor getting ahold of OEM ) that is not exactly like the 'Retail ' .	St
1.12.8	Also , on OEM versions you may not get instructions or manuals as the factory receiving the OEM item already knows and do n't need .	St
1.12.9	I recall ordering a computer around 6 years ago from Dell that advertised a certain Voodoo Video Card with certain features .	St
1.12.10	When the PC arrived , the Voodoo Video Card was the right one ordered but did n't have the feature that was advertised by the Voodoo manufacturer , or Dell .	St
1.12.11	I telephone Voodoo and finally talked to a engineer who told me that the particular OEM card that they shipped to Dell did n't have the feature that they advertise on their Retail card .	St
1.12.12	Telephoning Dell and finally reaching a buyer representative of Dell parts ( you could do that in those days ) , he was totally unaware that the particular OEM Voodoo Card lacked the advertised feature .	St
1.12.13	Well , Dell almost immediately modified their Voodoo advertisements .	St
1.12.14	They sent a truck out to my house and picked up my computer as they could n't give me the video card features I wanted .	St
1.12.15	I received a full $ $ refund and no charge for shipping/handling either way ( they charged in those days ) .	St
1.12.16	When consumer VHS/Betamax cassette video recorders and camcorders came out is when I first heard about OEM , White Box , Bulk , vs Retail .	St
1.12.17	Some mail order stores were selling them as OEM , White Box , Bulk , and when customers received them they were Japanese packed with instructions/manuals in Japanese and the units were set with switchable non US electricity and 50 cycle .	St
1.13.1	NIL	St
1.14.1	You will find that newegg seams to be the winner most of the time .	St
1.14.2	I have used tirgerdirect and Fry 's outpost and computer gate , but I start with newwgg .	St
1.14.3	Have you ever built one before ? ? ?	Ques
1.14.4	If not repost and I 'll post some links that will be helpfull .	St
