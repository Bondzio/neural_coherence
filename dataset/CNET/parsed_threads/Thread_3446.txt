<s> I bought Norton Antivirus 2004. </s>
<s> When I installed it on my emachines 667 with 192 mgs of ram, it started removing viruses automaticly which I thought was a good thing untill I found out that a lot of the apps on my computer wouldn't work anymore. </s>
<s> I ended up having to reformat to get my computer to work again. </s>
<s> So I thought I'd install the antivirus software first thing since thioreticlly there wouldn't be any viruses on my computer. </s>
<s> It still started removing &quot;viruses&quot; and things wouldn't work again and I had to reformat again. </s>
<s> How can this software do me any good if it disables my most used software in the process of doing what it does? </s>
<s> One of the viruses that it removed when I installed it right after reformating was called &quot;Stator&quot;. </s>
<s> How could there be a virus on my factory installed software. </s>
<s> After reformating that was all that was on my &quot;C&quot; drive. </s>
<s> I do have a &quot;D&quot; slave hard drive, but the apps that it was disabling were on the &quot;C&quot; drive. </s>
<s> The slave drive has mostly music files on it. </s>
<s> I can't use my antivirus software untill I find out how to install it and still have a functional computer. </s>
<s> Has anyone had a similir experience? </s>
<s> Does anyone know the solution to this problem? </s>
<s> I would appreciate any feedback anyone can give me. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Given the over 70% thumbs down at http://www.download.com/Norton-AntiVirus-2004/3000-2239-10223639.html I continually am surprised that people try their luck with the 2004 version. </s>
<s> Please don't expect me to fix Symantec's mess. </s>
<s> In fact, I see no indication you called Symantec. </s>
<s> What I would do? </s>
<s> If I have an application that fails I uninstall and reinstall it. </s>
<s> For me, this is easy. </s>
<s> Others may need help. </s>
<s> As to the 2004 version, my advice is &quot;get a refund&quot; and get any other AV other than McAfee. </s>
<s> Again, you are not alone with this issue, but it's clear that 2004 is not a good year for Symantec. </s>

<s> like Norton was removing Spyware. </s>
<s> Some programs that contain Spyware will not operate if the Spyware is removed. </s>
<s> These programs are the &quot;freebies&quot; that you install from the net. </s>
<s> That's why they are free. </s>
<s> Your choice: Get the full featured program and pay for it. </s>
