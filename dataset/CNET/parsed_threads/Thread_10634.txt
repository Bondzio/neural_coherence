<s> I have a new Samsung T409 cell phone and for three weeks I have tried everything to try and get it to connect to my MI424WR Actiontec Router from Verizon FIOS. </s>
<s> I keep getting messages like: Can't connect error W002, W003, W004, etc. </s>
<s> I upgraded the router firmware today, still no luck. </s>
<s> Can anyone out there help? </s>
<s> Any ideas of what to try next? </s>

<s> 1. </s>
<s> Set it up per our forum sticky and then try it without the security. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Be sure the router is set to support MIXED MODE. </s>
<s> That is 802.11b devices. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi Bob, thanks but it is already set to mixed mode. </s>
<s> I have tired most things. </s>
<s> I think it must be something very technical. </s>
<s> Do you have any other ideas, anyone, of what could be causing this. </s>
<s> I also took off the WEP key and went unsecured and it still wouldn't work. </s>
<s> Jesseelev </s>
<s> Yes, it's very technical. </s>
<s> Leaving your wifi set to wep could have some one hijack that connection and SPOOF the mac address of your device that won't connect. </s>
<s> The next step is to change the SSID and move directly to WPA-PSK to lock them out. </s>
<s> Remember I have only a few details to work with so share if you did another often than latest firmware, mixed mode, SSID broadcasting, WPA... Good luck, Bob </s>
<s> Hi again, Bob, I dont think it has anything to do with WEP. </s>
<s> Here are some other things I tried: I turned the Actiontec wireless off and connected a Linksys router to the Actiontec router, and saw the new Linksys network on the phone and it still wouldn't connect. </s>
<s> I changed the channel on the router to match channel on the phone. </s>
<s> I changed the phone from dynamic to static and put in the IP, subnet mask, DNS, and default gateway manually and it still didnt work. </s>
<s> I &quot;enabled&quot; the phone on the router access list (although I did not add the other devices Mac addresses, just the phone. </s>
<s> Is this a problem?) </s>
<s> I lowered the transmission rate down from 54 to 1 (trying different speeds.) </s>
<s> I upgraded the firmware (which the Actiontec guy said would resolve the problem and didn't) I have been reluctant to do too many radical things with the router for fear of losing my wireless network completely, which works like a charm, except for the phone. </s>
<s> When I test the IP address with a ping it says: Status: Test Failed Packets: 4/4 transmitted, 0/4 received, 100% loss However, all the laptops (3) on the network are working fine. </s>
<s> This remains unchecked: Allow Other Network Users to Control Wireless Broadband Router's Network Features So does this remain uchecked: Allow Other Network Users to Control Wireless Broadband Router's Network Feature Mac Cloning is set to Ethernet even though it is connected by Coaxial. </s>
<s> (dont understand this.) </s>
<s> Can you tell me what this may mean from the system log: Dec 25 01:22:25 2007 </s>
<s> Does it connect at any hotspot anywhere. </s>
<s> Usually and if I can connect at home using the setups we note in our forum note we usually skip trying at home and head out to a hotspot with a laptop and the device in tow. </s>
<s> We connect with the laptop just to be sure the area works and then try the device. </s>
<s> Hope this helps but I'm offline soon so recheck our forum sticky note. </s>
<s> If you use any other setting in your router than stock and what we write about please share. </s>

<s> I have a Samsung Katalyst (Wifi) with T-Mobile...worked great until I got FIOS installed the other day. </s>
<s> I worked for hours...finally I did connect my Linksys as a secondary wireless through the LAN on the Actiontec Router....I did get closer to fixing the problem.....But now when I call out connected through the router...they can hear me...but I can't hear them on the phone. </s>
<s> My son however, can send and receive texts. </s>
<s> I'm sure our problems are quite similar. </s>
<s> Did you ever get your system to work correctly? </s>
<s> Has anyone with this phone been able to connect to a router? </s>
<s> I've tried the same things as jesseelev and haven't had any luck connecting this phone to my Linksys WRT54G. </s>
<s> There must be something beyond the user settings that is blocking the connection. </s>
<s> It does work at HotSpots, but have yet to get it to connect to any other unsecure wi-fi network. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help you can offer. </s>
<s> make you wireless router settings like the Forum Sticky suggests, then you should have no problems connecting. </s>
<s> Rick </s>
<s> Did everything the forum sticky says and still doesn't work. </s>
<s> i'm cancelling the service. </s>
<s> maybe in a year they will have all the kinks fixed. </s>
<s> We have tried everything to get our Samsung Katalyst phones to work in our house which is equipped with Verizon Fios wi-fi. </s>
<s> After - LITERALLY - HOURS on the land-line phone with BOTH Verizon and T-Mobile, our wi-fi has NEVER WORKED with these phones. </s>
<s> And that's the only reason we bought them in the first place. </s>
<s> GR-R-R-R-R-RRRRRRRR!!!! </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> If you google up the Actiontec name you find unhappy stories. </s>
<s> We went to T-Mobile store and told them we were disgusted that we bought these phones for the wi-fi at home and it didn't work... and they gave us 2 routers (NO CHARGE) - one for home and one for our daughter to take back to college (where hers didn't work either) and... </s>
<s> ta-da!!! </s>
<s> Wi-fi at home...SUCCESS!!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Try changing your FIOS router with a standard DLINK, Netgear or Linksys router. </s>
<s> My Samsung Katalyst T-Mobile phone works fine with wifi with my Dlink WBR 2310 router(switched to DLINK DIR 625 and it still works). </s>
<s> If the FIOS router is in only wireless G/N mode or in WPA2 mode, your samsung won't connect. </s>
<s> The FIOS router must also be broadcasting SSID. </s>
<s> Good Luck! </s>
<s> Did you ever figure out how to connect to WIFI with the Katalyst. </s>
<s> We had a Belkin G router and we had the same problem. </s>
<s> We could call using WIFI and the person we called could hear us, but we could not hear them. </s>
<s> Now we got a D-Link DIR-615 and we cannot even get connected. </s>
<s> Now a clue as to the problem. </s>
<s> Its very frustrating because Samsung and T-mobile know nothing either, nor does their manual help. </s>
