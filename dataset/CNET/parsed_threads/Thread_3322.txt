<s> i have a WD1200JB, C drive and a 40gig D, problem is local properties shows only 40G in the C, so i can't access the balance, although the proper recognition is shown in &quot;hardware&quot; ... is there a fix? </s>
<s> To me it appears you want to run the Disk Management tool in Windows XP and use that space for another drive by making the remainder space a partition and formatting that new space. </s>
<s> Unless you think there is a hardware issue here I'd just prepare the unused space and start using it. </s>

<s> look under DISK MANAGEMENT and see if you see 'unallocated space' on drive 0. </s>
<s> The fix ... you could create a new partition in the unallocated space, wipe drive 0 and start all over creating the partitions or buy a product like Partition Magic or Disk Director which would allow you to 'expand' drive C to the full capacity. </s>
<s> The options are endless...these are the probably the most common. </s>
<s> Should you choose using PM or DD ...you should backup your data to minimize the risk of data loss. </s>
