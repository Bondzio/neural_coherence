Changed from Comcast to ATT/Yahoo DSL but it still has Comcast on the top of the browser window....&quot;Microsoft Internet Explorer presented by Comcast&quot;. I've searched files and folders and everything is deleted that I had from Comcast. Why is it still on there? I'm confused! Any suggestions? Thanks! Lucy

Just type gpedit.msc in the run dialog box. Expand the User Configuration node in the Group Policy console on left. Select Browser User Interface and then in the right pane double-click Browser Title. In the dialog box that opens, select the &quot;Customize Title Bars&quot; check box and type whatever you want.
