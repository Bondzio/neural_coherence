1.1.1	I just bought this great tablet a couple weeks ago .	St
1.1.2	I was just getting everything set up , apps , games , news , shopping , etc ... and while I was playing solitare I picked up the nook in my hand and it was real hot on the back panel , , , seconds later it shut itself off and it aint starting anymore , is it toast ?	Ques
1.1.3	I hope this is covered by warranty , , , , , any opinions ?	Ques
1.2.1	I would go for a full refund and try some other system .	St
1.2.2	Barnes and Noble tried but it 's hard to get traction in the market .	St
1.2.3	I think there are many other fine choices .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	24 hours later I had tried charging it and the whole time the nook charge light just glowed green , even thou it should have been orange first , so I tried one last time to restart it , , , pressed the on tab for about 15 seconds instead of usual 4 or 5. it came on , , best I can figure , , I had been activating apps from Nook , and I get the feeling they want you to do them one at a time , , they say the tablet will pick up the app in about a half hour , , , I had tried to get about 3 in that time , so Im thinking that might have been too much info coming to the tablet , so for now its been working great all day , and I dont have to toss $ 120 , in the trash .

1.4.1	That 's not that bad a deal .	Polite
1.4.2	But if it fails for you and is defective I did n't write to toss it but to go for a refund .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	If Id have bought it at Walmart , I would have returned it , exchange for another , , , but returning something thru an internet purchase is not my idea of fun , LOL so I got lucky , & quot ; This Time & quot ; and theres 1 less & quot ; refurb & quot ; out there .	St
