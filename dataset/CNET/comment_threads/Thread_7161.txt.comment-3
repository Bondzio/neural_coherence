...I have owned the comp for over a year.
The radeon card was worth i think he said like $400-$500 new, and the audigy card is im gonna guess worth at least $100.
The comp worked for about 2 weeks while i owned it; worked great too.
The fan was on the sliding door that went out.
Also, I THINK that it is a 2000, b/c it isnt shaped like the ones of today....I wish i knew more on the subject really.
