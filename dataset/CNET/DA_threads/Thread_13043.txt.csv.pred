1.2.2	Find the make/model of your & quot ; Gigabyte Athlon/Duron compatible motherboard & quot ; , go to the web site and check out their manuals or web pages on that motherboard to see what CPU 's will fit .	St
1.2.3	2 .	St
1.2.4	256 is usually enough , but gamers will want the 512MB for 98 .	St
1.2.5	Be aware that this will not increase the fixed space 64 thousand byte memory pools called RESOURCES .	St

1.3.2	support website for two things ; the latest tech .	St
1.3.3	specs .	St
1.3.4	and any bios updates which should allow the greatest selection for the newer cpus .	St
1.3.5	As for memory , that should be a easy one , just buy the same type of ram module and install , that is unless you got some weird setup .	St
1.3.6	Offhand , i say you can upgrade the cpu at least to AMD2200-XP type .	St
1.3.7	Again , the bios update *may* allow better cpu installs .	St
1.3.8	etc .	St
1.3.9	just be sure to know what any bios update does .	St
1.3.10	Always backup before the update and follow the instructions exactly , you have 1-chance to succeed .	St
1.3.11	Also , use the manual bios update process , do n't try the & quot ; online & quot ; process its more open to possible glitches .	St
1.3.12	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
