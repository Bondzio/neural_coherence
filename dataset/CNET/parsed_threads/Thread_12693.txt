<s> I have windows xp with IE6 sp2 installed. </s>
<s> Every once in awhile, while trying to access abc.com, while the site page is still loading, for some reason, it completely shuts down my IE page. </s>
<s> After a few attempts, the page will load and I am good to go. </s>
<s> This morning after 10 times of this happening, I thought I would try to get an answer in this forum as to why this is happening. </s>
<s> This is the only site that does this. </s>
<s> I know I know, as the doctor would say, then don't do that anymore LOL....I would appreciate any help, thanks, sitnpritee </s>
<s> That web page is pretty video intensive as it usually has two or three animations running at the same time. </s>
<s> What are the specs of your computer, CPU, Graphics and RAM mainly. </s>
<s> Also do you do any maintenance such as defrag the HDD and use disk cleanup. </s>
<s> Your computer may have just too many processes running in the background as indicated by the number of icons down by the clock. </s>
<s> And lastly do you check for Viruses, Trojans, surfing junk, malware, pests? </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=JAVASCRIPT+BOMB shows you a few old tricks that are still around. </s>

<s> i clicked on that link and it said, dont view this page with java script enabled. </s>
<s> I think it does have something to do with java though because after I posted, I tried getting into that site with firefox and it disabled my java and I was able to get in. </s>
<s> I still can not get in with IE thank you, sitnpriee </s>
<s> CPU 2.66GHz Ram 256 MB. </s>
<s> I downloaded that AFT and it cleans everything out, ie, temps, cache, cookies,prefetch, etc. </s>
<s> , and I use it daily. </s>
<s> I defrag and scan disk weekly. </s>
<s> I have no icons down by my clock except my zone alarm and my volume icon. </s>
<s> I disabled all those things from my startup, so I wouldnt have all those icons down there. </s>
<s> Since my first post, I tried getting to that site with firefox and I had no problem. </s>
<s> It has something to do with IE I think, but I don't know what. </s>
<s> Thanks again, Sitnpritee </s>
