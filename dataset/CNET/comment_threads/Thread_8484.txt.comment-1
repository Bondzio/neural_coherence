hey guys, i just connected my dell xps 400 running windows xp to my panasonic th-c42fd18 plasma.
The only problem im having is that the screen size on the tv is too big, how do i fix the resolution?
(By the way, im running dual monitors, both are displaying the same thing; the picture on the computer moniter is fine, but the tv is too stretched out and doesnt fit.
)And how do i get sound to come out of the television speakers if im using a dvi-hdmi connection?
thanks
