i have a dilema that i can't sort out.
i have a home receiver hooked up to my pc.
one of the analog(1/8&quot; mini) 'out'(s) goes to the a set of rca 'in' jacks on the receiver.
i was thinking about getting a new sound card like the audigy 2 zs but i don't think it will do what i want it to.
i would like to connect my pc via a digital or optical 'out'(from the back of the pc) to the stereo.
this way my receiver is giving me every ounce of stereo music that is being produced.
i'm sure that home stereo speakers sound quite a bit better than pc speaker sets but i don't think there is a card that will do what i want.
i am not interested in running a wire to the front of my pc (like audigy 2 zs platinum) can anyone recommend a way to get a stereo optical or digital 'out' for the audigy 2 zs or another card that might play as well?
thanks, po
