1.1.1	helo, ok i currently have a modem that goes to a router with 2 phone jacks for my vonage phone service and lan 1 out also goes into computer.	St
1.1.2	according to its setup disk my netgear wireless router wants to be the first router.	St
1.1.3	i am afraid this will gum up my vonage signal.	St
1.1.4	is it ok to have the wireless router first?	St
1.1.5	anyone with vonage and a wireless router out there who can advise?	St
1.1.6	thanks - fj	Polite
1.2.1	If you're using a Linksys router with the RT31P2 Vonage adapter it will work fine.	St
1.2.2	Linksys publishes the procedure on their knowledge base ID 358.	St
1.2.3	I am using the same system with no problems...essentially you &quot;cascade&quot; the routers...change the router IP to 192.168.15.2...disable DHCP...from your modem you connect to Internet port of the RT31P2...connect &quot;ethernet (1) on the RT31P2 to your router (I connected to &quot;4&quot;) All this may sound confusing, at least it does to me, so your best bet is to check out the Linksys Knowledge base...even ask their tech help via e-mail...that's what I did and they were most helpful.	St
1.2.4	This system works great with no problems - good luck	Polite
1.3.1	Sorry...I re-read your question and notice that you are using a Netgear router...and my answer was referring to a Linksys router.	St
1.3.2	I don't think anything would be THAT much different...you still &quot;cascade&quot; as I describe...I would contact Netgear and get their input.	St
1.3.3	Incidently, my RT31P2 Vonage router is the &quot;first&quot; one in line from the modem.	St
1.3.4	sorry if I confused you with the Linksys info	Polite
1.4.1	i was feeling kinda frustrated her and you have inspired me.	St
1.4.2	altho it's been rough, using the wizard for the wireless router it gets to a window that asks for admin/ password and i can't get past it.	St
1.4.3	i will talk to linksys help tomorrow.	St
1.4.4	thanks!	St
