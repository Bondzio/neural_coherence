hello again, yes sorry but i was trying to download directly and why i do not know .
anyway, i made a usb and booted from it and nothing happened.
i do not know what to expect to be honest.
would ubuntu come up automatically?
sorry but i am beginning on this path but very eager and determined i tired to eject the usb and message said the file was in use by system but could not see anything anyways thanks reza
