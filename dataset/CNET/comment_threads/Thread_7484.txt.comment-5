Bill, Thanks for the reply.
I don't really need internet access for the N devices, but I do need them to be able to accept a stream from computers that DO need internet, if that makes sense.
IOW, I could leave my present router and computers alone and just connect the new N router to my existing router, but then the computers connected to the old router need to stream data to the devices that would connect to the new one.
So I guess what I do want is bridge mode, if I understand you.
You say it will be a little more complex to get going -- do you have any ideas on what exact issues I should be looking for?
Or should I just start looking up &quot;bridge mode&quot; on the net and see what I need to do?
