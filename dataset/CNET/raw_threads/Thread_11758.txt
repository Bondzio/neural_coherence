I can't move files larger than 600 megs between computers or I get cyclic redundency, time out, and unable to find file errors. The same happens if I try to transfer more than about 2 gigs of files at one time. Normal moving works fine. The problem happens if I try to take or move files from another computer . I get more data through if I take files though. 2 comps on xp pro and 1 on xp home. I was wondering what might cause this prob and if I switched to a router it might help. Also, 1 xp pro is sharing the internet connection. Thanks
