i always keep it up to date.
wep and wpa simultaneously?
you just get one.
some good wireless security practices: - enable wep or wpa - disable ssid broadcast - use strong passwords/keys - change wireless password regularly - enable mac filtering - don't use default ssid, router name, admin password - don't let range of broadcast go too far outside home.
