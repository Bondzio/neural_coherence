You can configure one of the new iMacs with a better video card but cannot buy one separately. If your proposed system meets the game requirements, you should be OK. I have no idea what the system requirements are for this game. You could always keep the PC for playing games on and use a KVM switch with your Mac Mini and PC. P

392	3	228110	2373137	2372889	mrmacfixit	1/12/07 4:55 AM	1.1685777E12	Requirements	Your choice of Windows version Mini runs at 1.6 or 1.83 GHz Mini comes with 512MB RAM expandable to 2GB Not sure about the DirectX thing. Mac's don't do DirectX but I have seen Parallels, the other method of running Windows on a Mac, cope with DirectX Mini does not come with a Keyboard or Mouse. Any USB KB or Mouse will do Mini does not come with an Internet connection. You supply that and the Mini will use it. Seems like you are set to go. P

System Requirements for the game include Keyboard Mouse Internet connection. The mini has built-in ethernet but does NOT have an Internet connection. You have to provide that, by arrangement with your Internet service provider. Just because you have built-in ethernet, does not mean you have an internet connection. Ditto with a wireless capability, you still have to have someone to talk to. You seem to have missed the meagre attempt at levity. P

Extending your comment further, the Mac mini does not have a network card or an audio card either - yet it provides full support for networking (wired and wireless) and audio (including optical)... and USB and FireWire for peripheral (and additional network) connectivity. Now, the video support may not be what you need to support the complex graphics of high-end games... but it certainly does support video... quite nicely. As for the CPU clockspeed - call it what ever you want - but it is still a CPU cycle on an Intel CoreDuo CPU... The same chip in another machine is still the same chip running at the same clockspeed. Comparing different chips (CoreDuo vs single core) is not comparing the same chip. You *could* just not worry about it and get a MacPro tower...

All you wanted to know was if your game would play on a Mac Mini. I'm also confused about your statement that the 2Ghz processors on a Mac is not the same as a 2Ghz processor on a PC. This despite the fact that they are both Core 2 Duo's, are both made by Intel, and are both clocked at 2Ghz. Hey, it's exactly the same chip. The difference is speed, faster on a Mac, is because the OS is meaner and leaner and is written to take advantage of the 2 cores. Windows is not. This may be a little simplistic but, a processor with 2 cores running at 2.33GHz should really be faster than a processor with one core running at 3Ghz, Once again, you can always keep your existing PC, get a Mac and a KVM switch. Use the Mac for real work and the PC for your gaming P
