check the bios area and reset to defaults, reboot and then configure as needed, be on the safe side though.
review what the setting is for &quot;heat overtemp&quot; and the action taken if meant.
don assume, check it/any.
next, since you reseat the cpu, only way to do that once with orginal heat compound is a no-no multiple times.
in other words, don't trust re-using what the vendor gave you.
buy a heatsink compound paste, instead of the &quot;heat pad&quot; the oem provides.
of course make sure the whole hsf setup is seated and fully engaged.
overall, i think you got a &quot;heat&quot; problem.
if none of this helps, return the mtrbd.
and cpu, etc., it also suggests bad parts.
understand, if you handled these wrong, esd(static) can do strange things as well.
imho, epox brand isn't top rated with me, but that's me.
good luck -----willy
