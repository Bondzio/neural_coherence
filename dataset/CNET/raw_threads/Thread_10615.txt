6660	4	106883	1220225	1220049	ozos	6/1/05 4:16 PM	1.11764256E12	it's been done for years	since about 1999-2000 is when nVidia and ATi started using DDR 3dfx was just about ready to make the jump, and then...they folded but the memory on the graphics card doesn't affect the system memory as the CPU/chipset isn't controlling the gfx RAM, the gfx card is GeForce FX 5800 and XGI Volari V8 Duo cards use DDR-II and work in SDRAM, RDRAM, and DDR systems and all the newer cards use DDR-3 and it works in SDRAM, RDRAM, DDR and DDR2 systems but most graphics cards still use DDR and it works fine with SDRAM, RDRAM, DDR and DDR2 equipped systems and I can even vouch for it working, I had a Pentium 4 which used SDRAM in the system, and DDR on both an FX 5200 and GeForce4 MX zero issues (now the system was slower than a dog due to the SDRAM (SDRAM is horrible for a Pentium4, it provides it hardly enough memory bandwidth, but the GPU in no way affects this))
