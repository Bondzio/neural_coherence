1.1.1	I have Vista Premium.	St
1.1.2	The main computer [ACER Aspire 4736 laptop] is connected via NIC to a ZyXEL P-320W wireless router which is in turn connected to a ZyXEL P-660 ASDL2 modem... Other computers connect wirelessly.	St
1.1.3	This setup used to work.	St
1.1.4	However, there are now frequently line d http://forums.cnet.com/laptops-forums/rops : When the ASDL2 modem is booted up, it detects the DSL line and automatically connects to the Internet[nailed up connection].	St
1.1.5	The router is then booted up, followed by the main computer.	St
1.1.6	At this time, the Internet is still being connected, as indicated by the &quot;Internet activity&quot; light of the modem.	St
1.1.7	However, as soon as a browser is clicked, Internet connection is lost - the DSL light goes out, then starts blinking, the modem then detects the DSL line and automatically connection to the Internet.	St
1.1.8	The browser then shows the web site.	St
1.1.9	However, as soon as a link within the webpage is clicked, Internet connection is lost again....and the DSL light goes out... the cycle repeats itself...	St
1.1.10	This also happens to other computers connected wirelessly.	St
1.1.11	However, once in a while, there are no problems.	St
1.1.12	What can cause this to happen ?	Ques
1.1.13	There seems to be no static on the service line.	St
1.1.14	Shall I replace the modem ?	Ques
1.2.1	The P-660HW has it's own wifi and router.	St
1.2.2	Setup could be classified as &quot;experts only&quot; when you add a second router.	St
1.2.3	Given only model numbers and no details about settings it is time to ask those that set this up to see if the settings are proper.	St
1.2.4	I can't tell such from your post except it's not a stock or standard setup.	St
1.2.5	Again the P-660HW is more than a modem.	St
1.2.6	I couldn't find a P-660.	St

1.3.1	Thank you, Bob, for your reply.	St
1.3.2	I am sorry for some misinformation.	Polite
1.3.3	The modem is actually a ADSL2+Router model P-660R.	St
1.3.4	There is no wireless.	St
1.3.5	If you are unable to find it, it may be an older model.	St
1.3.6	Setup: DSL line to the P-660R from which CAT5 cable to the P-320W (LAN port instead of WAN port) [ odd ?	Ques
1.3.7	advanced setup ?]	St
1.3.8	The main computer connects to the P-320W (LAN port) with its [the main computer]NIC.	St
1.3.9	The DHCP server of the P-320W has been disabled, leaving the one at the P-660R enabled.	St
1.3.10	The IP address of the P-320W has been changed slightly [to 192.168.1.0] because it is the same as that of the P-660R [192.168.1.1] The P-660R has been configured as a router instead of as a bridge.	St
1.3.11	Unfortunately, the person who performed the above set up is no longer around.	St
1.3.12	Connection type is PPPoE.	St
1.3.13	Thank you for your kind attention.	St
1.3.14	christy	St
1.4.1	The .0 address is usually reserved as a broadcast address.	St
1.4.2	I'd reconsider that choice.	St
