yeah, i had read about their buying emachines, but what led me on more to emachines was definitely the amd chip.
not that things don't change lot in seven years, but i did have a gateway 1998, and it was good for the time, though had a lot of instability.
never did figure out whether that had to do with the os or the computer quality.
lol, things sucked back then.
xd thanks for the reply!
