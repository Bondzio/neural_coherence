<s> I am operating an HP Windows XP system and I use a Bluetooth USB adapter to recieve photos from my phone and transfer files from my Ipaq. </s>
<s> The &quot;Bluetooth Icon&quot; used to show up in the Windows System Tray (that part of the toolbar never made much sense to me. </s>
<s> . ) </s>
<s> Recently, the Icon &quot;dissapeared&quot; from the toolbar. </s>
<s> (Yes, I have three teenage children using this computer, how did you know?) </s>
<s> Now I can't seem to turn the Bluetooth &quot;ON&quot;. </s>
<s> Any Ideas on how to get the icon back? </s>
<s> The control panel says the device is working, but I get no connection. </s>
<s> I have the bluetooth wizard, bluetooth places folder, and plenty of bluetooth files. </s>

<s> just can't get connected without the Icon's control. </s>

<s> Maybe there is an alternate &quot;ON&quot; switch I could use ? </s>
<s> At first glance the topic seems to want a customized icon, but in truth you would use System Restore and if that fails, then you need to test your hardware on another machine. </s>
<s> In closing, you didn't reveal the model of the machine, but some are Via chip based and the USB will fail if one accepts a driver from Windows Update. </s>
<s> Tip? </s>
<s> Don't do that. </s>
<s> http://www.usbman.com is great if I need to troubleshoot USB items. </s>

<s> When a USB device stops working as you describe what I do is unplug it, plug it into another USB port, and that will re-recognize it and get it working again. </s>
