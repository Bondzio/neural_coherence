find one, you couldn't install it in your system.
your system doesn't have a pcie slot.
anyone that has a decent price on the 8800gt doesn't have 'em in stock.
as others have indicated...you're better off getting a new box with the desired peripherals and the video card you want.
to keep your cost down you could also look at the new ati 3800 series ... they are available from the $175 to the $220 (and more for some vendors) vapcmd
