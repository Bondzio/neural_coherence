thanks keldawwg, that was very enlightening.
i have a few questions though.
you mentioned head degradation as being a leading cause of hd failure.
is there any way to clean the heads of contaminants?
as for heat being destructive, what do you recommend for a temperature margin for most drives?
finally, i was intrigued by your statement that, ''right now the most margin from a head-media standpoint is generally in the 80gb per platter drives...''.
does that mean that those of us with big fat 250-300 gb hd are only signing ourselves up for a world of hurt?
thanks a bunch
