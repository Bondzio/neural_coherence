Hey, Wondering if anyone can help me.
Im building a new computer and getting in my parts in a couple of days.
I'm planning to run games on this pc.
I'm also planning on overclocking my processor.
Just wanted to know what's a good heatsink, fan, or other cooling device (other than watercooling) that can keep my processor the coolest, and wondering if anyone knows what's the highest speed to run my processor safely.
Here are my specs: ASUS P5ND2-SLI Socket T motherboard celeron d 346 (3.06ghz) geforce 7600gt 512 ddr2 667 120gb hd 450w psu
