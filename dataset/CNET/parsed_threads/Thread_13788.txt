<s> I will be getting a new laptop soon and returning the current one. </s>
<s> I have a question on backing up existing programs and settings so that I can load/copy exisitng programs to the new PC. </s>
<s> It straight forward to me on copy/loading back documents, pics, etc. </s>
<s> It is finding a easier way to copy all the programs I use for business, that I would like to find a simplier way than reload every program and so through the set up. </s>
<s> Current PC - XP Pro New PC - XP Home external HDD with plenty of space for copying. </s>
<s> I am considering adding another external HDD, and have read some of Maxtor and Imogeainof on back up SW, would that work for me? </s>
<s> What ever I use, if possible would like to be able to mirror 3 other PC's on my home network for back up also. </s>
<s> I seen reviews on Drive Image and others? </s>
<s> Thoughts and suggestions from here? </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> Programs don't copy or move. </s>
<s> It's by design that they must be installed. </s>
<s> Yes, you may want this to not be so, but this move to install rather than copy began in 1995. </s>
<s> The programs you listed are not a solution since they copy disks or partitions and not &quot;programs.&quot; There is some hope in software like AlohaBob PC Relocator, but I've found it to be successful on 98% of installed programs which means not all will survive. </s>
<s> Why not just install proper? </s>

<s> Doesn't the XP Files and Settings Transfer Wizard do this? </s>
<s> Not the OS, but programs and stuff. </s>
<s> Here's the link to review. </s>
<s> http://aumha.org/win5/a/fast.php Microsoft in 1995 with the OS released then explains so much why this is so. </s>
<s> The programs prior to that OS would reside in their own directory along with the .INI file and such. </s>
<s> Today, it's much more complex. </s>
