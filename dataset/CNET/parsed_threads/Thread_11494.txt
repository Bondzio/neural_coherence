<s> If your information is valuable, you should probably contact a data recovery company. </s>
<s> If not or you don't want to spend the money, give knoppix live cd a try. </s>
<s> You would want to use a program called dd_rescue. </s>
<s> Make sure you have the input file and output correct or you will overwrite your information. </s>
<s> I really dont have much knowledge about all what you've mentioned here. </s>
<s> But the information I provided are correct. </s>
<s> At the moment. </s>
<s> I dont have enough money for data recovery company. </s>
<s> And I'm in Nigeria at the moment. </s>
<s> Not much of them around here. </s>
<s> I also don't have much time in retrieving this pictures. </s>
<s> I don't get what you mean. </s>
<s> But guess you mean if I have search previous post about this same problem. </s>
<s> I have seen various post about it. </s>
<s> But I haven't seen anyone of them that match my own problem. </s>
<s> I have tried to follow their processes which says to initialize disk. </s>
<s> Mine however not giving me any options to initialize disk. </s>
<s> It's titled lost and found and contains free, trial and mentions recovery houses. </s>
<s> Some of the tools work with such damage. </s>
<s> If you can't use such tools I suggest you head to http://www.drivesavers.com now. </s>
<s> This sort of recovery is not reliable. </s>
<s> Some folk forget that or didn't know. </s>

<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you Bob. </s>
<s> I see you've been very helpful with people in most of the thread of read. </s>
<s> Keep up the good job. </s>
<s> Let me check those links out and revert. </s>
<s> If it is primarly pictures you want, you could try photorec: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec Make sure you read the tutorial http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec_Step_By_Step Do you have a desktop computer or laptop? </s>
<s> Dont try to initialize disk that could make matters worse. </s>
<s> Yes I have two laptops. </s>
<s> And I have lots of infos on the drive. </s>
<s> Majority of which is photos. </s>
<s> I do want the drive working so I can transfer my data. </s>
<s> I'm yet to work on it. </s>
<s> Still bidding my time to take next possible action. </s>
<s> Read the tutorial again. </s>
<s> When you recover those files it writes them to some other drive. </s>
<s> Think about this. </s>
<s> The drive does not need to be fully working to recover files. </s>
<s> Why I write this is that some folk didn't know that when we recover files we don't always fix the issue with the drive. </s>
<s> That is, we recover the data, then may format the drive and copy the files back onto the drive. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yes I do know. </s>
<s> I read the tutorials. </s>
<s> I think it's best I get someone who really understand this to help me. </s>
<s> I don't want to mess it up while doing it onmy own. </s>
<s> Thanks everyone. </s>
<s> If you can't use the tutorials such as Recuva offers then we are forced back to drive savers. </s>
<s> What I would write here would duplicate what's at the Recuva site. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm not sure I saw the thread on Recuver. </s>
<s> Is this same as Photorec? </s>
<s> And you know what. </s>
<s> I'm just being careful. </s>
<s> Aint a geek geeky like that. </s>
<s> I'm just a Phtoographer.. Have got plenty data in that folder that I can't afford to mess up further. </s>
<s> I will try and see if I can find a local guy here who can work on it. </s>
<s> Cos I cant do drive saver from here and no time for me. </s>
<s> Cos I need the images urgently. </s>
<s> Good morning, I had two go bad last year. </s>
<s> Fortunately a friend let me borrow a copy of the puppy Linux operating system on cd for the second one. </s>
<s> You start the computer with cd in drive and external drive attached. </s>
<s> If you have ever used dos, it works like that. </s>
<s> I am better at showing than telling. </s>
<s> Linux recognized the drive and I was able to copy everything to a new drive. </s>
<s> It literally took 22 or more hours to copy but worth it. </s>
<s> Google Puppy Linux and see what you find. </s>
<s> Good luck and Happy Easter. </s>
<s> Even without a tutorial you use -&gt; Recuva &lt;- to scan for the files but save those files on a good drive. </s>
<s> Be careful of the spelling since bad people will rename some malware to suck folk into installing something bad. </s>
<s> I see the save location in the tab/area noted in the documentation at http://www.piriform.com/docs/recuva/recuva-settings/options-actions Bob </s>
