I bought it at the same time as the video card, which was at the start of December 2012.
So about a month and a half.
Haven't really used the computer much, and just now actually trying to set it up.
I just ran out to every computer/office store that I know of, and nobody had any of the 6/6+2 pin connectors.
I'll have to order one online and come back to this thread later, when it arrives.
