Sorry, you need a new computer, unless you want to get rid of your processor, first post it right, that chip is garbage to be honest, and if you get a new chip, video card, and PSU, then you may as well buy a whole new computer, if thats what you do, BUILD YOUR OWN.
Find a custom build shop in your area, and they will assemble and install O.S.
for you if you don't know how.
