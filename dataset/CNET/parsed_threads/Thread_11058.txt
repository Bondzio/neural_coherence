<s> Hey everyone, I just bought a new mouse (logitech MX610), and installed the Setpoint software. </s>
<s> The MX610 has several buttons on it (volume up/down/mute, forward/back, email, IM, scrollwheel) and everything works when i click it but for some reason the lights on the email and IM buttons never light up. </s>
<s> they're supposed to light up when i have mail or an IM, but they dont. </s>
<s> i know this sounds dumb but i was just wondering if anyone has had this problem or knows how to fix it. </s>
<s> I reinstalled Setpoint several times and have messed with the settings as well. </s>
<s> I cant find any threads on the logitech site about it so i dont know what to do. </s>
<s> it says the batteries are good and everything seems to be working except for the lights. </s>
<s> any help? </s>
<s> thanks in advance. </s>
