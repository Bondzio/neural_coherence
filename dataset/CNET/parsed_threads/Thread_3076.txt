<s> Since Honeycomb is tailored for Tegra 2 tablets, is it necessary to upgrade Motorola Xoom or ASUS Eee Pad Transformer TF101 to a newer Android OS? </s>
<s> The tablet maker would issue it. </s>
<s> This is not like &quot;Windows.&quot; Hope the short answer suffices. </s>
<s> Yes there are other folk hacking it onto some tablets but then no support that I can find. </s>

<s> My concerns is &quot;Icecream and Jellybean are mostly for OMAP, upgrade these Tegra 2 tablets to Android 4.xx probably, if not definitely, not a good option.&quot; I wonder if Asus and Motorola would issue an effective upgrade versions since the Tegra 2 tablets are being faded out. </s>
<s> It's quite a strange statement. </s>
<s> Remember I've been programming the pre-historic tablets (pre-Android) so I find your statement something I would never write. </s>

<s> But let's get this up on the table. </s>
<s> The tablet makers do not see recurring revenue by issuing updates. </s>
<s> In fact I've encountered bugs in systems and years later the bug is still there. </s>
<s> Let's take the gloves off and not sugar coat this issue. </s>
<s> You can not expect the tablet makers to issue updates. </s>
<s> Apple will be the exception but you see that iPad 1 may have had it's last update. </s>
