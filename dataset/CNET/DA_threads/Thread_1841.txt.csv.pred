1.1.1	Hi, I'm trying to retrofit a Compaq Presario 8000Z with new motherboard so I can upgrade my video card and processor.	St
1.1.2	Does anyone know how I can tell which motherboards will work for this?	Ques
1.1.3	I can even do the research myself if someone knows a good resource to use.	St
1.1.4	Thanks, Ryan	Polite
1.2.1	A friendly shop is your best bet since most of these &quot;computer in a box&quot; systems can use odd size cases, custom power supplies or have some flange that doesn't line up.	St
1.2.2	You may be looking at a new case/power-supply as well.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I bought a new chip, AMD 64 3000.	St
1.3.2	Went to AMD web site and researched the chip.	St
1.3.3	They also had a listing of suggested motherboards to use with this chip.	St
1.3.4	Probably have similar lists at other chip manufactures web sites.	St
