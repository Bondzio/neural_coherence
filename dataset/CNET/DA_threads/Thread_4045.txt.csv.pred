1.1.1	So I 've had my computer for about a year now , and after a few upgrades everything has held together quite well .	St
1.1.2	About a month ago , I was hooking up a GPU fan that I bought and I heard a crackle and seen a blue light flash from where the pins touched on my PSU .	St
1.1.3	Now I know something bad had to have happened since not too long after that incident my computer failed to boot .	St
1.1.4	So after a long day of troubleshooting I decided to unplug everything from the computer and turn it on with just the basics .	St
1.1.5	Only the 20+4 pin and the 4 pin power connecter to the motherboard and it powered on fine .	St
1.1.6	I plugged my HDD , GPU cooler and front LCD back in and it worked fine .	St
1.1.7	But now even with just the HDD plugged in it shuts down after a few seconds .	St
1.1.8	More like a minute or so .	St
1.1.9	After some searching I found out it 's either the MB or the PSU .	St
1.1.10	Since that incident I figured it 's probably the PSU .	St
1.1.11	So what I 'm trying to get at during this rant is which power supply would you recommend ?	Ques
1.1.12	Or of any others you would recommend .	St
1.1.13	My budget is about $ 50 on a gift card I bought for this occasion .	St
1.1.14	1st choice : http : //www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp ? EdpNo=1147669 & amp ; body=MAIN 2nd choice : http : //www.amazon.com/Corsair-430-Watt-Certified-Compatible-Platforms/dp/B004W2T2TM/ref=sr_1_15 ? s=pc & amp ; ie=UTF8 & amp ; qid=1327541456 & amp ; sr=1-15 Of course I know that Corsair is well know to have fantastic PSUs but with 11 reviews of DOA or disappointing reviews , I am skeptical .	St
1.1.15	Any suggestions are welcome .	Polite
1.1.16	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	the 430w and it 's ok .	St
1.2.2	Stable , cool and reasonably quiet .	St
1.2.3	Corsair TX are better but out of your price limit unless they go on sale .	St
1.2.4	A good compromise on price/performance is this http : //www.ocztechnology.com/ocz-500w-700w-modxstream-pro-power-supply.html .	St
1.2.5	Stable , cool , quiet , efficient and MODULAR !	St
1.2.6	But dual rail .	St
1.2.7	Frequently goes on sale at Newegg , et al .	St
1.2.8	With rebate , the 500w can be had for $ 35 .	St
1.3.1	It saves folk from learning about balancing rails and more .	St
1.3.2	Bob	St
1.4.1	I just tried to buy the Ultra on TigerDirect , and the Corsair on Amazon and my gift card was declined .	St
1.4.2	& gt ; . & lt ; I looked up that OCZ on newegg and it 's 69.99 .	St
1.4.3	I should learn not to be so cheap , but I do n't really know if I buy the PSU and it turns out to be the MB that 's the problem .	St
1.5.1	Cheap experiment .	St
1.5.2	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817139026 & amp ; nm_mc=EMC-IGNEFL012612 & amp ; cm_mmc=EMC-IGNEFL012612-_-EMC-012612-Index-_-PowerSupplies-_-17139026-L0C	Ques
