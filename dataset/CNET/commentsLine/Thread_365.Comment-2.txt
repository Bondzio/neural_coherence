nero 6 doesn't provide this function.
xp might, but i find it's support strewn with problems which i have found no cures.
but let me share this site first!
before you write nero does such, i beg to differ.
incd might provide it and is bundled with nero 6. issues multiple if you use that, but do try on your own dime and take this one advice.... try it with the imapi service disabled and enabled.
what's that you ask?
read the supplied link.
