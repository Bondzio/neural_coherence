ok, i know i can have one built and i have weighed the options and i decided to buy one.
i bought an area 51-7500 and it took 2 months to get here, and i got the blue screen right out of the box.
i sent it back for repairs got it back today, and just got the blue screen again while trying to download photoshop.
i am done with alienware.
can anyone please suggest a good reliable company where i can get a real high performance computer.
my budget is no more then 5k, with the monitor included.
i looked at the xps but i couldnt find it with the intel 6800, which is one thing i deff.
