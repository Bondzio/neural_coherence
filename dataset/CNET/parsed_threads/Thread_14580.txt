<s> I was at Best Buy today looking for a new monitor and found the Samsung 215TW. </s>
<s> As far as I can tell, this is a new product that should not be on the shelves yet. </s>
<s> It is not yet on the US Samsung website (although it is on the Canadian site) and I have found only one site that has this as a pre-order. </s>
<s> Anyway, the price was good so I bought it and I was wondering if anyone knows anything about this product. </s>
<s> I need at least two of them for a dual moniter setup. </s>
<s> Still haven't installed it, but it looked prety good at bestbuy...Have you installed yours already? </s>
<s> How does it look? </s>
<s> As you can see in the previous message, I just bought this Samsung 215TW at Bestbuy for $545 plus taxes and since I didn't see any reviews on this and bought it on the blind, I'm going to share my thoughts and impressions on this unit for your benefit as I think it might help you buy your LCD. </s>
<s> My first impression was, &quot;pretty solid display&quot;. </s>
<s> It did not come with any dead pixels or back light bleeding. </s>
<s> I haven't calibrated it yet, but from what I can see it won't require any major adjustments. </s>
<s> The screen displays crisp, well defined images. </s>
<s> Max resolution is 1680x1050. </s>
<s> Text is very readable as my wife pointed out since she does a lot of word, typing, etc. </s>
<s> You can fit two word, or windows in it without a problem and it's very readable. </s>
<s> As I'm typing I'm standing about 3 to 4 feet behind it and it's as good as it can get. </s>
<s> Its base holds the monitor securely and it doesn't vibrate as you adjust it. </s>
<s> Its height is decently adjustable, it tilts front and back, and it also rotates to the vertical, and I mean vertical, unlike some gateway reviews i've seen. </s>
<s> All the menu buttons are on the front of the display, all its inputs/outputs are on the back and side for the extra audio/video/composite. </s>
<s> It doesn't come with any USB ports if you're looking for that feature. </s>
<s> It does come with the DVI cable, although it's not gold tipped, and the VGA one. </s>
<s> It also comes with a cd that contains drivers, rotation software which works perfectly, and a color/mode tool. </s>
<s> It also has built in speakers that are decent for very basic ops. </s>
<s> If you want something decent get it separately. </s>
<s> What else. </s>
<s> Set up was easy and I' going to paste information that came with the cd for specs on the unit and I hope this helped you decide. </s>

<s> Dot Acceptable TFT LCD panel manufactured by using advanced semiconductor technology with precision of 1ppm(one millionth) above is used for this product. </s>
<s> But the pixels of RED, GREEN, BLUE and WHITE color seem to be bright sometimes or some of black pixels could be seen. </s>
<s> This is not from bad quality and you can use it without uneasiness. </s>
<s> For example, the number of TFT LCD sub pixels that is contained in this product are 5,292,000. </s>
<s> Any idea why I can't get the volume to work on the 215TW? </s>
<s> Do I need a cable? </s>
<s> I am using the analog cable and the picture is terrific but I have no sound. </s>
<s> I've done all system checks so I have to imagine it's the monitor. </s>
<s> Any input would be appreciated! </s>
<s> if you look underneath your monitor, right by the dvi cable input there's an input for sound and that's where you need to hook the sound cable in. </s>
<s> So far this monitor has been great except for one problem. </s>
<s> The 1680x1050 resolution is only working in analog mode. </s>
<s> I cannot get it to work in digital mode. </s>
<s> Instead it downgrades to 1280x1024 resolution and clips the output. </s>
<s> I can still get to the clipped areas by panning the screen by moving the mouse to the edge of the screen. </s>
<s> Is this expected or should I exchange the monitor? </s>
<s> I was planning on going back to the store and have them test this on another monitor and see if the blame is on my old video card. </s>
<s> I am sometimes amazed by how technically inept I am - how embarrassing. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help! </s>
<s> I had exactly the same problem with an old video card. </s>
<s> It seems that some early DVI video cards can't support 1680 by 1050 over the DVI port, but will do so over the VGA port. </s>
<s> I upgraded my video card and now have it working at 1680 by 1050 in DVI mode. </s>
<s> I also got this monitor, and one of the reasons I went for it over the similar LG monitor is that the Samsung has the 3 video inputs. </s>
<s> If you are looking for an HDTV, you should get an HDTV and not a computer monitor, but having the video inputs seemed useful to me. </s>
<s> If you are looking at this monitor for its video inputs, you should be aware that the component video will only go up to a 480p signal. </s>
<s> A &quot;film mode&quot; is available for interlaced video as well. </s>
<s> The DVI port is HDCP compliant, so it looks like you might be able feed a HDTV signal to this monitor that way, BUT I can't find anywhere in the docs what HDTV resolution might be supported, if any. </s>
<s> I'd guess 720p, but I do not have anything that makes a HDTV signal to test this with. </s>
<s> Anyway, I got this as a computer monitor and am very happy with it. </s>
<s> That was my suspicion since the specs specifically state it supports that resolution on both vga and dvi. </s>
<s> I too, bought this screen as soon as it got out even before Samsung advertised it. </s>
<s> Funny thing is, I was calling them (Samsung product support) from Bestbuy to learn more because no one knew about it, and strangely enough, even Samsung reps couldn't tell me anything. </s>
<s> I had also the Gateway FPD2185W, and let me tell you, it is crap compared to this Samsung!! </s>
<s> CNET's reviewers gave it close to 8 points, I thought it was exaggerated. </s>
<s> This Samsung supports High Definition input through its component with resolutions of 480p 720p and 1080i. </s>
<s> Very crisp and vivid picture. </s>
<s> I compared the gateway side by side, and the Samsung takes the Gateway out easily. </s>
<s> I have tried it with the xBOX 360 and boy I tell you it is wonderful. </s>
<s> Its 8ms refresh rate and 1000:1 contrast give you a superb quality. </s>
<s> Really, if you are looking to spend nearly $600, this is your monitor. </s>
<s> It gives you 3 years (!) </s>
<s> of warranty compared to lousy 1 year with Gateway. </s>
<s> Oh yes also their sales and support suck and shameful. </s>
<s> Go for the Samsung! </s>
