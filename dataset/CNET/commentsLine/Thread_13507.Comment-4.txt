for intel, the i486dx, most of the pentiums, p2, p3.
the p4 is not a dual cpu design.
then we have the xeon and itaniums.
for sun, then have some units from 1 to a few hundred sparc cpus.
the old mips cpu was multiple cpu capable, but stickly listed for mention... then we have the alpha, but not in wide distribution.
in the apple camp, they have some dual powerpc or powerspec or such.
i hope this gives you the lay of the land today.
the ht tends to be you lowest cost almost full dual core unit today.
