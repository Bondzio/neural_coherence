a very petite lady friend of mine (4' 10&quot;) is studying to be a medical transcriptionist, but is finding that conventional keyboards require her fingers to stray from the home position a lot.
this prevents her getting up to speed and might well lead to repetitive stress injuries down the road, i'm told.
is there a keyboard available that isn't a toy that is made for smaller-than-average persons?
it would need to be pretty much a standard keyboard, but with reduced key size and/or spacing - number pad optional.
i'm presently looking at the 83-key low profile mini keyboard sold by ergonomic resources, but i don't know who actually makes it.
can someone give us advice?
thanks!
