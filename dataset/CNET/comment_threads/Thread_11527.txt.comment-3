Thanks for the info, but I found exactly the same thing in my search.
Problem is, my connection in the PC is different; I don't have the bar bit.
Just three rows across the connection, with one hole missing on the bottom row, 3 from the edge.
Still, it has the Digital symbol on face, so it must be a digital connection.
Right?
I'm confused.
