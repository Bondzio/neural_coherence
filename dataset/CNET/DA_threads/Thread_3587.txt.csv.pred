1.1.1	I'm looking at buying a used system for my nieces/nephews since theirs just died.	St
1.1.2	Right now, looking at a nice DELL GX745 SFF which has a 275w power supply (which can not be replaced by a regular after market unit).	St
1.1.3	Question is... looking at low rise single slot video card upgrades around $35, I see that cards like the Radeon HD5450 requires a min.	St
1.1.4	of a 400w power supply, but, when I research the card's benchmark tests I see that it's max power consumption is only 19w.	St
1.1.5	So... when looking at video cards... do I look at min.	St
1.1.6	required specs?	St
1.1.7	or the actual power consumption?	St
1.1.8	Otherwise, with a 275w power supply I don't think they make a PCIe video card that low in specs that can be considered an upgrade.	St
1.2.1	I don't think I can help if you believe the 5450 requires that many Watts.	St
1.2.2	But it is the card of choice when we can't change the PSU.	St
1.2.3	bob	St
1.3.1	Well, I've seen a few sites that showed benchmarks stating that the card's max power consumption is under 20w... which makes sense... if the video cards requires a full 400 watts, then what's left to power the rest of the computer?	St
1.3.2	I tried the wattage calculator on NewEgg and said that with the systems specs and that card, total min would be 248w which... kinda pushing it since likely DELL's 275w power supply isn't really 275w.	St
1.3.3	Well... guy never replied back for the computer anyway, and found another DELL with a 305w power supply, same system but the mid-tower and read where a few people have installed similar cards without problems.	St
1.3.4	URL examples.	St
1.3.5	http://www.hwcompare.com/376/geforce-gt-210-vs-radeon-hd-5450/ http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/310851-33-sapphire-5450-power-draw-htpc	St
1.4.1	My HP d4999t is pretty stock with 4GB RAM, one HDD, 2 DVDRW drives and a some Nvidia 1GB 240 or such card.	St
1.4.2	On the P3 Watt meter it's at 200 Watts when a 3D game runs so I don't worry about it's stock 300 Watt PSU.	St
1.4.3	It's a little tight and while I like to run at 50% or less of the rating this machine is rather dated so we'll just let it be.	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	Bought the Mid-Tower model of the Dell 745, with 305w power supply.	St
1.5.2	Added the ATI HD5450 1GB low-profile card and runs perfectly fine.	St
