According to the Dell site that computer has 2 PCIe slots.
one is a x16 the other a x1.
I know that card (as I have the same card) is a x16 and I don't know what putting it in the x1 slot would do.
It also takes a minimum 300 watt power supply and I couldn't find what the 4700 comes with.
It also mentions that you have to tell what slot you are putting the card into for it to work.
Hope that helps.
