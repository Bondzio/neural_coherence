Beeps are coming from BIOS which means it has detected a hardware error. It's often a memory or video issue but could be many things. When this happens, there is no attempt to boot to any OS. The PC must pass POST (power on self test) first. The beep code is trying to tell you what is wrong but without a list of the codes it's hard to tell. What you can do is reseat components such as the video card (AGPs are notorious for problems with poor seating in the card slot) and memory modules. If you have more than one memory module, remove all but one and then try them individually to see if you can get the beeps to go away. Good luck.
