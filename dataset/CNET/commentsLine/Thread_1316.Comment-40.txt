yes, in fact, not only have i connected my pc to my entertainment center, in 1999 i took it a step further and also connected it to my car, establishing the very first prototype of my new invention, the automobile audio-video theater system.
thus far, i have identified a market for this technology and am in the process of launching it into a full-blown business.
i would definitely say it has the potential of becoming the next big thing.
