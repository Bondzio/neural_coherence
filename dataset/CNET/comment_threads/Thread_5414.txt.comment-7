Again, with the multiplier locked, the ONLY way to OC the proc is to adjust the FSB.
You wouldn't need new memory to run dual channel, just a board that supports the feature (assuming you have at least 2 identical sticks).
There is no such thing as dual channel memory, it's a feature of the mobo.
The speed of your DDR memory will affect the ability to overclock as well.
