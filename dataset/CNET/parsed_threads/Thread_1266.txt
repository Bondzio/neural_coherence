<s> I have a HP D7160. </s>
<s> It's indicated for a few weeks that the (icon) needs to be replaced soon. </s>
<s> All ink colors are represented by icons, and nowhere is the color spelled out. </s>
<s> I finally replaced it with a brand new, boxed, sealed HP ink cartridge bought at CVS. </s>
<s> It then said something about a previously used cartridge. </s>
<s> I was blown away! </s>
<s> It does seem to be working almost normally now. </s>
<s> None of the other ink indicators showed that any other cartridge was anywhere near low in the last two months. </s>
<s> I do little printing. </s>
<s> Now it says that the following cartridge is now depleted - and displays an icon with no color - the inside of the icon is white, as the background color of the printer display is white. </s>
<s> I cannot get any response at all on the HP site. </s>
<s> Anyone here have a clue about this? </s>
<s> If &quot;previously used&quot; this might be a third party cartridge, not an original HP one. </s>
<s> But you forgot to say when it said something, what that it is and what exactly it said. </s>
<s> I've never met a speaking cartridge. </s>
<s> If that's the case indeed, HP won't support it. </s>
<s> Back to CVS then. </s>

<s> This may sound strange but I have seen similar situations with HP printers when cartridges are changed, generally with all-in one units. </s>
<s> Try reloading the software, uninstall then reinstall, if that doesn't do the trick then go to the HP site and see if there is an update for that unit. </s>
<s> Where issues arose, some years back, was the transition from Win XP to Vista and now of course Win 7. </s>
<s> The D7160 is not a new unit and as I recall had software bundled compatible with Win XP, so unless you have done an update and are running against Vista or Win 7 you may have some issues. </s>
<s> Well, there are &quot;intell i/c&quot; abroad the ink carts nowadays. </s>
<s> It knows when its been changed but you should as you already know proceed foward. </s>
<s> It will a nagging sorta thing until it too is empty. </s>
<s> I don't see any way around this as its part of the overall setup by HP and other makers. </s>
<s> While, I suspect the ink displayed is really low its not entirely empty so you can use whatever is left the next until it actually registers empty or won't go any further. </s>
<s> The warning usually refers to a level(20%) left in the ink cart, maybe more. </s>
<s> Also, don't prioceed after installing a new ink cart the install process or &quot;align. </s>
<s> one&quot; so it can work at its best. </s>
<s> That too is a nagging condition if not worked on. </s>
