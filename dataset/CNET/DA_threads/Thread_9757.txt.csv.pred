1.1.1	Hi , I need help to decide which MacBook to get , or which one is better , I use it mostly to view movies , surf the web and use itunes .	St
1.1.2	My decision has come between : A MacBook Air 2.0GHz Intel Dual-Core Core i7 , Turbo Boost up to 3.2GHz 4GB 1600MHz DDR3L SDRAM 256GB Flash Storage ... ( not sure if they have this one at my Apple Store , if not it will be MBA 1.8GHz Intel Dual-Core Core i5 , Turbo Boost up to 2.8GHz 4GB 1600MHz DDR3L SDRAM 256GB Flash Storage ) and a MacBook Pro 2.9GHz Dual-core Intel Core i7 , Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz 8GB 1600MHz DDR3 SDRAM & # 8212 ; 2x4GB 750GB Drive	St
1.2.1	then any of those would be fine .	St
1.2.2	However , if the movies you plan on watching are on DVD then the MBP wold be the better option as it has a DVD player built in , the Air does not .	St
1.2.3	( There is an available , external , DVD option for it though ) If these movies are going to be files , not a physical DVD , then bear in mind that the Air has a relatively small SSD drive ( 256GB ) A bunch of movies and a good size iTunes library could quickly eat up 256GB .	St
1.2.4	Your local Apple Store will be able to supply any of the three machines that you have mentioned .	St
1.2.5	P	St
1.3.1	I use my laptops the whole day , barely use a desktop pc , I use a time machine so hdd is not an issue , also the optical drive .	St
1.3.2	Under this consideration my last doubt is about which will be more useful as a daily and nearly all day being on ( overheating or battery damaging , etc ) Thanks again	St
