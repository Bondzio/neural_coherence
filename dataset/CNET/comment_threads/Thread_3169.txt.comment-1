I realize that this is not exactly a computer issue but here goes.
I'm using an old computer power supply to power quiet 12 V cooling fans for electronic equipment in an entertainment unit.
I am running 3 120 mm fans that draw 1.4 W max.
with a 200 W power supply.
I have 2 old PS's, the oldest has a switch that will turn it on and off but has a noisy cooling fan.
The newer PS has a quieter fan but won't turn on (I'm guessing) without a signal from the motherboard; it worked OK before I removed it from a computer.
My question is two part; can I disconnect the cooling fan in the older PS since I'll be using less than 5 W of power total without overheating the PS?
Alternatively is there a way to &quot;jump&quot; the newer power supply so that it will turn on without the motherboard connection?
Thanks
