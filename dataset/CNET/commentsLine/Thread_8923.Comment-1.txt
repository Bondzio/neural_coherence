i have an ide configured sata hdd with windows 7 currently running on it.
(wd caviar 500gb) i have a twin for this disk, currently not installed.
i would like to, if possible configure these two disks so that it registers in windows as a single disk (1tb) with one drive letter.
any help or pointers is greatly appreciated.
