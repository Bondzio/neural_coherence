i wouldn't expect you to have any problems with that cable.
the only hdmi cables i've ever had any problems with have been the free ones i got from comcast.
frys once had 6' hdmi cables on sale for $2 each, and i bought 6 of them.
not one of them has given me any problems.
for $6 you aren't risking much to give it a shot.
good luck.
