1.1.1	Hello , I have a node with one physical wireless interface and I need it to offer AP service to other nodes , connect to an existed AP , and connect to other nodes in ad hoc mode .	St
1.1.2	If I create 3 logical wireless interfaces of that interface and configure each one respectively to the modes above , would this work ?	Ques
1.1.3	do they use the same MAC address or each needs to be configured a different one ?	Ques
1.1.4	And what is the disadvantages of this approach ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks !	St

1.2.1	Problem is if you really only have one radio it is this unit that has to run in the different modes .	St
1.2.2	This is similar to the radios that can run B , G , N but not at the same time .	St
1.2.3	They attempt to switch back and forth but are only somewhat successful .	St
1.2.4	Same with routers that claim to be dual band but only have a single radio that switches between 5g and 2.4g If you were to work for a chipset manufacture maybe you could integrate this type of switching function .	St
1.2.5	Trying to do it with software external to the chipset would be quite the challenge .	St
1.2.6	The last time I was digging at that level you had to actually reinitialize the radio to change it from AP mode to client mode .	St
1.2.7	I have seen some newer devices that claim easy changing of these mode but I would suspect they do n't mean changing back and forth trying to emulate both devices at the same time .	St
1.3.1	I came across a situation like that and their IT staffer lost their job over it .	St
1.3.2	They had spent months trying to solve it and the owner came to me out of desperation since the trade show was looming and they had to have it working .	St
1.3.3	The IT staffer was put to other work and we jerry-rigged a solution using multiple APs and routers .	St
1.3.4	Their IT staffer exploded and quit the next day and the show went off without a hitch .	St
1.3.5	Be sure you are not restricting your options here as they were .	St
1.3.6	They were trying to do this with a single box .	St
