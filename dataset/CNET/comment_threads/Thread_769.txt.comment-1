So yesterday I decided to clean my system and when I was trying to remove the CPU fan and heatsink, I broke the plastic cradle that keeps it down (see image 1).
I then realized even though one side was still intact, my computer would shutoff immediately.
Oh and I also noticed the CPU and bottom of the heatsink looks as if they were overheating (I'm not sure if that's the correct terminology; see images 2 and 3).
I've had my computer for about 5 years now: ASUS P4P800 SE P4 3.0 ghz Prescott socket 478 2gb Crucial PC3200 DDR400 Maxtor 200gb HDD DVD-RW and CD-RW drive 3.5 floppy ATI Radeon X1600 pro Antec 430W PSU http://img257.imagevenue.com/img.php?image=09343_DSC03429_122_25lo.JPG http://img245.imagevenue.com/img.php?image=09332_DSC03427_122_382lo.JPG http://img42.imagevenue.com/img.php?image=09336_DSC03428_122_1165lo.JPG What are my options from here?
Thanks in advance.
