1.1.1	Hi im after chainging mu current pentium 4 3.06ghz to a dual core but is my motherboard compatible .	St
1.1.2	Its a packard bell imedia 1529 pc and on the web site it says it supportes dual core but im not sure which one to buy .	St
1.1.3	I have used cpuz and it says its using socket 775 LGA .	St
1.1.4	Do i have to get a dual core pentium with the same socket , and i think its running at 800 bus speed Meny thanks	St
1.2.1	website .	St
1.2.2	Then maybe a note to the nfg 's tech support .	St
1.2.3	Is it still under warranty ?	Ques
1.2.4	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	but check with maker as stated previously .	St
1.3.2	Hoever it 's unlikly to support the new Core 2 Duo as these requre a newer chipset Intel 965 , 975 , however the Pentium D Duel core will speed things up for you .	St
1.3.3	Good luck .	Polite
1.3.4	John	St
1.4.1	as u know core 2 duo has 1066mhz fsb and this motherboard supports 800mhz fsb it will work like any pentium d , if u core 2 duo it think jst raise the fsb in the BIOS from 200mhz to 266mhz , if possible and lower one notch the VCORE because c2d consumes less power .	St
1.4.2	hope this helped	St
1.5.1	Hi thanks for all your reply but what difference is they between dual core and pentium d. Ment thanks	Polite
1.6.1	that pentium d is a dual core ( running two cores at a time ) and dual core is a defination for a processor running two cores .	St
1.6.2	in pentium there are only two series of dualcore 1- Pentium D 2- core 2 duo	St
1.7.1	I should be able to put a pentium D in my motherboard .	St
1.7.2	LOL sorry for sounding dumb .	Polite
1.7.3	I dont suppose you have any links providing me where i can buy a compatable processor .	St
1.7.4	The main reason to upgrade is im a keen gamer and i would like to run vista when it arrives .	St
1.7.5	Meny thanks	Polite
1.8.1	nothing about upgrade CPUs .	St
1.8.2	If you have other credible links that show otherwise ... post it for us to see too .	St
1.8.3	EVen if a newer CPU will sit/fit in the socket does n't mean it will work as it should Again .. you 're better off leaving this system as is and saving the $ $ for the next system .	St
1.8.4	Big box PCs usually do n't promote such upgrades which often require BIOS updates to recognize and take advantage of newer CPUs .	St
1.8.5	The gain ai n't worth the $ $ or the pain .	St

1.9.1	You can buy a Pentium D 945 : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16819116255 but i recommand you to go for an core 2 duo e6300 : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16819115005 this e6300 is very nice for anything you can run windows vista , games , multitasking , etc .	St
1.9.2	dont think about the speed why is it less ?	Ques
1.9.3	its double the speed of pentium d 945 , its a good overclocking chip but for core 2 duo e6300 , you should buy a motherboard that supports 1066mhz FSB .	St
1.9.4	the best motherboard for a low price is GIGABYTE GA-965P-S3 : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16813128017 hope this helped	St
1.10.1	this is my motherboard info from the web site .	St
1.10.2	Hope this helps on what i can and can not do if its the case of me not been able to change it what about overclocking it ? ? ? ? ? ? .	Ques
1.10.3	If i can change it i may go for the one you recomended meny thanks MOTHERBOARD Form Factor ATX form factor CPU Support Intel Pentium D Dual Core Technology Intel Pentium Hyper-Threading Technology ( HT Technology ) with FMB Performance 2005 support Intel Pentium 4 processor in an LGA775 socket with an 800 MHz system bus , 2.8Ghz to 3.8 GHz or higher Intel Celeron ( D ) processor in an LGA775 socket with a 533 MHz system bus , 2.8 GHz or higher Chipset ATI Radeon Xpress 200 Intel Edition Chipset with Integrated Graphics Processor System Memory DDR2 400 / DDR2533 / DDR2 667 , 2 banks Support for up to 4 GB system memory Expansion Slots 1x PCI Express 16X 1x PCI Express 1X 2x PCI Ethernet Controller LAN 10/100 ( Realtek RTL8100C ) FireWire ( IEEE 1394 ) Controller VIA VT6307 IEEE 1394 controller Audio Intel High Definition Audio subsystem using the Realtek ALC880 audio codec IDE ( HDD , ODD ) 4 x SATA connectors 1 x Ultra ATA-133 connector	St
1.11.1	pentium d 945 ( 3.4ghz ) and buy a 8800gtx graphic card , it would be perfect for your system and buy 2gb ddr2 ram of nice quality like crosrair , kingston , OCZ , etc .	St
1.12.1	I will get one of them and i was already thinking off getting a 8800gtx .	St
1.12.2	I know it may be a daft question but when removing and placing my new pentium is it just a case off unscrewing and removing the pentium or is they a bit more to it Many thanks again	St
1.13.1	it is only a processor that should be placed on the mobo by lifting up a panel and placing the processor and then closing the panel again chk the pics on the internet , but as for the heatsink there are something not screws ( i dnt knw what ) but its easy to put the processors	St
1.14.1	a collection high-priced parts doing nothing more than collecting dust .	St
1.14.2	Suspect you 'll need a BIOS update for the system to properly recognize and operate with the new CPU .	St
1.14.3	If you have n't already done so ... see what advice your PC mfg has regarding this .	St
1.14.4	What have you got to lose , especially about the CPU , BIOS updates a new GPU and perhaps new PSU .	St
1.14.5	Before you know it you 'll have the equivalent of a new system .	St
1.14.6	VAPCMD PS : And by all means be cautious of the advice you 're receiving .	St
1.14.7	Some of it comes from a poster who ca n't figure out what to buy for his own PC .	St
1.14.8	To wit ... the poster recommends a higher performance GPU but fails to point out that it 's likely to necessitate buying a more robust PSU to support it .	St
1.14.9	No more need be said .	St
1.15.1	If you have a Intel P4 at 3.06 GHz whay change the CPU.. ? ?	Ques
1.15.2	Maybe you should use the new OS from Microsoft instead..Vista.. or take a chance on a Full Version of XP-Professional..	St
1.15.3	This may increase the performance that you need.. ..	St
1.15.4	The Dual Core Processors start at about $ $ 300.00.. and even cost $ $ 1400.00 ..	St
1.15.5	I would check my software for Upgrade.. Because how do you know the CPU-specs w/o the Intel CPUID Utility..which only runs on an Intel Machine..	St
1.15.6	I would think that the Mobo you have w/P4 will NOT be recognized by Intel Diagnostic software.. ..	St
1.15.7	But its safe to try.. Go to : http : //www.intel.com and type in the Search Engine/CPUID Utility..you will get two choices..a Windows Download..and the Linux Download.. and some MS-DOS stuff..you should not need that.. RUN the CPUID Utility ... ..if it recognizes your Mobo Hardware you may be able to CONTACT Intel on whats-what..I doubt that the CPUID Utility will recognize your stuff..which should & quot ; stop & quot ; all other thoughts.. with the RAM changes your just createing alot of work/and worry..	St
1.15.8	Either work from the Intel website or rely on your Machine Support Team..do n't quess .	St
1.16.1	but the real super performer is called the Core 2 Duo .	St
1.16.2	That is the Conroe core developed by Intel 's Israeli group .	St
1.16.3	Totally different architecture .	St
1.16.4	Do not waste your money on the Duo Core .	St
1.16.5	Two different animals .	St
1.16.6	Duo cores are two P4 's stuck together with very high power consumption .	St
1.17.1	So is it worth me upgrading to duo core , or do i have no upgrade option , or does my mobo not support core 2 duo or duo core , And is my current pentium still good for good gaming .	Ques
1.17.2	Just a tad bit confussed LOL Many thanks	Polite
1.18.1	video card .	St
1.18.2	Are you using the onboard GPU now ?	Ques
1.18.3	Just keep in mind if you go the CPU route ... .got to make sure the PSU is up to the task .	St
1.18.4	Take a look at http : //www.tomshardware.com ..lots of good info on the current generation of video cards plus GPU performance comparison .	St
1.18.5	The good thing about the GPU upgrade or a better PSU is you can always move them to another system if you later decide on a heftier CPU .	St
1.18.6	If you go this route ... post the proposed components and we 'll give you some feedback .	St
1.18.7	VAPCMD	St
1.19.1	Im using ATI x1900xtx graphics at the min and i upgraded my psu to a 450 watts not sure what make .	St
1.19.2	I my just go with the new pc if it is going to be too much work and pain .	St
1.19.3	Is crossfire or Sli worth getting Again many thanks	Polite
1.20.1	and tell us exactly what MB ( mfg and model # ) and MB revision number if applicable you have .	St
1.20.2	MB mfgs are doing a better job of making CPU upgrade info available to end users .	St
1.20.3	If this is on off the shelf PC from a big boxmaker ... mfg , series and model number is required ... .the devil is in the detail .	St
1.20.4	VAPCMD	St
1.21.1	Here is what the program tells me ( sorry for the delay ) not sure whitch you wanted so ill attatch a bit Field	St
1.22.1	NIL	St
1.23.1	yes it is its the imedia 1529 the only changes ive made are PSU and graphics card	St
1.24.1	that it was Packard Bell and model number earlier .	St
1.24.2	Have you checked with Packard Bell ... they would be in the best position to tell you especially about CPU ugrades .	St
1.24.3	VAPCMD	St
1.25.1	read da previous discussion , u knw i was not replying bcuz its not a custom made comp , it is a packard bell its difficult to modify things in it better to sell full comp and make a custom one	St
1.26.1	My goof..	St
1.26.2	The best ( highest performance ) CPU your system supports is * Intel Pentium D Dual Core Technology Look at the choices at the link below ... the question you should ask Packard Bell ( just to be sure ) is which of these processors does your system support .	St
1.26.3	If possible go for the 65nm technology ... runs cooler .	St
1.26.4	http : //processorfinder.intel.com/List.aspx ? ProcFam=2112 & sSpec= & OrdCode= VAPCMD	St
1.27.1	some CPU options ... would be much easier if it was n't an off the shelf big box .	St
1.27.2	VAPCMD	St
1.28.1	ive asked on the packard bell fourm and awaiting a reply ill let you know what was said Cheers chris	St
1.29.1	on the forum they said any lga 775 pentium D should work .	St
1.29.2	I have the latest bios installed so whitch one should i go for im after the best one for gaming and will it run all vista options Cheers	St
1.30.1	you use VT then go for 950	St
1.31.1	at them ones soory to sound dumb but what is vt ? ? ?	Ques
1.31.2	?	Ques
1.32.1	VT- Virtualization Technology , go and search for yahoo it is used if there are two or more computers , and do u want a core2duo go in bios and check is there an option of FSB , it will be on stock 200 , for core2 duo you need the fsb 266 , so plz check is there any option in bios ( hit del while booting ) , and go in chipset option .	St
1.32.2	ok ... reply after checking	St
1.33.1	ill have to look tommorrow im at girlfreinds now but i think i can change the fsb but i think its locked and im not sure how to unlock it	St
1.34.1	there would be option for chipset or there would not be this option so u cant change it	St
1.35.1	suggesting things the posters system can not accept .	St
1.35.2	Subject poster is looking for specific help on an upgrade CPU for his existing system .	St
1.35.3	The info provided previously clearly shows his system can not accept anything faster than a Pentium D ..you suggested a 950 good !	St
1.35.4	But there are 3 versions of Intel Pentium D 950s ... help him figure out which to buy or which one to avoid .	St
1.35.5	No reason to discuss Core Duo or Core 2 Duo ... it just is n't relevant .	St
1.35.6	VAPCMD PS ... Did you ever figure out what CPU to put in your own system ?	Ques
1.36.1	there are bios upgrades comming and there will be surely a upgrade of c2d , and i think c2d and p-d are LGA775 socket ( same socket ) , only pentium d have high voltage and lower fsb that can be changed in bios .	St
1.36.2	rate the fsb till 266mhz from 200mhz	St
1.37.1	Users here are looking for answers they can execute on ... sure bets .	St
1.37.2	Not WAGs , not conjecture , not guesses and possibilites .	St
1.37.3	The recommendations should work as anticipated when installed , not if or when a BIOS upgrade is provided by in this case a big box mfg .	St
1.37.4	It 's likely they 're going to spend hard-earned money on your recommendation ... they deserve real working solutions .	St
1.37.5	If you 're not sure of an answer , look it up or skip that post .	St
1.37.6	For example you 'think ' the C2D is LGA 775 ?	Ques
1.37.7	If you 're not sure , again you have no business recommending it .	St
1.37.8	Again , users posting here assume people answering know what they 're talking about and that the answers come from first-hand knowledge or hands-on experience .	St
1.37.9	Recommend you refrain from muddying the water and stick to facts .	St
1.37.10	In this case the PB website clearly defines what CPUs work in the reference system and neither Core Duo or Core 2 Duo are even listed .	St
1.37.11	If you 're anxious to help ... help the user pinpoint which of the Pentium D 950 CPUs he might want to avoid ... that would be valuable and helpful .	St
1.37.12	Regards , VAPCMD	St
1.38.1	i was first having a ga-946g-s2 ( or s3 i forgot ) and it was not mentioned there that it was c2d compatible , but i installed a c2d e6300 and it worked it was rated fsb 200mhz but in bios i increased it to 266mhz now in the gigabyte site they have now mentioned c2d compatible ( by overclocking ) , so VAPCMD i am not hurting any1 .	St
1.38.2	ok if i am , i told the brockyneo to ask the tech support if it supports C2D by overclocking .	St
1.38.3	and about which pentium D 950 should he choose ?	Ques
1.38.4	wat do u mean by it there is only one pentium d 950 tht supports VT and is 3.4ghz , and pentium d 's are only made for offices and business works ( like editing a movie , music , picture , etc ) not for gaming	St
1.39.1	http : //www.intel.com/technology/virtualization/index.htm	St
1.40.1	Which one do i get lol like i said earlier i mainly wanted it to RUN vista well ( very well ) and for gameing ( very well ) .	St
1.40.2	And just some help on which type i should go for .	St
1.40.3	Again thanks for all your help people	Polite
1.41.1	what really is the difference between core 2 duo and pentium D. I know im limited to what i can upgrade to but which one would be best for say gameing or would they all be good enough to do the job Cheers	Ques
1.42.1	Pentium D 950 to be precise , you recommended .	St
1.42.2	sSpec #	St
1.43.1	skip the technical aspects of the CPUs and look at performance .	St
1.43.2	Bottomline , that 's what really matters .	St
1.43.3	http : //www.tomshardware.com and the difference in CPU performnace on games you play if possible .	St
1.43.4	You can also look at differences in GPU performance .	St
1.43.5	Keep us posted .	St
1.43.6	VAPCMD	St
1.44.1	ive looked around on google and it said if you have dual core or pentium d when you go to your device manager it should show 2 processors .	St
1.44.2	well mine does and im possitive mine is just single core ? ? ? ? ? ? .	Ques
1.44.3	maybe i read it wrong just trying to find web site again .	St
1.44.4	Also ive looked at tomhardware and you can get a pentium d to run really fast	St
1.45.1	going to get a pentium d as they seem to be very fast and are quite cheap concidering .	St
1.45.2	Still wounder why my devivce manager says i have 2 pcu ? ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.45.3	?	Ques
1.46.1	There are true dual core CPU 's like the Intel Core 2 Duo and AMD Athlon 64 X2 .	St
1.46.2	There are also single core Pentium 4 CPU 's that appear to Windows as having two cores , but are actually Hyper-Threading models .	St
1.47.1	Get the Pentium D 950 version SL9K8 or SL95V ... avoid the SL94P http : //processorfinder.intel.com/List.aspx ? ProcFam=2112 & sSpec=SL9K8 & OrdCode= Download and run CPUZ ... gives us some of the data off the first page .	St
1.47.2	VAPCMD	St
1.48.1	it could run vista well but not gaming , understand it please the Core2Duo 's frequency is double of Pentium D , and VAPCMD i know that it consumes less power and i will also tell the user to lower da voltage when he is ready to buy , as for gaming and vista i will stick wid c2d .	St
1.48.2	and dnt write the whole cpu-z information just go to http : //valid.x86-secret.com and paste the .cvf file ( The F7 key saves the validation cvf file in the current directory . )	St
1.49.1	Name =Intel pentium 4 524 Coadname =Prescott Package =Socket 775 LGA Techonology =90nm Voltage =1.376 Rated FSB =532.0mhz Any more info needed just ask .	St
1.49.2	Is they a real significant difference between core 2 duo and pentium D and i thought core 2 dou was a completely different size and socket	St
1.50.1	Will pentium D run vista new interface ( aero ) and i have read else where that pentium D is quite fast for gaming .	St
1.50.2	As you can tell i use my pc mainly for gaming .	St
1.50.3	Proberly easyer to buy a full new system but id like to have a go at altering my pc my self lol and stop paying silly prices that shops charge .	St
1.50.4	As far as core 2 duo goes even if somehow i did get it to work would i see much difference in gameing .	St
1.50.5	cheers chris	Polite
1.51.1	I have looked at this one but it does not seem to have VT. May spend a bit more what do you think http : //cgi.ebay.co.uk/INTEL-PENTIUM-D-3-4GHz-945-SKT775-DUEL-CORE-OEM-CPU_W0QQitemZ320072249892QQihZ011QQcategoryZ80143QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem	St
1.52.1	is only what the resller offers ( usually 15-30 days ) VS the 3yr warranty provided with the retail version listed as product & quot ; BX80553945 & quot ; ... .and you get a HS FAN too .	St
1.52.2	It will run Vista too .	St
1.52.3	Core 2 Duo ..is faster ... but depends on the application or game .	St
1.52.4	However it would be a real crap shoot that it would work at all or as designed with all features in your system .	St
1.52.5	You really should have thought this through earlier ... for all you 've spent plus a few $ $ you could have had a new better PC suited for gaming .	St
1.52.6	Re doing it yourself vice paying someone ..	St
1.52.7	I vote for the latter .	St
1.52.8	Better to pay a few $ $ to have it done professionally than botch the job and possibly lose the CPU too .	St
1.52.9	It is n't quite as simple as slapping in a GPU or RAM and it 's a lot more delicate .	St
1.52.10	Let us know VAPCMD	St
1.53.1	i took your advice and bought a new motherboard i put it all tohether then tried to boot .	St
1.53.2	Booted but nothing happened then i notice it uses a 8 pin power connector ahhhhh.just waiting to get a converter today .	St
1.53.3	Any way themotherbord is a ecs p965t-a from pc world .	St
1.53.4	It supports core 2 duo ( have a look at specs ) .	St
1.53.5	And apparently crossfire but One pci x16 runs at x16 and the onerone when two card a running runs at pci x4 do you have any reason on why that is and is it still crossfire cheers chris	St
1.54.1	My new motherboard uses a 8 pin power suply and my PSU uses a 4 pin power .	St
1.54.2	I have connected them toogether and seems to work ok but is this safe .	St
1.54.3	Been on my motherboard fourms and they say that they say it should be ok. chris	St
