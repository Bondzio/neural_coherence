not sure i am in the rigth forum.
i am looking for an inexpensive monitor for work.
i definitely want a 5:4 aspect ratio, not a wide screen.
i am looking at three hanns g comparable 19 inch models.
the differences seem so minor that i can't make out what is significant.
models are jc199apd, hh191dpb, and hx191dpb.
