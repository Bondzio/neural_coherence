i use killdisk to clean my drives.
freeware that does a good job.
just put in on a cd, floppy, thumb drive, and boot to it and run the program.
this is assuming you're not interested in any of the data on the drive.
i use it at work to clean the drives of old/replaced pcs before we dispose of them.
typically we donate them or offer them for free to whoever wants them.
it saves us the cost of recycling.
people can get a usable pc that's still good for most everyday use.
usually 4-5 years old.
