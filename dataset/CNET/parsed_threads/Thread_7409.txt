<s> I am looking at purchasing a Dell Inspiron 530 2 choices : Intel Core 2 Duo Processor E4500(2mb L2 Cache, 2.20GHz, 800 FSB) Windows XP 2GB Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM at 667MHz-2DIMMs 20 inch Monitor 500GB serial ATA Hard Drive (7200RPM)w/DataBurst Cache 19 in 1 Media card reader 16x DVD=/RW Drive This is $828 or same as above with Vista Home Premium Dual drives 48x CDRW/DVD COMBO Drive + 16xDVD+/-RW Drive $799 Should I go with the XP and sacrifice the Dual Optical Drive? </s>
<s> Does it matter? </s>
<s> I know the price difference is insignificant. </s>
<s> I am currently using a 8 yr old HP Pavillion with upgraded XP 850 Mhz 256 MB I had ME and it was a complete disaster! </s>
<s> I do not want to go through it again with Vista. </s>
<s> I guess I need reassurance that it's a good OS or stay with my trusty XP. </s>
<s> Any advice? </s>
<s> XP was suppose to be out of the picture by now but Vista still has issues and thus being offered. </s>
<s> If you want Vista, get it, if not and far more stable use XP. </s>
<s> As for the dual optical drive, you can always add that later, even Vista should you need to provided you went with the XP system. </s>
<s> The difference isn't that great and IMHO, you'll be more happy with XP based system. </s>
<s> Dell, is also having some problems with Vista itself for whatever reason as least it seems so. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> But for those with old printers, cameras, scanners it will be. </s>
<s> You may find my posts about &quot;Vista is the new Windows ME&quot; which is turning out to be true for those that have old gear. </s>
<s> If you don't have the old baggage then it's usually OK with just a few tweaks (and 2GB RAM!) </s>
