ok so i was installing a program and i was asked to reboot, so i did, and the same thing again, flashing cursor no booting.
i dont get it i tried to restart the computer like 20 times before i changed the ide and it never booted up, then all of a sudden after the new ide it worked.
now heres the kicker this is the computer that im on now, when i connected the new ide the master hdd had the jumper set in 3rd place and the slave hdd had it set in first.
when the cpu wouldnt reboot after that program install i changed the jumper to the second position (i have the manual for the new master hdd but not the old slave hdd) so i didnt know for sure which jumper position is right.
well thats where i got the error that i expected, so i turned of the cpu and took the jumper off completely and restarted it, it loaded windows quicker than i have ever seen it do before.
ok so i installed another program that required a reboot and same thing, so i tried the same thing (2nd jumper position restart error no jumper quick windows load) and thats the point im at now.
oh and one more thing, before i did anything with the jumpers i disconnected the drive completely because of the fact i didnt have the manual and couldnt remember the jumper setting for slave drive, and i didnt get a single reboot after numerous tries, so then i tried what i described above.
so my question is does anyone have an idea as to what all this could mean?
why is that back and forth jumper setting getting my windows to load?
and how could it all of a sudden load windows so quick?
thanks.
