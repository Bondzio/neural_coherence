<s> I am running XP Pro with a Sony 710A drive and have tried Nero 6 to back up some home video files that are .avi format and have already made 2 expensive coasters. </s>
<s> I have no idea if I should bother with DL format or just use a bunch of single layer DVDs. </s>
<s> I am not new to computers, but new to doing this. </s>
<s> Can someone help me out, please?? </s>
<s> My camcorder is a Sony Hi-8 and I am copying the video using the DV cable into Windows Movie Maker. </s>
<s> Then, trying to copy the file with Nero UDF. </s>
<s> I don't even know what the difference is with the UDF formats and the UDF physical or virtual format. </s>
<s> Is it better to copy with UDF 2.01 or does it matter? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for the help! </s>

<s> Since all we need to do is &quot;backup&quot; and no conversion to DVD playable format is noted, CDBURNERXP is free and what I use to do this. </s>
<s> Hint? </s>
<s> google.com Bob </s>
<s> I checked out CDBURNERXP & it does not look like it supports double layer DVDs. </s>
<s> My videos are very long & will need either 2 DL or 4 single layer DVDs to back up. </s>
<s> I'll keep my eye open for when they release the new version of CDBURNERXP which is supposed to support dual layer. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
