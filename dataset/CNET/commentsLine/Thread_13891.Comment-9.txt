i returned the wd drive and traded it for a lacie like my other one.
i partitioned it and superduper!
made a bootable clone of my internal hd.
no problems starting up from the clone.
my conclusion is that either the wd fw800 drive will not start an older mac or possibly superduper!
may need to be updated.
i will drop them a note so they will be aware of the situation.
i guess another possibility is that wd's drive might require an os later than mine (10.4.11) to be bootable.
