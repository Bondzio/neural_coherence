1.1.1	Windows XP home w/sp2 - ASUS A8V - 256 RAM - Athlon CPU I added a new 160GB internal SATA hard drive.	St
1.1.2	I ENABLED the SATA Boot Rom in the BIOS and re-booted.	St
1.1.3	When the opening screens are flashing by, I see the drive has been detected and is listed.	St
1.1.4	But when Windows comes up and I click on My Computer, it is not listed.	St
1.1.5	What am I missing?	St
1.2.1	To get them showing you install SATA or motherboard drivers.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Hello, You need to make sure that you have the SATA drivers installed.	St
1.3.2	If you do & the drive still doesn't show up, you probably need to format the hard drive.	St
1.3.3	It's easy, just Google FORMAT HARD DRIVE & you shouldn't have any trouble finding a how to.	St
1.3.4	Good Luck	St
1.4.1	I looked on the Maxtor site and did not see a driver and I looked on the ASUS site and got the same result.	St
1.4.2	I did a search on the NET and found a MaxBlaster, but that looks like a utility not a driver.	St
1.4.3	I thought I had found something, but now my 160G Maxtor 6V160EO drive is showing up as a 149G SCSI.	St
1.5.1	Sometimes it is called an SATA/RAID driver.	St
1.5.2	On Asus.com, there is a SATA/RAID driver for that board: VIA VT6420 (VT8237) SATA RAID Driver Package Version 2.20D WHQL It's just not at the top of the drivers list.	St
1.6.1	160GB (decimal, the way we count) = 149GB (binary, the way computers count) This is because a decimal gigabyte is defined as 1,000,000,000 bytes, and a binary gigabyte (actually a GibiByte) is defined as 1,073,741,824 bytes.	St
1.6.2	More info than most want to know: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix The bottom line is that you can expect a computer to calculate a difference of close to 7% less than the decimal size indicated on the hard disk retail packaging.	St
1.6.3	Strange, but common.	St
