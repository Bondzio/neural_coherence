<s> We have the topology down load for the XP PC. </s>
<s> Your system has modem, switch, Vista PC has two adapters, XP has two adapters. </s>
<s> We do have connectivity when we connect directly to the net with both computers. </s>
<s> What is the sequence of connection for this set up? </s>
<s> This is the problem: http://img151.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenhunter03may091814qk9.gif This is all the information that is given in the set up for the connection. </s>
<s> This shows two wires going into the Host PC be does not show how the connections are made. </s>
<s> Two wires can not fit into a single plug. </s>
<s> How is this done? </s>
<s> No additional hardware specifications are supplied. </s>
<s> Is an additional adapter needed? </s>
<s> Maybe a splitter? </s>
<s> When we connect adapter too adapter we get a cable unplugged warning. </s>

<s> It's amazing that someone bought a switch instead of a router give they cost about the same. </s>
<s> You assume to much. </s>
<s> Routers about $50.00. </s>
<s> I did get the ICS connection between the two PCs working, by putting the switch between them but this created other problems, that created other problems, that created other problems. </s>
<s> So that's it for ICS connections for me. </s>
<s> I could get most everything to work but not together, so, off to the router store I go. </s>
<s> The working ICS connection was: DSL to modem, to NIC adapter. </s>
<s> Then out the second adapter, on PC1, to a switch, to the second PC2 but then I couldn't connect to the net. </s>
<s> The switch broke the &quot;adapter unplugged&quot; error I was receiving and let them communicate. </s>
<s> The real bottom line here is that MS should get there instructions straightened out. </s>
<s> It more then likely can be done but not with the gap they've left in the instructions. </s>
<s> See the instructions in your Vista laptop. </s>
<s> I did learn a great deal about ipconfig while fooling with this. </s>
<s> Had some problems with ipconfig/flushdsn. </s>
<s> This is the second time in several weeks I've needed to use this. </s>
<s> We might want to watch for these, it seems to be a Vista thing. </s>
<s> The symptoms are web pages that will not show up, sometimes consistently, some times intermittently. </s>
<s> When other methods do not work, try this, it works. </s>
<s> My cheapest router was 19.99 at fry's. </s>
<s> It was not on sale. </s>
<s> You have a finicky setup so good luck with it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If you catch me doing it, let me know and I'll do the same for you. </s>
<s> We both have room for improvement. </s>
<s> That was a sale price on the switch. </s>
<s> I got it just as the change over to wireless went into full swing. </s>
<s> Nice switch. </s>
<s> Maybe I'll get a couple of those USB adapters for this mini LAN. </s>
<s> Just two PCs, 15 feet apart. </s>
<s> Have you heard much about those AC electrical adapter that they have out. </s>
<s> Sounds interesting, just plug it in to a wall outlet and no security risks like wireless with eves droppers or connectivity theft. </s>
<s> Seems they could boost the signal with this type of connection and really send it some distance, miles instead of yards. </s>
<s> I know this can be a problem, I'm on the edge of my sending area and can't up grade because of it. </s>
