If you can't get into the BIOS and you don't know the make/model of your machine or board, USBMAN won't help much.
As to the BIOS, check the manual or tell the make/model of machine or board.
Generic boards use the Del key, and USBMAN notes that USB should be &quot;Enabled.&quot; The error messages in Windows are often mis-programmed and &quot;denied&quot; could be because your account is not capable of installing drivers (Administrator capable?)
or the USB ports are disabled.
