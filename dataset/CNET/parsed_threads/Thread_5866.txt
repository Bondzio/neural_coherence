<s> Just purchased a Netgear Wireless N-300 Router to use with an HP 311 netbook, equipped with a wireless N card and running Windows XP. </s>
<s> I also have a desktop with Windows XP, not that this matters as far as the router is concerned I'm sure. </s>
<s> My question is did I purchase the right router to use with my HP, or should I have gone with the more expensive &quot;RangeMax Dual Band Wireless N&quot; router? </s>
<s> Your help will be appreciated. </s>
<s> Note: The Best Buy people recommended the N-300 Router and seemed to think the Dual Band was overkill. </s>
<s> I have the simple wrn2000 here and some 3500 that I'll switch to when time permits. </s>
