56	2	97688	1120826	1119516	AkifKhan	4/13/05 4:59 AM	1.11336834E12	hmm....... and apllications query	I dont see a TV tuner on it. Tough, the box mentions &quot;TV FEATURES&quot; on it. Anyways, My Video-IN drivers are now working fine. The only thing not is &quot;nVIDIA WDM TVTuner&quot;. The problem i have now, is that I cant recieve a full screen video. I recieve channels, but not full screen. I use WINDVD Creator. What other options do i have?
