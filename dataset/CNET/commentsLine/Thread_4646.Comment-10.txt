hi, i know that this post may not be totally related to the topic.
but i hava a macbook pro and at home i can connect to my wireless network i setup which doesn't require a password and the internet speed is exceptionally quick.
but for my work's wireless network, it's a password protected wireless network and my question is why the internet speed is noticeably slower when both use adsl internet?
