<s> I was helping my Dad configure things on his PC. </s>
<s> It suddenly started to reboot by itself, but nothing appeared on the monitor. </s>
<s> I tried to shut it down by pressing the Power button on the tower. </s>
<s> When it wouldn't react, I held in the Power button until it started to reboot again. </s>
<s> This time all I got from what I believe is the PC speaker is an audible beep that lasts 1/2 second, then repeats about every 5 seconds. </s>
<s> The beep is much like you'd hear on public utility equipment when it warns surrouning drivers of its presence. </s>
<s> I have no idea whether the hard drive or power supply has failed, or what the problem might be. </s>
<s> This PC is a Pentum III, 450 MHz, Windows XP Home (SP2), with an Asus MB (don't have model no. </s>
<s> written donwn), and likely a 40MB hard drive that wasn't nearing capacity last time we checked. </s>
<s> An external ION 60MB hard drive is installed that was only added to keep a specific program's records isolated. </s>
<s> Other hardware consists of a floppy disk drive and a Creative PC-DVD drive (believe this is a CD/DVD reader only), Microsoft Internet Pro keyboard and Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer mouse. </s>
<s> Yes, we know this is an old system, but it's used primarily for e-mail and stock quotes by an elderly couple. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any experience with this type of failure, where a repeating audible beep is heard when the tower's Power button is pressed to boot the PC? </s>
<s> Any clues what might have happened, or what component might be producing the problem? </s>
<s> I'm not sure if this will be able to narrow te problem down. </s>
