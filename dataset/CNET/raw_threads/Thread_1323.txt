Hi, I am planning to buy a LCD monitor (Dell SP2309W) as an add-on for my PC (HP Pavilion DV6700) which has NVIDIA GeForce 8400M GS graphics card. The native resolution of the LCD is 2048 x 1152. I have a VGA output port on my laptop, but no HDMI/DVI. Can my laptop handle this resolution on the LCD? And should I buy a VGA-to-DVI adapter to improve the image quality on the LCD. I don't wanna invest in the monitor only to find out that I cannot make use of the full resolution. thanks
