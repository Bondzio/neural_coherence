<s> Boot up into the BIOS screen. </s>
<s> This is done by pressing the DEL key, but it varies from system to system and is shown on your post screen as you are booting up. </s>
<s> Check to see if the WOL option (Wakeup On Lan) is enabled. </s>
<s> There is also may be a modem ring option....disable that if it is enabled. </s>
<s> See if that helps. </s>
