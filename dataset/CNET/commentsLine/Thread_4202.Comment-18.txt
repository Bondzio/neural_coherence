the power one circuit is on the mainboard.
if you are an electronics wizard/maven, there is another way to power up if you are so inclined.
notes that the green wire to a black wire can be connected to a toggle switch to tell the psu to power up.
i use at and now atx supplies for other than pc projects since they are cheap and plentiful.
if it is just the power control circuit that has a defect and you are on some siberian outback, this could save you a trip across the tundra.
