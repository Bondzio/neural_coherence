Can an ibook and 2 pc desktops be easily put on a network with a wireless router? I don't need to interact between the computers, I just want to be able for all 3 computers to use the Internet. Any recommendations on which router to use? I do know that the laptop is 802.11b technology. Thanks for any info you can give me.

I just set the Mac, PC, other thing to &quot;obtain an address&quot; or &quot;DHCP&quot; and that's it. If one has secured the WIFI network, one will have to enter that information again to the new device. However, if it doesn't work, set the WIFI network to open/unsecured to get it working then find if WEP works, etc... Bob
