It told me to proceed. I clicked yes, and it looked like it entered Safe Mode (4 bit, 640 x 480). There were no messages. I reset the color setting to normal and reboot. XP loaded but said Win XP encoutnered a serious error. But everything seemed normal except for my wallpaper that had patterns as if it were in &quot;halftone.&quot; (The problem went away when I reapplied the wallpaper.) I ran the usual aps, checked for viruses and spyware, none found. Today I was using IE, MSN Messenger and Windows Media Player when I heard a beep sound and everything froze for about a minute. Then the screen went black for a few second then went into Safe Mode with the low res colors. An error message said there had been a device failure and that I should save my work. I restarted the computer and it was fine. I just replaced my monitor a few days before any of these happened. I also notice a loud sound and light coming from my floppy disk drive after it is used, as if the computer is still reading it. Could it be a hard disk faailure? But shouldn't there be an error message about it? With Win98 I could tell when the HD was conking out because it always ran a scandisk at the start. Could it be the video card? Thanks,

The AGP slot is very tight and it is easy for a card to come loose if it was not absolutely fully inserted. Your statement; &gt;&gt;A couple of days ago I got a system error message during XP's startup. It told me to proceed. I clicked yes, and it looked like it entered Safe Mode (4 bit, 640 x 480).&lt;&lt;&lt; It told you to proceed or it offered proceeding as one option??? Was it actually in Safe Mode??? In safe mode the words safe mode are shown in all four corners of the screen. When does the beeping occur?? During boot a video problem can be one cause of the beep. As to the hard drive. Does you have smart drive enabled in the BIOS?? If enabled it is pretty good at alerting one to potential hard drive problems before it is too late.

Now that you mentioned it, I don't recall seeing the Safe Mode message in the corners...so it could be the video card (it's not onboard). The beep ocurred only once when I was using IE, then the screen went black for a couple of seconds. I run scandisk regulalry and it hasn't reported anything. BTW, will XP ''know'' if a monitor is defective? I've used XP on a defective monitor (colors all pink) and XP didn't show any error messages. Again, thank you for your suggestion about reinserting the video card. Regards,
