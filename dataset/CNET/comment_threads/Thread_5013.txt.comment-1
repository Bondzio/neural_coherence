Hi, I am trying to do a software upgrade on my dad's old computer (bought on 2007).
It came with Windows Vista x32bit Home Edition installed on it, and my father has been complaining for quite a while that it's annoyingly slow and buggy so I thought I'd finally upgrade it for him.
So I run the Windows 7 Upgrade advisor, and it tells me that I'm good to go and everything is compatible (yaaay!).
I have an original copy of Windows 7 x32bit and I wanted for starters to install it, not on C, but on another insternal Hard Drive the computer has, just so he can see the interface and all before making the change.
So I boot from CD, it loads the files and before even getting to the installation screen I get this: http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/7888/jxfl.jpg So all this seems gibberish to me and I really have no clue of what to do exactly..
Roughly the System Specification are these: OS: Microsoft Windows Vista Home Edition x32bitCPU: Intel Pentium Dual CPU E2160 @ 1.80GHz 1.79 GHzGPU: NVIDIA GeForce 8400 GSRAM: 2gb If needed, I can also provide you with a txt file that has a hardware report exported by the Everest application.
