I have been an AMD man for many years but with the Intel duo E8400 coming out I switched. So now I have an Intel Core2 DUO E8400 dual running at 3.0 GHZ with 2 gigs of PC2-8500 dual channel Ram. The motherboard is a Gigabyte P35-DS3L. I kept my old 500gig SATA2 Seagate and my Antec case, LG DVD drive and 650W power supply. I also kept my Nvida Gforce 7300 512M video card. What a difference between my old overclocked AMD X2 4800 running at 2.6 GHZ and the new Intel. I hate to admit it but I was wrong all these years about AMD being the best. Intel rules. Oh well we learn by doing.

About Six months ago my P4, 3 gig mobo went south for the second time, so I decided it was time for a new system. Went with a Core 2 quad, 2.4 gig, 4 gig ram, Vista Business, duel Nvida 8800 GT's (SLI) with duel Acer 22&quot; widescreen LCD's. Originally I went with a Creative Audigy card but recently switched to a Razor instead. Love it! Bill

The whole thing cost me about $800 and can play any of today's games on max settings perfectly (except Crysis, that's not fair). Does everything with zero problems, I installed Vista Ultimate with no slowdown. I completely reformat it every 2 months or so to keep it running fast.

Have a ~7 year old HP laptop ... adequate because I require so little of it. Also an old Compaq driven by Linux/Ubuntu and a Mac PowerPC G4 with OS-X 10.4. Do web development on the XP/Pro machine, use the others to check web compatibility and to play with. New machine can be overclocked and the socket will take several CPU upgrades. Waiting for Windows 7 to spring for 64-bit computing. As is, am pleased with configurations.

I traveled around the US with it for two years and then coffee shop visits for 3 more. I bought it when it was at least a year old and refurbished. It had to have the hard drive replaced while under warranty but really hasn't given me too much trouble until I tried to run Windows XP.

The computer was built by a custom house in new york, and has a Q6600 quad processor, 4 gig of ram and 3 internal hard drives. I had windows Vista installed and Microsoft Office Small Business. I have also added tons of other things too. I use Pinnacle Studio 10 on it, and it is really a pleasure to do video editing with a quad processor and 4 gig of ram. It works smooth as silk. I also have Nero 8 installed too. I use Firefox 3 with Thunderbird 2. Also have Adobe Reader, Irfanview, Picasa 3, Hypersnap 6 which is a windows capture program, also i tunes and quick time. I have three other browser including IE7 which I never use. I use Zone Alarm and AVG 8 both free programs for security. There are also several other support type programs installed. Best computer that I have ever owned. Spared no expense to have what I wanted. I also have Memeo as a back up program for my 750 Western Digital Free Agent drive. I also have a nice array of Vista gadget programs sitting on the right side of my 24&quot; wide screen Samsung Monitor.

Secondary computer is also less than a year old - a Dell Latitude D830 laptop. Purchased both because I wanted to get a new desktop and new laptop with Windows XP while it was still available and avoid changing to Vista.

After tweaking similarly aged PCs owned by friends & neighbors, I learned that it is a matter of optimizing one's PC that he gets the best out of it. Even six-year old PCs can come to life like new if the proper tweaks, software & hardware, are made. A friend of mine had a Windows Vista but because he knew little found himself complaining his PC is slow. When I did the usual tweaking I do, I found out he could not achieve the speeds that his PC had because he did not take good care of it. Some of the software I have tried that worked includes ATF Cleaner, CCleaner, nCleaner and Tune Up Utilities.

It has a Core 2 Duo T5600, and 3 GB of PC2-5300 DDR2, running Vista Home Premium. I hated Vista until I got this unit. The fact that it came with Service Pack 1 helped (I still refuse to touch 64-bit Vista), as does this machine's power. I have two other computers of my own, one of which came with Vista Home Premium, and the other with Home Basic. Both of them are now running XP Pro, because I couldn't stand the performance and instability. Even downloading SP1 fixed nothing; it doesn't seem to do any good unless it comes pre-installed. One is 2 years old, and the other about 1 year old.

Started with am intel DX38BT Motherboard, combined that with 4g of DDR3 Memoryand q6600 cpu added a pair of ATI 3800`s in Crossfire, added a pvr 3000 video/tv card and 2 300g HDD`S and dual dvd drives with a memory card reader, all in Chakra case. Put the whole thing together with 2 Asus pw19 Monitors(The most sexy looking monitors in my opinion ever) and just for good measure and good looks a DiNovo Edge Keyboard and an MX revolution Mouse. The black beauty runs on vista ultimate sp1, and I have never had any problems with it.I would also imagine that unless it gets stolen this machine will see me well through the next windows os, with the possible exception of upgrading the cpu to a q900 series.

Battery life is...rather pitiful when compared to the iBook I refurbished - granted the iBook used no more than 45W at full power, the C2D CPU uses that much power itself - but I got it because of it's gaming ability.

I don't know its age, but it's probably 4 to 6 years. It has Windows XP Professional. I wanted a change because my previous machine had Windows ME. The new purchase has 512MB RAM and a 40GB disk. It doesn't have a CD burner, but I could have had one for a few pounds more. I use my computer mainly for web browsing, word processing and radio streaming. It plays video, but I don't use that function much. I wondered whether I should risk 50 on what could turn out to be a waste of money. It has turned out to be one of the best bargains I've ever had. My old PC wouldn't accept the data transfer wizard, but I tranferred most stuff I needed with a 1GB flash drive, and emailed other stuff to myself. Pictures can also be stored on a photo processing site, then downloaded to a different computer. There's a way round any problem. I've done a free online virus check on my new buy. Everything's fine. Unless you want the latest bells and whistles, a second-hand PC seems to be a great buy.

I have a six-year-old Dell Dimension 2300 with an Intel Celeron 1.8 GHz processor and Windows XP. I still have a 3.5&quot; floppy drive (do they still make those? Do people even *use* them anymore?), but I haven't used it in ages. The only upgrades I've made to it are adding 1 GB RAM to the memory, and an external DVD-RW drive. The thing still chugs along pretty well, but I'm thinking of upgrading very soon, once finances to do so become more available.

It's not the latest, nor the greatest, but after several years of doing a good job for me, I still use the old girl. and it's helped after maxing out her ram (4 512mb SD-Ram sticks making a total of 2gb of Ram), replacing her old PowerPC 400mhz proccessor with a 1.8ghz processor. Giving her 2 graphics cards 1 being an ATI AGP 9800 pro card, and the other being an ATI PCI 7800 card. 4 monitors, a 20 inch widescreen HP LCD monitor, a 17 inch HP LCD monitor, a 15 inch samsung LCD monitor and an old 28 inch GE TV that I play most my movies on. Given her 2 internal 120gb replacing the single 20gb hardrive that was in her. Even replaced the original Zip drive with a GeeThree: Sweet Multiport. She even still uses an original Apple airport card. All in all since I'm not a big gamer and more a movie nut I mostly play several DVD's , Divx, Xvid, iTunes, and quicktime movies on her plus casual web browsing. She also does hard work encoding video's over an Xgrid with my much older G3 iMac witch was recently upgraded to 1gb. ancient technology you say? Yes. Does it get the job done? HELL YEAH!!!! XD (And for those that want to know I'm still running Tiger on the G4 and G3 since it was the last great OS for the PowerPC architecture.)

You only get to erase it a certain number of times before its no good. Have you ever tried using something like CCleaner? Or how Disk Cleanup and Disk Defrag? I know reformatting keeps the thing fast, but every time you have to reload all your games, programs, and other apps (unless you have complete hard drive backup images). Now I use CCleaner and Revo Uninstaller. These clean out all the junk and remove any unused programs at my discretion without leftover registry entries. Keeps my Vista x64 PC running as quickly as the day I built it. I run Intel Core2Duo E7200 at 2.53 GHz, 4 gigs of DDR2 at 667 MHz, GeForce graphics card, and a 250 GB SATA II hard drive. Ultimately, what you do is your choice, but the above programs/suggestions may make your computing life a little easier.

Hard drive died last year, which surprised me (ThinkPads are normally synonymous with quality) but was actually a blessing in disguise. I put in a new 100 GB hd and installed Ubuntu. Ubuntu takes advantage of all the fun stuff this ThinkPad can do, so in no way do I miss Windows. This machine, with a 2GHz processor and 1.2GB ram, has exceeded my expectations in every way. Talk about a workhorse.

I mostly use it for word-processing and surfing the Internet, but I would like the functionality of the Intel Apples to be able to run Windows for some of the applications I want to use. I have Virtual PC but it runs really slowly and the screen is tiny. But I have loved this computer more than the ones I have had before--I have had Macs since 1984 and the very first one with 128k RAM! I am interested in the new line of Apple laptops, which I have yet to see. My new laptop will be, as it is now, my only computer, so I am swithering between the portability of the Macbooks and the bigger screen on the MacbookPro. I am not sure that I need that much power though and the price difference is significant.Or maybe I will just stick with what I have until it won't do what I need it to do. Carole

Well now 4 yrs later the only original part is the Mobo. I've cut holes in the side panel added additional RAM, Fans & Lights recently a new Heatsink fan.

I have an AMD Athlon XP 3200 CPU on a SOYO Dragon MB with a gig of ram, 160 gig WD HD, ATI 128 AGP graphics, Creative Labs sound with XP as the OS. I keep it alive and it still serves me well for graphics and work. I've been working with PC's since the dawn of the Tandy Home computer. Heck I even had an Osborne. What gets me is how we've become slave to the OS rather than the other way around. Every upgrade that comes out from Microsoft has required a substantial hardware upgrade which creates an incredible surge in the waste stream. My question to everyone is, do you really need that much computing power? The average home user never hits the limit of their PCs' capability because all they're doing is sending e-mails and surfing the net. That can be done with cheap, less power hungry boxes or laptops. I still recall my favorite software bundle of all time. It was Geoworks and it would run on a 286. AOL actually used it as their GUI before switching to then Windows 3.1. Geoworks had everything a home user needed. I know some people like to chase the technology but think about it. Over time, how much money do you spend doing that and do you really need that much power ? Will you ever reach the full capability of your PC if you are an average home user? (providing that you're not into high order fragging) Take care !!

I have automatic security update but most of the time it doesn't work. It will show as being installed but its not there. It will be in my update history but not in my add/remove programs. I'm trying right now to install a 90 day trail for anti-virus. 90 days is a long time for limited/fixed income. I get so far and get an error report. start over, another error. I don't have any idea what these errors are or why. I follow instructions so in my thinking it should be simple, no, doesn't happen. Is it because the computer is too old or I'm too old and stupid. I don't know if you can help or not but maybe a couple of suggestions.

This past spring, I decided I'd had it with crashes and other maintenance issues with &quot;Microsoft Windows&quot; based machines....been using them for over 10 years. So I decided to try the switch to an Apple product. Bought a Mac mini, learned how to use OS X and then sold the Mini to a friend. I then purchased a Mac Pro with dual 2.8GHz processors, installed 16GB's of RAM and have never looked back. It's powerful,OS X runs smoothly and it does everything I used to do on my Windows machines without the hassles. HD video editing, photo editing and even gaming are all fun now! No OS or hardware is perfect but this is as close to perfection as modern technology allows.

So far it's been a great unit, both for experimenting and everyday computing. I don't beleive it is a matter of how old the computer is.. it is a matter of will the computer still do what you need it to with a reasonable speed and accuracy. I have large drives because I do a lot of photo and video, and the machine was built from ordered parts and I have not had any problems ( that I didn't cause myself). The computer industry is full of hype about Bigger , Better, Faster. If they didn't, they wouldn't be in business for long. If it works - Don't fix it, and don't replace it... unless you really need to. And if you look hard enough, you caan still find parts for the older machines. my 2 CDN

My main desktop is an HP Pavilion which I bought in December of 2001. I just this week upgraded it to 2 GB RAM and it's leaping around like an Olympic jumper! A Great machine, it seems to not be showing its age. 2.4 GHz P4, with 2 GB RAM, an 80 GB HD, a CD/DVD RW (Burner) and all other stuff seems to have been brandy new, even though it is not. It works like a charm. My laptop is less than a year, and it runs Vista SP1 like a new-born, no problems, it's an Acer 5920 Aspire, and is a joy to use. Alas, I picked up a Trojan and am going to rebuild it but that will take me all of an afternoon and it will be back in business. They're truly making better machines these days, and thanks to that, it is easier to deal with problems than it ever used to be. So, the 7 year old HP Desktop Pavilion, and the &gt; 1 yea old Acer Aspire laptop, and I couldn't be happier with my hardware. (Once more, please forgive any glaring spelling errors ...). -a.

What is remarkable is that as we all learn more about the technology, we become more able to manage what we have, rather than immediately say, &quot;I gotta get new stuff!&quot; And be it a MAC or a Windows machine, we all are indeed learning more - thanks to fora like this and other locations, in which we can share information, ideas, suggestions, and the like. Folks, without the trumpets, we have walked quietly into the information age, and it's a nice place to be. We can relax, sit and learn from others, teach if we want to and are qualified to do so ... So, my thanks to all from whom I am learning - and I've been working with PCs since 1985 and computers since ... well, I don't want to give away how old I really am &lt;BG&gt;!

Since my wife was starting a college course, I wanted her to be able to use our faster, newer computer, but also was working at home using it. So we decided that we should get a newer computer a couple of months ago and retire the older Dell. Since I buy a computer to last a few years, I usually pay a little more ($1100) to get something that will last a little longer. This time: Dell XPS-420 Q9450 2.66GHz. quad-core processor (12Mb. of cache), FSB 1.33GHz. Memory 3Gb. 800MHz. DDR. 320Gb.

It came with Windows ME(horrible), and 128 MB of memory. I added XP and more memory(512 MB). Oh, it also came with a modem because I had dial-up access at first. I keep it clean and tuned up and it serves me well.

My old more expensive unit took forever to start up or shut down. The new cheaper one is very quick. The best thing is I had to jump thru hoops to run my old programs on the older computer but the newer one runs these programs without a problem. Years ago, when a computer cost thousands of dollars, it was expensive to upgrade. Now adays, $500 can get you a pretty good machine. If you are a gamer and need a better machine. There are a number of places who will build a super one for you for a $1000 that will last a good long time.

The Toshiba was an inexpensive little laptop, but has proven to be extremely fast, with an incredible memory capacity. I have a secondary laptop, an eight-year-old Gateway, that still works remarkably well.

It is starting to show its age, however. By today's standards, it is out right old, but the games I play are about as old as it is. And honestly, for web or office applications, it is just fine (as it was three years ago when I built it.) Im dreaming of a new dual core system for Christmas. LOL

I know some are asking why did you buy it? Well, that's the catch. I didn't. When someone is buying you something, you take it, even if you don't want or like it. If it had been my money, I would have bought a Sony. The pc in question is a custom a1750y series HP 3 gig using Vista. Prior to that, I was on another HP, that was purchased in 1999, the 6746C 733-MHZ using Windows Me. I basically skipped over the XP thing where folk preferred it to Vista. I prefer Windows 98 to all other OS, even though Vista is just fine to me.

When i first build the computer, I was running an Dual Core e6600, and a Nvidia 8600 GTS Video Card. I bought a better video card this March. A Sapphire Radeon 3850 HD, and in August, upgraded the CPU to a Quad core Q6600. Other than those upgrades, its pretty much the same. Still using XP Pro for my Operating System. Tried Vista, hated it, went back to XP.

It has never been contaminated with Microsoft software, but has run several variations and iterations of Linux. It is not ready for retirement yet.

I have finally upgraded the memory recently from it's wimpy 256mb by adding another 1Gb. The 80Gb hard disk is original. The only other mods have been adding a 128 Mb AGP card, and replacing the power supply 3 years ago. Between my son and myself, we run the machine between 5 and 10 hours a day, 355 days a year.

I do a lot of photography and work with old photos, especially old aerial photos, which tend to be pretty big (some get up to 250-260MB or larger). When I start manipulating them, the extract files can grow even more. So I decided that I wanted a graphics workstation like the pros used to do their work, and I've been very happy with the decision. It works well, does a nice job and is pretty fast. The only downside is the 64-bit O/S. Sometimes finding things that work with it can be hard, but, so far, I've always managed.

When I replace the MB I consider it to be a new PC even though some of the old stuff stays. This is my fourth. I'm running Vista Home Premium SP1 on an AMD Athlon Dual Core 4400 2.3, 2 gigs of DDR2 PC2-5300/667, 500 Gig Hard Drive, DVD+-RW Disc Drive/Burner, 450 Watt Power Supply, SB Audigy, ATI 2600 Pro PCIe, Altec Lansing 2.1 Speakers (these are 3 PCs old - still sound great), 22 inch WS/HD LCD Monitor, APC UPS, Cordless Mouse, and a Cheapo Keyboard. I'm no gamer but I like media. I tend to buy middle of the line competitivly priced stuff. I've ordered an AMD Dual Core 6000+ 3.0, two more gigs of RAM, and a 64 bit upgrade to Vista. This will lead to a better sound card, more powerful video card, and so on. I've no problem with Intel processors except price.

Cost about 900 dollars four years ago, incuding a nice TFT, from high street chainstore. Windows XP home. 80 gig disk. Less trouble than anything else I use (and I'm not smart technically) but gets glitchy for a while after anyone else uses it. I have always found this to be so with shared pcs. Paranormal interaction?! Dodgy web visits?? At first, with 150 meg of ram, the thing didn't cope with photos, but an upgrade to 750 which I did myself made a huge difference. I don't do gaming or massive video - would rather read a book! My music-loving son says my next computer should be a Mac. They look friendly. Why not? Howard, Devon UK.

It was supposed to be the fastest computer I could buy! It runs on Vista. It crashes constantly, is slow, freezes, and does not want to start. Makes noise, and is now battered from being sent to gateway 3 times for repairs. They admit &quot;they did nothing but send it back to me&quot;. When I pointed out the memory was supposed to be 500 gigabytes, adn duo quad processers, they simply removed the stickers proclaimig the facts from the computer. They deny it is even possible to be a gateway. nepal, etc. Hummmmmmmmmmmmm, it has a cow spot box, the computer has gasteway imbedded in the design. I have an advertiement from the gateway website advertising it at Best Buy, Fries and two other stores. I have the Best Buy advertisemtn, the receipt too! The corporate office sneered at me, hung up several times. They say when I signed the warranty, I gave up all rights to sue. I have the warranty, instructions, all say Gateway on them. They openly said they will never fix it........ I say the h____ with them!!! I have a Toshibas laptop that bounced all over including India, Tibet, Nepal, Cambodia, nepal. It works still!!!! If the old computer works, maybe it is the best to keep. I have to use it anyway, since I have the Gateway Lemon of the year. I would love to expose them, and sue their butts!!!!!! I now HATE Gateway!!!!

I find that having two built in hard drives very handy in keeping data on one drive and the op system on the other (especialy with respect to unstable Vista in the first week - had to reinstall it completely). Installed an all in one media card reader (dirt cheap) and also added the Linksys N series wireless adapter - very fast wireless broadband connection which makes the G look like a snail. Trouble is I will now have to upgrade all the other wireless adaptors on other PCs I have to the N !! Cheers, Graeme.
