My main PC's video card has a lot of resolution options and I was able to find one that worked. My other PC's video card did not have the proper resolution and the screen was stretched. A wide screen monitor will need something like 1440 X 900 resolution (wide screen). If your video card does not have this available, you'll get a stretched picture.

I've been suffering with elongated images since I &quot;inherited&quot; an HPw19 from my son. (It came with his new computer. He couldn't stand the stretched image, so kept his old standard aspect ratio 19&quot; monitor when he sold me his old computer.) I switched to 1440x900, as you suggested, and now I have incredibly sharp, standard ration windows inside my 16:9 display. Beautiful. Should I tell my son? Thanks again, Ron
