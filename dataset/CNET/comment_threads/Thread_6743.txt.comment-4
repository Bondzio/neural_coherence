I just want to get it going for cheap.
I plan on getting a laptop.
The processor is fast enough to do what I want it to do: some graphic but mainly music and movies.
With the existing computer I have, what would be the best video card I can put in for cheap that gets me max resolution (1920 x 1200 / 60 Hz)?
