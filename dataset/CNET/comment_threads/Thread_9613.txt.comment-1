I have netgear wireless router.
I want to host one web application on my system which is having internal IP as 198.162.*.
* and my external IP is static IP address.
I have installed a web application (using websphere app server) Using my external IP adress as host name is not working.
I can access my pages from my machine using host name as localhost or my internal IP address.
What can I do to access my website from outside?
