1.1.1	Hello guys, sorry if this has been asked before or if this is in the wrong forum, but I figure I'll at least be pointed in the right direction.	St
1.1.2	My computer has an 80 gig hardrive in it, partitioned into 62.5 and 17.5 gigs worth of unallocated space (the result of getting rid of a linux partition).	St
1.1.3	Now I'd like to be able to use that 17.5 gigs to store files on, but I don't want to pay for Partition Magic or any other similar programs.	St
1.1.4	Are there any working free methods out there, and should I format it to FAT or NTFS?	St
1.2.1	Boot with that in and go through the steps to format that partition.	St
1.2.2	Of course, a reformat and install would return it to 1 partition.	St
1.2.3	But you would need to back up everything to another source that you didn't want to lose.	St
1.2.4	And make sure you have ALL drivers needed.	Sug
1.2.5	chuck	St
1.3.1	Thanks, but that's another thing I'd like to avoid (having to back everything up and etc...)	St
