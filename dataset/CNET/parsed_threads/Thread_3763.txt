<s> Eight years ago this month my house burned to the ground ,I was told by the fire investagator that the most likely cause of the fire was my computer. </s>
<s> He said that the hard drive overheated and started the fire because I left it turned on. </s>
<s> The reason it was turned on that night was because we had just hooked our answering machine up to the phone line to the computer and did not want to turn it off and miss any messages. </s>
<s> Now I have no machine hooked up with this computer and always turn it off even if I just leave the house and always at bedtime. </s>

<s> If you have a business outside your home and require 24 hour running of a computer..... fine...the building probably has a sprinkler system. </s>
<s> But this crud about wearing out this or that premature because of off every night and on the next day may be true over a 20 year span and it would probably be the on/off switch itself. </s>
<s> Besides an air conditioner, automatic heater, clocks, detectors, and burglars alarm, what sane person leaves something else running in their home while they are asleep or not at home. </s>
<s> Computer sleep modes are not reliably safe enough IMO. </s>
<s> One of my desktops is 6 years old and goes off/on each day without anything wearing out or any problems because of it. </s>
