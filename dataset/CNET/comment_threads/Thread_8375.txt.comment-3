Hey thanks a lot for responding!
;-D My BIOS is American Megatrends Inc 0810, 11/2/2007.
I havent contacted Kingston yet.
The pack was a Christmas present from my sister and brother, so if I have to I can get the purchasing info from one of them.
I just checked the QVL list for the p5k3 ( didnt know what that was till you mentioned it, so thanks) There are 2 Kingston models on the list......one of them matches my RAMs model number up to the last 4 digits.
KVR1333D3N8/1G &lt;-------- thiers KVR1333D3K2/4GR &lt;-------- mine Is that good or bad?
Thanks again!
