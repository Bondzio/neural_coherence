The problem I'm having is that when I turn on the monitor it takes about 5 minutes to come on to the desktop. It shows a black screen with a faint Gateway word and logo then it will finally come on. I do not have the monitor driver loaded because when I did that the picture was all full of lines even with the VISTA updated monitor driver from gateway. So I went back to the generic monitor driver in VISTA. I have all the power saving options turned off. I do not have the monitor software installed as it has problems with VISTA. It also had the same problem with my other video card. Is there a setting within the monitor itself that would keep it from coming on? I noticed that the same thing happens with the same monitor in the store displays. The salespeople don't have a clue. Thanks for any and all help.

The time in *now* to return it as store policies are far more friendlier within 15days or less. I'm sure you touched on all the issues that effect the setup, but Nvidia have been a sore issue with Vista. OEM's are waiting still for such, plus if the monitor is not stated as Vista capable it too can fall through the cracks until a later time its 100% fixed or accepted in the fold, let them fix it. tada -----Willy

See the forum posting description below for the exact symptom. I had to unplug the power cord as mentioned in another forum answer to &quot;reset&quot; the monitor (the monitor menu's reset option has no effect). This same thing also happened to a personal friend of mine who bought the same FPD2275W monitor around 9 months ago from Circuit City. Just thought you should know. Maybe there is a firmware update from the manufacturer to permanently fix this? The monitor is always plugged in and even when you &quot;turn it off&quot; with the button or by Vista &quot;power plan&quot; options, the power button is lit purple (the off color) so it still has external power applied to it. Just surprised this happened after one week! I didn't install the Vista EzTune software yet because of reported issues with Nvidia 8800 cards. My friend has EzTune installed on his XP system and the same freeze happens so that can't be the cause. Its something with the monitor hardware onboard processor itself.

Then it shows the desktop but the little blue window that shows it's connected via DVI is on the screen for another 30 seconds. So it takes a good minute and a half to actually see the desktop. It's almost like it freezes for a minute and a half. Anybody else have this problem or heard of it and know how to fix it?&quot; Answer (by another user): Try unplugging the power then plugging it back in ... this should reset the monitor.
