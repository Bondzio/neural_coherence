My Linksys WRT350N has a USB-2 port.
I plug my external USB-2 &quot;stuff&quot; drive into it and it becomes a network drive.
It is seen by all my PCs (4, one wireless laptop) and is exactly what you're looking for.
Drives?
I'm partial to Seagate.
I have an 80 Gig unit in the USB case, it's perpendicular recording is fast.
I just purchased this 160 Gig http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822148212 as I'm running out of space on the 80.
Seagate has many choices here http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=50001305+40000014&Manufactory=1305&SubCategory=14&SpeTabStoreType=0 up to a TeraByte.
