that's why i am asking here.
the key to this question is the size of the paper (a1/4bar/3 1/2&quot;x4 7/8&quot;) and the thickness of 80# or 216gsm.
i have been on the phone/online chat with hp, xerox and dell and seems most of the people answering the phones cannot understand what 3.5&quot; wide means, let alone 4 7/8&quot; in height.
does anyone know of a laser printer that can print on an a1 flat card (3 1/2&quot; x 4 7/8&quot;) size piece of coverstock (80 lbs or 216 gsm).
thanks!
