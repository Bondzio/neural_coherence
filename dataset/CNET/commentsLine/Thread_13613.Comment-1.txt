greetings.
i was hoping someone could assist me.
i have a maxtor onetouch ii drive i have used for the past year.
for some reason when i've tried to access it (via my computer and multiple other computers) i cannot find my files.
i never manually deleted them, so i'm confused as to where they went.
when i plug in the usb to a computer, the drive is recognized.
but it dopes not show any of the files.
when i click on &quot;properties&quot; it lists a capacity of only 87 gb instead of the full 300+ gb.
this harddrive is my primary backup and the contents are desperately needed for my business.
i've spoken with maxtor and recieved little help.
when i use the windows disk management function it tells me that there are 87 gb available and 192 gb &quot;unallocated&quot;.
i've seen through a generic recovery program that there are files there (although i can only see extentions and not any actual file names).
so it appears that the 192 gb are the files i am looking for.
my question then is: how do i access/recover these files that are showing up as &quot;unallocated&quot;?
any ideas, data status theories, or places to outsource the recovery to?
thanks, matt
