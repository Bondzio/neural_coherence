okay i have it to where i have my bigger lg in front of me hooked up to my alienware via hdmi, and my smaller sony hooked up via hdmi to the left of me.
i can't seem to make it to where when i play a game like ac3 for example i can minimize the game, open firefox through my sony (smaller to my right) and keep firefox up and then maximize ac3 on my lg.
how can i do this?
i know theres gotta be a way.
