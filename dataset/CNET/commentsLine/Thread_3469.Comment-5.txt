thanks steven, i tried re-installing the drivers using device manager, but the wizard said that ''xp cannot find better drivers for your device''.
the other thing is that although this is a 6port usb hub, when i check the device manager for installed hardware and click usb, it shows the ports, but it just lists one as an ''enhanced pci to usb host controler'' does this means the pc is only recognizing one of the the 6 hubs as a 2.0, or is that the way that they usually show up on the device manager.
i tried to paste a snapshot here, but i couldn't figure it out.
i had it as a paint file!
ps b_derf, this is a new usb card.
i got it about 3 months ago.
