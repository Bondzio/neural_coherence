Does not fit in this small space.
I see you added a lot of details but what I see is the usual run of the mill Quad Core PC.
These can play games with a good video card but the usual issue is the power supply.
Did you make sure it will support your card?
And no software will check or report this for you.
The list looks like one of those HP or Dell machines.
If it is, why didn't you write &quot;I have a HP d4999t&quot;?
