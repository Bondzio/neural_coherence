<s> I am running 3 laptops on my home network (MS router and MS adapters). </s>
<s> Only my HP Omnibook 1600 which had at first Windows2000 ( problem started there) and now WinXP Professional 'disconnects' after some time 'automatically' from the Internet..the other 2 laptops don't. </s>
<s> When I restart my HP Omnibook I am then also reconnected to the Internet. </s>
<s> The signal on this laptop, just 20 feet away from the router, is mostly 'low',whereas the third and older laptop, also HP and situated at almost the same distance, displays a strong signal. </s>
<s> HP blames Microsoft for the error and Microsoft blames HP! </s>
<s> The laptop in question has just been equipped with a new harddisk ( no change!). </s>
<s> Any idea? </s>
<s> or possibly a 'kink' in your cable connection from it to the router? </s>
<s> Or is this a wireless setup? </s>
<s> As for the automatic disconnects, that's a setting that needs to be unchecked for 'disconnect if connection may not be needed anymore'....and it may be in your Dial Up Networking icon if you have one, or your 'disconnect if idle for more than x minutes' box is checked, or in your modem settings. </s>
<s> Since you didn't say how you connect to the net, it's hard to tell you where you have these settings until we know your setup. </s>
