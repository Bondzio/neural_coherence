1.5.4	I love the HDMI interface of my MacBook , even the video processor is not so powerful to fill the entire screen I do watch some internet tv on it , and sometimes use it as my wide screen monitor , and its really better than watching naything on the small screen .	St
1.5.5	I asume you are the only person watching on your mac , becasue if you have more people to share your experience with , unless you have a 20-24 inches iMac I think it could not be too comfortable to watch directly .	St
