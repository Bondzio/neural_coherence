<s> Hi, what would be a good spec for downloading music and using the internet a lot, but not playing games? </s>
<s> Anything that is internet capable is the short answer. </s>
<s> There are not that many web sites available for downloading legal copies of music tracks, I can think of two, Spotify and iTunes to begin with, and we can't discuss any illegal options. </s>
<s> But that makes no difference to what you use. </s>
<s> Tablet, Notebook, Laptop, Desktop, Mac, Windows, Linux, iPad, even iPhone and other smart phones will do it. </s>
<s> With such broad requirements your options are huge. </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> I would like something reliable and that lasts, preferrably longer than 3 years. </s>
<s> My first PC from Evesham lasted 5-6 years, but the one i bought from Novatech only lasted 3 yrs when i paid about &#163;500 for it. </s>
<s> I want something more reliable than that and prefer to spend a little more to get something that works well. </s>
<s> I would like the internet to run reasonbly fast aswell, i don't like waiting </s>
<s> I guess my budget is around &#163;400. </s>
<s> The novatech one actually lasted 4 years. </s>
<s> Id like something that will last 4 years without becoming slow in the last year. </s>
<s> Also, where is the edit button? </s>
<s> It always runs at the same speed as new. </s>
<s> Compared to new machines it would seem slow. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ok, thnx. </s>
<s> Is there any websites you would recommend for buying computers(already built)? </s>
<s> If you look at the top 100 at http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/pc/ref=pd_dp_ts_pc_1 you notice a lack of any desktop PC making the list. </s>
<s> Folk are not buying many today. </s>
<s> Why not a laptop? </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> Yes there are plenty of desktops out there. </s>
<s> I can't pick one for you from the some thousand models but almost any should be fine given no gaming, etc. </s>

<s> Which is best? </s>
<s> I don't need a laptop, i have one from work and they overheat and are more expensive. </s>
<s> I want something reliable and fast as im impatient and short of time(i dont wanna wait 5 mins for a website to load). </s>
<s> Is Zoostorm better than HP? </s>
<s> Is AMD as good as Intel? </s>
<s> Will all these have slots for putting in another internal harddrive to get my data off it? </s>
<s> I can't predict which will be trouble free for years but here I'd get the Intel CPU units first on my list. </s>
<s> Why is simply because at the office and home we use Visual Studio a lot and it may upset AMD fans that we had better performance on those. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> They are coming out of the silly ward to give you thumbs down. </s>
<s> lol </s>
<s> &quot;Military Intel.&quot; </s>
<s> Are graphics cards used for anything other than games? </s>
<s> I mean, if i go for the one with the lower end graphics card, is it going to affect anything like movies/internet ect..? </s>
<s> Appreciate the help. </s>
<s> Oh also, each post window seems to get smaller and smaller, if a thread gets enough replys, do the last posts in the thread become unreadable? </s>
<s> But for now, the current non-dedicated RAM GPU systems (often called onboard graphics) play HD fine. </s>
<s> And so far I see no change in Internet speed. </s>
<s> As to forum oddities, yes they are there. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> iv decided to get a laptop instead, but not sure which one yet. </s>
<s> I note the laptop pickers but look again at http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/pc/ref=pd_dp_ts_pc_1 Maybe the first or second laptop isn't a bad idea or starting point? </s>
