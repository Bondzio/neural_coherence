You should create your own router password and encryption keys.
Don't use any defaults as these are as good as public knowledge to those who want to access the device.
So, don't leave any of them as is.
You can generally create what's called a &quot;passphrase&quot; which will convert to a numeric key.
The passphrase can be some short bit of text you can remember easier than a long string of numbers.
