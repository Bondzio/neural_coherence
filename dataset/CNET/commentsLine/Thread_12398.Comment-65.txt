hello!
more insight to my 2nd side flaking problem - it happens only when there is a photo on one side of the page, and only the photo area flakes.
back-to-back text comes out just fine.
i too have noticed the jamming after printing lots of pages of the stardream cardstock (from the manual feed tray though).
in my case, the printer picks up several (!!!)
pages at one time and they get stuck part way in.
my hunch is that it's the texture of the paper, combined with the power of the feeder r and the manual feed tray pushing itself a little higher as the stack of paper goes down.
i also notice it more on some paper colors than others.
another question - getting light shades of yellow seems tricky, as there's always other colors printing with the yellow, even with 100% y value in my artwork.
i tried going the rgb route, but it di d not change the output.
