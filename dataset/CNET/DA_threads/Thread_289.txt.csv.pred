1.1.5	When I click on the network name it says that network is inaccessible ... ...	St
1.1.6	I have disabled all the firewalls .	St
1.1.7	In fact , when I started trying to set this up the laptop did n't have any virus scan at the time .	St

1.2.1	Presumably you are fighting your way through XP 's Add A Network Place enigma .	St
1.2.2	Sometimes it works instantly even without the complete computer name , sometimes it just refuses to work unless everything is just so .	St
1.2.3	How Microsoft imagined that the average consumer could use this is beyond me .	St
1.2.4	I would suggest that you check that all firewalls are off ( especially if your have 3rd party ones ) .	St
1.2.5	Do n't attempt to set up wirelessly -- use ethernet cable between the computers until things are working .	St
1.2.6	Try running the Network Wizard on the new machine .	St
1.2.7	Other than that just stick at it and eventually it will work .	St
1.3.1	Did n't see any mention of this in your post , but have you checked that the laptop belongs to the same workgroup as your two desktops ?	Ques
1.3.2	( Right click My Computer & gt ; Properties & gt ; Computer Name tab )	St
1.4.1	Thanks for the help guys but I actually got it .	St
1.4.2	I had to install the NWLink IPXSPXNetBIOS Compatible Transport Protocol on the laptop .	St
1.4.3	As soon as I did that , they all found each other and they were all able to & quot ; talk & quot ; to each other .	St
1.4.4	Once I found that , it took me 10 seconds to fix it .	St
1.4.5	Pretty frustrating when it is something that simple and I was looking for the answer for a week , but at least it 's fixed and so far it seems to be working well .	St
1.4.6	Thanks again , Tracy	St
