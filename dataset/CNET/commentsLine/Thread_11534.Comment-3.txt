imovie 11 is capable of stabilizing a shaky picture on its own.
all the warning is saying is that any camera that uses the cmos image sensors often use a technology called a &quot;rolling shutter&quot; and that, if you use imovie 11 video stabilization when you are editing the raw footage, you will likely have a result that looks distorted.
a workaround is to either use a tripod while filming your event, which will give you a stable picture to begin with or do not use imovie 11's built in video stabilization feature.
