well took the plunge, ordered and hopefully should be here friday.
looked into the power supply some more and will need to upgrade to a power supply with a 6 pin pci express output.
looking at a 8800 GT 512mb and will need a little more juice on the 12V rails.
i can give a review to whoever is interested.
hoping this thing is a little better than my 7 year old P4.
hehe.
