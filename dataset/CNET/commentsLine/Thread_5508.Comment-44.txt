thanks, i learned that the hard way in this instance.
i guess i didnt know that because this wd external hard drive was the first one i have ever had or used, and it didnt come with any real instructions, warnings, tips etc in the packaging or from the place where i bought it.
i now have a samsung external hard drive which is twice the size and it was on sale for half the money i paid for the other one.
it also has warranty information and a place you can call for help.
in fact having read all these posts which have been informative and helpful by the way, i'm thinking of getting a second one, just to be on the 'safe side' from now on.
