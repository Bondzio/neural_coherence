hey matt, let me know how the install goes this weekend.
as for the ram its unlikely, but i figured it was worth a try.
heres a few quick questions to try and help you out further: what happens exactly, when the install stops?
does your system completely lock up?
if you can open task manager, does it show the program running, or as not responding?
have you clicked the installer in the task bar to make sure there is not a pop up dialog box asking for a response that did not show on screen?
i've seen that a couple of times, and when i click the task in the task bar, it minimizes the install, and when i click again the pop up displays.
it happened to me once when it was asking if i wanted to install punkbuster in the middle of the install.
looking forward to hearing back from you.
