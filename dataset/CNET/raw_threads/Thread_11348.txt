Typing is even delayed at some point. This just started yesterday morning. I've done a virus check and none have shown up. Does anyone know what could be happening? Thank you for your time.

Clean it -&gt; http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-11319_7-6240575-1.html 2. Drivers. No make, model so I can't be specific. 3. Malware.
