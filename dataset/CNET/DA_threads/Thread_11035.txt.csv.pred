1.1.1	Hey guys , I 'm in the market for a new sub- $ 400 monitor and the HDTV tuner ability interests me .	St
1.1.2	I 've been doing a lot of research and I keep hearing about the 27in P2770H and the 24in FX2490HD .	St
1.1.3	I know that the difference in screen size is significant , but should I still prioritize the FX2490HD due to being a backlit-LED monitor over the P2770H 's LCD panel ?	Ques
1.1.4	I always hear about the superiority of LED in producing more vibrant colors and contrast , but according to CNET 's tests , the P2770H showed higher brightness ( 267 vs. 239 ) , contrast ( 1003:1 vs. 983:1 ) , and DisplayMate score ( 94 vs. 93 ) .	St
1.1.5	Does that mean that the color and contrast of the P2770H is better than LED-backlit FX2490HD ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks in advance ...	St
1.2.1	I meant to say P2770HD above ...	St
