is it possible to have 1 wireless keyboard control 2 pcs at the same time?
say i type on the keyboard and the things i type come out as tect on both pcs.
if this is possible, how would i go about setting it up?
i would buy 2 wireless keyboards, and set up the 2 recievers, but is there a way to set them to the same frequency?
i have never owned a wireless keyboard so im not sure if this is possible or not.
