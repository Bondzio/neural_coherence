<s> I have a Poweredge 2300 with a 220 volt power supply. </s>
<s> Do I need to change the power supply to run in the US. </s>
<s> This server was made in Ireland. </s>
<s> Model:SMM Ser#:PGLLK </s>
<s> I could guess but won't. </s>
<s> Do look on the PSU for a 110/220 switch or the sticker that tells what the input range is. </s>
<s> In fact, it doesn't matter at all what the make is since the PSU is a common failing item on a lot of machines and the PSU may not be what was supplied from the manufacturer. </s>
<s> My answer is to look for the switch or label. </s>
