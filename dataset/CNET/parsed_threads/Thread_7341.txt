<s> Hi everyone. </s>
<s> I'm getting a little frustrated trying to choose a TV tuner card to put in my computer so I just wanted some advice and suggestions. </s>
<s> I'm not too concerned with watching HD on the pc, just regular TV is fine. </s>
<s> It'll probably be easier to list my questions in bullet format so here goes: - with the looming digital TV switch, what should I look for in a card? </s>
<s> - what is the difference between QAM and ATSC (the two digital formats)? </s>
<s> - my basic understanding of the digital switch is that the broadcast from a cable provider through the caox will be QAM. </s>
<s> If I get a QAM tuner, will I be able to just plug in my cable and watch all cable channels (besides premium and HD of course)? </s>
<s> - i recently saw something that said Windows MC doesn't support QAM, so will that keep me from using WMC for my purpose? </s>
<s> - please make suggestions as to what cards I should look at. </s>
<s> Again, all I want to do is install the card in my computer, plug in the cable from the wall, and watch TV. </s>
<s> I don't care about antennas or being able to watch over the air HD. </s>
<s> I have Cablevision for a cable provider. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any help! </s>
<s> &quot;all I want to do is install the card in my computer, plug in the cable from the wall, and watch TV&quot; Not a single card works like that. </s>
<s> Every one of them required drivers, player software and more. </s>
<s> Not a single unit would do what you asked. </s>
<s> So right there you have found NOTHING ON THE MARKER will do what you asked. </s>
<s> The second problem is that some cableco's are going digital so only they can tell you if it would work. </s>
<s> Hint? </s>
<s> CABLE CARD! </s>
