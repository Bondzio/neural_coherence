dedicated graphics card, any model, be it lower or higher end, offer major improvements over integrated.
just buy a new graphics card.
look into ur bios, some integrated graphics let u adjust the memory for it, so try that.
adding main memory (does this help)?
- any amount will speed up ur pc, but it depends on the amount set available to ur integrated graphics.
i hear that using all the memory slots is more bandwidth efficient than one stick in one slot, byte or byte (is that true)?
- ?
reallocating dedicated memory?
- see above is there a way to overclock the chipset?
- why would you do that to integrated graphics?
thats pointless.
