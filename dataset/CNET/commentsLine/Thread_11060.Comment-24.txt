the only device giving some headache when i changed system to windows 7 64 bit was a canoscan d646u ex scanner but it operates normally in the virtual xp mode, which can be downloaded from microsoft, assuming your processor supports the virtual technology.
it seems that canon isn't overall very fond of making new drivers for old devices.
my friend had a mulifunction printer and canon has no windows 7 drivers for it.
32 bit vista drivers exist but these won't work in 64 bit machine, otherwise it would be worth a try.
but my opinion is still that 64 bit is the way to go.
on my second machine based on a intel q8200 quad core processor, 4 gb ram i had xp before changing to win 7 64 bit.
it became a totally different machine, faster, smoother and very joyable.
