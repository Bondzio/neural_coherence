ok. i've just installed a new stick of 256mb DDR RAM.
i already had 256mb already installed that was fine.
When i turned on the comp after putting the new stick in i went to start &gt; control pannel &gt; system and saw that the new stick of RAM was not recongized.
it still only said 256mb of ram.
The system i'm running is: AMD 2400+ athlon xp 256mb RAM ASUS K7S8X mother board etc can anyone help me on how to get it to work?
