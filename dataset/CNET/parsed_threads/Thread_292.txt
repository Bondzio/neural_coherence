<s> Having trouble setting up a peer to peer network for two laptops over a switch. </s>
<s> Neither machine seems to have any net functionality. </s>
<s> I've assigned both a static IP (192.168.0.5/6) but to no avail. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> No words about accounts, firewalls, shares, drivers, wiring and more. </s>
<s> With just what you provided, &quot;not much&quot; should happen. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> I don't duplicate web content on Windows networking so if you need a tutorial just ask. </s>
<s> Sorry, No accounts, no firewall, both Hard Drives are entirely shared (this is because there is no outside access to these laptops) The configuration is as follow 2 Panasonic CF-29's (yea, the old toughbooks) I have both wired via Cat-5 to a Allied Telesyn AT-F716L 10Base-t/100Base-TX Fast Ethernet switch (16 ports) The Ethernet Adaptor is a Realtek RTL8139/810X Family Fast Ethernet NIC I believe the problem here is the OS. </s>
<s> I can't seem to get the computer to see a network. </s>
<s> In fact, I can't even ping on the Dos prompt. </s>
<s> I think you found the issue. </s>
<s> As to ping you'll have to fix that too. </s>
