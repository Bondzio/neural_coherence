I bought a new stick of RAM that isn't working and I've narrowed down the problem to an out-of-date BIOS. When booting up with the new RAM I get the error message: Failure initialising CONFIGMG: Windows protection error. You must restart your computer. 850Mhz Duron 256 MB RAM (existing) Gigabyte GA-7IXE4 Windows 98SE I'd be glad to hear any ideas. Thanks Adam

Which means go to your mobo site and read how to flash their bios. Get their flash util. Get the proper bios file. Go back and reread how to flash their bios. Then it's just. step 1 step 2 step 3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and your done. If the flash does not go well &quot;DO NOT&quot; shutdown your machine, while it's still alive you may be able to recover. And then there's the on-line flash. Have no idea.
