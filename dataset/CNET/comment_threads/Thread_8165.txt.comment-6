as ramark explained, it incorporates a digital tuner.
A set top box is basicly a digital tuner in a big box with it's own power supply, with connections for an aerial and tv.
Any digital tuner can be used to watch or record gigital tv on a pc, even a usb tuner, the size not much bigger than a cigarette lighter.
The WinTV-HVR-2250 is one of the best, but there are other good tuners around if you want something cheaper.
