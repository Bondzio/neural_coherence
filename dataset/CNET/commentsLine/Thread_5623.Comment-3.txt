thanks bob, while i too have never seen a hard drive hooked up, i have heard of people hooking flash drives up, and that would be the same concept.
the reason i would like to avoid an ipod is just because of the fact that you can get so much more storage for a great deal less of money, and if i can make it work i would like to.
