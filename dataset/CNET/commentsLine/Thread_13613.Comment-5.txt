i know what your talking about, i have had my external hard drive die on me twice, but both times i have been saved by runtime get data back (click &lt;a href=&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; here &lt;/a&gt; for there faq)as long as you haven't put anything new on the drive it should find the lost files fine, it even works if you have formatted the hard drive.
you can download the trial version from there &lt;a href=&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; site &lt;/a&gt; , however you cannot save the files the trial version finds, as far as i know you can view them.
there are two different versions, for fat and ntfs.
you obviously want the one for your hard drives file system.
