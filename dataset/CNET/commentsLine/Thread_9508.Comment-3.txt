for giving me such an excellent answer.
however, i'd just like to say that with all respect, i don't ever upgrade my computer or find the need to.. when it comes to computers, i pay once and use the device for like 2 to 3 years before buying a brand new one.
i actually use pc at my office when i work and like you said, it does run those editing softwares and programs but i am not so much satisfied with its performance.. i can easily tell that it's struggling to run it as smoothly as possible and it's quite annoying when it glitches once in a while.. i get that pc gives you a lot of options and it's excellent for gaming but like i mentioned, i'm looking for computer with better media performance and i think staying with mac would be best.
if there is any more opinions on this that i should know about, please feel free to reply
