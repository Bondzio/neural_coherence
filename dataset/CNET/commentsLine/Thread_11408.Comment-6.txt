if this is just to keep others off your wifi why not just wpa or wpa2?
there is no crack worth noting here that doesn't take an armada of machines to break into.
one has to declare a goal.
ours was simple.
security that was strong enough and we could expect to work for a month at a time (when we change wifi wpa passwords.)
