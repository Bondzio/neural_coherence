<s> My system is a Dell Dimension 8300 running Windows XP. </s>
<s> My D drive is a Pioneer DVR-1910LS. </s>
<s> It has operated well until today when it refused to write to either CD or DVD. </s>
<s> My system refers to the drive as a DVD-ROM. </s>
<s> Software on my system insists that I have no burner attached. </s>
<s> Rebooting and restarting did not help. </s>
<s> I have uninstalled and reinstalled the drive without effect. </s>
<s> Curiously, the Lightscribe burner works well. </s>
<s> XP knows nothing about DVD recorders. </s>
<s> But you write it worked before. </s>
<s> This means there was some added software to add this feature. </s>
<s> No name given or title but what to try next is uninstall then reinstall that software title. </s>
<s> I read where you uninstalled and reinstalled the drive. </s>
<s> That's not software so I don't expect that to work. </s>
<s> The SOFTWARE is what I'd be working on. </s>
