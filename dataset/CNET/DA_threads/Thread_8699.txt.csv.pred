1.1.1	Hi, my desktop speakers produce a background scratch/static when the my computer is processing(?)	St
1.1.2	and even more noticeably when I drag the mouse pointer.	St
1.1.3	I have replaced the speakers so I know that is not the problem.	St
1.1.4	My sound source is on-board.	St
1.1.5	I bought a new sound card but could not find an available slot to install it.	St
1.1.6	Help?&lt;div style=&quot;overflow: hidden; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;	St
1.2.1	You're right to look for an alternate sound card.	St
1.2.2	The noise is caused by other circuitry in the pc interfering with the sensitive parts of the audio electronics.	St
1.2.3	So I guess you should have looked for a free slot before buying a card.	St
1.2.4	Can't you take it back to the store and change it for a USB one ?	Ques
1.3.1	Hello, thanks for the feedback.	Polite
1.3.2	I suppose I could have been more specific.	St
1.3.3	There was an available slot, but the sound card was too large(?).	St
1.3.4	Regardless...I did take it back and bought a USB sound card ( an item that previously i did not know existed).	St
1.3.5	A prior response helped me to find it.	St
1.3.6	Great sound now.	St
