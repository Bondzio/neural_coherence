1.1.1	Hi !	St
1.1.2	I have troubles about establishing internet connection in Linux because the system does n't recognise my modem .	St
1.1.3	So I 'm searching for a CNet SoftV92 Data Fax Modem linux driver but I can not find it anywhere .	St
1.1.4	Can anyone help me ?	Ques
1.1.5	: /	St
1.2.1	They require Windows as the Operating System to perform the modem functions that a full processor modem 's on board processor does .	St
1.2.2	That is why they are so inexpensive .	St
1.2.3	The full processor modems usually cost more than $ 50 , the USR is about $ 68 at newegg .	St
1.3.1	While we 're a friendly bunch , you may have thought CNET had something to do with your modem .	St
