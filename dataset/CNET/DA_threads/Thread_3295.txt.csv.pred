1.3.1	Thanks , I saw that thread while I was trouble shooting before my post , I tried it , but Vista wo n't recognize the driver so ca n't install it as a local printer , so I click install on the driver installation itself , when installing , it asks me for the printer connection type , I click network printer ( Peer To Peer ) , it then ask for the printer server name and shared name ( the Printer is shared in the XP Desktop ) , once I fill in the data it searches for it , finds it and then installs it , after installation , it becomes the default printer on Vista , Vista can access the Printer properties , even says it status is ready but when ever I try to print a test page it wo n't print , it gives this error & quot ; Communication Not Available & quot ; After installation Vista status says Printer Ready , but the Lexmark Notification Icon in the Vista taskbar say not connected .	St
1.3.2	I have tried the Vista drivers downloaded from Lexmark , still the same problem	St
