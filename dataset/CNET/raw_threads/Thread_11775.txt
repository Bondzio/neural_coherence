Now suddenly I cant turn the machine on, every time I press the power on button, I hear a bleep sound and the monitor stays blank. I cant even enter the machine to format it... what should I do to make a simple format? maybe it is a hardware issue regards, Mirza

Now check in the motherboard manual what this particular combination of beeps (for example: 1 short one, 2 long ones) means. The usuals: - bad RAM - bad CPU - bad motherboard Yes, it's surely hardware. Formatting doesn't make any sense. Kees

Why not try memtest86 (free download) first? Anyway, you're unlikely to get any effective help if you don't tell more about the issue than that it has a &quot;strange reason&quot;. Kees
