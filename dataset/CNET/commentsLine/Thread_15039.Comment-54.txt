i wish i had check this site before following a suggestion.
a mistake.
told to drag icon of back up to trash.
now i can get it back.
i was using a lacie 599,11gb.
now when i drag the hd to restore from utilities it moves to source, but the lacie will not move to destination.
a new image &quot; untitled&quot; appears.
it will move to destination.
restore to untitled runs about a minute and no longer.
it quits.
i am tired of this flustration.
where would i get a drive you referenced?
i have a imac w/ os 10.6.8 processor 2.4 ghz intel core 2 duo and memory 3gb 667 mhz ddr2 sdram clyde at frclyde@comcast.net
