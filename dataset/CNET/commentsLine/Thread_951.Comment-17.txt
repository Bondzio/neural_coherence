160 gb hard drive - go ntfs - better mft allocation, easier on defrag, less flake factor on the drive.
can partition for ntfs and fat32, just watch out for ntfs encryption if swapping back to fat32 - you lose those files.
linux can handle both types.
in short, ntfs avoids a lot of problems inherent with fat32 - to quote someone else, &quot;i haven't looked back&quot; either.
