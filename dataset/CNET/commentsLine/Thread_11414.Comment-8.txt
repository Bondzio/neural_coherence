that's where the wear leveling gets tested.
even with discount after discount i can only get it down to 5.4 years even with the rogue data recorder scenario.
what's more likely to fail is something else.
for example your common flex cables also have a limited mtbf and that was in one rare case listed at 5 years.
pretty scary as those were used in hdtv sets.
here's my bet.
something else will fail before the actual flash components.
