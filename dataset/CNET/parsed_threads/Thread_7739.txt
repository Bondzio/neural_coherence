<s> I recently changed monitors from a bigger screen to a smaller (the smaller one looks nicer). </s>
<s> I had to take lots of time to size it up my screen to look nice. </s>
<s> the problem is when i play battlefield vietnam, it doesnt have 1280 x 1024 resolution meaning i play with two big black bars across the sides of my monitor. </s>
<s> I dont want to make my screen fit and get rid of the black bars because when i exit out of my game my desktop resolution will make my screen all screwed up. </s>
<s> Is there anyway i can fix this problem. </s>
<s> I don't know what monitor you have. </s>
<s> For instance, an LCD would not do that, so I'm GUESSING you have a CRT. </s>
<s> My only GUESS is that you can try another REFRESH RATE setting for that game. </s>
<s> I will not know how to change that for that one game. </s>
<s> You may have to ask the game supplier. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ill try talking to the battlefield people. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
