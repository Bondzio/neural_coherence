<s> Hello every one From the past few weeks I've been facing this issue, My PC lags a lot when i open huge applications like Adobe Photoshop (or) Dreamweaver . </s>
<s> I Installed Speedfan and i came to know that my core's are reaching temp 50C when idle and when ever i open applications like photoshop/dreamweaver the core's temperature raises to 65-70C . </s>
<s> i am totally afraid what to do ? </s>
<s> any suggestions please P.S : My cabinet has two built in fans to pull out the heat . </s>
<s> but still i face the same issue . </s>
<s> Here is a link to the image taken from Speedfan http://img217.imageshack.us/my.php?image=core2duohn4.jpg System Information generated by CPUZ . </s>

<s> hi thanks for your response . </s>
<s> checked the cpu fan [heat sink] and cleaned it and i am happy to say that it decreased my temperature's for now . </s>
<s> but still my speedfan shows that my Cores are at 35 C when idle and when i am using applications like photoshop / dreamweaver it goes upto 45C . </s>
<s> is this thing related to heatsink ? </s>
<s> i heard from one of my friends that i need to re apply the thermal paste on heatsink . </s>
<s> is that true ? </s>
<s> one more issue is : is my system slowing down because of the HDD which i use is IDE and basically my motherboard supports sata :P . </s>
<s> what could be the reason guys . </s>
<s> thanks for your time </s>
<s> Heat problems could be related to thermal compound; to the HS Fan no longer making good contact with the CPU heat spreader or to insufficient case cooling/ventilation. </s>
<s> RE Lagging....have you checked your system for MALWARE or checked your STARTUP for unneeded programs ? </s>
<s> They can have a significant affect on your system performance. </s>
<s> Use something like MSCONFIG to see what's running at STARTUP... and you can disable all programs running at STARTUP or selected programs by unchecking boxes. </s>
<s> VAPCMD Cleaned the HeatSink , but still it lags . </s>
