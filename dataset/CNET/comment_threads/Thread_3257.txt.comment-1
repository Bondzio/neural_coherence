Since you have your SSD installed has it lived up to your expectations?
Does it do what you want or do you find it lacking or even more troublesome than a std.
HD?
Since, these have been out for some time and early problems resolved(I think) just are your thoughts on that?
I like to exclude any costs here, just your real PC experiences.
