i am assuming you are currently using the 15-pin blue d-sub for your monitor.
i have used both dvi and d-sub and have seen no differences.
i actually like d-sub better because you can make adjustments, like contrast, move the &quot;picture&quot; around.
dvi is set at whatever.
my call: no need to buy a new card.
