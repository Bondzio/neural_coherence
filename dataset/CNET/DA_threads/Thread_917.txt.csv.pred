1.1.1	I am currentlly putting together a computer with a quad core processor and want to be able to add two video cards and a physics accelerator so I expect the computer to get pretty hot.	St
1.1.2	I have looked at the Asus Arctic Square ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835101010&Tpk=asus%2barctic%2bsquare ) and the Zalman CNPS9700 Led Fan ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835118019 )and they both have good reviews.	St
1.1.3	I plan on having a case with clear sides and in the case there are a few blue LDS so I would prefer if it went with the style, looked nice, and wasn't out of place but it also has to be good at cooling the system because I would like the computer to be as QUIET as possible.	St
1.1.4	Any suggestions would be great!	St
1.1.5	Thanks, Chris	St
1.2.1	is the clear winner.	St
1.2.2	But before I'd buy....I'd see what some of the tech sites say.	St
1.2.3	I'm sure products reviews are referenced/linked on the mfgs site.	Sug
1.2.4	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Alright, that is great.	St
1.3.2	Thank you.	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	i don't have experience with the asus cooler, but i prefer coolers with side mounted fans that blow the hot air out the back of the pc rather than downward and back onto the mobo.	St
1.5.2	but if you don't have good airflow in the case, downward airflow is probably better.	St

1.6.1	Alright, this review has some great info on it and will come in very useful.	St
1.7.1	in two of my computers and they both worked great and looked pretty cool with the copper fins and blue LED.	St
1.7.2	It does help to have good air flow in the case though, specially with that many graphics cards.	St
