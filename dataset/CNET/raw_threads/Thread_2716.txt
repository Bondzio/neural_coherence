Recently atarted using a new usb flash drive (fingerprint) and ever since i've had problems with the packard drive. the packard drive is recognised by my pc and is assigned a drive letter - i only know this as it comes up in the safely remove hardware window. but it does not come up as a drive in 'my computer' any ideas? Austin.

Also, have tried other flash drives on the PC in the same usb ports and they all work too so it's something specific to the PB mp3 and the PC. Any ideas anyone?
