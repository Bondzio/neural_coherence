Laptops don't stand up to what durable is defined as.
Here's the dictionary.
&quot;able to withstand wear, pressure, or damage; hard-wearing.&quot; I would not subject today's laptops to pressure or damage.
If this is indeed a criteria you have to move to laptops such as the Panasonic Toughbooks.
Why not treat it gently?
