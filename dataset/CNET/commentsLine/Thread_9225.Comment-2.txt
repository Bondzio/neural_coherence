but i can't answer your question &quot;will it work?&quot; here's why.
i find most owners are unhappy about the state of affairs that windows is in.
that is, after a decade of xp look at the amount of work required for driver installations.
i can't predict if your os is in good enough shape to accept the driver cd without issue.
