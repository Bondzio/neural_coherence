<s> My school is being retarded and making all the students buy mac computers (ugh)I just bought my laptop last summer and don't feel like spending $1800 for A computer I hate and will only use in school. </s>
<s> They said i can't use windows but they never said I had to use an apple. </s>
<s> Is there an easy way I could install mac OS X leopard to my Vista PC, without losing any of my vista files, having to reinstall vista, or having any major problems with my pc? </s>
<s> thanks for any help </s>
<s> It's refreshing to see an Apple-hater here. </s>
<s> Somehow, we see more Windows-haters. </s>
<s> Both points of view, of course, are irrational. </s>
<s> And it's uncommon to see a school prescribing a Mac indeed, either the hardware or the software. </s>
<s> They might have good reasons for it, but as you don't write anything on that, I can't comment. </s>
<s> But I'm sure it can't be called 'retarded'. </s>
<s> Anyway, Apple doesn't allow install of it's OS on other hardware than its own. </s>
<s> And discussion on illegal hacking activities is explicitely forbidden by the forum policies. </s>
<s> So I'm locking this thread. </s>
