hp's tech support has got to be worse than nothing.
they're the only ones i've ever experienced who will tell you things that're 100% opposite from the truth.
e.g.
they told me you could plug a pci card into a pcie slot.
i've read bob proffitt's posts about how they were unable to fix a defective system after many months (i see he's posted about it in this thread), and seen other similar posts.
there've been numerous news reports about their financial problems and the management shake-ups they've had in recent years too.
