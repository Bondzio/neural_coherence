hi again all, the specs for the 8560 don't include heavier cover stocks.
i know that doesn't necessarily mean that it won't take it.
i do know that xerox is pretty picky about what stock they recommend.
being, if you put a too-heavy stock through, and it ruins anything inside your printer, it deffinetly will not be covered under any kind of warranty or maintenance plan.
you'll be buying new guts for your printer.
i recently emailed another invitation designer who i found on a blog.
she is using the 8560 with solid inks.
she said that she loved it, but after she described how she needed to calibrate it with every job, and other problems, i took it off my own list.
it sounded like a lot of hassle.
but she did use stardream regularly.
i emailed envelopments a few months ago, and they recommended the oki c5300 color laser and the epson r1800 color inkjet., and said they were currently using both (it sounded like they have been testing out several.
i did recently get samples from hp, and they looked beautiful, though none on heavy card stock.
yeah, we'll all be competitors, but hey, i would still hate for anyone to waste money!
