Now it wont even boot up. I replaced the power supply, no dice. Removed all components and still nothing. I thought it might be the BIOS battery, nope. Motherboard nope, well then it had to be the CPU, nope. Anyone help? When I press the power button the CPU fan moves a bit then stops. I removed the Motherboard from the case and tested it that way thinking the case may be shorting it somehow, nothing. Any ideas please help.
