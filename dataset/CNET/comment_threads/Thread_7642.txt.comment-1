I have been told that I can set up a wireless connection between my home TV and my PC (different parts of the house of course), thus enabling the Lady Wife to view projects which I have downloaded and can play thought the PC.
I could burn a DVD but this has not always proved possible, so this seems an answer.
Wot I need to know is what attachments I require to accomplish this task.
All info very gratefully received particularly if it impresses the Lady Wife!!!
