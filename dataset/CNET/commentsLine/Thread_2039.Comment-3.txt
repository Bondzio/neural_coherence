i'm not quite sure what you mean by type...one ide cable is the rounded one that came with the system, the other is one i removed from the dell system, regular flat ide cable.
i'm afraid i don't know what the jumper setting are either...can you point me where to go to check?
all drivers are current, i updated the bios only a few weeks ago to the newest release.
