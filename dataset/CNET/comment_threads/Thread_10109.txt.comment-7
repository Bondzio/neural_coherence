i know it's annoying but so what, spelling wrong is annoying and i spell alot of things wrong.
help the guy out and not just post &quot;dont type in caps or im not going to help you.&quot; anyway, upgrade your ram, your psu (antec ocz enermax) and then your graphics card.
i would go with the 6600 for bf2 and doom 3 as nvidia do better in both.
