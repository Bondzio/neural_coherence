i tried to plug everything into a us power strip then i plugged the strip cord into a radio shack converter.
i ended up hearing a buzzing sound through the computer speakers and then heard a &quot;pop&quot; sound before the circuit blew on the wall outlet.
do you think i damaged the computer?
i fear i may need a new power supply for the computer but how can i tell?
also, any recommendataions on where to get power cords/step down converters for the desktop in the uk?
thanks for your help.
