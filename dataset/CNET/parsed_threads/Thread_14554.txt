<s> My computer has been acting up on start ups and never quite make it to the window's login screen without several reboots on startup. </s>
<s> I replaced the power supply and the graphics card since the fan on both components were not spinning even though I had a successful start up. </s>
<s> However my startup problem still persists and comes and go. </s>
<s> Sometimes, while I am online, the system will just reboot as if a ghost in the machine is in control. </s>
<s> I've already tried formatting the HD and re-installing xp pro. </s>
<s> The system is clean of any other software. </s>
<s> Are there utilities out there that let's me test the memory, HD, graphics card, and other components? </s>
<s> Is the software free? </s>

<s> I think you misunderstand me. </s>
<s> My computer is not sluggish nor does it have a virus. </s>
<s> What I have is a hardware issue that I can't seem to pinpoint and I was wondering if there is a software out there that can assist with locating the hardware problem ( so that it can test the sound card, graphics card, memory, HD, CD Rom, Floppy, and anything else). </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> http://www.tufftest.com/ Try the free/lite version first just to get a feel for it. </s>
<s> The problem with these sorts of progs is that your not using the windows drivers, as long as you understand that then I suppose they are of some value. </s>
<s> Anyway the price is right so give it a test drive. </s>
<s> I went to their site and was so impressed I purchased the Pro version. </s>
<s> Sharpwitz, Geeks.com sells a diagnostic kit that traces the codes during POST for under $30. </s>
<s> This gadget installs on a PCI slot. </s>
<s> It comes with a booklet containing all the code definitions. </s>
<s> It's helped me a few times. </s>
<s> Between the two of them you should be able to isolate the problem. </s>
<s> Sorry for the misunderstanding. </s>
