i also posted this message in winxp forum in error as my os is me.
one reply sent me to microsoft site (for xp) which advises change dma transfer mode to pio mode (whatever that is).
another reply states had this problem after blaster worm infection.
could either of these be applicable?
i'm hesitant to change the drive and wind up with the same problem because of something in the system...
