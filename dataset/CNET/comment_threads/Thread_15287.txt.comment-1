My friend office have been setup using a WiFi for its network.
Using SSID password and WEP as security, plus A MAC Address filter.
Its works for all the employee... 8 of them, all using a laptop.
Hardware are, Linksys WRT54G, windows XP pro-sp2.
Problem is, the guess who bring their own laptop can not connect to the network and internet... unless someone type the SSID Password and inserting the Mac address manually in the router (but they don't have an IT guy...) Question is, How to give a guess an access to network/internet... (without changing the router configuration back and forth...) I thought of, having 2(TWO) Access Point, using different channel, but one of the AP is open (No security - but it will be turn ON/OFF as necessary) -- If this configuration is possible, can both AP (different channel) still share a file or printer?
-- Any Information or idea is appreciated Thank You
