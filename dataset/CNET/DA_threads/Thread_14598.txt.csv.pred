1.1.1	I am building a new system : I have 2 raptors 74gb 10rpm drive I want to stripe & 1 320 gb ide i would like to use for backup of the raid 0 is this possible if i partician the 320 ?	Ques
1.2.1	depending on your backup approach/software , a partition probably wo n't be necessary .	St
1.2.2	if you want your backup to be a bootable image of your C : drive , then you should create a partition equal to the size of the striped raptors .	Sug
1.2.3	otherwise , just partition the 320gb as you see fit for your usage .	St
1.2.4	note : the last 10 % of a drive is the slowest portion .	St
1.2.5	if you will be partitioning for backup , make your backup partition the last one on that drive since it does n't need top speed .	St
