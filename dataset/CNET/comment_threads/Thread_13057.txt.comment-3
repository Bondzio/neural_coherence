Recently I have been looking at http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813127225 Recamended(sp) by a friend.
I was just wondering, do you think I would be able to use this problem free?
Right now it looks like a great price for how much he was hyping it up and telling me how it would improve and benefit me so much.
65 bucks after a rebate so, my question, do you think it would work in my case?
Is it a smart buy?
