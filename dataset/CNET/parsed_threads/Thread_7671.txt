<s> I wouldn't expect you to have any problems with that cable. </s>
<s> The only HDMI cables I've ever had any problems with have been the free ones I got from Comcast. </s>
<s> Frys once had 6' HDMI cables on sale for $2 each, and I bought 6 of them. </s>
<s> Not one of them has given me any problems. </s>
<s> For $6 you aren't risking much to give it a shot. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> this cable will give me a better picture than my dvi cable is that true? </s>
<s> DVI and HDMI signals are identical and digital. </s>
<s> I've never seen any change. </s>

<s> than I won't waste the $6 </s>
<s> I know HDMI cables carry both sound and video and VGA (RGB) cables carry video only. </s>
<s> Do DVI cables carry sound as well as video? </s>
<s> Since the DVI connections I've seen come out of the graphics card, I'm inclined to doubt it. </s>
<s> I have a VGA cable right now and wonder if the HDMI would show a marked improvement...Digger </s>
<s> And I can't tell the difference. </s>
<s> But I bet someone could if they tried hard enough. </s>
<s> HDMI is however REQUIRED for some setups. </s>
<s> Such as BluRay playback. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I can't see a difference, unless someone posts some specs, for most I don't think there is. </s>
<s> Even, if you use VGA, I'm sure if you look closely see if an audio port is present as well, many have that too, just need the typical PC audio cable. </s>
<s> My setup has it and I connect my laptop VGA and audio to the TV. </s>
