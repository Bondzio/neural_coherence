No, not exactly.
We need a heavy duty type industrial printer, but to be able to print out on full 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; sheets that contain 6 labels per sheet.
Basically just a good laser printer that can handle labels so we don't have to worry about labels peeling off inside the machine.
B&W is fine as well, we don't need to print color.
