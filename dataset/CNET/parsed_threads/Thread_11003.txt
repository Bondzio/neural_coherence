<s> Well, I have run out of PCI-E slots trying to equip my desktop with ports to use all the legacy peripherals I have. </s>
<s> I'm forced to open the PC case to swap PCI cards whenever I want to use 1394 instead of serial. </s>
<s> What I need is a box (port replicator/replicator?) </s>
<s> that plugs into the PC (USB2 port?) </s>
<s> and offers a wide range of I/O ports like 1394, serial, parallel, USB2, SCSI etc... </s>
<s> It would be nice for this box to sit alongside my monitor where the ports are handy. </s>
<s> Is there anything like this out there? </s>
<s> I use the usb to serial devices from serialio.com And they work great since I can assign them to COM1, etc. </s>
