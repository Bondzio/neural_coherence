However, there are graphics and TV tuner combo cards, such as the ATI All-In-Wonder (AIW) line, which combine the two to save space and power. Personally I don't like ATI and had a bad experience with their AIW line, so I go with Nvidia's offerings, but the choice is yours. For your second question, yes, you can get two separate cards, one TV tuner and one graphics card, and use them together, provided you have the slots available. (PCI, AGP, and/or PCIe.) Each would have its own respective duties. Of course there's still the AIW, which can do both and is likely to be found cheaper than purchasing the two cards individually. Hope this helps, John

PCIe, in turn, is considered a step above AGP. Older systems may only have PCI slots, while newer ones will have either an AGP or PCI slot for a graphics card. As to turning off the integrated graphics, it depends on your system. Some will do it automatically, some require you to go into your system BIOS, and some cannot be disabled. It all depends on your computer, or more specifically, your BIOS and motherboard. For information about accessing your BIOS, click here . Hope this helps, John
