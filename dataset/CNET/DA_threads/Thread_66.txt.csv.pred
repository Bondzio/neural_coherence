1.1.1	Okay, so I know little about the inner workings of PC's, but I'd like to upgrade mine.	St
1.1.2	Basically all I want is to be able to play most games without slowdown and the like.	St
1.1.3	I currently have an eMachines E4028, and was wondering what sort of upgrades would be suitable.	St
1.1.4	I have tried looking at graphics cards, but I just get confused.	St
1.1.5	Someone has offered me an 'XFX PV-T34K-NAHG 5200 NVIDIA AGP' graphics card, but apparently I already have 128mb in onboard graphics?	St
1.1.6	Oh, and I am on a budget, being a student!	St
1.1.7	If anyone could help I'd seriously appreciate it.	Polite
1.1.8	Cheers, James	St
1.2.1	I didn't find it on the US emachine site.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	I'm in the UK.	St
1.4.1	I didn't actually realise this was a US site!	St
1.4.2	Is this a problem for me?	St
1.4.3	!	St
1.5.1	Open the case and tell me which slots are open and what type.	St
1.5.2	See this for pictures.	St
1.5.3	http://www.diamondmm.com/images/bustypedrwng.gif Bob	St
1.6.1	no graphics upgrade will be worth it compared to the built-in gma900 graphics.	St
1.6.2	a pci graphics card might be a little bit better but certainly won't handle games like fear, doom, call of duty, etc.	St
1.6.3	&quot;without slowdown&quot;.	St
1.7.1	If you can find it, the PCI version of the 256MB FX5700 is worth doing.	St
1.7.2	Many games will be &quot;ok.&quot; Bob	St
