i have an lcd tv, the usual connections.
hdmi, s-video, component, etc.. and i have on my pc a radeon x1900.
i can't seem to figure out what i need in order to connect my pc to my tv...there isn't a computer connection on the tv itself...at least nothing requiring a lot of pins...so, i'm not sure what i need for that card?
