<s> I have decided I would like an external HD to back up mainly my music and digital pictures on my main drive. </s>
<s> I really don't have anything else that important to back up or worry about. </s>
<s> If I buy a new external is it as simple as plugging in the USB and begin transferring files to that drive? </s>
<s> I just want it for storage only. </s>
<s> Also, I have noted that it would be best to unplug this new drive when not in use so it does not get a bug or corrupted is that good advise? </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> No write protect switch. </s>
<s> Any virulent virus/pest/trojan can delete such without anything stopping it. </s>
<s> If a spare copy is all you want, then this is fine, but never call it a backup. </s>
<s> Your pictures are likely better off on CDR. </s>

<s> When a USB storage device is present it is seen as yet another &quot;storage&quot; area or drive. </s>
<s> While you can unplug/plug on the fly its best to use the &quot;unmounting&quot; icon or feature of that product to handle that. </s>
<s> Yeah, the ext. </s>
<s> drive can be left unplugged before powering up system. </s>
<s> In effect it's simple to use but don't let that fool ya, treat it like any HD as if internal, handle with care. </s>
<s> Now buy whatever ext. </s>
<s> HD you like but please check whatever features seems to fit your likening. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> I have 2 120Gb USB2 externals and a 120Gb internal which I connect when I want to transfer large batches of files, a few Gb. </s>
<s> The externals are normally disconnected. </s>
<s> I connect only with the internet off and after I've run Trend Internet Security 2005, Adaware, Spybot and Giant ( MS's new acquisition ), all updated daily. </s>
<s> I have 3 backups for all the personal stuff, just to make sure I don't lose anything else ( big virus attack 2 years ago ). </s>
<s> After I connect the externals, I do another set of scans and I have never had any pests resident in the externals, or the sometimes connected internal either. </s>
<s> Looks like they prefer the straight line approach, the C drive. </s>
<s> Normally, I delete\quarantine anywhere from 10 to 80 malwares per day, depending on where I surf. </s>
<s> I go where I damn well please but have to spend up to a couple of hours occasionally to clean the PC. </s>
<s> Either that or hide in the closet - not my style. </s>
<s> &quot;I delete\quarantine anywhere from 10 to 80 malwares per day,&quot; Isn't it time to find out how such get on your system before one wipes you out? </s>

<s> But I looked at the possiblity of tracing the different ones and got nowhere. </s>
<s> I get cool web search constantly. </s>
<s> Search Assistant took over my home page 3 or 4 times. </s>
<s> Trend gave 30 notices of Dial Tibs a and instructions for downloading the fix, which wasn't an .exe and wasn't recognized by the Anti-Virus pattern file. </s>
<s> I got many other repeats characterized as critical, which were quarantined, apparently before corrupting much. </s>
<s> So far, the worst symptom is erratic browsing and IE6 freeze followed by shut-down and send error message, like MS is going to do something heroic and cut off the monster's head. </s>
<s> I refuse to be paranoid about surfing; I go where I please and when I get a trojan ( regularly ), the last 3 URLs get put in AdAware ( I've got a bunch in there ). </s>
<s> Yeah, the overhead is excessive but since I'm retired, I look at it as a game of sorts. </s>
<s> I figure if none of the major players in Anti-Virus can block this stuff but they seem to be able to contain the worst threats, I'll see how it goes. </s>
<s> Since I do have several backups for everything I'm concerned about, and haven't lost any files I care about for a couple of years, the worst-case scenario is putting in a formatted C drive, re-installing XP Pro, transferring my backed up Documents and Settings, Favorites and Desktop, and reinstalling some of the apps that like to clutter up the registry, but that I prefer not to do without. </s>
<s> At least I'm learning about the guts. </s>
<s> If so, you are letting the pests in. </s>
<s> Try Firefox and see the pest count go down. </s>
