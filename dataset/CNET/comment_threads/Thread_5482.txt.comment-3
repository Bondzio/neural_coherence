If you are talking production, I believe you want to invest in RAID so you do not lose the music you produced because of disk failure that can happen just from random bad luck or heat.
Writing steady streams of digitized music, and read/write of large chunks of digitized music during audio editing can heat up a drive fast.
Everything you are buying is for creating the music.
It's the only valuable stuff.
Raid-5 starts with 3 HDDs; Raid-10 starts with 4.
Gets expensive!
However, I just read about the Data Robotics Drobo that provides the same protection as Raid-5 but starts with only two HDDs.
You can read about it on this PC World link.. http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,134339/article.html Cost of this box is pretty competitive.
