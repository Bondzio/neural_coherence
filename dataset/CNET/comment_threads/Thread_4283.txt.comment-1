Ok, so I just upgraded from an Intel q6600(2.4Ghz) to a q9400(2.66Ghz).
Now, when overclocking with the 6600 I couldn't get it to go past 3.0Ghz (just wont boot past the windows logo screen), so I left it alone, figuring it was the just the chip.
But after upgrading, I have the same problem with he q9400, even though I know for a fact that the q9400 can be overclocked a lot higher.
Can anyone help me!?
I overclock through the BIOS btw.
Also, when sitting idle, the cpu drops to 2Ghz, but when I start an app, or do anything, it jumps back up to 2.66Ghz.
Maybe that has something to do with it?
