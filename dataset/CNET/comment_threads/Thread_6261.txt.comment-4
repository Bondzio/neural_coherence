I hope that the ribbon was indeed intended for that model# use.
-OR- the roller/spindle isn't too worn or it's &quot;key&quot; to handle the roll is crisp and not worn.
If this has been used for some extended time, the wear&tear could allow some slop as it were.
These are pretty robust printers but users do tend to wear them out.
good luck -----Willy
