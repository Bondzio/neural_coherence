1.1.1	Hello , I recently built a new PC that I installed an LG BD-ROM/DVD Rewriter .	St
1.1.2	With the optical came a Super Multi Blue Install Disc for Windows Ver .	St
1.1.3	1.1a .	St
1.1.4	I installed the software with no problems until now .	St
1.1.5	A few weeks ago I purchased a Sony BD-RE ( 25 GB ) to be used to store a bunch of pictures , music , videos , and docs in-case of a harddrive failure .	St
1.1.6	Last night I went to copy all of these files to the BD-RE and burn , however , when I placed the disc in the optical , the drive does not even recognize there 's a disc and it spits the disc back out .	St
1.1.7	I talked to a friend about this today who told me that a lot of the BD burners will have problems reading and writing to a BD-RE and it is necessary to install a third party software that will allow this to be accomplished .	St
1.1.8	Any truths to this or advice on how to deal with this ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	If my guess is correct , you do n't have a & quot ; BD writer & quot ; , just a BD player .	St
1.3.1	I am at work now , so I do n't have the model number w/me , but the front of the drive says BD-ROM/DVD Rewriter .	St
1.4.1	Same exact problem for me using a Mac .	St
1.4.2	What type of discs SHOULD be used with this unit ?	Ques
1.5.1	It turned out the member was recording the BD-RE on a DVR and trying to get them to work on the PC and other DVD/BR players .	St
1.5.2	They seemed to stop posting when they switched to DVD-RW or DVD+RW media .	St
1.5.3	The DVR offered a means to make DVD R/W media compatible with other machines .	St
1.5.4	As to an Apple , I fear that since Apple did n't send out units with BD capability you 'll have to question the maker of that BD drive .	St
1.5.5	I ca n't comment further since many details are missing .	St
1.5.6	Bob	St
1.6.1	Bob , You are correct .	St
1.6.2	My uncle selected the components for the new PC and is upset he did n't look at the specs of the drive more carefully .	St
1.6.3	Sometime down the road I may put mine on ebay or something and upgrade to a writer .	St
1.6.4	Thanks .	Polite
1.6.5	Jon	St
1.7.1	I think I 'm seeing the end of this medium for storage .	St
1.7.2	Today 's users seem to be very impatient and will not accept the 10 minutes or so to create a DVD or BD disc .	St
1.7.3	Not only that but the cost of USB sticks and drives plummeted to make this media unloved by so many .	St
1.7.4	I wonder how much longer we 'll see this media .	St
1.7.5	bob	St
1.8.1	BD-ROM I should have known .	St
1.8.2	I been at this too long .	St
1.8.3	ROM Read Only Media .	St
1.8.4	Of course it wo n't write BD Media .	St
1.8.5	Wo n't even reconize the disk .	St
1.8.6	whitemountains	St
