thank you for the help, i am going to try those suggestions.
i suppose it would be storage and backup.
i had my pictures stored on another drive in the house that just crashed last week and then all i had was the backup on my external which then became my storage and then did this weird thing days after the other hard drive crash.
but i still had other backup on the discs, of which most aren't reading now either.
grr... if it was all back up then i would be fine, but like dominoes, i lost 3 different places of storage and backup.
