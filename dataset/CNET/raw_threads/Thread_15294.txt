I was wondering if there was a wireless router out there that could use one of these as an internet input. That way me and my wife could use it at the same time. Any such beast in existence?

I must decline all the details since to do this you must be able to take the clues I offered and run with it or it's not a solution for you. I bet something similar could be rigged up using your laptop and a common router but again unless you have a firm grasp on networking this is not a solution. Try this. Goto 3grouter.com and see if that is what you want. Bob

If you exceed you byte limits, it's very expensive. 2. They do not discount the plan on this. My droid costs me less per month than the wifi mobile hotspot without a cap (for now.) 3. There were some that made claims the units overheat but mine ran 24x7 and was fine for the weeks we used it. Bob

We are renting a house for 6 months, and pickings are slim there. Sat(expensive) dial up( yea, right) or cell use. Verizons 3G is really good there. Since it is only 6 months I am not going with a 2 year plan, which means it will not be really be cheap either way. Any other good ideas out there?

I have used this when they were testing and it is very fast we were streaming (ie transmitting) hidef video from a moving car. Work very well considering that you cannot buffer outgoing live video. Have not had time to read the fine print on their contract but they implied they were going to offer a tiered plan so you could by what you need. Sprint/Clear if you can get it offers a true unlimited 4G plan but in theory LTE will be faster but we will see who is telling the truth.

But why not look at the six months and cost in breaking the contract? Just pay the man for the breakup and what does that work out for the six months? Here I got a discount on the droid and it costs less than the hotspot. I'm keeping this one. Bob
