i have a compaq evo with a 40 gig drive and a dvd rw drive.
recently i reformatted the drive.
it has one primary partition and the fat 32 file system.
the machine will boot to the c drive, but will not recognize the dvd drive.
i get an invalid drive spec message.
i need that drive to install windows from the cd.
when i boot from the hard drive, i get a message asking whether i want to boot from the hd or the dvd.
is there something else i need to do to get the machine to recognize the dvd?
