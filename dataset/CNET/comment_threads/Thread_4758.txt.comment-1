So I built my own computer and bought three monitors and I am trying to figure out how to connect the monitors, but need help.
I bought a Radeon HD 8350 Graphics card and it comes with two DVI ports, a HDMI port, and a Display port The only problem is that I can't figure out how to rig this up to have three monitors side by side.
Does anybody have an Idea of what to do and also what products I should buy
