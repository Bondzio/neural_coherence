<s> hi, I'm having problem with displaying back the folders hidden by a certain type of virus in my flash disk. </s>
<s> I have already scanned the drive for viruses and found one named MS-DOS.com, a win32/Tanatos.M type of virus. </s>
<s> I tried displaying the hidden folders using the &quot;show hidden files and folders&quot; in the folder options but it didn't work. </s>
<s> I backed up my files and tried reformatting my flash disk but the files could not be deleted from the drive. </s>
<s> I could still access the said folders when i type it in the search box. </s>
<s> when I right click inside the folder to see the folder properties, only the &quot;Read-me&quot; & &quot;Archive&quot; option is enabled, the hidden option is disabled. </s>

<s> Why not just format it? </s>
