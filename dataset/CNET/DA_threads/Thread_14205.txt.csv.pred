1.1.1	and now the sound is somewhat corrupted .	St
1.1.2	I mean that every minute or so music or DVDs or whatever seems to be warbled .	St
1.1.3	I 'm able to access the internet without a problem and I do n't think that installing this hardware has interfered with the IRQ channels since sound is controlled by the mobo .	St
1.1.4	Problem is , the drivers that came with the desktop adaptor were not XP verified .	St
1.1.5	So if anyone could please tell me how to troubleshoot this , I 'd be grateful .	Ques
1.2.1	See http : //www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/storage/IDE-DMA.mspx	St
1.3.1	I just got the same card , and its doing the same thing .	St
1.3.2	Studdering occationally , as if my system is doing hard work , when really its just idle .	St
1.3.3	I can tell something is happening because any audio playing will studder as if slowing down momentarily , as well as mouse speed studdering .	St
1.3.4	I 'm certain it has nothing to do with drm as suggested above , as it affects entire system , its just more noticable with audio playing ( including game audio ) .	St
1.3.5	i read people having problems with the drivers ( http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16833127213 ) , and that & quot ; The chipset is made by atheros , which also is in the wpm7000 by linksys & quot ; ( from post in link above ) , but i ca n't seem to find the drivers for a wpm7000 by linksys , if it even exsists .	St
1.3.6	this is really a pain in the ass .	St
1.3.7	uninstalling the card gets rid of the problem , and it comes back when i reinstall it .	St
1.3.8	its also auto starting the d-link wireless connection manager twice , so that two green bars appear in my notification area .	St
1.3.9	i had a netgear wpn 311 who 's drivers kept crashing to blue screen randomly , which is why i thought i was & quot ; upgrading & quot ; to this d-link card and router .	St
1.3.10	so im not having the best of luck with wireless .	St
1.4.1	I figured out that the linksys drivers reffered are these : ( http : //www-uk.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite ? c=L_Download_C2 & childpagename=UK % 2FLayout & cid=1129319258516 & packedargs=sku % 3D1144912118458 & pagename=Linksys % 2FCommon % 2FVisitorWrapper ) the EU and AU version of the linksys card chipset is made by atheros , like the d-link cards .	St
1.4.2	i tried this driver , and , while the card appears as WMP300N - Wireless-N PCI Adapter , it works , but still studders the same way ( audio still studders ) .	St
1.4.3	the studdering is making the mouse hard to controll too which is the biggest pain in the ass , cause i got ta photoshop for work .	St
1.5.1	http : //www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/storage/IDE-DMA.mspx It 's a simple procedure that I 've used a few hundred times to cure this .	St
1.5.2	It 's so simple that I do that first before doing anything else .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	I tried the linksys driver , it did n't work , the internet connection sucked I got the updated driver from dlink [ 1.02 i think ] and now i have a great connection , but i have the stutters anyone ?	Ques
1.7.1	forgive my ignorance , but what does switching the DMA of my IDE harddrive or cdrom help this issue with a driver for a network adapter card ?	Ques
1.7.2	or am i doing something wrong ?	Ques
1.8.1	I must decline writing the long answer for each member .	St
1.8.2	It 's a quick , painless , no reboot procedure and we use that first to dismiss the usual .	St
1.8.3	If this is unacceptable then please research it further or just take it to a repair counter .	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
1.9.1	thanks for the reply , bob from what I can tell , both my primary and secondary are in DMA mode .	Polite
1.9.2	i still seem to having the audio/video stutter issue thanks again for the reply i guess i will have to do more research	St
1.10.1	We have to flip it to PIO and back in a specific manner since we ca n't tell if it 's in DMA 0 or 5 or 6 .	St
1.10.2	If you decline the procedure I 'd rather not explore all the other areas first .	St
1.10.3	Bob	St
1.11.1	i will do that now and i will let you know thanks !	St
1.12.1	My primary channel devices 0 and 1 are both DMA mode 5 My secondary channel device 0 is mode 2 and device 1 is n/a	St
1.13.1	I 'm unsure if you are posting in the right place .	St
1.13.2	Also I ca n't find all the details asked for when you post .	St
1.13.3	I suggest a new post in the right forum and here 's the forum note : Note : If you 're asking for technical help , please be sure to include all your system info , including operating system , model number , and any other specifics related to the problem .	St
1.13.4	Also please exercise your best judgment when posting in the forums -- revealing personal information such as your e-mail address , telephone number , and address is not recommended .	Sug
