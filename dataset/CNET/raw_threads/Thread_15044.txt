I play alot of gaames i.e. half life 2, counter strike, and battlefield 2. I also do film editing for my miniDV cam. I know CRTs are faster brighter and clearer than lcds, but lcds have made big improvements on them. What I was wondering if you have any suggestions on what to buy. any input would be very usefull.

I installed a fancy Radeon video card, with DVI output, a few weeks ago and the game demos that came with it looked great. Also,I don't have room on my desk for a comparable CRT monitor.
