My comp is now freezeing with regulatory time. Problem is I have to buy Windos XP if I buy a new HD. But what im wondering most about is what HD is perfect for this comp? If you know post it. The motherboard is a Cognac, don't ask me I can't find anything about this motherboard, well from the company that made it. I have a Intel Celeron 566MHZ processor, 15GB HD, with Win98. I have 384MB RAM, and a 64MB Nvidia graphics card.

Lots of things can cause freeze ups besides HD issues. And, why must you get XP if you replace the drive? That system is a bit thin on hardware resoures to run XP well. You can still buy drives of 40 gigs readily and 20s are available. Your PC, at 5 years, will probably handle a 40 gig drive but might not use the full burst speed of it. WD, Seagate, Maxtor and such are plentiful and any should work ok with your system. As for freezing, it's fairly simple to do some basic cleaning and maintenance. Get the dust out of the fans, reseat boards and RAM modules, and do the usual disk maintenance and spyware removal. If that doesn't help, your power supply might be getting weaker. Make sure its fan and insides get a good blast of compressed air as well.

Recover your Windows 98 product key if you need it for a Windows XP upgrade version. It is good to have the product key, just in case.... http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html
