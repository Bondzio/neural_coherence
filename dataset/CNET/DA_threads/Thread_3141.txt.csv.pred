1.1.1	Hi everyone !	St
1.1.2	I 'm having a problem with my speakers , which are Altec Lansing ACS295 speakers with 2 satellites and one big subwoofer .	St
1.1.3	The problem is that they are making strange sounds -- not like static , because if that were the case I would know the speakers are blown , it 's happened to me before .	St
1.1.4	The noise is more like someone blowing into a microphone or tapping a microphone that 's plugged in to a speaker so you can hear it , and it happens repeatedly .	St
1.1.5	Also , I do n't need to be sending any sound to the speakers and they will still do it if they have power -- I can even remove the input cable from the cable , and as long as they are plugged in , they make these noises .	St
1.1.6	I 've noticed that the subwoofer makes more of a & quot ; tapping on a microphone & quot ; kind of a sound , and the left satellite makes louder sounds like blowing into a microphone .	St
1.1.7	Actually , the subwoofer kind of sounds like when you are adjusting the cable to a speaker , but I checked all the cables and they 're all in good condition and plugged in fine .	St
1.1.8	I have n't played music on these speakers too loudly , and they 're good quality speakers anyway .	St
1.1.9	Any way to fix this ?	Ques
1.2.1	Check your audio software settings .	St
1.2.2	Do you use codecs ?	Ques
1.2.3	Are you sure there compatible with your computers configuration ?	Ques
1.2.4	How about a web cam ?	Ques
1.2.5	This could be reverberation from the microphone on the web cam .	St
1.2.6	Your audio software should have a setting to minimize this effect .	St
1.3.1	Can you plug the speaker set into some other device like a small personal radio to see if it still happens ?	Ques
1.3.2	If it does , you know it 's something in the set .	St
1.3.3	If not , it 's coming from the PC .	St
1.3.4	This does n't fix your problem but you 've got to track down the cause first .	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	So I tested my speakers on an external device ( I do n't know why I did n't think of that ... ) , in this case an mp3 player , and for a while it was perfectly fine , and so I thought it was the computer , but I let it play for a bit longer just to make sure , and it ended up making those same sounds in the left speaker .	St
1.5.2	But the weird thing is , with the mp3 player , the sounds are much more infrequent and much less noisy than with the computer .	St
1.5.3	Also , the subwoofer is n't making any sound when the speakers are connected to the mp3 player .	St
1.5.4	One idea I just had is that it could be because the subwoofer is so close to the two satellite speakers .	St
1.5.5	It does have a sticker on the top that says that & quot ; the subwoofer is not magnetically shielded and should not be played near a video display .	St
1.5.6	Placing the subwoofer on the floor under a desk is recommended. & quot ; What do you guys think ?	Ques
1.6.1	put the bon the floor .	St
1.6.2	Maybe on right track .	St
1.7.1	Generally they are n't noticeable unless they react with something else .	St
1.7.2	It would seem that something in your speaker system is acting as a detector/demodulator .	St
1.7.3	This could be a faulty component , a design flaw or any of a number of things .	St
1.7.4	A simple diode can act as a detector and some oscillating circuit act as a demodulator which just removes the carrier signal .	St
1.7.5	Even a poor ground or solder connection can act something like a diode depending on the circuit it 's in .	St
1.7.6	An unintended oscillations in electronic circuits would be hard to isolate and resolve without proper instruments .	St
1.7.7	You can try shielding but my guess is your success will be limited .	St
1.7.8	At least you have something to work with now .	St
1.7.9	Good luck .	Polite
1.8.1	Of course keeping the sub away from other components is always recommended .	St
1.8.2	Low frequencies tend to be less directional and you 'll hear them just as well ... .or maybe even better ... .if placed on the floor .	St
