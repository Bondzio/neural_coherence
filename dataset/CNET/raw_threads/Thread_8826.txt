With 2 PCs and a router you have the distinct possibility of 3 firewalls that could block this. As well as account issues. I'll note a discussion where a member took the long way around to get a share working. It was firewall related but on top of that they discovered the Windows annoyance about a share needing to be recreated due to the firewall being &quot;up&quot; at the time of creation.

I had just finished reading the long discussion on your link when I received your reply. I forgot to mention in my firest post that I have Windows Live OneCare on both systems. I went into settings on both systems and changed a few things, the opened Network Setup Wizard on both machins and went through the process again. When finished, I had another printer icon on Printers and Faxes window on Notebook. It was check marked, auto hp psc series on HPDESKTOP. Under the ports tab, there is a check next to..\\D...Local Port Auto hp psc 2200 series on HPDESKTOP. I am able to print wireless now. Now when I Right click a folder to share on either machine, the area is greyed out next to &quot;Share this folder on the network&quot;. Cannot put a check into box. I chose, Share Files and printers on setup wizard. Also, at the top of my Outlook Express Email window, PRINT is grayed out on the Tosbiba Notebook. If I right click a message, Print is grayed out on that window also. Not sure if any of this is relative to first post, but thanks for any more tips.
