1.1.1	I have two NEC 22&quot; CRT monitors that I use for work that are attached to a single BFG GeForce 7800 GTX OC 512MB.	St
1.1.2	In order to obtain the most desktop real estate available, I run each monitor resolution at 2048 x 1536 x 32-bit color at 85Hz.	St
1.1.3	Now I am looking to replace these monitors with LCD equivalents, but I don't want to lose the wonderful resolution that I am so used to having.	St
1.1.4	Other than the Dell's 3007WFP 30-inch Wide-Screen Flat Panel LCD, does anyone know of any other vendors that sell LCD monitors that support this high of resolution or higher?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks, Timothy	St
