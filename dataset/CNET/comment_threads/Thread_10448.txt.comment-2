I can't give a 100% answer.
However, you can install and see if it works or not, it won't hurt the system thought it may hang.
If it works, then OK, if not, then you have to pick one type then find similar FPM or EDO of *all* same type.
Some systems you could mix types, but not all.
If you can google for specs on that model# Acer will give a more informed answer.
good luck -----Willy
