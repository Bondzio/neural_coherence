You could try re-installing the TCP/IP Protocol, and Microsoft Client, but that's not going to help if you have spyware or a virus.
You could download Stinger: http://vil.nai.com/vil/stinger/ and it fits on a floppy, since you don't seem to be able to get to the Internet.
Does the computer have any Antivirus software running?
Are the signatures current?
Any Antispyware software?
