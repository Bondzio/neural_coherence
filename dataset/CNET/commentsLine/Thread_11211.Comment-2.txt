i presume you are trying to connect to a router or access point to do this.
if the tech did not change the default, it's probably just &quot;admin&quot; (without quotes).
this is typical but should be contained in your documentation.
generally you need to authenticate yourself by adding your mac address to a listing if mac filtering is used and enter the encription code.
you can also reset everything and start over if need be.
you don't want to be locked into the need for a technician to do this if you are paying him.
