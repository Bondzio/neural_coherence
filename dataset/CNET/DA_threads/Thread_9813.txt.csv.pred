1.1.1	Hi, Is there any practical differnce between a drive described as &quot;pocket&quot; versus a similar drive described as &quot;External&quot;?.	St
1.1.2	I once heard that the Pockets are designed to be sturdier, since they are intended to be carried around, hence the &quot;pocket&quot; term, whereas the externals are a bit more fragile, and not really designed for portability.However, I only saw that comment one time so I am not very confident about its legitimacy.	St
1.1.3	Any confirmation or clarification will be appreciated.	St
1.2.1	&quot;pocket&quot; to me means maybe you can put it in your pocket (small).	St
1.2.2	Studier has got nothing to do with it.	St
