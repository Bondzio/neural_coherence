<s> I'm breathing some life into an old computer we have. </s>
<s> It's a no name brand put together by a local computer store no longer in business. </s>
<s> I took off the cover and saw 1 Samsumg 128mb chip w/ 2 empty slots next to it. </s>
<s> The number on the chip is M368L1713CT1-CBO. </s>
<s> Is it possible to increase the memory to something like 4gb? </s>
<s> What are my options? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> So now I realize that I have to identify the motherboard to know how much ram it will accept. </s>
<s> To be continued..... </s>
<s> So I found out what the motherboard is and located the manual online. </s>
<s> There are 3 memory slots which can take up to 1GB per slot. </s>
<s> These folks have a ram find it tool........might be worth a shot. </s>

<s> What you provided sounds like the chipset name vice the MB brand series and mfg. </s>
<s> If the PC runs ...there are system utilities that can give you most if not all the info. </s>
<s> If the system runs and you can get to the internet, then the Crucial.com with the system test may work too. </s>

<s> I ran a program that identified the motherboard, so now I'm confident about what ram I need to get. </s>
<s> Unfortunately from everything I've read, Win98 doesn't run very well with more than 512mb, but 768 can be used with a MS workaround. </s>
<s> Can I mix a 512 stick with a 256 stick, or do I need three 256's to make the 768?? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> options might be ? </s>
<s> Here's a forum on CNET that addresses questions on Win95/98. </s>
<s> Might be worthwhile reading before buying more RAM. </s>

<s> Thanks VAPCMD, I appreciate the crucial suggestion. </s>
<s> I went to the site and they didn't list my motherboard. </s>
<s> I ran this utility http://www.majorgeeks.com/Evonsoft_System_Info_d4871.html and it told me what my motherboard is. </s>
<s> I also looked at the motherboard and saw what chipset was installed. </s>
<s> I went to the VIA site and located the manual for the board and it confirmed what I was looking at. </s>
<s> Mainly the 3 ram slots. </s>
<s> I'm only increasing the ram to 768, which is what Win98 is comfortable with, even though the motherboard will take up to 3GB. </s>
<s> When I get the computer online, I will go to the crucial site and run the test anyway to see what it says. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> If you get on the Internet with Windows 98, you're going to be highly exposed to viruses and other malware because it's been unsupported for years and thus is lacking a ton of needed updates to patch vulnerabilities. </s>
<s> You're also going to find it very difficult to find software that runs on it. </s>
<s> If you have some old games you want to play on this dinosaur, that would be OK, but I sure wouldn't want to try going online with something that outdated. </s>
<s> Save your money and get a new computer or tablet. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> wpgwpg, Thanks. </s>
<s> I hear what you are saying. </s>
<s> Clamwin supports Win98, but I realize it's only for scanning, not real-time. </s>
<s> This is my wife's old computer from when her first 2 kids were young and yes, she has alot of games on it that won't run on anything later than Win98. </s>
<s> We are resurrecting this computer for our 5 year old as a first computer. </s>
<s> So we might go online a little, but it's mostly for the games she wants to use. </s>
<s> No skin off my back. </s>
<s> Only spent $4 for an ethernet card, $2.36 for a cable, and $4.95 for a memory upgrade. </s>
<s> It's been fun messin' with it. </s>
<s> Like you say, if I want to spend any real $ on it I might as well get a new computer. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> with an updated OS, more RAM, more disk space, etc. </s>
<s> is often a good way to go. </s>
