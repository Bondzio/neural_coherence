However, I want to be able to set up automatic backups for all the computers in my office, but the backup software that comes with the drive (Memeo AutoBackup) apparently is only licensed for one computer. Does this mean that I'll be able to only use it on one computer, but then configure the drive to backup all of the networked computers, or does it mean that it will only backup files on the computer that the software is installed on? If that's the case, then I'll have to look into something else, like the HP Media Vault perhaps. I checked out their site, and it's very skimpy in terms of information on this stuff.

Since it did such a great job, I stopped looking. -&gt; For such companies that can't use great software like this we have to step back and write about http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/products since they supplied the single user version of said product.
