choice of monitor (crt or lcd) is irrelevant for performance and independent of old or new pc.
all you need to do, in my opinion: 1. clean install of the os (including formatting the disk) 2. add a second (internal!)
hard disk if you really need more disk space (#1 tends to free a lot of space because all kinds of rubbish is deleted, but - of course - you might have 60 gb of music and photo's that you restore and then it's full again) there's absolutely nothing wrong with 1 gb and a 2.4 ghz pentium 4 for windows xp, and no reason why it should be slower than it was when it was new.
