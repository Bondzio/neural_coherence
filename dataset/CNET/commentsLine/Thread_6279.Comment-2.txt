i'd look at some wifi print server.
i've used the linksys and it's good if not a little hard to setup.
not hard but i tried to do it without reading the instructions and it doesn't work unless i followed the directions.
i've gone the bluetooth route and it was a dud.
talk about slow... minutes per page... bob
