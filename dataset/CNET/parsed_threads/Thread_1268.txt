<s> you have a 775 board and an AM2+ CPU, not compatible! </s>
<s> if you like the board, get a Core 2 Duo/Quad If yo like the processor, get an AM2+ board Also, if you like X3's check out the Phenom II 720, not on newegg yet though </s>
<s> So this will work with it? </s>

<s> rather old, I have no idea whether ECS is good with BIOS updates http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813157149 will work with Phenom normal, not sure about Ph2 </s>
<s> Best to with the platform .... CPU (AMD or Intel) and a motherboard that supports it. </s>
<s> Also give us a budget so we know what price range we're working with. </s>
<s> If AMD...look at something with a better user rating ...perhaps something like the one below Gigabyte Motherboard for AMD CPU: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128373 VAPCMD </s>
<s> also, you have an atx cae but a matx motherboard </s>
<s> since matx is smaller than atx, it is compatible. </s>
