Aside from the wonderful hints above, (as overheating would cause the laptop to do this) I would try to verify that the laptops are good and clean with anti-virus and anti-rootkit software.
If it was just one laptop, sure I could see the above being true more so, but for both laptops (not out of the question) shutting down?
I am sure you must share files?
music perhaps?
I just start with easy then dig inside.
The difference in hardware also supports my decision.
