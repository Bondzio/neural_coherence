if so then you have all the drivers to deal with and not just this wifi stick.
some folk forget what they did but the short list i use is motherboard, then audio, then video then other drivers.
if you want to try something quick, unplug the stick and boot safe mode to remove the item in device manager.
reboot normal and then install the stick per the maker's instruction.
