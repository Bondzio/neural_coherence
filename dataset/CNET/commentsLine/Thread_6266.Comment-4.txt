ok, update... bought an enclosure at compusa, disassembled my seagate drive (the drive is ok, but the &quot;middle-man&quot; chip bruned out, as i was told by s. customer service), put in the drive in the new enclosure... plugged in... xp can't auto-install, or update the drive... it recognizes a &quot;storage device is plugged in&quot;, but doesn't go beyond that... what do i do?
heeeelp.
thanks
