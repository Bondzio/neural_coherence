<s> I am planning on building my first computer fairly soon. </s>
<s> Before I order all of my parts in the next two months, I have to know exactly what I am buying in terms of cooling. </s>
<s> The case comes with two 80mm fans. </s>
<s> I understand that the fan in the power supply goes in the back (obviously), but besides the other air hole in the back where one of the 80mm fans will fit, where will any additional fans go? </s>
<s> Where do I install them? </s>
<s> Do I just sit them inside the case? </s>
<s> And finally, what is a heatsink and how and where do I install it? </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>

<s> made of iron, copper or aluminum [all good heat conducting materials]. </s>
<s> They have many &quot;fins&quot;, the sole purpose of the fins is to increase the surface area for heat to be transferred through. </s>
<s> The heat transfer can be by natural convention [simply heat rises], or forced convectionn [a fan of some type moves air past the fins to transfer heat much faster]. </s>
<s> The heat sink is flat on one surface for making intimate contact with the flat surface of the device that it is removing heat from. </s>
<s> There are more exotic versions that use copper heat pipes in conjunction with fins etc. </s>
<s> Some Video cards and chipsets have simple heat sinks. </s>
<s> Some include the fan. </s>
<s> The most well know is the HSF [heat sink/fan] that attaches to the cPU to get the humungeous heat that the CPU generates away from the CPU core. </s>
<s> Virtually all cases have mounting places for fans. </s>
<s> There are usually a place in the front to mount a fan to pull air in. </s>
<s> The mounting places are not real obviou from outside. </s>
<s> If you buy a retail boxed [3 year warranty] CPU, it will come with a HSF that will adequately cool the CPU. </s>
<s> [but overclokers et al put beetter HSF's on them] I now will only use a case with a top exhaust fan. </s>
<s> They are extremely effective, again because heat rises and the top area of the case gets hot. </s>
<s> The ones with a top exhaust may also have additional fans that come with them, but if not they will have places to mount fans front and rear. </s>
<s> The side fan that blows air into the case in the vicinity of the CPU?HSF is also very helpful. </s>
<s> There is one new development that is catching on very slowly, that is the BTX case/system. </s>
<s> In them the fan arrangements are somewhat difference. </s>
<s> This link will provide alot of the details for you: http://www.arcticsilver.com/arctic_alumina_instructions.htm Next, if you buy a factory cpu with supplied fan, it should contain a help guide or similar to install it. </s>
<s> The above link is one of the perferred comppounds to apply, but the orginal OEM one is OK too. </s>
<s> It all comes together when things are in hand, just use common sense and deft care. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
