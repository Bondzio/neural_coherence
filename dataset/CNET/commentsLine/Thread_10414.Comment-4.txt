not really true.
most router come with 192.168.1.1/0.1 as a preset ip address, but almost all routers will allow you to change the address.
also, with nat, it should be impossible for anything outside the router to see which internal ip orginated the request.
they could check mac addresses, if they require you to register your computers mac address, then the routers mac address will be different, but good routers will allow you to change their mac address to your computers instead.
as was said before, apart from os fingerprinting, or checking the mac address, there really should be no way to tell that you are using a router.
and, even if there is, set up a computer, with two network cards, and use bog standard microsoft ics, and you have the network shared between as many computers as you need.
