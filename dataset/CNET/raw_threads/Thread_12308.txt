Personally I am a avid fan and user of WD so that makes it my favorite brand. To me, it is reliable and stable. Pricing wise is reasonable.

And when it comes time for me to get a hard drive I look at the reviews/storage capacity/price and see what I can get for the best bang for my buck. I always try to stick to WD and Seagate though. Right now I've been using Seagate and I haven't had any problems.

Today they all are pretty reliable and for me it boils down to cost. Realiablity is really just a matter of luck and if you are unlucky no matter which brand you choose could end up being flaky. But I don't care, hard drive are cheap and as long as I got my data backed up, I have no worries. Just my 2 cents. Cheers!

To get the 5 year warranty one has to purchase enterprise class drives or retail box drives that are labeled &quot;5 year warranty.&quot; Seagate also sells drives with 1 and 3 year warranties, mostly into the OEM and external markets. Maxtor is now owned by Seagate. Still only carries a 3 year warranty on retail packaging..

In their defense, the WD and Samsung drives were over 60 degrees C in a poorly-ventilated case, which is beyond the rated temperature, but I'm placing my bets on my two fairly new Seagate drives for now. I have yet to see a recent Seagate/Maxtor drive die. I think the last bad Seagate I saw was an 80 MB 5.25&quot;. (yes, megabyte).

I spend the bit higher amount, but in all my computers and all the operatings systems, the ones that live on are Hitachi. WD and all the others die on me in around 1 year or just past it. In fact the last brand new computer I had built one year ago had a WD and in one day it gave me a failure notice! I had the builder purchase a Hitachi and it is still going!

The WD S25 delivers ultra-high performance with its 3 Gb/s and 6 Gb/s SAS interfaces and a sustained sequential data rate of 128 MB/sec. In addition to all the speed required to service any enterprise need, the WD S25 also provides a 1.6 M hour MTBF rating. I must say I'm impressed.

I've used practically every brand of hard drive out there. The only brand that has a 100% survival rating is Samsung. I've got several that are 11 years old and still going strong. Maybe the new WD drives are better, but my failure rate with them used to be quite high. Nowadays Samsung is the only brand I'll put in the computers I build. I have one of the new Samsung 1 TB drives in my newest computer and it is awesome!

Both of these were Western Digital Caviar drives. One drive was on a new computer still under warranty and was replaced by the manufacturer. The other was an older drive, of unknown history, salvaged from a discarded computer. That ran for several months after being installed in a pieced together computer before failing. I have heard similar storied from friends concerning WD drives and have not heard such stories concerning Seagate drives. It is for these reasons that I prefer Seagate if that option is available.

As long as you stick to the major brands, it is a matter of luck of the pick from the assembly line. One extra step I sometimes do is google the model number to see if there is a larger than normal amount of complaints for a particular model, so I don't get stuck with a device that has a design flaw.

Even for a back up drive with very little on it I was rather disappointed. It got pretty hot. Ive unplugged it and once it cooled down it ran fine. I put a fan right in front of the hard drive in the case and still shut down every 3 days. So perhaps Western Digital sold me a fluke of a lemon? Oh, the warrenty expired on the 3 year mark. this p,o,s died exactly 2 months later.
