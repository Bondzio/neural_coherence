I recently built a new maching from the ground up and fear that I am having some power issues and possibly heating issues. Seems like there are some smart folks around here that can help me out. Here are the current specs: (Note all drivers and bios have been updated) Mid tower ATX Mod case with LED panel on front. Elitegroup PM800-M2 Micro ATX Motherboard 450w Generic Power Supply 2 LED Exhaust Fans P4 3.4G Hyperthreading 800 FSB 1mb L2 Cache 2G DDR 3300 Radeon 9800 Pro 128mb in an 8X AGP Slot 2X 120G IDE Drives Connected to Adaptec 1200A Raid controller; Mirrored 1X 80G IDE Drive Connected to IDE Channel 0 1X DVDRW (Master) Connected to IDE Channel 1 1X CDRW (Slave) Connected to IDE Channel 1 Soundblaster Audigy2 ZS Platinum w/Front Panel Control Generic 9In1 Card Reader in a 3.5 bay Generic 3.5 Floppy Drive in a 3.5 bay Except for the P4 processor, all parts were working fine pulled from an Intel Motherboard that had an IDE channel die on me. Whew! Now to the problem. After install the Radeon Video card the computer crashes frequently. (Yes, all drivers were updated) I pulled the video card, uninstalled the drivers and now IE 6.0 crashes every 45min. Even while I was typing in this forum. (Went to notepad to type the draft.) I am conerned that maybe there is a power issue????? I did have to use some Y calbes on the power side to accomodate all of the peripherals. I also noted that when the Radeon card was installed that the temps on the cpu were around 120f, now they are around 105f. Am I draining a 450w power supply with these specs? How about the temp? Is the motherboard too cheap? Thanks in advance for you time...

No mention of the OS and if you installed the latest drivers you can find for the motherboard, but it's a common cause. The mention of fans plus quite a full machine would have me running it without the case cover for now. While my p4 is all of 3.0GHz, I fitted a generic 680Watt supply to it for the simple reason I know to max out that area even though I don't believe it could deliver that number. Bob

(First thing I actually did) I will pick up a new PS and see if that works. I am still a little concerned about the motherboard being on the cheapy side as well. Tough to rule out something when your faith in it is declining :-/

That's one full box and it's too certain that sometihing will get uncomfortable in there. Some will fill up a box and start with unstable. I start smaller and add to a stable box. Bob

All those goodies suck power and the video card is an demanding one. Replace now before something starts to degrade and be ruined. that's it... tada -----Willy
