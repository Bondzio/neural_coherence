i am so disappointed with my epson artisan 810 printer.
the print heads clog and epson refuses to warranty the product becuase we used non-epson ink.
the problem is that the epson ink is very expensive and the non-epson is less expensive than the epson ink.
(even though it is still much more expensive than canon's - so you know what my next buy will be) it is a shame that a company like epson would set such a trap for its loyal customers..
