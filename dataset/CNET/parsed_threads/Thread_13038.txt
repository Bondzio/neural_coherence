<s> I am about to buy a new imac and am having trouble figuring out what i need to buy. </s>
<s> I am a college student and i use my computer for school work, web browsing, and dowloading alot music. </s>
<s> I want my imac to atleast last 3 or 4 year and during that time i dont want to worry about not having enough memory or ram,or my processor being to out of date. </s>
<s> will the 20 inch model with 2gb of memory, 750gb of ram,and 2.66 processor last me comfortably or will i need the 24 inch with 4 gb of memory,1tb of ram and the 3.06 processor? </s>
<s> Either are very nice and run very well. </s>
<s> I'd not fret about RAM since a few years from now you can bump it up for cheap. </s>
<s> Same for disk space. </s>
