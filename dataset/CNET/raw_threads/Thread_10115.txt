I noticed of clicking noise from the hard drive, the noise sound exactly like a clock ticking, This happens only when I am online. if I sign in and leave PC alone, the ticking noise still ocur once every one, two or three secound, Then it incresse a bit more faster when browsing the web. If anyone of you know the problem or know how to solve it, please share. Thank you.
