&quot;The Iomega HD does have Automatic Backup app&quot; backs up what you have on your PC/MAC to that storage unit.
Since you have two copies, one on the PC/Mac and one on the storage unit it is not a disaster when the storage unit dies.
You appear to have changed something so you had but one copy?
