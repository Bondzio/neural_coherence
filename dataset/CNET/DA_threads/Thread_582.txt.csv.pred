1.1.1	Hi, I have an old G3 powerbook, I am wondering if a Travelstar 15GN (10MB) should work with it?	St
1.1.2	It does not appear to recognise the disk (or any of a couple of others I have got lying around) but it boots ok from a CD and recognises RAM etc.	St
1.1.3	any info appreciated cheers Brian	Polite
1.2.1	the Travelstar should work if it is connected correctly.	St
1.2.2	Are you sure that it is a 10MB drive?	St
1.2.3	If it is, trash it.	St
1.2.4	Boot from the CD with the drive installed and see if you can see it with the Disk Utility/Hard Drive Utility.	St
1.2.5	It may be formatted strangely and just needs reinitialising.	St
1.2.6	P	St
