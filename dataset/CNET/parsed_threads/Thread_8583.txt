<s> I bought a computer from my good friend. </s>
<s> Before i bought the computer, he had hard drive problems so he had given it in and got a new hard drive for it. </s>
<s> It's definitely not a hard drive problem. </s>
<s> I think its most definitely a driver problem because i had the same problem with the modem yesterday, i just needed to get on another computer, and download the drivers for it. </s>
<s> But that was a different story because i knew what type of modem i have. </s>
<s> This time, i can go to device manager, and it will be under &quot;other devices&quot; named Video Controller(VGA Compatible). </s>
<s> Along with it in the &quot;other devices column, is Multimedia Audio Controller and Ethernet Controller. </s>
<s> I can type in &quot;dxdiag&quot; into Run and go to display, and beside name and chip type and all of that are just &quot;n/a&quot;. </s>
<s> I have no idea what's going on here at all? </s>
<s> Do i really have no video card? </s>
<s> For most it's Windows. </s>
<s> The stock install from Microsoft needs motherboard drivers before some video cards are detected. </s>
<s> Well, i just updated the motherboard drivers, still no change. </s>
<s> Here's all my information that i DO have. </s>
<s> (Sorry that i didn't include it before) Operating System: Windows XP: Home Edition RAM: 2542 MB Processor: Intel(R)Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.00GHz (w CPUs) System Model: D65GBH (it's a custom computer put together at the store) Also just discovered it can't detect the sound card either. </s>
<s> or the ethernet controller so it's most definitely a driver problem </s>
<s> Sorry but no reason to duplicate efforts. </s>
