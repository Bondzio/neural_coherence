it's system max box running a amd 200xp processor, not sure about the version of win it was on a burnt cd.
I'mmthinking that the cd is corupt or something.
I had both drives in my box last night and for some reason the one 60 only shows 33 gig and the other one wont let me install anything on it.
I'm at a loss right now.
