I dont know anything about the status or past of these HD's ...as I said I'm just a layman trying to piece a couple of kids computers together..so I dont even know if their any good till I hook em up and try to boot..when they say &quot;no operating system&quot; how can I get past that point..Ive been using a floppy from maxtor for installing their harddrives...and had good luck getting it to load up and format /partition...then reboot to load win98se....I tried to begin fdisk..indos but I dont really understand what Im reading to select... yes the ribbons are attached to a slot card ..you think it might be bad ...I cleaned its connection ..pulled and reseated...checked ribbon for flaws..looks new
