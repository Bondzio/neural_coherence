i have a seagate 250gb hardrive and it has been working greatly untill a few days ago.
whenever i connect it to my computer, it makes my computer really slow and i cant do anything untill i turn it off.
i tried to run a disk check when it occasionally poped up on my computer, but it failed to complete it halfway through, now it doesnt even register with the computer when i turned it on.
i'm using windows xp sp2, and if what i need to do requires changing a setting during startup, include a detailed description, because im lost when it comes to that.
