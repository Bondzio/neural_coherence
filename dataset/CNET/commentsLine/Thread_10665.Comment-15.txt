i believe the motherboard for my current laptop can handle up to two gigs of ram.
i can assume there are two slots, and both are filled with one gig memory.
it's a shame 'cause i'd want to upgrade my ram to four, but looks like i can't.
as for your suggestions about big numbers, yeah i understand that.
i just didn't understand the memory deal.
i appreciate your responses!
