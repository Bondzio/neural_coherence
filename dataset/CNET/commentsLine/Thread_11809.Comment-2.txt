it may be possible that your computer connects to your routers dns address.
when you plug into your cable modem you of course get a different dns server.
your router may not be updating but it should in time.
your computer may also play a roll in that.
in the mean time you can manually edit your host file on your computer your host file is located: c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc open the file hosts in notepad and make your changes.
