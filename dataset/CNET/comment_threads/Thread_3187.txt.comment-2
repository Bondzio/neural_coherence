Hi I bought I gaming laptop (2.6GHz Dual core AMD with Nvidia 7900GTX GO -17.1&quot;) graphics and was happy for a short space of time...the reason, when I wanted more performance after a year, there was nothing I could do except to get faster ram, bigger hard drive and re-install Windows.
It cost me 1600 and I regret it up to this day.
Recently I spend 1450 on building my own core i7 PC (my first build) and it was really easy - I have a large 24&quot; monitor, 920 i7 processor, 4870 1GB ATi card, 1TB HDD, 12GB DDR3 ram, Asus P6T Deluxe motherboard, coolermaster M850, Thermaltake Armour case, Creative Titanium X-Fi sound card, Compro Dual DVB-T tv card and Windows Vista 64 bit.
The processor can be overclocked with ease whenever I want to (Although, it's not currently necessary to do so as it is able to run everything well) and I have no problems - when I need more power, I can always upgrade components one at a time at a later stage.
At the end of the day, it depends on your needs - do you want a computer that you can take everywhere, or do you want something with performance that can serve you for many, many years with upgrades?
Since, you are 16, you probably need a computer that you can carry around to do all of your academic studies and some light gaming (not sure about MACs for gaming -never used one before), but this is the rationale that you should use when trying to make a decision - good luck with the choice and remember, whatever you get will only be regarded as the 'best choice' if it is able to serve all of your needs/requirements - hope this helps.
