you could always buy a small netbook, plug the webcam to it.
place the webcam connected to the netbook connected to the router in a house near a window.
start up the webcam.
when you want to view the webcam do a remote desktop connection/protocol (rdp) to the netbook and view it from there.
this is if it's wireless-n. (check specs to make sure you can connect wirelessly 400ft with wifi-n. i'm not 100% sure you can.)
