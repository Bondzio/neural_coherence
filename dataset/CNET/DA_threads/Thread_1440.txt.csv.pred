1.1.1	I connect to the hospital records department through a Nortel VPN ( Contivity ) .	St
1.1.2	All was going well until an update in the client was required by the hospital .	St
1.1.3	It was recommended the the old VPN Client be uninstalled before installing the new .	St
1.1.4	In doing so , there was an incomplete uninstall , leaving two items in device manager which I can not manually delete and which prevent an install of the new VPN .	St
1.1.5	The two items are IPSECSHM ( Nortel ) and WAN Miniport ( ATW ) .	St
1.1.6	Nortel tech support will not assist me , saying that the hospital is responsible and the IT people at the hospital wo n't ( ca n't ) do anything and tell me to just reinstall Windows XP .	St
1.1.7	There has never been as previous VPN client installed on this system which I know is a known issue .	St
1.1.8	Please help !	St
1.1.9	Joe	St
1.2.1	They 'll know what to do about this since they 'll have others with the issue .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks , Bob but I have exhausted that .	St
1.3.2	This is a new issue which they ( the hospital IT people ) have not seen and their answer is to re-install Windows XP .	St
1.3.3	Any other suggestions ?	Ques
1.3.4	Joe	St
1.4.1	Why not run system restore to a previous date , this will get rid of the duplicate .	St
1.4.2	It may be possible to restore the system to a date prior to the first VPN client install .	St
1.4.3	Tommy	St
1.5.1	Type XP REPAIR INSTALL in google.com to see how to do that without a total wipeout .	St
1.5.2	The usual issue are firewalls .	St
1.5.3	But since you do n't have any , that 's not it .	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	Great idea but I tried that also .	St
1.6.2	The System Restore feature will not restore the system to any date prior to the day of infamy ( 9-11-06 ) , even going back each day for two months .	St
1.6.3	Norton Go Back does n't help either .	St
1.6.4	Thanks , Joe	St
1.7.1	I find it hard to believe that NT said & quot ; we ca n't help. & quot ; Usually any IT department can open a ticket with NT and get assistance .	St
1.7.2	In any case here 's what I found online .	St
1.7.3	http : //forums.techguy.org/showthread.php ? t=235959 I have had this problem numerous times in the past where the installation proceeds then ends with the messages : During the installation of the device .	St
1.7.4	The system can not find the file specified and it goes into a detection loop HERE is the solution : Windows 2000/XP has a bug that it can not properly detect new hardware by *.inf files , if the RunOnce registry key is missing for the following location : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion This key is often used by installers to execute post-reboot programs , but sometimes they accidentally delete this key .	St
1.7.5	IMPORTANT : This article contains information about modifying the registry .	St
1.7.6	Make sure that you understand how to backup and restore the registry , in case a problem occurs .	St
1.7.7	Please read the linked Microsoft Knowledge Base article prior to editing the registry .	Sug
1.7.8	Go to Start Run and enter & quot ; regedit. & quot ; Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion With CurrentVersion Highlighted , go to the Edit menu and select New Key Name the key RunOnce , leaving everything else about the key alone .	St
