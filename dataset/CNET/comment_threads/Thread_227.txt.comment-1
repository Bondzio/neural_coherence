g'day, I am a technical neanderthal who is looking to connect my kids xbox360 to xbox live.
Current configuration is single port modem connecting to Apple Airport Express.
Current home wireless network of mix of 2 x PCs and 1 x mac desktops works well.
The issue is whether to get the xbox 360 wireless adapter or connect via ethernet cable.
Have heard that wireless causes lag in live gaming, so looking at wired option.
Xbox is on same room as modem, so no issues there, but given single port, looks like I either need a new modem/router combo or just a router connecting to existing modem, and then connect Airport and xbox ethernet cable to that.
Don't know what is best, so hope you can help.
Cheers
