<s> My colleague bought a Kingston 512MB Extended Memory to install on his ibook. </s>
<s> The ibook detected the memory, and updated the total RAM as 768MB (512 + 256). </s>
<s> Everything seems alright, but after working for a very short while, the ibook will stop responding. </s>
<s> He restarts the ibook, and after a while, the machine &quot;hang&quot; again. </s>
<s> If he removes the 512 memory, the machine will work fine. </s>
<s> Could this be the problem of the RAM? </s>
<s> Or what other reasons can there be? </s>
<s> but you have not mentioned which iBook your colleague has, or what version of the Mac OS it is running. </s>
<s> If, on removing the RAM, the machine functions normally, I would suspect that the RAM was faulty. </s>
<s> Pass on a little more information and we'll go from there. </s>
<s> BTW, most RAM from reputable companies is warranted for life. </s>

<s> RAM sticks don't match on speed... or something else... http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=14870 </s>
<s> Ok thank you very much. </s>
<s> I can't get more information from him as yet because he has travelled overseas. </s>
<s> But I'll ask him to check the RAM speed. </s>
<s> If not, he will probably exchange the RAM. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
