it's time to replace my old sony 200es monitor and i want an lcd in the 17-19&quot; size.
i'm looking for any suggestions as to which ones to lokk towards and which ones to shy away from.
i'll probably stay to the lower or middle of the spectrum pricing, so any help would be appreciated.
mostly used for browsing the web, imaging, and typical home stuff without much if any gaming.
