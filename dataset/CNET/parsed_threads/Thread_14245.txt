<s> Hi all, I'm a self taught (self confessed) computer nerd and have been dabbling in a bit of networking; I recently networked a small Internet cafe. </s>
<s> Been hearing about this IP version 6 and have found loads of papers expalining what it does....... double dutch to me I'm afraid. </s>
<s> What I would like to know is this: if I'm buying a switch, do I have to look out for certain criteria so it can handle IPV6? </s>
<s> if I want to put in an IP address in Windows networking, how can I enter a 128bit IP address? </s>
<s> as I understand it there is no more need for a subnetmask, what else is there to know? </s>
<s> I've been trying to read some of the papers that are available but havent come across anything that's understandable. </s>
<s> Thanks for your time Jimi </s>
<s> Switches don't know about IP addresses. </s>
<s> ty for the quick reply what about routers? </s>
<s> and what about other hardware? </s>
<s> do i have to pay any attention to it or can i just sit back and wait for it to happen? </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> It's a moot point. </s>
<s> And if you had a IPV6 network... </s>
