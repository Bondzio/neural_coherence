hi there: my motherobard is ''p4tsp-d2 that has the following features: up to 3.06ghz(fsb533), 3.6ghz(fsb800) and celeron processor from 2.0 to 2.4ghz 400mhz/533mhz/800mhz system interface speed socket 478 prescott supports from latest mb version 1.3 of p4tsp-d2.
chipset intel 848p/ich5 i have a bisic components in my machine: gforce 5200 series from biostar, 2x256 ddram 400mb .
intel pentium 4 processor 3.0ghz 2 drives one is sata which has my operating system and the other one is parralel ide connection.
my question is this.
i can't seem to hardware components in pci slots.
if i do so for example sound card 24 bit creative the pnp dects it as simple pci connection and then i look and instead of giving me the name of creative whic phisically i added it it give generic 56 sound plaster and question marks.
it really acted funny.
it did to all my pci components.
i even check the cmos setup and altered it and no use.no only that but also i formated my hard drvie and re-installed xp but no to avail.
what could be the problem?
