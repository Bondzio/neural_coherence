many wireless routers can be used as bridges or aps.
you'd need to check your manual to see if yours can do such.
i believe there in information in the forum &quot;sticky&quot; about.
it's often cited as the first place to go before posting questions but i've not read the entirety of it.
a wireless router may be a combination of several devices.
a router which connects to another network, a dhcp server, a switch and a wireless radio can all be integrated into one box.
a router wired router with multiple ports can serve as just a switch.
it's a matter of not using the wan port and turning off the dhcp server function.
what you don't want is two dhcp servers on your network.
