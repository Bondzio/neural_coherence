<s> I have PC's running on XP professional and Vista and I would like to use my Panasonic NV-GS25GN digital Video camera as a webcam. </s>
<s> I need some assistance as how to connect it via USB. </s>
<s> Firstly in order to do anything with a camcorder/pc hook up USB won't fly. </s>
<s> You need a firewire hook up, not sure what the unit has for output, either 4 or 5 pin. </s>
<s> The pc has to have a firewire hook up as well. </s>
<s> Basically it is a matter of getting the right cable and of course your computer having firewire capability. </s>
<s> Could it be used as a web cam, possibly. </s>
<s> Check the unit manual and specifications. </s>
<s> It would be easier, unless you have the hardware, firwire card in computer and proper link cable, to buy a usb web cam, they are cheap and readily available. </s>
<s> Thank you Phil, 01. </s>
<s> The camera is web enabled as this can be set in the camera menu. </s>
<s> 02. </s>
<s> I have obtained the correct Firewire cable. </s>
<s> 03. </s>
<s> 2 of the three PC's I have do have Firewire connections. </s>
<s> I'm surprised that the HP Compaq (The latest purchase) does not have Firewire. </s>
<s> I would have though all new PC's would have this as a standard. </s>
<s> I will give this a try now and see how things work out. </s>
<s> I have been told that using a digital video camera as a webcam provides far superior image compared to the usual webcams on the market. </s>
