1.1.1	I have always had cable with something like a Linksys router with built in firewall.	St
1.1.2	I just bought a Verizon Hotspot Samsung SCH-LC11 to use at a house that I will retire to in the future because it has no cable.	St
1.1.3	The Hotspot has no firewall, of course I have windows firewall on my computers.	St
1.1.4	What I want to know is how good is this to have without a hardware firewall and is there something I should do?	St
1.1.5	Also I bought a WiFiRanger from 3Gstore dot com to use with the Hotspot so I can run ethernet cable to my computers.	St
1.1.6	The WiFiRanger is a router but has no built in hardware firewall but does a router not help by the way it works to make like a firewall in a sense?	St
1.1.7	Looking for advice and just to learn more about the setup I will be using.	St
1.1.8	Thanks sly	St
1.2.1	In a home environment NAT does almost as much to protect you as a firewall.	St
1.2.2	The primary job of a firewall is to prevent unauthorized traffic from getting to your machine.	St
1.2.3	When you have only a single real IP address the router has to be told where to send the traffic.	St
1.2.4	It is smart enough that if you talk to a site on the internet it will allow the traffic to come back in.	St
1.2.5	For traffic that comes in without you asking first the router is stupid and throws it away since it dose not know where to send it.	St
1.2.6	Not a lot different than if you put a rule in the firewall.	St
1.2.7	If you run DMZ type configuration that tells the router to send everything by default to a machine then you need a firewall more since unknown traffic will come into a machine.	St
1.2.8	There are ways to place a hardware firewall in your setup but it gets messy since the WAN link is wireless and you still want to use wireless on your LAN.	St
1.2.9	You could always buy one of the USB things for the verizon and buy a aftermarket router that has a firewall if you really wanted.	Sug
1.2.10	I suspect you will be fine with just the PC firewall, just do not setup the DMZ or port forwarding unless you absolutely need it.	St
1.2.11	Make sure you test this before you commit to a 2 year contract.	St
1.2.12	If you cannot get LTE (4g) coverage in the house it will be very slow compared to anything else you have used.	St
1.2.13	3G coverage is fine for phone surfing but is painful when used with a computer.	St
1.3.1	ok, let me see if I understand.	St
1.3.2	You are saying that if I use the WiFiRanger, since it is a router it will act as a firewall even though it does not have NAT.	St
1.3.3	If I am right nat is what is usually what a router has when they say it has a built in firewall, I can not remember what it stands for but it seems I remember it checks incoming packets or something like that.	St
1.3.4	So if I use the WiFiRanger, I should not worry, right?	St
1.3.5	What about only using the Hotspot, are you saying it is also like a router and gives protection?	St
1.3.6	Sorry just learning about all this, if it seems I am not picking this up quick.	St
1.3.7	Thanks for your reply sly	Polite
1.4.1	I googled NAT and do not fully understand but can see your point.	St
1.4.2	So how would I know if the WiFiRanger has nat if it does not say in its information or are you saying that all routers have nat?	St
1.5.1	All routers pretty much have to run nat.	St
1.5.2	You only have a single real ip address.	St
1.5.3	You may or may not have multiple machines that need to share this address.	St
1.5.4	NAT is the method used to share the address between machines.	St
1.5.5	This sharing is the key to why being stupid protects you much like a firewall.	St
1.5.6	Think of NAT as what happens if you order something and UPS ship it to a large company but don't put the name of the person.	St
1.5.7	All the people share the same address.	St
1.5.8	If the mailroom had a list of packages each person was expecting they could deliver it.	St
1.5.9	If the package was not on the list they don't know who to deliver it to.	St
1.5.10	So if some bad person sends you a UPS package it gets stuck in the mail room.	St
1.5.11	NAT work like that it build a list dynamically of packets to accept.	St
1.5.12	The devices that do not run NAT are called bridges in most cases.... very technically even a router does not always NAT but this happens in commercial setting where you have multiple IP assigned to you.	St
1.6.1	Thank you for the reply and taking time to explain.	St
1.6.2	It makes since what you are saying, that using the WiFiRanger router is all I need to do.	St
1.6.3	What about when you are just using the Hotspot and connect to your computer with wi-fi, does the Hotspot also act as a router as you have explained and would have NAT?	St
1.7.1	Even if you have only a single computer the hotspot assume you might have more so it will run NAT.	St
1.7.2	I think this device can only run as a router.	St
1.7.3	Really the only time you don't have nat involved is for people who plug directly into a cable or DSL MODEM.	St
1.7.4	Still lately even these devices tend to be routers running nat even if they are called modems.	St
1.8.1	You have been great, thanks for all the information.	Polite
1.8.2	sly	St
