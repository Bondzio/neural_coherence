hi virginia, i?m from argentina, so perhaps my english is not so good but i will give it a try.
i have a wd external drive too, more than that, i have two, one for each desktop pc.
one of them had no problems but the other one didn?t work well, it appeared and disappeared, or nothing at all.
after trying with several things (double cables, changing energy setting for usb ports, etc) i changed the &quot;energy source&quot;?
i don?t know if that is the correct word for it, the one that gives energy to all the computer.
after that everything worked fine.
i don?t know why it doesn?t work in your laptops but i do know that it doesn?t work in less than 2.0 usb ports.
i hope this was a little help.
bye and good luck.
fernanda.
