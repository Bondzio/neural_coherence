<s> I have got this LaCie Hard Drive, Design by F.A. </s>
<s> Porsche 160GB USB2.0 Item Number 300700U for quite a while. </s>
<s> My problem is: When i connect the USB to the computer, i can see the drive show in my computer but i could see it in disk management (in control panel). </s>
<s> The disk is spinning when i connect the cable , from what i heard, but i cannot access it. </s>
<s> Can anyone tell me what wrong or is there anyway i can fix it? </s>
<s> Is it because i suddenly unplug it (without safety remove), i assume that it shouldnt be the case these day. </s>
<s> Many thanks </s>
<s> Did you partition and format the drive? </s>
<s> That's required before you can access it and use it. </s>
<s> It may show in disk manager but not in my computer until it's partitioned. </s>
<s> If you partition and do not format, it will show as a drive letter in my computer but you cannot access it until formatting. </s>
<s> Any missing steps here? </s>
