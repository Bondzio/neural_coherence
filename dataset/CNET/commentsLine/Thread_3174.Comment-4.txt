from a 2.4ghz interfering signal like a cordless phone to an ap that has a firmware bug that no one attended to.
here's a widely known one.
we see a lot of complaints now of drops when p2p software is used.
here's a link about why that can cause router/ap issues.
&quot;the default firmware for linksys (and all replacement firmwares except for the latest dd-wrt and hyperwrt thibor) have a severe problem where they track old connections for five days, which causes the router to hang when ...&quot; and this bug has been spotted in access points.
since your system is not well designed or cared for i only can offer commiseration.
