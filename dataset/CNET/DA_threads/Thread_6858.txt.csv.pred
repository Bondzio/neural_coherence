1.1.1	I just built a new Vista Business 64-bit rig , and I have hooked up my HP Photosmart 7960 Series printer to it .	St
1.1.2	Previously , this was hooked up to a XP desktop , and my other XP laptops printed to it fine .	St
1.1.3	Now that I have my Vista rig hooked up to it , my XP laptops ca n't add the printer .	St
1.1.4	When I try to add the printer from the local network , XP says ... & quot ; The server for the & quot ; HP Photosmart 7960 series & quot ; printer does not have the correct printer driver installed .	St
1.1.5	If you want to search for the proper driver , click OK .	St
1.1.6	Otherwise , clock Cancel and contact your network administrator or original equipment manufacturer for the correct printer driver. & quot ; After clicking OK , it asks my to located the file & quot ; *.INF & quot ; .	St
1.1.7	I 've tried inserting the HP disc that came with the printer and location a driver from there , but that does not work either .	St
1.1.8	I 've also tried downloading the latest XP drivers for this printer and installing them on my XP laptop , but that does n't work either .	St
1.1.9	Help , please !	St
1.2.1	I do not own that model printer or have access to one but here 's what I do to get such working .	St
1.2.2	1 .	St
1.2.3	I install the printer driver from HP.com for the printer for the OS in question .	St
1.2.4	2 .	St
1.2.5	Then I can find the printer and use it .	St
1.2.6	& quot ; tried downloading the latest XP drivers for this printer & quot ; Since we need Vista drivers , that seems to be something odd to do .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	I do n't need the Vista drivers ; I downloaded and installed the Vista drivers on the Vista rig , and the printer is working fine on it .	St
1.3.2	The problem is with the XP laptops .	St
1.3.3	I have tried downloading the XP drivers for the printer and installing them on the XP laptops , but then when I try to connect to the printer over the network , I still get that driver message .	St
1.4.1	http : //forums11.itrc.hp.com/service/forums/bizsupport/questionanswer.do ? threadId=1104549 I wo n't rewrite this but the public has been dealt a bad hand here .	St
1.4.2	Let me say that the above link does work and the method of installing the printer driver first then changing the CONNECTION later .	St
1.4.3	If you feel the method you are using must work ( it does n't ! )	St
1.4.4	then you have to deal with HP , Microsoft and a few dead popes .	St
1.4.5	I do n't expect any of those 3 groups to respond .	St
