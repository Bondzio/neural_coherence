1.1.1	I have a 1 TB Fantom drive .	St
1.1.2	200 GB remain , so this thing has a few files I 'd like to save ...	St
1.1.3	I guess problems seemed to start this summer when one of the movies on it skipped so much while watching it that we gave up ( although I 've been able to download and watch TV shows flawlessly ) .	St
1.1.4	Last weekend I decided to put it through a defrag with defraggler that took a good 4 days to complete .	St
1.1.5	I have Vuze on it and download directly to it because I 've had issues with transferring videos and them not working .	St
1.1.6	Now , I went and downloaded a bunch of TV shows from this week that I missed and those came through fine .	St
1.1.7	I go download a couple other files and they stop short of completing with error messages like : & quot ; Error : Disk read error - flush fails , write fails , data error ( cyclic redundancy check ) & quot ; .	Sug
1.1.8	and & quot ; error : resume data save fails : flush fails , write fails , data error ( cyclic redundancy check ) & quot ; Vuze help forums said it 's not a Vuze problem , but a hardware or software problem .	St
1.1.9	Videos currently on my internal HD do play .	St
1.1.10	On their recommendations , I ran CHKDSK ( stopped and quit at 38 % with & quot ; Errors found .	St
1.1.11	CHKDSK can not continue in read-only mode. & quot ; ) Tried deleting all the files from the incompleted downloads , but some refused to go citing & quot ; Error 0x80070091 : The directory is not empty. & quot ; This of course drove me to Google and then the acquisition of Ad-Aware and Spyware Terminator .	St
1.1.12	Both ran and deleted stuff .	St
1.1.13	Now , my external will be recognized , but will not open on 2 different laptops and a linux system .	St
1.1.14	I can try to supply the logs from Ad-Aware and ST if you need .	St
1.1.15	Really appreciate any help .	Polite
1.1.16	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	Things to try : 1 .	Sug
1.2.2	Format the partition ( s ) on that disk .	St
1.2.3	2 .	St
1.2.4	Delete the partitons ( s ) and make new ones in stead .	St
1.2.5	3 .	St
1.2.6	Buy another hard disk .	St
1.2.7	Making a backup of files is MUCH easier when it 's still functioning than after it got fatal hardware errors like this .	St
1.2.8	Now - most likely - you have to pay a data recovery company to do it for you .	St
1.2.9	This is the umptiest proof that external hard disks are n't to be used for STORAGE .	St
1.2.10	Just for a quick COPY of data to transport them to another PC .	St
1.2.11	Or for a second backup copy .	St
1.2.12	Preferably not even as primary backup .	St
1.2.13	Kees	St
1.3.1	So what you 're saying it that the HD is useless and I ca n't fix it while keeping everything on there ?	Ques
1.3.2	Funny you put in that last paragraph as this is the storage sub forum in the hardware forum .	St
1.3.3	What do you recommend for storage ?	Ques
1.3.4	I have a 500gb Fantom drive that I do n't often go back to except for movies and I 've never had a problem with that .	St
1.3.5	Thanks though , I 'm going to look into local places for data recovery .	St
1.4.1	I do n't know if you availed yourself of the top post in this forum titled & quot ; Lost and Found & quot ; where we go over the usual do it yourself solutions .	St
1.4.2	But you are learning the backup problem first hand .	St
1.4.3	That is , & quot ; storage & quot ; is a misnomer .	St
1.4.4	These things must have a backup copy .	St
1.4.5	For example I bought an external then remembered my own admonishments and now have a second one that is synced with the first unit .	St
1.4.6	Wish I could bring myself to really get into the & quot ; true state of backup & quot ; with backup copy number three .	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	I read through the sticky .	St
1.5.2	The only program I thought would really help was Disk Warrior , and that 's only OSX .	St
1.5.3	I think that all the data is still there , but I 'm just unable to access the drive .	St
1.5.4	I have emailed a few local recovery places .	St
1.5.5	One question I have though is that I 'm getting the impression that there is a difference between storage and backup .	St
1.5.6	What works best for each of them ?	Ques
1.5.7	Thanks .	Polite
1.6.1	So to store something we ca n't dismiss the backups .	St
1.6.2	As to the Disk Warrior when it comes to data recovery we ca n't dismiss other common machines and apps .	St
1.6.3	However I have encountered a few die hards that wo n't admit to using other than what they have !	St
1.6.4	bob	St
1.7.1	What should I back my externals up on then ?	Ques
1.7.2	Is there a Disk Warrior for Windows out there ?	Ques
1.7.3	Let me also ask , is the drive salvageable ?	Ques
1.7.4	You know , a data recovery program gets the 800gb worth of files off of it so the drive can be fixed and then put the files right back on .	St
1.7.5	Like it never even happen ... . ?	Ques
1.8.1	The Windows titles are noted in the Lost and Found post in this forum to avoid having to type in those names over and over .	St
1.8.2	To answer your question .	St
1.8.3	We do n't know if salvage is possible till we try .	St
1.8.4	The common tools and methods are discussed often in this forum with methods such as putting the drive in a desktop or another USB case .	St
1.8.5	Some want to know the future .	St
1.8.6	Bob	St
1.9.1	Mounting the drive has been recommended in another forum .	St
1.9.2	Just got a quote from a business that putting the drive in another case would be $ 65 .	St
1.9.3	Should it be a failed drive , what new 1 TB is suggested as a replacement ?	Ques
1.10.1	This is not much harder than changing a light bulb but some folk do need to have such work done for them .	St
1.10.2	There are too many 1TB drives out now so the only ones to avoid are the 39 buck models .	St
1.10.3	Bob	St
1.11.1	I 'd rather have a professional do it than myself .	St
1.11.2	Sets my mind at ease that I 'm paying them to do their job which is to save my data .	St
1.11.3	Any preferred brands ?	Ques
1.11.4	Both of my drives may be Fantom , but I 'm not longer necessarily partial .	St
1.12.1	Well , as I can do this task in a few minutes and know it 's done right where I find professionals to be in a rush on what they think is a trivial task .	St
1.12.2	Take my light bulb example .	St
1.12.3	A pro may think ( and does ) that this is a quick job and will rush through it .	St
1.12.4	There are times we should do this ourselves to avoid a pro from wiping out our data or jumping to the conclusion the drive is dead and then proving it to us .	St
1.12.5	Sorry but this is the lesson I learned years ago .	St
1.12.6	Do it yourself when you can .	St
1.12.7	As to makes , the office has too many from WD , Seagate , and units we popped together in minutes .	St
1.12.8	The ONE THING is that we must do is backup what we ca n't lose .	St
1.12.9	- & gt ; Try this .	St
1.12.10	Go shopping , pick one and ask the forum what they think .	St
1.12.11	Sadly all drives by all makers have failed for someone .	St
1.12.12	Bob	St
1.13.1	If an external is not what you want to store or back stuff up onto , then what is ?	Ques
1.13.2	... and I 'm just not totally comfortable with handling stuff like this .	St
1.14.1	Sorry if I was unclear .	St
1.14.2	ONE COPY no matter what media is unreliable .	St
1.14.3	If you had a second hard drive with a copy , when the first drive failed you would have lost no files .	St
1.14.4	Sorry if I was unclear .	St
1.14.5	You need two or more places when want to keep files around .	St
1.14.6	Bob	St
1.15.1	so when i spring to buy another external , i should in fact by two ?	Ques
1.15.2	buying 2 hard drives makes more sense than the only other thing i could think of-burning to disc .	St
1.16.1	We need no less than 3 copies so when one is lost we never leave the state of backup .	St
1.16.2	Bob	St
