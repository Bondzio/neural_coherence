1.1.1	Hi , guys .	St
1.1.2	I 'm looking for a device that strengthens the wireless signals in the surrounding areas .	St
1.1.3	I would like for my laptop to get stronger wifi signals from computers in the surrounding area .	St
1.1.4	I 've heard that this device is known as a wireless booster or hub ?	Ques
1.1.5	If not , please let me know what its called , and if possible , the best brand .	Sug
1.2.1	There is no best brand here .	St
1.2.2	I 've found other solutions to work better such as a second WAP but here 's the trouble , all this is rather advanced and ca n't be contained in 3 paragraphs .	St
1.2.3	Stores and such do n't seem to want to talk about the products they sell !	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Not sure if this matters but maybe I should mention that there wo n't be a router in the house .	St
1.3.2	We 're moving to a new house and wo n't be setting up our own wireless network for a while .	St
1.3.3	It 'll just be our laptops .	St
1.3.4	We need for our laptops to pick up a broader range of signals than they usually do ( rural area ) .	St
1.3.5	So a repeater should do the trick ?	Ques
1.4.1	If your laptop does n't pick up a signal , the repeater wo n't either .	St
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	Gotcha .	St
1.5.2	So , with only laptops in the house alone & no router , what kind of device would I buy to help strengthen and increase the range of signals picked up on every laptop ?	Ques
1.6.1	So do you even know where you expect to get the internet from .	St
1.6.2	Its not like you can even assume there is a signal to receive much less boost with a repeater .	St
1.6.3	Since security on is the default for wireless its has become much more unlikely you will be able to leach off one of your neighbors .	St
1.6.4	It will be cheapest to have internet installed in the house .	St
1.6.5	Even in the best case you will require a device to take the signal from outside the house where it may be strong enough to receive inside .	St
1.6.6	I am sure if you are willing something will work , 100 ft towers with 1 meter microwave dish can go miles if you are willing to pay for it .	St
1.7.1	The house we 're moving into will only be temporary as we 're transitioning through states and only need somewhere to stay or a few weeks after the closing of our house .	St
1.7.2	We 're not staying at the place long enough to install internet service .	St
1.7.3	We 'd prefer to just search for another signal in the area .	St
1.7.4	I 've stayed there before and have used other signals in the area but the signals are n't strong enough .	St
1.7.5	And now that there will be 3 of us with laptops , the signal needs to be strong so that we can all pick one up .	St
1.7.6	Know what I mean ?	Ques
1.7.7	What do you suggest ?	Ques
1.7.8	Or do you still think its worth it to have a service installed for the 1 month ?	Ques
1.8.1	They key would be to find a usable signal that is not encrypted and is usable in at least part of the house .	St
1.8.2	The first part is hard now that everyone encrypts .	St
1.8.3	So if you can find someplace that a PC will work you can use a extender .	St
1.8.4	Extenders are not magic they just receive the signal and retransmit it .	St
1.8.5	If they can not receive the signal there is nothing to retransmit .	St
1.8.6	If the only place you get signal is say next to a window it just means you can put the extender there rather that sitting with your PC .	St
1.8.7	The do make lots of other thing related to antenna but the cost will most likely not be worth it on a connection that someone may turn off when they go to bed .	St
1.8.8	I would look at a cell data plan .	St
1.8.9	They have prepaid month to month which are not too bad .	St
1.8.10	All depends if you can get coverage .	St
1.8.11	Verizon is running their 4G LTE and it is fast , Sprint/Clear use Wimax and it is almost as fast .	St
1.8.12	Verizon is still too new to have a large selection of hardware .	St
1.8.13	Sprint has small routers as well as the access cards .	St
1.8.14	They also have phones that act as hotspots but I do n't know if you can get those on month to month .	St
1.8.15	If you are not in the 4G coverage areas 3G plans are a option but kinda slow compared to normal broadband .	St
1.8.16	Although tmobile says they have 4G it is the same system Att has had for years .	St
1.9.1	I first used a Sprint Overdrive ( see google . )	St
1.9.2	Later , after Sprint backed out on a discount I swapped it for an Evo 4G which costs about the same .	St
1.9.3	I then used EASYTETHER to get internet access to some laptop and then ICS to a wifi router .	St
1.9.4	This is not an offer to write in detail how to set this up because if someone ca n't make it work with that much detail they wo n't be able to troubleshoot it when it does n't work .	St
1.9.5	I can say it worked great as a stand-in while we waited for our internet connection .	St
