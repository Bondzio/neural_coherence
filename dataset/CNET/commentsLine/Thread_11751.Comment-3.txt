bob, thanks for your feedback.
i agree it should work but if i seem skepticale its because i have read otherwise.
there has been some talk about a glitch with ghost that prevents boot up or log on with the mirrored drive.
something about windows not reconizing the drive letters now that the slave is a master in a different computer.
i guess i will just have to try it to see if it works.
btw can some one recommend an alternative to ghost.
it does not seem get high marks by all.
i will post my findings if anyone is interest.
thanks
