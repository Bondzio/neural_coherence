1.1.1	I plan to retire and travel extensively .	St
1.1.2	I notice that many RV parks have wireless network connections .	St
1.1.3	I have very little knowledge of this technology .	St
1.1.4	What hardware will I need to convert from dial-up to wireless ?	Ques
1.1.5	Will this probably enable me to connect to the Internet in the average RV park ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	All you 'll need is a computer with a wireless network card .	St
1.2.2	It will connect to the wireless network , then you 'll open Intenet Explorer , or Mozilla Firefox ( whatever browser you use ) , and you 'll be on the Internet .	St
1.2.3	You may have to 'tweak ' some settings if your browser is set to always dial your ISP ( dial-up connection ) when opened .	St
