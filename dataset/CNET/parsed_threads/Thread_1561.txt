<s> Hey guys, I purchased a new Seagate 500gb SATAII 7200.10 16mb hard drive. </s>
<s> It's my first time with a SATA drive. </s>
<s> I installed XP on it, everything was working good. </s>
<s> I then went to restart, when I noticed that the pc wont boot all the time with this new hard drive. </s>
<s> Sometimes when I reboot, it'll boot right into windows.. Then, other times when I reboot, on the last page before displaying the windows loading screen, it'll just sit, with the little underscore in the top left corner. </s>
<s> Sometimes I have to reboot 5 times before it'll boot up. </s>
<s> Other times it'll boot up right away. </s>
<s> I do not get any messages or errors, and no weird beeps. </s>
<s> Any idea what I can do to fix this? </s>
<s> It's simple enough to just keep rebooting, but it does become a pain... </s>
<s> Thanks alot!!! </s>

<s> jumper HDD to SATAI ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Not sure..try scanning for bad sectors maybe? </s>
<s> Just throwing ideas out there. </s>
<s> Try maybe a different SATA connector on the mobo and see if that helps. </s>
<s> The jumper was removed, making it SATAII. </s>
<s> I ran SeaTools for Windows, and it passed. </s>
<s> My mobo supports both SATA and II. </s>
<s> I have plugged it into all of the other SATA connectors to make sure, and it still does the same. </s>
<s> Thanks guy.. any other ideas? </s>
<s> If that doesn't work...I'd try setting the HDD back to SATA ...retest. </s>
<s> How current is the MB BIOS ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I have never updated the BIOS. </s>
<s> Should I give it a go? </s>
<s> If so, how does the program for windows by ASUS work for upgrading the BIOS? </s>
<s> I'd prefer to do it that way, then via DOS, or whatever it would be. </s>
<s> Go to the ASUS site and post your question/scenario in the forum for your motherboard. </s>
<s> Much easier to get specific you need there. </s>
<s> I've never used anything other than the DOS version to update a MB BIOS...suggest seeing the BIOS notes for your MB to see if they address the problem you're experiencing. </s>
