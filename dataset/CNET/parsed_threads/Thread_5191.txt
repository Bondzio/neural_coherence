<s> My cousin just graduated with her nursing degree and wanted to clean up her computer. </s>
<s> She backed up all of her pictures and handed over the laptop with all the discs that came with it. </s>
<s> I formatted and installed a fresh new version of Windows XP on it. </s>
<s> It is a Dell Inspiron 600m. </s>
<s> I am at work with it open on my desk here. </s>
<s> I have my own laptop and 2 monitors and one of the network switches is right under my desk. </s>
<s> We also have 2 different wireless signals for just my company alone. </s>
<s> I still cannot get internet. </s>
<s> The laptop worked fine before I re-installed. </s>
<s> I have gone to dell.com and downloaded the drivers, put them on my memory stick, moved them to her laptop and installed them. </s>
<s> The wireless shows the networks available. </s>
<s> I have put in my passwords and it says connected and signal strength excellent. </s>
<s> i clicked on the internet explorer icon and it gave me the connections wizard. </s>
<s> I chose to set up my connection manually and then connect to a network that is always connected or always on. </s>
<s> Still nothing. </s>
<s> No matter what page I get [Internet Explorer could not open the search page] Please help if you have any idea what I can do. </s>
<s> I promised this back by Thanksgiving. </s>
<s> Best, CV </s>
<s> Check the wireless symbol in system notication area for a status like &quot;Limited or no connectivity&quot;. </s>
<s> The symbol changes also. </s>
<s> That has nothing to do with the signal strength, but everything with not being given an IP-address by the wireless DHCP-server. </s>
<s> You can check that with IPCONFIG or, usually, on the router management page. </s>
<s> The usual cause is a non-matching encryption mode or encryption key or the MAC-address not passing the MAC-filtering on the router. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> The most that it changes is from Excellent to Very Good. </s>
<s> I've seen the &quot;limited or no connectivity&quot; before on another computer, but I'm not getting that. </s>
<s> It has also said wireless connection unavailable, but only for a few seconds and then it went back. </s>
<s> I cannot get IPCONFIG to work. </s>
<s> I must be doing it wrong, I'm hitting start&gt;run&gt; then typing IPCONFIG. </s>
<s> I think that I may have the wrong Ethernet Driver. </s>
<s> I am 100% certain that the cable I have hooked up to it is working (it was before.) </s>
<s> There are so many network drivers on the support page for this laptop that I don't know what is right. </s>
<s> Maybe if someone could look at that for me and make suggestions as far as the driver. </s>
<s> I should at least be getting a wired signal. </s>
<s> type IPCONFIG thru Start-Run. </s>
<s> You do it in a command (DOS) window. </s>
<s> If you are testing inside a company, chances are they have MAC filtering or some other wireless security implemented. </s>
<s> Take the laptop to a coffee shop with Wifi or some other hotspot and check there. </s>
<s> You won't get to surf until you have a password but if you reach their login page, you know you have good WLAN connection. </s>
<s> O yes, generally a wired connection works by just plugging in. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work it's most likely a driver problem. </s>
<s> Given what you did, that could be motherboard drivers. </s>
<s> Didn't there come something like a &quot;driver and utilities CD&quot; with the laptop? </s>
<s> I'm afraid your on your own with regard to selecting the right drivers from the manufacturers site. </s>
<s> I once managed it for a Lenovo T30 rather satisfactorily, because everything seems to work except the 'help'-key. </s>
