I just bought a Geforce 8600GT graphics card so that I can play some games, as my current graphics card was too bad to support the games I wanted to play, and someone recommended the 8600GT to me as a graphics card. Can somebody please tell me how to connect graphic card to my PC ? And whether or not I will need to get some other things to connect it, like a cable or something ?

I would hope this card comes with an installation booklet, but two things you'll need to do are to disable any built-in graphics on your mobo or CPU and install the driver that comes with the card. Good luck.

There is no way to &quot;connect&quot; such a card. We do open the case to plug them into the card slot but such install instructions are all over the web so I'm guessing you really are asking how to connect it. Sorry, there is no such system in today's PCs. Bob
