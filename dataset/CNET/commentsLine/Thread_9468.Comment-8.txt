or the difference between the amd x2 6000+ and intel's gpu.&quot; intel doesn't make any gpu (except integrated graphics).
only get an x2 6000+, if you can't afford a $195 3ghz e8400.
the x2 will be slower than any 2.5ghz core2duo.
as for the graphics card, an 8800gtx/768mb is no longer worth its price.
the 8800gts/512 has virtually identical performance for less, and the 8800gt/512 is only a bit slower but still fast enough for most gamers.
