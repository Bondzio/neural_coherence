1.2.1	I see these to be 2 year affairs and this looks like it got 4 years according to it showing up in May , 2009 ( source http : //www.amazon.com/dp/B001ULDAKA ) The HP DJ3520 looks to be it 's replacement for about 70 which is less than I expect a service call to cost .	St
1.2.2	http : //www.amazon.com/Hewlett-Packard-Deskjet-DJ3520-Wireless/dp/B00847V1EA/ ( source ) When I needed a new printer I asked the moderators and a few noted the Canon MX870 and that 's been great .	St
1.2.3	A little heavy and I used the fax once but it 's replacement is the MX922 which my neighbor picked up and they like how easy it was to set up .	St
1.2.4	Link - & gt ; http : //www.amazon.com/Canon-MX922-Wireless-Printer-Scanner/dp/B00AVWKUJS/ Given the cost of service , I do not suggest you have it fixed .	St
1.2.5	Try the usual cleaning and alignment again .	St
