it has 9.2 and i might upgrade to a more recent version someday, or perhaps i will get an additional machine, probably a notebook because too many desktops take up more space, and install os x on something whenever needed....because like i said i haven't used a mac for years and even on an older os i am still having lots of fun on it!!
just wondering how does the heatsink stay on anyways??
is it electromagnetic??
because if there is supposed to be that slimey cooling gel or whatever that stuff is between a processor and heatsink, that stuff is not present.
