<s> Ok I've finally got some money to upgrade my gaming machine!! </s>
<s> Here's what I'm looking at: AMD Athlon 64 X2 4200+(65W) Windsor 2.2GHz 2 x 512KB L2 Cache Socket AM2 Processor DFI LANPARTY UT NF590 SLI-M2R/G Socket AM2 NVIDIA nForce 590 SLI MCP ATX AMD Motherboard SAPPHIRE 100162L Radeon X1300XT 256MB 128-bit GDDR2 PCI Express x16 CrossFire Video Card OCZ Gold 1GB (2 x 512MB) 240-Pin DDR2 SDRAM DDR2 800 (PC2 6400) Dual Channel Kit Desktop Memory Now a few questions, how does the config look? </s>
<s> I plan to upgrade to 2gb of memory later. </s>
<s> One question I have is about dual video cards, this is my first setup like this (always been Intel) and I need to know if buying two of those video cards will give me the advance graphics I'm looking for. </s>
<s> Any help is appreciated as always! </s>
<s> Get 1 stick of 1gb. </s>
<s> It will be easier to upgrade later. </s>
<s> The difference in price is negligible. </s>
<s> I have done many upgrades and I have to say the best upgrades I ever did was to get a better monitor and speakers. </s>
<s> If you are using anything less than 19inches or cheap speakers you will definitly enjoy improving those first. </s>
<s> I know it sounds stupid, but these are investments that are worth it becuase they DONT get outdated. </s>
<s> My next upgrade is going to be a new desk so that I can type easier. </s>
<s> Sometimes whats around the box is more important than whats in it. </s>
<s> first, you've picked a $190 motherboard and saddled it with a low-end CPU. </s>
<s> also, the motherboard supports SLI, but you've chosen a video card that needs crossfire. </s>
<s> and if this is a gaming machine, the x1300xt is barely adequate. </s>
<s> if you're getting your stuff from newegg, that kit totals to $550 (cpu 170 + mobo 190 + graphics 82 + ram 105). </s>
<s> here's a better build sticking with amd. </s>
<s> cpu: athlon64 x2 4600+(65w), $217, http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16819103749 mobo: msi k9n4 sli, $88, http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813130071 (2nd choice: asus m2n-e, $97) graphics: xfx 7900gs extreme, $180 ($30 rebate) http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814150202 ram: ocz gold 1gb kit, $105 $590 ($560 after rebate) gets you a faster CPU, same mobo functionality except firewire, and a video card that at least 3x faster than the x1300xt. </s>
<s> you'll also be able to add another 7900gs in the future but one 7900gs is plenty fast for most games. </s>
<s> here's an intel kit: cpu: core2duo e6400, $222 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16819115004 (2nd choice is e6300 which is mobo: biostar tforce965pt, $107 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813138037 graphics: his x1950pro, $177 ($20 rebate) http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814102034 (2nd choice is xfx 7900gs extreme cited earlier) ram: ocz gold 1gb kit, $105 $611 ($591 after rebate) has the same improvements over your original components. </s>
<s> the extra $30 gets you a faster cpu than the x2 4600+. </s>

<s> see..this is why I ask questions! </s>
<s> I actually changed that confige but didn't post..and wasn't to sure about sli b/c I haven't built one yet..thanks for the tips though..GREATLY appreciated </s>
