<s> I want to buy a printer for photographs and am looking for one which prints pictures no more susceptible to UV light than normal photographs from negatives. </s>
<s> I was told by a professional photographer that Epson has archival quality ink, but I have been unable to verify this. </s>
<s> It would seem that anyone producing archival ink would advertise that fact and I have seen no such advertisements. </s>
<s> Does anyone know where I can look to find this information? </s>

<s> All major printer manufacturers now have archival inks that will last for many years provided you also use archival paper. </s>
<s> For best results, the inks must be matched with the paper. </s>
<s> Ink comes in two basic types; pigment based and dye based. </s>
<s> In general, the latter produces the prettiest pictures, the former is longer lasting. </s>
<s> As I recall the last review I saw, of the major manufacturers inks, Epson was longest lasting, HP second, and Canon third. </s>
<s> But any of their archival inks (coupled with the proper paper) should last more than 20 years, some Epson pigment inks estimated over a hundred. </s>
<s> However, they all are continually making progress in ink technology, and yesterdays comparisons may not be tomorrows. </s>
<s> There are many independent reviews available. </s>
<s> One independent outfit that has many reviews and papers available on their site is: http://wilhelm-research.com/ One recent paper found there that discusses ink longevity is: http://wilhelm-research.com/camera/Will_InkjetPrintsLast_2005.pdf You might Google for other review sites. </s>
<s> Hope this helps Frank </s>
<s> Thank you, Frank. </s>
<s> Your message was very helpful Jim </s>
<s> You have to use &quot;thier method&quot; of best performance to get that. </s>
<s> The achieval ink and paper is of prime cost and while works, isn't IMHO better than true photos. </s>
<s> You can save the digital images and then print on demand which is the better outcome of this side of the fence photos provided you can prolong any digital saving. </s>
<s> The ink and paper are still vulnerable to UV and they still suggest you place in safe enviroment for safe storage and/or placement(wall?) </s>
<s> using frames of glass enclosures in non-direct sunlight. </s>
<s> Gee, what's the point. </s>
<s> They're doing better but it still doesn't come anywhere near true film photos for now. </s>
<s> As for achival ink, those sold as &quot;photo ink/grade&quot; are the achival type. </s>
<s> Make sure the printer supports this and the setting is set for it under its printing modes. </s>

<s> Thank you, Willi </s>
