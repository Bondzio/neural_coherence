<s> Folks: My G5 has suddenly begun generating what I want to describe as &quot;patterned screen garbage&quot; when I start up and/or restart the machine. </s>
<s> This seems to be slightly less intense as the machine warms up. </s>
<s> Sometimes it is so bad that I can't even see the sign-on box. </s>
<s> Other times I can get started and signed on, and matters gradually seem to resolve as I begin running programs. </s>
<s> Hardware details: G5 dual processor, 2 ghz, built 2003; 3 gb ram; Original 30&quot; Apple Cinema LCD display; Radeon 9800 XT, R360 graphics processor. </s>
<s> I ran TechTools once I got the machine up and running, and it found no problems--but of course that was when the video was working. </s>
<s> (I tried to run it when the video was weird, but could not see enough to read the report.) </s>
<s> I also tried to search the web to see if this was a problem, and found nothing. </s>
<s> Have done obvious stuff like checking connections, unplugging peripherals, etc. </s>
<s> My thoughts are that this could be a bad graphics processor, display, or RAM chip. </s>
<s> But I wanted to see if anyone had experience with this kind of off-again-on-again graphics issue, especially on start up and restart. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help, Bill Poole </s>
<s> Sorry - system 10.4.11 Bill </s>
