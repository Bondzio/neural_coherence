<s> I just bought a samsung 940bw monitor but it has wavy lines I find out that this is due to an electrical issue. </s>
<s> I want to know which device would stop this issue? </s>
<s> I have a UPS and a voltage regulator, what else do I need? </s>
<s> I had an identical problem. </s>
<s> For me, it was interference from a cable tv wire that caused it. </s>
<s> I've unplugged the coaxial, and am trying to come up with some other solution. </s>
<s> But I find it strange that a coax-cable (very low voltage, well shielded) can interfere with a monitor cable. </s>
<s> Maybe somebody can explain? </s>
