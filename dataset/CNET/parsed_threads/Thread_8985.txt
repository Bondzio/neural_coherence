<s> I have a seagate external hard drive that was working just fine, then all of a sudden its not on my computer when pluged in. </s>
<s> I check the devices manger and it has a error of 10 - it can't be started, also The mass storage controller has the yellow ? </s>
<s> with the yellow and back &quot;!&quot; with an error of 28. </s>
<s> Any ideas on how to get it running again? </s>
<s> Also when i reboot my comp with the hard drive pluged in it keeps cycling the restart, gets to the windows xp screen then restarts, but if the hard drive isn't plugged in i get no problems, And ideas? </s>
<s> The stuff on the hard drive is important and i need to access it ASAP </s>
<s> hard drives are temporary storage only and they can die at the worst moment. </s>
<s> Do you have backups on optical disk? </s>
<s> If not you can Google data recovery to find a company that might be able to recover your data. </s>
<s> In short, the drive is dead. </s>
<s> There is the off chance that the case has died. </s>
<s> You might try putting the drive into another case or as a slave in your PC. </s>
<s> Did you try another computer? </s>
<s> Do you hear the drive spinning? </s>
<s> Did you try the read USB ports? </s>
<s> It's not lost yet but in your hurry to post you didn't tell all. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sorry, The drive works fine on other computers, and I'm having trouble on all the ports, my usb mouse works fine in the one its in - scared to try to move it. </s>
<s> It gives me the error 10, but on the uub controller I have a error 28- thats whats causing the problem I'm guessing. </s>
<s> Also another thing I noticed is on my computer there are no network connections, even tho I can see my printer on the network and have internet. </s>
<s> But no way to accsess it </s>

<s> Okay sorry I have a gateway laptop, running windows xp sp 2. has the 4 usb 2.0 ports, not sure what else there is, Under device manger Other devices has a yellow &quot;?&quot; then mass storage controller that is under that has a yello&quot;?&quot; with a yellow and black &quot;!&quot; Then at the bottom there is an unknown tab with: 1294 Net Adapter Broadcom 802.11g network adapter - with a yellow &quot;!&quot; blaodcom 802.11g adapter = packet scheduler miniport direct parallel MArvel Yukon 88e8036 pci -e fast ethernet controller Marvel Yukon 99e9036 pic-e fast ethernet controller- packet scheduler miniport WAN Miniport(IP) Wan Miniport (IP)- scheduler miniport WAN Miniport (L2TP) Wan Miniport (PPOE) Wan miniport (PPTP) Also while i am connected to the internet, nothing shows up in my network connections.... </s>
<s> You can change it back if you need to later. </s>
<s> -&gt; Look for &quot;USB LEGACY SUPPORT&quot; and turn that off. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It didn't do anything, so i changed it back, my external is recognized now, but I still have the yellow &quot;?&quot;'s and &quot;!&quot;'s and also nothing in my networks folder.... </s>
<s> As to the network issues, it sounds as if drivers or maybe some firewall like Norton, Mcafee took a dive. </s>
<s> But let's start a new discussion on that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Cool, on the new decsussion, but any idea what the &quot;?&quot;'s mean? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> So today I went to turn on my laptop, and it keeps restarting after the gateway screen, so i unplug my external HD, and it boots up fine. </s>
<s> I plug in my external, and doesn't work, ahve the yellow &quot;?&quot; for it. </s>
<s> any idea's? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The bios has usb set to be bootable. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> There is a corrupt file on the root directory of the usb drive. </s>
<s> You may solve this soon. </s>
<s> If i go in and change that - how would i? </s>
<s> Woud that fix the fact that i cant find the harddrive on my computer when its plugged in? </s>
<s> Reply to the top when we hit the depth limit. </s>
<s> &quot;If i go in and change that - how would i? </s>
<s> Woud that fix the fact that i cant find the harddrive on my computer when its plugged in?&quot; First, you would read your Gateway manual on the BIOS changes. </s>
<s> Next, the drive appears to be still dead or corrupt. </s>
<s> At some point you had it working so that was the time to get your files out and to a safe place. </s>
<s> Scanning your discussion it looks like some motherboard or other driver has gone missing. </s>
<s> Who installed this OS? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> All of the stuff on the External HD Is backed up to where I can get it - Just easier on the external. </s>
<s> As far as installing the OS, That was done by Gateway, Haven't touched it sense i got it. </s>
<s> As for the BIOS changes, I can't seem to find where to go in the BIOS, as I don't have the manual anymore - been about a year now and 2 moves. </s>
<s> Above you wrote an answer to &quot;Look for &quot;USB LEGACY SUPPORT&quot; and turn that off.&quot; that told me you had done that. </s>
<s> Now you claim you don't know how to get into the BIOS... Something's fishy. </s>
<s> The manual is up at gateway.com Bob </s>
<s> Sorry I guess I didn't write it correctly, I did turn off USB LEGAcy SUPPORT, But now in the BIOS Menu, I can't find where to turn off the Boot from USB. </s>
<s> I can't find the option to turn that off anywhere in the BIOS. </s>
<s> Sorry for the mis wording, I will look at the Manual right now, and try to follow it when i get off work in an hour </s>
<s> I went through this discussion twice and couldn't spot the model number of this gateway laptop. </s>
<s> It's very important to give such details in your first entry so that others can fetch the details. </s>
<s> As it is I can't check for a manual or point to a page number, suggest a driver, etc. </s>
<s> But really appericate your help, I have the Gateway MX6440 laptop. </s>
<s> Sometimes I can't find the right words and people don't understand I'm asking for that. </s>
<s> For reference the manual and more is at http://support.gateway.com/s/Mobile/Q106/Blade/1008824nv.shtml I'll be back later when I've read more. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> &quot;If available, change the BIOS settings for the hard drive sequence, making sure the USB device is at the top of the list above all other hard drives. </s>
<s> Not all BIOS Setup Utilities have this option.&quot; I can't find the exact screens for your BIOS so I will not be able to guide you on how to disable the USB boot process. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Bob, I tired to find it but I can't find it in my BIOS, I don't think mine has that option, Also It kept turning off on me in the BIOS, the first time I had about 5 min worth of time to look, then it shut off, i figured i hit something, then Had maybe a mintune, then down to lucky to get 15 seconds before the machine turns its self off, but when I boot to windows its fine... well except the missing wireless and External </s>
<s> Would it be worth it to reinstall windows? </s>
<s> would that fix my problems? </s>
<s> As I don't want to do it but its starting to look like i have no other choice </s>
<s> I've reread this missive and are we still talking about the external hard disk issue? </s>
<s> In the long of it yes, I still can't get the external HD to work on this computer, I also have the problems with my wireless card in the computer. </s>
<s> I have thought that reinstalling windows would set it all to the way it was before any of this started as it would get back to factory settings, I would just need to spend a day or two backing up all my files like music and school work onto DVD's = something I don't really have the time or engery to do. </s>
<s> and that would be a last resort If you can think of anything else, in the other thread you asked If i have norton = i do not for anti virus I use McAfee and AVG with Ad=aware for anti spyware. </s>
<s> I do appericate all your help and willingness to try to help find out what is causeing this </s>
<s> I work at OfficeMax, and was able to get another External - got a Maxtor one touch and have the same problem with it, So its not the drive as the drive works on the other 3 computers I have access to in my house </s>
<s> Have you installed the latest version of that? </s>
<s> I haven't touched anything that says motherboard, as I know thats a big deal to the computer and not knowing a whole lot didn't want to mess up something even worse, I will download the driver tonight and see what it does. </s>
<s> Can a driver just stop working like that? </s>
<s> Let me fish (re-read) your post and I'll see if I can give up a link on the driver I'd install. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It's at http://support.gateway.com/support/drivers/search.asp?st=pn&param=1008824 Before running that, I'd unplug the USB drives and uninstall the USB ports in the device manager. </s>
<s> XP will redetect on the next boot after the driver install. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I tired uninstalling the USB drivers, then reinstalled them, but it changed nothing, just when i started up it asked to search for drivers, and didn't find anything. </s>
<s> &quot;i started up it asked to search for drivers, and didn't find anything.&quot; That means our motherboard drivers are not installed proper. </s>
<s> You can expect a machine in such a state to hang when USB devices are plugged in. </s>
<s> Looking again for another driver package since the gateway one didn't work. </s>
<s> http://www.randomfix.com/2007/02/08/gateway-mx6440-notebook-modem-and-sound-driver-problem/ is damming. </s>
<s> Great scott, they have an unofficial web site with the rest of the drivers. </s>
<s> I'll try one more time before I ask you to call gateway to ask them to give you the secret web site. </s>
<s> http://support.gateway.com/s/Mobile/Q106/Blade/1008824sp2.shtml tells me its the ATI Radeon Xpress 200M Chipset (RS482M). </s>
<s> This driver is at AMD now. </s>
<s> But where? </s>
<s> Try http://findfiles.com/list.php?string=ati_system_drive_mb.zip&size=180256102&db=Mirrors Bob </s>
<s> The driver wasn't installed correctly, I think it just had a hicup when installing, I just did it again and its all working now, just now i still have my 2 little yellow friends in the devices manger, as well as no wireless internet and no External support - one more wrench in the thing - my usb mouse and jump drive work fine, but not the Seagate external.... weird huh? </s>
<s> Well i did it - i reinstalled windows, I got my wireless driver back, but now my external is still not showing up - not its not even in the disk managment. </s>
<s> any idea's? </s>
<s> But maybe I missed something. </s>
<s> I see Vista is now the OS supplied. </s>
<s> Are you using their restore CDs? </s>
<s> My laptop came with XP, So I used their restore CD that came with it - lost all my music, and files - i can get them back but it's just a pain, so its back to factory default as far as i can tell. </s>
<s> It reinstalled everything, as I only had the options of reinstall(destructive) and restore- which said it would save all files but didn't, but it appears to have reinstalled my drivers for my wireless that had the same problem but not the external. </s>
<s> as all my other usb devices that i could find in the house work, But the external works on all the other computers. </s>
<s> I think i'm going to try to use another computer to transfur everything to a new external and try that. </s>
<s> It could be that note about what you installed. </s>
<s> &quot;My laptop came with XP, So I used their restore CD that ..&quot; XP doesn't support over 127GB drives so after a restore to XP I have to get SP1 at minimum installed for big drives to show up. </s>
