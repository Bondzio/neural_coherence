<s> I just got a 500 GB WD my passport essential. </s>
<s> I plugged it in and found that it wasn't what I expected. </s>
<s> It turned out to be a back-up and not a hard drive. </s>
<s> Is there a way to make it act like a regular internal hard drive, you know, drag and drop or just put music or files on it? </s>
<s> I guess this isn't very clear, but I would like help anyways. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> the back up is the software that allows u to back up your computer, u can either opt for it or just ignore and carry on using it as a hard disk. </s>
<s> try formating the hard disk before use if you don't want the back up software. </s>
