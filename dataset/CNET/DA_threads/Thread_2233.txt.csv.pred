1.1.1	I would like input from others on this board who could recommend a good multifunction All-In-One inkjet printer to replace a good one which I used for just over 2 years, an HP 2575 Photosmart All-In-One inkjet printer.	St
1.1.2	I never used the photosmart feature on my 2575 but I did print a lot, made lots of copies on the copier and also used the scanner quite a lot.	St
1.1.3	Recommendations would not have to be limited to another HP machine, it could be another brand of inkjet printer but one which makes good copies of documents on the copier, has a good scanner and can also print out good text documents.	St
1.1.4	Another factor I need to consider is a new printer that won't hit me too hard in the pocketbook when it comes time to replace inkjet cartridges.	St
1.1.5	That's one thing I liked about the HP 2575, it required just 2 cartridges, one for color and one for black, there was an option for a photo cartridge and a grayscale cartridge but I never used those, just the black and the color inkjet cartridges.	St
1.1.6	Some of HP's newer models take a cartridge for every color in the rainbow which I'd like to try and avoid, would rather keep it simple, one black and one color.	St
1.2.1	Today's designs in the consumer range are 2 year affairs.	St
1.2.2	While the price is right you seem to want more.	St
1.2.3	Try this.	St
1.2.4	Go to your local office supply depot and look at the better than consumer allinones.	St
1.2.5	These run from 500 to more bucks and will last more than your typical consumer unit.	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	but here's http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF02a/18972-18972-238444.html?jumpid=re_R295_prodexp/busproducts/printing/color-mfp&psn=printing_and_multifunction/multifunction_and_all-in-one/color_multifunction_and_all-in-one one for any budget (except zero).	St
1.3.2	One upside to buying a cheapo is that you get to repeat every one or two years or soon after the warranty expires	St
1.4.1	We all know this story.	St
