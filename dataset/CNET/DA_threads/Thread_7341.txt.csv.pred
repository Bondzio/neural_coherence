1.1.1	Hi everyone .	St
1.1.2	I 'm getting a little frustrated trying to choose a TV tuner card to put in my computer so I just wanted some advice and suggestions .	St
1.1.3	I 'm not too concerned with watching HD on the pc , just regular TV is fine .	St
1.1.4	It 'll probably be easier to list my questions in bullet format so here goes : - with the looming digital TV switch , what should I look for in a card ?	Ques
1.1.5	- what is the difference between QAM and ATSC ( the two digital formats ) ?	Ques
1.1.6	- my basic understanding of the digital switch is that the broadcast from a cable provider through the caox will be QAM .	St
1.1.7	If I get a QAM tuner , will I be able to just plug in my cable and watch all cable channels ( besides premium and HD of course ) ?	Ques
1.1.8	- i recently saw something that said Windows MC does n't support QAM , so will that keep me from using WMC for my purpose ?	Ques
1.1.9	- please make suggestions as to what cards I should look at .	Sug
1.1.10	Again , all I want to do is install the card in my computer , plug in the cable from the wall , and watch TV .	St
1.1.11	I do n't care about antennas or being able to watch over the air HD .	St
1.1.12	I have Cablevision for a cable provider .	St
1.1.13	Thanks in advance for any help !	St
1.2.1	& quot ; all I want to do is install the card in my computer , plug in the cable from the wall , and watch TV & quot ; Not a single card works like that .	St
1.2.2	Every one of them required drivers , player software and more .	St
1.2.3	Not a single unit would do what you asked .	St
1.2.4	So right there you have found NOTHING ON THE MARKER will do what you asked .	St
1.2.5	The second problem is that some cableco 's are going digital so only they can tell you if it would work .	St
1.2.6	Hint ?	Ques
1.2.7	CABLE CARD !	St
