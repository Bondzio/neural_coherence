Hi, In the very near future, when all the PS3 buzz settles down, I would like to purchase the PS3 unit along with the Gran Turismo HD (as I've invested in steering wheel/pedal hardware in the past).
And to certainly take advantage of the &quot;high definition&quot; output of the PS3 and GT HD, I would need a 1080i display.
But I don't want to invest a couple of grand in a large 40 or 50-inch family room LCD/Plasma display, but instead would like to upgrade my current ViewSonic 17&quot; CRT monitor and get myself a either a standard or a widescreen LCD computer screen.
If that's the case, would I be able to take the HD (HDMI?)
output of the PS3 and display it on the computer LCD screen?
Would there be a conversion with cables/adaptors that I'd have to use?
The PS3 is already a big investment itself, so I'd like to balance it out with a LCD display that would be used for my regular computer games, internet surfing, digital image editing, etc.
Appreciate anyone's feedback!
Paul
