<s> My motherboard took a bad flash a while back, wouldn't post, and didn't have a replaceable bios, so I had to buy a new one *so yeah, it's not like I had the chance to back up everything on my C:/ partition of my hdd*. </s>
<s> I have a Samsung sv1203n and I just bought an Abit AI7. </s>
<s> I'm running Windows XP Pro. </s>
<s> This is my problem: The Abit DOES recognize my hdd when it's set as master, and gives me the ntldr error. </s>
<s> When I tried popping the Windows XP cd in it first of all, didn't detect my other partitions, just my C:/ partition, and to my understanding if it doesn't detect my other 90 something gigs it'll install as if they don't exist and ruin the data that's on them. </s>
<s> Tell me if I'm wrong on this. </s>
<s> Anyways, the second problem is that Windows will not give me a repair option, and will not let me simply install the OS over the top of the OS that's there. </s>
<s> It tells me that the hdd is either corrupted or too full *too full sounds more like it... the entire 30 something gigs is full since I used all the empty space in that partition to back up some data for my boyfriend* and that I have to completely format it to install Windows. </s>
<s> I don't want to loose the data I backed up on it, but I will if I have to *ONLY if I have to*. </s>
<s> I'm mainly worried about the other two partitions on there that Windows isn't detecting. </s>
<s> Now... this is where it gets really wierd... </s>
<s> If I slave it in my boyfriend's computer, the hdd and all the partitions show up. </s>
<s> Right now on my new motherboard I'm using a 10 gig, which has enough space on it for me to move the data from the C:/ partition on my old hdd on to it so I can install Windows on my old hdd. </s>
<s> BUT when I try slaving my old hdd to the 10 gig, it doesn't show up. </s>
<s> The BIOS doesn't even recognize it's there. </s>
<s> I did manage to get Windows to let me install it over the old copy of Windows on the hdd but I STILL get the ntldr error. </s>
<s> It looks like my only choice is to SOMEHOW get my motherboard to recognize my hdd as a slave so I can pull the data off it and reformat. </s>
<s> Can someone PLEASE PLEASE help me out with this? </s>
<s> This is a hardware forum and it appears you've licked that issue. </s>
<s> Now you need to repair install XP or maybe do a parallel install which the XP Forum has more traffic and discussion. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yes you will have problems. </s>
<s> Go to this link and folow what it says. </s>

<s> I even went as far as formatting the hdd. </s>
<s> But when it went to reboot to finish the Windows installation I got the &quot;cannot read drive press ctrl+alt+delete to restart&quot; error. </s>
