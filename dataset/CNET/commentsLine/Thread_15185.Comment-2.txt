i'll write &quot;don't do this.&quot; the compaq bios or motherboard or &quot;box&quot; is unlikely to support such a newer cpu.
but it's a cheap gamble.
i sense you may be second-guessing the need for the new heatsink, but could be wrong.
in short, the new cpu can generate more heat and in that alone a new proper sized heatsink is required.
this also brings up a nagging problem in that compaq may not have fitted the box with a whopper power supply and you may experience hangs and freezes as the new cpu makes a power demand and there is no spare watts.
the case design can also be less than stellar and the extra heat may not find a way out.
simply leaving the cover off may fix that.
