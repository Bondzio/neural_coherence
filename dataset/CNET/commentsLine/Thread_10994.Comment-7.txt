i find it very hard to believe that anyone could &quot;not know&quot; how bad things are...however i do believe that writing directly to the company can help.
since most disatisfied consumers don't take the time to complain in writing, each letter counts for a lot more than just one complaint.
(in government they usually count &quot;10,000 complaints&quot; per letter, since they are assuming that only one in ten-thousand will complain in writing.)
i fully agree that &quot;any company&quot; which provides crappy service should &quot;hear&quot; about it.
call, write letters, send email, write posts in various forums, lodge formal complaints...and keep it up until they either do the right thing or go out of business from lost sales due to loss of reputation.
sincerely, jdm
