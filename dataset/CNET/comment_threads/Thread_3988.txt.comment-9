I put a Linux version on an older pc as a way for me to get a feel for it.
The deeper I get the less I like what I find.
Anything Linux seem to lead to out of step position in terms of game play.
I have not given up on it but at this point I'm working through a 3 inch thick book on.
I had some success with a live CD version but still don't have a comfort point with it.
Have you ever gone to Linuxgames.com?
