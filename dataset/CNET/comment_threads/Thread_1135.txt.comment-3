Sorry about your loss.
Never have only ONE copy of anything stored digitally if at all possible.
I have so many photos that I could not keep them all on my laptop.
Moved them to two different external drives, so there are two copies.
One of the drives is portable and I carry to work each day...just per chance something happens at home.
Next step is to burn to DVDs...over 50 gb of data, so that will be at least 10-12 full DVD-Rs.
But after hearing your story and others, I'm going to spend the time doing just that.
Of course, the DVDs have a shelf life too!
As to Toshiba's liability: I'm afraid that no drive maker eve warranties against loss of data, only the repair/replacement of the hardware.
