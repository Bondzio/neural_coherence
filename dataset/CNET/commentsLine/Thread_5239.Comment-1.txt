i plan on upgrading my 4 year old enpower desktop and i would like to know if there is any way to copy everything from my old pc to the new pc so i can avoid having to re-install all my programs and network software.
i plan on staying with windows xp pro.
i have a very small business and i use my desktop as a server with two other computers in the building as workstations.
