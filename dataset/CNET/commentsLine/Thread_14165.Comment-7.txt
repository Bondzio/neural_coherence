the girlfriend is getting me a psu for my birthday so i should be sweet, probably about a 450w.
that should do the job as i've got another hd i want to put in and there are 6 fans in my case so it does need quite alot of power.
i've also checked tomshardware and i think i'm gonna spend another 30 and get the 9800 pro 128mb, it seems to out perform the 9600xt in all of the benchmarks and the price difference isn't too substancial.
thanks to everyone who's offered advice on this!
