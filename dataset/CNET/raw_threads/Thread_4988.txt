I checked and re-checked the internal connections very carefully. Even after using the &quot;add new hardware&quot; wizard, Windows did not find the new device to install it. However, the wizard is telling me that my system does have a PCI Universal Serial Bus comnnected but that this device is not installed and there is no driver for it. I have failed to find the driver. My questions are: 1) Are these two problems related? 2) Do I need to re-install Windows? 3) Anything else I might try Any help from you boffins out there would be greatly appreciated. Bill Molloy

No need to tell it to install it. Possibly you didn't watch the first boot after instsalling it where windows should have detected the new hardware and installed the drivers with no help from you. Now I may be an idiot and the drive is a USB type, then forget what I said. Simply telling us the model of the drive would mean we would have to search to find out if it was an internal or external drive. pleas include any of that special info in the intial post. Do you have something connected to the USB bus???

To better enter bios area, read your manual or visit your systems support website. Next, recheck cabling, use either master/slave or CS jumpering and if you have dual CDs installed, install accordingly. Now, reboot or boot-up with all those changes, the system should see new h/w and install or ask for whatever is needed. Once done, you *may* need to install any burner s/w or special CD realed s/w to make it a better experience. However, you needn't install any drivers for win98 installed CD drives, it should be OK with native(ATAPI) type drivers provided by windoze. I don't why you have some USB error or attention for that, you need to provide further details, of course make &quot;any cabling&quot; at all it properly seated and ordinated. good luck -----Willy

Did you go into &quot;MY Computer-Properties-Device Manager, and remove old CDrom drive before shutting down and changing to new one? If not, the computer can't add new one. If you are adding a second drive and not changing, disregard this post. Good luck. chuck
