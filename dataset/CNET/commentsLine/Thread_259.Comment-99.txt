you said: &quot;i want to make a complete backup, hopefully without the corrupt file that is causing the problem.&quot; i realize now that may have been a dumb way to put it.
i meant, could i install win on the current hard drive and them copy all of the software to it.
i'm not too bright, but i do know i don't want to repeat the problem that got me to this point.
ah
