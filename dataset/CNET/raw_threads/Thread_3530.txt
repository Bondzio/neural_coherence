I'm a college student and just moved into a new apartment and don't want to pay the high price for the broadband that's available. I have a boyfriend across the street with cheaper and better internet, but the distance is a little over 250 feet. It's a clear path between apartments, minus the brick wall of both buildings. My roomate has a desktop and is unwilling to get a PCI card, wants a USB adapter. I have a laptop with a good wireless card, but it only works with Wireless G & B. I'm looking for the cheapest solution for a router and adapter that would work at the distance without being too finicky. Most people I've talked to said not to waste money on Wireless N, but won't that make the cut range-wise? Are there any good Wireless G rangeboosters out there that would cover the 250 feet without losing all the signal? Thanks

You are at the outer limits of this technology and even the morning mist will interfere and it will become finicky. You can research on google about antennas and more but the bottom line is the distance is over the mark. Bob
