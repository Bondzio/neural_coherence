But after it's gone through a number of cycles called &quot;PASSES&quot;, it will show a problem or not. It cannot 'FIX&quot; anything....it can only tell you if the RAM passes or does not pass all the RAM tests in the system it's installed in. What results do you get from Memtest86+ after three passes ??? VAPCMD

(You'll like the 1024) Turn the power off to the computer and open the cover. Locate the ram and remove the old module by unlatching two small clips. Once you have the old ram in your hand drift it into the trash. Now install the new ram, carefully observing it is located properly (only one way it goes in slot). Reassemble, power up and carry on.

Try one of these: http://www.download.com/3120-20_4-0.html?tg=dl-20&qt=RAM%20optimizer&tag=srch I use one, they work. I'd suggest this one: http://www.download.com/FreeRAM-XP-Pro/3000-2086_4-10516960.html?tag=lst-1 I know, I know, not since the days of DOS, worthless piece of crap, scam, yada, yada, yada. Not every one agrees about Ram optimizers.
