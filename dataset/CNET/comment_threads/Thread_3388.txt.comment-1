I have a Cisco/Linksys EA4500 that supports Wireless-N with simultaneous dual-band 2.4 + 5 GHz as my main router.
I would like to add an additional router to extend the range of my network using this article as a guide: http://www.labnol.org/software/add-router-to-wireless-network/19716/ How sophisticated of a second router do I need?
Do I need one with Wireless-N with simultaneous dual-band 2.4 + 5 GHz?
My main router in use now covers the whole house effectively.
I am just installing the second router in order to have wired ethernet ports in another location.
I figured if I am doing this, I might as well improve the wireless signal around this second location (the basement).
Any recommendations for this second router?
