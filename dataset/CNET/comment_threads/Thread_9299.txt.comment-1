Ive got an external hard drive that I use as a secondary storage.
For some reason when I go to look for my music files and Videos on my hard drive the files are hidden and not accessible.
I have my options set to view hidden files but yet it still is not viewable.
When I go to copy the contents from my desktop hard drive back to the external hard drive, it tells me that the folder and files are already there.
Can anyone tell me why this is happening and how to fix it?
Thanks in advance for any all the help that can be provided.
I am running XP Home.
