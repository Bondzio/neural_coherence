i've just had it about a year but who knows how long since its been made right?
anyway- the on & off cycles are about 1-2 second increments.
for 1-2 seconds the fans come on & then 1-2 seconds- they go off.
i've had it off since this morning & i just plugged it back in & it does the same thing-continuously.
thanks much- any ideas?
