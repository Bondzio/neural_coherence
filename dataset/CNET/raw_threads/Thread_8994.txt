I dont know if im posting this in the right forum but I have being trying to get the wireless on my MSI Wind U100 which is running windows XP to pick up signal, yet it does not seem to want to pick anything up. I have reinstalled the drivers and that didnt change anything. Im using a Thompson st546 connected to the DWL-2100ap. I can pick the wireless up on my laptop so I know its working. Any suggestions would be helpful. Thanks

I find some owners don't want to know this area of the machine but let's try this question and hope you know. Also there are folk that wipe the drive and install some other Windows and don't tell. Do tell the full story. Bob

The wireless adaptor is turned on yes. i turned it on manually without using the FN key as i found that sometimes it does not turn it on properly. I went into the network place and enabled it through that.
