<s> for recording security cameras on your PC? </s>
<s> Sorry, I can't supply the names, but we do it simple with 4, 8 port cards from places like geeks.com newegg.com and some Dell PC for the host. </s>
<s> There are those that make it more complicated, but you wonder why you would build a PC when you don't have to. </s>

<s> http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=SEC800A&cpc=SCH&srm=0 I have an old 2000 computer with 512k. </s>
<s> The computer has at least the minimum needed </s>
<s> That's the card I'm using. </s>
<s> But if I recall you never found closure on your old system. </s>
<s> I can safely bet your machine might have the same issues. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I had turned everything off on it and was just using it for internet. </s>
<s> I want to format the system, reload it and turn off everything but the CD burner and put the video card in for use at work </s>
<s> Today, Microsoft still does not issue an OS that you can't install without most systems requiring you hunting down motherboard and more drivers. </s>
<s> This seems to be what haunted your last attempt. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> What did you think it was? </s>
<s> Do you think I will have a problem? </s>
<s> I shared what I thought it was. </s>
<s> I know it's an issue that not many will run into unless they install these OSes for awhile. </s>
<s> But it's one that can haunt your every attempt. </s>
<s> Oh, since you are looking at the K-World, be aware that one installation paid dearly for not reading the manual. </s>
<s> They didn't notice the exact words and paid up about 1,000 bucks for a tech to come out and show then how to get the video files out. </s>
<s> They were a little incensed about it, but what can you do? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Would installing this card in the win2000 machine be a bad thing? </s>
<s> I know bad is a relative term, but if you say this will not work, I won't do it. </s>
<s> I have other options (analog) </s>
<s> I can't tell if you will be ok given the past issues and that I never could get across what I thought it was. </s>
<s> In short, a roll of the dice for you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I can gamble for $100 and worst case it doesn't work, I still have the card for future use! </s>
