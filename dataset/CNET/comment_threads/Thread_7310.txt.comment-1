I purchased a wireless G network card for my laptop to use on my vacation.
Then I got the bright Idea to get a wireless card for my desktop, just to see if I could get the laptop to talk to the desktop.
but after reading the info that came with the PCI card it seems I can not do that.
I did not try it yet and figure I would ask if it will work before I try it.
Now I have no wireless access point or router or anything on that line just 2 computers with wireless cards.
All I want to do is make sure the card in the Laptop will work while I am away.
Thanks Gene
