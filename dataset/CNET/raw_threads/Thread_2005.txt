My system: Athlon XP 2000, Inno3D 128MB Geforce4 MX440 SE, Motherboard Gigabyte GA-7DXE, 768 MB DDR ram. Whenever i play MOHAA online, when the map is the V2 rocket facility, at some random moment within a few minutes of getting there my computer will go into a restart (with no warning and no blue screen - just reboots itself). I know it is not a problem within the game because it used to work fine, and i also have exactly the same problem when playing the Siege map in the game Elite Force online, and again all the other maps work fine. This problem began to arise after i had visited Windows Update to get the SP1 service pack and all current fixes (for the purposes of trying to fix a problem on another game, Freelancer, which actually did the trick that time). I have updated every driver on my computer, tried switching off anti-virus, firewall and various other programs to no avail. If this rings any bells with anyone out there, i'd appreciate any tips....cheers.

Does it still do it *ONLY* on those maps (even after the SP1 install), or have you tried other maps since the &quot;upgrade&quot;? If that is the case (only those maps) you may want to contact the developer to see if there is any compatability issues with your hardware. Does your system restart ever (like you described) other than in those games (at logon, Net browsing, etc.)? If it does, or every has, you probably have a power problem. You can never have to large of a power supply (and no, if you install a monster 600W power supply, your computer will not use more electricity than if it had a 300W supply, unless your hardware actually needs it). With today's superfast (read power hungry) parts and 2GHz+ processors, you really do need signifcantly more power than was necessary yester-year. The Athlons especially, need more power. You'd be fine with 400W.
