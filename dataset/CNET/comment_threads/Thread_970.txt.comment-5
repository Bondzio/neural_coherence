Had to reformat the drive on another computer.
It appears to degrade any drive that is put in so that eventually it won't even offer to partition it.
I wonder if there is something wrong with the processor or mother board, as I did have some problems with dll files degrading on my a previous hard drive.
I had had three viruses and a worm on that one at one time, and after I cleaned up the drive, it started with dll messages, so I just assumed they were the culprit.
But perhaps there is something more sinister lurking in my computer.
