early 70's i think... i had been a programmer since 1964, and read as much computer stuff as i could get a hold of, so when the imsai kit was announced i had to have it.
my wife was a programmer also which made it easier to justify the high cost of my hobby.
i had been a design engineer in the design labs at ncr working on their early mainframe computers in 1960, so the idea of assembling a kit computer didn't bother me at all.
my imsai 8080 (serial # 17) was a s100 bus machine with an intel 8080 processor.
it initially used front panel switches to load a boot up program in binary form (a real pain), that in turn could access the only i/o device i had at first, a teletype ksr unit.
the kit had 1 memory board with 4 k of ram originally, that i eventually maxed out at 64 k. i eventually added 4 of the 8&quot; double sided floppy disk drives as well as a kit built keyboard, a monochrome monitor, 1200 baud modem, and an anadex dot matrix printer.
this all became a good little machine including digital research's cpm for it's operating system.
i finally built my 1st &quot;pc style&quot; machine with ms dos in 1985, and am still reluctantly in the camp of m$.
every once in a while i'll dip my toe into the linux pond, but i've avoided jumping in, and at 70, i doubt i will.
