<s> Well, it was bound to happen sometime... About 5 months ago, my DVD-rom was incapable of reading DVDs for a short period of time, just as I was trying to show something to someone, but it was apparently just 1 DVD that it had a problem with, and no others. </s>
<s> However, now, first, it couldn't read DVD+Rs (which it formerly could), then it could no longer read anything... CDs or DVDs. </s>
<s> And thats where I am stuck now. </s>
<s> My drive is a MT1316B BDV212B (or so the drivers say) however I know its a 8X, or it was when I bought it many many years ago (BDV tells me it should be a 12x.... go figure). </s>
<s> Anyways, what I mainly wonder is that my friend has a CD/DVD drive cleaner, and it would be great if I could test it out, however my drive is currently incapable of even detecting whether the disk in the drive is a DVD or a CD, and wont allow me to run the program to have it access track 3, where the brushes on the cd are... </s>
<s> Question 1: Is there a program I could use to make the drive spin up and move the lazer around to possibly clean it? </s>
<s> Question 2: Is thereany other suggestions someone might have for possible fixes? </s>
<s> or any possible answers as to why this happened? </s>
<s> I've always used the drive lightly... </s>

<s> There are cleaner kits that you reach in and swap the lens. </s>

<s> I've always used the drive lightly... </s>
<s> I replace the drive since it's a commodity item and repair of those drives are not possible. </s>
<s> No vendor schematics, no spare parts and tech time exceeds the cost of a drive every time. </s>
<s> Some want to fix the drive, but its best to let them figure out that such isn't going to happen. </s>
<s> Usually they rack up phone bills greater than the cost of the new drive before it sinks in. </s>
<s> I hope this reply will hurry your epiphany. </s>
<s> Your story is typical with some DVD type being hard to read and then it degrades further. </s>
<s> The laser loses power and soon nothing works. </s>
<s> Try a cd lens cleaner, new firmware and then change the drive. </s>

<s> Thanks for the info, but as usual, I'm looking away from spendng a single penny on this, and really dont have the money to replace the drive. </s>
<s> Ok, well I lied, I have the money currently but... Dont wanna spend it on a DVD rom drive.... 16x dvd-rom that reads all formats: ~$40-45. </s>
<s> 4x/2x/8x DVD+/-R drive that can make 1.4gb cds - $106 .... </s>
<s> It dont seem worth buying the DVD rom... Will save up for the DVD writer... </s>
<s> The CD Lens Cleaner thing (or swab) is the usual. </s>
<s> I've resurrected 1 drive by finding latest firmware. </s>
<s> But with such a low success rate, I wonder if it should be on &quot;the list.&quot; The cost of having &quot;tech&quot; update the firmware on a DVD-ROM exceeds what you can buy a DVD+/-R/W in just a few weeks. </s>

<s> I use a CD cleaning disk which will play an animated cartoon while cleaning. </s>
<s> That means its cleaning and reading the cartoon and supposely gives a &quot;thumbs-up&quot; in being readable. </s>
<s> Its by Alstop or ALLSOP makers. </s>
<s> The price is less than $8US and available in most stores. </s>
<s> As for the CDs themselves, use a cleaner for them as well. </s>
<s> Greasy or sticky fingers can play havoc overtime so its worth it to get a device that cleans disks. </s>
<s> Plus a can of air to blow out any dust as well. </s>
<s> *NOTE* CD drives no matter what type will fail sooner or later, but a quality drive tends to last longer. </s>
<s> Also, users using a DVD drive to read plain CDs may find getting/replacing a std. </s>
<s> CD drive(read only) so when it fails the cost is cheaper to replace plus you keep the more expensive DVD or CD/RW drives for those tasks alone. </s>
<s> That's my 2-cents -----Willy </s>
