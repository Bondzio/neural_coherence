<s> In another post (sorry I forget where) someone said that is was not a good idea to use packet writing. </s>
<s> I rely on DirectCD for backing up critical files to CD. </s>
<s> It has always been quirky and I often have trouble reading the disks on other computers but I have finally gotten it to work smoothly on the two computers that are most important to me (home and work). </s>
<s> Am I making a mistake here? </s>
<s> What is the best way to back up to CD? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> The long thread covered many aspects of what is UDF or packet writing. </s>
<s> For some, it's less than reliable. </s>
<s> And if it is reliable all I have ever needed to do is to wait for it to eventually hiccup for those that never had an issue. </s>
<s> Which is why I simply erase a CDRW (now DVDRW), record what I want and treat it like a CDR or DVDR... Bob </s>
<s> why do you say &quot;not a DVDRW&quot;? </s>
<s> I am planning to buy a new notebook soon and hope to use the DVDRW for storage. </s>
<s> Is this a bad idea? </s>
<s> But not with any InCD/DirectCD package. </s>
<s> I don't trust it. </s>
<s> This is not to write it doesn't work, but in my experience it works about 99.9% of the time. </s>
<s> Which is not good enough. </s>

<s> So how do you use your DVDRW? </s>
<s> For critical backups (my critical office files) do you think this is your best option on a daily basis? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I collect my backup in a directory, erase the DVDRW, then record my files to it. </s>

<s> .......And you find that they are reliably read on other computers? </s>
<s> What software are you using? </s>
<s> &quot;.And you find that they are reliably read on other computers? </s>
<s> What software are you using?&quot; You didn't write about use with other computers. </s>
<s> That issue pans InCD/DirectCD and is its biggest weakness. </s>
<s> When I use the simple erase and record (as if it's a CDR or DVDR), then most other machines see if as I need it to be. </s>
<s> That's a new question about compatibility issues with InCD/DirectCD. </s>
<s> The answer is that you get to test for such. </s>
<s> I don't have to test since I do not use InCD/DirectCD or such. </s>
<s> ---------------------- Today I use Nero, CDBurnerXP, Roxio, Easy CD, and K3b to create my CD and DVDs. </s>
<s> For video work I have other titles I use, but that was not the topic. </s>
