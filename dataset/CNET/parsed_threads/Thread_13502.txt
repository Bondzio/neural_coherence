<s> I am going on vacation and low battery signal is starting to sound . </s>
<s> Will it be ok for 3 weeks or do I need to have battery changed? </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> Some machines required us to set the BIOS settings exactly so. </s>
<s> Over the years I found this to be trouble and try to use the stock settings to avoid a future problem. </s>
<s> So the answer here is &quot;should be fine&quot; with the added answer of &quot;it depends&quot; on if this machine has a BIOS setting other than defaults that you depend on. </s>

<s> But since you've got the warning and time permits ... why not replace it ? </s>
<s> The CMOS battery is usually a CR2032 and they're relatively easy to replace if you follow the PC battery replacement instructions. </s>

<s> Is there any bad effect if your not going to replace the battery? </s>
