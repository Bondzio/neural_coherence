You are correct.
The desktop model is: Gateway Select 1200 PC AMD Athlon 1200MHz Purchased Aug. 2001 (I know, overdue for a new system) The link and enlarged view of the motherboard does not resemble my computer.
The slot that I had interest on was used by a 56K PCI Modem.
I do not need a modem since I use broadband connection -Comcast- to access the Internet.
My interest on identifying the slot is because I am in need of a PCI slot to set a USB 2.0 PCI card.
The PCI Modem slot is a short size slot so based on the comments, this slot must be a PCI slot.
I can only thank everybody that provided suggestions and when I receive the NEC USB 2.0 PCI card, I will know for sure if it works.
