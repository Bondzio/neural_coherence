Nope, both Maxtor drives are identical and one was working beautifully as my permanent second drive.
Then one day came the dreaded knocking sound.
I noticed I was getting the error message on bootup and swapped the drive for the second one.
No knocking sound, but though the disk IS recognized in the bios, I still get the same error message.
I'm beginning to believe it may be a MB problem.
I may just have to get a massive single drive or swap to the more modern SATA drives.
But if it's a MB problem, I may be playing with fire.
Any other recommendations?
Thanks!
