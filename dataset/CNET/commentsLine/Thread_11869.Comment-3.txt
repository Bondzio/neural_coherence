i'm just a bit gun shy.
when i boght my pre-intel pb i was assured by the apple store staff that it would be fast and able to run windows, etc.
it turned out not to be the case, or at least not as fast as they led me to believe but i wound up loving it anyway.
now that i'm ready to upgrade i want to do what i planned last time.
i have read that win runs great on the new 'properly equped' macs so i just want to make sure i make the right choice this time.
