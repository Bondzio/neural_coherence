with real thin/sharp test leads, you can probe the voltages from the rear of the molex connector on the mobo from the power supply.
the voltages of interest are the main 5 volts, the 3.3 volts, and the +12 volts.
the minus voltages are of no interest.
the 5 volt standby voltage should be there anytime that the power supply is plugged into a live outlet [and the switch on the rear of the supply is on].
this voltage is what allows the logic circuits to turn on the main voltages by a momentary contact power switch.
i'm accusing you of being a human being, lol and 30 plus years of troubleshooting taught me that 95% of the time the trouble was caused by a human being having been working inside the equipment.
first simply recheck evcery possible connection et al that might have gotten disturbed whether intended or not.
btw, i include myself as a human being that can screw things up unintentionally.
