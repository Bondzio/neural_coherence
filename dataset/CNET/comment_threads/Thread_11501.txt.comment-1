I have a laptop that contains important information and a few older computers.
I want to standardize all computers with the same operating system, software, and files.
I want complete consistency with all computers.
These are all personal machines.
I have Norton Ghost but am not familiar with it.
How do I migrate disk images or my laptop's information for other computers, so they are all the same?
