1.1.4	A few times while changing out ram i got a boot screen indicating a change in memory , but then it would freeze again .	St

1.1.9	If i have the keyboard plugged in it will light up at the very first moment of powering up , but even after several minutes it will not respond .	St
1.1.10	So a assume its a motherboard/processor problem .	St
1.1.11	I was wondering what things i can do to troubleshoot .	St
1.1.12	Im actually okay with one of them being a problem , because ive been meaning to replace them .	St
1.1.13	but i would like to be sure that would fix it first .	St
1.1.14	thanks for any help ...	Polite
1.2.1	But that symptom is consistent with the BAD CAPS plague ( google BAD CAPS . )	St
1.2.2	Not only you but a lot of members are leaving out details which makes any reply just a bad guess .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I 'll look in to that .	St
1.3.2	In the mean time , what other details should I include ?	Ques
1.4.1	Watch as you post for the words in red .	St
1.5.1	I 'm running windows xp pro sp2 .	St
1.5.2	I have a pentium4 ( 3 ghz I think ) .	St
1.5.3	Motherboard - intel d915gav .	St
1.5.4	2 512 600mhz corsair memory sticks .	St
1.5.5	Ati x1050 pcie video card .	St
1.5.6	Westerndigital 80gb hdd .	St
1.5.7	And corsair hx520w psu .	St
1.5.8	I 've been testing all my components in another computer .	St
1.5.9	Everything seems fine psu , ram , video card , hard drive .	St
1.5.10	And I 've tried the ram and psu from the other computer and I get the same results .	St
1.5.11	When I put the other computers ram in my computer I did again manage to get the motherboard boot screen telling me about the change in ram .	St
1.5.12	But it froze again at this point .	St
1.5.13	And I ca n't get that screen back again .	St
1.5.14	I 've gotten it about 3 times out of at least 40 or 50 boot ups .	St
1.5.15	If I 've got a case of bad caps , it 's not apparant .	St
1.5.16	Everything looks okay and no smells .	St
1.5.17	But from what I read that does n't rule it out .	St
1.6.1	The symptoms are consistent with bad caps , missing heatsink compound and just bad boards .	St
1.6.2	But remember there were never any diagnostics to test it down to the board so we use the story and inspect the caps to give our diagnosis the best results .	St
1.6.3	Sounds like a bum board .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
