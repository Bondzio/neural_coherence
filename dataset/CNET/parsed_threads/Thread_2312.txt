<s> How can I tell what expansion card slot is PCI or other type? </s>
<s> The computer documentation does not identify the type. </s>
<s> Using Win XP Pro, is there a utility to display the built-in slots types? </s>

<s> My configuration is in the Profile. </s>

<s> http://usa.asus.com/products4.aspx?l1=3&l2=15&l3=0&model=744&modelmenu=1 Most of today's MBs have two types of slots ...PCI and PCIe....the PCI slots are most commonly white...the PCIe slots vary in color depending on MFG. </s>
<s> In the older PCs...also had ISA (usually black) and AGP slots...usually (AGP). </s>
<s> Regards VAPCMD </s>
<s> You are correct. </s>
<s> The desktop model is: Gateway Select 1200 PC AMD Athlon 1200MHz Purchased Aug. 2001 (I know, overdue for a new system) The link and enlarged view of the motherboard does not resemble my computer. </s>
<s> The slot that I had interest on was used by a 56K PCI Modem. </s>
<s> I do not need a modem since I use broadband connection -Comcast- to access the Internet. </s>
<s> My interest on identifying the slot is because I am in need of a PCI slot to set a USB 2.0 PCI card. </s>
<s> The PCI Modem slot is a short size slot so based on the comments, this slot must be a PCI slot. </s>
<s> I can only thank everybody that provided suggestions and when I receive the NEC USB 2.0 PCI card, I will know for sure if it works. </s>
<s> go to Control Panel then double click system. </s>
<s> Then the hardware tab, click device manager. </s>
<s> Then click system devices, in there is a list of all the devices for example my one says things like ''PCI express port - 2581'' something along thos lines is what you are looking for. </s>
<s> This is the only way I know of other than looking at it and being able to tell the difference. </s>
<s> pretty sure you're on the right track ! </s>
<s> Years ago there were MBs with very short slots for specialized periperhals ...modems was one of those items. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS...Tried to find the model number you posted on the GATEWAY site (support) but no such luck. </s>
<s> Was looking for a MB diagram. </s>
<s> The light grey color and the size of the slot made it easy to identify. </s>
<s> The new NEC USB 2 PCI card fit easily and it came up right away. </s>
<s> Unlike the other that I purchased from Worldstart, this one came with a mini-CD and simple explanations. </s>
<s> I am still waiting for Worldstart justification as to why their card did not come with a CD or why it did not work. </s>
<s> Last time I bite their hook. </s>
<s> Cheap come on did me in. </s>
