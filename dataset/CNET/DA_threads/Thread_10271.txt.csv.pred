1.1.1	Hello , I 'm having a heck of a time trying to find myself a UDMA mode-6 enabled motherboard to run SSD .	St
1.1.2	Unfortunately , I can not find the UDMA mode listed on many motherboard specification sheets .	St
1.1.3	Asus recommened that I check out the P9X79 motherboard .	St
1.1.4	Currently , I am running a Asus P7P55D-E LX which is listed as having 2x 6/Gbs SATA ports .	St
1.1.5	However , UDMA 6 enabled SSD 's are only being run @ UDMA 5 ... Any tips on UDMA mode-6 motherboards would be great .	St
1.1.6	I am willing to go with AMD or Intel ( preferably Intel ) CPUs along with it .	St
1.1.7	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	So it appears UDMA 6 or ATA133 is legacy .	St
1.2.2	That is , you catch that where you can but it 's gone .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Not sure I 'm following you on this one Proffitt	St
1.4.1	You lead off with UDMA 6 or ATA-133 which is about IDE ports .	St
1.4.2	Since new boards may not have said port , trouble .	St
1.4.3	Why ca n't you use the newer SATA ports and get a SSD on SATA connections ?	Ques
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	Given that a BIOS can emulate IDE ( the drive is still SATA ) folk may elect to use this emulation and get lost trying to up the UDMA mode when it 's all an emulation .	St
1.5.2	Skip all this and set the SATA to AHCI without the emulation and we can chat about SATA speeds .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	The issue is that a 6.0 Gb/s SATA port is & quot ; supposed & quot ; to read @ 400+ mb/s .	St
1.6.2	If I 'm not mistaken , when the SSD is running in UDMA 5-mode , the read/write speed is not testing @ it 's full ability .	St
1.7.1	I follow you on this , unfortunately , when AHCI mode is enabled , the PC gets on an endless cycle of boot and reboot while BSODIng on the windows logo	St
1.8.1	Enabled AHCI mode , computer booted up fine , read/write speeds seem to still be & quot ; slower & quot ; than advertised	St
1.9.1	I found SSD to be treacherous in that not only the drive firmware must be current , but many machines require Intel 's RST app to hit full steam .	St
1.9.2	Then again , the SSD maker can change the software to be more safe at the cost of some speed .	St
1.9.3	And finally we have the problem of laboratory conditions .	St
1.9.4	One poor soul had that CRACKED WINDOWS 7 and never could fix it .	St
1.9.5	Our theory is the crack wrecked havoc with the system .	St
1.9.6	And since we could get full speed from our install they were pissed at everyone about & quot ; what carp is this , why ca n't you fix my system ? & quot ; They were treated as nicely as possible but that OS meant we could never tackle that system .	St
1.9.7	Bob	St
1.10.1	Many forget the extra bytes in the packets flying around .	Sug
1.10.2	This is why you want to talk to the maker 's support of your machine and see what they think .	St
