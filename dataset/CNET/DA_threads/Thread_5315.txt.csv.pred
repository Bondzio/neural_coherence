1.1.1	I need a computer for mostly word processing and web browsing.	St
1.1.2	I'm considering getting a netbook and docking it to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse so when I do need to carry my computer, it's not a problem.	St
1.1.3	My concern is the computer performance.	St
1.1.4	Do netbooks get slow after some time?	St
1.2.1	It's a run of the mill 8.9 inch unit.	St
1.2.2	Be aware that Windows seems to slow over time so it's not a Netbook issue.	St
1.3.1	A netbook with Windows 7 would fit your needs quite well.	St
1.3.2	I would highly recommend getting a full size keyboard as you seem to have planned on.	St
1.3.3	Small Keyboards= pain to type on for long periods of time.	St
1.3.4	Also, if you are mostly working with Word like documents, it is easy to just save them online.	St
