First, I use laptops.
I don't even own a desktop PC.
Second, I just don't have that much data to store.
About the only data I keep are photos.
I burn them to a DVD.
They are much easier to store and use.
I could use an old hard drive as an external drive but I don't even use the portable external hard drive I already have.
