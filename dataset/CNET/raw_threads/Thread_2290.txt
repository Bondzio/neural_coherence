First I've installed the program and followed the instructions and then plug in the 2 device one is near the router the other one is upstairs. When I open up the utility program it's scanning but not detecting the device. I went into the privacy tab and added my own personal network. I went into my router's configuration and added by hand the powerline's mac address and it still doesn't see it. I try adding the device by hand naming it typing in the password and I get &quot;Unable to set the NMK of remote device&quot; what do I do now I need help thanks
