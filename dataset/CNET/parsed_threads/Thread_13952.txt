<s> I built a pc last year and recently activated windows xp pro on it. </s>
<s> AMD athlon 4000+ 2.4 ghz bfg tech geforce 7800gt oc'ed 37 Gb WD-Raptor 10,000 rpm radmax case with 420W power supply Corsair XMS 4x 512mb ram (2gb total) DVD drive LG Chaintech Nvidia Nforce4 motherboard socket 939 Samsung 19&quot; widescreen lcd monitor windows vista certified I activated windows and this pc boots up really fast. </s>
<s> But it will run for about 2-3 minutes then it will freeze the OS except for the mouse that can't click and open any applications, then I have to pull the plug. </s>
<s> It's not overheated and it stalls??? </s>
<s> And I'm not getting any internet on it either, it's not the ISP though because I'm using a different pc on the same ethernet jack it the pc runs fine. </s>
<s> When it ran the first time I could run counter strike source at 170 fps. </s>
<s> How does a computer like this keep locking up on me? </s>
<s> Try it with just 2 sticks of RAM and the case cover off to let it cool to the max. </s>
<s> Some build their own and forget heatsink compound or the entire heatsink. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'll give it a shot but the thing usually locks up before it even heats up at all. </s>
<s> The heatsink had a little patch on the bottom that felt like thin gooey stuff so I assumed that it was. </s>
<s> It only runs at 36-37 celcius. </s>
<s> All bets are off when overclocking. </s>
<s> Start with stock settings first. </s>
<s> My apologies for missing the overclocked item. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It's factory Overclocked out of the box. </s>
<s> even it doesn't even get that hot. </s>
<s> Sorry but I didn't know that. </s>
<s> Another avenue to explore is BIOS and driver updates from the motherboard maker. </s>
<s> This has paid off for me as well. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> two sticks of ram and it still locked up. </s>
<s> could it have anything to do with the hard drive? </s>
<s> Why is the hard disk suspect? </s>
<s> If so try the hard disk makers disk test software. </s>
<s> Keep the cover off for now. </s>
<s> Also, a complete list of what was running at the time of the crash (use TASKLIST) would be nice as well as a short story about all the lovely drivers you installed after you were done with the Windows CD. </s>
<s> As well share that all the fans are spinning. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Its a weird situation. </s>
<s> It crashes when I hardly open anything. </s>
<s> Something as simple as Windows media player and Internet explorer casue it to crash. </s>
<s> I'd try to system restore but the damn thing crashes in the middle of shutting down. </s>
<s> I guess I'll have to take it to a store. </s>
<s> This sounds like a major issue. </s>
<s> I would go back to where you got your MOBO and either get it exchanged or better yet try a different manufactuerer. </s>
<s> I checked out the Chaintech page and I cannot get ANY info on their motherboards. </s>
<s> Plus their site is incredibly slow. </s>
