Now mkv video or any high quality video is not playing continuously and CPU used is more than 90%. Even if i switched back to 512 MB RAM , Problem is there. Could anybody suggest anything please?

Normally, system idle (the system doing nothing) should be above 80% if all you do is looking video, I think. The video program shouldn't need more than 20%. But I don't see any video viewing program in the list. Remarkable: with system idle on top of the list it's nearly impossible that the CPU is being used for more than 90% by other processes. That leaves less than 10% for system idle, and it's hardly imaginable it's on the top of the list than. Maybe tell more? What I should do: - switch the hard disk you're reading the video-file from from DMA to PIO mode, reboot, switch it back again to DMA-mode and reboot again. That's done in Device Manager. If that doesn't help: - clean install of the OS - try again to view a video you already have on your harddisk (copy it to USB-stick first, because the clean install will format the hard disk); disconnect from Internet until then - stay away from torrents in the future Kees
