1.1.1	I just moved a desktop computer from one part of the house to another part of the house and the surge protector that I have will not allow me to plug everything I need to plug into it.	St
1.1.2	I have a Westell DSL modem that has a 9v adapter which takes up one outlet and part of another one, my Linksys wireless router also has a 9v adapter which takes up another outlet and covers part of the next one to it as well.	St
1.1.3	I also need an outlet for my computer's tower, my computer's monitor, one for my inkjet printer and another one for my telephone/fax machine.	St
1.1.4	I'm short 2 outlets because of the power plugs for my modem and my router covering parts of other outlets.	St
1.1.5	Does any company make a good surge protector with 10 or more outlets?	St
1.1.6	Everything I have looked at online tonight has 6 to no more than 8 outlets.	St
1.1.7	I could lose the fax machine but I need an extra outlet to plug my HP inkjet printer into.	Sug
1.1.8	Feedback appreciated.	St
1.2.1	There are short 3-prong cords which in effect are &quot;flexible cords&quot; that allow whatever not to directly be plugged-in at an outlet.	St
1.2.2	Thus with these being used you can plug-in the small cord and then whatever in order to free up the actual power strip outlets.	St
1.2.3	http://www.trianglecables.com/expowcab.html The aove link should give an example, you can google or try you favorite vendor, look for AC items.	Sug
1.2.4	tada -----Willy	St
1.3.1	So I could buy 2 of the shortest cords, connect them to the 2 9v adapters to fee up the space on the surge protector?	Sug
1.3.2	That would work?	St
1.3.3	Thanks for the link.	St
1.4.1	Here is another vendor that sells such short cords or cables if you will.	St
1.4.2	Look at the cable and adapter section.	St
1.4.3	Again, popular online sites should offer similar products.	St
1.4.4	Its possible a local vendor does as well.	St
1.4.5	-----Willy http://www.cyberguys.com	St
1.5.1	You're well off to get one.	St
1.5.2	It will have several outlets.	St
1.5.3	I wouldn't want to put everything on one power strip without adding up total wattage to make sure you're well within the capacity of that circuit.	St
1.5.4	Remember that a 15A duplex outlets doesn't mean 15 amps per connection but 15 amps sum total for both.	St
1.5.5	Ones like this http://www.apc.com/products/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm?base_sku=P8T3 will allow for some of the awkward brick type AC-DC converters.	St
1.5.6	I'd go with surge protection for less critical components and a UPS for your PC, monitor, external HDs, etc.	St
1.5.7	and plug the surge protector into a separate outlet.	St
1.6.1	No I don't have one of those, thanks for the post.	Polite
1.7.1	I did click on that link, clicked on Cables & Adapters and the pull down list was long.	St
1.7.2	Which specific item in that pull down list do I need to click on to see what I need?	St
1.7.3	Thanks for the link.	St
1.8.1	Literally a short AC cable like in as an extension cord, only short.	St
1.8.2	http://www.cyberguys.com/product-details/?productid=1738 That one is 6ft, but the more expensive one is the flat type.	St
1.8.3	Just be sure the ends are std.	St
1.8.4	AC type.	St
1.8.5	Other vendors may offer 12in.-18in.	St
1.8.6	versions, google away.	St
1.8.7	-----Willy	St
1.9.1	So I could unplug the 2 9v adapters from my surge protector, connect one of these 6' cables to each one and plug the 2 new 6' cables into my surge protector freeing up additional outlets which were covered up by the 9v adapters?	St
1.9.2	Would that work?	St
1.9.3	Thanks for the link.	St
1.10.1	I looked in my bedroom closet last night after thinking I purchased a UPS back-up device years ago when I got my first desktop computer back in 1998, a Windows 95 machine.	St
1.10.2	I did find a box labeled APC Back-UPS Office Model No.	St
1.10.3	BF 250, it's never been used, opened only once to check it out, the thing is heavy, the specs on the back of the box says it ways 8.1 pounds and I wouldn't doubt it and it's big too which is probably why I didn't use it because it would have taken up too much room behind my desk.	St
1.10.4	I Googled it and read it's been discontinued.	St
1.10.5	I don't know if it has a battery in it but if it does it's probably no good.	St
1.10.6	I did look behind my desk, there are 2 electrical outlets, one which is the original one which was in the room when this house was built back in 1962 is not a grounded outlet, the other one which I labeled &quot;grounded&quot; I had a licensed electrician install in the room soon after I got the first computer back in 1998, the one outlet labeled grounded is on a dedicated 15 amp circuit.	St
1.10.7	I guess I could plug my fax machine and HP printer into the other outlet which unfortunately is not grounded, I'd rather have everything plugged into something that would be grounded if I could.	Sug
1.10.8	Here's what I have that needs to be plugged into a grounded electrical outlet right now.	St
1.10.9	Dell Dimension 3100 desktop PC computer tower Linksys WRT54G wireless router-has a 9v brick AT&T Westel DSL modem-has a 9v brick Panasonic plain paper fax machine KDS 17&quot; flat screen CRT color monitor Hewlett Packard Photosmart All-In-One C5280 inkjet printer Panasonic 5.8Ghz cordless phone I also have a phone jack behind my desk which has 2 phone jacks, at one time I had 2 separate phone lines in the house but once my parents passed away I disconnected their phone line so I now have just the one phone line in the house and DSL.	St
1.10.10	Where I have the red DSL modular line coming out of the wall jack and connected to the back of the DSL modem, a DSL filter is on the line to eliminate static, could I install one of those adapters which plugs into a phone jack, a splitter, run the red cable out of one side of the splitter and run another phone line out of the other side of the splitter to power my phone/fax machine?	St
1.10.11	DSL filters would be on both as they are on all of my phone jacks in the house.	St
1.10.12	Could I do that or would the phone/fax line being located so close to the DSL red line cause my DSL interference or any other problems like cause my DSL speed to be lowered?	St
1.10.13	Right now I have the red DSL line plugged into one jack on the plate and my Panasonic 5.8Ghz cordless phone plugged into the other plug in on the jack.	St
1.10.14	My wall jack has modular plug ins side by side, if they were instead one over the other I could probably make it work.	St
1.10.15	Have a splitter plugged into the modular plug on top with DSL and fax coming out of it and plug my cordless phone into the lower single modular plug.	St
1.10.16	I'll get it figured out eventually if I can figure a way to plug in everything that I have into a device that I can plug into my one grounded outlet behind my desk and not plug anything else into the other non-grounded outlet.	St
1.11.1	Would this be a good one?	Polite
1.11.2	It has 10 outlets.	St
1.11.3	http://www.apc.com/products/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm?base_sku=BE750G&total_watts=200	St
1.12.1	I can't read the silkscreen but it appears to have some outlets battery backed and some not.	St
1.12.2	That's fine.	St
1.12.3	Your other message said you have a non-grounded outlet.	St
1.12.4	Any of your peripherals or power supply adapters that have only 2 prongs can make use of that.	St
1.12.5	I can't help with DSL jacks.	St
1.12.6	Sorry.	St
1.13.1	http://www.trianglecables.com/20561.html VAPCMD	St
1.14.1	As I stated, they do come shorter from other vendors.	St
1.14.2	The whole idea is to free-up the power strip/area.	St
1.14.3	-----Willy	St
1.15.1	Those might work, plug one of those into each of the 2 power bricks hogging up space on my surge protector and they would free up extra space so I could plug in 2 other items.	St
1.15.2	Have you ever bought from that company?	St
1.15.3	Do they ship out a good product?	St
1.15.4	Do they have good customer service in case there would be a problem with my order?	St
1.16.1	So if my HP printer had a 2 prong plug I could plug it into the other electrical outlet which is &quot;ungrounded&quot;?	St
1.16.2	My Panasonic fax machine unfortunately has a 3 prong plug on the end.	St
1.16.3	Did you read my lengthy message, the one which said I have an old model APC UPS device which has never been used?	St
1.16.4	I did read on APC's website to never plug any kind of printer into any of their UPS devices, they said printers draw too much electricity and could affect how long their UPS devices would work if there was a power outage.	St
1.16.5	The battery in my old unused device is probably no good since it's 12 years old, a new battery for it from APC costs $39.99 USD.	St
1.16.6	I think I'm going with a pair of shorter electrical power cords mentioned by another poster, that pair of shorter cords could be connected to my 2 power bricks, 1 powering my router, the other 1 powering my DSL modem and by doing so I should regain the 2 electric outlets on my surge suppressor that I lost when the bricks were plugged directly into my surge suppressor.	St
1.16.7	Should I use 2 surge suppressors or if I can plug everything into just 1 surge suppressoe use just 1?	St
1.16.8	I need to find out how much wattage that 1 surge suppressor can safely handle.	St
1.16.9	If I decided to use 2 surge suppressors could I plug 1 into the upper plug on my grounded outlet and another 1 into the lower plug on my grounded outlet?	St
1.16.10	As I said previously that one grounded outlet is on it's own 15 amp dedicated circuit.	St
1.17.1	extenders previously linked where needed, and connecting whatever devices printer to the UPS as long as it's not a laser printer or other high wattage device.	St
1.17.2	Lasers require too much wattage and shortens/reduces the 'up time' on the UPS.	St
1.17.3	I wouldn't be without a good UPS and use them to protect my systems and allow me to effect an orderly save and shutdown.	St
1.17.4	Hope this helps.	St
1.17.5	VAPCMD	St
1.18.1	That cable company that you recommended, have you ever bought anything from them?	St
1.18.2	Are they good to do business with?	St
1.18.3	About a UPS, do all UPS devices come with expensive batteries and if so how often do you have to replace the batteries in them?	St
1.18.4	Once a year?	St
1.18.5	Once every 2 years?	St
1.18.6	My HP Photosmart C5280 All-In-One printer is an inkjet printer, not a laser printer.	St
1.18.7	Is this a good APC branded UPS to consider?	St
1.18.8	http://www.apc.com/products/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm?base_sku=BE750G&total_watts=200	St
1.19.1	I haven't purchased from the company previously link but wouldn't hesitate to buy such products from them provided the shipping was reasonable.	St
1.19.2	The ones I have were purchased at MicroCenter.	St
1.19.3	My experience with APC UPSs .. excellent and the ones I've owned (and I own a number of them) have lasted 4-5 years and beyond without battery replacement.	St
1.19.4	VAPCMD	St
1.20.1	I'd say scrap the old UPS if it's that old.	St
1.20.2	The batteries aren't cheap.	St
1.20.3	Get a UPS and check the specs.	St
1.20.4	Some have multiple outlets purposes.	St
1.20.5	This means some are battery backed and some just surge protected.	St
1.20.6	My own personal opinion is that surge protector type power strips are, for all intents and purposes, nearly useless.	St
1.20.7	Their protection diminishes over time.	St
1.20.8	Think of a shock absorber that wears out but, with an electrical surge protector, you can't feel when the &quot;bumps&quot; pass through.	St
1.20.9	You can plug in a regular power strip into the back of a non-battery backed outlet in a good UPS and your just as well off.	St
1.20.10	Just get a good enough one to handle all the connected devices.	St
1.20.11	I can't calculate your needs but err on the conservative side.	Sug
1.20.12	I'll suggest 700VA and up to 1KVA should be fine for most home uses.	Sug
1.20.13	And, yes, you can certainly plug any 2 prong device into a 2 pronged (polarized) outlet.	St
1.20.14	By polarized I mean one prong is slightly larger than the other so that it only fits one way.	St
1.20.15	This need is dictated by the device and not the outlet.	St
1.21.1	So pitch the old UPS device by APC or would it be safe to just store it back in the closet?	St
1.21.2	If there's a chance of the battery leaking I'll certainly pitch it.	St
1.21.3	What about this UPS by APC?	St
1.21.4	Link below.	St
1.21.5	http://www.apc.com/products/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm?base_sku=BE750G&total_watts=200 So your advice would be for me to add up all of the wattage my components would be using?	St
1.21.6	A list of the items on or near my desk which I'd like plugged into any new surge protector or UPS is below.	St
1.21.7	Dell Dimension 3100 desktop PC tower Panasonic KX-FP145 plain paper fax machine Linksys WRT54G wireless router - has a big power brick for plug Westell Liteline 6100 DSL modem - has a big power brick for plug KDS 17&quot; flat screen &quot;CRT&quot; color monitor Hewlett Packard 5280C Photosmart All-In-One inkjet printer-HP says do not hook up this device to a UPS plug, use only a surge protector plug Panasonic 5.8Ghz cordless phone That's about it.	St
1.22.1	So you purchased your cables from a company called MicroCenter?	St
1.22.2	My first desktop PC was purchased from a store in Houston, Texas called a MicroCenter Computer Store.	St
1.22.3	That first desktop was an old WIN 95 machine which served me well for many years, still got it packed away in my closet, can't use it with high speed internet, no ethernet connection, it was a 56k dial-up job.	St
1.22.4	The brand of desktop PC was a PowerSpec PC.	St
1.22.5	Thanks for your post.	St
1.23.1	NIL	St
1.24.1	Meaning what?	St
1.24.2	Explain.	St
1.25.1	You have a problem with too many devices and not enough outlets and were looking for something that could handle at least 10 electrical devices using one AC power source.	St
1.25.2	You got lots of advice and opinions.	St
1.25.3	You're worried about customer support for a $5.00 Y connector in one post.	St
1.25.4	There's no need to fret over that.	St
1.25.5	I've recommended a solution which, instead of trying to plug 10 devices into one outlet, gives more flexibility and better protection.	Sug
1.25.6	But, it will cost more.	St
1.25.7	You didn't start out by wanting this and you have been given two roads to follow.	St
1.25.8	One is the UPS and the other is ways to accomplish your original desire.	St
1.25.9	You're free to take the first road and add splitters to a surge protector if you desire.	Sug
1.25.10	As a matter of fact &quot;I think I'm going with a pair of shorter electrical power cords mentioned by another poster,...&quot; you said you're already going to do that.	St
1.25.11	As for picking the right UPS for you...please don't ask me to do that.	St
1.25.12	You've linked that same UPS to me twice and I've already said it might do.	St
1.25.13	I don't see anything else that I need to explain since you've apparently made your decision.	St
1.25.14	Good luck	Polite
1.26.1	NIL	St
