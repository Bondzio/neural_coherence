<s> Hi, I have never purchased external hard drive and have no knowledge in this area. </s>
<s> That's the reason I am here &gt; Actually, my requirement is as follows: I am looking for a 100-150 GB hard drive in which I can save personal data. </s>
<s> I will be carrying it with me most of the time, therefore, it should be &quot;rough and tough&quot; hardware. </s>
<s> Connecting with my notebook just to swap [copy-paste] data between laptop hard disk to external hard drive. </s>
<s> I mean, not connecting for long time, max connection time will be an hr. </s>
<s> Personally preferring that it has strong enclosure, so to avoid any jerks or fell down effect on hard drive. </s>
<s> And a fan to make it remain cool. </s>
<s> I will be connecting it with Compaq nx7300 Intel Core2 Duo, XP Professional notebook. </s>
<s> Please advise which is the best one to go for? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Bye, Viki. </s>
<s> And will eventually fail. </s>
<s> Maintain your backups as you always have. </s>
<s> -&gt; Try these: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=LaCie+Rugged+All-Terrain+Hard+Drive Bob </s>
<s> you can decide which mfgs to exclude. </s>
<s> Might be worthwhile putting some of your important ...can't afford to lose data on DVDs. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> LaCie Rugged looks good, specially with rubber to avoid shocks. </s>
<s> What about Maxtor OneTouch 4 Mini and Seagate FreeAgent Go? </s>
<s> Any idea about this? </s>
<s> Bye, Viki. </s>
<s> Why would we compare those? </s>
<s> Actually, to be honest, I have no idea in hard disk world. </s>
<s> Specially, external drives 2.5''. </s>
<s> In 2002 I bought 40GB Barracuda IV 7200 RPM. </s>
<s> And it was recommended on internet and had good review rating those days. </s>
<s> I found it very good! </s>
<s> Similarly, I find some good rating for Maxtor and Segate FreeAgent Go on iinternet. </s>
<s> That's the reason I asked for either one. </s>
<s> Well, do LaCie has internal fan? </s>
<s> And what is global rating of it? </s>
<s> Your help/guidence is highly appreciated! </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Bye, Viki. </s>
<s> I find a good external case, aluminum for heat dissipation, and with a fan. </s>
<s> Then I add a Seagate PMR (Perpendicular Magnet Recording) drive, my latest is a Seagate 450 Gig PMR drive. </s>
<s> PMR because it's faster than the lineal recording drives. </s>
<s> All my other internal drives in my three PCs have been upgraded to Seagate PMRs. </s>
<s> I don't like the complete drives because of the extra bells and whistles that can cause problems. </s>
<s> I just use the drive as a temporary backup. </s>
<s> Every so often I burn my backups to DVD media. </s>
<s> PMR speed, as my own tests. </s>
<s> I download video files ranging from 800 Mb to 1 Gig in size, and move them to my home server for storage. </s>
<s> With my old Seagate LMR drives a one Gig video file across my Gigabit network would take between two and three minutes. </s>
<s> Since I have upgraded all my drives to PMR, the same size file takes 45 seconds or less. </s>
<s> 'Nuff said about PMR. </s>
<s> Wayne Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about analog and digital data, Internet connections, Spyware removal, and download free software. </s>
<s> My mini-Schnauzer is smarter than your honor student. </s>
<s> There are very few models that fit your initial spec. </s>
<s> If you want to change that and your price point then I'd start another discussion. </s>
<s> Wayne: Thank you for sharing your experience. </s>
<s> The difference b/w PMR and LMR you mentioned really matters. </s>
<s> I am not sure whether PMR comes in 2.5'' (Laptop hard drive)? </s>
<s> Proffitt: What you want me to change in my req. </s>
<s> specs? </s>
<s> By rough & tough I simply mean: the hardware (enclosure and disk itself) should not be delicate. </s>
<s> The best e.g I can give is of Nokia 3310 model. </s>
<s> I dropped down 3310 many times (free fall), but it always worked better than before . </s>
<s> I am not saying, hard disk should possess same attributes as of 3310, but at least designed and tested for handling jerks, free fall and other physical external force. </s>
<s> My range is 100-150$. </s>
<s> This could go up as most as 200$, but in very rare/exceptional case. </s>
<s> Just to reiterate, i m looking for 100-150GB storage. </s>
<s> I thank you for your recommendations and help. </s>
<s> Bye, Viki. </s>
<s> I'm taking the view of how many employees treat the equipment. </s>
<s> Only those units I noted meet the rough and tough as you asked. </s>
<s> -&gt; For those that don't abuse the drives I suggest you shop for a drive case and then put a drive into it. </s>
<s> Not much harder than changing some lightbulbs. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> $150 is a very practical range esp if u shop at Newegg.com (great service. </s>
<s> a lot of free shipping. </s>
<s> no hassle awesome return policy. </s>
<s> they sell OEMs tho). </s>
<s> Anyway I know Apricorn and Seagate are good companies. </s>
<s> I heard about LaCie being good but i never see one first hand. </s>
<s> Just dont get Maxtor. </s>
<s> But my real suggestion is... use of an external encloser. </s>
<s> Get an aluminum enclosure with a fan from Mapower and a good Seagate internal harddrive and ur ready to go. </s>
<s> Think it'd be a bigger bang for the buck too and not as much bucks lol. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
