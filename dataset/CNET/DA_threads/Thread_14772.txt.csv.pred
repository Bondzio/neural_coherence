1.1.1	is there a function in the AIW card where I can set a schedule , and hibernate the computer ?	Ques
1.1.2	and when the time comes , the computer will start itself and record and then shut down once its done ?	Ques
1.1.3	that is one function i really need it seems what i want is called SRPO ( scheduled recording in power-off mode ) from searching on google , it doesnt seem like the AIW 's have this feature ... . but i cant be sure can any of you with AIW 's confirm this with me ?	Ques
1.2.1	any video/tuner card *should* support this feature , but lots of PCs have problems going to sleep and waking up .	St
1.2.2	if your PC can hibernate/restore without a problem , srpo should work for you .	St
1.2.3	generally , you 'll need to use the official/stable ( whql ) drivers for your PC and the latest OS service pack ... resist the urge to update your drivers beyond what the PC manufacturer provides unless it comes via Windows update ( assuming you 're using XP ) .	St
1.2.4	if you need more reassurance , post your question to ATI or the & quot ; Home Theater Computers & quot ; forum of http : //www.avsforum.com/ .	St
1.3.1	right now im using a monstertv tuner , and it has a built in SRPO function in its software and it works very well , no problems at all .	St
1.3.2	just wondering if the AIW software had it built in as well ...	St
