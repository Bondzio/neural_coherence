I came home yesterday a my comp was off, it was on when I left.
Now it will not turn on at all.
I took the cover off and when I push the power button all the fans spin for a second and then stop.
There is a green led on the mobothat is on, but nothing else happens.
Is the PSU shot?
Is there anything else I can check?
Thanks Sean
