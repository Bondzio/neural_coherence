1.1.1	Recently purchased MacBook Pro 17 & quot ; .	St
1.1.2	All fonts are micro type .	St
1.1.3	Web pages are columns using only one half to one third of the nice big screen .	St
1.1.4	I can & quot ; zoom & quot ; but that is not a permanent solution .	St
1.1.5	This includes the tool bar ... ... .. its tiny .	St
1.1.6	How do I make things readable and fit the screen ?	Ques
1.1.7	I can not find the answer in the manual or online but I may be searching the wrong criteria .	St
1.1.8	Help in the form of the correct web page is fine .	St
1.2.1	this question gets asked by recent switchers who are used to having a web page fill the entire screen .	St
1.2.2	Problem with that is that the web pages are not built to fill the whole screen .	St
1.2.3	Most are built to accommodate a 19 & quot ; monitor .	St
1.2.4	Try hitting the green button , top left of the window , and Safari will expand to the actual size of the web page .	St
1.2.5	P	St
1.3.1	The problem you are having is a real pain if you own an older model 17 & quot ; MB Pro but if you have the latest model then simply decreasing screen res should do the trick .	St
1.3.2	Current model MB Pros do n't suffer the slightly soft , out of focus screen that results when you use any setting other than the highest screen res .	St
1.3.3	But if you did buy an older model then you are just going to have to live with command+ every time you open a new browser window .	St
1.3.4	Or you can decrease screen res and learn to live with the slightly soft screen .	St
1.3.5	1600 x 1000 is the lowest setting I can tolerate but image/text will still appear proportionally smaller than on a 15 & quot ; MB Pro set to a native res of 1440 x 900 or a 20 & quot ; Apple cinema display set to its native res of 1680 x 1050 .	St
