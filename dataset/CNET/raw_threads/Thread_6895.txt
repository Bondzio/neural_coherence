Is there a way to use one monitor with 2 pc,s. Not at the same time. I want to move 2 towers into one cabinet and I have slide out shelves for the key boards etc but no room for multiple monitors. Both pcs are dell demension with xp installed. Can this be done? All the pcs (four) share info and internet thru a wireless net work and the printers are on a print server at another location.
