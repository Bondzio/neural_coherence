max operating temperature (c) 55 - 70 the above is what i was able to track down for my particular cpu.
when i was watching it on the easytuner app last night, i saw that it was hovering right around 48 - 50 c. this was after the machine had been up and running for a while.
i had been playing games and running applications for probably a few hours.
i guess it is still within it's safety zone.
if anyone has a better suggestion for an app to measure stats, i'd be grateful.
