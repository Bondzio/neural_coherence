1.1.1	I did not see an completely appropriate forum section for this question so networking it is .	St
1.1.2	Please redirect me if I am mistaken .	Sug
1.1.3	I am doing some research on migrating off my mainframe system here onto a server system .	St
1.1.4	My question is what physical machines and OS have others used to do this .	St
1.1.5	I am not asking for someone to tel lme exactly what and how I should do it , just give a generalknowledge of what others out there have done .	St
1.1.6	The requirements I have are ( 1 ) quad processors ( 2 ) at least 8gigs of RAM ( 3 ) at least 144gig of disk space oon at least 4 hot-swappable disks as i would like to make a Raid 5 array and have a hot spare .	St
1.1.7	I am currently looking at and trying to familirize myself with Solaris by Sun .	St
1.1.8	It looks like a very capable OS and Sun looks to be making some great server machines .	St
1.1.9	What do you guys think ?	Ques
1.1.10	Thanks for you time .	St
1.1.11	Mac	St
1.2.1	This purely depends on your application and needs .	St
1.2.2	In most of my projects , the clients prefer to use Linux on Dell 's .	St
1.2.3	IMHO , Sun makes great servers and Solaris is a rock solid OS however given their present financial state , I am not sure how long Sun is going to be in business .	St
1.2.4	So if you 're looking for long terms support , be careful about getting into a Sun platform .	St
1.2.5	As for Storage , consider SAN 's from SUN , Hitachi .	St
1.2.6	We recently deployed Apple X-Serve RAID and it works great coupled with a good fibre-switch .	St
1.3.1	To spec the system by number of CPUs and RAM sounds odd .	St
1.3.2	Of course I ca n't know what 's driving this requirement but let 's compare the old XEONs to the new ones ?	Ques
1.3.3	The old Xeons would not deliver as many mips as the latest at the same GHz but would meet your spec .	St
1.3.4	SUN also may deliver you Opterons and not Xeons so without a benchmark it could happen your quad CPU system could be outperformed by a simpler but faster dual core XEON ?	Ques
1.3.5	I think you should toss this spec back into the pot and cook it more .	St
1.3.6	Bob	St
1.4.1	Thanks for the replies guys .	St
1.4.2	I appreciate the heads up on the financials with Sun I will for sure look into that .	St
1.4.3	I understand the point you are trying to make about processor performance .	St
1.4.4	However , as you can see from my handle , I am but a lowely intern doing research and was given these requirements from the boss .	St
1.4.5	He basically said he wanted to double the processing and ram of the current mainframe we have that runs at 50mips , dual processor 4gb ram setup and have at minimum the same ~144GB of storage space .	St
1.4.6	I have been looking and San 's and you have lead me into what would have been my next question .	St
1.4.7	In these new servers where would i get better performance in terms of speed , internal SCSI disk drives or a fiber SAN ?	Ques
1.5.1	SUN has excellent people you can get this done and over with .	St
1.5.2	Why not make the free call and toast this assignment ?	Ques
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	I have been on the phone with Sun a little bit and got some reccomendations on which machines they think would suit my needs .	St
1.6.2	I have also done some researching on IBM , Dell , HP and a few others machines also .	St
1.6.3	I would just like to get some information about what others out there are doing and how it is working out for them .	St
1.6.4	Not to mention we WILL NEED long term support for this hardware so if Sun is in financial disaray that could be disasterous .	St
1.6.5	It is imperative that we not have this hardware be unsupported .	St
1.6.6	If it were to go down ... ..lets just say many bad things that would effect us all WOULD happen .	St
