Most of my work is done on Adobe CS5. I am looking for something on a long term base. If anyone would suggest me the configuration (motherboard, GPU, memory, etc) it would be great. Thanks Pavitra

For fast desktops I suggest any of the quad or six core Intel i7 machines with 4GB RAM to start, Windows 7 64 bit and a nice graphics card. Start at the Nvidia GT220 with 1GB RAM and go up from there. Bob

The problem is i have been outdated with all the new hardware avaiable in the market today. Motherboards, GPUs, dualGPUs etc. Any bonus suggestion would help alot. THANKS.

We're done in a flash and back to work. If you read these forums it's a shame that folk lose time with getting BIOS up to date, incompatible RAM or having to solve integration issues with their selections. Bob
