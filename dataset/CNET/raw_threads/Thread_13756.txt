12013	0	196668	2116807	NR	Poineer	8/7/06 12:59 AM	1.15491234E12	Immediate shutdown after booting	Hi My pc seems to have a odd problem.When i boot my pc, it shows the window xp desktop screen and then immediately shuts down(does not reboots). But if i start the system, and go into the bios setup ,remain there for about 10 min and exit without saving, then it functions normally. Is this due to weak cmos battery or something else. Pls help Thanks

I usually (in power related issues) say not to start the pc and have the power supply tested first. The reason? If it stops your fans from working, you can get overheating issues, shutdowns, restarts and eventually lead to extreme enternal damage like a fried CPU and motherboard. Cheers, Paul
