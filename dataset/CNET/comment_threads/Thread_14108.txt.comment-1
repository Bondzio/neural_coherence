Hello, I am running AMD PhenomII 3.2 Black edition quad.
I have ATX mid tower case.
I have been using the stock fan/heatsink since I got it and it cools fine but is really loud when playing games.
Basically I don't want a huge fan/heatsink that won't fit in the case.
All the good ones seem to be designed for a huge tower case.
I would prefer one that sits like the stock one and doesn't stand because I don't think that would fit into the case.
Anyone have a good one they've used that won't take up too much room but work better than the stock for a quad core AMD?
