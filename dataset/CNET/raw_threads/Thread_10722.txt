This website provides some help on a source, but google for more: http://www.power-on.com/atx12vem300bt.html Further, the absolute best psu source are those from: http://www.pcpowerandcooling.com and find the replacement for your model. The same advice goes for any replacement from any vendor, it MUST be compatible as a direct &quot;fit&quot; as well as power needs. tada -----Willy
