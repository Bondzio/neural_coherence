It has a 300 Watts SMPS(PSU). I'm planning to upgrade to a 400 Watts SMPS. But, there's a problem. My Lenovo SMPS has a 2-pin Power slot for the Lenovo LCD-TFT Monitor. Does all SMPS have that slot ? Or else then what should i do now?

I would say that the 400W *should* include it. Where are you buying it from? Might they list the connectors, like most sites? ~Ibrahim~
