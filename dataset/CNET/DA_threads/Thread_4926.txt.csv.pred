1.1.1	I have a 500GB Seagate external hard drive ( part number : 9CZ2A3-501 ) that I wish to partition to transfer about 6GB of files from my Windows 7 Home Premium laptop to my home built Ubuntu 10.04 desktop .	St
1.1.2	However , whenever I try to shrink the 465GB ( formatted ) partition down 10GB to 455GB , in the Windows partitioning tool in Disk Management and other third party programs , I always get an error , and I can not partition the drive .	St
1.1.3	The Windows tool even took away 100GB of storage , which I had to gain back using Partition Wizard Home Edition .	St
1.1.4	Using this program , I was going to try to shrink the volume and format as ext3 .	St
1.1.5	I know I have enough room ; I am only using about 100-150GB for a system backup , with few other files on it , so I have about 300GB free space when formatted .	St
1.1.6	I get an error ( in Partition Wizard ) , something like 'not enough memory ' , and in Disk Management , something like not enough space to complete this . '	St
1.1.7	Can you recommend what I could do to partition this drive ?	Ques
1.1.8	Or do you have a better ( yet free ) idea to transfer these files ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	Why not place these files in there own folder ?	Ques
1.2.2	I do this all the time with Ubuntu .	St
1.3.1	For sake of easiness .	St
1.3.2	I thought that the drive , being formatted as NTFS , could only be read in Ubuntu ( or any other GNU/Linux using a NTFS compatible kernel ) .I guess , however , even if this is true , it wo n't matter anyways since I wo n't be writing to the disk , anyways .	St
1.3.3	Thanks .	Polite
1.4.1	And what 's this about read only in Ubuntu ?	Ques
1.4.2	I read and write all the time to NTFS in Ubuntu ( current version . )	St
1.5.1	And you do n't have any third-party stuff to do this , or a custom compiled kernel ?	Ques
1.5.2	I had thought I read somewhere , I think on Wikipedia , that the GNU/Linux kernel had limited support for NTFS , only supporting reads at best .	St
1.5.3	I 'm probably wrong , though , since this will be my first shot at any GNU/Linux distro , or building a computer .	St
1.5.4	Or maybe I read an outdated article from somewhere else .	St
1.5.5	It certainly does n't help when I 'm all alone in the technological world , with only these forums and the Internet , not anyone to actually talk to .	St
1.5.6	Once I 'm finished my build , I 'll just go ahead and try it , and post how it went .	St
1.5.7	Thanks for the help and boost of confidence !	St
1.6.1	http : //www.ubuntu.com/ I do n't think this is a custom build and right off the CD in it 's live mode and even installed I am able to read and write to NTFS volumes .	St
1.6.2	What version are you using ?	Ques
1.6.3	I wrote current since I forgot the exact number but it is 10.04 from http : //www.ubuntu.com/ And let me share I 've used this boot CD in Live CD mode to read/write XP , Vista ( 32 & 64 ) and Windows 7 64 bit hard disks without any fuss .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	I 'd be using Ubuntu 10.04 ( Lucid ) .	St
1.7.2	And I believe I would have been reading a very outdated article somewheres online , since I read on Wikipedia that full support is available in the kernel , for some versions already , using the NTFS-3G driver , which should be included in most distros by default .	St
1.7.3	Sorry for the confusion I may have created , which could have been prevented if I just researched more carefully .	St
1.7.4	I just wanted to be sure , though , anyways .	St
1.7.5	Thanks for the help .	St
1.7.6	Elljl	St
1.8.1	Those old articles will continue to float around for years .	St
1.8.2	The new distros seem fine with NTFS which is really helpful when some file wo n't delete in Windows and I do n't feel like booting to the command prompt .	St
1.8.3	Bob	St
