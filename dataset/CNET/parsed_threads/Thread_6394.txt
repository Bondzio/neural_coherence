<s> I have need to upgrade my cpu from a pentium d 930 3.00 ghz, and I was wondering might be compatible with my computer. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116367 would this cpu be ok on my comp? </s>
<s> They made it, they know the compatibility. </s>

<s> You need to check the specs of the current cpu you have. </s>
<s> Visit the Sony support website and review or check the manual of same and note the specs. </s>
<s> Once in hand visit the cpu maker support website and look-up that cpu. </s>
<s> Usually the cpu maybe listed or surfed until a list is found under that class&type what is available. </s>
<s> Find, the cpu that is a level higher and get it. </s>
<s> Of course, you need to know the range the mtrbd. </s>
<s> bios allows for such an upgrade. </s>
<s> Its very important to be sure your mtrbd. </s>
<s> is at the latest bios update, if not do so. </s>
<s> This will allow the support of any level of cpu or better support of same, otherwise, it would be a waste of time. </s>
<s> This also includes any FSB or jumper setting that match the needs of the new cpu or is &quot;auto set&quot; from the bios itself. </s>
<s> If the proper cpu class&type are followed it won't damage the mtrbd. </s>
<s> and it should easily be acknowledged excluding any manual setting. </s>
<s> Otherwise, the cpu upgrade if not supported or requires more than the mtrbd. </s>
<s> allows the upgrade is mute. </s>
<s> This is sometimes the end result for OEM because they're not as flexible to such or very limited range. </s>
<s> Also, make sure the cooling matches what the cpu requires if not supplied in the cpu upgrade kit. </s>

<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> did what you recommended, and found a processor thats easily twice as good but will function well in my case. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
