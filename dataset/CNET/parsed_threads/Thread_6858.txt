<s> I just built a new Vista Business 64-bit rig, and I have hooked up my HP Photosmart 7960 Series printer to it. </s>
<s> Previously, this was hooked up to a XP desktop, and my other XP laptops printed to it fine. </s>
<s> Now that I have my Vista rig hooked up to it, my XP laptops can't add the printer. </s>
<s> When I try to add the printer from the local network, XP says... &quot;The server for the &quot;HP Photosmart 7960 series&quot; printer does not have the correct printer driver installed. </s>
<s> If you want to search for the proper driver, click OK. </s>
<s> Otherwise, clock Cancel and contact your network administrator or original equipment manufacturer for the correct printer driver.&quot; After clicking OK, it asks my to located the file &quot;*.INF&quot;. </s>
<s> I've tried inserting the HP disc that came with the printer and location a driver from there, but that does not work either. </s>
<s> I've also tried downloading the latest XP drivers for this printer and installing them on my XP laptop, but that doesn't work either. </s>
<s> Help, please! </s>
<s> I do not own that model printer or have access to one but here's what I do to get such working. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> I install the printer driver from HP.com for the printer for the OS in question. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Then I can find the printer and use it. </s>
<s> &quot; tried downloading the latest XP drivers for this printer &quot; Since we need Vista drivers, that seems to be something odd to do. </s>

<s> I don't need the Vista drivers; I downloaded and installed the Vista drivers on the Vista rig, and the printer is working fine on it. </s>
<s> The problem is with the XP laptops. </s>
<s> I have tried downloading the XP drivers for the printer and installing them on the XP laptops, but then when I try to connect to the printer over the network, I still get that driver message. </s>
<s> http://forums11.itrc.hp.com/service/forums/bizsupport/questionanswer.do?threadId=1104549 I won't rewrite this but the public has been dealt a bad hand here. </s>
<s> Let me say that the above link does work and the method of installing the printer driver first then changing the CONNECTION later. </s>
<s> If you feel the method you are using must work (it doesn't!) </s>
<s> then you have to deal with HP, Microsoft and a few dead popes. </s>
<s> I don't expect any of those 3 groups to respond. </s>
