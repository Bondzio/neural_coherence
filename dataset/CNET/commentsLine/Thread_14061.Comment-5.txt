hi bob i'm only using lan/ethernet ports, at this moment i'm able to assign a secundary ip (192.168.10.1/24) to them, and keep the old sagem f@st with the 192.168.1.1/24, but if i change my pc ip to 192.168.10.10/24 i can ping the sagem, but can't access the internet.
the only way that can access the internet is keeping my pc ethernet port in the 192.168.1.0/24 sub-net.
i don't know if this is a windows miss configuration or a bad router configuration.
my words and explanations, sometimes, may be lacking precision, that is because i'm just starting in the network field (studying) .
for example, i'm having a hard time to understand was does the option &quot;enable ethernet m2u &quot; best regards vasco
