<s> I just read the review of USB 3.0 drives and want to buy a new drive for backups on my system. </s>
<s> My Window 7 PC is about a year old but I do not know if it has USB 1,2,or 3. </s>
<s> Is there a way in My Computer or the Device Manager to tell what version of USB I have? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> In Device Manager expand USB's. </s>
<s> Look after the Family part for USB or USB2, etc. </s>
<s> Under &quot;Universal Serial Bus controllers&quot; it lists 17 items, &quot;Standard Enhanced PCI to USB Host Controller&quot; (twice), &quot;Standard OpenHCD USB Host Controller&quot; (four times), &quot;USB Root Hub&quot; (8 times), etc. </s>
<s> Each item refers only to &quot;USB&quot;, not USB2 or USB3. </s>
<s> Does this mean I have only USB1 and not USB 2 or 3? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> These two to mantain backward compatibility to USB 1.1 devices.&quot; (USB 2.0, Hi-Speed USB FAQ)&quot; </s>
<s> The important part is look for &quot;enhanced&quot;. </s>
<s> Have a look here at MSDN. </s>

<s> while I was typing. </s>
<s> If my Device Manager lists &quot;Standard Enhanced PCI to USB Host Controller&quot; twice, does that mean I have 2 USB 2.0 ports? </s>
<s> Does &quot;Standard OpenHCD USB Host Controller&quot; mean USB 1.0? </s>
<s> What would it say if I had USB 3.0? </s>
<s> I have 6 total USB ports, 4 in the back and 2 in the front. </s>
<s> Is there anyway to tell which are the USB 2.0 ports? </s>
<s> Thanks very much. </s>
<s> If your PC is 1yr. </s>
<s> old it will have USB2.0 that usually allows USB1.1 compatibility. </s>
<s> The issue of USB3.0 is going to be stated as that's a selling point for any new PC. </s>
<s> However, you didn't state what your PC maker was or model#. </s>
<s> Most OEM makers provide the specs of what they contain, so review them or check manual. </s>
<s> USB3.0 is more readily ID'ed by the &quot;blue color&quot; of ports or a different color scheme, though that may not apply to every brand out there. </s>

<s> My PC does not have a brand. </s>
<s> Our network &quot;guy&quot; built it and a couple of others for us last year. </s>
<s> He moved and I can't get in touch with him anymore. </s>
<s> There is no manual. </s>
<s> I'm sure he used parts which were easy to find and cheap, but it is fast works great. </s>
<s> The ports, both front and back, are white, not blue, so I assume they are not USB 3.0. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Then you need to refer to what information can be gotten using some s/w analyzer, like PCWizard 2012. </s>
<s> Irt will report what you really have and then use that to google for your needs. </s>
<s> The report should state what mtrbd. </s>
<s> you have, like Brand XYZ-123-a, google away for the manual and thus review what your specs are. </s>
<s> The information is more than anything else, real hard facts about your build. </s>
