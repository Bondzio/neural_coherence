thus search for that type mobos.
not very many top line types available anymore.
i just ordered one from newegg and the next time i looked they were out of stock.
i don't use ebay, but apparently there are some there.
almost all available are microatx.
then you have the problem with dell.
change the mobo to another type [even if it fits in and the power supply is compatible] the operating system will not work because it does not see the hardware that dell shipped it with.
