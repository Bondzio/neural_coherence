Hi!
I hope someone will be able to help me here and that I might actually learn something at the same time!
I work off a couple of Lacie drives but for some or other reason I am unable to delete anything off these drives and restore the memory that was taken up before i deleted an item/project.. Therefor up until now I have always just finished a project on a certain drive and then formatted the whole drive to clean it up.
This means that I can not choose what I want to delete, because even if I delete it off the drive (stash it into the trash), the memory is still in use and the drive still fills up.
This is starting to become a problem because I have quite a few projects running at the moment and am running out of space!
If anyone can maybe help me and explain to me if there is a different way in which I can clean the drives without losing specific folders or projects I would really appreciate it!
It is quite hard to explain but I hope what Im asking makes sense!
Thank you!
