OK so if I stuff my PC with enough RAM it might double the life span of the SSD.
I think my NP740U3E-S04UK can take 10GB although I have seen 14 and even 16GB quoted.
I always keep the data mirrored and archived, but I suppose it would be worth doing backups of the entire SSD using whatever Windows 8 provides.
