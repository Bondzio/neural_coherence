there are no tests in the field except for swap and retest.
if you don't have spare parts... frankly, if the cpu and hsf came out without unlatching... but words haven't conveyed what a picture would.
a real problem is that a faulty psu could have caused this as well as a loose screw (or other conductive item) in the machine.
sorry, i couldn't tell if it's good/bad without placing into a working machine.
