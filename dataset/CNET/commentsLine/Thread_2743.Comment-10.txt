el bastardo follow bob's suggestions, just some thoughts...... amd chips are known to run hot.
the newest intel cpu are even hotter.
to place your components in a micro tower... bad, very bad advice from the seller.
on the bios, from mnf to whrse to retail in this time bug fixes, upgrades for memory/cpu, compatabily to hwd can change.
this is why checking if bios upgrade is necessary.
on video, i run 3 monitors 1/agp, 2/pci no compatabilty problems other than windows becoming confused once in a while.
