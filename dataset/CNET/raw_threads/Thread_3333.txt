Can it be left connected to the PC ? If not, is it better / safer to connect it to the Desk Top PC before pressing the Start-Up Button, or to plug it in after completion of Start-Up. Would appreciate getting advice on this issue. Thanks in anticipation.

But if it is connected before booting up computer then you CAN NOT be able to do &quot;hot swapping&quot; with the drive (safely remove will not be possible)...at least that has been my experience. So don't disconnect while computer is still on.
