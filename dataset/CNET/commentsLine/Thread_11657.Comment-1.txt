first post in forums, cut a beginner some slack.
friend's computer.
emachines et1331g-07w nvidia geforce 6150se integrated windows 7 home premium 64bit amd athion ii x2 250u dual-core processor 640 gb hdd 4gb ddr2 memory its hooked up to dell monitor via vga.
when computer turns on it doesn't show any of the boot up process, fans run, the keyboard and monitor lights flash green then the moniter goes yellow.
if you press the moniter buttons it displays a message along the lines of 'moniter in power save mode, press any key or move the mouse etc.'
but the mouse and keyboard are unresponsive, the mouse glows red but nothing happens.
i haven't found an answer in my surfing.
