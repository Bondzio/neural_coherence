1.1.1	I recently changed my MoBo and did not account for my non-sata IDE hard drives not being able to be accessed by the new all sata port mobo.	St
1.1.2	I tried using the sata to ide adaptors but to no avail.	St
1.1.3	I since went ahead and bought a sata HD, but how can I retrieve all my precious data from the old IDE drives and apply to my new system?	St
1.1.4	HELP PLEASE!!!	St
1.1.5	I run Windows XP with AMD Athalon 64X2 Core Processor 5200+, 271 GHz and 3.25 gigs of ram, ATI Radeon HD 3600 Video Card, Tascam FW-1082 WDM Audio Interface, with a Gigabyte MoBo	St
1.2.1	Get your system up and running with the new HD.	St
1.2.2	Once done, get your hands on a ext.	St
1.2.3	USB enclosure or adapter.	St
1.2.4	I've used this with great success: http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=2020D&cpc=SCH You can use that or similar and access your data via the USB port.	St
1.2.5	tada -----Willy	St
1.3.1	I should have mentioned, you're better off re-installing the pgms.	St
1.3.2	you plan to swap data from.	St
1.3.3	Once that's done, you can then more easily copy data from old source to new under XP.	St
1.3.4	Otherwise, with XP it can get sticky, so don't try to defeat this if you plan to install on new HD.	St
1.3.5	Once, you're happy, you can reformat the old HD and use as an ext.	St
1.3.6	HD for backup or whatever.	St
1.3.7	-----Willy	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
