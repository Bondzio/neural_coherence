<s> I think HP is on a path to doom. </s>
<s> Just take a look at their PCs, who designs it? </s>
<s> I would never buy such a ugly looking computer. </s>

<s> I was out circuit city today and saw them on display. </s>
<s> They look really nice in the store but horrible on the web. </s>
<s> They really need to fix those pictures. </s>
<s> I bought mine in early Jan. this year, i love it. </s>
<s> I wouldnt care if it was pink so long as it runs like it does. </s>
<s> an HP printer. </s>
<s> It's a very efficient machine--but it's definitely not a fashion statement! </s>
<s> The software that came with my printer was junk. </s>
<s> The auto-update feature only worked once...after that, it was all error messages, etc. </s>
<s> No one at the company ever replied to any of the email inquiries I sent them. </s>
<s> Eventually, I just decided to shutdown/remove all their software and get by with basic drivers. </s>
<s> Everything works just fine now. </s>
<s> Based on recent threads, I'd never buy a laptop from HP/Compaq (badly designed/constructed, overheating problems, etc.) </s>
<s> and I'd approach their desktops with caution. </s>
<s> HP probably won't be of any help to you if you have a problem (or get a lemon), so you'll have to be ready to return it quickly--or fix it yourself. </s>
<s> If you get a good one, it will be a deal...but it will never be a fashion statement! </s>
<s> -JDM </s>
<s> If you like bells&whistles, etc. </s>
<s> maybe it won't cut it. </s>
<s> I've seen some pretty niffy setups and other generic cases that people can buy get way out of hand with thier styling which doesn't appeal to me. </s>
<s> You would think some of them were too close to a heat source or that holes everywhere is proper. </s>
<s> basically, you get what you like and feel comfortable with, but I tend to stick with function over form. </s>
<s> enjoy -----Willy </s>
<s> Never thought they were ugly....who can really see it way down on the floor...tucked away on the side of my desk? </s>
<s> However, I just got the latest Media Center (n7060m) and I am not impressed. </s>
<s> Lotsa software loading problems. </s>
<s> And networking with my other Gateway was very difficult. </s>
<s> I ended up with a Circuit City PC guru making a house call to network them. </s>
<s> Plus, XP DVD discs back-up has failed 3x. </s>
<s> But, I'm stuck with it...and so, I'll be calling HP and Circuit City for some time to come. </s>
