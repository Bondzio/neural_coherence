Can you make it CD, then A, then C. This, of course is assuming that the problem is that the drive is not up to spped when it gets looked for.
Are you using AUTO in the BIOS as the detection method?
That means that it gets searched for at each boot, but possibly if you have the parameters set, they are not exactly correct.
I could never get any drive to detect showing the parameters that the vendors sheet gave.
One parameter was always different than given by the mfr.
Not the same parameter for each drive type.
I must admit that I can't understand, why a drive that had been running would be slow to come up again.
Do you have a reset switch??
Try that to see if it makes a difference.
