Thanks.
That was very useful information.
Question about creating my own system backup/recovery CD.
Do I need a product like Norton Ghost or can I create a system backup CD/DVD with the native tools that come on the Dell 9100.
Excuse my ignorance, not a complete newbie, but not a real techie either.
