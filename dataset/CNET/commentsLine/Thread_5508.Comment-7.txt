i have had the same problem whit some external drives (harddisks) .
in some cases i could fix it by connekting it before i turned on the pc .
if that dosn?t help .
you could try to disemple the box and connekt the hard disk direktly to the pc.
there is programs that claims the could save your files , but they can bee hard to use.
kindely regards allan
