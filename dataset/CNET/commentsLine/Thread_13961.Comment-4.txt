1. bad caps (google to learn how to inspect for that.)
2. bios cmos battery.
use a volt meter to see if it's good.
having said that, i had a cranky machine for years and in the end we found out it was the motherboard.
we lucked into a clone/exact machine match that had the same motherboard.
swapped motherboards and the new(?)
machine started everytime.
go figure.
