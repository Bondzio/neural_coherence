I downloaded the lastest fw from Liteon &quot;KHOR&quot; and when I try to flash the drive i get this error: &quot;NO MATCHED DRIVE DETECTED! THIS UTILITY IS ONLY FOR LITE-ON COMBO LTC-48161H DRIVE DETECTED DRIVES: 1-0-0-0 D:LITE-ON COMBO LTC-48161H KTH2&quot; It has the drive listed as a LTC-48161H KTH2 but I can't find any reference to that drive on Liteons site, and my disc utlity has the drives fw as KTH2 which I can't find on any fw history for the LTC-48161H drive. The drive won't recognize the majority of my DVD media and I just figured the fw needed upgraded but I'm having no luck. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

The reason I ask is that a discussion on a firmware forum mentioned such and &quot;yup&quot; there is no firmware update. Also how old is the drive. If 2 or more years I just swap the drive out after a pass of a CD/DVD lens cleaner. While some owners will want to try other fixes I'm usually on the clock to get it fixed. Bob
