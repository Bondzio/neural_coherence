I haven't recently made any changes to my system, connected any new hardware or installed anything short of the new iTunes.
Nonetheless, after logging in this morning my mouse and keyboard (logitech wireless desktop, through USB) didn't respond so that I could log in.
I used an old keyboard to progress past the Logon page (which I put straight into the keyboard plug - the round purple one) however have noticed that every USB device on computer fails to work!
This includes the internet (wireless USB dongle), my printer (through USB) and my printer (USB also).
I tried plugging in my ipod, and while it is able to charge, it is not recognized by my system!
Am currently using my laptop (which the wireless desktop, printer, ipod all work on) and have tried swapping the devices to empty USB ports, but nothing works!
I am currently running Windows XP SP2.
Please help!
