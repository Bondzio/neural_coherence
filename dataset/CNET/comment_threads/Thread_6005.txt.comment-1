I about fell off my chair when I came across this review this morning: http://tinyurl.com/mvn5e We ordered a pc from Alienware amost 8 weeks ago.
It was supposed to arrive 8/28.
We finally got fed up and cancelled the order yesterday, 10/6.
The number of excuses Alieware can come up with as to why they haven't built and shipped your pc is mind boggling.
I can only hope we don't have to contact the Florida State Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commision to get the $3400 charge removed from our credit card.
CNET, STOP STOP STOP STOP promoting Alienware!!!
They are turning your store ratings into a joke.
4 stars for Alienware, gimme a break.
