jose, if your funds are limited you might consider purchasing the system with the integrated graphics, but if you can wait a little longer or spend a little more up front, buy a system with a separate graphics card instead.
integrated graphics will never perform as well as a good system with an independent graphic card, however you may add another graphics card to the system that you are considering at a later time.
if you plan to play graphic intensive games, don't waste your money, buy a system with an independent graphic card.
hope i was able to help.
