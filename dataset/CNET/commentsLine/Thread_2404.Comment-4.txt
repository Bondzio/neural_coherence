some bioses allow you to pick which drive you want to boot from, so that you could do what you ask by just changing the setting in the bios.
another alternative is to just open the case and move the data and power cable from one drive to another.
you can also use something like virtual pc or vmware to have multiple os's available so that you boot to the one you want.
