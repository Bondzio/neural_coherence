I'm a fan of AMD, and the AMD system that ramarc laid out for you would do a fine job.
There are a lot of brand fanatics out there that'll tell you to go with one brand over another, but if you listen to them all, you'll never get your system built... go get the stuff already!
Get it, put it together, get your hands dirty, so to speak - it's the best way to learn.
