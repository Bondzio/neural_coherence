Computer: Gigabyte MB, P4 3.0Ghz, 1x 512MB PC3200 DDR, 128 MB Radeon 9600 graphics card, 400 Watt Pwr Sply With a cold machine, from start-up, the system goes through the bios configuration checks, and begins loading the O/S from the HD, it then simply shuts off! Sometimes when it is running, the system would just freeze, and I have to do a hard restart to turn it off, and then the shorting-out ensues. There are no error beeps when the system is turned on, I checked the MB battery (just checking everything) it was fine, the system is not overheating I've kept the case open and even blew a house fan into it (system temps were mild also), as far as I can see, the MB does not have direct contact with the case that would cause a short. I am COMPLETEY STUMPED! I don't know if I have a faulty processor, power supply, DDR, MB! Faulty case (buttons/connectors)? ANY HELP IS MUCH APPRECIATED.

My greatest suspect is the power supply, so I'll replace that first, if not the issue, onto the MB, if not the issue, onto the.... I mean, I'm up to suggestions on how to trouble-shoot it before I completely re-build it.

The second reveals that too many units &quot;fib&quot; about the number. Lesson? Just get the big one. http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/ http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/ Troubleshoot? You can try reducing the load. Are there more than one hard disk? Can you unplug the CD/DVD drives? What else can go? And the non-negotiable item. Latest BIOS. Some won't do this either because they think a new board would have the latest (ring the Jeopardy buzzer please...) or they are afraid. In closing, without spare parts, there is no certain way to find the dead/undersized or such part. The PC design isn't including diagnostics. Bob
