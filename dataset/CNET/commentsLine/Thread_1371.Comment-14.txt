$700 for the system new case (if you were buying the same parts i'm talking about) new case/psu - $140 new ram - $100 or more new graphics card - $124+ so your at $700 for the system and around $365 in upgrades so it's like $1065 with less harddrive a less featured motherboard (i gurantee emachines' board can't touch that chaintech in features, quality, and performance) and a slower cpu... if you throw in a 3500 your up to around $1400 so please consider before posting
