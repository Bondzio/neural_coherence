...get an Athlon 64/Athlon 64 X2.
The fact that they run a lot cooler than P4's is just gravy.
If you give me your budget for a CPU/board, I'll recommend one for you.
However, I've said it before, and I'll say it again: A new CPU and board will NOT take you from 35 to 70FPS; for that you'll need a new graphics card.
And if you get an A64, you'll want to get a motherboard with a PCIe slot, so you'll need a new graphics card.
AGP is obselete, so I wouldn't waste my money on a new board with only an AGP slot.
