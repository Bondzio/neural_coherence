fonfara's reply sounds the closest to the problem i am having which is similar to the original post, however, mine isn't a balloon that pops up, it's an actual icon in the space on the bottom right where the time and other icons are.
it appears as dual computers with a red x through them and the message reads: local area connection, a network cable is unplugged.
the problem with that message is i don't have lan.
i have a single home pc on dial-up connection.
it appeared about 3 months ago and all efforts to get rid of it have failed.
i'd appreciatre any suggestions.
