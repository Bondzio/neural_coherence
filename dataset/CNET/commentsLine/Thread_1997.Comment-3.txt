thanks, bill - i've checked the firewall and there don't seem to be issues there; and as far as the aps - one is a true ap, the other a router configured as an ap.
i've spent lots of time chasing my tail on the router configuration, but i'm pretty sure it's solid.
i think you've got me pointed in the right direction with switch configuration, which i haven't checked out at all.
the company that installed the switch (before my time) never set up an interface for it, so i'll do that over the weekend and see if there are settings that will fix the problem.
i'm an accidental techie working for a nonprofit with serious budget constraints, so really appreciate your help.
