What do you want to do with the computer? If gaming, buy a new one. Otherwise, upgrade system RAM to at least 512MB (or possibly up to 1GB). Maybe get a better video card, but that depends on the computer model and what you want to spend. You need to discover if it can take an AGP 4X/8X video card or just a PCI video card (PCI Express is not an option for a computer that old). BOTTOM LINE: If you do only one thing, upgrade the system RAM. Windows XP likes at least 512MB, and you will notice the difference. I don't like the idea of dumping too much money into that older system, especially since nice new systems are inexpensive.

Just getting more ram for a XP based system in practical terms is 512mb for good operation with 1gb for best overall. The other upgrades depending on your wallet should be considered but can wait provided you're happy with the ram upgrade alone. IMHO, that is the route I would go. tada -----Willy
