i use crt's for some extreme lan gaming.
first off, they are inexpensive compared to lcd.
plus i get no burnt pixels.
on occasion i play games in 3-d with wireless glasses that won't work with an lcd.
my 2 main monitors are stealth black ibm's with flat screen sony trinitron tubes.
a 19 and a 21 inch, both purchased used on ebay.
beautiful graphics.
i even use a crt projector hooked up to my homebuilt htpc.
it shoots a 10 foot hi-def picture.
the only thing i don't like is the weight.
the 21&quot; is 80lbs, 19&quot; is 60, and the projector is 140. that is my preference, but it sounds like you may enjoy an lcd since cost isn't an issue.
