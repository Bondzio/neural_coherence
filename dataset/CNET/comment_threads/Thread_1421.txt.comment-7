I just came across this Netgear page: http://kbserver.netgear.com/kb_web_files/n101496.asp My DG834G is a modem/router/switch/access point/firewall in one, and I've seen from the router admin page that I can switch off its DHCP assigning function.
If I disabled its auto-configuration to a network, gave it a static IP outside the range of my main router (DG834GT), gave my laptops static IPs, and if I made sure the router(GT) and access point(G) were broadcasting the same SSID on different channels... wouldn't that work?
The GT would now be a modem & wireless router; the G would be an access point.
