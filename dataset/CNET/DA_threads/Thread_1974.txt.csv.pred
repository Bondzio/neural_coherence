1.3.1	hmmm , I think I can help you in this regard , you have two DSL router , if you need computer behind them communicate with each other , you need to connect the two DSL devices via a twisted-pair cable , pls be aware , you are support to use one of the LAN port to connect them rather than the WAN port .	St
1.3.2	before you process this procedure , you need to modify the IP of your new DSL router , you can change it to 192.168.1.254 , meanwhile pls disable the dhcp function .	St
1.3.3	The final step is manual configure your IP for your computer , set your set your Ip as 192.168.1.250 and your gateway as 192.168.1.254. hope it can help your out !	St
