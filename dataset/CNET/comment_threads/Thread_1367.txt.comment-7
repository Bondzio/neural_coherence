Thanks for the tip.
I found out another product today by Linksys which actually does not restrict you to any particular media player/file -- and it also comes with a software which can supress other sounds on your computer (email notitification etc) while you're playing music.
It's called Linksys WMB54G Wireless G-music bridge.
Check it out on amazon or manufacture's site.
Although I'm quite happy with motorola bluetooth adapters I'm going to try this one as well.
Cheers!
