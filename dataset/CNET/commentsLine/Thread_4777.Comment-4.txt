refers to the data on the small [very very small, lol] cmos chip on the memory stick.
the chip has the data that tells the system what timing settings to use for the memory.
if the spd chip has gone bad, possibly, go into the bios and disable &quot;by spd&quot; and use a conservative timing setting for cas etc.
