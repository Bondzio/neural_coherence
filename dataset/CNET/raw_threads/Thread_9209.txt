I am wondering if either of these cards would be good upgrades for my system, and be able to play Oblivion fairly well: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814102680 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814121216 Also, I currently run my system on a 250W power supply. If I upgrade to one of these video cards, will I have to upgrade my power supply? If so, can you suggest one to me? Thanks! Also, if there are any other AGP video cards under $200 you would suggest, please tell me. Thanks!

If you're gonna play Oblivion with your PC, then I say you'll have to get the 6800 card rather than the X1600 Pro cuz it's gonna give you better frames, and the 6800 can be overclocked pretty well. As for your CPU, I think the settings won't be able to go max, maybe some medium, some low, 800 X 600 resolution. Your RAM is quite sufficient, although 2 gb. RAM is recommended....

Here's an article that compares a 1600xt and a 6800 (note that the x800 is slower than a x800gto). http://www.firingsquad.com/hardware/ati_radeon_x1600_xt_x1300_pro/page13.asp http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814102609 it's too bad that nvidia chose to pull the 6800gs since the was hands-down the best midrange AGP card a few months ago. TigerDirect still has a few: http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1648482&Sku=P56-6800&SRCCODE=SHOPPINGDF&CMP=OTC-SHOPPING
