With no ESD protection?
There are none.
If you're going to build a custom rig, and I assume you'll be dropping big bucks, a five dollar ESD wrist strap is a minimal investment.
If you know how to protect your devices easier than that, how about sharing?
I've been dealing with and teaching electronics since the 70s.
ESD will give you a bad day.
