I have decided to build my own gaming rig to shave some $, and I am in need of some guidance.
So far I've semi-decided on the following parts: Motherboard- -ASUS P5N-T Deluxe Motherboard Video Card -EVGA GeForce 9800 GT Video Card Processor- -Q9650 Intel Core 2 Quad Proc Hard-drive- -Western Digital Caviar SE16 500GB RAM -Kingston 1GB(x3) 667MHz DDR2 I know that I haven't listed an optical drive, case or monitor but that's not really a concern.
Anyway, my question is, am I missing anything important?
Is this a terrible mixture of components?
Am I off my rocker?
Any help, advice, suggestions or guidance would be greatly appreciated!
