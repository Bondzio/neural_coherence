Intel Pentium M Processor 730 (1.6GHz, 2MB L2 Cache, 533MHz FSB) or Mobile Intel Pentium 4 Processor 538 (3.20GHz1, 1MB L2 Cache) http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=2342&p=15 according to allot of research, i know its just gaming specs, but u can get an idea that these M cpu's dont suck in speed and even better than some P4's. but this is one of the reasons of the thread, im confused on this chip.

The changeover will leave thousands with a bad taste in their mouth as they mumble about paying top dollar for just a 32-bit machine. I don't suggest the 3.2+ GHz P4 HT models since they are hot desktop replacements with short battery times. Bob

When this comes out, i'll update the processor to 64-bit. Unfortunately, i doubt compaq/Hp will offer free processors, so you still have to get money out of your own pocket. But this is better than getting a new machine. Quoted technician &quot;Yes, sure it will be released in future. Research is being carried out to check it workability. I will forward your messages to our Research engineers and do my best to fasten the process.&quot; Roger
