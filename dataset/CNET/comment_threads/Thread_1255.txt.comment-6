I see people install any number of pests such as you find with this discussion -&gt; http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6132-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=1313&start=0 But if ATI can't document a fix and this is what I've used to fix this issue, I wonder if you'll have to wipe the OS out and try again?
Sorry, but that error has been encountered firsthand and those links are what I use.
