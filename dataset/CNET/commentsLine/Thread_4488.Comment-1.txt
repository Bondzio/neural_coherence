hello, i'm planning to build a pc with the following configuration.
processor: intel core2 quad q9400 95w (  ) motherboard: miniatx intel boxdq45ek (  ) display: on-board intel gma 4500 (may upgrade to a high end nvidia card later) ram: 4gb ddr2 800 hdd: 500gb sata @ 7200 rpm + usb powered 500gb external drive (wd passport) cd/dvd burner: yes could you tell me what should be the minimum power supply wattage i should be looking at ?
.. my guess is 375w.
also, i want to put this in a mini itx box, but most miniitx boxes come with &lt;200w of psu, so i'm going to have to buy a psu seperately.
would a regular psu fit in the miniitx case?
.. or do they have a special powersupply size for them.
your comments on my chosen configuration and decision to go for miniitx for this configuration are most welcome.
thank you, regards, puneet
