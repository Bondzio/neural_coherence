Around September, i can afford to buy something for about 150, i don't think i can go over that. Anyway, i was wondering how best to use this money, if i can, to upgrade my pc. I should also specify i use my pc for gaming, so anything that would improve its power/speed would be useful. I will post my specs, and i would appreciate if you guys could suggest what use my 150 should go to. BTW, i live in the UK, so i cant get stuff shipped from american companies as it would cost loads. Thanks for your help in advance, mahfuz. -AMD phenom X6 hex-core 3.2Ghz -2x 2gb corsair RAM -ATI Raedon 5770 graphics card -Asus motherboard with usb 3.0(i don't know the actual name of MB) -I have good peripherals, and so wont buy new ones -Windows 7 home premium -standard heatsink came with everything else -1 TB hard drive -
