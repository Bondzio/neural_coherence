Want to boot to it. No can do. The BIOS supports a boot sequence to a USB HD. The drive appears in My Computer and the Disk Management utility in Win XP. Will only boot to original C drive. Are these drives designed for storage only? Any advice appreciated.

Another quick question. Does Win ME have the capability to boot to a usb external drive? Thanks again. Dave Goodman
