<s> well my new pc came with a brandless PSU, i never leave it on for more than a day, usually around 10 hours max i would turn it off, but i need to download something important and i need to leave it on for possibily long periods of time, something like 30 hours, so my question is: -with the bad psu on my pc, will leaving it on for 30 hours be a bad idea? </s>
<s> luckily my pc isn't boiling....yet, and i already left it on for 12 hours, however i still need 30 more hours before i can turn it off, and i really don't want to turn it off unless i have no choice, i don't want 56k in the first place but broadband require signing a 1 year contract.... so please, give me some advice, thanks. </s>

<s> but surely you have a better psu than me, because mine is just very very bad, i don't even know where it's made or its brand. </s>
<s> I'll be blunt, if you know you have a 'bad psu' then why not replace it at the earliest convience if not sooner. </s>
<s> many a generic brand has survived basic demands, just go for one that's higher wattage. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> The fact that you don't know the mfr and where its made is not a reason in and of itself. </s>
<s> It might be made in China, but so what. </s>
<s> Yes the odds are high that it is not the greatest power supply but as long as it is working, why worry. </s>
<s> The 30 hour limit is in your head. </s>
<s> The power supply internals have reached its &quot;stable&quot; running temperature in ten or so minutes. </s>
<s> It may vary a little as the running load on the CPU varies depending on what you are doing. </s>
<s> It should stay in that temperature range as long as it is on. </s>
<s> I doubt the psu will have a problem with this. </s>
<s> If your concerned maybe remove the side cover...keep things a little cooler....doubt that it's needed. </s>
<s> Can you really keep your dial-up connection alive for 30 hrs? </s>
<s> That must be some HUGE download. </s>
