Is this too high? I'm not sure what determines just what the CPU temperature should be, but my components are: MOB: DFI LANPARTY UT nF3 250GB CPU: AMD athlon 64 3200+ Newcastle (Socket 754) HD: WD 160Gb serial ATA 150 7200rpm Video Card: ATI Radeon X700 PRO AGP 256mb Mem: OCZ Ultra High performance Dual Channel Kit 1Gig 3200 (2 x 512mb) Monitor: Viewsonic VA1912b OS: Windows XP Pro Optical Drives: Lite-On DVD and Plextor DVD burner Power: Antec True power 480W Thanks

Feel free to ask as many questions and as often as necessary. If you do not understand a reply fully, simply ask for more of an explanation. Always nice, if you then let us know if you got the problem solved.

And with improved case cooling and maybe a better HSF you can get the idle down to 38 to 40 C. It just isn't necessary unless you are a gamer and the running temo gets into the 60 C's. I only use caes with top exghaust fan and a side fan that blows in. These in combination with a rear exhaust fan [in addition to that of the power supply]. Most cases come with more locations to locate fans, than fans that they provide. If you add any fans, get dual ball bearing type, they last longer.
