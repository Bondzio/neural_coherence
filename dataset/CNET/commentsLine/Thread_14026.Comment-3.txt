the network media-player function can be easily built into a tv or other entertainment component.
among the devices that can connect directly to computers and home networks are networked blu-ray disc players, audio/video receivers, tivo and other digital video recorders, and video-game consoles like the playstation3 and xbox360.
most of these devices connect through an internet connection or an optional external wireless accessory.
a network media player makes it pretty easy to share your media on your home theater.
whether you choose a dedicated-network media-player device, or a tv or home-theater component to enjoy your media, be sure you have what you need to set up your home network and network media player.
