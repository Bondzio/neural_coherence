my gateway notebook broke last week, and my dad was able to load the hard drive into a usb 2.0 hard disk.
i never uploaded these to a seperate computer, and last night, my dad accidentally erased everything.
he was able to recover my files from 6 months ago and everything before them (from 2001 until 2/2006), but all the files from the past 6 months are gone.
is there any way to recover these?
and i've tried the winundelete, and a bunch of other programs, but none of these have recovered the deleted files.
thanks!
