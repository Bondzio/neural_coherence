<s> Okay so I've gone through like 4 computers in the past year (jeez, I know!) </s>
<s> and I finally received one that has a wonderful DVD drive! </s>
<s> I like this one. </s>
<s> Which is why I decided to buy a video card for it (uh-oh, investing in a computer when so many have been sucking!?) </s>
<s> so I could play the Sims and WoW. </s>
<s> I must feed my addiction. </s>
<s> Anyway. </s>
<s> The ISSUE. </s>
<s> I purchased a Sparkle GeForce 8400 GS Video Card - 512MB DDR2, PCI, DVI, VGA, S-Video from Tigerdircet.com. </s>
<s> I really don't know much about computers and the guys on Yahoo! </s>
<s> Answers said this video card will be fine and a whole bunch of garbage about how PCI express is better (I know that, I did my research, but this beast of a computer is a PCI dealio! </s>
<s> ), so I went with the card. </s>
<s> I got it and ran to install it, the generic &quot;quick install guide&quot; confusing me a bit, but it's not too hard to figure out. </s>
<s> I got excited and turned on the computer. </s>
<s> BAM. </s>
<s> No video on the monitor. </s>
<s> Like, wtf? </s>
<s> So I try it in all the ports (I have 3) and cleaned everything up (carefully), but I keep having to revert to the motherboard video card. </s>
<s> So I start looking up help from Sparkle (why shouldn't the manufacturer be able to help me?). </s>
<s> I registered my product and all that jazz, went to tech support, and the site had the nerve to ask me questions such as: What's your motherboard model NO? </s>
<s> Memory Type and Capacity? </s>
<s> Power Supply Wattage? </s>
<s> Brand of Power Supply? </s>
<s> Blah blah blah? </s>
<s> So I decided to get on the forums of CNET before I call and talk to some Indian guy for an hour to get nowhere. </s>
<s> Let me tell you what's a bit sketchy. </s>
<s> The box has a bunch of stickers on it. </s>
<s> The one with my model and serial numbers is right (M/N: SF-PC84GS512U2LP), but there's one that has a picture of a PCI express card. </s>
<s> Uhh, not what I ordered. </s>
<s> Plus, when I went online to download a thorough manual, it was only for AGP or PCI Express. </s>
<s> When I clicked the manual for my specific card! </s>
<s> The box doesn't even look how it should. </s>
<s> I don't think I have a PCI express card because it doesn't have any hangy-downer-things (excuse my unsophistication, that's just how much I need help). </s>
<s> So yeah. </s>
<s> Anybody have any ideas as to why I can't get video? </s>
<s> And where can I find the info Sparkle was asking for me? </s>
<s> (Please bear in mind I do NOT have any manuals. </s>
<s> Which is why I came here.) </s>
<s> Thank yuh! </s>
<s> I won't duplicate the web but why should it work? </s>
<s> You didn't write much about the host machine and maybe it's one you have to change the bios? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
