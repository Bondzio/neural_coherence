thanks for the reply, chris.
i don't have access to the pc's until this coming week, and will check on the local administrator user settings.
i have been over it too many times, but i don't believe that local admin is setup.
good suggestion.
i do know that the printer is shared, and everyone has full access, but i will check again since looking at it so much may have affected my minds eye!!
i will also check (ping?)
the adapters and their status, and see if there is a difference if enabled or disabled.
i'm hoping to allow pc1 and pc3 to have the laser printer on pc2 as an option in file, print, just like the big canon color copier/printer.
thanks for the advice and possible solutions, and i will let you know as soon as i can get to the machines next week.
have a wonderful new year!
