My computer shows that I have spyware. However when i was able to get into safe mode i ran all my stuff to remove it and it seemed fine. However, now when I turn my computer on it asks me to long into my account. However, my name is the only one that appears at the beggining with no opportunity to put in a password. I click on my account and it says loading settings, however when it starts to load, it then automatically starts to log out. WHen i try to start in safe mode the two accounts that come up are administrator and then my name. Once again i click on my name and it does the same thing. However the administrator option allows me to put in a password but i do not know what that is.Does that make sense?
