My old one was an Integrated NVidia that is forever onboard as far as I can tell, and the new video card is an ATI Radeon 7000. I installed it, and it seems to be working all right as far as everything goes. I recently went to play a game, LineageII. I knew I fell somewhere between the minimum and maximum requirements, so I went to play and it told me that my AGP was deactivated, and to enable it for consistency. When I'd start the game, the screen would go black. I figured I'd better enable my AGP -- however, when I went to do so I realized I had no frickin' clue how to do it. I tried to do it through DirectX, but it's greyed out. When I tried to do it in Bios, my Bios said NOTHING about any AGP but at the same time I haven't an idea what to look for and modify thus I got really confused. I've been trying for two days now to figure something out without ruining my computer Help! I know I run an ASUS motherboard. My Bios type -- I don't know but it says &quot;ev 1004/aa&quot; under revision type and something about Pheonix Award Bios Setup. I am so lost! Help me!
