But no matter what I try...it won't let me get online. I have tried setting the TCP/IP Protocol to Obtain IP and Obtain DNS automatically, but to no avail. The weird thing is...I can establish the wireless signal without a problem, WEP and all. The wireless ready laptop (802.11g) simply won't allow me to connect to the internet wirelessly or via the LAN. Even when I Run the cmd prompt and try to run a &quot;ping&quot;...I get nothing. Also, the IP address listed in the ipconfig function comes back as 0.0.0.0 Anyone have any ideas what additional means I may explore to establish connectivity? I have been systematically removing a series of viruses and Trojan Horse Downloaders - could that have an impact? I was able to get online two days ago via the LAN, before I started to remove the viruses. Any insight would be much appreciated. Thanks, -S
