I recently found it in my uncle's attic and he said it hadn't been used in years and he didn't know the condition of the battery. Sure enough, the last power outage the battery lasted for about 10 seconds and died. Now i want to know if it would be better if I got a new battery for this UPS or if i got a new (maybe better) ups. The only things connected to the battery part are my monitor and tower. I think what caused the battery to die so fast was that my computer has 2 HD's 2 cd drives and 4 fans w/LED's. Everything connected to it is outlet powered, except the mouse, kbd, webcam and joystick. Its a AMD Sempron 2600 if thats relevent at all. My monitor is a compaq 7500 CRT, but i'm planning to upgrade to a 20in LCD HDTV that i've already picked out. Should i get a new battery, and if so, what kind? Or should i just get a new, better UPS? Help is MUCH appreciated.

As batteries age and do get used, the uptime for safe shutdown is reduced plus any added devices attached, the time is further reduced. Check with APC for the specs on that model and determine what the time frames for devices attached is the uptime given. Weight these factors and go from there. Better UPS do provide basic surge protection, so if it got &quot;hit&quot; expect a lessen or defeated surge protection and a only a new UPS will do after that. tada -----Willy
