and submenus.
I read that old systems might not be able to boot from the Windows OS cd.
I tried using the floppy to boot but I think that my floppy drive is defective.
My system tells me that there is a Pri HDD error, then it tells me to insert a floppy to boot.
I downloaded the correct Windows boot floopy download from Microsoft.com, transferred what I downloaded to floppies, inserted them in the floppy drive, and the drive won't read the floppies.
I really need step by step instructions on how to make my BIOS read the cd-rom drive.
