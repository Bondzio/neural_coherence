i'm a big tron nerd so was really looking at the tron keyboard by razer, but it appears to be a terrible keyboard unless you only want to look at it.
bummer.
i got to thinking though i really do need a new keyboard.
i'm not an expert, but i believe i need a mechanical keyboard.
i see a lot of discussion about &quot;cherry&quot; and &quot;switches&quot;.
i can type pretty fast and am beginning to see how inefficient my old microsoft keyboard is and how hard i have to press to type.
i'm looking for effortless and responsive typing.
i do a ton of typing and want high end all around great typing.
that being said i want it to look outstanding as well.
cool lighting is much preferred.
so far the only keyboard i have found online to be mechanical and have neat lighting is the black widow ultimate, but again i am not an expert and can use any and all advice you all have on keyboards.
please let me know what is out there that would be good for me.
i appreciate the help!
