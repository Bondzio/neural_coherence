I looked at it last night and didn't notice a spot for it, but I'm not the brightest bulb in the bunch. It is a version 1 iPad and I have wireless and ATT for road trips. It has always worked well. I have not attempted a restore...how would I do that? Thank you very much for replying...I really appreciate it.

I have an Apple Repair shop across the street from my office. I'll stop by there and see what they say. Thank you again for your help...it is appreciated.

The guy at AT&amp;T replaced the card and it began to work again. It was a slightly different card than what is used for phones. Thank you all again for your suggestions.
