Well, thanks for all the help guys ...
The firewall was modified to only allow my two computers to be in the trusted zone.
I attempted pinging each to the other PC and it was successful.
However, now, I can see only my workgroup computer for the ME machine ONLY on the ME machine and the shared folders I set up.
But, on XP, no folders at all when I try to view the workgroup, not even the XP machine is shown.
Instead, I get an error like &quot;Can't access, not allowed to see computers on this network..&quot; or something like that.
Is that due to not allowing PTP networking?
If so, should I try the above fix?
Thanks.
