...that's why I bought them (drive & software) in the first place.
Software has been successfully installed, I am using Veritas BE 9.1, the original was 7.3(!).
I do have the NT book and have been studying it, I have been keeping the machine alive and would sure like to try to install this puppy myself.
Maybe a brief how-to?
