1.1.1	I have a Dell Dimension 4300 with 2 hard drives an 80 gig and a 40 gig.	St
1.1.2	All of a sudden I get the subject error message.	St
1.1.3	System lites up and I see the Dell screen then it beeps twice and posts the error message and F1 to continue, F2 to go to setup.	St
1.1.4	Tried both but keep coming back to same error.	St
1.1.5	I've reversed the drives (Master/Slave) and still get it.	St
1.1.6	I can't believe that both drives died at the same time.	St
1.1.7	When power is on with case open I can feel vibration in the drives as though they are spinning.	St
1.1.8	Cooling fans are running.	St
1.1.9	Checked power leads to drives with VOM and detect voltage present.	St
1.1.10	Where do I start CPU?/Motherboard?/ BIOS?	St
1.1.11	Any help appreciated.	St
1.2.1	In the Bios to see if the drives are properly seen.	St
1.2.2	Then a new 80 pin cable.	St
1.2.3	Then try the second IDE controller.	Sug
1.3.1	I suggest you reseat the HD cables several times and check results.	St
1.3.2	Try another HD cable(new?).	St
1.3.3	Try with only one HD installed, the other disconnected entirely but not removed.	St
1.3.4	make sure jumper reflect what that brand should be for solo HD.	Sug
1.3.5	If you had this system for sometime, maybe the bios(CMOS) battery is weak, replace.	St
1.3.6	tada -----Willy	St
1.4.1	but the cable itself has 80 conductors.	St
1.4.2	[40 extra ground wires].	St
1.5.1	Thanks this did it one at a time I installed the drives and discovered that the 15 month old 60gig hard drive is dead.	St
1.5.2	I repaired the installation of Win XP on the 40gig drive and system is back up and running.	St
1.5.3	Thanks to all for your help.	St
1.5.4	Jim	St
