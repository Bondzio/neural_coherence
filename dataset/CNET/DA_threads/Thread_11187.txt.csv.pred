1.1.1	I just got an Acer Ferrari laptop , and am trying to connect to my home wireless network .	St
1.1.2	I have a netgear router , and the Ferrari sees the network , but when I try to connect to the network , it just says & quot ; waiting for network. & quot ; I have tried twiddling with all the network 's features to try to get it to work , does anyone have any advice on how to solve this problem ?

1.2.1	to & quot ; Obtain your IP and DNS automatically & quot ; .	St
1.3.1	Thanks for replying , It is set to get them automatically ...	St
1.4.1	I always recommend turning off all encryption , MAC filtering , etc .	St
1.4.2	security settings when trying to get a new WiFi network established .	St
1.4.3	Get it to work under plain vanilla conditions .	St
1.4.4	Perhaps there is something funky about the driver settings that you need to delete and reinstall the WiFi card driver on the new laptop .	St
1.4.5	Perhaps there is something about the channel .	St
1.4.6	Perhaps there is something about ... and the list could go on .	St
1.4.7	But if mismatched security settings are in the way , you 'll never know what might be wrong because the router and the card will simply refuse to talk to each other , leaving you with no idea why .	St
1.4.8	So turn all that off for now .	St
1.4.9	Get the connection established , and then put the security back on one step at a time .	St
1.4.10	dw	St
1.5.1	I updated the firmware , and got rid of all the security .	St
1.5.2	The laptop then connected no problem , and I was then able to reactivate all of the security .	St
1.5.3	Thanks for all the help .	St
