1.1.1	Ahem!	St
1.1.2	A while back my son-in-law, who is a wonderful fellow but works on a computer from the dark side (PC), was clued into a way to add wireless access to his computer without having an internal card.	St
1.1.3	It was a little thing that looked like a stick, and I believe it was just inserted into a place on the back of the computer.	St
1.1.4	It worked just fine.	St
1.1.5	In some ads for places selling computer supplies, I saw just such a thing (I think), but I (1) don't know whether such a thing exists for Macs and (2) whether my computer--Sawtooth G4 desktop--is compatible with anything now being sold for that purpose.	St
1.1.6	The computer never had an Airport Card, and if I wanted one, I'd have to search for an old one (probably 11b).	St
1.1.7	I think I'd need the older versions of other equipment that goes with such an old card, too, so I was wondering whether that would pertain also to the kind of external wireless device I started talking about here.	St
1.1.8	If I could buy something current, and if it was easy to install, what a blessing that would be!	Sug
1.1.9	Forgive my ignorance.	St
1.1.10	I don't even know what the thing is called, and I am aware that what I'm asking for may be totally out of reach, but hope springs eternal.	St
1.1.11	.	St
1.1.12	.	St
1.1.13	.	St

1.2.1	Here's the google to find compatible USB WIFI client hardware.	St
1.2.2	http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=apple+wifi+usb&btnG=Google+Search Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks, Bob.	St
1.3.2	I read some of the articles from &quot;MacOSX Hints&quot; with a lot of caveats and &quot;buts,&quot; but maybe those problems have been solved now.	St
1.3.3	I also looked at one site offering a variety of dongles.	St
1.3.4	Not sure what characterizes the more expensive ones from the modestly priced ones, and I can't say I really understand all the terms, but when I get a chance, I'll read descriptions and try to decipher it all.	St
1.3.5	Maybe I'll take the plunge, maybe not.	Sug
1.3.6	It's something to consider when I have some more time.	St
1.3.7	I do thank you very much, especially, for leading me to what to Google.	Polite
1.3.8	Now I can return, at a less pressured time, to read more and make a decision.	St
1.3.9	Best, though in haste, jenny	St
