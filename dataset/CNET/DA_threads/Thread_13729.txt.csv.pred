1.1.1	I would like to ask you if it is possible to extent WIFI range with one extra WIFI router .	St
1.1.2	I have one WIFI router which is connected to DSL line with IP address 192.168.254.1 and its LAN IP is set up to 192.168.2.1 and DHCP range from 192.168.2.2 to 192.168.2.30 .	St
1.1.3	Mask is 255.255.255.0 in all cases .	St
1.1.4	I have bought one additional router because the range of antenna was not satisfied and I need to extend the range around couple of meters .	St
1.1.5	Due to it was the most convenient solution for me .	St
1.1.6	The first router is US 125BG and the second one is CNET CWR 854 .	St
1.1.7	All both of them are brand new router and operate perfect as stand alone .	St
1.1.8	Problem is in reconnection all of them .	St
1.1.9	When I tried to connect them together via air they are not so communicative that why I am asking for you help .	St
1.1.10	Despite I have already researched all internet I did not find any proper diagram which can help me in my troubles .	St
1.1.11	I hope that it is possible to use one additional router as an AP .	St
1.1.12	The additional router had following configuration : LAN : IP 192.168.2.40 , Mask 255.255.255.0 , GW 192.168.2.40 WAN only DHCP no any special configuration , perhaps nothing is connected to its WAN port , WIFI method is set up as WDS+AP .	St
1.1.13	If you require any specific information regarding this issue I am ready to support you .	St
1.1.14	Very Many Thank for your Ideas and References , Kind Regards , Martin .	St
1.2.1	But in short you can create a wider area if you use routers as Access Points or APs .	St
1.2.2	This is the Cnet discussion forum ( nothing to do with CNET routers ) so you are not on a CNET ROUTER support site .	St
1.2.3	This is where people discuss things and help another .	St
1.2.4	Since you did n't give links to the manual I 'll just note the usual method .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	I hate it when the forum organizers answer a question .	St
1.3.2	They want to inform you that you are posting in the wrong forum .	St
1.3.3	Soooooo annnoyyyyyinnnnngggg .	St
1.3.4	I would slap you if I could .	St
1.4.1	Since this is a member to member forum , answer the questions of the other members .	St
1.4.2	There is some confusion about the CNET Network products and this forum .	St
1.4.3	A few members DEMANDED support and after too many times of that , I have to make it clear this is not that forum .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	is that this is CNET.com 's forums , not to be confused with CNet USA , which is completely different company and we are not affiliated in anyway with them : CNet USA http : //www.cnetusa.com/eng/index_eng.php CNET.com http : //cnet.com I hope this clears things up .	St
