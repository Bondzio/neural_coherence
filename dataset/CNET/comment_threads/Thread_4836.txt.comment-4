I apologize.
I wasn't getting a response so I thought I would rephrase the subject and better write the comment.
And then I thought I might be in the wrong area(s) for a response.
Anyway, I am not wanting to mess up my computer by doing something I shouldn't but I'm not sure what to do and it isn't letting me do emailing through Outlook (even though it opens up) right now.
