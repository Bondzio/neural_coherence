storage doesn't exist for the reason that conflicts will occur when more than one device attempts to write at the same time.
doesn't matter that your tv is a reader and not a writer, the storage is designed to avoid simultaneous dual connections.
you'll have to research this more on your own time.
nothing neat exists in this space.
the closest device you will find was the buffalo drivestation flexnet.
why past tense?
it's being phased out but still available in some stores.
grab one quick if you deems it meets your needs.
otherwise, buy or construct a pc dlna server and you'll have all types of interfaces to choose from.
good luck.
