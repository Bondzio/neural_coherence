i could not find a specific forum for video/graphic card, so here it goes.
i am thinking about upgrading my graphic card to a sapphire radeon hd 3850 agp card.
on its web site it states the power supply requirement is 450w.
the current power supply on board is only 400w.
so i am wondering if the power supply requirement is &quot;sticky&quot;, or if there's any room to wiggle.
has anybody &quot;exceeded&quot; the power supply requirement and experienced trouble with their machine?
i certainly don't want to upgrade the video card, then have to upgrade my power supply after.
