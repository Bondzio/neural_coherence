<s> Okay I will try and explain this best I can. </s>
<s> I am not a networking pro but I know enough that this is pissing me off and there is probably a real simple fix. </s>
<s> I have access to my linkstation through the browser and I can add folders through that access but when I installed the linkstation it failed to map the drive and it is not showing up in the my computer folder. </s>
<s> Now with that being said I cannot find or use nero to burn something from the drive because it does not see it. </s>
<s> I have not tried mapping the folders on the drive and I do not know if that is even possible so I figured I would ask first before doing anything crazy that I would not be happy with anyway. </s>
<s> I am running NIS 2009 with a Linksys router. </s>
<s> Any and all help will be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I forgot to put the model number HS-DH500GL </s>
