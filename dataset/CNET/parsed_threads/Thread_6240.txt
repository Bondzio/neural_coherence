<s> I had a Maxtor 80g HD in my old Win98SE machine (1Ghz, 748Mb RAM). </s>
<s> It was partitioned 40g/40g. </s>
<s> I added a 2nd Maxtor 80g HD as Master & set the old one to Slave. </s>
<s> I installed WinXP-home on the new C: drive, and when it was 100% working, I copied all data from the (40/40) D: drive to my new C: (side note: I found I could switch boot order in the BIOS & boot to either W98 or WinXP ) I then erased the data & the 2nd partition on the 40/40 D: & used the XP Disk Management to reformat it. </s>
<s> My problem is the D: 40/40 now reads as a 40g HD ! </s>
<s> Nothing I have been able to do can correct this, even the BIOS autodetects it as 40 ! </s>
<s> Help ? </s>
<s> They have some utilities for you to try. </s>
<s> Some allowed us to limit the size of the drive. </s>

<s> Can you give me any titles ? </s>
<s> Go there and search for the downloads. </s>
<s> I didn't do it since this is not support but a discussion site. </s>
