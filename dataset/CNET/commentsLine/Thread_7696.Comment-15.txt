i'm new with all computers too and my first computer was dell i paid $ 1670.95 for things i did not need... but i wanted the program call dell learn... to learn how to play with my new toy.. the very first day , i was on the internet.. the next day i tryed to learn more .. so i went to dell learn.
it took me 6 days ( with the help of dells 1-800 number ) to place my name and password into dell learn... for the next 11 days i tryed to log on ( with the help of the 1-800 number ) i tryed for 45 day or more and still can't get in.. so i call a new 1-800 number for dell and dell told me it's the sofeware and i must call the sofeware co. i told them , i'm calling the sofeware co.. it's dell learning .. dell gave me the round-around... so i called the state of nevada for help , with the help of the state of nevada dell took the computer back and paid for the shiping too.
after i recevied my money back.. i went to apple computer .. now i own a mac g-5 i'm very happy .. if anything goes worng with my apple all i do is call apple 1-800 number and apple will help me fix it.. if apple can't fix my computer over the phone all i do is take my computer to an apple store and apple is very happt to fix it..
