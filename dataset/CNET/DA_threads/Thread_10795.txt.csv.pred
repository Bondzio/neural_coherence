1.1.1	I am using an AMD Athlon X2 4600+ on an MSI K9A Platinum motherboard and Vist Home Premium.	St
1.1.2	I don't even know if I have a problem.	St
1.1.3	I was browsing device manager and under cpu the Athlon X2 4600+ is listed twice which I assumed was once for each core.	St
1.1.4	The bottom listing has the yellow exclamation point and clicking on it delivers the message: &quot;this device cannot start (Code 10).	St
1.1.5	AMD tech said to upgrade BIOS but I just put this machine together and no update is available yet but the board is already supposed to support this chip.	St
1.1.6	Apparently the Code 10 is a Microsoft message or an MSI message because it meant nothing to the AMD tech.	St
1.1.7	Any suggestions will be appredciated.	St
1.1.8	My machine is running fine but I'm not sure if I'm only using half of my cpu.	St
