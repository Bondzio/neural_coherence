Hello, I have 4 laptops (3 vista and one XP), and a Netgear WGR614 (it came with the virgin connection).
I wanna play counterstrike by connecting all the four laptops wireless.
Please tell me how to connect all the laptops for gameplay.
A step-by-step instruction would be very helpful as i'm not an expert with computers.
Thanks in advance.
