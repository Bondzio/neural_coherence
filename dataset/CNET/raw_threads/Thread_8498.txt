He turned out to be a ******* so since then, I'm the techy. A day ago the computer started to make beeping noises with 8 seconds between each beep... It just beeps on and on and on... I changed the CMOS battery, cleaned the RAM area, switched sticks, switched Keyboard, the video card is built in the motherboard. I don't know what company the motherboard is.. there's no sticker or logo anywhere in site. the PC monitor turns on and says CHECK SIGNAL CABLE. The guy who built the PC gave us no documantions about anything... ( manuals etc.) What do I do?!?

While there are plenty of web sites to note how to install the CPU heatsink proper I can't supply the right one given so little about the machine. You could look at the motherboard to find it's make and model. Please be aware I won't respond if you ask me how to find the make/model without opening the machine since to fix this we will be going inside the box. Bob

7191	3	221124	2336036	2336002	R. Proffitt	12/1/06 1:49 PM	1.16498094E12	Tools.	Both found with google.com BELARC ADVISOR EVEREST But time and time again I open the box and ID the motherboard. I never give up on finding the markings. But leave the cover off for now until you can sort out the issues or get the CPU fan working (you are not telling details...) Bob

7191	5	221124	2336465	2336075	PSPer	12/2/06 3:13 AM	1.16502918E12	Details	The CPU fan is running fine... all the fans run, and all the connections are OK. Each time I open the PC it starts up and just beeps. The PC monitor says CHECK SIGNAL CABLE. I highly doubt the CPU overheated because the computer is used just for surfing the web and playing Freecell. The Video card and Sound card are built on the motherboard. There is only one RAM stick ( It's connected OK ). http://www.computerhope.com doesn't help because none of the beeps they wrote down match my beeping. its just long beeps every 8 seconds and don't stop until I shutdown the PC.
7191	6	221124	2336531	2336465	R. Proffitt	12/2/06 6:42 AM	1.16504172E12	Sorry, I'm not there.	So you have to be our eyes and ears plus use supplied tools and report back gritty details. You didn't tell if you left to cover off and if it had any effect. You may not have checked the fan for proper seating. And I see no report output from the supplied softwares that help you determine what is in the machine. Once we get a board make/model we go get it's manual and see what the beep code means. This may sound crass but it's to motivate you and explain something. This is not tech support. It's free support so you have to get out and push along or you won't get to the bottom of the issue. It's either a heat issue or there is a fan sensor that isn't working. In the CPU fan there is a new thing with 3 wires. 2 are for power the third is the CPU RPM sensor. If someone ran that to the wrong connection something like that can happen. But all this guessing vanishes if we can get to the make/model then the manual of the motherboard. Apply yourself a little with the resources noted and I'm pretty sure we'll cure the beep issue and maybe other items. Bob

The fans run and the beeping starts and the PC monitor says CHECK SIGNAL CABLE. I've checked every inch of the motherboard. No logo, no company name, nothing. Thanks for the patience Bob.
7191	8	221124	2336803	2336783	R. Proffitt	12/2/06 1:45 PM	1.1650671E12	OK, more guesses.	That beeping with no boot is typical when... 1. There is no RAM installed. Your machine's maker could have done a dirty deed and taken some RAM out? Again, I don't have a clear story so I'm guessing. 2. The video card is not fully seated. Power off and unplugged then gently reseat the video card if it has one. Same for any other card or connection. Bob
7191	9	221124	2337062	2336803	PSPer	12/3/06 1:55 AM	1.1651109E12	Cards	The Video Card is built on the mother board... The RAM is in it's place... I even switched places and cleaned it. Anymore guesses?
7191	10	221124	2337217	2337062	R. Proffitt	12/3/06 8:24 AM	1.16513424E12	No more guesses. Time to pull the board out and share.	Any and all markings. If it is indeed void of make and model, replace it. Bob

First off..to TEST a Monitor/unplug its Cable(DIN)from the back of the PC..and useing its AC-120volt Power cable Plugged in..Turn-ON the CRT and a NO-INPUT sign should be showing.. .......ALWAYS...dis-connect AC-power when inspecting your PC.......... As for the BEEPING SOUNDS.....depends on the MotherBoard design....... My PC gives off BEEPS when NO SOUND CARD DRIVER is installed.......... Also a BEEP sound could be a &quot;SHORT&quot;/maybe NOT...but Maybe-yes........ If you even OWN this machine you need DOCUMENTATION:like the Boxes that the PARTS came in....the PART Numbers....and RECEIPTS.... ...................................................................... You could possibly have a &quot;butcher&quot; JOB...where the parts from differant machines were thrown together and its actually a Rip-OFF.. ...................................................................... I would NOT tamper w/this purchase or what-ever you did to bring it into your house.. ...................................................................... I would move to take the TECHY to small claims court..get your money back..or get your DOCUMENTATION.. You can NOT operate a PC DeskTop w/o SPECIFICATIONS..or software CD's or the OS..CD..or security software....or an ISP.... ...................................................................... First Things First.. right off you've been had.

Most of your comments where made pointless by the very message you where responding to. Read then answer and try to have a little class, condescension sucks ya jerk.

You come off like a know it all jerk that can't be bothered to read through the messages without posting your condescending answers. It's not about content as much as professionalism and respect for your members.
7191	17	221124	2457994	2337217	R. Proffitt	4/12/07 2:10 PM	1.176387E12	Then welcome.	Feel free to pitch in. But I'll only write this one time. These are your first posts so you may have something you need to get out. Feel free to make a new post, get it over with so we can work on the issues. If you feel you have the answer, please share it. Bob
