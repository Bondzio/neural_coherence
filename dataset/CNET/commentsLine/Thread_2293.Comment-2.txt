do you mean usb ports (the female connector on the computer) or usb flash drives?
the two are very different things if it has power, it should be working, given that the internal headers can only connect one way and provide power (and therefore a working signal) so i'd vote for software problem or system board oddity (as in, low quality connectors, or something similar)
