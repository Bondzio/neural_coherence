Not sure what I need in a new computer.
Run Microsoft Office, put photos on hard drive, make music and photo CD's, use flight simulator and other types of software with designing, cookbooks, etc.
Also use ZoneAlarm for firewall and virus protection.
I really only need a new pcu.
I have a HP pentium 4 1.6GHz speed, windows XP home, 128 ram.
Someone told me about Atholon vs Pentium processor - don't know which I should get.
Also, what type of graphics card should I be looking at?
Main reason for change is that flight simulator runs slow and the scenery could be better.
