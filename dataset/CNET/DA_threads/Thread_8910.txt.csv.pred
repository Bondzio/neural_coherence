1.9.1	Your post is plagued by typos, and that makes it a little bit difficult to search for a possible solutions.	St
1.9.2	Is it &quot;the drive&quot; or &quot;the driver&quot; that can't be accessed?	St
1.9.3	Is it &quot;inexcessible&quot; or &quot;inaccessible&quot; or &quot;inaccessable&quot;?	St
1.9.4	Is it &quot;a permission&quot; or &quot;permission&quot;?	St
1.9.5	Is it &quot;dont&quot; or &quot;don't&quot; or &quot;do not&quot; The best result for the moment: http://quickbooksgroup.com/webx/forums/Working%20with%20the%20Data%20File/Permissions%20and%20Setting%20Up%20Users/65 and http://quickbooksgroup.com/webx?14@@.ef84721/9 but I doubt if they apply.

1.9.6	Other interesting finds: http://www.pcreview.co.uk/forums/thread-280096.php (hard disk full) http://www.theeldergeek.com/forum/lofiversion/index.php?t11542.html (not using an empty cd-r) http://club.cdfreaks.com/f91/internet-download-file-save-lg-5163-drive-132235/ (no solution at all) http://www.derkeiler.com/Newsgroups/microsoft.public.windowsxp.security_admin/2003-02/1835.html (no solution either) It's not even clear the message has anything to do with the dvd-writer.	St
1.9.7	There are a lot of examples without any mention of burning.	St
1.9.8	- Did you try it in Safe Mode already?	St
1.9.9	- Is there any other burning software installed (or recently uninstalled)?	Ques
1.9.10	Kees	St
1.10.1	thanks for sending the link.	Polite
1.10.2	i installed the burnrights, however, still no luck.. Any other suggestions?	St
1.11.1	INCD used to but with restrictions.	St
1.11.2	I've yet to determine what you are using to support &quot;packet writing&quot; or if you formatted the media first with INCD.	St

1.13.1	Thanks for your detailed reply.	St
1.13.2	Let me first answer your questions then I will update you with my progress *** The exact message I got is: Save image file Image You do not have permission to save in this directory.	St
1.13.3	See the administrator to obtain permission Would you like to save in the my document folder instead?	St
1.13.4	(yes) (No) *** I use nero burner version 5 and as R Proffitt suggested I installed nero burner rights but still no luck.	St
1.13.5	***I also tried Dragn Drop CD+DVD Version 3.0.	St
1.13.6	The message I get is please insert a valid or a blank CD.	Sug
1.13.7	code: 011-02-1028.	St
1.13.8	May I also mention that Drag'n Drop is trying to write on drive D (hard drive) but my CD writer is drive E. I cant manage to make Drag'n Drop use drive E. *** As for burning software uninstalled.	St
1.13.9	I recently uninstalled nero burner version 8 (because it kept asking me for a licence expiry) *** I am the only user to the computer and I have no password to set up!	St
1.13.10	**************************************** As for the link: * Link1: http://quickbooksgroup.com/webx/forums/Working%20with%20the%20Data%20File/Permissions%20and%20Setting%20Up%20Users/65 Copying from a backup copy from desktop doesnt work with me either.	St
1.13.11	And if I just drag the copy directly to the cd, I got a message E:\ is not accessible.	St
1.13.12	Incorrect function * link 2: http://quickbooksgroup.com/webx?14@@.ef84721/9 One guy was able to back up after selecting partial verification of data.	St
1.13.13	Not sure how to do that..?!	Res
1.13.14	* link3: http://www.pcreview.co.uk/forums/thread-280096.php I tried to use a previously used CD RW and to free spaces on the CD but it wont allow me to delete files from cd and it mentions files are read only!!	St
1.13.15	Link 4: http://club.cdfreaks.com/f91/internet-download-file-save-lg-5163-drive-132235 HORRAY..	St
1.13.16	The hint of chas0039 was a great step forward.	St
1.13.17	For some reason my burner was not enabled for CD recording (in the properties tab)!!!!	St
1.13.18	I have no clue why this happened.	St
1.13.19	The only thing I can think of is the reinstallation window xp a few weeks ago.	St
1.13.20	(I hope Microsoft didnt make the default not to enable cd recording!!)	St
1.13.21	HOWEVER, when I tried to record to the cd, it recorded the files (or folders) as image.nrg !	St
1.13.22	I am not sure whats wrong now but I would value your expertise..	St
1.13.23	Thanks	Polite
1.14.1	My last message was related to the use of Nero version 5.	St
1.14.2	May I also mention that when I use Drag n Drop version 3, the message I get is D. please insert a valid or a blank disc.	St
1.14.3	Insert a disc.	St
1.14.4	(Code 011-02-1028).	St
1.14.5	Then the cd ejects itself then I get a message: the disc was not successfully verified.	St
1.14.6	(Code 011-02-1030).	St
1.14.7	Well, my cd is drive E not D. Not sure whats happening.	St
1.15.1	See for example: http://club.cdfreaks.com/f48/nero-burning-image-nrg-136177/ What exactly are you trying to burn, and how exactly do you do it?	St
1.15.2	As detailed as possible, please, so I can replay your actions here.	St
1.15.3	Kees	St
1.16.1	Thanks for your help I use nero burner 5.5.9.9. what I do is: * I open the nero express * I get nero express window: - under which recorder would you like to use I get one option which is image recorder [CDR-RW] (Im not sure is it ok that nero calls my cd writer as an image writer) - under what would you like to burn I choose data then data disc * in the disc content window: I add a word document file * I then click next * I then get final burn setting window: - Under the current recorder, I get one option which is image recorder [CDR-RW] - Under the disc name sometimes I leave it blank - the followings are shaded grey and I cant tick or use them: title (cd text), artist (cd text), Number of copies, Allow file to be added later (multisession disc) and modify data on disc after burning * I click burn * I get the save image file window * I choose to save the image on the hard drive.	St
1.16.2	* under save as type, I tried to save as nero image file *.ngr and I also tried all files *.	St
1.16.3	* * I click save * I get a message: burn process completed successfully * I then exit * I then get a message - which I dont understand- asking save changes to ISO-1?	St
1.16.4	I tried yes and no.	St
1.16.5	but no luck * I then open nero again and under what would you like to burn I choose disc image or saved project * I open my nrg image file * I get the image record window * the destination drive is always image recorder [CDR-RW] (this is the only allowed option * writing speed and number of copies are shaded grey and not in use.	St
1.16.6	*I click next * I get the save image file window * I choose to save the image on cd writer drive (drive E) * under save as type I only get two options nero image file *.ngr and all files *.	St
1.16.7	* I choose all files *.	St
1.16.8	* * I click save * I get a message burn process completed successfully * I exit nero * I go to my computer, then E drive * in the E drive I found my file under files ready to be written to the cd And it is .nrg.	St
1.16.9	When I double click on it, nero opens and I get the image record window with its only option is to burn another .nrg image!!!!!!!!!	St
1.16.10	!	St
1.17.1	Thanks for your clear explanation.	St
1.17.2	When I try it here, I not only get &quot;image writer&quot; option on the first screen, but also the expected D: followed by make and model number of the drive.	St
1.17.3	I never used the &quot;image writer&quot; option, I didn't even know it existed.	St
1.17.4	It can be used to burn an image of the CD-to-be to the hard disk, so that it can be burned to CD faster in a second pass.	St
1.17.5	So the problem seems to be that your E:-drive isn't recognized as a burner, but somehow as kind of a hard disk.	St
1.17.6	It doesn't appear in the list of devices you can burn to and all you've got is to make an image on that particular hard disk.	St
1.17.7	And so on.	St
1.17.8	Obviously something is wrong.	St
1.17.9	The first thing to try is to delete the e:-drive in Device Manager, reboot and let Windows do its job to recognize it and load the necessary drivers.	Sug
1.17.10	You might need the Windows XP CD for that.	St
1.17.11	If that doesn't help, you've got to make a rather difficult choice between: a.	St
1.17.12	Replace the drive by a new one and repeat the previous operation.	St
1.17.13	If it was some hardware error, it will be solved now.	St
1.17.14	Otherwise turn to b. b.	St
1.17.15	Assume it isn't a hardware error but some unclear problem in Windows XP.	St
1.17.16	Then you'd better do a clean install of the OS.	St
1.17.17	If that doesn't help, turn to a.	St
1.17.18	With a clean install of Windows and a new drive, it's more than likely it will work as intended.	St
1.17.19	But it's a complete guess which of the two will do the trick.	St
1.17.20	Moreover, there's a small (but definitely &gt; 0) chance that another burning application will work (or give a better error message at least).	St
1.17.21	Try www.cdburnerxp.se.	St
1.17.22	It's free, so all it costs is some time.	St
1.17.23	If it works, use that.	St
1.17.24	If it doesn't work, uninstall Nero and try again.	St
1.17.25	If it still doesn't work back to above a or b.	St
1.17.26	Hope this helps, and please let us know if you solved it.	Sug
1.17.27	Kees	St
1.18.1	Kees, Many thanks for your help.... That was great; I can now burn ok...	Polite
1.18.2	I tried deleting the E drive but didnt work.	St
1.18.3	I then installed cdburnerxp and it is working perfect.	St
1.18.4	Not sure what the problem was but anyway Im happy now.	St
1.18.5	Kees, may I kindly ask for another favour, it is regarding wireless network (its ok if you want me to mail in another forum).	St
1.18.6	I have a 3 years old lap top.	St
1.18.7	As far as I understand its wireless enabled (but Im not sure about that).	St
1.18.8	Last week I went to a Wi-Fi spot in a near by public library but couldn't get connected online.	St
1.18.9	Two staff members tried to sort the problem but no luck.	St
1.18.10	They told me I may need to buy a wireless adaptor!	St
1.18.11	I also tried to call regenerate IT technical support but was useless.	St
1.18.12	My question is: how can I know if my PC has got a built in wireless adaptor and it is enabled for Wi-Fi connection Thanks again for your help J	St
