8347	0	329830	2976453	NR	hollyfurby	2/10/09 9:23 PM	1.23430098E12	wireless on laptop	I bought a Gateway laptop and I am wondering how to get wireless. I already have a few computers hooked up to a cable modem and and Linskeys wired router. I have a wii and that runs wireless off of the Linskeys router. Is this all I need for the laptop?

Suggest you read the router manual and have a look at the networking setup in Windows on the laptop and make sure the laptop's wireless switch (usually on the side of the case) is in the ON position. If Vista it should be pretty simple to connect.
