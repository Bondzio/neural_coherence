Hi I am a computer programmer and I would like to buy a Big Screen TV for a computer monitor.
The question I have is this a good idea and if so which kind should I get an LCD or Plasma.
What should the specs of the tv should be ie...resolution, 1080, 720.
I would really like to hear from anyone that has done this.
I don't want to pay $3000 on a 1080i 50&quot; plazma tv only to find that it does not work as a computer monitor.
Please help Thank you
