I had to order a restoral disk.
I was never aware that I had a raid system, I didn't even know what raid was.The restoral disk fixed my system but now I have only one 120 gig hard drive.
I assume that my system has been operating as a regular computer and one of my drives is dead.
What happens if I add another drive, I need more space.
If I replace the dead drive, will my system try to reconfigure?
Could I lose all my data again?
