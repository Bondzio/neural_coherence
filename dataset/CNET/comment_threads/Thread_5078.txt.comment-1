So basically i got a job as an IT this summer to get some money so i can build myself a nicer computer.
I did some planning and came up with what i think is a nice system.
If you have any suggestions/changes/experiences please post.
Here's what im looking at getting: AMD Athlon 64 FX-57 1024 MB Corsair TwinX DDR400 ASUS A8N-SLI Deluxe 2 x 250 GB Western Digital SATAII, RAID0 2 x Gigabyte 7800 GTX Liteon 16X16 Double Layer DVD+/RW Soundblaster Audigy 2 ZS Gamer Cooler Master Centurion 5 Case Enermax 600 Watt SLI-Ready PSU It adds up to like $4000, so i wanna make sure there isnt anything im missing... Zalman Silent Cooler (92mm)
