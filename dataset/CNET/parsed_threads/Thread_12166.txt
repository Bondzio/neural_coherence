<s> 80 conductor cables. </s>
<s> If they weren't your mobo will tell you that they aren't if you are using any drive of ATA 66 or above. </s>
<s> They also will be keyed such that the end connector is Master [for CS] and the middle connector is the slave. </s>
<s> That's all they are, ribbon wire, slit and bundled neatly in round form. </s>
<s> Same = Same. </s>
<s> Use the master / slave pinning as you normally would. </s>
