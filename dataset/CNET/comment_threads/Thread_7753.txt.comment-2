Whether you can do this or not depends on your computer (specifically your graphics card) and your TV (specifically it's video inputs).
You can do this if any of the following are true: * Your graphics card has S-Video out and your TV has S-Video in.
(Average quality.)
* Your graphics card has composite video out and your TV has composite video in.
* Your graphics card has a DVI-I connector, as does your high-tech TV.
If none of the above are true, you can still do it if you connect your TV and computer to a network, but the hardware would be more expensive than a new graphics card.
Hope this helps, John
