looks like a pretty decent system, although 2g of memory is a little overboard in our opinion.
i would go with 1g and add a second hdd for backup.
as for &quot;vista&quot;, like i said: wait 9 months or so.
after just finishing with more &quot;vista&quot; seminars, no matter how great the new features &quot;may&quot; be, i would prefer to see more bugs worked out (of which there are quite a few as usual) of the os 'before&quot; spending big money on it and jeopardizing my system.
since you're in india, have you checked out the lg fhn-n59dm1b system?
supposed to be a high-end gaming system that's the talk of the town.
i didn't find out much about it on the internet.
noise; unless you go with extremely high end parts (for the recording/radio station, etc.
industry) there will always be some noise.
the recommendations to insulate the case are great to deaden the sound, but disastrous for heat dissipation and control (you'll need an air conditioning setup blowing directly into the pc; less computer noise, more ac noise!).
don't go with insulating ideas.
a good case, good, low-noise case/component fans are the only inexpensive way to try to alter sound (afterall, the harddrive isn't exactly quiet either).
since you didn't mention the brand of mobo, it isn't known how great the sound will be with onboard audio.
you might want to consider purchasing a plug-in sound card.
also, the speakers you listed are 2.1 version speakers, no subwoofer volume control or headphone jack.
i don't know if that makes any difference to you or not.
an ati x1800xt is pretty equal (&quot;maybe&quot; a little better) to the gf 6800 you listed.
i don't know what your price over there is, however.
a crt monitor is still the only way to go for real gaming and will remain so for some time.
overall, your system looks pretty good.
i look forward to any response you might have to this posting!
