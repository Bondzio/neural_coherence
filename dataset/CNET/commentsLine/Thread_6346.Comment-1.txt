hey folks just wanted to know if there are dedicated usb servers?
i'm not sure if that's what they are called but basically i am looking to hook up a couple of external hard drives to a wireless network.
i also plan on attaching a printer as well.
i have found dedicated printer servers, but haven't been able to find just a usb one.
i know of a couple wireless routers that have usb ports built in but that will be a last resort.
thanks for your help.
