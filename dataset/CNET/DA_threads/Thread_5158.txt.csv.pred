1.2.1	Your post is not unlike a link I'll offer.	St

1.3.1	I had exactly the same problem with two laptops I had networked previously using a wired connection.	St
1.3.2	After changing to a wireless connection with Belkin router and network card I had no end of trouble sharing files.	St
1.3.3	I got into no end of a mess trying to make it work, and eventually couldn't even access some folders on one machine on or off the network.	St
1.3.4	I took my usual step when nothing else seems to work and formatted both machines and started again.	St
1.3.5	Making sure they both had the same workgroup names was all I needed to do other than running the XP network &quot;wizard&quot; to make it all work perfectly.	St
1.3.6	I concluded there must have been some conflict with the original wired setup.	St
