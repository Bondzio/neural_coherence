<s> I need a main stream desktop PC for emailing, web surfing, etc. </s>
<s> Just very basic. </s>
<s> I don't game or record music. </s>
<s> Anyone here have positive or negative comments about HP that I should know about? </s>
<s> I've narrowed it down to either Dell or HP. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> AMD processors and better selection of hardware 2. </s>
<s> Regular hardware (Some Dell hardware is proprietary i.e power supplies, $$$$ to replace) 3. </s>
<s> You can buy them in retail stores 4. </s>
<s> Retail store support (Staples, Bestbuy, Circuitcity, etc. </s>
<s> are authorized dealers and repair centers, warranty work can be done there) 5. </s>
<s> And the Dell printers that they throw in for free, you can't find the ink anywhere... And for some comments on Dell, just search &quot;Dell&quot; in these forums and see what you get. </s>
<s> Horrible tech support. </s>
<s> Buy HP. </s>
<s> Their Pavilion series seems well suited for you. </s>
<s> I agree, i've been using HP since Jan. 2001, this is my second machine, ( the other one still works fine). </s>
<s> I can burn CD's and watch DVD's and the thing only cost around $600. </s>
<s> I wouldn't have anything else, except for when I get ready to build one myself. </s>
<s> all i have to say is they are reliable. </s>
<s> also when one of the computers drive broke, they sent a replacement pertty fast </s>
<s> I bought an HP Pavilion in May, and bouight one 2 weeks ago for my wife. </s>
<s> In addition, I own 3 HP printers, 2 HP digicams and an HP scanner. </s>
<s> I have had a couple of annoyances with their offshore support, but alls well that ends well and I am very satisfied with HP. </s>
