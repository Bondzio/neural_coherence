If you have a true mobile or laptop only cpu setup, it just can't be swapped in most cases. Also, you may have a supported cpu, but your &quot;setup&quot; is mounted on some laptop pcb or such that the cpu is soldered to and not socketed. Until you can see and hold in your hand the cpu itself and look at it's &quot;stock number&quot; after cleaning the cpu package will it all make sense. tada -----Willy
