good points... but what is the solution to large backups on a (relatively) slow backbone network?
if the hardware only supports transfers of 5mb/sec (40mbps) you're looking at 18gb/hr (432gb/day), not exactly zipping along - and certainly not enough to backup a tb drive every night.
am i thinking about this wrong?
is there technology that helps?
differential backups maybe?
but you still need full archives from time to time, eh?
help!
