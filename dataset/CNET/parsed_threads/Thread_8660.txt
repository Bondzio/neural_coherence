<s> Also, the gpu is not set in stone I'm willing to pay a little less for something without directx 11 support but with an hdmi port. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I like Corsair and there's plenty of models to choose from at your source of supply. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Your building your own,so your not stupid,and you believe in yourself...that's all i need to know.You've read the specs on each part to insure compatibility. </s>
<s> I looked up what i'd get on a $394 budget: -MSI MB w/o video.Has 4 RAM slots,and two PCI-X 16x slots. </s>
<s> $49 -AMD Phenom 3-Core 3.0GHz CPU..crap,out of stock for good. </s>
<s> $70 -Rosewill Green 700WT power supply w/crossfire . </s>
<s> $79 -1GB video card (might grab two) $68 ea -Seagate Barracuda 7200rpm 1000GB H.D. </s>
<s> $69 -G.SKILL Ripjaws 4GB DDR3 1600mhz RAM (2 sticks for now) $59 Using my old hardware & operating system,4-bay case,burner,and roms. </s>
<s> [NOT buying a 6-core CPU,too much $] $394 COMPLETE. </s>
<s> immune to making mistakes (or just plain poor choices) by mismatching RAM, CPU types/Sockets, PSUs, etc.,. </s>
<s> By posting here or elsewhere, at least they have a chance of someone spotting those errors and helping them avoid an incompatible product or find a compatible or better product for the use intended. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Sound like a good gaming pc, checkout my future build </s>
<s> I wasn't giving the rookie a hard time....and yes,it's smart to post even the dumbest of questions.The only stupid question is the one not asked. </s>
<s> It's easy to misinterpret,or take text out of context...one can sound snotty,or like a 'know it all' when it wasn't intended that way. </s>
<s> Your comment is fine,and sounded respectfull....maybe mine sounds snotty,if so,i apologize. </s>
<s> proposed new as well as upgrade configs where the CPU doesn't go with the MB and more often where the RAM is DDR2 and MB only accepts DDR3. </s>
<s> Also see a fair number of instances where the PSU doesn't support the HW identified or if it worked...it wouldn't have lasted long. </s>
<s> Wonder how the poster's build went ? </s>
<s> Happy New Year VAPCMD </s>
