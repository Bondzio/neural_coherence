My GTX480 has recently passed on ( Rip ).
However, I need to get my PC up and running pretty soon.
I don't really need an upgrade but I need something able to run at the same speeds or better than that of the 480.
I do game and do some rendering.
The catch: I need it for 200 or less.
Any help is appreciated.
Thanks!
