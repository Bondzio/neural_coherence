That's not going to narrow down the issue and the statement &quot;The following deivces will not install properly&quot; doesn't spark the neurons either. Could you expand this post with a model number, version numbers of current drivers for motherboard, sound, DirectX and more? All ERROR MESSAGES in &quot;quoted format&quot; helps the forum help you out. Bob

I've done everything ATI has suggested me to do. I previously had a ATI AIW 7500 in this comp months back and had the same prob but fixed it by installing drivers off my motherboard cd. I've formatted since then, and got this other card in here (no longer have access to the 7500). I don't have the motherboard cd anymore, but I installed everything properly off ecs's website.

I see people install any number of pests such as you find with this discussion -&gt; http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6132-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=1313&start=0 But if ATI can't document a fix and this is what I've used to fix this issue, I wonder if you'll have to wipe the OS out and try again? Sorry, but that error has been encountered firsthand and those links are what I use. Bob
172	6	5217	64125	61866	tcantrelln	12/10/03 1:30 PM	1.071063E12	We have	Had some ATI aiw's at work and n_e_v_e_r got any of them to work- on 2000 or XP, 2 were rma's that they were able to verify bad when they had them back- replacements don't work either- gave up months ago. Told PHB's- ATI's do not exist for me- if I find one in a box-1st hint of any trouble-out it comes..
