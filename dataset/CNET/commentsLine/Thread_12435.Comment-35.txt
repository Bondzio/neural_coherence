this may not be the same but you description of the sound lines up.
in previous years ibm hard drives made this noise as they sought to recover a dud sector.
i was able to fix this by using an ibm utility that spared these bad surface areas and at that time some excess capacity was used to replace these defectives.
it might be worth checking with maxtor what happens when defects occurs on the disk surface and what can be done to fix this.
my experience with ibm (now hitachi)was that once the bad areas were hidden the were no problems.
i now have hitachi drives with no problems at all.
