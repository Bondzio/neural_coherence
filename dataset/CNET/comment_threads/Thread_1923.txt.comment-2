If you mean an internal mini-PCI wireless network adapter that is found in many notebooks, go for it!
I like them better than external wireless network adapters (USB, PC-card/PCMCIA).
Range is good, no hardware to lose, keeps USB ports free.
Check with your notebook mfg to see what mini-PCI card they recommend.
NewEgg.com sells them, too.
