all i meant was that the system restore facility uses up huge amounts of hdd space.
if you go to control panel - system - and click on the system restore tab, you can reduce the amount of hdd space it uses up.
in other words you will reduce how far back you can go on restoring your system set-up.
if i set mine to maximum, it can eat up 16 gigs of my 160 gig hdd
