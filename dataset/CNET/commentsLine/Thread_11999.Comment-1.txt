i'm looking to upgrade the amount of ram i have in my system, but have run into a few technical things which i'm unsure of.
information was collected from everest current ram: ddr sdram ddr-333 256mb unbuffered pc2700 (166mhz) dimm cl2.5 i want to upgrade to 1gb, with either 1x1gb or 2x512mb.
my motherboard only has 2 ddr dimm ram slots, so is it better to use 1x1gb incase i want to upgrade again in future?
are there any disadvantages to only have a 1gb stick?
i've been searching around for pc2700 for the last few days, and just noticed that everest says it supports other types: supported ram: ddr-266 sdram, ddr-333 sdram, ddr-400 sdram since ddr-400 is supported, does that mean i can use pc3200 ram instead of 2700 and have no problems?
i'd rather buy the faster sticks if they'll work.
these are the pc3200 i've been looking at:    are they any good and will they be supported okay?
my price range is 50-100, so if anyone has other good places to look can they post them (will need to be a uk site).
one of those sticks also says cl3.0, what's the difference between 3.0 and 2.5?
