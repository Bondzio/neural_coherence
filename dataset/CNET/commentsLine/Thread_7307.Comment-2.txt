step 2. so far, with no exceptions the bios must show the drive.
any attempt to install drivers will only tax your time and patience.
your product =  i see that you might enable a third master in the bios at  however unless you find a document with the bios screen shots, this is as far as i go.
plan b. install some card like this -&gt;  but beware that many don't want to flash the bios for the ide emulation so it will work.
