<s> Let me start by saying I am very much a novice pc user, and I would to thank you for your help in advance. </s>
<s> That being said, I have two computers, A and B, with A being wired to my router and B being wireless. </s>
<s> A is running XP Pro and B is running XP Media Center. </s>
<s> I am also running a program called Network Magic that helps in sharing folders and such. </s>
<s> Computer A has a folder containing all of my mp3 files that I would like to put on computer B, and I set it up to be shared using Network Magic. </s>
<s> When I open up the program, I can open the folder, but I can not play any of the files contained in the folder, and I can not drag them to a folder on computer B, nor can I copy and paste them to the folder on computer B. </s>
<s> When I attempt to, I get an error saying &quot;Cannot copy &lt;Filename&gt; Access is Denied. </s>
<s> Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected and that the file is not currently in use.&quot; Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do on how to get these files from Computer A to Computer B. </s>
<s> Sorry for the lengthy description, and again thank you for your time. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Let's say your account on computer A is called &quot;Johnny&quot;. </s>
<s> Do you have an account called &quot;Johnny&quot; on computer B and did you set the permissions on the files to allow Johnny to read them? </s>
<s> That's 2 things you need to accomplish. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Another downright nutty thing that kills some is that after they get the accounts correct it still doesn't work. </s>
<s> What I found is Windows doesn't retroactively give Johnny access to the share. </s>
<s> I have to remove the share, recreate it after I created Johnny's account. </s>
<s> After this, Johnny can read. </s>

<s> Again, sorry for my lack of knowledge, but how would I go about doing that. </s>
<s> I apologize, but I really need you to hold my hand through this process. </s>
<s> With all the fine books and web pages about the sharing properties in Windows I must decline giving any step by step. </s>
<s> My goal was to share why this happens most of the time. </s>
<s> Creating accounts should be easy. </s>
