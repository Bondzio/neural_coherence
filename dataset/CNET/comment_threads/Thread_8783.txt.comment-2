My guess without looking is you're way underpowered.
The question is whether you can use a generic PSU or something proprietary to GATEWAY.
Here's one of the BEST PSU mfgs made...it doesn't list GATEWAY as a mfg but I'm sure they can tell you if they make a unit that works with your PC as configured.
It's definitely worth a call.
