according to the calculator i need more than a KW but i have seen systems with same config runing 550W supplies.
some of the other calculators do not have the high end graphics cards.
is it better to get a large psu (1kW) or 2 550W supplies.
I am looking at the silverstone and the lian-li cases which have room for 2 psus
