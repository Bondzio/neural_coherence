<s> Hey guys, here's my question: I had 3GB of 800 MHz RAM running in my computer. </s>
<s> I guess I decided that I had some money to waste or something so I upgraded it to 4GB (1x4) of 1066 MHz. </s>
<s> I understand that with the limitations of a 32 bit operating system I won't get the full 4GB, but my RAM is downclocked from 1066 to 667. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> I tried installing them all individually to make sure I didn't have a bad stick, and I even returned them and got a new batch, same deal. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> But most machines gain at most 0.5GB RAM. </s>
<s> Even with the /3GB switch what benchmarks I ran could not find any benefit. </s>
<s> Well I knew about the limitations of the 32 bit OS, but I just can't figure out why it downclocked the speed. </s>
<s> At the very least it should be running at 800 if not 1066. </s>
<s> There's a reason I get stuff there. </s>
<s> Its the motherboard that dictates the speed your ram runs at not the ram. </s>
<s> Ram described as 1066 means it is capable of running at that speed in a suitable MB not that it will run at that speed in any MB. </s>
<s> There is a free application called cpuz-144 that will tell you what the bus frequency of your MB is, Ram rated speed should be equal to or greater than the bus speed of the MB. </s>
<s> HTH </s>
