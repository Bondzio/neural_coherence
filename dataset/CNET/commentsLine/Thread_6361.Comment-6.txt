if u don't see yourself doing a major upgrade soon (proc, mobo, the whole works), then getting at least 0.75gb of ram would be preferred.
winxp is quite the resource hog, and will let u play some low to mid end pc games much better.
i was the same way n college.
i upgraded ram, hd, burner drive, mouse, and os.
everything else that was larger and more expensive i waited till i got out of school and would be able to better afford then.
for new system $2000 is enough for prebuilt places like dell.
that price point should even include a nice lcd monitor.
if ya want a more extravagent lcd monitor, consider spending a 'lil more for a better lcd (20+ in, or maybe even those 24'' widscreen ones).
spending more on a good monitor may work well for future investments, as ppl will often reuse the same nice monitor for 5+ years, till the end of its lifecycle.
you can shave up to hundreds of $$ off if you can find online deals and coupons for those pcs if you're assembling your own pc, $2000 is enough with extra bells and whistles.
