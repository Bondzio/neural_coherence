Of the 4 PC's I have mentioned all were custom designed and ordered from each manufacturers respective website and not store bought or out of the box.
At the time I ordered the Velocity and the Alienware machines they were primarily only doing high end gaming rigs.
As I said the Alienware was DOA and they gave us such a hard time about a return that I would never do business with them again.
The Velocity did &quot;work&quot; as did the &quot;HP&quot; I'm sending back now, but they ran at nowhere near the promised blazing speed that I think I have the right to expect from machines that cost so much money.
The Velocity was pretty terrible until I upgraded to Windows 7.
For the high price paid, I want quality, speed, performance and reliability.
It's like a car.
If I buy and pay for a BMW then I have a right to expect not not to drive like a Chevy.
My primary question...still not answered is this: What BRAND of gaming PC do the people on this thread have and/or recommend?
