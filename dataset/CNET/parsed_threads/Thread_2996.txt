<s> Hey, so I'm having a problem with my computer. </s>
<s> When I turn it on normally it blue screens either during the log-in or a few minutes after I've logged in. </s>
<s> However I've found that when I start up in Hiren's bootCD and THEN boot into the windows on the Hard Drive it runs smooth. </s>
<s> What could the problem be? </s>
<s> The machine can have OS, driver or cooling problems. </s>
<s> Why so short on details? </s>
