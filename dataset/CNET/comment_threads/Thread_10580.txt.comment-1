I have a FreeAgent Pro 750GB hard drive.
I want to use the eSATA interface but have seemed unable to thus far.
I bought an eSATA Cable that has 3GB/s transfer speed, along with an &quot;eSATA II ExpressCard RAID&quot; by SIIG, Inc.
I installed all the software for the card(which appears in device manager and seems to be working properly and nothing seems to work.
it doesn't show that i have a drive connected at all.
It seems to work fine with USB but not with my eSATA connection.
This is the secong kind of card i have tried so i don't know what else to do.
I have a laptop that runs windows XP Media center.
