I would suggest the Nvidia FX 5700LE for PCI aprx $89-$100, or the Nvidia FX 5200 for PCI aprx $68-$93.
To purchase check Neweggg or places like Best Buy, Circuit City, CompUSA, etc... http://www.newegg.com/app/manufact.asp?catalog=48&DEPA=1 on the left &quot;Advance Search&quot; click the arrow on 'Interface' and select PCI then Search at the bottom.
The companies do not make a high end PCI card.
Keep in mind that you don't select the PCI-Express card as that fits a x16 slot.
