I am the only person who will be using this computer. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks, Karen

It doesn't power up, they fix that. 2. Software issues. Here's where people get mad. Repairing even what appears to be a minor issue is often done by reloading the OS and since that's not a hardware failure you may get charged for that. If you insist they backup your files, you get charged for that. If you insist they fix it without reloading the OS, wait, do you see a pattern developing? Bob

Its up to you though on your comfort zone but generally most users can't fix a laptop but could possibility a desktop. Plus, considering what an ext. warranty costs like in 15-25% of value of the system, whooo that's a chunk of $. But again, that's up to you. tada -----Willy

After doing more research on this computer, I concluded that it is a great computer. Unfortunately, I discovered that their technical support is a nightmare, but hopefully I won't need any. It seems it is difficult, if not impossible, to speak with someone at customer service if it is not related to technical support. Thanks again. Karen
