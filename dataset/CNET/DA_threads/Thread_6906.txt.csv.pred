1.1.1	i am in the process of building my self a semi-future proof system, and i am just curious as to what component would create the most of a bottleneck compared to the other components: P4 640 64-bit 3.2 ghz 1 gig ddr2 533 raid 0 sata pair of 80 gigs all-in-wonder x600 pro hyundai l90d+ 19&quot; lcd 52x cd rom 48x (?)

1.2.1	Unless the CDRW and CDROM units are recycled, I'd just move to DVDRW... Bob	St
1.3.1	well, i had started on this build initially more than a year ago when i got the case and the drives, so they are pretty aged.	St

1.4.3	John	St
1.5.1	yep, 450 watt	St
1.6.1	I would go with a better video card if possible...maybe the Nvidia 6800 or ATi 9800 Pro	St
