It would be best to create a username and password common to all PCs that need to access shares.
Create a specific share that includes that common username and password in its permissions.
I've one other thought having to do with Windows 7 only that deals with some new SMB security changes that were made but won't get into that yet if you're not having problems with Win7 only.
