I have a debugging question. I moved my computer to a new location so I thought I would vacumn out the dust. In so doing I removed my Heat sink and fan off the cpu. I put everything back in place and powered it up. As it was going through the post/pre-boot it shut itself down. In opening it back up I discovered the heatsink was not properly seated (my fault). I reset it and buttoned everything back up. Now it will not go into the post/pre-boot and just blinks the CDROM, and the hard drive led on the case blinks. So far I have replaced the Power supply with the same results. I've also disconnected all boards but the video card and the floppy with the same result, it never gets to access to setup. I would like to trouble shoot it a little more before giving up on the mobo (since its getting power) or the CPU. I suspect I cracked the MOBO as there is no evidence of a short or tell tale smell. Anything I can try short of replacing the motherboard and cpu and memory in that order?

I have some and was going to try that, however it was only on for the length of time to get into the post. I know these overclocked cpus are extremely sensitive, but it was only for a few seconds. I wouldn't think it could get that hot that fast?

I'll put in a CPU and see if thats what's gone. And I will double check my installation this time. Thanks to you both. John
