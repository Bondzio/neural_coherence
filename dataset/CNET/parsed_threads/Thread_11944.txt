<s> Hi, I have been trying to connect my laptop (Windows Vista) and my netbook (Windows 7) with a crossover cable, and I have followed every single step of the instructions I have found on the net, including disabling Windows firewall, but it won't do it and when I try to ping the failure seems to be when the netbook tries to ping the laptop (100% loss). </s>
<s> Any advice? </s>
<s> What could the problem be? </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> Yep, it should work. </s>
<s> The situation that it works with both devices having indirect connection (via a router) is much more common. </s>
<s> So I'd try to get that working first. </s>
<s> And then you might find that the direct connection works also. </s>

<s> Thanks, but unfortunately I don't have a router.... </s>
<s> I only have a normal modem... Maybe it would be easier if the OS were the same, although theoretically it should also work with Vista and Windows 7. </s>
<s> Why not try with a friend or family member that has one? </s>
<s> Both the netbook and the laptop are portable. </s>

<s> I have found a thread somewhere on the net that mentioned a solution not mentioned anywhere else, and it worked! </s>
<s> It worked also for the other people in the thread. </s>
<s> They say to just write the IP of the other computer in the default gateway (the IP that is automatically assigned, although you could also assign it manually)... </s>
<s> I did it for both computers and it worked, although I had not shared all folders, so only a few were shared, but both computers appeared in the network... </s>
<s> The root of your issue is you have no way to get an IP address on your PCs without doing it manually. </s>
<s> So, you do it just that way. </s>
<s> You give each a &quot;static&quot; address. </s>
<s> They must both be withing a compatible range and you don't need a gateway address. </s>
<s> The most simple way would be to use the old MS convention for LAN use. </s>
<s> Set one to IP 192.168.0.1 and the other to IP 192.168.0.2. </s>
<s> Set the subnet mask for both to 255.255.255.0. </s>
<s> Your PCs should now happily connect. </s>
<s> This doesn't mean you can access or move files yet. </s>
<s> You need to set up file sharing and create at least one user one both PCs that share their username and password. </s>
<s> It's also best if these are in the admin group. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Hi, yes, that's what I had found on the net and what I had done, but it didn't work. </s>
<s> I don't know if it is because the OS are not the same, or because the laptop (and the network card in it) are a bit old (about 5 years). </s>
<s> If you connect the two computers with the crossover cable and then try ipconfig /all (I think that's what it was, I found this info on the net too) you will find out the automatic IP address assigned by the crossover cable. </s>
<s> (It won't appear if you just try ncpa.cpl, but it is there...) I also tried those IP addresses you mention + the subnet masks, but the only thing that worked was adding the IP address of the other computer in the default gateway... </s>
<s> I found this solution &quot;hidden&quot; in a thread, so obviously not a well-known solution, but it worked! </s>
