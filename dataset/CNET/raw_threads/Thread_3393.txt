My existing video card (NVIDIA GeForce 4 MX 440SE with AGP8X) doesn't have a DVI input. Would it make a big difference in clarity if I upgraded my video card to something that does have DVI? Thanks for the info.

DVI input	Whilst DVI oes give a superior display (especially for game-play), there's is a setting within Windows for user's of LCD screens to improve text appearance. 1. Right-click empty part of Desktop and choose 'properties'. 2. Click the 'Appearance' tab. 3. Click the 'Effects' button. 4. Tick the second item which says &quot;use the following method to smooth the edges of screen fonts&quot;. 5. Now in the drop-down selector for that item, select &quot;ClearType&quot;. Click 'OK' to save new setting. Hopefully you will find the text is now clearer, since Microsoft developed ClearType especially for laptops and other LCD/TFT displays.
