Im using a dlink NIC card and a cable modem. Im running Windows ME. I can connect just fine with only the NIC Card and modem but when I add the router to the equation and open my browers my computer locks up and I have to reboot. My computer wont operating right after that, then I disconnct the router and everythings okay. HELP PLEEEEEEEASE Ive benn going at this for about a month now. Tried using DLINK tech support but they couldnt figure it out.
