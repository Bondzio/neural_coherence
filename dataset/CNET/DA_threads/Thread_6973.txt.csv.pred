1.5.1	Steve , I got the 4700 instead of the C model .	St
1.5.2	I wanted the larger one because that 's what I am used to and they could do it faster because on the smaller one evidently everything had to be redone and would take longer to make .	St
1.5.3	This is my second Dell .	St
1.5.4	The original one I am using now is over 5 years old and never been serviced .	St
1.5.5	I have a brother in law that owns an insurance company and says he never has any problems with his Dell 's ( has 20 of them ) but the 5 that are other brands give him trouble all of the time .	St
1.5.6	I chose another Dell since I love their products and service .	St
1.5.7	They helped me with info that was stupid all through the warranty time and even after the tech support was supposed to be over for me .	St
1.5.8	Anyway , it is still in the boxes in the hall and I have n't done the transfer work , but the info that I received from these very gracious people will help me do it the right way .	St
1.5.9	Incidentally , I ordered the Dell at 8:30 on Wednesday night and it was delivered to my door in complete with EXACTLY what I wanted on Friday at noon .	St
1.5.10	And that was with extra features added to my order and alot of changes made .	St
1.5.11	Can you believe that service ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.5.12	Thanks , Pam	St
