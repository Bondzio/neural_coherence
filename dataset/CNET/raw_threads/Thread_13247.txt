Aside from always having to connect and disconnect my laptop to my HDTV with an HDMI cable, what other options do I have to access my media files (largely DivX and AVI files -torrent downloads) on my HDTV through my wireless network? ie I looked at Boxee or Apple TV set top boxes, but I wouldn't really use the streaming functionality so not sure if there is another better option? I realize this is a basic question - I am not technical at all! Thanks

And the fact you have a collection or mismosh of varied encoded content means you would be upset as some files worked and others didn't (see the Samsung forum for examples where folks don't want to know, they want it to play.) I suggest a PC. Bob
