<s> i was backing up some of my dvds recently and noticed that it took an extremely long time to burn them. </s>
<s> lets just say it usually took about 40min total to copy onto the harddrive and burn a dvd. </s>
<s> now it takes over 80 min! </s>
<s> this was pretty abrupt. </s>
<s> ive defragged, & scanned for everything. </s>
<s> not sure what else to do. </s>
<s> dont know if this matters, but theres about 30GB of space left on my 120GB harddrive, but this never prevented a faster burn before. </s>
<s> win xp P4 2.8GHZ 512MB Ram </s>
<s> I select recording at 1/2 the media or drive speed whichever is lowest because &quot;I've learned the lesson.&quot; Maybe a good thing? </s>
<s> Also, the DVD may be copy protected and it takes longer? </s>

<s> i forgot to mention this before but before it suddenly slowed down, i was able to use the internet & play music seamlessly & the burning process didnt take any longer than usual. </s>
<s> but i will try to burn a disc at 1/2 speed </s>
<s> Type XP DMA into google.com and consider setting the channels to PIO and back to DMA as noted in the first article from Microsoft. </s>
<s> Sorry but the details are so thin in your posts that I can't offer much. </s>

<s> sorry to resurrect a dead thread but i totally forgot about this forum. </s>
<s> i tried the dma trick to no avail. </s>
<s> so lets see...more info.... i use several burning software and it ranges from jetaudio to nero, to dvd shrink, all of which have noticably added about 10 minutes to the burning process. </s>
<s> im not sure if ive mentioned this before but i used to be able to multitask alot while burning dvds, but now just to be sure that the burn comes out without errors i have to refrain from strenuous activity. </s>
<s> for example i could listen to music, play a flash game, burn a dvd, and surf the web with no slow down at the same time. </s>
<s> now i justsurf the web when when im burning something & theres still a slowdown. </s>
<s> is this slowdown normal? </s>
<s> It's very normal. </s>
<s> And if the owner isn't watching every update they may miss what caused the change. </s>
<s> For instance an update to Norton caused some sluggish email performance one day. </s>
<s> So off with Norton and in with something else. </s>
<s> Gotta pay attention since I can't guess what you installed. </s>
