Bought this computer yesterday, and tv locked up minutes after install...saw lots of peoples' reviews at retail stores after purchase, who stated same problem.
Found it hard to believe the &quot;pros&quot; at Consumer Reports #1 Retailer - MicroCenter (KS) did not have a clue about this problem and recommended this as a great media center computer for tv use.
Went back to store next day and they offered to exchange..hahaha.
Luckily, searched Google one last time for a solution tonight...and here it is...the update from Microsoft provided by &quot;The Wesker&quot; fixed the problem asap!!!!!
Have been running tv now for about 2+ plus hours without skips, stalls, freezing, etc.
