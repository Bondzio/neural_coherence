I have a bit of an unusual networking situation here in my home and need advice on proper configuration, so I stop losing my web connection on a daily basis. First a basic diagram, followed by an explanation as to why this is necessary: &lt;img src=&quot; http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n616/grindy45/Network_zps422c85d5.png&quot; /&gt; The reason I'm forced to have the 2nd router is that my wife telecommutes and the 1st (primary router) is provided by her company. For whatever reasons, her company will not allow the wireless radio in their router to be turned ON - which forces me to add the 2nd wireless router for our 3 computers that require wireless access. My questions are: 1 - Since the primary router has DHCP enabled, I am assuming that I should Disable DHCP on my wireless router. Am I correct? 2 - What other settings on the wireless router do I need to pay particular attention to in this situation? All input will be appreciated here, and any suggestions you might have are particularly welcome.

Some of the cable modems have a DHCP in them so we disable on both routers and not use the WAN ports. It seems close but a detail is missing so I can't offer anything exact except it looks very close. Bob

You would connect from LAN port to LAN port (do not use the WAN port on the wifi router). If you have further problems, you may need to provide more details (ISP, make/model of all networking devices, error messages, etc.)
