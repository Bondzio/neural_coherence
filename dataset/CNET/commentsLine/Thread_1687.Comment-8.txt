that's where shops and people with spare parts have it over the average owner.
they can swap an item out and see if that's it.
as to testing ram, my comment was what to do with that stick.
i rarely have to test new ram and in fact, don't.
my comment was that if a stick of ram was subjected to such an event, then i would not want to try it in another machine unless it was a guinea pig or shop special that we use to test parts in.
usually its some offbeat lintball of parts that if it smokes, we haven't lost anything of value.
at 350 bucks, you will find it difficult to beat that if the motherboard and cpu is toast and you have to pay the tech and shop fees as well.
in the meantime, pull the cover off and make sure the cpu heatsink is in place and all fans are spinning... bob
