Do you know if the integrated graphics on the Haswell is much better than the one on Intel's DZ77GA-70K with Core i7-3770, which is the one that I have been contemplating buying.
If not then I might be better of buying 2 of these: GIGABYTE GV-N760OC-2GD REV2.0 GeForce GTX 760 2GB 256-bit GDDR5 PCI Express 3.0 HDCP Ready WindForce 3X 450W Video Card.
As long as I can keep the price of my mobo, CPU, and graphics whether integrated or not at no more than $1000.
