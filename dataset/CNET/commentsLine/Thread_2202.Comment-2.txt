i'll supply an article about how to select the size and then another about how they lie about the rated size.
in closing, we lost about 5 motherboards and a few power supplies due to failing motherboard capacitors.
be sure your psu loss isn't due to some other issues.
but with what parts you've listed, that psu may have been just too small.
