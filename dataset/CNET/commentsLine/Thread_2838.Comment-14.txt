i bought a 500gb iomega external drive and it has never failed me but i know of two other people with seagate's and they don't have any issues with them.
sounds like something other than the drive so don't give up on seagate just yet.
400gb may make a great paperweight but it's not likely to be cost effective and you do not wanna toss that kind of cash if you can help it.
