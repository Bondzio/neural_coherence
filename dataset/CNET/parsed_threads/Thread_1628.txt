<s> I was thinking aboutgetting something like the D-link DSM-320 or Hauppauge MediaMVP, but neither have very good reviews either because they acted inconsistently w/ different file types or streamed low-quality media. </s>
<s> the Turtle Beach AudioTron got rave reviews, but it only deals with audio files (albeit very well). </s>
<s> If anyone can point me to a good device that can stream both audio and video from an external hard drive, I'd greatly appreciate it! </s>
<s> I'm in the same boat. </s>
<s> Was looking at PRISMIQ's Media Player. </s>
<s> Have you looked at it. </s>
<s> I've seen it rated fairly high. </s>
