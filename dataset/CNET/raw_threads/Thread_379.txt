There is nothing you can do and even if so, it would be another cost and hassle. Only the newer mtrbds. and Vista and later OS(64-bit) will work as clean as possible. Visit the Seagate support website and review it's FAQ. http://whatswithjeff.com/read-before-upgrading-to-3tb-hard-disk/ tada -----Willy
