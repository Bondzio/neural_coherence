Question, if you get one with a S-Video cable can you hook it up to your TV? Can you also record what is being showing on the tv?

PCI-Express: radeon x1650pro 256mb, $88 ($10 rebate) radeon x1650 256mb, $76 geforce 7600gs 256mb, $91 ($20 rebatee) geforce 7300gt 256mb, $70 ($10 rebate) AGP: radeon x1650 256mb, $90 geforce 7600gs 256mb, $106

I sometimes experience some lag when I'm playing games and i was wondering if upgrading to the radeon X1650 pro 512 would show a considerable difference? (I'm currently running 1GB of ram, would upgrading to 2GB also solve the slowdowns?)
