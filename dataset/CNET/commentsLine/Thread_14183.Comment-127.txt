my first pc was a sanyo 770 portable, or should i say luggable and the size of a full size sewing machine.
it weighed about 50-60 lbs., had the keyboard as a base for the computer and cost about $3,000.
it was purchased to take between my office and home.
it had a built-in (color, yes i said color, monitor).
it came with 128kb of ram with two 5.25in ds/dd floppy disks.
i used it for word processing and mailing lists.
this is the computer that taught me that packaged software with a computer is not always a bargain.
i purchased a canon dot matrix printer to use with it which really limited the portability of all this equipment.
i thought i was king of the block because it was twice as fast as the office machine which was an ibm pc at 4.77mhz.
i eventually put in a 32mb harddrive and a multi-function card to expand the memory to the max for dos of 640kb.
the upgrades alone cost about $800.
who can say that computers today are expensive?
when you figure the value of the dollar from the 80's and what you get in a computer today.
computers today are really cheap in comparison!!!
memories what memories.
