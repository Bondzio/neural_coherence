I had a similar problem after fooling around with a pirated Nero 9 (may the Cyber gods forgive me).
Eventually I had to uninstall it and ended up with a similar problem to yours.
In checking for a solution I noticed that someone had reinstalled some Media programme and solved this problem.
I decided to reinstall the Roxio 9 that came with my Dell Inspiron and BINGO.
My internal and external DVD/CD burners returned to the fold.
Hope this suggestion is of use to someone.
