Help soften the blow of such tasks.
The only reason I see to think of getting a Core2Duo over the i3 (or larger) is the price.
The i3 is dual core PLUS hyperthreading so expect to see the old dual core and C2D machines to be heavily discounted as the consumers figure out they want the i3 or better.
Your choice to move up the CPU ladder.
