Here take a look at this motherboard http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131568 I don't get it, two PCI slots are in between the two PCI-E x16 slots.
How will you be able to use the PCI slots if you have 2 GPUs in SLI if the the SLI bridge will obstruct the access/installation of the PCI slots?
Or is it that this board does not require the SLI bridge at all?
