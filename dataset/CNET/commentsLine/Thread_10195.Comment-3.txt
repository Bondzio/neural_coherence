it gets interesting that a 6yr.
printer finally gives up the ghost.
if it wasn't broke, then leave it alone as the statement of the tech did a cleaning and now problems.
it always seems to be the case, imho.
if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
but, you may find a used or refurbed 6l should you decide to remain with one.
here is one such website:  heck, even the  has a 6l for bid(online auction) right now, check them out, be quick.
craig's list may have something for you in 6l, afterall, you're in the area.
there are so many lasers out there, just find one similar to your 6l, if you need networking(later?
), then see if that port is part of it.
you didn't mention how the prtr.
is attached but if lpt port, then low-end lasers usually are usb, but some do have it but usually as in a hi-end model.
that maybe important, so check that.
hp still makes a decent product, support is another issue but if important look into ext.
warranty.
brother practically make throw away models, but they do work well.
i suggest you check out okidata lasers, a bit more pricer but they are really dependable, imho.
