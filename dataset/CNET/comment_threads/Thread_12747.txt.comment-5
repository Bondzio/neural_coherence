Ok ya know whats crazy?
I'm having the same problem...
I have an old Aptiva though PII 350 512megs of ram, 40 gig running Windows XP PRo.
I've installed regular NIC's no problem, but I actully have 4 different kinds of Wireless NIC's (I'm a PC TECH) And the PC/WINXP won't detect ANY of them!
It picks up all the regular NIC's no problem, but when it comes to the wireless... forget about it!
I'm lost...
I'm updating BIOS now, if that doesn't work i'm out of Idea's!
