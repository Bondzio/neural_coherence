<s> I have a basement home office with a Dell Studio desktop with Windows 7,64 bit. </s>
<s> Speed was fantastic. </s>
<s> I purchased a Dell Studio laptop with the same operating system as the desktop and wanted to create a home office network. </s>
<s> My ISP is a cable company and the cable access point is in the basement, initially to a cordless telephone with the desktop PC a few feet away and TV service provided to the upper two floors in the house. </s>
<s> To set up the network, I purchased a Belkin Play router. </s>
<s> With Belkin support I now have a network with the desktop wired and the laptop wireless. </s>
<s> However, I paid a price in that my desktop speed is probably half of what it used to be and frequently I cannot connect to certain web sites on the first attempt. </s>
<s> My specific question is, do you think the proximity of the cordless telephone is the cause of my problems and if not any suggestions? </s>
<s> I can't tell how you set this up or what hardware is in play. </s>
<s> It's up to you to tell all that. </s>
<s> But a common speed loss is when folk don't follow this forums top posts with the suggested settings. </s>
<s> PLEASE don't take offense. </s>
<s> I type all my replies and rely on the top or sticky post. </s>
