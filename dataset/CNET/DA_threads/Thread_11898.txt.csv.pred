1.1.2	I did not disconnect it to anything else in the computer , just unscrewed it from the back so i could slide it over and see the sticker on the side .	St
1.1.3	I put it all back but now the power button on the outside of the case you normally use to turn the computer on is not working .	St
1.1.4	The only way i can turn on the computer right now is by opening it up , and pressing the power button on my motherboard .	St

1.3.1	The momentary switch that turns on the PC connects there .	St
1.3.2	You 'll need to trace the wiring but it should have a 2 connector plug and the wires are often red and black .	St
1.3.3	You 'll want to make sure you did n't dislodge it when you moved the PS .	St
1.3.4	I 've not seen the front panel harness dressed around PS harnesses but it could happen and moving the PS could be enough to unplug the connector .	St
1.4.1	Sorry about my lack of computer knowledge .	St
1.4.2	Trace the wiring up to the power button ?	Ques
1.4.3	or are you saying trace it to power supply or motherboard ?	Ques

1.5.2	Most of these just snap on to the metal framework .	St
1.5.3	You need to remove the side covers first .	St
1.5.4	I 've built PCs using Antec cases and they usually have some barbed projection that passes through the frame .	St
1.5.5	You need to get to where you can see them clearly .	St
1.5.6	There will be two or three on each side and you need to push them to one side to release them .	St
1.5.7	From there you can get to the innards of the front panel connections and one of these will be the momentary switch that powers on the PC .	St
1.5.8	Note the color of the two wires and trace that through the front of the frame to the motherboard .	St
1.5.9	There should be an array of pins somewhere on the motherboard that these connections go to and it 's usually two rows of about 8 pins .	St
1.5.10	If you find a disconnect at the motherboard , you 've probably found your problem .	St
1.5.11	If you 're not comfortable with doing this , you probably need to seek help .	St
1.5.12	If you take it to a shop , be prepared to pay a hefty bench fee just to look at it .	St
