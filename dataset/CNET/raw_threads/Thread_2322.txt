I know value is good and it's a good compromise if you plan to go that route in the future. My philosophy is top-of-the-line or bottom, I would get an even cheaper Vid if it's only a temporary card. Good components all around should be a solid rig but no chest hair...yet
217	2	110930	1261510	1260314	chrisludes	6/24/05 9:58 AM	1.11960708E12	Thanks	Yeah I know it wasnt the best choice for a mobo with the bugdet and other gear i have listed. The graphics card isnt necessarily temporary as im hoping this comp will last me these next 3 years of college. I need it for CS:S n stuff. im majoring in pre-engineering physics since EE was impacted so I might need it for any kind of programs we will use but at the same time i dont ant to go over a grand. if you have any suggestions for a mobo that isnt SLI and a vid card that isnt as quick but plays what i need decently let me know..and work with the parts I already have. thanks

HE IS READY FOR THE FUTURE, your video card is fine, all you need to do is buy another and a bridge chip when you think your machine needs a good upgrade. keep the sli mobo. good ram, cpu, hdd, vid card - although the 6800 series will fall in price over the next weeks and months. SUPERB choice on your case and power supply. i think that case is one of the best along with the p180. everything else is thumbs up be happy with your system konny

If you do get both, make the burner the primary. Your link for the HD is a 200gb with a limit of one, but it is a good drive. You could get one drive now and add the other one later. Here is another HD option. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822144357 I assume that you are into gaming by the video card you choose. If not you could save money there. All in All a good system. By droping the DVD ROM and the second HD will save $120, and you can allwise add them later. John
