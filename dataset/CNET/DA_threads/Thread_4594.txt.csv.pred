1.1.1	I bought and installed a Belkin 802.11g router in January and I still get dead spots in my 1600 square foot apartment.	St
1.1.2	I think I need a range extender or expander, but those seem to cost more than the router I purchased a few months ago.	St
1.1.3	Plus they all seem to have difficulty with the set up and being a novice, I dont think I could get it to work.	St
1.1.4	Any easier solutions, or are there expanders that are fairly simple to set up and use?	St
1.1.5	or Get a newer - better router?	St
1.1.6	Thanks in advance.	St
1.2.1	things like moving the router to a central and/or open location?	St
1.2.2	Sometimes just moving its location around can help.	St
1.2.3	Side note: If you use a wireless phone, many are on the same frequency (2.4 GHz) which will knock you off because of interference.	St
1.3.1	Thanks, I bought 5.3GHz phones, so I dont think that is the problem.	St
1.3.2	Doesnt my router need to connect to my desktop via a cable?	St
1.4.1	Yes, your router need to connect to the desktop ...	St
1.4.2	IF that desktop doesn't use wireless.	St
1.4.3	No, if your desktop use a wireless.	St
1.4.4	Place the Wifi Accesspoint somewhere in the middle of the room... preferably high.. Look out for any interference, such as Cordless phone, Microwave, baby monitor, etc... (including your neighbour's) Try to make a better antenna--&gt; freeantennas.com	St
