Now, however, I can read and write other disks, but the 202 has stopped recognizing Blu-Ray disks altogether! The only updates I've made are Microsoft's -- updates I've grown increasingly wary of -- and I'm wondering if it could be the updates that are creating this problem! Not only will my PowerDVD 8 not see it, neither can I get my system to see any content. Indeed, it thinks there is no disk there. Does anyone have any ideas why this might be happening? I can't believe it's a hardware problem, but who knows? Thanks! John

But try reinstall the software anyway; it can't hurt. Of course hardware do fail sometime but hopefully this is not the case. Good luck.

Willy Wonka used to play fine, too, but now my system can't see the disk. Why would it see other Blu-Ray discs, but not a disc that had played once with ease? If I can't get a workable answer, I'll have to buy a fifty dollar LG disc player.
