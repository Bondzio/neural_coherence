<s> OK so I bought a ViewSonic VX2250WM monitor. </s>
<s> I set it up with my desktop and set the resolution at the recommended 1920x1080. </s>
<s> However 2 days later I started getting a pop-up message telling me that the recommended resolution is 1200x1080, and that I should change my current resolution. </s>
<s> When I went to do that my resolution was on 1600x1200, and my desktop was telling me that this was my highest resolution which obviously isn't true. </s>
<s> All my drivers are up to date and trouble shooting reveals no problems? </s>
<s> What should I do? </s>
<s> It won't be the video card driver that determines the native resolution of the monitor. </s>
<s> Does your system recognize the monitor by its exact manufacturer and model #? </s>
<s> If not, you need the Viewsonic driver installed. </s>
<s> As noted, 1200 do not match up with the monitor, hence the pop-up message. </s>
<s> I suggest changing the video card setting to as close as possible to 1920x1080 (but not over that). </s>
<s> What connection do you use, vga or dvi? </s>
