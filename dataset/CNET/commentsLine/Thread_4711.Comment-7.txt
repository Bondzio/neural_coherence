i have a friend who works for a business program company and a few years back when the whole country was having lots of grid problems found that the spikes were taking power backup systems but those with just surge protectors were surviving.
bottom line i believe the power backup protected by the surge protector should make the operator from knowing a surge ever happened.
well... looks good on paper.
