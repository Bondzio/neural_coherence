this specific aspect, because i think that since you haven't fully installed xp, i'm not sure how you run chkdsk.
the slash f means to fix any problems found by chkdsk [without asking you].
i think what you need to do is start the install again and see if it offers to let you get to the recovery console.
if you can get into that, you will type the command in that they gave [space before the slash] and hit enter.. recovery console looks a lot like dos, but doesn't have as much capability as dos had.
