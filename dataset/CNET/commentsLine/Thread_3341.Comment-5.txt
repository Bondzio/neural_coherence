thanks bob, i appreciate the confirmation.
i'll probably just warranty out the board.
even if i stay with the new xp install [always nice to clean house and start fresh], i'd prefer a fully functioning board.
what the heck?
it's just postage.
anyway, thanks again!
always good to gain more tips and tricks.
