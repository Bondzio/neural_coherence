1.1.1	So , I have an approximately 13 year old Toshiba infinia , and I want to make it the best pc it can be.It was originally designed for windows 95 , though it was later upgraded to windows 98 .	St
1.1.2	Now , given how quickly stuff gets outdated in the world of computers , I am assuming that even the best stuff that was ever made for computers of its ' day are going to be woefully outdated , and subsequentally , dirt cheap .	St
1.1.3	first off , I want to give it more ram .	St
1.1.4	I am not sure which model of the infinia series it is , so I am not sure how much it can take .	St
1.1.5	What will happen if I put more in than it was designed to have ?	Ques
1.1.6	It currently has 64mb .	St
1.1.7	Second , I want to put in a better video card .	St
1.1.8	It currently has a .	St
1.1.9	Then , if it is possible , I would love to put in a faster processor .	St
1.1.10	It currently has the Pentium MMX .	St
1.1.11	what I want to know from you guys is how new can I can go before stuff will be incompatible with my machine .	St
1.1.12	For instance , there is one particular line of nvideas 's video cards that will work with my modern pc .	St
1.1.13	Which line ( and what brand ) would work for my infinia ?	Ques
1.1.14	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	GRRR !	St
1.2.2	There is no edit feature here !	St
1.2.3	Oww well , I just wanted to say it is windows 98SE , and the current video card is unknown , as there is a bunch of stuff in that category in system information .	St
1.3.1	I have a 10 yr old machine running w98 ... it works fine .	St
1.3.2	Would I put any money into it ? ... no .	St
1.3.3	Even if you find parts that will fit ... you might be shocked at the cost .	St
1.3.4	The second problem is MS does not support the OS and utils that support that OS are getting scarce .	St
1.3.5	Your call .	St
1.4.1	Yes , I want to do it .	St
1.4.2	If , after I price the parts , I do n't think it 's worth it , then I wo n't proceed .	St
1.5.1	and if you want to upgrade get a new computer .	St
1.5.2	13 years is more than twice the life-expectancy of what most consumers keep computers for .	St
1.5.3	The computing power of that machine is far below even the iphone i think .	St
1.6.1	Okay , let me clear this up .	St
1.6.2	Yes , I really want to do this ( unless it is just ridiculously expensive ) , no I ca n't just get a new computer .	St
1.6.3	I have a modern computer .	St
1.6.4	It is the family computer .	St
1.6.5	The one I want to fix up is my computer .	St
1.6.6	I use it for my music , and to play old computer games that are not compatible with the computers of today .	St
1.6.7	I want to upgrade it so that it does these two things better , and so I can use to for any other off-line stuff I need to do .	St
1.6.8	So , with that out of the way , I would be eternally grateful if someone would be so kind as to answer my question .	St
1.7.1	Lets start with the ram .	St
1.7.2	Go here ... .. http : //www.crucial.com/ Let it run it 's ram finder scan .	St
1.7.3	That should give you an idea of how much ram the machine can take and what the cost is .	St
1.7.4	256MB seems like a sweet spot .	St
1.7.5	Next we need to know the make and model of the machine so we can try and find a vid card that will fit .	St
1.8.1	Here I see free PCs being discarded on freecycle that are much faster than yours .	St
1.8.2	You could scavenge parts or use one of those .	St
1.8.3	Your question is well understood but since the budget looks like zero look to freecycle ( see google ) to see what people are giving away .	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
1.9.1	I am in the USA .	St
1.9.2	I actually got this computer from freecycle , lol .	St
1.9.3	I 'll look around for other computers to cnanabalize , but , like I said , I want to try and get the best stuff possible for it .	St
1.9.4	This method will give me much less control ... ... .And what about the ram ?	Ques
1.9.5	( see original post )	St
1.10.1	Go get more .	St
1.10.2	You can see at crucial.com what is compatible but DO NOT exceed 512MB for Windows 95,98 and ME .	St
1.11.1	okay , the pc is not connected to the internet .	St
1.11.2	Do you know of any sort of downloadable tool that will give me the information I need ?	Ques
1.12.1	I found a nice little tool that ells everything about my system .	St
1.12.2	It created a web page file thingy with all the info .	St
1.12.3	Unfortunately , I can not add attachments tot these posts , and I am not sure if this link will work for you , but please give it a shot file : ///F : /Belarc % 20Advisor % 20Current % 20Profile.htm	St
1.13.1	Hear ye , hear ye !	St
1.13.2	I just created a web-page .	St
1.13.3	http : //www.freewebs.com/mypcinfo/Belarc % 20Advisor % 20Current % 20Profile.htm If you have any questions about my system , the answers are there .	St
1.14.1	http : //www.activewin.com/tips/hardware_5.html In short you should stop at 64MB RAM on this beast .	St
1.14.2	Not only does the speed nosedive ( actually crash is more accurate ) but finding the tag ram today is nearly impossible .	St
1.14.3	- & gt ; Time to hit freecycle for ANYTHING being tossed today so you 'll get away from this anchor .	St
1.14.4	Oops , this machine does n't make a good anchor ! ! !	St
1.14.5	Bob	St
1.15.1	It says intel pentium with MMX technology .	St
1.15.2	I have also learned that mine is 200 mhz .	St
1.15.3	I googled it , and it appears to be completely different from the one you are talking about .	St
1.15.4	Please look at the page .	Sug
1.15.5	It has four sockets for ram , and it says nothing about a tag ram socket , so hopefully that wo n't be an issue .	St
1.15.6	I have decided to go with two more 32mb ram cards ( I just made the name up , as I did n't know what to call them ) giving me 128mb of ram .	St
1.15.7	Now , the next item on my list is a video card .	St
1.15.8	I really am in need of assistance on this one ... ..	St
1.16.1	The mainboard is the bad old Intel HX .	St
1.16.2	Do not spend a dime on this one .	St
1.16.3	I know this board very well as I wrote web pages about it years ago .	St
1.16.4	If you ca n't read your Belarc report then you should ask others to read them for you .	St
1.16.5	Bob	St
1.17.1	http : //www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx ? model=TC430HX Your call .	Ques
1.18.1	This is truly the old timewarp issue .	St
1.18.2	Way back when those FPM machines were left in the dust when we moved to EDO .	St
1.18.3	The owners that & quot ; invested & quot ; in FPM sticks were miffed over the memory technology advances .	St
1.18.4	Anyhow , you see the & quot ; maybe & quot ; word here and there on this board .	St
1.18.5	And again I think this is a DO N'T DO IT machine .	St
1.18.6	You can find better , for free on freecycle .	St
1.18.7	Bob	St
1.19.1	I expressed my opinion in the beginning ... .Do n't Do That .	St
1.19.2	The user WANTS to do this .	St
1.19.3	It 's the user 's money .	St
1.19.4	It 's the user 's headache .	St
1.19.5	Looks like a Money Pit and a Can of Worms to me .	St
1.19.6	Maybe it 's a LABOR of LOVE .	St
1.20.1	Sorry , the moment I saw intel I thought & quot ; proccessor & quot ; .	St
1.20.2	Okay , so I might not be able to get more ram , ( though I will search around for that tag ram thingamijig ) but what about getting it a better video card ?	Ques
1.20.3	At the vere least , I want to do that .	St
1.21.1	In other systems being dumped on freecyle or dumpsters .	St
1.21.2	Again , a friend scored a Pentium 3 complete and moved their hard disk over .	St
1.21.3	For just watching the freecycle .	St
1.21.4	Be aware that even with the tagram many of this boards behave just like the fellow that did the high dive into the empty pool .	St
1.21.5	It 's not pretty .	St
1.21.6	Bob	St
