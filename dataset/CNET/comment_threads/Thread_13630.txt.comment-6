correctly.
The multiplier for the XP's are FIXED [can't be changed without surgery].
Thus you can only acheive 2.083 GHz when the FSB is set properly.
Many mobos have circuitry that drops the FSB back to a safe speed if you have a bad shutdown or it detects a problem.
The mobo mfrs/BIOS varies on whether you set the FSB to the single speed or the double speed.
Example 133 MHz or 266 MHz [an aspect of double data rate memory] the memory is clocked at 133 but it is read on both the leading and falling edge and thus reads at double the rate [266].
Same for 166 and 333.
As already stated the AMD XP 2800 + actual clock speed is 2.083 GHz.
If it supports 166/333 MHZ memory the multiplier would be probably be listed as 12.5.
