1.1.1	I 'm not sure if this is a hardware or software question ; I 'll start here : ( please read the whole thing before replying - I 've already done some research , so there 's a decent chance I 've already tried - or ca n't try - the basic suggestions ) I 'm in the process of building a new PC .	St
1.1.2	Because my old one died , I 'm moving the hard drive from the old one to the new one .	St
1.1.3	Everything else in the new PC is new , so Windows XP will properly see that the PC 's & quot ; signature & quot ; has changed .	St
1.1.4	Here 's the part that I screwed up : When I saw that the hard drive worked in the new PC , I got so excited that I tried to go into Windows XP .	St
1.1.5	I know now that it was a Really Bad Idea .	St
1.1.6	I saw the bootstrap ( white bar across the bottom ) screen , then a blue error screen flash very quickly - I could n't read anything on it , then the PC rebooted itself .	St
1.1.7	My bottom line question will be : How can this Windows XP ( Pro w/SP2 ) be saved ?	Ques
1.1.8	But first , some additional info : This is NOT an OEM copy of XP , and it 's not a cloned drive .	St
1.1.9	This is a legal copy of XP and a legal move of the drive .	St
1.1.10	I have the original XP installation CD ( without SP2 ; it might be SP1 ) .	St
1.1.11	The drive is a dual boot - I can successfully get into Win 98 ( SE ) .	St
1.1.12	When I try now to get into XP , it tells me that the last attempt to load Windows failed ( possible to due to a hardware change , which is correct ) , and that I should try Safe Mode .	St
1.1.13	Safe mode does n't work either - same reboot issue .	St
1.1.14	Same thing with Last Known Good Configuration .	St
1.1.15	It never asks me for anything , including an activation code .	St
1.1.16	I think that 's everything .	St
1.1.17	So - help !	St
1.1.18	TIA .	St
