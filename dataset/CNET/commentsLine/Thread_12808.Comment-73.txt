frankly i like the idea of being able to cherry pick my componentry.
i select my hd [personal preference: maxtor and samsung], video card [preference for ati despite being kicked around lately], motherboards [various but asus is prominent, and absolutely favor the via chipsets], but most especially the cpus [i've only used amd since early 1980's], but also ram, power supply, installation of the number and capacity of my fans front and rear, etc.
this may come to an end, but until it does, i prefer my own selections over those of others, who &quot;have my best interests at heart&quot; - lol.
