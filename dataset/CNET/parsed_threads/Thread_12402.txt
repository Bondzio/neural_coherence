<s> Can the Maxtor Shared Storage Plus drive be formatted or split-partitioned in a way to allow backups from both a Windows XP computer and a Mac running Leopard? </s>
<s> I'm using it currently and am very happy with the drive; just wondering what my backup options are going to be when I get my iMac in a couple of weeks. </s>
<s> Also, I have a Canon IP5200 printer connected to the drive with with a USB cable, which I have set up as a network printer. </s>
<s> Anything special I should know about setting it up on the iMac? </s>
<s> Posting to the Maxtor support forums hasn't brought any replies yet. </s>

<s> Just create a directory (folder?) </s>
<s> for each system and save your copy there. </s>
<s> Finally, this is NOT BACKUP. </s>
<s> It fails basic rules about backup as in multiple copies, multiple media, off site storage, write protection and more. </s>
<s> It does make for a nice online copy. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ...that the file system mattered, especially if using Time Machine. </s>
<s> Is that correct? </s>
<s> If so, do I need to format the drive as XFS, EFS or something like that? </s>
<s> Notice how many systems work... </s>
<s> I'll post back after I have the iMac and let you know how it worked out. </s>
