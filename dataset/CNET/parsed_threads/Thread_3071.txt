<s> I read some information on this from 2005, but believe my situation is a bit different. </s>
<s> I boot and it seems if I have the side panel off the machine and the windows (in my house) are open, the computer will keep running most of the time. </s>
<s> So I figure it is a heat issue. </s>
<s> Sometimes it will go for hours without shutting down and then the next time I boot it up, it will run for 5 minutes and shutdown. </s>
<s> And I mean instant off. </s>
<s> When it does this and you reboot the system it doesn't do a check disk, which I find really strange, it will start up normally. </s>
<s> I am kind of taking the lack of the check disk function to mean the issue isn't with the hard drive. </s>
<s> It is to cold here to have the windows open today so I have the side panel off the system and have a fan blowing on the motherboard. </s>
<s> So far so good. </s>
<s> But from the previous posts am wondering if my RAM could be failing, or my power supply, which I believe is 350 watts, either or both should be changed. </s>
<s> I don't want to spend to much money on this as it is my hope to pick up a 17&quot; laptop within the next few months. </s>
<s> I do have old machines with good power supplies so was thinking of swapping. </s>
<s> I have changed a mother board years ago, but have never changed a power supply so don't really know what to look for regarding compatibility. </s>
<s> I am running an ACER Pentium 4, 3.06 GHz with 1 G of RAM, XP Pro Thank you for any suggestions you might have. </s>
<s> Does it normally shut down after playing games or while doing something CPU intensive ? </s>
<s> What video card are you using ? </s>
<s> Is your system an Acer or is it more of a clone ? </s>
<s> What motherboard is in the system ? </s>

<s> Replace it on the CPU and if there is a chipset heatsink that is removeable, do that too. </s>

<s> Remove that second hard disk and second CD/DVD drive. </s>
<s> This frees up Watts and costs nothing. </s>

<s> I will look into each suggestion further. </s>
<s> But the stop gap measure that I tried seems to working, and indicates an overheating problem. </s>
<s> I have the side panel off the unit, and have a fan blowing directly on the computer. </s>
<s> It has stayed on for 12 hours or more at a time. </s>
<s> I can see where these forums are a big help for those of us who are a bit mechanically inclined. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
