<s> THE SET UP: Internet connection to modem---modem to wireless router---from wireless router ethernet ports, two separate lines going through walls of home- one to ethernet outlet jack set up in bedroom, one to ethernet outlet jack in garage. </s>
<s> THE ISSUE: I've been plugging computer right into ethernet wall jack in garage (now my office), but would like to have wireless capability in there. </s>
<s> The current wireless signal from main router is weak to non-existant (won't reach due to distance, walls, etc.) </s>
<s> THE QUESTION: What device (if any) can I connect to the ethernet jack in garage (office) that will allow me to get a wireless feed off of existing internet connection? </s>
<s> Is this possible? </s>
<s> Booster? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Here's how I solve this. </s>
<s> I use a common router as a WAP. </s>
<s> Sure you could install a WAP (google WiFi WAP if you forgot what it is.) </s>
<s> To use a router as a WAP google -&gt; How to use a router as a WAP? </s>

<s> Get another wireless router for the garage, and plug the ethernet wire from the other router into its input jack. </s>
<s> Set the garage router to use a different channel from the other one. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
