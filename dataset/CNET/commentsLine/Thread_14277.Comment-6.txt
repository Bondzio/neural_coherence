something new since the last post- i clicked on repair the connection, and after a long time of it trying, i get an error message saying: &quot;the following steps of the repair operation failed: renewing the ip address.
please contact your network administrator or isp&quot;.
could this be the culprit?
i just tried a linksys card i have and still nothing.
but even if the hardware (card, card slot on pc) has failed, wouldn't it give me a &quot;no connection&quot; icon in the tray?
i reloaded the netgear card software, rebooted, and reinserted the card while it was rebooting and same thing.
it recognizes my network (and another in the neighborhood) and i can connect to mine using the network key.
it connects and says the connection status is excellent, but just will not load a web page.
i'm alomst certain there's something in the settings preventing it from connecting.
the netgear software is controlling the connection and not windows, so i know that setting is not a factor.
thanks again, r.!
