The two laptops i have are on different domains.
One is my husbands work laptop which has his company's domain and i have mine which has my company's domain name.
But they are able to connect to each other and i am able to access all the shared folders on my husband's laptop.
I tried renaming the workgroup of the desktop to one of the laptop's domain names but with no success.
The net switcher that you suggested looks more suitable for wireless networks than for desktop PCs.
Correct me if i am wrong.
Please let me know if anyone needs more info to solve my problem.
Thanks Nirmala
