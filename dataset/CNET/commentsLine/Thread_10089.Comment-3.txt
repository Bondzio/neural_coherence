thanks for your reply!
unfortunately; i have also visited this same link and the error message i received is &quot;target not found&quot;...when i tried to install the update?
i find this to be interesting, since this is a direct link to a pioneer web page?
i did however find a link to a dvr-107d firmware update from a european union web page that (installed without a problem)!
here is the link i found:  it beats me why pioneer firmware updates in europe would be different than those for the us?
now for the real reason i have been trying to update the firmware on this drive.
it is also a &quot;burner&quot; and i have been trying to revive it with the firmware update.
the truth is, the drive &quot;still does not burn properly&quot;?
looks as though no firmware update of any kind will revive this drive &quot;for burning&quot; that is....it works fine for just playing a dvd!
anyway, thats the skinny of it, i found my answer, but i found it in a manner i did not expect!
hope this helps someone else!
