Whenever I plug in my flash drives, my laptop is not able to see them. Then, when I shut down, my laptop just hangs. I use a Dell E1505 with Windows XP Media Center.

I have information: Now, I noticed that my usb ports are not working whenever I press Fn+F2 to deactivate my wireless. My laptop can't see any flash drives I plug in after turning off the wireless. The bluetooth manager also hangs. Windows also freezes when shutting down. Wireless internet works fine. When I restart the machine, everything is back to normal (USB ports, bluetooth work again). I don't know what's happening. But below is a breakdown Let say I just turned on my laptop: 1. With the Wireless off, the usb ports work perfectly fine. 2. When I press Fn+F2 to activate the Wireless/bluetooth, usb ports still work fine. 3. When I press Fn+F2 to turn off the wireless, usb ports don't work, and bluetooth also doesn't work. In the Device Manager, if I press Fn+F2 to turn the wireless internet (Wi-Fi) on, under &quot;Universal Serial Bus Controllers&quot;, the Dell Wireless 350 Bluetooth internal Card will appear. There should also be a sound as a sign that a new device installed/connected. Then, when I press Fn+F2 to turn off the wireless internet, Dell Wireless 350 Bluetooth internal Card disappears from Device manager. There should be also a sound that signals that a device is removed. What happens is that the &quot;Dell Wireless 350 Bluetooth internal Card&quot; entry is not removed when I press Fn+F2 to turn off the Wi-Fi. It is stuck there, and my usb ports are broken. For now, as a temporary solution, I have disabled the &quot;Dell Wireless 350 Bluetooth Internal Card&quot; in the Device Manager. Still haven't encountered the problem yet.
