hi.
what kind of p5lp-le motherboard are you running a core 2 on?
i have a p5lp-le (lithium) hp name lithium-ul8e.
according to specification, it does not support core 2. but the latest bios update adds cpu support - but hp doesn't tell which cpu:s.  i want to upgrade my old p4 650 prescott 3.4 ghz, but can't find out which cpus that are actually supported.
help would be appriciated.
/per
