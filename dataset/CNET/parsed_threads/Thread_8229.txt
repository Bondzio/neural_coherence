<s> It makes you feel so stupid to fry your own drive... Well, I fired my Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 9, model 6Y120P0 and I'm looking for a replacment hard drive controller. </s>
<s> If anyone out there wants to sell such a controller, or such a drive with bad sectors (but good controller) Please leave a message here and we will negotiage a trade. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Buy it new. </s>
<s> Some find it revolting but given data recovery charges it's cheap. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Ebay. </s>
<s> Again, find the drive complete and working or else it may be someone unloading a bum board. </s>
<s> Happy hunting. </s>
