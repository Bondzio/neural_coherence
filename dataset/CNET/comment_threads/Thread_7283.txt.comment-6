Watch http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-11319_7-6240575-1.html But I can't offer a tutorial on replacing fans.
Minor skills such as what was needed in the above video and finding the fans at newegg.com or geeks.com is all you need.
Beware taking it to the service counter since you don't want to know the usual fees.
