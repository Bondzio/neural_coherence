you didn't mention the one thing that was the whole point of your post.
the power supply.
you have a lot of things- nice system, by the way- that draw a lot of power.
at the very minimum you should a a good 350 w ps.
better yet, 400w.
and up is a good idea so you system is not drawing all the power it can and straining.
makes everything wear out faster.
good luck.
