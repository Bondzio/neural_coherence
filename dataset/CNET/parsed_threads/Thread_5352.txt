<s> Hi, i just bought a Eee PC 1201T and was wondering a couple of things 1) why does it come without an OS? </s>
<s> is their a reason for this? </s>
<s> could the drivers be un available for windows? </s>
<s> or could Asus be trying to pass more savings on to the coustmer? </s>
<s> (another interesting thing is why it doesn't show op on their website) 2) how can you you install windows 7 without an optical drive? </s>
<s> i have read some of the articles on how to do this but i have been unsuccessful. </s>
<s> i know you must format the USB drive a special way using the command prompt but i am not sure about the rest. </s>
<s> Thanks, Brian </s>
<s> To cut costs, the responsibility to make the restore media is up to you. </s>
<s> And to cut costs there is no CD/DVD drive. </s>
<s> YOU have to decide if you will buy such now or later. </s>
<s> Nothing new here but I'm encountering folk that feel entitled to restore media and DVDRW drives for odd reasons like &quot;it should have come with it.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> i was asking why the netbook in question didn't come with an operating system. </s>
<s> i can make restore media at a later time. </s>
<s> my main concern is how to INSTALL the operating system on the netbook without a CD/DVD drive. </s>
<s> To install the OS we get a CD/DVD drive and use the restore media. </s>
<s> But many feel this is not the answer. </s>
<s> I can't understand why it is not. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> install the operating system from a usb hdd or flash drive? </s>
<s> Since we have a working install method why would we change that? </s>
<s> You could try to create a new way then you could share how you did that. </s>
