1.1.1	I have a Linksys Wireless-G 2.4 gHz broadband router and ever since I put it in, some things have been going slower.	St
1.1.2	I was wondering if there is some kind of firewall, and if I could disable it.	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	well specifically bittorrent.	St
1.3.2	I used to get around 50-80 kb/s now I get a max of like 10.	St
1.3.3	Im pretty sure this started when I got the router.	St
1.4.1	Could it just be bitorrent?	St
1.4.2	Run Spywayre, Adware, and Virus Checks.	St
1.4.3	Do speed test with and w/o the router.	St
1.4.4	~Ibrahim~	St
1.5.1	I run ad aware almost everyday so its not that.	St
1.5.2	I tried connecting the cable directly from the modem to computer instead of going through the router, but I couldn't get a connection	St
1.6.1	You need to find a forum that deals with P2P issues.	St
1.6.2	Here, there's not been any help for such.	St
1.6.3	Just so you know.	St

1.7.1	I've read tons of stuff on how to speed up torrents and I've imporved my speed somewhat.	St
1.7.2	But some people suggest to take off any firewalls like on routers and I wasn't sure if my router had a firewall and if i could turn it off, so thats the only real question Im asking.	St
1.8.1	Yes, any router is a form of firewall.	St
1.8.2	However there are some that claim that STATEFUL INSPECTION makes for a &quot;true firewall.&quot; You have to define what a firewall is before you can call it a firewall.	St
1.8.3	To turn off the firewall that what every router has by nature would mean that you would not have a router... Hope this doesn't confuse you.	St
