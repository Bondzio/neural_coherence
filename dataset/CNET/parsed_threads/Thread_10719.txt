<s> At the moment this is what my System Properties say my computer is like: Hewlett-Packard Company Compaq Presario AMD Athlon(tm) 64 Processor 3200+ 1.99 GHz, 2.50 GB of RAM My Graphics Card is: NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200 I was thinking of upgrading my graphics card to this: http://www.play.com/PC/PCs/4-/8055665/Gigabyte-Radeon-HD-4550-512MB-DDR3-PCI-E-Graphics-Card/Product.html and was just wondering about upgrading my processor, how I would go about doing this and what to look for. </s>
<s> Or if it was not necessary? </s>
<s> I just generally want to speed up my pc, and obviously make the graphics better. </s>
<s> for that graphics card. </s>
<s> Getting a better card will handle the video aspects far better and in general take some of the cpu duties within the gpu, thus allowing the system overall to be better up to a point. </s>
<s> Replacing the cpu in a OEM type system can be tricky. </s>
<s> Systems like Dell, Compaq, etc., are made to support that system level. </s>
<s> The bios may not readily or easily accept a newer cpu, though it can actually be replaced. </s>
<s> The system may not &quot;auto setup&quot; or you need to manually enter values to support it. </s>
<s> -OR- installing it just works. </s>
<s> HP systems on this regard can be too picky. </s>
<s> The point being it's a &quot;go or no go&quot; situation, the choice it yours. </s>
<s> Providing the new cpu fits the specs of the cpu socket and falls in the cpu class that mtrbd. </s>
<s> supports, you have a good chance it will work. </s>
<s> Notice, I can not give a definite answer, that's the nature of your problem. </s>
<s> It becomes obvious you need someone who has already done this for your HP model# and reports yes or no. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> My graphics card at the moment is a PCI-E card so I assume that means any other will work? </s>
<s> will getting that better graphics card makes games run faster? </s>
<s> (as this is my primary concern) I regularly play World Of Warcraft and have to have lowest possible video settings and occasionally play Football Manager 2009 and this also runs very slowly (due to the 3D match engine) </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply helped me understand a few things </s>
<s> Which would be better out of these two: http://www.dabs.com/products/xfx-geforce-9500gt-550mhz-1gb-ddr2-pci-express-dvi-59J4.html#description http://www.misco.co.uk/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=362980&Tab=0&NoMapp=0 or are there better ones you could recommend to me for around the same price but still PCI-E and compatible with my machine </s>
<s> your power supply is robust enough to support the new video card...I saw one XFX 9500GT and it indicated you need a 350 watt PSU. </s>
<s> Power requirements vary slightly with each card....brand and model. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> do I find that out? </s>
<s> this be suitable? </s>
<s> http://www.misco.co.uk/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=331709&Tab=0&NoMapp=0 </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I meant how do I find out about my current power supply? </s>
<s> Do I have to go inside the PC? </s>
<s> If it's a name brand PC just make and model and I'll look up it's stock power supply. </s>
<s> If not, just a peek at the sticky on the power supply. </s>
