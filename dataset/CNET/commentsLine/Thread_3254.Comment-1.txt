i have a gt5238e gateway computer with a duo core 1.86, 250 gb hdd, 1 gb memory and a dg965lv (dg965mq) motherboard and i have a high heat reading in the ich area (io controller chip)of between 63 to 105c.
the intel vague specifications for this area is 65c and i suspect i have a fault sensor because i can hold my finger on the chip and it is hot but i am in no danger of burning myself.
i would like to attach a heat sink with thermal tape as there are no mounting holes and would like to know if this can be done.
this is one of the heat sinks i have been looking at:  this is gateways picture of my motherboard:  this is an intel page on overheating that also shows a diagram of the motherboard heat areas.
the mch area (memory controller chip)already has a heat sink attached and does not have this heat problem.
my system heat readings are normally cpu-39c, mb-39c, ich- 63c to 105c, mch-49c, ambient-42c, fan intake speed 830rpm outlet 800rpm
