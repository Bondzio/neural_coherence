<s> theo, Look on the back for two of four small screws. </s>
<s> These hold the back face plate and cover in place. </s>
<s> Mounting holes for DVD are on the bottom. </s>
<s> Look at the thread pattern on DVD, should be fine thread, use short round headed screws to attact drive. </s>
<s> Unable to tell from web site if DVD front cover needs to be removed. </s>
