1.1.2	*Problem-After all the computer passwords signed in I receive Pixel spots all over screen and when I open a web page the TEXT is just about unreadable-very faint and looks distorted.Screen set as 1600x1200 @ 32 Bit Colour @ 60 HZ and have tried several other settings.Refrehing continously helps for a while BUT when my mouse clicks and mostly when I scroll down a page orclick on a line in any document or web page-even in Services.I hope someone has a solution .

1.2.1	It 's a common sign .	St
1.2.2	Not a good one .	Polite
1.3.1	It was strange after I posted problem I downloaded the latest update to my card -- but this time included complete bundle { driver , control centre ete } .It improved BUT after restart next day zi ended up at square one.This seems to continue now over and over~so I guess I may need a new card.ANY SUGGESTION WOULD BE WELCOME.Thank you for your input .

1.4.1	You will find owners that must have a test to show the bad card .	St
1.4.2	So far the other test I use if they wo n't swap the card is to try Linux .	St
1.4.3	A Linux LiveCD lets us use the machine without installing Linux .	St
