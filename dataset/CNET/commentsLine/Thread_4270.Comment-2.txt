a firewire port - also known as dv port... or ieee1394 or i.link.
the camcorder manufacturers (jvc, panasonic, sony, canon, samsung and the rest) never put a firewire cable in the box, so you need buy one... 4-pin-camera... 6-pin-computer.
don't go cheap.
i use a monster firewire cable... 6 footer was $25.
gold contacts, works great.
according to the gr-d650 manual  see page 9, under &quot;connectors&quot; - the dv port is near the usb port... item 21. also note on page 12 - no i.link cable.
see page 44... note the &quot;(optional) dv cable&quot;... from what i can tell, this jvc is a bottom loader.
if you use a tripod (which you should), this makes changing tapes a bit of a challenge.
i use a sony hdr-hc1 and have learned some &quot;work-arounds&quot;... but they are not efficient.
my son uses a canon elura 60 on his g4 powerbook - take a look at the elura 100. it is a top-loader... and 20x optical zoom compared to the jvc's 15x... other tips: use a tripod.
turn off digital zoom - use only optical zoom.
have fun.
