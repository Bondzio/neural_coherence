<s> Hey everyone. </s>
<s> I have a Compaq Presario 5102US that will be 3 years old in september. </s>
<s> I have Windows XP Professional as the operating system. </s>
<s> About 2 weeks ago I had to repair windows xp and everything's back to normal. </s>
<s> But now, and even before I had to repair it, the computer would just restart itself and it's really annoying. </s>
<s> It can be just sitting there, without me doing anything on it or while being on it and it just restarts. </s>
<s> Also, sometimes when it's loading up, it gets to my wallpaper and then restarts again. </s>
<s> Can someone PLEASE help me?? </s>
<s> It is very annoying to have my pc just restart out of nowhere, especially when I'm running my Ad-aware, AVG and things to keep it from having viruses, spyware and such. </s>
<s> Besides my reply in the XP forum, review the bad capacitor issue noted at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6127-0.html?forumID=9&threadID=29524&messageID=335670 and see if this is your issue. </s>

<s> Make sure that you test out your memory, I have had Win XP do the same thing with a bad memory module. </s>
<s> Especially if you have two or more modules. </s>
<s> The timimg cycle has to be exact or it causes a reboot,I have found. </s>
<s> The machine of mine would run ok on either module, but not the two at the same time. </s>

<s> Take the side panels off and try running it to see if it may be heat related. </s>
<s> I usually place a big floor fan beside the open box and blow air through it. </s>
<s> If you find it doesn't re-boot or as often, then replace your case fans or add some more and consider that after 3 years some components may be getting weaker and more susceptible to heat issues. </s>
<s> I'd also suggest you start a routine backup procedure. </s>
<s> I'm unsure which discussion is live or dead. </s>
<s> The original poster appears to have some 6 or more posts about this and I can see why they may just fade away. </s>
