Hi, I worked in retail computers (big box stores) for awhile and the only &quot;good&quot; deals you get at that time of year are on the mid to low end and the &quot;special, two days only&quot; computers.
These will NOT have a graphics card and will have one to two cores and 512mb to 3 gb ram.
If you find a deal like the Gateway quad-core Gt 5628 (best buy has this week) I'd get it.
Specs: Core 2 Quad Q6600, 3gb DDR2, 500gb H.Drive, Nvida Geforce 8500gt graphics card and a DVD/Cd burner Get it with the Samsung 2232bw 22&quot; mon.
and an Hp F4180 AIO for around $1250.
Ends today however!
