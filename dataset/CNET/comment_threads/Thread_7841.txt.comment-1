So I just finished building a Core 2 Duo PC for a friend, and now that everythings in and all, the power switch won't turn it on.
For some reason the Power LED is on, though faint.
I reconnected all the front panel stuff and made sure they were in the correct places but to no avail.
Also, the mobo supports a 24-pin power, but I used a 20-pin.
It said it could use 20-pin too.
Also, the 12V connector had 8 slots but I used a P4 cable instead.
These might be the problem, but I'm not sure.
