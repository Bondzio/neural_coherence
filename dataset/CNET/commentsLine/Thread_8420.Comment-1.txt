i've got a couple of related questions.
right now i'm using an unpartitioned hard drive in my pc.
i'd like to add a second drive and turn them into a raid1 array (i hope i'm phrasing that correctly) and i'd also like to partition the drive (using partition magic), but i don't want to lose any data.
do i need to partition the original drive before i set up the raid array?
do i need to set up a matching partition on the second drive, or will that be taken care of automatically?
does it matter?
also, do i need to reformat the original drive in order to set up the raid array?
thanks!
