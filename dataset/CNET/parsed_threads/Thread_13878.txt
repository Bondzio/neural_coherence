<s> Unable to install Epson R280 on Lion. </s>

<s> mrmacfixit, Thanks for the assistance. </s>
<s> The problem is that the Epson Lion setup advisor (to which you linked) directs you to install the printer through 'System Preferences...Add Printer...' process. </s>
<s> SysPref then looks for the printer software, then advises 'software unavailable....check manufacturer website, etc'. </s>
<s> It winds up being an endless loop. </s>
<s> I find it hard to believe that a company like Epson would fail to keep its fairly recent products current with an OS as widely used as OSX 10.7. </s>
<s> But it appears that that may be the case. </s>
<s> Any other ideas/recommendations would be gratefully appreciated. </s>
<s> or any of the other Generic drivers would work. </s>
<s> Once Add Printer finds the printer, do you have an option of select a driver yourself? </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> I don't think so, but I'll check when I get home tomorrow. </s>
<s> I'll see if they allow independent search and install for drivers. </s>
<s> or Gimp Print now is a package. </s>
<s> I would go for it. </s>
<s> The best driver suite, IMHO. </s>
