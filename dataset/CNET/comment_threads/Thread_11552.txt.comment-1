Using WindowsXP Svc Pak3, Internet Explorer 8 The LA Times Sudoku and Crossword Puzzles suddenly stopped showing on my monitor on Dec 24.
Had been coming up with no problem for at least a couple of years.
I figured the Times co-ordinator took a Christmas break.
The Times advises no personnel change, no format change, and finds no problem.
All I get is a red &quot;X&quot;.
Am still getting New York Times puzzles OK, E-mails OK, all other Internet functions OK.
