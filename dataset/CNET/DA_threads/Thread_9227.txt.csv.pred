1.1.1	What brand of dvd is best for burning dvd-videos.	Polite
1.1.2	Sony?	St
1.1.3	Pioneer?	St
1.1.4	Samsung?	St
1.1.5	Lite-On?	St
1.1.6	Do you think dvd burner with capabilities of only burning any type of dvd is better than dvd burner that can burn both dvds and cds?	St
1.1.7	thanks sky	Polite
1.2.1	I have an LG 4163b and it works great.	St
1.2.2	It reads everything except CD+G ?	Ques
1.2.3	and writes everything except Mount Ranier.	St
1.2.4	With DVD shrink and DVD decrypter you can do about anything you want.	St
1.3.1	All(that I have seen) DVD burners by default also burn CDs.	St
1.3.2	Sort of like USB 2.0 being backward compatible with USB 1.1.	St
1.3.3	I find I still burn more CDs than DVDs, even with the latest double-sided burner.	St
1.3.4	Hope this helps.	St
1.3.5	chuck	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	i have two rosewill dvd burners, they work great & were dirt cheap around $60 pn newegg.com.	St
1.5.2	They are super silent even when burning, just make sure to uprgrade your firmware to burn @ maximum speed	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	wow, thanks everybody for their opinion.	Polite
1.7.2	I was needing a new dvd-burner because my pacific digital can not even burn to how fast I set it, I tried fixing it with firmwire upgrades and other stuff but no luck.	St
1.7.3	So thats why I am deciding to buy a new one.	St
1.7.4	Hey if I add on another dvd-burner, do you think I should also upgrade my 160 Watt stock power supply unit to 350 watt, because I have two hards, a stock cd-drive, and if I add a new dvd-burner, would it be best to upgrade my PSU then?	St
1.7.5	thanks for the replies on choosing which burners.	Polite
1.8.1	NIL	St
1.9.1	Do yourself a favor and get a good quality power supply before you do anything else.	St
1.9.2	SOmething in the range of 450-500w just to be sure.	St
1.9.3	If you want to play it really safe get a 600w,thats what I use, just in case.	St
1.10.1	While I've never used Pioneer, I have a Plextor PX712A, and I will never buy this brand again.	St
1.10.2	This is the second drive I've had; the first one would only burn to one brand of media, at 2x speed (along with a multitude of other problems), so after a lot of arguements with tech support they replaced it... with a refurbished model, which does better, but not by much.	St
1.10.3	Plextor comes nowhere near to living up to the hype the company has generated.	St
1.11.1	I looked up psu at newegg.com but i can not tell which one is more reliable than the other?	St
1.11.2	Are enermax and atx good brand name?	St
1.11.3	Any other brand name that you guys prefer?	St
1.11.4	thx	St
1.12.1	Here is a nice psu http://www.ncix.com/products/index.php?sku=9934&vpn=SL400&manufacture=ANTEC	St
1.13.1	I took a gamble and bought this power supply http://secure.newegg.com/NewVersion/FeedBack/CustRatingReview.asp?Item=N82E16817162111 its a 600watt from newegg and its been 6months so far & no problems	St
1.14.1	NIL	St
1.15.1	For your plextor drive.	St
1.15.2	I lean toward pioneer, but may buy a plextor next.	St
1.15.3	I use mostly -R, pioneers firmware is top shelf.	St
1.16.1	When it comes to Power Supplies, the bigger the better.	St
1.16.2	I had a computer that had the P/S pop on me.	St
1.16.3	It smoked and fried almost every component.	St
1.16.4	No visible damage other than the smoke coming out of the P/S but after it happened here is what no longer worked: The processor, motherboard, sound card, video card, hard drive, DVD-ROM drive, CD-R/W drive... all useless.	St
1.16.5	The only items that still worked?	St
1.16.6	The memory chip and the Floppy Drive!!	St
1.16.7	I don't remember, but I think it might have been a 250W.	St
1.16.8	Luckily I filed a claim with my home owners insurance and got enough money to completly rebuild a new, better computer with a 500W P/S!	St
1.16.9	Of course I hadn't backed up the HD in a long time, but I only really lost some pictures that I wish I still had.	St
1.16.10	So yeah, If you have multiple drives and killer video/sound cards then you should get the biggest P/S you can manage.	St
1.17.1	I would have to out of the 3 DVD Burners i've owned which consited of a SONY, LG and Plextor.	St
1.17.2	My favorite would have to be the Plextor 716A hands down.	St
1.18.1	I'm using the latest firmware; I'm convinced that Plextor makes junk.	St
1.18.2	50%+ of the disks I burn can't even be read back from the plextor drive, let alone from a different drive on another machine.	St
1.19.1	I use an external FirweWire/USB 2 Plextor drive, and it works flawlessly.	St
1.19.2	I'm very pleased with this unit.	St
1.20.1	..I have burned a couple 4.7GB DVD-R X 8 Discs at 8X speed using Nero Smartstart...It tells me it will take 6+mins to complete....but it is actually taking 32+mins!!	St
1.20.2	Is there a reason why it's taking much longer?	St
1.20.3	Settings?	St
1.20.4	Thing to Check or Uncheck?	St
1.20.5	I have 2.56MB RAM and 2.60GHZ Intel Celeron Prossesor...Do i need additional RAM?	St
1.20.6	Thanx in advance!	St
1.21.1	NEC seems to have the quality	St
1.22.1	research specific models for reviews and user feedback.	St
1.22.2	Also be aware they may be made by same company.	St
