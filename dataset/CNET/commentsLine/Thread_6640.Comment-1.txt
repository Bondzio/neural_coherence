here are the parts i was thinking of (any suggestions are very welcome): motherboard:  power supply:  case:  cpu:  gpu:  ram:  ssd:  hdd:  optical drive:  i have a few questions: number 1 - i would definitely like help with that motherboard just to make sure i'm not missing out on anything or paying too much.
i'm also wondering if new egg includes the instant savings for bundling the items right in the estimated total (it doesn't look like it but i can't be sure).
any knowledge is greatly appreciated (i'm looking to you bob)
