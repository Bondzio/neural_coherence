You may find what you want at a cheaper price or on clearance. Things like memory, drives, CD's video and sound cards are worth shopping especially if you know the specific ones you want. John

Even Pricewatch warns users to be alert to lowball prices and then get burned by shipping [and handling] costs. Also warranties from some of those places can be rather hiden.
