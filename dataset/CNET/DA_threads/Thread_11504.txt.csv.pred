1.2.1	In a notebook , it matters that the OS is known ( you did n't tell ) and who installed the OS ( unknown . )	St
1.2.2	I 'll share one possible fix and not dive into driver discussions until you tell more .	St
1.2.3	- & gt ; Look up WINSOCKXPFIX on google.com to repair the usual spyware induced damaged networking that causes a lot of posts like yours .	St
1.2.4	Cheers , Bob	St
1.3.1	Thank you Bob , The os Win xp Pro service pack2 with all the updates installed .	St
1.3.2	I am sure this is a software problem .	St
1.3.3	But I verified with spybot , microsoft anti spyware and some other anti spy ware as well .	St
1.3.4	I am currently testing WinSock XP Fix .	St
1.3.5	Could a device can be unrecognize due to this kind of a bug ?	Ques
1.3.6	I will post again if that wo n't solve the problem .	St
1.3.7	Thank you Assaf OS : Windows XP Service pack 2	St
1.4.1	It 's rare to see this installed by the owner proper .	St
1.4.2	They expected that XP would find all the drivers .	St
1.4.3	Sadly we have to check with the laptop maker for BIOS udpates , motherboard drivers and maybe patches .	St
1.4.4	Windows Update and the mysterious Driver Update button will not do this for us .	St
1.4.5	My bet is the OS install is incomplete .	St
1.4.6	As to WINSOCKXPFIX , yes , the spyware/malware is causing such damage .	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	This may not apply to your problem , but this solved my similar problem : http : //www.linksysinfo.org/modules.php ? name=Forums & file=viewtopic & p=34236 # 34236	St

1.7.2	I am confuse , I wipe any info related from the registry and still it is not recognise .	St
1.7.3	10x Assaf	St
1.8.1	This is exactly how I fixed my problem : Uninstall the driver for WPC54G ( from the Device Manager ) .	St
1.8.2	Download the latest driver from Linksys.com , it will be in a & quot ; zipped & quot ; ( compressed ) folder .	St
1.8.3	After extracting the uncompressed folder , just run the & quot ; Setup.exe & quot ; file .	St
1.8.4	If you have other versions of the Linksys wireless utility software , it will instruct you to remove that program first .	St
1.8.5	If this does not fix your problem , then you can try Windows Repair problem .	St
1.8.6	The problem with Windows is that it sometimes installs a bad driver , if you allow it .	St
