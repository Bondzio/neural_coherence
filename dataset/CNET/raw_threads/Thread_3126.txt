I am considering a fast computer (Core 2 duo) that can run many apps. I was looking at the 20 inch imac and the slim xps desktop for dell. I am not sure what desktop to get. Do you guys have any suggestions of a desktop that is perfect for fast performance? I also want to play a little games. I don't want to waste my money and crappy computer so what is a good one? core 2 duo at least 1 gb ram 250 above gb hard drive GOOD graphics card THANKS

Some other suggestions, The Ram should be DDR2 and an 256MB video card. a PCI-E slot be available for future video upgrades. As for the Manf. I can't help on that one as I have been building my own for years. I would go with A PC for gaming.
