i am also considering an external hard drive.best buy put a new hard drive in my sister's computer and the computer never worked right again.i might decide to try the external hard drive just to be sure i don't do anything that will mess the computer up permanently.
are external hard drives good to use?
i don't want to waste my money.
thank your for your advice.
