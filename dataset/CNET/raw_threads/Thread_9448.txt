Only forum I've been to that don't post pixs. 4. No responses... no pixs to look at. 5. Got much more response from other forums where they let you post pixs. enough, or you want more?

It was something I felt you may have wanted to know. -&gt; Feel free to vent in the Forum Feedback forum but to do so in this discussion promptly derailed what you may have wanted to really talk about.

However, this begs the question... how come you can post the pixs there and not here? After this question get answered, go ahead and delete these threads.
