1.1.1	I am thinking of getting a 23 inch Samsung HDTV ( with VGA and DVI ports to plug in my computer ) but the problem is that the resolution on it is 1366 by 768 so I 'm not sure if it will be good as a computer monitor .	St
1.1.2	These are my questions : 1 ) Is there anything just inherently wrong with using an HDTV as a computer monitor ?	Ques
1.1.3	2 ) Is the 1366x768 resolution on this HDTV a low resolution for a PC monitor ?	Ques
1.1.4	3 ) Is this resolution of 1366 by 768 better or worse than my current 17 inch monitor which has a native resolution of 1280 by 1024 ?	Ques
1.1.5	4 ) Is this resolution of 1366 by 768 not a standard resolution setting available on PC games ( so that I wo n't be able to set games to this setting and will be stuck with stretching issues ) ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks for any information .	St
1.1.7	p.s .	St
1.1.8	-Note that I use my computer for casual web surfing and some high-end PC games like America 's Army ( and I may use it for graphics programs like Illustrator ) .	St
1.1.9	-The reason I want to get an HDTV is so that I can plug my Xbox 360 into it and double it as a computer monitor since most HDTVs have VGI and DVI ports .	St
1.1.10	-Here is a link to the HDTV : http : //www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp ? logon= & langid=EN & sku_id=0665000FS10073650 & catid= #	St

1.2.2	No .	St
1.2.3	2 ) Is the 1366x768 resolution on this HDTV a low resolution for a PC monitor ?	Ques
1.2.4	Somewhat .	St
1.2.5	Most 22 & quot ; LCDs are 1680x1050 but they 're intended for desktop use ( 2-3 ' away from the user ) .	St
1.2.6	If you 're going to be 4 ' or more away , the LCD TV would be easier to read at its highest resolution ( and therefore best picture ) .	St
1.2.7	3 ) Is this resolution of 1366 by 768 better or worse than my current 17 inch monitor which has a native resolution of 1280 by 1024 ?	Ques
1.2.8	The TV has fewer pixels but its wider and bigger .	St
1.2.9	4 ) Is this resolution of 1366 by 768 not a standard resolution setting available on PC games ( so that I wo n't be able to set games to this setting and will be stuck with stretching issues ) ?	Ques
1.2.10	If the game supports widescreen you wo n't have any problem .	St
1.2.11	If it does n't , you 'll have the same problem as with any widescreen monitor .	St
1.2.12	I 've got a 22 & quot ; LCD monitor ( 1680x1050 ) and 26 & quot ; and 32 & quot ; LCD TVs ( both 1366x768 ) hooked up to PCs .	St
1.2.13	For desktop use , the 22 & quot ; ca n't be beat .	St
1.2.14	But for armchair use , the 32 & quot ; is the best choice .	St
1.3.1	It is definitely not 1080i ; it 's not even 720p .	St
1.3.2	They do sell them but it 's not cheap .	Sug
