1.1.1	I have a Thinkpad T22 running W2k with all the updates and hotfixes installed.	St
1.1.2	I am having issues with a Linksys WPC54G wireless adapter.	St
1.1.3	When starting the laptop with the adapter software installed, I get this error when the wireless monitor and wireless connection are enabled: External exception E06D7363.	St
1.1.4	I also get a runtime error on WPC54Cfg.exe file saying abnormal program termination.	St
1.1.5	I can eliminate this by removing the configuration utility from the Startup menu.	St
1.1.6	I think there is a software conflict somewhere, but have no idea where.	St
1.1.7	I can get it to work after I exit the wireless monitor providing I don't have any security enabled.	St
1.1.8	I am using a Linksys WRT54G wireless router.	St
1.1.9	The other wireless computer on the network (a Dell tower running XP Professional using a USB wireless adapter) works fine.	St
1.2.1	It's clear the drivers and apps are defective so either look for new ones at linksys or try another adapter.	St
