i apologize.
i didn't mean to make you upset and my intention was not to impede your progress.
i have gone through every post but you had never given a final assessment on that ms (microsoft) support article and noted if you followed the steps to completion.
i just thought i would bring that back up before you strip down your hdd and risk losing any info.
the instructions ted has given are simply for installing winxp on the new hdd.

no one has address the specific method of how you will be transfering the data from your original hdd to the new one.
.
.
.
you keep mentioning pc relocator, but don't conclude as to whether or not you intend to use it.
again, sorry if i upset you.
i simply made that post to make sure you had followed through with that suggestion the moderator had offered, albeit the way he kept bringing it up may have been unruly (to say the least).
it's midday here for me so i'll assume you are in the process of installing the new hdd and configuring internet access to get back to the forums.
until then, best of luck.
