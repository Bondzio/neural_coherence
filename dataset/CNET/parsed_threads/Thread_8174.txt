<s> I have an epox EP-9NDA3J Socket 939 AMD Athlon 64 Motherboard that supports SATA and IDE hardrives. </s>
<s> I am purchasing a new hardrive and would like to upgrade to a SATA 80G Drive. </s>
<s> I also have 2 60GB IDE drives, one of which I would like to use in either a raid configuration or to store data. </s>
<s> My questions are these: Will I have any difficulties using both a SATA and IDE drive in a raid configuration? </s>
<s> Will I have any difficulties transfering data from one to the other if I do not use a raid configuration? </s>
<s> Do I need to have two operating systems installed on both drives to use a raid configuration? </s>
<s> What specs should I look for in a SATA hardrive so I notice a difference in speed? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> I was thinking of purchasing this SATA hardrive. </s>
<s> Any thoughts on this drive? </s>

<s> What are you using your PC for ? </s>
<s> What do you think RAID will do for you ???? </s>
<s> How are you backing up your system ?? </s>
<s> Why 80GB...when you get get much more diskspace without spending much more $$ ? </s>
<s> For about $100 you can get state of the art 200 or 250GB HDD. </s>

<s> I do some gaming. </s>
<s> I guess I would like to do a Raid 0 configuration to speed up my gaming. </s>
<s> My understanding is that I do not need a second operating system installed to do this. </s>
<s> I guess then, my questions are narrowed down to these: Am I going to have a problem running Raid 0 configuration with a 80+ GB sized SATA hardrive and a 60GB IDE hardrive? </s>
<s> If not, does anyone have any recommendations for a hardrive? </s>
<s> Lastly, What steps will I need to utilize in order to implement this process? </s>
<s> Thanks, </s>
<s> Oh, I forgot to ad, currently, I really do not have a solid backup plan. </s>
<s> In the past I have used a 1gb thumbdrive to back up important documents and other items of importance; some I would just drop into my second hardrive. </s>
<s> I would do this by using the backup utility that comes with Windows XP. </s>
<s> Could I even use a 3rd drive as a backup in another Raid configuration? </s>
<s> It appears I do not want to set up a Raid 0 configuration; it looks to risky. </s>
<s> Can I do a Raid 1 with a SATA drive and an IDE drive? </s>
<s> Lastly, any recommendations for a SATA drive? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> To the best of my knowledge, you cannot mix SATA and PATA IDE drives in the same RAID array. </s>
<s> Most of the configurations I've seen recommend using the same make, model and capacity drive when you're building a RAID array. </s>
<s> Re RAID...help me understand why you want to use RAID at all ? </s>
<s> SATA HDDs....take a look at storagereview.com, tomshardware.com, anandtech.com, etc. </s>
<s> Then look a Newegg.com and see the buyer comments on the specific products you're interested in. </s>
<s> In real life SATA drives don't give you much more performanvce if any over the corresponding PATA drives. </s>
<s> The major benefit is they allow addition of more drives to the system, they don't require jumpering and they use less cumbersome cabling. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> As luck would have it....here's something directly from Kim Komando at komando.com on RAID &quot;Using RAID to backup data Q. I've lost two hard drives and had to rebuild stuff twice in a year, so the concept of RAID is starting to sound appealing. </s>
<s> I only know enough about RAID to be dangerous, so can you explain it? </s>
<s> Is this a good way to back up my computer? </s>
<s> A. I have a definite position on your question: maybe, but probably not! </s>
<s> Before I explain that, let's talk about RAID. </s>
<s> That's an acronym for redundant array of independent disks. </s>
<s> There are a number of ways to set up RAID. </s>
<s> I won't bore you with that. </s>
<s> You're talking about RAID1, or mirroring, so let's focus on that. </s>
<s> Mirroring simply means that you have two drives, and they have exactly the same things on them. </s>
<s> When you save a document, it is saved on both hard drives. </s>
<s> If the primary drive fails, you switch to the other. </s>
<s> Mirroring has long been used in Internet servers. </s>
<s> With it, a company doesn't have to worry about its Web site going down if a drive fails. </s>
<s> The secondary drive immediately takes over. </s>
<s> That could be helpful to you if you suffer drive failures. </s>
<s> However, I don't think RAID works well for backups. </s>
<s> When you establish a backup routine, you should back up your data day after day. </s>
<s> That way, you can go back in time to find uncorrupted data, if necessary. </s>
<s> Let me give you an example. </s>
<s> Say you have an important database file. </s>
<s> One day, the file will not open. </s>
<s> Something has happened, and the file is corrupted. </s>
<s> The data in that file is no longer available. </s>
<s> If you have a RAID mirror setup, the file on the backup drive will probably be in exactly the same shape. </s>
<s> Instead of being able to go to a backup from last week or last month, which is presumably uncorrupted, you have only a current, corrupted file. </s>
<s> So, although mirroring has its benefits, they pertain more to commercial situations. </s>
<s> (Some computers, including my office machine, have RAID0, or striping. </s>
<s> This divides data between two hard drives, supposedly making read and write operations faster. </s>
<s> Again, I think the benefit is marginal on the desktop.) </s>
<s> You should have a backup routine for your data. </s>
<s> At home, I copy my data to a second hard drive; at work, to the server. </s>
<s> You could combine your backup routine with an imaging program, such as Norton Ghost. </s>
<s> An imaging program allows you to take a picture of the hard drive, which you can use if your hard drive fails. </s>
<s> But the image is static. </s>
<s> So you need regular backups as you change or add files. </s>
<s> I considered installing a RAID setup when I built my home computer two years ago. </s>
<s> I intended to use it for backups, but I decided RAID was inadequate. </s>
<s> My advice is: Don't bother.&quot; </s>
<s> So I cannot use my IDE harddrive with a SATA hardrive as my primary? </s>
<s> You'll have to try that one... all of mine have been IDE primary with SATA secondary or SATA - SATA. </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>
