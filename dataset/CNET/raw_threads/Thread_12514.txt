It says to plug in the power supply first and then plug the USB into the computer. I rarely need to use the hard drive so I turn it off after I have used it. Is it safe to click &quot;Safely remove hardware&quot; but leave the USB plugged in and unplug it from the wall? Clearly next time I want to turn it on the USB will be plugged in which the manual^ says not to do.
