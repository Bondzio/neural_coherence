Hello, I currently have an Asus U81A, running Vista 64bit, and the hard drive just went bad.
The best price I can get on the repair is $250 which is about half of what I paid for the laptop 2 years ago.
I have loved this thing, but dont love vista.
So my should I just buy a new computer or fix this one?
And If I go for a new one what would be a good idea?
It has a 320gb hard drive and 4gb ram, with a intell core 2 duo.
I am a college student going into my last year, and this things computing power has been more than enough since I don't play a lot of games.
