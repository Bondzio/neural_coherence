the cfs subscription is more expensive on a soho unit because the soho is postioned more as a business class appliance (businesses are more apt to spend higher dollars than consumers).
consider purchasing a sonicwall tz150.
you should be able to purchase the firewall and the cfs for about the same cost as the soho for the first year.
the follow-on years should run you about $120 per year.
let me know if you need additional details.
