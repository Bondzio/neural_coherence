thanks for the quick reply.
i am sorry that i didn't provide you with proper details.
i plan on buying a low-end, locally assembled desktop.
the processor i am currently interested in is an intel core 2 duo 2.13ghz (e6420), 1066fsb.
also, it will have an ati pcie x16 radeon x1300 pro, 256mb graphics card to go with it.
so, my questions are as follows - 1. will an 800mhz 2x1gb ram make a huge difference as opposed to a 667mhz 2x1gb one?
2. how big is the difference between a 2.13ghz core 2 duo, 1066fsb (e6420) and a 1.86ghz core 2 duo, 1066fsb (e6320) speed-wise?
it's all about the money.
thanks.
