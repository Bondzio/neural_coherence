- yes = sure why not, it works and there's always some pc that needs a different and better drive.
- sometimes = if the need is there, why not and it's a known working drive, &quot;good to go&quot;.
- it depends = it always depends on need, cost, and availability not to mention its already in hand.
- never = can't say never unless its too old or weak on capacity.
i make it a point to toss 20gb or less.
however, if its broken, rarely does it make past the recycle bin.
but, its not like i do this every day or even monthly, maybe 3-4 a yr.. heck, there are 3tb drives out there.
if i have a 500gb and i used it for 2yrs+, then looking at an affordable 3tb is inviting.
it's been my experience that a good drive will last at least 5yrs.
or more.
however, if a drive pukes at 3yrs.
or less, its not worthwhile to save other than data and hope the warranty is still there.
