Sorry for not getting back soon enough.
Have so many forum post on this matter & can't keep up with all of them.
I installed a refurbished Asus board which I would rather had installed a OEM board but at least its up & going now.
The only problem with this Asus board is it has no sound from the rear ports so I had to install a 3rd party software program to get some sound.
Planning on when I have the funds replacing this board with a OEM board & put this one in a white box i have lying around for future building.
The EMachine D2346 is runing fine for now but put it aside till I can get another board.
Problem resolved & thanks for all you comments & tips & support on this issue.
David
