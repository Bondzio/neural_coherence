i have 2 custom pcs and 2 media extenders all hooked up to 4 tv's throughout the house.
the main pc acts as a server and game machine and is hooked up to my pre/pro (anthem d2) using windows vista.
i use nvidia 8800gtx's in sli for gaming, a ht omega claro soundcard, intel 2.6 ghz duo core processor, and 3gb ram.
i have 2 seagate barracudas for storage (300gb) and a wd raptor to run the operating system and front end programs.
i do not use any of the computers to watch movies unless they are downloaded as i feel the quality of the picture and sound is not as good as what i get from my denon 5910 and ps3.
the video cards were initially hooked up w/a dvi to hdmi cable, but there were handshake issues that made it necessary to restart the computer to get the video to work.
there are some devices that supposedly help eliminate this problem, but i have not tried them yet.
in the interim, i use a dvi to component adapter and it works fine (image not as sharp though).
i mainly use the computer for music.
i use itunes for organization and am still in the process of ripping my cd collection using the lossless option.
music sounds great for parties, out on the deck, etc.
not as good as using the cd directly or for critical listening, but you can't beat the convienence.
gaming is also a blast in full surround and a 60&quot; screen.
text gets a bit small, but i think that will improve when i switch back to the hdmi cable.
the best thing when gaming is instead of everyone crowded around a monitor, we can all sit on the couch or chairs comfortably.
another problem i initially had was finding a mouse and keyboard that would work well consistantly with the pc being located behind a wall.
i eneded up going with a bluetooth setup and everthing works great.
i went through a couple 2.4 ghz wireless setups and would get keyboard dropouts which was very annoying.
