1.1.1	I have an HP Pavilion Elite HPE running Windows 7 and want to upgrade to a dual dvi graphics card .	St
1.1.2	The most intense s/w I 'm running is Blu Ray movies and Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 10 .	St
1.1.3	Not planning on gaming with it .	St
1.1.4	Suggestions/advice ?	Ques
1.2.1	In fact , why not skip dual DVI and get HDMI ?	Ques
1.2.2	Since this is just for BR/BD play why not the usual ATI 5450 ?	Ques
1.2.3	https : //www.google.com/ # q=ati+5450 & amp ; hl=en & amp ; safe=off & amp ; prmd=imvns & amp ; source=univ & amp ; tbm=shop & amp ; tbo=u & amp ; sa=X & amp ; ei=DrGyTubgJ8vRiAK_1rWNBA & amp ; sqi=2 & amp ; ved=0CHAQrQQ & amp ; bav=on.2 , or.r_gc.r_pw. , cf.osb & amp ; fp=a88196fa830a7663 & amp ; biw=1366 & amp ; bih=589 Can be under 50 bucks .

1.3.1	Because the audio is playing from the computer output ports , there is no HDCP issue .	St
1.3.2	And this is not just for BR/BD .	St
1.3.3	Second , my monitors have DVI inputs , not HDMI .	St
1.3.4	Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 10 renders stuff in real time in Preview mode .	St
1.3.5	I do not know , however , if this is GPU or CPU intensive .	St
1.3.6	So , & quot ; the usual ATI 5450 & quot ; may be just fine .	St
1.3.7	But I 'm not sure .	Res
1.3.8	Which is why I 'm asking all you experts .	St
1.4.1	So far I 'm hearing no BD/BR play for non-HDCP systems .	St
1.4.2	http : //www.cyberlink.com/prog/support/cs/product-faq-content.do ? id=2577 and many other sites note this .	St
1.4.3	But hey , it 's your money to prove them wrong .	St
1.4.4	While the usual ATI5450 would be my choice given the non-gamer use , I do have better cards ready to talk about .	St
1.4.5	Do this - & gt ; Set the price you want to pay and then pick one at that price from this link .	St
1.4.6	http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card-gaming-performance,3042.html Once you pick out the card we 'll check the power supply rating .	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	Because the system came with a Blu Ray burner , and I 've watched Blu Ray movies on it , my assumption is that the HDCP encoding is built into the system , and separate from the video viewing/graphics card requirements .	St
1.5.2	Am I wrong ?	Ques
1.6.1	I did not read in prior posts that BD/BR was functional .	St
1.6.2	Folk have systems that do n't do this and I did n't know yours was OK. Now all we have to be sure of is that the DVI ports note HDCP in the new cards .	St
1.6.3	In short , the displays must have HDCP , the video cards must have HDCP and the BD player software have it 's decoder , etc .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	After a lot of reading , I think this card will do the trick .	St
1.7.2	And I found one for $ 65 including tax and shipping .	St
1.7.3	Thanks for all your input .	St
1.8.1	so I got the new card , and when I went to see what kind of card I was replacing I found ... a Radeon HD 5570 ! !	St
1.8.2	I did n't even care to check before because it did n't have the ports I needed .	St
1.8.3	The one I 'm replacing has an HDMI with the DVI , and I do n't have a monitor with an HDMI port .	St
1.8.4	And the new one has 1 GB DDR3 memory .	St
1.8.5	So I replaced it anyway .	St
1.8.6	But I thought you might find that an amusing ending ...	St
