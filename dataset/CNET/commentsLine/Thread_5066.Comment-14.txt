i just got off the phone with a great tech support from compaq.
he told me that the motherboard supports pc2100 and told me not to waste my money by buying any higher/faster, because the motherboard will only bring the speed down to the limit.
got that covered.
i understand what you meant by aging.
the tech mentioned that in similar term as well.
he was saying that all the computers being made today are having windows vista and alot more specs that it makes my computer seem &quot;so anicent&quot;.
i told him that this computer have been with me for 4 years and i'm not about to betray this computer.
i will stick with this computer until something dies, then i will get another computer.
only thing that i'm going to do with this computer is upgrading the memory.
he also recommend that i do not put 1024 mb of ram onto the computer, even tho it will support that much, so it does not put a strain on the system resources.
something like that.
he recommended that i only buy one of 512 and keep the 256, which totals to 768 mb.
i'll look into that link you provided.
i'm going to think about it and see if i want to go ahead and install 1024 mb of ram or save a little money by buying one 512 mb pc2100.
you have helped greatly and i thank you for that.
yes, the tech have said the same thing.
crucial does not carry pc2100 anymore, so thats why i was given the higher compatibles.
i'm going to see what i can find on the pc2100 at newegg and tigerdirect.
if nothing, then i'll go browse the pc3200 and consider your link.
i'm thinking that your suggestion is more likely, that way i have all the ram, just in case, as a buffer, so i dont get too low on ram.
i doubt that i would be maxing out that limit.
