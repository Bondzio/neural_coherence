I'm planning to build my own desktop for the first time (hence the name &quot;novicebuilder&quot; !) These are the specs I've come up with for my dream PC, which I plan to use as an all-in-one work/gaming/home theater system. Can someone please tell me if they notice any components here that have known compatibility issues with each other. Thank you in advance. Microsoft Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit OS on the following hardware: - Intel Core 2 Extreme QX 6800 2.93 Ghz 1066 Mhz processor - ASUS P5N32-E SLI nForce 680i SLI ATX Motherboard - NZXT Zero ATX Full Tower case w/ 7 x 120 mm fans, 1 x 80 mm fan, 7 expansion slots, 6 internal 3.5&quot;, 5 external 5.25&quot;, 2 external 3.5&quot; - Patriot PDC24G6400ELK 8GB (4 x 2GB) DDR2 800 Dual Channel RAM 5-5-5-12 EPP Ready - Thermaltake ATX12V 1000W Power supply w/ SLI support, Active PFC - EVGA 8800 Ultra 768MB graphics card - Creative Soundblaster X-fi Fatal1ty FPS sound card - Dell UltraSharp 2407WFP 1920x1200 Widescreen monitor DVI/VGA/S-Video/Component inputs 6ms 1000:1 - Creative GigaWorks S750 700W 7.1 speakers - ATI 100-715331 TV Wonder 650 HDTV Tuner/PVR PCI card - Seagate Barracuda HDD SATA 7200.10 ST3500630AS 500GB 16MB Cache - Seagate Barracuda HDD SATA 7200.10 ST3250620AS 250GB 16MB Cache (no RAID) - 2 Samsung SATA SH-S183L Lightscribe DVD burners ********* NOTE - One specific concern I do have is about the Mobo/OS/RAM compatibility. I want to have 8 gigs of RAM on Vista 64-bit. Now the mobo's spec does not mention if it supports Intel EMT64 technology. Does that mean that I cannot have 8 Gigs of RAM on this MOBO even with Vista-64 bit ? I've been wondering about this forever. Please help. ******** Any comments or suggestions regarding the above mentioned system configuration are welcome and would be greatly appreciated. Thanks again.

I saw 150 for that specific Mobo at Newegg. Generally ASUS has a memory compatibility list grouped by stick size at the downloads area for each Mobo. If you don't see it listed it could be an issue.

Now one of the reviewers stated that he was happy about the board supporting 8 GB, but didn't mention clearly if he actually had 8 GB on it. Now my question becomes: Even if the system does not have a problem recognizing 8 GB and shows 8 GB, how would you know if the system is ever using the second 4 gig pair when the first 4 gig pair is used up ? In other words, is it even theoretically possible for the system to ever use the 2nd pair of 4 gigs without Intel EMT support ? It says on the Intel QX6800 prod. brief .pdf file that EMT requires supporting Mobo, BIOS, and OS. any ideas ? thanks again

I'm sorry I don't know the answer to your question. Intel support and forums may also have an answer. I also tend to use google like a person and ask specific questions with sometimes very good results. Almost always I find it gets me to forum discussions similar to what I'm trying to find out. Glad the suggestions helped a bit.
