hey bob.
i'm running a completely new system from the tower, to everything inside of it (except the gpu).
completely fresh os install of win8.
my old system was a core 2 duo e5300, 4gb of ram 250gb hdd, win8, and i forget the exact mobo but it was an lga775 with q35 chipset.
i've also noticed that when the screen flashes and i have the display options in front of me, it goes from displaying &quot;syncmaster p2350(g)/p23500&quot; to &quot;generic non pnp monitor&quot; then flashes back and changes the name to my display device.
it's weird.
sorry if i left out any information, still kind of new to the forum scene.
thanks.
