your internet connection must be dsl or cable.
connect a wireless router to the dsl or cable modem.
install a wireless nic into the desktop or laptop.
you can now access the internet via the modem using rf (radio frequency in the ghz bandwidth).
my home network has a wireless router, d-link di-614+.
i have three desktops wired to three ports and the laptop has a wireless nic.
i can use it all over the house.
i could install a wireless nic into one of the desktops and use it in another room without running cat-5 wire.
that's it.
