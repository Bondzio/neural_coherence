I got a new computer.
And I want to get opins what to do with the old one.
Specs: HD = 80 gig Win Xp home edition AMD Athlon 64 processor speed 2160 Mhz Installed mem = 1 gig Model HP a1330e I have it up for sale for $125 but getting practically no replies.
So I'm thinking of dismantling it and selling off the parts.
However, I don't know how to wipe the hard drive clean.
Totally clean.
Step by step instructions thanks.
Do you think it's better to dismantle and sell parts?
