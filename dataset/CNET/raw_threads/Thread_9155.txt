I was able to obtain some free office equipment that consisted of a Netgear wireless bridge and an Axis Communications print server. Is it possible to create a wireless print server on my home network through a Wireless-G Linksys Router without having to go out and buy a wireless print server? I can configure the bridge and printer server seperately via direct connection to the router, but could not get anything to print when I hooked up the printer server to the bridge through a crossover cable. Any ideas? Thanks!
