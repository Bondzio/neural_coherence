<s> hi i was considering buying either a; Ageia physX accelerator OR a Radeon X1800xt crossfire edition master card, that i can work in crossfire with my existing X1800xt standard 256mb card. </s>
<s> I know that the xt master card has 512mb and that in order to use it in crossfire i would have to sacrifice half of this, and i have taken this into consideration. </s>
<s> I'll be gratefull for any help that anyone can offer, thanks in advance </s>
<s> physx is only in 2 titles now. </s>
<s> by the end of the year, it's *supposed* to be in 50 or so. </s>
<s> physx doesn't add better performance... it just gives you more objects and more realistic interactions. </s>
<s> havok fx is being supported by nvidia and ati so it will probably have a similar level of support as physx. </s>
<s> to quote tom's hardware: &quot;we cannot conclude that a PPU is necessary, because multi-core processors could handle gameplay and effects physics in the off cycles while the graphics hardware is not rendering. </s>
<s> Even using the specially-designed game demo gives us nothing compelling to recommend purchasing a PhysX based card. </s>
<s> We are still excited about what physics will bring to gaming, but we stand only on the doorstep of what could be the next greatest processing development.&quot; http://www.tomshardware.com/2006/07/19/is_ageias_physx_failing/page9.html </s>
