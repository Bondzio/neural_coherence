<s> While removing front of Compaq Presario to get CD rom out to put in a newer box, plug from off-on button pulled loose before I had the sense to unplug it by hand. </s>
<s> Don't know where to plug it back in. </s>
<s> Is it on the motherboard? </s>
<s> Does it mate with another plug? </s>
<s> On the power supply? </s>
<s> There's only enough wire length to reach about 1/3 of the way into the box, but I have only found places with not enough pins. </s>
<s> Can someone describe right where it connects? </s>
<s> It should be located on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Ususally at the front side of the case, at or near the bottom of the board. </s>
<s> Mine has a double row of small pins for various things to plug in. </s>
<s> The power switch, hdd led, case speaker, etc. </s>
<s> It should be printed on the board &quot;pwr&quot; or something similar. </s>
<s> If you have the manual that came with the computer, there should be a diagram of the motherboard with this information in it. </s>
<s> Good Luck. </s>
<s> I found the plug. </s>
<s> Reading &quot;pwr&quot; or anything else was out of the question. </s>
<s> It was too hard to see and reach. </s>
<s> With two long probes I painstakingly maneuvered the end down to the plug and somehow pushed it in. </s>
<s> The box even started up after I put it back together. </s>
