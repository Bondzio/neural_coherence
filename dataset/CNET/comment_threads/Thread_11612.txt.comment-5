That price looks pretty standard for the configuration that you are running.
In regards to AMD vs. Intel, the way the 3 processors that you are looking at would be rated overall, imo, would be the X2 4200 then X2 3800 and then the D930.
However, if you plan on getting this system upgraded, I would suggest going with intel dispite it being the slower processor because the current AMD chips are reachign the end of their lifespan.
