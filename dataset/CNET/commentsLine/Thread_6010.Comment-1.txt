my computer is about 5 years old.
i have two hard drives.
my main one is 250gb, and the other is an empty 40gb drive.
both are connected via a card taking up a slot, and the 250gb is my main drive.
i want to remove the 40gb drive, but when i disconnect it, my computer thinks there aren't any drives at all and won't boot.
i thought i might've confused the two, so i tried it the other way around and i got a message saying &quot;ntldr missing&quot;.
finally, i just reconnected both, and everything works fine again.
why won't my computer recognize my bootable hard drive without the other one?
it doesn't even show up in the bios settings without the 40gb, but it does when the 40gb is connected.
