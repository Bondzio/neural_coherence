I bought a Zalman, and they are so quiet, it is hard to believe that something that big can be so quiet, you could almost cool your house with it....lol.
However, the thing was too big, to use on the MOBO, that I had in mind, because the power supply gets in the way.
So, I may have to put it up on eBay, or save it for another MOBO, I hate to get rid of it.
It is sweet!
