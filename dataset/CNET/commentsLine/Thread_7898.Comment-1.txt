hi.
i'm currently searching for a hardware transcoding pci card.
i use adobe premier pro 2.0 as my non-linear editor.
what are some hardware options for accelerating my rendering times?
i'm also looking for a way to easily transcode (with hardware acceleration) various formats to mpeg2, m2v or vob files, for export to dvd.
thanks.
