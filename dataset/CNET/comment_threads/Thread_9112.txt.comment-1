I am hoping that some kind person,can enlighten me on the following problem.
I have some old Travan Sony tapes QTR-1, which hold 400MB uncompressed.
I don't have a Tape drive anymore but wonder if its worth keeping them or disposing of them.
I would like to get hold of a Tape drive and software that will work with Windows XP sp3 to utilise these tapes for Back-up etc.
Can someone help please.
Regards from the UK, David
