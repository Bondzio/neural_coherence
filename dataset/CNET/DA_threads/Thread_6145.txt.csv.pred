1.1.2	it had windows 2000 pro on it .	St
1.1.3	the person who gave it to me had put a administrator password on it , but forgot the password .	St
1.1.4	so i wanted to install windows xp pro and it would n't let me .	St
1.1.5	i tried everything ... i ended up putting the HD from the Dell in another computer and installed windows xp pro .	St
1.1.6	everything went smooth ... when i put the HD back into the Dell and fired it up.. i get an error that says that & quot ; the hardrive is corrupted or the IDE contollers are messed up .	St
1.1.7	it tells me to go to A : \chkdsk /F ... any ideas out there ?	Ques
1.2.1	it put all of the data related to the computer and it 's parts on it .	St
1.2.2	When you reformatted all of that data was lost .	St
1.2.3	The Dell system is looking for the data at the location that they keep it on the drive [ probably a hidden partition ] , therefore it assumes that the drive is corrupted .	St
1.2.4	Replacing or reformatting a drive on a proprietary computer , Dell , Compaq , Gateway , HP , et al always creates this problem .	St
1.2.5	The do n't give one the Op Sys CD they give a CD that can format et al the way that they want [ it has the cab files on it , but some of the cabs are modified to Dell 's desires .	St
1.2.6	All of the correct drivers are also on that CD .	St
1.2.7	Compaq has the access to the BIOS on the Hard drive , not sure about Dell .	St
1.2.8	You may be able to go to the Dell website to find out how to recover from this .	St
1.2.9	The Donor of the computer should have given you Dell 's restore/recovery CD .	St
