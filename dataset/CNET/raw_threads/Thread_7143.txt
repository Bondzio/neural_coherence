Since Socket 370 boards took a variety for Celeron and Pentium 3's and Socket 478 boards took a variety of Celeron and Pentium 4's the missing piece of information is: The make/model of the motherboard.

It would have been nice to know the model number of the machine to see if someone had a success story, but without more information, not only will you likely change the motherboard, but the power supply and case as well.

You didn't tell the forum how many seconds its taking so in my estimation, that's not the issue. 2. http://shopping.netledger.com/app/site/site.nl/site.ACCT72136/mode.items/sc.2/category.7/it.A/id.315/.f for example is a 100 MHz FSB CPU to fit such a machine. But if this was my machine, I'd know that any 100 MHz FSB CPU might work. I'd have to consider my risk quotient to see if I'd pop for this set: http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=CEL130015-NB The problem here is that P3's move the FSB up to 133 and we can't tell if you can do that. Sit the selection of possible items is the 219 dollar unit or this slightly faster Celeron. My choice? I wouldn't do this. 3. To speed up most machines, I find the following helps. a.
