<s> Could anyone suggest a case and powersupply to use for my Pentium D 830 build... </s>
<s> I have a good Idea of what MB i want but could base my decision on suggestions... Also, I would like to use XP MCE but can get XP Pro for 30 bucks at my university, any reason I should spend the extra 100 to get the media center version? </s>
<s> as for the psu i would get something from antec, ocz, seasonic, enermax that are at least 450watts or more. </s>
<s> as for the case, i dont know how much you want to spend for it, i guess this one, http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811119047 but it might take up room in the dorm. </s>
<s> If you are aiming at a MCE, it be better to stay away from the flashy gaming cases. </s>
<s> A elegant, yet expensive choice, would be Lian-Li. </s>
<s> Those cases could fit anywhere and still look good. </s>
<s> I don't reccomend the skinny cases (The ones that look like regular cases on their side). </s>
<s> They are smaller, and it looks like they are harder to upgrade. </s>
<s> Just wondering, any specific reason for using Intel? </s>
<s> Rather than AMD. </s>
<s> Don't want to start an argument, but the benches speak for themselvse. </s>
