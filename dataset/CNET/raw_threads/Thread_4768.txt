I read the review of the Dell Studio XPS here: http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/dell-studio-xps/4505-3118_7-33396858.html?tag=mncol;lst It is sweet. I bought it and realized that the keyboard included in the picture is not the one that my system is shipping with. Nobody at Dell seemed to know what it was either...they looked at the pic on CNET. If you zoom in, it is a Dell-branded item and it appears to have a cord. I love that low-profile look and I want it but I don't know what the heck it is! Any ideas?

But this particular board is a bit thiner, more narrow and less wide. It is of simple rectangular design, and the keys a bit smaller in over-all design. It seems Dell has been including this smaller keyboard with lower end products for a couple of years now. Probably just for over-all product and shipping costs savings. The System Information probably doesn't identify it as anything other than generic 101/102 standard keyboard. If you have this system, Belarc Adviser may be able to ID it a little more thoroughly.

I went on the Dell site and it doesn't appear to be included in any of their systems. If you search for all keyboards (there are a ton of them) it isn't to be found there either...I went through all of them. I just want to find it! Thanks, Peter

I just got it with my Inspiron 518 a month ago and I was surprised by it. It is not a standard keyboard; it's a multimedia keyboard and it has the touch of an Apple keyboard. I wish I could tell you more, but you're right in that you can't configure it online. Mine came with a PC that I bought at a third party vendor.

It's extremely well made and it's the most comfortable keyboard I've used in a long while, though the relative flatness of it (compared to the other keyboards I use) took some getting used to.
