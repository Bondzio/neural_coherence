Hi, I was working with my computer and suddenly it froze.
Then after rebutting the monitor, its does not come up.
Its stays black with a factory message stating that it has no problems and to check the cable connection.
I have unplugged, restarted from scratch several times with no luck.
I can hear the computer working and doing something but nothings comes up to the monitor.
I even have restarted with no other devices connected to my computer.
I have a Gateway PC1500, XP, Thanks... ...
