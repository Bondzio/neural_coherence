Then wizard searches for driver for PCI Multimedia Audio Device and I again cancel. In the device driver menu, there is nothing checked red or yellow. The only clues I have are: keyboard driver idvkd.sys driver not installed, and the CD-rom is set as secondary slave. There is no primary slave. There is no secondary master. Hard driver is primary master.

1124	2	141413	1586656	1586593	Willy	12/7/05 10:57 AM	1.13395302E12	Try	Those devices need attention. If those devices are unknown to you, don't worry, just hit the &quot;update&quot; button to find the best drivers when you click on that device. If none are found, then find them either on your system recovery/restore CDs or mtrbd. CD and point to them as the new source to check. -OR- load the required CD and match the device to driver and allow it to load. If all fails, thn simply remove or delete the device in question, upon next boot-up it should retry again to find proper drivers, then point to the known CDs that have such drivers. You can provide the drivers from the vendors support website for that device and d/l them and then extract such drivers and then use that source to load them. Did all this happen on thier own or did you installed &quot;new&quot; h/w, etc? You may want to try this forst before anything else. Use the &quot;restore&quot; feature of winXP or winMe to a date where problems weren't present. tada -----Willy

This computer was used at a technical college. There is no sound card in the computer at all so why does it keep finding a pci audio device?
1124	4	141413	1587209	1586699	Willy	12/7/05 2:53 PM	1.13396718E12	Quick checks	OK, sorry for no restore points. Anyways, besides an actual audio card, there are audio section build on mtrbds. I suggest you get the system checker: http://www.majorgeeks.com/ find everest system checker pgm. and d/l it. It will check your system for all devices. Yes, the audio portion will be seen as pci type. if present. A quick physical check of the audio ports found on the system case, look for 3-4 small RCA plug-ins, maybe labeled as spkr, input, output and/or mic, etc. tada -----Willy

I suspect you have a machine that requires mobo drivers, w98 won't do this for you. So...what you need to do is ID the mobo and then visit the makers site and then look around for sound drivers. While at the makers site you might want to look around for other drivers that support your mobo.
