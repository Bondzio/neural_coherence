I have an older Samsung SD-608 DVD ROM in my PIII 866 Mhz Desktop with 512 MB Memory and Windows XP Pro with SP2, that I self-built, but when I try to boot from my Mandrake Linux 10, Fedora Core 3, or Fedora Core 4 DVD, the system bypasses them and ignores my boot order (1st ATAPI CDROM, 2nd FLOPPY DRIVE, 3rd HARD DISK, and 4th NETWORK) so it just goes directly to the HDD and ignores the disk, note that my BIOS is the latest intel offered for the Intel Desktop Board EA81510A, from 6-19-2001, but when I boot from my Knoppix 3.9 CD or Windows 2000 or Windows XP CD, it will boot there, but when it comes to DVDs it just doesn't even acknowledge its existance.
PLEASE HELP!!!
