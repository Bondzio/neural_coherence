<s> I admittedly am a newbie when it comes to things like this, so I ask: is it better to get a Radeon X700 with PCIExpress, or a 9800 256mb with AGP? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> well if you have a integrated graphics card you know the on board then i would go with agp not pci cause the onboard graphic card will yield to the agp but will give you a fit with pci good luck </s>
<s> work stick with agp </s>
