<s> Can anyone help me? </s>
<s> I bought a Belkin wireless router that kept losing connection. </s>
<s> Then I bought a Linksys. </s>
<s> All my computers experience the same problem. </s>
<s> The wireless connection is not continuous. </s>
<s> Every 10-12 minutes I lose connection for about 2 minutes. </s>
<s> What could the problem be? </s>
<s> It is not in the routers, or computers. </s>
<s> I am also on my second modem from Comcast. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>

<s> Router defaults. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> WPA (not WPA2 for now) 3. </s>
<s> DO NOT HIDE the SSID. </s>
<s> Keep it simple and secure. </s>
