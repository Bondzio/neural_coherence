Im planning on buying a 1tb external to use between my vista system and my iMac running leopard 10.5.3.
I will be using lots of file storage for the drive as well as doing video editing on my mac.
So i will going between the two systems often.
I plan on getting a drive with multi functionality so i can use eSata with my pc and firewire 400 on my imac.
What is the best way to format drive for full use and or compatibility on both os.
Any suggestions?
