&quot;i have to boot from the &quot;acronis boot disk&quot;, to get my computer to boot from my external drive??
&quot; i never replace the manual since such methods can change with versions.
but here i boot my acronis boot cd and i can restore from a selected image file.
then again, i read the supplied manual.
