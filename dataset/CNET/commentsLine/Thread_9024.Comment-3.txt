it seems to me that that's the opposite of what i'm looking to do.
virtual router supposedly takes a wired internet connection and shares it wirelessly, but i'd like to take a wireless internet connection and share it over a wired local network.
it might very well have that functionality, but it's not advertised, and yes, it unfortunately requires windows 7 or 8
