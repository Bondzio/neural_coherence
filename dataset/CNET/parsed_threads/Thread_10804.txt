<s> Alright, so I got my computer custom made, and the day after i order it, I read something about how power supplies are the #1 Most overlooked part of a custom comp. </s>
<s> I got the intel i7 and a 400w power supply, should that be enough, because now that I have the computer, it worked fine for the first week, and now in the past 12 hours of use, it has turned off instantly 3 times now, the first two times i was running many things and thought it might have been a little too much for the power supply, but the most recent time, it turned off right when i started it up after going to google... </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for the help... </s>
<s> Checked the system temps ? </s>
<s> What else is in the system...specifically what parts by mfg and part number are in the system ? </s>
<s> And as always... all power supplies are not equal. </s>

<s> then i'd say the 400w power supply is probably too small. </s>
<s> and frankly your dealer should have told you that when you ordered your system. </s>
<s> Have you contacted them ? </s>
<s> http://www.sapphiretech.com/presentation/product/?psn=000101&pid=202 400 Watt or greater power supply (550 Watt for ATI CrossFireX technology in dual mode) is recommended. </s>

<s> Well, i guess i have the minimum, because i actually havent installed the crossfire myself, because due to some confusion in the order, they had sent the bridge but didnt install it in the computer, so i will have to uprade the power supply before installing it...thanks for your help guys! </s>
<s> installed and connected to the PSU ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Oh, I didn't know that if it wasn't being used that it would still run, then I guess yeah, the other card is installed just not connected with the crossfire link that I cannot figure out how to intall for the life of me... </s>
<s> cards are still running and pulling power from the bus....that's why you're having a problem now. </s>
<s> Just make sure you get a good quality PSU...because like everything all 600 watt PSUs are not equal. </s>
<s> The better ones use less electricity too. </s>
