1.2.1	I am assuming you are currently using the 15-pin Blue D-Sub for your monitor .	St
1.2.2	I have used both DVI and D-Sub and have seen NO differences .	St
1.2.3	I actually like D-Sub better because you can make adjustments , like contrast , move the & quot ; picture & quot ; around .	St
1.2.4	DVI is set at whatever .	St
1.2.5	My call : No need to buy a new card .	St
