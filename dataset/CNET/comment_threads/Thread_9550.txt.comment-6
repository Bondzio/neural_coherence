Mom's PC is a Dell Dimension 2400, Pentium 4, 256MB RAM.
I think I've already taken the original drive for other uses a while back, so the drive in it now isn't the original, or at least I don't think so.
So you know, it's just regular IDE on the motherboard, no PCI card involved.
Out of curiosity, would I still get the 8MB cache using my old drive in the external enclosure?
I'm not sure if that's even something that'd be affected by the enclosure, but I figured I'd ask.
This is only tangentially related, but I figured I'd save a new thread if it could be answered here; I somehow changed a couple of things on my old installation (including turning off fast user switching), which allowed me to get a Windows 2000-like admin screen with ctrl alt del (change password, task manager, lock desktop, shut down, etc), and Windows L locked the desktop, instead of went to the welcome screen.
I can't remember how to do that again; do you?
Thanks, later... you've answered most of my questions, and I'll talk to Mom tonight about the switch.
Peace out... g'day to ya.
