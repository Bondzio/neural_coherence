<s> Dear Friends I wish u r all in very good health ..... </s>
<s> I want to take your opinion about something .. My company will buy wireless APs .... </s>
<s> I want to know how to arrange the following products from the best to the worest and if i want to give them marks from 100 , can you help me ??? </s>
<s> The products are: 1)Cisco: ========&gt;Access Points (AIR-AP1252G-E-K9 & AIR-AP1142N-E-K9) 2)HP ========&gt;Access Points (HP ProCurve MSM410 WW) 3)Aruba ========&gt;Access Points (AP-121) ========&gt;Controller (200-6-AOS-STD) 4)D-Link ========&gt;Access Points (DAP-2590/EEU & DAP-3520) 5)LinkSys ========&gt;Access Points ( WAP4410N-G5 & WAP4400N & WAP200E-EU) Thanks in advance </s>
<s> All re-arrange under varying install site, conditions, YOUR CHOICE OF SETTINGS, firmware versions and if we include support the winner changes daily. </s>
<s> ALL those you listed are names I've installed in the last decade excep for ARUBA. </s>
<s> So I'll arrange all but ARUBA as number one and put ARUBA as item 2. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> Thanks for ur replay ... </s>
<s> I just ask about ranking products from best to worst accordng to the quality, the performance , the brand name and the reputation of the AP ... </s>
<s> So can u help me ?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> All are fine devices and companies and the winner will change depending on site, install location, settings and which tech support person you call. </s>
<s> ARUBA is not a name I've encountered in decades of setting up networks. </s>
<s> So that's the problem. </s>
<s> If you haven't been doing this for long you may think there is a good to best ranking. </s>
<s> The truth is deeper than that. </s>
