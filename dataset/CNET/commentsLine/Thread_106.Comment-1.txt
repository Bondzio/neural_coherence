hi, i'm in the market for a hd enclosure.
i plan on buying the new 1 terabyte hd by hitachi when it comes out this month.
but when i look for enclosures, a lot of them say that their maximum hd capacity is 500 gb, or 750 gb, etc.
since all 3.5&quot; hd's are the same size physically, why is there a capacity for an enclosure?
shouldn't it not matter?
would a 1 tb hd work in an enclosure that says their max is 500 gb?
thanks for the help
