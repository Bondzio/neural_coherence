thanks willy, i've given it plenty of time, while having a meal myself, but it just stands there.
and i've fed it a floppy &quot;cd-rom setup boot disk&quot; and left it both as press &lt;del&gt; to enter setup or as entering setup ... but it doesn't even try to read the floppy.
(i also got a floppy with dell dimension vxxx/vxxxc a08 flashbios but as long as floppies aren't read it's not of much use.)
i reseated the memory chips earlier to exclude that they were causing the error but it didn't change anything other than the amount of memory being counted.
suggestions?
is there a point in removing the cmos battery again?
