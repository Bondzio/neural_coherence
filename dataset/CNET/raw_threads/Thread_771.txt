Was using wrong speed CD media. In device manager the drive is listed as an LG CDRW CED-8080B drive, not the HP CD12i (12-10-32 speed) drive. It's apparently the firmware in the case. How can I get the drive to be recognized as an HP drive? BTW, zero help at the BYTECC site, I have filed complaints. Thanks.

Firmware version was LKS2. But it was some problems with modern high-speed media, and I can't find newest firmware from HP (see ftp://ftp.hp.com/pub/information_st...tware/fwrev.bin - newest firmware version is OKS2 version, but it's not present on HP ftp). Today I download newest firmware LS23 from Lite-On LTR-12101B (because one string on the writer case label is LTR-12101B)&quot; Just one of many examples where the dirty secret is HP doesn't make the drive. They buy OEM units and re-label. Your version of the HP CD12 (there are a through f?) may indeed be this drive. I'm sure that with some registry magic, you can have it show in the Device Manager as whatever you want, but I avoid such hoop jumping for reasons you can imagine. Bob

Closer inspection shows it as a COMPAQ drive!!! Son of a B****, I put the wrong drive in the case!!! I found the HP drive in another box. The Compaq drive was in the old HP drive box. The HP drive was in the Sony box. I feel so, stupid. Tons of emails and complaints and it was my fault. Time for a cold beer. Thanks Robert for making me look closely.

Too confusing for me, but I've labeled the boxes with what drive is inside. And now Device Manager in both laptops recognizes the HP drive, and the HP burning software works. Cold beer time.
