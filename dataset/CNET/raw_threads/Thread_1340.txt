I looked at an iPad and Amazon Fire but I wasn't sure if either supported Youtube and Netflix. I learned Samsung has Bluetooth and both Youtube and Netflix pre-installed. How easy is it to get connected when traveling? Also, I looked at two models at Bestbuy and I'm not sure what the difference is between the GT-N8013EAVXAR for $499 and the Model#: GT-P5113TSVXAR for $299. Can anyone more tech inclined explain it? I'd appreciate any recommendations as this is my first tablet purchase and I want to get the right one the first time. Thank you. Laura

If those that sell such will not explain what the difference, don't shop there. Or just showroom it and order online. Bob
