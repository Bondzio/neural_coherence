Hi.
I'm currently searching for a hardware transcoding PCI card.
I use Adobe Premier Pro 2.0 as my non-linear editor.
What are some hardware options for accelerating my rendering times?
I'm also looking for a way to easily transcode (with hardware acceleration) various formats to MPEG2, m2v or VOB files, for export to DVD.
Thanks.
