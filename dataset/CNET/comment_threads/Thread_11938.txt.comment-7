applications you're running and how you're running them.
If you run one program at a time or programs that don't need much RAM...more RAM doesn't make a noticeable difference.
Had you started with 256MBs RAM...you would have seen a greater difference.
If you upgrade or switch to Vista....2GB RAM becomes the new user standard.
If you go to tomshardware.com, you should be able to find an article saying essentially the same.
I'm sure there other similar articles or reviews.
Hope this clarifies.
