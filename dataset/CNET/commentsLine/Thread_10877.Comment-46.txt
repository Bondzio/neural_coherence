g'day janitorman.
it would appear you have not as yet converted to running at least a small(ish) ssd as your boot drive, in which case your statement 'systems now are so fast, including the huge standard drives, that speed is not noticeable.'
is inaccurate.
having recently replaced all c: drives in my house with 128gb ssd's (intel) i can assure you they *do* make a huge speed difference - especially if you are running xp.
as an example, one seriously old (pentium p1) pc here reduced boot-up times from 3+ minutes, to under 20 seconds.
my wife was / is using this pc, and she would switch it on in the morning, then go put her makeup on before going to work, then come back later to find that xp was finally running.
with the ssd, it is so quick now, she doesn't have to wait (very long) at all.
i suggest you at least try an ssd... you may be pleasantly surprised.
