You say it's a zif socket.
It sounds like it shouldn't be any harder than installing a processor.
I opted to buy the bios replacement chip because I figured it would be cheaper and less of a hassle than replacing the whole motherboard.
The BIOS chip cost me $20 plus shipping.
With it being a zif socket I feel like this is something I can do myself.
Thanks for your help.
