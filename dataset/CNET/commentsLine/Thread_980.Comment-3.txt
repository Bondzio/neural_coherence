bob, what more would you need to know?
what else might i need to install?
do you really want to know why i reinstalled windows 98?
it's a long story... suddenly, all my office programs stopped working.
other programs, too.
nothing would open properly.
after several days futzing around with things, checking websites, tweaking, sending messages, etc.
i decided to repair the registry.
since that didn't help, i restored the registry.
now things got really, really bad.
so i gave up and called dell.
they led me through the reinstall.
in any case, because everything old is gone (or on my backup drive) i wonder why it's important to describe why i reinstalled windows.
i downloaded the scanjet drivers and software from the hp site and assumed that was enough.
what might i be missing?
if i didn't provide enough information in my post, i'd really appreciate your advice on what other details i should include.
thanks, rita
