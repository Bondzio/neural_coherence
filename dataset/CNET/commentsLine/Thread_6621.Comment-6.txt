i'm having same problem.
this problem only happens to new release dvds.
i have powerdvd and windvd, and have 3 domputers with 3 different dvd-drives.
however results are same.
i was trying to watch 'transporter 2' which just came on blockbuster last week, but it won't play on a computer but my reg.
dvd-player plays it.
i think it's new copyright stuff or something.
sucks!
