hello, i have some computers in a workgroup and can't access my windows xp machine from the windows 2000 ones.
if i try to browse the xp computer, it prompts for a user name and password but won't log me in even when i try to log in as administrator.
i can, however, get to the windows 2000 computers from my xp one.
have any of you ever ran into a problem similar to this?
thanks, chris
