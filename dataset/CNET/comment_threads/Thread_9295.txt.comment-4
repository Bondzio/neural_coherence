For example, we have some P4 1.9 GHz machines that perform like P3 800 Mhz machines all due to a mistake by me to recycle some sticks of SDRAM.
Since the deed is done and the machines are used for email, Open Office and have no payback if I was to fix this issue, I haven't changed the motherboards and RAM, but I still kick myself over that one.

Oh, if your board does SDRAM, you won't see the BX issue I noted.
