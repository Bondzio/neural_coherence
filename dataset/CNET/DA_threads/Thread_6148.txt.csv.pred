1.1.1	I have a Seagate Barracuda 7200 rpm, SATA 200 GB hard disk, which I recently converted into a portable one by using one of those USB aluminum casings.	St
1.1.2	Everything was working fine until I copied some files from my friends computer, when a virus also lodged itself on my harddisk.	St
1.1.3	Now whenever I connected my harddisk to my laptop, the data was accessible but it always tried to autorun a program but thankfully my antivirus (Bitdefender V10) always stopped it from doing so.	St
1.1.4	One day I did a virus check on the harddisk using the same antivirus, It found a virus in one of the files but could not repair it so I deleted the file .	St
1.1.5	From that day on I am not able to access any data on my harddisk.	St
1.1.6	Whenever I connect it to my laptop, the harddisk is detected and I know this by: 1) The eject icon in the status bar 2) It lists the harddisk in the device manager 3) It also shows the harddisk on the BIOS settings menu at startup.	St
1.1.7	But the hard disk is not displayed in the explorer neither in DOS.	St
1.1.8	THERE IS AN OCCASIONAL BLIP-BLIP SOUND THAT COMES FROM THE HARDDISK AND THAT'S IT.	St
1.1.9	and there are two continuous blips at a time.	St
1.1.10	Also this harddisk does not have any OS on it and it has four equal partitions.	St
1.1.11	Please help me out........... preferably without formatting the harddisk.	Sug
1.1.12	And I didn't drop the hdd at any point of time however, I might have dropped the adapter at some point of time but still the lights on the adapter and the casing light up whenever I plug it in.	St
1.2.1	and connect direct to a desktop PC... You could also run the Seagate diagnostics too.	St
1.2.2	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	It's now suspect.	St
1.3.2	Try another or go direct connect in some desktop.	St
1.3.3	As to the autorun you could have fixed that fast by deleting the AUTORUN.INF file in the root of the drive... Bob	St
1.4.1	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	I have tried it connecting directly to another computer but still there is no response.	St
1.5.2	In case if you want to know the sound that comes from the harddisk it is at http://www.mediafire.com/?5fn1dglyixm	St
