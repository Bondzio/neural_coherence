<s> I have the same problem, my 80gb Western Digital USB drive is recognized by Disk Management but not &quot;My Computer&quot;. </s>
<s> I have Windows XP. </s>
<s> Do you know where the &quot;systems properties&quot; equivalent is in Window XP? </s>
<s> I note the same symptom if I plug mine into the USB 1.1 port rather than USB 2.0. </s>
<s> Go figure. </s>
<s> If you press Start, Help and Support, it has where that item is. </s>

<s> My Dell PC only has USB 1.1. </s>
<s> The Western Digital USB 80bg drive I'm trying to install is USB 2.0 but is &quot;backwards&quot; compatible. </s>
<s> When I first installed out of the box everything worked, drive letter was assigned (I didn't put any data on it). </s>
<s> Then I unpluged it without EJECTING HARDWARE (as I should have). </s>
<s> Then when I plugged it back in, the plug and play recognized it, added it in device manager but &quot;My Computer&quot; now didNOT recognize it. </s>
<s> Since then I've uninstalled all usb hubs/drivers etc in SAFE MODE, restarted Windows XP, plug and play recongnizes all my devices again, but now gives me a message when I attached my USB Drive - &quot;HI SPEED USB Device added to non-hi speed usb&quot; and &quot;Problem with install device may have problems&quot; and now the USB Drive doesNOT show up under Disk Drives in Device Manager and under USB Controllers, there is a yellow exclamation point. </s>
<s> I have SP1 and all updates to WindowXP. </s>
<s> Enough info? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help! </s>
<s> You can take my word that this rarely works. </s>
<s> I have found no cure for this behaviour besides installing an USB 2.0 PCI card. </s>
<s> At least such is cheap now. </s>
