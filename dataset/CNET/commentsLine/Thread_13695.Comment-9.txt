hi, what is too much?
graphical anomalies - when they show up (missing textures and that feeling of - oh dear, it's going to crash!)
that is when you've pushed too far.
this 'too much' limit is going to be different for every single card.
that means every single factory made ati 1600pro 512mb ddr2 agp like mine is uniquely different regarding overclocking.
one 1600pro will fail at default clock speed + 60mhz while another won't.
also to correct an earlier post - ati (along with nvidia) do not provide their own overclocking tools.
just because a mate has downloaded an utility called ati tools don't mean it came from ati.
either you get a 3d card overclocked at factory level or you void the warranty and do it yourself by using a free 3rd party program like ati tools or rivatuner if you have nvidia.
for some good advice try guru3.com btw - your cellar is the reason for your ability to overclock due to the low temperature.
and why do you own a high end pc with a mid range card?
