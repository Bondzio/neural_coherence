1.1.1	i'm thinking of buying hd 6670 but i'm afraid that it will burn my psu and i cant afford a new psu (pocket money problem) so my question is will it be safe to use radeon HD 6670 1 GB DDR5 with my psu https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=384849268239941&set=p.384849268239941&type=1 my pc specs are intel pentium e5400 @2.7 ghz motherboard - gigabyte g31m-es2l 4 gb ram windows 7 monitor resolution 1366x768 nvidia 9400 gt (current graphics card ) and the second question is is hd 6670 compatible with my motherboard	St
1.2.1	What are the power specs for each video card.	St
1.2.2	Compare them, then decide.	St
1.2.3	If all of this is too much, wait for $ in order to be sure your have a decent PSU capable of handling any power demands.	St
1.2.4	Not just enough but ample and capable.	St
1.2.5	On top of it all, how is your cooling of PC handling all this?	St
1.2.6	You have a 450W rated PSU.	St
1.2.7	Your current video card is what AGP or PCI-x16, your mtrb.	St
1.2.8	specs says???	St
1.2.9	again compare specs.	St
1.2.10	If you like, try PCWizard 2012 provides details of your current PC make-up.	St
1.2.11	BTW- Your picture is probably the best I've seen posted here where I can actually see w/o zooming in or losing details.	St
1.2.12	a nod to ya tada -----Willy	St
1.3.1	The 12v rail is where the action is.	St
1.3.2	Your psu has 18a........that assumes it can really put out that much.	St
1.3.3	That will xlate to about 215w.	St
1.3.4	Your cpu and new gpu will want about 135w.	St
1.3.5	That's tight........factor in misc and your headroom has gone to zip.	St
1.3.6	Your mobo has a pcie x16 slot.......the new gpu should fit.	St
1.3.7	Your call.	St
1.4.1	And it's just barely there.	St
1.4.2	If this PSU has other duties such as 20 hard drives, or is 2 years old then you are pressing your luck.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Hy bro!	St
1.5.2	ya thats not a big deal.	St
1.5.3	you can buy a regular psu at about rs.	St
1.5.4	700/-(Frontech 450W).	St
1.5.5	And dont worry i also using my old psu.	St
1.5.6	I am also using the XFX Radeon HD 6670 1GB DDR5 card in my pc & my screen res.	St
1.5.7	is as same as yours (1366x768).	St
1.5.8	And I am very satisfied.	St
1.5.9	I play most games mostly resent releases(Max Payne 3, Ghost Recon Future Soldier, Serious Sam BFE, Fifa 12, AC Revolutions, Saints Row the third, Skyrim V, Crysis 2 etc. )	St
1.5.10	and it give me verry good results.	St
