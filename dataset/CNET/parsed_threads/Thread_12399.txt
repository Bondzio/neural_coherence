<s> Is it possible to buy a blu ray optical drive for a laptop and swap it out for the standard dvd drive? </s>
<s> are there additional requirements (besides HD screen) needed on the machine to play blu ray discs? </s>
<s> if so, where would i be able to purchase a drive? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> OK I can't find the make, model of the laptop so I'll give the short version. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Sony made blu ray. </s>
<s> *hint* 2. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827118046 3. </s>
<s> But to play blu ray we need player software as there is no open source or free version. </s>
<s> Try this -&gt; http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdvd/overview_en_US.html Many laptops use SATA for that drive but with only what I read in this post I can't offer much else. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Okay thanks, I am thinking about doing this with a Toshiba Satellite model but I don't know how I'd find a drive that would match it's current DVD drive. </s>
<s> So I would indeed need to purchase blu ray capable software as well? </s>
<s> I think I see it's a Toshiba Satellite but with over a decade of models I can't say all will accept this drive. </s>
<s> As to the software, you dont have to buy that. </s>
<s> It's only needed for playing Blu ray discs. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> Sorry if this upsets anyone. </s>
<s> But without the model or better yet a link to the model's home page you will have to figure it out. </s>
<s> You gave no clue as to the laptop model# involved here. </s>
<s> If this is an older laptop, then I wouldn't wste time on this. </s>
<s> You need to be 100% sure the new BD drive fits and uses the same i/f the laptop offers. </s>
<s> When, I say fit that also means not only the size but that any cabling/harness will be proper. </s>
<s> This in not a done deal until that is known and quite frankly this isn't as open to be provided by the specs as one would think, so its a gamble. </s>
<s> Have the old DVD drive in hand to compare. </s>
<s> As stated to you the player s/w is going to be needed if you want BD viewing. </s>
<s> You should look for the &quot;bundled package&quot; for this as usually it's included or full retail kit. </s>
<s> Don't fall for the cheap offering which is called, the &quot;white box&quot; or sold as h/w(drive) only. </s>
<s> FYI, most new laptops don't even offer BD even though its been awhile already. </s>
<s> It's never really took off, IMO. </s>
<s> You maybe better served looking at ext. </s>
<s> BD playing setups, which in turn can be used on a desktop as well or move on to yet a better laptop when presented. </s>

<s> Sorry, it's a Toshiba Satellite A665-S5177X 15.6-Inch Laptop if that helps </s>
<s> SATA interface and what looks to be a standard bezel. </s>
<s> Some quibble if the bezel is not exact but this is as good as it gets. </s>
<s> so if I want to actually play blu ray discs with it, I could purchase that drive and I would still need some type of blu-ray-playing software, correct? </s>
<s> I thought that was answered. </s>
<s> If yes is not enough then try it without to see if you can save a buck. </s>
<s> BTW, I didn't comment on the laptop. </s>
<s> NICE CHOICE. </s>
<s> I like the CPU choice (i5) and with that you have the oomph to decode BD. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sorry, it's not the cost of the software I am worried about, I am just trying to make sure I have what I need. </s>
<s> You had mentioned above &quot;As to the software, you dont have to buy that. </s>
<s> It's only needed for playing Blu ray discs.&quot; but I don't know why else I would want to install a BD drive if I wasn't going to play discs with it. </s>
<s> Thanks for the replies! </s>
<s> There is such as thing as Bluray DATA discs. </s>
<s> And some folk already have the software. </s>
<s> Glad you got your answers. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Got it, Thanks again. </s>
