<s> You're SOL. </s>
<s> No overclocking a retail system. </s>
<s> I have windows xp media 2005 on the emachine can I install windows xp pro w/ sp2 </s>
<s> Sure you can install Windows XP pro w/ sp 2 all you need is an install disk and your ready to go. </s>
<s> And I also have an emachines with the same BIOS and motherboard, unfortunatley no you can't overclock that computer. </s>
<s> ok if I put windows xp pro will it still have the same bios </s>
<s> how come in my computer I go to system properties and it show 2.19GHz and 896 MB of Ram when I have 1gb </s>
<s> you would still have the same BIOS if you upgraded </s>
<s> have a an integrated graphics card that is sharing about 128 mb from your 1 gb of system RAM, leaving you with 896 mb. </s>
<s> To fix this you would have to get another graphics card that has dedicated video memory. </s>
<s> You would also have to uninstall your current integrated graphics card and to tell the computer to not share RAM anymore, you would have to change a setting in the BIOS or the jumper setting on your motherboard. </s>
<s> I can't really tell you exactly which setting or jumper to change because it's different with each motherboard, BIOS, and video card. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> your mp3 is probably malfunctioning, so I would exchange it for a new one. </s>
<s> just disregard that. </s>
<s> I accidentally confused you with someone else I apologize. </s>
<s> But the rest of the reply pertains to you. </s>
<s> ...won't change the fact that you can't overclock. </s>
<s> I agree with the statement about the integrated graphics using the RAM. </s>
<s> If you really want to overclock, get a new retail motherborad before you install XP Pro. </s>
<s> Can I remove the PCI Modern I don't even use it ? </s>
<s> ...along with any other PCI device that you're not using. </s>
