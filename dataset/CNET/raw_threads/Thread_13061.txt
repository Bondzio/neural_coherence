It said that Hyper-Threading was turned off for this processor. Why? Does anyone know how I can turn the Hyper-Threading on or do I need a new motherboard? Thanks in advance.

That's not the HT CPU. The HT CPUs have the 800MHz bus from what I see at Intel.com Bob

This is were I got my information from http://processorfinder.intel.com/scripts/details.asp?sspec=sl87l . If you read in the notes section it says Hyper-Threading is turned off, I thought it could be turned on. But it is probably turned off due to the 533MHz fsb. Thanks anyway.

I have the Intel Desktop Board D915GVWB, would this board support a pentium 4 hyper-threading cpu or better yet maybe one of intels new 6xx cpu for 64bit compatibility. Maybe I should just swap out the motherboard for a aftermarket motherboard with a new cpu. What 3rd party motherboard would fit inside my emachines T5026 case? Thanks again for all the help.

The CPU you have is not the HT variety. http://www.intel.com/design/motherbd/wb/ shows this board to have the needed CPU support, but this move is going to be expensive as you'll need new RAM as well as the CPU. I wouldn't do this with the 64-bit wave approaching. Bob

However, scrolling down, your 915GV chipset is not listed as one of those with HT. http://www.intel.com/products/ht/hyperthreading_more.htm They list these Intel desktop chipsets with 533/400 MHz as having HT: 910GL, 865P, 850E, 845PE, 845GE, 845GV, 845E, 845G I also note your Pent 4 processor number 519 is not listed with those that have HT support.

It seems as all the socket LGA775 are 800fsb when mine is only 533MHz. And the lowest CPU number I can see is 520. Looks like I'll need a new CPU,motherboard, and ram by 2006.
