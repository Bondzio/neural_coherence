<s> Just a simple question. </s>
<s> I am going finally do a long needed memory upgrade. </s>
<s> I currently have 128MB. </s>
<s> I know doubling would be suitable so what is best...get a single 256MB module, or can I slap another 128 module in the other slot? </s>
<s> Some motherboards can't use generic 256MB sticks. </s>
<s> What works fairly well is to get another stick of what you have if you can't identify the machine or if some homebrew, the make/model of the motherboard. </s>

<s> It's an older Gateway that I have access to all of the info on-line, but if it's easier to just get the same thing that is fine. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Most Intel BX chipset based systems can't use the low cost generic sticks. </s>
<s> It's too bad you didn't reveal the make and model number since such may not be one of the BX or i8xx chipsets that I know to proceed with care. </s>
<s> Easy out? </s>
