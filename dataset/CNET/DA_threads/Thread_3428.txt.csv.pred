1.2.1	A thumb drive is a nice way to transport data between PC 's and also as a medium for backup ( siince it 's only one of your backup media it 's not a problem if the data on it is lost then ) .	St
1.2.2	But it definitely is a bad place to store your only copy of data , especially if it contains the result of 'hard work ' .	St
1.2.3	Although it 's better than an external hard disk , your experience proves that it is n't fail-safe .	St
1.2.4	Nothing is fail-safe , by the way .	St
1.2.5	If your work is worth more than , say , USD 1000 , you can consider to contact drivesavers.com or some other trusted data recovery company .	St

1.3.1	While I always put it under a microscope I 'm encountering a lot of folk that demand details beyond what can be written here .	St
1.3.2	For example solder can crack and under the high power microscope we look for that and touch up the solder work .	St
1.3.3	But nobody that does n't do this today should attempt this when this is the last copy .	St
1.3.4	For the uninitiated you tell them to contact drivesavers and repeat these are great ways to transport but never a place for the last copy .	St

1.4.1	Any errors or some display of why it ca n't do what it did before .	St
1.4.2	Google for rescue/recovery s/w and check the results .	St
1.4.3	However , if it ca n't even see that a device is really there , you 're hosed .	St
1.4.4	ALWAYS have multiple sources stored of your precious data , now you know why .	St
1.4.5	adios -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	files are accessible .	St
1.5.2	I do n't know why this works , but sometimes it does .	St
1.5.3	Keep the chill times short , no more than 20 minutes , and check .	St
1.5.4	If no , then set it aside for an hour or so and try again .	St
1.5.5	Do n't give up .	St
1.5.6	I managed to get data back after 6 weeks of multiple tries .	St
1.5.7	A drive like this may become usable after a period of time of non-use , but that 's not a certain thing .	St
1.5.8	It happened with one of mine .	St
