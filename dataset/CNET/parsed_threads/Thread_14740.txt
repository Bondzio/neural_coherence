<s> I have an Xbox 360 Elite and unfortunately I also have a Netgrear Rangemax model # WNR834B v2 wireless router. </s>
<s> My router isnt recognizing my 360. </s>
<s> When I first bought the router the two worked fine. </s>
<s> For some reason it stopped. </s>
<s> I called Microsoft and they tell me that its the router. </s>
<s> I called Netgear for tech support and Im told that I have to pay for that support. </s>
<s> Im not. </s>
<s> Could anyone help me reconnect? </s>
<s> Pleeeaase! </s>
<s> You didn't tell how you added wireless or wifi or the 360 to your network. </s>
<s> I set my wireless connection to my Xbox when I first purchased my Netgear. </s>
<s> I went through the set-up procedures that Netgear provided. </s>
<s> I have tried to look for some type of installed program offline helper but there isn't one. </s>
<s> I never had to touch my wifi router to add my 360. </s>
<s> But I did have to add a wifi client or wifi &quot;bridge&quot; to my 360 and configure that. </s>
<s> For the official xbox 360 wifi thing there are screens on the 360 you go to, to set the wifi network you want to use, etc. </s>
<s> I don't duplicate web content on that but here's a page about the official wifi thing -&gt; http://www.xbox.com/en-US/hardware/x/xbox360wirelessnetadapter/default.htm Here's a video about setting that up -&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCGorxtSqbM Bob </s>
