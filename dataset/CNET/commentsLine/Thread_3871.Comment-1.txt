hi, i currently have a fujitsu-siemens scaleo p, with a motherboard model ga-8i848pm.
i have 1 x 512 ddr ram installed, and am looking to upgrade this.
i believe that the ram i have installed at the moment is pcr 2700, although i can't be sure.
i need to know whether i should add another 512 ram, another 1gb, or take the existing ram out and replace it with 1gb.
i am not sure whether there will be a great difference between these 3 options, and was hoping someone would help me out with making a decision.
i know that my computer does not support duel-channel memory.
another website suggested that i buy a stick of ram pcr 2300, but i'm not sure whether this will be different to buying another pcr 2700 as i have no idea what that actually means.
can anyone help out?
thanks.
