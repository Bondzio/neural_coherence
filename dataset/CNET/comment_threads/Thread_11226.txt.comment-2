that they did NOT say to not cover the entire heat spreader.
Seems that they want you to know that the CPU chip itself is only about 1 sq inch and thus is only a small portion of the heat spreader.
Seems that they simply want you to know that you MUST get the compound on the specific area where the CPU die contacts the heat spreader.
If I remember correctly the CPU chip is not exactly in the center of the heat spreader.
Thus if you get a nice uniform spread of the compound on most of the spreader you will include the most critical area.
