ok, there are many beep codes so i will give you the most common.
the beep codes come in groups of three, so 1-1-4 would be 1 long beep, 1 long beep and 4 short beeps.
so:- 1 short beep from loudspeaker system board passed ok ( display adapter, memory etc connected.
usual from a fully operational system ) no beeps dead system, check power supply, cpu,clock oscillator.
cpu fan turns, very litte else happening, check cpu.
keyboard lights flickered: if the keyboard lights flicker then go out but the computer does not boot, check cpu ic.
if they always flicker, turn off then wait 30 seconds, then on again.
there may have been a power-onsequence error or glitch at turn on.
1-1-3 cmos ram error one continuous beep check ram slots for ram inserted wrong or no ram ( known to happen when building boards) sometimes error message on screen 1-2-2 display error, bad display adaptor, adaptor needs re-seating.
turn off before any adjustments.
requirements: power supply, display adapter (if not onboard) monitor, cd-rom just connected to power lead (as load ) and power on switch to activate psu.
as have said, these are the most common codes that i use, there are many more.
hope this snippet helps someone out there.
