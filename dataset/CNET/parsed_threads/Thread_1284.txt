<s> Dell Dimension 8400, Win7 OS, Office 2007 Added second HDD since first HDD is filling up. </s>
<s> Is there a way to save info on second HDD automatically after the first HDD fills up? </s>
<s> Also, will the PC search both the first HDD and second HDD automatically after the fisrt HDD fills up? </s>
<s> There is no automatic search for new space in order to continue on as it were. </s>
<s> The system uses what it is &quot;directed&quot; to place data. </s>
<s> Once the new HD is installed, you need to either tell the system/pgm. </s>
<s> where to place data or configure it to do so. </s>
<s> The original pgm. </s>
<s> is the method to place whatever data is stored at, you may or will need as stated configure to a larger storage area if that's what you mean this is not done automatically. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> If your'e familiar in RAID configuration in hard drives then this might help you.By doing this, you'll let the system treat 2 or multiple physical disk into one logical unit making it easier for the user and the operating system used to configure storage within each application. </s>
<s> posted ? </s>
<s> You've posted the same response to two different questions neither of which addressed RAID. </s>

<s> * offtopic -Oh i'm sorry about that but once i replied to the problem, I don't know what happened cause my browser automatically redirected me to the wrong page in which i bet you see the same post. </s>
<s> i can't delete my other post so what's the solution?besides it's not my intention to double post </s>
<s> I see that you have it all in drive C. The partitioning of a HD is used to give him efficiency. </s>
<s> The HD are zoned, ie, the number of sectors per track increases as you go off from the center, keeping the density constant. </s>
<s> So, the outer tracks have a larger transfer rate, almost the double of the inner ones. </s>
<s> The first partition is the first from the ouside and so on. </s>
<s> If you create a first partition (which will be C) for your software and swapp files(virtual memory) you will greatly improve your system performance. </s>
<s> Don't forget that a volume must never be almost full. </s>
<s> Don't forget that you must leave space for swapp files, the most the better. </s>
<s> Then you create a partition for your working data whith enough space for what you think you will need, and one or two larger partitions for the largest files, like images, musics, videos , backups and so on. </s>
<s> And you can do so using the two HD. </s>
<s> Attention, partition must not be used to substitute the directories tree. </s>
<s> Only for efficiency. </s>
