My wireless network as well as phone service keeps on getting dead. I literally have to reset the network every couple of days. Currently the set up is as follow Cable Modem &gt;&gt;&gt; Phone Adaptor &gt;&gt;&gt; Router I also tried putting the router before the Adaptor but did not work. Anyone has first had experience of this kind of issue that can help me from configration of the network stand point so that I do not have to keep on resetting. Thanks in Advance!

If the RTP300 is connected directly to the modem, it crashes everyday and requires unplugging/plugging the power cord. The RTP300 can't handle alot of downloading from a computer plugged into it. The RTP300 will be more reliable if it just handles the phone calls. Connect the Belkin Pre-N to the modem, then the RTP300 to the first ethernet slot on the Belkin Pre-N router. You need to open the ports on the Belkin Pre-N Router to allow the Vonage VOIP traffic to get to the RTP300. Go into your Belkin Pre-N's setup menu 192.168.2.1 Click on the word Firewall. Click the Disable button next to Firewall Enable/Disable. Click Apply Changes button. You will need to enable QOS. Click on Channel and SSID. Next to 802.11e QoS, pick ON from the drop down menu. Click Apply Changes. Restart the Belkin Pre-N router for changes to take effect. Then, restart the RTP300. Instead of disabling the Belkin Pre-N's firewall you could do port forwarding. Otherwise, you will need a software based firewall on each of your computers.

I personally think belkin pre n router is the worst router that i have ever seen. The router cant go high speed. whenever i use the router to download such as BT or emule, it will be crashed, and i have to reset it. Also, I am a massive gamers, and i have to open ports for gaming. The router which has a very bad firewall options, and it is hard to config it. I have tried to flash the router with a 3rd party firmware, but it is still not working. I think it is just the poor design and structure of the router. I have no idea how the cnet editors rate and test the router, maybe they just test for range and speed, but didnt go for a crashed test. What I do: Put the router as An AP, and use the dlink 514 as a rotuer, which has never experience crash problem or slowdown.

If you don't have it, he suggests you can download a copy from the manufacturers site. Did you study the users guide already? Kees
