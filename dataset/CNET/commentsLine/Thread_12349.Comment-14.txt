i have been in this business for 20 years and i have a lot of worthless equipment from companies who have gone out of business or no longer support their product.
i try to buy from companies that i believe will be here in 10 years.
there is little price difference if you shop around.that said, i like linksys, netgear and belkin products.
they will be here when you need them!
