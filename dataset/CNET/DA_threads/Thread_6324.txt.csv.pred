1.1.1	I have a Intel 865PERLL board and would like to know what is the fastest processor I can use .	St
1.1.2	I have lost track of the terms used anymore so it would help me if you could link to the fastest processor and maybe one a little slower if there is a large price difference .	St
1.1.3	Thank you Gene	St
1.2.1	It 's the first question noted at http : //www.intel.com/design/motherbd/rl/rl_inst.htm Try that .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	This is the only fast processor that fits the board .	St
1.3.2	http : //www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp ? ProductCode=80663 & affiliate=yahoo I told you I have been away from this sort of thing for a while .	St
1.3.3	And about all I got from that link was I need a CPU with 512 L2 cache .	St
1.3.4	( Northwood ) And this is the only fast processor I could find that fits that bill .	St
1.3.5	( I think ) Thanks	St
1.4.1	that you have ?	Ques
1.4.2	It sure seems that the link that Robert gave you shows the answers to your question .	St
1.4.3	Why did you limit it to the link that you sent ?	Ques
1.5.1	But My board # is AAC27646-206 which seems to rule out the top 8 processors on the list or am I missing something ?	Ques
1.5.2	It seems I can only use a CPU with 512 L2 cache or again do I not understand ?	Ques
1.5.3	And after googling the only CPU I could find like that over 3 gb was that board .	St
1.5.4	And its too expensive I can almost get a new board and CPU for that price .	St
1.5.5	Does that board require the Northwood CPU ?	Ques
1.5.6	Thanks again	St
