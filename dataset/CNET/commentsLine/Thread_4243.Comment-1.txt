once in a while my computer will stop responding and i will have to shut it down via the power button.
after doing that it wont turn back on for an hour or two.
the power supply feels warm so i am assuming that is what is overheating.
i am fairly computer savy but never had problems with overheating before.
what should i do to solve the problem?
