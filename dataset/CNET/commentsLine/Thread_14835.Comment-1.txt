256mb card brand new in box when i install it windows autmatically asks me what to do i say cancel and then start the disk (like the book tells to to)... after i do &quot;easy install&quot; and it installs drivers and everything directx and what not it aks to reboot.
this is the funky part... after rebooting it shows the windows bar... about 26 times across =\ and then it goes to the black screen for about 6 seconds while you hear the hd kicking in, and then it shows the mouse with the busy icon next to it for about half a second, then it disappears and then nothing =( the screen just sits there and does nothing.
ok let me tell you how i have my bios set up, the agp is read first and then the aperture size was 128 cause i just had a 9200se but then i changed it to 256 for this new 9550. okay also when i uninstall all the drivers and hydravision etc from the add/remove (have to be in safe mode)it will work once more on regular mode, yet as soon as windows installs it's default or i install any one of the two drivers on the retail disk, it screws the same again, and again.
another weird thing i noticed is the driver says 9600 series yet when i do a manual install to the driver and uncheck compatible devises there are dirvers for the 9550 but when u check compatible devices then it only shows &quot;9600 series&quot; one more weird thing.... ok my monitor is vga and when it installs either default or through disk... it comes up that there is two display drivers... one is &quot;9600 series&quot; and the other is &quot;9600 series-secondary&quot; that is how it show on my system hardware... i am not sure why my computer just goes black with any drivers installed.. but i have tried to play ut2004 with just default drivers and it tells me something about directx which i have 9c right now, or it says something about my drivers... =\ i am very confused.
please help sumone
