<s> Hey guys, i have trouble here. </s>
<s> I have an ATi Radeon HD 5670, which i could sell. </s>
<s> And I looked around, and i found Gainward gtx 260. </s>
<s> It costs 60 $.Is it a good bargain to sell my ati and buy gtx 260? </s>
<s> I'm a gamer, and, unfortunately, i live in third class country, named Bosnia and Herzegovina. </s>
<s> (******) The gtx 260 is brand new, and have guarantee of 1 year. </s>
<s> http://www.hwcompare.com/115/geforce-gtx-260-vs-radeon-hd-5670/ </s>
<s> I won't go into deep details but some find gaming, when the ATI is trouble, switch to that other maker to escape some issues. </s>
<s> The 5670 is no slouch so gaming should be fine. </s>
<s> Why the need to change? </s>
<s> The 260 while an ok card should be nearly equal or less? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> For gaming the ATI looked ok with the 260 passing it by varying numbers. </s>
<s> But the KILLER ITEM is the extra 120 WATTS of power. </s>
<s> Most machines are not ready to deliver that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> As you can assume, rest of my machine, can deliver up to 250w of free juice, so i should be fine with it.Main reason why i want to change the card, is that she is 1 year old now, and this card is faster and brand new. </s>
<s> Another question is should I add another 40 bucks for an ati radeon 6770, that is also brand new? </s>
<s> Greeting, Fema </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Are you saying you have a 250w psu? </s>
<s> If so.......forget any of those cards.....that psu may not even have the aux power connector. </s>
<s> To really know if our Power Supply has some spare Watts we have TWO PROCEDURES or questions to answer. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Put the machine as-is on a Watt Meter and see what it's pulling while a game is running. </s>
<s> A P3 Watt Meter is 20 bucks and worth every dime as we can measure rather than guess if the PSU is up to the job. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Reveal EVERYTHING about the machine. </s>
<s> You claim it's 250 FREE Watts but didn't reveal how you know. </s>
<s> Reveal make, model of the machine and the Watts on the PSU. </s>
<s> Also TELL US the AMPERES rating of each Voltage RAIL. </s>
<s> It would be a shame for you to get a high Watt GPU card and have not done the work ahead of time with folk that know this area well (I'm an electronics designer and software author.) </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have 600 w power supply and psu has aux power connectors. </s>
<s> 2 pci-ex power connectors. </s>
<s> My system, has overall LOAD wattage of 278 W. So, i can imagine that even it is no name brand psu- which isn't, it is capable of delivering. </s>
<s> It is corsair gs 600-80 plus certified psu. </s>
<s> So i think it is capable. </s>
<s> +3.3v +5V +12V 25A 25A 48A Rest of the config is amd athlon 64 x2 5000+ 2.6ghz dual core processor M2N X PLUS asus motherboard NO-NAME ddr2 ram sticks 2x2 GB 160 gigs of hdd dvd rw drive LG and 6 120mm fans one 80 mm fan. </s>
<s> Cooler Master Hyper TX3 cpu cooling( uses 80 mm) </s>
<s> It's be fine. </s>
<s> And as the gamers often do, if it overheats you leave the side cover off. </s>
<s> As per benchmarks. </s>
<s> 5670 vs 260......260 wins. </s>
<s> As per numbers. </s>
<s> 260 vs 6770.....260 wins. </s>
<s> http://www.hwcompare.com/5818/geforce-gtx-260-vs-radeon-hd-6770/ Your call. </s>
<s> Doesn't side panel off, obstructs air flow in case? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> But the heat flows out of the case so fast that it doesn't matter that it's flowing in the case. </s>
<s> That is, we don't care about in case air flow but getting the hot air out which this accomplishes. </s>
<s> It's an old gamer solution that the new folk might question. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have not run a side panel or front panel for years. </s>
<s> My test show the machine runs cooler. </s>
<s> YMMV. </s>
<s> When it's cold outside, i put my pc toward the window. </s>
<s> so it pulls cold air, i managed to get cpu -5 celsius degree. </s>
<s> So we just leave the cover off. </s>
<s> But winter, thats a totally diferent story. </s>
<s> -20 Celsius degree. </s>
<s> brr Summer + 40 sometimes </s>
<s> Just to inform, i got a gtx 260. </s>
<s> Man it is 27 cm long.But its ok, btw my fans on gpu are at 30% all the time and i got 42 idle, 56-62 max load. </s>
<s> Should i crank up the fans? </s>
<s> Here's my personal setting on fans. </s>
<s> I set them to where that don't annoy me and then watch the temps. </s>
<s> But later I found the case cover off was the way to get the lowest temps with less fans and noise. </s>
<s> I think many gamers discover this sooner or later. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> 30% is when i dont hear them and with this speed, it maintain pretty good temps </s>
