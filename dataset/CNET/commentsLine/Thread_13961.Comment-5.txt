wow.
you guys didn't read my post.
this happened with two completely different motherboards.
i stated this clearly.
so &quot;bad caps&quot; is out.
since there has been no other power related issues, i do not believe it is the psu.
since there are no other issues whatsoever, i doubt it's the ram.
i regularly put my machine under heavy use (modern video gaming and hd audio/video rendering.
i never (never) have any problems outside of normal expected software quirks.
i'm going to go ahead and transfer my rig into the new case.
i'm guessing the issue is with the power switch on the case.
i talked with a buddy since posting this.
he's heard of such.
(bad switch on chassis)
