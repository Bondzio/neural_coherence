not the simplest question, because it calls for more than one factor.
first you need to find out,(1) just how much ram your motherboard can handle and then,(2) how big a video card it will carry.
i doubt that the pc you're describing will handle the high end games.
but if you can establish that it does have the capability, then you can always find ram at a good price to increase your system's capacity and the video card (on up to 1 gig) at a later time.
the most important thing is to find out just how &quot;good&quot; your pc is, before you start pumping money into it.
