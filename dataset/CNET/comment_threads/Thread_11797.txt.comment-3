You can count on there being new models whenever a new OS ships.
If the Compaq is annoying, it'd be fine to replace with iMac now.
They've recently been renewed, in the sense of getting bigger drives and faster CPUs.
Also a lot of people who run Leopard upgraded from earlier versions, so I'd be willing to wager an upgrade to 10.6 from 10.5.x will be available and pretty easy.
