Given a choice....I always recommend getting the KITs as they are usually made of chips from the same batches and should be matched.
Second recommend getting all the RAM for the target PC in 2 DIMMs (2@1GB) vice 4 DIMMs (4@512MBs).
If you get one DIMM now and one DIMM 6 months from now it's unlikely they'll be exactly the same.
Whenever you buy RAM....test the RAM with Memtest86+ as soon as you receive and install the new RAM.
By the way...there's no such thing as DUAL CHANNEL MEMORY...there's only RAM that works in systems with DUAL CHANNEL MEMORY ARCHITECTURE.
