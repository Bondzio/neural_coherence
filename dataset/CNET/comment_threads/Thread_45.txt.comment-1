i'm looking to upgrade my current pc (733mhz p3) which i purchased from dell about 5 years ago...i can't afford a whole new system so i'm going to replace the motherboard, cpu and memory for now and replace other components as $ permits... here is what i'm looking at now: MB: ASUS &quot;P4C800-E DELUXE&quot; i875P Chipset Motherboard for Intel Socket 478 CPU CPU: Intel Pentium 4/ 3.2E GHz 800MHz FSB, 1MB L2 Cache, Hyper Threading Technology RAM: Corsair Value Select 184 Pin 512MB DDR PC-3200 i'll also be upgrading to windows xp(from 98se).
with the exception of HD's/optical drives everything else is the same as when i got it 5 years ago...am i missing anything???
comments??
thanks
