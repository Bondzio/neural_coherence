<s> Hello, everyone. </s>
<s> I just bought a new monitor for my computer and I would also like to upgrade the graphics card. </s>
<s> I have a Dell Dimension 9150 with the stock GeForce 7300LE graphics card, I have 4 gigs of ram. </s>
<s> I've gone from a dell 19 in monitor to a Dell ST2410 and would like to get your input on what card would be a good replacement for the GeForce. </s>
<s> As I'am sure you can see by this, this is not a gaming computer. </s>
<s> Thank You all in advance. </s>

<s> how much do you want to spend on a new video card, and what are the main functions of the computer (eg: what do you use the PC for...editing videos, CAD, watching some movies, surfing the net, etc.) </s>
<s> Hi, Brechan. </s>
<s> Well, our needs are fairly low key, do alot of photo shop, no videos, alot of web surfing, no games, our grandson plays alot of games but he's only 6 so the games he does play are not graphics hogs. </s>
<s> No, I wouldn't assume to get something that could never be put to good use but I seem to get so much conflicting information from the web. </s>
<s> If your power supply is lacking, don't get this card. </s>
<s> If you're looking at this card, you would be better off getting the new generation of this other card. </s>
<s> Stuff like that. </s>
<s> I don't want overkill but certainly don't want to come up short either. </s>
<s> Have looked at the GT250, and the 5670( I may be off on these models. </s>
<s> I'm going from memory not knowledge)but just don't know enough about this stuff to made a decision. </s>
<s> I've tried to educate myself a little but it seems that there are so many variables that I just get more confused. </s>
<s> So, that is why I was hoping one or more of you Brainiacs that understand whats going on could help. </s>
<s> I wouldn't think that this change should cost more than 100 dollars but money is not the problem, getting too much card is. </s>
<s> Again, Thanks. </s>

<s> http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim9150/ has what I need to know. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> PCIe x16 slot. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> PSU Wattage 375 W I'm going to share I used a Zotac GT240 1GB fanless card from amazon.com. </s>
<s> I mention this because I have it and put it on a Watt meter. </s>
<s> The entire HP d4999t with this card barely breaks 120 Watts during a video game. </s>
<s> It is under 100 Watts at most other times. </s>
<s> This means it won't push you into a power supply upgrade. </s>
<s> Here's the link -&gt; http://www.amazon.com/ZOTAC-nVidia-GeForce-PCI-Express-ZT-20404-20L/dp/B002X7A6N4/ref=pd_sxp_grid_pt_0_0 It is under 92 bucks. </s>

<s> Thanks for the reply Bob. </s>
<s> I will look into this and try to educate myself with this info. </s>
<s> The power supply is, I would guess is just one of a few factors that would come into play with my request. </s>
<s> Thank You. </s>

<s> Hi, everyone. </s>
<s> So, I'll try this with a little bit more to get more response. </s>
<s> What if I upgraded to say a 550 or larger psu? </s>
<s> I know that my computer is old and only running a Pentium D. Would it make sense to be able to go to a modern graphics card? </s>
<s> Or is this just a waste of money in your opinion. </s>
<s> I like what Bob had to say about the GT240 but I'm still a little concerned about power. </s>
<s> mightymike </s>
<s> And the next model card down. </s>
<s> Ran great. </s>
<s> While you could move to a better video card, I have used that model a few times and since I have a Watt Meter I've done the tests to show we don't have to replace the PSU. </s>
