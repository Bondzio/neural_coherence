Check your motherboard manual for what is written about dual channel configurations on that particular board.
Although that is not an Intel motherboard, here is what Intel says about it: http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/cs-011965.htm If you have a 256MB module in each of the slots that makes up channel A, you would then need to install a 512MB module in channel B to match the total in Channel A (if adding just one module).
Of course, as shown in the above Intel.com link, dual channel mode may be achieved with other configurations.
Dual channel module purchase preferences: 1.
Purchase matched pairs tested to work together.
2.
Purchase exact same model numbers.
3.
Purchase exact same density, frequency, and timings.
