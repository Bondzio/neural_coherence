ok so i have a dvd box set that i stupidly ordered from a seller located in the uk.
problem is that they are a different region as the us.
this wouldn't be such a problem but it seems like everything is equipped with these lame region restrictions.
the most problematic at this time is my dvd-rw drive.
apparently you can only change it's region a limited number of times and i have reached the limit.
my question for all the geekier people out there than myself is what can i do to beat the region problem?
below is link to a screen shot of the driver region status for the dvd-rw which is basically saying i'm screwed.
btw i have a emachines t6410 (i know it's lame) any help or advice at all would be greatly appreciated!
thanks, paul
