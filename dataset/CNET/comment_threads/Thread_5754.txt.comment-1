Based on your introduction I purchased an HP TouchSmart IQ524 several weeks ago.
I am very happy with it, but for one thing.
In my research I thought this model had TV rececption capability, but it does not.
I have tried to purchase compatible USB tuner sticks however non have been compatible with my Dish HDTV home network.
Might you have any suggestions on what is necessary for me to add this feature?
I would appreciate any and all ideas.
Thanks
