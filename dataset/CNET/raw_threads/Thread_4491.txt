4473	0	278770	2672004	NR	maydk65	1/6/08 12:05 PM	1.1996211E12	To Dual Channel or Not Dual Channel My Memory	I have a ASUS P5N-E SLI motherboard (Slot 775) with a P-IV 3.6 Mhz. cpu. The mobo allows you to Dual Channel your memory or not based on how you plug your memory chips in. It auto detects the configuration at boot. I currently have it in Dual channel mode, with (2) 1GB Kingstion DDR2 566 running at 333MHZ. I am also running a geforce 8600 w/512mb video card. I use my cpu for gaming (World in Conflict)and online research. So, which is better for my gaming, dual channel or not? I just want to get the most out of what I have.
