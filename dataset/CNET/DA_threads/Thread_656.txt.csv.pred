1.1.3	Thank You for Your Help David	St
1.2.1	You break something .	St
1.2.2	The contact system even with the wrong material is somewhere about 500 cycles but with the proper material is well into the 10,000 and up range .	St
1.2.3	2 .	St
1.2.4	Not a firm number but you get 10,000 to 1,000,000 erase cycles .	St
1.2.5	Now this is actually a number higher since that refers to single bank or cell erasures and only when you & quot ; flip the bit & quot ; .	St
1.2.6	More reading at http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory Bob	St
1.3.1	For all intents and purposes , you 're NOT going to wear out the flash drive .	St
1.3.2	Excluding any h/w faults such as peeled or dirty contacts or ESD damage , the flash drive is n't going to wear out .	St
1.3.3	You may encounter a s/w glitch or such , but these are usually known and can be corrected or googled for a fix .	St
1.3.4	As for ESD ( static ) damage be sure to ground yourself before handling your drive , after all the drive runs on 5Vs , static can generate well beyond that and having it in your hand then touching the USB port can ( and has ) be discharged through it causing weird or unexplained headaches of why things do n't work in the future .	St
1.3.5	Google using keywords : 'flash drive life cycle ' or similar tada -- -- -Willy	St
