take a good machine and put the suspect part (singular) in.
if no video it's that part or that part is misconfigured.
examples?
sure but since i can't see the machine i can't guess if these are good or bad guesses.
ready?
1. the atx12v is unplugged.
2. the motherboard is one where the manual has the typographic error about the hdd led connection.
there was many thousands of boards that came back but were fine if they unplugged that connection (or read the updated manual.)
3. the cmos battery is low.
4. the cmos clear jumper is on &quot;clear.&quot; lots of reasons, too many for me to list them all but i thought i'd share my hit parade from last month.
