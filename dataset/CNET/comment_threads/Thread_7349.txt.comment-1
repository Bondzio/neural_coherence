I am trying water cooling for the first time and something weird is happening.
My loop is working fine and I am using a T-line to fill it.
It is full and almost bubble free however when I turn the pump off the water level rises a little bit in the filling tube.
Does anyone know why the water level might rise when I turn the pump off?
