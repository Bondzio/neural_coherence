i created a cnet membership only so that i could thank you for posting this solution.
i'm not charliegirl, obviously, but i have the same problem.
for a while, turning my firewall off would allow me to access some sites that work on my xp machine but not on my vista machine.
but i tried your solution, and so far, it seems to be working.
i have a sneaking suspicion that counterspy might have been part of the problem--a service i disabled.
but the computer is running much better now.
and a site that wasn't loading before (one i need for work) is now working fine, with the firewall on and working.
sigh.
thank you.
