<s> I just purchased a Dell 9100 and am about to set it up. </s>
<s> I saw a post on this board a while back from someone that had great advice for basic things to do regarding backups and other general setups for new computers. </s>
<s> I have searched for it but can't find it again. </s>
<s> Does anyone know where this can be found and point me in the right direction? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> The new PC should have come with a restoral CD, one that will restore the PC to day one, put it back like the day you bought it. </s>
<s> All other data such as documents, pictures, email addresses, emails, favorites, etc. </s>
<s> can simply be burned to optical media. </s>
<s> After a catastrophic failure you can run the Restoral CD, then copy the other files saved to optical media back to the PC. </s>
<s> I find this is much easier than finding a &quot;backup&quot; program to run. </s>
<s> Most backup programs tend to be a hassle. </s>
<s> At my site below I have a great little utility called OE Freebie Backup. </s>
<s> It will back up your email account, everything there, in one or two clicks. </s>
<s> Scroll down to the Free Software link. </s>

<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> That was very useful information. </s>
<s> Question about creating my own system backup/recovery CD. </s>
<s> Do I need a product like Norton Ghost or can I create a system backup CD/DVD with the native tools that come on the Dell 9100. </s>
<s> Excuse my ignorance, not a complete newbie, but not a real techie either. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply and the link to your information. </s>
<s> Using the native software should be OK for simple file backups but to do cloning (that's taking an exact copy of the hard drive) one of the commercial applications would probably serve you better. </s>
<s> I use Acronis. </s>
<s> It satifies my requirements for both cloning and incremental backups. </s>
<s> Some people swear by Ghost but I stay away from all Symantic applications (had very bad experience). </s>
<s> There are several others out there. </s>
<s> It just depends on what you want to accomplish. </s>
<s> Some don't clone, others do. </s>
<s> If you're going to backup a lot of data I would recommend an external hard drive. </s>
<s> Just don't leave it in-line after you're done with it. </s>
