I narrowed it down to the Logitech Z-5500 or Bose Companion 3 speaker system. I wanted to get people's thoughts and/or experiences with these two. I like the Bose for it's simple look, but would not want to sacrifice quality that the Logitech Z-5500 might potentially offer. Thanks in advance everyone.
