<s> I recently installed an additional hard drive to my computer, I used the CS jumpers in my &quot;master&quot; &quot;slave&quot; drives&quot;; when I rebooted my computer I went into the BIOS and selected Auto to configure my drives. </s>
<s> the second driuve was not recognized immediatoly so I installed the driver that came with my Maxtor drive. </s>
<s> after I installed the driver, the computer recognized the drive and assigned new drive letters but aqt the same time it does not recognizes my dvd drive that I had installed a few weeks earlier (using the IDE connector cable for the original CD drive ) using the CS configuration. </s>
<s> Prior to installing my new hard drive I had the following: C:\Hard drive D:\ CD drive E:\DVD burner now, it shows: C:\ 1st hard drive D:\ 2d hard drive E&quot;\ CD drive HELP! </s>

<s> For your hard disks CS is likely PROPER on the proper 80 conductor cables. </s>
<s> But most CD and such in stock computers use the older 40 conductor cables you use the MASTER and SLAVE settings. </s>

<s> Bob, I did the changes that you suggested, set my cdrom drive to master and DVD burner to slave, and now my computer is recognizing all my drives. </s>
<s> Thank you very much. </s>
