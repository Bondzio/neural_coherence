4249	7	110999	1262495	1261113	Ray Harinec	6/24/05 4:33 PM	1.11963078E12	hope jonahs link helped	possible overclocking already increase ram speed intel made mobo likely really support overclocking talking nonintel mobo intel chipset many those support form overclocking saw nothing wrong posting such question stick around forums
4249	8	110999	1262626	1262495	law_john	6/24/05 6:05 PM	1.1196363E12	thank	thank ray being nice certainly stay forums thank too jonah giving such informative link motherboard made ecs found overclocking cpu speed found way oc ram affect system bus learned link thanks ray jonah anyone else who joins post

4249	10	110999	1264001	1262703	law_john	6/25/05 2:46 PM	1.11971076E12	re	same go pcie video cards bios says cpu speed same ram mhz put auto manual saying raise raise fsb speed oc ram right how far too far voltage wise last question fsb mhz hyper threading need ddr memory mb doesnt support
4249	11	110999	1264509	1264001	ozos	6/25/05 10:40 PM	1.1197392E12	ugh ddr	few things where nothing hang head say simply tell few things pcie video card overclocks identical agp card terms how done pcie xl agp xl different gpu could identical agp cards wont oc mhz gives mhz overclocking video card please consider following ideally ram twice core clock most cards cards such fx xt however case look ocing coolbits geforce ti running core speed ram speed try keep ratio go mhz time core starts goto try hit test settings wtih coolbits each time hit apply each time passes hit apply wont put oc desired level raise ram accordingly volts go far stock id suggest leaving ram stock voltage leave voltage alone cpu leave addition noone bothered tell guy he doesnt pcie slot using geforce ti agp

4249	14	110999	1265800	1264942	law_john	6/26/05 7:58 PM	1.11981588E12	NIL	motherboard made ecs pa chipset lga link subwebaddr havent heard dual channel except ddr need pc ram higher run hyper threading most effectively cards run mhz ht really mhz bands right anyways looks ill buying ram soon
