A friend of mine just presented me with a thumbdrive he reformatted at work which refuses to work now. I took a look at it and it states in the info panel that it is read only. There is no visible locking switch on the outside of the case. His problems began when he threw away the security software folders that came in the drive and then reformatted it with the disc utility. There is no manufacturer's name or identifying serial number on the case of the drive. I have tried to reformat it using both the utility on my mac and the utility built into my XP windows machine. The XP says the drive is &quot;write protected&quot; and won't do anything with it. Mac Disc Utility gives this bit of information when I try to verify the disc... Verifying volume reformatted Checking HFS volume. Checking Extents Overflow file. Checking Catalog file. Checking Catalog hierarchy. Invalid directory item count (It should be 6 instead of 0) Invalid directory item count (It should be 4 instead of 2) Checking volume bitmap. Volume Bit Map needs minor repair Checking volume information. Master Directory Block needs minor repair me %@ needs to be repaired.&quot;,1) reformatted Error: The underlying task reported failure on exit 1 HFS volume checked

Select the disk and choose the Erase tab. Then select Security Options and choose Zero Out all Data. This will write zero's to the disk, the default method just messes with the directory, and leaves the stick with no readable format on it. Once that is complete, format the stick as you would normally do for a Mac disk. It's worth a try. P

I unmounted and mounted it from the disc utility... no luck. Maybe I will try rebooting my computer and see if that helps. I will let you know. Thanks grim

I don't have the Mac repair utilities you mentioned so I took the drive and stuck it back into my winbox and took out an old copy of Norton DiscDoctor for PC on disc. It registered problems in the FAT32 allocation on the drive when I booted it up and began to repair the DOS partitions on all discs. The thumbdrive registered as Apple formatted when plugged into my mac... but registers as RAW files when Properties are checked when connected to the PC. I wasn't sure if it was registering the PC's HD or the thumb drive so I stopped it and retried the thumbdrive in my mac. Disc Utility now allows the erase function to be selected... but still fails to erase or partition because it says the disc can not be &quot;unmounted&quot;. The thumbdrive will not eject either but Finder does allow some old files to be viewed and the info button says you can read and write to the drive. I will try the drive again on my PC... but right now, I'm waiting for the darn thing to defrag. I use it so seldom that I figured to do the maintenance on it before I try to fix this thumbdrive. Just for my personal information... If I am able to erase and reformat this drive, how should a thumb drive be formatted for use exclusively on a mac running OSX ? The disc utility offers a variety of choices (journalized, standard, etc). Thanks for everyone's input so far ! grim

I double checked the formatting on my personal thumb drives and the mac info window listed them as FAT16 formats, so that is what I reformatted my buddies' thumb drive to be. If anyone one could advise a better file format for this thumb drive then let me know before monday so I can make the adjustments before I give it back to my friend. Thanks all. grim
