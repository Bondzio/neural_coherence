hello, i have a node with one physical wireless interface and i need it to offer ap service to other nodes, connect to an existed ap, and connect to other nodes in ad hoc mode.
if i create 3 logical wireless interfaces of that interface and configure each one respectively to the modes above, would this work?
do they use the same mac address or each needs to be configured a different one?
and what is the disadvantages of this approach?
thanks!
