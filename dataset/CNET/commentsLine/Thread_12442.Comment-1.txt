the cd rom drive in our dell cpu doesn't seem to want to read disks.
the operating system is windows xp, and at one time the rom drive worked correctly.
it opens and closes, but the green light never comes on like it use to when it was reading a disk.
we have tried uninstalling the driver, and then reinstalling to no avail.
on the device manager tab is shows a yellow exclamation point over the drive.
where should we go from here?
thank you!
