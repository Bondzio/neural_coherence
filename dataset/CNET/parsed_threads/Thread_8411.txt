<s> I need help setting up my new business please? </s>
<s> What kind of internal networking configuration and appropriate hardware/devices would I need for my business? </s>
<s> My business includes: 54 employees- 37 have desk jobs (meaning there are at least some andministrative responsibilities, though this number also includes the salespeople and customer service representatives) -17 work exclusively on the manufacturing floor. </s>
<s> I'll need a preliminary sketch of the physical layout of the network which I don't expect you to do. </s>
<s> But I do however need to know how my company will be connected to the outside networks, in particular the Internet. </s>
<s> That there is nothing new to doing this. </s>
<s> You get your internet to some internet sharing box. </s>
<s> While you could start with a router I suggest something better like SONICWALL or UNTANGLE. </s>
<s> With the internet done you put your next effort into your &quot;cable plant.&quot; This one can be easy with a pair of 24 to 48 port switched hubs. </s>
<s> These are cheap and then you run your cables. </s>
<s> As to wifi, you can try off the shelf routers configured as WAPs if your IT is savvy but keep the security sky high such as WPA2 and nothing less. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The internet is actaully the easy part. </s>
<s> You just need to buy a large enough connection based on how much internet surfing you anticipate. </s>
<s> I would avoid running any type of servers that external customers would access. </s>
<s> At your stage you are better off purchasing this service from a colo company. </s>
<s> The building will dictate your lan design. </s>
<s> You need a place you can place your equipment that is secure and that you can run lots of cable to. </s>
<s> The optimuum place would be a central location that was within 300 feet of all desks. </s>
<s> If you can do this then a couple of 48 port switches and a router will be all you need. </s>
<s> If you cannot meet this restriction then you need to install multiple rooms and connect them together. </s>
<s> These rooms must be within 300 feet or you will need to use fiber. </s>
<s> Note the 300 foot distance needs to include all the distance to go up into the ceiling and back down, it adds up fast. </s>
<s> If you plan to use wireless it get somewhat more complex. </s>
<s> You are going to need multiple wireless units. </s>
<s> This is also very building specific but you should also design so that no wireless unit has more than say 10 active users on it... some recommend 7 users. </s>
<s> Your network design may also be impacted by the phone solution you choose. </s>
<s> Almost all new phone systems run over your data network. </s>
<s> It does increase your network costs up front but it saves costs on the back. </s>
<s> Like the data network a phone network will depend on your business. </s>
