having problems establishing wpa encryption on wireless network.
router is netgear wpn824.
desktop running xp media w/sp2 is hardwired and encryption seems to have taken using netgear wizard.
desktop running xp home w/ sp2 is wireless using netgear wpn111 usb connection.
problem: using netgear wizard i tried to enable wpa encryption with code (same as one used on wired desktop).
wireless computer is active on the network when i start but when i apply the wpa encryption the wizard goes red and the network drops out.
seems to be searching for a connection.
i tried applying the encryption with the windows firewall disabled but it does not take.
(note: i also tried to set up wep but same problem) other info: wireless system uses nsw 2005 antivirus along with aluria adware software.
any thoughts on what's going on here and how to correct this?
i talked with netgear and they said drop all firewalls and uninstall the software if necessary.
call back if any problems.
(once i get the issue fixed i'll be ready to review netgear products for all to see)
