One day all of a sudden it got a weird problem. The headset connects to system and when i play any audio i just get a hissing sound in the headset. Also the sound doesn't play in the laptop speaker. I can change the track or pause n resume the playback using the headset's AVRCP features. 1. There is no problem in the headset because the same headset is working normally with my cell phone. 2. I updated bluetooth driver on laptop still problem persists. 3. I'm able to use bluetooth for file transfer on my cell etc. System info: Lenovo R61. Model no: 8919 A44 OS : Windows XP I had some hardware issues with my laptop. My System Fan had conked off and probably because of that my Motherboard also got damaged. I've got the motherboard and Fan replaced recently. Please let me know what can be the issue or if any more information is required.

I was surprised at Windows 7 arriving without A2DP support here. You can google up how others dealt with this but it's not native and A2DP is double trouble. I'd drop it. Bob
