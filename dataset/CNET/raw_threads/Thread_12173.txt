When you have a single person doing both functions it is very blurry which function falls under which title. When you have large complex project different people do different parts of the work so it is a little more clearly defined. When you deal with a huge company say ATT you get whole organizations with those titles so they break this up even more. So your definitions are correct for larger projects/companies.
