<s> Had my custom machine since Summer 2003. </s>
<s> I'm thinking about keeping some parts while upgrading other core parts. </s>
<s> Here's a breakdown. </s>
<s> Keeping: Maxtor 120 Gb HDD Samsung 1 Tb HDD WD 500 Gb External HD 4x 512 Mb RAM Sticks (Might upgrade to 4x 1 Gb Ram Sticks) nVidia 6800 GT 256 Mb SoundBlaster Audigy 2 Gamer Case (its light aluminum, with swinging side doors for easy access) Need: New Motherboard New Processor (Thinking Pentium Quadcore) Gonna buy a Blu-ray Drive and DVD-RW Drive I never attempted anything like this, what are the potential problems I will run into? </s>
<s> Software, installation etc. </s>
<s> Also, I'm not that familiar with mobos, whats a good high end product? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Upgrade the power supply, and count on the old OS install to go down in flames. </s>
<s> Your disaster plan will come in handy. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> if ddr, ebay it. </s>
<s> ditto with the 6800gt since a new $80 video card will be faster and you probably won't be able to play retail blu-ray discs with the 6800 gt (since it has no hd acceleration nor hdcp). </s>
<s> if you have a retail version of xp, you'll be able to re-use it. </s>
<s> otherwise, bank on getting a new OS (vista). </s>
<s> look into intel p45 based mobos. </s>
<s> here's a bunch: http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2010200280+107172615+1071740132&Configurator=&Subcategory=280&description=&Ntk=&SpeTabStoreType=&Order=BESTMATCH&srchInDesc= don't be fooled into thinking that higher cost = higher performance. </s>
<s> mobos using the same chipset all perform with 2-3% of each other. </s>
<s> if you don't plan on overclocking, just go by best price with the features you want. </s>
<s> (no need to pay extra for things you won't use like dual gigabit lan ports.) </s>
