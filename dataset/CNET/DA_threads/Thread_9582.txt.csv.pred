1.1.1	I have a 566MHz processor.	St
1.1.2	Ive tried to burn a dvd but holly it takes a like 18hours.	St
1.1.3	and thats just a 1 GIG of video.	St
1.1.4	Im guessing not even if i upgrade it wont make a difference.	St
1.1.5	So my question is which comp or kind of computer can help to burn this kind of video.	St
1.2.1	The actual recording time should be about the same with your CPU and some 2+ GHz CPU.	St
1.2.2	What will change is the ENCODING time.	St
1.2.3	It's very linear to CPU power.	St
1.2.4	If you had a twice as fast CPU, it would take 1/2 as long.	St
1.2.5	Any under 1,000 buck desktop will do this much faster but none (at that price) will break it down in less than say, one hour.	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Yes!!!	St
1.3.2	For example when I first got into video edditing and I would render a 10min video on my 500mhz PC, it would take 40min to complete!!!!	St
1.3.3	Now the same video will render on my 3200+ AMD64 in about 6 min.	St
1.3.4	John	St
