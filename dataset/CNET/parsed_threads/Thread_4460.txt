<s> I have a Kodak EasyShare P720 picture frame. </s>
<s> I have a 2 gigabyte flash drive on which I have put approx 170 pictures - jpg When I try to move certain pics to the flash drive on my computer (pc), there is an error 0X80070052. </s>
<s> Unable to create file or directory. </s>
<s> This doesn't make sense. </s>
<s> They are relatively small files - same as the others. </s>
<s> When I check the Properties of the files on my computer which I want to transfer to the flash drive, it's 110 megabytes - well below the capacity of the flash drive. </s>
<s> There are some other concerns about the picture frame itself, like it says the about 20 files are &quot;bad&quot;. </s>
<s> I deleted all files on the flash drive and then uploaded them 12 at a time - again. </s>
<s> Some other issues specific to the frame I will deal with later. </s>
<s> Any clues about this? </s>
<s> The top directory can only hold so many files in spite of a gigabyte free. </s>
<s> So no matter how big the card is, you'll see this again and again. </s>
<s> Fix? </s>
<s> Make a folder and put pictures in a folder. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob, So does the frame open the folders and go through each one? </s>
<s> How does that work? </s>
<s> I wonder why there's no mention of that anywhere - that I've found so far anyway. </s>
<s> How can one tell the size limit of a folder? </s>
<s> Please try this and see what happens. </s>
<s> Yes it's mentioned on the web. </s>
<s> I'll give you the google so you can research this if you wish. </s>
