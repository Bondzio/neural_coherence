Well I want to upgrade my RAM on my HP m8000n to 4gb.
But heres, the problem, I have no clue what kind of RAm my computer has and I dont know if i should replace the current 2gb of RAM with better ram, add the same RAM, or add better ram and use it with the current ram that I have.
I really need help with this.
Thanks.
