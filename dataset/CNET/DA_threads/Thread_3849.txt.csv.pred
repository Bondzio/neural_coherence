1.1.1	I dragged My Documents folder ( about 1 GB ) and My Music folder ( about 10 GB ) into my external hard drive today ( I do n't think the brand or type is important ? )	Ques
1.1.2	and did n't remember to safely remove the external hard drive from the USB port .	St
1.1.3	My first question is , is it really important to safely remove things from USB ports ?	Ques
1.1.4	Next , I tried plugging in the external hard drive into another computer 's USB port , and was able to open up My Documents folder , but the My Music folder would n't open .	St
1.1.5	Instead , the computer froze and I had to Ctrl Alt Del to close the folder .	St
1.1.6	When I finally opened the My Music folder , after waiting a long time , only 169 MB of music showed up , and I noticed that all of these song titles begin with numbers , meaning they are the first songs alphabetically in the list .	St
1.1.7	It seems that the other 9.8 GB of stuff disappeared .	St
1.1.8	However , when viewing the My Computer screen of the G : drive ( which is the drive on the external hard drive that I saved both of these folders ) , one can see that the the G : drive , with My Music plus My Documents subfolders contains 13 GB of information ( 3 from My Documents ) , so there is supposedly still 10 GB of SOMETHING in the external hard drive unaccounted for , even though only 169 MB of stuff show up when I open the My Music folder .	St
1.1.9	Am I making any sense ?	Ques
1.1.10	If I have n't thoroughly confused you guys by now , does anyone have any suggestions in regards to what the problem might be ?	Ques
1.1.11	THe missing 9.8 GB of stuff is the rest of my music , I know it , but it simply wo n't show up .	St
1.1.12	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	you would be ok simply turning off and then disconnecting the external drive .	St
1.2.2	But it is that 10 % of time that really hurts .	St
1.2.3	It is important to use the Safely Remove Hardware icon in the System Tray before turning off/disconnecting any USB device .	St
1.2.4	The Operating System regularly checks all hardware devices , whether internal or external , and using the Safely Remove Hardware tells the OS to close down its actions on that device .	St
1.2.5	I have an external USB hard drive , and when I drag and drop files and folders to it using Windows Explorer , ( or My Computer ) , the files/folders are & quot ; copied & quot ; , not removed from the original location .	St
1.2.6	So , is it possible you still have the originals on your PC 's internal hard drive ?	Ques
1.2.7	If so , I would play safe , try and delete all those folders on the external , and then re-try it .	Sug
1.2.8	Do n't forget to use the Safely Remove Hardware utility .	St
1.2.9	If that does n't work you may have to reformat the external drive according to the manufacturer 's instructions .	St
1.2.10	Good luck .	Polite

1.3.1	I 'm seeing entire drive contents vanish .	St
1.3.2	( Not mine , just people bring me these things . )	St
1.3.3	Always properly eject .	St
1.3.4	Please .	St
1.3.5	Next look into some sync program like SYNCBACK .	St
1.3.6	In closing since the filesystems may differ , byte counts can differ .	St

1.4.1	Hi Mark , Unfortunately , and for some very odd reason , my folders were not copied .	St
1.4.2	Usually , when I drag files , they are copied as well , so that was out-of-the-ordinary .	St
1.4.3	I wonder if I should have mentioned that in advance .	St
1.4.4	Thanks for the response .	St
1.4.5	I 'm still keeping my fingers crossed ...	St
1.5.1	I 'm sorry Bob , but I 'm very unfamiliar with computer lingo ( I think that is really obvious ) .	St
1.5.2	Can you please clarify a bit about what you wrote in your post ?	Ques
1.5.3	THanks so much !	St
1.6.1	& quot ; I 'm seeing entire drive contents vanish .	St
1.6.2	( Not mine , just people bring me these things .	St
1.6.3	) & quot ; All the drive files vanish .	St
1.6.4	& quot ; Always properly eject .	St
1.6.5	Please. & quot ; Please shutdown properly .	St
1.6.6	& quot ; Next look into some sync program like SYNCBACK. & quot ; If you are using a drag and drop method like Explorer , look up SYNCBACK on google.com It may help you get what you wanted done .	St
1.6.7	& quot ; In closing since the filesystems may differ , byte counts can differ. & quot ; Here 's a Wikipedia on filesystems since it 's too big for me to put here and I ca n't condense it to one line .	St
