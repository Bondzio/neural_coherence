I am getting conflicting advice on how exactly to connect it. The HP does not have an esata port, but all I think I need is to buy an esata plate for the back and connect it internally to one of the spare ports. If I do that, what kind of esata cable do I need to buy? A regular esata cable, or an esata-to-esata cable? I want to buy all the right parts at the same time. Thanks! Jim

There should be one metal slot cover you can remove and install the bracket. Hopefully your external drive has an eSATA port...if so, get an eSATA-to-eSATA cable and you're good to go. If your external has a SATA port (L-shaped instead of I-shaped), get an eSATA-to-SATA cable. If the PC has no unused SATA ports, you should be able to still buy and install a PCI-E SATA card with an external eSATA port. In this case you'll need to install the driver for the card. Google the terms I used above if you are wondering what they look like.

If your external drive has the eSATA connection then you want the plate to have the eSATA connection as well. Normally the drive should come with the cable as well (in this case, it would be a black shielded cable). The internal sata cable will most likely to red.

FYI: I bought the bracket/plate (whatever it is supposed to be called), and I plugged the red cable it had internally to an empty sata port. When I connected my external hard drive to the plate with an esata-to-esata cable, my computer detected it right away! I was really expecting that I would have to buy an esata pci card, rather than just the bracket, but I didn't, WOOHOO! The only downer was I was dismayed to see that it came preformatted as FAT32. I reformatted it to NTFS, but it is a 1TB drive and it took FOREVER, like more than an hour, at least - I don't know exactly how long - instead of watching the progress bar painfully crawl along I went out and had some fun and came back hours later and all was well .
