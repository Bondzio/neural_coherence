<s> i recently had to send my laptop into dell for repairs. </s>
<s> well, dell decided that my laptop was damaged beyond repair and sent me a completely different one, along with the harddrive from my old laptop. </s>
<s> i've tried putting the old harddrive into the new laptop, but i just keep getting error messages. </s>
<s> can anyone tell me if it is possible to retrieve my files from the old harddrive and if so how. </s>
<s> also, please don't refer me to dell. </s>
<s> they have already made it clear that it's my problem , not theirs. </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> Get an external USB-2 case for the hard drive. </s>

<s> Google for this product(adapter) called ADA-2020. </s>
<s> Found at http://www.geeks.com and others. </s>
<s> Used for USB 2.0 to SATA/IDE connections. </s>
<s> This adapter will allow you to access the old laptop drive and many others should the need arise. </s>
<s> Pricing is decent and is far more flexible than a simple USB case, though that will work. </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Seems pretty nice to me -- obviously you've had some grief along the way, but I'd definitely agree, if Dell gave you a new laptop, they've delivered completely on any concept of warranty. </s>
<s> I think the suggestions above are good, but... </s>
<s> If the reason the laptop went for repairs was a faulty hard drive, you may need more heroic measures for data recovery (which are never described as inexpensive). </s>
<s> I'm inferring there's useful data that aren't backed up? </s>
<s> If it's just your applications and configuration you want restored, you'll be quicker and better to start from scratch. </s>
<s> As outlined in the thread above I have hung the old hard drive in an enclosure on a USB port and can see the folders just fine, but when I try to open the folders I need (my documents, application data) it gives me a permissions error. </s>
<s> How do I get past it? </s>
<s> I have the username and password the files were created under, but don't know where to enter them. </s>
