I'm going with no.
That's just one link in the quality chain.
Your choice on the encoding but given the usual headphones and speakers I can't tell the difference from lossless to hi-rate MP3.
Maybe you don't have to do much other than re-test your encoding method?
The only assurance of such quality is when you think it's quality meets your standard.
HDMI by itself is not enough.
