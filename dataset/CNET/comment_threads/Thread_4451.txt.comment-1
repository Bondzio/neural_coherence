Okay, I've had it with my Epson C80 and I'm looking for a new printer starting from scratch.
The Epson self destructed because I didn't use it enough and it's design is as bad as its inks are good.
Clearly, print quality alone, Epson would be it IMHO.
However, I'm now taking two other points into consideration: ink economy and maintenance.
I want a printer that doesn't jam easily and I'm looking at the Canon PIXMA iP4000.
Of course I'm also open to anything else that gets a strong thumbs up, so recommendations would be appreciated.
