<s> I've bought an LG DP1W with wifi recently. </s>
<s> I tried to connect my LaCie 1TB harddrive to it, but it wouldn't recognise it. </s>
<s> The harddrive is in NTFS file system. </s>
<s> My friend has a WD harddrive connected to a WD multimedia player, and it works perfectly. </s>
<s> His harddrive has an NTFS file system as well, so this is why I get confused. </s>
<s> Is it because his mm player and hd have the same manufacturer? </s>
<s> I know that you're going to tell me to format it to FAT32, but I know that the max file size there is 4GB, and this is not a solution for me, because I bought it to watch hi-def films with it. </s>
<s> The situation is not really clear. </s>
<s> - Is it relevant your LG has Wifi? </s>
<s> - How do you connect the drive? </s>
<s> - Does the manual of the LG say they support an NTFS disk? </s>
<s> And to experiment: - Does your friends player recognise your drive? </s>
<s> - Does your LG recognize your friends drive? </s>

<s> Thanks for replying. </s>
<s> I guess wifi isn't relevant, sorry. </s>
<s> I connect my drive to the mm player via usb. </s>
<s> I think I threw the manunal out. </s>
<s> I thought about experimenting and testing that out once I get back, I'm currently not home. </s>
<s> I'll have to wait till sunday evening. </s>
<s> I'll post the results then! </s>
<s> And thanks again! </s>
<s> I've exactly the same problem. </s>
<s> Probably it's a combination between the manufacturer of the device and the external HDD. </s>
<s> Tried to contact LG, but haven't got a response yet. </s>
<s> Keep me posted about your progress.. </s>
