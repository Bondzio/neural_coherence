So I decided to test the speed. Not scientifically by any fashion, but the results were interesting. I just used the sweep second hand on my wrist watch. My machine specs: Home built with Shuttle main board with 6 USB-2 ports, AMD 2400+ XP processor, 512 Meg RAM. Optical drive: Sony 52/32/52 CD burner. Drive case: BYTECC USB-2. Procedure: Copy a large file from the USB drive to a folder on my HD. I used the supplied USB-2 cable that came with the case and a several year old USB-1 cable from an older USB Zip-100 drive. File copied: IE6 full, 48 Meg in size from a CD-RW disk that I had burned a while back. Results: USB-1 cable took 25 seconds. USB-2 cable took 19 seconds. So there you are folks.

The USB2 cables are shielded better, and thus can be spec'ed for higher signal speed than the older USB1 cables. However, depending upon the environment (how &quot;RF noisy&quot;) and cable length, a very short run of USB1 cable should be able to handle the higher speed of USB2. USB1 (actually USB1.1) or otherwise called &quot;USB Full-Speed&quot; interface is supposed to go 12 Mbps (Mega bits per second) and USB2, or otherwise called &quot;USB Hi-Speed&quot;, is supposed to go 480 Mbps. 12 Mbps is approximately 1.5 MBps (Mega Bytes per second) and 480 Mbps is approximately 60 MBps. But that does not provide for any protocol overhead, and other loss. So far, neither interface is yet living up to the hype. I think, on a good day, USB1 interface is typically getting about half of its promise, around 0.8 MBps, and USB2 is typically getting much less than a third of its promise, at about 8 to 20 MBps.
