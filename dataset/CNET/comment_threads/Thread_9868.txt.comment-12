Hi, They were all jumpered and booted and cabled etc correctly.
The only thing is when i tried to boot from my master drive a windows32 seup file was missing so I had to change my bios to boot from my win xp pro cd.
Windows has now almost finished installing itself, and I expect it means i will have lost everything on the master drive - but im hoping that everything on the slave is intact as this was my main storage drive.
Fingers crossed.
(But then i suppose even if i did loose it all that would serve me right for not backing up for about a year!
lol) Thanks so much for your help, I really appreciate it - i would have been trying to figure this out for days, even weeks if you hadnt been here!!
Take care & thanks again Cat
