4Gb is the max.
amount it will report, HOWEVER!!!
it may not actually use this amount but probable 3.5gb.
You can install 4gb of ram in the ram slots, but as i stated only a certain amt.
will actually be used.
If your system is capable install win7 64bit as better solution.
Also, your system may need a bios update to handle such ram if not already installed.
