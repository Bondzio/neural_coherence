Disable the onboard and replace it with a $2.95 in your mailbox thing like http://www.amazon.com/External-Sound-Adapter-Desktop-Notebook/dp/B000BUDHNQ and move on. 3. Replace the motherboard. 4. Try drivers (sorry but the number of times that works is low so it's in last place.) Good luck. Bob PS. About item 4. It rises to first place if you EVER accepted a driver for motherboard or audio from Microsoft!
