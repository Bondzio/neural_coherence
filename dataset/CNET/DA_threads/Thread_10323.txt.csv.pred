1.1.1	So here 's the deal .	St
1.1.2	I had a Belkin N F5D8236-4 router .	St
1.1.3	I have 2 laptops and a desktop ( plus a DVR , Wii and XBOX that are currently of no concern ) .	St
1.1.4	I switched to a Linksys WRT160N v3 and the desktop adapter in my comp .	St
1.1.5	I guess I should start with specs : Laptop 1 : Mini-PCIe G adapter ( what came in it , not worried about it ) Laptop 2 : Mini-PCIe Atheros AR5008X chipset with 8.xx drivers loaded ( latest ) Internal card btw Desktop : Had a Linksys WMP110 , now a Linksys WMP600N , both RaLink chipsets , latest drivers installed When I had my Belkin , my Desktop got 135mbps link ( about 30 feet and 3 walls in the way ) on the WMP110 .	St
1.1.6	I figured that was good enough , since it 's a single band adapter anyway , never expected to get 300 out of it .	St
1.1.7	My Laptop # 2 was getting a 300mbps link .	St
1.1.8	I was getting intermittent drops of the wifi link on the router ( wireless just turned off for whatever reason ) and throughput from laptop to desktop was about 300-400KB/s if I was LUCKY .	St
1.1.9	So I decided to get something more stable ( with the option to do dd-wrt ) and got the WRT160N .	St
1.1.10	I figured it was a good time to update the desktop adapter to a 300mbps card and that prompted the WMP600N ( dual band capable card ) to be bought .	St
1.1.11	NOW , my desktop connects at 130mbps and the laptop at 130mbps .	St
1.1.12	WTF ?	Ques
1.1.13	So I start playing around with settings , and have WPA-AES , using mixed mode b/g/n .	St
1.1.14	I have to use either 20mhz or 20/40mhz mixed ( my only 2 choices ) , neither of which makes a difference .	St
1.1.15	Under one of the settings , it has the speed set to auto , but the max it shows it connections available to 130mbps .	St
1.1.16	SOOO , anyone who knows , how can I get something out of it , like the 300mbps it says on the front of the box ?	Ques
1.1.17	It is a single band 2.4Ghz radio .	St
1.1.18	I 'm currently getting throughput of 3MB/s consistently transferring files from laptop to desktop , does that sound about right ?	Ques
1.1.19	I 'm thinking even at 130mbps I should be getting 10MB/s or so .	St
1.1.20	I 'm getting to the point of frustration , cause I do n't understand why I ca n't get a good and fast connection at the same time .	St
1.1.21	Maybe someone has some light to put on thie subject .	St
1.1.22	I 'm sure I left out vital info about my setup , so do n't going throwing around the hate , just let me know what you need and I 'll give you all the info you could want for help .	St
1.1.23	I have n't tried putting my WMP110 back in yet , but plan on it tomorrow , cause it will save me $ 80 to dump the WMP600N ( and the Netgear 300T is $ 50 , rated at 300 so I might just exchange for that if I can get the 130/300 problem figured ) .	St
1.1.24	I will take screen shots of my config , whatever you guys need ...	St
1.1.25	Thanks for reading this whole thing , and for your help in advance ...	St
1.2.1	The lesson is simple .	St
1.2.2	Keep what you can wired .	St
1.2.3	Wifi is shared space do with one machine you get all that it can be .	St
1.2.4	Add one machine and it can drop to less than half and even more as the other machine now chatters to stay connected .	St
1.2.5	It all goes downhill from there .	St
1.2.6	Mixing in that 802.11g brings it all down to 802.11g speeds in all the tests I 've done .	St
1.2.7	So we have post 18 or about that in the forum sticky about using a wifi router as a WAP to give the airspace more capacity .	St
1.2.8	That 's what I would do .	St
1.2.9	& quot ; how can I get something out of it , like the 300mbps it says on the front of the box ? & quot ; That 's under ideal conditions and in some lab .	St
1.2.10	If you get close to half that your setup is fine .	St
1.2.11	Bob	St
1.3.1	If you do n't have the answer , do n't bother posting .	St
1.3.2	Obviously you have no idea Bob .	St
1.3.3	First of all , I was getting 300mbps LAST WEEK with a different router , so I know in my super secret lab I call home , that it is possible .	St
1.3.4	Second , I 've done some more looking and found out important things like needing to keep WMM on , and using WPA2 security to even think about getting N speeds .	St
1.3.5	It 's obvious you are clueless , please ignore all my posts from now til eternity , and leave the replies to people on this forum who know what they are talking about .	St
1.3.6	& quot ; The lesson is simple .	St
1.3.7	Keep what you can wired & quot ; .	St
1.3.8	You 're a joke dude .	St
1.4.1	These forums do n't tolerate such replies .	St
1.4.2	Locked .	St
