<s> Hey guys, I was wondering if I could prepare and know which graphics card I should upgrade to. </s>
<s> I don't really mind which brand though I would think to stick with ATI. </s>
<s> Also please find graphics cards that are under the range of about $350. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Specs Graphics Card (Not really needed) : ATI Radeon HD 5700 Series Chip Type : AMD Radeon Graphics Processor Processor : Intel Core i7-2600 CPU 3.40GHz Ram : 8.2gb </s>
<s> Anyways, here is my computer with full specs. </s>

<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html After you pick the card, see if your case is normal sized and then check your power supply. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> How would I find out if my case was normal sized and my power supply? </s>
<s> would I need to open my computer for the power supply? </s>
<s> Also that link I gave with the full thing to my computer says &quot;Chassis Type : Microtower&quot; so would that be considered normal size? </s>
<s> Since I can't chance it, I always look. </s>
<s> Since we're inside the case every 6 months to keep it clean, it's just another thing to read while we're inside. </s>
<s> As to the case size, it wasn't clear to me so you can take measurements to see if a full size card fits and if there is a heat issue you can always cut a big hole in the case or leave a cover off. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> A few questions, would a brand new power supply be needed? </s>
<s> And im guessing this card can fit into my case and work with my computer. </s>
<s> I was thinking of getting this card http://www.newegg.com/Product/Produc...82E16814130841 </s>
<s> Heres a working link from above ^^^^ http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130841 GeForce GTX 650 Ti </s>
<s> Here's how I figure that out. </s>
<s> I get the Watts off the old supply and if it's the usual under 500 we take that number then add double the Watts the new card will draw. </s>
<s> Reviews seem to write about 112 Watts so we double that and add that to your current PSU. </s>
<s> Now find a PSU with a Single 12V rail unless you are adept at figuring out Amperes. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm not great with computers and don't really understand what your saying. </s>
<s> But maybe I could give you some of the info you need and you can help me? </s>
<s> I asked on another forum about a power supply and someone linked me this http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817341017 </s>
<s> +12V1@25A, +12V2@25A however shows it's a dual rail supply. </s>
<s> You've told me enough that you want a single rail to avoid all those other questions. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I found some more info about my graphics card it is the HD 5770 and requires 450 watts to run, I have 460 watts in my computer and the GTX 660 (the one I want) takes the same amount as HD 5770. </s>
<s> You're also falling into the trap of the just big enough PSU. </s>
<s> So we have a few issues to cover. </s>
<s> Are you going to exceed any PSU RAIL? </s>
<s> (that's in Amperes, not Watts most of the time) How old is the PSU. </s>
<s> I ding the spec by 25% per year of age for the first 2 years. </s>
