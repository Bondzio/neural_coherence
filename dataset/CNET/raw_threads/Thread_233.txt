I took out the 512 MB kingston to make room for one of the new gigs, now if i do the math right...i have in my 4 slots 3 gig sticks plus the 512mb buffalo stick...so i know i should at least have 3.5gigs of ram..but on my computer it shows that i only have 2.75 gb of ram...but i checked my bios and it says i have at least 3000MBs of ram installed....here are my specs: intel core 2 duo processor E6600 2.4 ghz 1066FSB 2X2MB L2 cache EM64T asus P5N32-E nFORCE 680i SLI chipset LGA775 CPU FSB1333 DDR2 dual channel memory architecture, 4XDIMM, max 8GB DDR2-800/667.533, non-ecc, unbuffered memory. 8Mb Award BIOS, PnP, DMI2.0, WfM2.0, SM BIOS 2.3, Multi-Language BIOS 2 identical nvidia 7600GS 512MB 320GB SATA-II 3.0Bb/s 16MB cace 7200 RPM HDD LiteOn SHM-165H65 16X Double layer DVD+-RW super allwrite+lightscribe technology XFI Xtremegamer 24-BIT PCI sound card Windows XP SP2 (VISTA-ready) Apevia 600W DARKSIDE POWER ATX power supply ALSO, I've &quot;t'weaked&quot; out my core 2 duo so it now reaches 3.4 GHZ...now for the most part it runs smooth 95% of the time..once in awhile it says some dumb GHZ number I.E. 2.14..and wont start up and i have to restart it again...

The system is probably adjusting the 1GB and 512MBs mismatch by using the 1GB as 512MBs. So the 2@1GB plus 2@512MBs is 3GBs. Let us know what you find in the MB manual. VAPCMD PS...If the system isn't stable 100%, you need to throttle back a little. Otherwise you'll be writing to us sooner than later about the parts that no longer work.

Here's some info on Win XP and RAM limitations http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=windows+xp+and+4GB+RAM&btnG=Google+Search

Then add the /PAE switch. Reboot your computer. XP will now see all 4 GB of RAM. i have no idea how to get to the boot.ini file...can anyone tell me by a step-by-step process to do what this guy is saying...thanks! and yes my MB can support 8MBs
