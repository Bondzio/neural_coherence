on any laptop to disable it's wifi.
my hp, acer's have a little button for that.
now i use ethernet to the bridge and follow the directions.
i'm not privy to what you may have changed on the bridge so let me note that i use the bridge's defaults and only set the ssid and password word to the wifi network i want to connect to.
remember not to lock down any ip here.
we want to get it to work as a bridge first.
good luck.
