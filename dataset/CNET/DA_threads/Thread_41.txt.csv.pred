1.1.1	I am replacing the power source on an HP computer .	St
1.1.2	Had to order the replacement and it has a 4-pin video connector and the computer has a 3-pin connection .	St
1.1.3	Can I buy an adapter to convert the connector to a 3-pin or do I need to return the power source .	St
1.1.4	The power source is smaller in size than usual ( thanks HP ) and finding a replacement has not been easy .	St
1.1.5	Thanks for any info you may have .	St

1.3.1	The computer is an HP Pavilion 8533Z The original power source is a Delta Electronics Model DPS 160GB A Rev 00 HP P/N 0950-3623 The P9 ( video ? )	Ques
1.3.2	connector is a 3-pin Connector one green , 2 black wires The replacement is a Micro ATX 200W P4-12V Model MPS3ATX20 The connector is a 4-pin connector- 2 yellow and 2 black wires .	St

1.4.1	& quot ; Only choose the 4 pin unit if you have the 4 pin plug connected to something in your PC , otherwise you do not need it. & quot ; There may be extra connections that are never used .	St
1.4.2	You did n't reveal if the 3 pin is used on the old setup .	St
1.4.3	Sadly , I have n't found the service manual for that model , but did find the note and clue above .	St

1.5.1	what makes yourPower Supply an ATX 12 V. The 4 pin is the 12 volt power plug that many mobos use to power the CPU now .	St
1.5.2	[ older mobos used the 5 volts or 3.3 volt connector ] It 's a mobo issue not a CPU issue .	St
1.5.3	A given CPU can be fed from the 4 pin 12 volt on a newer mobo and work without such a connector on a mobo not set up for that connector .	St
1.5.4	Had you plugged that in to the viseo card you would have fried video card for dinner .	St
1.5.5	Yellow wires are normally 12 volts [ of course black wires are grounds / returns ] .	St
1.5.6	I might guess that the Greeen is for 3.3 volts , HOWEVER 3.3 volts is normally Orange .	St
1.5.7	The only green wire in the standard is the PS-ON lead on pin 14 of the 20 pin connector or pin 16 of the 24 pin connector .	St
1.5.8	Check with HP before plugging anything in .	St
