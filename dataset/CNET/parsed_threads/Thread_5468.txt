<s> Hi, I have been wanting to copy computer audio to a wav or mp3 file on my Dell 866 MHz computer. </s>
<s> My system is running a Creative SoundBlaster Live! </s>
<s> Value card that shipped with the system in July 2000. </s>
<s> So I first took a standard audio cable (with two male ends, I guess they might be called). </s>
<s> I put one end in the sound-out/speaker port on the back of the tower and the other in the microphone port. </s>
<s> Then I played the QuickTime file of which I wanted the audio to be copied and pressed record in the Windows 98SE sound recorder. </s>
<s> I had had the volume control was muted as someone was sleeping. </s>
<s> When I unmuted the volume control, no sound workednot even a system beep or alert. </s>
<s> I tried new speakers; still no sound. </s>
<s> Did I fry the sound card? </s>
<s> So I replaced the 2000 Live! </s>
<s> Value with a 1997 SoundBlaster Live! </s>
<s> (no &quot;Value&quot; facet) from my Dell 266 MHz. </s>
<s> Windows of course automatically installed some generic Creative sound drivers, and then system sound workedbeeps, alerts, and even all games I tested. </s>
<s> But the audio of my DVD Player software (CineMaster software that came with my 2000 shipped-with hardware decoder, now made by Ravisant/Cifelli) did not work. </s>
<s> I even tried downloading drivers from www.creative.com but to no avail for my DVD. </s>
<s> Did I really fry my original Live! </s>
<s> Value card by using that cable? </s>
<s> What should I do regarding the DVD software? </s>
<s> (I am first off going to try to reinstall the software itself and also the drivers for the decoder card.) </s>
<s> Thanks for all your help. </s>
<s> It's greatly appreciated. </s>

<s> To give a sound card last rites, I boot up a KNOPPIX CD and test the functions. </s>
<s> As to the DVD, I must write that I can't help you with your DVD Decoder board issues. </s>
<s> That technology was nice, but can strain support and I don't want to deal with them anymore. </s>
<s> We install a new DVD drive (20 bucks in bulk) and then a software player. </s>
<s> Somewhere past 600MHz, DVD playback via all software began ot work. </s>
<s> There are a few that cling to the hardware cards and we let them cling, but find it best to pretend we know nothing about them. </s>
<s> It's not that we don't, it's the hours making it work is costly, then they want you to fix it everytime it breaks again for free. </s>
<s> So the standing order is to &quot;know nothing.&quot; Hope this sheds some light on the issue. </s>

<s> Would you please tell me a little bit about KNOPPIX CD and how I might go about getting a copy so that I can test my presumed &quot;dead&quot; sound card. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Here's a short review (worth reading!) </s>
<s> http://tips.oncomputers.info/archives2004/0401/2004-Jan-11.htm Links to the KNOPPIX website are there, but I must ask since I always want to know. </s>
<s> Why couldn't you find the KNOPPIX web site? </s>
<s> Just wondering, please tell and don't take it as an offence. </s>
