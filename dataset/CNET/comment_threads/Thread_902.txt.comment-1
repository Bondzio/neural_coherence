Hello - I just bought a new Thermaltake &quot;Max 4 - esata & usb combo&quot; along with a WD Caviar/Green 500GB SATA HD After assembly tried plug/play to a PC with MS/Vista OS; I tried first via USB then eSata -both tries- I do not see the drive in &quot;My Computer&quot;; however I see it under &quot;Device Manager/Disk Drives&quot;.
I thought that perhaps I needed to format the new drive but I do not get such an option by right-or-left clicking on the highlighted drive name.
What am I missing??
I would appreciate any help.
