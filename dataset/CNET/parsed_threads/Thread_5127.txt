<s> I have an HP All-in-one laserjet 3030 which is around one year old. </s>
<s> Lately when using the Automatic Document Feeder (ADF), the pages are coming out with one single thin vertical black line. </s>
<s> If I am using the flatbed, the copy comes up perfectly normal. </s>
<s> Also printed pages are coming up normal. </s>
<s> I have asked Hewlett Packard for an answer but they did not bother to answer. </s>
<s> Any suggestion would be appreciated. </s>

<s> Sadly, support, parts, repair costs can exceed what a new AIO unit will cost. </s>
<s> But it's a well known failure. </s>
<s> What will drive you nuts is that with all these low costs, spare parts are usually non-existent. </s>
