I'm pretty good at using autocad, but not sure about the equipment requirements.
Since autocad is a vector line program... is a more powerful graphics card essential for its smooth running on a mac book booting to windows?
If it was a raster based image I would say you need the beefier video support the MBPro offers, but since it is a vector based image the program displays then is the processor power more important?
I will have to look this up.
Along these lines... has anyone here got an opinion about mac-cad ?
