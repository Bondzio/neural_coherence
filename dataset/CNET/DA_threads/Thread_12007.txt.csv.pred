1.2.1	& quot ; Tip : If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem , please be sure to include all the necessary information ( ie : operating system , model number , hardware , software , etc ) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution. & quot ; Your OS may have a rollback feature , but you neglected this tip so we have to fill in the blank spots first before which method can be used .	St
1.2.2	You may also want to try rebooting the computer and see if it clears up as well as look for any & quot ; Safe Mode & quot ; on the screen .	St

1.3.1	What does ( or did ) the screen look like at various phases during startup ?	Ques
1.3.2	When you first turn it on , there should be some messages during the POST ( Power on Self Test ) process related to hardware configuration .	St
1.3.3	Does this look normal ?	Ques
1.3.4	If not , you may have a hardware defect ( monitor or video display card ) .	St
1.3.5	If this looks ok but the smaller screen only appears when the desktop appears , something may have happened to a setting or maybe a driver did not load properly .	St
1.3.6	You can try doing a right click on an empty area of the desktop and check the desktop properties .	Sug
1.3.7	You should be able to find the screen resolution , # of colors displayed and the refresh rate which is the number of times per second that rescan of the screen is done by the CRT as directed by hardware and software .	St
1.3.8	It would help if you knew what these should be .	St
1.3.9	Another adjustment might be the monitor controls themselves .	St
1.3.10	They can adjust the vertical and horizonal size and position of the desktop screen .	St
1.3.11	These might have been accidently reset .	St
