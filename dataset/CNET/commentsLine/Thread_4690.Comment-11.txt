i have tried the repair feature, but it does not help.
i have also tried adding the laptop to the desktop network by running the wizard again and transfering the the configuration on a flash disk.
still, smith does not show up on the desktop.
it looks like i had better get a hold of my isp.
thanks for trying to help.
