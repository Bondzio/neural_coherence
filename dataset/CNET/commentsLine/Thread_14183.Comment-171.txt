my first contact with a computer was an old compaq lte5300 series laptop.
it was thicker than harry potter and the order of phoenix, the screen was 12&quot; and ran on 16-bit color, it had a 113mhz intel processor, an external cd-rom drive (upgrade) and a very miniscule hard drive that i can't even remember.
it ran windows 95 because windows 98 didn't come out yet then.
