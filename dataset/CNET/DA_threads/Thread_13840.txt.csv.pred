1.1.1	I 'm using a Compaq-Presario SR5130NX desktop computer with Vista Home Premium 32 bit .	St
1.1.2	It came with a TSSTcorp CD/DVDW TS-H653L SCSI CdRom Device ( CD-ROM drive ) .	St
1.1.3	The only problem I have is when I insert a CD with photos on it , and open the folder , the thumbnails appear for a brief instant then turn into the Generic Icon .	St
1.1.4	That is the only problem , everything else runs normally .	St
1.1.5	I have installed every update , all checks of the drive with pc doctor , trouble shooter show & quot ; this device is working properly & quot ; .	St
1.1.6	Thinking perhaps the CD/DVD Rom was defective I installed another device ( Memorex double layer 16x cd internal cd burner ) Vista recognized it and installed it using the same drive as the TSST corp cd Rom .	St
1.1.7	I have the same results , a brief appearance of the thumbnails then the generic icon .	St
1.1.8	When I transfer the folder to my C : drive and open the folder the thumbnails appear normally .	St
1.1.9	I have made sure that the option for & quot ; show icons only & quot ; is unchecked .	St
1.1.10	I have uninstalled and reenstalled the drive to no avail .	St
1.1.11	I 've used system restore but that goes back only 2 days .	St
1.1.12	One other thing , when I use my Photo Suite program and open photos from the CD thumbnails show up as they should .	St
1.1.13	Now I have both cd/dvd devices installed and recognized by vista and the problem exists with both of them and both are using the same drive provided by Microsoft dated 6/21/2006 , version 6.0.6001.18000 .	St
1.1.14	Once again , the problem does not exist in the C : drive.TIA	St
1.2.1	But that 's normal .	St
1.2.2	To figure it out how this works , research THUMBS.DB and do n't put that file on the CD .	St
1.2.3	Let 's be clear there is no hardware issue here .	St
1.2.4	You have a complaint about Windows and what it is doing .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Where do I find this THUMBS.DB ?	Ques
1.3.2	I assumed it was a windows problem .	St
1.3.3	But how do I correct that ?	Ques
1.3.4	I know the cd roms are fine because I installed them in another computer and they worked fine .	St
1.3.5	It 's only in my computer and thats why I thoughts it is a corrupted drive .	St
1.3.6	The computer worked fine for over a year.. Bob	St
1.4.1	Type THUMBS.DB on google.com Remember it does not matter it worked before .	St
1.4.2	Microsoft and who else updates software on your PC and without notice you may find stuff stop working .	St
1.4.3	I do n't duplicate web content about THUMBS.DB but point out that 's where the thumbnails are cached .	St
1.4.4	There is a setting in Explorer to turn that off and maybe , just maybe it will help .	St
1.4.5	To find that setting ( remember you are in a hardware forum ) I 'd google this - & gt ; Windows Explorer Thumbnail Cache Setting There 's another fun issue that happens in Windows where the temporary internet files cache gets so many entries .	St
1.4.6	What some do n't know is the interaction of IE and Explorer .	St
1.4.7	But let 's skip to that cure .	St
1.4.8	Clear the TIF .	St
1.4.9	Bob	St
1.5.1	& quot ; Thinking perhaps the CD/DVD Rom was defective I installed another device & quot ; There is a possible connection with this and that .	St
1.5.2	Let 's think over how the THUMBS.DB , icon caching in Explorer works and files on a CDR or CDRW could work .	St
1.5.3	Let 's say our old CDRW drive supported and we use DRAG AND DROP capability .	St
1.5.4	The THUMBS.DB file could be updated and the view of the CDR/W would behave just like on the hard disk .	St
1.5.5	Change the CDRW drive and we could break the drag and drop or & quot ; cdr/w media behaves like a drive & quot ; and the THUMBS.DB ca n't be written on the fly and you see your issue again .	St
1.5.6	It 's a shame that no one writes a good article about how this all works but nothing in your post would lead me to suspect bad drives .	St
1.5.7	Bob	St
1.6.1	Thanks Bob I 'm starting to learn somthing .	St
1.6.2	Microsoft , bless their evil hearts are trying to send me solutions , but every cure they send me are for the C : drive .	St
1.6.3	I 'm going to check out what you 've sent me and I 'll get back and keep you posted .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	Explorer Thumbnail cache setting - & gt ; http : //win-regedit.blogspot.com/2008/05/disable-thumbnail-caching-explorer.html	St
