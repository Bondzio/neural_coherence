try booting the pc without any video card (new or old).
did you get the same number/sequence of beeps?
if so, the mobo isn't happy with the card.
try clearing the cmos (page 13 of your manual) using the procedure below.
1. turn off the system and unplug the ac power.
2. remove atx power cable from connector pwr2.
3. locate jp14 and short pins 2-3 for a few seconds.
4. return jp14 to its normal setting by shorting pins 1-2.
5. connect atx power cable back to connector pwr2.
now try booting with the new card.
hope this helps.
