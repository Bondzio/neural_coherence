all of the 3.5&quot; hard drives in external enclosures i've seen require more power than the usb ports can provide.
some 2.5&quot; laptop drives in external enclosures can run off the power from one usb channel but for larger drives...probably 80gbs or 100gbs and above require power from 2 usb ports ...they have a &quot;y&quot; cable and can also run off ac adapters too.
hope this helps.
