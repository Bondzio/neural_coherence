1.1.1	hi everybody ! ! ! ! ! ! !	St
1.1.2	i have intel 946gzis original mobo with p4 at 3.4ghz dual core , GMA3000 , dual 512 mb ddr2 ram ( 667mhz ) , and 17 & quot ; lcd moniter .problem is that when i play games like nfs mostwanted , i got good performance at 640*480 resolution but on lcd moniter it doesnt looks good ( means good graphics ) , now when i change resolution t0 1024*768 it looks great on moniter but game speed goes slow.in my opinion it is due to high resolution of lcd because clarity comes on higher resolutions in lcd as compared to crt moniters.can you give me your opinion as well as solution .

1.2.1	Get a real 3D card and ...	St
1.3.1	Your memory and graphics card are the issue here .	St
1.3.2	The GMA3000 is an integrated card I think and so at higher resolutions it needs more memory which is n't available .	St
1.3.3	One solution to try first is to increase the memory to a gigabyte of RAM and see how well that solves some things .	Sug
1.3.4	The better one is to see if that mobo supports a PCI-e card and if so then look at getting something like a 7000 series nVidia GeForce card or you could look at some of the mid to upper ATI cards for another idea .	St

1.4.1	thanks for a good point but i wan na tell u that i have 1 gb ram , and brand new series of gma3ooo having 256 mb video memory.when i benchmarked pc , memory scored 16500 which was the best score i have seen ever.isnt gma3000 is compitable ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.4.2	intel mobo q965 also have same gma3000 graphics and g965 have gmax3000.thats why i m saying that gma3000 is a new series.isn , t it ? ? ? ?	Ques

1.5.1	Though does n't the GMA3000 take from the system so it only have ~750MB of RAM ?	Ques
1.5.2	By using system memory this may not be how 3d games like to work would be another way to put this .	St
1.5.3	Just because it is a new series does n't mean it breaks the benchmarks .	St
1.5.4	If it is intended to be a budget graphics solution which I suspect it is then the answer lies in looking to see if the motherboard has a PCI-e slot or possibly AGP if there is n't a PCI-e slot and look for a good card in that type .	St
1.5.5	Generally cards from nVidia and ATI are used for graphics rather than Intel which is known more for CPUs than anything else .	St

1.6.1	Tips : http : //www.intel.com/support/graphics/gaming/index.htm However , as others have written , I 'd just insert a & quot ; PCI Express X16 & quot ; video card into the slot of the same name ( if your motherboard has one ) .	St
1.6.2	Even the lower-end cards should knock the socks off of integrated graphics .	St
