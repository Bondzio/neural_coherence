For some strange reason I haven't figured out yet why, I can't get past the following, when attempting to load Maxblast3 on a clean (formatted) drive.
&quot;IDE CD-ROM device driver installed&quot; The screen displayes this message then hangs up.
I thought it might be something in the the CMOS setup but I don't see anything there that is out of line - so to speak.
I have a MSI K8N Neo Platinum 3000+ board with an eVGA video card and 512 Kingston stick of memory.
Since this is a &quot;home build&quot; I can't go to the mfg for an answer .
Oh yes, this is an 80Gb Maxtor drive that I want to run Maxblast on.
Would anyone share their knowledge of this type of problem?
Thanks in advance Leland Winters leewintl@cox.net
