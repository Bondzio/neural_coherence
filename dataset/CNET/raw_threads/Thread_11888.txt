While surfing web today using Firefox 2.0, PC all of a sudden started to reboot and hung up at Dell logo screen and won't go any further. Tried rebooted numerous times, no POST beeps that indicate any issues. I can't get to BIOS or boot from diskette or CD. Any ideas? Dell xps Pentium III w/512 ram, single hard drive Thanks

Since there is no display (correct me if wrong) we get to fix the PC or have it fixed. What parts do you have to swap out? Any clues please to help narrow it down. Bob
