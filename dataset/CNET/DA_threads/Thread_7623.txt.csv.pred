1.1.1	First , you must excuse me if my terminology is not accurate .	St
1.1.2	I purchased a house that is wired with 16 ports .	St
1.1.3	I have a cable modem that sends the signal to the switch which then feeds the house and a wireless router ( I believe it is router first and then switch , but not sure ) .	St
1.1.4	I would like to be able to hook up my printer to one of the ports and print remotely ( from laptop , wireless ) or from a desktop computer that is physically connected to one of these ports .	St
1.1.5	I 'm not even sure where to start and I do n't want to have to sift through numerous web pages and terminology I do n't understand .	St
1.1.6	Any assistance is much appreciated .	Polite
1.1.7	Thank you	St
1.2.1	If I had a cable modem to my switch and to the house , then not much would work proper .	St
1.2.2	If I wired my cable modem to the router , then router to switch to the house , then that 's the common working setup .	St
1.2.3	I will not help people with the first setup since that 's their choice and their headache .	St
1.2.4	I hope you understand why .	St
1.2.5	To place the printer on the proper network , you need a PC that shares the printer or one of Dlink/Linksys 's printer sharing boxes .	St
1.2.6	Your choice .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	You may network a printer through a switch .	St
1.3.2	Now , you mentioned your house having 16 ports .	St
1.3.3	I must presume you have something like a patch panel which has cabling from it to various places in the home .	St
1.3.4	Right or wrong ?	Ques
1.3.5	A switch would be placed near the patch panel ... perhaps both in a common rack .	St
1.3.6	The jacks of the switch would be wired to those of the panel .	St
1.3.7	This becomes a common network & quot ; hub & quot ; site .	St
1.3.8	In this same location you might have a cable or DSL modem .	St
1.3.9	It would connect to the switch through a router .	St
1.3.10	The router is the device that connects the & quot ; WAN & quot ; ( wide area network ) to the & quot ; LAN & quot ; ( local area network ) .	St
1.3.11	In this case , the WAN is the Internet and the LAN is your home network .	St
1.3.12	A printer can be connected to the switch and be shared across the entire local area network through it .	St
1.3.13	To do so , you would need a print server ( built in to the printer or external ) that had a jack similar to those used in the switch .	Ques
1.3.14	You can also share the printer ( as Bob mentioned ) by connecting it physically to one PC and allowing another to access it .	St
1.3.15	The advantage is this is simple to set up and configure .	St
1.3.16	The disadvantage is that the PC hosting the printer must also be on to use it remotely .	St
1.3.17	A printer on a print server can be used by any PC on the network without having the computer hosting it to be turned on first .	St
1.3.18	If you tell which you desire to use , that would get a better answer as to how to make it work .	St
