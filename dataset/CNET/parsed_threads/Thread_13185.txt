<s> There are a number of reasonably priced HDTV's out there in the 19-20&quot; range, that allow PC input. </s>
<s> It is not clear to me if I would be able to have both on the screen at the same time. </s>
<s> My PC only has a VGA output, and I would be plugging in an RF input from cable(no box). </s>
<s> I am assuming that the TV will decode digital signals next year, without a box...So, can you watch both at once? </s>
<s> I have yet to see any do PIP from the VGA source. </s>
<s> However you could ask the place that sells these to do this research for you. </s>
