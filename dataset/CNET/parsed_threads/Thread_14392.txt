<s> My computer was running perfectly fine then i booted up a game and i got the blue screen of death. </s>
<s> and the second time it booted up again and after 5 mins i got it again. </s>
<s> Now it wont boot at all. </s>
<s> When i power it up everything turns on but nothing is displayed on the screen no beeps or anything. </s>
<s> I have tested another power supply and video card with no luck. </s>
<s> I did take off the heat sink and noticed that the thermal paste became liquified and leaked onto the processor and inside the other side of the processor which i cleaned off. </s>
<s> But still no luck. </s>
<s> Any Suggestions. </s>
<s> I am pretty tech savvy but this one is confusing me? </s>
<s> These were known to cascade into something of a thermal overrun condition. </s>
<s> Also, I suppose if you're thermal paste was of the metal powder type and this got into the pins and sockets, you could have lost the CPU, MB or both. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
