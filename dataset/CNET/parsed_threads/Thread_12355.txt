<s> Are you an intel or AMD fan? </s>
<s> post the results here! </s>
<s> (if your AMD what do you think about the new Phenom, If intel, about there quad core) (also I anyone has some CPU benchmarks to prove there core better post it here.) </s>
<s> well to get this started I'm an AMD fan. </s>
<s> And I think that phenom will be the best chip out there as soon as all the bugs are worked out. </s>
<s> and the q6600's replacement penryn chip will be about 10% faster at the same speed so phenom will be 15-20% off the pace by march '08. </s>
<s> phenom production can barely hit 2.8ghz, while core2quad was at 3+ ghz in its prior generation. </s>
<s> (even q6600s OC easily to 3.2ghz.) </s>
<s> sorry, but phenom has no chance of being the best high-end processor. </s>
<s> I see some quad core AMDs out. </s>
<s> The price looks fine so they'll sell. </s>
<s> Are you buying? </s>
<s> I'm buying the Phenom yet because I can't afford it yet </s>
<s> Tomshardware says....&quot;Our recommendation hence is simple: Keep your Athlon 64 X2 if you can and wait for the Phenom B3 stepping. </s>
<s> Not only will it fix the TLD bug, but we expect most motherboard manufacturers to be ready with proper Phenom support by then.&quot; No point in buying something's that's not right. </s>
<s> By the time you save your pennies, maybe B3 will be available. </s>

<s> I just found out this, AMD has been making CPUs for the military! </s>
<s> and Lucas Arts used the Quad core to make there movies. </s>
<s> Intel don't be jealous. </s>
<s> Just because they bought a flawed product, doesn't mean you should. </s>
<s> The Phenom has been plagued with problems since it was introduced and by the time they get the B3 stepping out, Intel will have the Penryn core on the street. </s>
<s> Only a fool stands on train track and denies the oncoming train will hit him. </s>
