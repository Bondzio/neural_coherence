1.1.1	Hello , hope someone can help with this My computer ( Asus A7N266 VM motherboard ) has worked for a year or more .	St
1.1.2	I installed some new software and connectd a new device to the serial port ( to update the GPS database of an Origin B2 ) .	St
1.1.3	The computer froze up , and all attempts at restarting freeze at the Windows 2000 logo screen , with the progress bar at zero .	St
1.1.4	I have tried safe mode , last good configuration and booting from floppy disc set ( the 2000 CD appears to be non bootable ) .	St
1.1.5	All freeze at 'starting windows 2000 ' .	St
1.1.6	So I swapped the hard disc for one from an old computer , with windows 98 .	St
1.1.7	This booted up , though there are some compatibility problems with the motherboard .	St
1.1.8	I then attempted to upgrade this old disc from 98 to 2000 .	St
1.1.9	This appeared to be working , until it restarted and froze at the 'setup is starting windows 2000 ' point .	St
1.1.10	This disc now gives the choice of starting either 98 or 2000 , but only 98 actually boots up .	St
1.1.11	So both hard discs stop a exactly the same point .	St
1.1.12	I suspect a component failure on the motherboard , but can not think why this would only affect the 2000 boot up .	St
1.1.13	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.14	Thanks in advance , Richard	St
1.2.1	I found the 2000 CD non bootable as well .	St
1.2.2	Did you ever find an alternative ?	Ques
