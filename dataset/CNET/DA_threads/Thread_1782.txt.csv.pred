1.1.1	Hey everyone , so I 've been looking to purchase a new laptop for a while now , and have decided that a mac would be the best choice .	St
1.1.2	However , I 'm having a problem deciding between the macbook or the macbook pro and what configurations would be best .	St
1.1.3	Aside from writing essays , spreadsheets and presentations , I 'd primarily use my laptop for internet surfing and instant messaging .	St
1.1.4	I have a ton of music and photos and will be doing light photo editing .	St
1.1.5	I already have a 200gb external hard drive so I should n't be needing any extra space .	St
1.1.6	I also tend to run a lot of programs at the same time .	St
1.1.7	Which mac and which configuration makes most sense for me ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks !	St
1.1.9	!	St
1.2.1	Your message implies , but does n't state , you 'll be using your laptop for college .	St
1.2.2	You do n't state if you 're already in college or will be attending later .	St
1.2.3	I assume you 're already in , and know what you need .	St
1.2.4	If you 're not already in , you should first find out what the college recommends .	St
1.2.5	You would n't want to be using a Mac when the college and other students are using MS .	St
1.3.1	With everything you described , the base line new MacBook Pro will suit your needs just fine with one processor tied behind it 's battery .	St
1.3.2	LOL Nothing you mentioned sounds like it will bog down the current line up of MBP unless when you said you run a lot of programs at the same time you mean 10 to 20 processes that would munch up all the resources of ANY portable machine .	St
1.3.3	( Mac or PC ) With the new improved graphics , you 'll be able to do plenty of photo editing even without enabling the faster 9600M GT graphics chip , which if you did enable it , will even give you the ability to edit today 's higher resolution video , though you might want to max out the RAM with 4GB .	St
1.3.4	What it really boils down to , is how much you can afford .	St
1.3.5	Heck , if ya have the $ 2800 in your pocket to get the freshly unveiled 17 & quot ; MacBook Pro , you 'd be able to keep that 200gb external drive just for back-ups since it comes with a 320GB drive standard .	St
1.3.6	Plus a battery that lasts a full 8 hrs .	St
1.3.7	and 1000 charges .	St
1.3.8	( which could very possibly be the life of any machine in college )	St
1.4.1	without any major problems .	St
1.4.2	P	St
1.5.1	I think that a MacBook would do the trick for you .	St
1.5.2	The MacBook Pro is a wonderful machine as well .	Polite
1.5.3	I am recommending the MacBook because it is smaller , lighter and less expensive .	St
1.5.4	It will do everything that you want .	St
1.5.5	You should not need the more robust video processor in the Pro unless you get involved in heavy duty photo and video editing .	St
1.5.6	For the purposes you describe , the only disadvantage of the MacBook , compared to the MacBook Pro , is the 13.3 inch screen .	St
1.5.7	The smaller screen is what makes the laptop smaller and lighter .	St
1.5.8	If you can get to a store that carries the MacBook ( Apple Store or Best Buy , for example ) , you can check out the MacBook and make sure that you like the screen size .	St
1.5.9	My college student daughter loves her MacBook .	St
1.6.1	My sister has a 17 & quot ; toshiba satalite for collage and wishes she did n't have such a large computer .	St
1.6.2	That computer i think is a bit heaveier and thicker than a macbook pro , but the shear largness of 17 & quot ; screen is too much for collage .	St
1.6.3	I have not had a lot of experience with 15 & quot ; macbook pro , but it seems like a good middle ground inbetween to large and not large enough .	St
1.6.4	I have an old ibook with a 12 & quot ; inch screen and it is really easy to carry around and does n't have a terrible battery life ( which I heard the macbook air has ) .	St
1.6.5	So , if $ 700 dollars is n't a problem to spend extra , I would go for teh 15 & quot ; inch macbook pro , the baseline 13 & quot ; macbook would do more than enough for basic computer usage ( which you described ) .	St
1.6.6	And do n't forget that installing and running Windows on a mac is a breeze .	Sug
1.6.7	( if you absolutly needed to run it for some reason ) .	St
1.7.1	Thanks for all your help so far guys !	St
1.7.2	So I think what it 's coming down to for me is the screen size and whether or not I should upgrade to the 4mb .	St
1.7.3	I 'm stuck between the 13 & quot ; and the 15 & quot ; .. what do you guys prefer ?	Ques
1.7.4	Also , will 4mb be a drastic improvement for a laptop , or will 2mb suffice ?	Ques
1.7.5	Thanks !	St
1.8.1	I think you meant 2GB or 4GB of memory rather than 2MB to 4MB .	St
1.8.2	It 's also kinda hard to help you with this decision because it really depends on how you use you machine .	St
1.8.3	2GB will be enough to do all that you described earlier .	St
1.8.4	The good news is if you want to start out with 2GB and you 're not happy with it , then you can always upgrade 1GB at a time until you reach whatever works for you .	St
1.8.5	As far as choosing a screen size , I 'd say take a trip to your local Apple dealer like onemoremile suggested and see what size and weight you 're willing to carry around with you .	St
1.9.1	Albeit being an avid MAC user , I have to say that PC is way better in terms of writing , preparing/giving presentation , organizing , and the whole lot you college kids need .	St
1.9.2	It 's true that Microsoft Office applications are available for MAC , but they all are very quirky .	St
1.9.3	iWork ?	Ques
1.9.4	Meh .	St
1.9.5	But to answer your question , I 'll say you start with a cheaper MacBook - so you wo n't have to rely much on Top Ramen 's as the main source of your diet .	St
1.10.1	Define quirky .	St
1.10.2	Although not a great MS fan , I have to say that the Office for Mac has always been better than Office for Windows .	St
1.10.3	The MBU have touted that for a number of years .	St
1.10.4	Personally , I find that Keynote is head and shoulders above PowerPoint and I take it that you have never used iWork09 .	St
1.10.5	There are also many alternatives to MS Office and all compatible with it .	St
1.10.6	As an & quot ; Avid MAC user & quot ; you should know that MAC stands for Media Access Control , while Mac stands for Macintosh .	St
1.10.7	P	St
1.11.1	Hit me where I hurt the most - I 'm still saving Anyway , when I was using MS Office 2004 for Mac ( thanks for the clarification , btw ) , it took forever to load .	St
1.11.2	On the other hand , other applications like iWork , iTune , Preview , even Adobe CS2 loaded at regular speed .	St
1.11.3	The other issue I had with Mac 's Office was file compatible .	St
1.11.4	I remembered I had my documents written in MS Office 2000 on PC , only to find that the layouts were drastically off when opened in MS Office 2004 for Mac .	St
1.11.5	I had , and still have , no clue what went wrong .	St
1.11.6	I tried to fix the layouts , but for some reasons I could not achieve the same way I wanted , nor the same manner I had done , as the previous version on PC .	St
1.11.7	Now I wish I could be more clarified on these glitches I had , but it happened years ago and I 'm not a computer expert .	St
1.11.8	My speculation is that PC probably does not provide every essential features/technologies on MS Office for Mac , because they want some of their chosen bests preserved for their prestigious PCs only .	St
1.11.9	By all means , why sharing the best with your competitor ?	Ques
1.11.10	Instead , why not giving them something a little crappy so you 'll look better in the competition ?	Ques
1.11.11	Marketing is evil , man .	St
1.11.12	But then again , this is just a personal speculation .	St
1.11.13	In response , I 'd like to hear why Office for Mac is better than Office for Windows .	St
1.11.14	Cheers .	Polite
1.12.1	If you 're coming from PC world you should understand this Macs are generally more difficult to upgrade .	St
1.12.2	Laptops especially .	St
1.12.3	RAM is not difficult to add -- maybe even easier on a Mac than a PC .	St
1.12.4	Beyond that you have to be willing to deal with tiny components in tight spaces and many screws .	St
1.12.5	As a long time Mac user , I tend to buy the best model I can reasonably afford at the time .	St
1.12.6	Computers become obsolete fast enough as it is .	St
1.12.7	I tend to & quot ; grow into & quot ; the power that I did n't need when I bought it .	St
1.12.8	Also , size matters .	St
1.12.9	I bought a 17 ' MacBook Pro because a ) it was a good deal and b ) I thought I would need a big screen because I do a fair amount of video editing .	St
1.12.10	The problem was , even the 17 ' MAC laptops are heavy .	St
1.12.11	Never mind that they do n't fit into most backpacks !	St
1.12.12	So consider that as well .	St
1.12.13	Bottom line ?	Ques
1.12.14	Get yourself the highest performing model with 2GB of RAM that you can afford and that you can comfortably carry .	Sug
1.12.15	Be sure to factor in new software ( iWork 09 ?	Ques
1.12.16	iLife 09 ?	Ques
1.12.17	MS Office ? )	Ques
1.12.18	and the Apple Care plan .	St
1.13.1	other than RAM and HD , it 's not just a Mac thing .	St
1.13.2	That said , the iMac series is really difficult , the Mac Mini is not as difficult and the Mac Pro is really easy .	St
1.13.3	P	St
1.14.1	Something to note is that people are sniping for college students : there are lots of big markups that you 'll encounter .	St
1.14.2	Avoid AT ALL COSTS the college bookstore .	St
1.14.3	They will mark you up no matter what .	St
1.14.4	Get the Mac you get at Pricegrabber or AppleSliced.com , those sites will save you $ $ $ through easy prices .	St
1.14.5	As far as which one you get , that depends on the major , as other commenters have said .	St
