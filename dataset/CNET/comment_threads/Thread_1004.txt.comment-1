Hey folks, I have a question, is there any way to use another kind of ram in my computer?
It came RDRAM, which runs great and fast, but I need more RAM, and frankly, RDRAM, from what I've seen, will cost a very pretty penny!
Infact, I've seen 128MB for somewhere around the $200.00 mark.
What can I do?
