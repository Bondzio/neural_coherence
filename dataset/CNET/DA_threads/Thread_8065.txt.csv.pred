1.1.1	Way back in the mists of time ( that is , sometime in 2007well , that 's way back for many computer users ) , I told of a CD/DVD burner I bought for my Sawtooth G4 tower ( OS 10.4.11 ) from an online vendor recommended here .	St
1.1.2	They sent me something meant to be used internally ( though it had feet ) , and I tried installing it , with the result that I knocked out my Zip drive .	St
1.1.3	I hoped that I would n't have to do any more mucking about inside the computer with that drive , even though I 've installed RAM in the past without a bit of trouble .	St
1.1.4	I then decided that if I could , I 'd use it as an external drive , but the geniuses ( yes , that 's what they are called ) at the Apple Store told me that would make it too slow .	St
1.1.5	I subsequently phoned the place where I had bought it and was assured that the drive should , indeed , fit inside the computer , but the man said that I could use it as a Firewire external drive if I got an enclosure .	St
1.1.6	He even told me the model of enclosure I needed , but not knowing how to put the drive and its little jacket together , I did n't get one .	St
1.1.7	All well and good , but when I went to a the best-known Apple repair place in New York Citythinking that they might be able to advise me or put the thing into an enclosure for a reasonable feeI was told that no , I should n't ( could n't ? )	Ques
1.1.8	put it into a Firewire enclosure , that they did n't even have one for that drive , but even if they had one , it was not advisable to do so .	St
1.1.9	Advised me to try again to put it into the machine ( or let them do it for a hefty price ) or get an external drive from them ( ditto on price ) .	St
1.1.10	And of course , if I chose the first alternative , I 'd have to cart it down in a taxi , wait to be served ( long wait ) , leave it there for days or more , pick it up and then take it back in another taxi .	St
1.1.11	That is n't on unless I have to do it .	St
1.1.12	Any idea who is right ?	Ques
1.1.13	I 'd be inclined to believe the folks who sold it to me , but they are the ones who sold me a drive with feet , for heaven 's sake .	St
1.1.14	If I had wanted to insert it again myself , I would have done it , per Tekserve 's recommendation .	St
1.1.15	Apple Geniuses did n't suggest using it externally at all .	St
1.1.16	I am totally at sea , and if I did n't like the idea of being able to burn files to a CD ( esp .	St
1.1.17	photos , which I could then take someplace to print them out , quaint as that might seem ) , I 'd just skip the whole thing and consider the cost of the CD/DVD drive a loss .	St
1.1.18	I 've gotten excellent advice on this so far , but there has been a new twist or two since the last time I wrote about it .	St
1.1.19	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.20	At least , about who might be advising me best ?	Ques
1.1.21	Most humbly grateful and with apologies for the length of this message , jenny	St
1.2.1	How about you forget about the & quot ; Drive with Feet & quot ; for a while and get the $ 34.99 solution to this problem .	St
1.2.2	This one will absolutely , positively , fit inside your G4 and does not have feet .	St
1.2.3	I recently purchased 2 of these .	St
1.2.4	One went into a G4 like yours and the other into a Firewire enclosure .	St
1.2.5	Those Geniuses at the Apple Store , I wonder what they were smoking ?	Ques
1.2.6	Believe me , they were NOT what their title claims them to be .	St
1.2.7	Putting a CD/DVD burner inside an firewire external enclosure does NOT make it slow .	St
1.2.8	If the place that sold it to you says that it will fit inside a Firwire enclosure , it probably will .	St
1.2.9	I would really like to take a look at a picture of this & quot ; Drive with feet & quot ; .	St
1.2.10	All the internal CD/DVD 's I have seen have a smooth surface on all sides , except the front and back of course .	St
1.2.11	By the way , do they still sell that device at that store ?	Ques
1.2.12	I still ca n't help feeling that they shipped the wrong thing to you .	St
1.2.13	Installing a CD/DVD into an external enclosure is really simple .	St
1.2.14	Usually 4 screws , two plugs and you are done .	St
1.2.15	Good Luck How 's mumsie ?	Ques
1.2.16	P	St
1.3.1	I have a few USB DVDRW drives and they are not much slower than the internals when it comes to recording .	St
1.3.2	HOWEVER I abhor coasters and record at HALF the media or drive speed , whichever is lower so I may never see the 8 or 16X speed the drive is rated at .	St
1.3.3	Yes , my friends claim to record at such speeds but they also have a steady supply of coasters .	St
