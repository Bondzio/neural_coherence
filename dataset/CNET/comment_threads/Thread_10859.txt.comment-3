If I stayed with my present DSL speed which is DSL Lite through AT&T, their entry level DSL speed, with a new laptop having a wireless N card inside instead of a wireless G card inside are you saying I'll be able to notice a much faster speed while surfing wirelessly on the laptop in another part of the house or are you saying the time that it takes my DSL signal to go from my router to the laptop in another part of the house will be faster?
In other words to get a faster DSL speed I'd probably have to upgrade my level of DSL service with AT&T?
Thanks for your comments.
