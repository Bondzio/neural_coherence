I am tired of the updates. I was told that Mac users don't have security updates like windows. Is this true?

Macs need fewer (a lot fewer) updates/patches because of two things: * The operating system is much more stable and secure than Windows. This, in part, comes from its simplicity. *Such a small percentage of users have a Mac, that hackers don't devote much time to hacking it. The more people that use it (Windows), the more appealing it is as a target. Thus, Macs still have security and misc. updates to download, but not to the extent of its Windows counterpart. Hope this helps, John
