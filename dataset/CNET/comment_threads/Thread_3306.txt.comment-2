Install an OS can easily outstrip one's capabilities and too many will plunge into such and find themselves at a shop and out one hundred bucks... That said and you've already begun, there is likely a TYPOGRAPHIC error in that DLL name.
Either that or it's just a WORM, VIRUS or other MALWARE and you don't want it.
As to the missing DVD-ROM, this is not a matter of XP not supporting said device, but more likely some other glitch like we read at http://support.microsoft.com/?id=314060 In no uncertain words, I would delete the noted registry keys and retest.
In no uncertain words, a new install of XP (note no SP1) will likely find the user instantly having to deal with the MS-Blaster and Sasser WORMS the moment they connect to the internet even if they installed their antivirus.
This is why it's better to seek help on the issues rather than reinstall.
