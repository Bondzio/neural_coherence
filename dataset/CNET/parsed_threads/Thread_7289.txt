<s> sometimes i switch my mouse and keyboard ps 2 plugs from one pc to another. </s>
<s> every time i move them from pc 1, when i go back and plug them into the sockets on the back of the pc, i have to uninstall then re install the ps2 drivers in device manager. </s>
<s> then, the mouse and keyboard will work well until the next time i remove them. </s>
<s> i know with the situation as it is, its best not to remove them, and i know there's always the usb option. </s>
<s> i am curious though as to why i have to repeatedly unistall then re install the drivers. </s>
<s> its a bit of a pain to have to do again and again. </s>
<s> any thoughts? </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> I have to restare my computer for a PS/2 devicce to work properly. </s>
<s> It has always been this way. </s>
<s> Get USB devices. </s>
<s> -or- Get a PS/2 to USB keyboard-mouse adapter. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> ...the only other way to solve this is to by a KVM (Keyboard-Video-Mouse) box. </s>
<s> What KVM boxes do is provide constant power to the keyboard and mouse ports so that the PC never discovers that the devices are missing. </s>
<s> If your PCs are close by, having the KVM can be a distinct advantage because then you only need one keyboard, video display, and mouse for all of the computers. </s>
<s> Also, you never have to unplugged them! </s>
<s> The downside is that KVM boxes can be expensive if you get the really good ones. </s>
<s> However, that being said, you can pick up a 4-port box from NewEgg for about $40. </s>
<s> It might solve your problem and create a better solution for you. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
