<s> I am looking for a good TV/PC Monitor. </s>
<s> My current one does not have DVI or HDMI ports. </s>
<s> I currently have a Ceton Infini 4 Digital Tuner in my PC. </s>
<s> My PC connection to my monitor is RGB. </s>
<s> I've been told the picture from the tuners would be better quality with a monitor that has a DVI or HDMI port(s). </s>
<s> My video card has both. </s>
<s> Is this true? </s>
<s> If it is would someone suggest a good TV/PC Monitor. </s>
<s> I use the TV only at times. </s>
<s> Having fiddled with such, it's personal preference if there is any difference at all. </s>
<s> In fact, HDMI with it's HDCP feature can create headaches when it's cranky. </s>
<s> The only reason I see to go with HDMI is if you install a BluRay player. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I pretty much agree with what Bob said re HDMI being difficult at times. </s>
<s> DVI is easier to deal with under most circumstances but then comes the issue of audio. </s>
<s> There are several ways to deal with that depending audio hook ups on pc. </s>
