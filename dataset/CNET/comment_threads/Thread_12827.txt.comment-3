Bob, thanks for your reply.
Both computers I have used do have USB 2.0 cards.
I installed one of them (the device manager shows an enhanced controller for USB), and the other is a new computer that a friend of mine has and does operate as a 2.0 for other devices that he uses.
I am using the cable that was sent with the hard drive so I'm still puzzled about this problem.
