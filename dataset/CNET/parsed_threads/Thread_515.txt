<s> My D, E, and DVD Drives are un-accessible and missing in Windows Explorer. </s>
<s> They also don't show up in &quot;Disk Management&quot;. </s>
<s> This is the second time in a week this has happened. </s>
<s> The last time it was fixed was after I rebooted the PC. </s>
<s> Both times I was trying to play a song in Itunes, when I was unable to access the drives. </s>
<s> My D drive is for my media files. </s>
<s> G is my bluray drive and works fine. </s>
<s> My DVD drive is L... </s>
<s> I think. </s>
<s> How do I fix this? </s>
<s> Thanks for any info! </s>
<s> Windows 7 64 bit, i7 980x @333 6 core processor, 12 GB ram DDR 1600, Radeon 5850 GPU, OCZ Vertex 3 120GB SSD </s>
<s> You head to the BIOS to see if the BIOS lists it. </s>
<s> If the BIOS does not, you ask the machine's maker big questions. </s>
<s> I'll take it that it's out of warranty and you are not comfortable with checking cable connections. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Bob, it does appear in the BIOS. </s>
<s> I don't think it is a loose cable, because when I restart; the drives are back to normal. </s>
<s> But this is too new for that issue but we'd check anyway. </s>
<s> It's possible the builder didn't install the chipset drivers, latest BIOS and overtaxed the PSU. </s>
<s> Looks like you have questions for this PC's maker. </s>
