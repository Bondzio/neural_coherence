oh, i forgot to ad, currently, i really do not have a solid backup plan.
in the past i have used a 1gb thumbdrive to back up important documents and other items of importance; some i would just drop into my second hardrive.
i would do this by using the backup utility that comes with windows xp.
could i even use a 3rd drive as a backup in another raid configuration?
