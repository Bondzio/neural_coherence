set computer to dhcp and let it get ip from switch based on pudgyone's response i flashed on the fact i hard set my laptop's ip to 192.168.1.2 which should have worked just fine with 198.162.1.1 but the web page would not load.
setting the laptop to dhcp it got the same ip !92.168.1.2 from the netgear switch but the page loaded.
what a wonderful way to kill a day so much fun.
i consider this a bug as the ipconfig /all returned the same thing for my setting whether i hard set the ip mask and gateway or i let dhcp do it.
yet one works and one doesn't.
