And (because I had a problem today) you don't have to register - you can get in there temporarily with a name of &quot; temp &quot; and a password of &quot; 512 &quot;. Please let me know if I can send you all more infomation to find this, now.

So we'll have to wait and see if this driver works. But try and post in the original thread to keep the problem in one thread. When you see the message that no other post is allowed try can click on another post to make your post. Good luck. I'll be out most of the day on Saturday and will check back this evening.

I'm afraid of killing it entirely when it's only sick for now - but at least I have drivers on hand for when I need them. Thanks again.
