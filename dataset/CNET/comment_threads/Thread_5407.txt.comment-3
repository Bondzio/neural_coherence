$369.00 It is THE lowest price on the web as of this reply.
I also bought the docking station from JR.COM for $109.00; they matched a price on another website.
MOST SITES will ISSUE A REFUND OR CREDIT if you find a lower price from a LEGITIMATE MAJOR RETAILER within TEN DAYS (usually), online.
They will NOT match prices on one of those Amazon.com 'back bedroom' stores or the like.
I didn't pay for shipping and paid no sales tax to either retailer.
You figure out how &lt;wink&gt;.
This computer is THE BEST on the market so far and will upgrade FREE, to Android 4 a/k/a Ice Cream Sandwich/ICS when ASUS releases it (soon).
Check out http://hothardware.com/Reviews/Asus-Eee-Pad-Transformer-Android-30-Tablet-Review/ and be aware this 32 gigabyte tablet (the TF101-B1) was rated #5/6 on Consumer Reports.
Unless you have machismo issues you won't need anything more than a dual core tablet like this one, for the foreseeable future.
