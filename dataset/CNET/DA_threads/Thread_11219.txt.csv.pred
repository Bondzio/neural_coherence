1.1.1	It seems there are two different kinds of External hardrives .	St
1.1.2	1 .	St
1.1.3	Ones with internal AC and internal fans .	St
1.1.4	2 .	St
1.1.5	Ones with external AC that you can hook/unhook on the hardrive and with no fans but instead with glossy cooling case ( kind of like aluminium or something ) .	St
1.1.6	Which is the best type in terms of reliability and lifespan ?	Ques
1.2.1	As I 've seen those and let 's face it , all models at the shops the best types are the ones folk get in pairs .	St
1.2.2	They get TWO because they can keep a backup on the second model .	St
1.2.3	Yes there is some solid state models now and those might hold up well against what usually kills external drives .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Yeah but I need like 2TB , an SSD external hardrive with 2TB will cost a small fortune .	St
1.3.2	So I am stuck with the regular hardrives for now .	St
1.4.1	Externals of all types today with spinning drives are dying very easily .	St
1.4.2	If your 2TB matters , you have a backup .	St
1.4.3	Bob PS .	St
1.4.4	Those that think picking the right drive will avoid the backup , have not learned the lesson .	St
1.5.1	What do you mean a backup ?	Ques
1.5.2	I am not going to buy two external hardrives the put the same exact content in both of them , it would end up costing 300 bucks instead of 150 bucks , plus there is no guarantee that both wo n't die up eventually .	St
1.5.3	Okay I get that external hardrives are not as reliable as external ssd 's , but as I said when you know that an external ssd cost about 130 bucks for 64GB , it comes to the point where you do n't really have much of a choice other than to buy the less reliable external hardrives .	St
1.5.4	Anyway , that was n't my question , I want to buy a new external hardrive ( previous ones when I was still using Windows XP where Iomega Presitge 500GB and Iomega Professional 1TB ) now I am using Windows 7 64 bits Home Edition and the company that I want to buy from sells either one type of external hardrive with external AC and cold aluminium case and another type is with an internal AC and internal cooling fans .	St
1.5.5	Which is best ?	Ques
1.5.6	And what are the differences really ?	Ques
1.6.1	You seem to dismiss the fact that we only lose what we did n't backup .	St
1.6.2	I found NO DIFFERENCE in the units when it comes to failures .	St
1.6.3	If the sellers will not discuss the products with you , I would not shop there .	St
1.6.4	Here I found zero difference as to the life spans .	St
1.6.5	It is true both will die .	St
1.6.6	But with a spare copy it means that when one dies you know to get another drive to get back into a state of backup .	St
1.6.7	Bob	St
1.7.1	It is the same as the location for a business .	St
1.7.2	If you do treasure or need your data to be safe you will need to make three backups .	St
1.7.3	External drives are not that expensive .	St
1.7.4	You are correct that it will cost close to $ 300 , is the data you have worth that .	St
1.7.5	I have a minimun of three backups of everything I considered important .	St
1.7.6	Check out the Seagate drives at Newegg and ask how bad you might need that data some day .	St
1.7.7	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx ? Submit=ENE & amp ; N=100007601 % 2050001305 % 20600030763 & amp ; IsNodeId=1 & amp ; name=1TB % 20and % 20higher Remember to treat these drives as if they are your new born child .	St
1.8.1	I have not heard of that .	St
1.8.2	How about a link for that ?	Ques
1.8.3	Or do you mean one that uses USB power ?	Ques
1.9.1	I do not use ones with fans or external AC adapters .	St
1.9.2	All hard drives run off DC so I prefer to let the USB power them .	St
1.9.3	I have always like and used Seagate and Western Digital hard drives and found both to very reliable .	St
1.9.4	Seagate is my drive of choice at this time .	St
1.9.5	I do not leave them powered up , I just plug them up and make my backups and then remove them from the system and treat them as if they are a new born baby .	Sug
1.9.6	It is my humble opinion that most external hard drive failures occur by how they are handled .	St
1.9.7	I even go so far as to wrap them up before I store them .	St
1.9.8	I should tell you that I also use thumb drives and DVD for backups to .	St
1.9.9	It depends on just how important the data is .	St
1.9.10	I break it down into three levels .	St
1.9.11	Critical , important , oh well it will not kill me if I lose it .	St
1.9.12	Images of my C drive are kept on DVD 's , thumb drive and external drives .	St
1.9.13	Critical data is kept on thumb drives and external drives .	St
1.9.14	Everything else is on external drives .	St
1.9.15	It all depends on how you view what your backing up .	St
1.9.16	The point to it all is that I have multiple backups of everything and stored in different locations so I am pretty much covered no matter what happens .	St
