The WLAN card recognizes various wireless networks in the immediate area. I can connect to the router via cable through the Ethernet NIC. I have several other computers currently active on the wireless network. All the other systems are running XP Pro SP2 I do not see my wireless network on the 502us even though I see other networks including one creatively named &quot;netgear&quot;. Because the CG814WG is distributed to several ISP's, Netgear does not support the firmware and my ISP has been little help since I couldn't get past tier one support. Anyone out there have any ideas I might try? Anyone else experience any issues with Vista or Broadcom chipsets and this particular modem/router? Thanks in advance for any help. -Rob

It's hard for them to accept it when I reenable SSID broadcast, turn off wep/wpa and get it connected. We then experiment to see what security does work. We also test the laptop at hotspots if it doesn't connect. If it doesn't at 2 hotspots and my laptop does then it's either a bum install of the OS or dead hardware. Sometimes the owner didn't know to use the button on the laptop to turn the wifi on and off. Hope this helps. Bob
