<s> I have an HP f2105 monitor. </s>
<s> The resolution is set at 800x600@60HZ. </s>
<s> The recommended resolution is to be at 1680x1050@60HZ. </s>
<s> How do I get the monitor to go to 1680x1050. </s>
<s> I can't figure this one out. </s>
<s> I'm kind of dumb when it comes to computers. </s>
<s> I'm trying to get better. </s>
<s> Please help! </s>
<s> Thxs, Cris </s>
<s> Appearance and Themes, Display, from within Control Panel. </s>
<s> Select the Settings Tab and there will be a slider to adjust. </s>
<s> If 1680x1050 is not available, you will need to supply the driver file with .INF extension found on a CD that came with the monitor. </s>
