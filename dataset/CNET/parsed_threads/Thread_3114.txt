<s> I have an old computer (P3, 733mhz, 384 MB, 20GB HDD)that worked fine up until today. </s>
<s> Now when I turn it on, it won't boot up. </s>
<s> The fans both start up (Power Supply and CPU), the lights go on, but that is it. </s>
<s> It doesn't go through POST. </s>
<s> The CD-ROM drives won't open either. </s>
<s> Any idea of what the problem could be? </s>
<s> I'm guessing that my motherboard is shot.... </s>
<s> CDROM should open if it is getting power from P/S. </s>
<s> I'd check the P/S first. </s>
