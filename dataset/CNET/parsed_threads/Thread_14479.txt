<s> I'm tired of moving my notebook around and I'm about to set my outlook to work based on the external hard drive and have all my docs there. </s>
<s> I would be moving far less weight. </s>
<s> I was thinking of getting a disk with a firewire connection so it goes faster. </s>
<s> Would like to know if anybody has tried it before and how it worked... </s>
<s> Even today I don't recommend firewire drives on Windows. </s>
<s> Too many times the contents have vanished so if you do that, at least someone warned you off. </s>
<s> As to where the PST is, OUTLOOK can be told to point to the external drive. </s>
<s> Rather than duplicate the web, I'll stop here. </s>
<s> Does it work? </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> Is it reliable? </s>
<s> Varies with each user it seems. </s>

<s> I appreciate your point. </s>
<s> Do you think a drive with a USB connection is more advisable? </s>
<s> I just want to avoid changing the notebook for those small netbooks! </s>
<s> When we talk Windows I go back to USB. </s>
<s> You are more than welcome to try firewire but what risk is there since you'll keep a backup for the day it fails or goes missing? </s>
<s> And the same for USB drives. </s>
<s> This forum is flooded with folks that thought USB and drives in general were &quot;storage&quot;. </s>
<s> All externals seem to fail sooner than internals. </s>
