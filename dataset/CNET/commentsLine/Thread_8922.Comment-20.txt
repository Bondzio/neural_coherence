i have a pingplotter going and it very rarely drops, if ever when i'm not using.
but when i push traffic at times it goes down, but never while it's idle.
it's almost like the modem is 'overwhelmed', but it's not like im pushing form every pc at once, generally it's just one, i click on a file to download and it goes down almost instantly.
that's why i keep thinking it's something on my end.
