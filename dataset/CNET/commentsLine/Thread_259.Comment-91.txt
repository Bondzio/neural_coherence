my crushing deadline has been put off, so i may try to install the 160 sooner than next weekend, if i get a rush of bravery that overtakes my insecurity about moving files and apps.
if i install winxp in the c drive and all of my apps and files in the next partition, how do i use winxp in the second partition?
i mean, if i install wordperfect on the 2nd partition -- let's call it d -- and go to wp, how does it connect -- or work with -- the c partition?
i think i've answered my own question.
it is the operating system for the whole computer, which raises another question: do i install xp on the backup drive which is now serving as my primary or does xp take care of that, too?
3 other questions: 1. when i boot the beast, does it automatically go the c drive and how, short of going to dos, do i get to the d drive, or does it show up in my computer?
and speaking of the desktop, can i put shortcuts to the various drives and partitions on the desktop??
the second question is more complicated.
2. my first computer was built by two friends and the guy that installed all of the software set it up so that every wp file also was copied to a 3.5 floppy -- remember those?
-- so i'd always have a backup copy.
if i reinstall my current drive, can i set up the computer so that wp will write to that drive?
i have always kept my created wp files (newspaper articles, questions and notes) in a separate folder called wptext so i don't have my written files all jumbled up in the app's files, another suggestion from my software friend.
3. how do i tell the computer which is the master and which is the slave?
thanks again, ann
