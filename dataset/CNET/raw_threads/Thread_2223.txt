I want to connect the printer to a laptop HP Pavillion dv1000 with USB port. I went to HP site and found drivers that I suspect are for later models of the 2100. I got the physical connector to enable me to use USB port of the laptop. How can I get a driver that will run under XP on my laptop. Does anyone have any ideas?

The dv1000 came with XP so unless you did something odd, it should just work. Bob
