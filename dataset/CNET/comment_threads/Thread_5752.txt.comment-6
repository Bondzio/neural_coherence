You can enable RAID on the MB and XP will see the new hardware and allow you to install the driver.
This differs from trying install XP on an existing array where you'd need to pre-install the drivers from a floppy.
With the RAID drivers already installed, you can create the array and move the OS over to it.
Now, I have done this with RAID 1 on an SATA set but not RAID 0.
I presumed it would work either way but could be mistaken.
