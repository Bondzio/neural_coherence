my first 12/1969 commador vic 20, 2nd 03/1980 c-64.
i miss my c-64, that was a great little machine.
ran all the atari games and accepted the atari joy stick.
the color was great.
my favorite games were choplifter,zaxxon, and zaxxon 3d.
anyone know if either of those games were ever made for the pc?
i may just have to by another c-64.
i looked at all the retro's but no one has produced those 2 games.
