My brother bought a t6522 from circuit city and then he bought a 7800gt vcard.Well 3 days later the 7800gt doesnt work in this machine.We have changed drivers and took it too compusa to see if they knew what the problem was and they called said its fixed well ok!!So we carried it home and it wont even load steam/HL/2.Ihad to delete norton antivirus to get steam too install.And it still wont play the game it hard locks so anyone wanting too game on this computer i would suggest too buy some other brand we are gonna try to get x850xt/pe and see if that will fix the problem..And one more thing too note circuit city we asked could we bring it back since it dont work for what we wanted it for they said sure for a 15% restocking fee WTF customer service??????Ill never buy emachine again..

Kinda like taking a VW bettle and putting a supercharged V8 engine in it. A highend video card requires a highend PC. John

Ok.Turns out that nvidia and ati mothervoard dont mix well.But a X850xt/pe is screaming on this comp.So the ATI based cards will work.Man this thing is real nice now.And one more thing im not fool just figured ATI wouldnt make you have too buy there crap..

I've heard of stories where ppl have put in newer, nVidia cards, into an emachines T6520/T6522 and working fine, but they were 6 series... Maybe its the card, but I'm glad your rolling now! If you still have the 7800GT(Don't think so), but maybe check it in another PC. Oh yea, I gotta disagree with you guys up top. I know the 7800GT would've been in a bottleneck, but not horribly. Its a newer CPU, 1GB of ram at 400Mhz... Good job on upgrading the PSU. -Ibrahim *CNET Help Forums need an edit button!!
5912	9	126278	1435984	1434166	ozos	9/22/05 6:43 PM	1.12741458E12	it's a bottleneck not in performance...	but in quality a 7800GT is a high performance and high quality part, an eMachine is not only the CPU would be of a good quality also, the chipset does not equate the card you can use, you don't need to use !!!'s in everything, and your wrong on so many levels instead of trying to figure out why it wasn't working, you assumed ATi/nVidia issue if ATi made the board not work with nVidia cards they'd be in court so fast their heads would spin (same for nVidia chipsets with ATi cards) Microsoft seemingly tried this with Sun Microsystems, making portions of one of the Windows versions, I think XP, incompatable with Java, and not including much Java support from the begining, Sun had them in court so fast it wasn't funny the companies may be competing, but they aren't going to backstab each other, your issue could be from a number of things, many of which could be entirely your fault, please calm down when your posting, it seems as if your yelling and screaming and ranting every single time, this is a place of intellectual exchange, not a wrestling ring

I purchased an Nvidia 6800 manufactured by Gigabyte with really nice specs. After I installed it, everything would freeze up (the Media Center Applications in particular) no matter what drivers I used. I then bought an ATI X800 LX actually manufactured by ATI and everything works great now. The T6522 has an ATI motherboard afterall. Maybe ATI made it so that it ''does not play well with others''
