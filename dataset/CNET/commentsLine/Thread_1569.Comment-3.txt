although your pc can handle 8gb, vista 32bit will only be able to address 4gb and only 3gb or so will be useable.
slow startup is usually caused by crapware or uneeded apps.
run windows defender and use its &quot;software explorer&quot; feature to see what's running currently and what runs automatically at startup.
get rid of software you don't use and don't allow products like quicktime and acrobat to put their 'helpers' in the startup group.
