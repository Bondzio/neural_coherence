I have used the fancy names like Lexar and Sandisk with the same success as lesser known/generic/store brand USB drives. Just make sure it is a USB 2.0 model. Check reviews at online stores like NewEgg.com. The rest is all the bells and whistles you think you need: color, key loops, mp3 player, security software, material, finish, cartoon characters, ballpoint pen, Swiss army knife, etc. I do someties spend more to get the model that comes with encryption software--very handy.
