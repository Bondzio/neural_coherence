Why the static ipaddresses?
Did your ISP provide you with those numbers?
If they provide you only one ipaddress, then you better have a router after your modem.
Your switch is not going to help you.
If you have one ipaddress from your ISP, does your modem have router function?
You don't really need a switch unless you don't have enough ports on the router for all your computers which possibly is your case.
More info please.
