1.1.1	Hi, I am trying to move Gigs of information from an old PC to a new one.	St
1.1.2	Both are equipped with NIC cards, so I installed my Zyxel Prestige 623 ADSL modem/router on both and connected them both to the router.	St
1.1.3	My problem is that while I can ping the router from each machine neither machine can ping the other.	St
1.1.4	Any idea what could be wrong?	St
1.1.5	Note that the Zyxel ADSL modem/router is no longer connected to an ADSL line, could this be the problem ?	Ques
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	as i can see you have 2 pc's connected to a router.	St
1.3.2	assigning IP from DHCP on router.	St
1.3.3	Try disabling your firewalls (inc. MS firewall if applicable) Hope it helps, Stephen M	St
