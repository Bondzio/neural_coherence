emachines have been producing pretty good computers in the last couple years with no more maintenance, problems, or lemons than any other computer factory % wise.
you have posted just 4 times since coming to cnet apparently just to rage/rant against emachine.
what kind of computer do you now have, and why don't you put the stats in your 'profile' (click on your name).
my wife has had a emachine for the past 3 years without a hint of trouble.
