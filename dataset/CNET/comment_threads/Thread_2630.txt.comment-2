What does Disk Management say about the disk?
http://hubpages.com/hub/Using-Disk-Management-in-Windows-7-Vista is a not too clear article about it.
The most important thing: don't CHANGE anything.
Don't chkdsk.
Don't defrag.
Just look with Disk Management and tell what you see.
I assume your off-line backup still is OK.
So you won't lose anything, whatever you do.
Still, it makes sense to be careful.
