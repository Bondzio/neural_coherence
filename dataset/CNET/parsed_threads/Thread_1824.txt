<s> ya you can do it manually from the BIOS. </s>
<s> i dont have a turbocache card but if you go to the BIOS at startup, then go to advanced, it will have an option for that. </s>

<s> If you are nervous about messing with the BIOS, try going to Nvidia's site and downloading ntune. </s>
<s> it may or may not be compatible with your card, but if it is, it had plenty of options for stuff like that. </s>
<s> hope this helps. </s>
