1.1.1	My brother has the only computer connected to the internet in the house and refuses to let us set up a home network because he's paranoid.	St
1.1.2	Is there any way to hook up both a wireless router and his computer to the cable modem seperately?	St
1.1.3	I'd hate to have to get a whole seperate cable hookup.	St
1.2.1	Some modems have the standard Ethernet connection and a USB connection.	St
1.2.2	Some allow both to be used at the same time, some don't.	St
1.2.3	You'll just have to investigate the modems available to you.	St
1.2.4	If a modem will allow both connections, connect his using the USB port, and then connect a router using the Ethernet port for the other PCs.	St
1.2.5	I think I'd have a heart to heart with my brother.	St
1.3.1	Just don't set up SHARING and have him use a strong password on his system but if he is that paranoid, personally, I'd get my own hook up and even use a different server.	St
1.3.2	I had a friend some time back with a similar issue and eventually that is what happened, separate hook ups and different service providers, what a nightmare that was!	St
