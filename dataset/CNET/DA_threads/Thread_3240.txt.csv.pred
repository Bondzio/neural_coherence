1.1.1	I am running windows XP professional on an ASUS P4T motherboard with 2Gb rdram and 1.8 MHz Pentium 4 processor.	St
1.1.2	My sound card is a Creative Audigy live.	St
1.1.3	My graphics card is an ATI All In Wonder 7500.	St
1.1.4	I have downloaded all the latest drivers and updates for all my hardware and the operating system Here is my problem and it is driving me crazy!!!	St
1.1.5	When I play the TV on the computer the video and sound are out of sink (the sound and video play at different times like a poorly dubbed karate movie).	St
1.1.6	The graphics card uses the sound cards input to play sound through a cable connecting both cards.	St
1.1.7	Another weird thing is that my system keeps muting the input volume by itself as though resetting itself.	St
1.1.8	I hope it is just a configuration issue but I am clueless.	St
1.2.1	i'm assuming this is recorded tv.	St
1.2.2	if so, the mpeg recording could be overtaxing your cpu.	St
1.2.3	unfortunately, the all in wonder series is discontinued.	St
1.2.4	if you're using it for tv tuning/recording, you should dial back it recording quality.	St
1.2.5	if you have a seperate tv tuner, a new video card with hardware assisted mpeg playback could help.	St
1.2.6	look for a radeon x1000 or geforce 7000/8000 series video card.	St
1.3.1	Actually it is live TV that does this, weird huh.	St
1.3.2	I got rid of XP and went back to 2000 and everything works fine now so I guess I am just stuck with an older operating system.	St
