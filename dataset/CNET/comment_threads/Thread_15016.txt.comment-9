Look at the complaints about one example (there are many others.)
AVG's link scanner can cause such.
Your post is lacking in so many ways that I can't begin to list the thousand reasons why such delays happen.
But there is VOIP so I know that it can soak the network and cause a DNS to fail and game over.
The fix for that is up to you and your IT to work out with a dedicated DNS if that's it.
But I find folk that go into &quot;it can't be that&quot; mode and find it best to let them season for awhile.
