first, games (and almost any program) will not move if they have been installed.
they're set in the registry and just will not move.
other stuff can be moved by putting the old drives either: as a slave drive in the new machine by putting the drives into an external usb2 case once xp is installed in a machine it cannot be installed into another machine.
remember the &quot;activation&quot; step?
