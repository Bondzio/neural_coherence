the drive was partitioned during windows xp installation, i didn't do anything special to it or try to create multiple partitions.
like i said, if i put it into my old pc it works fine.
my brother has an external usb case so i guess i'll go try to put it in his and see what happens...at least then i'll know if it's the case or not.
thanks for all your help folks...this has been a real frustration for me and at least now i have some direction...thanks again.
