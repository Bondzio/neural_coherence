I have an LCD monitor with a DVI input, but my PC does not have the DVI output. I dont play games on my computer, but I do watch videos and DVD's. Is it worth it for me to purchase a video card and if so, can anyone recommend the DVI card to buy. Thanks

I have used both DVI and D-Sub and have seen NO differences. I actually like D-Sub better because you can make adjustments, like contrast, move the &quot;picture&quot; around. DVI is set at whatever. My call: No need to buy a new card. ~Ibrahim~
