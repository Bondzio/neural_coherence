<s> Wanting to use external usb HDD for notebook, delete partitions and format went ok, now do not know how to load oper sys to disk from notebook drive. </s>
<s> Go &quot;My Comp&quot; and select drive, no options there. </s>
<s> Right click, select &quot;Manage&quot;, go &quot;Disk Manag&quot;, only gives Format and Delet Part again. </s>
<s> Should I try switching to Boot USB first with Oper disk in tray? </s>
<s> Only thing I know is swap HDD's and load external then switch back. </s>
<s> Running Gateway lap w/XP-Home, 2.6 AMD 64 chip w/1-gig memory, and both HDD's @ 100-gig. </s>
<s> Want external to run my XP-Pro, but will take Home if nothing else. </s>
<s> Oh, Gate restore was no help, just wants to load on existing drive and XP-Pro is not decerning internal or external so I esc out. </s>
<s> Please help a newbie, the newbie you save may be related. </s>
<s> Linux can do that, but be sure you are not attempting to install Windows XP to some USB drive since I've never seen this work. </s>
