<s> I recently purchased a Linksys E3000 with high anticipation of using the dual band due to my use type. </s>
<s> We are avid online RPG gamers (EQ2), utilize Netflix, have all 3 major gaming systems, etc. </s>
<s> Surely, the dual band capability would benefit us. </s>
<s> Now, the problem. </s>
<s> We have 5 laptops, a X-box 360, a Wii, a PS3, several I-pods, smart phones, TV, TiVo, etc., all of which are connected to the router. </s>
<s> The problem is...only 1 of the devices has recognized the 5 Ghz band (the Xbox 360). </s>
<s> None of the other items recognize it. </s>
<s> I have used the Cisco website for troubleshooting and have had no luck. </s>
<s> I have a different name for the 5Ghz network, so it's not a matter of confusion. </s>
<s> I have reset the router and updated the drivers on all the computers. </s>
<s> There are known issues between the Atheros adapaters and E3000 (3 of the 5 laptops have Ahteros adapaters), but I cannot find any issues with the Realtek adapters (the other 2 laptops) - and have no idea what type of adapter the other gaming systems and handheld devices are using. </s>
<s> The OS's on the laptops are XP, Vista, and 7. </s>
<s> Any other ideas would be great. </s>
<s> The Linksys online chat support is worthless...all they tell me is update my drivers. </s>
<s> All your equipment must support 5g and this is uncommon. </s>
<s> In addition all your equipment must support N since you can't run B or G over 5G only A. </s>
<s> Your nic's will clearly say they are DUAL MODE when they support 5g. </s>
<s> They should have options in the drivers to select only the 5G band. </s>
<s> I suspect the equipment that does not work does not support the band. </s>
<s> This is the problem with replacing routers with newer ones expecting better performance. </s>
<s> You in general must replace everything, If you attempt to run a mix of B,G and N devices they will get in each others way and you will get poor performance. </s>
<s> Yeah Bill and it can get a little pricey too, especially with 5 laptops and gaming devices such as the poster mentioned, some and most are not likely compatible with N/dual band set up. </s>
<s> So, it seems I wasted my money on the dual band capability - although in all the reviews I read about this router, NONE of them mentioned the compatibility of the network adapter. </s>
<s> Two of my laptops, however, are 802.11n and say &quot;dual band&quot; - however, I can't get either of them to recognize the 5 Ghz range either. </s>
<s> I have never used dual band nics installed inside the laptop, only ones that are usb external. </s>
<s> I would suspect they work similar. </s>
<s> Their are settings in the device config in the driver that lets you set all kinds of wireless settings. </s>
<s> One option will select the band and it may default to 2.4. </s>
<s> You may have to force it to use 5, Some adapters have their own little app to set this stuff but i think if you are using windows you must set these from the device manager. </s>
<s> Kinda depends one of my adapters will scan both 2.4 and 5 and when you select the device to connect to it set all this stuff. </s>
<s> The other you have to scan each separately. </s>
<s> Never tried set them using just the windows network stuff though. </s>
<s> I would recommend you run everything that can run on 5G and force the 2.4 to run G only or B only if you have stuff that does not do G. Even B is more than fast enough for internet surfing. </s>
<s> Basically as an example, if you have a L/T with a G antenna and you use an N adapter, it will default to G, so here we go again with compatibility issues. </s>
<s> For gaming a hardwire hook up works (generally) better than a wifi hook up but there can be issues doing that as well, cables, hook ups etc. </s>
<s> It can get tricky to be sure. </s>
