<s> I just got a Logitech optical marble mouse(it really is a track ball} for my mother. </s>
<s> Everything loaded fine but what happened is the keyboard no longer works so she cannot even sign in to get into windows. </s>
<s> The lights on the keyboard do not even light up. </s>
<s> I even tried another keyboard. </s>
<s> THe mouse works fine. </s>
<s> I unplugged the mouse and it still did not work. </s>
<s> I even restarted the computer with the Keyboard plugged in and out and still nothing. </s>
<s> She has a HP desktop, OS Windows XP, the keyboard came with the computer and it is a multi media one. </s>
<s> I even called Logitech and they told me to call HP. </s>
<s> That was a joke because they told me to call logitech all they did is to tell me to turn the computer off and on, which I had already did. </s>
<s> Anybody know what is going on? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> For XP, boot SAFE MODE and use system restore to before this install. </s>
<s> Logitech KNOWS the issue. </s>
<s> The fix is to not use the mouse software. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I just asked my mother if she used the software she asked me what software. </s>
<s> So she never used it. </s>
<s> I just went to help her because the keyboard was not working but the mouse was. </s>
<s> I assumed she used it because the mouse was working and it is not a brand new computer, so I knew she needed it, but apprently she didn't. </s>
<s> She told me she just did what the instructions told her to do and indeed she did because I just saw it. </s>
<s> No mention of the software, even though there is a disc.. </s>
<s> It just states turn the computer off, plug the mouse in and turn it on. </s>
<s> Interesting so you are saying this is nothing new if I used the software. </s>
<s> Because they never even asked me if it was used.. </s>
<s> Read http://support.microsoft.com/?id=256233 I would follow the directions on this one. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The same procedure works for XP as well as system restore. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Wow you have got to be kidding me. </s>
<s> There s no way I can do that. </s>
<s> But she never downloaded the driver. </s>
<s> I have a patch for something I do not even know how to use it so there is no way I can do it because I have no clue about any of this rebooting by a disc I am sure she doesn't even have the disc for the computer anymore. </s>
<s> I am mad as h*ll. </s>
<s> There has to be another way. </s>
<s> I am not mad at you, You have been very helpful but I am so mad at Logitech I can spit. </s>
<s> And it is too late to call them now. </s>
<s> If that CD went anywhere near the machine ... </s>
<s> But at least you know about that keyboard filter issue. </s>
<s> For now try another keyboard... Bob </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I thought it was a short also. </s>
<s> Until I swtch the mouse into the port where the keyboard was and it worked I am going to see about one of those no frills Keyboards. </s>
<s> I'll let you know what happens. </s>
<s> Thank you very much you helped a lot At the very least I know that Logitech is full of it and this is a well known problem, ABout the Cd I am going to bury it to make sure my mother doesn't load it. </s>
<s> Good sleuthing on your part. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Viola! </s>
<s> it worked! </s>
<s> Ok a few weeks ago I had a problem with my DVD player. </s>
<s> It is one those that have 400 dvd's in them . </s>
<s> So I had to input the name of most of the DVD's I have a laptop so I had to go buy a a keyboard and the keyboard did not work. </s>
<s> It was one of those multimedia keyboards. </s>
<s> The Keyboard worked with my CD jukebox though so there was nothing wrong with it. </s>
<s> Since the DVD and CD are both Sony's and they required the same keyboard something else was going on. </s>
<s> One of the requirements was the power input of the keyboard could not be over a certain number. </s>
<s> But like I said the CD player worked. </s>
<s> I looked all over for a solution, even here and someone said try and use just a regular keyboard not the multimedia one. </s>
<s> So I had to go and buy one of those and it worked! </s>
<s> I figure it couldn't hurt and try that keyboard with my moms because there was no way I could follow that fix. </s>
<s> It meant bringing the computer somewhere to get it fixed. </s>
<s> And guess what it works!! </s>
<s> It must have something to do with the combined power output with the mouse and the keyboard being too much if the multi-media one is used. </s>
<s> And when I used the regular keyboard without the bells and whistles the power input must of been less. </s>
<s> Just like the DVD player. </s>
<s> Unbelievable. </s>
<s> Now I got to go out and buy another keyboard. </s>
<s> It only cost 4 bucks lol. </s>
<s> I wonder if this would fix other people's computer who have the same problem? </s>
<s> I cannot believed it worked. </s>
<s> I want to thank everyone for sticking with me with this, Logitech should be called to the carpet for this. </s>
<s> They are going to hear from me. </s>
