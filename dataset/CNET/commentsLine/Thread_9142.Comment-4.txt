my take is if the maker won't answer what the spare card slots are, don't buy from them.
as to reliability i see the drive makers are pulling back to 3 years and the machines are only 1 year warranty.
yes they may last longer and they do here.
but then again i know how to used the canned air once a year.
tip!
on your birthday change all your fire alarm batteries and find your canned air to clean your pc's vents.
example at  if you don't do the maintenance then expect shorter life spans.
