equipment: netgear 2200 modem / router vivotek sd8311e camera windows xp pro ip camera is wired to router.
ip cam has static local ip.
i can see the ip cam on my *wired* laptop and wired pcs.
i am unable to connect to ip cam when i use my laptop *wirelessly*.
as soon as i plug in the cat5 cable between the laptop and router, ip cam connects again (i connect by typing the local ip cam address into a browser window).
i am able to see the wireless hp printer.
i am also able to connect to the ip cam from outside the lan since i have forwarded the appropriate ports - just fyi.
what do i need to do to connect to the local ip cam from my local wireless laptop?
thanks!
