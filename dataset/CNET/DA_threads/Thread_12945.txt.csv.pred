1.1.1	/\ || ||	St
1.2.1	that your mobo only has a PCI Express 16 slot [black] for video.	St
1.2.2	In that case you want an 880XT not an 800XT.	St
1.2.3	Don't see any available and since it is the 800 in PCI Express form it would seem that when available they'll only be in 256 MB form, as the 800's seem to be..	St
1.3.1	on those board?	St
1.3.2	Does it make my computer fly?	St
1.3.3	hehe.	St
1.3.4	Good thing I am not into gameing!	St
1.4.1	Hi Art, maybe it'll make your graphics work faster.	Sug
1.5.1	Yeah, I'm 16.	St
1.5.2	Actually if you take a look at Zipzoomfly, you can find it for $235 shipped.	St
1.5.3	That's not too shabby, considering everyone else has it for around $275 PLUS s/h.	St
1.6.1	By the way, Dell has a 128mb card as an option on their Dimension 8400 and XPS systems.	St
1.7.1	PCI Express 16 as the video slot???	St
1.7.2	The 800XT is an AGP card.	St
1.8.1	NIL	St
1.9.1	why not the upcoming 6600GT or X600XT?	St
1.9.2	(x600XT is out already) those are both native PCI X16 cards...	St
1.10.1	http://www.academicsuperstore.com/q/PartNo/f/market-marketdisp/v/714519/RADEON.html/q/PartNo-qk_srch/f/market-marketdisp/v/714519-RADEON+X800+PRO+256MB+AGP+Graphics+Card/RADEON+X800+PRO+256MB+AGP+Graphics+Card/RADEON.html?sourcecode=s10142&promocode=pc11303 Try Froogle, that's where I found this.	St
1.10.2	I have never bought from this site.	St
1.11.1	I guess $250 doesn't sound too bad; but the few that I have seen was for about 400 bucks.	St
1.12.1	&quot;The 800XT is an AGP card&quot; I'm not sure where you got that information, but I'm afraid you're gravely mistaken.	St
1.12.2	The x300, x600, and x800 all have AGP and PCIe capability.	St
1.12.3	Try www.ati.com for more information.	St
1.13.1	800 for the PCI Express 16 has not been released yet.	St
1.13.2	They are NOT interchangeable with an AGP slot.	St
1.13.3	Totally different internal architecture and won't plug in the others slot.	St
1.13.4	So to answer your first question you can't buy a PCI Express 128 MB X800XT card yet because they have not been released.	St
1.13.5	[probably won't come in a 128 MB configuration] I just wanted to be certain that you understand that you CANNOT plug the AGP card into a PCI 16 slot.	St
1.13.6	I hope that we now understand each other.	St
1.13.7	At $1.25 per minute [$2.50] I hope that I prevented you from buying the incorrect card.	St
1.13.8	If so, it was well worth it.	St
1.13.9	LOL	St
1.14.1	It's a PCIe card.	St
1.14.2	I just went to double-check at Dell and it's actually only available on the Dimension 8400.	St
1.15.1	From what I hear, the x800 is a much faster card.	St
1.15.2	I'm looking for an alternative to spending $400+ on one, so that's why I'm looking into the 128mb version.	St
1.16.1	the PCI Express version of the 800 has not been released yet.	St
1.16.2	If you don't believe it, simply call them on the 900 number.	St
