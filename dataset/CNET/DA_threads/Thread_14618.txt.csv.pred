1.1.1	I am having a problem with my computer itself, not the rest of the network.	St
1.1.2	My computer drops it's connection and it can't be repaired usually.	St
1.1.3	I have to reboot to get the connection back, and then it drops again.	St
1.1.4	I wasn't sure which forum to post in, so posted the problem in the Computer Help Forum.	St
1.1.5	I don't mean to cross-post or whatever it might be called and i apologize if I am inadvertently violating a forum posting rule.	St
1.1.6	The post in the other forum is Computer connection problems, please take a look at it if you can, thanks	Sug
1.2.1	As I said in my post over in the other forum, I posted here before checking the forums for some of the other software.	St
1.2.2	It seems that the problem COULD be some of the AVG exe's weren't given full permissions in my firewall and that might be the problem.	St
1.2.3	So anyone using AVG and a firewall having this problem should visit this post in the AVG forums: http://freeforum.avg.com/read.php?14,169312,backpage=,sv= And the link to my post in the other forum in case anyone wants to read a more detailed description of the problem I was having is: http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6620_102-0.html?forumID=44&threadID=328534&tag=unsubscribeForm;tracked-disc Again, sorry for posting in here before I checked the other forums, and sorry for posting in 2 different forums	St
