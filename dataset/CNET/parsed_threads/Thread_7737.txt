<s> I'm going to build a Media Center PC and I bought the Logitech Harmony 880 Universal Remote [ http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/remotes/universal_remotes/devices/372&cl=us,en ]. </s>
<s> What is the best HDTV TV Tuner card to use? </s>
<s> I was told that I need to get a TV tuner card that comes with a remote and IR (infrared) receiver so that the Harmony 880 is able to control the functions for the Media Center PC. </s>
<s> Could someone please suggest a good HDTV tuner card that you've used or know of. </s>
<s> Thank You </s>
<s> Forgot to add that I'm building it with Vista 64Bit Home Premium because I was told that I can also use vista instead of XP Media Center. </s>
<s> stick with 32bit for better tv tuner options: check out hauppauge cards and bundles: http://www.hauppauge.com/site/products/prods_mckit.html http://www.hauppauge.com/site/products/prods_hvr_internal.html and pinnacle's usb hdtv stick: http://www.pinnaclesys.com/PublicSite/us/Products/Consumer+Products/PCTV+Tuners/PCTV+Flash_TV+Stick/PCTV+HD+Ultimate+Stick.htm remote: http://www.pinnaclesys.com/PublicSite/us/Products/Consumer+Products/PCTV+Tuners/PCTV+Vista+Companion/Pinnacle+Remote+Kit+for+Windows+Media+Center.htm </s>
