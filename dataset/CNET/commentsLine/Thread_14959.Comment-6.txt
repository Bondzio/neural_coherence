i have a thinkpad x40.
no cd drive.
however it came with a docking station that had a drive.
most software i use is available over the net.
thus you download and install.
some software i've purchased and requires a cd/dvd drive.
i had to hack some of it to make it run without the cd/dvd check since i normally don't have the drive.
short answer.
&quot;yes no cd/dvd drive is a pita&quot; if you need to intall some software.
if you can get all that software over the net, or alreayd do, then it won't be a problem.
re-formating the computer without a os disk should be interesting.
