<s> I had an IDE hard drive in one pc, I wanted to move it from this one to another. </s>
<s> Did that it didn't come up in windows explorer. </s>
<s> Had a look in disk management and it was sitting there without a drive letter, it said unknown disk type, not initialized and unallocated. </s>
<s> Now I have some very important things on this drive I need. </s>
<s> I asked a friend what to do, he said take it back to the original pc and back it up. </s>
<s> Did that, it comes up with the same thing. </s>
<s> Both pc's are XP, I haven't changed it from being the slave drive and there is a master in both pc's. </s>
<s> Can someone help me? </s>
<s> &quot;XP&quot; doesn't support over 127GB drives and such will not show. </s>
<s> Maybe you had XP SP3 but didn't tell. </s>
<s> That doesn't matter as I have to take your word here and use that for clues. </s>
<s> Also there is not much else in your post to use for clues. </s>
<s> If you want other ideas, tell more. </s>

<s> I suspect that the HD in the original system wasn't readable or available, it will repeat the same problem on another system. </s>
<s> If that's the case, then what is the original problem or reason to try to recover data. </s>
<s> Once, that's explained we can go from there. </s>
<s> Otherwise, you may not be resolving the real problem. </s>
<s> Please explain system specs and details or order to give a some resolution. </s>

<s> You'd better try data recovery software, no matter to which computer you connect this hard drive. </s>
<s> I recommend you a product Data Recovery Wizard I'm so appreciate it and it has saved me many times. </s>
<s> Don't write anything new to this hard drive before you could confirm that you have recovered the files. </s>
