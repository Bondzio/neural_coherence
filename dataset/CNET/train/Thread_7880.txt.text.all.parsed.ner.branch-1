10032	7	237620	2426441	2426388	mrmacfixit	3/10/07 1:03 pm	1.17353178e12	slide on over to the apple store	and configure the macbook for yourself. you will then see all the options available to you on that machine. on the subject of memory. maxing it out is a good shot in the arm for processing power. disregard the comment about purchasing larger ram chips when they become available. the top limit for ram in the macbook is 2gb, even if you put in two 4gb sticks. even with the built-in graphics, you will easily be able to edit photo's in iphoto or photoshop elements. processing power is more important here. imo. applecare is highly recommended on a laptop. the 2.0 ghz macbook with 160 gb hd and max'd out ram will set you back $1973.00 p
