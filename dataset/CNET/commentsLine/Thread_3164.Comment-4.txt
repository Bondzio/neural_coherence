does the connection icon happen to say something about &quot;limited or no connectivity&quot; if you hover your mouse above it?
in that case, it looks different from how it normally looks when there is a full connection?
two related things to check: 1. does the router management page show it as connected?
what ip-address?
2. what does ipconfig (run it from the command prompt) exactly say about the ip-address of the pc, the gateway and the dns?
