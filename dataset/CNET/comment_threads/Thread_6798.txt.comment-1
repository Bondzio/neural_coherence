Hi, I just recently purchased two Western Digital 10k rpm 74 gig raptor drives and set them up on my ASUS SK8V mobo...
They show up in the VIA RAID tool and I configured them for RIAD 0 which the &quot;VIA RAID TOOL&quot; acknowledges...
However I cannot access their storage.
I'm used to going to &quot;My Computer&quot; and double clicking on a regular IDE drive and being able to access its storage, however these drives are not located in the &quot;My computer&quot; area.
Also when I restart my computer I get the &quot;Promise Fast Track 378&quot; message that says &quot;No controller detected by fast track, the BIOS is not installed.&quot; Or something very similar, my memory isn't the greatest right now.
So basically I'd like to know what you think I may have to do in order to access the 148 gigs of memory I have in these two drives.
Because right now they're just hanging out in my rig doing nothing.
Any help is appreciated...
Thanks for your time
