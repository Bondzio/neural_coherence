1.1.1	As noted; I have a G5 PPC operating with OS X 10.5.8.	St
1.1.2	I am wanting to use a microphone plugged into the Audio Line-In Port on the rear of the computer.	St
1.1.3	Can you offer a suggestion as to what manufacturer and model does a nice job of laying down a voice track (no singing involved).	St
1.1.4	According to the Power Mac G5 Guide this microphone would need to be a &quot;self-powered&quot; mike.	St
1.1.5	Which leads to a secondary question of why did Apple include a &quot;non-self-powered&quot; mike with the computer?	St
1.1.6	Thank you	St
1.2.1	If the mic, that was included with your computer, came from Apple, then it should work.	St
1.2.2	What makes you think it is a &quot;non-self-powered&quot; mic?	St
1.2.3	If probably has a longer than usual connector (pin) on it and draws its power from inside the socket.	St
1.2.4	Did you try it?	Sug
1.2.5	P	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	Everything else works but the mic.	St
1.4.2	Even a poor quality Mic that I don't want to use.	St
1.5.1	mrmacfixit How do they work?	St
1.5.2	Just connect and use??	St
1.5.3	I want to use this to lay a voice sound track in iMovie and that only offers the &quot;Built in Audio&quot; as a source for this voice over?	St
1.5.4	Does this become another choice or do I need to make some setting changes somewhere?	St
1.5.5	Is there one you would recommend?	St
1.6.1	I have a Logitech headset with mic.	St
1.6.2	You just connect it to the USB port and it becomes an option in the sound preference pane.	St
1.6.3	Quality is very good, for a headset, but there are much better ones out there.	St
1.6.4	Think I paid around $15 for them.	St
1.6.5	Google for USB microphone or take a look at the Logitec site P	St
1.7.1	Thank you much.	St
1.7.2	Will look into that.	St
1.8.1	This may get a little stupid sounding but your headset; what is it for?	St
1.8.2	Can the system react both ways (audio in & audio out) through the USB?	St
1.9.1	I use the headset for Skype, iChat and on-line Flight Simulation.	St
1.9.2	P	St
1.10.1	Didn't realize there were so many reasons for a headset.	St
1.10.2	Looked at Logitech headset and mike on MacConnection, saw about 26 reviews on this item, 20 gave it rave review with 15 making it 5 out 5 star and the others 4 out 5.	St
1.10.3	They used for reasons you sited and some gaming.	St
1.10.4	Guess I need to get out a little more.	St
1.10.5	Going to order a Logitech later today.	St
1.10.6	Thanks again.	Polite

1.12.1	MRmacfixit Bought a Logitech Clear Chat Comfort headset and mic and it is sensational.	St
1.12.2	Can't understand what's not to like.	St
1.12.3	Problem solved.	St
1.12.4	Thanks again.	Polite
1.12.5	Bob Moffett	St
1.13.1	a satisfied customer.	St
1.13.2	Thank you Enjoy P	St
1.14.1	Ay, I see that you found how Apple stuck it to its customers, once again, you would think a higher priced computer would out shine a M$ machine.	St
1.14.2	The port on the Mac is for in-line (powered sources) only, no 'regular' mic will work.	St
1.14.3	You will need a usb mic or an external mic input via usb.	St
