I live in the UK but a memeber of my family will be going to LA next week on vaction.
He'd be quite willing to buy one of these scanners for me if I could give him the name and address of a store where they stock them.
They are substantially cheaper in the US than here in England.
I don't know exactly where he is staying in LA (and I've never been there myself) but I presume that during his time in LA he will go downtown (if that's the right term) for the main tourist sights etc.
I'd be grateful for a few names of stores that stock the docupen so he can pick the most convenient and so I can check prices.
Grateful for your help Bill S
