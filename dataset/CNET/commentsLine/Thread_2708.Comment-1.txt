hi!
i just bought the above.
have some questions.
1) which usb 2.0 hard disk should i buy?
i need a hard disk of 300gb for home surveillance video recording and from netgear's website there's no such compatible hard disk capacity.
take 100gb for 7hrs of video recording.
2) can i just use any usb 2.0 casing with any 300gb hard disk for this purpose as it is cheaper than say to buy maxtor onetouch ii 300gb?
btw, is the maxtor onetouch ii compatible with the router?
3) is it true that even if you have a compatible hard disk the usb 2.0 performance fall very short of expectation?
