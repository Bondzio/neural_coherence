<s> I only come to these forums once in a blue-moon when I need some real help from you wonderfully tech savvy ladies and gents. </s>
<s> Basically, the age old question, can you recommend me a great wireless router? </s>
<s> Been surfing around CNET trying to get some professional opinions, (looks like the Belkin N+ is my best bet), but I just wanted to double and triple check. </s>
<s> Basically I need a VERY FAST AND VERY STRONG router for GAMING. </s>
<s> I want 0 lag, and 0 kick-off (or as close as I can get). </s>
<s> &quot;Well why don't you just go wired? </s>
<s> Stupid.&quot;, I know, but I have a lot of pets and I'm trying to minimize my wire usage around the house, not to mention it's much more aesthetically pleasing. </s>
<s> Money is no issue, I just need something with a fast and solid connection. </s>
<s> Basically only gaming consoles (PS3, 360) will be hooked up to it wirelessly (not more than 2 feet away), aside from a laptop in the basement. </s>
<s> However, there will be two computers aside from that hooked up wired. </s>
<s> Just need some outside opinions or research before I make the plunge. </s>
<s> Like I said, I've been looking into them and the Belkin N+ seems like my best bet, but I'm not 100% it's great reviews are put through their paces in a gaming setting. </s>
<s> Any other suggestions? </s>
<s> Links to reviews I could check out? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Oh, by the way, I'm aware the things I'm connecting to are only Wireless G, but I intend on buying a computer or two in the future with Wireless N connectivity, so I figured I might as well get a router now to utilize that rather than upgrade later. </s>
<s> If there is one thing I've learned, gamers don't like Wifi. </s>
<s> Get wired. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Any one have any actual recommendations? </s>
<s> Get one you can install OpenWRT or similar on. </s>
<s> I've found this to make a bad router good and a good router better. </s>

<s> Alright thanks, I'll keep an eye on that. </s>
<s> What's your opinion on the Belkin N+ I mentioned? </s>
<s> I know it got top honours here on CNET, but I just wanted to be sure it is, in fact, the best wireless router out there when money is no concern. </s>
<s> We have some fine discussions about N and how it didn't deliver the goods for some. </s>
<s> In fact if you can't keep all the gear from one maker you often find yourself disabling &quot;N&quot; and sticking to &quot;G&quot;. </s>
