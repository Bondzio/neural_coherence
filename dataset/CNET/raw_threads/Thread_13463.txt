Return it under your warranty. 2. Try another monitor on this computer. If it doesn't work either, then either the graphic card is defective, or you plug the monitor in the wrong connection (but most of the time there's only one), or you messed things up yourself by changing the BIOS or opening the case and removing or damaging things. Call the helpdesk to see if it's a warranty issue. But I wonder if a 'windows 2000 pentium 4' computer really is new, as you write. Anyway, the diagnostics above still apply. Repair by a qualified tech might be necessary. Hope this helps. Kees
