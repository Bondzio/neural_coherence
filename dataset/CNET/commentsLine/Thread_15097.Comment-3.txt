the mtrbd.
specs are provided via the manual or the support website for your model.
understand the memory mapping as sometimes certain conditions must be present.
in general if the mtrbd.
supports fsb of 333mhz.
though you can install ddr pc3200/400mhz, you can use it only at 333mhz.
if the mtrbd.
can in fact use pc3200 at fsb of 400mhz in may want certain memory slot(s) used only or all are supported.
also, the level of the cpu class installed will determine the final setup as the mtrbd.
using its &quot;automode&quot; setting may pick the best overall operation or at least the safest one with lack of problem(s).
these mtrbds.
can be in most cases be &quot;manually&quot; setup to increase its operational speed but may lock-up or outright fail if pushed too far but a default mode should recover it.
good luck -----willy
