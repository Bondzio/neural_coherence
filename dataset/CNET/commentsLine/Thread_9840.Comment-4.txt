i would see whether i want a $200 case or not, depending on the whether the added features it has has is of use to me.
heat reduction is my main objective in buying a case because the room the computer is going to be in is going to rise to 31 degrees celsius.
the manufacturers page is not clear at all, it looks as though you can put more fans in the 400r than the 550d or 650d, if someone could please just list the differences that would be great and that is all i am asking for.
