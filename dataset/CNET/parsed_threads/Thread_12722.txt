<s> I used to have a buddy build them but he moved. </s>
<s> I'm planning on buying a desktop because I'm useless at the whole building thing and I REALLY want a pretty good gaming rig but don't want to spend a rediculous amount of money on it... no more than $3000-$5000... $3000 is better so i still have electricity to run it. </s>
<s> suggestions for companies, configurations, and/or specs are greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> **at least 3.0 GHz procesor and a good amount of HD space are ideal. </s>
<s> That 3GHz number is what we may have written about the old Pentium 4 CPUs. </s>
<s> Today you can pop in a nice 2.0GHz Core 2 Duo and that CPU will fly past the old P4. </s>
<s> I strongly suggest some reading over at tomshardware.com and then consider cloning something there if you like it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> hey buddy. </s>
<s> let me start off by saying &quot;DON'T BUY IT. </s>
<s> BUILD IT !! </s>
<s> !&quot; (are u still reading !!) </s>
<s> Here's why: 1) You'll get the exact configuration you want for your needs 2) It's probably gonna be cheaper than pre-built PCs 3) It'll be easier to upgrade in the future since you know EXACTLY what you put in there and what it is compatible with 4) There is a ton of information and resources available on the web to instruct you on how to do it. </s>
<s> You don't need to be a computer engineer or a technician. </s>
<s> You just have to follow a logical sequence of steps. </s>
<s> 5) It is EASY and FUN !!! </s>
<s> youtube.com videos and computer.howstuffworks.com have tons of info on building a PC. </s>
<s> here's a good page that explains the basic steps (once you read this, you'll change your mind and then look for more detailed info) : http://computer.howstuffworks.com/build-a-computer.htm Note that I'm new to system building too. </s>
<s> 3 months ago, the very thought of building a PC sent shivers down my spine. </s>
<s> But I have done a lot of research over the past few months about comp parts and technologies. </s>
<s> Now, I am armed with so much information that I'd feel stupid buying a pre-built PC. </s>
<s> Assuming that you will consider my advice and think about building your PC, here's some relevant info: NOTE - i'm planning to build a high-end machine for gaming, just like you are, so I think that you might find my few cents on this helpful. </s>
<s> First let's start with the &quot;Where to buy&quot; - Undoubtedly, newegg.com. </s>
<s> Overwhelming variety of computer parts and accessories, and from the reviews i've read, great cust. </s>
<s> service and super-fast shipping. </s>
<s> Motherboard - I have read that ASUS and EVGA are good. </s>
<s> - Processor: You probably want Intel Core 2 Duo or Core 2 Extreme (Extreme is available in Dual and Quad core) - RAM: about 4 GB DDR2 800 Dual channel (Patriot, Corsair, or G-Skill brand) - Hard drives: Seagate 7200.10 SATA drives how much ever space u need. </s>
<s> (these have become pretty cheap) - Graphics: EVGA 8800 GTX 768 MB PCI-E x16 graphics card. </s>
<s> - A good Power supply unit (probably &gt; 700W power output) - A good case that has room for all this and whatever else you need. </s>
<s> These are the most important components. </s>
<s> The rest are relatively trivial - optical drives (DVD burners, card readers, etc) Finally, I want to include the specs I've decided on for my computer, which will be an all-in-one work/gaming/home-theater system: You can use this as an example or a guide. </s>
<s> You probably want something similar. </s>
<s> Please read and look these up on newegg.com. </s>

<s> id really like to be able to run supreme commander well on my new computer as well as command and conquer 3. they recomend 3.0 GHz of processing speed. </s>
<s> will the core 2 duo still be able to run it? </s>
<s> how long will it take me to build it (keep in mind ive never done this) in terms of hours? </s>
<s> Also, if I run into problems while I'm building it who should I call if i need someone to come in person? </s>
<s> Will this hold the parts mentioned above? </s>

<s> hey man. </s>
<s> first of all, if you know all your parts well and know the basic steps, I don't see the hardware part of the installation taking more than 2 hours. </s>
<s> The software part really depends on how many cards and other devices you have in there. </s>
<s> First there is the OS - that's about maybe 30 minutes. </s>
<s> Then there's the drivers for each of your devices (they will most probably come with driver CDs) Lastly, you might have to change a few BIOS settings like RAM timing, voltage, etc, depending on your hardware. </s>
<s> But none of this is rocket science. </s>
<s> Regarding tech support, well no one's gonna come to your house to fix anything for free(unless you have a techie friend, or pay GeekSquad), but each manufacturer has its own tech support and online forums. </s>
<s> In most cases when something fails to work, they'll send you a replacement if it's still under warranty. </s>
<s> Unless you physically damage something yourself, you're covered. </s>
<s> This is the only partial downside to building it yourself. </s>
<s> Newegg is very good when it comes to RMA (returned merchandise auth) so don't stress out too much about this part. </s>
<s> Now, coming to the case: In order to figure out if it'll hold everything you need, you just need to have a checklist of all your components and go about checking each component against the case and marking them off one by one. </s>
<s> Here are some things you should know: - Internal CD/DVD/Blu Ray Burners (a.k.a. </s>
<s> optical drives) require External 5.25&quot; drive bays - Internal Floppy drives require External 3.5&quot; drive bays - Most Internal media card readers also require 3.5&quot; bays (but maybe 5.25&quot;) - Internal Hard drives require Internal 3.5&quot; bays or racks. </s>
<s> The 7 expansion slots refer to either PCI or PCI-express slots on the Motherboard which will hold your graphics card, sound card, network card, Tv tuner or similar cards. </s>
<s> Just add up the number of slots for these also. </s>
<s> My specs require 2 PCI and 1 PCI-Express slots (1 PCI sound card, 1 PCI TV Tuner, and 1 PCI-Express graphics card) So for each of these components, just add up the total number of drive bays/racks they need. </s>
<s> For example, I have (in my specs) 2 Seagate SATA Hard drives and 2 Optical drives (DVD burners). </s>
<s> This means I need 2 Internal 3.5&quot; bays and 2 External 5.25&quot; bays. </s>
<s> If I put a Floppy drive in, I will also need an External 3.5&quot; bay. </s>
<s> Make sense ? </s>
<s> Yes, the case you selected is a good case, and should fit everything I listed. </s>
<s> The only thing that I'm not 100% sure about is the EVGA 8800 GTX card because it is 10.5 inches in length. </s>
<s> Read reviews about the case and find out if anyone was able (or not able) to put the 8800 GTX card in. </s>
<s> I think this case has enough fans already, but if you feel it's getting hot in there, you can always put more fans in later. </s>
<s> ATX refers to the form factor (size) of the motherboard. </s>
<s> If your motherboard is ATX (which it most probably will be), you're fine. </s>
<s> I hope all this makes sense. </s>
<s> Feel free to ask more questions if you happen to have any. </s>
<s> ciao </s>
<s> You could go for a different architecture and try a PPC or SPARC chip on a mother board. </s>
<s> Everything that is offered to you here is going to be IA32/x86 chip or AMD64/x86_64 chip. </s>
<s> (Intel was cloned by AMD and later Intel cloned AMD's 64 bit system. </s>
<s> There is very little the manufacturer has to do with the processor type.) </s>
<s> What operating system are you going to use? </s>
<s> This will tell you the amount of RAM you need. </s>
<s> Minix3 and Plan9 can be run on 32 megabytes of RAM, sometimes even 16. </s>
<s> The more processes that are running, the more memory that you will need. </s>
<s> A cluttered desktop and multiple programs running- which are not actively nor passively being used- is wasting valuable memory. </s>
<s> How much control do you have over the way the system runs? </s>
<s> Your hardware has to be compatible. </s>
<s> Are you planning on home use, gaming, SOHO, server, pbx, file server, or web server? </s>
<s> It is important that only the drivers you need are loaded into the kernel to prevent bloating. </s>
<s> If you cannot find the driver, one can be written or modified. </s>
<s> How much disk space and what is the layout? </s>
<s> RAID may be a safe idea if you have a home office or a file server. </s>
<s> Do you have a lot of traffic coming in and out, such as clients? </s>
<s> Are you going to run through ethernet, firewire, or usb for this? </s>
<s> Will you have a graphical or non graphical environment? </s>
<s> All of these are important questions that you should ask. </s>
<s> You don't buy a &quot;Dell&quot; or &quot;Gateway&quot; or &quot;Mac&quot; computer. </s>
<s> The architectures are the same. </s>
<s> Apple has switched over to the IA32 and AMD64 architectures. </s>
<s> You buy- and I repeat this- an x86 or AMD 64. </s>
<s> And what if it is duo core? </s>
<s> here. </s>
<s> duo core means two processors. </s>
<s> If each processor is 32bit then your system is really 32 bit. </s>
<s> If each processor is 64bit then your system is 64bit. </s>
<s> Some of the older SPARC based workstations had two chips in it. </s>
<s> Never ask anyone that has only used one architecture to suggest a computer to you. </s>
<s> And never ask anyone who has only used one operating system. </s>
<s> A brand name is not important if you know what you are doing. </s>
<s> You do realize that Apple is using the new EFI system? </s>
<s> Read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Firmware_Interface No Windows PC maker has done that yet. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I use Linux and FreeBSD which is a UNIX variant. </s>
<s> I also use Minix and Plan9, both are UNIX variants also. </s>
<s> Again, no manufacturer makes Windows, they install it. </s>
<s> I only know of IBM, Sun, and HP as being both manufacturers and devlopers of software systems; and, even then, the machines have to have the system installed. </s>
<s> The article points to Linux using this feature since 2000.The feature is not new. </s>
