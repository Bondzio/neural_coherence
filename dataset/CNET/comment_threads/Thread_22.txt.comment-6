Hm..
I believe you can customize the PC's as you wish, so you can upgrade or downgrade the hardrives.
OK, Xeons have a few thingys that make them alot more apt to be used for multiple procssor motherboards.
NOT DUALCORE: TWO PHYSICAL PROCESSORS!
the features inclued some faster memory capabilites, bigger cache, and few security things...
These are usually meant for the servers,as you know, but I can't give a perfect apple to apple compairson...
I have P4 2.8GHz at home, and a Server running TWO physical Xeon processors at 3.00GHz.
The server, is of course faster for many reasons, but its hard to compare those two processors.
Features of Xeon that P4 doesn't have, well, back then: error checking memory, system management features and fast system buses and L2 caches, can hold up to 64GB of memory, tons of management stuff, Hope that helped... -Ibrahim
