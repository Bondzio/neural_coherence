<s> So I just bought a new Macbook aluminum, and I love it. </s>
<s> Unfortunately I'm stuck with dial up for a while. </s>
<s> Should I bother to buy a dial-up modem, and if so what should I buy? </s>
<s> Do they make wireless dial-up modems. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> and buy the $49 Apple USB modem which is guaranteed to work with your system. </s>
<s> Never seen a wireless dial-up modem, but even if they exist, I would expect them to be more expensive than the Apple modem solution. </s>
<s> Good luck P </s>
