motherboards are becoming like hard drives.
there's little difference in performance of the latest generation and almost all are good.
for the amd platform, there are two primary chipsets: nvidia 500 series and amd's 580 & 690. since you didn't mention using dual graphics cards, either chipset will be fine.
then you just need to decide what features you want on the mobo.
here are two good inexpensive mobos.
