Are you sure its in sleep mode?
or hibernate?
when i had this problem with my dv2213cl the support agent told me it was caused by a boot issue, it just would not boot out of hibernate or sleep long story short i had to send the computer to be serviced and they ended up missing the commitment date and i had to end up calling them only to be told that they found nothing wrong with the computer ( but that they were working to fix the problem) well it came back with something that did not need to be fixed and the problem still was the same i had to end up re imaging the hard disk to make it work again to sum it up i was out of a computer for little over a month since it was being fixed by support.. good luck ..
