processor fan and processor on my pc burnt up.
i want to extract data from it to a rental i have until i decide what i will buy.
i cant open the rental to add the hard drives.
i can open my original.
i have a 120g wd and a 40g wd.
is it possible to connect the two pcs and transfer the data?
my burnt one starts and runs xp for about 1-2 min then freezes.
the rental is xp and has all windows updates.
if i boot mine with madboot disk i can locate the files and it will stay operating.
when i load windows and boot normally it freezes.
you can smell it and the fan doesn't turn.
is there a jumper cable i can buy that will let me access my harddrives without booting windows in the source?
if i extract the harddrives, is there a jumper that will connect them to the rental?
the power source on the original still works.
i have a westerndigital data lifeguard tools disk.
any suggestions?
no i don't want to fix my dinosaur.
