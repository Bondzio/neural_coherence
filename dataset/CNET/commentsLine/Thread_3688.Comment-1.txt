can anyone provide some information on wireless cable modems?
do they eliminate the need for a wireless router between the modem and the computer?
any recommendations on a model.
i've seen different reports on motorola's sbg900 and sbg1000.
i need to hook up my existing modem via usb rather than ethernet.
is there any performance difference between a wireless cable modem and a standard cable modem with wireless router.
thanks steve rehmann
