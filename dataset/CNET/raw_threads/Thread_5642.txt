I often come across terms like the following when reading posts concerning broadband, networking and wireless: Routers, bridge, bridge modem, access points, switches and wireless adaptor. What are these, and how, and when, are they conneted with one another ? Yes, I can google for them, but what I can get is often technical. What are they, in layman's language ? I am quite sure a lot of readers of this forum would like simple explainations of the terms. Thanks. christy

To add to the list: half-bridge modem- now what on earth is that ? And what is a router ? or a bridge-router ? or a half-bridge router, if there is such a thing ? It also seems that a dsl modem can be described as a router, but surely they are not the same ? Thanks for any enlightenment ! christy.
