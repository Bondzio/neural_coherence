<s> When I had this machine built they told me I had a front bus of 1320. </s>
<s> Is this the same thing? </s>

<s> Can you reveal why you are looking at these numbers versus performing a benchmark to compare your system? </s>

<s> I see you added a lot of details but what I see is the usual run of the mill Quad Core PC. </s>
<s> These can play games with a good video card but the usual issue is the power supply. </s>
<s> Did you make sure it will support your card? </s>
<s> And no software will check or report this for you. </s>

<s> Bob </s>
<s> The machine was custom built about 6 years ago. </s>
<s> It has a 500 watt power supply and my aaaaaaapc 1500 tells me it is only drawing 90 watts. </s>
<s> what does FSB stand for in CPU-z? </s>
<s> same MB. </s>
<s> Maybe he'll give up the PSU info ....otherwise it could an be a tough road ahead for the new GPU. </s>

<s> Then we run the risk of overtaxing a RAIL. </s>
<s> Look at the stick on the side and get the specs AND THE AGE since PSUs degrade over time. </s>
<s> I try to keep at 50% of any RAIL as well as the total. </s>
<s> Thanks for the APC Watt reading. </s>
<s> You're going to do well! </s>

<s> I think Proffett is messing with you. </s>
<s> But! </s>
<s> It looks like the 333 is probabally Frequency and maybe the 1333 is the chip set. </s>
<s> I really don't know. </s>
<s> I don't have the latest version of CPUZ but mine dose not show Front Side Bus so I am just wild guessing. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
