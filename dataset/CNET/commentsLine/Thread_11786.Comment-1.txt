i'm thinking of getting 2 for my laptop to replace 2-320gb 7200rpm seagate momentus hd's.
supposed to be almost as fast booting as ssd's due to a 4gb flash cache that learns as you use it.
any thoughts or experiences with these?
does it only speed the boot drive?
my second drive is partitioned and contains the windows paging file and some programs and utilities that do load at boot plus a large storage partition.
if xt hybirds are not recomended for non-boot drives i can get a 2.5 inch laptop 750gb @ 7200rpm without the hybird option and get more storage space.
why no 3.5 inch hybirds for desktops?
