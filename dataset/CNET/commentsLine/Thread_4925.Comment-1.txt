hi....i wanted to upgrade my computer, so i need a advice about which one should i buy a amd dual-core processor 3800+, or any intel's dual core processor about a speed of 2.4ghz.. and i wanted some useful opinion that a single core 3.0ghz pentium 4 processor will be good or amd 64 processor (any model speeding to 3.0ghz).
so plz help me in choosing the processors, which one is nice a dual core or a single core, .....thank you
