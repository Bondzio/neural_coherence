I will use this to get VOIP service ( either free or minimal $) for my home as 2nd line for long distance. I will prefer with more hardware features to avoid any tech problem if I have to transfer from one provider to another. My Budget is around $70. I am stuck with HandyTone 286,386 or Sipura 1001,2002. TIA. -from Houston

I strongly recommend the 2100. It is small and it has a built in router. This will save you a lot of headaches. You can find a review on the companies man website http://www.sipura.com/products/spa2100.htm I went to this site http://www.igonet.com/default.aspx?loc=us&pin=12380 and got the 2100 and you can get one month of unlimited calling in North America for around $70 dollars. After that it is only 23.95 a month, check it out. On the flip side if you don't wont to use there voip service cancel and it and keep the router. Win-Win!!!
