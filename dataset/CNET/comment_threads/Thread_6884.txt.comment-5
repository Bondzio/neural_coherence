&quot;The router R should forward that packet to u3 which is destined to u2&quot;, but only if it's a packet from u1!
Otherwise the packet from u3 is sent back to u3 in stead of going to it's destination u2.
So your question is: how to tell that to the router?
That might depend on the specific router.
Did you check the user manual?
Maybe some form of port forwarding is the solution.
