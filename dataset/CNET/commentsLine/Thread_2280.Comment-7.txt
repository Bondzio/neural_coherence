i have no idea how to change any of that, i looked through everything in my bios and i couldn't find anything, i found a hardware diagnostic tool in there, and that didn't help me any.
they probably changed the bios a lot in the last 5 years to make up for things like this, but thats what i get for having a bios that was made over 5 years ago
