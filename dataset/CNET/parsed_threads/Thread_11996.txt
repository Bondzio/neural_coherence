<s> I just bought a new Dell 9100 (haven't hooked it up yet) and I am wondering if I need to install the Norton Firewall software or not. </s>
<s> I am planning on buying the Anti virus, but wonder if I will need the firewall too. </s>
<s> If so is the Norton Security software good enough? </s>
<s> I seen it on Ebay for $25 shipped. </s>
<s> Sorry for the simple question, but I don't know alot about this sort of thing. </s>
<s> I only use dial up if that means anything. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> A firewall is your first line of defense...it helps prevent viruses/trojans from ever being installed on your PC, from running/editing settings/causing problems, and from phoning-home with information it gathered (including usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers). </s>
<s> Antivirus software, while it does help prevent the installing of malware to some degree, is only truly ment to remove the invaders...after the damage may have been done. </s>
<s> While some might say that those on dial-up don't need a firewall, I couldn't disagree more. </s>
<s> While its true that those with &quot;always-on&quot; cable or DSL connections are more vulnerable (you can be invaded faster due to the greater speed, and more frequently, as you're online 24/7), those on dial-up can still be hacked, and ths need protection just like everyone else. </s>
<s> Seven years ago, when I had dialup, I was hacked...right through Norton Internet Security! </s>
<s> I switched to McAfee the next day and never had a problem. </s>
<s> (But I recently dropped McAfee when I found a better alternative.) </s>
<s> Windows XP comes with a built-in firewall, but it is very limited...it only scans incoming data, not outgoing, and doesn't catch nearly as much as third-party software. </s>
<s> Personally, I recommend ZoneAlarm Basic (free). </s>
<s> Then, for antivirus, try Avast Antivirus 4 Home . </s>
<s> Believe it or not, these free programs provide better protection (in my opinion) than Norton, and do not hog system resources like Norton, which, along with McAfee, is known as &quot;bloatware.&quot; Then, of course, you can always upgrade to the Professional versions (like I did) for added protection/features. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, John P.S. </s>
<s> If the software is being sold on Ebay, I'd be a little careful...it may be pirated, damaged, etc. </s>
<s> Just make sure you know the risks prior to bidding. </s>
<s> Unfortunely, you need the firewall. </s>
<s> The good news is, there are *free* firewalls just as good as the commerical types. </s>
<s> They are Kerio, Zonealarm and SysGate to name a few, just google for them. </s>
<s> While Norton's s/w is good, I try to shy away from it as when it starts to puke it tends to cause more problems plus its a resource hog, IMHO. </s>
<s> Up to you, though. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I quit using Norton 2 years ago. </s>
<s> I now use AVG. </s>
<s> You can get the free version. </s>
<s> That's what I started out with but I upgraded to the pay version. </s>
<s> I like it much better than Norton. </s>
<s> I also vote for Zone Alarm over XP firewall. </s>
<s> The XP firewall was probably turned on by default. </s>
<s> but check at Start/Control Panel/Security Center. </s>
<s> When you install Zone Alarm it will turn off the Windows firewall automatically. </s>
