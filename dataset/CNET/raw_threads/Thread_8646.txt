1685	0	399665	3331060	NR	DrKlub	6/30/10 12:47 PM	1.27790202E12	Printer issue	I'm setting up a TLP Zebra 2844-Z on a Windows XP Machine SP3. And I can't get it to print anything. I have it connected to a desktop computer via USB cable. The printer works fine as it will print it's own test lables and it feeds the lables properly. I've tried using a parallel cabel and nothing changed. When I go to &quot;priners and faxes&quot; the printer shows up after I've insalled it. It says &quot;Ready&quot;. I go to print a Windows test page and the the print job is added to the que and sits there. It seems to me to be a communication issue but I don't know where to go from there. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

I find people installing XP without thinking about drivers for the motherboard and what they find is ALL USB printers do that. Be sure to test the printer on another PC as well as another printer on this PC. In short order you'll know which is the problem unit. Bob
