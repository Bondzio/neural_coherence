this seems simple, but i can't figure out how to do it.
i am a math tutor.
i want to be able to tutor online.
this means i want to be able to write equations and graphs freehand and have my students see what i am writing.
and i want to be able to see what they are writing.
i am currently using webcams pointed at paper streaming via skype.
this is ok, but pretty blurry.
it seems that streaming drawings from a graphics tablet or something would be clearer, but i can't figure out the proper hardware/software configuration.
i appreciate any ideas.
thanks, andrew
