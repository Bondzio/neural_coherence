i like seagate drives.
that's because seagate makes them well, and because they have posted a utility that makes it possible to work on them fairly easily if they get off-track.
i'm speaking of &quot;sea-tools.&quot; you can usually get the problem sorted out with that utility.
it also works on maxtor drives.
i like the western digital drives too, but wd's utility is nowhere near as potent and useful as sea-tools.
if we are speaking of bad versions of windows, how about vista?
it is currently making people crazy.
best version of windows?
i like windows 2000 professional for its stability, easy networking capability, and its good looks.
if only it could support the huge hard drives, like windows xp sp1 and sp2 and vista.
