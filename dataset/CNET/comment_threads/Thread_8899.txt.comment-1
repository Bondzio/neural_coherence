Can anyone tell me what the output will be if I add a 1 Watt amplifier to an Engenius EOC-3220 EXT Access Point?
Access Point 400mW Amplifier 1 Watt =1.4 Watt or only 1 Watt?
If I make a wireless bridge with 2 Engenius EOC-3220 EXT APs, 1 Watt booster on both APs, and 24db grid antennas.
Will that bridge work for a distance of 10-14 km?
Have a good line of sight.
Thanks
