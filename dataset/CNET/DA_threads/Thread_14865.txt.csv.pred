1.1.1	Hi there all, I am a beginner in computer building and I want to build my first pc.	St
1.1.2	My budget would be around 750 euro.	St
1.1.3	I will be using the computer mainly for college as I will studying IT.	St
1.1.4	I do not do any gaming as well so a very good graphic card is not needed.	St
1.1.5	Could anyone suggest me a good build for that money?	Ques
1.1.6	I will be buying the parts from digitec.ch.	St
1.1.7	This is what I came up with but since I do not have any idea if these parts work together well, I am a bit scared.	St
1.1.8	Intel Core i7 860 BOX, 2.80 GHz, LGA 1156, 4C/8T Asus P7P55D-E, P55, LGA1156, CFX, SATA-3, USB 3 Corsair TW3X4G1333C9A, 2x2GB, DDR3-1333, CL9@1.5V Samsung HD103SJ, F3, 7200rpm, 32MB, 1TB, SATA-II LG GH22LS, 22x DVDR Brenner, LS, SATA, schwarz Antec EarthWatts 750 Watt, Umweltfreundlich, RoHS Cooler Master Sileo RC-500-KKN1-GP - black MSI HD 4670 1GB GDDR3, PCI-E x16 2.0, HDMI	St
1.2.1	any hard choices, I'd look at the actual buyer product reviews at Newegg.com.	St
1.2.2	The other thing is... you may be getting a little too much PSU.	St
1.2.3	Having 'reserve power or 'power to grow' is good but 750W seems a little much given the proposed equipment and use.	St
1.2.4	A good quality 600-650W by a quality mfg like Corsair should be more than enough PSU.	St
1.2.5	VAPCMD	St
