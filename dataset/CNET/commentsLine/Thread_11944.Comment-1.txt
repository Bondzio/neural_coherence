hi, i have been trying to connect my laptop (windows vista) and my netbook (windows 7) with a crossover cable, and i have followed every single step of the instructions i have found on the net, including disabling windows firewall, but it won't do it and when i try to ping the failure seems to be when the netbook tries to ping the laptop (100% loss).
any advice?
what could the problem be?
thank you!
