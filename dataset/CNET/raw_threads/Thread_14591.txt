I do mostly B/W printing (200 pages/week) with just text, but I do print about 100 color prints a week that have minimal coverage and contain mostly text with a couple simple graphics. I want a MFP for fax and scanning/copying and I want to be able to scan straight to my PC. Right now I'm leaning towards the Xerox 6180mfp. I'm looking to spend between $700-$1000 after taxes and shipping and this falls in that range and appears to do everything I need. My only concern is that some people have mentioned some concern about the job life of the toner and that it is kind of pricy to replace. Not sure if that would affect me since I'm not utilizing the color all that much. Any other printers that are comparable I should look at or any feedback on the 6180. Thanks for reading. -David

I like Brother personally. Good high capacity cartridges (find one that takes the TN580, like the MFC-8460 or 8860)) 2. Get a color inkjet printer for the few pages of color you need. HP has some good ones, but look for printers that take the 74/75 or 96/97, as those you can refill yourself, if you want, get replacements on the web or at local stores. This way if one of them fails, you still have a back up printer. Plus it can save you some money.

The Brother 9840 has an astonishingly high percentage of happy users (18 out of 19 5-stars - at Amazon, I think.) I did find one review at Government Computer News that suggested the layout of the physical plant leads to accidental popping open of the paper tray door, which would drive me crazy. The same review gave top marks to the Okidata 5550, which has the advantage of having a straight paper path; however I can't find any user reviews on this unit. Maybe somebody will give you some more input. The one caveat I have run across for the Xerox units is that since they use solid ink, 1) it smells like melted crayons while they're running, and 2) if color prints get folded, the &quot;ink&quot; flakes off.

My girlfriend's color printer might work for me or I'll go spend $100-$200 on one. Thanks for the input.
