On the power and range issue they are pretty much the same. The maximum transmission power is limited by the government so this also limits the range. This means that most routers will get exactly the same coverage. All the other features is why there are so many routers. In general I would stay with a larger manufacture just so you can get help from others who have similar routers but that still leave a lot of choice. If you can afford it I would buy a DUAL band router since those are the most flexible. At least buy a N router since they only cost slightly more than G and support both N and G. Last I would look for a router that has external antenna that can be removed and upgraded. Many people find these routers ugly but putting larger antenna on is the only way to increase the coverage of a router. Some countries it is not legal to put larger antenna on the router. The other difference between routers are feature you must decide if you need. Some people need VPN and others need firewall features to limit their children surfing so its very hard to make a general recommendation.
