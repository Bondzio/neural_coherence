I would wait, and get a PCI express motherboard.
You will not be making a bad choice.
Newer games are coming out, and then you may want to get (Microsoft Vista).
By waiting you will not regret it, that is what I intend on doing.
But what you are doing now is good asking questions, I did that for over a year before I built my first.
Good Luck Wendell H
