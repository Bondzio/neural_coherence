You need a program that can encode AVI to DVD, then burn the resulting files to a DVD disc. A bit of searching will find you any number of these, but AVI2DVD is a good freeware program: http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Avi2Dvd Hope that helps!

It isn't doing the job though. When attempting the burning, it will progress to 99.2 percent and then ejects the disc with error &quot;not able to complete&quot;.
