Well, I wish I had a different drive.
I ghosted my old drive to the emachines installed drive (Seagate 160MB) and now I get a hal.dll missing error when the PC boots up.
I tried just copying the new hal.dll overwriting the hal.dll but no luck.
Should of expected this.
I don't want to do a new install of Windows because I don't have the disks and don't have CD's for most of my apps.
I tried editing the boot.ini file but no luck there either.
Any suggestions?
