Why throw it away when you may be able to recover the drive?
According to this article - http://www.usbtalk.net/2009/09/recovering-broken-unformattable-and-ghost-usb-flash-drives/ - it may be possible to fix your problem as long as the drive is still lighting up when you plug it in.
Give it a shot, may work, just be sure to follow the instructions well cause it warns running both programs at once can cause damage, so be careful!
