Good day I am trying to connect a computer to my network and this is the problem.
The lan cable I have is too short to reach the dsl router that I have and was wondering if I could do one of two things and if I can how to do it.
Maybe I can do neither but here is my thought.
First way: I have a d-link model DI-524 so could I plug in the cable from my dsl modem to the d-link wan plug and then run a cable to the computer, or Second way: I have 2 built in lan ports on my Asus P6T-Deluxe so could I run a lan cable from the second lan port to the other computer.
I have long enough cable to do either one of these, just don't know if it will work.
Any help would be appreciated.
I really don't want to string another cable through if I don' have to.
Thanks Sean Hope this is clear and enough info.
