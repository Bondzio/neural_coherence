Looking at the specs page which repeats the same info but appears to offers that the PMCMIA slot will accept the adapter.
That means, it will accept the same cards found for laptops(older PCMIA), further you get one that accepts flash data cards on the adpater.
That way you dump your music files/chords, etc.
to be saved.
In all likelihood don't get a flash card bigger than 2gb(guessing), but if you get an adapter any similar smaller Mb/Gb data capacity will work to test it.
So look at laptop PCMIA adapters that provide flash ports on the adapter.
Just visit any decent online laptop website to get an idea of adapters out there.
