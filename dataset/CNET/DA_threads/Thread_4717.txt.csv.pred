1.1.1	Hello , I need to find a way to password-protect an external hard drive in a way that is cross-platform compatible , AND find a way to add meta data or tags to the files on that hard drive that are also cross-platform searchable .	St
1.1.2	I have been digging around the internet looking for a solution for a day now , here 's what I 've tried and the issues I 've run into : 1 ) TrueCrypt comes up as a suggestion a lot .	St
1.1.3	Nice because it 's cross-platform compatible ( downside being that it must be installed on any machine you want to access files from ) .	St
1.1.4	The downside is that there is some bug between Windows Search and TrueCrypt such that files on the encrypted drive do n't show up in search results ( I did find a thread somewhere with a very complicated workaround for this , but I 'd rather avoid it ) .	St
1.1.5	2 ) Folder Lock - nice because it allows you to just password protect without encryption ( I 've seen a bunch of threads that say & quot ; But you really need encryption for security ! & quot ; - I 'm not concerned about anyone attempting to hack or steal the data , the need for a password is a formality I have to meet , do n't need to go into the details ) , and it runs from a .exe stored on the external drive , so you do NOT need Folder Lock installed on a machine to access the file .	St
1.1.6	The problem here is that Mac 's do n't run .exes so there goes my cross-platform compatibility .	St
1.1.7	While I 'm at it , I need some way to add these tags to video files - would be great if they would then show up in the native Mac and Windows OS search applications without some third party software .	St
1.1.8	In Windows I can right click a media file , go to Properties - & gt ; Details and add tags that are recognized in Windows search ( unless they 're on an encrypted TrueCrypt drive ) , but I do n't believe they show up in Mac .	St
1.1.9	Any suggested solutions ( preferably something simple , like another program besides TrueCrypt or Folder Lock that will do all this and not a complicated workaround ) would be greatly appreciated .	St
1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	That new guideline about hard disk encryption for workers with medical information .	St
1.2.3	2 .	St
1.2.4	Folk that forgot about security and computers .	St
1.2.5	The old physical security rule .	St
1.2.6	But any system you create and see out there mandates changes to the OS to give you what you are asking for .	St
1.2.7	So is the pain worth the trouble as well as what happens when the drive gets a little corrupted or you lose the password ?	Ques
1.2.8	Most folk forget about these issues and lose thousands to have the data recovered .	St
