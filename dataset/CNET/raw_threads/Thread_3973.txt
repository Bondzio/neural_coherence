My Windows XP Pro shuts down fine...but instead of the computer shutting off it reboots from the initial black screen we all see at start which give you your primary master/slave and secondary master/slave read outs and tells you to &quot;delete&quot; in order to enter the Bios. Also my power button does not work. How can I correct this ?

The 'press delete' message comes from the BIOS during POST so you can change the settings in the BIOS (i.e. boot sequence). It's supposed to be there. If, however, this just started, XP's power management sub-system may be corrupted. Fix: reinstall XP. Or the BIOS may be corrupted. Fix: reinstall BIOS from manufacturer. If none of this helps, maybe it's time to replace the whole machine. You should be able to salvage a reasonable chunck of the old, and I do mean OLD, system. and life goes on... Jack
