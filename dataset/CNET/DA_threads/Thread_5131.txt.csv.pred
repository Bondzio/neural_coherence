1.1.1	I have a HP pavilion Intel ( R ) Celeron ( R ) CPU 2.93 GHz 248 MB of RAM.My computer is like 3 years old and it is giving me a few problems , for instance I can download a file but when it is time to install I get an error message : can not install ascess denied.Also if I leave my computer on for to long it will restart for no reason and I am having problems with broken images and my virtual memory gets low real fast.Also I like to game and most of the games out there like half life freezes on me when I try to play it.Should I upgrade ( if so how ? )	Ques

1.2.1	You could do a spyware scan using these tools : http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-6132-0.html ? forumID=32 & threadID=1313 & start=0 Or for a real cure backup any files you do n't want to loose and do a clean install of your OS , XP I hope .	St
1.2.2	Adding more memory would also speed things up .	St
