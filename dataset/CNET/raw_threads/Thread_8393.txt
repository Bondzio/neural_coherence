I made the mistake of choosing to try Zone Alarm Pro when I recently got an automatic update of the program, which I'd been using for quite some time. When the trial period expired, I decided to go back to the freebie version. I'm pretty sure the prompts said it would remember all the settings. It did not. Each internet-related program had to be re-allowed as I launched them. No problem there. However... Networking is another thing. I've never been real savvy with networking. I have 3 other computers on my home network, and they can no longer access my main desktop (the one I've re-installed Zone Alarm on.) I can't for the life of me remember how to configure ZA and add a local network to the trusted zone. I can see where that is done in the program, and I can see how to add an individual IP address, and a range of IP addresses, and a subnet and all that...but I don't remember how the local network was entered. Is it a &quot;range of IP addresses,&quot; or is it a &quot;subnet&quot;...and where do I find the data to enter into the appropriate spaces? I've done searches on the internet, but come up with little help. Evidently I did this at one point, because I've had this network in place and running for quite some time. I am using a Linksys wireless ap/router (physically connected to this computer) for my home network. Thanks, Rag

You'll have to reveal if the DHCP address is valid. If it's 192.168, then you can reveal the details here since that's a non-public IP... Bob

See, it's just that kind of talk (reveal if the DHCP address is valid) that makes me feel like an idiot! I can only tell you at this point that if I open look at the ZA &quot;zones&quot; on the other three computers (yes, I have it installed on all of the systems) there is an &quot;adapter subnet&quot; that does, indeed, start with 192.168 They seem to be associated with the wireless adapters on those computers. On the &quot;main&quot; computer (the desktop I have re-installed ZA on, and which is the one that is actually connected physically to the Linksys) there is a listing for a Realtec Fast ethernet NIC. (Could this be the built-in Ethernet adapter?) Sorry I am such a dummy when it comes to networking stuff.

Seem close, but you didn't reveal the rest of the numbers. Netmask, and more. It's not a public IP so there are no jewels at risk. Another nugget to get network sharing to work is that the firewalls of XP are &quot;off&quot; and that the WORKGROUP names are the same. If you can't share, I have to leave you to read http://www.wown.com and http://www.practicallynetworked.com It's also very important that Zone Alarm be uninstalled or again, I can't help... Bob

And, yes, Zone alarm has since been uninstalled from the main desktop. That is the PC on which I had changed the installation of the program and which is physically connected to the Linksys AP\Router. One other Desktop on the network is physically connected via ethernet cable to the router. The other two are notebooks and they are networked via WiFi wireless. On main desktop is only one entry, as follows: Name: Realtek RTL 8139 Family PCI Fast Ethernet NIC - packet scheduler miniport IP Address/Site: 192.168.1.100/255.255.0 Entry Type: Adapter Subnet Zone: Internet ----------------------------------- On the other Desktop are two entries: Name: SMC1211 Series NDIS 5.1 Driver IP Address/Site: 192.168.1.108/255.255.0 Entry Type: Adapter Subnet Zone: Trusted Name: PPP Adapter IP Address/Site: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 Entry Type: Adapter Subnet Zone: Trusted ---------------------------------- On Notebook 1, two entries: Name: Instant Wireless Network PC Card V3.0 IP Address/Site: 192.168.1.106/255.255.0 Entry Type: Adapter Subnet Zone: Trusted Name: PPP Adapter IP Address/Site: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 Entry Type: Adapter Subnet Zone: Trusted ---------------------------------- On Notebook 2, two entries Name: Broadcom 440x 10/100 Integrated Controller - Packet Scheduler Miniport IP Address/Site: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 Entry Type: Adapter Subnet Zone: Internet Name: WLAN 802.11g Network Adapter - Packet Scheduler Miniport IP Address/Site: 192.168.1.102/255.255.0 Entry Type: Adapter Subnet Zone: Trusted Thanks, Rag

You have a firewall of sorts in the router. For now, you can toss Zone Alarm out until the network is back up and working. If you don't then that's your choice. Bob
