question: ready for solid-state drive, but long-term reliability has me worried now that solid-state drives are coming down in price, i am thinking of swapping the hard drive i have in my laptop for a 256 gb solid-state drive.
however, i have read in the past that these drives use flash technology and this technology is only good for a large but finite number of write requests before it starts to fail.
since some files, such as swap space, are used pretty heavily, is long-term reliability going to be an issue?
based on this concern, are there any instances when an ssd isn't recommended?
also, are there any performance specs that we should consider while choosing a solid-state drive?
thanks for any suggestions.
