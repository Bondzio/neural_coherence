7590	0	126517	1431587	NR	MrRugger	9/20/05 2:30 PM	1.1272266E12	Old PC - Looking for Video Card	Hi All, I have a 4.5 year old PC. 1 Ghz AMD Thunderbird processor, with 762mg RAM and a 64mb Guillemot KyroII based video card, and ASUS A7V motherboard which supports only USB 1.1 and is AGP 4X. Yes poor me. But it does all the basics well, even some older games no problem (ie: Battlefield 1942). I'm basically not looking to update my entire system yet as it still works well. Maybe in another 2 years. So I want to squeeze everything I can out of the current system. I'm thinking about buying a new video card which supports AGP 4x. Ie: the older Radeon 9550 cards or competing FX 9550. I'm hoping the jump from 64mb to 128mb (or 256mb depending on manufacturer) and 128 bit will help me out when working with PhotoShop doing video rendering or playing some games. Any suggestions ? Other products I should look at ? Again the goal is to make an upgrade with my current PC without killing the budget and replacing it. Thanks.

7590	2	126517	1432164	1431587	101Ares	9/20/05 6:43 PM	1.12724178E12	ok.. a few things	a 9550 dose not go near thee performace of a 5950 a 9550 is more like a fx 5600 maybe 5600 ultra ozos always being very intelegent i would go with the 5500 yet hat is still considered budget so a 5600 may be more suitable so u get the cinefx2.0 (thats what it is right) and other junk. a safe older performace card is 5700 yet dont worry i played battlefield 2 on a 5200 (64meg) useing 4x agp in a notebook on low settings no lag. this is just a few notes.

If you can stretch for it, that would make a sparkling improvement. Whatever you go for, try and avoid the XT from Nvidia or the SE from ATI, these are cut down brain damaged versions of the full card (although either would blow a kyro out of the water!). Just to be awkward, the XT from ATI is the cooking version!!! good luck
7590	5	126517	1432823	1432671	101Ares	9/21/05 3:57 AM	1.12727502E12	sorry about that	I just wanted to say I would go with a 5600, or a 5700. This becaue the other cards dont have any nice features compared. And yes I can play Battlefield 2 on a FX go5200 (64meg) on low settings no lag.
7590	6	126517	1432944	1432733	MrRugger	9/21/05 5:41 AM	1.12728126E12	Nvidia or ATI	Thanks for everyone's input. My budget is max $150 cdn. So that limits me to the following cards. Radeon 9550GE/TD 128 bit (128mb or 256mb, depending on manufacturer costs = $85-$129). Nvidia FX5500 OC with 128 bit (128/256mb costs=$129) or Nvidia FX5600 (cost=$169). Finally, Radeon 9600XT 128mb and 9600 128mb both on sale this week (the XT version is $149 the 9600 is $119). Is the consensues to go with the 9600 if I already have firewire on my pc (for video editing) ??? I believe the XT chip is the same, only video in is the difference. Comments ? thks.
