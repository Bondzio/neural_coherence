My son has a rather new Gateway with a celeron processor, 256 RAM and running Won XP home.
Very little has been added - a file sharing program of course.
It ran pretty fast out of the box, but is now slow - even opening the control panel is slow.
I don't think a celeron should run slow like this, but who knows.
We have defragmented, all windows updates are current and same for Norton Anti-Virus.
Anyone have any tips for speeding this thing up?
