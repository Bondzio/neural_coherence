<s> This is a silly question but I am new to the graphics card world. </s>
<s> On Nvidia's driver download section there's the selection for GeForce Go 7800 GTX driver and regular GeForce drivers. </s>
<s> Since I have a 7800 GT, can I still use the GTX driver or should I click on regular GeForce driver? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> the Go driver is for the new high-end gaming laptops that use a special GO chipset </s>
