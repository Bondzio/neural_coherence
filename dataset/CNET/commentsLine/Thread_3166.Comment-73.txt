my friend has been in the it field over 20 years, internal hard drives he says last about 5 years, so except for the lack of heat witch i don't know if that causes internal hard drives not to last as long?so i would give a educated guess of 5 years.i wonder if ssd drives will last at least 2 times as long because of now moving parts?
