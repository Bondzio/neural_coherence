It was actually .01 volts and .11 volts..
So I put everything back together and the computer started up and the right voltages are there 5 and 12. this time... hmm...
But I still have to manually turn the fan for the power supply, so could this issue have possibly have caused the PS to go intermittently bad?
It also is not booting up all the way.
ok I hear the HHD spinning, but there is no Display.
I don't know where to go with this now.
