Hello everyone ...
I'm in Egypt and I'm about to buy an ipod with a very good price The problem is that I'll go to canada after a month and I think I will live the rest of my life there ...
So I want to ask about the power doch which come with the new ipod , Does it work with 220v and 110v ??
or when I buy the ipod from egypt (which will support 220v for sure) it will not support the 110v (in canada ) So is there anybody can help me with this ???
Thanx anyway ,,
