i didn't know where the parallel port was but a long time ago i remember having to set the mode and on a few lava epp pci boards you had to set the i/o address as well.
as you know, the addresses for lpt 1, 2 and 3 are carved in silicon but as time went on, they could move.
however i found old software hardcoded rather than picking up the address from a bios api call.
good to read.
