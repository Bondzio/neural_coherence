Unfortunately, the Intel integrated graphics (82845 G\GL\GV) is only recognized as &quot;standard VGA graphics&quot; which only allows the monitor to run at 800x600 resolution. I've looked for an updated driver without success. Anybody know where I could find one or know any other tricks to fix this problem? Thanks, J-Law

However i am also getting a resolution problem, it will not allow the resolution to be increased to 1024x756 and wont let the colour to go up to 32bit. I have attempted to download several drivers, vista says it is up to date, intel drivers will not install becuase they say the system is not supported,ie vista. and a dell driver had no effect. Fter several restarts vista has not 'recognised' and changed it... Help would be appreciated. On xp the graphics chip was known as an intel chip but now they only information i can get it that it is a standard VGA graphics adapter. I believe it is: Intel 82845G Graphics Controller. Thanks

Anyways, you could try installing the driver under compatibility mode. To do this, right click the icon, click properties then goto the &quot;Compatibility&quot; tab in the properties windows and check the box and select &quot;Windows XP.&quot; That might help. I'm not sure, but anyways, there ya go.

It recognizes the drivers and installs them but then cannot install soft bios drivers. I am still running on 640x480. If anybody can figure out about the soft bios thing please help. @Law_John: How did you install the drivers. I really want Vista to work because I bought Ultimate...

Same controller and adapter and platform (softBIOS).I got vista home edition and now I only get 16 bit and 640x480. I can't play any games or even view things right. I really hope we get this solved one day. I've been looking all over and I don't think intel's site has been updated since 95 so forget those guys. I don't know but if I do ill post what I find. -The group of heroes must fight their way to the top of a steep and ominous mountain, in hopes that its peek will hold the answers to their video problems...

If you notice, some words in red ask for such things so to avoid extra back and forths. This is your choice to share or not. It appears this controller is not for Vista but try the XP driver in case it works. Bob
