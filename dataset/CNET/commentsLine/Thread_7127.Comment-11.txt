even in their prime, socket a machines could be finicky.
today, some 6 to 10 years later we refuse socket a machines at the service desk.
yes we could make a bundle taking them in for &quot;diagnosis&quot; but that would not be cool.
what you need to do is keep collecting these or just get a freecycled p3 or p4 that works.
you are not doing anything wrong here.
these are just problematic, failing old machines.
