I have a PC, running XP, that has a dual head S-VGA video card.
It came with a cable which splits it to two VGA outs.
So I comfortably run two monitirs at a decent relolution.
One goes to a projector, the other to my monitor.
Cool beans.
Now I have a need for an additional s-video out (carrying the same signal as the projector), which goes to a video switcher, and ultimately to a DVD recorder.
What is the simplest way to accomplish this?
I have an older ALL-IN-Wonder card that could be installed at no cost, but will XP allow that?
