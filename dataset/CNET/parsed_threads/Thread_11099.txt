<s> I came home yesterday a my comp was off, it was on when I left. </s>
<s> Now it will not turn on at all. </s>
<s> I took the cover off and when I push the power button all the fans spin for a second and then stop. </s>
<s> There is a green led on the mobothat is on, but nothing else happens. </s>
<s> Is the PSU shot? </s>
<s> Is there anything else I can check? </s>
<s> Thanks Sean </s>
<s> Sounds like a PSU failure, pretty simple fix, suggest replacing with something of a heavier capacity than the original. </s>
<s> Type BAD CAPS at google.com and see if your machine has them. </s>
<s> I put in a new PSU rated 100 watts more than what was in there and the caps are definitely good. </s>
<s> Any other ideas. </s>
<s> Thanks for the replies. </s>

<s> After taking out all ram, cards etc. </s>
<s> I discovered 3 blown caps on one of the video cards, removed the card and computer boots fine. </s>
<s> On the other vid card 1 cap is very slightly leaking but comp still works. </s>
<s> Any idea what would have caused this? </s>
<s> Could the old psu caused this? </s>
<s> I answered &quot;Any idea what would have caused this?&quot; above. </s>
<s> Type BAD CAPS on google.com and you find pictures and why this happened. </s>
<s> You also find these parts found their way into not only motherboards but power supplies and cards. </s>
