<s> Hello, thank you in advance for checking this discussion out and trying to help me. </s>
<s> My question is, which of the following setting is better for gaming: 1)an AMD 3800+ dual core with 2gb DDR 400mhz and a 7800 gt oc =or= 2)an Intel 830 3.0Ghz dual core with 2gb DDR2 667mhz and a 7800 gt oc Thanks in advance Cheers P.S. </s>
<s> I know that intel has a faster clock speed, but since AMD has a different archeitecture, sometimes AMD ends up faster than intel, this is why i am asking this question even though Intel has a faster clock speed. </s>
<s> :P </s>
<s> I say setup 2 because because newer RAM is there. </s>
<s> DDR2 is better than DDR. </s>
<s> It has been proven that the 3800+ is better for gaming than the Intel 830, but since that Intel has DDR2, I'll go with #2. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> DDR isn't that much worse, plus due to benchmarks i'd go AMD all the way. </s>
<s> Go pick yourself up a nice AMD system. </s>
<s> I would. </s>
<s> Plus, DDR2 is limited by latency in any case. </s>
<s> I'd go for the better processor myself. </s>
<s> Processor = power, you can go ddr 2 later but atm nothing is gonna beat it. </s>
<s> if DDR2 has a faster mhz, how can it have a high latency (for example 5-5-5-10) while DDR has a lower mhz, but lower latency (for example 3-4-4-8), i know DDR has a lower latency, but how does it work? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
