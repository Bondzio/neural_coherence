<s> Good Day to All I have a printer (Canon iP 5300) and the printer overall works fine. </s>
<s> But as soon as I try to print on a Disc, using the CD Tray, I can't seem to print in black. </s>
<s> I started from scratch, and made a monochrome Picture, which is either black or white, and when I print the Picture using CD Label Print supplied by Canon, it prints Cyan(blue) instead of Black. </s>
<s> I tried selecting &quot;Print in GrayScale&quot; but it still comes out blue. </s>
<s> I contacted Canon about this, and I'm still waiting for an answer. </s>
<s> I updated all the drivers and software, And I tried installing the Printer on a Mac OS X Desktop, and from that I'm still getting only Blue. </s>
<s> When I print on an A4 Page, then it can print Black, but simply not on the Discs. </s>
<s> Can anyone assist me by telling me if there is something I'm missing, or if this printer is capable of printing black on Discs. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance </s>
<s> I'm having the same issue. </s>
<s> Were you able to resolve what the problem was? </s>
<s> I have same problems with my MP610. </s>
<s> I think it's the problem in cartbridgs, becous when I was using original Canon colors it was ok. </s>
<s> But now with other cartbridge bradn it prints cyan insted of black :s Tried on the same dvd-brand (verbatim printable) Funy is that other colors are ok only black is problem. </s>
<s> On paper is evrything fine. </s>
<s> If any one have a clue what is the reason pleas write me: rok.dezo[AF]gmail.com </s>
<s> I have been trying to print with my remaining big black C3 cartridge on CD/DVD media with Canons CD-Labelprint using my Canon ip5000. </s>
<s> It has never succeeded. </s>
<s> Not even with a brand new cartridge. </s>
<s> I think it could be due to the fact that when printing and choosing printer properties I get a limited set of choices. </s>
<s> There is a selection with a drop down list called &quot;BJ Cartridge&quot; which is limited to only one item on the list: COLOR. </s>
<s> I suppose it will then use all available cartridges except the big black C3 cartridge. </s>
<s> That, I suppose, is the reason the disk comes out just as white as it was before attempting to print on it... </s>
