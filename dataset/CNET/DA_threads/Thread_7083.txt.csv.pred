1.1.1	Suddenly HD would not boot ... goes & quot ; tick , tick , tick & quot ; trying ; then I get a message that I must boot with a CD .	St
1.1.2	I replaced the 14 month old 80 GB Western Digital HD ... reloaded XP Pro and my computer is up and running .	St
1.1.3	But I lost all data on the original HD ...	St
1.1.4	I am wondering if the problem could be only a virus that I might be able to correct somehow ?	Ques
1.1.5	Or since it sounds like an electro-mechanical problem , do I just have to send the HD off to a data recovery company at some terrific expense ?	Ques
1.1.6	Yep , I am intent upon being more careful to back up data from now on .	St
1.2.1	The tick-tick-tick sound is a typical failed drive .	St
1.2.2	Data recovery is usually under 1000 dollars at the usual Drive Savers or Ontrack and is only considered when backup is non-existant or files must be retrieved .	St
1.2.3	Back of what you ca n't lose has never been cheaper .	St
1.2.4	DVD recorders are now under 100 bucks and you go over 4GB on on disk .	St
1.2.5	Most of us can put our pictures and files on just a few of these .	St
1.2.6	In closing , it 's not a virus issue , but just one of learning that hard disks are temporary storage .	St
1.2.7	They can last about 5 years .	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	zzjones , Maybe not , In New drive create a folder named & quot ; Old Drive & quot ; Then & gt ; Slave your old drive to the new one .	St
1.3.2	& gt ; Go to Windows Explorer & gt ; If you can see your old drive & gt ; copy My Documents and Program Files to & quot ; Old Drive Folder & quot ; Do not attempt to find your files until after they are on the new drive .	St
1.3.3	After you have retrived the files you need Old Drive folder can be deleted .	St
1.3.4	You may only get one shot at this .	St
1.3.5	And it may not work but worth a try .	St
1.3.6	Bill Comments welcomed	St
1.4.1	Your old hard drive is damaged .	St
1.4.2	To recover data , you need the services of a hard drive technician , it could be a lens alignment problem , mechanical problem , but surely not virus related .	St
1.4.3	Doing so ( data recovery procedure ) will really cost you a lot especially if you have important files in it , it will be wiser to send the hard drive to the manufacturer , they know what to do with their hard drives .	St
