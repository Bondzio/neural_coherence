1.1.1	I have a Dell Inspiron 8600 running Windows XP SP2 with a TSSTcorp DVD+RW TS-L632D optical drive installed .	St
1.1.2	This is a replacement for a similar NEC drive .	St
1.1.3	When I insert a CD or a DVD , the drive thinks it is a new blank disc .	St
1.1.4	This is the same behavior that caused me to replace the NEC drive .	St
1.1.5	The drive is able to write files to the disc .	St
1.1.6	Occasionally , if I go to the device manager and inspect the drive 's properties , the drive will start spinning very fast and if I then double click the drive 's icon in My Computer , it will read the files .	St
1.1.7	This is what I have tried so far : Windows reinstall repair ( booting from the DVD ! )	Ques
1.1.8	Uninstalling the drive and rebooting .	St
1.1.9	Uninstalling CloneDVD and rebooting .	St
1.1.10	It 's not a dirty lens or a failing drive since both drives exhibit the same behavior .	St
1.1.11	I think I 've stumped every Dell technician in New Delhi ( and they have really tried to solve this ) .	St
1.1.12	Any suggestions would be much appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	Removed the usual registry entries named UPPERFILTERS and LOWERFILTERS ?	Ques
1.2.2	If you do n't know what these are or if your Dell support did n't do this there is some hope .	Ques
1.2.3	Cheers , Bob	St
1.3.1	Wow , thanks for the prompt reply !	Polite
1.3.2	I checked HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Control/Class/ { 4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318 } and found no UpperFilter or LowerFilter entries .	St
1.3.3	I believe the techs did remove those when they were trying to fix the problem .	St
1.3.4	I also checked ControlSet002 and ControlSet003 under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM just in case they are relevant .	St
1.3.5	They had no filter entries either .	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	I have n't found a ControlSet001 , only CurrentControlSet , 002 , and 003 .	St
1.6.1	Looks to be there .	St
1.6.2	Next time just search for UPPERFILTERS and share what keys you find as well as the LOWERFILTERS ones .	St
1.6.3	Since no 2 windows machines are the same , you get to help us help you .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	Had the same prob they are right try to remove the upper and lower filters But it kept coming back to me ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	St
1.7.2	I found out that the back up feature of norton 360 was causing it , I have since stopped using the back up and it had never happened again	St
1.8.1	When I searched on UpperFilters , I came across numerous entries for other devices and then came across an entry in the following key : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet002\Enum\CdRom_NEC_DVD+RW_ND-5100A___________10AC____\5 & 1517b2fe & 0 .	St
1.8.2	I 'm not sure how many underscores are in the key name .	St
1.8.3	If I try to delete the UpperFilters entry here I get an error message box titled & quot ; Error Deleting Values & quot ; with the message & quot ; Unable to delete all specified values. & quot ; I also found an UpperFilters entry under the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet002\Control\Class\ { 4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318 } .	St
1.8.4	This was the key that the Dell tech asked me to look in along with ControlSet001 and ControlSet002 .	St
1.8.5	I thought that I had deleted it but it was there .	St
1.8.6	I 've deleted it and will now restart and see if it made any difference .	St
1.9.1	After rebooting , the first data CD I put in was read correctly .	St
1.9.2	After that , it went back to the same old behavior thinking every disc I put in was blank .	St
1.9.3	I rechecked the registry but the UpperFilter entries were still gone .	St
1.9.4	I think I may be ready to reinstall Windows .	St
1.9.5	Is that my best course of action at this point ?	Ques
1.10.1	How old ?	Ques
1.10.2	How long since you used a CD/DVD lens cleaner ?	Ques
1.10.3	Be aware that many would rather reload the OS ten times than replace a possibly bad drive .	St
1.10.4	I ca n't figure out why .	St
1.10.5	Bob	St
1.11.1	I purchased a replacement drive at Dell 's suggestion and it displays the same symptoms .	St
1.11.2	I do n't think it is the drive .	St
1.11.3	Also , When I did a repair reinstall of Windows the computer read the CD just fine .	St
1.12.1	You did n't tell .	St
1.12.2	Also I ca n't tell what CD/DVD software you use .	St
1.12.3	Some is out of date ( or you have the Norton ) or you have some combo of software that is toxic .	St
1.12.4	Such details are not here .	St
1.12.5	Bob	St
1.13.1	I am running Norton Security Center , but I do n't use it for backups .	St
1.13.2	For that I use Bounce Back by CMS .	St
1.13.3	I used to use Easy CD Creator Platinum 5 but it started causing an error some months ago and I no longer attempt to use it .	St
1.13.4	However , I have n't yet uninstalled it .	St
1.13.5	I also recently tried out CloneDVD but it did n't meet my needs so I uninstalled it .	St
1.13.6	Any clues there ?	Ques
1.13.7	Robert	St
1.14.1	If you want to test it , do your repair install and carefully test when it breaks by using said software titles .	St
1.14.2	Then complain to that title 's maker for an update .	St
1.14.3	Bob	St
