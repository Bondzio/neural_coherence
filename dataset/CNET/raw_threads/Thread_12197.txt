The best s/w to do this is called, &quot;Laplink&quot; which also includes the cable. Older Laplink s/w ver. will do fine, it seems too many bells and whisltes are part of the s/w now and but check to be sure it will handle your OS. Win98 and above offer MS own &quot;DCC&quot; s/w whcih does basically the same thing but very basic and that's OK for most users. That's installed from the OS install CD from the add/remove s/w icon. You still need the laplink type cable parallel or serial links as required. The IrDA is &quot;infared connection&quot; ability. That's also possible if goping that route, but it can be complex at times. good luck -----Willy
