i would check the following: remove everything but the video card memory and hard drive.
if still nothing i would check memory, video card.
if you don't have a way to do that then reset the cmos on your motherboard.
if your video card is giving you a blank screen it could also be a bent pin on the video cable.
but, always have a pci video card around to dotesting and if that boots that tells you your motherboard is fine.
i think memory, video card then motherboard.
sometimes your power supply can be failing too but it woun't stop you from getting a picture.
the 9000 ati's also require you power them up.
check that too.
good luck!
