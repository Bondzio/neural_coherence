I am running WIN ME, 512 DDR, and 64 bit video card. can anyone tell me what all these exclamation marksmean and how to fix these? I have gone into the BIOS but i dont see anything there that looks out of the ordinary. please help. if possible, you can email me at zena3546@aol.com. Thank you.

If so and with a little luck if you place it in your cd reader unit it will auto play and present you with a nice menu to load the mobo drivers. If you can do that then many if not all of those exclamation marks will go away. Be aware that the drivers on the cd may be quite old so a trip to the mobo makers site to check for updates would be a good thing to do.
