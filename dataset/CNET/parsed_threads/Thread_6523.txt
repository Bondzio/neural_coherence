<s> I have a desktop running XP Home connected via ethernet cable to a Microsoft MN-700 router/access point. </s>
<s> I also have a notebook running XP Home with a wireless connection to the network. </s>
<s> Both computers can connect to the network just fine. </s>
<s> File and print sharing is enabled on both and the workgroup name is the same on both computers, yet when I'm on one computer and both are on the network I can't see the other computer. </s>
<s> Any ideas on what the problem might be? </s>
<s> XPs built in firewall (ICF) may be the limiting factor. </s>
<s> Try turning it off on both PCs. </s>
<s> I had the same exact problem when first hooking up new XP desktop through router to laptops. </s>
<s> It's the firewalls -- as mentioned you have to disable the built-in XP firewall HOWEVER you must ALSO disable the Firewall in Norton Internet Security (which comes preloaded in most XP's). </s>
<s> Once I disabled Norton's firewall the whole network was ready. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
