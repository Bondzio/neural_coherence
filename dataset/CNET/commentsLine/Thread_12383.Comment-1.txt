hello all, i recently built a new machine, basically from scratch.
i have been running it for only a week or two, so far and last night i happened to notice that the cpu was touching around 50 degrees c. i remember reading in the manual that it took a good number of processing hours for the heatsink and thermal compound to reach maximum efficiency, but i have to say, i am still a little nervous about letting my cpu get above 50c.
now, keep in mind that i am not an overclocker, nor do i wish to be.
my new cpu is an amd athlon 64 x2, 5200+ and socket am2.
i am looking for plausible suggestion for cooling within an already well-ventilated case.
i use a lian-li pc-60usb b2, with two front panel fans, one back panel fan and a top panel exhaust fan.
the proprietary fans for the cpu and the videocard are installed.
any helpful replies will be appreciated.
thanks, eric
