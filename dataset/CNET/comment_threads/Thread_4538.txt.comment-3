I am guessing you don't have 1080p on that TV.
If it has 1080p, I am pretty sure there would also be hdmi connection.
What kind of contents are you trying to view at 1080p?
You have a PS3 or blu-ray player on that PC?
I will also venture to say if you don't have a HD video card you might not have much fun trying to output 1080p contents.
Just my thoughts.
