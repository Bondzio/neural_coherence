ok so i tried a few times to repair the install and each time the machine would reboot itself, but on reboot setup would not re-launch.
now, when i try to boot the machine i no longer get a ntldr error, the system does a post, gets to the line about verifying dmi pool data, and does nothing.
no errors, no activity, just a blinking cursor, keyboard is useless for anything other than ctrl+alt+del.... my question at this point is even if i reinstall, what happens when i install xp, and it reboots during the process and this happens again?
