When you scan a document the resulting file is a graphic, not text.
If you scan the document using the OCR function, then you get a text file.
It sounds like the 38 pages were scanned as a single page, not individual graphics, thus you get one long graphic.
I have used my HP multi-function printer to scan documents and have selected either the graphic output, or the text output.
If you select PDF output, it is still going to output the pages as graphic captures and not text.
The resolution you set for the scan will also affect the size of the output file in bytes and in inches.
