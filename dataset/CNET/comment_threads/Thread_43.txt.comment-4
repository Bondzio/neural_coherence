I wonder if you forgot some BIOS or flash update, the motherboard drivers (some try what's on the CD and that's buggy or out of date.)
With such slim details all I can say is to call the maker and ask what they want to be exchanged.
Another nutty thing is overclocking.
Imagine the poor soul that tries that.
