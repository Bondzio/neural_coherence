I am leaning towards emachines because of the built in tuner...can anyone tell me what brand it is and the quality? If its total garbage I can get the hp. Also is there the ability to add another dvd drive if you choose in the emachines? I am concerned over emachines qulaity vs hp....any feedback would be appreciated.
