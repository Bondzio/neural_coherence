hello, i now have a 2010 toyota camry with a usb port.
i would like to connect an external hard drive to the usb port so that i can have access to all of my mp3s while in my car.
i know this usb connection will be fine for ipods that already have dichotomy software built in so i could easily navigate my library, but is this type of easy navigation possible when dealing with a hard drive?
would i have to find some sort of sorting software to add to my drive that the car's system can read, or will my car's system just be able to identify the files as music files and sort them my name, artist, etc.?
thanks so much for any help!
