I have IDE, Sata, and Raid in my computer all set up inside Bios. See your motherboard Manuel, or go to the motherboard web site. Good Luck Wendell H

I have IDE 1 - 4 for 2 HD- en 2 DVD-drives en SATA 1 -2 for another 2 HD- drives. what I'm using it for: I'm still waiting for KNOPPIX 5.0.1 (genuine installation to hard disk will now possible for the very first time) and Kubuntu to be ready. if it takes to long, I'll start wit Suse 10.1 anyway. once complete, I'll be able to boot from floppy and CD/DVD to whatever, from PATA to linux (my trio) and from SATA to W-xp PRO just by changing the boot-order in the BIOS. how's that for multi-boot?? succes, ben
