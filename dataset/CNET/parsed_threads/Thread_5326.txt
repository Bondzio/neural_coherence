<s> hey everyone. </s>
<s> i was wondering if this computer configuration would be under powered or would the 270 watts be more than enough. </s>
<s> thanks Operating System: Microsoft Windows XP Professional with Service Pack 2 Chassis: 270 watt power supply Processor: Intel Pentium 4 Processor 560 w/ HT Technology 3.6GHz 1MB Cache Motherboard: Alienware PCI Express Motherboard with Intel 915 Chipset Memory: 4.0 GB Dual Channel DDR PC-3200 SDRAM at 400MHz Video Card: ATI RADEON X600 XT PCI Express 128MB DDR w/Digital and TV Out System Drive: High Performance - Serial ATA - 400GB Hitachi Deskstar 7K400 7,200 RPM w/8MB Cache Optical Drive: Lite-On 16x DVD / 52x32x52x CD-RW Drive Removable Storage : 8-in-1 Digital Media Reader / Writer Sound Card: Creative Sound Blaster Audigy 2 ZS High Definition 7.1 Surround Network Connection: Integrated High Performance Intel Ethernet Adapter </s>
<s> If not today, it will be soon. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> The power supply is rated for that many Watts new. </s>
<s> In a year it may lose from 10 to 50% of that rating depending on too many factors. </s>
<s> To keep out of trouble I add it all up and toss 100 more Watts into the supply rating. </s>
<s> Those machines never show up due to an overtaxed power supply. </s>
