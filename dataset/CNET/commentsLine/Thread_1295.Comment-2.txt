before you upgrade your memory look at your swap space or virtual memory.
right click on my computer / system properties/ advanced / performance / settings.
this is how much space on the disk (usually c) you have allowed for big memory applications or multi-tasking when you launch a bunch of programs to have for swapping and saving information.
if you've filled up the c drive and that space has decreased or has never been increased it might be why you've gotten sluggish.
then i would say look to other sources for that older memory, it'll probably be cheaper elsewhere including used off e-bay and will answer your question.
memory is the best performance enchancer most of the time.
past that some of these $399 systems being offered now sure perform better than older systems, with smaller amounts of memory but faster bus speeds, cpu's and graphics.
