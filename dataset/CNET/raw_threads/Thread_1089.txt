Hi, I understand that the answer depends on how often you use, but anyone has any experience with that model? The ink is cheap, but how much would the printhead cost, if you have to repplace it? and how often? I'm planning to buy this model for my home office. Any info/advices would help. Many Thanks

If you ever need to replace it I would recommend buying a printer with the same printhead {IP4000} it would be cheaper then buying the printhead alone, plus you get a new set of carts. Ebay sells the IP4000 pretty cheaply just make sure the include the ink and everything.
