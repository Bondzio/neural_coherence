Hello everybody, I have a HP computer that recently had the hard drive go bad.
I was talking with their support and they wanted to charge around $400 dollars for a replacement drive and she said that the recovery discs can't be used on third party drives, is that true?
I'm not the most tech savvy person but I want to know can I just buy an affordable third party drive and have it work?
I'm not sure how to tell what kind of hard drive to get.
I know there is IDE and SATA but are there any more types?
and how can I tell which one I have?
Thanks in advance
