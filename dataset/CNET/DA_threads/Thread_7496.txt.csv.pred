1.1.1	I already have the case ( standard mid-atx Antec with front firewire/USB 2.0 plugs ) .	St
1.1.2	Do I need a certain type of motherboard to be able to connect the front Firewire ( IEEE 1394a/b ) ?	Ques
1.1.3	Or will all standard mobo 's have the pins to connect it correctly ?	Ques
1.1.4	I have been building PC 's for a while now , so I know all the basics .	St
1.1.5	I 'm just not sure what to buy for this .	St
1.2.1	is on the front cable ?	Ques
1.2.2	Some are simply those that one feeds through the a hole in the rear and plug into the rear connectors .	St
1.2.3	Others are the small black connectors that plug into the mobo .	St
1.2.4	When you consider buying a mobo , do n't you take the time to read what it contains/supports ?	Ques
1.2.5	it 's all there in black and white , or whatever colors you prefer .	St
1.2.6	They even provide pictures , and you can even download the manual to read before you consider buying .	St
1.2.7	Or go to http : //www.tomshardware.com and read details on all of the motherboards that support the CPU/Chipset that you are interested in .	Sug
1.3.1	I always do alot of research before I buy anything .	St
1.3.2	I 've found the motherboards that specifically state that they support frontside IEEE 1394/firewire ... so if it does n't have the the fire controller it wo n't work ?	Ques
1.3.3	Someone told me that the standard front-side connectors on mobo 's could support firewire .	St
1.3.4	I do n't think that 's true , but since it came from a usually trustworthy source I thought I would verify this .	St
1.3.5	Thanks for the reply .	St
1.4.1	support firewire .	St
1.4.2	You are totally correct to double check I 'm looking at two right now that do not support it in the front .	St
1.4.3	Lot 's od USB though .	St
1.4.4	LOL	St
1.5.1	mixed up between mobo and case .	St
1.5.2	If the mobo has the firewire pins on the mobo surface , it will certainly support firewire in the chipset or a separate chip .	St
1.5.3	And you have a case that supports it , so then you will simply enable it in the BIOS Fire wire is slowly becoming a standard along with USB .	St
1.5.4	Remember it is a Mac development and MS still does n't acknowledge it .	St
1.5.5	They call it i [ something ] .	St
1.5.6	MFRs do n't like offending MS. LOL	St
1.6.1	I would n't get a new MB just to get Firewire , but just get a firewire PCI card .	St
1.6.2	Since I have some older ATX cases that do n't have front USB or Firewire ports I got a 5 1/4 & quot ; drive filer that had both , the cables go throught the caes , out the back and plug into the rear usb and firewire ports .	St
1.6.3	Dose the job , cost $ 10 .	St
1.6.4	John	St
