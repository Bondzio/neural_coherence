i'm in the exact same place as you, incoming freshman this year, and i need tons of storage to take my stuff with me.
i'm looking for 800-900gig though.
check that out.
uata100, 300gb, for $100 after the rebate.
look on newegg.com for an ata to usb2 adapter.
it's about $15, and it has a plug to convert the ata/ide connector to usb2, and a laptop-cable-looking setup to power the drive.
i'm planning on running a few of these in a custom enclosure.
there's such a shortage of stackable external hard drive enclosures, and i still haven't seen one that holds multiple drives, short of using a complete pc tower, and my dorm room will be really really small.
