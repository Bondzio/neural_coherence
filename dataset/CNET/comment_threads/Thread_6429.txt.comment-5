Lexar has advised that if I am unable to recover the disk they will try to do it for me, and even issue a replacement.
I wasn't able to back up anything because the card failed on the very first day of use... literally can't do anything with it as my computer won't recognize it... and this is after less than one day of use.
So will be sending it to Lexar.
Lexar did say I should have formatted the card in the camcorder before use.
But I've never had to do that before... card comes formatted so I just thought it was ok to use that way.
Not sure I understand why a card must be formatted in the camera before use.
