<s> I have an older sata hd that already has an os on it that I need to get some info from. </s>
<s> How can I connect this to my current system? </s>
<s> If I just plug it into my extra sata slot, will it automatically read my current still as the boot drive? </s>
<s> And if so, will I have to download any drivers to be able to access this old hd to pull the info off of it? </s>
<s> Sorry if its a little confusing. </s>
<s> I used to work on computers but haven't dealt with any in a while, especially sata. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> You mean just plug it in and it will work? </s>
<s> Sorry but those that don't won't know. </s>
<s> Now I'll share for me it just works. </s>
<s> There is NO new issues I ran into that don't pop up with other drives. </s>
<s> Good luck, Bob </s>
