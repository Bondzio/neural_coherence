<s> Good Day I hope someone can assist by adding some light to this subject? </s>
<s> I have an office with 7 Windows XP Desktops, all running Duel LG Monitors except for 1 desktop. </s>
<s> Some monitors are wide and some square but all with the same issue. </s>
<s> Also, about 3 out of 7 desktops has PCI-E Radeon Cards in them. </s>
<s> The problem I am facing is that they were running this setup for the last 3 years until they had their tables changed to ones that can elevate up and down. </s>
<s> With this in place, having to get longer VGA cables were needed and a simple 3Meter VGA DB-15 cable * 13 would do the trick. </s>
<s> Fitting the cables aren't any problem but as soon as I had them connected and then switched on the desktops. </s>
<s> I realized that there is a bad blur on every single monitor, even the desktop with one monitor. </s>
<s> I later went and got a 5 Meter VGA cable to test with and the blur goes better, but it is still there. </s>
<s> I even went and tried updateing graphics driver for 3 machines, 2 were Radeon HD cards and 1 Intel Express Chip. </s>
<s> Updated both with drivers and control centres but still no difference. </s>
<s> having to plug back the original cables coming with the Lg Monitors works like a charm, but then have the problem where I can't use the elevated tables. </s>
<s> My question would be, Is there any quality differences between these cables you can buy or is it about the length that it looses signal strength. </s>
<s> Just keep in mind that the 5 meter worked better than the 3meter cable. </s>
<s> Could it be a compatibility issue that I am getting here or is it ust my luck that anything above 1.8meters will be more blurry than the original cable. </s>
<s> Any assistance will be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> The signals from a video card or any from a PC ports are limited to the quality of cable and length. </s>
<s> Your problem if you use ext. </s>
<s> cables to std. </s>
<s> cable you degrade the signal. </s>
<s> If single longer cable, the same result. </s>
<s> You have reached the limits of video signal strength(degradation) and you see the results. </s>
<s> Either get &quot;high quality&quot; cables or a signal repeater that maintains signal strength. </s>
<s> Google for video boosters or similar, here's one. </s>

<s> Hi and thank you for the reply. </s>
<s> It makes a whole lot sense when you say that the signal is the part that gets weaker as the cable length becomes longer or attached to more cables as extensions. </s>
<s> The way I am trying this is all with single cables, nothing attached to extend or anything. </s>
<s> just standard single cables, but having to use the 3 meter cables made it very blurry and using the 5 meter cable was slightly better but still blurry. </s>
<s> the 5 meter cable is a thicker insulated cable than the 3meter. </s>
<s> That would be a better quality then?? </s>
<s> the best quality I am getting is from the original 1.8 meter cable which I can't use because of the length, but I will check out those video boosters as well as every option will be tried and tested. </s>
<s> Otherwise having to buy proper quality VGA cables might be my only option. </s>
<s> How do I tell the difference in good or bad cables. </s>
<s> I Googled this question and found that they mention these signal blockers at the end of every side of the VGA cable. </s>
<s> also thicker sleeved cables are better quality. </s>
<s> Is this al true or should I know more than this? </s>
<s> Many thanks </s>
<s> Honestly when it comes to quality, price is pretty much the factor of what you get. </s>
<s> Also, it should state its &quot;shielded properties&quot;. </s>
<s> Further, even with a single cable of hi-quality build and since you seem able to de-attach it, makes that an issue as well, because the fact you have a build-in break at the monitor. </s>
<s> Impedance is more introduced at all breaks in the cable length. </s>
<s> In other words, all connections imply a break, though complete with proper setup, depends on that being sound. </s>
<s> You will notice the monitor's video cable is roughly 3-4ft(1M) long. </s>
<s> If you find another single cable, I think the most it will be is 3M(8-9ft) long and its a hit-or-miss it will work, thus try only on 1 PC setup for now. </s>
<s> You can google away for ideas but I suggest contact the monitor makers and see if they offer an optional cable. </s>
<s> Also, try this website for some clues or parts: http://www.monitorworld.com tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I am having the same problems with a 23&quot; LG LED monitor. </s>
<s> The only cable that works properly is the cable that is supplied with the monitor. </s>
<s> I need an 8-10' cable. </s>
<s> If you have found a solution I would greatly appreciate it if you would let me know about it. </s>
<s> Many thanks.... </s>
<s> Skip VGA and go with a digital HDMI or digital DVI connection. </s>
<s> hi nelsonrh, i just bought a cheap cable &quot;5M VGA HD SVGA Extension Cable For PC Monitor Projector&quot; from ebay for 3.90 it work for my computer but when i turn the computer off and the LG monitor on, it will show &quot;check signal cable&quot;. </s>
<s> i think is about the pins, some only have 14 pins connected(not 15 pins) but i am not sure. </s>
