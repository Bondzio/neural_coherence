<s> You've got 500 watts and the card doesn't appear to have a connector for additional power. </s>
<s> All things considered, you should be fine. </s>
<s> That seems to be an exercise in doing &quot;not much&quot;. </s>
<s> Look into a Radeon hd 5670. </s>
<s> At least you'll get a little bang for the buck. </s>

<s> The GT x20 could be not much of an upgrade. </s>
<s> While I know the 8600 was not known for sipping power the 520 should draw less Watts. </s>
<s> Let's find some benchmarks. </s>
