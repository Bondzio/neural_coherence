1.1.1	Every morning i have this trouble turning on my PC .	St
1.1.2	I turn on my AVR , then push the power button on cpu case .	St
1.1.3	What happened , the power LED only blink and the PC do n't open/power on .	St
1.1.4	The first time this happen , I opened my case and look for the suspected culprit .	St
1.1.5	I detached my psu and have it check by qualified technician to see if it is bad or damaged .	St
1.1.6	It was n't ( use tester , it 's good ; did some switching on pins and got no problem ! ) .	St
1.1.7	So I put back psu , and for other suspected culprit , this time : check the wires connecting my SW to power button .	St
1.1.8	I pull and replugged the pins/connector thinking it just need some & quot ; refreshing & quot ; and it will be good again .	St
1.1.9	Then , I turn on my PC again pushing the power button on the case .	St
1.1.10	It start my PC !	St
1.1.11	But the next morning , the same fate happened .	St
1.1.12	I 've gone again to the same ordeal , repeating what I did the past day ... And these have been my practice every morning since then.. Until , I got tired of doing it over and over again .	St
1.1.13	So , while my AVR is turn on i just let it sit there ( perhaps 3-5 minutes ) and out of disgust I pushed on the power AND my PC start again !	St
1.1.14	So every morning , I let my AVR turn on for several minutes ( 5 minutes ) or even more before pushing my power button .	St
1.1.15	Sometimes , successful sometimes NOT .	St
1.1.16	I also observed that during COOL temperature ( e.g when rain down poured the past night ) I have this problem , but not on a HOT temperature ( e.g .	St
1.1.17	no rain the past night ) .	Res
1.1.18	I do n't know what 's exactly the culprit .	St
1.1.19	Please help me on this .	Sug
1.1.20	Suggestions would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.1.21	Here 's my PC 's specs : Pentium 4 , 3.06Ghz Mobo : Foxconn 865G7MF series Total Physical Memory ( RAM ) : 1,024.00 MB OS : MS Windows XP Pro , version 5.1.2600 SP3 Build 2600 HDD : 2 ( Hitachi , 80g ; Fujitsu 6g ) Optical : CDROM generic FDD : generic psu : 600watts generic avr : 500watts generic Thanks in advance guys !

1.2.1	Type BAD CAPS into google.com and what you find is one of the side effects is the machines wo n't start when cold .	St
1.3.1	As Robert stated , & quot ; bad caps & quot ; can be a fault .	St
1.3.2	Google for images to verify yours .	St
1.3.3	Its a known problem .	St
1.3.4	Next , while the PSU was tested , I believe it was simple voltage & quot ; LEDs & quot ; on small tester rather than a full-blown power test .	St
1.3.5	Some PSUs can appear OK on the little tester but fail as when a real power demand is required not just the presence as the & quot ; pumff & quot ; to get things going is n't there .	St
1.3.6	They too suffer from bad caps as well as caps are everywhere in electronics .	St
1.3.7	If your system case is n't well cooled , a PSU can falter over time on that alone .	St
1.3.8	Switches are tricky , they can work and not if of cheap make-up or faulty , period .	St
1.3.9	Though , switches are rarely a cause of problems , simple as they , only an ohm meter can verify that .	St

1.4.1	I 've read the link you suggested re : bad caps .	St
1.4.2	One more info , power outage is a regular occurrence in my place .	St
1.4.3	I believe this can damage electronic equipment , but I 'm still not that aware of which equipment will be easily affected by this power outage .	St
1.4.4	Thank you Robert and Willy !	St
1.4.5	I 'll go check my capacitors .	Sug
1.5.1	If you experience re-occurring AC outages and the returning surges can cause havoc on any electronics , PCs being very prone .	St
1.5.2	I suggest besides a simple surge protector ( a good one ) , the likes of a decent UPS ( orderly shutdown ) plus a & quot ; line conditioner & quot ; .	St
1.5.3	This all costs , but it can be worth the value if it reduces or eliminates much of AC problems which in turn can cause PC issues .	St
1.5.4	FYI- I use solo AC surge protectors for each line and placed on a surge protected strip which in turn in plugged-in to a surge outlet socket at wall .	St
1.5.5	Sensitive devices are routed to a line conditioner which is also plugged-in to a surge protected outlet .	St
1.5.6	Why , all this protection , because I live in a wooded area where & quot ; lighting hits & quot ; are common .	St
1.5.7	I do unplug everything when things get hairy when home .	St
1.5.8	I 've been saved more than once just replace the surge protection that got hit .	St
1.5.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
