ok i can't find the make, model of the laptop so i'll give the short version.
1. sony made blu ray.
*hint* 2.
3. but to play blu ray we need player software as there is no open source or free version.
try this -&gt;  many laptops use sata for that drive but with only what i read in this post i can't offer much else.
