So i have a wireless network connection and a LAN connection and they are both displayed under the network bridge section in the Network Connections window, however, there is no bridge icon so i cant disable the &quot;bridge&quot; or configure my network adapters by themselves.
Is there another way to disable the bridge that doesn't seem to exist?
Ive tried a method that dealt with the registry and it removed the bridge but screwed up the adapters so i had to run a system restore and so im back to where i started.
what it looks like... http://img216.imageshack.us/img216/5017/89979969fl3.jpg thanks
