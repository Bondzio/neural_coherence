This configuration worked for a couple of years but now, only the new computer will connect to the internet. The old computer doesn't connect at all. I have already tried: 1) Restarting the Computer 2) Powercycling the Modem and Router That didn't fix it. Also, I notice that when I restart the old computer, in IPCONFIG, everything seems correct, but the internet connection doesn't work. Here are the settings: Connection-specific DNS suffix: ok.shawcable.net IP Address: 192.168.1.101 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1 Then, I enter the command ipconfig /release and I get this Connection-specific DNS suffix: IP Address: 0.0.0.0 Subnet Mask: 0.0.0.0 Default Gateway: Then, I enter ipconfig /renew and I get this error: An error ocurred when renewing interface Local Area Connection : unable to contact your DHCP server. Request has timed out. Then, I enter the command IPCONFIG again and I see this configuration: Connection-specific DNS suffix: Autoconfiguration IP Address: 169.254.78.32 Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0 Default Gateway: ---------------------------------------------------------------------- I just think its weird how one computer can connect to the net and one cant. Thanks in advance

There are enhanced networking applications in SP2. Second thing is to update the router firmware. Third - move the Ethernet cable to another port on the router. One port may have gone bad. Fourth - replace the NIC. Or just for grins, swap it with the working one, see if the problems moves. That oddball IP address 169.254.78.32 comes up when the NIC cannot access the LAN.

I'll try and update the router firmware and see what happens. I'l also try plugging the cable into another port on the router. I really don't want to replace or move the NIC. Thanx for the help
