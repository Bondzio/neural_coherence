...your system supports a max of 1gb, which you have.
when i google the memory you have, results are inconclusive, so it's unclear if you have registered memory or unbuffered.
according to the specifications page, the memory it's required to have is two 184-pin unbuffered ddr 333/266/200 dimms without ecc.
if you are trying to put in memory that uses ecc or that is registered, it won't work.
i don't know if the memory you bought was from the compaq website, but here is the place where you can get the correct memory for your system.
if you use froogle.google.com to search for places that sell it, you can find them here:  good luck.
