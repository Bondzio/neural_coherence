I bought a cpu/mobo combo, and got a crappy mobo. What I'm building around is: Athlon XP 3000+ barton (333FSB) 1 gb dual channel PC3200 DDR ram (400FSB) Ati Radeon 9800 pro 256 video card Hercules gamesurround Muse 5.1 DVD sound card (is this crap ?) Features I'm looking for are: dual bios or an easy way to en/disable dual channel for ram (depending on what I'm doing) integrated lan 2 SATA channels 4 PATA133 channels firewire I'll be running win98 and linux. I'll be using it for gaming and video editing thanx

Then I can start scanning reviews of the remaining choices. Thanx

6042	6	40627	482325	481412	Ray Harinec	10/15/04 2:04 PM	1.09784904E12	I favor gigabyte but they are	usually somewhat more expensive. They have the dual BIOS, but at least on the one that I use at work, the CMOS chips are soldered on the board. I'm not certain that I would rather have a single BIOS on a plug in CMOS chip. In emergency one can get a new chip. The good thing is that their ITE gigaraid chip allows rhe ports to be used for ATA drives or ATAPI drives. Don't get dual bios and dual channel memory mixed up. The way to go from dual chamnnel memory setup would be to open the case and move one of the memory sticks to the non dual channel slot. taint automatic.

So far, after posting this question in 8 different forums, I've got: 11 it doesn't matters 1 &quot;I had a problem once&quot; vs the one post that made me start this line of inquiry Thanx
