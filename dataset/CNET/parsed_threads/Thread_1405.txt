<s> Could you give some more info, ie: was this SATA drive in the computer originally? </s>
<s> Is this your boot drive or just an extra drive? </s>
<s> Assuming XP is up to date, did you load the SATA drivers? </s>
<s> What means does any other hard drives in this computer connect, IDE or SATA? </s>
<s> thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> the sata disk is actually a secondary hard disk in which only data is stored, and no os is installed. </s>
<s> it was added later to the original config, to increase the space for data storage. </s>
<s> anyway, i found that the data cable is damaged. </s>
<s> i replaced it with new one and now its working . </s>
<s> Glad to hear you got it sorted. </s>
