I have the Intel Desktop Board D915GVWB, would this board support a pentium 4 hyper-threading cpu or better yet maybe one of intels new 6xx cpu for 64bit compatibility.
Maybe I should just swap out the motherboard for a aftermarket motherboard with a new cpu.
What 3rd party motherboard would fit inside my emachines T5026 case?
Thanks again for all the help.
