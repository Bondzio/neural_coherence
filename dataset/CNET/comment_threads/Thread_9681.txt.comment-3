Your internet speed will be the same.
If you have more than 1 computer on the router and share files between them your speed will increase dramatically.
802.11b runs at 11 mbs and 802.11g runs at 54 mbs or 108 mbs depending on which 1 you buy.
A new router may provide better wireless security.
If you decide to upgrade look at your laptop specs to see if it is a 54 mbs or a 108 mbs wireless connection.
You may use either 1 no matter what you decide.
goodluck
