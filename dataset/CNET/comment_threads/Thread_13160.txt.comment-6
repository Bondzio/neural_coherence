It was a real workhorse, too -- until it died.
I Googled your Brother MFC-5890CN, and saw that CNET really savaged it in their review (although it got fairly decent user reviews).
I could have sworn the scanning surface of my Epson 3490 was legal-size (which would have made multifunction devices with 8.5&quot;x11.7&quot; scanning surfaces (f.ex.
CNET's top-rated Lexmark S305 &amp; S605) problematic choices.
However, I finally got out a measuring tape to measure the 3490's scanning surface -- and it's only about 9&quot;x12&quot; (to fit European A4 paper originals?)
-- so it's not that big after all.
No big immediate rush on getting a new printer or scanner for me, so I can wait for a really good sale or coupon special (or the next time I get a big Amazon.com credit from sending off my oldest's college textbooks to their buyback program!
).
