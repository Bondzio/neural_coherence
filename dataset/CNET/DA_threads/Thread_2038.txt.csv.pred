1.1.1	Hello , my husband just bought a gateway notebook computer for home and travel use .	St
1.1.2	Went into this without really knowing much about notebooks , but he really wanted one ( happy early father 's day to him : - ) ) Anyway ... .where do we start about getting wireless internet ?	Ques
1.1.3	What do we need to buy ?	Ques
1.1.4	We have a one level house currently using DSL ( Roadrunner ) for our 2 desktops .	St
1.1.5	Should we get wireless through Roadrunner ?	Ques
1.1.6	Someone mentioned said NO ... use wireless cards ? ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.7	Any information would be appreciated .	Polite
1.1.8	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	1 ) Did the new laptop come with integrated wireless .	St
1.2.2	These days , most all do , but that 's not absolutely universal .	St
1.2.3	If it has WiFi , then you do n't need anything more for the computer .	St
1.2.4	If it does not have built-in WiFi , you 'll need to buy a PC-Card WiFi adapter ( it slides into the little slot on the side of the computer ) .	St
1.2.5	2 ) Are you using a broadband router for sharing the DSL between your two desktop machines ?	Ques
1.2.6	If so , you 'll need to replace it with a WiFi unit .	St
1.2.7	That will be a one-for-one swap .	St
1.2.8	The new router will have 4 wired ethernet ports for the desktops , but will have a radio chip and antennae too for the wireless .	St
1.2.9	You 'll have to follow the directions for setting it up for your specific connection , but that 's usually pretty easy .	St
1.2.10	If you are not using a broadband router for sharing the DSL , then you will need to tell us a bit more about that .	St
1.2.11	If you are using some sort of routing capability in the DSL modem , then you 'll need to disable that to put it in bridge-mode and then install a WiFi router .	St
1.3.1	thanks for the information .	Polite
1.3.2	The notebook did come integrated for wireless .	St
1.3.3	so we are okay there .	St
1.3.4	We will need to get the new router so we will start there .	St
1.3.5	thanks again	Polite
