some label the ps3 an &quot;embedded&quot; system.
and today people are using x86 for embedded systems.
this means the cell processor is not so limited to be this or not but let's skip to why i noted the embedded market.
it's where you would find your cpu.
remember it won't work in your common x86 board so by itself it is pretty much like a paper weight.
why isn't a sbc, ps3 or dev kit the answer for you?
