i experienced the same lackluster speed on my hp d4999t running windows 7 64 bit until i installed intel's matrix storage manager.
notice how much i revealed in one sentence?
and i will not find out what intel is calling that software today because i can't look it up everytime this comes up.
please do a little work when needed.
--&gt; i can't know if this applies but hope it does.
just a tip.
try to post all the details so folk have what they need to give you the best chance of success.
