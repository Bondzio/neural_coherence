I use a powerline bridge for extending my wireless network.
Belkin and a few others have what is called homelink which is basically a bridge the lets you send your network further using the house 120VAC wiring.
I use one unit by my router and one in my shop, which is about 150 ft away and has metal walls, in the shop I have a 2nd wireless router/access point.
I have suggested this for use in some large homes and they have worked well.
