The new hard drive sounds pretty interesting.
I don't want to go through the reconfiguring of all my browsers, clients and so forth.
Let's not even think about the docs!
It doesn't have to be that large of a HD.
I'll check ebay and also look at upgrades.
Bob, have you got any Microsoft certs?
Any advice on the exams?
