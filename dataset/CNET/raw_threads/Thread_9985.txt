I'm plaining to purchase a new PC but I don't know which CPUs to go with. Now I'd be using the new PC about 1/2 of the time for gaming, then the other half with multi-tasking. I've been reading a lot of articles stating that you should go with AMD 64 3800+ for gaming, but also a lot of articles are saying that get an INTEL P4 3.4, cos they do all of that with easy + they offer DDR 2 memory which is the best according to these web-sites I've been reading as of late. The motherboard I'd be using is one of the top-of-the-line ASUS for either CPU's. BTW, my budget is about 1200$. Note: The case that I want to get allows you to have about 6 fans inside. So that should handle any INTEL's problems of over-heating that ppl are stating. So what CPU is the best for my buck and what I want to do with it? Note: Yall can throw any other related hardware advice for this PC to glow! + Any web-sites would help to start seaching! Thanks!!!

Keep in mind nothing's future proof, amd already has new socket M2 on the drawing boards. As for multitasking, depends on how intense that is, if its not very like, just microsoft office and winamp or w/e, then amd will work. Roger

Keep in mind that all of the processors do the job!!! So if your gaming 50% of the time get a AMD. AMDs do very well on dual channel PCC3200 memory. You can build a very fast gamming PC in the $700~900 range. Look through some of the post here and in the PC hardware fourms. John
