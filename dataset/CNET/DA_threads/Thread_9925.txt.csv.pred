1.1.1	Hello , I want to build a nice gaming computer , and I have slightly over a grand to spend on parts ( not including monitor and operating system , those are covered already ) .	St
1.1.2	I have some general computer knowledge , what parts handle what and I have a pretty good idea of where to plug them in .	St
1.1.3	That being said , when buying parts I 'm at a bit of a loss .	St
1.1.4	I 'm not sure when looking at a motherboard for instance , what I need to be looking for .	St
1.1.5	I think I might could find some high performance parts , but I 'm really worried about them being compatible If anyone has ideas on some good compatible parts or possibly tips as to what I could run into as far is incompatibility issues , that would be great .	St
1.1.6	Thanks , Nicholas	St
