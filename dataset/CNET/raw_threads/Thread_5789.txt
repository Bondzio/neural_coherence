I bought an Airlink Awll6070 USB Wireless Adapter 3 days ago. After installing the driver and native software I have detected around 3 consistent networks (available almost 24/7) on my location with a strong signal usually 3/5 and 50 Mbps. Two of them are WEp encrypted and the other WPA. I have installed Backtrack 3 on a 2GB Sandisk Cruzer USB Port. Using airodump-ng, and aircrack-ng I have determined the WEP (128 bit) of one network after analyzing about 800,000 codes. I have tried this three times to ensure i got the right key. I tried connecting to the network using that key in ASCII format so 13 hexadecimal numbers. I get IP autethification and can send packets, but I cant seem to receive any packets from the network. I tried ping [IP] and it worked, but I still cant connect to the internet, any suggestions?
