here i can get an old hub for less than that crossover cable.
where are you?
sorry to see you struggle here.
the notes above do have the info but no step by step and the article i added has to be rethought to be used but it does contain some needed tips to make it all work the way i'd like to use it.
--&gt; big idea.
why do you need a network?
why not shuttle files over with cdrw or usb memory key?
