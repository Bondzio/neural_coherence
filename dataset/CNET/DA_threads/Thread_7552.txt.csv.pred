1.1.1	hi i was considering buying either a ; Ageia physX accelerator OR a Radeon X1800xt crossfire edition master card , that i can work in crossfire with my existing X1800xt standard 256mb card .	St
1.1.2	I know that the xt master card has 512mb and that in order to use it in crossfire i would have to sacrifice half of this , and i have taken this into consideration .	St
1.1.3	I 'll be gratefull for any help that anyone can offer , thanks in advance	Polite
1.2.1	physx is only in 2 titles now .	St
1.2.2	by the end of the year , it 's *supposed* to be in 50 or so .	St
1.2.3	physx does n't add better performance ... it just gives you more objects and more realistic interactions .	St
1.2.4	havok fx is being supported by nvidia and ati so it will probably have a similar level of support as physx .	St
1.2.5	to quote tom 's hardware : & quot ; we can not conclude that a PPU is necessary , because multi-core processors could handle gameplay and effects physics in the off cycles while the graphics hardware is not rendering .	St
1.2.6	Even using the specially-designed game demo gives us nothing compelling to recommend purchasing a PhysX based card .	St
1.2.7	We are still excited about what physics will bring to gaming , but we stand only on the doorstep of what could be the next greatest processing development. & quot ; http : //www.tomshardware.com/2006/07/19/is_ageias_physx_failing/page9.html	St
