I have seen these little portable hard drives that are USB 2 and 3.
What is the story on those?
My son is a contractor and uses a laptop, he is looking for something for backup that is portable and reliable.
He ask me about them and I really don't know anyone who has used them.
Mine has a outside power source, but that wouldn't fit with what he does.
He asked around at Best Buy, Staple and places like that, but those guys tell you anything to get a sale.
Any idea on those?
