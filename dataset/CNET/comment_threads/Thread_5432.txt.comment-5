The computer itself is not for me.
I'm buying it for a relative.
Their new job requires that they have enough memory to download all of the their company software, customer files etc.
I have a refursbished hp computer myself.
About 8 months strong now.
I'm just a little wary of getting them one because this is for a job and not just regular activity.
P.S.
My handle was made years ago when I didn't know better.
