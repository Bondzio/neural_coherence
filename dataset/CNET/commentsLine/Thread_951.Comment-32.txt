my faster speed drive is a 5400rpm 60 gig wetstern digital.
now set to 32k cluster size.
partitioned with 29 gigs (fat32) for xp and 25 gigs for linux.
my other hardrive witch is slower.
it is a 7200 rpm, 80gig, japanese brand, don't remember witch.
it has 2 partitions with ntfs.
one set to 4k cluster size and the other set to 64k cluter size.
both storage partitions.
thats why i'm trying to get to the bottom of this it doesn't make since to me.
