<s> I am trying to help a friend who recently got 2 surplus dell computers that were used in a school. </s>
<s> They are running windows 98 and have 512 ram 20 gig hard drives and if I remember correctly are running 1 gig celeron processors. </s>
<s> Her intended use is for the kids 5-12 to be able to play their cd based games on, so I think the machines are sufficient as many of the games are older and wouldn't run on a newer os anyway. </s>
<s> Her problem is that someone at the school where they were used set them up &quot;kid proof&quot;. </s>
<s> That is every time the system powers up it is the same. </s>
<s> It doesn't matter what you install or delete or any other changes that you make it always comes back the same. </s>
<s> As you can imagine this is somewhat frustrating to the kids as their games and scores are all gone. </s>
<s> I suspect that there is hidden program somewhere that is doing this but I have no idea where to begin to look and am not sure I would know if I found it. </s>
<s> Any suggestions or pointers would be greatly appreciated. </s>

<s> As you can imagine this is somewhat frustrating to the kids as their games and scores are all gone.&quot; Such freeze programs are made to be nearly impossible to remove. </s>
<s> So I just wipe the drive and reinstall Windows. </s>

<s> I thought about doing that but she would then need to purchase an operating system which would kinda defeat the whole cheap computer thing. </s>
<s> Not yet. </s>
<s> And without your install CD you don't have a clear license to use this OS. </s>
<s> Sorry but it looks like this can only be cheap if you install Linux. </s>
