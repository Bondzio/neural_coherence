1.3.1	u should not delete the USB root things that ur talking about.They are the USB controllers that allow u to use USB devices ... U will need to install the chipset drivers if u have ur motherboard disk then install the printer software with the printer connected to it ... FOllow the instructions in the manual u got with the printer ... .	Sug
