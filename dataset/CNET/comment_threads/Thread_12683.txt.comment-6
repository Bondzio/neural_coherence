Also most servers have dual NICs in them.
I assume that you have a T1 line.
You could upgrade to an AMD64 dual core later on.
Yes a dual processor would be better.
Check out server boards at newegg.com http://www.newegg.com/ProductSort/SubCategory.asp?SubCategory=302 Maybe a Dual Processor MB and add the second processor later.
If I were doing this I would put the OS on a seprate HD from the raid data drives, but thats just me.
