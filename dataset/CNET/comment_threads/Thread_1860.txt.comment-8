The only reason why I'd pick a Brother would be saving $50 or so over an HP (the cheapest Brothers are at least that much cheaper than the cheapest HP lasers), but that of course is left in the dust by the expense of at least 3 drums over the life of the printer.
Thanks for letting me know about the others, tho.
I've never used a non-HP printer, so I had no idea that (most of) the others didn't make you replace the drum as well.
