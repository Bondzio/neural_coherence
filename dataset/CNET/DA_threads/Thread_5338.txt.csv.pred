1.1.1	my enermax is dying, or at least, the constant shift in PIO mode of my hard drives makes me wonder.	St
1.1.2	I have an enermax here that I have always admired.	St
1.1.3	but which one to get to replace it?	St
1.1.4	I have a kd7a mobo amd 3200 cpu i think 3 hard drives and one liteon dvd burner found enermaxes on tigerdirect.	St
1.1.5	any advice?	St
1.1.6	on which to get or where to buy?	St
1.1.7	need at least 400w i think.	St
1.1.8	thanks!	St
1.1.9	--fj	St
1.2.1	Get something with at least 19A on the 12v rail.	St
1.2.2	Roger	St
1.3.1	also look at antec and ocz.	St
1.3.2	newegg and frys.	St
1.3.3	konny	St
1.4.1	It does hurt to get the largest p/s unit you can afford.	St
1.4.2	The extra wattage is room to grow on and the name brand helps.	St
1.4.3	It suggests that each power leg provides ample voltage at a stable level.	St
1.4.4	If you don't buy Enermax, then Antec Vantec, or SparklePower.	St
1.4.5	You should check: http://www.tomshardware.com for test reviews and the like.	St
1.4.6	Don't fall for cheap units that offer 500W unless they've got some generous return policy, too often, cheap is cheap.	St

1.6.1	Well thank you very much for this advice.	Polite
1.6.2	I think I may go with antec just because they are readily available at local retail outlets.	St
1.6.3	I realize that the Halcyon days of $40 power supplies are gone, and I'll have to spend about 90 plus dollars on this thing.	St
1.6.4	I should think 430 + watt Watts ought to do me.	St
1.6.5	I am assuming that most power supplies are compatible with this two year old motherboard.	St
1.6.6	I do want one that is relatively quiet if I can get it.	St
1.6.7	Any specific recommendations would be wonderful, as there are several variation in antecs in this watt range (dedicated circuits, fans, etc) Thank you all!	St

1.7.3	it wont disapoint konny	St
1.8.1	well I am off to buy the 430 watt version (3 hdd's and ond dvd drive in there, kd7a mobo) unless someone tells me different in the next 30 min!	St
1.8.2	thanks so much for the help and support.	Polite
