i have bought an hp c3180 &quot;all-in-one&quot; (scanner/printer/copier).
but when i try to install it, it is not even detected by the system.
i booted under linux and ran the 'lsusb' program to detect usb devices; it isn't even there.
searching has found that this printer needs an &quot;usb 2.0 cable&quot;.
can someone confirm this?
thanks!
!
