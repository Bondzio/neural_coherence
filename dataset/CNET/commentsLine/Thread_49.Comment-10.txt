following more inspection, here is what ive found: 1-the connector is indeed white and of a similar width to standard atxs.i havent taken it out yet, but when i do, ill match the order of the wires with standard atxs to determine if hp did something.
2-i found that there is a mild high pitched electrical buzz when i plug the psu into the mains with the system off...that cant be normal, can it?
i probably cant hear it when i boot as the other noise is louder... 3-i used a toothpick in all the fans, booted, removed them one by one to see if any one of them was the source...but the high pitched noise was already there with the fans jammed off.
4-i then decided to systematically try all the drives...took all the 4-pin molexes out and put them in one by one....with just the dvd drive, theres a near silent running.
with just the ide hard drive theres a slight hum.....but with the scsi, theres the high pitched annoyance thats been driving me crazy!
so i mustve misdiagnosed.......its the scsi main c drive, not the psu.........although that slight electrical buzz when i plug the psu into the mains is worrying.... i know scsis have a higher rpm so may make more noise...but surely something this loud is unnatural....ive mounted it using the four screws into the rail system, theres no room for vibration.... time for a new hard drive?
