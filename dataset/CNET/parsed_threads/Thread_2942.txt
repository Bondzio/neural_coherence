<s> Is it possible to refill the ink cartridges on a Canon MX700. </s>
<s> I could do it on my MP730 but this one does not seem to work. </s>
<s> If not, I will have to find a printer that will. </s>
<s> The cartridges are just too expensive. </s>
<s> Thanks for your assistance. </s>

<s> While you can put ink into the printer cartridges and seal them, the problem you will run into is the chip that is on the cartridge. </s>
<s> The chip needs to be reset. </s>
<s> While you can buy the chip resetter, it runs between $200-$600. </s>
<s> Doesn't make it worth it for a home user. </s>
<s> There are reset printer cartridges out there for your printer. </s>
<s> You just need to look in the right places. </s>
<s> I do it. </s>
<s> Your printer program will give you a number of low ink warnings and it will eventually ask you to replace the cartridge or if you choose, you may override the safeguards and keep printing. </s>
<s> I haven't done it for a while, but you end up depressing one of the buttons on the machine to enable the override. </s>
<s> The final prompt will instruct you. </s>
<s> Just be careful that you periodically inspect the cartridge levels so you don't run out and damage the nozzles/print head. </s>
