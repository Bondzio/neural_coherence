<s> does anyone know if anyone makes gps chips/cards that work off a pcie expansion slot in a pc or laptop </s>
<s> Many are other connections such as USB, Serial and BlueTooth. </s>
<s> These are fungible items today so why would I want to push the costs up by going PCIe? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i have found through dint of hard experience that anything that sticks out of the computer can be broken, the port may be damaged, or both i want to keep the outside as neat as possible also </s>
<s> Get it internal or use the usual bluetooth unit. </s>
<s> I can only guess you know why you can't replace the internal radio (wifi/bluetooth/gps/cellular) cards yourself. </s>
<s> Do you remember why? </s>
<s> I don't want to upset you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i have one in my laptop now but i can't find anything telling me who made the chip every laptop maker except general dynamics told me they don't install them i can do the install myself if i can just get names so i can go to their website and check out what they have by the by the general dynamics laptops w/ the gps imbedded run $2000 or more </s>
<s> But it appears you are not aware why these can run from cheap to not cheap or why you usual can't retrofit unless you void the maker's warranty. </s>
<s> There are only a few GPS chip makers so that can't be your real question. </s>
<s> I'm fine if you just come out and ask but writing a tutorial about product testing, passing FCC certifications and more must be limited to one short paragraph. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> hunh? </s>
<s> what i'm asking is if there are gps chips available that can be added to directly to the mobo or inderectly by way of a pcie slot so i don't risk damaging it when it bounces around in a moving vehicle what does that have to do w/ fcc certs or anything else in your reply? </s>
<s> if you can help/answer my question great i drive for a living and having the chip in my computer makes planning my route/trip a lot easier so does finding the actual address of the customer at either end </s>
<s> You'll want to use a BlueTooth GPS unit for this. </s>
<s> I didn't reveal all but I am on a team that developed some GPS feature for a product I won't reveal. </s>
<s> As to what the FCC has to do with this is everything in this country. </s>
<s> You pass or you can't sell it. </s>
<s> Your question is one that would happen from folk that didn't know that. </s>
<s> I must keep all that testing and such stuff short so I'll stop again on that here. </s>
<s> So no, there is no chip for this. </s>
<s> If there was you would have found it. </s>
<s> But I have used those Bluetooth GPS units for setups that involve laptops. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> all that said now i know why thanks now my next question is there a particular usb/bt unit that you would recommend for what i'm doing i'm thinking(perhaps wrongly) of a unit that looks similar to at bt unifier like the one that comes w/ a bt mouse or will i have to get a unit that attaches to the vehicle somewhere then uses the bt to trasmit to the unifier in the port </s>
<s> But your everyday bluetooth in a laptop can talk to mouse, keyboard, headset and a BT GPS without any big issues. </s>
<s> So if someone wants to call that a unifier, let's let them. </s>
<s> BT GPS units are what we call FUNGIBLE. </s>
<s> When I need one I go to amazon.com and get another one. </s>
<s> We can get some militarized units for many thousand bucks but sales didn't happen so we just use the ones you find at amazon. </s>
<s> Plentiful, all seem to work fine so I don't supply exact models. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> sorry blonde moment i thought you were talking about the bt plugging into the usb the units from amazon ebay etc will be a unit that mounts to the outside of the vehicle and then talks to the computer using the built in bt chip and doesn't have the mini device type screen correct? </s>
<s> We rarely use an outside the cab solution as that would have the installer drill holes and more. </s>
<s> The simple bluetooth gps units we used are on amazon.com and sit somewhere inside the cab and get power from almost anywhere. </s>
<s> The power draw is very low. </s>
<s> Are you writing you use your laptop outside the cab area? </s>
<s> Isn't that a bit hard to drive in Winter? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> no the laptop is docked between the seats i was thinking the gps unit was attached to the roof with a magnet or something i've talked to the folks that make the one program that i use and they say that any unit will work w/ their software so i f i get an updated version of delorme to replace my older version then i'll be ok thanks for all the help and information have a good weekend </s>
<s> It's a standard that is found on all units so far. </s>
<s> My old delorme works fine with such devices. </s>
<s> -&gt; Yes there are some magnet mount and cable solutions but we deal with transit and have to install them a little more permanently but without incurring a lot of install time. </s>
