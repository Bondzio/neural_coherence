I have a broad band connection DSL and Ethernet switch.
My PC's and laptop can share the internet connection.
I want to share certain folders and the printer from the main computer.
All are running on WIN98se and have the same workgroup.
I have added sharing for both files and printer in &quot;Network neighbourhood&quot;.
However the computer is not available via search or &quot;Map Network Drive&quot; I have tried to give a PC the same name and it recognises that there is a computer with the same name and forbids it.
Please can you help or direct me to the information.
