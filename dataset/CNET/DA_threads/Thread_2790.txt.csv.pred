1.1.1	Hi, Our old computer was playing up (kept automatically restarting after about 30 seconds from the time of logging in) so we bought a new one and just left the old computer sitting there.	St
1.1.2	I wanted to find an old file on my old computer but since it hasn't been touched for a VERY long time, it won't turn on (the monitor turns on fine but no power goes to the actual computer).	St
1.1.3	I know it's not the power supply cos other things work and I'm considering removing the hard drive from the old computer and connecting it to the new one but I wanted to know first if the whole automatic restarting thing might affect our new computer if the old hard drive is connected to it.	St
1.1.4	If anyone can help, it would really be appreciated!	St
1.2.1	The USB hard drive housing.	St
1.2.2	They cost from 20 to 50 bucks and keep the owner out of the insides of a new machine.	St
