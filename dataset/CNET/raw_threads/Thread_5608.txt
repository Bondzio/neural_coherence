Anyway, this is the setup I'm most likely going with: Intel Core 2 Duo E6750 EVGA nForce 680i SLI NVIDIA Socket 775 ATX Motherboard 2x Corsair Dual Channel 1024MB PC6400 DDR2 800MHz EVGA GeForce 8800 GTS 640MB Western Digital Caviar SE16 500GB HDD Sony DRU830A CD/DVD Burner SILVERSTONE, FP34 Black Internal 26-in-1 Card Reader/Writer Drive OCZ GameXStream 700-Watt Power Supply Thermaltake Kandalf LCS Case Windows XP Professional That's what my list looks like at the moment, but I don't think it will be changing a whole lot. This is about what our budget will allow. Of course, you could always go with a less expensive case in order to get more memory, better gpu, or better cpu. Good luck.

Thirdly, nVidia and ATi are planning to release new graphics processors in about 5 or 6 months, replacing GeForce 8 and Radeon HD 2xxx. Also, theres no real advantage to having a Creative card (don't really care what anand says) over integrated audio, in regards to quality, performance, etc
