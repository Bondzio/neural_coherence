I have begun doing some research into it and would like to know: 1.) A good estimate of what building a moderate (2.0 ghz+, 40 gb, 512 RAM, etc..) computer WITHOUT including the cost of the monitor. 2.) I would also like to know more about the AMD Sempron compared to Athlon XP. Which one is the better choice? Compared to Intel, are the AMD chips a better deal for building moderate level computers? Thank You for your help!

Some first time builders power up the machine without the heatsink and fry the CPU. They take as much time to build as other machines. So the cost is similar. If you were looking for prices, they vary by country and more. You should try newegg or such if in the US. Bob

You do that at the usual websites like http://www.tomshardware.com But that's a fool's errand. Here's why. Selecting the &quot;best&quot; CPU and not understanding that hard disk and video can be a drag chute on the CPU's performance is always fun for me to watch. I've seem people fret over the CPU but miss their performance mark by putting in a substandard or recyclying their old video card. If I was to build a new machine today, I would start with the 64-bit capable CPU for a simple reason that I'd want that for the video work and Suse Linux. Bob

If your into games than this Cpu is right down your lane. When bundled with the right Video card and enough ram you will have a killer RIG. www.pricewatch.com Great site, get pretty much anything from here

Okay so you're running a 64bit processor there but not using 64 bits - hmmmm really efficient. The reason I know that you aren't using it is because - Windows XP isn't 64 bit ! Only now is Microsoft offering beta testing of Windows XP Pro 64 bit. And all the software available is 32 bit - all of them have to be recompiled for 64 bit when it comes out. Are you going to need 64 bit power ? Not really - nor is it neccessary. The majority of the power users will do just fine with the increased speed of a faster cpu and efficient running subsystems. Just a thought !
