<s> The AMD would be better. </s>
<s> 2 years ago a AMD XP 2800+ with a gig or ram would be a hot gaming PC. </s>

<s> But the components in your system are all outdated (except for the memory and you won't play high end games like DOOM 3 on this system, at least without lag. </s>
<s> I suggest wait a little until prices drop and you can build yourself a better system. </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> Might as well get a budget system from emachines. </s>
<s> Some have a x16 slot which is great for adding a high end graphics card later. </s>
