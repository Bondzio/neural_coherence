hi, i live in an old house, and i do not know how current the wiring is.
the outlets are all three prong grounded.
what i would appreciate knowing is, what should/can i do to protect my computer?
i am already using a dynex battery backup/uninterupted power supply.
the outlets on the ups that i am plugged into are marked &quot;surge/battery.&quot; there are three additional ones for &quot;surge&quot; only.
will this setup be sufficient, or do i need something else?
thank you,
