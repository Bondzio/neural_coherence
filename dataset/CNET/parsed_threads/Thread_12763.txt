<s> Last night I built a PC for the first time. </s>
<s> I think I was pretty methodical and made all the right connections. </s>
<s> When I turn on the computer, it seems like everything is fine. </s>
<s> It sees the graphics card, the CPU, the RAM, and both hard drives. </s>
<s> The dvd drive and the keyboard both work. </s>
<s> The 4 case fans all come on. </s>
<s> The CPU fan and the power supply fan both come on. </s>
<s> The interior blue lights come on. </s>
<s> Then, after about 40 seconds, it just shuts off. </s>
<s> No beeping, no error message... it just turns off. </s>
<s> It doesn't matter what it's doing at the time. </s>
<s> If I hit delete to go into the bios, while I'm in there it will just turn off. </s>
<s> Or if I let it boot from the Vista CD, it'll be on a screen with a progress bar saying &quot;Windows is loading files&quot;, it will get about a third of the way through the progress bar, and then shut off. </s>
<s> My biggest concern is that everything seems to be working perfectly and then it shuts down, and I don't know how I will find the problem. </s>
<s> Any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> My specs are as follows: Case: Antec Nine Hundred Motherboard: XFX nForce 780i SLI CPU: Core 2 Extreme Quad-Core QX9650 RAM: Patriot Extreme Performance 1066mhz PC2-8500 (4 x 1gb) Power Supply: Antec TruePower Quattro TPQ-1000 Graphics Card: XFX GeForce 8800 GTX Hard Drive: WD Raptor X 150gb Hard Drive: WD Velociraptor 300gb DVD Drive: LG SATA Super Multi DVD Rewriter 20x Sound Card: Sound Blaster X-Fi Xtreme Gamer Monitor: LG L227WTG-PF 22&quot; LCD Keyboard: Logitech G11 Mouse: Logitech MX 518 Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me solve this problem. </s>
<s> The owner didn't put on the heatsink compound. </s>
<s> They thought it was optional. </s>
<s> The instruction portion of the manual is just a series of pictures, and it didn't say anything about using a heatsink compound - there's no text to that effect, it's not represented in the pictures and no compound was provided in the packaging. </s>
<s> 1) Are you certain this is the problem? </s>
<s> 2) Have I done damage to the CPU, permanent or temporary? </s>
<s> 3) Once I put the compound on, will I be able to take the heatsink off again... is it like glue? </s>
<s> I ask this because I've taken the heatsink off about three times to make various connections in areas that I couldn't access when the heatsink was in place. </s>
<s> I apologize about my ignorance. </s>
<s> Thank you very much for the help. </s>
<s> I'm off to buy a heatsink compound. </s>
<s> I'll look for your response when I return. </s>
<s> Let's try google to learn about heatsink compound. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=DO+I+NEED+HEATSINK+COMPOUND%3F&btnG=Google+Search I think that covers it. </s>
<s> -&gt; ABOUT your supplied instructions there is an issue here. </s>
<s> If they supplied all the information then the costs go up and you risk infuriating those that build computers all the time. </s>
<s> Go light and your new builders may not know since they didn't take a class or ask. </s>
