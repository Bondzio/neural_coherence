15261	0	65319	775408	NR	Michael Samuele	2/19/05 2:10 AM	1.108779E12	transferring files to new iMac G5	Have an iMac 400DV, slot load, OS 9.2.2 that blew up. Logic board and analog board are toast. Repair removed hard drive, and determined data was recoverable. Now, have bought new iMac G5, 1.8, SD.and would like to transfer some files from old HD if possible. Backup was current to 2 weeks before crash and burn. What is best way to grab files from old HD? Do I need an enclosure for old HD as well as cable? Thanks for help.

Other World Computing sell a nice one for about $60. It comes, as they all do, with the necessary Firewire cable and instructions. As you are using OS X, no drivers are necessary. Just put the old drive in the enclosure. Connect the Firewire cable at both ends and power up the enclosure. Within seconds, your old HD will appear on the desktop, ready for you to drag your old DATA files to the new machine. Do NOT drag the Application files to the new machine, they will NOT work, but you knew that anyway. It's a really easy fix and you have the external drive for extra storage later. Hope this helps P

I got a firewire external drive enclosure from OWC and everything works like a charm. Thanks again for the great help. Michael
