1.1.1	Hi I recently got a TL-R470T+ I got it running with one modem with a dd-wrt router hooked up with it.	St
1.1.2	I'm trying to get my pepwave on the go to help speed up the internet a bit my neighbor let me use his wifi .	St
1.1.3	So I'm trying to hook up both to work and I can't seem to get it to work.	St
1.1.4	The pepwave and the modem work well by them selves but I cant get both of them to work.	St
1.1.5	Can I get some help please.	St
1.2.1	It's not clear from your post.	St
1.3.1	Hard to answer generic problems like this.	St
1.3.2	The short answer is you have to read the manual and configure you r470.	St
1.3.3	There is no standard solution for load balancing, each vendor does it their own way.	St
1.3.4	I suspect you need to make sure your IP addresses blocks are not overlapping.	St
1.3.5	As general comment...internet speed will not increase just because you use this.	St
1.3.6	The only thing it can fix is if you were at 100% utilization of your primary link and you were going to offload traffic to the neighbors.	St
1.3.7	You cannot combine the circuits to increase the bandwidth just by placing a box on one end.	St
