1.1.1	I just switched from 98SE to XP-PRO and I'm having trouble setting up my Visioneer 7600 Parallel Port Scanner.	St
1.1.2	I'm using Paperport 8 and the software seems to work but the driver doesn't seem to work correctly.	St
1.1.3	First: I have a P4, XP-PRO, 256MB Ram and two hard drives.	St
1.1.4	I tried the compatibility wizard and the program just crashed.	St
1.1.5	Without the compatibility mode the program works with older scans completely but when I try to scan or preview an image the program does some funny things.	St
1.1.6	It will start the scan and never quit making multiple copies of the image and I can't close the scan window.	St
1.1.7	Is anyone running this setup?	Ques
1.1.8	Do I have to upgrade (buy new) my scanner?	St
1.1.9	Thanks in advance, Denny	St
1.2.1	Visioneer does not support any of their parallel port scanners with XP, PERIOD.	St
1.2.2	I have had a few clients that were burned by this, Visioneer just decided it wasn't worth it.	St
1.2.3	You need to buy a new scanner if you want to run XP.	St
1.2.4	Fortunately USB scanners are under $100.	St
1.3.1	Parallel port devices are losing support all over.	St
1.3.2	For much less that 100USB you find complete units like (excuse the vendor link) http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=HPSJ4400C-N which includes updated software to use with your updated OS.	St
1.3.3	Bob PS.	St
1.3.4	I have a few HP scanners and they seem OK.	St
1.4.1	Thanks for your advice.	St
1.4.2	I went to Sam's Club and bought a OneTouch 9220 Visioneer and it is working wonderfully.	St
1.4.3	I stuck with Visioneer because I like the Paperport 8 software.	St
1.4.4	The scanner is 4800 x 2400 and it only cost $80.	St
1.4.5	It was worth the cost to get rid of the headache with the compatibility problems.	St
1.4.6	I'm almost up to par with the XP configuration and so far(although a lot of work) I like it better.	St
1.4.7	Thanks again, Denny	St
