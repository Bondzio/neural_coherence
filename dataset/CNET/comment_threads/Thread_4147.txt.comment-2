I have Radeon Ati 9700 and it comes with driver installers and software combined CD.
The computer relies on windows drivers through the PCI until told otherwise.
It could be that either you have not installed Ati drivers properly, or whatever version of Ati is in conflict with windows.
What does 'roll back drivers' do if you have a version of XP?
