<s> Windows 7 Using a WD My Book Essentials external HD & I'm trying to access my photos on it. </s>
<s> Trouble is, when I see the thumbnails, they've all got this generic picture on them & clicking on them gets me this pop up message telling me I don't have the correct permissions to access this file location. </s>
<s> How do I fix/ change this? </s>

<s> This is a real pain. </s>
<s> I've checked several of the links, & had Googled around & most said the same thing: Right-click on the folder/file, security tab, owner tab, add the name, etc, etc. </s>
<s> Did it all. </s>
<s> Still won't open the files. </s>
<s> I managed to open *one* photo. </s>
<s> But I Know I don't want to have to do one at a time. </s>
<s> Why did this happen in the 1st place & why is it so difficult to just enable what I need? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> How and from where did you save the photos to the drive? </s>
<s> IE, the entire drive. </s>
<s> Sorry about this being that way. </s>
<s> Blame the idea that we can have permissions and more. </s>
