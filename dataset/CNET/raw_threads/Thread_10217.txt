Can i upgrade the dell E521 to a geforce 9500GT from the onboard crappy graphics? The dell forums says its absolutely ok and the power supply will handle the card. the card needs a min of 350W with 18A on +12V rails. But the dell supply is 305W nd has 18A on the 12V rails. Is it possible? Or should i settle for a 8600GT? Pls I need ur help Thank U!

Go get a Watt meter like the P3 http://www.p3international.com/products/special/P4400/P4400-CE.html Armed with that, measure just the machine's Watt usage and if we want to be conservative if the draw is under 150 or 50% of that 305 Watts then I'd go wtih the 9500GT. HOWEVER in one day I'll be able to measure the draw of the HD 3650 which I chose off this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2118.html I can't find the 9500GT on that list.

Not your exact card but I installed the following replaced a this with that and here's the Watt readings of the entire PC before and after. Said PC is a common Core 2 Duo, 2GB RAM, single HD, single DVDRW. Before: Nvidia FX5700 256MB AGP 8X = 105 Watts running Doom After: ATI HD 3650 512 AGP 8X = 135 Watts running Doom If your machine taps as much as mine that 305 Dell Watt PSU should be fine with this type card.
