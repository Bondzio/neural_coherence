If I had a cable modem to my switch and to the house, then not much would work proper.
If I wired my cable modem to the router, then router to switch to the house, then that's the common working setup.
I will not help people with the first setup since that's their choice and their headache.
I hope you understand why.
To place the printer on the proper network, you need a PC that shares the printer or one of Dlink/Linksys's printer sharing boxes.
Your choice.
