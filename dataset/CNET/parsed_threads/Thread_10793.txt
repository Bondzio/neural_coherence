<s> I would use this machine as a proxy but.. i have no idea how to config the pc to do it (thats new to me) any help anyone? </s>
<s> It sounds like you need to read and use what you learn about ICS from http://www.wown.com I can't help you because you may have a firewall installed and that is beyond what support I offer. </s>
<s> Many can't control their firewall and as such I withdraw any firewall support. </s>
<s> Besides Zonelabs deserves that priviledge. </s>
<s> In short, set up ICS and control that firewall. </s>
<s> As to cheap routers, the cheapest was 10 dollar belkin unit on sale. </s>
<s> My Wifi-G Dlink router was 25 bucks from compgeeks (plus some shipping) so deals are out there. </s>
