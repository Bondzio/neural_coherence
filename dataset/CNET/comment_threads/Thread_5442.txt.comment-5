something like adaware (you can download it at download.com) or ccleaner.
And ccleaner has a nice feature where you can go thru your startup in the tools section (they don't put them in your startup folder anymore), and individually remove startup processes.
Careful not to remove your antivirus or anything like that though.
Best to open up Google and do a search on each process, and see what it tells ya.
