<s> My onboard network interface card hasn't been working for a while. </s>
<s> Its MAC address gets disabled in the BIOS menu. </s>
<s> When I enable it and restart the PC, the BIOS first shows an error message, which passes too fast to read, and then reboots with the MAC address disabled. </s>
<s> Also, when the pc shuts down, all the keyboard leds remain lit. </s>
<s> And if I turn on the PC when the leds are lit, the pc boots but does not respond to anything from the keyboard. </s>
<s> If I unplug the PC and plug it again and turn on the PC, the leds are off and the keyboard works fine. </s>
<s> Now, I am suspecting two things: Either the motherboard is dying or my cheap PSU (300W peak) is causing issues. </s>
<s> http://extreme.outervision.com/PSUEngine says for my system, the minimum PSU power is 282W and the recommended PSU power is 332W. </s>
<s> Can this be a PSU problem, or can it be something else? </s>
<s> Pushing a power supply is bad luck. </s>
<s> And what they don't tell you is that a 300W PEAK PSU will not do 300W for long. </s>
<s> Also as it ages (just a year) it loses capacity. </s>
<s> Is there any card or device like some hard drives or a second CD/DVD you can remove to lighten the load? </s>

<s> The keyboard problem doesn't occur if I use a usb keyboard instead of a ps/2. </s>
<s> I removed the optical drives, floppy disk and PCI cards. </s>
<s> I left only the sata disk and PCIe video card. </s>
<s> The keyboard problem didn't occur then. </s>
<s> But the onboard nic problem didn't change. </s>
<s> The PSU is a 5 year old one that came with the Aopen case. </s>
<s> There doesn't seem to be something physically wrong with the motherboard, at least visually. </s>
<s> I'm going to look for a decent PSU and then see what happens. </s>
<s> At 5 years all electrolytic capacitors are suspect. </s>
<s> That 300W PSU is assured to not be able to put out that much. </s>
<s> And we are talking about a 5 year old PC so it would be proper to have to disable a balky onboard NIC and install some PCI card to stand in. </s>
<s> However you will encounter tech's that will try anything to avoid that. </s>
<s> Go figure. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I bought a 420W PSU and now the keyboard problem is gone. </s>
<s> The onboard NIC issue hasn't changed. </s>
<s> And a day after I installed the new PSU a strange thing happened. </s>
<s> Out of blue, Windows stopped responding and the PC started making an incessant beeping sound. </s>
<s> So I shut it down using the power button. </s>
<s> The next time I turned the PC on the BIOS stopped loading at &quot;initializing usb&quot; (I looked up the hexadecimal code on the motherboard led dispay). </s>
<s> This only stopped happening when I unplugged the printer from USB port. </s>
<s> Such a thing did not happen again. </s>
<s> I'm using the printer just fine. </s>
<s> Everything seems to be normal. </s>
<s> I guess the problem is solved for now. </s>
<s> If you don't use it, why fix it? </s>
<s> But PCI NIC cards are really cheap. </s>
