I have had this computer since 2004 and I am surprised how long it has been before I attempted to put an expansion card or look for more RAM. I bought an expansion card recently and I don't think it fits. I did not know there were different kinds, so now I need to know which expansion cards will fit into a Compaq SR1053WM. And obviously RAM chips are not the same type either. What is the name or whatever for the type of RAM Chip and Expansion Slot that Compaq SR1053WM uses??

Now that I have the memory chip, how do I install it?? I know it just can't be as easy as inserting it while computer is turned off and unplugged; I am sure there has to be come kind of software configuration or something like that. The expansion slots are called PCI. But My computer has some other kind of expansion slot. It has 3 white slots I have identified as PCI slots, but there is a mysterious brown colored expansion slot. It is wierd. I was sure that the PCI device would not fit...but it fit?? and it is working perfectly!! So I don't think I will have any problems with adding new PCI cards. I moved recently and not unpacked yet, but I am sure that online manuals for Compaq SR1053WM is not difficult to find...And I might even find the answer of how to install a memory chip.....and also what the name of the brown expansion slot is...

After reading about setting timings, It sounds very important but I am even more confused...I found another topic on the message boards about this one person with a completely customized computer and had 2 different types of timings and that resulted in crashes. This new chip will be 2 of 2 chips because that is what my present motherboard has. It only has 2 slots. How do I read what the timings are on my existing chip to make sure they are the same as the additional chip?? Which timings are the most recommended...?? I do not know the name of the motherboard. It is just whatever usually came with a SR1053WM machine.

That person's motherboard has Intel processor. Mine is AMD. I am not sure, but that part might have been important.

If you get a video card you would need to get one that runs in the AGP slot not PCIe. Your Compaq specifications say you have a AGP 8x slot Go back to crucial and run their scan. This will tell you the specifications for the RAM you need. You must get RAM that meets these specifications. Print them out and take them to the store you intend to buy the RAM from they will know what you will need. From the specifications from Compaq we can find this much information about your RAM: PC2700 MB/sec 184 pin, DDR1-333 SDRAM Here is the scan: http://www.crucial.com/store/drammemory.aspx About your PC hardware: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00088950&cc=us&dlc=en&lc=en&jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN#N323
