<s> Im purchasing a full system soon (within a month), but Im caught up with which motherboard to get and which RAM to purchase. </s>
<s> As I wont be purchasing parts to often I was interested in getting a DDR3 board and DDR3 RAM (for future compatibility), though I know the RAM is ridiculously priced at the moment and currently only provides little advantage over some cheaper high end DDR2 RAM. </s>
<s> I was originally set on a motherboard and RAM but have changed my mind since, was considering a (Gigabyte GA-X48T-DQ6) which only supported DDR3 and was looking at purchasing (Corsair Twin3X 4096MB 240-pin DDR3 1333Mhz). </s>
<s> Though after looking around I read that this RAM would provide little performance gain. </s>
<s> Then also considered purchasing faster (1600) RAM but only 2GBs worth, and later purchasing an additional 2 sticks of RAM when cheaper. </s>
<s> I have read that the DDR3 Ram prices are to drop towards the end of the year but unfortunately I will be unable to w8 that long (I do not have a desktop atm and I need to buy one soon). </s>
<s> Ive also recently considering purchasing a board with DDR3 and DDR2 (preferably 4 DDR3 slots and 2 DDR2 slots) such as the (ASUS P5KC LGA775 P35) and buying 4 GBs of DDR2 and later purchasing DDR3. </s>
<s> But the boards which are DDR2 and DDR3 (which I have seen) only support RAM up to 1333 which is the speed of RAM I was going to originally purchase (Corsair Twin3X 4096MB 240-pin DDR3 1333Mhz) but was turned off because it only had that small performance gain. </s>
<s> So please any help that could be provided on what to purchase which board, RAM, etc would be much appreciated (also purchasing intel E8400 for the record). </s>
<s> Currently using http://www.auspcmarket.com.au/ for pricing (also because I live in/next to ACT no to many places I can purchase parts from). </s>
<s> Sorry for the amount of writing/rambling. </s>
<s> The speed gain is going to be there but not bang for the buck. </s>
<s> You can take your dollars for the change to DDR3 and get a better video card and then the payoff works. </s>
<s> later DDR3 if that becomes economical or advantageous. </s>
