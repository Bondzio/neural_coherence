It appears you have an ATX type powered system.
All you need is to &quot;momentarily&quot; hit the ON/OFF sw. for it to turn on.
If you keep depressing the sw., it will start to shutdown.
That's normal for the system to do.
The only thing I can think if it doesn't do this prorperly is a flaky sw. or one that gets stuck/sticky.
These are simple sw. and shouldn't cause problems.
I suggest maybe a quick squirt of WD-40 or similar at the sw. area if a sticky button, otherwise replace sw. if determined to be bad.
good luck -----Willy
