<s> Hi, I have a vertical Red line that you can see through on my Dell 20inch LCD. </s>
<s> The line comes on after few minutes of turning on the monitor. </s>
<s> Would this be most likely the monitor or the video card? </s>
<s> Is the only way to check by plugging the pc to a different monitor? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> You didn't give the model number so I can't find if this has it's own self test. </s>
<s> Have you recently added this a new video card or updated video drivers? </s>
<s> If not its probably the monitor. </s>
<s> If you have it is probably one of those. </s>
<s> Connecting your monitor to a new PC is best bet, but plugging another monitor to your PC would also work. </s>
