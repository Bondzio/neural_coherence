i bought an hp pc about a year ago and ive changed so many parts in it because my power supply was so bad it basicly fried my cpu when i bought a new ultra psu to accommodate power for the new video card i bought, a nvdia 7900 gto that needed 400 watts so i bought a 600 watt ultra and it fired my amd x2 3800+.
i ended buying a new mobo, cpu (i love core 2 duo ^^ havent liked intel till now lol), new ram cuz my old ram wasnt dd2.
i even bought a new monitor =).
anyway my only part left from my old hp is my hard drive, a 250 gb samsung.
i had a pvr pci card that look almost exactly like a wintv pvr 500  is the link ive tried downloading every driver from hauppage site
