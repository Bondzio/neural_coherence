Well maybe if I tell you why I want to do this it might help.
Win98 drive has problems and I do not have any of the software because I bought it second had.
WinME ran fine and I have all of the software from when I purchased it.
The WinME does not have any burners but the Win98 does.
So I thought if I took the WinME drive and put it in the tower of the Win98 I could boot from the WinME and use the Win98 as extra storage.
But I do not kown how to get it to boot from the d (WinME) instead of the c (Win98).
I think you might undersand now why I am trying to do this.
