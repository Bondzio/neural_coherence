<s> hey everyone, I've had my core 2 duo 6300 for a few months now and i've been messing around with overclocking it because i want to get as much out of it as i can. </s>
<s> i heard online that one guy got his 6600 core 2 from 2.4 GHz to over 3.0 GHz, and it was outperforming a core extreme. </s>
<s> i have the ability to overclock in the BIOS, but im kind of nervous about it. </s>
<s> without overclocking, my CPU runs at about 96 degrees f. when i overclocked it to 2.14 Ghz (from 1.86), the temp. </s>
<s> rose to about 103. i dont know how far i should go right now because i still have the stock fan (i dont think it was running at MAX, but still). </s>
<s> i plan on getting a new fan pretty soon, but until then, what temperature should i stop at? </s>
<s> i was guessing around 115, but that may be way too hot. </s>
<s> any suggestions? </s>
<s> Also, the BIOS has the option to change the voltage. </s>
<s> Right now it is on AUTO, but i have heard that you also need to up the voltage if you overclock...will AUTO take care of that or not? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>

<s> 115f should not be a problem with that CPU. </s>
<s> You can easily overclock this processor merely by raising the FSB and adding a tenth of a volt to the core to aid stability (you'll need to switch out of AUTO). </s>
<s> Make sure the RAM and FSB are unlinked so you don't overclock the RAM when upping the FSB. </s>
<s> Best to overclock in small increments, run something like Prime95 to check for stability, and keep an eye on the temps. </s>
<s> i will try that. </s>
<s> is there a good free program i can use to monitor the temp while windows is running because right now i have to monitor it in the BIOS hardware monitor. </s>
<s> thanks -zak- </s>

<s> You should have PC Probe on your motherboard CD, or you can download it here: http://www.techspot.com/downloads/265-asus-pc-probe.html </s>

<s> The software that you have to check the temp is it taking the reading from Bios. </s>
<s> One thing they say about Bios, it does not lie. </s>
<s> I reboot and go to Bios to check my temp. </s>
<s> Motherboard Monitor is a good software to check your system. </s>
