hmmm i might have explained myself wrongly!
k so this is it, i work off an apple power mac as a video editor so i cannot really afford to clog up my apples hard drive as it will slow it down to such an extent that i cannot edit anymore, this is why i am working off the lacie's - no other choice really!
i will also add that i have tried cleaning the trash after i moved a specific file from the lacie to the trash and in the process did lose that file but its size in megs is still on the lacie (the file is gone but i cant seem to recover the megs that this file took when it was on the drive) i hope this is more clear?!
it surely is a strange situation and any help would be greatly appreciated!
thank you!
