and see what that shows about the CPU options and their performance with ganes and other apps.
2GBs DDR400 is fairly cheap if the games in question load and run faster with 2GB vs 1 GB.
The other thing is there are some 'transition' MB ..like the one from ASRock VSTA (see review at Anandtech.com) that allows you to run a Conroe with DDR, DDR2, AGP or PCIe.
And it's very modestly priced.
