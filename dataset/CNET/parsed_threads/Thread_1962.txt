<s> I am going from an 5 year old AMD Athlon 64 3000+ to either an I5 or I7. </s>
<s> I am not a gamer or video editor. </s>
<s> Because I am going from an IDE hard drive to SATA Best Buy says I must use a device called Black Widow to transfer my files. </s>
<s> Is this true? </s>
<s> I tried the online backup system but all it did was bang my hard drive every few minutes. </s>
<s> Any comments on I5 or I7 would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I am not really Miserable, but I couldn't use any of my usual names to sign up and there used to be a guy who came to a bar I went to and we called him Miserable Joe. </s>
<s> but you can get an external drive enclosure for your ide drive for about $20: http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?InvtId=ENCL-1P&cpc=RESX install your old hard drive, copy over the files you want, and then use it as an extra hard drive until it dies. </s>
<s> What about LapLink PC Mover software? </s>
