no, it can't be any of these things, i have tried several psu's, and the current is for a pentium 4, so there should be no problems there, and the case has 4 case fans and a better than stock fan/heasink, so my cpu is only 40oc, i was given an idea about hard disk rotation speed, any more ideas?
no leaks capacitors e.t.c
