I'm looking to replace a PC that's recently died on me, and am looking to get the best possible machine (just the base unit) for under 1,000 (around $1,500). I've come across this http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/PC-Intel-Core-i7-930-12gb-500GB-ATI-5450-1gb-DX11-HDMI-/150492224411?pt=UK_Computing_DesktopPCs&hash=item230a091b9b which looks like a good deal to me, but I'm not very well educated on the quality of internal components. i7 930 + 12gb DDR3 = Good | That's the extent of my analysis Thanks guys!
