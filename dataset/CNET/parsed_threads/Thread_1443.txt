<s> hi, a couple of months ago i brought a game (pro evolution soccer 2008). </s>
<s> long story short i had to physicaly lower the ram of my pc as the game refused to run on the higher settings (thanks for that Konami). </s>
<s> i followed instructions from a PES forum and changed from 4 gig to 3 gig recognized. </s>
<s> now i want to put my pc back to its full operation capacity (game got boring, wanna hurt Crysis now) but i can't remember how to change the memory back! </s>
<s> looked on the forums but the thread i used has gone, could someone please HELP!!!! </s>
