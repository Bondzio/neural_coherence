<s> I've been looking for a wireless network camera. </s>
<s> Today I went down to my local computer store and purchase a Linksys Wireless-B 2.4GHz Video Camera. </s>
<s> The picture was crappy. </s>
<s> I'm returning it tomorrow. </s>
<s> This is basically for my home. </s>
<s> I want an indoor camera that I can sit in the window to monitor outside. </s>
<s> Can you guys help me out? </s>
<s> I'm willing to spend up to $800 on a camera and software. </s>
<s> I would like features such as panning, zooming, motion detection, save to hard drive and remote monitoring to name a few. </s>
<s> How are Toshiba and Panasonic? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> The Panasonic IP camera is very nice. </s>
<s> I will not know any prices, but the CCTV models from Panasonic give the usual TV quality or a little less. </s>
<s> What some expect are digital camera quality. </s>
<s> But that's not going to happen at 352xsuch pixels. </s>
<s> That pixel cound is OK for TV, but PC users will revolt at the terrible pictures. </s>
<s> Another option is a 60 buck camaera and capture card like this... http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=802C-200MW-N&cat=VID http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=SEC400A&cat=VID You might find some USB capture dongle, but the framerate will be what it will be. </s>

<s> I thought about going in this direction. </s>
<s> Would the capture card and software provide me the ability to modify the picture? </s>
<s> What is the advantage? </s>
<s> &quot;Pictures&quot; can be modified and have been for years. </s>
<s> Maybe you meant something else. </s>
<s> The advantage is what you suspect. </s>
<s> I will not &quot;sell&quot; you this solution, but have some background in CCTV designs and can share the the Linksys camera has a flaw that knocked it out of the running for CCTV application. </s>
<s> It wasn't the picture quality since even at its worst, it can be better than some old tape systems. </s>
<s> Here's where it failed. </s>
<s> We set it up and began its recording. </s>
<s> Then we pull the power from the camera, waited a few minutes and put the power back into the camera. </s>
<s> The PC software never recovered. </s>
<s> This would be unacceptable for CCTV applications. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm not looking for you to sell me anything but rather would like to know why you suggest it. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Just sharing a solution I know about that cures some issues. </s>
<s> And it's very cheap compared to other setups. </s>
