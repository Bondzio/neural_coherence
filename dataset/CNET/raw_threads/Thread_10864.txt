I just got a Gigabyte EP45-UD3P motherboard, and was going to install an OEM splash screen, using the included utility that came with the motherboard. I ran the utility, and Windows bluescreened on me. When I turn it on, the computer says: Award BootBlock BIOS v1.0 Copyright (c) 2000, Award Software, Inc. and then it just hangs. Any tips? It won't do anything from there.
