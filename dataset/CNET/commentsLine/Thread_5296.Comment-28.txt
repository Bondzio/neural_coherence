i've just installed w7 on one of my old pcs,so this should give you a good comparison between the option of buying a new pc or upgrading an old one.my pc had a cpu of 2.6mhz,so i just needed to upgrade the ram to 1.24gb,cost 21.the w7 installation disk was 168,after the install i had to spend 60,on a gforce graphics card (256mb)to get the benefits of the aero 3d and directx applications.this system works perfect,but as you can see it wasn't cheap.249.obviously i don't know the cost of the pc you are thinking to buy,but the intergrated 256mb graphics is good enough for your gaming requirements.
