Any ideas of how to correct this

If this has only just begun, recently then you might use a restore point to revert it to a time before the problem began. If it started immediately when you started the computer for the first time then your stuck with it. If these three approaches fail, live with it or reinstall the OS. If you take this drastic approach to fix the problem make sure the OS installation disk is clean and not scratched before you load it. I do not believe this is a problem with your build. This is an OS glitch. If this is the only problem your having then good work on your new computer. No OS was been specified. This would have been helpful.
