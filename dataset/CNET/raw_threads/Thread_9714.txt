I hope this is in the right area, if not, please let me know which area to re-post this thread. Thank You. Please excuse the length as I'm including everything that happened up to this point as I don't know what will be useful and what isn't. My computer died about 8 months after I got it and sent it back to Compaq because it was still under warranty. They said the hard drive had gone bad and replaced it. When I came back, it was working fine, well, for about 2 months. I had downloaded VLC Media player and was using it to play music, A had highlighted a few songs and right clicked open with VLC. VLC opened every song I had in my library at the same time in and each time it opened each song in a new player (expl; for each song it opened a new player to play the song) This froze my computer and I had to hard boot. After the hard boot I went to blue screen. After reading some forums, Most of the info said that other people who had this problem had burned out their RAM. So I changed my RAM. But While I was changing it out I upgraded it from 512MB X2 to 1GB x2. I did research on the RAM before I bought it and was told the new RAM was compatible. After the new RAM was installed, The first thing I noticed was in the Bios It was still detecting 512MB X2. After that it go to the start-up menu (Start windows in safe mode; safe mode with networking, normally, etc.) I've tried all the options and it always goes to blue screen. I downloaded a XP System Restore disk and tried booting from CD, it starts just fine but the goes to &quot;Examining 238473 MB disk 0 at id 0 on bus 0 on nvatabus...&quot; The hard drive is 250GB so that might be right, I'm not sure. But the BootCD just stops there... Nothing Else... What's the Problem??? What do I need to do? Please educate me... Joel

5400	2	330372	2979719	2979720	styleisdead	2/14/09 4:34 PM	1.23462924E12	???	??? Just to clarify... Are saying that I got the wrong RAM? I'm pretty sure I got the DDR2 DIMM 5300 1GB. Which said it was backward compatible with the DDR2 DIMM 4200 512MB that my computer came with. So, my computer needs the 4200 and is not compatible with other RAM? OR I just happened to get bad RAM and this is one of the errors that can result from bad memory? Sorry, I can be a little dense if things aren't spelled out for me... Thanks for the quick reply Joel
