I took my hard drive to school ( we use Macs OS 10), and the Mac would not recognize my drive. The drive is supposed to be multi-platform. How would I partition my drive so that both Macs and PCs recognize the drive? Thanks!

Also, If I were to partition my drive on a Mac (OS 10), what format would I partition it so that both platforms, Windows xp and OS 10, both recognize my drive? Thanks!
