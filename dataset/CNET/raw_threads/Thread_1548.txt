If you buy a pci express graphics card and plug it into the pci express port on your motherboard and install all the drivers will it work? I have a asus m2v-mx motherboard with 1GB ram, 250GB HDD, AMD X2, alot of case fans and Windows XP SP2. I bought and installed a GeForce 7300GS and all the drivers are up to date. When I do anything 3D with the computer from games to CAD software the computer restarts after 2 seconds. The only way to do anything 3D on my computer is to use my onboard graphics which is really bad. Is it a compatibility problem between The GeForce and my mother board? Or is it a defective graphics card? Or is the GeForce 7300 not very good? please help me!
