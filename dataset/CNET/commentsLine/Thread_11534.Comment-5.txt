the video stabilization is not something that needs to be turned off in imovie, it is off by default.
to stabilize a piece of video there are a number of steps to got through before it does its thing.
not sure what is happening with the apple site for you with windows 7, i'll check with a winbox here, only xp, and see if i have the same problem.
just checked, works fine in xp with ie and firefox.
try it with firefox and see if you get the same result.
