almost always jumpered &quot;cs&quot;.... so placement on cable determined whether they were assigned as master or slave in the bios.
if placed at the very end of a 3 connector cable....the drive was seen by the system as master...if placed in the middle...the drive was seen as slave.
here's a link that describes the differences in the cables and confirms my experience with both types.
by the way it's 40 pin 80 wire cable with only 39 of the pins used.
if you've tried all the possibilities ...maybe the mb or the drive controller is defective.
perhaps a secondary controller would solve the problem if that's what you're trying to resolve.
