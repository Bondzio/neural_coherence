The Sony &quot;Half Height is becoming unrealable. Newwegg has one that I thought may work. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?item=N82E16827106027 If not any suggestions?

Don't know what half height is.
13689	3	222209	2341641	2341471	ramarc	12/7/06 4:40 PM	1.1655096E12	practically all dvd drives are half-height	there are some slim drives intended for use in laptops, but the rest are half-height.
