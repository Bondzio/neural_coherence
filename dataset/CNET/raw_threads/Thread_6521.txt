Hello All, A couple of days ago my mouse was freezing up and I would reboot and it would work. Well now it will not work at all. I have tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it and everytime I try to add the device it says Windows was unable to exchange passkeys with your device. The device has indicated a passkey failure. You may have entered an incorrect passkey or the time to enter the passkey might have expired. and it says to try again... Well, it won't even let me put the passkey in before this pops up.... Does anyone have any ideas what is going on??? Is the mouse going bad???? The keyboard still works fine(also bluetooth).... Any help would be greatly appreciated..... Thanks Flu Oh yea...

I uninstalled the mouse and then added it again and picked No Passkey instead of letting it pick one for me....and it worked fine... Crazy when it is something that simple. Thanks for trying though.... Flu

Did you follow the logitech directions at logitech.com? For example I didn't read where you press a connect button. &quot;Logitech keyboards and mice are in discoverable mode when you press the 'Connect' button located on the bottom.&quot;
