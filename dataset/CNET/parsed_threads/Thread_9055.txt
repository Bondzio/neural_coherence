<s> First of all, thanks for taking the time to read this. </s>
<s> Background: I have a Linksys 802.11b wireless router from an Earthlink DSL modem. </s>
<s> About a year ago, a bright young woman from CompUSA set-up a wireless network between my old Gateway PII 350 desktop (WIN 98) and newer laptop (Fujitsu E7010, Win XP home). </s>
<s> Everything was working wonderfully and then I bought a new laptop (Compaq Win XP). </s>
<s> I only wanted to access the internet at home and was not having any problems until I took the computer to Frys (local electronics store). </s>
<s> I was sitting in the caf and tried to logon to the wireless network there I couldnt get internet access. </s>
<s> Probably because there wasnt a free network there. </s>
<s> When I came home I keep getting the limited /no connectivity when trying to get on my own network. </s>
<s> When I attempt to repair the connection, I keep getting the error regarding unable to renew IP address. </s>
<s> The Compaq will connect to the internet when I use the Ethernet cable however. </s>
<s> I have recently switched to Firefox, downloaded Spybot, and installed Norton antivirus, but I wasnt having any problems until coming home from Frys. </s>
<s> Ive tried: 1. </s>
<s> 1) Is the SSID set to be broadcasted? </s>
<s> 2) Check for MAC filtering. </s>
<s> It's the drivers in my case. </s>
<s> Another card and it works. </s>
<s> This is not a hardware issue, but the quality of the drivers. </s>
<s> A reboot works. </s>
<s> But if I release and renew, its dead. </s>
<s> Lesson for me? </s>
<s> Don't do that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> M.G., Thanks for your reply -- how do I check these things? </s>
<s> Are they on the router or the new laptop? </s>
<s> I'm assuming the new laptop, since the old laptop seems to work well wirelessly. </s>

<s> Bob, Thanks for the tip, but I'm still a novice -- by drivers do you mean repairing XP, re-installing XP, or figuring out the driver for the integrated wireless card in my laptop (which I'm not sure if I know where that would be)? </s>
<s> chris </s>
<s> are within the setup program of the router. </s>
<s> Your manual will tell how to access it from your PC. </s>
<s> Bob does make the point that connection problems are often fixed by using the latest firmware for the router and again this is in the manual. </s>
<s> In my example (a card I own) the issue is the card's drivers. </s>
<s> Since there will never be a fix, I have choices. </s>
<s> Complain about it. </s>
<s> Don't release and renew. </s>
<s> Use it since it works anyway. </s>
<s> How can I share this? </s>
<s> You can't fix it unless you go with some other make/model and theirs works. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> That happened to a couple of laptops I was working on. </s>
<s> I'm assuming you don't have a secure network. </s>
<s> On one of them, I simply went to the system restore's earlier time (before things started happening). </s>
<s> I then &quot;renewed&quot; (repaired) the ipaddress and it worked just fine. </s>
<s> On another laptop, we actually had to send the laptop back to the manufacturer to get it working. </s>
<s> The laptop lost its ability to &quot;repair&quot; after the user intalled SP2. </s>
<s> On the first laptop I worked on started having problems after updating the system from IBM. </s>
<s> My suggestion is that you don't update OS and it looks like you know know how to secure your system without SP2. </s>
<s> Good Luck! </s>
