<s> Ok, so this is a problem I have had with my net book. </s>
<s> I can get on the Internet easily, but their is a problem. </s>
<s> One problem is that when I close my net book, and then open it up later, the Internet doesn't work. </s>
<s> The other problem is that I clearly have an Internet connection, but I can't do anything that involves Java, because when I try to download the newest Java, it says that I don't have enough Internet connection, even though my connection strength is excellent. </s>
<s> Any help on how to fix this would be great, thanks. </s>
<s> The Java issue is likely because it's using some web installer. </s>
<s> Folk install all manner of &quot;protection&quot; which breaks these things so let's get the full Java installer. </s>
<s> The link I've given will break later so you'll have to find it again if you post too late. </s>

<s> Ok, I did that, and it let me download it. </s>
<s> But there's still a problem. </s>
<s> Whenever I try to load something that needs Java, it says error, and when I click on the error, it says this: Java Plug-in 1.6.0_27 Using JRE version 1.6.0_27-b07 Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM User home directory = C:\Documents and Settings\Zach ---------------------------------------------------- c: clear console window f: finalize objects on finalization queue g: garbage collect h: display this help message l: dump classloader list m: print memory usage o: trigger logging q: hide console r: reload policy configuration s: dump system and deployment properties t: dump thread list v: dump thread stack x: clear classloader cache 0-5: set trace level to &lt;n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------- load: class net.minecraft.Launcher not found. </s>
