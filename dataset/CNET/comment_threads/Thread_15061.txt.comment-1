I have a pretty good computer right now but I feel that there are some problem spots that need to be looked at.
Specs: ATI 4870hd Intel e6750 2.66Ghz 4mb cashe G.Skill 8g's ram western digital hd's asus p5k-se 600w powersupply I have about 250 dollars to spend right now and I was really looking to upgrade my e6750 because it might be bottlenecking my graphics card.
What im having problems with is what to do with that money.
From what I know most games dont have quad-core support but with technology idk how long that will last.
So my question is what should I do with that money??
Stick with a good dual core like a e8500 or go to a quad core.
(Im going to have to stick to my LGA 775 socket)
