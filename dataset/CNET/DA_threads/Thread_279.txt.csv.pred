1.1.1	I have a few network cables that transmit at a VERY slow rate .	St
1.1.2	If I replace the cables with other ones the network goes fast .	St
1.1.3	Could it be ...	St
1.1.4	The slow cables are not in the 568-B nor in the 568-A order .	St
1.1.5	They are crimped the same on both ends though .	St
1.1.6	Example .	St
1.1.7	Orange White/Orange Green White/Green Brown White/Brown Blue White/Blue The reason I came to this conclusion is the & quot ; pairs & quot ; are twisted , and if If the network has to transmit along the wrong pair could the be interferance of something ?	Ques
1.1.8	Can anyone explain .	St
1.2.1	That 's not proper .	St
1.2.2	Here 's a link about what 's wrong .	St
1.2.3	http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_over_twisted_pair Hint , pins 3,4,5,6 are wrong .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	It does n't matter if the cables conform to any wiring standard as long as they are the same on both ends .	St
1.3.2	This would still be a straight through cable .	St
1.3.3	Examine the printing on the cable to determine the rated bandwidth/speed .	St
1.3.4	Cat.3 , Cat.5 , Cat.5e , Cat.6 ?	Ques
1.4.1	The signal would not be on pairs so you get the effect above .	St
1.4.2	Please do a little more research .	Sug
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	You 're right Bob .	St
1.5.2	I leapt before I looked .	St
1.5.3	His wiring scheme on 1,2,3,6 would be org , wht/org , grn , wht/blue .	St
1.5.4	Consider me busted too !	St
1.5.5	But thanks for the heads up .	Polite
1.6.1	Such cable errors is one reason our tech was able to buy his new hybrid .	St
1.6.2	The first reason is spyware .	St
1.6.3	Thank you all spyware authors ?	Ques
