1.1.2	Win XP sp2 Homemade computer with ABIT sd7-533 motherboard Memory (RAM) in MB:768 Processor type:Intel P4 Processor speed (MHz):2.6 GHz Hard Drive Capacity:38 GB I have a Netgear FA311 network card connected to a WGR614 (v4) wireless router for my home network.	St
1.1.3	It was working fine until last week -now, when I try to disable the connection, I get an error box saying: &quot;Error disabling connection - it is not possible to diasble the connection at this time.	St
1.1.4	This connection may be using one or more protocols that do not support Plug-and-Play, or it may have been initiated by another user or the system account.&quot; The error seemed to occur after my spyware software (Aluria Spyware Remover) updated last week.	St
1.1.5	This error comes up even when my computer is the only one on the network.	St
1.1.6	I have tried: -system restore (which failed to restore the machine to before the spyware update) -uninstalling and reinstalling the network card using the device manager -changing the PCI slot the card is in Nothing seems to work.	St
1.1.7	It takes much longer for my machine to boot than before, probably because it is enabling the network everytime it is started.	St
