Only other time I networked anything was when I used a router to split a cable ISP connection between my neighbor and myself. However, when we tried to take the router off and go back to individual access, my neighbor's pc could never connect so I'm already afraid of routers. Anyway.... I've got a desktop pc, a new ibook w/Airport card, and an xbox. Need advice to set up a network where the ibook is wireless and the xbox (wired or wireless) gets strong bandwith throughput. I'll be downloading a lot of music on the pc as well. The pc is upstairs while the xbox is in the basement.(thanks to my wife!) I was looking at the new Belkin Pre-N router. I'd like all the help and suggestions I can get.

Dlink would be my third choice. I personally wouldn't use a highspeed connection without a router. A router offer some protection from the outside. Better to get one with a built in firewall.
