1.3.4	is this what power supplies usually do when they need to be replaced ?	Ques
1.4.1	Nothing lasts forever and you 're already dealing with old parts .	St
1.4.2	If you have an & quot ; under-powered PSU & quot ; it will eventually die .	St
1.4.3	It may also become stressed just by wear & tear as heat is a culprit all too often in these cases .	St
1.4.4	Just consider you got your money 's worth .	St
1.4.5	Replace the PSU or any other part as necessary .	St
1.4.6	If you feel the PSU is putting out too much heat , then replace it will fry itself and *maybe* take something else with it , if not already .	St
1.4.7	You have an iffy situation where all items together cause a problem , thus test elsewhere alone .	St
1.4.8	Let 's not forget that a possible & quot ; bad caps & quot ; can be had if poor power was at fault or the famous bad caps manufacture .	St
1.4.9	Check : http : //www.badcaps.net for clues/tips .	St
1.4.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	is a basic method of solving problems on any type/age computer .	St
1.5.2	You want to find out what is causing the supply to shutdown or run hot .	St
1.5.3	If you want to see if the supply runs hot when not connected to anything .	St
1.5.4	Simply jumper the green wire on the connector that goes to the mobo to any of the black wires , and the supply should turn on [ as noted by the fan turning ] [ also tells whether the power switch is defective ] and stay on as long as the jumper is present .	St
1.5.5	The supply will have no external load , and thus if it blows out hot air the supply itself is bad .	St
