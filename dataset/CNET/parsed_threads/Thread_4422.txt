<s> I am wondering why a document that displays colored graphics when viewed in WP and MS Word, only prints up black/white. </s>
<s> The printer can print other docs that are colored w/o a problem. </s>
<s> I am assuming that some property of the document itself has been configured to print in greyscale, but I wasn't able to find any such option. </s>
<s> Normally, it's a setting on the print dialog window. </s>
<s> That's stored in the document, but easy to change for a new print job. </s>
<s> If not, try copy all/paste to a new document (based on the same template). </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> printer dialaog properties and copying/pasting. </s>
<s> Still all in black and white. </s>
<s> Oh well...thanks anyways. </s>
