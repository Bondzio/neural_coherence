Yeah, it looks like it does.
I borrowed a wired optical mouse from a friend that was less than 2000 dpi just to test things out.
Before I used a wireless mouse because I'm using it on a TV and across the room.
It improved the performance about a thousand times.
I've already ordered a Logitech G700 (5700 dpi) and hopefully it won't fail me because it's wireless as well...
