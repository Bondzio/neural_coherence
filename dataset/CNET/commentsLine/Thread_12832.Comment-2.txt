&quot;could i use a slightly older spare computer and set that up as a print server?&quot; absolutely.
remember that depending on how reliable it is, people will be be pestering you to fix it whenever and wherever you are.
&quot;or should i just use an external printer server like an hpjetdirect print server?&quot; i like those.
when they work (99.999% do just fine), they just work and never need a reboot.
&quot;if i was going to use a spare computer as a printer server, can anyone give me some direction as to how to set it up?&quot; if i was going to do this, i'd load up linux and make this a smb printer share.
fine books and web sites abound on the internet, but your choice here.
