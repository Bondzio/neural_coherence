Do you mean from device to bridge, or just connecting a computer to the device using a crossover cable?
With the first bridge (Motorola WE800g), I got it second hand and there was no cable with it, I've mostly been using a standard patch cable, but tried once or twice with a crossover cable (but have not tested this extensively).
With the second bridge (Netgear WGE101), I've been using the cable provided with it.
If you mean connecting a computer to the device with a crossover cable: that's what I have been doing to transfer stuff to / from it (and works fine), but for convenience I would like to simply have it on the wireless network.
