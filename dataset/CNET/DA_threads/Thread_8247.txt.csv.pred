Ques

1.2.1	But have him show you this switch and the motherboard and all working .	St
1.2.2	Else just ask for your money back .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	as the & quot ; CPU & quot ; .	St
1.3.2	Perhaps he means the power button .	St
1.3.3	You said you plugged everything in .	St
1.3.4	Do you remember wiring the front panel connections part of the motherboard ?	Ques
1.3.5	Did you double check power switch connection ?	Ques
1.3.6	The green light means you have the 5v power to latch the power supply to & quot ; On & quot ; but it does n't start the computer .	St
1.4.1	yes i did wire up the power buttons etc but still nothing happens i even got the guy on the phone ( the man who i brought the motherboard off ) and we checked everything together.still nothing	St
1.5.1	With system OFF , do ... Find the frt .	St
1.5.2	panel ON/OFF button and its wire harness .	St
1.5.3	Follow that wiring to the mtrbd .	St
1.5.4	where it connects .	St
1.5.5	Disconnect and then momentarily short those pins and it should try to start .	Sug
1.5.6	If it does n't you got another problem .	St
1.5.7	If it does start , you got a bad wiring or switch .	St
1.5.8	Be sure , you locate proper ON/OFF wiring .	St
1.5.9	Some users confuse ON/OFF ( power ) with remote power ( any other power label ) or wake-up connections if so labeled .	St
1.5.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	http : //pinouts.ru/Power/atxpower_pinout.shtml You can try to start the PS from the MB connector as well .	St
1.6.2	If you have a DVM , you can see if the voltages are there .	St
1.6.3	I 've seen a number of power supplies that show evidence of an attempt to start but shut down immediately .	St
1.6.4	Watch the PS fan carefully when you try to power up the PC .	St
1.6.5	If it twitches and stops , this means it attempted to start but shut down do to detecting a load problem .	St
1.6.6	This is generally a bad power supply or something it 's connected to .	St
1.6.7	Switching power supplies are tricky to troubleshoot as they also do n't like to start when not connected to a load .	St
1.6.8	If you can connect the PS to another MB and the PS starts ok , this usually rules it out as the problem .	St
1.6.9	It does n't rule it out as possibly being of insufficient power to operate what it 's connected to .	St
1.6.10	I 'd remove all connections to the PS but the MB .	St
1.6.11	This can also include RAM and CPU if you wish .	St
1.6.12	If the PS starts ok as evidenced by it 's fan continuing to run when it has n't before , this makes the MB suspect .	St
1.6.13	It 's also not uncommon to have standoffs under a MB causing short circuits if you have it in the case .	St
1.6.14	You can check this by putting the MB on a table and just connecting things outside the box .	St
1.6.15	Good luck .	Polite
