1.1.1	Hi , I have recently been persuaded that Apple is the way to go for me .	St
1.1.2	I have been looking to get a laptop for myself for a little while now , and have settled on a Macbook .	St
1.1.3	I am basically doing normal , everyday tasks such as email , word processing , watching movies , burn cd 's etc .	St
1.1.4	I will not be gaming .	St
1.1.5	My question is which version is right for me - the 1.8ghz or 2ghz ?	Ques
1.1.6	I would at least want to upgrade the RAM to 1gb in the 1.8 and to 2gb a bit later if I need to .	St
1.1.7	I could easily do the same in the 2ghz version .	St
1.1.8	Having a dvd burner and larger hard drive would be nice but they are not essential for me .	St
1.1.9	Is the performance difference that great and is the 2gz a much better value ?	Ques
1.1.10	Also - how worth it are laptop warranties ?	Ques
1.1.11	I have never owned a laptop so I do n't really know .	St
1.1.12	I know that VISA doubles any warranty on a product so that could be enough but I do n't know for sure .	St
1.1.13	I am spinning in circles with all the options and would appreciate any guidance .	St
1.1.14	thx .	St
1.2.1	I suppose you are not going to do any video editing .	St
1.2.2	So do you need the DVD burner ?	Ques
1.2.3	Well ask your self this question .	Sug
1.2.4	Are you or are you not going to burn DVDs .	St
1.2.5	You could burn DVDs for extra storage or for movies etc .	St
1.2.6	If you are going to do only the things that you mentioned then you would be better off going for the 1.83 Ghz model as the increase to 2 Ghz is not really noticeable .	St
1.2.7	It is almost impossible to notice the difference with the work that you are going to do .	St
1.2.8	The only way to notice the difference is to do some CPU intensive work like video editing .	St
1.2.9	When you do that , you might notice that your work is done a few mins earlier .	St
1.2.10	About the hard drive , well again it depends upon you .	St
1.2.11	Are you going to store any multimedia like movies on your laptop ?	Ques
1.2.12	Do you need the extra storage ?	Ques
1.2.13	For the work you specified , I really dont think you will need it .	St
1.2.14	With the extra cash that you save , you can buy more RAM which comes in quite handy and the difference is quite noticeable most of the time .	St
1.2.15	Better still , you can buy AppleCare for your laptop .	St
1.2.16	It is like car insurance , you dont use it frequently but it might come in handy .	St
1.2.17	If some internal defect comes up then it might cost a lot of money to get repaired but the AppleCare it is free .	St
1.2.18	The main reason why many people buy it is because it helps a lot when you want to sell your laptop after a few years .	St
1.2.19	The reason being that people will know that this product is protected by Apple and any defects will be repaired by Apple .	St
1.2.20	Now lets look at the differences .	Sug
1.2.21	If you upgrade your RAM and hard drive to equal the 2 Ghz model , then the difference in money is only $ 75 .	St
1.2.22	With that $ 75 you get a DL SuperDrive and a slightly faster processor .	St
1.2.23	The only attractive thing is the superdrive .	St
1.2.24	Another little problem you face is RAM .	St
1.2.25	As far as I know , the Macbook has only 2 RAM slots .	St
1.2.26	No matter how much RAM you buy , the RAM will always take up both the slots .	St
1.2.27	If you want to upgrade on your own then you will have to take away one RAM stick and maybe sell it to free up one slot .	Sug
1.2.28	So you would think right now that it is better to just go for the 2 GB right away .	St
1.2.29	But remember the Apple RAM is more expensive than what you can get from other manufacturers .	St
1.2.30	When you click on the Learn More button on Apple online store , it tells you that 512 MB is good enough for tasks like word processing , emailing etc .	St
1.2.31	REad more of it and you can choose what is appropriate for you .	St
1.2.32	If I were in your position , then I would just buy the 1.83 Ghz model ( unless I wanted to burn DVDs ) and buy the AppleCare and maybe upgrade to 1 GB RAM .	St
1.2.33	Simply out , do you want to burn DVDs ?	Ques
1.2.34	If yes , go for the 2 GHz model , if no , go for the 1.83 ghz model .	Res
1.2.35	Good Bye	St
1.3.1	Oh yeah and maybe you should wait for Leopard .	Sug
1.3.2	I do n't want a debate started here but its a strong suggestion .	St
1.3.3	Now that we are in 2007 , iLife 07 should be very close to release .	St
1.3.4	and if you can hold on to buying a laptop , then you should wait for Leopard the new Mac OS to release .	Sug
1.3.5	It will have many cool new features like automatic backup , multiple desktops etc to name a few .	St
1.3.6	It is also rumoured tham the Graphical User Interface will change from Aqua ( current on Tiger ) to Illuminous which will have black and dark colours .	St
1.3.7	It is also said that the new OS normally works faster than the previous OS on the same hardware .	St
1.3.8	I dont know about this but I have heard people saying this .	St
1.4.1	I have the 2ghz macbook with 158mb of ram ( still havent gotten around to updating it : P ) and I think its a great computer..but since we 're soo close to leopard being released maybe you should wait and see .	St
1.4.2	Things like & quot ; Time Travel & quot ; similar to the feature on windows computers is something really nice to have .	St
1.4.3	If you need a laptop for work now though , then dont hesitate , upgrade to leopard later .	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	Just wanted to say thanks guys !	Polite
1.6.2	Waiting till Leopard is out seems to be the smart thing to do .	St
1.6.3	Appreciate it !	St
1.7.1	Hi , i am in the same spot as the original thread starter .	St
1.7.2	Presently i am a student so have access to web and use a lot of comp related to internet usage .	St
1.7.3	But my work is on merchant ships , where i am away from net .	St
1.7.4	So succinctly i use the laptop for normal word processing etc , PLUS basic ( Read basic ) EDITING of pictures using picasa or may be photoshop ( btw does mac have any software like photoshop ? )	Ques
1.7.5	in distant future .	St
1.7.6	My question is : Should i be so much worried regarding the non use of ATI graphics card in macbook with core 2duo .	St
1.7.7	and can i just use openoffice and avoid buying ms office for mac since i can convert openoffice files into MS files just for printing purposes .	St
1.7.8	thks in advance for ur help brgds krish	St
1.8.1	Link to - & gt ; http : //www.neooffice.org/ Bob	St
1.9.1	can be done in iPhoto , free with every new Mac .	St
1.9.2	You could also use Photoshop Elements for Mac if you want to do a little more with editing .	St
1.9.3	As to your question about photoshop .	St
1.9.4	Yes there is a piece of software that is remarkably similar to Photoshop .	St
1.9.5	It 's called Photoshop .	St
1.9.6	That product is produced for both platforms .	St
1.9.7	You should not concern yourself with the non use of ATI graphics cards .	Sug
1.9.8	The card that is installed in the MacBook is perfectly capable of doing what you want it to do .	St
1.9.9	P	St
1.10.1	thks P One more question , presently have an ACER laptop which came with XP home installed.The xp home is buried somewhere in one of the 3 & quot ; Reecovery & quot ; cds for the laptop Can i install xp home in macbook by using these cds ?	Ques
1.10.2	rgds krish	St
1.11.1	outside the terms of use of the EULA that you agreed to when you purchased the Acer .	St
1.11.2	You would also probably find that the restore disks have some form of checking on them to ensure that your are installing it on an Acer machine .	St
1.11.3	HP & Compaq used that technique .	St
1.11.4	P	St
