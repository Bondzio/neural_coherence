<s> I recently purchased a computer with 2GB of ram. </s>
<s> I purchased 2 additional 1GB sticks. </s>
<s> I installed them both, but my computer wouldn't start. </s>
<s> After the BIOS screen windows never starts to load. </s>
<s> My computer works fine with 3GB, but as soon as I install the final stick of ram... same thing every time, comp won't start. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> I'm using 32 bit vista. </s>
<s> I've seen problems were populating all RAM slots do this if the installed RAM exceeds what the MB will support. </s>
<s> As well, with the 3 GBs installed does the OS show all of it? </s>
<s> MB and RAM specs might help get a better answer. </s>
<s> My system specs: Intel Core 2 CPU 6700 @ 2.66ghz System Ram: 3070MB System Type: 32 Bit operating system (vista premium) anyone else have any ideas? </s>
<s> i dont have much time to type right now i can give more details later. </s>
<s> I am not sure of MB atm , just got the comp. </s>
<s> Sorry but there are far too many reports of issues at 4GB. </s>
<s> From BIOS to Windows. </s>
<s> Try it with just 2GB until your machine's maker fesses up to why it bombs. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Why 32bit version!... </s>
<s> 32 bit processors can only use up to 2G of RAM. </s>
<s> I also bought 4 pieces of Corsair 1Ghz FSB speed memory and it turned out a piece was bad. </s>
<s> And of course, my computer is a 64 bit machine that was running XP/64 and even though 4Gig is there, the computer will only tell you that there's 3Gig on the My Computer/System Properties/General Tab </s>

<s> How does one install this patch? </s>
<s> Vista won't install so we can't patch Vista. </s>
<s> -&gt; Shouldn't Microsoft re-issue the DVD? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> All 32 bit versions support only up to 3 gigabytes. </s>
<s> To get 4 you have to upgrade vista. </s>
<s> I dont think their is 32 bit home premium so you would have to go ultimate or something to use 4 gigs. </s>
<s> Until you go to 64-Vista it's going to be limited to 3 to 3.5 Gigs. </s>
<s> http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/editions/64bit.mspx does write the 64-bit is in the box but many OEM installs are... the 32 bit version due to driver issues. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> install patch, put the other 2GB back in. </s>
<s> Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't care what the operating system is, a 32bit processor can only write to 2Gig of memory! </s>
<s> End of story. </s>
<s> Hi Everyone Here's something I copied from microsofts website The virtual address space of processes and applications is still limited to 2 GB unless the /3GB switch is used in the Boot.ini file. </s>
<s> When the physical RAM in the system exceeds 16 GB and the /3GB switch is used, the operating system will ignore the additional RAM until the /3GB switch is removed. </s>
<s> This is because of the increased size of the kernel required to support more Page Table Entries. </s>
<s> The assumption is made that the administrator would rather not lose the /3GB functionality silently and automatically; therefore, this requires the administrator to explicitly change this setting. </s>
<s> The /3GB switch allocates 3 GB of virtual address space to an application that uses IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE in the process header. </s>
<s> This switch allows applications to address 1 GB of additional virtual address space above 2 GB. </s>
<s> The virtual address space of processes and applications is still limited to 2 GB, unless the /3GB switch is used in the Boot.ini file. </s>
<s> The following example shows how to add the /3GB parameter in the Boot.ini file to enable application memory tuning: </s>
<s> Alright, I think one of the sticks of RAM was jacked. </s>
<s> I would blue screen constantly after anywhere from 5-30 minutes of playing Counter-Strike. </s>
<s> I was able to get my computer to start ONCE with all four sticks of RAM, and you are correct, it was maxed out at 3.5 GB. </s>
<s> After I restarted, my computer wouldn't start again so I removed a stick of RAM and it worked again. </s>
<s> I updated my BIOS and im using the beta version of NVIDIA's forceware drivers now, which seem to work much better than the ones I was using. </s>
<s> I haven't had a blue screen since I pulled out the crappy piece of ram and updated bios and video card drivers. </s>
<s> I think it also might be because I have 2 sticks of nice Corsair ram, and the other 2 sticks are K-BYTE cheap ass ram.. </s>
<s> firstly, you need make sure that your computer motherboard support to 4Gb RAM, If ok, you have two methods to install 4Gb RAM. </s>
<s> use 64 bit OS or Change physical RAM info( see microsoft website for detail) </s>
