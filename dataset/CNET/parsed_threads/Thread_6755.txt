<s> I bought a used G4 and it worked OK for a bit but it used to lose the time and date. </s>
<s> One day, it wouldn't start at all, so I worked out it was probably a PRAM problem and changed the internal battery. </s>
<s> The new battery measures OK on my (admittedly very basic) meter but nothing happens when I try to power up the machine. </s>
<s> I have checked and there is mains voltage going to the power supply. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Here is a trick I have used for many years. </s>
<s> Remove the battery from the machine. </s>
<s> Remove the power plug from the machine. </s>
<s> Press the CUDA button(it is on the motherboard), little square thing with a top that looks like a pencil eraser. </s>
<s> ONCE Press the Power On button on the front of the machine. </s>
<s> Leave the whole thing for at least 30 minutes. </s>
<s> Then Put the battery back in Put the power cord back in Press the Power On button on the front of the machine Sit back and enjoy the startup chime. </s>
<s> If this works, let me know and I'll tell yo what we just did. </s>
<s> If not, tell me and we'll start again P </s>
<s> Thank you so much for the advice. </s>
<s> I followed it carefully but I'm afraid it didn't work for me. </s>
<s> The machine still shows no sign of life. </s>
<s> I appreciate your input, </s>
<s> Well that rules out a PRAM problem then. </s>
<s> What we did there was to totally reset the logic board (Motherboard) Removing the battery and the power cord removed all sources of power. </s>
<s> Pushing the &quot;ON&quot; button discharged the capacitor the kickstarts the power supply. </s>
<s> By leaving it for 30 mins, all vestiges of power were drained from the machine. </s>
<s> 99 out of 100, this works and the machine bursts back into life. </s>
<s> Sorry for you being #100. </s>
<s> If nothing happened at all, I would suspect, first, the Power Supply. </s>
<s> There are ways to test this ATX type power supply but the normal step is to replace it and see if that was the problem. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, this is an Apple part so a regular ATX power supply is not going to fit. </s>
<s> Are you absolutely sure that there are no lights at all on the logic board after you push the on button? </s>
<s> It's quite safe to have the door down when you are doing this. </s>
<s> Just watch the cat and the coffee! </s>
<s> This may sound redundant, but, make sure that all the connectors to the logic board are seated well. </s>
<s> Disconnect them and put them back. </s>
<s> Power cord out for this step. </s>
<s> Remove any extra RAM that you have installed, ditto any extra hardware. </s>
<s> The only thing plugged in should be the keyboard, mouse, monitor and power cord. </s>
<s> Try to power up. </s>
<s> If you have a friend with a working G4, beg, borrow or steal their power supply. </s>
<s> Purely for diagnostics, you understand. </s>
<s> Good Luck P </s>
<s> Thank you again for the input. </s>
<s> Knowing what the procedure is doing is extremely helpful, as is advice on what else I can try. </s>
<s> I do have access to an almost identical G4, so swapping the power supplies would be possible. </s>
<s> Before I do that, I'm wondering if I'm simply not following your instructions correctly. </s>
<s> When I opened up the G4 again, there was a little red LED glowing, which suggests the motherboard is getting at least some power. </s>
<s> Is it safe to repeat the procedure? </s>
<s> (You said to push the button on the board only once.) </s>
<s> I'm wondering if I have correctly identified the button. </s>
<s> The thing I am looking at is above the positive connection for the battery, about 1/4 inch square metal casing with a round button about the size of an artificial sweetner. </s>
<s> However, there was nothing about its action to suggest that it was a button when I pushed it. </s>
<s> Thanks again </s>
<s> You are correct about the location of the CUDA button. </s>
<s> If you use a blunt instrument, no pointy things, to push it down, you will feel a slight give in the button. </s>
<s> That's all it takes. </s>
<s> Push straight down and then release. </s>
<s> I usually use the end of a pencil to push it with. </s>
<s> Once is the recommended number of times as there is a theory that more than that will mess up the Firmware on the board. </s>
<s> This is NOT from experience, however... </s>
<s> Yes, it is quite safe to repeat the procedure. </s>
<s> Check the battery is in the holder correctly. </s>
<s> I'm sure you have already done that given the observation about the positive connection. </s>
<s> Go at it again and good luck P </s>
<s> Just where, in the Green and Pleasant land, does Mr simoncroft hail from? </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> I do believe you'll have good luck if you boot your mac and hold down command-option-p-r (four keys) It will chime and reboot. </s>
<s> After that it will boot properly, unless there's another problem. </s>
<s> Any time the battery's involved, it's best to zap the parameter ram (PRAM). </s>
<s> If you read the posts, you will find that removing the battery and resetting the logic board does exactly that. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> do you have any suggestions? </s>
<s> my laptop is completely dead. </s>
<s> its a G4 </s>
