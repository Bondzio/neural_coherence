NVMM = non-volatile memory module or EEPROM(bios) My educated guess in this matter.
The only reason you're getting any error message are the small routines buried in the bios.
(--) maybe the only characters it can access within its limited memory space as it could be any character(s).
IMHO, EVGA, is a cheap outfit as they been offering items on their own recently and mostly at the bottom end.
Only now do I see high prcied offering, but I avoid such myself.
