what is it with people like you?
don't you have anything better to than post useless drivel on forums.
your babble only serves to clutter up what would otherwise be great threads of information.
please do us all a favor and don't post a reply unless you have something really meaningful to contribute and what you posted was a true waste of time and words.
i see people like you all the time and it's a shame you even have a computer because you add nothing to the body of knowledge.
you can't contribute anything meaningful so you post drivel instead.
please just go away.
i've already reported your post and useless.
please just go away and let people who know what they're talking about reply.
