i was able to change the raid to ata/atapi and i got the cd/dvd drives detected.
i went to load windows and it stopped due to an error with the hard drive.
said check for corruption or viruses, but everything is brand new.
does it need to be formatted or something?
so far you've been a great help.
as far as a raid manuel there was none.
