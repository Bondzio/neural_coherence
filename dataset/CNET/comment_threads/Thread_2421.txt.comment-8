Bob, I finally got TWEAKUI installed.
My problem was I didn't realize it had to be installed to IT'S OWN download folder to end up in the Control Panel.
I see TWEAKUI has alot of little goodies.
It appears now I can sometimes tweak w/o being afraid of the messing up the registry.
Thanks for your help.
Have a great day.
