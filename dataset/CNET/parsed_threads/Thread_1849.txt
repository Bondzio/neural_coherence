<s> I'm a newbie to wireless networking and am looking for some setup and equipment advice. </s>
<s> I currently have a desktop PC, with a wired cable internet connection. </s>
<s> I also have a Mac laptop, equipped with a wireless Airport card. </s>
<s> Is there a wireless router I could purchase that would let me keep the wired connection with my PC (since it is not equipped with a wireless card) but allow my laptop to access the internet connection wirelessly? </s>
<s> Would the router be compatable with my current ISP? </s>
<s> If so, any recommendation on specific brands/models? </s>
<s> I just need the basics, so something relatively inexpensive would be ideal. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, Adam </s>
<s> It is quite simple, actually. </s>
<s> You can use any number of manufacturers equipment and all are equally capable. </s>
<s> That includes DLink,Belkin and Linksys. </s>
<s> I am presently using Belkin and am pleased with it. </s>
<s> It is one of the least expensive units. </s>
<s> Almost all routers have a minimum of four hard wired ethernet ports on the back. </s>
<s> Shut down the comupters. </s>
<s> Unplug the power from the cable modem (clicking the power switch,if there is one won't do the job). </s>
<s> Plug the ethernet cable, which should be supplied, into the cable modem and the router WAN socket. </s>
<s> Install the software that comes with the router. </s>
<s> Windows XP SP2 and the latest version of Mac OS really shouldn't need any software, added, however. </s>
<s> Plug the ethernet cable from your desktop into one of the ports on the back of the router. </s>
<s> Plug the cable modem back in and wait for the lights to stabilize, which shows it is online and working. </s>
<s> Now, plug the power into the router and wait until the lights on it stop flashing (except for the ones which show activity. </s>
<s> The LED layout is in the manual) Boot the desktop. </s>
<s> It should see the internet once it is up and running. </s>
<s> Getting Wireless is a wee bit more complicated but no big deal. </s>
<s> Depending on which router you buy you will have different I.P. </s>
<s> addresses which you will use to talk to the router. </s>
<s> Open a browser and type in the I.P. </s>
<s> - like 192.168.1.1. </s>
<s> The last two will change by mfger. </s>
<s> I think Belkin is 192.168.1.2. </s>
<s> They will be very close. </s>
<s> When you press enter you should have a page open which will look like a website, but which is actually the interface to the router. </s>
<s> Most of the settings which are changeable are already set, but the one you will definitely want to change is the Security settings. </s>
<s> If the MacOS is the latest one then I think you should be able to use WPA. </s>
<s> You may see a PSK after the WPA choice; this is the one you want. </s>
<s> WPA is the easiest to use as all you need do is to enter a passphrase and the router will create the big, long 26 place alpha-numeric encryption code. </s>
<s> You will use the same passphrase when setting up the computer. </s>
<s> The other choices are 64 bit WEP and 128 bit WEP. </s>
<s> The 128 is recommended as you will have to have this for online banking. </s>
<s> It is a little harder to set up simply because you will need to write down the key and enter it into the computer. </s>
<s> The reason for the Security is so your neighbor or some dude parking in front of your residence can't get into your network. </s>
<s> If you drive around with your laptop on and set to find available networks you will see a whole passle of LINKSYS networks. </s>
<s> This means that they bought a Linksys router and didn't bother to encrypt it. </s>
<s> You can use it to check the internet or email, etc. </s>
<s> You can also hack his network if you know how. </s>
<s> So take the time to learn how to set up your encryption and you won't have to worry about someone stealing your info. </s>
<s> Give your network a name to distinguish it from all the others out there, which, depending on where you live, can be a goodly number. </s>
<s> Use your online help manual for specifics, but this is the methodology in a nutshell. </s>
<s> Simple. </s>
<s> The enet ports on the back of the router can feed other devices or other routers. </s>
<s> The wirelss can feed a whole bunch of laptops. </s>
<s> If you want to pass data back and forth between the Mac and Windows, it is a lot harder to set up and you will need some luck. </s>
<s> But, just to share the internet connection is the aforementioned simple task. </s>
<s> Good Luck. </s>
<s> D-Link, Netgear and Linksys. </s>
<s> These guys have the largest market share. </s>
<s> Buy what you find on sale. </s>
<s> I have mixed feelings about Hawking and Airlink. </s>
<s> The docs for these products are weak. </s>
<s> I never tried Belkin or SMC but many others seem to like their products. </s>
<s> If you have the urge to become a hobbyist you can try the Linksys wrt54g. </s>
<s> There are 3rd part images that allow additional features. </s>
