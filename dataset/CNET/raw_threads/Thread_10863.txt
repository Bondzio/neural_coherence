I am trying to find a SATA Controller card that supports Raid 0 (stripping) with a hotspare. If i remember correctly this is Raid 5. Can anyone here reccomend a card that will do this. I can't seem to find one out there. Thank you

I was worried that I would need a minimum of 4. Now I'm going to do some digging and see what one i should buy. They tested a few but Im still not quite sure if all of the controllers out there support only 3 drives for raid 5. Only reason im worried is because the controller thats built onto my mother board doesnt support 3; you have to use 4 drives.
