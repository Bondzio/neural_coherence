i'm guessing this is not what you meant to write.
but thesis work is something you choose then work with your prof or adviser when you get stuck.
but i must comment here that i've seen such before.
that is, the person sometimes thinks that such a study or data is on the web.
or they are trying to avoid setting up a lab to do the work.
the lab setup seems to be the most common issue i see.
it's really a lot of fun to set it up and then create the software to simulate, capture and more.
