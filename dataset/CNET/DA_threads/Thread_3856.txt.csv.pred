1.1.1	I have an HP Pavilion tx2000 laptop [ Old , I know , but it 's been fixed up from it 's previous mess and made like new and improved again ] And when i flip it over I see what looks like some kind of fan .	St
1.1.2	I 'm not sure if it is the fan but it closely resembles one and it 's right next to the vents .	St
1.1.3	Hot , hot air blows out when i play either the sims 3 or when it 's charging , and i 'm wondering if it 's due to this so called & quot ; fan & quot ; i 'm looking at .	St
1.1.4	I am planning on buying a cooling pad in the nearby future but i 'd like to know what i can do now to check .	St
1.1.5	There 's some dust inside from where i can see it and it looks like it 's on one of the blades .	St
1.2.1	open up the computer and take a look .	St
1.2.2	But if hot air is & quot ; blowing out & quot ; then it seems to me the fan might be ok .	St
1.3.1	Most of these fans are quiet and generally run regardless .	St
1.3.2	However , they do & quot ; auto-sense & quot ; the temp and will turn-ON and work if idled .	St
1.3.3	There 's nothing to keep from general cleaning by using an air can to blow any dust bunnies .	St
1.3.4	If able to more directly access the fan , do that as well .	St
1.3.5	If you find the fan has actually stopped or not working , replace with similar fan .	St
1.3.6	Since , you 're already thinking a cooling pad , get that ASAP .	St
1.3.7	It will help if the fan is iffy operation until fixed .	St
1.3.8	If this laptop is older as you 've mentioned , then maybe wear & tear finally caught-up with the fan , replace it why leave thought .	St
1.3.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
