I about fell off my chair when I came across this review this morning: http://tinyurl.com/mvn5e We ordered a pc from Alienware amost 8 weeks ago. It was supposed to arrive 8/28. We finally got fed up and cancelled the order yesterday, 10/6. The number of excuses Alieware can come up with as to why they haven't built and shipped your pc is mind boggling. I can only hope we don't have to contact the Florida State Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commision to get the $3400 charge removed from our credit card. CNET, STOP STOP STOP STOP promoting Alienware!!! They are turning your store ratings into a joke. 4 stars for Alienware, gimme a break. http://tinyurl.com/jrndd

You might even find Micahel Dell's information and e-mail him directly... The acquisition was announced in March, to be complete after regulatory approval; there's no PR at the Alienware site to say the deal has been sommuated, however, so it may still be in process. -- Dave K.

My problem is with Cnet continuing to give Alienware a 4 star rating. You don't show reviews that people post for STORES, only PRODUCTS. You check any other reseller rating site and you will find dozens of bad reviews for this company yet CNET continues to give them 4 starts. Here on CNET you don't see what an awful time people are having with this company unless you read the reviews for Alienware products. It's turning your own store ratings into a joke. Look at: http://tinyurl.com/n4dnx http://www.resellerratings.com/seller1650.html yet here they are on Cnet with 4 out of 5 stars.

When they started giving me delivery dates that were a month longer than they said when I placed the purchase, I immediately cancelled and built the system myself. My dollars speak for themselves, I build the same system for about $1500 less and used the difference to buy a nice Dell for my niece. I'll never buy again now that I've built a system on my own.

Just out of curiosity, which system did you order? Was it the same one from the review? What was the reason they gave you for taking so long to ship?
12439	5	211041	2253846	2250244	cookiebun	10/9/06 5:25 PM	1.1604147E12	prefer to build my own too.	I built the pc I'm using now. We cancelled our order with Alienware and decided to build my husband's new gaming rig ourselves. We spent about $3000 at newegg.com. Most of the stuff will be here Thursday. If all goes well he'll be gaming again by Sat. I think I'll build all my own P.C.s in the future. This was total B.S.

Since placing the order in August they managed to be out of: The case The motherboard. The dvd Drive. The power supply. Machine sat at stage 5 for 3 weeks until I filed a complaint with the Floridia BBB. Jumped to stage 8 and sat there for 4 days. Called Alienware, they said stage 8 usually takes 24 hours unless there is a problem. Obviously there was a problem so we decided to cancel. See my review (and others) here: http://www.resellerratings.com/seller_info.pl?seller_id=1650 Glad I'm not the guy who waited for them the actually ship. He's had 2 mobos and the machine still doesn't work.
