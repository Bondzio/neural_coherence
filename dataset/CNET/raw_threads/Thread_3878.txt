These owners must work very hard to find all the lovely drivers. Sometimes we can't find them on the older or more offbeat (Sony!) laptops. Your issues sound exactly like a retail OS installed on a laptop. Nothing I haven't seen before. But I could be wrong and you have a busted laptop. Why not make them fix it? Bob
