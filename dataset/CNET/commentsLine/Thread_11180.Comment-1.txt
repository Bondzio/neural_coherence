i was working on a friend's presario x6000; a big laptop with a big graphics problem; nothing could be read on the screen.
after re-installing xp-pro using the compaq disk, then use a second disk to install several more drivers - including ati m22/24 video.
everything worked ok until the driver is installed; then the screen becomes horribly fuzzy(can't think of a better description) and you can barely read anything- as it was before.
sometimes booting stops at a black screen.
i've loaded drivers from ms automatic update, from ati, and from hp(with their on-line help), but everytime any graphics/video driver is loaded, disaster hits.
i've even done the whole routine with a different hard drive, with the same result.
the only remedy is to restore from safe mode- or reinstall the os again.
without the ati graphics, it's obviously sluggish, but it works.
i think there is a problem with the graphics part of the motherboard because it's relatively ok before a driver &quot;activates&quot; it.
this wouldn't be such a big deal on a desktop- just stick a new card in it.
so, any idea why installing a graphics driver kills it?
i think it's a hardware flaw.
