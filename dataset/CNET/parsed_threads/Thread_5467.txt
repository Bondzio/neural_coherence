<s> I am looking to log on to the internet if I am traveling and not at a Wi-Fi hotspot. </s>
<s> I guess I am confused on the difference between Wi-Fi and wireless internet provided by a phone company like Alltel or Verizon. </s>
<s> If I buy a laptop that says it has 802.11g, is that just good for Wi-Fi at a Starbucks or some other &quot;hotspot&quot;, or will 802.11g also work for providing wireless internet access with a phone provider like Alltel, Verizon, etc? </s>
<s> Maybe I should also ask if 802.11g is a card built into a laptop, and if you must have another type of card for wireless internet service? </s>
<s> 802.11g is now a common feature built in to laptops. </s>
<s> It allows you to connect to hotspots or your home network. </s>
<s> It will not connect to your phone provider's wireless Internet access. </s>
<s> You must purchase a different card for that. </s>
<s> 802.11 cards are for hot spots and wifi If you want to use the internet anywhere and everywhere, get a nice cell phone(like my blackberry) and tether with it, or a mobile broadband card and stick it in your laptop. </s>
