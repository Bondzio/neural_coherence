some on-board raid is pretty slow also.
but nvidia's mediashield performs well and intel's matrixraid is even better.
matrixraid will allow you to partition two drives into 4 partitions and mirror the first partition of both drives and stripe the second partition of both drives.
a hardware based striped array set can typically only be moved to another pc with the same raid controller.
but a windows' based stripe-set could be moved to another pc if you configure your drives as dynamic disks.
