<s> Hi, I recently installed a BT Wiress DSL router. </s>
<s> I have created a security enabled wiress network (WPA) but notice only one of my two PC's can be connected to the network at a given time? </s>
<s> I dont appear to be have the two machines internet-connected at the same time? </s>
<s> I pretty sure it's something trivial ..... Any ideas? </s>
<s> Note: Network Authentication = WPA-PSK; Data Encyption = AES; Network key is same for both PC's (is this correct?) </s>
<s> Help greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Don- </s>
<s> have only one channel for wireless at a time. </s>
<s> Check out the router specs and see if it supports more than one wireless connection at a time. </s>
<s> Most routers will accept more than 1 wireless signal at a time. </s>
<s> In fact I have never seem even one that doesnt. </s>
<s> I used to install wireless equipment for a large retail, did hundreds of them. </s>
<s> From my experience DSL modems also have a built in DHCP server just like the router. </s>
<s> When they both try to assign IP's it is possible to get a duplicate and cause a conflict. </s>
<s> If they both have DHCP, turn the DHCP off on one of the two. </s>
<s> Also check the IP address of both the modem and the router, these cannot be the same but by default they could be. </s>
<s> Let us know if that works. </s>
