Unlikely.
However, if this was my machine I'd read and use the Optimizing Windows article at http://www.aumha.org/articles.htm As to Spybot twice a day, that is a sign that something is amiss.
Such as a owner that uses nothing but Internet Explorer which can gather many pests.
Try FIREFOX.
Also, use the latest Spybot as well as Adaware.
