:you missed the point.about i trust in reg cleaners comes from two quotes of user's answers:one said:&quot;the dell techs says reg cleaners doesn't work!&quot; the other one says:&quot;we are not expert,the pc registry is delicate&quot;.so,i just gave him an option,there's another good software out there.i've never choosed a product before listen what the users say about it.i never follow the &quot;hype ads&quot;.i guess it was a bad interpretation,anyways,tku for your reply
