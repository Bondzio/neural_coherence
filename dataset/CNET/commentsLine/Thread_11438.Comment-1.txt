hi, i need to ask this question because my back-up needs seem to different to the typical long-term archive scenario.
as a translator, i work on documents everyday over a number of days and i also update admin documents to track my work and budget.
keeping these files safe is crucial but the fact that they change every day, in fact every hour, means that solutions like dvd burning are too final and cumbersome.
i would be grateful for any suggestions on how to keep files safe that are in constant use.
even once or twice a day back-up would be acceptable.
i currently keep all my non-program files on an external hard-drive, which safeguards against a breakdown of the computer itself.
but that doesn't help if the external hdd dies one day.
i have considered the mybook mirror but it seems very expensive and i'm not certain how recovery would work in the case of failure.
thanks for your help!
