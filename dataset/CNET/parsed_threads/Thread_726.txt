<s> When I attempted to install the second geforce 8800 gts card into my system, I was greeted with a high pitched squeeling noise the moment I turned on the power. </s>
<s> I tried it twice more, once after flipping the sli bridge around and then again with no sli bridge connection. </s>
<s> I ensured the card was properly seated. </s>
<s> All had the same high-pitched noise. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>

<s> Overheating, you need BIOS update, or you're overclocking. </s>
<s> Either you forgot the power connections to the cards (can be 2 on each) or that extra 100 Watt video card you added pushed the power supply over the edge. </s>
<s> Let's say you need 650 Watts or more on your power supply rating. </s>

<s> Thanks for the quick responses guys. </s>
<s> Yup, I was just a tired moron last night and didnt plug in the power for the second card, d'oH!. </s>
<s> However, while the second card is hooked up and working, with sli-enabled in the nvidia control panel, I have a bit of a snag. </s>
<s> Under graphics settings in GTA iv, my &quot;resources available&quot; is exactly the same and I see minimal graphic improvement. </s>
<s> I have found changing the view distance from 1 to 70 (max amt it will let me push it) there is very little difference in viewing distance or graphics improvement. </s>
<s> The only difference is when its maxed out my camera movements are a little jagged. </s>
<s> Otherwise the game runs pretty much the same as on one card (it fairly good to start out with, i suppose). </s>
<s> Any thoughts by anybody? </s>
<s> Thanks for your time -Hendrik </s>
