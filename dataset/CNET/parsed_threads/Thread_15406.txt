<s> Here's the story. </s>
<s> Recently my computer (home built with asus mobo and ultra 400w power supply)was hit by lightning and thus it would no longer powerup no mobo lights. </s>
<s> I bought a new power supply ultra 500w to replace it. </s>
<s> I put it in the computer and it powered up fine, and I ran it normaly for hours until I went to bed. </s>
<s> I turned off the computer and the next time I tryed to use it no mobo lights and no power up. </s>
<s> I replace the power supply with an identical from the manufacturer. </s>
<s> I plugged it in and again it ran fine until I left the computer off for some time. </s>
<s> I guess the mother board is feeding back and burning up the power supply only when the computer is powered off. </s>
<s> I would like to know if my guess is sound, but I have never heard of this so alternate theories or suggestions of repair are needed. </s>
<s> Everything and anything can become subject when &quot;lightening damage&quot; is concerned. </s>
<s> I suggest you pull AC plug at the psu next time(5min. </s>
<s> ), replug when ready for use, it should reboot again. </s>
<s> Of course, it can be your HD as well. </s>
<s> Otherwise, I normally suspect the mtrbd. </s>
<s> is getting flaky and/or the start ckt. </s>
<s> is kaput, no fix, but replace. </s>
<s> Don't take anything for granted, test elsewhere and rebuild system. </s>
