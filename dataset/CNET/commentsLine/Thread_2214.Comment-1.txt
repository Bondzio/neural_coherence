i've got a dell dm051 series computer that was working fine till it started re-starting by itself and giving the following error message: &quot;alert!
previous attempts at booting this system have failed at checkpoint [ithr].for help in resolving this problem, please note this check point and contact dell technical support.&quot; this is how i tried to solve the problem: 1) unplugged all usb devices and any other devices except the monitor.
2) entered cmos & disabled &quot;boot from usb&quot;.
3) cleared cmos by removing the battery & moving the &quot;clear cmos&quot; jumper.
i did not add any new device to the pc!!!
what else can i try?
please help.
