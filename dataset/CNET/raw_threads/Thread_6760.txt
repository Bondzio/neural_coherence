I need to add these printers to my computer, and then print to them. The printing should be as simultaneous as possible. Doing this by hand would obviously take forever, so I am open to third party apps (cheap), vbscripts (with instruction please), command prompts, or anything else that will work. I've found programs to facilitate the &quot;printing&quot; part, I really am looking for suggestions on the &quot;adding&quot;. All of the printers are TCP/IP. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks! You may be saving a small business!

Not exactly cheap, but for a small business it might be worth looking into. http://download.cnet.com/Intelliscribe/3000-2088_4-10021520.html You could also try doing a search for &quot;broadcast printing&quot; for possible hits.

When faced with such limits and no staff I find the best course of action is to use what you know and have. I do know there are command line methods but these will only confuse most as not only it's the command line but the setup will be taxing. Bob
