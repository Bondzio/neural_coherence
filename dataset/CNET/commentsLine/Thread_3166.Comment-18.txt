all artifacts have a finite life.
disk drives have a mean-time to failure measured in thousands of hours.
this number actually goes up with the age of the device; those that do not fail in the first ninety days will last a long time.
however, you must plan for the eventual failure of your drive.
fortunately for you, the price of external storage is falling so fast that you can now have a tb drive for less than you paid for the 250 gb drive several years ago.
buy a new drive and copy the one that you have to it; hours, perhaps a day.
retire the old drive and keep it for backup.
repeat every couple of years.
while not perfect, this will give you a high degree of comfort.
consider using an online backup service such as carbonite or google.
these service use &quot;hierarchical storage&quot; strategies that provide for your data to persist as long as they do.
modern technology does nothing quite so well as to make cheap, dense, portable copies of data.
the total loss of one's data reflects some absence of planning.
