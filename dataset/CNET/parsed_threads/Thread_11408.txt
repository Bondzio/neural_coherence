<s> I am seeing an interesting phenomenon with my wireless network. </s>
<s> I have a w2k box set up to perform 802.1x authentication for my wireless network, using EAP-TLS. </s>
<s> For authentication type I have use smart card or certificate, and have both the user cert and to Root CA cert installed. </s>
<s> When I check the Validate server certificate option the connection fails, and I get an entry in event viewer on the w2k boc idicating an invalid user name or password. </s>
<s> When I leave the box unchecked I connect just fine. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> I have some cards that won't connect under some settings and when I call it in they finally replied with a &quot;Yes, we'll have to fix that.&quot; Have you contacted the people that supplied the drivers? </s>

<s> Hi Bob, I was hopping you were out there perusing the posts. </s>
<s> Yes, I have contacted Linksys, and they're looking into it. </s>
<s> They have actually been pretty responsive on this issue, but no cure yet. </s>
<s> I was hopping you might have some ideas, but if it's a driver issue, I'm stuck till they fix it. </s>
<s> Rob </s>
<s> Sadly they came back with a &quot;don't do that&quot; and no date on the fix. </s>
<s> So you can guess the answer. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Unforyunately not being able to validate the cert does create a bit of a vulnerability. </s>
<s> If this is just to keep others off your wifi why not just WPA or WPA2? </s>
<s> There is no crack worth noting here that doesn't take an armada of machines to break into. </s>
<s> One has to declare a goal. </s>
<s> Ours was simple. </s>
<s> Security that was strong enough and we could expect to work for a month at a time (when we change wifi wpa passwords.) </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I am using WPA2 in enterprise mode, and you are right, the vulnerability that I am talking about would be exceeding difficult to exploit, (Someone would have to do a black bag job on my residence, which isn't real likely) so I'm not overly concerned about it. </s>
<s> I'm just one of those folks that if I know of a security hole, I like to plug it. </s>
<s> When we need that we use this -&gt; www.keyghost.com So far no one has detected it. </s>
<s> They seem fixated on software solutions. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> That's a slick little device. </s>
<s> The attack I was specifically a type of MITM attack against EAP-TLS and PEAP where an attacker gets between the client and the AP. </s>
<s> During the initial phases, the attacker sends the client a bogus cert. </s>
<s> If the client is not required to validate the cert, then it blindly accepts the cert and authenticates with the bogus set up. </s>
<s> The attacker can then relay to the actual server and authenticate on to the wireless network. </s>
<s> The attacker is now in a position to intercept and decrypt all traffic between the client, and the real AP. </s>
<s> This is a fairly sophisticated attack that would be difficult to mount against a setup like mine, and there are ways to ensure that you are on the right network, but in an environment where you have a wireless network spanning multiple buildings, this could be a cause for concern. </s>
