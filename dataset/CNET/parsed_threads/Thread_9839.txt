<s> I'm currently running my first home-build system. </s>
<s> Specs are: X2 3800 2 GB DDR400 2.5,3,3,6 2T 250GB 7200 SATA2 HDD 7900 GTO I built this comp a couple of months ago with a 7600GT, which was an awesome card for just about everything(especially for the $). </s>
<s> However, I just had to get Oblivion. </s>
<s> With the 7600GT, I could play Oblivion at 1024x768 with HDR and all settings at or near max with all shadows off, and it would run pretty well. </s>
<s> I just upgraded to the 7900GTO, and I'm barely getting higher framerates, especially in graphically complex areas. </s>
<s> Am I bottlenecking at my CPU or memory? </s>
<s> I wouldn't think that to be the case, but I'm willing to hear suggestions. </s>
<s> PS-I've started OCing the video card to just under 7900GTX levels without problems, but still no big gains. </s>
<s> I've also tried ocing my cpu to 2.2GHZ with no temp adversity, but doesn't seem to help. </s>
<s> You will only see significant gain when the resolution is high enough otherwise you are bottlenecking on your cpu. </s>
<s> Try a higher resolution see if you get good framerates otherwise you might need to check your psu to see if it giving you enough power to the video card. </s>
<s> I have an Antec True Power 550, so I know it has the juice required. </s>
<s> I'll try different resolutions though. </s>
<s> that can often be an issue. </s>
<s> for instance, sapphire reccommends 12v/25 amps minimum especially with a state of the art processor. </s>
<s> just wondering about your psu amps. </s>
<s> you probably already know, its not just wattage but amps too. </s>
