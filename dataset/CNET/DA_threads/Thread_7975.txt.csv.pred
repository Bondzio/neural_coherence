1.1.1	Hi, all.	St
1.1.2	Apologies if there's something in these forums already that would have answered my question, but I somehow doubt anybody would have been as stupid as I have.	St
1.1.3	I've had a Seagate 160GB One Touch Backup USB external hard drive for about three years now, and until a year ago I had no problems with it.	St
1.1.4	I'm a college film student, and so I have certain tasks I'm asked to perform on Macs and certain tasks that I perform on my own aged Dell laptop.	St
1.1.5	(That's a whole other story, but not really relevant to this.)	St
1.1.6	Anyway, I'm generally pretty good with computers, but it somehow jumped my mental bridge that I probably shouldn't connect a drive formatted to back up my PC's hard drive, to a Mac.	St
1.1.7	If memory serves, I had done it for classes in the past and had no trouble.	St
1.1.8	But when I connected the drive to the Mac on this particular occasion, a window popped up informing me that the drive was formatted incorrectly and would I like to reformat it.	St
1.1.9	Of course, I said no, because since my laptop's hard drive filled up I had been using the external to store my iTunes library.	St
1.1.10	When I returned to my own computer and plugged the drive in, I got the Windows version of the same message.	St
1.1.11	... Long story short, no matter what operating system or hardware I connect this thing to, it tells me that it is unformatted and asks me if I would like to format it, which I can't do without risking about $400 worth of music and some important documents.	St
1.1.12	I've tried every program that came on the disc with the hard drive, but I'm not really sure what I'm doing and the programs aren't particularly user-friendly anyway; I'm afraid I'm going to erase something.	St
1.1.13	Is there anything I can do to recover my data without getting a drive recovery done?	Ques
1.1.14	Someone suggested I do that, but didn't give me any information on what sort of business would perform an operation like that anyway, and told me it would cost about as much as it would to replace my iTunes music.	St
1.2.1	Look at the demos of GETDATABACK and ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY.	St
1.2.2	The math looks good here.	Polite
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	It's back!	St
1.3.2	All of it!	St
1.3.3	For $30!	St
1.3.4	Thank you, thank you, thank you.	Polite
1.4.1	Glad to hear you found a cure.	St
1.5.1	I used Zero Assumption Recovery - I happened to try its demo first, and it worked, so I bought the whole thing.	St
1.5.2	And they were running a weekend discount, too.	St
1.5.3	I can't believe I waited a year to try a software solution.	St
