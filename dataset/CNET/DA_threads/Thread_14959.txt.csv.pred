1.1.1	Do netbooks run the regular full function version of Windows XP or is it a special netbook version with fewer features ?	Ques

1.2.1	With XP Home .	St
1.2.2	I ca n't see where anything less was installed .	St
1.2.3	As to the no optical drive , I spent 25 bucks for an external DVDRW for that unit at geeks.com .	St

1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	I barely use discs anymore anyway , get most of the software online , only needed a drive once to install a game but again Daemon tools worked	St
1.4.1	run Windows 7 on netbooks .	St
1.5.1	Here 's a link to some info : http : //blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/ ? p=2859 .	Ques
1.5.2	The netbook I have came with XP , but I 've got Windows 7 running on it right now .	St
1.5.3	Not saying it 's going to work in every instance , but for me , it 's working well .	St
1.5.4	Cheers , Ron Windows Outreach Team	St
1.6.1	I have a ThinkPad X40 .	St
1.6.2	No CD Drive .	St
1.6.3	However it came with a Docking Station that had a drive .	St
1.6.4	Most software I use is available over the net .	St
1.6.5	Thus you download and install .	St
1.6.6	Some software I 've purchased and requires a CD/DVD Drive .	St
1.6.7	I had to hack some of it to make it run without the CD/DVD check since I normally do n't have the drive .	St
1.6.8	Short answer .	St
1.6.9	& quot ; Yes no CD/DVD drive is a PITA & quot ; if you need to intall some software .	St
1.6.10	If you can get all that software over the net , or alreayd do , then it wo n't be a problem .	St
1.6.11	Re-formating the computer without a OS disk should be interesting .	St
1.7.1	Netbooks are intended to be portable companions to desktops and/or full-sized laptops , not as a primary ( only ) computer .	St
1.7.2	That 's part of the reason they lack the optical drive , it 's assumed that the owner of the netbook has another machine with an optical drive .	St
1.7.3	All you have to do is copy anything from a disc on your regular machine , then transfer it to a flash drive or external hard drive .	St
1.7.4	Plug the drive into the USB port on the netbook and install from there !	St
1.8.1	Or you can share the optical drive with your home network , and use your netbook to connect to the network ... then you will effectively have an optical drive ( even though it 's not physically attached to your netbook ) .	St
1.8.2	Else , you can get an external drive ... which can be cheap depending on where you get .	St
1.9.1	To me netbooks are kind of a hassle .	St
1.9.2	I mean I see the point in them .	St
1.9.3	But notebook computers are SO cheap nowadays .	St
1.9.4	I mean you can get a decent full running PC notebook pretty cheap .	St
1.9.5	For just a little bit more or even the same price as these netbooks you can get a budget notebook that will actually be faster and have a lot more hard drive space with CD drive .	St
1.9.6	Theres also a lot of 14.1 inch screens out now that have really powerful processors and lots of ram .	St
1.9.7	so , if you wanted small that would work also .	St
1.9.8	But I still do see the need in a netbook for some people .	St
1.9.9	Although I 'd much rather have my standard 15 inch screen notebook .	St
1.9.10	I have 4 gigs of ram , 320 gig hard drive , core 2 duo processor , hdmi port , dvd rw ... And it definitely feels portable enough for me .	St
1.9.11	Stick it in a back pack and go !	St
