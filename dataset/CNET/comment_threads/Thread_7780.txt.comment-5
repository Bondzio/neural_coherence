I did more research - am having same problem.
Dell suggests the following.
http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/kb/en/document?dn=FA1022544 See specifically ,Clearing NVRAM, about mid page.
Don't know your specific model so you may want to find out how to set jumpers for maintenance mode before you clear NVRAM.
I have bookmarked instructions for 4600C, the one I have.
Good luck.
I'm going to give it a try tomorrow.
