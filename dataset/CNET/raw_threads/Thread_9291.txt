Here's wht I have, and here's what I need: I bought a Belkin wireless g router, have installed the software on my desktop that has Win XP. That is working fine, as far as I know, I am able to get on internet from desktop with it all hooked up. Problem is, I'm not sure how to get my notebook to recognize the router. It is a Toshiba Tec 8200 that has a Wireless 802.11b PCMCIA card. I've tried Belkin's tech support for an hour online with no human, so I'm turning to the techies here. I thought maybe I had to install the router software on to my laptop, but it doesn't seem right, it's telling me not to hook up router yet, as if it's the first time. Anyway, I tried just opening Internet Explorer on my laptop, but no network settings detected. What am I doing wrong here??? My network card should be compatible as far as I know. Help!

What you need to do is go into your router and change the setting from 54g only to 54g auto. 1. go to router page (default is 192.168.2.1) 2. go to &quot;channel and SSID&quot; on left collum 3. Under wireless mode, click the arrow and change it to 54G-Auto. Hope this helps!

It gives an IP address, network drive status is loaded, etc.... I checked my device manager and the network card is working. I have 2 icons in the control panel, one says Wirelss Link, one says Wireless Network. Under Wiress Network, it ask me to add/edit Configure a profile. I have no clue what to do here. This is a second hand computer that was obviusly configured for another network. Can you help?? thanks.

Router manufacturers usually have a quick start instruction manual (usually a couple pages with pictures) that will tell you how to access the router's administration page. If you don't have this, download it from Belkin.com.

If your IP/subnet/gateway addresses are all proper for your router, you should have no trouble connecting. Report back on those figures as well as the OS and network adapter being used.

Still no luck connecting, I'm sure it has something to do with he previous server and it's probably something fairly simple but I can't figure it out.
