I have a Windows XP SP3 PC with the Generic BT 5.1.26 Radio Driver and the same version.
Windows BT enumerator I am having no trouble adding an Android device ( HTC Evo ) however, there is no connection held after the successful password matching....... Is there a newer driver that will help this connection error?
Thanks.
