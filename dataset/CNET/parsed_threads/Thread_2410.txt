<s> a comparable dell e510 w/512mb ram, a 80gb HD, but a 128mb x300 video card is $1,044 w/free shipping. </s>
<s> add your own 2gb of ram for $160 (less $50 rebate = $110) and a 250gb HD for $90 to make a comparable upgraded dell for $1,294. </s>
<s> i don't care for the integrated graphics (gma950) since a) its 'stealing' 128mb ram from the PC, b) its 3D performance is slow, and c) i don't think you'll be able to run Win Vista's Aero interface on it. </s>
<s> if those drawbacks aren't important to you, then go for it. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> That's a pretty darn fast machine, but personally, if I was going to be dishing out that much cash for a system, I'd probably get a faster processor, maybe a dual core. </s>
