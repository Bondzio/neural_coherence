I have a 200GB (Western Digital HD) drive with partition C and D. I was using PartitionMagic 8 to resize partition D when I decided to stop the operation. I did not know it had already started the process. Since now this partition (D) is messed up, I had to use Knoppix 5.1 CD to boot this computer, and rescue all the data from this partition D. After that, I decided to delete all partitions with PartitionMagic and reformat the whole drive I have Ghost backup for my main OS drive (drive C). Now, I have only 33GB of hard drive space limit on this 200GB drive. I have used the Western Digital Tool v11.2 to setup the drive, Write-To-Zero still I cannot go beyond the 32GB size. My BIOS is fine since I have been using this drive on this machine all along. 1. What can I do to regain my drive to its about 185GB size (after formatting)? 2. When using Knoppix boot CD, I had to use one of its tools called NTFSFIX to be able to unmount the drive before I could copy the files to another drive. Do you think this tool might have rattled the drives size limit? Just a thought! Though after using Knoppix, the drives size was fine. 3. The drives size was fine when I opened it in PartitionMagic 8, so do you think my problem started with Partitionmagic? I could not fine help in Symantec site on my issue. All I found would not fix the drive 33GB size limit. 4. Any utility I can use to restore the size of my drive? Thanks all for your time.

You can also try GPARTED to resize the drive but it should fail if any whiff of FAT32 or odd DOS boot manager exists. Bob

If it's PATA ...check the jumpers for CLJ ... if the drive is set to CLJ, the drive looks like a 32GB no matter how you try to change it thru software like PM. It's designed so that users can use large capacity HDDs with older systems where the MB would not recognize a drive that size. VAPCMD

I tried Windows 98 boot disk, PartitionMagic8 (Windows & DOS), XP Disk Manager, FDISK (Windows & Linux), Trinity Rescue Disk, Western Digital Tool, but the closest I got to see the whole drive was GPARTED. I could not tell what to delete to for the drive. I ran through the process, from the instruction steps. When I got to the part to enter a number for the ENDING parameters (Cylinder-Head-Sectors) I don't know what to input. When I entered, in the Partition 2, a way-off number, the drive size showed as 198+GB. The drive is 200GB and it's parameters are Cylinders-16383, Head-16, Sectors-63. The tutorial showed an example on how to change the parameters, but I could not understand it good enough, so I was scared to save the entries I already made. I will Goggle GPARTED to get more information on how to use it. If you would have more inputs, please pass it along. I really appreciate your help. Thanks.

6065	9	265840	2594453	2594436	caxtin1	9/28/07 9:32 AM	1.19097192E12	I Know	198+ was the utility number, but I am sure after formation, it will be in the range of 185+. If I can get it to see the &quot;whole&quot; drive, that will be great. Just need to know how to ue the utility properly.

The next idea is to use WDC's software. Some of their drives have the limit setting done via software. Bob

The board is a &quot;modern&quot; board and I have already installed a Seagate 200GB drive. The second computer also has a 200GB drive now. So the machines are capable of handling larger drives. Also, I use a 500GB external USB drives on both for backup. I am just looking for something that will be able to restructure the architecture of the drive, so I can redo it.

If your system can't see 200GB ...you won't be able to access, partition, format or use 200GB. Also...are you using and 80-wire, 40-pin cable or an old 40-wire, 40 pin cable ? VAPCMD BTW...What MB and BIOS version do you have ?

It's now a defective drive	This should have been solved or called a defect in about 10 minutes at our office. You've had a week or more so my thought is either you haven't done what was proposed and if you did then the drive is truly defective. It does NOT matter it worked before. Today is what counts. Bob

Yes the BIOS can't see the full size because the drive is not set right. This &quot;newer&quot; board does not have the capability to set the Cylinder, Head and Sector sizes.
6065	24	265840	2595344	2594811	caxtin1	9/29/07 10:02 AM	1.19106012E12	I Did	The Western Digital's software used to &quot;Wipe-To-Zero&quot; to a drive did not make a difference. This wipes the drive to its original form when newly purchased.

The only software that could find the whole drive is Partman (Ranish Partition Manager), but I don't know how exactly to apply the numbers for my drive. While playing with begining and ending Cylinder-Head-Sector number, I was able to see the whole size of the drive. I did not want to save the setting since I was not sure and did not want to mess up my drive for good. I will go to the maker's site tho ask question. I could not understand the user instructions enough. I attached another 200GB hard drive to the system (so the BIOS is OK). I really appreciate all your help. I will keep you posted on any achievement. Thanks
