Both of these drives are running fine but I can't get any sound on either drive of any CDs or any MP3s. I havn't got any music on the HD as I have just set-up new on that one, so I havn't tried if I could play (and hear) it. I'm running Win 2000 Pro on it. The second problem I'm having is, I conected a 56k USB-modem on this PC. Plug and play detects the new hardware every time I start up. If I try to connect to the net, it says: no modem found. I also noticed, that the power-light on the modem is not on. I tried to install the drivers of the CD that came with it, no luck. When I connect it to my XP-machine then the power-light comes on. Any recomendations would be gratly apreciated thanks.

Now I'm giving it to a friend that's just starting and wants to use it just for some Office-work and play some music on it. My problem now is, when I put a CD in either drive I can't hear any music. So I tried just about everything like changing cables, using just one drive etc. A DVD movie is just starting and playing fine but without any sound. So my last guess is, that the sound card is no good anymore. I can't check for new drivers cause I don't know the make and model of it. Thanks for any help Andreas
