1.1.1	I have a PNY Technologies Verto nVidia GeForce FX 5200 AGP 128mb DDR Graphics Card ( which I got off a clearance table ) Which I 've installed into my IBM Intellistation 6866-40U with the latest Bios PFJT48AUS running Windows 2000 Pro The configuration program , ( which has little documentation available ) for CMOS setup on the Intellistation for video , asks about & quot ; Active Video Memory & quot ; and another question about & quot ; Video Aperture & quot ; I do n't know what is meant by Video Aperture and can find no reference to it that makes sense on either IBMs or PNY 's support websites .	St
1.1.2	I 've tried a couple of configurations but CMOS recognizes the card as 4X instead of 8X ( Close but not correct ) as PNY Technologies has discontinued this card - I 'm having difficulty locating the most current set of drivers for the graphics card - They do have a driver archive but that archive goes by version numbers - I 'm unable to locate what the proper version I need for the most current driver set for this particular card beyond the disc that came with the card .	St
1.1.3	nVidia makes the chip set for the AGP card , but defers all support questions back to the card manufacturer .	St
1.2.1	The chipset from what I could google seems to point to that 's it 's max AGP speed .	St
1.2.2	2. google.com has plenty to read about that BIOS setting .	St
1.2.3	I do n't duplicate web content but note that the BIOS default is often just fine .	St
