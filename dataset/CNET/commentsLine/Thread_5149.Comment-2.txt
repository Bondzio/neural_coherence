think of it as a sandwich with the cpu on the bottom.
fan - heatsink - cpu the thermal paste is between the cpu and the heatsink (think mayo).
when the lever is down, the socket clamps snugly on the processor pins.
when you lift the lever, it unclamps the pins, and does not necessarily shift the heatsink with respect to the cpu.
so, unless there was movement, you don't need to replace the mayo...er, uh, thermal paste.
the ultimate test is as you implied; if the cpu temp is too high, then replace it.
also, check your fan speed.
cpu temp is also a relative thing.
if your system temp is 30*c, 52*c (resting) might be a little high, but if your system temp is &gt; 40*c, 52*c is not unreasonable.
