&quot;lucallback.exe&quot; is i believe norton's &quot;live update&quot; utility which is not the same as windows updates.
as for msmsgs.exe, are you leaving windows messenger running the background?
if so it may be doing various pings among other things to see if you are still connected, which icon to show, etc.
since some have time thresholds of like &quot;after 15 minutes of idle show away&quot; message.
internet explorer is a world unto itself i think in terms of its cpu and memory usage at times though it could be worth noting which version you use and if there are updates or enhancements for it.
