<s> So I have finally decided to build my first desktop from scratch. </s>
<s> As this is my first time, I am looking for some advice about the parts that I've chosen, and if there is anything that I have overlooked that could cause problems for my build. </s>
<s> My budget is $2200 (before rebates), but that budget is somewhat flexible, and if any recommendations could be made to lower the cost of my build without sacrificing too much quality that would be great. </s>
<s> Here are the parts I've picked so far for my tentative build. </s>

<s> I do need to have a mid-tower case because most full towers will not fit in the space that I have available. </s>
<s> Other than that, I don't have any preferences in particular, although I do ask that you people's suggestions stick to the basic format that I have laid out unless there is a good reason to do so. </s>
<s> Also if anyone can recommend a good inexpensive UPS for my system that would be great. </s>
<s> Thank you all for your input. </s>
<s> oh I almost forgot. </s>
<s> Are there any other miscellaneous parts or wires that I am going to need to purchase to build the computer or is pretty much everything covered. </s>
<s> I'm kind of clueless here. </s>
<s> before the P58 chipset MBs get USB 3.0 and the higher speed SATA before buying. </s>
<s> Some of the Socket 1156 MBs with the P55A chipset are already available with the higher speed USB and SATA ports...Giga-Byte has some of the P55A MBs on the market now. </s>
<s> And remember...build and test the system outside the case to ensure the components work before installing in the case. </s>
