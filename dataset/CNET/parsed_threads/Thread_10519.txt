<s> Hey, I recently purchased Shuttle xPC SD36GSM Barebone system. </s>
<s> It only comes with a 250watt Powersupply and Shuttle only offers a 300Watt PSU to purchase. </s>
<s> I want to b able to run some decent hardware in this small system because I plan it to be my new Main PC for gaming and everything else. </s>
<s> SO my question for you is: Is there any third party/other company that offers Power supplys at least 400Watts that can fit this system? </s>
<s> I hope to run a Pentium D Presler 3.4Ghz, XFX 7900GT 520/1.5Ghz, 2Gb DDR2 Ram, and the norm like DVD burner etc. </s>
<s> So does anyone know any third parties that offer PSU's that fit this case? </s>
<s> Or is there such thing as external Powersupplies for these shuttle PC's? </s>
<s> If you can answer one or all of these questions please do and thankyou very much in advance! </s>

<s> Athena Power 450W MicroATX: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817104124 Unfortunately, this looks like it is quite a gamble. </s>
<s> Plenty of people had problems getting it to work correctly, or recieved it dead. </s>
<s> That is the only one I could find. </s>
<s> Most MicroATX power supplies are very low capacity. </s>
<s> What you might have to do is take a normal ATX supply, and do some creative modding to attach it outside your case. </s>
<s> Ok thanks for the help, I will probably get one of my friends to mod the PSU, or mighht purchase the new egg one. </s>
<s> I hav an extra 450W psu around here so I will have to see. </s>
<s> Thankyou for the help Scott. </s>
<s> ...in an SFF case. </s>
<s> The crappy, small HP case might have been the cause of death for my P4. </s>
<s> So now I'm paying for a new case, AMD CPU and motherboard, and maybe a new graphics card. </s>
<s> Get an Athlon 64 X2 or just a bigger case; you won't regret it. </s>
<s> LOL </s>
<s> Oops that was my bros account. </s>
<s> He did not log off. </s>
<s> Ah sorry bout that. </s>
<s> I am lookinin at AMD cases now. </s>
<s> ...an AMD case. </s>
<s> Any old ATX case will work. </s>
<s> Here's the one which I own and love: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811119074 It's also available in silver. </s>
<s> I think your 'mini' is nothing more then a MicroATX. </s>
<s> in that case any powersupply will do. </s>
<s> Since it's a micro go for something modular (meaning you choose the cables you need while the others stay in the box and collect dust) to increase airflow. </s>
<s> Here i'll even recommend one, somehow i have a feeling you're going to ask if any of them are AMD compatible... actually never mind newegg only has one PSU for a MicroATX...and it's only 200w Build a new computer and make it a full tower </s>
<s> ...a mid tower will do. </s>
<s> Airflow think of the air flow and all that empty space for future expansions that'll easily get outdated the moment they're installed okay you're right mid tower will do </s>
