if you are using an x86 or amd64 architecture, then processor speed may not mean much if your os is slow.
core nu,mber is meaningless if there is no smp function in the kernel.
risc processors are faster, refer to instruction set.
you may have some trouble finding software compatible for such sytems and the os that comes with/ for it unless you are currently using a *n*x platform.
