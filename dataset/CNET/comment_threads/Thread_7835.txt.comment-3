Thanks for your suggestion, Michael!
I hope you won't mind a couple of follow-ups: Do I also need a router with this?
If so, what router would you recommend I purchase?
The site you referenced states it works with Windows 98SE...does it work with the regular Windows 98 as well?
My wife has a Compaq &quot;Internet Computer&quot; from 1999, which works fine, and has 2 USB ports, and runs Windows 98.
