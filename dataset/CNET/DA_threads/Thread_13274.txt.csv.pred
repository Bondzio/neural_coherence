1.1.1	guys , I have a question , can a HDD hard disk designed for windows 98 be compatible to a windows 7 pc ?	Ques
1.1.2	I will put this HD hard disk as secondary hard drive is it ok ?	Ques
1.2.1	HDD interface .	St
1.2.2	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	I do n't know of any hard disk that was designed for Windows 98 .	St
1.3.2	Are you wanting to put a hard disk with Win 98 installed on the same PC as one with Win 7 ?	Ques
1.3.3	Well , Win 7 would be able to see and read from it but you 'd probably not be able to run Win 98 on the same machine .	St
1.3.4	The primary reason is that the amount of RAM needed to run Win 7 would choke Win 98 .	St
1.3.5	Are we close to answering you here ?	Ques
1.4.1	All HDs will work provided there is no fault present .	St
1.4.2	Further , understand small older HDs may not be desired not because of OS format but rather it needs juice from PSU by being present .	St
1.4.3	Thus , I wo n't install an old HD that 's smaller than 20gb in size to be practical , IMHO .	St
1.4.4	If you want to use a smaller HD like say 10gb , etc .	St
1.4.5	mount it in the proper ext .	St
1.4.6	case and use it as ext .	St
1.4.7	HD .	St
1.4.8	Seriously consider that you think using a & quot ; flash drive & quot ; as these are very capable and come easily in 4-16gb capacity .	St
1.4.9	Of course , you have to prepare any old HD for use and in most cases that FAT32 or NTSF .	St
1.4.10	This is a generic answer and you did n't state what size old HD you 're inquiring about .	St
1.4.11	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	First a hd is not designed for an OS ... ..it 's just a storage device and could not give a hoot what OS or data you put on it .	St
1.5.2	The maybe part .	St
1.5.3	Hd 's from the w98 era were PATA .	St
1.5.4	Hd 's from the win7 era are SATA .	St
1.5.5	The cables and plugs are different .	St
1.5.6	So a quick eye-ball of the old hd connectors and the connectors available in the machine might be of value .	St
