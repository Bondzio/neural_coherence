Review the audio driver at http://www.ecs.com.tw/ECSWeb/Downloads/ProductsDetail_Download.aspx?DetailID=351&DetailName=Driver&DetailDesc=K7VTA3 (V6.0)&MenuID=35&LanID=0 Then see if there is a SPEAKER type on the audio control panel.
Also that all settings are pushed up and not muted.
If that fails, disable the onboard sound and install a PCI sound card.
Sorry, I'll skip noting trying other speakers or which plug to put the speakers into.
Also will skip noting about using amplified speakers.
