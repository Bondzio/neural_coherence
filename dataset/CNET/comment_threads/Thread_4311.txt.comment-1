When I try to play music on my laptop, it's very slow to load/ play.
The hd space within my laptop is pretty much full now, so I'm thinking that's my problem.
If I were to get myself an external hd with tons more space, loaded my music & music playback software on *that*- it should all run normally, right?
I just wanna be sure 1st before I plunk down $$$.
