My guess is that it would, but you need to check the specs of the printer. You mentioned an adapter - again I repeat my dog broke my crystal ball. What kind of adapter and why do you think you need one? Too bad about that dog, isn't it.

I need an adapter because I want to hard wire both computers to the HP deskjet d4160 printer

If you share the printer between computers, you wouldn't need what you're calling an adapter. Otherwise I'd say unless you want to set up a server, what you're talking about is an A-B switch which for me would be a royal pain. There're wireless printers around that might be something to consider as well. My dog is OK, but I sure miss that crystal ball.
