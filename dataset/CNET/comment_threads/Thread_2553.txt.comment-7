Since my computer has already &quot;crashed&quot;, I must assume I will be using the floppy &quot;A&quot; drive since nothing else works at present.
Most solutions seem to require a functioning cd drive.
Fortunately, this is a refurbished unit for &quot;learning&quot; purposes and has nothing to lose, although I did make a data backup for some reason.
I have an MS DOS boot disk, and the 6 floppiy Win XP Setup disks, if required.
Most of the Repair Software seems to require a functioning cd drive, which I have not.
Due to my blunder, I am past that stage.I will never again run any program that touches my registry, although &quot;CC Cleaner&quot; was reviewed by CNET.
As it is past midnight here, I will start tomorrow, after checking back at this website for further advice.
Grats!.
