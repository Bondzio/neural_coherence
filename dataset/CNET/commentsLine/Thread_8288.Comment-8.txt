i don't usually duplicate the ubuntu site.
use their site and tutorials and it's usually fine.
that is, i usually find folk are making up something undocumented and wondering why it doesn't work.
there is a clue &quot;i tired to eject the usb and message said the file was in use by system but could not see anything&quot; as that tells me you did not boot from the usb drive.
