1.1.1	We have an older Compaq laptop connected to an NEC 860 Superscript printer .	St
1.1.2	When you go to print , the little printer icon flashes on very briefly on the taskbar and then it disappears-and printer does n't print .	St
1.1.3	In the device manager , the message indicates that the printer is working properly ( but it is n't ) .	St
1.1.4	Anybody have this problem and what have you done to solve problem ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks .	Polite
1.1.6	PS OS is Win 98 .	St
1.2.1	The last time this sort of thing happened it was a dead printer port .	St
1.2.2	The owner paid dearly as I charged them for the priviledge of a lesson in electronics , schematics , parallel interfaces and the use of an oscilloscope as well as the loopback parallel port tester .	St
1.2.3	Not that I did n't mind , but they wanted & quot ; proof & quot ; the parallel port was dead .	St
1.2.4	It was only 100 for the hour , but they were not so upset but that the laptop parallel port is only repaired by changing the motherboard ... That 's one possibility .	St
1.2.5	You would also install printer drivers , try other printer cables , try another printer and if you have a LAN , try to print over a network to avoid the cost of a new motherboard .	Sug
1.2.6	Best of luck , Bob	Polite
