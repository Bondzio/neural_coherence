My second hard disk processes slowly, and for a while wasn't even recognized by the computer as existing.
PDFs, when opened, look distorted, but if copied to the master drive they function normally.
I'm running a disk check right now to see if it is just a bad hard drive, I've had it for a while and it used to be fine, but it only had a few files on it.
Now I use it for more files and it has started being slow.
Disk check has been running for 6 hours or so and I'm only at 134 out of around 125 thousand sections.
