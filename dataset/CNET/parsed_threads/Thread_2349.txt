<s> I have been trying to connect to the internet and to the other computers that are both on the LAN. </s>
<s> I get the following messages on the two frequently used computers on the LAN: Status: Limited or no connectivity You might not be able to access the Internet or some network resources. </s>
<s> This problem occurred because the network did not assign a network adress to the computer. </s>
<s> If clicking Repair does not restore connectivity, the problem might be with the network, not with this computer&quot; I tried to repair and this was unsuccessful. </s>
<s> I updated my Lavasoft Ad-Aware SE Professional ref. </s>

<s> I am using an IBM ThinkPad (XP Professional SP 2, Intel Pentium M 1400MHz 598 MHz. </s>

<s> I had to connect to internet via 56k Modem. </s>
<s> I just updated ref. </s>

<s> The other computer is a &quot;clone&quot; (correct term?) </s>
<s> running XP Home SP 2, Pentium 4,...) The LAN was running perfect 2 days ago up to now and i checked all cables. </s>
<s> DSL modem says all go. </s>
<s> Is there any other information u need? </s>
<s> I need my internet back! </s>
<s> ** My apologies, i created identical discussions in other forums but it took me a while to find out where exactly to post it. </s>
<s> Wired and or wireless? </s>
<s> Up to date firmware for the router? </s>
<s> it is a wired LAN. </s>

<s> Im using a D-Link DES-1008D switch. </s>
<s> It is a product of D-Link in Australia & New Zealand, France and UK. </s>
<s> These websites show that they are no drivers available for this product. </s>
<s> Does that mean its not the problem then? </s>
<s> Im sure this problem is not so rare and the fix isnt too tedious. </s>
<s> The hardest part is finding out what to do. </s>

<s> switch. </s>
<s> As such your network configuration needs some clarification. </s>
<s> Which device goes into what other device and how it connects needs to be explained. </s>
<s> What type of Internet Connection software is being used in lieu of a router? </s>
<s> Further, when you connect the DSL modem directly to the PC you would need to run the DSL install software being used by the ISP. </s>
<s> Entries such as user name and password needs to be authenticated when not using a router. </s>
<s> i have 2 PC's (98, XP) plus a laptop (XP) that are connected to the switch. </s>
<s> The 98 machine is rarely used. </s>
<s> Each computer has its own &quot;network wire (RJ-45? </s>
<s> )&quot; hooked up to the switch. </s>
<s> The DSL is also hooked up to the switch. </s>
<s> is that what u wanted to know? </s>
<s> flawed. </s>
<s> The first computer to log on will grab the IP address from the modem. </s>
<s> If another computer logs in no IP address will be available. </s>
<s> The correct configuration would be to: 1) Add a router between the modem and the PCs or 2) Use a proxy server program or ICS to dish out the LAN IPs to the various PCs. </s>
