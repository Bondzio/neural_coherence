1.1.1	I'm going to connect my graphics card to my HDT, but the graphics card end looks like this: http://www.jaycar.com.au/products_uploaded/productLarge_8864.jpg And I keep seeing cables like this: http://cdn.overstock.com/images/products/L10528975.jpg Does it work :&lt; ?	Ques
1.2.1	your graphics card has dvi output (your first picture).	St
1.2.2	if your tv has dvi input, you need a dvi-to-dvi cable ( example ).	St
1.2.3	if your tv has hdmi input, you need a dvi-to-hdmi cable ( example ).	St
1.3.1	Two, actually.	St
1.3.2	So I'm guessing that DVI to HDMI cable is the right one?	St
1.4.1	If your T.V does have an HDMI slot than I would get (well actually I have already gotten) http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812189056 Works flawlessly for me.	St
1.5.1	I have the same cable and used it when my monitor died.	St
1.5.2	Great cable and that price is just awesome.	St
1.5.3	I just used the little 30 inch LCD TV 720P until I could decide on a new monitor.	St
