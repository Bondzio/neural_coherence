i have been there.
i have watched about 6 videos and 30 sites including amazon and ebay to view over 300 different drives dating from mid '07 to current.
there are 3 (so far) types that claim to be oem replacement supers for the already installed optical.
some claim the replacement is sata and some claim pata all for the exact model i have.
removing the current drive and looking at what's in there is an option but the satas and patas both claim to offer the adapting cable to utilize the other format.
i have been building and configuring computers for 22 years.
from the old pizza box desktops to uu19 racks and this is the craziest thing i've ever run accross.
it's a a1181, feb 2008, mb402ll/a, macbook 4.1, dual core 2.1, currently running snow leopard.
how hard should this be?
all three types listed in my first post claim to be oem.
this is a crapshoot.
if i can't get specific info to buy the drive (ranging from $25 to $200) i'm just going to throw a dart and see where it lands.
thanks for the response so far, i do appreciate it.
i'm just frustrated.
