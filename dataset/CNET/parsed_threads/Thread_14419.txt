<s> this morning i tried turning my desktop PC on and it wouldn't boot. </s>
<s> No power light on, and on closer inspection the fan turns feebly for half a second or so, then it all stops. </s>
<s> I have tried unplugging the power cable and plugging it in again, which has worked before with this issue, but no luck this time. </s>
<s> any suggestions of what this could be? </s>
<s> How do I fix it? </s>
<s> You better answers provide full details of your PC as best as possible. </s>
<s> Repeat you past remedy, unplug AC cord for 10min. </s>
<s> and then retry. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work then that suggests your PSU is bad, replace with similar or more wattage unit. </s>
<s> You should inspect the insides very closely for any &quot;bad caps&quot; issue, google for examples and it needn't be a real bad failure. </s>
<s> More than likely its a bad PSU, excluding any other fault. </s>
<s> Since, you've experienced this before usually means it was going until a total failure. </s>

<s> Is it new.....is it old ? </s>
<s> Big Box PC or Clone ? </s>

<s> (1) Try to clear the CMOS. </s>
<s> There is a CMOS jumper (2 or 3 pin header) on the motherboard. </s>
<s> e.g. </s>
<s> for a 2pin header, Closing the pins could clear & open could be normal function. </s>
<s> Depending on what motherboard you have got, the story could be the other way round. </s>
<s> (2) Check your memory. </s>
<s> if the memory is short, the PC turns for half a sec & stops. </s>
<s> (3) Remove the CPU. </s>
<s> Put it back after 2 to 3mins. </s>
<s> (4) Try another Power Supply Unit. </s>
<s> unplugging a few things first. </s>
<s> In a situation like this I would unplug all hard drives, CD/DVD drives, and pull out all memory. </s>
<s> Then try to start computer. </s>
<s> If it starts with everything unplugged, then turn it off and try plugging in devices one at a time, restarting after each device to determine where the problem lies. </s>
<s> If it won't fire after unplugging all of these items, you have at least eliminated several possible problems. </s>
