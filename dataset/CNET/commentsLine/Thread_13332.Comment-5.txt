i need help with this problem as well.
i am using windows xp home edition on a laptop and xp profesional on a pc.
i recently set up a netgear wireless router and it all worked fine for about a week.
then last night, i dont know what happened but it all went wrong on both computers.
i have managed to fix it on the pc but the laptop wont work.
i only have one wireless usb connection that i swapped between the computers when i wanted to use the internet.
the laptop says that it is connected, but it is revieving 'packets' for some reason.
i cant connect propperly to the internet.
it wont lest me use any of programes for the internet (microsoft or other).
i have seen this wep thing somewhere whilst trying to fix it but i cant remember where i seen it.
i have been trying all day now and it is really starting to p*ss me off.
can somebody please help as i am tempted to just abandon technology all together.
