warranty, replace the drive and work out a way to disassemble the drive and destroy the platter/disks.
Sad drive mfgs don't/won't offer to return defective HDDs along with the replacement drive after determining the returned drive was defective under warranty replacement.
Looks like a way to win customer loyalty to me after the product failure.
