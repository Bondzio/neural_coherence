<s> Our local high school has quite a few very old computers locked away in a closet. </s>
<s> Is there any place that they could give these computers to that might actually make use of them? </s>
<s> Ideally I would like to see the school get some money for them but if that's not possible I'd rather see some organization put them to use rather than just tossing them. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Alot depends on your area and how big it is for any local organization. </s>
<s> You can google away for some outside source and/or recycling organization. </s>
<s> They're out there but you may still need to pay to ship. </s>
<s> For the most part forget about getting any money for old stuff, too much out there. </s>
<s> Next time the school runs into extra items, see if the vendor they buy from will accept used items as part of the deal, push for it. </s>
<s> Check charities and the like and see what if anything they will accept, they have limits too, so inquire. </s>
