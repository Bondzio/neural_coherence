The geek squad said it was a green chip in the mother board. I am not savvy on the lingo as you can tell. So I bought a new hp with vista. It seems to work pretty good for me. My question is what to do with the drive in my old computer. I heard you should not just throw it away because it contains alot of stuff. Can I hook it up to my new one or have my it guy at work load it on a disk or beat it with a hammer? Hope To get an answer. Thanks
