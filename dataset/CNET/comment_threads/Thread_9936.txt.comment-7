The PC will only draw what it needs.
Even cheap 450W supplies are in the 20 dollar range.
You are pressing your luck with 300, but I really would like to know the make/model motherboard since I just came across one that only did up to some 2.0 GHz Celeron.
While the 2.4GHz Celeron did appear to run, it was unstable.
