allright... something is wrong with my display - whenever i boot up my comp now, its checkerboard colors... i can tell that it is changing and loading, but something is wrong.
i sent my videocard back to ati, and got a new one back but it didnt help any.
ive got an amd 2500+ oc'ed to a 3000+ i have - ati radeon aiw 9800 pro 512 mb ram basically, i need a mobo that is agp compatible and a decent cpu to go with it; and also it needs to have decent onboard audio because i have a 4.1 logitech system.
i have amd now, but would not care really if it was amd or intel, whatever is better for the money.
i plan on ditching the mobo/cpu i have now bvecause i feel like it would be too much of a hastle to swap cpus with a new mobo... not to mention the cpu might be the prob anyway.
i spent around $200 when i built the comp 3 years ago... i would prefer to spend about that or less if i could.
thanks in advance for any help!
