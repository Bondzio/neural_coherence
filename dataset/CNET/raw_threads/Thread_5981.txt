So whenever I put my desktop to sleep and then turn it back on, I cannot connect to the internet. My laptops are fine and can connect to the internet w/ the wireless however. When I have windows diagnostic run a troubleshoot and repair, it tells me it can't communicate w/ the primary DNS server and that resetting the Local Area Connection will fix it (And it does). If I restart the computer, it seems to fix this problem as well. Here's a pic: http://i42.tinypic.com/30m0p5w.png I don't get why it can't communicate w/ the DNS and that I have to manually reset the LAC everytime I turn on the computer from sleep mode... If it helps: I got a vista xp desktop, a netgear n600 wireless router, and an Arris Touchstone Telephony Modem TM402G I'm a bit of a computer newb/average, so please don't get too complex

Most common reason is the user updated the driver with driver finders or that update button. Return to the driver that came with the card/machine. Bob

I'm running WinVista and have not intentionally updated any drivers. Other devices work fine (phone, tablet). How can I tell if my drivers were updated and how do I get them back?
