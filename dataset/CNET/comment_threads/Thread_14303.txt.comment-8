Thank you Rick!
I am 99% sure mine does go: Cable &gt; Wireless Router &gt; Cable modem &gt; wired desktop, because I believe that's how the instructions said to do it!
I am going to redo the connections as you suggested.
Will I also have to change any settings because of this setup change, or should changing the connection order alone do the trick??
Thank you again!
I will be so happy to get this pesky problem corrected!
