<s> I just replaced the cpu fan on my computer. </s>
<s> I had to take the motherboard out to get to it because the screwdriver kept slipping (Athlon Xp a462). </s>
<s> I put everything back together exactly how I found it. </s>
<s> Then, when I hit the power button my new fan starts spinning and everything sounds good but nothing show up on the monitor (says no signal). </s>
<s> I know the monitor is good because it worked before I took everything apart. </s>
<s> I have already reseated the ram, and cpu, and checked voltage on the cmos battery (3v). </s>
<s> Did I kill my motherboard? </s>
<s> Thanks, All help appreciated. </s>
<s> By the way my specs are: Pc Chips m825g Athlon xp processor 1.67ghz </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Is the video cable plugged in? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Any beeps? </s>
<s> Watch what happens to most Athlon XP chips if you don't get the heatsink and compound right at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCmai6Q9DoM </s>
<s> The video cable is plugged in and there are NO beeps surprisingly. </s>
<s> -&gt; Tell us about the heatsink compound. </s>
<s> The video I shared showed how fast this CPU smokes if the heatsink isn't on proper. </s>
<s> The big clue is &quot;no beeps.&quot; In closing type BAD CAPS on google.com for another cause. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> There was not much heatsink compound on the old fan. </s>
<s> On the new one there was plenty already applied. </s>
<s> I'll have to take a look at the caps later. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
