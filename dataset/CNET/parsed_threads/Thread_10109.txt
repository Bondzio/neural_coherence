<s> I HAVE A HP PAVILION A706N and I WANT TO UPGRADE IT AND BUT EVRY THING TO MAKE IT A GAMING COMPUTR SO I CAN PLAY BATTLEFIELD 2 AND DOOM 3 AT HIGH SETTINGS!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> upgrade to 1gb of ram, upgrade psu and case, then upgrade to 6800gt </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> WHAT IS SO HARD ABOUT USING NORMAL PUNCTUATION!? </s>
<s> Honestly, why can't you just type like this? </s>
<s> Aside from that, until you are able to stop yelling I will refuse to assist you, but I don't suggest what nerdyboy does. </s>
<s> Upgrading the case would mean a new motherboard as it will not fit properly. </s>
<s> a new motherboard will mean a new operating system. </s>
<s> I suggest to upgrade to 2x512sticks of PC3200 ram. </s>
<s> And get a decent card that will not take up too much cpu power. </s>
<s> Maybe the 9600xt or w/e, definitely not the 9800pro which is very good, but not sure if the psu can handle. </s>
<s> On nvidias side, maybe the 6600 not gt. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> but i play the games wont it not have enuf juice and just crash </s>
<s> as it's not a rule here like other forums have it as a rule. </s>
<s> i know it's annoying but so what, spelling wrong is annoying and i spell alot of things wrong. </s>
<s> help the guy out and not just post &quot;dont type in caps or im not going to help you.&quot; anyway, upgrade your ram, your psu (antec ocz enermax) and then your graphics card. </s>
<s> i would go with the 6600 for bf2 and doom 3 as nvidia do better in both. </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> 9600-Work,but pretty crappy, but still better than what you have currently. </s>
<s> 6600-might not enough power 9800pro-definitel not 6600gt ^ -No WAY </s>
<s> fine ill jus get a psu and get a 6600 for 170 from new egg and memory? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Okay sounds good. </s>
<s> The psu might not fit though. </s>
<s> If it doesn't, well, time for a case mod. </s>
<s> Hope you know some metalshop. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> i'd get a 9800Pro and a PSU as a 9800Pro is around $20 or $30 cheaper than the 6600GT, and should handle as well as the 6600 and then for a new PSU i'd suggest ensuring that you can install it in an HP computer (Dell for example uses a proprietary PSU design, my old HP uses a normal ATX design, what does yours use?) </s>
<s> i dunno ok imma get a 9800pro price ?? </s>
<s> imma get a 1GB price 80$ imma get a psu price ?? </s>
<s> ill try to find a pic of it online </s>
<s> as they support sm 3 and fp32 </s>
