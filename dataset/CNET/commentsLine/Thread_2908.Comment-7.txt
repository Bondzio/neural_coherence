sorry... i don't know how else to state it... the question was always about the motherboard sata connections, hence the title of the topic and my not understanding your insistence on knowing what video card the link was for.
as in the first sentence of my opening post, the specs / models etc.
for the pc components are in the sig (bottom) of that post, so any description beyond that is beyond me at present.
i've heard that sata connections 5-8 (which are out of the way of the video card) are for raid setups only, but my system (as stated in the sig) is indeed in raid 0. once again, my question is... can you &quot;skip&quot; past the first 4 sata connections on the mb and plug the 2 hd's into 5&6?
if yes, will it just boot and run, or is there some kind of bios or raid or other reconfiguration needed?
