provides the normal external connector but also with a port for internal connection, BUT also make certain the connectors match, there are 6 pin versions and 4 pin versions.
Some cases with front ports simply provide a cable to feed out the rear of the case and plug into the firewire port on the outside rear of the case.
Others provide a cable for internal connection to pins on the mobo [or the card type that I mentioned.].
Inow not which type that you have, BUT have a great day.
