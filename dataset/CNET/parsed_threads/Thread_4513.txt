<s> I have a Funai WD5B-N8480ZB machine which can dub my old videos on to DVD's. </s>
<s> In the manual it says that 5 recording speeds are possible, but, after carefully perusing the whole manual from end to end, nowhere does it tell how to do this! </s>
<s> Does anyone know? </s>
<s> Gthanks Gerald </s>
<s> But it's possible they didn't document it and expect the owner to explore all the menus. </s>

<s> they all have a &quot;rec mode&quot; button on the remote that sets the recording speed. </s>
<s> Take a look at that. </s>
<s> Actually, I had explored the menus with no success, but Ahtoi had the answer. </s>
<s> There is, indeed a button on the remote setting th recording speed. </s>
<s> Thanks for the tip. </s>
