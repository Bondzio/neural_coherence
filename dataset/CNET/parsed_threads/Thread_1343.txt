<s> I'm new to laptops, just got my first (used) one, and it does not have a built-in modem, so I have to use a PCMCIA modem. </s>
<s> I notice that the PCMCIA modem card becomes hot rather quickly. </s>
<s> I would prefer to leave the PCMCIA card in the laptop all the time rather than frequently plugging an unplugging it. </s>
<s> Is this advisable? </s>
<s> Will the heat generated damage the PCMCIA card if it is left in the laptop for hours? </s>
<s> I also notice that the dial-up internet connection tends to break rather frequently. </s>
<s> I also have USB modem which works better but is less portable. </s>
<s> Are PCMCIA modem cards generally not so good with maintaining connections, or just this particular (cheap) one that I have? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> due to the heat. </s>
<s> My first wireless card went bad on me and started &quot;bulging&quot;. </s>
<s> A friend had another do the same thing. </s>
<s> Both crapped out after about 1.5 years. </s>
<s> If you're always using the card, then there's not really anything you can do differently. </s>
<s> Taking it out of the PC when you're not using it will help, but just expect to get another in a year or two. </s>
