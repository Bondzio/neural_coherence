1.1.1	Alright so we just bought a new Belkin N Router .	St
1.1.2	The only way for my computer to be connected is for it to be wirelessly connected .	St
1.1.3	But the wireless adapter I have is n't detecting the network .	St
1.1.4	I 've got a D-Link G usb adapter .	St
1.1.5	Is there any way to make the wireless adapter G adapter compatible with my N Router ?	Ques
1.1.6	I 've also got a Belkin G wireless adapter , is there any way to make that compatible as well ?	Ques
1.2.1	the SSID from the router ?	Ques
1.2.2	Encryption ?	Ques
1.2.3	Laptop or desktop ?	Ques
1.2.4	Desktop , dump the USB and get a PCI adapter .	St
1.3.1	Hypothetically is SHOULD work , sometimes there can be issues .	St
1.3.2	For a desktop I would take the prior poster 's advice , slot card as opposed to usb adapter , better ranging .	St
1.3.3	Back to SHOULD work , been there more than once with mix and match hdwe , can be frustrating .	St
1.3.4	So generally what I do is match hdwe/ software .	St
1.3.5	Bite the bullet , since you are using a specific manufacturer 's router ( N ) match the router with the same manufacturer 's slot card and use the N to get better ping potential .	St
