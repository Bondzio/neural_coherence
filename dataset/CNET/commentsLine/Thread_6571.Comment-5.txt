bob, i have no idea what is, or where i'd find something called, a region status identification program!
but, the model number of my drive is md-18xtfe.
but wouldn't you think it really wouldn't matter, considering the dude at mad dog told me the drive was incompatible with itunes?
or do you think there might be a chance it could be the firmware, and he didn't know what he was talking about?
(i did check out newegg.com and found an external drive by lg that is in my price range.
i'm going to email them and ask if it will work with itunes.)
