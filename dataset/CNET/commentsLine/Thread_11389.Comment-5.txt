my reply you tagged on to was posted in 2004, so it maybe better for you in the future to start a new post in order to get better responses.
as for your problem, while the system will in all honestly report what it finds.
it can't differ when the usb has been enabled under the bios area, all available hubs/controller as it were are acknowledged.
what i suspect is you have a usb connection on the mtrbd.
that yet doesn't have the int.
harness for ext.
usb ports.
you have the &quot;possibility&quot; of more ports provided you attach the harness and then avail the new usb ports to some panel.
this isn't uncommon, so i suggest you review your manual or visit support website and locate the specs of the mtrbd./system.
you gave no mention of your system, but if this is a diy type, then review that manual.
this maybe to your advantage, as you can only locate 2 physical usb ports now, you could have access to 5 more.
if you need more usb info, try these websites:    (try it) tada -----willy
