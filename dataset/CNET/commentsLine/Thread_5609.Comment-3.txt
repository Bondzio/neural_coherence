some dsl modems are actually modem/routers and have to be put in bridge mode if you want it to work correctly with another router.
for example, i'm using a westell 2200 that was provided with my verizon dsl service that needs to be bridged to work properly with my router (which is, coincidentally, an mr814 v2).
