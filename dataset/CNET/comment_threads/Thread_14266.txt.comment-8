Consider yourself lucky that you have anything.
I found some of the cheap flash drives not worth keeping after 1yr.
(they die much sooner) they simply crap out.
However, name brands do well and if you get a high quality one, then at least it should serve you until you're done with it.
Be aware that &quot;static/ESD&quot; is very much part of the shorten life cycle of a flash drive, ground yourself or your flash drive becomes the flash point(no pun intended) to discharge static.
