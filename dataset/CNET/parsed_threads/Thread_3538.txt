<s> I have decided to get one of the new AMD X2's - either a 4200 or 3800. </s>
<s> I have been looking at the set up for the Gateways and Hp's. </s>
<s> I have heard inthe past that Gateways are very difficult to upgrade anything with out it being a Gateway product. </s>
<s> Has this changed ? </s>
<s> I have also heard that the Hp has some problems with dependability. </s>
<s> Just wanting to get the most bang for the buck. </s>
<s> Gateway or Hp. </s>
<s> Are you confident enough to do it? </s>
<s> I can only speak from experience, but our family has 3 HP pc's, the oldest is a winter 2000 model and it still works fine, never any trouble from any of them. </s>
<s> My next one will be my own build, you get what you want that way and you can make sure it will be upgradeable. </s>
<s> Just some thoughts, good luck on whatever you decide. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
