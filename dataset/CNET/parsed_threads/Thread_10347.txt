<s> I have a Syntax SV400a MOBO, and recently decided to upgrade processor from xp1700 to a xp2600. </s>
<s> So I do all my research and perform this properly, but my system is reading my new processor as an Athlon 1.15Ghz. </s>
<s> Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought it should be somewhere around 1.9 - 2.1 Ghz? </s>
<s> Do have to do the Flash Bios thing? </s>
<s> You don't have to flash the BIOS (ie: update it), but you do have to make some changes to its settings. </s>
<s> Someone on the board should have the correct settings, but I can't recall them (the settings, that is) off the top of my head. </s>
<s> Read the book that came with the MB. </s>
<s> You may only have to change the FSB speed in bios or a jumper on the MB. </s>
<s> Check the MB web site for current info. </s>
