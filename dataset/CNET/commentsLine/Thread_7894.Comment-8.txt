ok idk how to edit my post... anyway, you pointed out vga, dvi-d = no hdcp, is that referring mainly to the vga part?
since acer specifications for acer x203w states that it has dvi-d too but is hdcp lol, kinda newbie here so really confused.
also, this monitor isn't too old, i got it last october or so.
in fact the acer x203w is the older one so i kinda wonder why calypso didnt implement it in their monitors.
ive also emailed company but have no responses yet.
