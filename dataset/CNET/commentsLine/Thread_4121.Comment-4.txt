hey, some advice from an editor here.
decide on which edit system you want to go with first, if you want to go more high-end then you should know that the edit suites are picky with video cards and the like.
especially avid, if you have an ati and want to go avid you're s.o.l.
...the main 'pro' edit applications these days are avid and final cut pro for the mac, with premiere pro at second.
even then you'll want to check premiere's specs.
even for low-end editing i'd get an nvidia quadro card of some sort.
high-end edit machines tend to work best when you use them as edit suites alone and lose the msn-ish junk on there as well.
avid doesn't even like it when i have wallpaper on my pc.
