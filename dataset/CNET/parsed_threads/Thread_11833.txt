<s> Can anybody help explain what I need to do in basic none-computing terminology to resolve my problem. </s>
<s> A friends laptop broke and they had the whole harddrive backed-up onto my home PC, software, program, files and folders the whole lot. </s>
<s> She bought a Toshiba MK6025GAS portable hard drive to move it all off my PC and onto her new one. </s>
<s> It comes with just USB cable which when I plug it in the USB icon at the bottom of my screen is displayed but my PC does not recognise it as a 'Drive' at all so I cannot select it to copy to it. </s>
<s> The hard disk came with no instructions and I am at a total loss as what to do! </s>
<s> In Systems&gt;Device Manager it is displayed simply as 'Toshiba MK6025GAS USB Device' but cannot be selected. </s>
<s> HELP!! </s>
<s> I have very little 'computer' know-how and am stuck as to what I need to do..can anyone help me in baby steps? </s>
<s> My PC has Windows XP home edition. </s>
<s> Many Thanks for any help offered in advance </s>
<s> New drives arrive blank and will not show a drive letter. </s>

<s> Thank You for such a quick and helpful reply. </s>
<s> The article you suggested was easy to follow and I now have a working portable 'S' drive! </s>
<s> We can then write... Look at the &quot;S&quot; car go! </s>
<s> Best of continued luck and here's hoping you you've heard the joke. </s>
