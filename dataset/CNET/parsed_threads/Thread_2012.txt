<s> Hi, I have a USB Pen Drive, but my USB port is blocked. </s>
<s> Need to store data in the Pen Drive. </s>
<s> So, if I connect the USB Pen Drive to the PS2 port using a PS2-USB adaptor , shall i be able to store data in the pen drive ? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Why not try it? </s>
<s> Or better: why not unblock the USB-port? </s>

<s> I tried to unblock it , by doing something in the registry (i cant remember what i did) , but didn't work. </s>
<s> Can u suggest how to do that? </s>
<s> by the USB port is blocked? </s>
<s> You mentioned the registry. </s>
<s> More information is needed such as PC, OS, etc. </s>
<s> Sorry but the answer is NO and furthermore DON'T DO THAT!!! </s>
<s> You could blow the PS2 keyboard/mouse port or damage the USB Pen Drive. </s>
<s> If you missed the answer. </s>
<s> NO! </s>
