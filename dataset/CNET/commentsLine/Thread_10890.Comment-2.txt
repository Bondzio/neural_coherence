so few tablets support hard disks that it's not funny.
my guess is your tablet list will shrink so fast that this alone may make the choice for you.
and if we entertain a wireless hard drive, you might launch into a dozen other questions.
the online modus is something most if not all tablets that you read about (kindle, nexus, samsung) do fine.
what is &quot;good battery life&quot;?
the life span of most batteries is set by the cycles.
most are 300 so if you charged daily i expect 2 to 3 years before replacement.
if you are talking how long the tablet runs on a charge that gets you into the no one knows area since you can double the run time by turning off wifi, bluetooth and dimming the screen on most models.
turn everything on, gps and push up the brightness and the time plummets.
