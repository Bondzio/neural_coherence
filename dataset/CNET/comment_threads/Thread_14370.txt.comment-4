http://support.microsoft.com/?scid=253912 The workaround essentially tells Windows 95/98/98SE/ME to limit itself to 512 MB.
So there's no reason to go past that amount since you may have to tell it to curb itself at 512 MB.
The MAKE/MODEL of the machine or if no make/model then the MAKE/MODEL of the motherboard is required to look at the issue.
-&gt; BUT KNOW THIS!
There are BX and other based boards that can't use 256MB sticks you buy at the grocery store.
I can find the technical documents as to why this is so, but at the end of the story, the memory controller doesn't support the 256 MB stick you have it the stick shows up as only 128 MB.
There is NO FIX to make these memory sticks work in this motherboard with this chipset.
But http://www.crucial.com does sell the right 256 MB sticks for this system.
Hope this helps, Bob Bob
