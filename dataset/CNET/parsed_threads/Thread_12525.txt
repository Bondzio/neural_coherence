<s> Hello, I am running a computer with Windows 7 Service pack 1 64 bit OS and I'm trying to install a wireless Canon MX420 printer. </s>
<s> My computer is connected to my router through an ethernet cord and I have managed to set up my printer's wifi just fine. </s>
<s> It appears connected on the printer's screen and I have disabled all firewalls on my computer yet it still won't detect it... </s>
<s> Please any help and insight would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Have you installed the printer's software onto the Win 7 computer? </s>
<s> As I understand it, you have to &quot;Add a Network, wireless or Bluetooth printer&quot; to Win 7 using the wizard in the Start &gt; &quot;Devices and Printers&quot; folder, so you may have to do that as well. </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> I have done that yes.. After more research I am concerned that my computer may simply not have a wireless adapter enabled but I can't figure out how to check that. </s>
<s> When I go to networking options I select the network adapter options and only find my ethernet. </s>
<s> This is odd because I have had a printer wirelessly print and scan before... </s>
<s> What are you using for a router? </s>
<s> Just off the top I would suspect router issue(s). </s>
<s> I use a Motorola surfboard from Midco - less than a year old. </s>
<s> Or have wifi. </s>
<s> Since there are more models I can't guess which you have. </s>
<s> And I do have the Canon MX870 working great here. </s>

<s> You said in your first post that your Win7 computer is connected to your router via an ethernet card. </s>
<s> If so, it does not need a wireless adapter and that should not affect it seeing and connecting to the printer. </s>
<s> While I bow to the change discussion about the router and I accept there may be some setting or other there that needs looking at, I'm still puzzled what the computer's wizard said when you used it to connect to this printer. </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> The router has wifi - I use it around the house with my laptop and my nook without a problem. </s>
<s> When I try to connect the printer either by local port \\compname\printername or by the IP address that the printer lists that it occupies while connected to the wifi - it keeps saying error port does not exist or it tries to detect until it times out. </s>
<s> I tried today to unplug my ethernet cord from the PC and try to create a wireless connection and see if that's the problem and I don't even see my network's name or any of my neighbors' for that matter on the wireless connections my PC is seeing. </s>
<s> I'm thinking that's where the problem lies but not sure how to proceed from here. </s>
<s> In that case I have to pass. </s>
<s> I was under the impression the printer connection to the router was fine; &quot; I have managed to set up my printer's wifi just fine. </s>
<s> It appears connected on the printer's screen &quot;. </s>
<s> May be Bob's observation is right. </s>
<s> His surfboard didn't have wifi. </s>
<s> He asked if you had a different model. </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> The printer's connection to the router -is- fine. </s>
<s> As I mentioned above the printer is connected, my nook is connected, my laptop is connected. </s>
<s> There no reason to think the wifi doesn't work - it does. </s>
<s> the problem is on the PC's side. </s>
