1.1.1	Hi : I 've done a search here , but ca n't find my problem .	St
1.1.2	I have purchased a second SATA hard drive from Dell .	St
1.1.3	The first one came in my 4-year-old Dell Dimension 8300 .	St
1.1.4	I finally figured out , with help from someone here , that I need jumpers to designate one drive as master and the other slave .	St
1.1.5	In a chat with Dell , I was given a phone number to talk to the folks at Dell spare parts .	St
1.1.6	I ca n't repeat here what I said before I hung up on the & quot ; tech , & quot ; but he told me that Dell does not have jumpers for Dell 's hard drives .	St
1.1.7	I need to be directed to an online or on-the-street store to purchase them .	St
1.1.8	It would be better if it were online or by telephone , because I live in rural Kentucky , gas is $ 4.50 a gallon and I lost my job recently .	St
1.1.9	In addition to telling me where to go -- people love to do that -- but exactly what to ask for .	St
1.1.10	Asking Dell for jumpers sent me to a guy that sells ribbon cable .	St
1.1.11	SATA drives , as you all know , do n't have a ribbon cables .	St
1.1.12	Thanks in advance .	St
1.1.13	I know someone here can and will help me .	St
1.1.14	KYB	St
1.2.1	To limit the SATA SPEED from 3 to 1.5Gb .	St
1.2.2	There is no master or slave in sata .	St
1.2.3	IF you find the new drive is showing as master then move the drive you want as master to the lowest numbered SATA connection first .	St
1.3.1	The & quot ; tech & quot ; in the chat gave me the web site : http : //www.wdc.com/en/library/eide/2579-001037.pdf and I thought the info on the second and third pages show how to set up a master/slave arrangement .	St
1.3.2	I do n't doubt your information .	St
1.3.3	You 've been correct about almost all questions I 've asked here .	St
1.3.4	( I ca n't say where you were wrong , but nobody 's perfect.JOKE ! )	St
1.3.5	I do n't know anything about speed as it applies to the drives ; I learned about the jumpers from someone here , I think .	St
1.3.6	Whatever , Dell says I need jumpers and said to come back to the chat , they would help me install them .	St
1.3.7	They told me to be very careful about installing them , and if I do n't have to buy and install them , it 's OK with me .	St
1.3.8	I can , and have switched the HD cables on the MB of this Dell Dimension 8300 .	St
1.3.9	Are you suggesting all I need is to do that is make that switch and then install the OS , Windows XP HE , the necessary drivers and that will make the new , larger drive the master/boot drive and turn the original drive into the slave ?	Ques
1.3.10	Since I do n't need the jumpers , how do I make the new master drive the boot drive ?	Ques
1.3.11	TIA KyB	St
1.4.1	One thing is not like the other .	St
1.5.1	So , to make the new drive the master/boot drive do I install the OS , Windows XP HE , the necessary drivers and that will make the new , larger drive the master/boot drive and turn the original drive into the slave ?	Ques
1.5.2	Is there anything else I need to do to make the new master drive the boot drive ?	Ques
1.6.1	Now I do n't offer support or much for G4U COPYDISK since it 's free and I type just 3 words to perform that copy the rest of us may have to use ACRONIS , software listed at http : //www.duxcw.com/digest/Howto/hd/cpyhd/index.html or & quot ; other. & quot ; Sorry but I do n't use much other than the first 2 I noted .	St
1.6.2	To set one as master I plug the sata cable into the lowest numbered sata connection .	St
1.7.1	One of the reasons I 'm going thru all this is there is a problem with the Windows installation on the old drive , and I 'm trying to set the new one up with a clean install of Windows , etc .	St
1.7.2	and then install the software I need on it .	St
1.7.3	There are some things on the old drive I 'd like to keep , but that 's for another time .	St
1.7.4	I 'm just going to install the SW for which I have the original CDs .	St
1.7.5	KyB	St
1.8.1	http : //support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim8300/sm/techov.htm Connect the new HDD to SATA_0 leave the old HDD disconnected until you get the new OS installed .	St
1.8.2	Let us know how it works .	St
1.8.3	VAPCMD	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
