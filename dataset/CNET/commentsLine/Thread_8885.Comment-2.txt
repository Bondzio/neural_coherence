i had a similar problem to a modem that would not dial, sometime found the tone, sometimes did a half dial.
try reinstalling all the software and hardware(if it can be removed).
if this doesnt work.
the card may be dead.
it could be a part that device manager might not reveal that the actual card is bad.
modems are cheap so it shouldnt be too bad if this is the case.
