i have had been using a maxtor hdd 40gb since feb 2001. never noticed any clicking sound as you have described.
anyway, this hdd had its life two weeks ago (could not boot up).
i've replaced it with a seagate 120gb and up & running happily.if i were you, i'd return all the maxtor hdds that you've got and ask for your money back.
consider using other brands, you can do well without a maxtor.
