About the WiFi Channel .. of course I'll change it if necessary..
I see 2 or more available hotspot, when I use and turn on the WiFi on my friend New Laptop, which I help him, a litle here and there, during installation and setting.
As for me..
I didn't have WiFi capable device or WiFi Access Point ...
I'll get it in the next couple of weeks.
Thank you for your help and understanding...
