I would thought that this would be fairly easy. Unfortunately I am finding out that they spec in for windows XP, Vista, but very few for Windows 7. A few that have advertised for Windows 7 in the buyers' reviews will mention that the ads are incorrect and they do not work with Windows 7. Hoping someone here can provide some recommendations. I'm hoping to find an enclosure that holds the entire drive as opposed to the drive just plugging in the top of the drive enclosure. Thank you. Have a Great Day, Jim

So find your local computer shop, let them show that it works with any of their Windows 7 PC's (they won't have anything else in the shop anyway) and let them assure you that of course you can return it if it doesn't work with you.
