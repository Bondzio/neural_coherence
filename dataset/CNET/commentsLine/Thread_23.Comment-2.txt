the gold wire is incorrect for most configurations.
for ics the gold wire is removed and we use the &quot;use the router as a wap&quot; setup noted at the top post of this forum.
for ics we could use only the gold wire but i can't comment on how to correct the trouble that would cause.
hope this helps.
