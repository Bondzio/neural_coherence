I have a HP computer with AMD 4200 duel core processor and 2 gig of ram.
I am using Photoshop CS2 and that combination seems to work great.
After I bought the computer I added the 2nd gig of ram and a 256mg video card and did see better performance.
I also do video editing through the firewire port and so far nothing seems to slow it down.
The graphics forum on CNET has a lot of good information so you might check there.
