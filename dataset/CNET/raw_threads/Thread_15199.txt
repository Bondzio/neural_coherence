My budget is $4,250 thats with taxes and a 3 year warranty plan, and a 19 or 20 inch monitor. I would like dual processors and a real good graphics card. I also want 4gb of ram. I would like to be able to expand on the ram also.. It will be used alot for 3d modeling and animation, graphic design and some good gaming. So 4,250 budget with tax, on WWW.Alienware.com 19/20 inch monitor 3 year warranty plan Duo Core Processors 4gb of ram (hopes of expandibility) a real nice graphics card 300 gb hard drive atleast 7200rpm(maybe raid?)

Also as of now, 4GB is the max and Alienware does not offer any computers with motherboards that will allow more than this. B) You really need to decide on what you want to do with your computer. It is impossible to build a computer that will be perfect for both gaming and graphical design: 1)If you take the gaming route, then you will want a graphics card designed for gaming (nVidia 7900GTX for example). Also you will want a faster hard drive, a 10,000 RPM raptor drive which Alienware offers. 2)If you take the 3d modeling route you will want a graphics card designed for these applications (nVidia Quadro series or ATI FireGL series). You will also want more space so going with a 7200RPM 300GB drive would probably be the best bet. Now, since you want to combine the two of these options, its good to go for the Duo Core Processor like you have selected. Also, you can get 2 different hard drives. You can select a 7200RPM 300GB harddrive for all your 3d application stuff, and a 1000RPM 80GB drive for all yours games. This is just some things to keep in mind when configuring. I'd recommend the Alienware Area-51 7500 for gaming, or any of the MJ-12 workstations for 3d applications. Hope this helsp a bit.
