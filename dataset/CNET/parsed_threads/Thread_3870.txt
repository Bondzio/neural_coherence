<s> Any thoughts on this one? </s>
<s> The E2000 supports dual band (either 2.4 or 5 Ghz) while the Valet Plus only supports 2.4 Ghz. </s>
<s> But what about the range? </s>
<s> I understand the Valet Plus is easy set up for morons but is the E2000 just as easy with it's CD? </s>
<s> Most bang for the buck...please chime in! </s>
<s> After install some thousand wifi routers not one stands out among the others for range. </s>
<s> It appears that the federal limits on output power means that all are fairly equal. </s>
<s> As to setup, after all this I admit I never use the setup CDs. </s>
<s> It makes me wonder if all their efforts were wasted on me. </s>

<s> Hi. </s>
<s> I have worked with D-Link, Netgear, Huwai, Linksys, Senoa wireless routers and access points. </s>
<s> Just a couple of each, therefore not many. </s>
<s> However, I checked and found the wireless range of the old &quot;Linksys WRT-54G&quot; (the one which came with two antennas),router to be double than others, including Linksys' own newer model WAP-4400N. </s>
<s> The only exception was Senoas outdoor router. </s>
<s> Its range was immense, to say the least. </s>
<s> But its output power was also more than others. </s>
<s> Just a point. </s>
