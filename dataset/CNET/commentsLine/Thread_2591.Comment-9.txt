did you install a dns (server) on that machine?
and also, why is that a gateway machine?
is there some router software on it?
also, i noted to start at 192.168.0.10 while i can't write everything in this small space, the reason is that if you installed some router later, starting at 10 could avoid some headaches.
your choice here.
