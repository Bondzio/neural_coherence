can you actually afford it and will another processor do the same job?
all cpus in the same family have the same cpuflags and will mxecute the same instruction set(s).
internal speed is more important and if smp isn't readily supported, you won't b e getting the performance you want.
also, remember that 64bit systems cannot run certain applications nwithout a compatibility layer.
(this is an added comment to the above post.)
