1.1.1	Does anyone know of a cable/hub that converts Firewire to USB ?	Ques
1.1.2	I bought the new aluminum macbook thinking I was done with IEEE 1394 , but as luck would have it I need to plug in a friends camcorder and its not compatible .	St
1.1.3	The camcorder is a Canon GL2 .	St
1.2.1	There are hardly any converters or cables that exist to do what you are asking for .	St
1.2.2	FireWire and USB are two completely different technologies .	St
1.2.3	I 'd suggest either transferring the video to a FireWire-bearing computer or to a different camera that has USB connectivity .	St
1.2.4	According to the Canon site , this camera can use MiniDV tapes and/or SD cards , right ?	Ques
1.2.5	If you 're using SD cards , there are multiple devices out there with SD and USB connections , like some digital cameras , etc .	St
1.2.6	If you are using tapes , which I am going to guess you are , I 'm sure you could find some sort of MiniDV recorder that has USB .	St
1.2.7	Should be some out there .	St
1.2.8	However , I feel the best solution would be to import the video onto another computer and store the file on a DVD or an external hard drive .	St
1.2.9	Whatever works best for you .	St
1.2.10	Good luck .	Polite

1.4.1	Has anyone else tried editing with their 13 & quot ; Macbook and realized it has no FIREWIRE capability ? ? ?	Ques
1.4.2	Is there no solution to this problem when your camcorder only has Firewire output ?	Ques
1.4.3	Thanks .	Polite
1.5.1	If your MacBook lacks a FireWire port and your camera requires one , you 'll have to find another solution to connect the two .	St
1.5.2	If the camera accepts memory cards or can use an adapter of its own to connect via USB , I 'd try that , but given that it uses FireWire , chances sound slim to me .	St
1.5.3	I 'd guess then that the easiest thing you could do is switch cameras , if possible .	St

1.6.1	Depending on which model you purchased there may be a few options .	St
1.6.2	If you have a 13 ' , 15 ' or 17 ' MacBook Pro you have Firewire 800 .	St
1.6.3	The adapters for a Firewire 800 to Firewire 400 I beelive , are more reliable .	St
1.6.4	The 17 ' model also has an Express slot .	St
1.6.5	You can buy Express cards that provide Firewire 400 ports .	St
1.7.1	The OP knows what Firewire is , He knows what it looks like .	St
1.7.2	He knows he does not have it on his Macbook He knew that when he purchased it .	St
1.7.3	P	St
1.8.1	Sonnet makes a External , 2-port FireWire 400 and 1-port USB 2.0 , ExpressCard/34 that will fit in your ExpressCard slot : http : //www.sonnettech.com/product/macbookaccessories/index.html That ought to get you where you want to go .	St
