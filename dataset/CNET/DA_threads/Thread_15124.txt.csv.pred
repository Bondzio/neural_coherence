1.1.1	I 've been recently having problems with my PC .	St
1.1.2	For the past week , it 's been freezing up in the middle of using it , but upon restarting it would be fine .	St
1.1.3	Until today that is , when I tried restarting it and it says & quot ; Master Drive Fails & quot ; and & quot ; Slave Drive Fails & quot ; .	St
1.1.4	The master is a 40GB Maxtor HD and the slave is a 250 GB Western Digital HD ( I know , should probably switch the master and slave ) .	St
1.1.5	Anyway , I find it hard to believe that both drives would be corrupted , at least at the same time anyway .	St
1.1.6	Is there any way to fix this problem , or at least transfer my data to a new drive .	Ques
1.1.7	I 'd prefer not to take it to the Geek Squad because they charge an arm and a leg so I 'd like to just do it myself if possible .	St
1.1.8	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.2.1	As to data recovery , that 's so expensive that most wo n't get their files back .	St
1.2.2	As to geek squad you usually only surrender money for them to tell you the drive has failed .	St
1.2.3	Go ahead if you must .	Sug
1.2.4	Again .	St
1.2.5	Just one drive at a time to see how that works and a new IDE cable just to be sure .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Checked the capacitors ?	Ques
