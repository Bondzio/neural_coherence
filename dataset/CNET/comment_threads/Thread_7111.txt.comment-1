Right now I have my spare HDD in an enclosure plugged into my laptop, and easiest way to say it is the wheel's spinning but the hamster is dead.
My laptop is picking up the USB connection, but I'm not able to access the drive itself.
I hear a disk spinning but it use to spin up and stop a lot before, now its just steady.
I think this might have been caused by a premature power off.
I was hibernating my laptop for the night, and just hit the power switch on the drive as well.
There shouldn't have been any transmitting activity but I might have missed something.
Checking the other threads it seems like there's little to be done.
I have no access to an actual desktop at the moment, so I can't check if the disk is really dead or its just the enclosure not working.
Honestly I might have to just invest in a server box or something at this rate.
