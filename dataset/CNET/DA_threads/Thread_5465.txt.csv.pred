1.1.1	Hi all , Running WinXP Pro .	St
1.1.2	Computer has been running fine .	St
1.1.3	Then installed SP3 .	St
1.1.4	After that , at every startup I got 2 error messages .	St
1.1.5	The first error message said : AirGCFG.exe - Entry Point Not Found .	St
1.1.6	The procedure entry point apsGetInterfaceCount could not be located in the dynamic link library wlanapi.dll When I clicked 'ok ' on that message , a second error message came up that said : WZCSLDR2.exe - Entry Point Not Found .	St
1.1.7	The procedure entry point apsInitialize could not be located in the dynamic link library wlanapi.dll I have since learned that the 2 error messages could have been removed by simply updating the Dlink wireless driver .	St
1.1.8	Before I discovered that fix , I did the following .	St
1.1.9	I put the PC in Safe Mode , and I checked C : \Windows\SYSTEM32\wlanapi.dll to see if the SP3 install had added a second wlanapi.dll file .	St
1.1.10	I thought that might be causing the problem based on some suggestions I found in a google search .	St
1.1.11	Then I deleted another file that 's almost identical .	St
1.1.12	It was the file : WlanApi.dll .	St
1.1.13	The W and A are capitalized and the file size was larger than the wlanapi.dll file that I did n't touch .	St
1.1.14	Within a second or two after deleting the WlanApi.dll file , the monitor froze .	St
1.1.15	I hit the soft reboot and now when the computer comes on , the monitor stays completely blank , nothing on it , no post , nothing .	St
1.1.16	I turn the pc off and on and there are no beeps , all pc led 's come on , the fans are on , the dvd led 's light up for a moment , but monitor is blank .	St
1.1.17	Any ideas on what I can do to get the pc up and running again would be greatly appreciated .	St
1.2.1	If you can start in Safe Mode try to restore to an earlier date .	St
1.2.2	Pick Last known good configuration .	St
1.3.1	I 'm not aware of any file on a HD that will block the machine from POST .	St
1.3.2	If the machine & quot ; did & quot ; beep after POST and now does not ... .make it smaller .	St
1.3.3	Work with the bios ... .get the machine to beep .	St
1.3.4	You do n't need for a beep .	St
1.3.5	HD 's Floppies Optical Other Unplug that stuff ... ..get the machine to beep .	St
1.4.1	Thanks for your input , I followed the steps in the & quot ; No POST & quot ; guide , and now my pc is working good .	St
