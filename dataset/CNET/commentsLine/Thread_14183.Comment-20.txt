and it was only for items i was picking-up for our branch, so very little per time spent overall...(unless you can count hands of solitare).
but i got my 1 st home pc end 2001. bought it used & it was a compaq w/ 8gb hd, and 64k memory..it had win98, and i upgraded to 98se,but i learned alot from trial and mostly error.
and when i got my new hp in 2003 i turned around and sold it to someone who was also was their 1st home pc.
