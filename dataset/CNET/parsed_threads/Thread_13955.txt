<s> One WinXP Pro wireless computer; one Win2k computer; both currently networked and ethernet cable wired to a Linksys wireless router. </s>
<s> QUESTION: Can I directly connect the Win2K computer by USB cable to printer; and then the wireless printer to the router by ethernet cable; and then set the Win2k computer to share this printer so the WinXP wireless can connect &quot;wireless&quot; ? </s>
<s> You have to decide, which connection you want to use for the printer. </s>
<s> and in your post you said something about connecting your Wireless printer to the router using ethernet cable.. </s>
<s> I don't get it... </s>
<s> One connection to the printer is sufficient for sharing. </s>
<s> SHARE A PRINTER: Connect the printer to one computer (the ''host'' computer) via USB cable and then share that printer in the printer properties on that host computer. </s>
<s> For other computers to use the printer, the computer that is hosting the printer must be &quot;on.&quot; There is no guarantee that other computers will be able to use all printer functions other than printing. </s>
<s> NETWORK A PRINTER: Connect the printer to the router via a WIRED PRINT SERVER or a WIRELESS PRINT SERVER that you purchase. </s>
<s> Any computer that is connected to the network will be able to use the printer. </s>
<s> The drawback is it is likely you will only be able to use the print function when networking the printer. </s>
