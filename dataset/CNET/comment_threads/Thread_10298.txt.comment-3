The computer was working just fine before I changed the power supply.
I changed the power supply back to the Seasonic 550w PSU and it still showed &quot;no signal&quot;.
Could you clarify or simplify your answer?
You said a cable is touching the fan?
I checked and there aren't any cables touching the graphics card fan...
The power supply is also connected to a Seagate 5400 RPM hard drive and a Samsung 7200 RPM hard drive.
For testing purposes, I only connected the PSU to the parts I needed to turn on the computer and turn down the GPU fan because it was too loud, which was when I encountered the &quot;no signal&quot; problem.
