If reflowing parts doesn't work I pull out some freeze spray and see if freezing a part makes it work.
Then I replace that part.
I'll take it that you reflowed solder where ever you felt like it?
Some techs won't do that unless they 'know' it's bad.
I've cured a few just by going ahead with the reflow.
Again if there was a 'reflow here' sign or procedure then repairs would be easy and cheap but reality is something else.
