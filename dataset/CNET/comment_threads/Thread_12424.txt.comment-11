About a month ago, I ordered a DELL Dimension 8400 with the base 3.0 Ghz 630 Intel Pentium 4 Processor.
The &quot;system information&quot; tab says my processor is x86 Family 15 Model 4 Stepping 3 GeniunieIntel~2992 Mhz.
Is this enough info to tell what I got?
A &quot;friend&quot; (who thinks DELLS are over-rated and may just be trying to make me feel like I got ripped off) tells me my processor was obsolete the day it was shipped and it is not 64 bit and 2MB of L2 cache like it should be.
The thing sure runs plenty fast but I am not a super heavy duty user.
Thanks.
