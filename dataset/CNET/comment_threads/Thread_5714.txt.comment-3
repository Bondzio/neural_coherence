Bob, that fixed most of the problem.
I still can't connect to the internet.
I tried rebooting the modem/router and pc several times and that didn't work.
I then tryed running the easylink connect from the linksys web site and it said the network device was disabled.
I went into device manager and it is enabled.
What do you think?
