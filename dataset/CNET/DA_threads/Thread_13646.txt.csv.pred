1.1.1	I need to do some crowd sourcing .	St
1.1.2	I currently have a DIR 655 that is dying .	St
1.1.3	The problem seems to be the power cord .	St
1.1.4	I thought about trying to replace only the cord but , we all know that once something like a router starts getting hit with electrical issues its only a matter of time before it dies altogether .	St
1.1.5	So my question then becomes , which router to replace it with .	St
1.1.6	Ordinarily , I 'd stick with what 's worked for me .	St
1.1.7	Unfortunately , I do n't have that kind of money right now .	St
1.1.8	There is also a timing factor that keeps me from going online for a really good deal .	St
1.1.9	I literally have about $ 50 to spend and I 'm in a small town with a Wal-Mart and a radio shack to serve my tech needs .	St
1.1.10	So I 'm pretty much stuck picking from three routers .	St
1.1.11	Netgear WGR614 Wireless-G 54Mbps Broadband Router Netgear WGR614 Wireless-G 54Mbps Broadband Router Cisco Linksys Wireless N Router , WRT120N Belkin Surf N300 Wireless Router Now , , I have to say the belkin is one I 'm not really interested in because , I 've never ever had a good experience with them .	St
1.1.12	However , I 'm willing to be fair .	St
1.1.13	The only thing that bothers me about the cisco is , it claims to be wireless N 2.0 but they are n't willing to say what the top speed of the wireless radio is anywhere on the box .	St
1.1.14	As for the net gear , I 've had a hit or miss relationship with them .	St
1.1.15	Had a great hub once , but also had a horrible router once .	St
1.1.16	The last thing I 'll say is , obviously , I want to get the best overall router for the money and while the wireless is certainly important in that regard , right now everything is wired , so I just need something to get me by until I can get a better router .	St
1.1.17	In other words , something that does n't need power cycled every other day .	St
1.1.18	So what do you think ?	Ques
1.2.1	You are pretty much limited if you are going to buy from a retail store in a small town and not buy online .	St
1.2.2	I would not buy a G router any more .	St
1.2.3	Eventually all your other equipment will get upgraded to N and then you have to upgrade your router again .	St
1.2.4	I suspect N will be the best you can get for many years to come .	St
1.2.5	As far as speed goes in the short run they will exactly what you have today since you will need to run in G mode unless all your PC 's have N already .	St
1.2.6	In the future when you upgrade your N speed will be based on which features both the router and the nic cards support .	St
1.2.7	Most say they will do 150m and some say 300m .	St
1.2.8	Your limiting factor is the internet so it does not really matter a lot .	St
1.2.9	These numbers are all best case numbers anyway .	St
1.2.10	Buy the router for the other features , firewall , url filter etc etc .	St
1.2.11	The radio part are pretty much the same .	St
1.2.12	I would stay wired once it works it works ... until the hardware fails .	St
1.3.1	Let 's ditch/scratch that one without further ado .	St
1.3.2	The DLR 655 at http : //www.dlink.com/products/ ? pid=530 seems to gain favor in reviews and owners .	St
1.3.3	If you need that .	St
1.3.4	My older wnr2000 and similar 3700 run for months without power cycling .	St
1.3.5	That 614 is well known for it 's lockups when folk try to run TORRENTS .	St
1.3.6	But go figure .	Sug
1.3.7	Bob	St
1.4.1	Well , you can pick either or .	St
1.4.2	Maybe the prices are a little bit different but it 's really up to you .	St
1.4.3	I have the Cisco Linksys wireless router for a long time now and so far it did n't give me no problem .	St
1.4.4	I really like Cisco Linksys wireless routers .	St
