The Xp laptop does not recogize the drive. It does not show up in &quot;My Computer&quot;. It shows up in the Computer management/disk management window as a disk with no Volume (e.g. C:, D:, etc), a blank file system, and 100% free space (although I know there is at least 15G info on the drive). When I right click on the drive, the only option I'm given is to ''delete the partition''. Since this will delete the data on the machine, it is not an option. It appears that the XP machine can see the drive but cannot read or recognize the files. Any suggestions? Thanks

I've run into this too many times to count and know to use the USB 2.0 ports, cables and such. Try this. Boot KNOPPIX and see if it sees the drive contents. Bob

It means that it may not work and no maker of OS or hardware will tell you it works (if they have been at this game long.) About KNOPPIX. Please try google.com. I'd rather not duplicate web content when and where I can. Bob
