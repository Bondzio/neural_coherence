I was lucky a few years ago to have 2 identical machines right down to the same make/model of everything.
We had a DVD rendering job that took 6 HOURS.
The test runs were made and then the machine's ram sticks were switched and the test rerun.
Both machines ran XP.
The machine with 1GB finished the 6 hour task ahead of the 512MB machine by 5 or 6 minutes.
