thoroughbred and barton are 32 bit.
socket 754 and 939 are 64 bit.
newegg gives that info.
the key to installing where an older proceesor had been is to thoroughly clean the old thermal paste or, phase change material off of the surface of the hsf that will interface the new cpu.
then apply a thin film of thermal compiund.
you may need a better hsf.
one good way is to buy the retail boxed cpu, they come with a suitable hsf and thermal compound, also a 3 year warranty.
the hsf with the retail box will adequately cool the cpu that it came with if the interior ambient temperature is held to a maximum of 38 degrees c [100 f].
may need amnother case fan to keep the interior cool enough.
