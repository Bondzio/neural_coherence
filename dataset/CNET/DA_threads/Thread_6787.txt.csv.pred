1.1.1	im running xp with at & t dsl using a motorola modem .	St
1.1.2	i got a linksys BEFSR41 ver.4.3 router .	St
1.1.3	the last step in the setup it says can not detect router , yet the connection status is good and the speed is at 100.0mbps .	St
1.1.4	all the lights on the router and modem show a good connection .	St
1.1.5	i know how to access the modems config .	St
1.1.6	do i need to change the modem to Bridged Mode ?	Ques
1.1.7	if so what then ?	Ques
1.1.8	when i did that the power , ethernet , and dsl lights were the only ones on .	St
1.1.9	but that was about all i could do .	St
1.2.1	Sometimes these & quot ; wizards & quot ; fail to work and you need to do things manually .	St
1.2.2	What you need to do is look at the router 's documentation and find its default IP address .	St
1.2.3	From there , you set a static IP address in your PC that 's within range of the router .	St
1.2.4	Example ... if router 's IP is 192.168.1.1 , make your PC 192.168.1.2 .	St
1.2.5	Then , open your browser and access the router using http : \\ ( router IP address ) .	St
1.2.6	This should bring you to it 's web interface where you will have to enter a username/password .	St
1.2.7	There should be a default noted in your documentation .	St
1.2.8	Once you successfully enter these , you can make the changes you need .	St
1.2.9	Change the password as well .	St
1.2.10	Hope that helps .	St
