1.1.1	Hi there, I am trying to connect to the internet via the above router, following the steps in the manual and have reached a screen which wants me to enter primary and secondary DNS servers, but also gives me an option to get them automatically.	St
1.1.2	I tried to do so but it keeps returning to the same screen.	St
1.1.3	I called my ISP who advised me that giving me the numbers would do no good, but that I needed to change the settings of the router to automatically scan for them.	St
1.1.4	Is this right, and how do I do so?	St
1.1.5	I am at a loss for ideas now so any help would be appreciated.	St
1.1.6	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	But not enough detail about cable modem, DSL or fiber.	St
1.2.2	Yes, try the automatic DNS, DHCP all around like you do for cable but did ANYONE tell you to power off the cable modem for at least a ten count or during the time you move the ethernet cable from the PC to the new router?	St
1.2.3	If not, there's a missing step.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
