Ques
1.1.7	thanks i appreciate this ...	Polite
1.2.1	Depending if you have the software already , $ 3000 is a pretty liberal price .	St
1.2.2	I will list some items here .	St
1.2.3	I would go to newegg.com ( Yes I do buy all of my computer parts there .	St
1.2.4	First you need a decent case - http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16811119047 And a good power supply ... do not skimp on this .	Ques
1.2.5	Quality power is VERY important .	St
1.2.6	Good Brand Name is Antec http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16817103931 Motherboard http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16813136158 High Performance RAM http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16820145575 High Performance Hard drive ( X2 ) in RAID0 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16822136014 Good Video Card http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16814127097 DVD Writer http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16827151118 And Finally , the Processor http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16819103546 You can get the FX series for more $ $ .	Ques
1.2.7	Also the Operating Systemfor about $ 150 .	St
1.2.8	And if you need a monitor , you can get good 17 '' LCD for under $ 300 .	St
1.2.9	That brings the total to around $ 2700 for a sweet machine Hope this helps .	St
1.2.10	You will have to look around in the phone book or word of mouth for a good tech .	St
1.3.1	If you are going to run several applications at one time then go for INTEL processor with HT .	St
1.3.2	if you are going to run one application at one time , then AMD 64 is the best performer .	St
1.3.3	since your budget is too high , I think you can buy 2 PC in the same amount with same configuration .	St
1.3.4	I think this one as the best , just check out this model : Hewlett-Packard Pavilion Media Center Desktop with AMD Athlon 64 X2 Processor 4200+ Model : m7470n you have to add video memory and 2GB ram	St
1.4.1	Here 's a newegg shopping cart with my suggested components : http : //secure.newegg.com/NewVersion/Shopping/shoppingcart.asp ? submit=view I did n't know if you wanted a sound card , so there is n't one in that list .	St
1.4.2	I also did n't know what kind of optical drives you wanted , so I did n't include any .	St
1.4.3	Finally , I 'm assuming that you need Windows , but I did n't include it in that list .	St
1.4.4	There are two gigabytes of RAM because 4 gigs is the limit for a 32-bit OS .	St
1.4.5	You will get lots of crashes and error messages .	St
1.4.6	Windows Vista will be a 64-bit OS , so if you choose to upgrade to Vista , you can upgrade the RAM at the same time .	St
1.4.7	You could probably get a local computer store to build it for you .	St
1.4.8	Not Best Buy or CompUSA , but a smaller store .	St
1.4.9	Or just give a nerd some money , a warm meal , and a place to sleep , and let them build it for you .	St
1.4.10	The two hard drives should be put in Raid 1 .	St
1.4.11	With a Raid 1 setup , when you save a file , it gets saved on both drives .	St
1.4.12	If one drive fails , you still all your data on the other one .	St
1.4.13	For $ 3,000 you ca n't get the fastest parts that money can buy ( there are some processors that cost $ 1,000 alone ) , but you do n't need the top-of the line CPU .	St
1.5.1	Except that I used the X2 3800+ and a 7900GT .	St
1.5.2	I also had two 300GB drives in RAID1 ; he 's an artist , so data security is probably pretty important .	St
1.5.3	I also used a DFI board , but a cheaper , non-SLI one .	St
1.5.4	I actually own the board , along with an A64 3700+ , so I have first-hand experience .	St
1.6.1	thanks guys !	Polite
1.6.2	i appreciate all the help .	Polite
1.6.3	i saved the stuff you guys sent .	St
1.6.4	so if i buy all these parts listed and hand a tech windows xp and the parts he can put it together fine ?	Ques
1.6.5	no compatibility issues ?	Ques
1.6.6	also is 2gb of ram enough ?	Ques
1.6.7	i have a hp zd8000 laptop 3.4ghz p4 2gb ram x600 ati .	St
1.6.8	and it runs well but it still slows up alot in photo shop when the file gets big or when i am multi tasking with more then one art program .	St
1.6.9	i have this powerful laptop to take to school .	St
1.6.10	but i want a seriously nice desktop to work on at home .	St
1.6.11	so id like to get the best performance with the least amount of known problems for my dollar .	St
1.6.12	how much more powerful will this desktop be ?	Ques
1.6.13	thanks guys i appreciate all your help .	Polite
1.6.14	i dont know much on the hardware side of things .	St
1.6.15	this is a great help !	St
1.6.16	-rich student : gamedesign/graphic design/ animation	St
1.7.1	DO NOT GET A NEIGHBORHOOD GEEK TO BUILD YOUR SYSTEM ! ! !	St
1.7.2	I used to be one of those , and if you need support , they may not be available ! I know from my past experience of being one plus you get a service contract with your build with most reputible companies ( not bestbuy or compusa places..no big chains ) Also , check out the stats between AMD and Intel processors ... on the X2 side , AMD whoops Intel any day , anytime , anywhere !	St
1.7.3	( sorry to all you Intel buffs , but it is truth ! )	St
1.8.1	Hey man..whats in your box ( to Nathan ) ? ?	Ques
1.8.2	Wan na get in touch ?	Ques
1.9.1	My personal PC specs are : DFI nf4 DAGF A64 3700+ San Diego 1GB DDR400 250GB SATA X600 ( overclocked ) SoundBlaster Audigy2 Thermaltake TR2 430W PSU Cooler Master Cavalier case and a floppy drive The specs for the computer that I recommended him are in my other post ; it 's a newegg shopping cart .	St
1.10.1	Please help me compile a list of suitable components i require to build a perfect desktop workstation and graphics workstation .	Sug
1.10.2	1 .	St
1.10.3	Desktop W/station must support MicrosoftWindows XP professional & OfficeXP , and used for emailing , internet access , word processing and spread sheetwork .	St
1.10.4	2 .	St
1.10.5	Graphics W/station is for CAD work ( 3D ) complete with Microsoft Windows XP proffessional and OfficeXP 3 .	St
1.10.6	Also what would be the suitable printer and scanner for this set up ?	Ques
1.10.7	URGENT !	St
1.10.8	!	St
1.11.1	1st for your desktop you can skimp a little .	St
1.11.2	If this is just going to be a regular desktop , not critical , I would get this : ( ca n't find link right now ) , but the machine is aroubd $ 350 As far as the other one , you need a workhorse that you can put in RAID .	St
1.11.3	I suggest this : http : //secure.newegg.com/NewVersion/wishlist/PublicWishDetail.asp ? WishListNumber=1777001	Ques
1.12.1	The earlier suggestions are all fine and dandy , but ( if you 're a serious graphic designer/artist ) I would put a bigger chunk towards the display .	St
1.12.2	19 & quot ; at a minimum , but I would seriously consider a widescreen model or a dual monitor setup .	St
1.12.3	Photoshop , etc gets too cluttered with a small screen ( constantly shifting around the palettes so you can see your work is annoying and counter-productive ) and you 're going to want something better-than-average when it comes to color rendition , contrast , evenness ( no drop-offs of light in the corners , fading from top-to-bottom ) , etc ... Just my $ .02 on your $ 3000 .	St
1.13.1	For the desktop workstation running OfficeXP , any PC will do .	St
1.13.2	For the CAD station , here 's my suggestion for a upper-mid range setup .	St
1.13.3	You 'll need to budget about $ 4300 but it includes dual-core processor , 4GB RAM , CAD accelerated graphics card , 500GB disk space , 23 & quot ; widescreen monitor , a tabloid/B size printer , and XP Pro and Office 2003 .	St
1.13.4	Asus A8R32-MVP motherboard : $ 200 AMD Opteron 175 Dual-Core 2.2ghz CPU : $ 510 WD Caviar WD2500KS 250GB SATA-2 hard drive : $ 95 WD Caviar WD2500KS 250GB SATA-2 hard drive : $ 95 Coolermaster Cavalier 3 mid tower aluminum case : $ 80 Enermax EG565P 500W power supply : $ 90 ATI FireGL V7100 256MB video card : $ 750 ( Sony/LG/NEC/LiteOn ) DVD/+-RW drive : $ 75 2GB OCZ400 Platinum DDR-400 kit : $ 190 2GB OCZ400 Platinum DDR-400 kit : $ 190 Viewsonic VP2330WB 23 & quot ; wide screen LCD monitor , 1900x1200 : $ 1025 HP Inkjet 2800 tabloid ( 11x17 ) /superB ( 13x19 ) printer : $ 500 Windows XP Pro : $ 140 MS Office Small Business : $ 230	St
