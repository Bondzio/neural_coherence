I've always had Epson printers.
Generally, I like them, but....
They have a problem, which is actually mentioned in their manual.
You have to use them regularly, or the heads clog up!
I want good quality B&W & colour printing.
Acceptable photo printing.... pretty much all the things any home user wants, but what I DON'T want is to attempt to print something & find the heads are clogged because I didn't use the printer for a month or so.
I've never seen this issue mentioned in printer reviews & was wondering if anyone has ever tested various brands for it?
I would love any suggestions as to what printer i could buy that would not require me to use up trees pointlessly, just to keep it running.
