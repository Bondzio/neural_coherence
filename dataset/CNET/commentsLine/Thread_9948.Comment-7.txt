the root of the problem today stops at the dvd drive due to the costs involved of troubleshooting it deeper than that.
if you wish to go beyond that and look at this deeper you would be researching how the ide bus works, the bios source code on initializing said bus, the use of oscilloscopes and more diagnostic equipment.
most of us will just replace the unit since the time spent on troubleshooting a dead drive is not worth it.
