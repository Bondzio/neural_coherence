<s> when i am on the net on some sites i only get the view in the middle third of the screen. </s>
<s> on other sites i get a full screen. </s>
<s> when i am offline line playing free cell i get a top down stretch of the game. </s>
<s> can any one help? </s>
<s> If the site is designed for say an 800 x 600 resolution and you have say a 1440 x 900 resolution(Widescreen) then you may have some margin space on some sites that hard code how wide the page is, like CNet here but also others. </s>
<s> Some windows can be resized and very few sites I'd imagine allow you to tell the computer what size your window is to allow all of it to be used. </s>
<s> So in short, unless you like low resolutions and enjoy those pains, there isn't a solution for you. </s>
<s> Regards, JB </s>
<s> i thought there was no solution but i asked anyway </s>
