i would consider getting it built Dell can do PC's for under $400 per unit also i would defintaly consider systems with some of the following CPU's: Pentium IV (the slow ones, don't go over 2.4GHZ (exception is the LGA 775 2.8, as it's only $154-ish) Celeron Celeron D (better than Celeron) the chip i would actually use if i was you the AMD Duron as it's the previous generation value chip you can get a Duron for $50/CPU @ most retailers and add in a mid-price nForce2 motherboard with onboard GF4MX gfx, 256-512MB of DDR, and a 40GB HDD and your set man just throw in a decent case/PSU combo you could probalby do it for $250/system but consider 20 machines will take you some time to build
