a little while ago, i was advised that i could use ntfs-3g coupled with macfuse in order to backup a macbook to an ntfs formatted external hard drive.
looks like this may be necessary, b/c my wife's macbook is having serious issues (has become ridiculously slow - don't know why).
if i do this, and then get the machine repaired in a way that wipes her internal hard drive clean, should we be able to restore her machine from the ntfs-formatted external drive?
i assume that i'll have to re-install ntfs-3g and macfuse before doing so, but after that, should i be able to restore the macbook?
