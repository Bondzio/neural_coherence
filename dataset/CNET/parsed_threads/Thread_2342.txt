<s> I just purchased a laptop for home use only with an integrated wireless card (g standard). </s>
<s> What I want is real simple but achieving it is very confusing...I have a broadband internet connection via a cable modem. </s>
<s> I want a hard-wired connection to the Internet in my office (in the basement) but also want the freedom to surf the Internet when I'm upstairs or on my deck outside. </s>
<s> What components do I need? </s>
<s> Based on my research it appears all I need is a router, correct? </s>
<s> Any recommended routers with good range and a strong signal...and easy to setup for newbies like myself? </s>
<s> I have on order a 75 buck Wifi-G combo pack from Dlink. </s>
<s> I'll have a spare part, but the Wifi-G router is what you want. </s>
<s> Outside of oddball names. </s>
<s> Linksys, Netgear and Dlink seem all the same to me now as to ease of setup. </s>
<s> And range is limited by FCC regulations... Bob </s>
<s> Contrary to popular belief, and the advice you hear from others here, DON'T GO WIRELESS!! </s>
<s> Do you want others using your internet connection to surf porn sites? </s>
<s> Maybe even illegal ones, and show your IP as where it is coming from? </s>
<s> Then stay away from wireless. </s>
<s> Do you hear of companies switching from wired to wireless networks? </s>
<s> There'a a reason they don't. </s>
<s> At this point, there is no SECURE wireless connections. </s>
<s> Even encryption won't be enough to keep out a hacker. </s>
<s> Get a router, some CAT5 cabling, and install RJ45 connections where you want to connect at. </s>
<s> Wireless is not secure. </s>
<s> Period. </s>
<s> I don't care who you buy the wireless router from, how many &quot;security&quot; features it has, or anything else. </s>
<s> Don't go WiFi and convince yourself you have a safe connection. </s>
<s> BTW, I am a certified tech (A+, N+, Windows 2000 Professional, and Windows 2000 Advanced Server) with a college degree in Computer Science. </s>
