You have to work just a little to make a good post. With that out of the way did you read our Forum Sticky?

They provided me with a wireless modem (UTStarcom). The problem is that my latop is not recongnizing the modem via wireless. After sometime I disabled the windows firewall, this I could connect via wireless. When I tried to reconnect for the second time it didnt worked.The network authentication is done in WPA-PSK. I am a little confused about configuring wireless in my laptop and setting the network authentication and SSID. I tried out some of the solutions in the links but nothing helps for for my problem. Hope anyone could help me..

Also be sure that your Compaq has the switch for Wifi on/off to the on position. Thanks for the try at details but no model number so I can't look at the machine and see if it's one with known issues. Test your machine at a free wifi spot and if it works there consider the wifi router you are trying to connect to defective. Bob
