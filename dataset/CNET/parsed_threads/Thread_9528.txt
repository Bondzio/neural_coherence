<s> Excuse my ignorance, what would be the best disc to use to record still photo's onto? </s>
<s> CD-R, DVD-R etc.? </s>
<s> I'll use it to store photos onto and to take to the photo lab to get hard copies made. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>

<s> Really it's your choice, although the Photo Lab may have a say in it. </s>
<s> You should check with them first whether they have a computer with a DVD compatible drive, or just a CD ROM. </s>
<s> DVD R disks have much more capacity than CD R disks so that could be a factor for you if you have a large number of photos. </s>
<s> But even CDR's would hold thousands of photos in jpeg format. </s>
<s> Bitmap format images are larger so you would get less for your dollar, so to speak. </s>
<s> Disks are cheap enough, so why not try a set of both. </s>
<s> Of course, you do need a DVD recording capable drive to burn to DVD's but most DVD drives nowadays also play and burn to CD. </s>
<s> Good luck Mark </s>
<s> Go with DVD+R and not DVD-R. Go with CD+R and not CD-R. </s>
<s> They use updated criteria and are generally considered better quality formats. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> Unless I'm mistaken, ''CD+R'' doesn't exist. </s>
<s> There's CD-ROM, CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD-ROM, and DVD-RAM, along with double-layer versions of DVD-R and DVD+R, and mini CDs. </s>
<s> Coming soon is HD-DVD and and Blue-ray. </s>
<s> However, ''CD+R'' is one format I've yet to encounter ouside Area-51. </s>
<s> --------------------------------------------------------- For personal backup, if you have a DVD burner, DVD is the best option, as it can store up to 4.7GB of data on a single-sided disk. </s>
<s> (A double-layer disk can hold twice as much.) </s>
<s> On the other hand, a CD, while maxing out at 750MB, is more universably accepted. </s>
<s> Unless your photo developer has a DVD drive, you'd better stick to a CD. </s>
<s> Aside from that, there's the question between writable (R) and rewritable (RW). </s>
<s> The first can only be recorded to once, though you can usually add more later (depending on your burning software's settings) if it hasn't been filled. </s>
<s> This means you won't be able to change file names or use the disk for any other purpose. </s>
<s> (Best if you want to keep the pics on disk and already have the ''layout'' decided.) </s>
<s> If you want to be able to wipe the disk clean after the photos have been printed, or want to be able to make changes to the contents of the disk, one that's rewritable would be your best option. </s>
<s> Finally, make sure your burner supports the format of disk you have. </s>
<s> For instance, a DVD+R/RW drive can only burn CD-R, CD-RW, DVD+R, and DVD+RW (not DVD-R or DVD-RW). </s>
<s> On the flip side, a DVD-R/RW drive can only burn CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, and DVD-RW (not DVD+R or DVD+RW). </s>
<s> Only a multi-format burner can handle both DVD+R/RW and DVD-R/RW formats, and only a burner that supports double-layer technology can burn a DVD+R DL or DVD-R DL disk. </s>
<s> Unfortunately the industry just can't make it simple. </s>
<s> (Even the Betamax vs VHS debate is being relived now in the form of Blue-ray vs HD-DVD...the two new DVD formats sporting high-definition capabilities.) </s>
<s> In short, I recommend simply printing your digital photos from your memory card, as it tends to be the simplest method. </s>
<s> However, if you want/need to use a disk, your best bet would be to call ahead and find out what types they support. </s>
<s> If they don't know, you can't go wrong with CD-R. And always, always remember to keep a backup on disk, preferably a DVD. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, John </s>
<s> I have a cd/dvd combo burner in my Thinpad notebook computer. </s>
<s> I was going to use it to backup the work I do for clients on a daily basis. </s>
<s> Mostly large Excel files. </s>
<s> Is dvd-ram now the best choice? </s>
<s> Or should I stick to dvd+rw? </s>
<s> Lawrence </s>
<s> I bypass optical discs completely. </s>
<s> For the most part, I save my money and upload the photos to Wal-Mart's photo lab (use the lab of your choice). </s>
<s> I can pick up my prints as early as an hour later. </s>
<s> Works for me. </s>
<s> Although DVD-RAM is considered more ideal for archiving purposes due to it's longer life span (though that's somewhat negated since you'll be making fresh backups daily), the disks themselves are more expensive, take longer to be burned, and only work in a select number of DVD burners. </s>
<s> (I have a ten-month-old 16X multi-format double-layer DVD burner and it's not even capable of handling DVD-RAM.) </s>
<s> You can get a pretty god explanation of the format by clicking here , but I'd recommend sticking with DVD+RW, at least until HD-DVD or Blue-ray become widely available. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, John </s>
<s> I do use CD-R and DVD+R for backups and storage. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> It's just that CD+R has been such a well-kept secret I was shocked you would divulge such information in these forums, and even more so to find out you work for the agency. </s>
<s> But, since you let the cat out of the bag, I might as well let everyone know that Bill Gates, as part of a joint venture with the CIA, is planning on launching the new media, CD+R as a competing format to HD-DVD and Blue-ray. </s>
<s> Get ready people, for the Format of the Year awards are only a few months away. </s>
<s> And remember, the polls close at 21:00 Zulu. </s>
<s> Sorry, but I just had to have a little fun with that one. </s>
