And as long as Im wiping clean the HD might as well get the most out of it via partions. Ive read an article here on a methode of backing up just the vital files like the service packs and all the other updates by installing them onto a separate partition from all the other stuff. The question is, what do I need to 1. reformat the HD and 2. partion it. I have the original Win. Xp Pro. cd and the intallation cd that came with the HD-Maxtor SATA 100GB Ultra Series. Thanks in advanced.

When you start the install, one of the options will be to reformat and also to set the size of the boot partition [also select NTFS or FAT32]. Then you can finish the install. When XP is all set up, go into disk management and do the partitioning of the rest of the drive. Remember that the partition that you want is called a logical drive. You create a partiton and then divide that into logical drives or make the entire partition the logical drive. Typical MS terminology confusion.
