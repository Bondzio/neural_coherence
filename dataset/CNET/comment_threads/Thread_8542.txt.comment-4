Look carefully over the cartrigde for copper or silver contacts and here's what I do.
A little alcohol on a q-tip and swab the cartridge and where it contacts in the printer.
Be sure to read any notes about seals you remove prior to install.
I don't have your printer so I won't know if yours has such.
