I am running a 32 bit Vista Home Premium OS. The card is a PNY Manufactured card. Anyways, when playing games such as Call of Duty 4, the card overheats after a few hours. I can tell when colored artifacts appear on the screen and the PC crashes. I installed the nvidia nTune utility in hopes of increasing the fan speed to prevent the overheating. The nTune utility cannot do this. I installed 3 different versions of RivaTuner and there is no Fan tab when I go to change the settings. I read someone that disabling driver signing can fix this but that is only for 64 bit Vista and I am running 32 bit Vista. I also installed ATITool and it cannot change the fan setting since it thinks the card isnt in use by the OS. I am at a loss. I have already bought a new 450W $100 power supply because PNY said it was a power issue. I am experienced with PCs and have a good knowledge about all this but I cant seem to get ANY tool to change the fan setting. Im not the only one with this issue but really need a viable solution. I do know for a fact that the card itself supports fan speed adjustments. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

I have started thinking about getting a new card. The only reason I didnt already was because I have a 3 year warranty with PNY. Out of those two you showed, I would perfer the one with the heatsink and fan (8800GS) just to prevent future overheating. I havent heard nice things about the &quot;Silent&quot; cards. Any other suggestions

Im running: 2 Intel Pentium 4 3Ghz 2 1GB Sticks DDR RAM 1 SATA HDD 1 COMBO DVDRW/CDRW ODD 1 CDRW ODD 1 CPU FAN 1 SYSTEM FAN 4 USB Devices powered from PC. Ive used a few PSU Wattage calcs but alot dont have the 8800GS as an option for the GPU. Is 450W sufficient?
