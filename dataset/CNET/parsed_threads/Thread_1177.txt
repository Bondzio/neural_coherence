<s> Hi all Just about to purchase my first laptop and it will come with 802.11agn. </s>
<s> I have a desktop PC also, but plan on connecting this directly to the router and so it is just the laptop that will be wireless at the moment. </s>
<s> House is single storey (2000 square feet), but construction is concrete walls. </s>
<s> What router would you recommend and why? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> That's a killer on this one. </s>
<s> There is no known router that will penetrate such. </s>
<s> You'll have to design a solution with some central router and wire WAPs back to it to create your wifi &quot;zones.&quot; I decline to provide a free course in network design but it's a well known problem with a simple solution. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks Bob So how come in my father-in-laws house which is a 2 storey concrete structure he has wifi working? </s>
<s> + my cordless phones work fine </s>
<s> Design done. </s>
<s> -&gt; Let me be very blunt here. </s>
<s> No maker will give you assurance it will work through concrete walls. </s>
<s> Just call them. </s>
<s> I can tell you how I solved it but you want a solid solution and not something iffy. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> OK So I am right in thinking this is what you are saying. </s>
<s> Connect the router to the cable modem Connect PC to router then for the rooms where I would like Wifi - run wired waps back to the router How expensive are wap's If I go this route then should I get a 802.11n router or 802.11g? </s>
<s> Thanks as always </s>
<s> For most of us the N speed only helps when we copy a file from PC to PC. </s>
<s> For internet use, no payoff. </s>
<s> As to WAPs, I don't use a WAP anymore since most wifi routers can be configured as a WAP. </s>
<s> And any router that can be programmed with OpenWRT (they have a list of them) can be turned into a WAP. </s>
<s> So the cost is the same as a router. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> Why not duplicate what you know works? </s>
<s> because thinking about it there house deisgn is different. </s>
<s> I suppose I could get a router and give it ago. </s>
<s> Then if it's a bust, then look into adding wired wap. </s>
<s> Excuse the basic ? </s>
<s> 's If I have very good cordless phone reception from reciever base to other rooms (where I would need wifi access) - would this not suggest that the wifi router might work? </s>
<s> If I had to go wired. </s>
<s> I would need to buy a couple of extra routers + cable and then configure these as access points - is this simple to do? </s>
<s> cheers </s>
<s> Those cordless phones are not the same thing with differences I decline to list since I would have to write quite a few paragraphs. </s>
<s> I'm an electronics designer with designs in two way paging systems so to express why would result in many paragraphs. </s>
<s> The try it and find out is the usual route. </s>
<s> Simple? </s>
<s> For me yes. </s>
<s> For others? </s>
<s> Maybe. </s>
<s> If you used routers that could be configured as a WAP or WAPs or that you could install OpenWRT that supports turning such into a WAP but then I would be repeating what I wrote above... Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for your help </s>
<s> Get a wrt54g from linksys, install DD-WRT and then get a higher DBI antenna for it. </s>
<s> Or make a cantenna if you like the &quot;adventure&quot;. </s>
<s> That should do you good. </s>
