I'm planning to add a DVD-ROM to my new computer (it currently has a DVD/CD RW drive with Light Scribe).
I've found numerous models (much cheaper than I ever could have imagined $17 to $25) but have no idea what I'm looking for or what names mean quality.
Some of the brands I've found are: BenQ, Toshiba, Lite-On, LG, Samsung, Sony, Asus.
Can anyone recommend one of those brands over another?
Do the DVD-ROM Access Times, CD-ROM Access Times, and Cache Times mean a lot?
For DVD-ROM Access Times the one I like has 80-220ms but others have as low as a constant 90ms.
For CD-ROM Access Times the one I like as 165ms but others have as low as 95ms For Cache the one I like has 512K but other have as much as 2M.
Thanks for your help.
