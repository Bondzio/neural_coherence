<s> My system is DELL Dimension 4500s. </s>
<s> I put in 256 DDR PC2100 yesterday. </s>
<s> After I put it in, I plugged in the power strip, the computer turned on automatically without me pressing the switch on button. </s>
<s> (this never happen before) About 2 second, the power cuts off briefly and goes back on again but my monitor can't get any signal from the CPU. </s>
<s> The fan inside the CPU seems to be working okay. </s>
<s> The CD-ROM Drive can open and close and I hear my hard drive spinning. </s>
<s> The problem is consistent even after I tried removing the new memory from the slot. </s>
<s> Anyone have any clue what's going on? </s>
<s> good chance that you knocked it loose when plugging the memory in. </s>
<s> The other glitch happened because you unplugged the power switch which removed the 5 volt standby power that is ALWAYS on the mobo, if plugged in. </s>
<s> When the standby voltage came back you got a logic glitch through the Power Managment function. </s>
<s> I notice there is a LED in the middle of the Motherboard. </s>
<s> Is that light supposed to be on all the time? </s>
<s> Even when the power is off? </s>
<s> Cause I noticed it was off after I switch off the computer. </s>
<s> Is that LED an indicator for the CMOS battery? </s>
<s> How do I fix the logic glitch that you mentioned? </s>
