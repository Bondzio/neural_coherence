I have a Dell M991 monitor and use Nvidia Geoforce FX5200 display adaptors.
It is a Dell 8300 and I run xp Pro.
When I turned on the maching yesterday, all the colors looked muted - where red should be in icons only black, no red in any of the cards, photos well I just simply closed photo preview.
I got on line with Dell support and we changed the color quality to 32 bit, and the screen resolution is at 800x600 since I require larger icons and text than normal.
I uninstalled the driver and reinstalled the new one although no new driver was found.
I did a restore system to a previous date but no change in color so I returned to original date.
Please help me as I would to look at my grandchildrens photos and right now the color is so faded that I prefer to wait until this problem is a last nights dream.
Thanks, MamaJen
