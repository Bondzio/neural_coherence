In your first post you wrote: &quot;.
I did find an ATX to AT converter but it looked like the ATX side was male and I need it to be female.
&quot; Upon double-checking I find the ATX side of such a cable would indeed have male electrical contacts.
But now you write: &quot;Anything more?
Like where I might find what I need?
What the exact name is of what I need?&quot; This confuses me.
Your first post stated you already found it?
What changed?
