<s> in this case , 32 bits plus 32 bits is nog 64 bits, that is complete bull. </s>
<s> the only 64 bit processors are processors wich can adress to 64 bits of memory, and intel core duo can only adress 36 bits. </s>
<s> if the x86-64 instruction set is not included , it is not an (x86) 64 bit processor, no matter how much cores your system has vista will be in both 32 and 64 bit flavours, but I expect 64-bit will be a tad faster. </s>
<s> The bus size has been 64 bits for years, however, yes without specific processing capability it does not process 64 bit code. </s>
