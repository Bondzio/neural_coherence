i just got a program called speedfan v4.34, the readings i got are as follow: fan 1: 4821 rpm fan 2: 0 rpm fan 3: 0 rpm temp 1: 25c temp 2: -55c temp 3: 52c hd0 : 35c so um.. is that normal for a pc or is this software just useless.
if yes then is there any foolproof way to moniter pc temperature.
please explain in details.
