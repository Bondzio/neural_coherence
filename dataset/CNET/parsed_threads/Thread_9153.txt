<s> Hello to all of you for the first time coz I'm new to this forum. </s>
<s> I'm planning to build my own desktop for the first time (hence the name &quot;novicebuilder&quot; !) </s>
<s> These are the specs I've come up with for my dream PC, which I plan to use as an all-in-one work/gaming/home theater system. </s>
<s> Can someone please tell me if they notice any components here that have known compatibility issues with each other. </s>
<s> Thank you in advance. </s>

<s> I want to have 8 gigs of RAM on Vista 64-bit. </s>
<s> Now the mobo's spec does not mention if it supports Intel EMT64 technology. </s>
<s> Does that mean that I cannot have 8 Gigs of RAM on this MOBO even with Vista-64 bit ? </s>
<s> I've been wondering about this forever. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> ******** Any comments or suggestions regarding the above mentioned system configuration are welcome and would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> http://www.motherboards.org/reviews/motherboards/1704_1.html Suggest you also google ASUS P5N32-E SLI nForce 680i and look at some of the reviews. </s>
<s> I saw 150 for that specific Mobo at Newegg. </s>
<s> Generally ASUS has a memory compatibility list grouped by stick size at the downloads area for each Mobo. </s>
<s> If you don't see it listed it could be an issue. </s>
<s> Hey jconner thanks for the info. </s>
<s> I looked at the Newegg reviews and the Qualified Vendor list. </s>
<s> Now one of the reviewers stated that he was happy about the board supporting 8 GB, but didn't mention clearly if he actually had 8 GB on it. </s>
<s> Now my question becomes: Even if the system does not have a problem recognizing 8 GB and shows 8 GB, how would you know if the system is ever using the second 4 gig pair when the first 4 gig pair is used up ? </s>
<s> In other words, is it even theoretically possible for the system to ever use the 2nd pair of 4 gigs without Intel EMT support ? </s>
<s> It says on the Intel QX6800 prod. </s>
<s> brief .pdf file that EMT requires supporting Mobo, BIOS, and OS. </s>
<s> any ideas ? </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> and also I would e-mail ASUS support and ask the question of them. </s>
<s> I'm sorry I don't know the answer to your question. </s>
<s> Intel support and forums may also have an answer. </s>
<s> I also tend to use google like a person and ask specific questions with sometimes very good results. </s>
<s> Almost always I find it gets me to forum discussions similar to what I'm trying to find out. </s>
<s> Glad the suggestions helped a bit. </s>
<s> ok i will post the question there. </s>
<s> thanks a lot jconner. </s>
