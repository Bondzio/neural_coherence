1.1.1	I 'm planning on building a AMD 64 3200+ comp ...	St
1.1.2	ASPIRE Blue Voice Active Cold Cathode Flourescence Lamp Aspire X-Dreamer II ( Black ) Case w/350W 6x 80MM fans ASUS & quot ; K8V SE Deluxe & quot ; K8T800 Chipset Motherboard SAPPHIRE ATI RADEON 9800XT Video Card , 256MB DDR , 256-bit AMD Athlon 64 3200+ , 1MB L2 Cache Corsair XMS 184 Pin 512MB Registered DDR PC-3200 Western Digital Raptor 36.7GB 10,000RPM SATA HDD Samsung Black 52X32X52 CD-RW Drive Samsung Black 16X DVD-ROM Drive I 'm not sure if the 350 watt power supply is enough , was going to upgrade to a 500 watt ps , but some ppl are telling me that the 350 is big enough please tell me what you think .	St
1.1.3	Also let me know what you think of the computer ...	Sug
1.1.4	I plan to use it mostly for games and only a few games at any given time , ( thats why the HDD is so small , but considering moving up to the 74 gig ) I also have a 80 GB external USB 2.0 HD that will be hooked up too .	St
1.2.1	While the machine may work fine for months , eventually the & quot ; just big enough & quot ; power supply starts to age and the symptom is one like yours .	St
1.2.2	I 'll supply an article about how to select the size and then another about how they lie about the rated size .	St
1.2.3	http : //www.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/ http : //www.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/ Bob	St
1.3.1	Hi , I got the same system with a Radeon 9800 pro and a WD 160 GB .	St
1.3.2	Only one problem : HD is switched off at end of BIOS setup , then boots properly the XP system .	St
1.3.3	Dont know the reason for the switch off at begin of session ( 350 W Power supply should be enough but if not it could cause the problem ) .	St
1.3.4	I will post when the issue is solved .	St
1.3.5	Anyone has an idea ?	Ques
1.3.6	I will test a 400 W PSU .	St
1.3.7	Regs Ralfonso	St
1.4.1	From 350 to 400 is not a big step to assure a move away from that possible issue .	St
1.4.2	I supplied articles why I add 100 Watts more than the system requires .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	get an antec 430w psu .	St
1.5.2	right in the middle .	St
1.5.3	also , instead of the 9800 xt you should consider getting a nvidia 6800 or 6800 gt .	St
1.5.4	the 9800 xt is still a great card though .	St
1.6.1	Personally , I would go with st least a 400W power supply just to make sure I had enough .	St
1.6.2	If you shop around for the best price it does n't cost that much to upgrade to more than enough power handling capacity .	St
1.6.3	Also , I would probably skip the 10,000rpm drive and get a much larger 7200 for less money , then put my savings into loading up on RAM .	St
1.6.4	I do n't do much gaming , but I do video editing which is about equally resource intensive .	St
1.6.5	It has been my experience that maxing out processor and RAM makes the most difference .	St
1.6.6	I have three 7200rpm drives totalling 480GB internal storage - and another 360GB external storage .	St
1.6.7	With an Athlon 64 and 1.5GB RAM I have had no problems with my hard drives being fast enough .	St
1.6.8	Also , I installed a dual layer DVD burner which also handles CDs plenty fast enough .	St
1.6.9	I also find that there is little difference between & quot ; no name & quot ; and brand name drives other than a ( usually ) major price difference - and I saved a drive slot by only using one drive .	St
1.6.10	Of course , these are just my opinions based on my experiences - so do with them as you wish .	St
1.6.11	Good luck .	Polite
1.7.1	as big as you cna get is best !	St
1.7.2	for a system like this I would n't go for less than 400W and if I could n't afford this I would make concessions in the form of the DVd-RW to egt a larger power suply then buy this later .	St
1.7.3	If you can afford it , go for the 500W , I would n't think 350 is enough but it 's really a matter of judgement .	St
1.7.4	Not having enough power can cause your computer to turn itself off which is extrmly annoying ( not least becuase you losoe al unsaved work )	St
1.8.1	With what you 're running , a 350-watt PSU is more than sufficient ... however , if you plan to overclock your components and upgrade in the future , then go for at least a 400-watt PSU .	St
1.8.2	A good deal would be an Antec NeoPower 470-watt PSU .	Polite
1.8.3	If you wan na save some cash but still get a good deal on a very powerful power supply from the previous generation ( late 2002-2003 ) , try gunning for the Antec TruPower 550-watt PSU .	St
1.8.4	Since I 'm commenting , I should add that your choice of registered memory is not the wisest one ... it 's expensive and limits your choices ... only servers use registered RAM , apart from the Athlon64 FX-51 .	St
1.8.5	Unbuffered RAM is definitely better and cheaper .	St
1.8.6	Your 3200+ has a 1mb L2 cache ... meaning that its a Clawhammer from the 754 socket generation .	St
1.8.7	It 's not a good upgrade path and may be phased out after the nForce 4/K8T890 boards are released .	St
1.8.8	Furthermore , it uses a single channel memory controller instead of the 939 's dual channel controller .	St
1.8.9	Thus , it 's performance is n't nearly as good as the 939 socket processors .	St
1.8.10	I also agree that you should n't bother with 10,000rpm drive ... its cost isnt worth the small performance difference .	St
1.8.11	You 'd definitely be better off with a larger capacity 7,200rpm drive .	St
1.9.1	I have been custom building my own pc 's for about 6 years .	St
1.9.2	Considering the vid card your using needs a minimum 300w PS I would want a little more than 350 .	St
1.9.3	I would reccomend the Antec true power 550 it 's what I use .	St
1.9.4	A very solid PS good value and gives you a lot more upgrade abilty w/o a new PS .	St
1.9.5	Try to always be forward looking .	St
1.9.6	Good luck .	Polite
1.10.1	Those links you posted were AWESOME , Bob .	St
1.10.2	THG is a great resource I 'd never seen before .	Polite
1.10.3	I 'm sure I 'll be using it a lot now .	St
1.10.4	Thanks for the tip !	St
1.11.1	When I built my comp I was n't sure what I would finish up with so I bought a Q-Tec 550w Dual Fan Gold , which was on offer anyway .	St
1.11.2	I now have an Athlon 2600+ on an Abit NF7 S board with a FX5200 8X 128Mb DDR graphics card .	St
1.11.3	I have 2 floppy drives , DVD ROM and a dual DVD burner .	St
1.11.4	Two Hitachi Desk Star hard drives 120Gb and 160Gb , I have a Canon S530D printer with a built in card reader and I have a front panel with 4 card readers .	St
1.11.5	Iv put in 8 fans and it sounds like Concord and runs like a dream with XP Pro SP2 .	St
1.11.6	Ken	St
1.12.1	I forgot to mention I have 1536Mbs DDR RAM .	St
1.12.2	Ken	St
1.13.1	bigger is better if you plan to add very many usb or firewire cards or one of the faster video or sound cards .	St
1.13.2	They eat a lot of power .	St
1.13.3	my custom build w/soyo dragon plus mother board started with a cheap 350 watt supply .	St
1.13.4	after adding way more extras than it could handle it went south .	St
1.13.5	A 420 watt was the largest one I could get locally on short notice , but if I could have found a 500W or 600W one I would have gone for the biggest one .	St
1.14.1	KyleMAD , Good advice !	St
1.14.2	How noisy are the Antec PSU 's you mentioned ?	Ques
1.14.3	Thanks , Bill V	St
1.15.1	I had a query like this and i dropped the guys at PSU a line and they sorted it out for me .	St
1.15.2	http : //www.psudesigns.co.uk Hope this helps	St
