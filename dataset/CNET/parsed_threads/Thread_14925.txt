<s> Hi all, what I would like to do is access my computer from elsewhere. </s>
<s> I know their are sites that do this for you but I dont want to do it this way. </s>
<s> What I want to do is somehow connect directly to my PC at home by somehow opening a webpage and signing in. </s>
<s> I realise their are a lot of security issues to this. </s>
<s> Also when I am at work they have a proxy that prevents me from accessing certain sites. </s>
<s> Is their anyway I can get past this by somehow connecting through my computer at home and using my internet connection? </s>
<s> Is this trackable by the system admin at my work if I did do something like this? </s>
<s> Any links with info etc would be appreciated. </s>

<s> Please don't ask how to &quot;get around&quot; a work proxy. </s>
<s> That can get your post locked. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> Check the forum policies. </s>
<s> As to remote access there are a few solutions like TIGHTVNC but I strongly suggest you never risk your job over internet use. </s>

<s> Oops I wasn't away I was breaking any rules. </s>
<s> All I really wanted to do was access my webmail without getting blocked all the time. </s>
<s> Didnt want to risk losing the job! </s>
<s> But take my word that you never want to be found out or caught &quot;getting around&quot; a workplace filter. </s>
<s> The usual reprimands are getting harsh. </s>

<s> I have used this guide in the past. </s>
<s> Works well. </s>
