<s> How in the world can I stop that horrible modem noise I hear when I connect to the internet using dial-up? </s>
<s> The volume slider doesn't seem to work. </s>
<s> Is there any other way to stop it? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> give you the option to mute the modem (normally done at initial set-up) but you can usually access this from your sign in screen. </s>
<s> If not, call your ISP for procedure It's actually not a good idea to mute the modem. </s>
<s> You could have a dialer placed on your machine & a hacker could make phone calls from it. </s>
<s> This happened to me years ago when I got my phone bill with calls from USA to Africa & England. </s>
<s> A Virus scan found a dialer! </s>
<s> If you can alway's hear your modem, this won't happen. </s>
