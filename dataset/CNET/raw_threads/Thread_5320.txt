This is the second netgear router gone bad in less than a year. I have spent about $75.00 in service calls (1 for each router) and a month of emailing to have netgear tell me the router is bad. Their warranty replacement solution is to mail back the defective router and then they will send a replacement...a 2 week time frame and I have to pay shipping; or I can pay about $20.00 to have them ship a new router before shipping mine...or pay above that to have next day shipping. I told them this was unacceptable...needless to say I will be going out this week and purchasing a link sys router.

Now turn on the Netgear router. In the back on the router is a reset button. Push it in for ten seconds and wait for it to reset. Now plug in the ethernet cable to your computer. Plug the other end of the ethernet cable into a numbered port of the router, 1,2,3 or 4. Login to the router. http://192.168.0.1 ( this will be your login, unless you change your LAN ip address. If you change it then, click start, click run click command, type ipconfig /all and look for the default gateway. this will be your new number to put in the address bar to log in.) Once your in, You can either use the setup wizard or configure it yourself. ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/wgr614v4_install_guide.pdf Firmware update is found here http://kbserver.netgear.com/products/wgr614v4.asp Rick

When prompted, enter admin for the router username and password for the router password, both in lower case letters. Rick

Any ideas on how I can get my username/password?
