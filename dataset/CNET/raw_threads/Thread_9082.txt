I installed another 1G chip in the second channel, DDR2 PC2-4200 533 mhzs as per the manufacturers specifications. At boot-up the computer does not recognize the second chip and I am still stuck with 1G of memory. Have I missed something or is there a solution. I purchased 2 different manufacturers chips, Kingston and PNY and neither work. This is a Pentium 4 3.06 Ghzs.

If the sticks don't work then try other sticks. REMEMBER THAT NO DISCUSSION will make these sticks compatible. If they don't work, game over. Bob
