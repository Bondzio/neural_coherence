i have my internal hard drive set up with 3 partitions.
on the 1st partition i have xp sp1.
i use that for a backup operating system.
on the 2nd partition i have xp sp3 and i use it as my primary operating system.
the 3rd partition is the largest and i use it just for storage.
i dont really need it because i recently purchased a large external drive.
i really want to try the linux based ubuntu operating system.
can i install it on the 3rd partition?
