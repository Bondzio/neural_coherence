<s> I just bought a 17&quot; Acer (AL1715) monitor for my daughter. </s>
<s> She lives a ways from me and so it's hard for me to help her. </s>
<s> She has it set up and says it looks pretty good. </s>
<s> However she has been advised by a co-worker to download a driver. </s>
<s> One did NOT come with the monitor and apparently wasn't supposed to. </s>
<s> She did download a driver and saved it to her desktop. </s>
<s> No matter what she does, she can't install it and Wizard is telling her it can't find it. </s>
<s> Anyone familiar with this problem? </s>
<s> We would greatly appreciate any help you can give us. </s>
<s> Her operating system is WINXP. </s>
<s> Thanks, Val </s>
<s> If the monitor work like she said.. then why she need a driver? </s>
<s> She says her friend who is into graphics, told her it would be better with the Acer Driver. </s>
<s> When she's on her home page, it is too small. </s>
<s> I think that could be corrected. </s>
<s> We were able to download a driver but can't install it or open it. </s>
<s> There are five icons and none of them seem to be for installation. </s>
<s> I'm thoroughly confused by this. </s>
<s> Thanks for getting back to me. </s>

<s> Drivers are for the video card NOT the monitor!!! </s>

<s> John, I'm so glad I checked back. </s>
<s> I'd about given up. </s>
<s> What you said was what I thought but this guy (in the know)that my daughter works with, thought differently. </s>
<s> I've got one of these monitors coming to me and I'm glad to have the problem solved. </s>
<s> Thanks a bunch. </s>
<s> Val </s>
