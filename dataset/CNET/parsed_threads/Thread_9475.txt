<s> So my family is getting a new computer for christmas, and I can do anything I want with the old computer. </s>
<s> So I've decided to turn it into a Media Center/ Torrent TIVO. </s>
<s> Mainly for just watching videos, listening to some music once and while, etc. </s>
<s> The computer is an HP Pavilion a320n. </s>
<s> Its has 2.98 GHZ AMD Athalon Processor, 512 megs of RAM, and 120 Gig hardrive, Windows XP home edition. </s>
<s> I have 512 Megs of RAM, so I'm going to upgrade it to 1G, should that be enough? </s>
<s> I don't plan on using it record live tv or anything that intense. </s>
<s> I also need to upgrade to video card so I have tv out put. </s>
<s> Which card would be a good deal? </s>
<s> I don't want to spend alot, between 30 and 50 bucks is kind of my range. </s>
<s> SHould I opt for a card with a tv tuner instead? </s>
<s> The hardrive is 120 gigs. </s>
<s> I don't plan on stooring my movie collection on it really. </s>
<s> More like torrenting my favorite shows I miss and then wathcing, and once wathced delete them. </s>
<s> So should 120 gig hardrive be big enough? </s>
<s> As for media center software, I've been looking at Media Poral. </s>
<s> I don't want to spend the money to get MS Media Center. </s>
<s> Are any other free suggestion for media center type software? </s>
<s> Thats about it, have I covered all my bases for a basic media center/ torrent tivo device. </s>
<s> I'm going to upgrade my ram, and get a video card with tv output. </s>
<s> Don't think I need a bigger hardrive. </s>
<s> Anything else you all would upgrade. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Torrent+TIVO&btnG=Google+Search finds nothing that I could discuss in this forum. </s>
<s> Almost all video content via Torrents is pirated so the forum policies forbid that disussion. </s>
<s> If we ignore that why can't you use the usual MCE and XBOX 360 combo? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I don't have an xbox 360, so that really isn't an option. </s>
<s> Thats why I'm using my old pc. </s>
<s> Also, I've seen most that stuff of bittorent and rss, but thanks anyways. </s>
<s> And I didn't discuss my use of bittorent really, so I'm hoping my thread isn't veering into bad territory or even grey territory. </s>
<s> If so I will tweek it some. </s>
<s> As to a do-it-yourself item some have loads of fun trying to get such to work proper. </s>
<s> Maybe you can look on google.com about &quot;Build your own Media PC&quot; or such but the MCE+360 combo is nice. </s>
<s> Apple will have their iTV out soon so you should look there if you want to &quot;see how it should be done.&quot; Bob </s>
