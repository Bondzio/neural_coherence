did similar with old cpus stashed away in my basement.
decided to see exactly how much power those things could tolerate, if the manufacturers claims true.
started running trickles of unadulterated current through each, advanced it in stages.
found that was indeed true, the hd exceeded 7,200 rpm, last i saw of it, had hit lightspeed, was still booging out the window.
most probably not processing, just hitting upper limits of rpm, was a fast little beastie til entrophy took over.
if u can cobble together something usable from all the ''leftovers'', good luck.
i had delusions of doing the same, never got there and just got tired of seeing them about.
seems better to sell everything salvagable, toss the rest (or see how fast it can really run ), and save your $ to invest in a new, more top-line model.
good luck, your particular diety knows ur going to need it!
