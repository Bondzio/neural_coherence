if you want a hard drive with ibm technology in it - i.e the deskstar and ultrastar ranges, these are now made by hitachi gst (  ).
ibm did a lot of r&d in hard drive technology and were responsible for many breakthroughs, but they were always competitive on price.
i don't know if or how things might have changed since hitachi took over though.
