i don;t care about gigabit connections.
they got fiber cables and network adapters at decent prices but nothing for the physical networking devices that are low end or mid range.
why go with cat6 when fiber is just around the corner.
i'd like to see wifi users try to obtain speeds that fiber networking can produce.
