I have an HP D2430 printer that I use with my Compaq V6444US notebook when I'm away from home.
Yesterday, a Dialog Box appeared with &quot;Solution Center The feature you are trying to use is on a CD-ROM or other removeable disk that is not available.
Insert the &quot;Solution Center&quot; disk and click OK.&quot; Since I was not trying to &quot;use anything&quot;, I don't know why this Dialog Box appeared.
This printer is just that ... a printer only which works great.
How do I keep this message from reappearing?
Thank you.
