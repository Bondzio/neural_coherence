I'm having a similar problem.
After the post info leaves and the Win logo comes up, I get a 30 sec.
flashing cursor.
I believe mine is also related to a RAID (Asus A8V) problem; even though I'm not using SATA ot RAID.
Like old age, I don't like it but I'm learning to live with it.
Check back to this post occasionally 'cause if I find a fix for my problem, I'll post it here.
