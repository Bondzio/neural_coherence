<s> Hello All Need your help in getting things right. </s>
<s> My machine is using &quot;Intel Desktop Board D101GGC&quot; MotherBoard http://www.intel.com/products/motherboard/d101ggc/ I am interested in getting a sound card hopefully &quot;Creative PCI Express Sound Blaster X-Fi Titanium&quot; http://us.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=0&subcategory=&product=17927 Would this fit in to my PC?? </s>
<s> Help </s>
<s> I meant Card and not Case </s>
<s> Do PCIE 1X cards work in PCIE x16 or 2.0 slots? </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Do+PCIE+1X+cards+work+in+PCIE+x16+or+2.0+slots%3F&btnG=Google+Search&aq=f&oq= But this is not a good idea since you use up the PCIE slot for something nicer for the video. </s>
<s> I would not do this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> But then the Motherboard details mention that i have &quot;PCI Express x1&quot; slot available? </s>
<s> Can't i use that one? </s>
<s> Intel makes quite a few variants so I went with the picture on your link. </s>
<s> -&gt; But you did your homework, you have a X1 card and a X1 slot. </s>
<s> Why would you ask if they belong to each other? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> When it comes to motherboard and naming conventions i get confused. </s>
<s> The site read &quot;Expansion Capabilities - Two PCI Conventional* bus connectors - One PCI Express* x1 bus add-in card connector &quot; but only after you said about x1 slot and x1 card my confusion ends. </s>
<s> Thanks Bob for the Super-Quick Response </s>
<s> Trying to get hold of a image of the PCI slots to understand better. </s>
<s> that mobo has one pci-express x1 slot. </s>
<s> Yes </s>
<s> Why are you using a MicroATX mobo, when you would probably be better off using an ATX, unless mobo size is an issue in your case. </s>
<s> A regular ATX card should provide you with at least 1 more PCI slot for your sound card. </s>
