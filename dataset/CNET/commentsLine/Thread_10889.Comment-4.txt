i like velocity micro's stuff, but lenovo has been doing good things with the old ibm lines.
the machines are apples n oranges.
curious what the op's purpose is.
heads up: every velocity micro i've seen i'd be embarrassed to put in an office.
not as tacky as alienware kinds of stuff, but the glowing blue leds scream out gamer-geek, true chick/client repellant.
