Well, my next upgrade would be: a LCD, a DVI video card (AGP), and another 512mb RAM chip. Now that I'm not that good at hardware and such stuff, I need to know what exactly should I do to make sure my motherboard can hold more items. To be more specific, where to look inside the case? And do the motherboard slots have specific names/numbers so that I can match them to the stuff I'll buy? (in order to be compatible) Many thanks

Really wonder if a DVI LCD monitor is worth it, depending on what monitor you have now. You must look inside to see if both memory slots are already populated. Go to google, search Belarc and also Everest, download both, run them and printout the results, that'll give you all the info that you need. If hou make a huge increase in the video card, might need a new power supply. Wonder if any upgradew will provide very much noticeable increase in performance.

As for upgrading memory, take this with you to the store: Two 184-pin DDR SDRAM DIMM sockets Support for single-sided or double-sided DIMMs (DDR 333/266) Support for up to 2 GB system memory As you can see, you have two memory slots. Look inside the system to ensure that only one is filled and one open. If both slots are filled, you'll need to toss the old and replace with new. For the full specs on your system, go to http://www.intel.com/design/motherbd/sv/ The system board supports a 4X AGP card. You'll find some low cost 2X/4X AGP video cards that include DIV support. On Intel's site, you'll find lots of information about the motherboard your system is based on.
