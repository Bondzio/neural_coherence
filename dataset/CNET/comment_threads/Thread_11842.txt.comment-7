First happy to hear that you were able to successfuly reinstall.
Second, the blurry section on your monitor .... Possible that Video Drivers had become corrupted on the orginal install.
If it returns the monitor may be going bad.
Have yet to own or use the LCD monitors, so this is at best a WAG .... Luck Bill
