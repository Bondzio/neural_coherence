USB 2.0 and Firewire 400 are much the same, I doubt you'd notice the difference.
But certainly here in the UK, USB external drives are far more plentiful than firewire and the competition keeps the prices a tad lower.
The specifications for Firewire 800 and USB 3 are in the final throes of standardization but as far as I am aware, nobody has yet committed to make external drives for them when available.
Currently, Gigabit Ethernet would be faster (as stated earlier, don't even think about anything less than gigabit) BUT you'd be looking at attaching an iSCSI box as your external drive and these are definitely priced for business and not for consumers.
One other possibility is an eSATA drive.
SATA PC cards with an external aSATA port are becoming readily available but again, they aren't as cheap as USB.
