1.1.1	I 'm having trouble getting this card to function properly with my PC .	St
1.1.2	I went through the installation procedures , and when I first start up the PC , I can see everything up to the Windows loading progress bar screen .	St
1.1.3	But after that , everything goes black .	St
1.1.4	I imagine it could be some configuration problem , but I 'm at a loss .	St
1.1.5	BTW , it 's not a power supply problem , I have a 500W supply installed .	St
1.1.6	Does anyone have any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	The good news is I doubt it 's a hardware issue .	St
1.2.2	So try this .	Sug
1.2.3	Boot to SAFE MODE and change the resolution to 800x600 , OK your way out and do a proper reboot .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Well , I tried to reboot into safe mode , but the process began to hang at the Agp440.sys service .	St
1.3.2	I found a MS support doc that instructed to disable this service ( via windows recovery off the CD ) .	St
1.3.3	So now it just hangs on another service in the boot process .	St
1.3.4	When I do n't try safe mode , it exhibits the same problem as before , no problems until after the Windows progress baar screen .	St
1.3.5	I 'm at a loss as to what to do , and since I 'm not that windows-savvy , I do n't want to do anything irreparable .	St
1.3.6	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.4.1	It will appear to hang .	St
1.4.2	Many people wo n't give it the 20 minutes I 've see it take to boot .	St
1.4.3	My bet is still on the video resolution is incorrect so this is how I fix it .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	I let it go for about an hour twice , and each time it hangs on btkrnl.sys .	St
1.5.2	I just ca n't get to that logon screen ...	St
1.6.1	And not a good one .	Polite
1.6.2	It is usually a sign of malware or spyware damage .	St
1.6.3	My next step is to do a XP REPAIR INSTALL ( see google . )	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
