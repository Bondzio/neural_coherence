sometimes machines will not work when they accumulate too much dust inside.
i would suggest using a vaccume cleaner to clear all the dust and perhaps a q-tip to clean those fan blades.
if the system says no os was found you might want to remove the floppy disk that's in the floppy drive, it usually has no operating system.
