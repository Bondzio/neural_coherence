<s> Hey all, I've got a question for any networking pro that might be able to diagnose what's wrong with my internet connection and cure my frustration! </s>
<s> I've been through customer service with my cable provider and Microsoft, but continue to have issues with Xbox Live. </s>
<s> I moved into a new place a couple months ago and reluctantly subscribed for Comcast internet/cable. </s>
<s> No real issues when browsing the web, downloading or uploading. </s>
<s> The only real issues I have are when I'm playing on my Xbox. </s>
<s> I have a wireless router, a Linksys E20000, plugged directly into the modem and the Xbox plugged directly into the router. </s>
<s> Here are speed test results: Download - 24.49 Mbps Upload - 4.18 Mbps When logging into Xbox Live, I connect quickly. </s>
<s> When playing games (NHL or more recently Halo 4), I am able to find matches quickly and party up with friends with ease. </s>
<s> In- game, movement is fluid and lag-free. </s>
<s> Controls are responsive, graphics smooth. </s>
<s> Then out of nowhere, I'll be dropped out of the match. </s>
<s> In games like NHL, I am dropped from the game, but not disconnected from Xbox Live. </s>
<s> In Halo, I will either get dropped out or will get a temporarily timed out before returning to the match as if it had never happened. </s>
<s> I can't seem to find any posts or similar issues on the web, but have talked to friends who have had similar problems. </s>
<s> The best I've heard it described as is a &quot;microdrop&quot;. </s>
<s> It's as if it just drops out so quickly that it can drop me out of matches, but I could be simultaneously Googling away with no problems. </s>
<s> I've had port forwarding configured, opened my NAT type, etc. </s>
<s> This isn't an Xbox Live issue, I'm sure. </s>
<s> I've had it at several homes before this one and never have experienced anything like it. </s>
<s> I suppose the blame would either fall on the router or Comcast's internet. </s>
<s> Comcast says the internet connection is healthy and they are not very interested in troubleshooting. </s>
<s> Someone, please help! </s>

<s> Forget forwarding and all that. </s>
<s> Put the XBOX into the DMZ for a test run. </s>
<s> Be sure your wifi is turned off for the test run and the firmware in the router is the latest. </s>
