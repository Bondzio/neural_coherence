<s> I just bought a Sony RA820 with 200G hard disk, however I found there is only one local drive (C), I tried to create another local drive for data and media storage just in case my operating system fails and I should lose everything. </s>
<s> I checked the support and help areas for creating partition, but both methods in window interface and DOS interface are not working after I followed the instruction. </s>
<s> Where can I get references for this task? </s>
<s> What's the size of this 'C' drive? </s>
<s> If it's almost 200GB, then there is no place to make any additional partitions. </s>
<s> Use a Partition Resizer to reduce the size of this 'C' and then you can make additional partitions in the freed space. </s>
<s> Much more info has been posted in many other postings in this site!! </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Thank you for replying the post. </s>
<s> The C drive is 183G in total, while there is another 6G reserved for recovery task. </s>
<s> My major concern is that once if I try to make new partition, I might accidentally format the entire C drive and lose everything, including the operating system. </s>
<s> Please advise where can I get the partition resizer as mentioned? </s>
<s> Thank you again. </s>
