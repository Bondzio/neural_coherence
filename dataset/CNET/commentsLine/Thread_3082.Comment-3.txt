i don't understand your answer.
so little gain, compared to what?
i don't want to know whether the tv can be a replacement for a computer monitor.
from an older computer that had tv out, i know that the reso- lution supported, is to low for that purpose.
but for watching movies and videos is was sufficient (800x600).
and that is my question, can i use the dvi port to connect to the tv scart port, and by that obtain the above purpose.
still thanks for your effort.
