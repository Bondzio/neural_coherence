1.1.1	In order to establish a LAN I 've installed a linksys router on my main computer and a linksys adapter card on a second computer .	St
1.1.2	Although each was installed correctly and seem to be working individually , I ca n't log on from the second computer to the internet nor will it file share .	St
1.1.3	When I try to log on from the second computer , I get the message & quot ; network hardware disconnected or unplugged & quot ; , which they are n't .	St
1.1.4	What 's up with this ?	Ques
1.2.1	Comp1 operating system ?	Ques
1.2.2	Comp2 operating system ?	Ques
1.2.3	Linksys router model ?	Ques
1.2.4	Linksys adapter card model ?	Ques
1.2.5	I am assuming that you are making wired ( not wireless ) connectinos with both computers .	St
1.2.6	Correct ?	Ques
1.2.7	Try swapping network cables to see if one is faulty .	St
1.3.1	Both computers use Windows XP-Home .	St
1.3.2	The Router model is WRT546S ( Wireless ) and the card adapter is WPM54GS ( Wireless ) .	St
1.3.3	I 'm told by the computer that the card is working properly .	St
1.3.4	And the computer to which the router is attached is able to copnnect to the internet .	St
1.3.5	But with respect to the card adapater , I keep getting the message can not associate with access point .	St
1.4.1	1 .	St
1.4.2	Install latest firmware for WRT54GS .	St
1.4.3	2 .	St
1.4.4	Install latest driver for WMP54GS .	St
1.4.5	The driver for your WMP54GS may include a new version of Linksys Wireless Network Monitor .	St
1.4.6	If so , the installation process might require you to uninstall the previous version before you can go forward .	St
1.4.7	Another issue : Sometimes using Linksys Wireless Network Monitor to connect to the router is quirky .	St
1.4.8	Try right-clicking on the Linksys Network Monitor ( by your clock ) , and select the option to use Windows wireless network configuration .	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	I do n't hink it 's because the computer is too far away .	St
1.6.2	Our primary computer crashed and that 's when the trouble started .	St
1.6.3	Prior to that I had connectivity and the computers were both where they are presently .	St
1.6.4	I thought that the crash might have affected the router , so I bought and installed a new router with speed booster .	St
1.6.5	I even changed the adapter for the second computer .	St
1.6.6	But thus far , the second computer ca n't get access .	St
1.7.1	double check your , e connections .	St

1.7.3	just a little loose conection .	St
1.7.4	can screw up all !	St
