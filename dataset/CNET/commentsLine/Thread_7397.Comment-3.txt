standard television is equivilent to 320x240 resolution.
this typically looks pretty poor on a full screen monitor.
30 frames per second is considered real time video.
most of the video capture cards clame 640x480 resolution and 30 fps but they separate these as 2 different line items.
you usually get 640x480 at 15 fps or 320x240 at 30 fps.
you can save bandwidth by reducing to 25fps.
you should compare these numbers with your camera specs.
if it uses a standard lens you may be able to swap that out and improve the picture quality.
