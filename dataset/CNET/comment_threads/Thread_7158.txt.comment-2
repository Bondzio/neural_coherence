so can't offer much more than how I set it up.
I turned off system restore monitoring of the drive, set the drive letter manually, and use automatic caching.
I set permissions to read and change but not full control.
I can power off/on and the drive letter remains as does sharing.
My BIOS knows the drive by manufacturer and model just as if it was connected to the MB for what that's worth.
Maybe, for some reason, Windows doesn't see it as the same drive each time you restart.
