Right out of the box I started experiencing problems with it. More specifically the system never did a successful restart, forcing me to do a hard-reset on the box each time. The 'shut-downs' on the other hand were working fine. I spent a couple of hours with HP Technical Support trying to solve the problem but nothing worked. Eventually they had me do a 'destructive' system recovery and even that didn't fix it. Out of frustration I put the entire system back in the box and brought it back to where I had originally bought it. They gave me another one on the spot - no problem with this one so far, I am keeping my fingers crossed. Let me just tell you that I was glad I didn't buy this thing on the Web or from eBay. There is something to be said about being able to drive to a store and get a replacement the same day. Other than that this is a very nice system and I love the f1905b display!

But, alas, alot of buyers (me included) sometimes will cave in for the cheaper prices on eBay. Just wondering: Is that an AMD version or Intel? ~Ibrahim
