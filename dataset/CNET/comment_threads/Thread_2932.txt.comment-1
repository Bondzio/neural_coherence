I have a computer at work and want to play call of duty, but do not want to save it to the work computer or even make it look like I was playing games.
No one cares what I do at work, I just would like to have something to do in my free time.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
I want to know if I would be able to save the game to a external hd and put the cd-rom in the tray and begin playing.
