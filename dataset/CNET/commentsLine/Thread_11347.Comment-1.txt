hi client of mine has got nas lacie d2 network is installed on his lan and it was mapped to a public ip address for an adsl router.
private ip address for nas lacie d2 network is 192.168.10.50 and it is mapped to 87.67.x.x (not real wan ip) with port 21 as can be seen below :  from any remote location when i type in in a browser this ftp://87.67.x.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,i can access the folder on the nas lacie d2 networ as can be seen on the snapshot below :  rather than driving to the clients site and access through his lan, i need to access the nas remotely to update few configuration.
how can i remotely access web interface for lacie d2 network?
i tried to read the documentation below but i could not locate the section that is related to what i am looking for  thanks
