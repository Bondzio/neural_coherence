If you are talking PCMCIA VS USB for Wireless?
PCMCIAs Tend to have better performance, and are usually More Expensive... if you haven't Bought a Router/Card yet, I suggest Getting Same Brand name (Even though it won't matter) It will help if you have to call for support.
(They Won't do the Pointing Finger at the OTHER Product.
Also Pick up the 108MB/s Systems out now.
If you are going to buy something by using the search from http://www.pricewatch.com don't forget to check out http://www.resellerratings.com/ and see how others think about where you want to buy it from.
On Resellerratings.com you can also read reviews of what people bought.
I hope this helps.
