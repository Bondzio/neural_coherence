this topic has been discussed before here and elsewhere.
the basic conclusion is that for a &quot;stable&dependable output&quot; you need a psu capable of delivering now and later for your needs.
you can always buy what you can afford, but sticking too closely for a cheap or very low wattage psu will cost in the end.
all too often, when a psu does go poof, it may take other componets/devices with it and/or be the source of a possible electrical fire.
so take care in selection and having more wattage than your needs isn't going to hurt as if carrying an extra few $ when going xmas shopping.
there's a reason for so many psu's being offered as std.
or typical psu will fail or be &quot;out-grown&quot; before system life.
its just a safe bet to get a decent psu more than capable of handling your needs, low-wattage or not.
