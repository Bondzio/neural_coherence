<s> I am just starting to learn home network, so this might be simple to resolve, or not. </s>
<s> I have 2 computers next to each other. </s>
<s> A cable from each is run to an ethernet switch. </s>
<s> I ran network wizzard on both computers, using xphome sp1 on both. </s>
<s> I gave permission on several folders on both computers. </s>
<s> When I go to &quot;My Network Places&quot; I can see the folders listed from both computers. </s>
<s> If I click on a local folder, I get access. </s>
<s> When I click on the client computer I get this message: \\clientname\folder is not accessable. </s>
<s> You might not have permission to use this network souce. </s>
<s> Contact the administrator of this network to find out if you have access permissions. </s>
<s> Not enough server storage is available to process this command. </s>
<s> Any help getting me started is greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I would like to be able to have file and printer shareing, and access to the internet from the client computer. </s>
<s> I do have file and printer shareing turned on for both computers. </s>
<s> Thank you, Rick </s>
<s> I just found out that the printer shareing works, I just need the file shareing to work and connecting to the internet from the client computer. </s>
<s> You might want to try setting up a user account on each machine for the other. </s>
<s> This should allow you access. </s>
<s> Yea. </s>
<s> You might be stuck hunting down FAQ's or calling customer service. </s>
