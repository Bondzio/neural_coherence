Unfortunately I'm stuck with dial up for a while. Should I bother to buy a dial-up modem, and if so what should I buy? Do they make wireless dial-up modems. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

Never seen a wireless dial-up modem, but even if they exist, I would expect them to be more expensive than the Apple modem solution. Good luck P
