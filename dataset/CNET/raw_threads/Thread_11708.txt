The 8800gts/512 ($370) is almost as fast as an 8800gtx and $100 cheaper while the 8800gt/512 ($280) is faster than an 8800gts/640. if the soyo hdtv is 1366x768, then an 8800gt/512 would be able to handle it. 8800gts/512: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130312 8800gt/512: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127311 reviews: http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=3175&p=8 http://www.hothardware.com/articles/NVIDIA_GeForce_8800_GTS_Refresh_Asus_and_XFX/?page=8 http://enthusiast.hardocp.com/article.html?art=MTQzMSw4LCxoZW50aHVzaWFzdA== as for the mobo, are you a serious overclocker planning to hit 4ghz? if not, just get the p5k deluxe. don't pay for features you won't use (firewire, wifi, dual gigabit ethernet, etc). there's no difference between ddr2/ddr3 at the same speed. ddr3 won't make a real performance difference (10%) until speeds greater ddr3-1500 come about and ddr3's price drops by 50%. (is another 4fps really worth $250?). so stick with low latency (cl3) ddr2-800 or a good ddr2-1066 kit. both will OC to ddr2-1333 levels if you want.

MEM DDR2 1GB X 2 1066MHZ PC8500 CORSAIR DOMINATOR (4GB $396) MEM DDR2 2GB X 2 800MHZ CORSAIR (4GB $282) THE SOYO HAS 1366X768 THANKS....

Because of the higher clock speed, it will perform better on games that only utilize 2 cores, like older games. Newer games utilize 4 cores (Crysis) and therefore, you'll most likely get better performance with the Q6600.
