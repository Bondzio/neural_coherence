1.1.1	My husband and I recently purchased an HP J3680 All-in-One .	St
1.1.2	Shortly thereafter , we both purchased laptops .	St
1.1.3	Obviously , if we would have known we were buying laptops , we would have purchased a printer with a wireless card .	St
1.1.4	A rep on the live chat with HP tells me that the J3680 is not Bluetooth compatible , but I 'm not sure I trust him/her - they seemed to have a poor grasp on what I was asking .	St
1.1.5	My question is two-fold : a ) is the J3680 Bluetooth enabled ?	Ques
1.1.6	and if not , b ) is there an wireless printer adapter out there that we can get to be able to print to the J3680 without physically connecting the USB cord to our laptops ?	Ques
1.2.1	As to printer servers those are from Linksys , Netgear and such .	St
1.2.2	HOWEVER I find these too hard to setup for most owners .	St
1.2.3	Even I was taken aback following a 15 plus foldout sheet of instructions .	St
1.2.4	While you could research wifi print servers , you seem to want more support than I 'm seeing in the field .	St
1.2.5	I 'd contact a geeksquad and ask & quot ; how much to get it working ? & quot ; Bob	St
1.3.1	I 've seen the printer servers , and they appear to be more expensive than it would be to just buy a new printer with wireless capabilities , especially if we watched sales and picked one up cheap !	St
1.4.1	It 's still debatable about how terrible these things are to setup but here 's one I one - & gt ; http : //www.iogear.com/product/GMFPSU22W6/ from http : //www.geeks.com/details.asp ? invtid=GMFPSU22W6 & cat=PRN HOWEVER this is still too rough on setup in my opinion but the price was right and I have some USB memory stick served up too .	St
1.4.2	I put a Watt meter on it and it sits there drawing 2 Watts so it 's not as bad as some others .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
