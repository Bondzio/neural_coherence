<s> Ok, so... My computer died a tragic death. </s>
<s> They tell me his capacitors blew, they expanded to an unnatural volume and started leaking a mysterious red powder. </s>
<s> I suspect this is what was causing the comp to endlessly reboot every 40 seconds when i would try and turn it on. </s>
<s> After an unsuccessful exorcism I brought the big boy to a more professional computer shop. </s>
<s> And they're the ones who told me the motherboard is dead and there's nothing I can do about it. </s>
<s> I had just recently bought a 1 Gb RAM module though, and it feels like it would be a shame to let it go to waste. </s>
<s> As a bonus buying a computer that uses one of those old RAMs (DDR1 I think he called it) will be much cheaper than buying one of those new i5 supercomputers. </s>
<s> So I want to transfer my RAMs safely. </s>
<s> Ideally I would just swap them from on computer to the next while they are rig next to one another, but I don't... </s>
<s> Perfectly trust this computer store. </s>
<s> I want to open up the computer I buy and make sure the stick will fit while still in the store. </s>
<s> That way I can catch any problems with them right next to me. </s>
<s> But how do I that? </s>
<s> I only have 1 RAM case, and I have 2 modules. </s>
<s> And it's been raining like crazy in these parts! </s>
<s> I'm not just going to step outside with the card lying naked in my hand will I? </s>
<s> So, any tips? </s>
<s> There is no DDR1, but it maybe in reference to DDR. </s>
<s> There is DDR2 and DDR3, the latter new ram modules. </s>
<s> Any new to you mtrbd. </s>
<s> that uses DDR isn't really the latest mtrbd. </s>
<s> out there. </s>
<s> Your best bet is DDR2 usage and that's not DDR1. </s>
<s> These aren't interchangeable. </s>
<s> You're really need to move on, but if you find any mtrbd. </s>
<s> that uses DDR, it WILL SAY SO VIA THE SPECS. </s>
<s> So review whatever you get and verify that requirement. </s>
<s> Alas, for low cost buying a DDR2 is the better choice, but if you need to buy then DDR3 is far better. </s>
<s> That choice I leave to you. </s>
<s> You can find older mtrbd. </s>
<s> as closeouts, eBay, Craigslist, etc. </s>
<s> in keeping to swap that mtrbd.. Cheap entry new systems are available under $400 if that keeps within your budget. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> You are asking about something widely discussed. </s>
<s> In short you ground yourself and pull the parts out. </s>
<s> Then same for installing. </s>
<s> Seems like some need more than that quick version. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> @ R. Proffitt Yes I understand how to insert a card once the computer is already in my house, what I am asking is how should I store the RAM (what kind of container should I use) to get it to the store. </s>
<s> Because right now the only thing I can figure is to use a ziplock or my bare hands (I don't trust aluminum paper...) @Willy Hold on, I wrote it down somewhere...&quot;One 512MB DDR400 PC3200U 184-pin RAM, and one 1GB of the same type.&quot;. </s>
<s> That's what was in my old Pentium IV when it died. </s>
<s> You're saying this type of RAM ISN'T interchangeable? </s>
<s> And I wouldn't be able to pop them into a new Pentium IV? </s>
<s> If I'm going to push up to 400$ I might as well wait for boxing day and see what deals show up then. </s>
<s> If you don't now then you truly need to know what specs your old system was. </s>
<s> Visit http://www.crucial.com and using your known model# or mtrbd. </s>
<s> info verify what you have. </s>
<s> I'm sure that DDR is the end result. </s>
<s> You CAN NOT swap DDR and DDR2 ram into each other slots, beleieve it, there is a physical limitation of the actual ram module, google for pics. </s>
<s> If you find another P4 mtrbd. </s>
<s> then again verify if you can re-use DDR into its ram slots. </s>
<s> This is all explained clearly by the specs of that system/mtrbd., so be sure what you have. </s>
<s> As for your actual ram 512mb and 1gb both being DDR aren't going to be installed in any DDR2 slot, period. </s>
<s> Though, if you find a new P4 mtrbd. </s>
<s> and DDR ram capable, yes the ram can be re-used. </s>
<s> As for handling any ram, re-use the anti-static bags or material. </s>
<s> If none is present, the best available substitute, use plain copy/office paper, just keep handling to a minimum and de-static(ESD) yourself before handling, by grounding to some metal. </s>
<s> Google for ESD characteristics. </s>
<s> I hope, I made myself clear. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Sorry but plastics unless treated for anti-static would be a bad idea. </s>
<s> The surface charge on plastics can kill chips. </s>
<s> Aluminum foil is far better for this. </s>
