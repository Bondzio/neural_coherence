Does Bluetooth Jabra A320 or some other device work with my laptop to communicate with a Bluetooth-capable Smartphone, cellphone, and/or HP Printer (we haven't bought the two phones and one printer yet).

Try many minutes per page (up to 1/2 hour!) As to your Jabra and smart phone the news is better. Most work together just fine. Bob
