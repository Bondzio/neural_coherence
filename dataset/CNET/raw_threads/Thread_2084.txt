But, I've had problems with the monitor beginning about two months before the warranty ran out. Back then, HP said it was a software problem; not they say its a hardware problem. I'm gonna' have to pay and buy another monitor. This just ain't right! Best Regards, Don Deresz

After a lengthy session with HP phone support last night, I was assured they had no record of any other owners with this black screen problem I have had three monitor replacements since August 2004 for this problem and am waiting for the 4th to arrive. Since I could see the screen but it just did not stay more than a couple seconds, out of desperation I tried this: Pushed the power button on monitor. Then pushed back on. The screen would appear (only for seconds) and I would click on menus for as long as I could see. Through this series of on/off I was able to get to control panel, system, hardware, devices. I deleted the monitor. Then pushed power button on computer to restart the computer. So far it has worked. If anyone finds out what is really causing this problem, please post. .

I spoke to HP and they basically said that there was nothing they could do about this. I paid 300 for the monitor and I can't believe this has happened
10477	6	62739	1010173	992241	stheis	3/2/05 9:17 AM	1.10975502E12	Replacement Monitor -- Same prolem	Fortunately my computer is still under warrenty because this is the fourth monitor that I have had. The first one that came with the computer did not display red. The next two had the blackout problem. This is the third replacement for the blackout problem. I received the monitor on Monday. Today the blackout started. HP is quick to send you a replacement monitor, but so many users have this problem, I wonder if they are just reconditioning the blackout monitors and sending them out as replacements. Does anyone know where the monitors are manufacturered and if a certain range of serial numbers have the same problem. Does anyone know how to tell if the replacement monitors are new or reconditioned? Has anyone tried hooking up a different monitor?

However I'll take a stab and offer up a couple things to try. I see that you have it working for now but my guess is it'll be back from all that you have described. You might try doing a visual inspection of the pin holes for your video card. I once had a pin break off and no matter what monitor I plugged in it acted flakey. After lots of hair pulling and what not I finally found the broken pin. Then it dawned on me that all the monitors I plugged into that socket probably were damaged because of the obstructed pin hole. When I checked I found that indeed I had pushed in a pin on each one I tried. Lukily I was able to pull them back into place with a pair of needle-nose pliars without damaging their opperability. If it's not some sort of physical damage to the cord or pins and your monitor is not going into sleep or suspend mode then the next thing to try is another brand. Hook up a buddies monitor and see what happens. It may just be that you are having bad luck with HP products. Personally I've only ever had good luck with HP printers and I've serviced more than a few pavillion computers. An HP is no different than any other computer with regards to what monitors will work on it. In fact it might be wise to look for a different brand of monitor should you decide to replace it all together.

You can find this by right clicking anywhere on the desktop then click on properties\settings\advanced\adapter Some monitors will protect themselves and shut down if their refresh rate is not set correctly. The reason is because incorrect refresh rate settings can actually damage the monitor. Many digital monitors will allow you to adjust refresh rates in their menu screens without even firing up the computer so try pressing your monitors menu button if it has one and look for refresh rate settings.
10477	9	62739	1017064	1010297	snut	3/4/05 6:23 PM	1.10996058E12	Monitor refresh rate	I have the same problem as everyone else here. John -- what is a good refresh rate? Mine is set at 75.
10477	10	62739	1017262	1017064	John46947	3/4/05 8:43 PM	1.10996898E12	Refreshing	The refresh rate is the number of times a display's image is repainted or refreshed per second. The refresh rate is expressed in hertz so a refresh rate of 75 means the image is refreshed 75 times in a second. The refresh rate for each display depends on the video card used. You can change the refresh rate in the display properties. However, if you change the refresh rate to a setting that the display or video card cannot support, the display goes blank or the image becomes distorted. It is wise to consult the display and video card manuals before changing the settings to determine the supported refresh rates. An older refresh rate standard, developed by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA Local Bus), was only 60 Hz. This refresh rate caused the display's image to flicker, causing eye fatigue and headaches in users. A new standard set the refresh rate to 75 Hz. It is believed that 70 Hz or higher eliminates the flicker. When purchasing a monitor, look for a refresh rate of 75 to 85 Hz.

The way it was blacking out, it looked like it was going into the screensaver mode. So I checked the screensaver setting and it was set to come on after 1000 minutes. That's about 16 hours and is just about the amount of time it was on when it used to happen to me. So I changed it to 2000 minutes and it hasn't blacked out since. (I shut my monitor and computer off at night so it's never on for 2000 minutes.) I hope this helps someone! (P.S. I always shut my monitor off when I'm not using it but the computer is on in unsuspended mode because of having DSL.)
10477	13	62739	1030917	1028783	John46947	3/9/05 8:50 PM	1.1104014E12	Screen saver or Power options?	You also could have set your screen saver to &quot;none&quot; which would produce the exact same effect. I have to wonder though what screen saver uses a black screen? Perhaps you meant the power options in the control panel? Although the monitor feature in the control panel only goes as high as 5 hours before blanking the screen. There is also a &quot;never&quot; setting in power options if you'd rather not use it. A minor addendum to the whole screen saver business when used with an LCD monitor. LCD's use a backlight that is rated to work for a certain number of hours before failing. It's always good to turn off an LCD monitor when it is not needed to conserve or rather extend the life of the backlight. I have my auto power off function set pretty low (3 mins) to ensure that I don't have it on if I'm not right there using it.

My guess is that it's not neccessarily a black screensaver, (although the one I had mine set on is mostly black, a night snow scene), but maybe a malfunction of the screensaver feature??

The power light stays blue. Some times I can turn it off and on and it will work fine for days. Other times it will go out again within seconds. While writing this it went off 5 times. I am leaving now to purchase another monitor. Costco says I have to return the whole pc or else get a replacement monitor from HP. I think I will eventually return the whole pc. Just need the monitor to work long enough to remove all my files and scrub the HD before returning it. I won't buy another HP product again. I purchased this one because I liked the AMD processor.

After extensive and expensive calls to the HP 'helpdesk' - only to discover that after one year HP want nothing more to do with you. I took things into my own hands. ONLY PROCEED TO FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS AFTER THE ONE YEAR WARRANTY IS UP AND YOU ARE READY TO TRASH YOUR TFT! Tools you'l need a small/medium philips (star) screwdriver, a small flat head screwdriver and a knive. 1. Remove all electrical connections from your TFT. 2. Using the flat head screwdriver, remove the two blue plugs just above the silver stand bracket on the rear of the screen. Remove the two brass screws 3. The screen and the stand should now be seperated. 4. Using the flat head screwdriver gently prize the silver facia away from the blue body of the TFT from the outer edge - Best place to start is at the bottom corner of the screen near the menu - + select buttons. You will hear cracking - crack is good, snap is bad. 5. When the silver facia is removed, you will see about 12 screws on the front of the screen (these hold the screen to the body) - remove these screws. 6. Carefully turn the screen face down. You will see an aluminum looking heat shield. Using the knife cut threw the metal seal. 6a. Remove the two locking nuts in the blue 15 pin D connector. 6b. Remove the two screws on each side of the heat shield. 6c Gently push the heat shield towards the bottom of the screen. 7. Now reassemble the monitor using steps 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1. This seems 'touch wood' to have solved the problem.

For a while, I was able to get it back on by repeatedly turning off and on the monitors' power button. It would work fine for about a week. I tried refresh rates, trouble shooting, and finally HP technical support. Yesterday, they said the monitor needed to be replaced. Mine just ran out of warranty (isn't that the way it goes). If the montitor wasn't $349.00 to replace, I wouldn't bother me as much, but I'm going to try my own fix. This forum has been useful and gives me different things to try. If anyone can figure out why this blackout issue is happening with the F1703 (mine was manufactured in Nov 2003), I would like to know. It's comforting to know I'm not the only one having this problem. I'll post again if I have any luck.

Now HP wanted to charge me lots of hundred dollar bills to purchase a new or reconditioned....oops! they're not making any new ones for reasons unknown!...monitor. So, I found a Sunday's paper Office Depot coupon for a $150 Microtek brand compatible monitor with a 3 YEAR WARRANTY and have lived heavenly-ever-after...except that I think HP should pay me back the 75 bucks for the bs that I had to buy for their technical support. Phooey! I ain't ever buyin' an HP product again...and I do the technical purchasing at my worksite, too! That'll hit 'em where it hurts: in the bottom line.

I first had the problem March 3, more than three weeks ago and within a few days I tried setting the screensaver to &quot;none&quot; and haven't had the problem since. (Knock wood.) A friend of mine seems to think it's a conflict between Windows screensaver and/or power options and the monitor settings. So shutting the screensaver completely off would eliminate the conflict.

I bought my computer and monitor at Sams Club 4/04 and started having the blackouts in 3/05. I would be on the computer working for a few minutes, the power button on the front of the monitor would blink twice and the monitor would go off. Nothing would turn it back on unless I unplgged the power cord, monitor cable, and shut down the whole system. Now it doesn't come on at all. I called hp tech support in mid March. The tech was so rude and condescending. He asked if it was plugged in. I explained again that it turned off while I was working. He didn't know what the problem was and after I told him that I had just downloaded the MS service pack 2, he told me that was the problem and I needed to contact MS then promptly hung up. I found out that the service pack had nothing to do with it and when I called hp back they told me that my warranty had expired 3 days previous, but I would be allowed to speak to tech for $40.00 or I could purchase the extended warranty. Today I emailed the CEO of hp and told him that he had lost my business and anyone else I could discourage from buying their product. I know it won't matter to him, but at least now I know I'm not the only one. I wonder how many others who bought theirs at Sam's Club, Costco or any other warehouse club are having the same problem?

However, the following process is involved in obtaining the replacement monitor: * We will be shipping an empty mail-in box to the address provided by you. * You need to send the defective monitor back to HP in the mail-in box sent to you. * After we receive the defective monitor, we will ship replacement monitor to you.&quot;..... You need to just contact them and they replace your monitor for free: http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/contact/email_1.html

Seems like there should be a class action lawsuit or complete refund on this one. This model definitely has a major problem. Shame on you HP! Make it right! My serial #CNCHTOP476. Manufactured November 2003 and purchased Feb of 2004.

Grommit888: It is yor HP F1703 working after what you did to it? I've fixed mayor brand PCS after changing the cooler and/or the FAN. Seem that designers sometimes get short. Original grommit888 message: I,ve had my F1703 TFT for 14 months and ges whats happened, yes its blacked out. After extensive and expensive calls to the HP 'helpdesk' - only to discover that after one year HP want nothing more to do with you. I took things into my own hands. ONLY PROCEED TO FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS AFTER THE ONE YEAR WARRANTY IS UP AND YOU ARE READY TO TRASH YOUR TFT! Tools you'l need a small/medium philips (star) screwdriver, a small flat head screwdriver and a knive. 1. Remove all electrical connections from your TFT. 2. Using the flat head screwdriver, remove the two blue plugs just above the silver stand bracket on the rear of the screen. Remove the two brass screws 3. The screen and the stand should now be seperated. 4. Using the flat head screwdriver gently prize the silver facia away from the blue body of the TFT from the outer edge - Best place to start is at the bottom corner of the screen near the menu - + select buttons. You will hear cracking - crack is good, snap is bad. 5. When the silver facia is removed, you will see about 12 screws on the front of the screen (these hold the screen to the body) - remove these screws. 6. Carefully turn the screen face down. You will see an aluminum looking heat shield. Using the knife cut threw the metal seal. 6a. Remove the two locking nuts in the blue 15 pin D connector. 6b. Remove the two screws on each side of the heat shield. 6c Gently push the heat shield towards the bottom of the screen. 7. Now reassemble the monitor using steps 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1. This seems 'touch wood' to have solved the problem. Posted by: gromit588 Posted on: 03/22/2005 3:18 PM

I am trying to contact gromit888 he postered a very insteresting and painfull fix.

I called HP and after speaking with 4 different people, I got no where. None of them even heard of a problem with a monitor. I told them to google it and they would see that many people are having this problem. HAS ANYONE FIGURED OUT SOMETHING THAT WORKED? I do not want to pay HP more money to have a technician tell me there is nothing that can be done.

I think everyone needs to do so! Because this Blackout usually happens after the warranty is up we get no help from HP. It may be time to call in a Lawyer. I think it is a real shame that one &quot;of our troops&quot; is getting this type of service from any American company.

I'm doing a favor for someone who bought two systems that came with these monitors from SAM's club. I thought I'd check a few forums before I called tech support, because the guy who owns them called, and they gave him the &quot;well if you don't have your receipt, I can't help you&quot; line. I'm going to go to SAM's club and see what I can do through them. Since they're a Walmart associate, maybe their customer service-geared business strategy will allow some headway. Now I have to read all the other postings in this thread. I'll update when\if something comes of my efforts.

Luckily, I purchased extended warranty from CircuitCity. My monitor seems to be having the same problem described above. After powering down and back up, I will be able to see the screen for about fifteen seconds. After it blacks out, however, I can still see a very dim representation of the screen. Is this the same problem everyone else is having? Anyone have any suggestions? Thanks

I accessed a great on-line chat through www.hp.com it was live and interactive (bit like MSN) and the operator correctly diagnosed the problem and talked me through putting it right. My pc is two years old but she didn't ask me about warranty or anything. It was a free service and it worked perfectly. The problem was caused by a setting on the pc which I had adjusted so not really hp's fault. I can only suggest you try this service. It was excellent.

After removing the shield, mine was OK for 3 days and 2 hours then went blank again. If yours is still OK, I'll try Gateway power supply. HP's power unit is rated DC12V. Gateway, you mentioned 19V. Maybe it just needs extra valtage.

Seems kind of funny how my problem started after the warranty expired! I am currently using a monitor from 1997,since my H P monitor will not stay on for more than 1 second. I have spent much of yesterday and today w/their online support,downloading files,1st they said it was a software issue,& downloading the file would solve it! not so.. Just about 20mins ago, they tell,o i'm sorry I cant help you further since you are out of warranty, take it to a service center. I just want to scream. Than I asked for a customer relations #, but he said he couldnt find one. What a complete waste of money.

I agree with what one person said in an earlier post, if HP is selling a product that is known to be defective, there should be some kind of relief for customers, even if the warranty is up. If HP is going to just leave us all hanging, then I too am finished with HP products. I will try to contact them and see for myself if the will help me. If not, I may do a write-up on my own website chronicling these problems.

Just plugged in with a different monitor as I have had this problem for the past week and got my f1703 working after fiddling a bit until now. My next step was to search on google and came to this thread. What a sham this is for all of us! I, as most of you, have a recently expired warranty. I do not doubt that HP knows just how long to make things last until they break. Has anyone with an expired Warranty had any luck. I, too, believe the problem lies within the power unit and the backlight not being lit. Can I buy a compatable unit from, say, radioshack?

I turned on my monitor and for the 5 sec it was on, I tapped on the power modual. The screen went black right away. Then I turned it off and back on and tapped on the power box and got the same results. So being the courious one that I am I open the box up to get a look. It is set-up the same way a amp for your car is. My amp in my truck had the same problem a few months ago with the powere going in and out. there is a small square circut attached to a long aluminum plate. I just tightened the screw, repaced the cover and it works great. I found in the past that heat will cause the soider to loosen up and tightening the screw will twist it enough to make the conection hold. It's a quick fix in a jam but, I'm going to buy a new one. I found them on HP web site for $8.75. It will probly only last a year but better than a new monitor. Good luck and thanks for the help, Tra1969 PS I e-mailed the HP exec's complaining about the problem buuuuut I didn't tell them I fixed it

I discussed in length with HP 5/18/05 and was told they would not replace my monitor because it was not under warranty. Please be advised that this customer service reprentative for HP was following up from my response to HP CEO. Also, keep in mind that I had already had three support message to HP support before I found this website and responded to the HP Board of Directors. They said they were not aware of this blackout issue and could not replace my monitor. I suggested they check out CNET website and become aware of this issue. This support person said they only acknowledge their HP website and their website did not show any such complaints on this f1703 monitor. I ended my discussion that I would go back to Dell since they do stand behind their product. I have a four year old Dell laptop that has never given me trouble. I work for a large company in IT and purchase PCs on a regular basis. A couple of months ago, Dell alerted their customers of a faulty power adaptor with one of their laptops. They were immediately replaced. It is sad to know HP would not even acknowledge this issue. bucaramanga would you please advise where you learned that HP was going to replace even if warrranty has expired. I will again contact HP once I know where you received this information. Keep in mind I discussed the issue on 5/18/05 with HP and you responded on 5/19/05 - Just curious....has HP had a change of heart?

The lamp life must be pretty short if that is the case my was only 5 months old. Sometimes when I would turn the mointor back on if the screen suddenly got a little brighter it would stay on for awhile. If it got a little dimmer it would go black in about 5 seconds.

Their manual said &quot;life of backlight is about 25,000 to 30,000 hours&quot;. Even you kept it on for 5 months (that is if it doesn't blackout), it'll be only 3,700 hours. Don't bother with them. You just get angrier everytime you do. I spent over the last 3 weeks and finally leant. Just replace the power supply (not from HP), one for Laptop seems to be a good one. That'll let you keep going, then never to buy HP crap.

They haven't bother to reply. Tech support, I just got auto replay &quot;Thank you .... some one will contact you within one business day&quot;. That was several weeks ago. Their business day must be very very long or they never work. You are right, just swith to Dell. I will. If you want to get F1703 working again before you get Dell, just replace the power supply. I used the one for Toshiba laptop. My kind been playing games non-stop during the weekend and still OK.

Previous Reply Follows: ------------------------- Dear Lynda, Thank you for contacting HP Total Care. I understand from your e-mail that your HP Pavilion f1703 Monitor is not coming up. I gather that the light on the monitor flashes for the second and it goes off. I see that you have tested the monitor on other computers and have concluded that it is the issue with monitor / adapter. I greatly appreciate that you have forwarded your concerns and that you have given me a chance to assist you with this matter. &gt;From your email, there seems to be an issue with the monitor. Therefore, to narrow downs the domain of issue, please follow the steps given below: === Run Monitor Self-test === To test the monitor separately from the computer, turn off the monitor and the computer, then disconnect the video signal data cable from the computer. Verify that the monitor still has power to it. Press and hold the power button for approximately 10 seconds. A self-test screen appears if the monitor is functioning correctly. === Connect monitor to different power outlet === I recommend that you connect the monitor alone (without the computer) to some other power outlet and check for the display. See if the screen is displayed fine or not. If monitor goes off after some time, it indicates that it is the issue with the monitor. I also request you to provide us with the following information to verify the warranty of your monitor, so we may replace the monitor (If required) Monitor Information: * Monitor Model Number (ex: C1234A): * Monitor Serial Number (ex: US12345678): * Monitor Purchase Date: Shipping Information: * Name: * Organization: * Mailing Address (No P.O. Boxes): * Apartment/Building/Mailstop: * City: * State/Province: * Zip/Postal Code: * Country: * Phone Number (including area code): Please visit the following web site to locate the model number and the serial number the monitor. http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&lang=en&cc=us&product= 324213&dlc=en&docname=c00061531 NOTE: Clicking the link may give an error indicating it is invalid.

And watch the green light untill it goes completely out!!! 2. using a small screwdriver pry the power supply box open at the seem. 3. in one corner ther will be a small square chip(power regulator) with a screw above it and it will be screwed to the long piece of alumiumn (heat sink). At the bottom of the chip there will be three spades running to the circut board. 4. All you need to do is loosen the screw and retighen it. 5. put the cover back on and use a little tape to hold it togther and try it. Heating and cooling of the power pack will cause the power regulator to build a film inbetween the chip and the heatsink. this will cause the power regulator to fluxuate and your screen will go black. One way to test it before you tear into the power pack is to start your monitor and tap on the power supply box and the screen should go black right away. It won't even take the 5 sec it normailly does. This fixed mine. I'm going to buy a new one as soon as I can but it work great now.

I switched out the monitor and have had it on for three days now. Seems to be OK?? I don't care if they want to keep replacing the monitor if it keeps going out as long as it is still under warranty. Thought this might help some of the people changing the power supply and still having problems.

The monitor has the same black out problems as everyone else, but the built in speaker amplifier still works. Does anyone elses speakers work (assuming the same set up as mine) when their bad power packs blanked their screens out? As I have power to the speakers could my problem be in the monitor? Could it be I have sufficient current for the speakers but the monitor shuts down as it is more sensitive to voltage fluctuations? As we are on 230 volts down here, my power pack will have a different transformer & perhaps other different parts. The tra1969 fix (adjusting the screw to the heat sink) hasn't worked for me. Any other suggestions?

I have had the same blackout issue as everyone else has on the F1703, it took me a couple of weeks of phone calls both to HP and my retailer (COMET)&gt; I eventually managed to get HP to agree to replace the Monitor free of charge. I told them that there was signifcant evidence of worldwide problems with the F1703, and that the unit was not of merchantable quality, fit for the purpose intended and certainly not a quality product which HP should claim to be proud of. HP replaced only the screen and not the power adapter or speakers, but it works fine on the old power unit. My old screen started blackouts just before the 1 year warrenty which I did not report to HP, it happened twice but always came back ok and stayed on. Since the warrenty expired it happened more frequently until I reached the 5 second stay on duration, useless ! Surprisingly, HP on my 8th call told me not to worry, even though it was out of warrenty they would send me a replacement, it was hard to believe! - two weeks later its here, it looks brand new and works fine (although this is only day 2) The number I call in the UK was 08700 104 320 and I spoke to Paulo. I hope this might help anyone else who is suffering with HP refusing to look after their customers, I've been lucky but HP still have a problem. Good luck !!!

I repaired my monitor using gromit588's disassembly instructions, a little closer inspection and a soldering iron. I have a description and a few photos here: http://home.pacbell.net/cmonte/monitor/f1703.htm
10477	101	62739	1214936	1214243	wffarrell	5/29/05 8:56 AM	1.11735696E12	Yes! This works!	First the good news. I found TWO bad solder joints on the backlight board, but both of them were pins on the COILS. Could it be a heat problem that's cracking the joints? Looking with a magnifying glass I could see a definite crack around the pin through the solder. I used a solder sucker to remove the old stuff and resoldered the joints. It's a delicate operation because other tracks are so close. I used an iron with a very fine tip and 22-gauge solder. Finally, I plugged in my monitor and the test screen came on and stayed on! Now, the bad news. Sorta bad. Just yesterday afternoon, after spending nearly all day researching the f1703 problem and trying all the solutions recommended, I gave up, went down to CompUSA and bought a 17&quot; Viewsonic. Well, now I have a spare because who knows what will happen next. Kudos and many thanks to Lewong!

I did all that disassembling/assembling a few times but didn't check the soldering. I'll keep your info just in case. Now here is a typical HP response I get after I told them that F1703 had a serious problem and HP should look at CNET Forums. Never buy HP again !!! (PS Did you noticed that Pavilion now comes with Compac monitor) ================================================= Dear XXXXX, First of all, I apologize for the delayed response. In continuation with the previous correspondence regarding black screen issue with the Monitor. XXXXX, I would like to share with you that the warranty of the monitor valid only with the PC.

IF YOU CAN NOT RESOLDER THEM PROPERLY TAKE THEM OUT AND CLEAN THEIR PINS. SOLDER THEM BACK. Reassemble the monitor and it will work fine!!!

The good news is that 99% is an easy fix by resoldering ALL FOUR COILS TERMINALS FROM POWER/INVERTER BOARD. This is also a fix for monitor powering down by itself. If you want to do a great job just take the coils out, clean the terminals with a knife and than solder them back. If you doing a good quality solder job you will never have this problem again!

Which is odd...because if it truly is a hardware problem, why would deleting the driver fix our monitors temporarily? Unless we both were lucky and Mr. Coincidence happened to stop in at the darkest hour.

Just think, we could be calling tech support in America, where calls would be notibly cheaper (maybe 10 bucks instead of 45 bucks an hour) and we could talk to somebody who speaks fluent English and can think in our level. That way our calls wouldn't be taken up with 'could you repeat the question' or such. Thats just my thought.

We had a house fire about 14 months ago we lost everything thing that we owned. This computor is the one that we got to replace the one that we lost. And its it crap to try to get back the things you lost, and it only lasts 12 month. Yep 2 months past its warranty it doesn't even work. I guess their products only last for the warranty only. I want my name on the list too, Please contact me at harlebabelvtride@hotmail.com I know I want buy another product from them.

I carefully disassembled the front panel from the rear housing (push in toward the center of the screen on the back housing to release the front fascia panel). You must then remove several screws to pull out the display to gain access to the heat/rf shield for removal. Don't forget to remove the two screws from the video connector housing. Remove five-(5) more screws & two outboard connectors on the backlight board & remove the board. Carefully solder all suspect connections, particularly all associated with the COILS! - Reassemble & test. Mine worked! Pete

Please visit our Owner Services Web site for details on keeping your HP and Compaq products up and running. http://www.hp.com/home/ownerservices Sincerely, Kabeer HP Total Care ================================= Vanessa, Thank you for your reply. Even though the warranty is up (and it is barely up for many people with this problem) HP should do the right thing and offer some recourse or help with this problem. As I said in my first contact, there is significant evidence of worldwide problems with the F1703, and as a result HP was selling a product that is not of merchantable quality. I am sure HP is aware of this. If HP were to do something to make it right, it would strengthen the integrity of HP and I know I would continue to believe that HP is a brand I can trust for the future. If HP is just going to cop out and leave everyone with this monitor hanging, they may be losing many customers. Furthermore I may do a write-up on my own weblog chronicling these problems and the obstacles others are running into. I may also try to contact sites like engadget.com, amazon.com, cnet.com, gizmodo.com and consumer reports that review and report news on technology products, to further spread the word. I'm respectfully asking again, please provide some remedy for this problem. I'd like to continue to think HP products are great products to buy. If you can't help me, is there someone in HP management that might be able to? Sincerely, Customer ================================ Dear customer, Thank you for contacting HP Total Care. After reviewing your e-mail, I understand that you have an HP Pavilion F1703 monitor and it is blacking out. I also see that the monitor is a couple of months out of warranty and you wish to get the monitor replaced. I understand your concern in this regard and sincerely regret to tell you that if the monitor is out of warranty, we would not be able to replace it. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused and understand how frustrated you must be feeling. Had I been in your place, I too would have felt the same. However, I hope you will understand our limitation in this regard as our tools do not permit us to ship or replace parts if the PC or monitor is out of warranty. Feel free to write back to us in case you have any further concern(s). We will be happy to assist you further. Sincerely, Vanessa HP Total Care ===================== Dear HP, This contact is related to the HP F1703 monitor, not the F2105. (I could not find any path to contact HP for the F1703, so I chose the F2105) I have an HP F1703 monitor that I am having problems with the monitor blackouting out and I would like to have this problem fixed. The monitor is a couple of months out of warranty but I would still like to have this problem addressed by HP. The reason I am making this request is there is signifcant evidence of worldwide problems with the F1703, and as a result I don't believe the unit was of merchantable quality when I bought it. There are thousands pf people discussing this all over the internet. Please let me know how HP can fix the problem I am having with this monitor.

Like many others here, my monitor is out of warranty. I don't want to buy another monitor until I've exhausted all repair possibilities. While, this solution seems to have worked for you, I don't feel qualified to open my computer and do it myself (I might make it worse). Can anyone out there steer me in the right direction ( like can I take it to a local repair shop or Comp Usa eic.) or a least post detailed instructions of how you went about fixing the blackout problem? I am a computer idiot, I need specific details included the materials/tools that are needed.

My own call to HP's nearly-useless technical support resulted in an unpublished snailmail address to which I could write -- a PO box in Boise, Idaho. They still wouldn't provide the confidential email address even after I pressed my case hard. For what it's worth, that address is: Complaint Letters Hewlett Packard Corp. PO Box 15, MS 516 Boise ID 83707 Note: MS 516 probably stands for mailstop 516. This is obviously a case of an inferior manufacturing run that a large, nay arrogant, company doesn't seem to care about. I doubt they have an answer other than the costly one (replacing their junk for free). Many thanks to the two gents who posted technical solutions involving the coils on the backlight inverter board. That looks like my only option as well. HP should be hurt by this if they will not surrender. A class-action lawsuit could win here. They are simply in the wrong. By the way, if you're a new reader, sorry to inform you that you are yet another one of the hundreds or thousands of victims of the Edsel of flat-panel monitors. Let's hope something good happens.

When I dropped it off, the receptionist for their repair contractor said &quot;oh, it's the same as mine & mine stopped working last week.&quot; It was also 14 months old. I told her to tell her technicians to check the solder joints on the back light circuit board. I now have my repaired monitor back and it is working fine.

My 12 month Warranty period expired last month and I got exactly the same screen blackout defect. However, I used the net to find a fix. The real truth is that there is unlikely to be a problem with your backlight ( though dont expect Hewlett Packard to come clean about this, as they will be only too pleased to charge you for a replacement ccrt and of course forget to mention this manufacturing defect). The culprit is one or more dry solder joints on the inverter board. To be more precise, there are four coils on the circuit board and you need to just re-solder these. Get someone experienced to do it for you if you are not adept with a soldering iron. My monitor is now working again and I did not have to fork out another pile of cash to Hewlett Packard who refuse to recognise a manufacturing defect outside of their Warranty period. I am not impressed with HP who should re-call all of the F1073 models for a free repair regardless of warranty status. There is no excuse for shoddy workmanship, and I will not be purchasing any HP product again as a result of their attitude.

Thanks to all to shared in this discussion with your ideas. I took it apart and also found a coil which needed to be re-soldered. Its now back up and working fine...for who knows how long. I also sent a message to the HP board of directors which will likely be ignored. No problem...just add me to the list of new Dell users.

With the number of people reporting similar problems on here HP obviously has a manufacturing or design defect. They should be dealing with this problem. SHAME ON HP!

About a month after I fussed with Hp I called Sam's and talked to them. They where going to replace the monitor but did not have another one in stock. But the managaer called the head office and they told the manager to call hp. Sam's talked to the retail at Hp. They got in contact with me and they sent me another one. It is a refurbished one but at least I got something done about it. I hope it lasts, it has a 3 month warranty on it and belive me I am going to keep my eye on it for the 3months. ( any thing happens I going to call them ). So maybe you can call Sam's and talk to them, they where really great with me, I could not have ask for better people. They where even talking like if they could not get Hp to do something they where going to just swap out the whole computor for me. So give it a try!!! I bought mine in March 2004 and the warranty ran out April 2005 Pam

I can honestly tell you it taught me a new king of frustration... I called HP technical support and all they could tell me that my monitor was &quot;bad&quot; and my warantee had expired 17 days prior to the call. They then offered to sell me a new monitor for $320.00. I was pissed. I several copies of a fax including my all my purchase information and a strongly (but formally) worded letter. I got an email telling me they were sorry but the order number on my recipet did not match the product number of the monitor. That's because the monitor and the computer came as a package! Duh! I sent another strongly worded email to HP's c.e.o Mark Hurd through their website. The next day, I got an email and suprisingly a call only hours later. They apologized for the inconvenience and sent me a new monitor for free. All they asked was that I send back the faulty monitor; they even included shipping stamps for that as well. All you can do is wear them down, let 'em know you're pissed.

But it wasn't as bad as it was now. It would turn off every minute compared to every second. Anyways, I called HP tech support and at that point it was still in warranty, so they sent him a replacement monitor, yet it was the same model. Around the time the replacement came, I had some major personal problems that kept me out of town for about 5 months. I did manage to come back for Christmas, and the monitor worked for a little while, but then the same problem. Anyways, I stayed out of town till April of this year, when I decided to move. The new replacement monitor had gone bad as well. Now that I'm fully moved to my new place, I want to get this monitor fixed, yet it is out of waranty now. Anyways, I'm currious if everyone's replacement (that got the replacenent) was the same model and if they have gone bad as well?

I bought a new power supply for HP and it didn't help. I went to get help from an electronics grad. He told me that HP could have put a lower end power supply on thier units and when the monitor breaks in the resistance of the board grows. if the monitor goes past the power input it needs it goes blank. He told me to increase the volts till the unit work. I used a 15v--2A power supply and it work again. I keep sending HP nasty grams with no reply. They really suck!!!!

I told him that I was disappointed by HP's shoddy quality control (regarding the poorly soldered coils) and the fact that they're not doing anything about it. Monday morning, I get a call from HP quality control/customer service. Tuesday morning I have a new monitor. I do have to send the old one back (shipping is free) so they can refurbish it for someone else. My advice.... Screw talking to HP's tech people and send a rational letter to the CEO. Oh, by the way, my monitor was no longer under warranty.

I wrote to HP's CEO (using the link on HP's Web site). I told him about my monitor problem. (mine had the bad solder on coils, so the backlight was going out.) I said I was disappointed in HP because lots of consumers had the same problem and HP was doing nothing to help. I said I'd not buy HP or Compaq again. This was Friday. Monday I got a call from HP. Tuesday I had a new monitor. The only thing I have to do is send the old one back. No charge for anything. Hope it helps!

I tried everything to try to fix my monitor....power supply, different computer, different drivers, different video cards, etc. I finally read on here that it could be an issue with the backlight (and knew that was my problem because I could faintly see the items on the screen when it was dark), probably caused by bad soldering on the coils inside the monitor. My husband was going to open it up and see if he could fix the soldering. But, I first I wrote an e-mail to HP's CEO, using the link on HP's site. I told him about the problem and the fact that many many others had posted similar issues online. I said I'd never buy HP again and was dissappointed in HP's quality control and their refusal to fix the problem. Well, Monday I got a call from HP and figured it was some dumb tech person. But no, a nice lady from customer service who wanted to replace my monitor, despite the fact that it was out of warranty. Tuesday morning I had a new monitor. (I think it may be a refurbished monitor actually, but it works, so who cares?) The only thing I have to do is send my old monitor back so they can fix it for someone else. The customer service lady did say there was a recall, but she might not have been told to anbd was simply trying to explain to me why now they were giving me a new monitor. My advice to anyone who has a bad monitor.... Write to the CEO in a clear, legible e-mail explaining your problem, the fact that your problem is not isolated and the fact that you feel betrayed by HP. I've tried to find my exact letter, but I apparently didn't save a copy. Sorry! But hope someone else can get the same reaction from HP!

The URL is a contact URL for providing feedback to HP exec mgmt. It is featured in one of the many posts here. I got two phone calls and three emails from HP about it. They immediately provided me a postage-paid Fedex box for the monitor. I put just the monitor itself in this box (it fit perfectly) and a week later, I got a replacement unit which I am now using. This unit is working very well. So, if you haven't yet tried the solder-it-yourself solution and are still hopeful HP might respond, go that route. They said they are very, very aware how lousy this f1703 manufacturing run was and it is now a ''known problem'' which means warranty be hanged, if you bought one that doesn't work, let them know and they'll work with you. I got very courteous treatment and I must tell you I was pleasently surprised. Thanks to this group for that URL and thanks to the HP folks who did respond. One last thing: don't waste time with the trained monkeys on the phone-in support line. They're clueless and you're just wasting oxygen on them. Try the URL-based email route, writing directly to the exec mgmt team based in Boise, Idaho. Or call HP's 1-800 number and ask for Michael Brown in the Boise, Idaho office. They took care of everything, even dropping off the postage-paid Fedex box.

It was suggested that resoldering the inductors on the power board, of which there are 8 would help, it did, very successfully, the whole procedure should take less than 1 hour. Remove the stand from the screen 2 screw. Unclip the silver front surround, the buttons will come with it, you need to be quite physical but careful not to crack the plastic. Remove the self tappers that hold the lcd panel and the screws that hold the small power switch board, unplug the power switch board from the other small board, the lcd panel can now be lifted from the plastic case. Remove the 2 screw locks on the vga connector and the 3 self tappers and metal tape that hold the chrome board cover, remove this cover. The power board can be removed by pulling off the 4 white connectors, note the positions, undo the 4 self tappers and unplug the power board from the logic board. The inductors are the small coils of wire with a a yellow casing, have 2 legs, resolder all 8 inductive devices, you can solder suck or braid off the old solder if you are keen or just resolder all the legs of these device. Probably in the manufacturing process the enamel on the legs was not properly remove/burnt off, causing eventual failure. Once this is done you can reassemble up to replacing the chrome cover and then test to see if you have cured the problem. If you can't handle this keep this info for someone with some repair experience, it would be generous if HP would offer to do the repair if you covered the postage as it is there dropoff.

The repair will take less than an hour requires a crosshead screwdriver and a soldering iron.

I followed his instructions and its solved the problem. I must say dismantling the monitor took a little thought though. Anyone else doing this job ...the from facer pops of the rear body of the monitor to expose the LCD screen which can then be removed to gain access to the cover of the power inverter. A good point to start removing the front is via the ventilation holes on the top and bottom. There are small retaining lugs which you can lever with a small screw driver. Thanks Kenzoman !!

Same problem as everyone else - blacks out and the only solution is to unplug and replug - which is a very short term fix as it soon happens again. I did the same thing - went to the HP website and sent an email to the CEO. Like you, I'm sure it won't make a difference, but I will NEVER EVER buy an HP product again.

The blackout problem started on mine a couple of months ago (after I had the computer for about 14 months). It would happen just a few times, and the fix seemed to be to unplug the power from the adapter, wait a minute, plug back in, and it would be ok for quite awhile. This past week, however, it happens A LOT and now I am not sure if it is the adapter or not. I actually called HP today to order a new adapter and was quoted a price of $155.95!! I told the lady at HP no way - that is way too much, and she actually was the one to suggest I google the part number to try to find the adapter somewhere else. Well, that is how I found this forum. I also purchased my system from Sam's Club. I did find an adapter for $15.00 - but have seen the other suggestions to fix this as well. Not sure what to do now - any suggestions would be appreciated! Thanks!

When the problems with this monitor were getting worse, I looked up the part #, etc. for the ac adapter, on the HP website and it was listed at $8.95 -LESS THAN SEVEN DAYS AGO. You can imagine my surprise at the quote of $155.95 I got from HP parts today! Hello ??!! And I know for a fact that I am not imagining this - my 18 year old son (that knows more about this stuff than I do!) happened to look this up for me on the HP website around the same time on the HP parts store himself and called me at work to tell me the part was only $8.95. Well, that is Ok, I thought at the time! Until today - what a profit mark-up! They must be making some big $$$ off of this one! They obviously know what's up. Ok, not that the ac adapter is even the real problem to begin with, then what is it? Oh yeah... I will surely look into that class action. I apologize in advance at my temper about all of this, as I have just discovered details about HP and the whole issue today - I am typing my thoughts quickly, before my monitor will go out again ..

In the e-mail, I explained the problem with the back light and that it is a global event not just me. When I finished I figured that this would be just deleted and I wouldn't hear from HP at all. Today at work I checked my e-mail and found a reply that said thank you for my e-mail from HP. Well that wasn't to bad at least I got to say to HP what I felt. My wife at the supper table told me that HP called and would like to talk to me.... They requested my serial number and said a replacement monitor will be sent out and should arrive by Thursday 6/30. This monitor has been updated and should have a &quot;normal life span&quot; said the HP representative. So before opening it up, write to HP's CEO http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/execteam/email/hurd/index.html

Sue.....I don't know if you saw my posting in the list but I think you will find the problem that everyone is experiencing is with the voltage inverter board contained in the monitor itself. The board has 4 large inductance coils each of which are soldered at two points on the circuit board. The solder that has been applied during manufacture is insufficient and as a result of heating and cooling over many uses, the solder stresses causing discontinuity. Some people are trying different power packs which if the voltage is higher will bridge the poor solder for a while. I had the problem everyone is experiencing and resoldered the coils ...

I wonder if there's a general heat problem caused by the coils to begin with that's causing the problem? All 8 connections &quot;appeared&quot; to be shiny with no cold solder joints.

AND NOW I HAVE A TOTALLY WORKING FLAT SCREEN! THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH!

10477	173	62739	1306838	1303133	rclaunch	7/19/05 8:40 AM	1.1217624E12	The REAL Problem	I was unaware of the HP monitor probelm until today. After reviewing the posts in this forum I thought I would add my 2 cents. The root problem appear to be the high voltage backlight inductors. The users need to understand &quot;HOW THINGS WORK&quot;! The LCD panel displays the image but the image cannot be seen unless the back light panel provides illumination from the rear of the LCD panel (simplified explanation). The back light controller unit takes the low voltage of the power supply (12 volts?) and increases it through the inductors to a much higher voltage (100+) and a higher frequency (60-400Hz). As a result these parts get HOT!. The backlight of an LCD monitor is ON all the time, even when your screen saver is activated. Only when the monitor is in STANDBY or OFF is the back light shut off. A bouncing Windows XP logo as your screen saver appears on a black background. What you may not realize is that the black portion of the screen is not the result of a turned off backlight, but instead is the result of polarized liquid crystal elements PREVENTING the backlight from being seen by you! Screen savers look pretty, but are useless for LCD monitors. Screen savers were designed to prevent TUBE-based monitors from burning images on the screen. LCDs are completely different. They operate on the principal of crystal elements polarizing light. This light comes mainly from the back light panel. If you see something on an LCD screen, it means the backlight is ON. Backlight panels do have a limited life. Anywhere from 40,000 to 100,000 hours. You could leave your monitor on for about 5 years and just begin to exceed the 40,000 hour figure. As a rule, I use a large UPS and NEVER turn off either the computer or the monitor. I use the screen saver just as an indicator that the PC is on. The monitors on my system (NEC 21&quot;) are 8 years old and still look factory fresh. The posts on opening the monitors and resoldering the legs of the inductors sounds like the solution. It would appear that either the manufacturing process did not wet enough solder on these legs, OR the circuit board was improperly designed and the solder pads of the board are not large enough. Over time the legs of these parts go through cycles of hot and cold causing the solder joints to crack. A word to those who have received replacment monitors: If the problem is the size of the solder pads on the back light board, get ready for a repeat in 10-14 months. For all you budding technicians: be careful when you solder the inductor legs not to flow solder across the joints. The inductors will cause a spectacularly catastrophic failure if they are shorted and power is applied. Always put the monitor BACK TOGETHER BEFORE POWERING ON!! For those purchasing new power packs: yes it will help, but only for so long. The additional voltage and current allow the unit to bridge the solder cracks, but eventually they will get wide enough to stop working. For those messing with drivers and screen savers: if the monitor shuts off when booted to DOS or you PC's setup screen, leave your Windows setup alone! Check the monitor on another computer, you won't hurt the computer. I am sure that some of the problems users have had were in fact incompatible drivers, bad power packs, bad cables and so on. BUT there does appear to be a distinct design/manufacturing flaw in the HP LCD. They do need to step up to the plate and take care of their #1 source of revenue, THE CUSTOMER. 25 years of electronic circuit and system design, including LCD monitors and touch screen!

Their response &quot;Give us $40 bucks and we will tell you&quot; Oh my god...I paid almost $3000 for this thing and all I want, is my monitor to work!!! I had to hook up a 12 yr old monitor to my pc to email you about this problem. 12 year old monitor vs 1 1/2 year old monitor. Give me a break!!! My old HP pc was great to me, so I decided to get another one 2 yrs ago, but I have to tell you I am not impressed with my current HP monitor, not at all. I take great care in my belongings as I have for my computers, but I feel this product is very inferior with the craftmanship, quality and customer service.

My son's f1703 started a &quot;power save&quot; problem yesterday. As soon as the monitor is turned on, it goes into power save mode. This happens whether the computer is turned on or off. The monitor does not respond to any of the menu buttons. It is not even possible to enter the monitor menu when the monitor is not connected to the computer. At that point, it merely states to check the cable. Is this the same problem or a different manifestation of the blackout problem? Naturally, my son heads back to school in 1 week which means the HP turnaround swap (if his monitor applies) won't cut it. Thanks

To all: My wife just called HP about her 1703 going black and was informed they will send her a free new monitor, same model, but the 2005 model. Hers is a 2004. She was told the 2005 has fixed the old problem. This is a quiet process on behalf of HP. They are only replacing the monitors on people who call to complain about it (must be recent since they WEREN'T doing anything about it before). They will replace the model years from September 2003 to October 2004. Hopefully you fall within this parameter. My wife was asked for the date of manufacture and revision #. The number she called was 800-474-6836. She obtained a representative that ran her through the moronic steps of checking the AC power cord, questions of why didn't you report it under warranty (because it happened one month &quot;after&quot; warranty expired which is typical for this monitor) then informed her of what she already knew, essentially no warranty, not much she could do. At this point my wife exhibited some irritation and the rep passed her on to tech support for monitors. To circumvent what she went through you may just want to request tech support for monitors. Have all your information ready. Good luck.

It took less than 30 minutes total to take it apart, solder, and put back together. The only difference is there are only 3 wire coils on the f1503, so you have only 6 pins to resolder. I just retouched the existing solders. Thanks so much. HP totally blew me off because I was 2 months out of the 1 year warranty. If I would of known it only took 30 minutes, I would have saved the 1 hour phone call to HP. Thanks!

My 1703 monitor was out of warranty when it started blacking out. The same problem as everyone else in this forum. After reading this post, I went to hp's website and e-mailed their CEO. I didn't ''yell'' at him in the letter, or use offensive language. I stated the problem, and the fact that there are obviously numerous other people with the same problem, and provided him with all the information he would need. My name, address, phone number (that's how they contacted me), email address, model#, serial#, ref#, product# and rev#. I also told them that I have recmoneded hp products to friends, family, co-workers, and other contacts, and would hate to have to buy a dell monitor and start recomending them. Even though I included that, no harsh language was used. Within hours a case manager called me. He was nice, and very compentent. A new monitor has been sent via fedex and will arrive in two days with shipping labels to return the defective one at no charge. I will confirm this in a seperate post when it arrives. My product was six months out of warranty, which I was honest about, and hp didn't care at all. So, in my opinion, this is the best fix to the problem out there.

Waited until I had seconds of viewing ability followed by blackout-4 days after the warranty expired. I'm guessing it's the same issue as the F1703.

I had the problem with my monitor over the past few days and decided to change the power supply. I purchased a simple variable AC adapter from Radio Parts and presto it's rock solid. No more dropping out or anything like that anymore the monitor is as it once was, perfect!! You can grizzle all you like but the fix is rather simple and quite inexpensive ( under $20.00) Change your power supply! The original unit's supply must have heat stress issues after about 12 months causing it to drop down in voltage and so the monitor dims out (Black Out) due to the drop in power.

But when I got it, it was refurbished and had a dead pixel in the lower left hand corner of the screen. I contacted HP and they said they could not return it because it only has 1 bad pixel. Does this make any sense???? HP has a bad moniter and they send it out anyway? HP said it's againt industry standards to send out another moniter. I am still shocked and confused. Any insight to this matter?

I called HP customer support then, and with the help of the opperator, I was able to have the screen reappear. But then it occurred again, and then again a third time. this last time I have not been able to fix it, so finding this topic was a great relief. After reading the hp page confirming the problem, I tried contacting the local NY, NY service centers to take my monitor in for repair. These are Best Buy and Micro Comp. Micro does not repair Hp Monitors, and Best Buy had no idea what I was referring to. The Geek I spoke with asked me to print out a copy of the HP page and call corporate, then bring it in as proof. I called Best Buy corporate customer help and they told me to call HP. I was fed up and called another local Best Buy and asked how much a repair would cost me. Before giving a price he said it would take two weeks if I agreed to the cost of the work. (They ship it to a service center). I should have just went straight to HP. I called them and after explaining the problem to the Customer Service Assistant, who could see that I had reported this same thing before, the CSA ordered a replacement monitor for me, which should have a recent manufacture date with the 'fix' they supposedly made. It arrives in a few days, and although I am frustrated with HP for taking so long to admit they had a problem with these monitors and issue a recall, at least they are addressing it now. I'll have to think twice if I consider another HP product, but I won't refuse to buy from them, unlike EA games and Battlefield 2.

It is overly optimistic to say that H-P will repair or replace my 1703 free of charge regardless of my location. First of all, your link to H-P's info on this action clearly states that such a decision depends on the service options available at my location. I am in Germany and when I contacted H-P here, they were polite and sympathetic but essentially told me that since the monitor is sold and serviced only in Switzerland, it was incumbent on me to get my monitor to a Swiss address. H-P would then pick it up, repair it, and return it to that Swiss address where I would have to pick it up (all at my own expense, since the monitor was sold with a 12-month only warranty) and that they didn't think I would be stupid enough to want to invest that sort of time and money in it. They're right, of course. I had a local repair shop look at the unit along with the postings on this thread (the technicians there are fluent in English) and they advised me (I translate here): ''This monitor was junk the day it left the factory.'' This assessment was made because when they opened it up they found the connections were not soldered but made with some sort of putty/paste. They were not surprised that H-P claimed only a 1-year warranty, saying if they had manufactured it, they wouldn't even be that daring. They soldered the connections that H-P had stuck together with putty, but the unit still goes to black intermittently as it did before the repair. My guess is the power supply is faulty and should be replaced. I passed this information (and my displeasure) along to Mark Hurd, CEO of H-P, and got a quick reply that they would look into my case. This was two weeks ago and I promisied myself I would be patient. At least they responded . . .

Called HP and they wanted me to spend $45 for tech support because I had a software issue. (WRONG!) I called again through their Calif. office and actually got to speak to an English speaking American. He was a SENIOR case manager. (Big Whoop). My monitor has the same serial #, the same manufacturing # and the same problem as the F1703, but they won't do anything for me. To add insult to injury, the case manager offered to upgrade me from the 1503 to the 1703 for $125. This is a refurbished monitor with a 90 day warranty. Now why in the world would I want to upgrade to the F1703 which is having more problems than the 1503? Do they think I am stupid or what? They are just trying to pawn off all their 1703's that have been sent back!

10477	221	62739	1677562	744233	vb_lvr	1/17/06 4:00 PM	1.1375136E12	HP F1703 LCD monitor not working	I too had my monitor go black today (Jan 17,2006). The blue light power switch stays on(monitor getting signal,orange would indicate sleep mode), but the screen goes black after just a few seconds. Pushing the power button off then back on would give me a display for 2-4 seconds then go black again. Taking a strong flashlight to the screen would show that the LCD display itself was working. So it became a backlight issue, and i Googled for that. Visiting the HP site, shows that my monitor is not covered by the extended warranty for the F1703 monitor(my manufacturer date was July 2003). The reason this problem didn't surface earlier was because my computer was in storage for 1 year. I suspected a power supply problem from the onset since the problem became increasing worse over the last 3 days, until finally it would only stay on for 2-4 seconds at a time. Visiting the Cnet forum indicated a manufacturing defect. The following web page shows detailed pictures of my exact problem, which is called a cold solder joint. http://home.pacbell.net/cmonte/monitor/f1703.htm If a solder joint isn't soldered properly to begin with, over time the solder crystalizes due to heating and cooling cycles of the joint. In this case, maybe the enamel coating wasn't removed from the coil sufficiently, causing improper solder wicking. In time, resistance begins to builds up, causing even more heat to be present at the joint, causing further increased crystalization and electrical resistance(a snowballing, avalanche effect). Repair takes about half an hour. The tricky part is separating the back half of the monitor from the front silver bezel. The following disassembly instructions were taken from another post with additional comments added and/or modified as the post left no resolution. http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7590-0.html?forumID=67&threadID=62739&messageID=1063810 Tools needed: a #2 philips screwdriver, 1/8&quot; round shaft jeweler type small flat head screwdriver and a 1-1/2&quot; spackling putty knive(all from Home Depot). 15w soldering iron, solder sucker, 60/40, 20 gauge(.031 dia) solder(all from Radio Shack). Never use a high wattage soldering iron or heavier gauge solder on a printed circuit board, or you will be buying a new monitor! 1. Remove all electrical connections from your TFT. 2. Using the 1/8&quot; flat head screwdriver, remove the two blue plugs just above the silver stand bracket on the rear of the screen, by sliding the sharp screwdriver down along the outside edge of the plug and prying upward. Remove the two brass screws 3. The screen and the stand should now be seperated. 4. Using the putty knife gently pry the silver bezel away from the blue body of the monitor from the outer edge - Best place to start is at the bottom corner of the screen near the menu - + select buttons. You may hear slight cracking - crack is good, snap is bad. Work with the putty knife from the back side of the monitor, being extremely careful and gentle. Work in a well lighted room with a non slip-pad on the table to protect the screen. Best results are obtained by holding the monitor on edge, sliding the knife in between the bezel and case and prying downward toward the center of the monitor. Work in one direction from the menu button corner and along the bottom, then up the side, accross the top, and back down the side. Separating the bezel was not easy but once a technique was established, it became easier. 5. When the silver facia is removed, you will see about 12 screws on the front of the screen (these hold the screen to the body) - remove these screws. 6. Carefully turn the screen face down. You will see an aluminum looking heat shield. Using the knife cut threw the 2 metal tape seals. 6a. Remove the two locking spacer nuts on the blue 15 pin D connector. 6b. Remove the two screws on each side of the heat shield. 6c Gently push the heat shield towards the bottom of the screen to free it from the tabs. Remove the 4 screws from the FL backlight inverter. There are 4 toriod coils on this circuit board. Refer to the link for detailed pictures. http://home.pacbell.net/cmonte/monitor/f1703.htm The solder joint discoloration(yellow-brown) on the solder side of the FL inverter board, indicates too much heat was present and a possible cold joint (I had only 1 bad joint, at the exact same location as pictured). Good soldering techniques should be practiced before making the repair. A bad, cold solder joint does not look shiney. If you don't know how to solder practice on some 18 gauge scrap wire first. Placing the soldering iron against the joint for about 7 seconds seconds and applying a minute amount solder until it flows, is all that is necessary for the proper repair. Don't apply too much solder, if you do suck it back off with the solder sucker tool, and reapply a &quot;minute&quot; amount. Compare your joint with others on the board. 7. Now reassemble the monitor using steps 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1. Snapping it back together again is a breeze. So for the $25 worth of tools you can be up and running again in no time with your own monitor, and not some old reconditioned monitor HP replaces for you for free or not.

Once the 4 screws holding the board down are removed, the board can be slid out from the connector mating it to the other circuit board, and then simply flipped over to expose the solder side of the board, and make the resolder repair.

Today, 1/31/06 I faxed a four page letter to the CEO, Mark Hurd of HP requesting that they investigate the problems we are all having with the f1503 monitors. I advised him that I am prepared and will file complaints with the State Attorney General office, and the Better Business Bureau, as well have already contacted The Law Firm of Girard Gibbs in San Francisco, who had initiated an investigation into the f1703 issues prior to HP extending the warranty on those models, to open another investigation into the f1503 if they ignore my request. I advised him that there are many of us posting here at CNET with issues on the f1503 so he cannot say that they dont know anything about it. In the past I have found this type of action to end in positive results, but if not I will proceed with my complaints. If I get any resolution I will advise Mr. Hurd that I will forward anyones name who is interested in a resolution also. I will be back to let you all know the progress on this nd if its good we can maybe communicate so we all can get our issues resolved.

I paid for ''post warranty'' technical support only to have them tell me to take it back to where it was purchased for repair. I have not yet done so, but still sometimes try out the monitor, hoping for a spontaneous recovery. No such luck. It has to be the same problem others are having with the 17 inch monitor. Thanks again.

Yesterday after researching the problem again, I found this HP link: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/genericDocument?cc=us&docname=c00409521&lc=en It notes that some of the HP Pavilion f1703 monitors have &quot;hardware issues,&quot; which cause the monitors intermittent video, no video, or no backlight. They will replace your monitor if your monitor fits the criteria outlined. I called and my monitor fits! It took a while on the phone (major hassle), however, I will be receiving a new monitor within days! Hope this helps you. Irma

However its alright if you are in the USA, you can easily get an exchange. I emailed the American site for HP and they informed me they are only authorised to exchange faulty models in the USA. I therefore got in touch with the UK branch and was told to phone a particular number which is next to useless as I couldn't get to speak to a human being. PLEASE HELP someone, as I am unsure what to do next. There must be other people in the UK with faulty monitors. Thanks.

Please, do yourself a favour, and check the required input voltage on the back on your monitor to make sure that your power supply can output that amount. I wasted several hours trying to fix this simple problem when a proper power supply was inches away. BTW: My Mom's, co-worker's F1503 came with a 7.5V - 1.5A power supply when it needed a 12V - 3A power supply. Pretty stupid eh? ^_^

The monitor is labelled 12V - 3.5A while the power supply's output is rated 12V - 4.16A. Do I assume correctly that the supply is sufficient for the monitor? If so, my problem would seem to be elsewhere . . .

Not from the time it was purchased. I am passed the 1 year limited warranty and now passed the date it was manufactured. HP is really screwing us and I won't ever buy another HP product again.

To my knowledge, a larger power supply generally cannot hurt, as the device should only take what it needs (to a point anyway). Of course that could be complete disinformation, and it could still be a problem with the power supply, although it seems unlikely. Hopefully you can borrow a power supply from someone with the required output as you definitely dont want to buy one on a whim b/c they are really expensive.

REF:- http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7590-0.html?forumID=67&threadID=62739&messageID=1220590 . Any which way, when you have a problem of blackout IT IS A BAD SOLDER JOINT on the power inverter board. It will take some skill with an ultra-fine solder tool and the finest solder you can buy for SMT boards. (If you don't have any email me and I will send you a 4' coil for $5.00). The trick is to remove the screen bezel without breaking the locking tabs. Its best to start on the bottom of the monitor. Work with a fine narrow bladed spatula or large blade X-Acto knife. Pry off one clip, starting in the center and working with a small flat blade screwdriver, slide along the bottom working the screwdriver into each snap and the flat blade to hold the plastic opened just enough to work around. Do both sides and the top should just pop off with a gentle smack of your hand. Once inside, remove carefully all frame monitor screws, the monitor cable connector posts, and carefully pry off all multi-pin connectors. Turn over entire ass'y with one hand holding the screen and the other remove the plastic case. You don't want to crack the LCD at this point so lay it down on a towel or soe=mething soft. remove the chrome cover (2 machine screws, tap down it comes free) Then get to each connector by removing any foil tape. Gently lift each connector using a stiff pen-knife or flat bladed tool designed for these connectors.(Do not bend any pins) Its best to mark the return position with a black marker so the polarity remains the same. No force should be required when replacing. Remove all eight screws holding the main circuit board and inverter board. Remove the four 2-prong connectors on the side of the inverter (Mark carefully numbering which sockets they go back into) Inspect under a lighted magnifier for any COLD joints. If found or suspected. re-solder CAREFULLY. Avoid if at all possible the tiniest SMT components as these are extremely difficult to re-solder or replace. Stick to the 2 tiny yellow coils, the 4 torroid coils (Just a ring with solid copper witre around it) and the two large driver coils. unsolder if you can using a solder-wick or 'sucker'. Resolder carefully and fully being sure solder is almost flowing to the reverse side of the board. If the two tiny yellow coils are removed they should have a resistance of approx 130 MOhms and they are returned in the same polarity as removed.(the board should be marked) To be sure SWAP their positions on the board (top to bottom, and bottom to top). After carefully re-inspecting all remaining joints and your solder repairs re-assemble in the same order as removed. Presto - your monitor will work - like new. If the above instructions didn't work, you either butchered your monitor because you didn't have the skill to work on circuit boards or you can use your monitor for an anchor - because that was never the problem. Good luck (Any solder coil payments are made to Paypal @syben@suncoin.com) email me in advance Syd

After about 30 months of usage, the power and light went out on the monitor, although there was suitable voltage on the power supply. Clearly it wasn't a power supply issue. Re-soldering the four inductors did the trick. It took about two hours of effort. The most difficult part was removing the monitor bezel. I found that by very carefully applying pressure on the screen side of the bezel it came off easier than prying on the outside. Thanks again for saving me a lot of time, money, and grief!

The lady simply helped me out getting the info. to get the replacement sent out. It took maybe 20 minutes and was done. The new monitor came within the next 5 days and I just packed my old monitor into the new box and sent it back to HP. I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions. -Jess.

I called HP's help line and reached ''Michael'', who I could barely understand, and told him that I had found HP's page that detailed the F1703 problem and that I thought I qualified for a replacement. But my monitor was built in April 2004 which meant that I missed the extended warrantly period by one week. His response was basically ''Too bad. If you had called last week we would have replaced it. Good day''. I then sent this e-mail to HP: ''I purchased a Pavilion f1703 monitor along with a Pavilion a562n PC in June 2004. All was well until a few months ago when the monitor started blacking out periodically. Usually powering down and up solved the problem. However about 3 weeks ago it got progressively worse and now it will only stay on for about two seconds at a time. It is basically useless. I checked for similar problems on the internet and discovered this on your website: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/genericDocument?cc=uk#docname=c00409521#lc=en It wasn't until then that I realized that this was a known problem. I contacted your call center with all the info requested and was very disappointed to be told that since my monitor was built in April 2004, I had missed the extended warranty period by one week. Essentially I was told ''Too bad, if you had called last week we would have replaced it.'' I have purchased only HP products (PC's, monitors, printers, cameras) for as long as I can remember so you can imagine how disappointed I was at the treatment I received. I feel that you should have notified purchasers that there was a known problem with the monitor rather than having me find out about it too late. I feel that you should replace the monitor and not penalize me for discovering the problem one week too late. I hope this issue can be resolved to my satisfaction. Thank you for your time.'' They responded immediately with: ''Thank you for contacting HP Total Care. I regret that the quality of service you received through Phone Support did not meet your expectations. Candid feedback such as yours will help us to improve our service. In reviewing your message I understand that you are experiencing an issue with HP Pavilion f1703 monitor and you would like to get a replacement or repair for your HP Pavilion f1703 monitor. I apologize for the inconvenience caused and appreciate your patience and cooperation. I will be happy to assist you through our E-mail Support. I would like to share this information with you that I just had a discussion with my L2 level and supervisor on this issue and, I would be glad to ship you the replacement Monitor to serve an esteem customer like you. The following information will help you in getting the HP Pavilion f1703 monitor replaced.'' A replacement monitor was at my house three days later. I guess sometimes it pays to complain. Feel free to use my e-mail to get your replacement.

I've been fighting with my F1703 monitor on and off for the past few months thinking that a power surge that took out my XP install also did some damage to the monitor. Just a few days ago, it seemed to up and die. Frustrated and thinking that the inverter had finally given out, I ordered a replacement. I later started researching the repair-ability and availability of a replacement inverter for my 1703 when I happened upon this thread. Unfortunately, I discoverd that I'm two months outside of getting HP to repair/ replace it, but the instructions on this forum regarding the re-soldering of the inductors did the trick! Thanks for this thread!

And, I've had this problem once before and I took it to Best Buy and they fixed it by soldering parts together on the backlight part of the monitor and it's fixed it for awhile. My monitor is a little over a year old as well. Now that it is doing this again I will need to take it back to Best Buy to see if they could fix it or even replace it would be nice. Just thought I'd add my 2 sents I wish I could help you more in suggestions on how to get this fixed

I was out of warrenty and everyone was trying this and that. Just call HP like I did back then, they will exchange your monitor for a refurbished one (modified for the problem). I had to give them a credit card until I return my old monitor. The replacement arrive in 2 day via FedX. I used the same box, with labels they supplied and less than a week I was back in business. It was easy, no stress, no fuss and now a year later, the refurb is working GREAT !!!!

That is screen going blank usually after 2 seconds. Tip use a stanley knife or smaller and scrape gently the solder just slightly below where the wire enters the tiny solder bubble. Do this on all four round coils.(2 wires on each 8 in all) Then with the board tilted upwards apply a small amount of solder with your iron for 3 to 4 seconds. I used a magnifier whilst examing the board and the final soldering. If you feel you are not up to it get a friend who has some electronic/radio/soldering experience to do it for you it only takes less than 40 minutes. The front bezel can be removed by prising with a screwdriver at the top left. Take out the two rubber plugs at back to get at the stand screws these need to be removed.Remove panel screws plus interface cable nuts and screws holding metal shield . Bend clips on shield also to get metal shield off. There are four screws to remove board plus 4 plugs on right. Make sure you note where they go. Board can then be pulled out sideways from its socket (usually black)I wish all fixes where this easy.Eureka !!!

My name is Richards. How may I assist you today? Richards K: Hi Arnold. Arnold Livingston: hi my hp monitor is faulty Richards K: Could you please provide me with a detailed description of the issue, so that I can assist you better? Arnold Livingston: It blacked out, then when it turned back on the picture is all scrambled Arnold Livingston: it is a f1703 model Richards K: Okay. Richards K: May I know as to when did the issue start? Arnold Livingston: about a month ago Richards K: Okay. Richards K: Could you elaborate on the picture issue (scrambled)? Arnold Livingston: looks like the lines are mixed up Richards K: Okay. Richards K: Have you tried any troubleshooting steps before contacting us? Arnold Livingston: yes tried with different pc & different vga cable, still same problem exists Richards K: So I gather that the monitor behaves the same when connected to a different PC, is that correct? Arnold Livingston: yes Richards K: Okay. Richards K: I would suggest that you reset the monitor using the buttons on the monitor. If the issue persists, you will need to get the monitor serviced. Arnold Livingston: does warranty cover this fault? Richards K: Yes, the issue is covered under your monitors warranty. Arnold Livingston: how do i try a reset? Richards K: You will need to do this using the buttons on the monitor. Richards K: Press the Menu button to open On Screen Display to the OSD Main Menu. Arnold Livingston: Cannot read OSD menu as picture is scrambled Richards K: Okay. Richards K: You will need to get the monitor serviced. Richards K: Unfortunately, you have reached the US support team right now. Richards K: From the information provided by you, it tells me that you are from the UK. Richards K: Is that correct? Arnold Livingston: I believe this blackout fault is very common & you are actually replacing f1703 models even if past warranty date Arnold Livingston: yes UK Richards K: That option expired in September of 2006 . Richards K: I cannot provide you with your service\warranty options form my end. Richards K: You will need to contact the support team in your region, to check your service options. Arnold Livingston: so i missed out by a very short period of time Richards K: Unfortunately, yes you did. Richards K: To confirm the option in your region, you can chat with a support specialist in the UK. Richards K: Please access the following weblink for your support options in the UK. Richards K: http://welcome.hp.com/country/uk/en/contact_us.html Arnold Livingston: why did you not recall screens which may develop the fault? Richards K: We did recall as many monitors as possible that we had records on. Richards K: Most of the monitors are sold by reseller's, and we cannot track those purchases, unless the customer contacts us with the issue. Arnold Livingston: OK i will not purchasr hp ever again Richards K: I am sorry, you feel that way. They will not replace monitors now! Ridiculous or what. Anyone know how to fix a scrambled pic?

My f1703 worked fine for more than two years but finally broke down, of course, after the extended warranty period was over. I must admit, I was a bit reluctant to start messing around inside a $500 monitor even after being dissappointed by the HP Customer service department. But finally I decided to give it a try. I followed these instructions. In my case it was only one joint. Can you believe it? And it was quite easy to identify it, indeed on one of the coils.. See also http://www.lesliewong.us/blog/2005/05/02/hp-pavilion-f1703-flat-panel-display-blackout-solution/ for some good pictures of what to do after removing the cover. By investing only $10 in a soldering iron and one Saturday morning I saved $500 for a new monitor. Good luck to all others facing the same symptoms!

The poor thing - it died so young - only 21 (months that is). The disease - a bad case of 'Flash-Blacks'. Then finally ... death with its unique smell of burnt out electronics. My husband and a friend are going to try the mad scientist option to bring the 'thing' to life again. Thanks to all who have posted the secret inner workings. There may be a chance of life again. Yes - I did try to get some response from HP - but ... well, you know the score. They would not even consider my monitor - not the same problem, out of the 27 month extended warranty, etc. I am warning everyone I know.

If I hear about HP's JD Powers and Associates certification for Customer Service again, I may shoot myself. My unit was MFG June 2004, died Dec. 2006. 30 month life expectancy, some quality. I communicated with Daniel, Samuel, Peter, Charles, and Sara, never the same one twice. Thought I was communicating with the twelve apostles. Never got to the real guy. Results, I'm one frustrated and mad individual who will tell anyone who will listen that HP products are junk and their customer service is a World Class Joke. Consider their products throw-away items. I purchased a $300 model 3050 printer the day before the F1703 quit. Never opened it. Took it back today and told the whole store about the lousy warranty. I guess I'll try the cold solder fix on the F1703. There I said it.

Took 40 minutes from disconnect to dissassembly, repair, re-assembly and re-connect. WALLA it works. Heck of a lot better service than offered by HP.

I'm guessing some component has died - any ideas what to look for? It started doing this intermittently at first, but now it is like this all the time. When I press the menu button I can see remnants of the menu screen as the colors and lines morph into different patterns. So the monitor is still alive in there somewhere. Mine was made September 2003.

It was built July 2004, and I bought it in Dec 2004 (Sams Club I think). Same failure described in this thread. I just called HP's almost-coherent support center in India, was transfered to technical support when I declined to pay $350 for a replacement. Mr. Technical wasn't much of a talker, called back, Alan offered for $45 to talk to me or I could fix it through email (that would be a marvelous feat!) I asked for a supervisor, and have now been holding for 20 minutes. None of the people I spoke with from HP acknowledge the 27 months warranty extension or defects in general. Just me being S.O.L. I have a spare monitor, so I'm not sure it's worth the wait and debate. I will try to replace the power adapter - AND NEVER BUY ANOTHER HP! I have always bought them for the kids because they're cheap, but the reality is, THEY ARE CHEAP, and I will buy them Dell computer's from now on. My last one was running strong after 9 years, and the last Dell I bought (and it's LCD) works great.

Even sent an E-Mail to the CEO, he's as dumb as the rest of HP's employees. None have the brains God gave a goat. Even a goat knows when to put his head down and do something constructive. I did the &quot;cold joint solder fix&quot; that Mr Wong suggested and fixed the problem (it's still going great). I suspect that they had a complete build-run at their circuit board factory that were defective and hoped that if they ignored it they could get away with only a very few that they had to replace. WRONG, they have lost a lot of potential customers like me who will never buy another HP product as long as I live. And I'll continue to tell they whole world why. If you or a friend have the soldering capability, try Mr Wong's procedure. It can't hurt. Right now you have $300 to $500 worth of boat anchor. If it works, you got a stand-by monitor, if not you still have a boat anchor. Just don't ever buy another HP product. Good luck. Oldspud.

I have reflowed all joints and replaced numerous caps. Just can't seem to find the culprit. I think the Genisis (GM2121) on the logic pcb is defective. Before I get into scoping the chip with the datasheet I would like to see the service manual. From what I'm reading around in the forums not many even have the same issue I have. The backlight is fine hoever, seems like the cable is bad video used to come on and fade out and them kinda goes blank. Now NO video I can make out and lines fade to solid blueish. Reflowed the cable on both ends as well on the raw panel connector under the microscope and the pcb side. Used heat gun tricks and cold to no avail. Just can't nail this one down.

I hope the service manual i have been sending was useful, but, i received some info that it is not. Please note that this particular manual is just for service and/or troubleshooting, it is not the actual schematic.

I bought one at a thrift store for $4. I didn't expect it to work so it was a good candidate for testing. I'm sure that what I found was not the only problem that can happen but it is one that does.As with any electronic device cold solder joints are always a problem especialy on items like transformers that have larger lugs on them that are hard for a solder wave machine to get hot enough to flow good and are rigid enough to expand and contract pulling loose joints apart, so by all means check them, if you arn't sure just reflow all the large ones to be sure. If the voltage regulator has loosened retighten it, again a part that sees alot of heat and the screw provides a connection for the regulator. Back to my test one, I hooked it all up and sure enough it was black, with the use of a flashlight held on the screen you can see the video was there just no light so you can see it. A LCD screen doesn't produce light just colors the pixels a bocklite must shine through so you can see it, the flashlite will demonstrate this and allow you to check for an actual image. What I found in mine was there is a fuse on the light power board, not a glass fuse as most will suspect but what looks like a diode. small black with a lead on each end and it has a 2A on it if you look at it with a magnifier. I removed it and tested it, it was bad so I replaced it and the monitor works great. I know there is the question of why did it blow? Well I will run it awhile and see if there is a problem elswhere or it could have just failed from age or a power surge, no telling. As for HP if they have had that much trouble out of an item they should step up and resolve it, they will loose alot more than the cost of helping if they don't. As for power supplies there are plenty of them on Ebay for $15 or so and yes one from a laptop will work as long as the voltage isn't to high, I'm running mine on 17 vdc now. Hope this helps some of you and good luck. I can post a picture if his will help. Old461

It looks like a diode but if you look closely it has a 2 A on it and no stripe . If you remove it there will be a fuse symbol on the board under it. Test it it is probably bad replace it and it will work. Steve

I am testing the three prongs for continuity, ans I am observing a sort of intermittent continuity, which to me is consistent with the intermitent blackout on my moitor, but I don't know. When my monitor blacks out, I can still vaguely see the screen, so that must mean current is still getting through, yet I am losing complete continuity in the Con101 jack. So, I am confused and wondering if I have found my problem, or am wasting my time, cause like I said earlier, I've resoldered everything, and so far I have not fixed the problem. Thanks to all who have helped.

Try unsoldering one end of it and lifting it slightly then test again to be sure you read only the fuse. Steve

Also, for the Con101 connector, I am reading approx. 4000 ohms between two of the prongs...Any idea what that means? The prongs are oriented in a triangal like manner, where two of the prongs are parallel, and the other one perpendicular to the two parallel ones.I am reading 4000 ohms across the two parallel ones, and again across the (parallel one) closest to the middle of the board and the perpendicular one. I don't know how to interpret this.

Could not tell if you had removed the old solder or not. Last year, I corrected the problem using wong's procedure. Instead of resolder, I removed the old solder from the four coil connections, then resolder the four coils connections. Also, used a circuit board stripping solution to clean the connections prior to soldering and after soldering. Don't know if the solution did anything at all, but did remove excess flux from the board. This procedure worked well for a year, had to do it again this year. Worked again so far.

Went looking for the breaks in the soldering but they seemed fine even after vigorously studying them for at least 10 mins. I decided to just reheat the old solder spots for 3 to 4 seconds each as instructed. I then put it all back together just hoping it would make a difference. Despite being a bit of a novice at this sort of repair it was incredibly easy. I then hooked it up turned it on and was amazed, good as new!!! Thank you very much LH-UK-TECH, you saved me a few hundred dollars. Screw those F***EN HP dogs!!!

As long as you have it apart and are soldering, replace the junk transistors on the board, The transistors I am referring to are the push-pulls (4) just before the Xformers on the output to the ccfl's. They do not survive the cold solder joints on the torroidal coils. They overheat and fail after a few seconds. Replace with transistors that have a higher rating and re-solder the toroids and your monitor should work perfect. I have been repairing these junk boards for years and have never had a return on any that I have done this to.

I went around with HP and was basically told it would cost to fix their screw up. When CNET sent me an e-mail last week, I went and dug the monitor out of my garage and tore into per the instructions from LH-UK-TECH. The step by step were easy to follow. However, I had to wing it because the small coils were not in yellow casings, but they were the only copper coils, 4 of them. I have never used my solder iron and the tip I had was probably to big, but I have a monitor connected to a computer instead of collecting dust in my garage, 7 months it hads been sitting. Thanks a ton and I agree with adzaburnz, HP needs to back their product more.

The ones listed on there were actually C5707, but had C5706 in the listing title for searching purposes. Anyway, they were only 99 cents each plus shipping. I was having this exact issue on a monitor I got for free, so I tore it apart and noticed that two of these transistors had a hole burned out of them, but didn't notice any cold solder joints. I just ordered the parts a few minutes ago, so hopefully this will solve my problem for less than $20!

I did as the instructions say to. but my backlight board didn't look like it had any bad cold sodder joints. I went over it with a magnifer glass for an entire day looking at all the joints. None seemed to be bad. So I went ahead and resoddered the 4 coils again. And sure enough, it fixed the problem. If you take away the day I looked for bad joints, it only took like an hour or so to really do the job. A friend gave it to me because it didn't work. now I have a really cool LCD for free.

Same problem everyone else seems to be having. Press the on button, came on for a second or so and then went blank. Press button again, turn on again and the same happened. I managed through trying time and again after pressing on to quickly press menu, then go down to Factory settings, press select, go down to Yes and press select again. This reset to the Factory settings and it seems to be working okay. Been like this now for about a week. I don't know how long it will last - if it goes again will try re-soldering. Guess I won't be buying HP products as this was a part of a very expensive system.

Transformers and inductors used on the power supply board have enamel insulation on them. Most magnet wire is insulated with enamel - yeah, like paint. The problem is, when you need to solder the wires, the enamel should be cleaned off of them. Well, when this display was made, someone didn't do a good job preparing the transformer and inductor wires prior to soldering. So the solder joints fail. Anyone with internet access, a little mechanical skill (for opening the display), and soldering skills can fix this. Instructions are all over the net. For $15, I'd be willing to re-solder your board, and for $30, I'll take it out of the monitor and put it back when I'm done. It's that easy.

As to EXACT replacement if you can't JURY RIG this then you need to have a friend with solder iron burns on their hands do this for you.

I have posted back last sunday but must have messed up somewhere, somehow its missing, as i said before new to comps and replying to forums As for my problem there seems to be a misunderstanding you mentioned AVG and i googled and only found large glass fuses, you mention Jury Rig a term i am not familiar with but i take it to mean modify in some way, and i am pretty fair with solder and irons so i am confident that i can do the job, But i need to identify the fuse first and find someone who supplies it, in retail quantities. The fuse inquestion is 3mm x 2mm x 1mm in size aprox, its found on the solder side of inverter board (f101) and its white ceramic with silver ends brick shaped with 6.5 stamped on it, if i ever get one i thought i would solder the new one on top of the old one due to how small it is, do you think that will be ok??? as i have said before my biggest problem is identifying and finding retail outlet that can supply it. The only info about this fuse comes from this forum thread , post number 339 by GEEKYPR but it never went anywhere due to it not being the problem in their case,but it is very much the problem in my case. If you or GEEKYPR or anyone out there can help in any small way please do i will be very grateful thanks threebobdee

I mean to attach wire to an end of the fuse and then to where one end of the old fuse used to be. Repeat for the other side. Hope this clarifies it.

Can see the desktop very faintly, and the backlight goes out in a couple seconds after doing the off/on thing. I only just now found this thread, and since I've been wanting to get a new monitor (I'm on my backup CRT) figured I should try the fixes first. Tried all the screen resolutions, power cord things, but no dice. So I opened it up and inspected the capaciters, none are leaking or burst. I found one suspect solder spot and heated/added solder, but no dice. Then I went kind of crazy and soldered a lot of connections but nothing. (well, I did get better at soldering!) Part of my problem is that I don't know what inverters or coils or even an inverter board is. My f1903 has three boards instead of the f1703's two so that compounds the problem. One at far left as looked at from back is brown, with aluminum heatsinks, the AC adapter that the cord plugs into, and one toroidal copper-bound thingie and one square box-like thingie that has two sideways cylinders in it wrapped in copper (plus of course a lot of other stuff). Then in the middle there's the green board with the processing chip, it connects to the video adapters, and has one connection to the screen. Then there's a light beige board with four plug-in connectors to the screen which I think (?) is the inverter board. It has two horizontal cylinder thingies wrapped in copper, and two others that look almost the same. And two larger rectangular box-like things where the copper is wrapped vertically, and the rest of it is black, looks like a long box and has a lot more leads out of it. The two larger boards connect to each other with a cord going past the green board, so I don't know if they act as a single &quot;inverter board&quot; or &quot;power supply&quot; or what. I'm about given up, but am going to try to suck some solder (didn't have that before) out in case the heating up and adding a touch of solder didn't get it. But I don't really know which board to do it on, or which copper thingies are analogous to those in Wong's pictures. None of my components are horizontal &quot;doughnuts&quot; laced with wire as in that board. Does anyone have an f1903 that could tell me which ones are the likely culprit? Or maybe what surrounding objects I should look for in order to figure where the culprits are? Sorry I couldn't post link to pictures of the boards as I can't find examples of mine anywhere. And I don't have a digital camera. Good luck everyone!

The four thingies wrapped with copper on the beige board are actually vertical cylinders rather than horizontal, if that makes any difference. They look kind of the same but two have labels on the top, a different base, and some kind of silicone on them attaching them to something, or something. I'm so ignorant.

There are 4 transformes on the left about 1&quot; X 1 1/2&quot; that you need to resoulder. There is 4 transistors by them, larger ones C5706 these go bad alot.They power the transformers. There is a fuse on the board labeled FS101 that cold be bad. I have fund all of these to cause the same problem I'm sure 1 item stated the domino effect so if you fix them all at once you will probably be good. Be sure you have a proper power supply on it also. Should be 12 -13 volts DC with at least 2.5 amps of current. These transistors and power supplies can be obtained on Ebay for e reasonable price.

About 70% of what HP sells is outsourced, meaning someone else in Asia Makes it for HP and HP sells it. They are not alone, Dell and all of the other manufacturers are the same. Every computer company has products that develop similar faults, so saying one company is better than the other is a fallacy. I deal with people that swear they'll never send Dell another Penny also, so no company is immune. I work in the industry, so believe me I know. It's a sad reality. The HP F1503/F1703/F1903 monitors all suffer from a couple of different problems. It's been my experience that it is NOT, software, drivers or refresh rates, etc. This has been strictly a hardware problem. The Inverter power supply fails that provides high voltage to the 4 cold cathode fluorescent tubes that surround the LCD. The 4 Toroid coils on that board were hand soldered with inferior solder, I've seen this TOO many times coming from Asia. I have reworked several of these monitors, I TOTALLY remove the solder (with Solderwick) on the 8 connection points for these toroids, rather than just add solder to it, scraping the wire on the toroids where it protrudes through the circuit board after solder removal also ensures a better connection, take it down until you see copper. Make sure you don't leave any scrapings on the board. This ensures that you have a solid electrical connection and the enamel on the copper wire is removed. Resolder all 8 connections using fresh, high quality rosin solder. Use a lighted magnifier and look for other &quot;cold&quot; solder joints that are dull grey and have no shine to them, remove the old solder and replace all of these joints with fresh high quality solder. I also like to replace the 4 driver transistors 2SC5706 (C5706) (about $1 apiece you can buy them on EBay.) If you do all of this it should fix the problem the majority of the time. If you still have the &quot;comes on and then goes right back off&quot; issue, replace the AC Adapter. I DO NOT recommend buying an &quot;aftermarket&quot; version, they're not robust and tend to fail if you have power spikes. I replaced the AC Adapter with ones from an HP L1800 LCD Monitor. The adapter puts out over 5 Amps of current. The part number is PSCV700101A (Dell uses the same Model number.) It's from the same vendor. Once I redid the solder, replaced the transistors and replaced the AC Adapter I've had zero problems with the 5 or 6 of these monitors that I've rebuilt. This is a job for technicians with some component level skills. It's unfortunate that whoever the sourcing vendor for this monitor didn't use better solder in the first place. I wonder how much business HP lost over this issue. It would be hard to determine how many of these monitors have been discarded that could have been repaired, the whole thing saddens me that we've devolved into such a &quot;disposable society&quot;. If you have any questions about this repair, feel free to contact me. When this monitor works it works very well, is bright, and has a remarakably clear image.
