1.2.1	Be sure to talk to its maker about warranty support and repair .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	I bought all the parts in different shops , so checking will be paid .	St
1.3.2	I want to do everything myrself .	St
1.4.1	You may have a & quot ; cooling problem & quot ; be sure that the PC case is well taken care of .	St
1.4.2	If needed , that the video card has even more air flow or that immediate hot air , pushed out besides what it already does .	St
1.4.3	Since , you seem to be into gaming , all too often cooling issues arise .	St
1.4.4	Prolonged play and/or hi-end usage tends to find the weakest link .	St
1.4.5	Thus , cooling is very important not only to keep up and running but also to reduce any & quot ; heat stress & quot ; , because once that takes hold , again the weakest part will start to falter though it wo n't outright fail but produce symptoms such as yours .	St
1.4.6	Also , if possible increase the wattage for your PC as well , 580W , maybe at the edge of good use , but having more is a good thing .	St
1.4.7	If this PC has running well for some time and now seems to be acting up , this a result of heat stress , IMHO .	St
1.4.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	Then you are stuck with issues that require you to figure which part is either getting too hot , if there is a part that does n't work well with the others and ARCANE things like matching the BIOS settings to your RAM .	St
1.5.2	Today I 'm beginning to find that such is too much to ask and the sellers of this are not providing support even when you buy from them .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	Computers sometimes freeze , but if a computer freezes on startup regularly , or if it freezes when multi-tasking , there 's probably something wrong .	St
1.6.2	A computer could suffer permanent damage when it stops running abruptly..	St
1.6.3	These Illegal operations or freezes can , many times , be related to bad or intermittent hardware , or simply mismatched hardware.. Mismatched hardware is common , even some of the large computer manufactures do insufficient analyses and testing when they select the components that make up their systems .	St
1.6.4	Many components that make up a computer just do n't play well together..	St
