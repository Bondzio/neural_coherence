2813	0	274299	2644882	NR	Confusimo	12/3/07 3:47 PM	1.19669682E12	Thermaltake V1?	Anybody familiar with a thermaltke V1? Thermaltake V1 P/N:CL-P0401 I can't register at their forums. Some debug error. Won't let me register. It is great good reviews and all. The only thing is the fan connector is 3 pin. My motherboard is 4 pin for CPU? Should I connect it anyway to the 3 and leave the 4th alone? Or should I take it back? Thanks, Confusimo

To compare CPU coolers see this site (it's not mine): http://www.dansdata.com/coolercomp.htm I like Scythe. I like Noctua fans. See there specifications. Get the quietest fan possible for a CPU cooler. They make the most noise.
