1.1.1	Does anyone know if you can take a p/s right out of the box , put it on the counter , plug it in and everything should work fine or does it have to be installed ?	Ques
1.1.2	I bought a 400w coolmax and when I plugged it in the fan ran for a second and shut down .	St
1.1.3	Both on the counter and in the case .	St
1.1.4	No other cables connected .	St
1.1.5	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	A power supply is not installed .	St
1.2.2	Take it back .	St
1.3.1	I suspect you may need an item like this http : //www.pcpowerandcooling.com/products/alarmandaccesories/accessories/popups/index_tester.htm to test/power on the PS as a stand alone unit .	St
1.3.2	However I am not in the PC build-it/fix-business .	St
1.4.1	You need a load in order to test , otherwise the p/s unit will shutdown or simply not work .	St
1.4.2	I assume when you say , & quot ; does it have to be installed ? & quot ; that all the required wire harness were hooked-up and if so and it still did that either an improper connection or bad unit .	St
1.4.3	I exclude any possible mtrb ( system ) problem besides the p/s , as if that 's the reason you brought it the 1st place ?	Ques
1.4.4	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.5.1	the only load was the rear 120mm fan .	St
1.5.2	No other components are even installed in the case .	St
1.5.3	Seems to me that the p/s should at least provide enough power to turn it 's own fans .	St
1.5.4	Of course that 's why I asked .	St
1.5.5	Thanks	Polite
1.6.1	The behavior you describe is normal for an & quot ; ATX & quot ; type power supply , the type used in virtually all PC 's made in the last 5 years or so .	St
1.6.2	An ATX supply is actually turned on via the motherboard .	St
1.6.3	The switch on the back of the supply , if any , only switches on/off the AC going into the supply .	St
1.6.4	To test on the bench , you need first attach a & quot ; load & quot ; to the supply to prevent damage , then jumper pins 14 and 15 to start the supply .	St
1.6.5	PLEASE DO NOT try this if you are not comfortable playing around with electricity !	St
1.6.6	See http : //www.compute-aid.com/atxspec.html for more info .	St
1.7.1	You need a true load whether it be the actual mtrbd .	St
1.7.2	or a & quot ; dummy load & quot ; sold for that purpose .	St
1.7.3	http : //www.pcpowerandcooling.com shows such a device .	St
1.7.4	Other vendors offer it as it as well , probably called an ATX p/s dummy/load tester .	St
1.7.5	I believe http : //www.computergeeks.com has it as well .	St
1.7.6	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
