The ibook detected the memory, and updated the total RAM as 768MB (512 + 256). Everything seems alright, but after working for a very short while, the ibook will stop responding. He restarts the ibook, and after a while, the machine &quot;hang&quot; again. If he removes the 512 memory, the machine will work fine. Could this be the problem of the RAM? Or what other reasons can there be?

If, on removing the RAM, the machine functions normally, I would suspect that the RAM was faulty. Pass on a little more information and we'll go from there. BTW, most RAM from reputable companies is warranted for life. P
