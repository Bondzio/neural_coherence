<s> About That Long String of USB Devices.... Can you reeeally string 137 devices from a single USB port on your PC??? </s>
<s> I don't think so. </s>
<s> O.K.!.. </s>
<s> O.K.!! </s>
<s> Quiet already!! </s>
<s> Read on. </s>
<s> I'm a sucker for devices. </s>
<s> If I don't already have it hooked into my USB 'string' of hubs, I have at least tried it. </s>
<s> I am also a sucker for leaving all sorts of software (freebies or $$$) on my computer. </s>
<s> The CPU must look like a demolition derby. </s>
<s> This little piece of code screaching to a halt while another piece of code finishes with a resource. </s>
<s> Yep.. sooner or later some little piece of code will fall asleep at the wheel and blow that stop sign. </s>
<s> Result?? </s>
<s> the dreaded system crash!! </s>
<s> With 148 seperate applications... 250,000 seperate files (try a virus scan on that!!)... </s>
<s> 90+ processes on my poor little AMD Athlon 64... four printers... wireless LAN... a couple of card readers... IR... wireless USB keyboard... WACOM tablet... (you get the picture??) </s>
<s> it's no wonder that device drivers don't know how to drive (smurk..smurk)! </s>
<s> Let's face it... some driver programmers can't program worth a squat...and you know who you are!!! </s>
<s> This is especially true for that cute little mouse that wags a tail every time you double-click!!! </s>
<s> Viruses aside, device drivers have just got to be the single most cause of crashes there is. </s>
<s> You can't really expect that grunt programmer to know all there it to know about proper use of stacks and all that other technical stuff of CLEAN memory management. </s>
<s> Why do you think there are a thousandgazillion memory managers out there. </s>
<s> Why do you think there are a milliongazillion registry and other file CLEANERS out there!!! </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;&gt; checking my blood pressure &lt;&lt;&lt; Windows XP has (what is it now??) </s>
<s> over 60 million lines of code?? </s>
<s> Security HOLES aside... you expect that structure to be PERFECT??? </s>
<s> HAAA! </s>
<s> Remember.. an operating system (XP) is supposed to keep all those drivers driving down the right path at the right time, behaving the right way so they do the right thing. </s>
<s> I DON'T THINK SO!!! </s>
<s> What do you think! </s>
<s> (I'm outta here!!!) </s>
<s> And the 127 USB devices was demonstrated years ago. </s>
<s> You may have missed the demo. </s>
<s> but they used a clean machine under best of circumstances. </s>
<s> Try it with a machine running 90 processes. </s>
<s> It won't work. </s>
<s> I think that explained it well. </s>
<s> No fast forward to today where drivers are written by outsourced people that don't own a computer? </s>
<s> What happens? </s>
