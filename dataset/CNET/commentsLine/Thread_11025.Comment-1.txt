but it will connect to a different isp.
???
ok, we have a strange situation.
first, i am not a computer or networking expert.
i have managed to hack together a home system consisting of; a linksys ea2700, nettalk voip unit, dvr for our cctv system, a printer, and a few wired complicators and a wireless laptop.
all of this is through one of our isp's.. ( we have 2) now, we recently had a new complicator built.
nothing fancy just win7 64bit.
when i tried to connect it to the network, it wouldn't even acknowledge it's existence.
so i connected it to the other, not in the network, isp and bingo, connected like a champ.
obviously, there is a setting missing somewhere.
my question is, how do i get the new complicator to join the network?
i've fished this around a few other threads but no-one seems to have a clue, so cnet, you're up!
