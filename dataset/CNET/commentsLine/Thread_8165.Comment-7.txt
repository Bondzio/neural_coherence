these cards will be able to plug into your cable outlet and give you all the functionality of the mac product, analog and digital/qam.
you just need to figure out if you want dual tuners.
unless you've got a pc less than 2 years old with dual cores, forget the first choice and get one of the middle choices.
if you must watch a show and record a show, get the $150 wintv-hvr-2250 (top-of-the-line).
if you're a tinkerer, you can look into less expensive alternatives but hauppauge generally has the best support and broadest compatibilty.
the other cards can be tricky to get working (not difficult, but not plug it in and it works.)
consider the pinnacle pctv-hdtv dongles for a good $99 solution... it works but some folks have a hard time getting it working.
also, keep in mind that vista/xp media center can't handle qam... you'll have to use the software that comes with the tuner or a third part product (sage, beyondtv, etc.).
windows 7 has built-in support for qam and will be very happy with any of the hauppauge cards.
