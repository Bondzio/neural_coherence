<s> Hi I am going to purchase a new desktop to replace current six-year-old Dell Dimension 8250. </s>
<s> I am a senior and this will probably be my last comuter. </s>
<s> I am only a general user but want the most &quot;bang for the buck&quot; PC. </s>
<s> I am strongly considering an Acer Aspire X3200-ED5600A or Acer Aspire X1700-U3700A(I think these are almost the same machine but believe I can purchase the 3200 a little cheaper-it looks as though the major differences are the Graphics Controllers: the 3200 uses the NVIDIAGeForce8200 and the 1700 uses the NVIDIA GeForce G100 and the Processors: the 3200 uses AMD Athlon X2 5600+ 2.9 GHz dual core and the 1700 uses the Intel Pentium Dual Core E5200 2.4 GHz Any significant differences? </s>
<s> Common Components Storage Controller: Serial ATA-300 Op. </s>
<s> Storage: DVD RW/DVD-RAM Ram: 4 GB DDR2 SDRAM Cache Mem. </s>
<s> : 1 MB L2 Cache Small Form Factor OS: Vista Home Premium 64 bit Hard Drive: 640 GB Audio Output: 5.1 channel surround The 3200 would cost about $415 online with free shipping and the 1700 would cost about $480 Thoughts on Acer/configuration? </s>
<s> The compact space of these is a factor and I do not upgrade components so the lack of upgradeability is not a factor. </s>
<s> Regards Ronhawk </s>
<s> Recommendation still same..SFF is a poor choice for system longevity and reliability. </s>
<s> Too much heat in too small a space and not many ways to efficiently eliminate it. </s>
<s> SFF severely limits HW options ...HS Fans, GPUs, PSUs, etc., in the event of component failure beyond warranty. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS...I'm not far behind you age wise but wouldn't consider SFF unless I needed portability. </s>
<s> The smallest I buy for anything is a mid tower with plenty of drives bays for drive spacing/separation, cooling and ease of access in the event I need to repair or replace a component. </s>
<s> VAPCD The first post was probably not in the most appropriate catgegory and since I didn't know how to transfer it to this category I re-posted it. </s>
<s> I do like the idea of the tower sitting on top of the desk instead of underneath it but can see your point in minimizing potential problems. </s>
<s> Can you give me some examples of mid-towers to get me started? </s>
<s> I did see a full-size desktop that seemed to have everything I would want-Gateway DX 4720-03, NVIDIA GeForce7100, DVDRW/DVD-RAM w/Labelflash, 4GB RAM(8GB max)DDR2-800MHz PC2-6400, Vista Home Premium 64 bit, Pen. </s>
<s> Dual Core E5200 2.5 GHz, 640 HDD, Fax/Modem-56Kbps, 7.1 channel surround. </s>
<s> Opinion? </s>
<s> Dell is also having some good prices on their budget pc's. </s>
