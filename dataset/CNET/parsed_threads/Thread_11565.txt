<s> Hey: As some of you might remember, I just purchased a new DVD burner so I could start to make back ups of my files. </s>
<s> My machine already has a CD reader/player ONLY installed, so the DVD I got is an external unit. </s>
<s> Now being as ignorant of some technology as I am, I asked the salesguy alot of questions. </s>
<s> Basically to prove to him I was as ignorant as I stated. </s>
<s> I asked what the different X's meant, what this word meant, ect. </s>
<s> I also assumed certain things, but know all to well what ASSUME stands for, so I even asked those questions. </s>
<s> I guess I didn't go deep enough. </s>
<s> I had assumed that the DVD hooked up to the computer via a USB port or a card slot that needed to be installed. </s>
<s> I asked which it was, & was told that hook up was simple thru a USB port. </s>
<s> The unit even came with needed cables. </s>
<s> COOL! </s>
<s> I took it home. </s>
<s> It's been sitting on the kitchen table ever since. </s>
<s> I carefully read ALL the papers that came with it, twice even. </s>
<s> It seemed an easy enough job to do. </s>
<s> Ain't Plug & Play just WONDERFUL! </s>
<s> Anywho, tonight was/is &quot;Kid's Eat Free Night&quot; at the local Denny's. </s>
<s> They also have activities for the kid's to do before, during, & after they eat. </s>
<s> So, I figured we'd go there, & I'd tackle the install when we came home, after feeding the dogs. </s>
<s> That's when I noticed it. </s>
<s> On the box of the DVD, it stated &quot;EASY INSTALL&quot; thru a USB 2.0 port. </s>
<s> The machine the DVD's getting hooked up to is a Dell 4400. </s>
<s> It has 4 USB ports, 2 front, 2 rear. </s>
<s> They are USB 1's I assume, since I had never heard about USB 2's when I got it. </s>
<s> As a matter of fact, today was the 1st time I had ever heard of USB 2's, while going thru THIS forum. </s>
<s> That was before I even knew I had made this mistake. </s>
<s> From what I read about USB 2's, they are about 40X's faster than regular USB's. </s>
<s> Also, ya can't Mix N' Match em. </s>
<s> I don't know, but the plugs look the same to me. </s>
<s> So now I'm sitting here with this DVD that I can't use, yet. </s>
<s> My question is this, &quot;What do I do to correct this problem?&quot; Are there any type of adapters out there? </s>
<s> Also, I have another question. </s>
<s> What is different between the terms &quot;BURN&quot; & &quot;RIP&quot;? </s>
<s> A BIG THANKS IN ADVANCE! </s>
<s> All you need is to get a PCI USB 2.0 card to plug the drive into. </s>
<s> They are inexpensive and will add 3-4 USB 2 ports. </s>
<s> That way you have 2.0 and 1.0. </s>
<s> The USB 1 and USB 2 plugs are identical. </s>
<s> USB 1 is 12Mb/s USB 2 is 480Mb/s When you bought the 4400 USB 2 was not available, so it wasn't your error. </s>
<s> JMarchi: So I assume (there's that word again) the card plugs into an expansion slot? </s>
<s> Thanks also for the way ya worded your answer. </s>
<s> Ya made it seem that I wasn't that much of a dumby. </s>
<s> Yes, you get a PCI USB card and plug it into one of the slots in the back of your system. </s>
<s> Easy to do. </s>
<s> Search google with just PCI and USB and you will find a lot of them in the $20 range. </s>
<s> JMarchi: Circuit City wanted $70. </s>
<s> for a 5 holer. </s>
<s> CDW's just down the street from me, less than a mile. </s>
<s> So, how's about the difference between burning & ripping? </s>
<s> and putting on a cd, burning is the action of putting on a cd? </s>
<s> maybey this will help? </s>
<s> http://www.cdrom-guide.com/forums/archive/index.php/f-11-p-35 </s>
<s> You can get a 3 or 4 port (or even 5) USB 2 PCI card for $20-35 from any reputable dealer. </s>
<s> Circuit city is not one. </s>
<s> Check it out on tne web, get a reality check and don't over pay to hurry it up. </s>
<s> What's COMPUsa want, problem with them, I have seen them charge $26 for a USB cable that was $7, same Brand and model at a store down the street. </s>
<s> You can get ripped off big time on small things if you are not willing to order and wait a few days. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> JMarchi: Thanks. </s>
<s> I used the Circuit City/CDW, experence as an example to my son about shopping. </s>
<s> Showed him that because I was in a hurry and didn't fully research my purchase, I coulda ended up giving Circuit City an extra $60. </s>
<s> Luckily, I did get a good/alright deal on the DVD. </s>
<s> I gulped when I was at CDW & asked about what they had. </s>
<s> Fortunately, I did a quick search before I went to get the card & saw that the average price for a 2 holer was about $20/25. </s>
<s> I also saw that CDW had a 6 holer on sale for $45., so when the guy at Circuit City said they were out of 2 holers but had a 5 holer for $70., I said forget that & went to CDW. </s>
<s> Got the 4 holer for $12. </s>
<s> (It almost sounds like we're talking about outhouses ;))Thanks. </s>
<s> I got my 4 &quot;holer&quot;(3 outer/1 inner) for $9 at Fry's on sale. </s>
<s> I still haven't figured out why you got an external unit for a lot more money and more headaches than an internal unit. </s>
<s> Anyway, good luck. </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> When the term &quot;ripping&quot; is used it generally means converting one format to a different format. </s>
<s> Such as ripping a wav. </s>
<s> file to a mp3. </s>
<s> file. </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> chuckieu: I've already got a CD Rom installed, & it was suggested that if I got an external I'd be able to do disk to disk burns. </s>
<s> I do have another bay to install another whatever in, but I really don't feel like messing around with this Dell, as it has been such a pleasure since day 1. </s>
<s> Ooops, a lightning bolt almost got me. </s>
<s> I'm looking forwards to the day when we get another HD for it & turning this one into a slave. </s>
<s> Darned bolt almost got me again! </s>
