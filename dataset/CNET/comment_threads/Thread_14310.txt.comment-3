Thanks for the reply.
I have tried most of what you are recommending.
I toggled the Fn key with F2 with no result.
I also tried the repair process but the outcome is still the same message.
I have not run the windows update recently since I have no internet connection.
The laptop has suffered no bumping or other damage.
Any other suggestions?
