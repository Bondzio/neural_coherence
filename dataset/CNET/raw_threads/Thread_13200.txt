Not a problem. however after the reinstall , my network card comes up as 1394 net adapter, and in the network settings this is the only connection available. I cannot connect to the Internet, I am pretty certain that the card identified is not the correct one, but, there is no other card visible, and no way of repairing it, or installing something else. Neither is winsoc corrupt. ..My internet connection is broadband always on... I am tearing my hair out, and to keen on a complete reinstall.....arrrgh
