<s> hi i had the macbook Core 2 Duo for About 8 months and it was working great. </s>
<s> yesterday i left a file download in firefox for 5 hours then went back to check on it , it was working FINE, Then i got Back after 2 minutes and the screen is suddenly white and not showing anything!! </s>
<s> i shut down the laptop and restarted , there was a chime and just white screen... i connected the laptop to an external monitor AND EVERYTHING IS WORKING on the external screen but the laptop screen is white!!! </s>
<s> i tried resetting the PRAM and i tried resetting the SMC twice but nothing Changed&gt;&gt; i can't use the apple hardware testing because the external monitor does not work till the system loads (and it does always)and i will be working blind.. so , is this a sudden hardware thing in the screen or what ? </s>
<s> i'm on a 3 year waranty but i don't have an apple store in my country !! </s>
<s> can i send the laptop to them via mail? </s>
<s> Where can i ask them directly via mail? </s>
<s> i previously backed up the laptop via time machine and i can fully use it on the external display , so would a restore of system folders HELP at least rule out system errors??? </s>
<s> i searched for similar problems but none seems to match mine because other people always had a system error , and i don't seem to have one.. </s>
<s> Please Guys any answer might help me , i have tons of work... </s>

<s> Your laptop uses the same components/firmware/software to produce the video and is then directed to ALL the outputs on your laptop. </s>
<s> ie. </s>
<s> LCD screen and VGA/DVI connection. </s>
<s> I suggest you call Apple in whatever country you are in and go from there. </s>

<s> I wonder i have exactly the same problem, what did the apple technician told you? </s>
