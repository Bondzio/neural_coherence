Ok, i know it sounds weird asking if something thats free is worth it, but heres the story. i was at my buddies house today and i noticed his partialy gutted computer lying around. i asked if he would be willing to part with it and he said i could have it for free if i wanted, since he had no use for it. thing is, its missing some key components. Its missing a processor, but thats no problem, i have an athlon XP 3000 lying around. its missing a graphics card, but thats not a problem either, i have various AGP graphics cards around my house. missing a hard drive, but i have a PATA hard drive lying around as well... What i DONT have lying around is RAM. it takes PC3200, two slots. a trip to the Futureshop website showed a 1GB stick for 30 bucks (kingston) so i would probably get 2 of those for 60. another thing i dont have is a monitor. a good LCD will set me back what, 150, 160 dollars? so i feel like im spending too much money and effort on a PC thats realy quite old and slow, but i always wanted to have a desktop in my room so :lol: . so do you guys think im wasting money, or is this a reasonable amount to spend to fix up a PC this slow? thanks for reading this far.

The Athlon core would vaporize in a split second (watch http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCmai6Q9DoM ) and far too many had the BAD CAPS issue. Unless you can get it all for free it's not a good deal. It would be a shame to spend one dime and then discover why the machine was stripped and set aside. If you want something small and nice I'll share I picked up that 350 buck Acer Aspire One. It's been a hoot. Bob

Having seen this machine class at the shop counters far too often my advice is to not spend a dime to get it working. If you get it all working FOR FREE then you can decide to upgrade the display, etc. Remember you are asking for opinions and I'm sharing mine freely. Bob

Maybe on ebay or in a local paper. Just sell it as tower only and all i'll have to buy is the RAM. i could definitely sell the tower for more than the price i paid for the RAM. its a good moneymaking scheme
