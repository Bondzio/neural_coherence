After using Select All, Copy, Paste to create larger .mov files from 2 smaller ones: the movies do not contain the resource files - QT reports &quot;cannot find file &quot;name of file.&quot; Same happens after using &quot;Add Audio File&quot; via the Edit menu.
Previous: these operations worked 100s of times.
Is this due to corrupt prefs?
If so, which one?
Using a Mac Pro, 10.6.7 w/ 8 GB RAM.
No other problems.
TIA for any help.
