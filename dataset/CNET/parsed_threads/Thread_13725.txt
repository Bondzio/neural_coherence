<s> I want to know what is best for me, and my family. </s>
<s> generally we have three people on the wifi at once, being online research, socializing (skype, ect. </s>
<s> ), and gaming. </s>
<s> I want the best for everyone, and Ive had a Netgear router and still do, but its like wearing out. </s>
<s> Its off and on functioning. </s>
<s> I havent had a linksys so I have no base for those. </s>
<s> We have windows8 and windows7 and an apple iPad on at once, generally. </s>
<s> Im not sure if these routers are windows8 compatible.. </s>
<s> So whats best for me? </s>
<s> If there is an issue with Windows 8 and routers this would be a first. </s>
<s> Here's the thing. </s>
<s> All the networking is done with IP networking and for WiFi other standards that have nothing to do with the OS in question. </s>
<s> The OS must only talk the protocol and we're done. </s>
<s> Because of this, that's probably why some folk can't answer your question about Windows 8. </s>

<s> I have had a Netgear R6300 for about a year now. </s>
<s> There have been 8 to 10 devices attached at one given time with no lapse or drops in performance. </s>
<s> I use a setting that will not allow other devices attach without permission. </s>
<s> The band I use is on a 5ghz frequency which has less traffic and no wireless overlap. </s>
<s> I also have the advantage of being close to my provider within the coverage area. </s>
<s> If you router allows for the 2.4ghz and 5ghz selection, you may want to opt for the 5ghz less traffic setting. </s>
<s> Also make sure your firmware is up to date. </s>
<s> Netgear has a windows 8 beta driver you may want to get for the windows 8 OS. </s>
<s> I hope this helps. </s>

<s> What if I'm in some WiFi hot spot? </s>
<s> Do we need drivers for the router used there? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Any hardware if not recognized by the OS requires a driver. </s>
<s> A driver is just a handler for the OS in identifying a particular hardware you want to attach to your PC. </s>
<s> It has nothing to do with a hotspot. </s>
<s> A provider asigns hotspots so you can access their services beyond your home connection. </s>
<s> Think of a hotspot as a relay station keeping you going from one point to another. </s>
<s> I have not installed a driver for a router yet. </s>
<s> Is there something different about this router? </s>
<s> Sounds like a model to avoid? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I never mentioned you needed a driver for a router. </s>
<s> However, it is my understanding, like most other external hardware, such as DVD drives and firewire, firmware is needed for the external hardware to communicate with or without the presence of a PC or OS. </s>
<s> In the case of a router, firware supports the presence of the communication between a service providers protocol and the hardware itself. </s>
<s> It branches the communication of the of the provider which then allows the hardware (router) to open a communication link to the internet. </s>
<s> Think of the router as a doorway to your destination. </s>
<s> Other hardware, such as a modem, play an important part in address handling which enables the router to open the correct door. </s>
<s> The R6300 was the first router to offer stated speeds above 1700 mbps (450+1300) and a connection for the proposed new draft for the next generation of WiFi which will be IEEE 802.11 a/n/ac @ 5GHz as well as the current IEEE 802.11 b/g/n @ 2.4 Ghz and 5Ghz. </s>
<s> For me, it has a proven trac record for handling multiple devices regardless of the OS. </s>
<s> Also, there is no problem with connecting to a wireless adapter or TV on another floor or any other part of the house. </s>
<s> I hope this helps somewhat! </s>
<s> But above I can read this: &quot;Netgear has a windows 8 beta driver you may want to get for the windows 8 OS.&quot; I read that and wanted to clarify that statement. </s>
<s> It's OK if that was in error but once in a while I encounter folk that think a driver is needed to use a specific router. </s>
<s> I hope we never see that. </s>
