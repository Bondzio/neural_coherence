<s> guys, i want to try to build my own desktop. </s>
<s> i am sick of ungrading my old computer. </s>
<s> i am ready for the challenge of building my own, and save some money in the process. </s>
<s> i want to be able to play world of warcraft, do wordprocessing, and internet. </s>
<s> any suggestions on what i should do. </s>
<s> want to spend no more than $750. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> It seems like it is a popular website used by many. </s>
<s> They got reviews and everything there. </s>
<s> Here, this $500 machine they built will run you World of warcraft and word processing. </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/2005/10/14/the_/ You can spend the left over money on monitor, RAM, or whatever you want </s>
<s> Do you need a complete system (complete computer box, keyboard, mouse, speakers, monitor)? </s>
<s> Or do you already have a good monitor or speakers that you wish to add to a computer box that you will build? </s>
<s> BTW, congratulations on taking on this challenge. </s>
<s> I find it is quite rewarding to build a new machine. </s>
<s> I trust you will, also. </s>
<s> I'm also in the planning stages of building a new computer. </s>
<s> I have chosen all of my hardware which includes an AMD X2 processor, Asus motherboard, Western Digital SATA hard drive, Sony DVD-RW etc.. My main concert at the moment is making sure I buy all of the cables I require. </s>
<s> The harddrives and optical drives that I have priced up are OEM so I wont recieve the cables like I would in a retail box. </s>
<s> Also not sure about the motherboard having cables packaged with it. </s>
<s> Does anyone have or know the where about of a checklist of some description that I can use to make sure I have everything I need before I start. </s>
<s> I'd hate to of started to find i was missing simple things. </s>
<s> A retail motherboard should come with all the cables you need for hard drives, optical drives, floppy drive, etc. </s>
<s> In fact they often come with more than you need. </s>
<s> Look carefully at the description of the motherboard. </s>
<s> It should say which cables are included. </s>
