1.1.1	I recently purchased a newer motherboard with no IDE ports at all.	St
1.1.2	So I had to add a PCI IDE controller to hook up my CD/DVD roms.	St
1.1.3	My problem now being how do I get it to boot from a CD to install an OS?	St
1.1.4	I choose boot from a CD in the Bios and it doesnt even seem to recognize anything.	St
1.2.1	While you didn't share the make and model of said card, it would have to usually have an onboard rom to supply the boot option.	St
1.2.2	Today you may find an IDE to SATA adapter to be the real fix.	St
1.2.3	Example at http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=SIL3611&cat=CBL Also, the common version of Windows (XP?)	St
1.2.4	doesn't install without some pain to many SATA systems.	St
1.2.5	But I bet you read up on that and have your floppy disk handy.	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	I know it's a ECS G33T-M2 Intel G33 Express Motherboard and just a generic PCI IDE Card.	St
1.3.2	I've tested in an old PC so i know it works.	St
1.3.3	It's Vista I'm trying to install.	St
1.3.4	The problem being that nothing is on the hard drives so it just flashes to the no OS found screen instantly on startup because the CDROMs hooked into the PCI IDE card don't show.	St
1.3.5	I may have to break down and order from the link you provided (thank you for that) and wait it out through shipping.	St
1.4.1	The BIOS on the motherboard doesn't support boot via IDE.	St
1.4.2	This is no surprise... Vista knows about SATA but be sure to research if they supply motherboard and more drivers since performance on plain Windows installs have been lacking until I finish the install.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	A review I read wrote &quot;On this motherboard you cant install an IDE optical drive e.g.	Polite
1.5.2	an IDE DVD/CD burner.&quot; This seems to include using those plain IDE cards since the BIOS doesn't note the old PATA IDE interfaces.	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	I purchased a converter to avoid this in the future but for the meantime i was able to take a CD/DVD rom and hook it into an external HD USB connection..... hit F8 on boot and it was recognized.	St
1.6.2	Thanks for the tip on the IDE SATA adapter, should be here soon.	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
1.8.1	It's a decent board at a great price... i assumed a PCI IDE would work but apparently i should've done a little more research.	St
1.8.2	I was just too excited for the chip (6750) that came with it all for $199.	St
1.8.3	Impulse buy.	St
1.8.4	Thank GOD for the external drive and this forum!	St
1.9.1	I like this board.	St
1.9.2	But I see headaches if I did move to this.	St
1.9.3	Bob	St
1.10.1	I'm not buying any MBs without IDE ports, floppy controllers and some of the other legacy stuff.	St
1.10.2	There are just too many other good choices not to have to accept such limitations and overcome the potential problems in the future.	St
1.10.3	Yeah .. there's always a way around ... but I prefer use and have access to stuff I know works easily with anything.	St
1.10.4	SATA is great but many many folks would swear otherwise...especially those with optical drives.	Polite
1.10.5	Maybe they work better in preconfigured systems from the big box mfgs but they seem to present problems for the 'Do-It-Yourselfers'.	St
1.10.6	VAPCMD	St
1.11.1	I think they are pushing it a little..... it would be fine to use if SATA CD/DVD roms weren't so $$$ and few and far between.	St
1.11.2	Maybe in a few years?	St
1.11.3	My bad with the impulse buy but i bet there will be a few others who assume the card will work and be burned by these too.	St
1.11.4	Luckily theres work arounds for now i guess.	St
1.12.1	The price difference was less than a McDonald's meal.	St
1.12.2	Maybe the prices have already started to subside.	St
1.12.3	Or you could use those IDE to SATA adapters if you want to save some dough.	Sug
1.12.4	Bob	St
1.13.1	with no IDE support.	St
1.13.2	Looking at buyer reviews on NEWEGG for SATA DVD drives in the past has done nothing but discourage me from buying SATA optical drives.	St
1.13.3	That said ..	St
1.13.4	I've got other peripherals (and suspect you do too) like PCI IDE controllers that could overcome such problems but lets face, most don't have the extra stuff it might take.	St
1.13.5	Just my 2 cents Keep up the good work.	St
1.13.6	BVAPCMD	St
