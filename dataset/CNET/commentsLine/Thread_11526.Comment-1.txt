machine dell xps 720 running win xp mce 2005, all updates current (recent reinstal) i cannot find driver for my bluetoth dongle.
it is a bluetooth usb adaptor dongle, bta01 from kaito.
they sent bluesoliel, but only online i have to rebuy @ $20, last time i looked.
the whole dongle was less than that.
kaito site is not helpful any ideas?
