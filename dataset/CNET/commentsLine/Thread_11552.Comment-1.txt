using windowsxp svc pak3, internet explorer 8 the la times sudoku and crossword puzzles suddenly stopped showing on my monitor on dec 24. had been coming up with no problem for at least a couple of years.
i figured the times co-ordinator took a christmas break.
the times advises no personnel change, no format change, and finds no problem.
all i get is a red &quot;x&quot;.
am still getting new york times puzzles ok, e-mails ok, all other internet functions ok.
