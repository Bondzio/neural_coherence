external hard drives are ok but there not as good as a burnt cd or dvd.
a hard drive can fail more often than burnt media.
if your really worried about your data on disk's becoming unstable than your not storing it properly.
keep backed up disks in their own jewel case, no stacking!, dark covers help, don't expose them to light for long periods of time, low humidity, moisture, etc.
duplicate copies do exactly what you want, double your chances of saving valuable files.
the only thing hard drive related i can think of for semi safe storage is raid 0+1 which requires 4 hard drives spanned and mirrored.
