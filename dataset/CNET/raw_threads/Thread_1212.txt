However, it ended up being stuck (thanks to the wife)in the office which is about 30 feet from my A/V system (my toy box). I want to find a way to make my computer display and audio transmit wirelessly from the my PC to my receiver 30 feet away. I have a blue tooth keyboard and a remote for the PC and it is in line of site of my lazyboy so I just need the wireless A/V solution. Any ideas? Here are my A/V system component details Pioneer VSX-1015TX Reciever (has everything but HDMI in and out. connected to projector by RGB cables.) Panasonic PT-AE900U High Definition Projector Sony Playstation3 80Gig Motorola DCT6416 III HDMI Dual Tuner DVR cable box 5.1 Platinum surround sound speakers in wall Velodyne DPS-10 Subwoofer Here are my computer system details HP Pavillion m9340f media center it has digital coaxial audio as well as the 6 audio outputs, pink, black, red, orange, yellow and blue. it has HDMI a/v output LCD and CRT output for Video and a number of USB and 1 firewire connection. Please help.
