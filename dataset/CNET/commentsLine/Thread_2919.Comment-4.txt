i run ghost12 on my pc and acronis10 on my laptop, both are image backup utilities so if either hard drive were to fail, i could be up and running in 36 minutes.
how do i know this?
well i did a test run on the pc.
i purchased a new hard drive, took out the working one, put in the new one and did the image transfer.
i am still working from that image backup hd.
the initial hd i re-formatted and used it as my external backup hd for acronis on my laptop.
i know both acronis and ghost cost money, but for me a great investment and over time very reasonably priced i think.
so, i suggest you use image software then never worry about hard drive failure at all
