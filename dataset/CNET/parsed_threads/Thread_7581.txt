<s> I'm setting up my computer to use my living room screen and audio system for when I want to chill on the couch and watch web content, and I'm trying to figure out whether or not I can have both a wireless keyboard and mouse (for chilling) and my regular, wired set (for working) hooked up at the same time. </s>
<s> I'd prefer not to have to use the wireless stuff all the time. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I picked up a Logitech mx710 and it's fine. </s>
<s> However range is iffy past 3 feet. </s>
<s> Find a BLUETOOTH setup to get more distance. </s>
<s> I have two wireless mice and one wireless keyboard both Logitech. </s>
<s> Both mice work. </s>
<s> I don't see why one being wired would make a difference. </s>
