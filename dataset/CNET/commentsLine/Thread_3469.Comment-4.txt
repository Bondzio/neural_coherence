most of the usb ports that came on piii systems less than 1ghz were only usb 1.1. to upgrade to usb 2 you can get an add-on pci card.
my p4 system came with usb 1.1, so i picked up a five port usb 2 pci card and put it in my computer.
it has four external ports and one internal port and cost less than $20 at fry's.
if you are not afraid of working on your own system pick up a card, install the software that comes with it first, and then slipped the pci card into any open slot on your motherboard.
make sure you screw in tightly, move all your usb plugs to the new card and reboot your machine.
as long you as you use the new card you should not see that pesky message again.
