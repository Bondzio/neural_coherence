<s> hi, i bought a new custom computer and everything was going well, until after 1 hour of usage(after instaling windows and a few programs) the computer shuts down, and now i can't even turn it on. </s>
<s> The motherboard led stays on but i can t get a post or a fan spining. </s>
<s> Please Help Pc specs: i5-3570k, asus p8z77-v,Corsair 8 gb 1600 Mhz ram, ocz 700w, Seagate Barracuda ES 750 GB </s>
<s> Time to call them and ask what they want to do to fix it. </s>
<s> It's new, custom so they should be used to such calls. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> by custom i mean i bought it by pieces and build it myself. </s>
<s> Good to know. </s>
<s> Now it's the old call the suppliers up and ask what they want back. </s>
<s> You do take a bit of risk about such building your own machine but all the parts should be in warranty so it's a pain but you are now in the RMA and swap parts till it works again phase. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> the problem is most of the parts form my &quot;new&quot; pc are used including the motherboard and psu... </s>
<s> So if it comes to that i will have a harder time trying to get my money back. </s>
<s> just my luck... </s>
<s> Your top post lead with it being new. </s>
<s> Now it's not new but something else. </s>
<s> It's pretty hard to diagnose as it is but when dealing with dead computers the common advice remains the same. </s>
<s> If in warranty, use the warranty. </s>
<s> If out of warranty you have to decide if you are going to be a PC repair tech. </s>
<s> There are millions of posts about fixing a dead PC. </s>
<s> Basically you swap out the most suspect part. </s>
<s> If you can't tell which part then you use the old advice of &quot;replace the cheapest part first.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> Now that we've heard more about this computer, did you happen to use an old case? </s>
<s> If so, take out the motherboard and remove all and I do mean ALL STANDOFFS that we use to mount the motherboard. </s>
<s> Now only install the ones that are needed. </s>
<s> But first, build the PC on a chunk of cardboard. </s>
<s> If it works there it could be that old issue with an extra standoff. </s>
<s> I've lost count of folk that tell me it can't be this because it worked. </s>
<s> Hopefully you've been around long enough to guess why this matters. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Since this is a build of gathered used and/or some new, you need to rebuild again. </s>
<s> As stated to you, its best to remove and build on some cardboard and check operations that way. </s>
<s> Use a household fan to cool it as added cooling. </s>
<s> If it works for some extended period, like in hrs. </s>
<s> then you then need to check/inspect the case as mentioned. </s>
<s> Note where standoffs are, etc. </s>
<s> and return mtbd. </s>
<s> alone to case. </s>
<s> Tighten screws but don't over do it and make some are grounded if plastic standoffs are used as well. </s>
<s> Understand what PSU you have, is it single or dual rail type. </s>
<s> If dual, balance the load requirements better or replace entirely. </s>
<s> Build the PC as basic as possibel and check results to see how it operates. </s>
<s> Also, just where did it fail after 1hr. </s>
<s> how did it fail, shutdown, froze, didn't respond, still loading s/w, maybe the last action is the culprit. </s>
<s> Don't do any OC'ing if so done, return to defaults. </s>
<s> Have you updated the bios yet before any major installs, etc.? </s>
<s> Was the parts tested elsewhere or do you know its history, etc.. </s>
<s> If you got a good deal at the time, you may now know why, it was an iffy part. </s>
<s> In other words don't take things for granted, you now have to sort things out and test results. </s>
<s> Last, did you apply heatsink paste correctly on cpu as that can be a sign it failed when it got to be too much heat or pushed into a upper heat range. </s>
<s> Further, do all fans or cooling work as intended? </s>
<s> You need to know your &quot;airflow&quot; as some operations may conflict. </s>
<s> It may already bee too late if due to heat stress the weakest link finally gave in and failed. </s>
<s> One thing I have the habit of doing is swapping the PSU out, if during power-ON the cpu fan just twitches or spins for a moment, then nothing. </s>
<s> If it isn't the PSU then that leaves the mtrbd., and any issues arising from operation, NOT good. </s>
<s> So recheck your work as best as possible. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thank you for the post, but i think the mobo is dead, i have tried everything you said and nothing, no post no fan spin no nothing, just a single green power led. </s>
<s> when i tried to reset bios, the bios led started flickering not blinking. </s>
<s> I contacted the seller and he said he would refund. </s>
<s> when i was testing the compouter i wasnt even using a case, the mobo was on top of a anti static bag on top of a box, so that was not the issue. </s>
