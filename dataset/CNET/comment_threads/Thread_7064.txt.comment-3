Bob, Many thanks for your reply.
I am aware of the details contained in your link.
This is the reason that I am enquiring if anyone has any knowledge of a printer that will print the chosen label directly ON to the CD or DVD, and not on to a label to stick onto the CD or DVD.
The reason, also, that I mentioned the details that I did about the printer that I have and the programme that I have been using to print the items.
Kind regards Colinito
