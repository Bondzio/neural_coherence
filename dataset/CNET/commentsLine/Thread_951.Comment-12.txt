hi: i already forgot the technical differences between the two since it was long time ago when i read it.
i use ntfs for many years and have no apparent differences than when i used fat32.
i still had some hdd crashes due to mechnical malfunctions and some problems when os or other applications went wrong.
i simply don't know what would be the difference if those were fat 32, and my guess is the same.
i do, however, notice some applications (not many) do require ntfs partition although just a few and i forgot their names.
in short, my suggestion is to make your life easier and simpler by using just one partition, whichever is fat32 or ntfs.
it is my understand that you could convert fat32 to ntfs but not vice versa (but could be wrong), so i'd choose ntfs (plus all technical benefits, bla bla bla) as the default partition.
