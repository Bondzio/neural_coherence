so basically, it sounds like my mother-in-laws main &quot;needs&quot; for it are very very similar to the gentleman's in the other post you provided the link for.
in the end, he ended up finding a good deal on the hp touchpad for $199 and seems very happy with his purchase, and confirmed it does everything he wanted very well.
is it safe to say then, that with these specific &quot;needs&quot; considered, that forgetting about price since they're all similar, that the hp touchpad is hands down a better quality product?
if so, i can wait and try to catch the deal when they put their last release out, or at very worst, pay basically the same $250 as these other options today and get a better product?
even if i wait, and miss out on the next firesale, i would have to think that all of these other online retailers are still going to be in the $250 range for the hp touchpad.
some of the ones being discussed in the other thread (nook color, etc) were the 7&quot; tablets, and i would really need it to be the 10&quot; so i ruled them out immediately.
