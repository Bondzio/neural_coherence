I wanted to buy a replacement battery for my iPod and found so many options with differing prices, models, and shipping costs, it was hard to tell which site to buy from. Is there a kind of reliable &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; for eTailers that rates them on quality of products, customer service, etc?

My experience with them isn't extensive but they were very prompt. I won't provide the link but google can do it. They are still around and there retailer rating shows as a ten.
