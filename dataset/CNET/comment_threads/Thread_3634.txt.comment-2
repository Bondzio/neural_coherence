&quot;Can anyone explain how a movie file 715mbs in size burns ok with no errors, and NO overburn used,&quot; I am not at your machine and NERO may be set to allow it without complaining about overburn.
OR you are getting binary bytes and decimal bytes indications from software.
Its a legacy issue that 1 BILLION BYTES is not 1 GB, all the time.
Think about it.
