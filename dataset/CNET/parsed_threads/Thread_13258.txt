<s> I stumbled across an old viao notebook with a battered screen. </s>
<s> I opened it up a and removed its hd(Toshiba MK1516GAP 15GB ATA-2/3/4 2.5&quot; 9.5mm Notebook Hard Drive) and placed it into an external portable case USB. </s>
<s> I then connected it to my PC via the USB port and formatted the disk. </s>
<s> I find that anytime i try to write to it i keep getting this message Windows - Delayed Write Failure ------------------------------ Windows was unable to save all the data for file G:,The data has been lost. </s>
<s> This error may be caused by a failure of your computer hardware or network connection. </s>
<s> Please try to save the file elsewhere. </s>
<s> ------------------------------- After this error the device (external hard drive) is automatically unplugged by windows from the system. </s>

<s> What are the spaecs of your pc?What are the specs of your external drive enclosure.I would believe that the write delay error is more than likely USB related.Could be the enclosre requires a USB2 connection and your system is only capable of USB 1.1.You could check to see if there is a chipset update for your PC to update to USB 2.0.If not you need to replace the enclosure with one that is backwards compatible. </s>
<s> Try running scandisk on the drive and let it repair any thing it finds,also try to get ahold of the program &quot;ActiveSmart&quot;.This proogram will test the drive and let you know if it is about to fail.Hope this helps. </s>
