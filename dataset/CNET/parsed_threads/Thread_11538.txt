<s> I broke my USB Belkin N adapter, metal cap went off after I stomp on it accidental(it fell off of my desk)and it may broke the chip, I heard I have the warranties since I brought this early 08 or 09(forgot) and broke it few day ago. </s>
<s> Will Belken willing to replace it or am I SOL and have to buy a new one. </s>
<s> I don't know if they willing to replace it or not since I cant find the warranties information on their site, or how much it will cost? </s>
<s> IF anyone know or have inside info with Belkin please post the information. </s>
<s> I email tech support for information and getting it next week for more information since they dont work on weekend. </s>
<s> now-a-day, I think it's cheaper to just buy another one. </s>
<s> But I hope you get a free replacement from them. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> products that become defective during a specific period of time but, unless accidents are specified as being covered, I suspect you're out of luck. </s>
<s> My guess is that physical damage is considered as abuse or misuse and won't fall under warranty coverage. </s>
