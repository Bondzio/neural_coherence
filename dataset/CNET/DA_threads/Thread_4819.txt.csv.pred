1.1.1	I am wondering if that card is compatible because the HD 4870 is made by a different company.	St
1.2.1	This is why PCI, PCIe and such slots were invented.	St
1.2.2	So we could install cards compatible with the card slot.	Sug
1.2.3	Does your machine have that needed card slot?	St
1.3.1	Yes my machine has one occupied pci-e slot from which I will remove my old card.	St
1.3.2	The HD 4870 stats say that it is PCI-e 2.0 Is that something new?	St
1.4.1	If you look into it, there is no issue here except the usuals.	St
1.4.2	Such as does your machine have the proper sized power supply, does the card fit mechanically, etc.	St
1.5.1	I am purchasing a new power supply (600w) which uses the proper connections for the card.	St
1.5.2	I am not sure about the mechanical fit.	St
