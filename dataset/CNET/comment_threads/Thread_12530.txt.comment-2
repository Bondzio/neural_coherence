Your computer is quite old, it is barely worth spending money on a system that old, but, YES, you could definitely improve the sound dramatically by getting something like a Soundblaster Live with Quad speakers and a subwoofer, the difference would be dramatic and pretty incredible if you bought good speakers.
You can always use the speakers on a new system when you upgrade in the future.
Speakers like the Cambridge SoundWorks run $100 or less for some pretty incredible quadraphonic sound.
