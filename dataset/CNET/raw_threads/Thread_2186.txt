But the first step is to setup encryption. Most will support WEP or WPA, with WPA being the stronger. I would also disable the broadcasting of your SSID, and if you are so inclined, you can go as far as implementing a MAC filter if your equipment supports it. Other advanced features will depend on your equipment. I would also make sure you have changed the default password for your router to something stronger, as the default passwords are published all over the internet.

WPA2 & WPA support the use of a maximum of a 63 character ASCII character PSK or a 64 character hexadecimal. If your equiptment supports the 64 hex, use that. If it doesn't, then use a full 63 character ASCII string as your PSK. If you don't have your own means to randomly generate these values go to www.grc.com and use their &quot;Perfect password generator&quot;. While this may seem complex, it is nonetheless important. If you use something like: peanut Then you are going to get hacked. Use something like: 9F53CD8A5F1C5393AF6A5EFFA4B2299E4C8A5A4318743184D0498EC470BD2465 or ;u,PPs$`Y\Hj\;KXdby+++6i0R?i6K\&lt;&gt;0rx}#Q~HVa X_~*_}z.l@U%IS%o?Cp And you'll be in pretty good shape. I also change my PSK on a regular basis. Hope this helps
