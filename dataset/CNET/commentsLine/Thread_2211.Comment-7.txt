hunh?
what i'm asking is if there are gps chips available that can be added to directly to the mobo or inderectly by way of a pcie slot so i don't risk damaging it when it bounces around in a moving vehicle what does that have to do w/ fcc certs or anything else in your reply?
if you can help/answer my question great i drive for a living and having the chip in my computer makes planning my route/trip a lot easier so does finding the actual address of the customer at either end
