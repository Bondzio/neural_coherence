like 'linkit' suggested ...get to 'disk management' do a right click on one of the cds....and change the drive letter to say &quot;r&quot;.
then do the same to the other cd...make it &quot;s&quot;.
shut down the pc and disconnect the new hdd.
then reboot the pc to to see how the drive letters show up....you should have a &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; plus an &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot;.
if this is the drive line up ....open explorer and right click on &quot;c&quot; on type in a name for &quot;c&quot; in the label box.
do the same for &quot;d&quot;.
now shut down again and reconnect the new hdd..and see what shows up as other than &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; or &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot;.
then you should be able to identify the new hdd and prepare (partition and format) it for use with your system.
keep us posted vapcmd note: the reason i suggest changing the cd-rom drive letters to r and s is to avoid the confusion that develops when you add a new hard drive or hard drives to the system... hdd takes precedence over the cds in drive letter assignments...leaving unused drive letters beteween the hard drive(s) and the cd-rom eliminates the cd-rom drive letters from being bumped/changed in the future.
