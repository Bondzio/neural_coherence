<s> Hi, In the very near future, when all the PS3 buzz settles down, I would like to purchase the PS3 unit along with the Gran Turismo HD (as I've invested in steering wheel/pedal hardware in the past). </s>
<s> And to certainly take advantage of the &quot;high definition&quot; output of the PS3 and GT HD, I would need a 1080i display. </s>
<s> But I don't want to invest a couple of grand in a large 40 or 50-inch family room LCD/Plasma display, but instead would like to upgrade my current ViewSonic 17&quot; CRT monitor and get myself a either a standard or a widescreen LCD computer screen. </s>
<s> If that's the case, would I be able to take the HD (HDMI?) </s>
<s> output of the PS3 and display it on the computer LCD screen? </s>
<s> Would there be a conversion with cables/adaptors that I'd have to use? </s>
<s> The PS3 is already a big investment itself, so I'd like to balance it out with a LCD display that would be used for my regular computer games, internet surfing, digital image editing, etc. </s>
<s> Appreciate anyone's feedback! </s>

<s> does the monitor have. </s>
<s> If it has a DVI connector, then you can use an HDMI to DVI cable. </s>
<s> HDMI carries video and audio. </s>
<s> DVI carries only video. </s>
<s> If the monitor has no digital input you're probably SOL. </s>
<s> as long as you buy a LCD monitor that is HDCP compliant and hook it up using an hdmi-dvi cable you should be fine. </s>
<s> i am building another pc and decided to get a 20inch widescreen lcd and it is hdcp capable and it works just great. </s>
<s> I know this is really late, but I found this post by searching google. </s>
<s> Once I hookup the hdmi to dvi cable and get video, how would you get sound? </s>
<s> Would you just use the white and red cables that came with the TV hookups? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
