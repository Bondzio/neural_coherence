&quot;1680 x 1050 resolutions,&quot; I wonder if ATI's 1280x1024 is not exactly kosher.
To recap.
Must be 60Hz for all settings and watch out on the second number.
-&gt; All this vanished as an issue over HDMI or even DVI to HDMI connections.
Ever since I changed that my kid has yet to ask me to set the resolutions.
