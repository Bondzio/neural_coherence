But the components in your system are all outdated (except for the memory and you won't play high end games like DOOM 3 on this system, at least without lag.
I suggest wait a little until prices drop and you can build yourself a better system.
P.S.
Might as well get a budget system from emachines.
Some have a x16 slot which is great for adding a high end graphics card later.
