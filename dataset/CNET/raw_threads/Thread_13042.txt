I am not a gamer nor do I do a lot of high end processing and don't need a top of line speed or high end video. Prob a dual core. Want to do 2 hard drives. 1 for the OS (may want to do a dual boot) and 1 for evything else. Suggestions appreciated. Thanks

Why not get some PCs from craigslist for free/dirt cheap and just rip them apart and upgrade them? Good will sells all of their PCs for $15. I have see a few P3s there and I still use a P3 as my workstation. (It has 2x15GB IDE drives raided together for a swap file, 512MB Ram, 1x 40gb drive for storage, 1x20gb drive for OS and a DVD burner.) It isn't a speed demon but with a dedicated video card (free) it runs XP nicely.
