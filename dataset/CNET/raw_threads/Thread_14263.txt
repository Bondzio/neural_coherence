The 2 main reasons for that: 1. You learn much more if you do it yourself. 2. Your professor will get much better view of what you know and can (and what you don't know yet or can't do yet). So I'm locking this thread. Kees

By outsourcing the entire thing you don't have to hire any more staff and your network runs at reduced costs. Nothing technical is required as there is no IT staff. Just management of the outsourcing. Bob
