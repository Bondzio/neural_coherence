hey paul, i downloaded the everest file and installed it.
holy cow thats alot of info to sort thru.
maybe you can answer this...i believe you know the history of my issues with overheating of the pny 7600...i'm looking to get another 7600 (suggested by emachines live/sales chat) is it worth it to get a 512mb vs a 256mb card.
on newegg you can get a 512 at a fair price depending if it's gs vs a gt.
thanks, dennis
