ok here goes.
i have tried everything thing i know from true image to new mobo, psu, ram, cpu etc.
even got a new sata hdd to image over and it didn't work either.
originally i had a epox 8kta3+ motherboard with raid 1 and 2 80 gb western digitals.
they are working fine, i can access them through a usb on 2.0 but need them to boot up on the new mobo if possible so i don't have to migrate to vista just yet.
my new mobo is a gigabyte ga-ma7gm-s2h.
it has raid on board with sata too but not working right with these old hdd's.
any suggestions would be apprecaited.
