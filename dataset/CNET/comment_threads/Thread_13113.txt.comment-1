Hey guys, here's my question: I had 3GB of 800 MHz RAM running in my computer.
I guess I decided that I had some money to waste or something so I upgraded it to 4GB (1x4) of 1066 MHz.
I understand that with the limitations of a 32 bit operating system I won't get the full 4GB, but my RAM is downclocked from 1066 to 667.
Why?
I tried installing them all individually to make sure I didn't have a bad stick, and I even returned them and got a new batch, same deal.
Any thoughts?
