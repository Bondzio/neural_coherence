1.1.1	I know some motherboards have problems supporting drives of large sizes.	St
1.1.2	I was thinking of buying a 200 GB harddrive and throwing it in a USB 2.0 enclosure.	St
1.1.3	I was wondering if it will be supported no matter what since it's coming in through the USB ports or will it still depend on my motherboard?	St
1.2.1	For example, all Windows 2000 CDs as well as most XP (Pro/Home) CDs will not install and support your 200GB USB 2.0 drive until patches, updates and in the case of Windows 2000, a registry change is made.	St
1.2.2	USB 1.1 support may be problematic since many USB drive cases omitted USB 1.1 support.	St
1.2.3	http://www.48bitlba.com notes part of the issues as well so you can get a complete picture of the problems.	St
1.2.4	Cheers, Bob	Polite
