<s> I am needing to replace my old CAT5 patch cables in my comms room does anyone have a suggestion as to what are the best brand of cables to buy. </s>
<s> I will be buying different colours depending on the job I am asking each cable to do. </s>
<s> Thanks in Advance </s>
<s> This is a product like milk. </s>
<s> You see brands at the store but all go fine with cheerios. </s>
<s> The only thing you may want to do is to buy the normal as well as a &quot;crossover&quot; type so you know you have both types handy. </s>

<s> Thanks for the reply Bob the reason I asked was I was told that some of the cheaper pre cut cable is assembled in places like Tiwan or China and they do not test there cables properly. </s>
<s> We buy ours from geeks.com and found one bad one in some thousand. </s>
<s> I guess some would consider that unacceptable. </s>

<s> Cat 5e Patch Cables will do the trick if all your other cabling is Cat 5 or Cat 5e. </s>
<s> You will only be as good as the weakest part of your cabling network. </s>
<s> I would match up with at least Cat 5e. </s>
<s> These guys have them starting at $.79/ea. </s>
<s> and in lengths from 6 inches to 150 ft. and in 9 different colors http://www.showmecables.com/Cat-5e-Cat-6-Products.html </s>
<s> Barry, i know I'm getting here late on this one but here's a link to our website that provides more cable options than you could dream of. </s>
