7705	0	264788	2587924	NR	asrichman	9/19/07 9:06 AM	1.19019276E12	Can I stream drawings live?	This seems simple, but I can't figure out how to do it. I am a math tutor. I want to be able to tutor online. This means I want to be able to write equations and graphs freehand and have my students see what I am writing. And I want to be able to see what they are writing. I am currently using webcams pointed at paper streaming via Skype. This is OK, but pretty blurry. It seems that streaming drawings from a graphics tablet or something would be clearer, but I can't figure out the proper hardware/software configuration. I appreciate any ideas. Thanks, Andrew

Snapz Pro X2 I have used it to create step by step video lessons of how to create certain projects on my desktop. I don't know if it is any good for real time video streaming, but it would allow you to create high res videos for download and playback. You can use skype for later class discussions. grim
