<s> I recently bought a emachines and was thinking of upgrading the graphics to the x700 pro, when you install the graphics card do you have to disable the onboard graphics first, and i was also wondering if i would notice a difference in upgrading the memory to 1gb, right now it only has 512mb? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> You can do this either in Hardware Manager or in the BIOS. </s>
<s> Your machine should then use a generic display until you install the new card. </s>
<s> Also, since 128 MB is dedicated to onboard graphics on the T6212, disabling it will free up the memory so right away you'll have 512 MB. </s>
<s> If you do add memory, don't make the mistake I made and do the following; (1) check eMachines website for recommended memory (they recommend Crucial, Kingston, Geil and a few others) and (2) MAKE SURE TO BUY THE MEMORY IN PAIRS. </s>
<s> The mistake I made with the T6212 was buying a 1 GB stick. </s>
<s> The memory only registered as 1.25 GB instead of the expected 1.5 GB. </s>
<s> The documentation tells you this, but who ever reads that stuff?! </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
<s> 6600GT is rated better than x700 pro. </s>
<s> this is fyi. </s>
<s> but if u have already done the comparison and decided to go with ati..have fun. </s>
