hi it is almost impossible to find a pc laptop or desktop that does not come with a built in/ integrated graphics card.
most are pretty good however i would try to stay clear of integrated cards that use shared memory.
i have seen this system by many names including hyper memory.
simply put the builders of the laptop/desktop have taken a cheap route and built there system to share the computers ram.
the integrated card has no ram of its own and must share the resources of the computers ram.
this is ok but can cause your computer to slow down drastically when its working complex tasks.
the better systems have there own ram attached to the integrated graphics card.
if you are just after a system for word processing etc then shared memory systems are fine.
for everything else get a machine with a dedicated graphics card with onboard memory.
