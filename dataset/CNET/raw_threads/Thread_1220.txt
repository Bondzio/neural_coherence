The problem is that Im a poor collage student so I dont have the mega-bucks to spend on the project. Im torn between the Hauppauge wintv-150 and the ati TV wonder elite. I know that the ati card has a better picture than the 150 but I dont think my pc can handle it. The newest OS I have to run on this machine is Windows 2000 pro. My machine has a 1 GHz pIII processor and as much ram as I can put in it. Bottom line I just dont wont to waste money on something with poor resolution. I also welcome alternatives

I believe 1.6GHz is the normal cutoff point for MPEG-2 recording, so your box will probably only be capable of encoding in MPEG-1, which leaves a little to be desired in terms of resolution quality.
