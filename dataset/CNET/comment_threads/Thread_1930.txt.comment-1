I bought this HARD DRIVE internal seagate 2TB green caviar last week.
I transferred more or less 1TB size of files to this new hard disk without hassle.
I noticed that when i set this as a directory for my completed downloads in uTorrent, it suddenly disappear on my computer icon.
i check the device manager and it is no longer there.
i also went looking in the storage management but it wasn't there.
I try to restart my PC and it go back to normal.
After this incident, i can no longer transfer file to this new hard drive because it keeps on disappearing and i have to restart my PC over and over again.
Today, the worst thing happen, because it is no longer appearing on my device manager.
pls help me folks.
