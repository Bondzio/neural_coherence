Thanks for the info.
Ive cleaned the rollers with ethanol but it hasn't helped.
I don't think it is excess ink as the lines are consistant throughout.
I have taken a photo of a printout which shows the lines, could I email this to you or somebody else in hope that you can see what the problem is ?
Thanks Ste
