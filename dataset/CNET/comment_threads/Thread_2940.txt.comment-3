I found a similar situation with my WiFi laptop.
I had been to another person's house to help her set up some wireless equipment - Linksys in this case.
The Linky equipment comes from the factory with &quot;Linksys&quot; as the default SSID, so we had to work with that long enough to get to the administration pages and change it to something more secure.
However, my WinXP system &quot;remembers&quot; having been to an access point named &quot;Linksys&quot; in case it ever has to associate with it again.
Back at home, there is no such access point, never was (I don't have any Linky WiFi stuff, but that's a different discussion), and none of my nearby neighbors either.
But whenever I take down my primary WiFi network and put up a substitute (for testing and other reasons), the dialog boxes of the wireless zero configuration utility on my WinXP system always include opportunities to re-establish contact with that non-existent &quot;Linksys&quot; access point.
I suppose I could do some down deep and dirty editing of the registry to find and delete that little devil, but it hardly seems worth the risk of turning a working system into a boat anchor.
