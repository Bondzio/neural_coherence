you used the new cable that came with the drive and connected it to the existing drive.
in that case disconnect it and reconnect the drive to the cable that is connected on the old drive (the center connection) and set it as a slave drive.
if you have two such cables (pata connections)one of which is connected to the hard drive and have a free center connection (secondary drive) use the connection that goes to the hard drive.
it's better to have the cd/dvd drives on separate ide connections.
hope this solves your problem, let's know how you get on, john
