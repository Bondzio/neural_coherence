What I'd try is disconnecting the DSL router and trying 192.168.0.1 again to get into the router and set it up to give out addresses in some other range (10.0.0.0 is a good range)

In closing, my di-524 was almost tossed until Dlink issued new firmware. At this stage of the discussion I can only share that ... a. 192.168.0.1 is the documented default address. b. My 650 card was never quite right. Tossed it. c. The latest firmware in the 524 did wonders for it. Bob
