If you read these forums and others, just about any PC makers will have problems. PCs are so pushed out the door, anything can happen. If your comfort level suggests everything is OK in that model#, get one. IMO, Gateway is just another builder and overall isn't that bad. I would put it above HP and Compaq for instance but less than Dell. yet, you'll hear alot of bad press on Dell, yet the numbers suggest they too provide for the most part a decent system. Sorry, that's about as much bravo I can say about any PC out there. You should review the return policy and/or warranty to see what you're getting into. tada -----Willy

Here are links to the article and the chart on the ratings: http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2368154,00.asp http://www.pcmag.com/image_popup/0,1871,iid=267317,00.asp You have not stated how you will use the computer or what price range. If you are looking for a low end model, then one of the large manufacturers options will provide the most bang for the buck. However, you also generally get low grade components, a small PSU which limits upgrades, oftern not being able to add a decent graphics card, and bloatware. If you want an intermediate level to above machine and/or want to avoid the above limitations, then I strongly recommend a custom build from CyberPower. Note that they evaluated on the reliability list linked above and rank higher than all other prebuilt systems except Apple. If interested in this option, you go to there site and select the components. This will take a little more work since you have to pick the components, but that can be a fun process too. For help, take a look at this link I just posted to earlier: http://forums.cnet.com/7723-7586_102-517823.html?tag=threadListing;forum-threads If you want to add or upgrate the graphics card for any of these systems, you can find helpful guidance and other resources at this site: http://www.upgradevideocards.com/index.html
