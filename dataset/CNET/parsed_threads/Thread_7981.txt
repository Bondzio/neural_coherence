<s> I would like to upgrade my video card from my Nvidia Geforce FX5200. </s>
<s> What would be a reasonable Nvidia uprade for my system in the $100-$150 range? </s>
<s> I am concerned about compatability and cooling. </s>
<s> System: Pentium 4 3.2Ghz, 3 Gig RAM, motherboard Intel D865GLC. </s>
<s> I am unsure of wattage of power supply. </s>
<s> Three things to take into account: 1. </s>
<s> Available slots: AGB, PCI or PCI-E. Wrong type won't fit at all. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Power supply. </s>
<s> If you're unsure, how can we know? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Cooling. </s>
<s> If this is an XP machine, 3 Gb RAM doesn't make much sense probably (depending on what you do with the machine). </s>
<s> But it doesn't harm either. </s>

<s> You have to see if AGP is available. </s>
<s> After that, choose from this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/11/06/best_graphics_card/ If you can't tell what the power supply is then replace it at the same time with a monster. </s>

<s> I checked the innards and it is an AGP slot, 300 watt power supply. </s>
<s> Recommendations? </s>
<s> I've been looking for AGP video cards and I see most newer cards use the PCI express interface. </s>
<s> Maybe I just need to wait a few years and replace the PC. </s>
<s> It is 4 years old. </s>
<s> AGP cards are in that list and you can find 450+ Watt power supplies that will do nicely. </s>
<s> I don't see what's stopping you now. </s>
