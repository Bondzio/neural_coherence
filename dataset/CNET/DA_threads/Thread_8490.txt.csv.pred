1.1.1	Okay, so Im due for a new computer.	St
1.1.2	I currently have a dell desktop.	St
1.1.3	Pentium 4 w/HT, 1gb RAM.	St
1.1.4	I get alot of lag when downloading even 2 bit torrents at once... like ALOT!	St
1.1.5	I would like to be able to download 3 or 4 at the same time and be able to multitask and use other programs on my computer without the lag.	St
1.1.6	I know its not my internet connection, speedtest.net says Im at 30mb per second.	St
1.1.7	If I get a computer with a Intel Core?	St
1.1.8	i3-550 Processor (4M Cache, 3.20 GHz) and 4GB of RAM, will there be much lag when multitasking while downloading 3 or 4 torrents at once?	St
1.2.1	I'd be duplicating the web here but the i3 is like 2 P4 H4 CPUs.	St
1.2.2	Most lag is due to the APP and not the CPU for the tasks you are asking about.	St
1.2.3	Then again, the number of times I find malware on torrent user machines is not funny.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
