Yes you have the situation correct.
So, if I buy another wireless print server (linksys wireless print server)like the one I already have (802.11g) and connect to a compatable printer (Epson R300) or (Hp 5440) I can print wireless downstairs from my wireless network upstairs as a stand alone?
Thanks for the advise.
