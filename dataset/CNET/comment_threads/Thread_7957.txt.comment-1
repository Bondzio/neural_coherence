I have a wired network using a Linksys hub a P4 with XP pro and a P2 (laptop) with win98.
The internet access is through the P4.
Messenger will sign on using the P4 but will not sign on using the P2.
I can access all other MSN pages.
Also, on the P2, eBay will let me sign on but will not allow me to d/l the items for sale just the categories.
Can anyone help?
Thanx Woody
