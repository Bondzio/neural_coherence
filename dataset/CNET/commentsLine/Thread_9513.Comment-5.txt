are you sure your motherboard supports hd's larger than 31.4gb and if you have been changing jumpers on your hd make sure you havent set the jumper over the 32gb limiting pins, its easily done.
if your motherboard doesnt support large hdd's then you will need to flash update it, check that out at the mb's homesite....
