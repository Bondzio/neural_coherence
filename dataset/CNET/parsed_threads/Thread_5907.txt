<s> I recently installed a small network and it worked with no problems for a week or so. </s>
<s> After the first week, they noticed a slow down in network bandwidth, only when accessing their database (running on Windows XP Pro, with all updaters and patches installed). </s>
<s> All other network trafic runs fine, and there is no reason that only access to the database is slow. </s>
<s> It speeds up if all computers are shut compleatly down and started back up. </s>
<s> It will run fine for about a day, then slow back down. </s>
<s> Their network setup is below. </s>
<s> 1 server (Dell Optiplex GX270, WinXP Pro, P4 running at 3.00 GHz, 512 MB RAM) 4 workstations (3 Dell Deminsion 2400, WinXP Pro, P4 running at 2.80 GHz, 256 MB RAM; 1 Home built, WinXP Home, Athlon XP running at 2500+, 480 MB RAM) 1 Linksys EtherFast Cable/DSL Router (Model #: BEFSR81, Set to run PPoE for SBC/Yahoo DLS service) If you need more information, please reply and I will post the information you need. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Are you sure a worm/trojan or spyware hasn't found its way onto the machines? </s>
<s> Just FYI, some drivers do that slowdown after it goes into standby and back. </s>
<s> Unless you strongarm the maker, usually you have to disable standby. </s>

<s> I've ran Norton AntiVirus and the systems came up clean. </s>
<s> How would you find out what devices go into standby, and how do you disable that feature? </s>
<s> It's in the Power Control Panel applet. </s>
<s> There's also that other tweak I apply to all 2000/XP machines worth noting. </s>
<s> Here's the link -&gt; http://www.computerbb.org/about93.html This notes the directory upsize and the checking for scheduled tasks on the remote machine. </s>
<s> Check this one and the links at the bottom: http://www.ss64.com/nt/slow_browsing.html As to Norton, that's not enough. </s>
<s> Try a web based scan like Housecall and make sure that no Parasites are installed with a scan of Adaware. </s>
