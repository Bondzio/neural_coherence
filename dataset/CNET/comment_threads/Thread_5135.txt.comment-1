My question is would it really be worth it to add a GB of ram to my laptop.
right now my Acer TravelMate 8104WLMi has 1 GB of ram and i'm considering upgrading towards two.
I'm no expert or anything on Ram so im not sure that if i just went to a store and bought some that it would be compatible with my machine.
under the description on my computer it says it has 1GB DDR2 533 (support Dual Channel).
whatever that all means.
i went to kingston.com and http://www.crucial.com/systemscanner/ when i do a scan it offers me a kit thats described like this 2GB kit (1GBx2) CT540887 DDR2 PC2-5300 CL=5 Unbuffered NON-ECC DDR2-667 1.8V 128Meg x 64 For a little over $100.
i was wondering if this would be worth the time and money.
any help would be great
