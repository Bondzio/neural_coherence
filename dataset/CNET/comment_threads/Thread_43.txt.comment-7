This is a low-level hardware issue cause by: Memory errors that may include parity or Error Correction Code (ECC) problems Cache errors in the processor or hardware Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLB) errors in the processor Other CPU-vendor specific detected hardware problems Vendor-specific detected hardware problems First, you'll need bios v 0310 (a beta bios) to support your CPU and RAM.
http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx?SLanguage=en-us&model=P5N32-SLI%20Deluxe The &quot;stock&quot; bios is not fully compatible with either.
From ASUS' spec sheet: CPU: Socket775 for Intel Pentium Processor Extreme Edition / Pentium D / Pentium 4 / Celeron CPU Memory: Dual channel memory architecture 4 x 240-pin DIMM sockets support max.
16GB DDR2 667/533 non-ECC memory You could try manually setting your RAM to DDR2-667 since DDR2-800 can be problematic even on boards with explicit support.
Lastly, the p5n32 has been known to be troublesome with dual core intel CPUs since its release.
IMHO, you be best off exchanging the board for one based on the intel 946, 965 or 975 chipset.
