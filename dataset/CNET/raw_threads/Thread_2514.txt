Sounds ludicrously powerful: Microsoft Operating System Genuine Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit- English 1.8GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX260 graphics card Memory 6GB 1066MHz (3x2GB) Tri Channel Memory Hard Drive 640 GB Serial ATA non Raid (7200 Rpm) But would all applications/games etc work on the 64-bit windows?

That's in the Windows 7 forum so unless you have a SPECIFIC title to explore the answer is that &quot;all applications/games etc&quot; WILL NOT &quot;work on the 64-bit windows&quot; but most of them will. Will 99% be enough?

But it sounds like win7 is pretty compatible with older software so it should be ok I think (I'll check the microsoft page for updates) thx xmrb2003x
