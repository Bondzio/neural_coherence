I'm reluctant to buy anything from a new place if I haven't heard anything good about them you know. thanks for all the help, at least it means they are still out there.

For myself, if looking for a mobo for a specific CPU, I would go to tomshardware and anandtech sites and look at their writeups. I liked Abit mobos because their manuals are written a little better than most others. Prefer Gigabyte mobos but more expensive, and terrible to try to communicate via their support. For an Intel CPU, I would prefer to get a non Intel mobo but one with the Intel chipset. Not sure that there is one with all the features that you want. Intel mobos give no extras, but their chipsets virtually assure compatibility.
