you can have 2 pc's with 2 monitors controlled by one keyboard and 1 mouse.
the speed of switching depends on what kind of kvm you get.
there are kvm switches that can work with ps/2 or usb keyboards and mice.
the ps/2 kvm switch switches between pc's faster than the usb version (1 second vs. 3-4 seconds) because with the usb version, the pc you switch to has to re-recognize the device vis usb.
