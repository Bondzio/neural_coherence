1.1.1	Is it possible to buy a blu ray optical drive for a laptop and swap it out for the standard dvd drive ?	Ques
1.1.2	are there additional requirements ( besides HD screen ) needed on the machine to play blu ray discs ?	Ques
1.1.3	if so , where would i be able to purchase a drive ?	Ques
1.1.4	thanks	Polite
1.2.1	OK I ca n't find the make , model of the laptop so I 'll give the short version .	St
1.2.2	1 .	St
1.2.3	Sony made blu ray .	St
1.2.4	*hint* 2. http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16827118046 3 .	St
1.2.5	But to play blu ray we need player software as there is no open source or free version .	St
1.2.6	Try this - & gt ; http : //www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdvd/overview_en_US.html Many laptops use SATA for that drive but with only what I read in this post I ca n't offer much else .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	Okay thanks , I am thinking about doing this with a Toshiba Satellite model but I do n't know how I 'd find a drive that would match it 's current DVD drive .	St
1.3.2	So I would indeed need to purchase blu ray capable software as well ?	Ques
1.4.1	I think I see it 's a Toshiba Satellite but with over a decade of models I ca n't say all will accept this drive .	St
1.4.2	As to the software , you dont have to buy that .	St
1.4.3	It 's only needed for playing Blu ray discs .	St
1.4.4	Bob PS .	St
1.4.5	Sorry if this upsets anyone .	St
1.4.6	But without the model or better yet a link to the model 's home page you will have to figure it out .	St
1.5.1	You gave no clue as to the laptop model # involved here .	St
1.5.2	If this is an older laptop , then I would n't wste time on this .	St
1.5.3	You need to be 100 % sure the new BD drive fits and uses the same i/f the laptop offers .	St
1.5.4	When , I say fit that also means not only the size but that any cabling/harness will be proper .	St
1.5.5	This in not a done deal until that is known and quite frankly this is n't as open to be provided by the specs as one would think , so its a gamble .	St
1.5.6	Have the old DVD drive in hand to compare .	St
1.5.7	As stated to you the player s/w is going to be needed if you want BD viewing .	St
1.5.8	You should look for the & quot ; bundled package & quot ; for this as usually it 's included or full retail kit .	St
1.5.9	Do n't fall for the cheap offering which is called , the & quot ; white box & quot ; or sold as h/w ( drive ) only .	St
1.5.10	FYI , most new laptops do n't even offer BD even though its been awhile already .	St
1.5.11	It 's never really took off , IMO .	St
1.5.12	You maybe better served looking at ext .	St
1.5.13	BD playing setups , which in turn can be used on a desktop as well or move on to yet a better laptop when presented .	St
1.5.14	http : //www.google.com/search ? rlz=1C1_____enUS373US374 & amp ; sourceid=chrome & amp ; ie=UTF-8 & amp ; q=free+BD+player tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	Sorry , it 's a Toshiba Satellite A665-S5177X 15.6-Inch Laptop if that helps	St
1.7.1	SATA interface and what looks to be a standard bezel .	St
1.7.2	Some quibble if the bezel is not exact but this is as good as it gets .	St
1.8.1	so if I want to actually play blu ray discs with it , I could purchase that drive and I would still need some type of blu-ray-playing software , correct ?	Ques
1.9.1	I thought that was answered .	St
1.9.2	If yes is not enough then try it without to see if you can save a buck .	Res
1.9.3	BTW , I did n't comment on the laptop .	St
1.9.4	NICE CHOICE .	St
1.9.5	I like the CPU choice ( i5 ) and with that you have the oomph to decode BD .	St
1.9.6	Bob	St
1.10.1	Sorry , it 's not the cost of the software I am worried about , I am just trying to make sure I have what I need .	St
1.10.2	You had mentioned above & quot ; As to the software , you dont have to buy that .	St
1.10.3	It 's only needed for playing Blu ray discs. & quot ; but I do n't know why else I would want to install a BD drive if I was n't going to play discs with it .	St
1.10.4	Thanks for the replies !	St
1.11.1	There is such as thing as Bluray DATA discs .	St
1.11.2	And some folk already have the software .	St
1.11.3	Glad you got your answers .	St
1.11.4	Bob	St
1.12.1	Got it , Thanks again .	St
