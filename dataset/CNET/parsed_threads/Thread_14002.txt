<s> I am planning to but a external HDD, I read the specification it say formatted to &quot;FAT32&quot;. </s>
<s> I did a further research and came to know it cannot store files more than 4GB unless I convert the drive into NTFS. </s>
<s> I have couple of movies in HD (~5GB each). </s>
<s> I will be using the drive mostly with Windows XP and Vista systems, and occasionally with Mac 1. </s>
<s> Is converting to NTFS a good idea? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> IS NTFS better then FAT32? </s>
<s> If yes, then why the manufacturer is not selling the drive in NTFS? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Any issues with NTFS format? </s>
<s> it's because it is more universal (almost any OS can read them). </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> That depends on the device that you will use it on. </s>
<s> If all can read and write to ntfs then it's a very good idea. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I think you can say that. </s>
<s> 3. none that I can think of. </s>
<s> I am planning to reformat my HDD to NTFS.... didnt find any issues with NTFS... (still did not understood.. why manufacturer does not gives it in NTFS) </s>
<s> you may be able to use the &quot;convert&quot; command and not need to reformat the drive. </s>
<s> If you have data on the drive, it should be safe but you do want to back it up anyway. </s>
<s> I know XP and Win 7 can do this. </s>
<s> I don't know about Vista but presume it can do so also. </s>
