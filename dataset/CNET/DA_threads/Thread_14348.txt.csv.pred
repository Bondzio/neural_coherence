1.12.2	What good then would be restoration data that are effectively beyond reach ?	Ques
1.13.1	I would think that the number one reason for not using an online backup service is as Steven said above : Companies come ... .companies go .	St

1.13.3	With something of this importance , I will never trust anyone other than myself ... ..and even then I 'm kinda leery of that .	St
1.13.4	: ) )	St
1.14.1	I would not feel comfortable at all using an online backup service .	St
1.14.2	For one , hackers know people are using these services to keep their data safe - so why should they worry on trying to hack into personal computers , when they can simply hack one site and gain data from hundreds or thousands of users .	St
1.14.3	I work for a defense contractor , and it 's pretty surprising and interesting to see the queries people run on our external customer-facing site , as well as on other sites like social networks to try and get to sensitive information .	St
1.14.4	A backup service site would be like a dream come true for a hacker .	St
1.14.5	At home and my personal business , I recently purchased a Mac Mini server , and it does a great job at backing up all my information .	St
1.14.6	I 've recovered information from Time Machine backups before ( twice this year already ) , and it 's truly amazing how not even a single file is lost when recovering over time machine .	St
1.14.7	I ca n't wait to experience the full power of OS X Server backups working together with Time machine .	St
1.14.8	I 'm not saying it 's the best solution - someone can still steal an HDD from the rack mount or steal the Mac Mini server , but it 's safer than online services .	St
1.14.9	For those in a PC environment , I would highly suggest a Windows Home Server ( WHS ) to backup your precious data , you never know when someone might & quot ; borrow & quot ; your laptop for good ( that brings about a different topic - encrypt your computer HDD 's or SSD 's and/or use LoJack for laptops ) , or when an HDD might fail .	St
1.15.1	With just a little discipline , it 's more cost effective to backup yourself .	St
1.15.2	For the price of an on-line service for a year , one can about acquire a USB hard drive for backup purposes .	St
1.15.3	It helps if one has developed a discipline in how original files are stored .	St
1.15.4	In my case , & quot ; My Documents & quot ; is the critical folder containing all priceless business documents .	St
1.15.5	It gets backed up every weekend .	St
1.15.6	Using it to restore files is a breeze and one does n't have to be concerned about security over a public network .	St
1.15.7	A backup service offers one advantage ; off-site storage of critical files in case of fire or theft .	St
1.15.8	If this were a major concern for me , then I would n't hesitate to go for an on-line service .	St
1.15.9	One backup I highly recommend comes when one buys a new computer .	St
1.15.10	Get a second hard-drive or other storage and IMMEDIATELY CLONE the original drive and store the backup .	St
1.15.11	Most new internal drives come with cloning software .	St
1.15.12	It creates a backup disk that can restore your operating system with ease .	St
1.15.13	The utility restoration discs that came with my last desktop DO NOT WORK .	St
1.15.14	A clone works every time .	St
1.16.1	My data is private .	St
1.16.2	I do not trust strangers with my private data .	St
1.17.1	Never .	St
1.17.2	I would n't put that data on an external drive , then take it with me , walk down the street , and hand it to the third stranger I happened to encounter -- so why do the cyberspace equivalent , and hand over your data to someone you 've never even seen , and would n't know how to contact if he shut his website down ?	Ques
1.17.3	Far smarter , and safer , to take your data and give it to a randomly-selected homeless person .	St
1.17.4	At least then you would not only know what the guy holding your data looks like , but also you know at least one place where you might find him , if you have to .	St
1.17.5	And yes , the increased possibility that the government , or some agency thereof , will seize your data is also something to think about very seriously .	St
1.17.6	Remember how easy it was for the government to set up its & quot ; Carnivore & quot ; project , so that every email you send or receive can be grabbed by the government with no due process issues whatsoever ?	Ques
1.17.7	Face it , people -- if you have a firewall protecting your computer , and/or security of whatever kind protecting your home network , did you ever wonder WHY you thought those were good things to have ?	Ques
1.17.8	Before you send all your data to strangers who have no reason to care about you , why not just take down your home network security , delete whatever firewalls you have , and put a message to the whole world , on your Facebook page , telling all the government and private-enterprise hackers in the world , & quot ; Come and get it ! & quot ; ?	Ques
1.17.9	That would be far cheaper than paying some stranger to store your data on his servers , and not the smallest bit more stupid , either .	St
1.18.1	Seems to be the answer , & I agree .	St
1.18.2	What if they lose it , than what ?	Ques
1.18.3	Oops , sorry ?	Ques
1.18.4	That 's only one thing , what about someone ( who you do n't know ) having access to your files ?	Ques
1.18.5	No , the best thing is off site & redundant .	St
1.18.6	A hard drive is the best as discs tend to lose their ability to hold data very well .	St
1.18.7	Except maybe gold RAM discs or high end discs like that .	St
1.18.8	The more important it is to you , the more you 'll protect it .	St
1.19.1	No reason to & quot ; trust & quot ; such a service .	St
1.19.2	One , I have no requirement for such a service particularly given the very affordable price of backup/removable storage devices .	St
1.19.3	Storage devices the size of a PDA easily fit in my laptop bag ( if I need to carry more data than my laptop can hold or require backup for critical data ) .	St
1.19.4	And I just do n't like the idea of my personal or professional data on a server I do n't control .	St
1.19.5	Call me old fashioned , but this idea just has no appeal to me whatsoever .	St
1.20.1	I use an online service as well as a local hard drive .	St
1.20.2	Online gives me the advantage of off site backup .	St
1.21.1	No thanks , I 'll maintain my own data at my place , thank you very much First of all , online backup implies : ( 1 ) that you have a high speed data line , ( 2 ) that the service providers are honest ( and wo n't use your data for & quot ; ill & quot ; purposes ) , ( 3 ) that it 's cost effective ( I think it 's NOT ) , ( 4 ) that the service providers will be around when you NEED those backups , and last but not least , ( 5 ) that your ISP and line will be UP when you need to retrieve that data .	St
1.21.2	I maintain several websites , and frankly , my money is on externally connected USB hard drives .	St
1.21.3	They are fairly inexpensive and they can hold 1TB , and even more , these days .	St
1.21.4	True , they can fail , but if they do , you always have your data in at least 2 places , so it 's not likely that both will fail at the same time .	St
1.21.5	Also , if you truely need additional redundancy , you can always purchase MULTIPLE external hard drives .	St
1.21.6	If your PC dies , all you have to do is disconnect the drive and plug it into the USB port on another computer .	St
1.21.7	It 's portable too !	St
1.22.1	using it as a backup , I answered that way .	St
1.22.2	I agree that it 's not smart to consider such as failsafe as a sole backup scheme .	St
1.22.3	It 's not backup but temporary storage no matter how you look at it .	St
1.22.4	Secure does n't only mean that someone ca n't look at your documents .	St
1.22.5	It must also mean they can not take them and dispose of them .	St
1.22.6	Backup is , IMO , not a method but a plan with many contingencies .	St
1.22.7	It 's also a lot of work and only as good as a recovery plan .	St
1.22.8	How many times does one hear that a hard drive has gone bad , everything is backed up but I do n't know how to retrieve my data from backup .	St
1.23.1	I 'm still studying the worthiness of using an online backup service as I have a desire to have a non-physical area backup and a local external drive backup .	St
1.24.1	I would not use these services for several reasons : 1 .	St
1.24.2	You expose your data to hacking .	St
1.24.3	I know that they employ encryption but even the most sophisticated password can be broken .	St
1.24.4	Those Bulgarians are GOOD at it .	St
1.24.5	2 .	St
1.24.6	Transmission to and from your PC can only be accomplished at the speed of your Internet connection .	St
1.24.7	This can be genuinely burdensome when we 're talking about the volume of data in a decent full backup .	St
1.24.8	3 .	St
1.24.9	What happens if the companies fail ?	Ques
1.24.10	Where does your data go then ?	Ques
1.24.11	4 .	St
1.24.12	The price of even the largest capacity external USB drives has become quite affordable .	St
1.24.13	You can find special offers now where you can get 1 Terabyte drives in the $ 60s and 2 Terabyte drives in the $ 170s now , and the prices are falling fast .	St
1.24.14	This should be adequate for any backup needs even for multiple computers .	St
1.24.15	Your data will always be in your exclusive possession , always accessible to you on a file-by-file basis , and your transfer speeds will be orders of magnitude higher than anything you might do via the Internet .	St
1.25.1	I spend time and money to keep my information safe and in my own hands .	St
1.25.2	Why should I trust anyone or special location in cyber space with all of my information that is out there just sitting there for a hacker ?	Ques
1.25.3	When the federal government ca n't protect their data , why should I believe some company will be able to stop all attacks ageist them ?	Ques
1.25.4	I guess I favor a stand-a-lone hard drive to keep my backup safe .	St
1.25.5	At least I can keep it off for the network and store it in a fire proof safe .	St
1.26.1	Steven..	St
1.26.2	Thanks , you saved me a lot of typing .. and said pretty much exactly what I would say about off-site Storage or backup of my data.. yes , I do store some stuff & quot ; in the cloud & quot ; ( I HATE that term ) .. but it is on my own , Private FTP server , NOT with some commercial entity.. Tech companies get bought and sold more often than people change their underwear..	St
1.26.3	I would NEVER trust ANY of these third-party & quot ; back-up your computer on our servers & quot ; outfits with any of my data , my email , my photos , documents , or any other sensitive , personal files..	St
1.26.4	Put another way.. imagine you 're going on a trip.. would you hand the key to your home to someone you do n't know who says & quot ; Trust me , I 'll take in the papers and mail , and water your plants and yadda yadda & quot ; ?	Ques
1.26.5	Hardly.. well , backing up your computer to some company 's server , just because they have a & quot ; Privacy Policy & quot ; that tries to make you feel all warm and fuzzy and secure about it is no different.. they could be bought out tomorrow by some other outfit.. and who knows where your data is gon na end up , sniffed and snooped by who knows who for whatever reason , privacy policies notwithstanding.. as far as I 'm concerned , they 're written in pencil and are meaningless.. You can get a 1 tb external hard drive for about $ 75.00 these days..	St
1.26.6	So call me paranoid..	St
1.26.7	I 've been called worse , but I 'm not going to use any online back-up service over whom I have NO control for every reason you listed , and a bunch more I could think of..	St
1.27.1	Me trust someone else with my data so one day it can be held for ransom ?	Ques
1.27.2	I store my own data online and if you do it right its cheaper ... How ?	Ques
1.27.3	Ever bought a web hosting package , your ftp service server gives you gigs of space to store and share your files ... Actually that 's all it really is ... a FTP server .	St
1.27.4	lol	St
1.28.1	Having been a Director of Data Processing for a large Community College and a retired senior Military officer I believe Security would be blown	St
1.29.1	Years ago there was a website based in Canada , Photopoint I believe and they stored Photos for Free .	St
1.29.2	Many Computer Users and some Internet Appliances like webtv , AOLTV etc had no way of storing them to a disc .	St
1.29.3	The Company went Bankrupt and all the Photos were lost .	St
1.29.4	They gave very little warning and to get your Photos saved to a disc Cost $ 50.00 .	St
1.29.5	Other examples , Yahoo Photo , Epson Photo and a dozen others also decided to eliminate Photo Storage .	St
1.29.6	Transfering Hundreds of Photos before the alloted time was a nightmare .	St
1.29.7	as each Photo had to be downloaded or emailed to another site , some of those sites then also closed with no warning .	St
1.29.8	The best Backup is to add an extra Hard Drive either internal or external , you can then move all the files to other Computers .	St
1.29.9	I use another inexpensive method by Backing Up all the Files etc to R/W CD or DVD 's .	St
1.29.10	Virtually all the last 3 Windows OS , XP , Vista and W7 have ways to automatically Back Up your Files .	St
1.29.11	The first time may take several hours , but you can still use the Computer while it is copying files .	St
1.29.12	W7 absolutely great at this .	St
1.29.13	When I add a new computer I simply copy all the programs , links and Favorites including Music , Photos and Games from the Back Up external HD or CD/DVD 's I want .	St
1.30.1	Sony ImageStation went away a couple of years ago..	St
1.30.2	I was using a VERY expesnive Mavica at the time , ( saves to floppy discs ) .. and had uploaded MANY photo albums to Sony ImageStation , which was free..	St
1.30.3	I copied the floppies to a hard drive , or at least I thought I did , and then re-used the floppies.. Then Sony decided to pull the plug on ImageStation.. it was similar to Shutterfly , Kodak Gallery , and lots of similar , current photo sharing / storing / printing sites.. Sony DID give a few weeks ' warning that & quot ; we 're shutting down Sony PhotoStation , so if you want to save your albums , log-in and download them & quot ; .. Well , as John Lennon said , just when you 're making other plans , life gets in the way..	St
1.30.4	I put it off and put it off and forgot about it , and then , by the time I remembered their cut-off date , I logged in and poof , everything was gone.. Sony ImageStation had erased everything.. nothing was transferred to some other outfit.. it was just wiped clean..	St
1.30.5	I lost all those photos , since I had re-used the floppy discs , and could n't find them.. they might still be on one of my old old computers , maybe , possibly , perhaps.. but if a company the size of Sony can just pull the plug and wipe out everything.. Sure , I 'm partially to blame for procrastinating and not downloading my photo albums before they took PhotoStation out behind the barn and put a bullet through its head.. modern life is complicated enough what with everything one has to remember.. Why did they shut it down ? ..	Ques
1.30.6	Why did n't they hand off the photos to another , similar online service ? ..	Ques
1.30.7	They never explained , and I could never find out whom to contact at Sony to find out..	St
1.30.8	I thought ahha !	St
1.30.9	Maybe archive.org 's wayback machine has a copy of ImageStation.. well , it does and it doesn't.. it has archives of the site , but not user-uploaded photos or albums..	St
1.31.1	I do n't see the benefit of using an online backup service .	St
1.31.2	Backing up data onto hardware -- such as external hard drives , USB flash drives , or DVD/CD disks -- is cheaper and better than anything an online service can offer .	St
1.31.3	Quality backup hardware , and media will provide a reliable and secure means of storing important data , and without ongoing monthly membership costs .	St
1.31.4	I back up my most important data onto archival quality gold CD-R disks , which are designed to reliably hold data for more than 100 years .	St
1.31.5	I also use an external hard drive for backup purposes , and USB flash drives for transferring data between computers .	St
1.31.6	I do n't have anything that 's & quot ; confidential & quot ; so I 'm not terribly worried about the risk of having my data & quot ; stolen & quot ; by some third party , but if I did have sensitive information , I 'd definitely worry about entrusting it to some online storage company .	St
1.32.1	I agree with Steven also !	St
1.32.2	Companies come and go and my biggest reason was that I had carbonite pre-loaded onto my system when I purchased my laptop and everything was fine til my trial ran out !	St
1.32.3	all of a sudden I got pop-up after pop-up reminding me to pay for this service or my data would be deleted !	St
1.32.4	I bet the pop-up came up every 5 minutes and I thought god if I 'm being aggravated by this service already what 's going to happen if I purchase it !	St
1.32.5	eeeeeeeeeks so I decided backing up with cd 's was my best bet !	St
1.32.6	I really felt uncomfortable even thinking someone else could view my personal information !	St
1.33.1	I tried it once before only to find out the storage website was totally corrupt at stealing customers original works by 1 ) Making sure the upload process and access to the uploads would continuously work faulty with numerous glitches from the get-go in order to frustrate paying customers into going away and never coming back , 2 ) Blocking access to any and all uploaded important files they possessed that could seemed of monetary value such as an unfinished draft of a book , 3 ) Hidden web bugs on every webpage of their website , 4 ) They also hacked into my computer and within two minutes of my starting a private email to an acquaintance the storage website emailed me to ask if I wanted to upload the email onto the their website , I ignored their email but wondered how in the heck could they know I had just started an email and they named the email by its subject title , then a few minutes later they emailed another request asking me again to upload that specific unfinished email to their storage website , 5 ) They refused to respond to over a dozen polite online website messages and emails asking for assistance to fix the problems particularly with the most important files I had uploaded onto their website , that is , until I finally tested them by sending them a short but extremely angry message and within two minutes they responded by saying theyre closing my account because of my use of profanity and then they blocked my access altogether while keeping the draft of my book which I had uploaded onto their website .	St
1.33.2	Beware of ProtectMyWork , com for they are as corrupt as they come .	St
1.33.3	In summary , unimportant files is okay but otherwise anything of importance is NOT SAFE when placed into the possessions of strangers online whom one does not know personally .	St
1.33.4	Tsark out .	St
1.34.1	I might use an online-service as a secondary backup , though not my main one .	St
1.35.1	Well you are correct , that is a lot of data and if the data is always changing that to is difficult .	St
1.35.2	You have to pick your method of madness if you have things important enough for storage .	St
1.35.3	I use a tape drive on my own server at home that backs up my data on a daily basis ( as it changes ) , however if my house burns down or gets flooded I 'm lost again , but then again all my paper records are lost too if my fireproof safe does n't work .	St
1.35.4	If you have enough data that needs backup then MORE than one plan is a Necessity .	St
1.35.5	I do n't trust on line backups period .	St
1.35.6	The only solution for me therefore is to take my data to a safe deposit box once a month or week.. Yea right .	St
1.35.7	But anybody that needs it should really consider more than one method of storage .	St
1.36.1	No , Simply because their systems are outside my control .	St
1.36.2	Mike .	St
1.37.1	As I mentioned above , why would anyone trust critical , sensitive or personal information to something like this .	St
1.37.2	If someone wants to pay money for on line storage , it better be for stuff that 's expendable and not something they might really need back if their other backup methods fail .	St
1.37.3	Worst case scenario would be one 's house destroyed or vandalized causing all local copies of data to be gone except that which was off site .	St
1.37.4	I 'd opt for some other off site backup method then some service I did n't know enough about to trust my life with them .	St
1.37.5	Who knows where the servers and mirrors are ... if they even exist .	St
1.37.6	Could be in some country with a corrupt government that seizes the place and all the hardware in it .	St
1.37.7	If it 's that important , I 'd buy space in a local bank vault .	St
1.37.8	If it costs more , so what ?	Ques
1.38.1	To be accurate , I just remembered I had actually tried two different storage websites a few years ago , one was a free service and the other was purchased .	St
1.38.2	It was the free service which I had uploaded original draft songs to Supload , com but failed to get access to my uploads from the get-go and for several days I failed to get any response to help fix the glitches so then I tracked down the owner who at first ignored my email but days later after I sent it again I finally got an email response from his partner-in-crime who tried to twist everything around by changing the subject in typical criminal mentality fashion so then I accused them outright of stealing peoples works and within a couple of hours I was hit with a very significant increase in spam .	St
1.38.3	Ive accused at least several different other criminal websites of various natures and nearly all of them ended up retaliating by significantly increasing my spam within hours as if right on cue .	St
1.38.4	After Supload , com is when I decided to try a paying service only to discover ProtectMyWork , com was also corrupt at ignoring any requests to close the account and I had to file a formal complaint with numerous authoritative agencies before eventually getting a full refund .	St
1.38.5	One of my last resort remedies is to file an Internet Fraudulent Transaction with my bank which has never failed in getting back my full refunds pronto because criminals want to avoid a criminal investigation by state and federal authoritative agencies who are connected with the bank .	St
1.38.6	Unfortunately the Internet is a bottomless gold mine for stupid criminal enterprise .	St
1.38.7	By stupid I mean in the sense we all have only one chance at life to live and its rather stupid to go through life trying to make this world a worse place to live in and although there are experienced criminals I conclude there are no such things as intelligent criminals .	St
1.38.8	I tested two online storage websites and learned to NEVER bother wasting anymore of my valuable time as I dont believe any of them can be trusted because theres simply way too much money to be made in criminal enterprise .	St
1.38.9	After ten years of computer experience Ive learned the hard way our Internet is infested with criminals much more than people normally suspect .	St
1.38.10	When you said the list is too many to count I knew exactly what you mean because it really is .	St
1.38.11	Troubleshooting suspected criminal activity is sometimes like a part-time hobby for me and I concur no storage website can be trusted and my common sanity tells me they all give in to the enormous profit gained through criminal intent compared to legitimate means especially when it comes to selling private information , that is , why settle for hundreds honestly when thousands or more can be made criminally while the risk of getting caught is practically nil ?	Ques
1.38.12	If all followed your lead in this and NEVER trusted a storage website then the crime rate would surely drop to some degree .	St
1.38.13	Tsark out .	St
1.39.1	I guess I 've been on this planet too long and been let down too many times to trust any & quot ; company & quot ; to hold my interests as a priority , even if I 'm paying them to do so .	St
1.39.2	Heck , I can even remember when this internet was relatively free from sharks lurking behind every keystroke and piranhas behind each mouse click .	St
1.39.3	But I digress .	St
1.39.4	I believe these companies are able to access my data .	St
1.39.5	I 'm not saying that do or that they will - just that they are able to and they might .	St
1.39.6	( Of course the joke will be on them because I have nothing of value on my system , including my bank balance ! ) .	St
1.39.7	If some opportunity presents itself for them to profit from learning something from my uploaded backup I firmly believe they will do it - and lie through their teeth about it .	St
1.39.8	Now why do you suppose I 've become so cynical and jaded about the world we live in today ?	Ques
1.39.9	Would n't have anything to do with being lied to by almost everyone , online and offline , from store clerks to teachers to politicians to preachers , would it ?	Ques
1.40.1	If I had absolutely no other options then & quot ; yes & quot ; I would use an online backup service .	St
1.40.2	But since I have many other options available to me , no way will I use the online services .	St
1.40.3	My reasons ?	Ques
1.40.4	Here 's a few : 1 .	St
1.40.5	There are uncountable examples of companies losing customers data 2 .	St
1.40.6	There are uncountable examples of companies security being breached .	St
1.40.7	3 .	St
1.40.8	IT companies come & go like the wind anymore .	St
1.40.9	Where 's my data going when they go out of business or are acquired by another company that has a different idea about the business ?	Ques
1.40.10	4 .	St
1.40.11	I can backup my data myself and have that backup available to me regardless of whether my internet connection is working or not .	St
1.40.12	5 .	St
1.40.13	By keeping my data at home I 'm not dependent on internet connection bandwidth .	St
1.40.14	Ever try downloading 3GB of data at 6MB/sec ?	Ques
1.40.15	6 .	St
1.40.16	My suspicious mind tells me that all the companies that offer & quot ; free online backup & quot ; are hiding something .	St
1.40.17	Eventually they 'll cost you something .	St
1.41.1	Personally I do n't trust these services for two reasons .	St
1.41.2	1 ) Servers can be hacked & infected 2 ) In the long run it would be more economical & safer to purchase an external HDD with a fair amount of space ( 1.5 TBS ) to back up your data yourself .	St
1.41.3	It 's my opinion that these services are setup for the convenience factor that anything else	St
1.42.1	As stated above .	St
1.42.2	I just do n't want people looking at my stuff , no matter what it is .	St
1.42.3	Being birthday dates , photos , documents , or anything else that is mine .	St
1.42.4	I f I want people that I do n't know looking at my stuff I might as well just post it all to a web page or something .	St
1.43.1	i will never use online backup service with my very important and personal data as it is never 100 % secure and any one can interfere with my personal and all important data .	St
1.44.1	I would NEVER trust any on-line service with any confidential data , particularly financial data .	St
1.44.2	Why should I ?	Ques
1.44.3	Would you trust someone you had never met to look after your sensitive personal information - such as bank account details , credit card numbers , etc ?	Ques
1.44.4	Apart from that , as a form of backup storage of ( non-sensitive ) data , the idea has some attractions .	St
1.44.5	No one is going to do me any harm by wrongfully gaining access to my mp3 collection , so why not store a backup of it on-line .	Ques
1.44.6	I would NEVER store my *only* copy of a file on-line .	St
1.44.7	Accidents happen , and a storage accident could as easily wipe out an on-line backup , just as an accident could on my home computer .	St
1.44.8	But keeping a backup ( i.e .	St
1.44.9	a second ) copy on-line would be an acceptable risk .	St
1.44.10	If the on-line backup was lost , I would still have my original files .	St
1.44.11	And having the on-line backup might save my ass some day .	St
1.44.12	Certainly , having an on-line backup is better than having no backup copy at all - a situation so many computer users sadly allow themselves to get into .	St
1.44.13	Even with broadband - *IF* you 've got it !	St
1.44.14	- the access speed to an on-line file is desperately slow .	St
1.44.15	I could access a 30MB mp3 file on my computer in a couple of seconds ; but I might have to wait 5 minutes or more to download it from the net .	St
1.44.16	So on-line storage is only ever going to be a back-up solution .	St
1.44.17	And you will find that copying 100 MB of files to an on-line server will take ten times the time that copying it to a second hard disk in your home computer would take .	St
1.44.18	Most home users have no backup at all .	St
1.44.19	Because most are not capable of even the simple task of installing a second IDE hard disk in their own PC .	St
1.44.20	If you 're one of those , then an on-line backup is worth while for you .	St
1.44.21	But bear in mind that you can now buy an external SATA ( e-SATA ) hard disk , or an external USB 2.0 disk , as a second local disk to use as backup storage .	St
1.44.22	That will do a much better job than on-line storage will .	St
1.44.23	And it normally does n't require opening the computer 's case , so it 's easy to install ( it just plugs into an external port ) .	St
1.45.1	I 've found that in practice e-SATA operates at twice the speed of USB 2.0 , if you have an external SATA-II hard drive and your motherboard ( or add-in card ) also supports SATA-II .	St
1.45.2	USB 2.0 runs at approximately the same speed as the original SATA-I disks , whereas SATA-II runs at approximately twice the speed of SATA-I ( always provided your computer does n't have a & quot ; bottleneck & quot ; elsewhere that slows down data throughput - as , regretably , many still do ! )	St
1.46.1	A BIG NO !	St
1.47.1	I am not a fan of backup services because they our not immune to hack /virus or loss of power and it lose some it i have fault lock it plugs in front and copys back up and i also have disk backup cant not depend on out side services and you might want to remmeber that info is like a bank it holds all the information on your computer and there alot of illegal hackers that breaking into there main computer and steal the info and they have enough info to hack your computer for your identity and will use it to steal your identity i would also recommend zone alarm security suite and when your online you can see them and talk to them but they dont see you i was on blog or somthing and they said we cant see you shut down defense so we can identfy you .	St
1.47.2	it works great and i also have identity guard alerts me the second theres activity and the zone alarm security suite comes with it and one millon dollars if your identity is stolen hope and one more thing i have system care pro when you delete any kind of software i use my system care un installer it removes program and the it removes any trace and after the normal unistalled and then thje force unistalled finds 5 to 6 things they left behind and remove them from your computer and after that you must search for downloads and remove that install too , hope that help rockbo	St
1.48.1	Firstly I am a trusting person so my answer is yes .	St
1.48.2	I think in the future millions of home users and businesses will save their data online .	St
1.48.3	I have been looking at the subject for a few months now .	St
1.48.4	see my website : http : //www.online-data-backup-info.com/	St
1.49.1	I think its not a problem as long as you encrypt your files before transfering them to an online backup site .	St
1.49.2	Just about all archiving software these days offers AES-256 encryption so you can both compress and encrypt your data before transferring it .	St
1.49.3	Provided you use a strong password , AES-256 encryption has yet to be cracked .	St
1.49.4	Theres a video tutorial at http : //www.techresit.com/20100211-how-to-create-encrypted-backup.shtm which shows you how to create an encrypted archive	St
