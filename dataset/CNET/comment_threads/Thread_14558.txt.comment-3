47c and 52c are pretty hot.
Best to check the mfgs site for thermal limits.
I have two internal HDDs and HDTune reports their temps at 24c (120GB) and 25c (200GB).
They're installed in a full tower ANTEC SX1200 case in a removable drive bay that can hold up to 3 drives.
The removable drive bay has a fan in the front that pulls air in and pushes over the HDDs and toward the back of the PC.
Bottomline if your HDDs are mounted so as to be right on top of each other...it would help to separate them to the maximum practical extent possible.
You could consider mounting one or both into a 5.25&quot; mounting kits and moving them into 5.25&quot; drive bays ...thats a real benefit of having extra 5.25 drive bays.
There are lots of options ...it would help to see a PIC if possible to see how your drives are mounted.
