you asked for the maker and that's what's on one here.
the keyboard has english key tops.
the unit may have been boxed as a ps2 usb keyboard which had some other name such as kingmax on it.
all this confuses the issues here since it's a generic product with many suppliers and in many packages.
let me ask if the maker is a needed piece of information to purchase such a keyboard?
i picked these up at ebgames, best buy but don't venture to circuit city so i can't answer that.
