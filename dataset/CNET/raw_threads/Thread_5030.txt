Please help me on choosing the best possible one. Here's the link of all 3. Cisco Linksys E900 Wireless-N300 Router Belkin Basic Surf (N300) Router Netgear JNR3000 N300 Gigabit Router And here is the URL in which i've compared all 3 of them. Comparison

I see new firmware but why did it take them months? Sorry, I'd remove netgear. My neighbor had too many problems with the Cisco models so by removing those names we are left with the Belkin. Even Belkin has had issues in the past such as http://www.michaelhanscbsi.com/eclecticism/2003/11/07/belkin-routers-hijacking-websurfing/ but that's a decade ago and they corrected this and learned their lesson from what I can tell.

And Netgear had that issue for months about connections with Apple products. My advice is to return defects rather than try to work with the makers. Bob
