<s> I'm interested in purchasing a netbook for school some light school use, basically for documents, web-browsing, and email. </s>
<s> I would like it to have the following: approximately 10&quot; display solid state harddrive Wireless G at least 1 GB of memory, maybe 2 depending on price metal chassis Distro of linux installed so I don't have to pay for Windows/office (I already have some experience with Ubuntu and Suse...&quot; Also, the larger the keyboard the better... Any suggestions would be appreciated. </s>
<s> I've tried looking for several hours and haven't found anything that appeals to me. </s>
<s> Also, I'm not in a terrible rush so if there's something that may be coming out in the near future I can wait. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> The Acer Aspire One with XP, 1GB RAM, 160GB hard disk. </s>
<s> Acer will roll out the 10.1 inch any day now and it's all of 350 on Amazon.com You can install Open Office and you're done. </s>
<s> My Acer netbook is very nice and I'd buy that again. </s>
<s> Who has a metal chassis? </s>

<s> along with Linux. </s>
<s> There is enough cheap or free software out there for each platform. </s>
<s> Do you need an SSD drive? </s>
<s> I would prefer one because it won't need to be larger than 16 or 20 GB and I'm more concerned about speed and battery life. </s>
<s> Also, this netbook will be in my bookbag, so it may get jarred a bit. </s>
<s> If I have a standard HD I won't have to worry so much about scrambled data. </s>
<s> I do know that the HP mininote, I think the 2100 version (whichever one is for business) has a metal chassis. </s>
<s> The benchmarks I used found them to be much like your common horse race. </s>
<s> Depends on what you are doing. </s>
<s> I went with the 160GB hard disk. </s>
<s> It's super. </s>

<s> So far there are no netbooks that will survive abuse or riding in a backpack with 50 pounds of books crushing the laptop. </s>
<s> In your case, do not buy anything without insurance for even &quot;abuse.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> Well I'll be more careful with the netbook in my bag. </s>
<s> I just want something a tad more rugged. </s>
<s> That little Asus Eee seems to be pretty tough, here's a torture test. </s>
<s> http://asuseeehacks.blogspot.com/2008/02/asus-eee-pc-torture-test-french-video.html How is the keyboard on your Acer and how long do you typically use it in a session? </s>
<s> What about compared to a full sized keyboard? </s>
<s> No complaints here. </s>
<s> However I do use the Logitech V450 Nano mouse so I can't tell you if the mouse pad is any good. </s>
