http://www.apple.com/macmini/specs.html Just because it isn't a card in a PCI slot that is removable or replaceable does not make it anything less...
Extending your comment further, the Mac mini does not have a network card or an audio card either - yet it provides full support for networking (wired and wireless) and audio (including optical)... and USB and FireWire for peripheral (and additional network) connectivity.
Now, the video support may not be what you need to support the complex graphics of high-end games... but it certainly does support video... quite nicely.
As for the CPU clockspeed - call it what ever you want - but it is still a CPU cycle on an Intel CoreDuo CPU...
The same chip in another machine is still the same chip running at the same clockspeed.
Comparing different chips (CoreDuo vs single core) is not comparing the same chip.
You *could* just not worry about it and get a MacPro tower...
