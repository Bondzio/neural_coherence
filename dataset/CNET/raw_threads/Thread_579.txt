The slot is badly designed and does not allow the key to go all the way through. The user mistakenly believes that the computer does not recognize the key and turns off the computer, the key still half plugged-in. The computer never turns on again and the hard disk's memory is gone. Can it be that this is due to the USB key?

However there are always exceptions such as a board that ignored the USB design guide or those USB memory keys that contained a virus/trojan. For some owners that USB virus/trojan does destroy the computer since the costs of reloading the OS exceed the price of a new PC (for some out there.) Bob

One thing can lead to another and if all the ducks line-up the USB port could cause the PSU to lose that power leg and thus bring the system down, however that suggests the true use of the port wasn't proper or manufacturing boo-boo was done. The USB port is the low-voltage and ampage variety. If the system as you reported it has happened, then only physical exam and testing must be done to find the true cause. Maybe a faulty USB was the tipping point and it went downhill from there, IMHO. tada -----Willy
