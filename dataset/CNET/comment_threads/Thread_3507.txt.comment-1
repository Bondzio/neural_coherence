I'm building a PC at the moment, and theres just a few things I need to be schooled on before i turn on that bad boy.
Is it possible to run a HDD and a DVD/CD-ROM drive configuration through the same EIDE port given a correct master/slave configuration?
The reason I ask, is because i only have one EIDE port on my board (EVGA 680i SE).
If you have any additional info, please let me know, cause i would much appreciate it.
