<s> I am considering buying a refurbished video card from newegg. </s>
<s> I buy their new stuff all the time with great results. </s>
<s> Does anybody have any good or bad experiences with their refurbished products? </s>
<s> I never buy refurbished. </s>
<s> Though, if it doesn't work, newegg will send another one, so if you're using newegg and you're buying say a very expensive part, and you can get a refurbished for a huge difference, go for it. </s>

<s> sometimes newegg has video cards for sale, especially Radeon 9500, 9700 and 9800 series, that have been returned since they didn't overclock high enough and the owner wanted a newer or different card... but what is the card your considering? </s>
<s> In either a 128 or 256 MB. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Good To know I still know whats what. </s>
<s> the 9800Pro won't do certain games, such as HL2 or FarCry due to it's limited SM abilities http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814145107 ^ that will beat the 9800 AND will run any game you want </s>
<s> The age old question. </s>
<s> 9800PRO(New or Refurb) or X800 (if i can find one in AGP, and refurb), or the 6600GT(New or Refurb)? </s>
<s> the 9800 pro is knocked out by both, the x800 will out perform the 6600gt, in most/all games except doom 3. check out tomshardware, they have a lot of gpu comparisons, or google it. </s>
<s> but both the 6600gt and the x800 will do fine for bf2. </s>
<s> i have heard about low fps for the 6600gt, but it is a demanding game. </s>
