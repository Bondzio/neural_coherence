you'd have to know their specs and test them.
what you'd be looking for is how much current they offer versus a standard charger.
as well, a good charger will sense the amount of current being drawn and adjust itself accordingly.
usb attachment to a pc or non-dedicated charging device may work...or work somewhat...but this isn't a substitute for a proper charger.
