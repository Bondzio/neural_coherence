<s> I have an HP deskjet 5550 that prints acceptable photos with its regular color/bw ink. </s>
<s> When I put in the special photo ink cartidges, the print quality takes a nosedive. </s>
<s> Suggestions? </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> Use the photo paper plus tell the printer driver about the change to cartidge and paper. </s>

<s> this all along, and it has made no difference. </s>
<s> Is this something I should ask HP about since the printer and scanner are theirs? </s>
<s> Sorry, but the printers here seem just fine. </s>
<s> But then again, I'm pretty stock, latest drivers for printer, video, etc. </s>

<s> Went to their online chat and found what the problem was. </s>
<s> What solved the problem? </s>

<s> the technician and I finally figured it out. </s>
<s> Since I hadn't been getting good printing copies using the photo ink, I thought the cradle that came in the box might be something I was supposed to be using. </s>
<s> That turned out to be a &quot;holder&quot; for the cartridge when it is not being used. </s>
<s> Eventually, I was steered to a page which explained the correct combination of cartridges to use. </s>
<s> 57 is the color cartridge, whether it be regular or photo. </s>
<s> The other cartridge uses a 56 or 58. </s>
<s> I had to make sure that I was using the 57 PHOTO and the 58 PHOTO GREY rather than just the black and white cartridge or the photo grey with just the color cartridge. </s>
<s> Still, I don't see that using the photo ink makes a much better photo print than using regular ink. </s>
<s> Still, perhaps the photo inks last longer. </s>
<s> earmonivergh; Hi Thank you for the reply. </s>
<s> I think that you may at some point in time want to try a better printer. </s>
<s> I have had two Epson printers Epson Stylus C42 and now Epson Stylus C65. </s>
<s> The life of the C42 expired and the C65 although I got some problems installing the same, it works really good. </s>
<s> the reproduction is fantastic. </s>
<s> I am happy with it, although I need to have a printer that would give me 18 b/w's per minute and 15 colour per minute. </s>
<s> Having said this, you will not doubt understand that I will be going for an Epson. </s>
<s> You will get quality for your money. </s>
<s> I have tried HP and Canon. </s>
<s> None compares. </s>
<s> Visit Epson Website. </s>
<s> Standeb. </s>
