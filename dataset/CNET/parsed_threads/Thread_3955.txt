<s> Yesterday, my little daughter dropped my memory stick and it probably didn't work any longer. </s>
<s> It was recognized on my computer. </s>
<s> But, every time I tried to open it, it could give me a message and asked me to format it at first. </s>
<s> But, when I attempted to format it, the computer would tell me the formatting process could not be finished. </s>
<s> Is there any way to retrieve all my files on this memory stick? </s>
<s> I still have something important on it. </s>
<s> Any idea could be appreciated. </s>
<s> Do one thing connect the memory stick to other system , if it is visible there then recover your videos from there to some other storage media. </s>
<s> If its not visible then you can try a data recovery software to recover your videos. </s>
<s> You should never put your memory stick on a place where the little child would access. </s>
<s> Right now, in order to get back your data, just disconnect it to your computer. </s>
<s> Since it still could be recognized, it may be fixed somehow. </s>
<s> Do not save new thing on this drive from now on and try to download drive data recovery freeware to get back your videos, such as TestDisk, EaseUs Data Recovery and iCare Data Recovery Free, etc. </s>
<s> After the data recovery process, you would try to format this drive and see whether it could be fixed. </s>
<s> Remember: Never try to save everything important on only one drive in the future. </s>
<s> OK! </s>
<s> Thank you very much! </s>
<s> You help me a lot! </s>
<s> I have followed your step and tried your recommended data recovery freeware. </s>
<s> They all work perfectly on my drive. </s>
<s> Now, they have retrieved all my needed videos back. </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> And I also remember your words to back up everything important on several places. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot!!! </s>
