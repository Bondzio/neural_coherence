<s> Hello, I own a samsung galaxy tab 7.0 plus and everything was great till it went dead one day and didnt start again. </s>
<s> the reason it didn't turn on again was that i lost my charger and the laptop charger couldn't help the battery to start. </s>
<s> So i had to take it to a Samsung maitenance point where they did a system upgrade. </s>
<s> Then my problem with the wi-fi connection started. </s>
<s> My problem now is that i cannot connect to my home wi-fi but i can connect to my office wi-fi. </s>
<s> Mind you that i connect many devices at my houses's wi-fi connection: laptops, other mobile phones.... and they all work perfectly, except my Galaxy tab. </s>
<s> can anyone help me connect back to my house wi-fi connection please? </s>
<s> Thank you so much in advance. </s>
<s> I don't have any detail to work with here. </s>
<s> We do know that hiding the SSID and more can break WiFi on some devices. </s>
<s> Your post has so little detail that I can't tell if it's something we know about. </s>
<s> To help others we have the top posts over in the CNET Networking Forum and a post specific to Samsung devices. </s>
<s> Tell more and if you can't change the router settings, I need to know that so we can stop before we start. </s>

<s> Dear Bob, Thank you for your reply. </s>
<s> I would like to inform you that i don't know how to change my router settings. </s>
<s> Can you help me out with this? </s>
<s> besides, what kind of information you require to tell you? </s>
<s> Thank you so much for your help </s>
<s> That's done from the router management page that you reach by typing it's url in your browsers address bar. </s>
<s> It should be documented in the manual. </s>
<s> In fact, it's the same as you did when you told it the WiFi password you chose. </s>
<s> Some modem/router-combo's are supplied by the ISP. </s>
<s> Mine didn't tell about how to do it, but it was easy to find out. </s>
<s> How's that with you? </s>
