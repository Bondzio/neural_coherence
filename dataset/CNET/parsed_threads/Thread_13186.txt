<s> Hi, I just finished my very first build and have run into an issue. </s>
<s> When I try and boot, nothing shows up on the monitor. </s>
<s> I have tried the monitor on different computers and all the parts are new. </s>
<s> When I turn on the computer, the fans start (case and CPU), the led on the MB lights up and it makes regular booting up noises. </s>
<s> I have tried booting up without the RAM and/or the video card and here NO beeping (I even tried with speakers plugged in) I have also tried booting with nothing but the MB, CPU and PSU Like I said, all the components are brand new. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I have heard of a lot of people having problems getting this particular MB to POST (?) </s>
<s> See this -&gt; http://www.newegg.ca/Product/ProductReview.aspx?Item=N82E16813121348CVF Thanks again for your help </s>
