1.1.2	Recently when I plug the external drive , after being recognized by the windows , as soon as i go into the directories after a couple of minutes i can not access to the data .	St
1.1.3	It will come up with the message : it is not accessible and the the external drive would not respond anymore and I would get a message with exclamation mark near the time and date corner of the desktop indicating the same message .	St
1.1.4	The time for this to happen varries between 15 seconds after connection to maximum 5 minutes .	St
1.1.5	I am desperately asking for HELP ! !	St
1.1.6	Thanks to all of you guys .	St
1.2.1	This is a common early warning that the drive has issues .	St
1.2.2	Hopefully there are no files you have not backed up .	St
