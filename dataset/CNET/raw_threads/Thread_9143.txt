Obviously they are not making a lot of noise over this but does anyone know or have contact with Dell? On the news they said over 4 million laptops have had to be recalled because their batteries which were made by Sony might explode? Has anyone had contact with Dell about this?

On the news an hour or two ago here they showed some footage of a laptop exploding at some Japanese conference and I am wondering if that was the one that started the whole recall thing off.
