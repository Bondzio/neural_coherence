<s> Whats the difference between USB and Wireless Card for laptop?? </s>
<s> Whats the advantage of these two? </s>
<s> Good strength? </s>
<s> Pick up more other routers? </s>
<s> Good speed? </s>
<s> We have D-Link Wireless USB Adapter, man its suck.... We want to buy a notebook wireless card, any suggestion? </s>
<s> If you mean an internal mini-PCI wireless network adapter that is found in many notebooks, go for it! </s>
<s> I like them better than external wireless network adapters (USB, PC-card/PCMCIA). </s>
<s> Range is good, no hardware to lose, keeps USB ports free. </s>
<s> Check with your notebook mfg to see what mini-PCI card they recommend. </s>
<s> NewEgg.com sells them, too. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Internal (usually PCI) 2. </s>
<s> External (usually USB and/or firewire) 3. </s>
<s> PCMCIA for a laptop, you certainly can not use PCI card. </s>
<s> The external USB adapter, mean one more thing to carry around. </s>
<s> So PCMCIA card have the advantage. </s>
<s> Now its up to you, which connection you want, and there are so many brand out there... D-link, Linksys, Netgear, Belkin, Motorola, 3com and many other. </s>
<s> Many newer notebooks have an interneal &quot;mini-PCI&quot; slot (not PCI, not pc-card/PCMCIA). </s>
<s> If the laptop in question has a mini-PCI slot, I'd check into it. </s>
<s> Here is an example: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16833106221 </s>
<s> With a card for your laptop, the antenna is confined to a very small space and thus will not get very good reception. </s>
<s> With a USB adapter, designers are free to add an external antenna and make it as effective as possible. </s>
<s> I have gone through both adapters and by far the usb adapter is the best. </s>
<s> I have much fewer dropped connections and it really makes my life easier. </s>
<s> Hope this helps </s>
<s> I have seen systems with the mini PCI slot that could accep an internal adapter but don't have an antenna built in to connect that card to. </s>
<s> I own a several year old HP like that. </s>
