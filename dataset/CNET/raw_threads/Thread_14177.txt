I have two issues: 1) Lately, I've been losing connection to the internet, but not to the network. The connection loss has reached a significant frequency, sometimes I lose it every minute. Makes online gaming near impossible. 2) Sometimes while I do have a stable connection, I'll have extremely slow speeds. My ping will break 1000ms when I try pinging www.google.com. So I'd like some suggestions as to how to fix these problems, and whether or not it's my ISP or router's fault. Thanks in advance.
