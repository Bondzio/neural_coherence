But let's cover a common no boot spins drives issue.
Many forget about that little battery on the motherboard.
Some motherboards will not boot when that the battery voltage is too low.
This is why details matter.
I can't tell if this machine is known to have that issue.
Make it easy on others with machine details otherwise you get guesses and maybe bad ones.
