1.1.1	Twice this week , my keyboard simply stopped inputting any characters -- either in a browser or MS Word document .	St
1.1.2	After the first time , I looked in the Device Manager and the keyboard was n't listed at all .	St
1.1.3	I rebooted and everything was back to normal again -- until just this evening .	St
1.1.4	Another reboot took care of this .	St
1.1.5	But I 'm wondering now why this is happening .	St
1.1.6	I am using a Dell Inspiron 1501 ( Vista ) and the drivers for this laptop on their support site do n't have one for the keyboard .	St
1.2.1	1st off , since this is a laptop , it maybe better to post in the laptop forum , as more laptop users can help .	St
1.2.2	A typical laptop is already provided its drivers for the system itself by the maker and/or the OS .	St
1.2.3	No separate driver should be required unless unique .	St
1.2.4	What you may need to do , is either try a & quot ; restore point & quot ; when the problem did n't exist or a OS repair .	St
1.2.5	An OS repair will make the required fixes by refreshing the OS .	St
1.2.6	This method should n't replace or delete your current pgms .	Sug
1.2.7	etc .	St
1.2.8	already loaded .	St
1.2.9	It will however require access to the Vista restore/recovery ( OEM ) discs or from the hidden partition for same purpose .	St
1.2.10	Vendors and makers provide OEM discs for some small cost or free ( maybe ? )	Ques
1.2.11	if not shipped with system , contact them or website to order , it always good to have these discs & quot ; in hand & quot ; .	St
1.2.12	Review your manual or visit the maker support website in order how to access this process .	St
1.2.13	As always , backup any critical data or use the maker 's process to create a system recovery/restore disc .	St
1.2.14	Again visit the makers ' support website for detailed info .	St
1.2.15	I exclude any possible real h/w fault and this maybe a cause of your problem .	St
1.2.16	Only a kybd .	St
1.2.17	replacement will fix it if nothing seems to work .	St
1.2.18	If you have any warranty , use it or call service support to attempt fix .	St
1.2.19	When asking for help provide all details of your system , etc .	St
1.2.20	in order to better respond to your query .	St
1.2.21	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	posted this in laptop forum .	St
1.3.2	I can always do a repair install for this if I have to , I do have the disks .	St
1.3.3	Thanks .	Polite
1.4.1	I cross posted in the laptop troubleshooting forum .	St
