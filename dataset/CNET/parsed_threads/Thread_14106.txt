<s> Hello, as in my title. </s>
<s> I've just built a new windows 7 64bit home prem. </s>
<s> machine for use as an HTPC, the problems I am having are as follow:- Firstly, I should mention that one of the sticks of RAM I put in the PC was corrupted which caused all sorts of issues but on removing that a lot cleared up but I am still left with the following issues. </s>
<s> (windows memory diagnostic also confirmed this stick has errors). </s>
<s> Also with the bad stick of RAM out I have run the Hload (Heavy Load) stress testing program for in excess of 4 hours with no problems. </s>
<s> Also when I first powered on the system I had an old copy of windows XP on the HDD which started to load up, could this have somehow corrupted the motherboard as it is specifically designed for Win7/Vista? </s>
<s> Problems remaining:- 1. </s>
<s> Powering on the system from a cold start results in a blank screen (No BIOS/POST Screen) then on powering down and trying again it works and proceeds to load windows. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> When returning from sleep I get similar issues as above, the system hangs before the post screen, but sometimes it works. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Using windows reset or the motherboard reset button also makes it hang before the POST screen 50% of the time. </s>
<s> The system specification is as follows:- CPU Intel E7500 Core2Duo 2.93 GHz Mobo ASUS P5G41T-M LX RAM OCZ Gold 4GB (2x2GB) DDR3 PC3-10666C9 1333MHz (of which I am only using one stick as one is faulty according to windows memory diagnostic) Graphics card EVGA GeForce GT 430 1024MB GDDR3 PCI-Express TV Card Hauppauge HVR1700 PCI-E HDD Western Digital 2500YS 250GB SATA PSU Antec 350Watt ATX DVD Drive Pioneer OEM Writer This looks to be a hardware fault, although I could be wrong. </s>
<s> My question is, which piece of hardware is it, could it be a bad motherboard or PSU, or would doing somthing like reflashing the BIOS work, or reformatting windows? </s>
<s> Thankyou for reading my post and any advice you can give! </s>
<s> Tom. </s>
<s> I'd start with the power supply but first I'd ask if it was new or old. </s>
<s> At 350 watts you do ok with P3 and some P4 systems that are minimally configured and the PS is in decent shape. </s>
<s> The PSU is indeed second hand, and from help from someone on another forum I have found that the Graphics card needs a 22A 12V Rail and this one only has around 17Amps. </s>
<s> So looks like its a mistake on my part. </s>
<s> Now I am thinking its the PSU it does seem like the symptoms I am describeing are to do with lack of power. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help Steven! </s>
<s> I'll keep this forum posted on my progress, I am looking at ordering a 22Amp 12Vrail 500Watt PSU now. </s>
<s> Tom. </s>
<s> The 550W PSU (link below) comes in at 41A http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139004 VAPCMD </s>
