i installed 512k ram yesterday and did not have the chip in totally.
long story short, when i turned it back on smoke started to come from the motherboard.
i unplugged it immediately and after a few more tries got it fully in and it turned on with no problem.
those few tries involved some beeping and a few odd sounds.
so it worked fine last night and this morning i was listening to internet radio and it just turned off.
i restarted and ten minutes later the screen turned multi-colored.
i started it again and backed up what i could and left it defragging this am.
am i totally screwed?
my comp is only 6 months old but i had no idea you could fry your mb by not putting the chip in fully.
i was fully grounded.
i thought that was the only concern.
am i out the money?
