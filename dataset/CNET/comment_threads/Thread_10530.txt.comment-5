I only have the cables that came with the mobo.
I bought a bare drive, so it didn't come with any cables.
When I was building the computer, I did think that the quality of the cable ends looked kinda &quot;chintzy&quot;.
So, you're probably right...the move just simply loosened the cable.
At least, I hope that's so.
Ha.
Thanks.
