Some specs: LiteOn's second generation of Blu-ray burners is the new DH-4B1S.
Its manufacturers call it &quot;Triple Writer&quot;, meaning that it can burn all types of optical storage media currently available (except for DVD-RAM).
BD-R burning speed is set at 4X which is a good speed - although not the best that you can find on the market.The drive can be connected to any PC using a Serial-ATA interface, ensuring that data transfer will never slow down the process of BD reading/playback.
The drive can burn BD-RE media at 2X, DVD+/-R media at 12X, DVD+/-R DL at 8X, DVD+RW at 8X, DVD-RW at 6X, CD-R at 40X and CD-RW at 24X.
Reading speeds are also set high, with the DH-4B1S being able to read BD-ROM media at 4X, DVD-ROM media at 12X and CD-R/RW media at 40X.
