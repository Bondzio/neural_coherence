<s> Hello everybody, How are you doing? </s>
<s> I'm looking for the best wireless router that has the fastest speed and the best range. </s>
<s> I got confused with &quot;Belkin N1 Vision, netgear wndr3700, and linksys WRT610N&quot; I don't know what the best one is and I don't know what the best modem (ADSL2+) to connect with any of them is. </s>
<s> May any one advise me or help with that, please? </s>
<s> I'm looking for the best speed range modem (ADSL2+) no detachable BTW: I don't care about electricity and I need something no more than $500 My net speed is 4MB. </s>
<s> Warm regards, </s>
<s> I have the D-link modem, DCM-202 and the router, DIR-655. </s>
<s> Top of the line all the way. </s>
<s> Speed is standardized. </s>
<s> And anyway much faster then your Internet connection. </s>
<s> For the range, specify your needs (10 feet, 100 feet, 1000 feet?) </s>
<s> in open air. </s>
<s> Then find a shop and buy one that conforms. </s>

<s> Coryphaeus, Thank you so much for your comment. </s>
<s> Does your modem work perfectly? </s>
<s> Thank you Kees Bakker for your comment Actually I'm using Thomson TG585 v7 and it's G not N so it is too slow and its range is too bad. </s>
<s> My house has built from concrete and bricks. </s>
<s> for the range, I need something more than 1000 ft In my country there are no Linksys WRT610N and Netgear WNDR3700, so I will order everything from amazon or any website. </s>
<s> regards, Khaled </s>
<s> Is this modem &quot;NETGEAR DM111P ADSL2+ Ethernet Modem - DSL modem&quot; good? </s>
<s> I'm planning to buy it and connect it with &quot;Cisco Small Business WAP4410N Wireless Access Point&quot; </s>
