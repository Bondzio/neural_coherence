try to use the f2 key or the del key on your keyboard when you see the lights on your keyboard lit up simultaneously.
(numlock, capslock and scroll lock) entering the bios varies on what key to press.
butu if you are comfortable in opening the tower, just check the documentation of your m/b and search for jumpers on how to clear cmos, reset nvram.
entering the bios usually comes up when you turn on your computer, and when you see the bios or pheonix screen, (usually after the computer finishes its post), try hitting on those keys and before you reset the bios, make sure that the drive configuration for the hdd's are properly selected.
another way of resetting the bios is when removing the cmos battery, (flat and silver round battery inside the motherboard) and putting it back after 2minutes.
but don't ever flash your bios.
