<s> Several weeks ago I had to take my desktop in to get rid of malware. </s>
<s> The desktop was the host for the router and the modem. </s>
<s> While in the shop we continued to use the laptop with an internal wireless card. </s>
<s> Now that the host is back, the laptop get knocked off the internet. </s>
<s> The only way to get back on is to unplug the modem for two minutes and hook it back up and then you can get on. </s>
<s> But if it goes inot sleep mode, you have to go through the process all over again. </s>
<s> Also, it won't let me print from the laptop to the host connected printer. </s>
<s> hi, i need some more information regarding the network: what is the model number of the modem: are u using any router : in the network: because only one computer can online with the modem at a time ; so we need to know modem is router come modem or normal modem: </s>
<s> I will get the information for you oce I get off work today. </s>
<s> I do know the modem came from windstream since they are our DSL provider. </s>
<s> The router is a Linksys which was installed last January. </s>
<s> I did get the laptop reconnected to the internet. </s>
<s> However, I took the old drivers for the printer off and reloaded them from the website. </s>
<s> I then restarted the computer. </s>
<s> The printer will not allow me to share even though everthing is checked to share. </s>
<s> I did not take the firewalls down when I did this. </s>
<s> i even tried to back door by searching for the host computer but it did not locate it. </s>
<s> That's very odd. </s>
<s> I wonder if something was lost in translation when you posted here. </s>
<s> If you have a router, it doesn't need a PC to host it. </s>
<s> Somethings wrong with this post and the network as described. </s>

<s> i can not get the computers to ping...either from desktop or laptop and subnets are the same. </s>
<s> I am not sure how I need to handle this issue. </s>
<s> That's something that's proper in many systems. </s>
<s> I can't count how many times I find a firewall set to &quot;Maximum Protection.&quot; The owners seem to not know what that means. </s>
<s> BACK TO MY OBSERVATION. </s>
<s> Can you write more about the router being hosted by that PC? </s>
<s> That's a very odd statement. </s>
