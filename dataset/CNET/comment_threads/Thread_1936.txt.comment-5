If you need it for home use buy a netgear router its about $50 just make sure it has SPI on the box some of the older netgear routers don't have them and it doesn't really cost that much more to have it.
The SPI and the Nat firewall features are on by default so you don't have to configure that part.
they also have a wireless version for $70 -$90 depending on whether you get the 11mbs 802.11b or 54 mbs 802.11g, don't pay any attention to claims of 108mbs super G claims, sometimes they work and sometimes they cause unwanted problems with cordless phones.
If it's for business use I would highly recommend you pay more and get a business class router with firewall.
Netgear's runs for about $180 - 200 with built in wireless router.
There is a difference between this one and a $50 router.
The home routers come with a stripped down version of the SPI firewall.
fine for home but business use should use a real firewall.
Hope this helps.
