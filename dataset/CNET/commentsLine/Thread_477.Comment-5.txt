i have the newest drivers for everything i dont have another computer to try my other gfx card on, the only other one in my house is my sisters laptop, and i just sold my parts box so i cant build a temp one either.
do you think it would work to get a new gfx card and psu?
i mean thats not too much, since i have to get agp, i can get a geforce 5500 from a friend, that he never used for about $50, and i can get a 500w psu for around $70, so i can get both of those right now, i just wanted to know if thats what i should do.
i wanna make sure its nothing else.
because one of the other things ive thought about, is that i used knoppix linux-on-a-cd on my comp.
to transfer files off my old hard drive, which the windows on it got fully corrupted.
after i finished moving most files, i went to move my fonts over, and i tried going into the windows folder, and it crashed linux.
ever since then, my computer has felt slower, like the load of knoppix felt slower.
i was thinking the crash might have done something to my ram, since knoppix loads completly in the ram, but i hace no idea, which is why i am asking here
