<s> hi every1 i had a computer i built but sold it and am looking for a new AGP video card to go with my Dell DImension 4500. </s>
<s> Right now i am looking at the HIS Radeon 2600 XT http://www.compusa.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3570059&CatId=2234 of the 7800 gs but i read somewhere that the nvidia is not recommended for Dells but oh well i took the advice of another person and bought a New PC Power and Cooling DEll 410-2 psu so im not worried but here is the 7800 http://www.compusa.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1786748&CatId=935 which do guys think i should buy </s>
<s> srry bout double post but i also wanted to say im buying 1 of these cards for gaming with games such as Crysis if possible, Carbon, MoH Airborn, and CoD 4 </s>
<s> Try AGP cards from this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/2008/02/04/best_cards_february_2008/ I like to see you in the 7950 GX2, 8800 GS, 9600 GT X1950 XTX or better cards. </s>

<s> Will the user's 4x slot be a limiter? </s>
<s> Will going too far up scale be a waste as the slot can not feed the card? </s>
<s> 8x cards run in 4x slots just fine. </s>
<s> If you feel this is a waste then its time to replace the machine? </s>
<s> ive decided on the 2600xt b/c it only needs 300 watt psu and the 7800 needs 400 so i think the 2600 is a better idea or way to go thx for the help guys ill be back soon with another question </s>
