perhaps it is possible to encode hd in such a way that it will not work on these players, however that comment would also seem to suggest that there are ways to encode where there are no problems too.
such may beyond the scope of this discussion, and i understand that.
i don't plan on getting that technical here.
as for a bd player, i am aware of those.
however to suggest one of those is to disregard the reason that was given for seeking an alternative in the first place, regardless of whether drm is present.
(obviously it wouldn't be if were to burn a copy of my sisters wedding to a bd-r.) as for the industry not offering what i want (a media player with better processing speeds) that would seem somewhat of an ambiguous comment.
if you mean the movie industry will not, i would agree.
it is not in their interests.
however, i do not think that necessarily means technology innovators who are not affiliated with the movie industry will in time if not already.if there is any reason why manufacturers of media player do not equip their products with better processors, i think it is to make more money over the long term.
it's not because the technology doesn't exist.
if someone buys a media player with slow processing speed and one later comes out with faster processing speed than the owner of one would feel compelled to buy another, which would mean twice the profits for such manufacturers, where this would not have been the case had they given the consumer every thing they wanted at once.
though i guess the only way i will be able to find out if all media players on the market still have slow processing times is to contact every major manufacturer of one and inquire about their latest product offerings...
