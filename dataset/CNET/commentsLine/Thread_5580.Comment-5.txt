thanks for the advice.
i'll check out netflow and see what that's all about.
i'll also check out a traffic shaper.
i haven't heard of those.
i've been kicking around the idea of replacing our router as well -- it's been probably 3-4 years.
maybe i can find one that has some extra management features on it.
(suggestions welcome!!)
i think i might rather do that then fiddle with tomato.
i've taken myself down those paths many a time, and though the issues always get resolved, there are a lot of curse words uttered between here and there... cheers.
