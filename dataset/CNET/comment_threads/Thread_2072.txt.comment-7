It took me more than a few times to grasp what was going on so keep at it.
In a nutshell your BIOS is faking 2 SATA drives to look like they are actually IDE drives.
This has made it easier for XP owners to get their OS installed without the mandatory F6 and a driver diskette during the install but now you have hit the next issue.
How will you get more than 2 SATA channels working.
I noted how but I see you are still digesting the changes in how things work.
My best advice is to keep reading and asking until someone finds the right words for you.
Vista is a fair solution since Microsoft finally added SATA support.
For XP we use the BIOS as a crutch if the owner/installer won't deal with the usual F6 and diskette install.
