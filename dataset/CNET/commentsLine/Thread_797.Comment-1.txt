i have a hardwired local area network.
it consest of modem to rounter to switch to another switch.
my wife got a new laptop with wireless card.
she wants a wireless conection.
how can i come off of my switch to turn one port into wireless?
i looked for a wireless switch can find nothing but commercial stuff.
i was under the impression that if you added a router it would confuse the other router up stream or vise versa.
any ideas would be great!!
thanks
