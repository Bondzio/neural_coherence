1.1.1	OK, I have decided to wait until the P38 motherboards come out before I customize a new computer.	St
1.1.2	Here is what I am thinking of getting for current use to be capable of upgrading.	St
1.1.3	quad 6600 p38 motherboard single 8800 gts 640 mb graphics card not sure what case to get I think a 650w powersupply would suffice no sound card I would like a media card reader and of course DVD-R/DVD most likely a 500 GB hard drive, I have read raptors are really only a few secs faster, so no need to spend extra for just a few secs If I am going to get only 1 graphics card, I see no reason to get a SLI or Crossfire mobo, correct?	St
1.1.4	With the above generic hardward, what specific brands would you recommend?	St
1.1.5	thanks	Polite
1.2.1	x38 based mobos should be out around Sept 23rd.	St
1.2.2	it brings pci-express 2.0 and some memory latency improvements.	St
1.2.3	initially most x38s will be ddr3 only but some manufacturers are planning ddr2 versions.	St
1.2.4	almost all will have at least 2 pci-e x16 slots.	St
1.2.5	performance-wise, the x38 should be a bit (3-5%) faster than a stock p35, but a well tuned p35 will close the gap.	St
1.2.6	since you're choosing mid-high range components a p35 mobo should be sufficient.	St
1.2.7	why spend $240 on a mobo and then put a $280 cpu in it?	Sug
1.2.8	the x38 is intended for ultra-high end performance and components.	St
1.2.9	http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=8467 http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=7543 http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=8506	St
1.3.1	I had thought of the P38 for sake of energy efficiency and power consumption from what I had heard about that mobo.	St
1.3.2	You are right, that I could go with the P35 as I am not intending to overclock at all.	St
1.3.3	From the components I am looking at, what kind of case would you recommend?	St
1.3.4	Would a Corsair 650w PSU be overkill or something I should consider?	St
1.4.1	since you've said you're not interesting in sli/crossfire, a 500w unit should suffice.	St
1.4.2	the corsair 620w is $170 while the 520w is $125 (from newegg).	St
1.4.3	either of these 500w power supplies are good alternatives also.	St
1.4.4	Antec neohe 500, $80: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=269998 COOLERMASTER Real Power Pro RS-550, $99: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=10006328 as for a case, that's mostly a matter of choice.	St
1.4.5	side window?	St
1.4.6	drive door?	St
1.4.7	flashy lights?	St
1.4.8	i'm a big fan of the coolermaster cavalier and mystique cases.	St
1.4.9	cavalier, $75 (also avail in silver): http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=141774 mystique, $75: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=10005468	St
