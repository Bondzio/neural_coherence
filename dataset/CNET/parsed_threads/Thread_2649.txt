<s> I currently have a raid 0 formation but because of a drive failure want to just install a single 1T HDD. </s>
<s> I've cloned all the data etc with Acronis to the new drive and hope to just swap out the old and install the new. </s>
<s> Will the PC recognise the single drive or will I have to go into the BIOS and disable the raid set-up? </s>
<s> Since its a clone you can plow ahead and try it. </s>
<s> However it is a data drive so I take it from your post that no OS is at issue here. </s>

<s> The OS was cloned as well.....It should just be like putting a complete disc in....I've done the same on laptops and other PC's but they didn't have a &quot;raid&quot; configuration. </s>
<s> If the common ones, research this on google about repair after the changes. </s>
<s> XP REPAIR INSTALL Vista REPAIR INSTALL Sadly with all the variations of raid chips and more the only answer is to try it and be ready to try the repair installs. </s>

<s> Thanks but with it cloned it should just boot up......Hopefully! </s>
