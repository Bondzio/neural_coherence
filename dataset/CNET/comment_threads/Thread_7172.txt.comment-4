Everything ran perfectly at the time, but like I said, now things are a little laggy.
------------- I look at this like a car that someone keeps adding more and more junk to the trunk.....more weight.
Soon the car does not perform very well.
Some folks will say &quot;put in a bigger engine&quot;.
Being a little frugal I say &quot;take the junk out of the trunk&quot;.
It's amazing how much junk can be put in the trunk in a two year period.
