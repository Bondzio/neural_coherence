currently, pcs put the monitor in power save mode, but the monitor is still consuming some power.
in an enterprise, a single building may have hundreds or thousands of pcs.
more money would be saved if the monitor is completely shut down.
the savings is beyond the power consumed by the monitor.
any electronic device creates heat.
this heat has to be pumped out later when the air conditioning is turned back on.
this also costs money, and is a comnplete waste.
a slow drip in a tub will fill the tub.
savings can be done by building the pc with a plug in the back to power the monitor.
if the pc is inactive for a configuarable time limit (different than the screen saver limit), then the pc will shut power off to the monitor.
this will all be moot when we all switch to laptops, but in the meantime...
