1.1.1	Gateway 510 S 512 MB RAM Pentium 4 Windows XP When I turn the comp on, it stops during the boot-up.	St
1.1.2	I have tried replacing the RAM sticks.	St
1.1.3	Tried disconnecting the CMOS battery, I was told by a Gateway Tech that the motherboard failed.	St
1.1.4	Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.	St
1.2.1	Maybe it's the failed hard disk or something else but details will matter.	St
1.3.1	When I ush the power button, the machine starts, about 5 secs later I hear 1 short beep and the boot-up sequence stops.	St
1.3.2	Do you need more details??	St
1.3.3	?	Ques
1.4.1	As you can imagine we have the start, the middle and the end.	St
1.4.2	The middle is a big place so there isn't much I can offer yet.	St
1.4.3	You could tell if the screen displays a bios page, settings in the bios work or it's dead to the point of no display, etc.	Sug
1.4.4	I will not be asking for details from this point on.	St
1.4.5	I hope you will apply yourself in helping to fix your machine.	St

1.5.1	just frustrated with the situation... After I attempt to turn on the computer, all peripherals sound like they are starting up...	St
1.5.2	When the beep happens, the monitor does not turn on, no bios screen, fan shuts down, there are still lights on inside the case, the entire boot-up process shuts itself off... Again, my apologees... Nighthamar	St
1.6.1	Test the monitor on another machine.	St
1.6.2	If it displays then back to the failed machine.	St
1.6.3	Try unplugging the IDE cables from the motherboard (remember where things go) and try again.	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	Monitor worked on a diff machine... Disconneced the wide beige cable bundles from the motherboard, (I hope those were the IDE cables).	St
1.7.2	Still same problem... Night	St
1.8.1	Try reseating the video card.	St
1.8.2	No go?	St
1.8.3	Try resetting the CMOS.	St
1.8.4	It varies with each machine so check the manual.	St
1.9.1	Yes, there is a added videocard, I do not know how to reset it... NVIDIA GeoForce4 4200 video card... And to reset the CMOS, just take the battery out again, right?	Ques
1.9.2	Night	St
1.10.1	That is the video card on my laptop... ROFL PC is GeoForce 6200 DDR2 256 MB &lt;=== NOOB Night	St
1.11.1	Small difference.	St
1.11.2	For the added video card you could unplug it and let the onboard video do the work for now.	St
1.12.1	Reseated the videocard and reset the CMOS...	St
1.12.2	When I pushed the power button, the first time I heard 2 beeps...	St
1.12.3	The second time, I only heard one... Is this making sense???	St
1.12.4	Night	St
1.13.1	Since that model had onboard video we try that.	St
1.13.2	We don't care at this point if the customer wants the video card or not, the machine needs to work first.	St
1.14.1	Took out the video card, tried to power it up, still stops and gives the single beep warning... Night	St
