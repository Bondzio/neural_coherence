I was wondering if its possible to be running two keyboards and two mice (one set on the ps/2 ports and the other on usb ports) to control each screen independately. I want to be able to be running two applications at the same time; one on each monitor. Will I need extra sofware/hardware?

Today it's ancient history since a PC is cheaper than what you are asking Windows to do. BUT if you want to try an old ASCII TERMINAL on some SERIAL PORT, just load Linux and attach TERMINALS on serial ports and log on. I will not respond to more pleas to get such working... because it's dead tech. Bob

Two monitors will give you the ability to have two applications visible but you can only work in one of the application at a time. (I run 3 monitors) Unless you pick up a Jetway http://www.jetwaycomputer.com/ Then you have to worry about cable length. Bill .
