1.1.1	After trouble free operation of my Belkin N Wireless Modem Router , it has suddenly started failing to connect with the internet ( the amber internet light is flashing ) .	St
1.1.2	I have disconnected it and re-connected my old Voyager 2091 router which is working perfectly .	St
1.1.3	Finding that this worked , I replaced the Voyager with the Belkin , but it still fails to connect the internet ( amber light flashing so I am back on the Voyager ! ) .	St
1.1.4	I would prefer to be using the Belkin - any suggestions to cure the modem ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	For example this can happen on cable modem setups but the details appear to be missing .	St
1.2.2	Maybe the Belkin is dead , maybe it 's the old cable modem issue that we cure a lot .	St
1.2.3	But the details elude me .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	not in the heart of rural England !	St
1.3.2	It is just called an & quot ; Belkin N wireless Modem Router & quot ; I think the internet supply is called ADSL .	St
1.3.3	I bought it just one year ago but it has not had a lot of use as I ran my Voyager for aprt of the time.. Is it possible that it could suddenly have died ?	Ques
1.4.1	Ok , with ADSL we have to set up the ISP details or the light will blink .	St
1.4.2	I ca n't guess those details and hopefully you have them .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	I have contacte the Belkin help desk , but , after three lengthy emails from them and having followed all their guidance , I still get no contact .	St
1.5.2	However , taking into account that the Belkin router will not work on either of my two computers ( one is a MAC and the others a Windows XP ) and also that my old router works perfectly on both , it seems likely too me that the router itself has a fault .	St
1.5.3	Rather than waste any more time on it , I have decided to cut my losses and dump the router !	St
1.5.4	Many thanks for you comments Gerald	Polite
