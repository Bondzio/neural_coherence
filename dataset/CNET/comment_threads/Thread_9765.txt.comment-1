Hello ,I have an &quot;Optiplex GX280 ,I have 4 slots for memory and &quot;Crucial says after a scan that I can max out at 4GB's.
I have purchased 4 1GB sticks of memory ,I've installed them and when the PC turns on it says it has 4 GB's of memory but when I click on &quot;system information ,it reads only 2.99 Gb's .
what's the deal ???
I appreciate any help ,thanks !
!
