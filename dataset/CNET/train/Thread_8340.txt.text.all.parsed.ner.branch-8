(only stuff i want to carry with me and can't lose.) 3. a set of dvdrw disks. on item 3 there are 3 sets i rotate around. this gives me at any one time 2 copies and lets me change out media should it fail. 4. another copy to an usb attached drive. if i lose it, it would take quite a disaster. 5. about yearly a set of the family photos is on dvdr and sent off to dad. bob
