how come i can't connect to my router automatically through vista home basic?
i've included the mac address into the router so by right everytime i turn on my laptop it should be able to connect to the router straight away right?
i need to manually connect to the router by typing the ssid and the passphrase everytime i want to connect to the router..can anybody help me with this?
by the way i'm using wpa-psk security and my ssid is set to be hidden so that is why i have to include my mac address..thanx=)
