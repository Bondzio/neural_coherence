I recently changed my MoBo and did not account for my non-sata IDE hard drives not being able to be accessed by the new all sata port mobo.
I tried using the sata to ide adaptors but to no avail.
I since went ahead and bought a sata HD, but how can I retrieve all my precious data from the old IDE drives and apply to my new system?
HELP PLEASE!!!
I run Windows XP with AMD Athalon 64X2 Core Processor 5200+, 271 GHz and 3.25 gigs of ram, ATI Radeon HD 3600 Video Card, Tascam FW-1082 WDM Audio Interface, with a Gigabyte MoBo
