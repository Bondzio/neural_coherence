thanks, i am already running a linksys printserver with my system upstair.
i print to the upstairs printer from my laptop downstarirs.
i guess where i am still confused is, if i hook another linksys ps to my downstairs printer, it will be a total stand alone.
can i then print through my wireless links router from the up stairs setup with my wireless laptop?
i don't think linksys make that very clear in the install instructions.
