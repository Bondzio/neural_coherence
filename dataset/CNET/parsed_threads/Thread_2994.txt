<s> I just got back from the Apple store where I was told there is no solution to my problem. </s>
<s> Maybe someone else has dealt with this differently? </s>
<s> I am using a 13&quot; MacBook with OS 10.6, I think. </s>
<s> I run iTunes and connect it to my stereo by way of a garden variety headphone plug to twin RCA cable. </s>
<s> I would like to get rid of the cable, roam around my house, and send my music directly to my amp and speakers via AirPort or some other solution. </s>
<s> The complication is that I also want to surf the web while listening. </s>
<s> I currently get my internet access via theft of a neighborhood WiFi that is not secure in any way. </s>
<s> This connection is so reliable and so fast that I simply gave up my DSL service (and my landline!) </s>
<s> and rely solely on the free WiFi. </s>
<s> Is there any way I can send a signal to a router or some other device, while still using a neighborhood WiFi? </s>
<s> Hope I have made my problem and my question clear. </s>
<s> Many thanks, Joe </s>
