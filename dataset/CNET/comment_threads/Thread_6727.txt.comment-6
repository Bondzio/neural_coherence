I think I decided on the MB or MBP.
Don't know which one yet.
I'm leaning towards the MB, since I can hopefully buy the extra monitor, new camera, and speakers, etc, with the money I save.
So, say I went with the pro, I might not be able to get a new camera or monitor.
Don't know yet though.
And if I bought this to replace my PC, then should I go with the Pro over the MB.
Thanks treeman
