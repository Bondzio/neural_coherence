My game requires a Nvidia GeForce 8600. Looking onlince, I see a multitude of 8400s, but no 8600s. I have a couple questions to ask: 1) Would it likely work with a 8400? I would not want to waste my time and money. 2) Are the PCI's extinct? Would it save me money in the long run to get a new mobo that works with PCIe cards? Thank you for the time, I would really appreciate your help, W|R

Let's find that 9500 card. -&gt; http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814187083 Remember these are rare and getting rarer. Bob

I have the slightly better 9500 video card and while it enables game play on the old box, it's not for those that want full effects and all the eye candy but the game does run. Your choice when it comes to this area. Bob
