my solution is to link the routers with the cable.
the wireless link is too hard on users and then the one wireless link i do use requires 3 devices.
that is 2 routers, a bridge/client and then that last router as an wap.
so no.
it's not easy and i've yet to find a tutorial to put into this small space.
