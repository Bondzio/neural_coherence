<s> ??? </s>
<s> i already had an old nvidia PCI video card, so i put that into the top PCI slot. </s>
<s> so here's the issue i knew i was going to face: how can i change the BIOS settings without a monitor? </s>
<s> any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, Jon. </s>
<s> You can't. </s>
<s> But no PC today allows you to change without a monitor. </s>

<s> DVI out, just get a DVI to VGA adapter (about $6) and it should solve your problems (it'll at least give you display) </s>
<s> no onboard video at all. </s>
<s> i ordered a PNY GeForce 7300 GS today. </s>
<s> if everything goes well, ill have my system up and running on wednesday. </s>
<s> woo. </s>
<s> it should be working with the nVidia board then (the old one) without problems, either the old hardware is damaged, or the new hardware is damaged, or you aren't telling the whole story </s>
