1.1.1	I am running 3 laptops on my home network ( MS router and MS adapters ) .	St
1.1.2	Only my HP Omnibook 1600 which had at first Windows2000 ( problem started there ) and now WinXP Professional 'disconnects ' after some time 'automatically ' from the Internet..the other 2 laptops do n't .	St
1.1.3	When I restart my HP Omnibook I am then also reconnected to the Internet .	St
1.1.4	The signal on this laptop , just 20 feet away from the router , is mostly 'low ' , whereas the third and older laptop , also HP and situated at almost the same distance , displays a strong signal .	St
1.1.5	HP blames Microsoft for the error and Microsoft blames HP !	St
1.1.6	The laptop in question has just been equipped with a new harddisk ( no change ! ) .	St
1.1.7	Any idea ?	Ques
1.2.1	or possibly a 'kink ' in your cable connection from it to the router ?	Ques
1.2.2	Or is this a wireless setup ?	Ques
1.2.3	As for the automatic disconnects , that 's a setting that needs to be unchecked for 'disconnect if connection may not be needed anymore ' ... .and it may be in your Dial Up Networking icon if you have one , or your 'disconnect if idle for more than x minutes ' box is checked , or in your modem settings .	St
1.2.4	Since you did n't say how you connect to the net , it 's hard to tell you where you have these settings until we know your setup .	St
1.2.5	TONI	St
