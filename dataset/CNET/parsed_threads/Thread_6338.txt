<s> I have a HP Pavillion ZV6130us laptop with ATI RADEON 200M graphics Card. </s>
<s> When i connect my laptop to TC and enable the tv as my primary display unit, i get a Black & White image of my desktop. </s>
<s> The output from Laptop is 7 pin Svideo, I use a Video only 4 pin Svideo for connecting to TV.The cable is a 4 pin Svideo to 3 RCA. </s>
<s> Is there a way by which I can enable Colour. </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Try to find and adapter between 7-pin and 4-pin S-video. </s>
<s> You have probably not properly connected the lines that transmit color. </s>
