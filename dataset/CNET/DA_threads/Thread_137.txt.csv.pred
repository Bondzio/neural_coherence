1.1.1	I 'm looking at an Asus F50 laptop and it says & quot ; G120 & quot ; graphics but I 'm not sure what this is ... is it the rumored & quot ; G102M & quot ; product I saw a story about a while back ?	Ques
1.2.1	there 's not such thing as a g120 in a netbook .	St
1.2.2	the asus f50/f70 are laptops for folks & quot ; on the go & quot ; .	St
1.2.3	the f50gx using nvidia 9400m graphics ; the f50z using an ati gpu that 's slightly faster .	St
1.2.4	the & quot ; g120 & quot ; ( if it exists ) is a rebranded nvidia 9500 ( the & quot ; g100 & quot ; is a 9400 ; and & quot ; g130 & quot ; is a 9600. google gts 250 and you 'll see that it 's the new brand for the 9800gtx ) .	St
1.2.5	there ' nothing special or revolutionary in this lineup .	St
1.3.1	essentially just another rebadging/shuffling of model numbers .	St
1.3.2	Although on balance I guess it makes mobile GPUs more in line with the GTX series of desktop ones ( and desktop replacement notebook GPUs ) .	St
