16 bit windows subsystem error in xp?
i purchased a new computer last fall with xp installed.
all applications that came pre-loaded and the once i loaded worked fine until 3 days ago.
then, out of the blue i get an error banner that says, &quot;16 bit windows subsystem&quot; the body of the error window says, &quot;c:\windows\system32\autoexec.nt.
the system file is not suitable for running ms-dos and microsoft windows applications.
choose 'close' to terminate the application.&quot; at the bottom are two buttons - close and ignore (nothing happens with ignore).
i tried the &quot;compatibility&quot; function with no luck.
i must have changed something, which i do from time ti time, that may have something to do with it but suddenly it will refuse to recognize older programs.
the once in question, i believe, are the 16 bit based once and i have a few of those.
could anyone help me with this please, it is very vital for me because i use some of the old graphic programs, card games, etc, etc.
any help will be much apreciated.
sincerely, helen
