assuming that it has regular rca input connections, you will need an adapter to convert rca to 3.5mm mini-jack on this converter, the rca ends (left and right) should be male while the 3.5mm mini-jack end should be female you will also need a cable with a male mini-jack on both ends.
the length of this will depend on the distance between your laptop and the stereo.
just plug it all in and select that input on the receiver.
if it has a optical input, then an optical cable between the laptop and the receiver is all you need.
once again, select that port on the receiver.
take a look at monoprice.com for all these cables and converters p
