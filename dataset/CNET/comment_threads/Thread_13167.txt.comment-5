But what do you mean by access point?
My router?
(I don't konw if my router supports SNMP or not) I went to both website that you told me and download the software from that site, but I have absolutely no idea how to work them out (since there is not a single EXE file within the archive).
All I wanted to do was to monitor what sites that my son had gone to.
Thank You!
