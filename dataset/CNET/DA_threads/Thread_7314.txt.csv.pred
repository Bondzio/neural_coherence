1.1.1	I have seen several places selling 512 mb ram online.	St
1.1.2	One is selling 2 256 mb sticks, for a cheaper price.	St
1.1.3	Are there any cons to buying x2 256 Mb rather than x1 512 Mb (Besides the consideration of a future upgrade)?	St
1.2.1	I only buy stuff from newegg.com The 2x256 is just $1 cheaper; look here: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820145477 and here: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820145026 So I'd get the 1 stick of 512, so that I could later upgrade to 1GB.	St
1.2.2	Or just buy 1GB right now.	Sug
1.2.3	Get the 1GB as 2 sticks of 512 so that you can have dual channel.	St
1.3.1	dual channel memory architecture, your system can only reach max performance with DIMMs of equal capacity in pairs in the same channel.	St
1.3.2	Bottom line, you can use one 512 DIMM vice two 256 DIMMs but doing so sacrifices performance.	St
1.3.3	The other thing is get all the RAM you intend to use on your system upfront... then later you won't face the problem of removing low density RAM to add higher density RAM or finding RAM the works reliably with the old RAM.	St
