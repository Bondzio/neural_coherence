i may not be able to help much but it's an interesting subject.
another alternative would be to not replace the electric things but the disk.
find an identical maxtor hd,remove your disk and put it into the new one.
i don't know how difficult that would be, but perhaps you could do it yourself.
i did something like that once but it was between two removable disk units.
it was something similar to iomega zip-drives.
but a hard disk might be a little more complicated.
