I don't have any kind of technical background with computers, so your help is greatly appreciated. I am getting into video editing and just got PowerDirector 9. Our current laptops could run it, but I would rather use a beefier machine that can handle it with ease. In addition to that, the computer would mostly be used for simple internet browsing and Microsoft Office 2010/beyond. We would like to store all of our photos on there as well. Without any true computing knowledge, I do not know how much computer I really need. I would like to keep the total package under $1,000. Any guidance, assistance, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I can post additional information if it is needed. Thank you!

A fast processor (a 2ghz+ at the minimum), graphics card, optical drive with write capability and some expansion slots for future upgrades. You CAN get one for under $1,000 but you will find that quality desktops capable of editing large movies will run over your budget. You don't have much computing expierience...are you comfortable attempting digital editing?

As for the digital editing, the program I got is called Power Director 9... it had very good reviews and the demo was easy to use. I am pretty good with user-friendly software, just not tech specs. To be honest, most of this editing will just be photos and not actual video... I would be creating DVD slideshows set to music with some graphical overlays and/or transitions, but I don't plan on much beyond that. What kind of processor does that put me in? 2ghz+ makes sense, but what I struggle with is Intel vs. Athlon vs....? I just don't know. I was thinking probably 1TB of memory, so that sounds good. Other specs though? Are there any particular brands I should or shouldn't check out? I know this is subjective, but I have no frame of reference and need input. Thanks so much for the response!

Since you are creating DVD slide shows you will need an optical drive with writable capability. If you can afford it you should get one that will write to both standard DVD's and Blu-ray. This will allow you to produce DVD's for a wider variety of players (important if your selling these). Also look for a term called LightScribe. LightScribe is a method of burning data into DVDs. It also allows you to &quot;print&quot; artwork directly onto a dvd vs having to print out a label and sticking it onto the dvd later. This is what the pros use and it will give your DVD's a more professional quality. It doesn't add much more to the cost anyway. Processors are a different matter. You want the best processor you can afford. Both Intel and Atheon make good processors. I would recommend no less than an Intel i5 Core processor as your minimum (or the Atheon equivelant). The processor is like your computers brain and the faster the processor, the faster your computer. Also make sure that your computer has the appropriate connections for whatever your using to record your pics / movies. I would recommend no fewer that 4 USB ports. Be nice if it came with an eSATA port but I don't think that is essential (eSATA ports are going to be the USB replacements and are much faster that the current USB ports). If you will be using a camcorder take a look at the cables that came with it and make sure the computer can accomadate them. If the computer comes with a graphics card it should be able to. Make sure you have a graphics card. I will be honest, you will have to trust the salesman on this as I don't know too much about graphics cards. Again you will need to get the best you can afford as that will make your editing easier. As far as computer brands go almost all of the major brands are good. I don't know too much about the Systemax brand other than they sell for cheap. I would stay away from them. Dell, Lenovo / IBM, apple, HP, etc. are all good. I will say that everyone I know that works in video /photography has strongly recommended apple and they use apple computers for their editing. Might look into those but they will be expensive. Hope this helps.

I don't plan on selling an DVD's (though that could be a good business opportunity!); it is more for family/friend purposes. I will be making the slideshow for my upcoming wedding with the software, and may do the same for other friends getting married soon. I'm at the age where our families start to grow, too, so I'm sure I can use the software to chronicle those memories as well. If a business springs out of it, great! I did consider Apple, but I really want to stick with a PC. I can't stand using Microsoft Office on a Mac... and I will be using that fairly frequently as well. I think the software I have will be more than adequate for my purposes and should be fine on the PC. Thanks for that suggestion though. Again, thank you for the input and I will get to looking around. Much appreciated!
