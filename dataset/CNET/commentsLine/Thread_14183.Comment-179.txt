i started using a personal computer when i was in my college time that was 1999 its my 3rd year in college my pc was a pentium iiimmx technology only 400mhz processor but i used to play before a 3d game which is the counterstrike game which i know it was very popular to all..my computer was still fast before because i was only using a windows 98 with 128mb memory...but when i did have updated with a windows xp my pc gets slower and i can't play my counterstrike game anymore...only games that are not 3d can be played...but i still love my first pc...cliff
