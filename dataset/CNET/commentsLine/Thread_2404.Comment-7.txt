thnx to willy, proffitt and jmarchi for your extremely quick responses.
sorry for the lengthy question, but i was trying to make clear what i'm looking for, and i obviously failed.
i misled willy, i'm not trying to recover from a specific event.
i want a general and permanent increase in capability.
physically swapping hard drives just doesn't cut it - too time consuming and damage-prone.
also, i don't want to convert to external easily swappable hard drives - too expensive.
thanks for the references, though, i'll check them out.
google returns some interesting urls for bios.
as for linux booting from another hard drive, isn't that done by having special software on c:?
my compaq bios doesn't allow anything but a:, c: or d: as the boot device.
let me ask it another way.
does anyone know of someone who regularly does what i want?
(boot windows 2000 from other than c: and without requiring c: to be available.)
if so, how do they do it?
