<s> I have a eMachines T5212 with a dual pentium (2.66) with an intigrated video card. </s>
<s> As of now im thinking about getting the XFX geforce 8600 GTS extream, thinking that the XXX may run a little hot from what ive read from people, and I dont know if the 8800 will fit in my case (but im not sure). </s>
<s> My question is, which works best with Intel Nvidia or ATI or does it matter. </s>
<s> And are my assumptions about the overheating and size correct. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> hey dude. </s>
<s> you are absolutely right about the size and overheating. </s>
<s> now i have seen the 8800 GTX with my own 2 eyes. </s>
<s> It measures exactly 10.5 inches in length. </s>
<s> I measured it because I'm planning to have one in my new system. </s>
<s> so i would suggest you measure the distance from your available PCI-Express slot (the one u want to use) to whatever the graphics card may touch. </s>
<s> If it is less than 11 inches, you probably can't put the GTX in there. </s>
<s> Also, since the GTX is power hungry, it requires two 6-pin PCI-E power connections from the power supply. </s>
<s> Make sure your power supply has these connections. </s>
<s> And, how many watts does your PSU output ? </s>
<s> I would want at least about 700W if I'm planning to have a GTX. </s>
<s> Finally, what kind of cooling does your case have. </s>
<s> Make sure it has good air flow and ventilation, or perhaps you may think about water cooling. </s>
<s> Bottom line is this (for 8800 GTX): about 11 inches clearance, two 6-pin PCI-E power connections from the Power supply, at least 700W power output, and good cooling. </s>
<s> About Nvida vs ATI, I'd go with Nvidia. </s>
<s> I believe its more popular and widely used than ATI. </s>
<s> But go with whatever works best for you. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Good lookin out. </s>
<s> I just bought this power supply on ebay http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&ih=011&sspagename=STRK%3AMEWN%3AIT&viewitem=&item=320110842716&rd=1&rd=1 . </s>
<s> It doesnt say it has ANY 6 pin PCI-E connection. </s>
<s> I hope this will work with an 8600/8800 card or i just threw away 30 bucks. </s>
<s> DO I need to worry about the height or just the length is what can be a concern. </s>
<s> I hope the prices go down once ATI releases their dx10 cards. </s>
<s> but the PSU you bought does not have any PCI-E power connections. </s>
<s> It's not gonna work with your 8600 or 8800. </s>
<s> Keep in mind the 8600s need one 6-pin PCI-E, while the 8800s need two 6-pin PCI-Es. </s>
<s> Considering the height, there is one concern: Your card (if it is an 8800) is going to block the adjacent PCI (or PCI express) slot because it is pretty thick and covers 2 slots instead of 1. </s>
<s> This is not a hazard or anything. </s>
<s> It just means that the slot below (with the case upright) your 8800 card will become useless. </s>
<s> If you need a good power supply which will supply enough power to your graphics card (and everything else), I recommend the Thermaltake W0106RU ATX 12V 2.2 700W Power Supply. </s>
<s> You can get it on this page: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817153039 .As you'll see, it has 2 PCI-E power connections just for your graphics card(s). </s>
<s> It has modular cabling so you don't have unused cables lying around in your case blocking the flow of air. </s>
<s> And, it has really good reviews (about 91% positive 4star/5star reviews). </s>
<s> I know its a bit expensive but you need it or something like it for your graphics card. </s>
<s> Hope this helps </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I was reading more into the power supply issue for the conection to my card and found that they make a adaptor which takes 2-4pin connections and converts them into a 6pin if I understand this corrcetly. </s>
<s> I think most cards come with this adaptor. </s>
<s> Im thinking of going with the PNY 8800 GTS (640MB). </s>
<s> Thanks for your help </s>
<s> This is what I would need correct?? </s>

<s> Running on my Dell with stock 305W PSU. </s>
<s> Card minimum is 300W. </s>
<s> Dell underrates their PSU's. </s>
<s> Card just fits in slot with no additional power connections needed. </s>
<s> If you go to a 8600GTS one is needed. </s>
