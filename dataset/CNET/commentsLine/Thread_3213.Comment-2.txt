yes.
i am a bit confused of what do you really want to do with your network.
but if i understood it correctly you have a mac laptop and you are also planning to buy a lenovo.
there are wireless cards that both are compatible with a mac computer and a computer running through windows better look for those device.
i bet linksys have one, and it have drives for both mac and windows.
