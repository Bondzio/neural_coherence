hi, my client requires a robust wifi connection in their premise for 200 users.
the premise consist of 2 floors with 8000sqft each.
the nature of the business of my client is e-commerce and the internet usage would be heavy.
i am currently looking at deploying a wlan controller with up to 8 aps (4 per floor), a load balancer to bind 2 wan lines and a fortigate 600c firewall to manage the traffic.
i am looking at using aruba and peplink or f5 at the moment.
one of the most important requirement from my client --&gt; near 100% network uptime.
would appreciate if anyone out there could provide an insight if i am missing out on anything important or could recommend me a better solution.
