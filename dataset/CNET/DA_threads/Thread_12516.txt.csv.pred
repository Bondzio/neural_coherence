1.4.1	You 'd have to know their specs and test them .	St
1.4.2	What you 'd be looking for is how much current they offer versus a standard charger .	St
1.4.3	As well , a good charger will sense the amount of current being drawn and adjust itself accordingly .	St
1.4.4	USB attachment to a PC or non-dedicated charging device may work ... or work somewhat ... but this is n't a substitute for a proper charger .	St
1.5.1	If you read the usual USB spec , the power should be off until a PC commands the hub to power up .	St
1.5.2	Of course there may be a hub that does n't meet the USB specs .	St

1.8.2	The key for your needs is the flexibility of various different connections and/or universal one if supplied ( adapter ? ) .	St

1.8.4	You may find that such a station may offer to charge only similar same devices because so many devices get used and returned to be charged .	St
