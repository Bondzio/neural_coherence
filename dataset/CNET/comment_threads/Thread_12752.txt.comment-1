Somehow my seagate has paralyzed a partition of 3 resetting it to raw AND unallocated, dividing it.
(how i dont know) from ntfs.
An option apart from data gathering is; to get data from an unallocated I think remaking the paramaters might help-how do you do this without reformatting, or better, can one roll the drive back to its original settings-an hope of that?
Maybe reformat it then find data?quick format.
