1.1.1	Is this possible?	St
1.1.2	I have a desktop that is having internet connection problems, and I'd like to connect it to my laptop so I can download some anti-spyware software and scan that machine.	St
1.1.3	I guess I'm saying I'd like to use the desktop as an external hard drive.	St
1.1.4	I think it will make the whole process easier.	St
1.1.5	I'd preferably like to do this through a usb cable (because that is what I own).	St
1.1.6	In my mind this should work... but I don't want to try it and end up messing up one of the machines.	St
1.1.7	Thanks, Java Trish	St
1.2.1	Are you trying to fix the desktop machine or just use it as a file server?	St
1.2.2	Certainly you can network the two and use the connection to transfer software and bypass the need to connect the ailing machine to the internet.	St
1.2.3	Is there strong reason to suspect spyware is the major cause of it's problems and are you attempting to repair and return it to active duty?...or just leave it as a server.	St
1.2.4	This could affect the responses you will get.	St
1.3.1	Sorry that I wasn't too clear.	St
1.3.2	I am trying to fix the internet connection on the desktop.	St
1.3.3	I plan to download some items (anti-spyware software and winsockfix.exe) and run them on that machine.	St
1.3.4	I guess I'm just trying to skip the middleman of putting the apps from my laptop to a jump drive or cd, and just transferring it straight from my laptop to the desktop.	St
1.3.5	I do not intend this to be a permanent thing (ie I'm not going to use it as a file server).	St
1.3.6	As I mentioned before, I'd like to do this via USB, if possible.	St
1.3.7	I suspect it is spyware, or possibly a break in the TCP/IP chain because this machine had previously communicated online, and now cannot, even with a new modem.	St
1.3.8	For more info on that, you can check out my other post at: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7584-0.html?forumID=63&threadID=61372&messageID=728204 Anyway, I had done some research on this problem, and would like to try some things out.	St
1.3.9	The irony in this is that not having an internet connection makes it all that more difficult.	St
1.3.10	I hope that information helps.	St
1.3.11	Thanks, Java Trish	St
1.4.1	from the message link provided, you have quite a task.	St
1.4.2	Yes, a USB cable should work if the ports are configured on both.	St
1.4.3	And, if both are XP, there are wizards to assist.	St
1.4.4	You will be creating a network.	St
1.4.5	You will need to, not only connect them, but get them to agree to communicate.	St
1.4.6	You do not need to transfer AV and spyware programs but can install them right from the other machine if the installation executable is available.	St
1.4.7	As for the problem getting on line, this is another issue.	St
1.4.8	I am guessing that the &quot;data&quot; you see coming across is just the communication overhead and not really useful bytes of information.	St
1.4.9	Good luck and post your progress.	Polite
1.5.1	Great!	St
1.5.2	Thanks for the information!	St
1.5.3	I will be connectiong the two machines (yes, both are XP), this evening, and will hopefully be able to fix the problem.	St
1.5.4	I spent 8 hours working on it last weekend, with no success.	St
1.5.5	I have a few more battle plans this time around, so hopefully things will work out.	St
1.5.6	I will update my progress.	St
1.5.7	Thanks, Java Trish	St
1.6.1	by banging my head against a problem until it's resolved, or so messed up that no one can fix it.	St
1.6.2	:) That relentlessness alone has plenty of value.	Polite
1.6.3	Even if I give up, I have probably learned something I can use later.	St
1.6.4	Keep at it and good luck.	St
1.6.5	Please post back any further needs as there are plenty of folks here willing to take a shot at about anything.	St
1.6.6	Good luck.	St
1.7.1	Thanks for your help!	St
1.7.2	It turns out after all of that, I didn't even have the cable with me to connect the two machines.	St
1.7.3	So...	St
1.7.4	I just ended up transferring things via my jump drive.	St
1.7.5	Thank you for the information, though, because it was something I had been wondering about, anyway.	St
1.7.6	It ended up taking me another 4 hours to get it up and running, but that is mostly because I had to download things over a dial-up connection.	St
1.7.7	Anyway, if you want to hear all the gory details about it, you can read about it on my other post: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7584-0.html?forumID=63&threadID=61372&messageID=742320 Thanks again!	St
