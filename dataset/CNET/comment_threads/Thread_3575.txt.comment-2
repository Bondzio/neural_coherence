The Pentium I or plain Pentium was a max.
of 233Mhz.
The PII was better up to 800Mhz, I believe.
Even, if you had the better Pentium, the advances are so great that getting a new system of at least 2.0Ghz or better is well worth the expense, some are only $500 for a complete system , including s/w, you do the math.
