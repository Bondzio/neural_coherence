bought Gateway last year.
The word seems to be just getting out.I have at present 5 Gateway and 1 Acer machines.
I'm hoping that the tech support will improve at gateway, but I won't hold my breath.
I had a couple of Acer's back in the '90's and they were great.
I went to Gateway because they had a tech facility and showroom here.
That is gone about 2 years now.
Tech support with either (now the same I suppose)has always been spotty or iffy.
