<s> Here is the problem. </s>
<s> Occasionally, my computer will not boot. </s>
<s> When this happens, it appears to be caused by the boot hard drive not being recognized. </s>
<s> When this occurs, if I restart it several times, the drive will get recognized and then I can boot to XP Professional SP2. </s>
<s> When I am in XP, I can work for a while but then the PC freezes. </s>
<s> I can still see the display on the monitor, but everything is completely frozen. </s>
<s> I have to reboot. </s>
<s> When I reboot, most of the time the boot hard drive isn't recognized and (as mentioned above), I have to reboot several times. </s>
<s> Sometimes, I just have to let it sit over night. </s>
<s> I originally thought it could be a heat issue. </s>
<s> However, it happens on a fresh boot after sitting all day. </s>
<s> Here are some specs: - Windows XP Pro SP2 - 2 Seagate SATA drives (&lt; 2 years old) - No Raid, just connected via SATA - 1.5 gigs of DDR RAM What I have done: - Ran Windows Defender - came up clean - Ran AVG Antivirus scan - came up clean - Recently reformatted boot drive </s>
<s> I forgot to mention I also ran the Seagate drive diagnostics (full scan) - came up clean. </s>
<s> dito. </s>
<s> its not the hdd. </s>
<s> is your computer a dell? </s>
<s> mine still does it.i have no idea </s>
<s> ...your hard drive or IDE controller is failing and needs to be replaced. </s>
<s> I would start with the replacing the hard drive, since that will be the easiest part to replace. </s>
<s> You can install the new hard drive and test out the OS to see if it still locks up. </s>
<s> If it does, then it's possible that the IDE controller is failing and you'll need to replace the system board (presuming it's an on-board controller like other system boards). </s>
<s> A less likely, but still possible, cause is that the memory is faulty, which is easy enough to fix, but the odds that this is the problem is highly unlikely. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>

<s> This has been a problem for me, until I discovered that a magnetic field was affecting my hard drive. </s>
<s> Solution: 1)Remove all speakers, phones and DSL modems from closeness to the motherboard; 2) Demagnatize the hard drive by disconnecting the cable at both ends that go to the drive and to the motherboard for approximately 15 seconds: 3) Reconnect, plug in power and reboot. </s>
<s> This will happen several more times as long as that field is somewhere inside of your PC circuits. </s>
<s> However, a repeat of the above procedure always rescued me. </s>
<s> My friend had a similar problem. </s>
<s> The problem is your hard drive. </s>
<s> When your HDD is working, backup all your files, and then reinstall OS on a new HDD. </s>
<s> They're really cheap now a days. </s>
<s> Almost always on sale. </s>
<s> About $40-60 for 160GB </s>
<s> Hi, I happend to have enjoyed and extremely similar issue with my Dell Latitude 600 laptop, running XP Pro+SP2. </s>
<s> At boot time I could capture a &quot;IO Read error: cannot read/find ArcBoot signature&quot; (or something pretty close to this) before the message is wiped away and it ends up saying there is no bootable disk. </s>
<s> Problem was repeating and insisting on trying to boot wouldn't help (in which this seems to differ from your description). </s>
<s> It turned out that after bringing the laptopto a friend's place where XP StartupCDs were available (I thought I'd to reinitialise the system completely), the boot suddenly worked. </s>
<s> Back home it failed again. </s>
<s> I suspected a false contact between the disk controller connector and the (removable) C: drive. </s>
<s> So, I kind of gently shook the (powered-off) laptop a couple of times in several directions, after which the system booted again... </s>
<s> Even though I initially thought it might have been a disk surface problem with the boot area, it would seem it was something completely different. </s>
<s> I hope something as easy as this is happening to your own laptop... </s>
<s> Success! </s>
<s> Arnie </s>
<s> been ther done that </s>
<s> Thanks for all of your input. </s>
<s> This drive is still under warranty. </s>
<s> It is a 200 GB SATA Seagate drive. </s>
<s> I am first going to open the case up and reseat everything. </s>
<s> I am also going to swap the SATA cables to eliminate a cable issue. </s>
<s> I am going to attempt to run the drive diagnostics again. </s>
<s> After that, I'll see what happens. </s>
<s> I suppose then I will have to install my OS in my other drive. </s>
<s> I'll see if the problem goes with the drive or not. </s>
<s> I guess that will then tell me if my MB is FUBAR. </s>
<s> I have a replacement board picked out at Newegg for under $50. </s>
<s> Can anyone see any issues w/ my plan? </s>
<s> Thanks again, Jason </s>
<s> I had a similiar problem with a fairly new tower. </s>
<s> What I found out was a faulty power plug that was giving intermitten voltage to the hard drive. </s>
<s> You might try and change to another power plug and see if that works. </s>
<s> Let me know how it works out. </s>
<s> radiotech950@sbcglobal.net </s>
<s> There can be multiple causes that leads to problem such as this. </s>
<s> I had similar problem on my laptop (an IBM Thnkpad)before. </s>
<s> Just FYI. </s>
<s> This was what I did: I took out the seemd problematic hard drive and replace it with a new hard drive and tried to install Winodws XP on it. </s>
<s> It wouldn't install .Then I knew the problem was probablly with the Motherboard. </s>
<s> I took it to IBM service to have them check it out for me. </s>
<s> The service engineer told me that the problem can bee either with chipset(Hardware) on the board or the that drived the chipset. </s>
<s> In my case,lucky enough, it turned out that the firmware was out of date and wouldn't work with the level of Windows on the hard drive. </s>
<s> He downloaded the latest firmware from IBM site installed it and the hard drive booted properly. </s>
<s> And I wasn't charged for that. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Good luck.God bless. </s>
<s> May the force be with you :-)) Jacob </s>
<s> I had a similar problem. </s>
<s> It was due to installing and later uninstalling downloaded programs from the net over a period of time. </s>
<s> They had left a lot of junk in the registry. </s>
<s> I got a Registry cleaner program mine was System Cleaner (4 in 1) that also gets rid of other junk, but there are free ones about. </s>
<s> Now when I uninstall programs, I go into the registry to thoroughly remove all junk files belonging to the programs left behind... Back up registry first. </s>
<s> (XP/Me - create a system-restore point). </s>
<s> Go to Start &gt; Run - type in ''regedit'' (without '''') Press F3 start the search facility. </s>
<s> Type in name of deleted program. </s>
<s> When I find an old entry with the program name, I delete it. </s>
<s> I know one has to be careful when making changes to the registry, but I've never had a problem with this method and I am careful only to delete those files that have the name of the deleted program. </s>
<s> If I am not sure, I leave it alone. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> i have the newest bios and I installed a new hdd and loaded xp. </s>
<s> not because of the startup just wanted a bigger hdd thought it would fix that problem but it still wont see my drive if the computer is on i can restart all i want but if its off for a while i have to reboot 3 or 4 times </s>
