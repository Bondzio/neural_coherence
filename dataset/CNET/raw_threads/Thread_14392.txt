Now it wont boot at all. When i power it up everything turns on but nothing is displayed on the screen no beeps or anything. I have tested another power supply and video card with no luck. I did take off the heat sink and noticed that the thermal paste became liquified and leaked onto the processor and inside the other side of the processor which i cleaned off. But still no luck. Any Suggestions. I am pretty tech savvy but this one is confusing me?

These were known to cascade into something of a thermal overrun condition. Also, I suppose if you're thermal paste was of the metal powder type and this got into the pins and sockets, you could have lost the CPU, MB or both.
