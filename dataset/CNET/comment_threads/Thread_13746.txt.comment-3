disconnect everything.
connect the power supply to the mobo.
connect the cpu cooler to the mobo.
connect the optical drive only.
install 1 stick of ram.
if you have access to a pci-based video card, use it instead of the gx2.
if you must use the gx2, make sure you're using an 8pin and a 6pin power connector since two 6pin connectors won't work.
