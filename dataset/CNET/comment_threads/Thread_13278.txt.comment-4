Hello, you are correct.
Most modern video cards are AGP4/8x compliant.
I'm a big fan of Nvidia's as they have had a better track record in driver support and overall visual quality (imo).
Your best two bets for video cards of the DX9 genre are the Nvidia Geforce FX 5700 Ultra and/or the Geforce FX 5900 series cards.
The 5700 series cards are great for those machines with little 250 watt power supplys (ie Dell) and the 5900 series cards are the best bang for buck options which will play most games without costing $400-$600.
Check your power supply wattage as well and video card clearance (around the AGP slot) as these cards are pretty lengthy and have bigger cooling devices.
Good Luck!
