1.3.1	Oops -- I was n't as clear as I thought in my first message .	St
1.3.2	I 'm looking for recommendations on specific models others have found valuable -- 19 & quot ; -21 & quot ; LCDs that are especially good with displaying text .	St
1.3.3	Are there others here who work primarily with text , not graphics , and who can recommend screens they like for that ?	Ques
1.3.4	I thought I saw an article on CNET a week or two ago along these lines , but I can not find it now .	St
1.3.5	Thanks , Brian	St
1.4.1	I 'm still using a CRT moose ... Samsung SyncMaster 1100P that works great .	St
1.4.2	http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & lr= & q=reviews % 2C+LCDs & btnG=Search The PC Magazine link has a number reviews .	St
1.4.3	You can also see 'buyer ' comments on their purchases over at NewEgg.com .	St
1.4.4	VAPCMD PS..Most of the 20 & quot ; LCDs have a slightly smaller dot pitch than the 19 & quot ; units .	St
1.5.1	All , Since I am looking for a large LCD ( 19-21 & quot ; ) that I will run at non-native resolution ( 1024 x 768 or possibly 1280 x 1024 ) , will I get better image quality from a screen with more dots per inch ?	Ques
1.5.2	That is , will smaller dots create crisper text when the text is scaled larger , or would fewer dots per inch be better , since its native resolution would be closer to what I 'm using ?	Ques
1.5.3	Thanks for any thoughts on how this works , Brian	Polite
1.6.1	I was at best buy and showed someone what happens when we change the resolution .	St
1.6.2	No one can assure you it will work so maybe you have to get out and see it ?	Ques
