<s> my msn messenger is upperg@gmail.com add me </s>

<s> A PC desktop. </s>
<s> One which he could play games on. </s>
<s> That list posted by ramarc looks good; I'd just change the video card to this Radeon X1800XT for $200 from newegg. </s>
<s> That card is faster than both the 7900GS and X1900GT. </s>
<s> Hell, it's as fast as the much-pricier 7900GT. </s>
<s> do you have msn so i can like discuss this? </s>
<s> i need to know a couple of more thing before i can start buying and if you have a different list so i can give it to my dad to compare and contrast </s>
<s> Most people aren't willing to give out their MSN address on a public forum because someone might spam them. </s>
<s> dont go with an intel, amd is better take the 1100 dollar one and change the mobo/ processor to this 4400 processor http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16819103529 compatible good mobo http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813128306 </s>

<s> why do you want to build a computer yourself when you can customize a pc on like alienware's site or like a dell xps or hp for a good price that are great manufacturers for gaming and multimedia with space to download things. </s>
<s> you dont need 2 gig ram even with high end games. </s>
<s> I have BF2 and call of duty 2. </s>
<s> These are games that reguire more than counter strike games and i still have space. </s>
<s> also.... why would you buy products from bidding sites. </s>
<s> The littlest thing can mess any type of card. </s>
<s> If you build your own pc dont get things that are on bidding cause you cant always take their word if they say it's new or if it's in good condition. </s>
<s> o yea are you also getting accessories like a printer, router, etc.... </s>
<s> in alienware i tried customize and doing the same thing part by part or different brand alienware comes out 1900$ and the parts comes out 1230$ yes with printer/scanner combo keyboard and 19&quot; screen </s>
