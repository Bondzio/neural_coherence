The first problem I had with it about six months ago was that the CD drive burned out. A few days ago I was viewing CNN's web page when suddenly the screen stretched sideways (horizontal plane). I used the digital screen controls to bring it back to size, but the icons on the left and right margins are smaller and narrower.Distortion persists in these areas. I've reformatted C, loaded up all my programs again, including the drivers, controllers, etc., but the problem persists. I need heeeeeeeeeeeelp! My thanks to those of you who wrote in about my jumpy cursor. I took your advice. The cure was simple: a new mouse. Thanks again, Norman De Sola
