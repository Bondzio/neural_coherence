<s> I've recently had a problem with my USB mouse. </s>
<s> The cursor was locking, and after some time the same happened with my keyboard. </s>
<s> So I decided to take my PC to a technician and he replaced my USB mouse with a serial mouse since the problem seemed to be with the USB ports. </s>
<s> Now my problem with this mouse is that it frequently acts very strangely in that right-click menus open suddenly without me having touched the mouse. </s>
<s> Also sometimes the cursor changes its position on the monitor, yet the mouse is not being moved. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me with this problem please? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> whens the last time you ran an updated virus scan? </s>
<s> Do you have a PS/2 port for the mouse? </s>
<s> I have scanned my PC with no viruses detected. </s>
<s> Yeah I have a USB/PS2 port, but I had to change that mouse since the ports seem to be faulty. </s>
<s> The PS2 mouse was not working. </s>
<s> Therefore my technician advised me to work with a serial mouse, which I am doing, but with this little problem. </s>
<s> If both your USB and PS/2 ports don't work then there is something drastically wrong with the system. </s>
<s> There is no correlation between USB and PS/2, so if both broke it is not surprising that the Serial mouse doesn't work either. </s>
<s> Are you having any other problems with this system? </s>
<s> How old is it, what hardware are we talking about here, is this a REAL old system? </s>
