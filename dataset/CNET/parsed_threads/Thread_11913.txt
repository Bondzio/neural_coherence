<s> Hi, last week I findally had time to assemble my pc like I did it in school before, to be sure I also checked my mainboard manual, when I press the on/off switch on my power supply on the back of my computer and then I press the powerswitch in front of my case, nothing happends, only the leds are burning, the first time when I did this, I heard the air coming out in the back of my pc, but it went out after 1 min, and now I never getted that again and nothing happends except for the leds burning My leds are working so I don't think my mainboard is fried and my dad thinks there is something wrong with the power supply, it's 350 watt btw. </s>
<s> Anybody got an idea? </s>
<s> De computer -------------- Amd Sempron 2600+ K8N Neo3 (agr slot+pci-e en pci slots) 512 MB Ram pc 3200 corsair 120 gb hd maxtor Sapphire Radeon 9600 pro DvD Writer van Benq </s>
<s> Is this your motherboard: MSI K8N Neo3-F ? </s>
<s> If so, there are two problematic areas noted in RED. </s>
<s> RED ITEM ONE: What is the voltage rating on the memory module (MSI says 2.5V is compatible)? </s>
<s> What voltage setting does the BIOS have for the memory? </s>
<s> RED ITEM TWO: Although the MSI compatibility list for the AGR slot is probably incomplete, the Sapphire 9600 Pro is not on the list of tested compatible cards. </s>
<s> If you can, I would consider returning that board for one that is known to support your card or has a standard AGP slot. </s>
<s> Maybe get a motherboard that has less issues in general. </s>
<s> Remove all HD and CD drives, use only the floppy for now. </s>
<s> Have a bootable floppy and upon booting enter the bios and be suree no CD&HD present, save and exit out. </s>
<s> Reboot and try to boot from FD. </s>
<s> If it actually boots, you have power issues, your psu is too weak or lacking. </s>
<s> Further, repelace with a decent namebrand and be at least 400W+ or better. </s>
<s> Of course recheck all connections, ect. </s>
<s> and teardown to see that no shorts are present, DON'T TAKE ANYTHING for granted. </s>
<s> Reseat all cables/harnesses/wiring and be 100% sure that's where it goes. </s>
<s> Also, you you see any video display at any time during boot-up, even before the problem came up? </s>

<s> I have no fdd, and it doesn't give any power at all, I used a voltmeter and it gave zero's. </s>
<s> No voltage, then how are the LEDs lit? </s>
<s> It seems some of the psu's voltages are kaput, replace. </s>
<s> But, please reduce the system as I explained in the previous message. </s>
<s> You can always add the devices later. </s>
<s> Since, this is a new build, again recheck the work and make sure no standoffs are shorting the mtrbd. </s>
<s> backside, etc.. </s>
<s> If you checked the psu w/o the mtrbd. </s>
<s> attached, understand the psu needs a &quot;load&quot; in order to turn-ON. </s>
<s> There are ATX psu simple testers yes/no condition. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Is psu the same as cpu? </s>
<s> My cpu is given in my first post. </s>
<s> I've tried your tip and it didn't work, my mainboard says also a minimum from 350watt and not 400, (using 350 now). </s>
<s> I'm just going back to the shop saturday, I still have 2 years of warranty. </s>

<s> There are ATX psu simple testers yes/no condition.&quot; What you mean by this? </s>
<s> It needs a load? </s>
<s> And how I do that. </s>
<s> The psu is a &quot;switching power supply&quot;, the load is simply the mtrbd. </s>
<s> attached. </s>
<s> If you test with no mtrbd. </s>
<s> or no load attached, the psu isn't capable to turn-ON. </s>
<s> I usggested an ATX type tester as it's safe to use. </s>
<s> There is a trick, but I won't do that for a novice, safety issue IMHO. </s>
<s> But google for such if you like, up to you. </s>
