i've been running ipconfig /all on all computers i have in my house.
all ips are different.
the only thing that's the same for every computer is the deafult gateway, dns servers, dhcp server and subnet mask.
here's what i get after running ipconfig /all in this computer: connection specific dns suffix: home description : atheros at5005gs wireless network adapter physical address: 00-0e-2e-a0-4a-b6 dhcp activated: yes autoconfig activated: yes ip address: 192.168.1.88 subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 default gateway: 192.168.1.1 dhcp server: 192.168.1.1 dns servers: 192.168.1.1 incase i haven't stated yet, i'm running on windows xp sp3 and my modem is a hitron technologies voice wireless gateway bvw-3653.
