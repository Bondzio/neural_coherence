i have seen that in the $400-600 range for desktops, i can get an intel e-series dual core chip and 4 gigs of ram, although occasionally in that range i can also find intel's i-3 chip.
often, looking at 2 similar comps, i'll see one with ddr2 and the other with ddr3.
but i take your advice about needing to compare overall systems.
when i'm ready to buy, i'll post links of two systems i'm thinking about and i'll let you folks have at it.
thanks.
