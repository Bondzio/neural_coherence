1.1.1	The computer , an HP ( I ca n't remember the model at this time ) was shut off for a few days while we were out of town .	St
1.1.2	When we returned , the power strip was turned back on .	St
1.1.3	When the power button on the tower was pushed the monitor turned on but we heard a & quot ; zap & quot ; like sound and the PC did n't come on .	St
1.1.4	I tried changing plugs , power strips , power cords but the computer will not turn on .	St
1.1.5	We 've been able to plug a different computer into the same outlet and it works so we 've ruled that out .	St
1.1.6	Can this be fixed ?	Ques
1.1.7	If so how and how much should it cost ?	Ques
1.2.1	Please refer to last portion for final fix .	St
1.2.2	Because you mentioned a & quot ; zap & quot ; or similar that 's not a good sign .	St
1.2.3	Depending on the age of the system it will cost a few $ to get going again , provided you want to .	St
1.2.4	In most cases , its either the power supply ( PSU ) or the mtrbd .	St
1.2.5	at fault .	St
1.2.6	If it the PSU , replace and rte-try again to power-ON system .	St
1.2.7	If it still does n't work , then replace the mtrbd .	St
1.2.8	which being a HP one , is n't cost effective unless you still have warranty or if YES to that , use it before doing anything else .	St
1.2.9	If it is the mtrbd .	St
1.2.10	you could possibility replace it , etc .	St
1.2.11	but then you have a new set of problems to deal with .	St
1.2.12	The course of action depends on your investigative results .	St
1.2.13	Open case and look closely for any burnt , popped , or dangling component .	St
1.2.14	You need to look very closely or follow your nose .	St
1.2.15	If the PSU , it wo n't be necessarily visible .	St
1.2.16	If no warranty , then replace the PSU as the cheapest course of action if no sound comes from the system when powered-ON .	St
1.2.17	FIX : If it repairs cost too much , you do n't want to deal with it or feel its more bother that worth , then pitch it out the window and KNOW the reason it wo n't work .	St
1.2.18	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	I hope it 's the PSU ... but if not , out the window it goes !	St
1.3.2	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.4.1	If you have critical data on the HD you want to save , remove it if all else fails .	St
1.4.2	You can mount the HD into an ext .	St
1.4.3	HD case and rretrieve data or install as 2nd HD in another system , that way .	St
1.4.4	As another cure for your problem , again if all else fails , check eBay or Craigslist for an exact same HP model # in order to continue on or even another HP system at reasonable cost .	St
1.4.5	You can install old HD in order to retrieve data then or swap HDs , it may boot if exact HP models ( maybe ? ) .	Ques
