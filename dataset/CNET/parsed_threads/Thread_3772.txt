<s> The gateway I am wanting to get only comes available with an Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Extreme Audio. </s>
<s> For heavy gaming will this be enough? </s>
<s> It costs $80 extra and I know that is extremely pricey. </s>
<s> But I really dont feel like having to mess with it as soon as I buy it. </s>
<s> Please let me know if you have used this card for gaming and were not impressed with it. </s>
<s> If you think buying a ExtremeMusic or ExtremeGamer seperately would be a better choice for hard core gaming. </s>
