well, it's that time of the year to format and redo for me.
my usual back up drive is a wd passport usb 80gb drive, i use it constantly.
today i was dumb and formatted it and tried to install leopard on it and couldn't get it running.
so after that i try to go back into windows and format it so i can use it as a backup again and it didn't show up in my computer.
i did the obvious and replugged it in and got an unknown device what ever, so i told it to look for drives but it couldn't find any.
at this point i'm freaking out, so i pull up device manager and see the unknown device, but it's also under disk drives, working properly.
i then plugged it into my xp desktop, works like a charm, shows up, works fine, read/write/copy, everything, so no problems with the drive.
i think i've cornered it to a driver problem in windows, and don't know what to do now.
anyone have an idea?
