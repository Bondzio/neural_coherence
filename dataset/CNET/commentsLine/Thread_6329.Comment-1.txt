i have been asked by our phone company to access the main telephone point to test a fax machine that does not seem to work from a regular point.
the trouble is that the main point is right beside the patch panel for the whole network and is already used, presumably to give internet access to the rest of the network.
in this scenario what would happen if i disconnected the phone point apart from cutting off the internet?
would the network reconnect if i plugged it back in after im done?
would there be issues with ip addresses?
are there other considerations?
thanks in advance
