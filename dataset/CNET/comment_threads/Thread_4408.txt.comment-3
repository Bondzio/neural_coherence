Thank you for your quick reply.
I am connecting for browser access.
It is going to my Raspberry Pi that I have running Raspbmc (XBMC).
I have tried using different ports because like you said they block access certain ports.
I wonder why I am able to connect within my network using my external IP though, that seems strange to me.
