I went to Canon's website and checked for new drivers and/or new firmware, and none is available. With my previous A-I-O's, I have not checked for new drivers or firmware and haven't had a problem until the HP A-I-O referenced in the above link. I am not clear as to when this needs to be checked. Is this something that needs to be done periodically or only when problems develop? Thank you.

I agree with your thinking, and that's why I leave things alone until I have reason to act to solve a problem. However, I thought maybe I wasn't doing something I 'should' be doing to prevent a problem. Thanks.
