i put the old data in a folder on my laptop.
i tried to transfer the old files to the new hard drive by copy/paste but i ran into issues because i received an error message that i didn't have &quot;permissions&quot; to make any changes.
so i created a folder called toshiba hd and dropped the old files in there.
i don't think i can use the old hard drive as back up storage (or at least i can't afford for a professional to attempt to fix it for me) or i'd just buy another hd caddy and make it a salve to the other because there is a second bay to install another hd on my laptop.
i'm basically just trying to get my old documents/settings, pics, and music back on my laptop.
shame on me for not back it up, it'll never happen again.
