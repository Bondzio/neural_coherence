digging around with a screw driver in an attempt to remove the covers is likely to void your warranty, if it still has one.
you may find that it is necessary to remove the screen from the lower half before you can work on it.
failing that, are there any little rubber cushion type things on the edges of the case lid.
if there are only two screws, i'll have to check my manual, the two halves will be held together with interlocking pieces around the edge.
what buttons are you trying to remove from the keyboard?
