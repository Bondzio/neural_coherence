1.2.1	If this burner has worked in this configuration before , you may have a hardware problem with the drive .	St
1.2.2	If it has not worked before then you may need PatchBurn 3.1 ( http : //www.patchburn.de/ ) or an update to Toast Titanium .	St
1.2.3	Current version of Toast is 6.1.1 What happens when you insert a blank disk into the 109 without launching Toast first ?	Ques
1.2.4	Unless you have not set a default action , the Finder should ask you what you want to do with this blank disk .	St
1.2.5	If the Finder is not recognizing blank Media , PatchBurn will solve that problem and then you can move on with further troubleshooting .	St
1.2.6	You might try repairing permissions too .	Sug
1.2.7	I know it does n't seem to be connected but strange things happen when they are not right .	St
