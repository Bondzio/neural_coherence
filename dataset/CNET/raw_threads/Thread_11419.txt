I am a writer and have accumulated a large number (into the thousands) of files over the years that are all very precious to me - songs, poems, parts of my novel - from a number of systems. Two laptops, and three PCs. Before I left for college last year, I wanted to combine all these files into one place. I bought a Western Digital 1 Terabyte MyBook. I put all of my pictures, music, and documents on there. It took up around 200 GB. However, now, most of the files are inaccessible. Some still are, but more than not are causing errors. When I try to open word documents I get the message: &quot;cannot start the converter mswrd632.&quot; Trying to move or copy documents to another drive: &quot;the directory or file cannot be created.&quot; Open a picture: &quot;a suitable graphics importer could not be found.&quot; What the heck?! Why does NOTHING open, copy, or transfer? These files are very important to me. I thought Western Digital would be a reliable brand - but this is driving me off the wall!

Except that one -&gt; &quot;the directory or file cannot be created.&quot; This one is common on drives that the top directory has become full. To get around this, remove some file or folder and create a new folder then put your stuff in folders in that folder. --&gt;&gt; But that's not why I write here. It appears you are repeating the BIG MISTAKE many make and that is to think this thing is STORAGE. It's not that reliable so keep a few spare copies on other media and locations of what you can't lose. Bob
