When I check for a firmware update I am told it is &quot;up to date&quot;.
The unit is also outside the warranty period.
I did purchase a NETGEAR WPNT834 RangeMax 4-Port Switch 240 Mbps MIMO 802.11g/b Wireless Router, since I found it for around $75 (which may have been an error).
I will see if that works any better, though having a spare is not a bad idea either.
