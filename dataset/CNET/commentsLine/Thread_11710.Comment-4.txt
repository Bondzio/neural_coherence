most people will have there own opinion of what is the best router so i will give you mine.
i have the netgear wndr 4500 router and couldn't ask for more from a router.
my garage is not attached and is about 65 feet from the router located in the house.
that would be thru 4 walls total.
i can take my ipad to the furthermost end of the garage and still have 3 bars and never skips a beat.
i have a smart tv, wireless blu-ray player, ipad, laptop, smartphone, wireless printer and two more laptops plus their smartphones when the grandkids are here and have never had any problems with connections.
