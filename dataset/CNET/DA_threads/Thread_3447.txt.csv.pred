1.1.1	Hello everyone and Happy New Year !	St
1.1.2	For the new year I thought I 'd build myself a new computer , but Ihave encountered some problems and I thought I 'd ask for some help .	St
1.1.3	System specs : Mobo : Asus P5W DH Deluxe Processor : Intel D850 Dual Core RAM : 512 Power Supply : Xilence Power 600W Hard Drive : Barracuda 7200 80 Gigs DVD ROM : Samsung writemaster Video Card : MSI NX7100GS I only installed the basic hardware just to get the system up and running .	St
1.1.4	The hard drive is an old drive that I had in another PC .	St
1.1.5	The PC boot up but stuck in the Bios screen and does not go past that .	St
1.1.6	It recognized the hard drive and DVD-ROM drive .	St
1.1.7	I have checked ASUS ' website it suggested to update the bios if the PC felt to boot .	St
1.1.8	As per ASUS 's & quot ; This problem can be resolved by updating BIOS to 0604 or later .	St
1.1.9	Please use a non-Core 2 processor to boot and perform this BIOS update. & quot ; My question is : Since I do n't have another processor to perform the upgrade , is there any other way of upgrading the BIOS ?	Ques
1.1.10	Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.1.11	Cheers and Happy New Year to everyone .	St

1.2.1	a cheap celeron CPU that will work in your MB and let you update the BIOS for the C2D processor .	St
1.2.2	What 's the Intel D850 ? ? ?	Ques
1.2.3	VPCMD	St
1.3.1	Sorry VAPCMD I meant to write Intel D805 not D850 .	St
1.3.2	I think the D805 is the least expensive Celeron processor out there .	St
1.3.3	So I 'm thinking it 's not possible to upgrade the bios via the DVD drive ... am I correct ?	Ques
1.4.1	versions for that MB and it 's not a Celeron .	St
1.4.2	http : //support.asus.com/cpusupport/cpusupport.aspx ? SLanguage=en-us & model=P5W % 20DH % 20Deluxe Did you plug the ATX12V in ( 4 pin square connector ) ?	Ques
1.4.3	Exactly what does it do when you turn it on ?	Ques
1.4.4	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	Yes the ATX12V cable is connected to the board .	St
1.5.2	It 's safe to say the processor and the motherboard should work together .	St
1.5.3	I have checked the link you provided and my bios version is Rev:1.03G higher than Rev : B0 version listed on the website http : //support.asus.com/cpusupport/cpusupport.aspx ? SLanguage=en-us & model=P5W % 20DH % 20Deluxe ..so I can safe say it 's not the bios that 's causing it not to work .	St
1.5.4	I 'm getting a one beep during the bootup process .	St
1.5.5	According to the User Guide manual , the possible errors could be : & quot ; keyboard controller error & quot ; , & quot ; Refresh time error & quot ; , or & quot ; No Master drive detected & quot ; .	St
1.5.6	1 .	St
1.5.7	The keyboard is working fine , because I 'm able to navigate within the Bios screen .	St
1.5.8	2 .	St
1.5.9	I do n't know what they mean by Refresh time error , so I have to look into that .	St
1.5.10	If you know what ii is , please tell me .	St
1.5.11	3 .	St
1.5.12	No Master drive detected - but I can see the drive description within the bios screen .	St
1.5.13	Any suggestions as to what I should do next ?	Ques
1.5.14	In the meantime I will try to find out any info on Refresh time error .	St
1.5.15	Thanks a million for your help ... looking forward to your reply .	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	VAPCMD , Thanks for your help .	St
