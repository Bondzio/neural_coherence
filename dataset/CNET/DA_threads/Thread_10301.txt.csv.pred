1.1.1	I work in a school with the internet connection distributed to every room through ethernet ports on which every computer must plug itself to .	St
1.1.2	What is the cheapest/best wireless adaptor I can get that will just require being plugged into the ethernet port ?	Ques
1.1.3	I want to use my laptop anywhere within the range of my classroom .	St
1.2.1	You need to get permission from the network administrator to ''plug in '' a Wireless Access Point ( WAP ) .	St
1.2.2	Once you have a WAP ( with the security settings your network administrator recommends ) , any computer that is to make a wireless connection to the WAP will need a Wireless Network Adapter .	St
1.2.3	The Wireless Network Adapter needs to be compatible with the WAP 's broadcast standard ( wireless-g , wireless-b , wireless-a ) .	St
1.2.4	Cheapest WAPs are often Wireless Routers that can be configured to function as a WAP .	St
1.3.1	It can be difficult to find a WAP that is simply plug-n-play because the existing network setup might not match the default WAP settings .	St
1.3.2	I have used small wireless routers as WAPs for classrom and hotel use .	St
1.3.3	They are usually called travel routers or compact routers .	St
1.3.4	You plug it in , configure it once , and pop it into your notebook travel bag when you are finished .	St
1.3.5	I have had success with the following compact/travel models : Linksys WRT54GC Linksys WTR54G Netgear WGR101 I usually travel with Linksys WRT54GC because it has a lot of functions and extra ports if needed .	St
1.4.1	You could cause a lot of problems on your school networks that would upset any network admin .	St
1.4.2	Believe me , it 's easy to track too .	St
1.4.3	But , if you got permission to do this , the setup is simple .	St
1.4.4	Purchase ACCESS POINT and hook it into the port in the wall .	St
1.4.5	Broadcast your signal and voila !	St
1.4.6	Most of the time , this will not work because the Access Point needs to be registered on the network that is running on .	St
1.4.7	Chances are you will be able to connect to the network , but internet might not be allowed .	St
1.4.8	( Depends on the schools network . )	St
