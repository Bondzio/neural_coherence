i recently got a new computer (moving up from me to xp).
on the old computer i had some applications that loaded up fine.
yet, on the xp computer i get an error banner that says, &quot;16 bit windows subsystem&quot; the body of the error window says, &quot;c:\windows\system32\autoexec.nt.
the system file is not suitable for running ms-dos and microsoft windows applications.
choose 'close' to terminate the application.&quot; at the bottom are two buttons - close and ignore (nothing happens with ignore).
both of these programs worked fine in the earlier version.
i tried the &quot;compatibility&quot; function with no luck.
i tried loading it without the xp 2 patch, and again after.
these are simple apps that use a setup program.
i'm out of ideas...anybody else?
