1.1.1	Greetings from scandinavia .	St
1.1.2	I just bought an i7 950 with the Extreme6 MB , I choose to pick my tri-channel RAM-blocks among the few DDR3 on the market operating at 1.5volts .	St
1.1.3	Read that the memory-controller in the i7 chip can get damaged by higher voltages !	St
1.1.4	RAM-Specs : Kingston ValueRAM 3 x 2 GB - Product code : KVR1066D3N7K3/6G 1066 MHz , PC3-8500 - 7-7-7-20 On-Die Termination ( ODT ) / Intel Extreme Memory Profiles ( XMP ) AS-Rock 's MB-support page does NOT have these modules on the Compatibility list ! !	St
1.1.5	Now Im afraid these Kingston RAM will cause a problem , this is my first rig-build !	St
1.1.6	Help me figure out whether I should send the RAM back	St
1.2.1	Have you tried the RAM ?	Ques
1.2.2	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	No , I havent tried it yet , it has put my building on hold	St
1.4.1	If so , read : http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/front-panel-usb-3-connector,2755-7.html I see the BIOS goes to well over 2.0 Volts so where did you read that 1.5V would be damaging to the system ?	Ques
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	Well , I read it in some articles , here are the ones i have the adress on : http : //www.legitreviews.com/article/806/1/ http : //www.anandtech.com/show/2636 -The source to my consearns is actually from the supportpage on the X58 Extreme6 , the modules arent in the supported list ! !	St
1.5.2	How important is it to follow these guidances ? ?	Ques
1.5.3	I have wrote to AsRock , and am in the process of contacting Kingston .	St
1.5.4	Just thought , maybe someone knew how 'hard ' one should follow that DDR-compatibility list .	St
1.5.5	( Thanks for answering guys ) DC	St
1.6.1	The articles said something about that core i7 's integrated memory-controller could get damaged beyond repair by memory-modules operating ABOVE 1.5V .	St
1.6.2	Almost all of the DDR3 triple-channel operate at 1.65V , but then I found these .	St
1.6.3	Havent had the time to try to figure out , whether there IS a problem , or whether those sites ( articles ) are just AMD-freaks bashing superior enemy architecture	St
1.7.1	Just re-read those articles , and it seems I got it wrong : Its apparently only a problem when going BEYOND 1.5-1.65V -So Im going to return those Kingston , cause they are too slow !	St
1.7.2	BUT : Does anyone know how much one should follow that DDR3-compatibility list for supported modules ? ?	Ques
1.7.3	?	Ques
1.8.1	The chipset voltage and the memory voltage are on different supplies .	St
1.8.2	I supplied the link to the Tom 's Hardware so you could see that in the screen shot .	St
1.8.3	I do n't see the problem .	St
1.8.4	But that does n't mean people wo n't fret over this .	St
1.8.5	Bob	St
