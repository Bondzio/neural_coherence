12748	0	136110	1532991	NR	baseballmonkey	11/12/05 7:48 AM	1.13178168E12	Upgrades to my old Dell	I have an old Dell desktop (XPS T500, Pentium 3 500MHz, 384 memory) that I would like to do some video work with (edit family vacation videos, etc). My system came with a DVD player (not a burner), and I have added a CD burner to an available bay. I wanted to get one of the newer dual layer lightscribe burners, like the one from HP, but it appears that the system requirements call for a minimum of 800 MHz processor. Will it still work, albeit a little slower than desired, or will it not work at all? I am running Windows XP on the system if that is an issue...any suggestions?

I think it should work, but it might lock up, very slow, etc. It may, but would be slower than you'd like. You could try it, and if its too slow you could return it.

Yes, you can edit video it may take overnight to do the rendering. Burning a DVDs, well the only this you can do is try. john
