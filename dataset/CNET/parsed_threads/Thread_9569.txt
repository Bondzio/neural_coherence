<s> Hi; Got a friend's laptop that's 3-4 years old with Win 7. </s>
<s> First the keyboard stopped working. </s>
<s> Then apparently weird things started happening to it (I asked, suspecting the MB). </s>
<s> Then it now won't boot. </s>
<s> It tries, but doesn't succeed. </s>
<s> Cannot boot in safety mode either. </s>
<s> Reads the USB ports but cannot boot a bootable thumb drive. </s>
<s> Cannot boot from DVD either. </s>
<s> Changed the BIOS to accommodate those before the HD. </s>
<s> Pulled the HD and still can't boot from other media. </s>
<s> In a remote area of India (a jungle), hard to get to town to buy stuff, test, etc. </s>
<s> But from what I know of computers, sure sounds like the MB to me. </s>
<s> Your thoughts or ideas? </s>
<s> TIA, John </s>
<s> Dollars to donuts that it's heat related. </s>
<s> Heat has probably weakened some part on it. </s>
<s> Keyboard may just have dirt or crumbs in it, give it a good upside down shaking, or vacuum it, or none of that exist there, use a straw and blow. </s>
<s> When it fails to boot does it power off, or just freeze while fan on cpu continues to blow? </s>
<s> If you replace the laptop, get something low power that can take a hot climate. </s>
<s> India's a very big place. </s>
<s> I live in the foothills of the Himalayas. </s>
<s> It's not hot here...nor is it cold...nor is it humid. </s>
<s> I come from the Caribbean and that was hotter and more humid and I haven't seen a problem like this before. </s>
<s> No, it doesn't freeze up nor power down. </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> Just what laptop model# is this and how are you powering it or recharging? </s>
<s> Next, be prepared for a teardown, since being in a remote location you may have some issue if this isn't a &quot;robust laptop&quot; like in it can take it. </s>
<s> Typical laptops can only take so much and don't be surprised that it maybe insect related(maybe). </s>
<s> A teardown gives a close inspection of the innards and checks to see if any dust build-up is truly removed. </s>
<s> Stopped or broken fans are common as well as dust build-up even if blown-out some dust clods may migrate deep into the cooling setup to include any vents. </s>
<s> 3-4yrs. </s>
<s> is plenty of time for all this to happen and let's not forget the battery if this is the original, replace or have at least direct AC hook-up and good power too. </s>
<s> AND yes, having a good battery even during AC hook-up makes a difference. </s>
<s> Try a &quot;live version&quot; of a bootable Linux disc, like Ubuntu, burnt properly it should be bootable. </s>
<s> Alas, the DVD drive must be a good one to boot at all. </s>
<s> test the bootable disc, elsewhere. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Also, there are so many optical drive failures in old laptops like this that I always find myself demoing how a good drive works. </s>
<s> However, did you try a bootable USB memory stick? </s>
<s> I won't detail how since such is all over the internet. </s>
<s> Why I note this is that I have helped a few get onto some Linux on USB and get some use out of their otherwise useless broken hardware. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So I tore it down again just to double-check the dust. </s>
<s> Very little dust for such an old machine, no bugs. </s>
<s> Fan worked fine. </s>
<s> I hadn't tested that before because I didn't want to run it without the back cover, but when I did, she booted just fine! </s>
<s> Had to go back to a previous rebuild or whatever, but she worked. </s>
<s> Then I shut her down, put the back cover on and tried again, no problemo. </s>
<s> But why? </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> And tear down, build it again can get a contact to make contact and it works. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I specificity asked for details. </s>
<s> WHY? </s>
<s> because some models are prone to problems or early failure. </s>
<s> You may have such a laptop and the problems will continue even though now it works. </s>
<s> Just keep that in mind, since you really don't know why it works now. </s>
<s> It's all a guessing game until you find the real cause of problem(s). </s>
<s> Regardless, a 3-4yr. </s>
<s> old laptop should have some issues because after 18mos. </s>
<s> the battery alone should be replaced, because in SOME models heat build-up due to constant recharging and/or less than sustained levels aren't always precise and cause that charging ckt. </s>
<s> to breakdown or cause weird results to include battery as well. </s>
<s> If the battery had been replaced some time back, was it from a good source, rebuilds aren't always reliable or trusted. </s>
<s> As for operation of laptop now working don't exclude &quot;corrosion&quot; or minor contact areas. </s>
<s> These can be easily reconnected by simply reseating and breaking to new contact surfaces(micro-scratches) to make good contact, however this doesn't exclude bad wire harness or seating. </s>
<s> Makes ure on harness, they're &quot;locked-in&quot; even though it may appear so. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Good advice! </s>
<s> John </s>
