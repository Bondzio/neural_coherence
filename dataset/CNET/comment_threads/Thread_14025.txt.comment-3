This desktop has a Gigabyte GA-7N400 Pro 2 motherboard with an AMD Athlon XP 2600 processor running Win XP Pro (upgraded to SP2) in an Enlight case with an Enlight 350 watt power supply.
The video card is an ATI All-in Wonder 9600 Pro.
The system is exactly 3 years old.
I described the symptoms as best I could.
What other information do you need?
Thanks.
