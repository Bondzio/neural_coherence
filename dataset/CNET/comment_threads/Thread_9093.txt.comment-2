&quot;I've had a look around various web sites but can't find anything that answers this question.&quot; The question is a little unclear to me.
Maybe you want some controller that will &quot;just work&quot; without all the hoopla of drivers and more.
The short answer is that there was no standard in the basic design for this so you step off into drivers and more.
You also may have skipped the usual suspect of Promise Technology which has the cards, and you can read the manuals.
Here's their web site http://www.promise.com http://www.promise.com/support/file/manual/FT66_Manual_En.pdf for example is a manual for one of the products.
As you can tell, you can't put CDROM type devices on it.
But that's not a big deal since the hard disks (4) can go on the Promise and the CDROM (4) units can be on your motherboard.
When allocating Watts for each drive, use about 30 Watts per drive.
