do a serarch on google if necessary.
you should be be able to run 98 over it (just boot from cd) i was on 98 se and i recomend you upgrade at least to 2000 pro.
that i loaded over 98se.
that way all your files will remain in tact.
alternatively burn all your files to cd (if u can get in) or load them on to a usb memory stick.
sorry i cannot help any more.
