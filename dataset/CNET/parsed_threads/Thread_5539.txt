<s> I have recently finished clearing a friend's computer of literally thousands of viruses, trojans and assorted malware items. </s>
<s> Everything now seems OK, except for the &quot;Safely Remove Hardware&quot; icon ever present with occasional popups advising to connect the device to a USB2.0 port for better results. </s>
<s> What device? </s>
<s> There are none connected...even using PS/2 keyboard and mouse. </s>
<s> All USB ports are OK, except one in the pre-installed 9 in 1 card reader. </s>
<s> Suspecting the icon problem could be caused by the card reader, I uninstalled then disconnected it. </s>
<s> On reboot, the icon had gone. </s>
<s> I then reconnected the reader and the icon reappeared. </s>
<s> All other components of the reader appear in My Computer as removable storage devices and seem to be working OK. All except the USB port. </s>
<s> The ever-present icon makes me think there could be a hardware prob in the reader, affecting only the USB port. </s>
<s> Any thoughts would be very much appreciated. </s>
<s> System is HP Pavilion a1525a, running Windows XP Media Center Edition and all peripherals were preinstalled and are exactly as per system specs. </s>
<s> I did update a couple of drivers which did not alter the situation. </s>
<s> Device Manager shows no drivers are needed. </s>
<s> This is cosmetic at this point. </s>
<s> Focus on real issues. </s>
<s> Does the PC have an internal card reader installed? </s>
<s> If it has, then this icon will always be shown, this is normal. </s>
<s> If there is anything connected to the motherboard USB ports like card readers, then the 'Safely Remove USB' icon will be there. </s>
<s> Don't worry about it. </s>
<s> Your Card reader maybe a USB hub and will keep the icon on. </s>
<s> If You have a SATA hard drive. </s>
<s> The Windows OS reads SATA drives as a USB drive. </s>
<s> I have two SATA drives and I had the same thing you are having. </s>
<s> Right click on the icon and a popup window will tell you what is keeping the icon on. </s>
<s> In your post &quot; I uninstalled then disconncted it (card reader). </s>
<s> On reboot the icon had gone. </s>
<s> Reconnected the reader and icon reappeared.&quot; I think your reader is a USB hub. </s>
<s> The Safely Remove Hardware icon is in my tray as well which serves as a safeguard re uploading photos to your computer. </s>
<s> When your uploads have finished, click on the Safely Remove Hardware BEFORE removing your USB connection device and wait for a popup to inform you it is safe to remove the device. </s>
<s> In other words, it is an extra precaution well worth the little space it uses in your tray. </s>
<s> Thanks guys...problem solved. </s>
<s> Inserted a new 9 in 1 reader. </s>
<s> USB port works fine, no permanent icon in system tray and no frequent reminders about &quot;this device can operate faster, etc, etc...&quot; </s>
