where are you looking to find the external drive.
in my computer.
try looking in computer management/disk management.
you may see it as unallocated space.
also, you may want to try a free utility call minitool partition wizard home edition.
it can rebuild partition tables if that is the case, rebuild mbr and format.
as its not a windows program, its possible it may see the drive and you can then perfrom your actions from there.
did the external drive come with a software/driver file on it or a cd installation media.
try installing th manufacturer driver/software and see if windows will now recognize it.
if there's no install media, search the internet (manufacturers site) for drivers or software.
i had this problem a while back.
i did everything i could (luckily i have 5 backups, so i didn't lose data, just a hdd image) but i checked computer management/disk management, but it couldn't be read.
so i used partition wizard (see above) it recognize the drive, what partitions there should be and the sizes each part should be.
so all i could do was format it.
using partition wizard though as windows couldn't even see unallocated space.
now it works.
the point is, you may have to format first, recover later.
otherwise, you may get no drive ever.
i know someone who tried to recover data from unallocated space/uninitialized disk.
it ****** up his drive, (don't ask me how).
so think out a plan first and then decide.
maybe talk to an it advisor.
ut don't rush into it.
do what yasinghmd suggested first (recovery and different cables, enclosures e.t.c.)
but before you throw away the drive, try my solutions.
also, it maybe the usb ports on th computer, try a pci usb2.0 card and plug it into that and try it.
