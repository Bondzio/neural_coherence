<s> I'm fairly new at setting up networks and could use some advice with this setup. </s>
<s> I've accomplished a wireless setup on 5 machines, but that's about the extent of my hands on experience. </s>
<s> I would like to network three machines for file sharing. </s>
<s> They all access the same T-1 line. </s>
<s> 2 machines running windows 98se. </s>
<s> 1 machine running XP Home. </s>
<s> I would like for the xp machine to be the host. </s>
<s> I've read about different methods for setting this up. </s>
<s> Frankly, it's a little confusing to a novice. </s>
<s> I would like to hear from those of you who have experience with T-1 line network setup. </s>
<s> Also, what, if any, hardware is needed? </s>
<s> (router, switch, etc.) </s>
<s> Thanks for any suggestions. </s>

<s> Since I've gotten no response to this post, I thought I would answer my own questions. </s>
<s> I set up the network using the netbuie protocol with printer & file sharing. </s>
<s> The xp machine required a different configuration and the extracting of some files from the xp cd, but it all came together and works great. </s>
<s> I've got two computers running on wireless g that can share a printer and two that are on wireless b cards that cannot share the same printer. </s>
<s> Do all the computers need to be on wireless g to share the printer? </s>
<s> I wireless b capable of printer sharing? </s>
<s> Thought you might be able to help. </s>
<s> Make sure all the PCs are identified with the same Workgroup name. </s>
<s> If the printer is connected to a PC (versus a print server port on the router/switch), you may need to be sure that each user has an account to which the printer is connected. </s>
<s> I used to have a router/switch with a printer port on it which meant any PC on the network could print to it at any time. </s>
<s> I replaced the printer and my new one only connects by USB to the PC. </s>
<s> I had to replace the R/S, and now the main PC has to be on for the others to be able to print. </s>
