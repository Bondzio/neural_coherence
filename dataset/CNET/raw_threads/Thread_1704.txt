Needless to say it's a bit low on the gaming scale. So I was looking to upgrade to say an ATI 1900 xtx, or Similar. I was wondering if any one with a RC210G has upgraded there graphics card and to what, ATI, Nvidia? Also how well it works for you?

Judging from reviews such as : http://www.gcn.com/print/25_17/41142-1.html sony uses a massive amount power, and like all things with a big name badge, it likely doesn't come with an over specified PSU . In other words, it already uses a lot of power, and the PSU it comes with will not be an expensive model with a massive overhead for a huge 3D upgrade. Huge? The graphics card you're after requires more power than any other option which is likely to be doomed to failure in a ynos PC: http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/geforce7900gtx_6.html You'd only be compounding possible problems, and you might have to consider a PSU upgrade, which may or may not (the latter is more likely) be an option. Or you could opt for a graphics card which doesn't draw so much power. No doubt with a trendy ynos, something as horrible (even though it works) as this would be out of the question too : http://www.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=6221 Good luck in your endeavours though, GB.
