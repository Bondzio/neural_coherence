What temp gauges does your PC have?
Only a case temp?
Or does it show the CPU temp, NB temp etc?
If your temp gauges don't show a difference, then, well, it doesn't really matter... As far as a search for a desktop case - try a search for a HTPC (home theater PC) case, that'll get you a few more options.
