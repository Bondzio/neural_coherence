<s> I will be gone all summer in DC, so what is the best thing to do with the UPS for 10 weeks? </s>
<s> Is it best to just leave it plugged in, should I just unplug from the wall, or should I unplug the battery as well? </s>
<s> It is one of the conventional lead-acid ones from APC in case in matters. </s>
<s> Lead acid batteries do not fare well under full discharge. </s>
<s> While a proper circuit design would prevent this and remove the need to disconnect the battery lead (only need to do one!) </s>
<s> you can hedge your bets by unplugging the unit and removing one battery lead. </s>

<s> Is that because all that's needed is &quot;breaking&quot; the circuit or something along those lines? </s>
<s> I ran into a fellow that insisted both leads must be removed to disconnect the battery. </s>
<s> Who am I to disagree? </s>
<s> Unplug UPS from AC outlet. </s>
<s> Remove neg. </s>
<s> (-) lead from battery. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> Because if any possible outside electrical input would come from the grd. </s>
<s> side, thus neg.. You can further coat the +/- wires with Vaseline or dielectric grease if so desired to prevent corrosion. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I'll ask how old the battery is. </s>
<s> If it's relatively new, I'd remove it from the device and store it in a cool and dry environment. </s>
<s> If it's and oldie (3 or more years), I'd do the same but consider having a replacement handy. </s>
<s> Lead acid batteries tend to develop a metallic sulfate coating over time and especially when allowed to discharge. </s>
<s> These sealed types will also develop bulges. </s>
<s> If you notice such happening, it's time to replace it anyway. </s>
