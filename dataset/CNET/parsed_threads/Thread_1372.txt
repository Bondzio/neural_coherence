<s> Ordered a Desk top from Dell (dimension E310) and would like to upgrade the video card (to play battlefield 2). </s>
<s> Does anyone know how I would find out what type of card I need or how to find out what type this PC needs? </s>
<s> AGP or PCI? </s>
<s> Short of opening the back and looking inside. </s>
<s> The game requires as a minimum a NVIDIA GeForce FX 5700 or ATI Radeon 8500 or greater. </s>
<s> My PC more than meets all the minimum requirements for the game, but not the video card </s>
<s> You're SOL because all PCI graphis cards suck. </s>
<s> Send the PC back and build your own. </s>
<s> The E310 is an entry level type PC. </s>
<s> Definitely not a gamer. </s>
<s> Too little amount of RAM (only 512MB....XP needs that much, the integrated video is 128 SHARED memory), a midrange speed CPU and &quot;NO&quot; AGP or PCI Express 16x slot for a better graphics card. </s>
<s> You'll have to find a PCI or an even more rare PCIe 1x graphics card for the system. </s>
<s> You are restricted to the integrated ( Intel GMA 950 graphics of the 915G chipset) to the chip on the mobo. </s>
<s> See the reviews: http://reviews.cnet.com/Dell_Dimension_E310/4505-3118_7-31594474-2.html?tag=nav http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1918112,00.asp http://compreviews.about.com/od/budgetdesk/gr/DimensionE310.htm http://products.consumerguide.com/reviews/product.epub?productId=30211#FullReview The only thing I see to help your system (inexpensively) very much would be to upgrade to at least 1G of RAM........sorry.................... </s>
<s> HIS Radeon X1300 512MB HyperMemory It's not a very good card, though. </s>
<s> Like I said before, you're better off sending the computer back to Dell and building your own. </s>
<s> The game calls for a ATI Radeon 8500 or greater. </s>
<s> Is the Radeon X1300 512MB HyperMemory a &quot;greater&quot; card? </s>
<s> Not up to speed on the video cards. </s>
<s> ...you still won't be able to play at a high resolution with all the details turned on. </s>
<s> Your best bet is to send the PC back and get one with a PCIe x16 slot, or build your own. </s>
<s> I would recomend AGP or PCI-E but I have been hearing that your computer does not support AGP or PCI-E. </s>
<s> I would say then to get the newest PCI card from either ATI or Nvidia or get an AGP card turned to PCI. </s>
