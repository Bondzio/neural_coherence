i have a feeling it's either cpu or mobo related because of this... i built the system a year ago, all brand new gear.
i swapped out my amd 64 3800 for a 3700 cos my brother's mobo wouldn't accept the 3700. i used heatsink paste when installing cpu.
machine worked fine until about 6-8 weeks ago when cmos began acting up.
seems the new battery has cured that.
last week i installed a geforce 9800gt gr.
card so i could start gaming again, i hadn't played a game for ages cos of lack of gr.
power, i used onboard gr.
before the geforce.
games i used to play on lower spec machines are choppy and the freeze occurs.
so i've got a new heatsink and am waiting for a new 3800 to arrive.
if problems still persist then it seems a new mobo is in order.
