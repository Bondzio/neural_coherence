i think the best way to backup data right now would be with a dvd burner(they have the double layer version now too).
blank dvd's are cheap stuff nowadays(a dollar maybe), and a burner can be had for under 100$ i've heard of lacie, but i haven't heard alot about them.
i would imagine that lacie doesn't manufacture their own harddrives, since i noticed that they make all kinds of things including monitors.
odds are there is a seagate on hitachi drive in there.
for those of you that didn't know, the crt tubes used in regular tube monitors are only made from 4 or so companies.
so it isn't really a stretch that lacie doesn't make anything entirely &quot;from scratch.&quot; as far as if lacie has a seagate drive, someone else mentioned seagate being a good brand in this thread but i'm not so sure.
i remember them being the absolute cheapest drive you could get a few years back.
during that time i worked in a computer company that did build to order systems for businesses.
they really didn't like seagate, because they had complaints about them failing from their customers.
but i have nothing against seagate, i would probably buy one.
i would find it hard to believe that a company would make products exactly the same for years.
i mean their engineers have to retire/get fired sometime right?
lol and anyhow, i would rather check the overall sales a drive to compare against any complaints.
