My wife loved it so much, well, she took it from me. I then purchased the ME301 in place of another Nexus and prefer the ME301 for a few reasons. The Number 1 reason was it's memory expansion capabilities, the second reason was the rear camera. Crazy as it sounds, you don't expect to take pictures with a tablet, but it's a good feature to have when the need arises. I will admit, I like the comfort of the Nexus 7 better, however the new ME301, is pretty comfortable for it's size. Last comment, I use the device for personal and business. The ME301 is a better choice when sharing information with friends and or customers. Oh wait, one more note- both these purchases were my first (I mean second) Asus purchase - and I am really impressed with the power and capabilities they packed in a low cost device (s). Hope this helps you make a decision.
