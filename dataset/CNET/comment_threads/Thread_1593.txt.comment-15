I didnt have a problem with ABS machines.
I got an ABS from 2000 and never had any problems with it.
It even came with a 20 ich CRT which works to this day, but I replaced it with a 19 inch LCD.
The system had a P3, and worked fine until a coupke of months ago when I got broadband, and the whole system was infected with spyware.
That was my fault for not having anything to protect it.
The system works great, but I replaced it because I needed a more current computer.
I even have 2 removable hard drives on it.
I find ABS to be great PC builders.
