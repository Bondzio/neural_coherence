<s> I recently had a new hard drive added to my computer. </s>
<s> The old drive was left in as a slave drive, and a new installation of Windows XP Home SP2 was installed on the new drive. </s>
<s> The first thing I did when I got my machine home was to make sure windows was totally updated. </s>
<s> Since then, none of my USB devices will work. </s>
<s> When I plug any of them in, the computer will make the usual &quot;bling-blong&quot; sound, but nothing else happens. </s>
<s> It makes the usual &quot;blong-bling&quot; sound when I remove a device. </s>
<s> I am currently using (well, attempting to use) a Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse 2.0, a Brother MFC 5440CN, and a TV tuner device. </s>
<s> None of them work at all. </s>
<s> I tried to go into the Device Manager and update the drivers on the USB controllers, but Windows was unable to find an updated driver. </s>
<s> So, I uninstalled the devices and re-booted the machine. </s>
<s> I then went into the Device Manager and updated the drivers on the &quot;Unknown Devices&quot; that were there. </s>
<s> This worked and Windows successfully installed drivers for all six entries in the device manager. </s>
<s> However, after rebooting, I am still having exactly the same problem. </s>
<s> There was no change at all. </s>
<s> All of the drivers for the hardware are up-to-date and have been installed, uninstalled, and reinstalled. </s>
<s> I am running out of options! </s>
<s> Does anyone have any advice? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help! </s>
<s> =) I have a P4 2.5G 750MB 160GB with Windows XP Home SP2. </s>
<s> Microsoft doesn't install drivers for all this plus... there may be some motherboard driver package that needs installing. </s>
<s> Try to remember how you installed Windows last time. </s>

<s> You probably need to install the mobo/chipset specific drivers. </s>
<s> Visit your mobo mfg's website or your chipset mfg website and you should be in business. </s>
