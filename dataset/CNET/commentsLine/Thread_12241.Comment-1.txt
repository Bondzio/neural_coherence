workstation= intel d845gbvl / 2.6 p4 / xppro / 1gb ram-(pc2700) maxtor udma6(?)
hd, updated nvidia drivers, etc.
performs video / gamer wise just like a 1.8 we also have.
pcpitstop benchmark says the video is performing at 52% of the same card/cpu/memory on other systems.
checked direct x ( 9b).
system runs ok, but checking video after processing seems very ordinary.
what steps might i check-redo-etc to get to normal levels?
