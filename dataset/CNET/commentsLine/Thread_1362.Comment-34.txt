up until about a week ago, i never actually knew hard drives failed all that often.
i've had the same hard drive in my older computer since it was brand new.. 8 years ago!!
it has some older ibm branded hard drive.
i know i didn't do anything special to keep it working, cuz i had to open the case for the first time about 2 years after it was new, and found all the fuzz and lint from my new carpet covering everything inside, like a sweater.
i opened it cuz i noticed the fan didn't sound right anymore.
but either way, its still working perfectly fine after 8 years.. my newer computer's hd just failed, its only about 4 yrs old, and it has a samsung spinpoint hd, the recovery portion of the hd was damaged i guess.
idk.
i'm switching from pata to sata tomorrow, stupid hp didn't tell me they were sending sata as a replacement, and now i have to go buy the cable.. arg.. atleast the motherboard and power supply support sata2.
i would say don't move it around too much... my computers basically just sit on the floor next to my desk, and i've always got it on, 24/7, never sleeps or anything, generally with windows and games still running, just paused.
don't tinker, they're fragile and apparently they can break easily, which i never knew, lol
