i have had two compaq laptops purchased from costco.
one is now 8 years old and has been to collage with two kids.
the other is 3 years old and like the one before never gave us a single problem.
we also have two dell laptops and one dell desk top.
one of the dell laptops had to have the keyboard replaced.
(bummer is had to mail it in to get it done) the rest of the dells have been trouble free.
the only reason i would choose the compaq over the dell is they seem to be higher quality for about the same price.
