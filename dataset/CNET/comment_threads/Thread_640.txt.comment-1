I want to use my new pc to record tv shows, burn cd's and dvd's, digital photography and eventually video.
I'm seriuously considering buying this package (17'' LCD, Canon printer)which doesn't have a TV tuner/remote for $999: GTW 835GM Pentium D processor 820 Dual-core processing 1024MB of DDR2 RAM 250GB 7200RPM hard drive Dual DVD drives Windows XP Media Center or for $1229 I could get this one (same bundle) with the TV tuner/remote: Gateway - 830 Media Center Desktop 840GM Intel Pentium D processor 830; DL DVDRW/CD-RW and DVD-ROM drives; 250GB hard drive; 1GB PC4200 DDR2 memory; Windows XP Media Center 2005; TV tuner; 8-in-1 media manager My question is would it be cheaper and easy enough for an intermediate pc user like myself to buy and install a tv tuner card?
Are the USB tuners an easier option?
What about the remote?
Can I buy that too?
I realize the processor is slightly faster but I doubt I would notice the difference.
