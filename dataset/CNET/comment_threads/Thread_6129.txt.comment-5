Your recovery/restore CD should have the files you need.
Depending the nature of that CD you *may* directly select the drivers for the CD drive in question.
You thus re-install that way or if you know the product find the driver directly from the Sony support website or the CD drive maker support website, get related driver.
Yeah, you could have made an error in wiping out some files that supported that CD drive, but at least it should have reported being present though not active.
Check, the h/w device manager and see what it states about that drive, there too can re-install drivers needed at that time.
As for the bios, you manual should give a clear method to access or upon boot-up any key sequence to eneter the bios.
I suggest for now hitting eiother F1 or F2 key if so stated, otherwise find what your manual states.
This info should also be repeated at the Sony support website as well.
