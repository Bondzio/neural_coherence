I encountered the same problem and here is what I did to resolve it: Select the files/folders you want to share on your network, right click the folder and select &quot;Sharing and Security.&quot; Then click on the &quot;Sharing&quot; tab and click the option for &quot;Share this folder on the network.&quot; I also selected the option for &quot;Allow network users to change my files&quot; only because I work between my notebook and desktop.
Once that's complete, click &quot;apply.&quot; If you've done this correctly, you will see a hand supporting the folder which indicates you've successfully shared the folder.
Repeat this process for both computers.
