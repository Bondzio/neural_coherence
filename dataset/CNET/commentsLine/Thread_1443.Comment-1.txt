hi, a couple of months ago i brought a game (pro evolution soccer 2008).
long story short i had to physicaly lower the ram of my pc as the game refused to run on the higher settings (thanks for that konami).
i followed instructions from a pes forum and changed from 4 gig to 3 gig recognized.
now i want to put my pc back to its full operation capacity (game got boring, wanna hurt crysis now) but i can't remember how to change the memory back!
looked on the forums but the thread i used has gone, could someone please help!!!!
so i have 4 gig of ram, vista is only recognizing 3 gig, i wanna change it back to 4gig.
my system.... vista 64 e6600 cpu 4gig (pyshical memory sticks) 700 gig hd 8800gtx thanks in advance, i'm guessing it's really simple.
