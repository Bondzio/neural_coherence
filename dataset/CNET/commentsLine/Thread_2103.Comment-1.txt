i really appreciate all the useful information in the recent discussion about external usb hard-drives.
i have several and while i never rely on just one copy of my stuff anywhere, i do like the convinience of using these devices.
i am curious though, about the differences, if any worth mentioning, of using one of those cheap &quot;enclosures&quot; that accept an internal 2-1/2 or 3-1/2 inch drive.
i have already had one that wasn't cheap just die on me.
so, i picked up a real cheap plastic dock that allows you to just slide the hd in a slot on the top.
really handy for quick changes and testing.
i dropped in the hd that i had in the external enclosure that failed and was able to read and copy from it instantly.
i have to wonder whether there is a known problem with these kinds of devices and if i should phase them out of use in my multi-drive back-up ritual.
they seem like they do the same thing but after having a good one just quit, i am a little leary.
