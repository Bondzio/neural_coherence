6673	0	20814	224259	NR	jacf	4/24/04 4:32 PM	1.08282432E12	Raid and IDE	I am creating a new system with a Chaintech 478 board 3.06 cpu, it has 2 Promise raid slots on it, I am not planning to use 2 drives, But can I hook up a single drive to one, or wll I need to install a PCI card (which I have) to run it. I have all the other ide's used up with the main drive and zip cd dvd&lt; I wish to hook up my old drive from this system, to download the programs and files I want to keep. The paperwork doesnot say if you can hook up a cd or zip? J Fretwell jacf@jacf.com

If you can add a single drive, you will find a change in the BIOS necessary. I have an ASUS board with a RAID controller that works either way but, again, no ATAPIs allowed.
