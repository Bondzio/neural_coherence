<s> I have a 2.5&quot; SATA hard drive that just came out of my previous PC laptop. </s>
<s> I have data in there that I wish I could use in my new home computer. </s>
<s> I was hoping I can place it inside the computer, but I'm wondering if it is possible to just plug in the hard drive directly into it? </s>
<s> If not, is there an alternative to using this hard drive inside my PC? </s>
<s> Physical mounting issues aside, the connections for sata 2.5 inch drives are the same as desktop sata drives. </s>
<s> Consider an external USB case if you don't want to deal with the desktop internals such as http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=KM-EN251SV&cat=HDD or http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=EN391&cat=HDD Bob </s>
<s> this external drive dock will allow you add the SATA drive to practically any PC. </s>

<s> I think this is what you will need to mount it on your desktop: http://www.icydock.com/product_pagein.html I don't think you can mount a 2.5&quot; hard drive on a desktop unless you want to leave it on top of something. </s>
<s> This will allow you to mount it on your computer so it is stable and won't fall off. </s>
<s> It follows the standard hard drive format design so it should allow you to mount it on your case. </s>
<s> The other way is to get an enclosure that fits your hard drive. </s>
<s> ICY DOCK has other enclosures that might suit your need. </s>
<s> You might want to check their website. </s>
<s> Oh, i'm sorry about that... </s>
<s> I have a old cooler master case (mid-tower) from 2003. </s>
<s> I'm not sure about the brand. </s>
<s> I'm using an ASUS P4WD2 motherboard with Pentium D 2.6 Ghz and 1 GB RAM. </s>
<s> Thanks for all your help guys!! </s>

<s> Simple, you just gotta get this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812200176 </s>
