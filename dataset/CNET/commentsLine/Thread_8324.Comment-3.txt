aside the fact that 280mhz (ddr 560) is just sick if it ran, no athlonxp will break 250...and for 250 you need cooling that costs in the $300-$1300+ range (that is in usd) but post week 39 athlonxp's are super locked, which means you can only oc with the fsb (week 39 of 2003, the exception is the athlonxp-m) so yea, he could've oc'ed his chip just reset the cmos as 280 is out of belief high for that chip just reset the cmos if your multipler is something like 10 or 10.5 set the fsb to 200 if the multi is like 13-14, set the fsb to 166
