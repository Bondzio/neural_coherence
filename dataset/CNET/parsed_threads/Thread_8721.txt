<s> Hello to all! </s>
<s> I am hoping for a little help again. </s>
<s> here are my specs Model : Dell Dimension 2400 Chassis Type : Space Saving Service Tag : FR99741 Operating System : Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2 (Build 2600) Hard Drive 1 : ST380011A Serial Number : 3JV94TCB Size : 76.29 GB Buffer : 2048 KB Hard Drive Type : ATA Current Transfer Rate : UDMA-100 Max Transfer Rate : UDMA-100 Volumes : c :\ Size : 76.25 GB (34.95 GB Free) Optical Drive 1 : HL-DT-ST DVD-ROM GDR8162B Type : DVD-ROM drive Current CD Read Speed : 20X ( Max 48X ) Optical Drive 2 : TEAC DVD+RW DV-W58E Type : DVD/CD-RW combo drive Current CD Read Speed : 40X ( Max 40X ) Current CD Write Speed : 32X ( Max 32X ) PROBLEM : I can only burn music CDS with my drive. </s>
<s> I used to be able to put pics on either cd or dvd disks. </s>
<s> i also used to be able to put video onto a DVD (HOME MOVIE) i HAVE DVD DECRYPTOR, DVD SHRINK, AND WINDOWS(FOR MY PICS). </s>
<s> Most forums that i have read say that my drive has gone bad; they dont tend to last very long. </s>
<s> I guess my question is why can i burn music cds but when i try to burn pictures or movies my software doesnt recognize that there is media in the drive. </s>
<s> i have tried dvd-rw and dvd+rw , cd-r and cd-rw media. </s>
<s> I have also tried to troubleshoot using windows but i dont get anywhere. </s>
<s> I am hoping there is a simple fix that i have over looked. </s>
<s> Your subject line says your burner doesn't recognize media. </s>
<s> In your post you say you can burn music cd's (but no data cd's). </s>
<s> That seems a contradiction. </s>
<s> And isn't the recognition part of the burning the same for burning a music CD or a data CD? </s>
<s> So where in the turn of events does it differ. </s>
<s> You can try to burn using a free program called CDBURNERXP. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work either, I'd replace the drive and try again. </s>
<s> Replacing is a rather easy job and the drives aren't expensive. </s>

<s> now you see why i am confused! </s>
<s> I use the same burner w/out any problem when i burn music cd's. </s>
<s> But when i want to burn to a dvd media, my software (no matter which one i try) says to insert media. </s>
<s> by your reaction i'm getting that this is probably a user error? </s>
<s> Or could it be that the drive just needs replaced? </s>
<s> I was hoping there was a missing driver or update. </s>
<s> In your first post you say you can burn music cd's, but not data cd's and any dvd's. </s>
<s> Now you say you can't burn to dvd-media (only), an nothing about data cd's. </s>
<s> If ALL cd's work and NO DVD's work, it's most likely a hardware issue. </s>
<s> Why are you so reluctant to accept that fact? </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> I guess i am not understanding all the different media types? </s>
<s> I am sorry Im getting this all wrong. </s>
<s> thanks for your help anyway </s>
