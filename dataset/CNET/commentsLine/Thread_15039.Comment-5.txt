use dban:  burn the iso to a dvd, put the hard drives in a computer with no other hard drives connected, boot dban up, choose a wiping algorithm (dod short would be fine), and then let it wipe.
it'll have all the data wiped and safe for you to format (quick format) in windows and be clear of viruses.
