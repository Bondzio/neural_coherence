Not sure if it is you problem but when you read pdf files you sometime see this stalling.
It seems sometimes it wants to load a large piece of the file before it displays it but it does not tell you it is still downloading.
If you mess with when its in this condition I have had it then refuse to load that document untill I clear all the cache things.
For links that are PDF files you can generally get around this right click the link and save as.
If you have issue on general web pages that are HTML only hard to say ....
I tend to blame the firewall/virus software first for any strange problems.
