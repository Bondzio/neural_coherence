I have a My Passport, but when i try to access my PC pics using my mac, or save my mac pics onto it with the pc pics, it tells me i have to reformat and therefore loose all currently stored data. any guidance would be appreciated! thanks

Delete the current partition(s) and make new ones using the FAT(32) file system. Then fill again from the original or from your backup with all pics and video's you have. I assume you know that an external HD isn't to be used for STORAGE. It's too error prone to contain the only copy of your data. But as a backup or as a means to listen to your Mac music on your PC and view your PC videos on your Mac it's nice. Having a second or even third copy of everything on that external disk elsewhere also automatically means you won't loose any data when reformatting it. Kees

I have no ties to said store and they rarely see me as I just get stuff from newegg, amazon and other places. This is a simple thing to do and once you have your drive, folk can re-write it again if need be. The format itself was done in the first few posts. I thought this one was more interesting since they went on to discuss the PS3. You could stop at that step. Bob
