i went to the extreme here and ordered up a p3 power meter.
my home entertainment system was drawing 65 watts when off.
it's now at less than half that but my point is that we need to know where the drain is in order to do more about it.
one of my recent savings was not my choice.
our fridge died and the new one is some 70 bucks a year estimated.
i seem to remember the old one was closer to 300 or more.
