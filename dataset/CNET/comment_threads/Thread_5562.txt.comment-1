I have two laptops; one is a Mac and the other a PC.
My wife and I have a good collection of music together, but each of us has our own iPods and playlists.
Therefore, with my modest knowledge I thought it would be a good idea to have an external shared drive where we could store all our files and access them from either or both laptops.
The idea is to use that external hard drive wirelessly as you would use an internal one, in each of the laptops.
My question is, is this possible?
If so, which one would you recommend?
We are looking into buying something with 500GB.
I was especially interested in a Western Digital, but I have read so many bad reviews, and as you could probably tell by now I am not enlightened with computer knowledge I appreciate all the help!
