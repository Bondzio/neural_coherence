that site is not about custom univeral remotes, its about replacing lost ones.
My issue is that my monitor doesnt have a remote designed for it, and I would like to know if its possible to get an IR Remote to get customized for use with the screen via a USB IR sensor, as well as being able to replace my current AV receivers remotes.
