When you infringe on the forum policies, such will happen.
I see no need to write more if you intend to follow da' rules.
When you supply a link, I expected it to pertain to the issue, instead it was some unrelated site.
As to the Dlink firewall, I have the dlink and it's &quot;odd&quot; about rules.
It took me more than a few minutes to figure out how it's rules worked.
Keep reading about it and see if it sinks in.
