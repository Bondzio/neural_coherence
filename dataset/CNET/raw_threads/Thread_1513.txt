This board seems to fit my needs for gaming, but, I prefer ATI crossfire gpu, my gut feeling is that while both use pcie16, that nvidia sli ready board won't allow the ati card to work properly. Not that Nvidia isn't a great card, it's really just preference, if I had to, I would use Nvidia. I'll be running an AMD Athlon 64 x2 4800 with 2 gigs of dual channel ddr2 ram. Any thoughts...

Even though it can be done, I wouldn't attempt it. A single ATI card will work fine on an SLI motheboard, though. If you want X-Fire, why not just get an X-Fire board? Also, I wasn't aware that AMD made an X2 4800+ for socket AM2.

I've always had good luck building from the ground up with asus mobo's, all the one's that i've seen with a 939 socket were sli ready, unless, maybe nathan was right about this, that crossfire ready was only for am2 socket, that's possible, gotta go to tiger D and check that...
