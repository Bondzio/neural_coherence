with a pinout for front USB case attachment such as would be found on a motherboard that supported that kind of pinout?
I have a case with front USB ports, but no pinout on the motherboard.
I know that I could add front USB access in other ways via drive bays but was interested in using the ports already built in the front of my case.
Thanks
