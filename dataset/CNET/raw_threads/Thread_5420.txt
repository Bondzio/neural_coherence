I'll have three computers, two with XP Home and one with XP Professional. Are there any compatibility issues as far as networking? The two with the Home edition will use CAT5e (wired) and the one with Professional will have a wireless connection. Yes, the network cards are compatible. I have cable access, and the cable modem. I will get a router with a WAP (any ideas there?) and it's just a simple little home network so the the kids can access the internet and the printer. One computer with Home edition is 1.67Ghz (I know, I know), the other one with Home will be around 2.6 or 2.8 (waiting on the tax return to buy it :D) and the one with Pro is 2.2Ghz. All will have 512 RAM (unless the new one gets a gig). I think that's more tech specs than needed for the compatibility issue. But I'll take ideas on the whole setup. Thanks for the help.
