1.1.2	I partitioned it and set it up so window 's sees it .	St
1.1.3	Problem is , now the system keeps crashing every so often ... .it will either crash a game being played or completely shut down the computer .	St
1.1.4	The one thing that I noticed right off the bat was that the main hard drive is set to Master and this new drive is set to Secondary Master , but after the computer started up I figured it must be ok. That 's the only conflict I can think of that might be screwing things up .	St
1.1.5	Any ideas on why it might be crashing ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks ! !	St
1.1.7	AMD 3.0 Sound Blaster Audigy Two different hard drives Windows XP Home	St

1.2.2	What is the Wattage rating of your Power Supply Unit ?	Ques
1.3.1	your crashes could be coincidental .	St
1.3.2	if possible , use cable select drive settings and place the new drive on the middle connector , not the end .	St
