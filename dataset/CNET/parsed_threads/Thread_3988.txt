<s> Hi, I'm really new to computers and graphics cards and what not. </s>
<s> What is considered a good framerate. </s>
<s> For instance, I have a P4 3.0ghz with ATI RADEON x600 and I get around 28-30 fps on half life 2, it's played around medium. </s>
<s> There is no lag, but the graphics look awesome anyhow. </s>
<s> Once I get around 25 fps, its starts to lag. </s>
<s> I've never seen a game on HDTV with a high end machine, so I'm wondering, is the difference really noticeable? </s>
<s> The fps dropping usually means that you are in a section of the game where a lot of things are happening and your computer is working hard to keep up. </s>
<s> When you play a section of the game where the fps drops and you feel the computer is lagging, does the lag happen if you replay that section? </s>
<s> If it does then it is a section in the game that your computer is having a hard time keeping up. </s>
<s> The fix would be to upgrade the computer, maybe more RAM, better video card, and faster HDD. </s>
<s> If it does not follow this pattern then you may have a background task happening durring the game play that is slowing your computer down. </s>
<s> Investigate what is running in the back ground such as a anti-virus program, an auto update for some program and maybe even a virus or adware program is messing around. </s>
<s> See what you can turn off. </s>
<s> I believe that Half Life 2 has a FAQ you can check with that can advise you on this subject. </s>
<s> I have read reviews of video cards that run at 70 fps so yes 28-30 maybe slow but I have played on some older system with frame rates as low as 18 and still had fun. </s>
<s> Short answer is YES it is noticeable. </s>
<s> hd pc gaming is reallllllly new. </s>
<s> only a handful of video cards can run hd, and i havent kept up but i dont know of any pc games that run hd (im probably wrong though). </s>
<s> hd gaming is mainly in the realm of xbox 360 and the ps3. </s>
<s> as for hl2. </s>
<s> its kind of old and the graphics arent bleeding edge any more. </s>
<s> even fear is lagging behind but its still a system hog. </s>
<s> hl2 is one of the most optimized games iv come across therefore it isnt all that demanding. </s>
<s> if i were you i would def do some upgrading if you have the money. </s>
<s> online play is usually more demanding so if you plan on getting into that it would be a good idea to upgrade to something that can get the job done a little better </s>
<s> look @ oblivion, f.e.a.r., half life, ghost recon, doom, flight sim x, unreal turnament, quake 4, plent of games... all u need basicly is a sweet ass system and a good game with good graphics </s>
<s> thats such a crappy gaming rig i get 130+ fps in fear full settings @ 1440x900 without vsync on, i dont have an hd display but im pretty sure hd doesnt make that much difference in fps id get maybe up to 90+ fps on 1080p but its pointless since the humen eye sees at 75 fps average. </s>
<s> i play all my games @ 75 fps locked, it looks better i wander why </s>
<s> na, there is no lag whatsoever. </s>
<s> I just started learning how to build a computer and later on I'm hoping to spend around 3 grand to build one, but I researched around and the highest gaming machine will cost around 6-7 grand, which is why I think the XPS 710 H2C is a good deal since they overclock it and what not. </s>
<s> Over the years I have seen the hottest gaming computers become outdated within 1 to 2 years. </s>
<s> I tend to wait till I find a game that offers something new that makes me gotta have it. </s>
<s> Then I look into what I need to run the new game flat out. </s>
<s> Usually, I find that I can run it on a computer I have and then I play the game and see if the sparks dont fade. </s>
<s> If I still gotta have it than I build. </s>
<s> I bought 1 computer with the idea of it being very hot. </s>
<s> I had it custom built to order. </s>
<s> In 6 months it was old hat because the industry jumped to new slot design for the video slot (PCI was dumped for AGP). </s>
<s> Right now Im waiting to see if the dual core CPUs are trashed due to a new cooling scheme which is done inside the chip that may make single chip design cheaper and faster than dual core hot design of today. </s>
<s> On top of the dual core focus issue I cant find a comfort point with the new Vista OS. </s>
<s> I got the changing tech blues. </s>
<s> What is linux & do you know of free BSD? </s>
<s> From what I know these app.s accomodate multiple o/s and might be useful gaming platforms - from what I know... </s>
<s> I put a Linux version on an older pc as a way for me to get a feel for it. </s>
<s> The deeper I get the less I like what I find. </s>
<s> Anything Linux seem to lead to out of step position in terms of game play. </s>
<s> I have not given up on it but at this point I'm working through a 3 inch thick book on. </s>
<s> I had some success with a live CD version but still don't have a comfort point with it. </s>
<s> Have you ever gone to Linuxgames.com? </s>
