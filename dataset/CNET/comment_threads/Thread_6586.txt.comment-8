When using Win2000ProSp4 Always get back to same problem: At bootup, blackpage comes up with Win can not start because xxxx/missing files (name of file) But at each restart the name of missing file changes..
Adds: you can repair this file usiing Win2000 CD-Rom.
NOW is this Related to BAD SECTORS or is it simply a current bug with that OS?
