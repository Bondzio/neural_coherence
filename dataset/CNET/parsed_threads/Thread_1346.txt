<s> Hi all, I just moved house and re-setup my computer (a Dell XPS T600r PIII, 512MB RAM, 50GB HD, 19in Dell Trinitron, NVidia TNT2 64MB video card.) </s>
<s> It works fine except for one annoying new problem: the screen now flickers and jumps 75% of the time. </s>
<s> Periodically it will stop for maybe a minute and then it resumes hopping. </s>
<s> I never had this problem prior to moving. </s>
<s> What might be causing this? </s>
<s> Have you checked the refresh rate you have the drive set for? </s>
<s> don't know the version of Windows so I can't tell you how to do it, but generally you go to Control Panel/Display and under Settings/Advanced/Adapter you can see the refresh, it must be 70Hz or higher to avoid flicker. </s>
<s> Have you tried pulling it away from the wall, maybe put it on the floor for a test a few feet from where it is now, and see if it makes a difference, could be power cables in the wall creating problem (seen this once). </s>
<s> Don't take anything for granted and recheck all setting and cabling. </s>
<s> Next try moving the monitor or system to a different location and outlet. </s>
<s> If it settles down then, you have &quot;RF outside interference&quot; of some sort. </s>
<s> Last, its possible some damage may have been done during the move and its starting to fail. </s>
<s> If under warranty, use it don't mention the move. </s>
<s> ;0 good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Don't forget to check and see if you have the latest drivers from the manufacturer. </s>
<s> I have a 128MB Nvidia (sp?) </s>
<s> and I also had a similiar problem. </s>
<s> I adjusted the refresh rate and downloaded the latest drivers and it's working fine now. </s>
<s> Also you might reseat the video card to be sure it is properly in its slot. </s>
<s> Thanks for all your replies, folks:) I'll try moving the PC to a new location and see if that helps re: mag interference JMarchi and Willy. </s>
<s> I've checked the plugs to make sure there's nothing disconnected. </s>
<s> But the suggestion of reseating the video card is a good one, thanks Islander. </s>
<s> Interestingly, Denjones, I upped the refresh to 85MHz and it solved the prob for about a day and then I experience some more flickering, though not as often... </s>
<s> Not sure what type of monitor, bit if is a flat lcd your issue may be the inverter board </s>
