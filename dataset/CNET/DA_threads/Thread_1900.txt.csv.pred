1.1.6	Here are the stats on my computer...

1.2.1	Drive letters are not a BIOS's job.	St
1.2.2	So nothing to do there.	St
1.2.3	XP may sniff out the old drive letters, so if this was mine I would install the new drive on it's own, install the OS then boot it up, complete the install that Microsoft doesn't do for us (drivers and more) and when I like it, add the old drive back in.	St
1.2.4	Have fun, bob	St
1.3.1	If the poster wants a dual boot situation for W98 on original drive and XP on the new, it's not gonna happen....he may or may not be able to edit the boot.ini file to do it, but it won't be automatic.	St
1.3.2	But he will end up with access to that original boot drive the way you mentioned and maybe that's all he wants while he moves/copies files over to the new and then format the old again to empty it out.	St
1.3.3	TONI	St
1.4.1	Don't want to do dual boot, just save files on old C & E drive.	St
1.4.2	Put newer drive for boot drive, old HD over a year old.	St
1.4.3	OK Bob, I will remove 40 gig WD HD, install 80 gig HD, partiton, format and install XP.	St
1.4.4	After I get windows running again, I will remove the other drive and put the 40 gig HD in its place.	St
1.4.5	That sound OK.	St
1.4.6	Thanks to both, Bob and Toni.	St
1.4.7	Ben	St
