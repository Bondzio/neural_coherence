'Learn how to share your cellular data connection using Personal Hotspot, the Internet-sharing feature on iPhone, iPad (3rd generation) Wi-Fi + Cellular or later, and iPad mini Wi-Fi + Cellular.'
What you're saying is good news of course, but I had read this from the Apple site earlier and assumed that when I get the iPad it should/must be a 3rd gen. model.
Maybe they're just trying to upsell me?
Thanks
