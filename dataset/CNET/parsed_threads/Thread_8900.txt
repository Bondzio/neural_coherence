<s> I've had my laptop for two years now and I WANT a new computer, buy I don't really NEED one yet. </s>
<s> I thought about what I should do and came to the conclusion that now really isn't a good time to purchase one. </s>
<s> It seems that it would be smarter to wait until Vista & Leopard are released, and the format wars are (relatively) resolved. </s>
<s> Are there any other reasons (upcoming technologies) why I should wait to make my purchase? </s>
<s> (Like the upcoming holographic drives or implementation of flash memory in laptops) </s>
<s> No! </s>
<s> Why would you wait? </s>
<s> You should know by now how fast technolodgy changes. </s>
<s> If you buy something today, within a few months it's going to be outdated anyway! </s>
<s> They are making things so fast that the average person cannot keep up with it. </s>
<s> As far as waiting for Vista, etc., there are going to be so many bugs with the first release it's pathetic. </s>
<s> I mean all you have to do is look at 98 and all the &quot;patches&quot; that are still coming out now! </s>
<s> So you see, it really does not pay to wait. </s>
<s> You would be waiting forever to keep up with the new stuff. </s>
<s> When you do buy however, you may want to get something that you can upgrade. </s>
<s> Saying that though, you have already answered your own question by saying that you don't NEED one, that you only WANT one. </s>
<s> That just goes to prove that you will be waiting forever to catch up. </s>
<s> I built my computer 3 years ago and most of the computer dealers did not even know what I was talking about when I asked about SATA drives let alone have cables, etc. </s>
<s> for them. </s>
<s> So no, do not wait if you can afford to buy one. </s>
<s> Better yet, if you do not know how or don't think you can, research it and build it yourself. </s>
<s> Not only is it cheaper (although some will argue with that) you have the satisfaction of what YOU did. </s>
<s> Plus there are so many websites and free courses through CNET you can take, why not? </s>
<s> Hope this helps and I know you will still be getting posts for this for a month from now, so check things out, ask for help and good luck. </s>
<s> what are we talking about? </s>
<s> Does this operating system (Vista) support all 32 bit programs, drivers, etc. </s>
<s> If not, then what good is it, or do you get all other programs that support 64 bit. </s>
<s> Blu-ray vs HD DVD (vs HVD) </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Picton has made a very valid if not THE most important AND overlooked fact about Vista! </s>
<s> 32-bit vs 64-bit. </s>
<s> I know I sure as h*** am not going to upgrade to a 64-bit system anytime soon. </s>
<s> I sure don't know anybody with the kind of cash it would take to do a complete crossover from 32 to 64-bit! </s>
<s> Holy cow! </s>
<s> I'm really glad he said that because it never clicked on me that you would have to change all your programs and everything to 64-bit. </s>
<s> As I said, just something that one overlooks. </s>
<s> Unless MS is going to pull something out if a hat to make it possible! </s>
<s> Yeah, right. </s>
<s> Anyway, I was just curious if your laptop is the only computer you've had yourself and if you prefered it to a desktop? </s>
<s> I understand that being a student a desktop is not very practical and you also didn't specify if you wanted another laptop or a desktop. </s>
<s> I know some people like a laptop over a desktop but I, personally, hate the things. </s>
<s> I have a hard enough time using a big keyboard to type with. </s>
<s> I can see by what you mentioned about holographic drives, etc., that you are very technologically driven and I'm going to make a guess that no matter WHAT kind of computer you have, that it's not going to be big enough or fast enough but hey, welcome to the club. </s>
<s> Anyway, it is going to be interesting to see how the 32-bit vs 64-bit issue is going to be handled by the big boys. </s>
<s> I think the question about 32-bit vs. 64-bit comes down to just being prepared for it. </s>
<s> On your next machine, just make sure that is capable of running 64-bit software, but use a 32-bit OS until you are ready to switch over. </s>
<s> Make sure the motherboard and processor are 64-bit compliant and the rest of the hardware should follow with 64-bit drivers because the hardware manufacturers know that this is what is coming and they are all getting ready. </s>
<s> Almost all new hardware have 64-bit drivers, and most big manufacturers are trying to catch up with drivers for the last generation of hardware that they released. </s>
