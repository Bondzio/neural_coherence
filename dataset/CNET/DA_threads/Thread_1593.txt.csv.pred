1.12.1	I have had horrible experiences of late with ABS computers.	St
1.12.2	I was a long-time customer, and had great luck with them prior to the last year...	St
1.12.3	I bought a high-end notebook and workstation from them about a year ago...	St
1.12.4	The notebook died within months of purchase... needing a bios and hard drive replacement.	St
1.12.5	The workstation experienced motherboard failure almost immediately (related to a faulty USB port that seems to be endemic to the ASUS motherboard that was shipped with the unit).	St
1.12.6	To their credit, they replaced the computer... but its now a year later, and the computer went up in smoke yet again!	St
1.12.7	The company is dragging its feet with repairs (the thing croaked over a week ago).... needless to say they won't replace the computer (even though it is abundantly clear that the product is defective).	St
1.12.8	In the past year, the computer has been non-functional for over a month!	St
1.12.9	The company is utterly unapologetic, and utterly unresponsive to repair requests.	St
1.12.10	I heard a rumor that they are going under... is their any truth to this?	St
1.13.1	I'm thinking of buying the ABS Mayhem G4 A78.	St
1.13.2	I can't find any reviews of ABS notebooks on CNET unless I go back to 2004.	St
1.13.3	What is the reputation of this company?	St
1.14.1	but their desktops seem good.	St
1.15.1	I didnt have a problem with ABS machines.	St
1.15.2	I got an ABS from 2000 and never had any problems with it.	St
1.15.3	It even came with a 20 ich CRT which works to this day, but I replaced it with a 19 inch LCD.	St
1.15.4	The system had a P3, and worked fine until a coupke of months ago when I got broadband, and the whole system was infected with spyware.	St
1.15.5	That was my fault for not having anything to protect it.	St
1.15.6	The system works great, but I replaced it because I needed a more current computer.	St
1.15.7	I even have 2 removable hard drives on it.	St
1.15.8	I find ABS to be great PC builders.	St
