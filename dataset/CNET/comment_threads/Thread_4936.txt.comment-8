I pay the bill and it is in my name.
I am going to call them tomorrow and ask what the heck is going on.
I have a feeling though that AT&T is going to send me the 2nd level internet support that I have to pay for, which I refuse to do.
They send me there just to configure my email for my browser.
Thanks for your responses.
Oh another thing should I have my network set at Public or Private.
