So the computer is right next to the modem.
Just take the router and connect a patch cable (short cable) to it (WAN side) and plug the other end into the modem.
Take the long cable from the modem that is in the wall and plug it in one of the port of the router.
Take another patch cable and plug one end to your computer and the other to the router.
At the end of the long cable in the other room, get a switch and plug in as many computer as you want (limited to the number of ports, of course).
modem &gt; router &gt; 1st port your computer, 2nd port long cable to the other room &gt; switch.
