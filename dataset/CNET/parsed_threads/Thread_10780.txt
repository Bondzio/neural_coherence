<s> I am considering building a new computer for the first time. </s>
<s> I have begun doing some research into it and would like to know: 1.) </s>
<s> A good estimate of what building a moderate (2.0 ghz+, 40 gb, 512 RAM, etc..) computer WITHOUT including the cost of the monitor. </s>
<s> 2.) </s>
<s> I would also like to know more about the AMD Sempron compared to Athlon XP. </s>
<s> Which one is the better choice? </s>
<s> Compared to Intel, are the AMD chips a better deal for building moderate level computers? </s>
<s> Thank You for your help! </s>
<s> The AMD chips take a little more care in the heatsink and power supply area. </s>
<s> Some first time builders power up the machine without the heatsink and fry the CPU. </s>
<s> They take as much time to build as other machines. </s>
<s> So the cost is similar. </s>
<s> If you were looking for prices, they vary by country and more. </s>
<s> You should try newegg or such if in the US. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> But how do they match up? </s>
<s> which is better? </s>
<s> AMD Sempron? </s>
<s> XP 64? </s>
<s> P4HT? </s>
<s> I don't compare CPUs. </s>
<s> You do that at the usual websites like http://www.tomshardware.com But that's a fool's errand. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> Selecting the &quot;best&quot; CPU and not understanding that hard disk and video can be a drag chute on the CPU's performance is always fun for me to watch. </s>
<s> I've seem people fret over the CPU but miss their performance mark by putting in a substandard or recyclying their old video card. </s>
<s> If I was to build a new machine today, I would start with the 64-bit capable CPU for a simple reason that I'd want that for the video work and Suse Linux. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I bought an athlon 64 3500 and i love it! </s>
<s> If your into games than this Cpu is right down your lane. </s>
<s> When bundled with the right Video card and enough ram you will have a killer RIG. </s>
<s> www.pricewatch.com Great site, get pretty much anything from here </s>
<s> Yeah I see, or NOT ! </s>
<s> Okay so you're running a 64bit processor there but not using 64 bits - hmmmm really efficient. </s>
<s> The reason I know that you aren't using it is because - Windows XP isn't 64 bit ! </s>
<s> Only now is Microsoft offering beta testing of Windows XP Pro 64 bit. </s>
<s> And all the software available is 32 bit - all of them have to be recompiled for 64 bit when it comes out. </s>
<s> Are you going to need 64 bit power ? </s>
<s> Not really - nor is it neccessary. </s>
<s> The majority of the power users will do just fine with the increased speed of a faster cpu and efficient running subsystems. </s>
<s> Just a thought ! </s>
<s> You wouldn't write that if you used one. </s>
<s> In closing video editing is much better on these systems. </s>
<s> Have you tried it? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> LOL Have your run Linux or windows XP 64bit? </s>
<s> Oh wait I do </s>
<s> go to pricewatch.com you can find AWESOME prices for parts </s>
