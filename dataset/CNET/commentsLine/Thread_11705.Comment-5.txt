back in the day - windows 3.1 - a 20 meg hard drive (what am i going to do with all this space?!?)
- wing commander was the closest thing to flying an actual x-wing - ibm microchannel architecture (another mistake of mine) - roland mt32 - sierra - space quest - king's quest.
it was great.
and then, i began having trouble getting &quot;newer&quot; programs to run (even more so).
upgrades ($money$), patches, install errors, compatibility issues, etc.
i used computers on the outside (work, school, library), but didn't purchase any newer models.
i got by for a long while, but it became increasingly clear, and i grudgingly accept the fact - one simply has to have a computer today, in much the same way we have cars or phones - it's inescapable.
i was still using my walkman cassette player a short while ago until my friend told me to &quot;wake up and smell the 90s.&quot; (yes, he knows its 2005, but that's his oddball humor at work).
it's a bummer that computers can't be more like consoles, where i can pull any game off the shelf, bring it home, and simply play it - no problema.
but i do use my computer for graphics/art, emails, research, etc.
as well.
well, that's the story (and i'm stickin' to it).
thanks everyone, for your help.
