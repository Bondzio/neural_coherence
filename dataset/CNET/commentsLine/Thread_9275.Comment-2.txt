did you use the old grey ata ribbon cables on your hdds with your last pc and are there the new blue ata ribbon cables on this one?
maybe someone reading this can help out better than i can because i still use old pcs and win98se but i know that the new ata hdd cables are usually used with cs (computer select), instead of master and slave settings, and have a lot more wires than the old cables.
if there are the same number of pins in the cable sockets on your new motherboard, perhaps you could try your old grey ribbon cables to see if that works.
you could also try booting your new pc from a win98 floppy disk and then run fdisk.
remove the partition on each drive and then allow xp to set them up as ntfs.
it may be that the new motherboard bios will not recognise the set-up of the hdds from your last pc.
i'm guessing that your new motherboard doesn't take sata cables or takes both sata and ata but has the sata switched off in the bios if you are still using ata hard drives.
also, does the bios have an auto detect for the hard drives.
if they are still set-up by your old pc the new one may not like the old setting.
can anyone who is familiar with the new ata cables help out here ?
