<s> Hi, I'm trying to help my roommate with his computer, but I need some help figuring out what's wrong with it. </s>
<s> I don't know all the specs, but it's got a P4 and has been working acceptably up until now. </s>
<s> This morning he tried to turn it on and it wouldn't boot. </s>
<s> I've opened it up, and a green led on the mobo is lit whenever the computer is plugged in, which makes me wonder if the PSU is ok. </s>
<s> When I try to turn on the computer the CPU's heatsink fan spins for a second, and then stops, which also seems to indicate that it's getting power. </s>
<s> The PSU fan does the same thing: spins for a second and then stops. </s>
<s> If I hit the power button after that nothing happens. </s>
<s> If I unplug the computer for a few seconds the led will go out, and when I plug it back in and hit the power button the fans will again spin for a second and then stop. </s>
<s> The fact that at least some juice seems to be flowing makes me wonder if the mobo, not the PSU, is the problem. </s>
<s> Any advice would be greatly appreciated. </s>

<s> OK, this is really weird: it occurred to me that the power cord might be faulty, so I replaced it with one of my power cords, and it booted up fine. </s>
<s> I unplugged it, put the old cord back, and now it's working fine again. </s>
<s> What in the world does this mean? </s>
<s> It happened again; the fans will spin when the power button is pressed, but it won't start. </s>
<s> Is there any way to figure out what the problem is without buying a new PSU to try out? </s>
<s> I could really use some help with this. </s>
<s> PSUs fail in all different ways. </s>
<s> Some go Snap, Crackle and Pop, some die a slow stuttering death. </s>
<s> The first step is to swap it out and see if the problem disappears. </s>
<s> I'm having a similar problem - system starts to power up, and then shuts itself off after 2 or 3 seconds. </s>
<s> I have tried using a PSU from another case and still no joy. </s>
<s> Could this be a bad connection or a bad cooling fan for the CPU or something else that I can check? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
