i have read all the posts and am still confused as to which one to buy.
i have read though that linksys have upgraded the firmware to v. 3.1 and it has a one touch buttton ses to configure the router.
has anyone out there used this new linksys wrt 54g with ses?
its the configuring part that has stopped me so far in buying a wireless router.
