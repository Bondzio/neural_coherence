<s> I just purchased the Linksys WRTSL54GS router. </s>
<s> After many many calls to them just to get it able to get online, I now want to be able to use it for network storage. </s>
<s> I have a Dell Inspiron 6000 wirelessly connected to it, and a Maxtor 100GB hard drive connected to the router via USB. </s>
<s> Following Linksys' instruction manual, I can FTP to the drive. </s>
<s> However, I can't see it in My Network Places. </s>
<s> Can someone please help? </s>
<s> FTP is the File Transfer Protocol. </s>
<s> It is one method for storing files in a central location and sharing them. </s>
<s> FTP servers will not show up under &quot;My Neighborhood&quot;. </s>
<s> That is a windows workgroup thing. </s>
<s> Personally, I prefer the FTP method. </s>
<s> Windows file sharing is very chatty and can negatively impact wireless networks when many machines are broadcastion Netbios traffic. </s>

<s> Your router will default to the workgroup name Linksys while your computer will default to the workgroup name of Workgroup. </s>
<s> Either change the router workgroup to Workgroup or your computer workgroup to Linksys. </s>
<s> After doing this you should be able to see your computer and your router in My Network Places. </s>
