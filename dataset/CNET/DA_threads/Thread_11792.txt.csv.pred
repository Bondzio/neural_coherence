1.1.1	I'm looking to buy a new graphics card for my IXTREME 6052 PC, but I'm not sure which one to get, I've noticed this one online: http://www.pixmania.co.uk/uk/uk/129398/art/pny/geforce-6200-agp-8x-256-m.html A GeForce 6200 card But I'm not sure that this will be compatible with my system, can someone confirm for me that it is, or recommend another card?

1.2.1	that's a pretty old card.	St
1.2.2	here's a better choice for only a bit more: http://www.ebuyer.com/customer/products/index.html?action=c2hvd19wcm9kdWN0X292ZXJ2aWV3&product_uid=119716&_LOC=UK the 7600gs it is MUCH faster than a 6200.	St
1.3.1	Will that work with my PC though?	St
