there was a problem with a brand new g4 tower that had a bad cooling system and a really noisy fan a year ago at work.
kind of sounded like an air-conditioner starting up.wwwwwrrrrrrwwwwhhheeerrrr!!!!
(lousy sound effects!)
our company sent it back to apple and the new g4 replacement was quiet as a church mouse.
(bad fan) if you are worried about getting fried by apple, don't worry.
apple will replace it!
guaranteed and they do not want any of their apples fried.
baked, maybe, with some brown sugar!
i do not think that it would cost you anything to have it returned and sent back for a new imac-g5 if it ever came to that, being fried.
what are the latest cnet reviews on the imac-g5?
as a suggestion, go to about.com and read the reviews on the imac-g5.
about.com has a ton of info also.
one other site would be daniweb.com a forum site.
nice!
ask a question and get the answer.
free to join apple stands behind all of its products.
guaranteed.
if you ever had a problem with an apple product and had to do a replacement, you would probably receive your replacement in the same time as i would living here in new england.
check out the apple website and distribution.
where do you live in central america?
thanks for your post, kevin
