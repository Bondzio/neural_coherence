hello i just got a windows 98se so the first thing i did when i got it was to defagment the dive c. but at 11% it said windows has found a problem and cannot continue then it said to run sandisk to find the problem.
so i tryed to run a though check but it keeped restarting so i decided to run a standard check.
so when that check was completed i attempted to defagment the drive but nomatter what i do i cant make it defragment.
got any suggestions.
