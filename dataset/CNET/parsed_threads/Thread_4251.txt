<s> I just bought a D Link DI-634M router to set up a wireless network in my apartment. </s>
<s> The apartment that I live in provides internet access from a local ISP through ethernet connections in each apartment. </s>
<s> Currently i sign in through a PPPOE connection to my ISP. </s>
<s> The router that I bought seems to be configured to be set up using a dsl or cable modem. </s>
<s> I was wondering if there is a way to set it up directly to the ethernet port. </s>
<s> So far I haven't been able to get my computer to recognize the router, and the tech support from D-Link seems stumped that I connect without using a modem. </s>
<s> After hours on the phone with them they think that the router that I bought is malfunctioning. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if it's this, or if it's just not possible to connect it directly to the ethernet port. </s>
<s> I called my ISP, and they told me that it was possible, but that they didn't provide tech support for such issues. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me? </s>
<s> Sorry, I'm new at all of this. </s>
<s> Thanks, Josh </s>
<s> computer, using a network cable (RJ45)... configured the router... try to disable the dhcp on the router or try to configured and change the IP range and gateway etc. </s>
<s> and dhcp enabled... the manual will have many informatino for this. </s>
<s> then disconnet the computer and plug the cable to the apartment connection. </s>
<s> Try to connect the network cable to the LAN port (usually that ethernet wall plug in your apartment, is already running from a router) </s>
