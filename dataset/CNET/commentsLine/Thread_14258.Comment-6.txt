in the event log, look for any obivous clue.
since it freezes it won't be able to report but there's a chance it may.
as for any heat issues, run the pc with cover off and fan blowing in and see if it lasts longer or gets further before a freeze.
i mentioned a possible amd issue as together with the amd chipset could be an issue, but check the amd forum and query there and/or review what's posted.
also, you may want to &quot;repaste&quot; the cpu to hsf setup using the thermo paste like arctic silver for better operation instead of any &quot;thermal tape setup.
check arctic silver website for such details.
