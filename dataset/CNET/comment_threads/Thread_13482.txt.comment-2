We don't know your processor type or how the heat sink locks down on it but I'd bet dollars to donuts that you don't have good contact between the two.
Those cheesy plastic 1/4 turn locking mounts are the worst...if that's what you have.
You need the thermal compound evenly spread.
No gaps.
And you need the heat sink flush across the entire CPU with all mounts exerting even pressure.
If one mount pops up, heat transfer is severely compromised.
