let me tell you plextor has been no help... i did actually update the firmware.
but here's the funny part, in some places on plextor's website is says it does support dvd-r dl and in other places it says it does not support it.
i updated my firmware because thed update says it will burn dvd-r dl but then i emailed plextor about it and the response i got was that the drive does not do '-r dl' but you're right the updated firmware says it does, only probelm is plextor still says they don't.
they need to make up their mind about this.
i want to test it out myself but i can't seem to find dvd-r dl disks anywhere.
i think i'll have to order them online or something.
