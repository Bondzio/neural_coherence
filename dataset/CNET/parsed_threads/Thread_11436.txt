<s> With help from this thread, I launched a new pc. </s>
<s> I might be able to salvage the old PC (Dell 4600 P4) as a server. </s>
<s> But the PS is NOISY. </s>
<s> The hard drive is NOISY. </s>
<s> I've had it for 6 years. </s>
<s> I'm thinking of replacing the hard drive and PS, and using the old machine as a backup unit. </s>
<s> I may need to format the old hard drive, but will I need to install a new OS? </s>
<s> New computer is win7. </s>
<s> Old computer is XP. </s>
<s> They don't network nicely. </s>
<s> I should know. </s>
<s> It took a bit of wrestling to make the two OSes see each other (lotsa help on google for this). </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> If I have to buy an OS, I might as well just buy an new backup unit outright and recyle the old PC. </s>

<s> Better run the scan: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor My guess is, nope. </s>
<s> By the time you make it compatible it might be cheaper to buy a new one. </s>
<s> Might be a real good PC, for awhile for someone without one or some much needed up grade parts for an older PC or possible yours if some of them are new. </s>
<s> You will need to replace that hard drive though, noise is never good on a hard drive. </s>
<s> It maybe failing now. </s>
<s> Other uses for old PCs: http://www.pramnos.com/story69-2331.html There is always the Linux OS. </s>
