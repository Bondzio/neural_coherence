1.1.1	I 'm trying to decide between two different systems , but ca n't come to a decision .	St
1.1.2	I was hoping someone here with more knowledge could help me decide .	St
1.1.3	The first system , an HP M7330N , is the cheaper of the two .	St
1.1.4	I have n't been able to find out much about the system , but it does seem decent for the price .	St
1.1.5	Right now , all i 'm worried about it a decent media center pc .	St
1.1.6	The second computer is a Dell Dimension 5150 .	St
1.1.7	This is about 200 dollars more expensive , but it comes with dual tv tuners ( a feature that 's important and one the hp lacks ) and i 'm used to going with dell computers .	St
1.1.8	Couple of factors that are holding me back : the tv tuners ( dell ) , i really want the AMD 64 X2 ( hp ) , and i hear that hp computers suck ( even moreso ) if you want to add and expand in the future .	St
1.1.9	But still , the price of the hp is looking really good to me .	St
1.1.10	Can anyone here give me any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.11	I do n't really play games on the computer , but i intend to more often ( sims 2 , the movies , half-life 2 ) .	St
1.1.12	Just a few games , really , and i 'm not worried about having the visuals maxed out .	St
1.1.13	I just photoshop and watch tv .	St
1.1.14	Sorry if this is a bother .	St
1.2.1	IMHO , The HP 7330N is a better and faster system , which probably has only two drawbacks for your stated use .	St
1.2.2	One , is the lack of dual tuners .	St
1.2.3	You can fix that either by an external USB tuner or a ATI All-In-Wonder card such as X800 or X1600 .	St
1.2.4	Two , is the integrated X200 Radeon graphics .	St
1.2.5	That is resolvable by using the above AIW , or a card such as Nvidia 's 6800GS or better .	St
1.2.6	( Any faster card would require that you upgrade the pwer supply too ... ) The biggest advantages over the Dell are the X2 4200 VS the P4 3.0 and the MUCH bigger hard drive .	St
1.2.7	PLUS that the 5150 is discontinued in favor of the E510 series..	St
1.3.1	Your reply is muchly appreciated .	Polite
1.3.2	On the Canadian Dell website , the 5150 is still available , so i had no idea it was discontinued .	St
1.3.3	I checked the american site and sure enough , it 's not there .	St
1.3.4	I 'm really glad you pointed this out to me .	St
1.3.5	So , with the All-In-Wonder , i 'll be able to record one show and watch another ?	Ques
1.3.6	That would be great , but like you said , i 'd have to upgrade the power suply .	Polite
1.3.7	Only problem , i hear that 's hard to do if you do n't use HP products ( the style and size of the casing ) .	St
1.4.1	If you went with the X1600 , X1800 or NEW X1900 AIW 's , you would have to replace it ( my HP 1250N has a 300-w PS which works fine with a 6800GS but I would n't try higher than that ... 7800/X1800 's require like 450W PS ) .	St
1.4.2	The X800 AIW should n't need a PS upgrade but it could n't hurt .	St
1.4.3	I just would n't want a card that old when newer ones are n't much more expensive !	St
1.4.4	I believe you can watch one and record another but I have n't tried it yet ( no tuner yet on my Media Center PC lol ) .	St
1.4.5	As far as the PS upgrade itself , HP uses more standard sized PS , unlike DELL which is notorious for customized PS setups ( try a standard PS and watch your MB fry )	St
