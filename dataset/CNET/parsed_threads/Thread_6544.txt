<s> You might be doing this backward. </s>
<s> I'd suggest this, buy a motherboard with the most universal socket available with the ability to run the most advanced process then plan to upgrade in the future when the prices drop. </s>
<s> If your lucky, and you do some serious shopping, you might find a bundled set that match these objectives. </s>
<s> In two years you could be running a quad core for $100.00. </s>
