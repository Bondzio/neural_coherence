I guess we've had this printer for over a year now, but only recently ran out of ink. So, put in a new cartridge. No problem. I've done this many times before w/ other printers. Now, every time we turn on the printer, it prints a test page. So we quit shutting off the printer. But every time we turn on the computer, it says 'you've just changed the ink' and wants us to align the printer heads. Have to cancel out of that or it prints another test page. And yes, I did align originally when I changed the ink. The printer has worked great up to now, but I can't make this problem go away. It's really irritating, to say nothing of wasting ink and paper w/ all the test pages. Windows XP machine. HP all-in-one (print, scan, copy) 1350. Help!?!

This is done in order that ink &quot;jets&quot; become proper. A test pattern is printed then you select best results, it prints again, if OK, then save and exit out. It will not repeat this process until another ink cart is replaced. I can suspect you exited out before the entire process was done and *accepted* as finished r it just got hosed. HP support website does have clues if you really did alright, how to correct the problem. You can contact them via email, if you don't seem to get a direct hit: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/documentSubCategory?rule=561&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en&product=306888&lang=en I have this PSC 1350 and it hasn't gone this route. You can try an uninstall and re-install if all this fails, but do that as a last resort. I would also suggest you do a registry clean(got a cleaner) before you re-install plus a reboot after the PSC 1350 uninstalled then physically disconnect, then follow the proper install procedure. tada -----Willy

I'll go thru the help topics, and try unplugging and reinstalling the cartriges. Thanks.
