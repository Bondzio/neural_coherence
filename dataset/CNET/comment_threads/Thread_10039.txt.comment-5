There is no free BluRay player software.
(this is true today and if anyone finds such, please share it.
No, trials do not count!)
This is why a bare drive may not do what you want.
I've lost count of folk that get the drive then discover they need software.
The sad part is if they had got the software with the drive, it would have been cheaper.
