&quot;vga &gt; vga to dvi adapter &gt; dvi any advantage ?&quot; none at all unless that's what is needed to connect the monitor you have.
why?
the adapter is just wires to send the signal to the proper pins.
&quot;is there bigger advantage if i get a new vid card with dvi out?
currently my machine has onboard radeon x300/x550 series.&quot; i want to lump these two questions into one.
almost any video card can outperform onboard video.
so there is an advantage there.
