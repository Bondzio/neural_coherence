<s> Okay, I've upgraded my pc (practically everything, hard drive, processor, ect, ect.) </s>
<s> Anyway, it (obviously) doesn't have an operating system. </s>
<s> I have another computer with vista (premium). </s>
<s> I have the backup disks for that pc, can I use the backup disks to put the operating system on my upgraded pc? </s>
<s> Or do I have to buy a stupid operating system again? </s>
<s> there's always Linux. </s>
<s> One OS per system. </s>
<s> You can't make multiple copies or installs, all understood in the EULA during the install. </s>
<s> If you don't use the other system, yes, you swap over or re-install but again only one OS per system. </s>
<s> The other system must now be defunct. </s>
<s> This is all in the confines of a legal user. </s>
<s> Visit MS support website on such details, they really provide it. </s>
