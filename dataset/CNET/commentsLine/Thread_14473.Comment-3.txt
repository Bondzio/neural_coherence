but i did like having the remote included.
then again, some people never use it.
i use it occasionally, but not for front row.
ipod docks with speakers work nice with it though .
i wish they had used the air keyboard for the new models.
i think the mbp keyboard could be better.
but the new trackpad feature looks good.
it's not like you would use the remote while you are using the mac anyway.
unless you use front row constantly... lol.
