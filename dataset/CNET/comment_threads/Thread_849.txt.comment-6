dvd What I seem to be understanding from your replies is that permanent storage should be on dvd or cd and that I should make 2 copies.
Question 1- Is there a significant difference between cd's and dvd's?
Since my older equipment has a cd writer but not a dvd writer, am I getting comparable quality by using a cd for back up instead of a dvd?
Exactly why should I purchase a new dvd writer, are dvd's that much better and why?
Question #2-It seems from the comments that as long as I backup frequently on cd/dvd, for my purposes an external hard drive would be unnecessary.
Based on the comments concerning problems with the external hd, it is my understanding that you cannot rewrite files from the external hd to my computers , and so I probably would not buy one.
Do you see any reason why I should have one?
Instead, I would plan to continually transfer files to the flash drive until I permanently transfer them to the cd/dvd.
Thank you so much for (continuing) to help me with this.
