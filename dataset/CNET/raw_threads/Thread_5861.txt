Microsoft Windows Xp Version 2002 Service Pack 3 Dell DIM3000 I've tried to uninstall both and restarted. Nothing happened Disk drive D always saids please install disk. It does not read the disk is in there. Disk drive E does not open. I've tried using a paper clip and restart computer. I've tried to update with windows and nothing happened again. What can I do to fix this?
