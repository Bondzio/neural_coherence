I am not a networking pro but I know enough that this is pissing me off and there is probably a real simple fix. I have access to my linkstation through the browser and I can add folders through that access but when I installed the linkstation it failed to map the drive and it is not showing up in the my computer folder. Now with that being said I cannot find or use nero to burn something from the drive because it does not see it. I have not tried mapping the folders on the drive and I do not know if that is even possible so I figured I would ask first before doing anything crazy that I would not be happy with anyway. I am running NIS 2009 with a Linksys router. Any and all help will be greatly appreciated.
