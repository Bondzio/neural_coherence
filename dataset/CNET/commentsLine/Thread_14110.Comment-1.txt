alright so i just bought a new linksys wireless router, model no.
wrtg54g2.
i got it all setup and such and got it working with my itouch.
but for some reason it won't work with my laptop.
when i go to the view available wireless networks, it doesnt show up.
i have a feeling the problem is with my laptop not seeing the router since the itouch and the router work fine.
anybody wanna help?
