I did go to the website and download all of the latest drivers and pathces for the motherboard.
(First thing I actually did) I will pick up a new PS and see if that works.
I am still a little concerned about the motherboard being on the cheapy side as well.
Tough to rule out something when your faith in it is declining :-/
