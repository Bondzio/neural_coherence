the pc i am using now is using windows xp service edition two, and is running fine but i also have another pc i dont use.
i was wondering if there was anyway i can connect the two to give more memory and make my current pc run better than it is now.
im looking for more memory and maybe a faster pc.
if anyone could help that would be great.
