This is fine when you are using a laptop and have both jacks literally right at your finger tips. But what happens when you are using a desktop? My tower isn't real close to where I sit and I question whether the cable would stretch that far. Further complicating matters is that I have PC speakers plugged into one of the stereo jacks on the back of the tower. As a result, I have two small speakers next to my monitor and when I want to use headphones I just plug the headphones directly into the speakers as opposed to the back of the computer. So what can I do to resolve this issue. Thank you.
