<s> In Vista Home Premium I want to &quot;power down&quot; my newly installed INTERNAL &quot;second&quot; 500 gig HDD (used for videos, photos, music) when it is not being used (mainly to decrease ware and prolong HDD life). </s>
<s> Is this even possible to &quot;power down&quot; only the 2nd HDD and not the main HDD?? </s>
<s> There must be lots of people with 2 or more internal HDDs out there, someone must know. </s>
<s> Maybe someone with great windows vista knowledge could &quot;tell me&quot; or possibly write a macro to &quot;power down&quot; my second HDD. </s>
<s> My system is Gateway GM5457E, Vista Home Premium, Intel E6320 CPU@ 1.86 Gig, 4x1024 (4 Gig) OCZ P5300 DDR2, (2) 500 Gig Seagate SATA HDDs, BFG8600GTS OC Video Card (Nvidia GeForce 512MB), TV Tuner Card (I'm sure this is too much data but Forum asked.) </s>
<s> It's been discussed with people pointing to the other OS that can do this but such is not implemented from Microsoft or others in Windows. </s>
<s> Hope this saves you time in your search. </s>
<s> Keep looking but it's not in the native OS via some hidden or known control panel. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks, maybe I should buy an external USB case and put my 2nd internal HDD in that. </s>
<s> That was also asked. </s>
<s> How to have Vista (or Windows for that matter) issue the power down to the external only. </s>
<s> While the safely unplug USB option might result in a power down, the results have been less than consistent. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks again, I was told that an after-market external USB HDD enclosure has an on-off switch and a fan. </s>
<s> Couldn't I simply switch it off when I don't need it? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Read this forum about what happens when you don't... </s>
<s> Thanks again Bob, but I am confused, I tried to find &quot;Read this forum about what happens when you don't...&quot; on the forum but no luck. </s>
<s> Could you please be a little more specific?? </s>
<s> I really need help here. </s>
<s> I don't want to buy an External HDD case about $40.00 to $50.00 with shipping unless it will solve my problem. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for your help. </s>
<s> That I won't be specific except that it's best to follow the rules about how to shut down and unplug. </s>
<s> These forums are littered with what happens when you don't. </s>
<s> I'm unsure what the problem is. </s>
<s> Today's drives are 5 year designs. </s>
<s> And I see them besting that if the drive enclosure is not overheating. </s>
<s> But some think they can extend that 5 years by turning off the power. </s>
<s> Sadly there are chemical processes that take their toll in the capacitors that limit how many years a drive will last. </s>
<s> Hope that helps. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> What are you doing and how is it being done? </s>
<s> My guess is that this second drive, D:(?) </s>
<s> is being used for back ups. </s>
<s> Is this correct? </s>
<s> Is there an OS installed on the second drive? </s>
<s> Not knowing these I'd say disable virtual memory on the second and it will remain idle. </s>
<s> Remember to re-enable it if you boot up the second OS(?) </s>
<s> on drive D:. </s>
<s> (Make an empty folder on the desk top to remind yourself, something like, &quot;Don't forget V memory on Drive D&quot;. </s>
<s> &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; importnat to remember this. </s>
<s> It may not boot if you don't. </s>
<s> This depends on how handy you are. </s>
<s> And how to do it with SATA, I've only done this on an IDE system a few years back. </s>
<s> I simply mounted a single-pole switch to the front panel, then hacked it into the 12v wire on a Molex extension I bought for cheap. </s>
<s> This left the 5volt DC connected which didn't affect anything. </s>
<s> I turned it on before I booted to Windows and the drive was automatically recognized. </s>
<s> Otherwise, with it turned off, Windows XP never saw it. </s>
<s> And it didn't appear to spin because the motor didn't have power. </s>
<s> I couldn't switch that hard drive on or off once Windows was running, it's not &quot;hot swappable&quot; or &quot;plug-n-play&quot;. </s>
<s> Anyway. </s>
<s> You might be able to Google the pinouts for a SATA power lead and achieve the same results. </s>
<s> Then buy a cheap extension to test it....... </s>
<s> You can power down the HDD simply by unplugging the power cable from the HDD. </s>
<s> That will keep the HDD from running when you turn your system on. </s>
<s> That's the best way to power down an internal drive. </s>
<s> If you really need to power down a HDD without having to keep going inside the pc and unplugging the power cable when not using it, you will be better off getting an external HDD that plugs to a usb port. </s>
<s> That way you can simply unplug the drive from the external usb port to power it off. </s>
<s> See first post above, for movies, recorded TV shows, photos, music. </s>
<s> The new second drive is 500g and is listed as &quot;F&quot; drive, my original drive is also 500G and is listed as &quot;C&quot; first drive (partition), and &quot;D&quot; a partition. </s>
<s> Hope that helps. </s>
<s> How about the external case option, I already have a 120G external HDD in an ULTRA usb/firewire fanned HDD after market enclosure and it seems to work well but I thought I could have the second 500G HDD mounted inside and save the $50.00 including the shipping. </s>
<s> I have had my 120G external setup for almost 2 years now but it is almost full. </s>
<s> When I want it I just flick the switch on the back of the enclosure and my Vista recognizes it and an audible tone lets you know it has been seen. </s>
<s> What is the down side with external HDDs?? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> JUST an added NOTE: I built my 120 gig external HDD system but it is an IDE enclosure. </s>
<s> I am assuming SATA enclosures are the same quality, again ULTRA and many other make them from about $20 to $50, but the cheaper ones don't have a fan. </s>
<s> Read the reviews. </s>
<s> desired with or without physically removing it from the system, or remove it entirely for storage elsewhere. </s>

<s> Thanks, this looks like a good solution and the reviews seem great too. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Simply use Device Manager and disable that drive. </s>
<s> (Right click on &quot;My Computer&quot; - click on &quot;Manage&quot; - left pane click on &quot;Device Manager&quot; - double-click on &quot;Disk Drives&quot; - find the disk that you want to disable, your Primary drive won't have the option, and simply click &quot;Disable&quot;) Your drives will automatically enable whenever you boot or re-boot your machine so, you'll have to disable your slave drive whenever you're sure that you don't want to use it. </s>
<s> i tried this and it does disconnect you but the drive is still spinning and i would like total shutdown because the 2nd hdd is slowing my system down </s>
