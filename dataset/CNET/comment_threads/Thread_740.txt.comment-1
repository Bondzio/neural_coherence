My computer is in the second floor; it gets really hot during the summer.
my HP was about to run at a slower clock speed before i reinstalled windows.
But after installation my computer runs at full clock speed all the time even whe its not nessary.
The question is how do i make my computer run at a lower clock speed when I surf the net or do word processing.
and i have the Microsoft MSE before but after i installed XP professial.
And NO my XP pro is not craked; my XP pro is real.
lol.
