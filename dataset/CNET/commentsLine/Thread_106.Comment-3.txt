i've purchased several adaptec external hdd enclosures and they have served me well.
they were the only mfg at the time that offered enclosures which clearly stated their enclosures handled hdds greater than 300gbs.
having used their scsi hbas....i knew i could depend on their products specs.
it appears adaptec is discontinuing this line of products from their sales.
