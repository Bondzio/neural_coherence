dear friend, the average service life of a hard disk is usually given as &quot;5 years or 20,000 hours.&quot; this means if a hard disk operates 24 hours a day, you will need to replace your drive with a new one every 1.5 to 2 years.
(for specification details, refer to your hard disk drive's user manual.)
the measure of service life used by most hard disk manufacturers is &quot;mean time between failures&quot; (mtbf)*1 (usually quoted at between 300,000 to 500,000 hours).
the ratings (for expected service life) used by pc makers are more conservative, as they are based more closely on &quot;real world&quot; usage conditions.
since expected service life and mtbf figures can differ by hundreds of thousands of hours, we recommend you use the expected service life value.
for example, the usual service life of a 2.5 inch drive will be almost 5 years or 20,000 hours, if used at the temperatures specified for your pl.
however, if a drive is operated continuously, i.e.
24 hours a day, its service life will be shorter.
also, when using a drive in equipment that runs continuously, you can extend the drive's life by using the pl's bios area &quot;sleep&quot; feature to turn the drive off after it is unused for a specified period of time.
(bios area &quot;hdd power down&quot; feature's &quot;time&quot; setting.
certain hard disks are equipped with a periodic head cleaning function, which also helps to extend drive life.
