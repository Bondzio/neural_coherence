from simply a speed perspective alone, yes, you would benefit from buying now, there is absolutely a benefit anyone with a system of your clock speed will get from the faster cpu, hard disk i/o speed, etc.
however, you really need to state what you use a computer for and how it serves your needs.
then and only then can you tell about what, if any, new technology will impact your use.
for example, if all you do is surf the web, send some emails, run quicken and turbotax, type letters with ms word and other typical unspecialized, unparticularly demanding applications, then no, you don't need to spend any money unless you just want a new machine that will be marginally faster at those uses.
instead, put your money in a 19&quot; lcd to make your use more enjoyable.
however, if you are a gamer and want good graphics or to be able to even play some of the latest games, then i'd really be surprised you've waited this long.
game players are the most frequent upgraders and usually do so every 1-2 years even if just a new video card.
find a good gaming web site that reviews products for gamers to help with your decisions.
other than that, if you run other particularly demanding applications such as cad, video editing/conversion, music production/editing (midi/wav), or any other demanding application, then yes, by all means upgrade since these areas are where you will see the most significant increase in performance.
figure out whether i/o will be more important (wav) or cpu (cad) or both (video editing) and use that to drive your product selection.
best luck to you.
