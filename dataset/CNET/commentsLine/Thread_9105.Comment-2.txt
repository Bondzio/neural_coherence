we took identical 2.4ghz p4 machines and ran a test.
1 had 512mb, the other was 1gb.
a 6 hour video encoding took 5 minutes less on the machine with 1gb.
to be fair we exchanged the memory sticks and reran the test.
about 5 minute savings.
for us, that was not enough payback.
but then again, the bragging rights may be worth it?
