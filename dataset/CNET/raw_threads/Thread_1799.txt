I recently bought a Samsung SH-S182M LightScribe 18X DVDRW as a replacement unit for it. I'm buying the 18 speed discs for it, but I have a question. Do I have to get rid of all my old 8X-16X discs I had or, can I still use them on my new drive? I'm currently running the Nero 6 software that came with the Samsung. Nero has an option that allows you to slow down the burn speed for CD's, but I didn't notice one for DVD's. Please advise. Thanks. Windows XP Home Edition SP 2
