<s> Here is my problem.... thought I would try for help someplace else (here). </s>

<s> If you still suspect heat as a possible cause, then open the case and place a floor fan and blow air on it and see if it still hangs. </s>
<s> Sadly, no search here, wish there was one. </s>
<s> From your thread it looks as if you have eliminated the P/S. </s>
<s> Here I assume you went larger, not just the same in case it is an underpower situation. </s>
<s> Remove / unplug everything you don't need (sound cards, other IDE devices (CDROM, FLOPPY) and USB,Parallel and serial devices and see if it still hangs? </s>
<s> If not add them back in one at a time and see when it starts to hang. </s>
<s> Try to eliminate possibilities. </s>
<s> What PCI devices do you have and consider moving to different PCI slots. </s>
<s> If after all this you have the same problem look to CPU, motherboard or hard drive. </s>
<s> Thanks man, I'll try the floor fan thing when I get home. </s>
<s> I'm already down to the bare essentials only with just the video card in there. </s>
<s> I found the search box, look in the FAQ link </s>
<s> I would suggest swapping the memory stick out to be sure it is not the cause. </s>
<s> --fj </s>
<s> I still keep thinking power supply. </s>
<s> I believe there are many Gateway, Dell, eMachines and HPs out there that use &quot;mini-ATX&quot; power supplies, if that is what you have from what I've seen, many are only 80 or 100 watt. </s>
<s> Marginal IMHO. </s>
<s> Look at the BIOS setup, while you are there choose a &quot;failsafe&quot; mode if available. </s>
<s> Often in the many newer BIOS setups you will be see CPU voltage and teperature. </s>
