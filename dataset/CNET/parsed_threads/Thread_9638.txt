<s> Hey, i am planning to buy a motherboard and a new processor. </s>
<s> I have chosen these two products below, however i don't know if they are compatible with each other, can somebody please help me? </s>
<s> Thank you Motherboard: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=246710&prodlist=yahoo Processor: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115003 </s>
<s> but zzf has the e6600 for a few dollars less. </s>
<s> since you're getting the mobo from zzf, why not get the cpu from them also? </s>
<s> http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=80860 also, did you choose the e6600 because you intend to overclock? </s>
<s> if not, the e6750 is faster (2.67ghz vs 2.4ghz) and cheaper ($205 vs $228): http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=10005522 </s>
<s> No i did not chose it because i was planning to over clock it, in fact i wouldn't even do that. </s>
<s> Thank you for the provided choices i will now purchase the 2nd model that you suggested. </s>
