The onboard Intel video chip is using the AGP 2X bus instead of PCI bus. I did look at the speed specs for AGP 2X and I noticed that the AGP 2X transfer speed is: 533 MBps and clock rate is 133 MHz. PCI cards are only 132 MBps and 33 MHz or 133 MHz. As you see the transfer rate for AGP 2X is alot faster than PCI so I thought my onboard Intel AGP will be overall still better than the Radeon 7200 PCI card. By the way both the onboard Intel video chip and Radeon 7200 have 32mb of video ram. I think the onboard video chip is connected to the north bridge so that's why it is using AGP. Here are specs of my motherboard. http://www.motherboards.org/mobot/motherboards_d/Trigem/Anaheim%2B3/

Now will the Intel740 be better since it's an AGP 2X instead of PCI? The Radeon 7200 I have is a PCI version so the bus isn't as fast as if it were AGP. But I needed to know is that since my motherboard can only take PCI type cards will the Intel740 AGP 2X be better than the Radeon 7200 PCI?

So even the bus is alot slower on the Radeon 7200 that I have it will still perform alot better than an Intel740 that is AGP 2X? What I basicly thought was that any AGP cards will beat PCI cards since like AGP 2X is 533 MBps and PCI cards are 133 MBps. There is a difference you know. If the Intel740 had AGP 8X then that would even be faster and better than Radeon 7200PCI right? If there are others that are looking at this topic please reply back if you know about this. Thank You
