hi here is my current setup.
motherboard gigabyte 990fxa-d3 cpu amd phenom x6 1045t graphics his radeon hd 6790 x2 in crossfirex ram 16gb gskill cheap value ram.
psu coolermaster 550w os win 7 ultimate so i baught a new motherboard the other day along with another 6790 at a really good price.
and for the last couple of days all sorts of strange things are happening.
sometimes the computer will freeze while windows is loading, at times the keyboard will turn off, when i put my computer to sleep it will take itself out of sleep straight away and other times it will just not turn back on at all.
and to top it off i turned it on earlier today and it wouldnt even post.
so only after taking one graphics card and all but one ram stick it decides to work again.
im really confused on what it could be.
i was thinking it may be the psu but it is reasonably new and it seems to work again after re inserting the extra ram and psu.
can anyone please shed some light on what they think the problem could be.
