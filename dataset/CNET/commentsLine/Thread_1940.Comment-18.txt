i am looking for a new printer.
i have always had hp printers ( 4 to date )and have been happy.
but i am willing to try something new.
the epson ink usage thing is not good.....i was leaning towards an epson until i read this stuff.
what about dell.
does someone have experience with dell?
they seem to get sort of average reviews.
i get a very modest discount, so if dell had some redeeming features or good words i might head there.
is the ink usage problem anything normal or just a fluke - like all buicks made on monday have squeaks??!
