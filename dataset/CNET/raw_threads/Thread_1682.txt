I have just purchased a HP desktop dualcore AMD 64x2 4600+, which runs xp media and want to connect to my wireless network. Any suggestions if I should get a pci card or usb adapter? I have read reviews for Netgear and they weren't too favorable. Can I use another brand or will I suffer compatability problems

You could connect using an ethernet cable or buy a wireless card and connect using the Netgear router. You failed to tell us which type of internet you are using so this is the best information I can give. Rick

I have read some posts that say the netgear doesn't work with AMD, is that a problem? Also do you recommend a card over a usb adapter? We don't want to hide ethernet cable, so that's not an option.
