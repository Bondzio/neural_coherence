look around on the web.
there are many discount computer stores online that sell what your looking for in your price range.
not to advertise for them but a company to get you started would be tigerdirect.com.
bestbuy and office depot would be other choices too.
i would recommend you buy a computer for your work use first and personal use needs second.
hp, dell, lenovo, systemmax, etc.
all have computers in your price range.
