yes, it's old but it's been updated for ntfs.
and backups are nice but they can be nothing if you get bad copies.
i've had this happen with floppies, tapes, cds and dvds.
i make 2 or 3 copies of data files and have not lost data.
(yet!!!)
but i have had to use all 3 copies to recover data, some files.
