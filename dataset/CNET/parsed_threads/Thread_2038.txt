<s> Hello, my husband just bought a gateway notebook computer for home and travel use. </s>
<s> Went into this without really knowing much about notebooks, but he really wanted one (happy early father's day to him :-)) Anyway....where do we start about getting wireless internet? </s>
<s> What do we need to buy? </s>
<s> We have a one level house currently using DSL (Roadrunner) for our 2 desktops. </s>
<s> Should we get wireless through Roadrunner? </s>
<s> Someone mentioned said NO...use wireless cards????? </s>
<s> Any information would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> 1) Did the new laptop come with integrated wireless. </s>
<s> These days, most all do, but that's not absolutely universal. </s>
<s> If it has WiFi, then you don't need anything more for the computer. </s>
<s> If it does not have built-in WiFi, you'll need to buy a PC-Card WiFi adapter (it slides into the little slot on the side of the computer). </s>
<s> 2) Are you using a broadband router for sharing the DSL between your two desktop machines? </s>
<s> If so, you'll need to replace it with a WiFi unit. </s>
<s> That will be a one-for-one swap. </s>
<s> The new router will have 4 wired ethernet ports for the desktops, but will have a radio chip and antennae too for the wireless. </s>
<s> You'll have to follow the directions for setting it up for your specific connection, but that's usually pretty easy. </s>
<s> If you are not using a broadband router for sharing the DSL, then you will need to tell us a bit more about that. </s>
<s> If you are using some sort of routing capability in the DSL modem, then you'll need to disable that to put it in bridge-mode and then install a WiFi router. </s>
<s> thanks for the information. </s>
<s> The notebook did come integrated for wireless. </s>
<s> so we are okay there. </s>
<s> We will need to get the new router so we will start there. </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
