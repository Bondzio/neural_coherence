Hi Kirby, With that powerful and up to date Athlon 64 + 3800 (Venice) CPU, why don't you also go modern and not be outdated soon by switching motherboards to the Asus A8V-E Deluxe with the PCI-Express Technology.
It only costs (NewEgg) $29 more than the Asus A8V Deluxe (AGP).
PCI Express Architecture &quot;PCI Express is the latest I/O interconnect technology that will replace the existing PCI.
With a bus bandwidth 4 times higher than that of AGP 8X interface, PCI Express x16 bus performs much better than AGP 8X in applications such as 3D gaming.
PCI Express x1 also outperforms PCI interface with its exceptional high bandwidth up to 500MB/s.
The high speed PCI Express interface creates new usages on desktop PCs e.g., Gigabit LAN, 1394b, and high-speed RAID systems.&quot; http://www.asus.com/products/mb/socket939/a8v-e-d/overview.htm For the video card: The Nvidia GeForce 6600GT PCI-E card is the same price as the AGP (NewEgg low $175).
If you can afford it the 6800GT PCI-E ($379) would be much better.
