<s> i have a shared canon MP970 attached to my Hp desk station that runs windows vista. </s>
<s> i have an HP laptop that also runs vista. </s>
<s> i have shared the printer and i can print fine when connected wirelessly. </s>
<s> however, then i connect through the eithernet cable, it will not print. </s>
<s> everything else seems to work fine except printing. </s>
<s> i have tried several location, tried reistalling the printer etc and i feel i must have overlooked something simple. </s>
<s> my router is a D-Link DIR-655 N(1. any help would be appreciated </s>
<s> I discovered my laptop got a different IP address on wifi versus ethernet. </s>
<s> What a shame the Windows networking couldn't sort all that out for us. </s>

<s> after your message i disabled my wireless and restarted the laptop so that i think it would assign a a new ip address. </s>
<s> I was sure it was the solution but i still have the same issue. </s>
<s> thanks for trying to help. </s>
<s> have shared the printer and i can print fine when connected wirelessly. </s>
<s> Think about this AGAIN! </s>
<s> Your machine moved to another IP address and those other PCs that had found the printer can't find it because it moved to another address. </s>
<s> If you give it time the other machines might work but I found most don't want to wait for that. </s>
<s> Just get on the client after you settle on how you will be connecting that laptop and re-setup the printer share. </s>

<s> This may be over my head but my router is a DHCP server. </s>
<s> so does this mean that i will have this problem every time that the computer that is connected to the printer is restarted and assigned a new ip address? </s>
<s> thanks, alex </s>
<s> Not over your head I see. </s>
<s> It's why many hard assign any server a fixed IP. </s>
<s> In your case this is not a good idea as you flipped from wifi to wired. </s>
<s> And it is hard on most owners. </s>
<s> The lesson here is simple. </s>
<s> Put your print server on a machine that won't be moving around. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> its not moving around. </s>
<s> the printer is connected to a desktop. </s>
<s> however, system updates during the night, sometimes cause a restart of the unit plus i live in the boonies and lose service at least once a day. </s>
<s> if i set my router to static ip, i guess it won't really effect the kids when they come down with their machines. </s>
<s> i could set the printer up on bluetooth but i am concerned about the range. </s>
<s> again thanks for moving me in the right direction </s>
<s> I read your first post and read it as if the printer was on the machine that changed from wifi to ethernet. </s>
<s> Sorry but that's me reading your post and it wasn't clear the printer was on a desktop. </s>
<s> Ok, if it still prints over wifi then the most likely is the old firewall issues. </s>
<s> I don't help with firewall configurations with step by steps since there are dozens out there but look at allowing all your LAN access to the server. </s>
<s> I don't see the router IP as the issue here. </s>
