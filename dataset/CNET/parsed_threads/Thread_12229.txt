<s> I recently replaced the 300W ATX power supply in my PC with a 630W one. </s>
<s> The computer turned on and seemed to work fine but Windows XP quit working. </s>
<s> Windows just quits doing anything before loading completely leaving it unable to do anything (both XP/98 and safe/normal modes). </s>
<s> Something odd is that my processor speed is now shown as 1.7GHz instead of 2.23GHz in the BIOS. </s>
<s> I've tried to reset the BIOS and reinstall Windows and neither does anything. </s>
<s> Something else that is strange is that I've installed Ubuntu Linux and it works fine (?) </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> Is there anything I can do? </s>
<s> Is it possible that my hardware has been fried and Windows just won't work on this PC anymore? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> When you put in a new power supply theres a lot of stuff you got to unplug, jingling things around, possibly damaging something. </s>
<s> Either breaking something or shocking something with a static discharge. </s>
<s> If you boot off your CD with windows XP you should try repairing the master boot record with the repair option windows install has. </s>
<s> The battery is as old as the board but I don't think this is the problem since the BIOS reset when I moved it. </s>
<s> Thats part of the problem, the Windows disks don't work. </s>
<s> They freeze just like windows itself does. </s>
