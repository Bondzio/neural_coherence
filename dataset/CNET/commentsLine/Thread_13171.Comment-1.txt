hi there, in my apple macbook 13 inch core2 duo laptop, i have a small disc stuck in the drive.
i was going to read &quot;roughguide&quot; information provided by my travel agent to look at the maps and the rest.
it is on a 8cm disc, which says that it could be used in the mac .
i inserted it in my macbook's drive and hoped to succeed.
i did not.
it is in the slot, it does not engage in any contact and it does not come out whatever method i use.
it appears that i will have to open the case to reach the drive to get it out.
how do i go about it?
help will be appreciated.
