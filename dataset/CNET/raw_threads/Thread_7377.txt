After I set up all my progs I wonted to create an image of the HD. When Drive Image restarted the computer, something stopped it from booting. It was like the HD was missing, or had no OS installed, or the boot log was gone. I look up the WD and MS help and no one could help. So I reinstalled the W2K and all the Programs form the beginning again, and after I installed the Norton A/V and reboot, the same thing happened all over again. Here my fault because I left the NAV CD in the drive and I gat the choice menu (boot from HD, or from CD) at 1 second to boot the computer stopped responding??????? What is going on? Any one observed this before? My computer is an old PII 350 Mhz with 384MB RAM. Then I switched the 160 GB HD to slave position and used my other HD, I was trying to replace, in master position and the machine boot as usual and I can see and access all the directories on the 160 GB HD.

How do I know? I have a similar issue and have yet to recreate a new 2000 SP4 CD with the fix noted at.... http://www.48bitlba.com Till you have time to digest all this, stick with what works. Bob

Lets forget about the drive image problem for the time being; Did the system boot up after you installed the OS? Did you install the 160GB HDD. with a controller (PCI card)? If not what method did you use to have the 160GB recognized?
