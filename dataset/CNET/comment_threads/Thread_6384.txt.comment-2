Just google Chuck DeJarnett and wifi gator .... You will see that I wrote the wifigator program.. Now I have dumped it because of the bottom feeders like this yzy-oui-fi hacker character getting involved with my programmer, Loren Wolsiffer.
For a fair, honest, reliable, wifi network management and billing system, go to http://www.chilliwave.com I will look forward to getting you on the right track with your wifi business.
