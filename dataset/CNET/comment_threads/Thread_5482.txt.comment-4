Thankyou for the suggestions Drobo does sound really great and simple actually, and reliability is the biggest concern for me.
Is there anything stopping me just getting say a 320GB internal HDD now, then buying a Drobo a bit later on and another HDD and transferring the first one to the Drobo (when I have the $, and when prices down a bit)?
I am in NZ and am having trouble even finding a NZ price/seller for Drobo, and not sure whether it would be any cheaper to order things from US after shipping and tax included.
Also, if did do as I mentioned above (say use one HDD for a few months) would the kind of setup we are talking about be at much risk of overheating problems if in a regular sized box (mid-tower?)?
Would moving to the Drobo setup eliminate a lot of heating issues?
Thankyou again for your help, it is greatly appreciated!
