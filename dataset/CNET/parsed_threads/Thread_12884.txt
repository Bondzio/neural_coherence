<s> Hello just saw and placed an order for a 512mb little flash drive on Buy.Com It's listed as a USB 2.0 drive but I now have my suspicions the claimed transfer rate is only about 8mb/m read and I believe 6mb/m write. </s>
<s> Is this in line with the transfer rates for a USB 2.0. </s>
<s> Here's a copy of the specs from the Buy.Com sight and the URL. </s>
<s> Do these fit the specifications for USB 2.0?? </s>
<s> in terns of transfer rate or are they trying to put one over on us. </s>
<s> Thanks Guys Tcj http://www.buy.com/prod/ACP_EP_Memory_512MB_USB_2_0_Flash_Drive_for_Mac_and_PC_span_class/q/loc/101/10356041.html Standard Warranty - 2 Year(s) Manufacturer - ACP-EP Memory Storage Capacity - 512 MB Interfaces - USB 2.0 - USB Manufacturer Part Number - MY14575 Data Transfer Rate - 8MBps Read Data Transfer Rate - 6MBps Write Form Factor - Hot-swappable Manufacturer Website Address - www.acp-ep.com Product Name - 512MB PowerUser Drive USB 2.0 Flash Drive Compatibility - Supported Operating Systems </s>
<s> Hi guys found a couple of sights that might help in figuring this whole thing out apparently their are three different standards for USB 2.0 High speed, full speed and low speed. </s>
<s> I'm assuming the low speed is for the backward compatibility issue with 1.0 and 1.1 here's the two links I found although I'm still unclear if this flash drive is actually compliant with the specifications for 2.0 hoping someone can help. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
