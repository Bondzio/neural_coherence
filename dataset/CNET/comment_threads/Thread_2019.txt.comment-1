my computer recently began to slow down to snail pace.
I originally though i had too much stuff on my HD.
After removing some stuff the computer began to move a bit quicker for a while but dropped back to it's slow pace.
I checked windows task manager and says that the System Idle Process is using over 95% of the CPU, most times 99%.
Why is my computer become so slow?
It is driving me insane because it take almost 15 mins to start up.
Thanks Perry
