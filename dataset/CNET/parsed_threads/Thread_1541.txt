<s> I'm hoping someone here can help me. </s>
<s> I am using a D-Link DI-524 802.11g wireless/wired router. </s>
<s> I have spent the past several days trying to get everything working properly and quickly. </s>
<s> I have two computers that I want to connect wirelessly to the router. </s>
<s> When I connect using WiFi, I can generally maintain connection speeds of 54mbps. </s>
<s> However, when I run speed tests (and I have run many, many of them) I only get between 1 and 2 mbps using wireless. </s>
<s> When I plug my laptop directly into the router, I can get anywhere from 5-7 or so mbps. </s>
<s> Wireless transfers are even relatively slow when transfering files between my two computers. </s>
<s> I have tried several different types and brands of routers and I have changed all of the settings that I know about. </s>
<s> I've messed around with changing encryption levels and nothing really changes. </s>
<s> I have also tried changing channels, but nothing seems to really speed things up. </s>
<s> The fastest transfers I can ever get between my two systems run a little over 1 mb per sec, but it is usually around 300 k/sec or so, which is way too slow. </s>
<s> Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Wired speed can be 100 megabit full duplex on a switched hub when maintains speed due to the switch. </s>
<s> I'll leave you to learn why a switched hub matters. </s>
<s> Wifi might be 54 megabit HALF DUPLEX and is on a SHARED AIRSPACE which can easily be interfered with. </s>
<s> Your numbers are quite normal and you need to learn about the technology you are using. </s>
<s> I can't educate you about all this in this small space, but there are fine web contents that you can keep reading till it sinks in. </s>

<s> a wireless &quot;G&quot; environment, will result in the lower speed being obtained. </s>
<s> A pure &quot;G&quot; network will yield better throughput. </s>
