I have a Dell Dimension with an Nvidia P280 graphics card.
When switching on I get the following message on the monitor.
&quot;2.
Digital Input In Power Save Mode, Press Computer Power Button Or Any Key On The Keyboard&quot; I press various keys and nothing happens, I connected our laptop to the monitor and the monitor is working.
Do I need to replace my graphics card or is something more serious going on.
