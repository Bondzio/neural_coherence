<s> He'd be quite willing to buy one of these scanners for me if I could give him the name and address of a store where they stock them. </s>
<s> They are substantially cheaper in the US than here in England. </s>
<s> I don't know exactly where he is staying in LA (and I've never been there myself) but I presume that during his time in LA he will go downtown (if that's the right term) for the main tourist sights etc. </s>
<s> I'd be grateful for a few names of stores that stock the docupen so he can pick the most convenient and so I can check prices. </s>

<s> There could be myriads of obstacles for you to overcome though, and your next best option is to try Staples for the RC-800. </s>
<s> They have a gazillion stores so your visitor should have no trouble locating one downtown or wherever (check Staples.com). </s>
<s> Contact Staples in advance by email to see if they carry stock in your store of choice. </s>
