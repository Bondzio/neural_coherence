1.1.1	Hello everyone Im currently with xplornet 4g internet and am having issues configuring my Belkin n300 wireless N router .	St
1.1.2	Basically what I am scratching my head at is this .	St
1.1.3	My router is telling me it is not connected and has a solid orange light , but my wired internet from the belkin router is working fine .	St
1.1.4	Wireless works fine coming from the belkin router as well but tends to drop at least once a day on all my wireless devices ( tablet , galaxy s2 phone , PS3 etc ) , usually only for a few seconds .	St
1.1.5	I am just wondering what could possibly cause these problems , if they are connected and how to fix them .	St
1.2.1	I was having this issue with a sparkly new router .	St
1.2.2	After a month of putting it off I dove into it and tried the usual then turned to the web .	St
1.2.3	I lucked out that others were having troubles and the maker 's web site was only reporting there were reports of the issue .	St
1.2.4	The other discussions found folk that found the prior firmware version to not have this issue so I rolled back one version and it 's much better .	St
1.2.5	I suggest you do the same research .	St
