hopefully one of the suggestions here in this forum will allow you to recover your data.
i have found that a large majority of the time it has been the enclosure that has failed and simply removing the hard drive and installing it into another usb enclosure is the solution.
if the enclosure is not the problem using getdataback has worked very well for me over the years.
use the freezer suggestions as an absolute last resort and with great care to avoid moisture.
try changing the drives orientation.
i have found that occasionally a problem drive will suddenly start working if you turn it upside down or place it on its side.
in all cases, avoid dropping or bumping the drive.
in the end, the key issue here is to never use an external hard drive as your working drive and never, ever work without a backup.
usb drives should only be used for transporting data, transferring data, backing up data, occasional/intermittent use and never used as your sole working drive.
they are simply too unreliable and prone to physical damage, static electricity as well as overheating.
the keys to using usb drives: 1. treat all hard drives with great care and avoid bumping or dropping.
they should be treated as though they were a carton of eggs.
2. always use the &quot;safely remove hardware&quot; icon before unplugging any usb drive.
if this does not work then shut down the computer before unplugging the usb cable.
3. avoid continuous running and overheating.
drives should have good circulation around them and purchase drives with built-in fans whenever possible.
4. ground yourself to discharge static electricity before handling or plugging and unplugging drives.
5. always have multiple backups of all data both onsite and offsite or use an online backup services such as carbonite or mozy as a backup to your backup.
