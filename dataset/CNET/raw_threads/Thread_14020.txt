Title is basically the question. give the choice would it be more efficient to use four 256mb sticks in dual channel configuration or a single 1 gig in single channel? all the sticks are 533mhz. Thankyou for any replies.

Many motherboards lose the dual channel benefit if more than two matching slots are filled, so your question may be moot. 2. You will have to swap out a module(s) if you want more than 1GB total RAM, leaving you with unused (wasted?) modules. Add the second 1GB module when you have future upgrade funds.

12339	3	221604	2338517	2338311	VAPCMD	12/4/06 9:25 PM	1.1652675E12	Depends on the MB architecture	....better to start off the amount of RAM you think you'll want upfront. In other words, if you want 2GB and the system has the dual channel architecture, you'll want to get 2-1GB matching DIMMs. Best to start by looking RAM recommended by the MB mfg. Using one DIMM in a dual channel architecture system will suboptimize system performance. VAPCMD

12339	5	221604	2338777	2338517	hcstreetriding	12/5/06 8:14 AM	1.16530644E12	in that case	This was just a deal on four sticks of 256 and im building a comp for a friend and tryin to save him money. However, we would both like to spend a little more for dependability, and to save hassle in the future. and from what it sounds like no one is getting night and day differences, even on online articles, between running four vs two and dual channel vs single, ECT. Thanks for the help!

I've seen it with those fo six slots where the third pair reduces the speed, not disavbles Dual Channel. I feel that your reply may be very misleading. The double bandwidth that one gets from Dual Channel is far bwetter for those CPU's such as Intel P4's that can handle the extra bandwidth.

12339	8	221604	2339334	2339077	linkit	12/5/06 6:15 PM	1.1653425E12	I agree. That is misleading.	&quot;Many motherboards lose the dual channel benefit if more than two matching slots are filled, so your question may be moot.&quot; I meant that the dual channel benefit (not necessarily dual channel mode) may be lost if a slot or slots are used beyond the two matching slot minimum (one in each channel) for dual channel operation. It has been my understanding that adding a third module to a typical four slot motherboard may eliminate dual channel mode if all modules have the same density. Thus, the dual channel benefit is lost. An example is if you populate the two slots of the channel A with 256MB modules (totaling 512MB), but only put a 256MB module in either slot of channel B. In that case, channel A has a total of 512MB and channel B has a non matching total of 256MB. Intel's explanation: http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/cs-011965.htm * * * * * Adding a fourth module to a dual channel capable motherboard may cause the memory to clock down in speed. Dual channel mode is still realized, but the dual channel benefit is lost. Dual channel bandwidth increase of up to 10% http://www.crucial.com/kb/answer.asp?qid=3751 - versus - Memory clock speed loss of more than 10% when slowing from 400MHz to 333MHz as a result of having all four slots populated. While those percentages are not &quot;overall speed&quot; indicators, they do give an indication of something lost for something gained.

I currently have two 512MB sticks( PC3200 ) in my system. It's a P4. I want to upgrade to 2GB of memory. Any performace differences between having four 512 MB sticks vs two 1GB sticks? Of course two 1GB sticks are more expensive, but my friend's computer uses the same type of memory so I'd figure I'd sell him my two 512MB sticks if I went that route to offset some the extra cost. Of course if the two 1 GB sticks don't offer any benefit then I just get 2 extra 512 MB sticks.

That's why I'm posting. Why would the motherboard make a differnce? One way is either better than the other or they are the same.
12339	12	221604	2356734	2356719	R. Proffitt	12/26/06 7:50 AM	1.1671194E12	The motherboard makes all the difference. But today...	Less sticks have always been more reliable. Here's why. Said sticks used to be right on the same memory bus. The bus loading (capacitance mainly) would slow the memory access down and we would see a machine with all slots full cough and BSOD where the same machine with just the pair would do fine. -&gt; Let's bottomline this. With all the hardware variations out there and I didn't catch what motherboard this was, only a benchmark may reveal what difference the stick pairs, full load of sticks and such would be faster. But even then we are only talking in the 2 and under percent range unless such disabled dual channel. There is no gain to be found here for 99.99% of the machines. There is also no way to research if such a test was done unless you reveal the full machine details. Bob

MBs can be sensitive to working at all with 4 DIMMs of the same density from the same mfg or working at the 'design speed' with all 4 DIMM slots populated. I've seen two MBs personally where DDR400 drops from 400MHz to 333MHz when you go from 2 DIMMs to 4 DIMMs. I decided the best approach for me (on an ASUS Socket 939 MB) was to use 2-1GB DIMMS vice 4-512MB DIMMs. And as Bob indicated...assuming you get the both combinations working at the design speed ... say 4-512MBs @ DDR400 running at 400MHz and 2-1GB DIMMs at 400MHz, it will be difficult to 'see or notice' the difference without using a benchmark. The trick for you will be getting the 4 DIMMs working at design speed in your system..that depends on the MB. It wasn't so long ago when it was difficult to find a MB that would work at all with 4 DIMM slots populated. VAPCMD
