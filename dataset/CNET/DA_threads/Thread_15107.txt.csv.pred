1.1.1	If a game requires a 500mhz system.	St
1.1.2	What is that equal to on the AMD level?	St
1.2.1	I'd say 500MHz.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	2200?	St
1.4.1	That you have an AMD 2200 and the game's minimum requirement is 500 MHz.	St
1.4.2	Since you exceed that requirement, it's unlikely that will be an issue.	St
1.4.3	If you have an issue, start a new thread with all the gory details since in no uncertain words, this issue is not it.	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
