i run a wireless home network using a belkin g router.
i've set the pc/xppro connected to the router to share a directory and a printer.
the old pentium3 client was able to see the shares just fine.
on my new macbook pro / xppro, however, i get an error when trying to access the workgroup.
a generic error only: &quot;not accessible... might not have permissions... contact administrator...&quot;.
the mac is able to connect to the internet via the wireless router.
i found a link which says it may be norton anti-virus's fault (  ), but the error or the registry entry referred to there don't exist on my host.
how can i find out why it's not accessible, and then to go about fixing it?
thanx, nir
