The thing I'm really concerned about is any disconnection problems - if the connection happens to drop for some reason, I would hope that it would be able to reconnect itself rather than having to manually plug it back in. I know the TPL-406E2K has a high editor's review on here, but the TL-PA4010 has more reviews on Amazon with a higher percentage of favorable reviews. It's hard to find any other sources of reviews on the latter though. Any guidance about either would be greatly appreciated.

That issue will dog powerline use for the current and future users. As they document that, I'll just note it and nod that all seem fine if they are on the same AC side. Bob

I've never had a problem with disconnections. The link was always solid. Just remember to plug it directly into the wall and not into a surge protector or power strip. Surge protectors will interfere with these devices, and you will very likely have issues if you don't plug it directly to the wall outlet. TP Link and Trendnet are both trustworthy to me; I own networking gear from both companies. I would recommend just relying on the reviews and be sure to purchase from a place with a good return policy should anything not work correctly.

These have an integrated AC socket which is infact filtered so as to ensure proper powerline-network throughput. As well, you don't forfeit an AC outlet just because you are using it for your powerline adaptor. In a few markets, most notably UK and Europe at the moment, there are powerboards that have integrated powerline-adaptor functionality thus providing the functionality of both devices in one box.
