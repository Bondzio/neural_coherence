i am a non smoker and my house is heated with electricity.
i do not leave my computer on 24/7, so i find that once a year is plenty.
i also have two 80mm exhaust fans and one 80mm intake fan that do a great jub of cooling down inside of my 30 inch tall tower.
i have serviced computer in houses of smokers and advise them to open their case and clean out dust at least once every two months.
your environment is probably the most important factor in the frequency of cleaning.
fireplaces, coal or wood stoves, forced hot air heat, living in a dusty neighborhood, smoking, or just an old dirty house will increase the amount of airborn dust and therefore the need to clean your computer more frequently.
some heatsinks are more prone to hold dust than others so you have to look closely at that factor also.
air intake filters help to reduce the dust that gets inside your computer but they also reduce the the cool air that passes through your computer the three case fans in my tower assure that dust does not move slowly through my tower.
heat is your computers worst enemy so keep the air moving through and make sure that it is cooling your processor and your video processor.
plugged heatsinks just don't cool as well.
