My goal is to be able to unhook the laptop and use it wireless when needed. I have a wireless network going now and it works like a charm. The problem is when I unhook, the network goes down. I do not plan to have a PC wired to the router at all times. My understanding is that this is not needed. Cable is hooked to modem, modem is wired to the router, and the network cable is wired to the docking station. I do not think I even need the connection to the docking station, but right now that is how it is set up. I guess my question would be - can I run this router to just route the network signal and not have it set up as an access point or a permanent connection? Is this not possible? Thanks for any advice you have.

Unplug the wired cable and use the wireless connection. Use the docking station as usual, but connect wireless. &quot;Going down&quot; is a common issue when switching from wired to wireless, as in unplugging from a wired docking station. Fixable by rebooting the laptop. Sooooo, just set up the wireless and remove the Ethernet cable from the docking station. Run wireless all the time.
