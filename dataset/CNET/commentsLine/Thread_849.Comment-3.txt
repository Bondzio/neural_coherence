quite frankly nothing is safe in this pc world.
you have to realize that the possibility always exists of a failure is around the bend.
your best option is to store on dvds or cds and make at least 2 copies of the same data/material/files you deem precious.
you can then use any ext.
hd you like and no, i wouldn't recommend any brand because they all have proven to come-up with some issue sooner or later.
the most important part is &quot;handling&quot; of the ext.
hd, treat it like eggs, regardless of any robust features.
flash drives have gotten bigger, so you can store those &quot;real precious files&quot; as yet another storage area, but only within a time frame you feel comfortable with and then burn to dvd/cd -or- not and just fill it and get another one.
do, what makes you get into the habit of back-up and ease of storage.
remember, if anyhing multiple copies of your data and prove it works, retrieve/verify data.
too often users forget this important step and stumble when their copies aren't working.
