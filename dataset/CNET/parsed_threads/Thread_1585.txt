<s> After upgrading my laptop's operating system, the computer seemed in good order. </s>
<s> Our technician left system running overnight to run through various sequences to validate proper operation. </s>
<s> In the morning system had crashed with the harddrive mechanically 'stuck'. </s>
<s> The drive seems mechanically 'damaged' and refuses to spin on this and also other machines in our lab. </s>
<s> What (if any) can I do to recover data at reasonable cost. </s>
<s> HELP!! </s>
<s> Thanks, </s>
<s> Look up DRIVESAVERS and ONTRACK with http://www.google.com Everyone seems to learn about backup of what they can't lose this way. </s>
<s> CDR drives and disks are pretty cheap and if you can support a DVD recorder, a 4.7GB R/W media is 2 bucks and the drive is 79 to 199 bucks. </s>
<s> Which will be less than your recovery costs. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
