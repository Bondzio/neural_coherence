&quot;In the meantime, pull the cover off and make sure the CPU heatsink is in place and all fans are spinning...&quot; Ok, what is the heatsink?
I know where the fan is and can check that.
BTW, could I use hardware like CD-RW drive, floppy drive, etc in my new machine.
Or are they damaged?
Thank you for helping me out.
