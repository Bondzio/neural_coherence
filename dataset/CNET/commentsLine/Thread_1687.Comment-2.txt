yes, this can be costly.
but in most cases, if a desktop, repair can be just the motherboard and/or cpu.
the reason why an incorrectly inserted board or part can fry components is simple.
power is on some of the pins and the partial/incorrectly inserted part can send power to pins that can't take power.
a tactical error on your part is to run defrag on a possibly damaged machine.
this is a great test of the hardware, but can result in a scrambled hard disk.
installing the os can outstrip most user skills.
best of luck in your repairs.
