<s> i do not have a disc or back up for os and would like to erase everything but the os. </s>
<s> I've seen claims that it can be done but all the software that claimed such has always been associated with scams or worse. </s>
<s> Maybe we can replace this OS? </s>

<s> I don't know which OS you have but, your query isn't going to be done if at all. </s>
<s> Plainly put, it just doesn't work well or results are lackluster. </s>
<s> Don't fall for any s/w that claims this, I really can't recommend anything such as you want. </s>
<s> You could however make or create recovery discs if you have Vista or Win7, the process is present to do this. </s>
<s> If you have XP, this is more complicated and generally I wouldn't say it really does it from MS sources. </s>
<s> Any windoze OS can be safely back-up or generate an image in order to make a back-up which would be a restore/recovery of current setup. </s>
<s> Google for back-up process and s/w that provides this. </s>
<s> However, you can buy or replace your OS if you have OEM or DIY type system. </s>
<s> An OEM is any system build by the likes of Dell, Gateway, etc., contact them as possible source or restore/recovery discs for some cost. </s>
<s> There are s/w services which provide replacement discs for OEM type PCs. </s>
<s> You can of course buy original or full retail type OS from online *trusted* vendors or use eBay, Craigslist or local shops. </s>
<s> Below is a source of OS generic or DIY type OS installs: http://www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory.aspx?SubCategory=368&name=Operating-Systems Google away for other vendors. </s>
