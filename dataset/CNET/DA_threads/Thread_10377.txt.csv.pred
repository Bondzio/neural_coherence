1.1.1	I salvaged the hard drive from my crashed laptop, put it in a USB2-powered case and was up and running with it as an external drive.	St
1.1.2	Unfortunately, the USB cable became disconnected during a file transfer, and since then neither of my other machines will recognize the external drive.	St
1.1.3	I understand this kind of disconnect can damage the drive or at least the data on it, and I think I've ruled out everything else that might be causing the lack of recognition.	St
1.1.4	Going through the My Compute/Manage menu in Windows, I can see the drive and when I click on it I get a ''Device Cannot Start/Code 10.''	St
1.1.5	I'd like to salvage what I can off the drive.	St
1.1.6	Failing that, I'm willing to reformat, but I don't see how I can get at it to even do that.	St
1.1.7	TIA for any help or suggestions.	Ques
1.2.1	problems posted there.	St
1.2.2	VAPCMD	St
