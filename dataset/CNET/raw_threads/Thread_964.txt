The opening screen on bootup shows the processor and says 2 cores. Xp home only shows a single screen for cpu under task manager, performance. Using the cpuz program shows only one core. I installed the hotfix 896256, edited the registry, and added /usepmtimer to boot.ini. I also uninstalled the processor from device manager and rebooted. I see from reading the web that xp home should support dual core.

The BIOS still reports dual but Windows doesn't. Hint? Take the BIOS defaults. Also another owner had replaced the motherboard but needed to change the HAL. Here's an example how that's done. -&gt; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309283 Which HAL are you loading? Bob

Also if this fails it could be a BIOS or motherboard fault. Time to ask them about that. I'm taking it that you have never tinkered with the Task Manager or other settings or had a virus/trojan damage the OS. Bob
