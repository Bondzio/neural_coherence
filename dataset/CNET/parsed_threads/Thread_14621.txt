<s> I am in the market to replace my laptop, which I have not liked from the get go. </s>
<s> I have had it for two years. </s>
<s> The reason I went to a laptop was space, but I use it like a desktop. </s>
<s> I don't transport it places. </s>
<s> I use it in my kitchen at my desk. </s>
<s> I primarily use it for digital pictures, Outlook managing of schedules, email and internet searching. </s>
<s> I currently own a Winbook basic laptop. </s>
<s> It shuts down frequently with overheating and has done this since about a year after I purchased. </s>
<s> My question: I looked at the iMac MA1999LL; Intel Core Duo Processor(1.83GHz)512mb DDR2-667 RAM;160GB 7,200RPM Serial ATA Hard Drive; 8x SuperDrive 2.4x Double Layer DVD RW Drive; ATI RADEON X1600 Graphics Chipset; 10/100/1000 Gigabit Network Adapter;Wireless Extreme Adapter; 17&quot; screen;MAC OS X 10.4 &quot;Tiger&quot; AND the HP/Pavilion Slimline s7530n; Intel Pentium M Processor 735A (1.7GHz); 1GB DDR2-400 RAM; 250GB 7,200RPM Serial ATA Hard Drive; LightScribe Double Layer 16 DVD RW Drive; Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 900 Video Chipset; 10/100 Network Adapter; Built-In 802.11b/g 54Mbps Wireless Network Adapter; 56K Modem, Microsoft Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005. </s>
<s> My question: I have never had a MAC, but it appealed to me with the all in one concept for a desktop (space is an issue). </s>
<s> However, I have always used a computer with some type of Windows OS on it. </s>
<s> How easy is it to convert over to MAC (I used Windows XP Office Student Edition) and what are the negatives and positives. </s>
<s> I have been told that the MAC OS does not have as many issues with sypware and viruses that the Windows XP OS system does. </s>
<s> I believe some of that since we have had those issues with both of the computers we have. </s>
<s> Your thoughts and recommendations. </s>
<s> Another thought is to go to another laptop, but again I do use this computer like a desktop; it is on all the time. </s>
<s> I wonder how it's used since laptops are often misused today such as putting it on some soft surface (blocks airflow) or it's the owner that selected a desktop CPU in a notebook form. </s>
<s> The lesson about Pentium 4 notebooks seems to be neverending. </s>
<s> Given the notebook issue, the same problems may follow to the next machine unless we discover what went wrong. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You're not alone in your thinking, recent changes by Apple to Intel processors has opened the thinking of many. </s>
<s> Personally, I like the Mac as well; it's sexy, all in one, etc. </s>
<s> But I have to remind myself the gains you get from a Mac are from the software, not the hardware. </s>
<s> So why buy equipment built to run it's own software and install Windows taking you right back to where you came from? </s>
<s> With that being said, imagine yourself on the phone with tech support about a software conflict and you expain your running Win XP on a Mac and getting errors using their product? </s>
<s> I suspect you'll get a long pause and the traditional ''We cannot support that configuration!'' </s>
<s> So, I ask you ''is the climb worth the view? </s>
<s> For my money stay with the Windows product if that is the enviroment you're be working and make sure the new hardware will support Vista when it arrives! </s>
<s> I own an HP Slimline, and couldn't be happoer with it. </s>
<s> It's small, powerful, and fits well on my desk, which is pretty small. </s>
<s> I haven't had a single problem, or lack of power with the system in the time I've owned it. </s>
<s> One of the best computers out there, in my view. </s>
<s> As for the Mac, bleh. </s>
<s> Macs, in my view, aren't very user friendly, which I'm reminded of from my many times spent fighting with the ones at my school. </s>
<s> The HP Slimline is the better choice. </s>
<s> If you go with it, you wont be sorry. </s>
<s> I would buy a mac. </s>
<s> Don't mess around with the hp labtop. </s>
<s> I think the new mac book will work just fine. </s>
<s> The mac book can also run windows, but I would buy the new OS (the Leopard ox operating system. </s>
<s> Look, we all know mac is better. </s>
<s> It is a lot better than any pc on the market. </s>
<s> First of all, a pc desktop comes with a 4-ton box and a crappy os. </s>
<s> Mac is faster, sleeker and more user friendly than a pc. </s>
<s> Hp is a good laptop, but even now, the only thing making it a good laptop is the fact that it is using mac's technology. </s>
<s> As soon as mac made a new design in keyboards (bigger keys, backlights and spacing) Hp did(about a month later.) </s>
<s> Mac is better in just about every way. </s>
<s> (and don't get me started on how mac doesn't crash or get viruses and windows do.) </s>
