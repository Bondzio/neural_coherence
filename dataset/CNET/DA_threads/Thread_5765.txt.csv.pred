1.1.1	Just got a My Book Essential 1.5 TB HD A few things I want to ask : - How exactly do I add files / folders *manually* ?	Ques
1.1.2	- I read online that seemed to strongly advise you do Not add or use the WD Smartware .	St
1.1.3	Ok .	St
1.1.4	Already installed & used it .	St
1.1.5	What have I done or what 's in store for me now ?	Ques
1.1.6	What to do from here ?	Ques
1.1.7	- How exactly do I double check that what *appears* to be backed up in the HD is Really there ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks for any help .	St
1.2.1	Let 's be 100 % clear here , *ANY* ext .	St
1.2.2	HD storage is NOT permanent , so take heed and save critical data to discs .	St
1.2.3	If super critical , then make multiple copies .	St
1.2.4	Next , treat your ext .	St
1.2.5	HD like eggs just to cover it should be treated well .	St
1.2.6	No matter how they advertise it , HDs still have moving parts , etc .	St
1.2.7	and damage can be done one way or another .	St
1.2.8	Mount and dismount using the proper procedure , do n't just disconnect , even though you may have done this many times before , it can bite you .	St
1.2.9	Oh yeah , power issues , be sure to take care of that , remember , most ext .	St
1.2.10	HD need low voltage to run , so spikes are n't good .	St
1.2.11	Last , treat the ext .	St
1.2.12	media like any other media storage .	St
1.2.13	That 's all it is another area to store media .	St
1.2.14	While you want this as back-up or similar , use what came with it , it works .	St
1.2.15	However , if manual , then again the user need only make a folder or directory or even partition it and use that storage .	St
1.2.16	Do this as if it were like an int .	St
1.2.17	HD , same-o same-o , like you 've done before , that ext .	St
1.2.18	HD , is drive ? ? ? .	Ques
1.2.19	You can check shareware s/w or freebies , check out GoodSync as an example .	St
1.2.20	The www.download.con here is a good source among others .	St
1.2.21	tada -- -- -- Willy	St
1.3.1	I 'm definitely very careful about handling these things .	St
1.3.2	This is my 2nd ext .	St
1.3.3	hd .	St
1.3.4	From what I was able to see/try on this new one , I ca n't see where in the WD screen that I can do any folder creation or dragging .	St
1.3.5	I 'll have another look .	St
1.3.6	You familiar with these particular models ?	Ques
1.3.7	( 'cause the official WD forum is slow as molasses )	St
1.4.1	The real quick and dirty way is to have the source and destination both displayed .	St
1.4.2	You create the folder or directory you want on the new drive .	St
1.4.3	You click on it and menu pops-up make & quot ; new & quot ; etc.. Once done , you click on your source data and click and drag to new location you just made -OR- drag to open area of desktop then drag from there to new final location .	St
1.4.4	http : //www.lightroomforums.net/showthread.php ? 15567-Exporting-Folders-into-new-External-Hard-Drive- ( without-photos ) The above link seems to cover much of any PC would need to do .	St
1.4.5	It offers to use & quot ; sync s/w & quot ; as well .	St
1.4.6	This maybe all trial and error , so you may want to play with this using less important files/folders , etc. , before you do the big move .	St
1.4.7	I suggest some dummy .DOC file or less important one .	St
1.4.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	What I ended up doing ( & I should 've thought of it way earlier ) , was go to My Computer , click & open the WD hd icon & simply dragged/dropped from there .	St
1.5.2	I went back into WD & everything seemed to be in place where I put it .	St
1.5.3	I definitely want to save my music in at least 3 separate places , on cd etc , but it 's a real pain since I have a good 30+ GBs of music .	St
1.5.4	Even if I used DVDs , it 'd still take several disks to do that .	St
1.5.5	=/	St
1.6.1	I know that it 's a PITA to do all this copying and several at that .	St
1.6.2	BUT !	St
1.6.3	if you check this forum all those users that ask for advise in helping recover data or steps to save from further damage , yada , yada , it 's something you have to accept .	St
1.6.4	It 's the nature of beast , frequent back-up or syncs to store data in several places .	St
1.6.5	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.7.1	I just got ta bite the bullet & do it .	St
1.7.2	Thanks a bunch for your time & advice .	Polite
1.7.3	You were an enormous help .	St
