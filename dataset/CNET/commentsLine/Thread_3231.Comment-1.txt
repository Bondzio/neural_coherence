i'm a bit confused for the moment.
my mobo manual says clearly that it &quot;supports 754-pin socket for amd athlon 64 processors...&quot; however, the amd site, when referring to the cpu installed, calls it a &quot;amd athlon 64 3000+ (socket 939).&quot; is there a typo or is there a problem?
thanks rob
