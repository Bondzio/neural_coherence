1.4.1	I demo 'd this for years for new IT staffers that would announce they secured our PCs or locked them down .	St

1.4.3	Leaving no trace we would leave .	St
1.4.4	I think we are going to repeat prior discussions about PC security and that physical access means I have full access to that PC , HD contents and more .	St
