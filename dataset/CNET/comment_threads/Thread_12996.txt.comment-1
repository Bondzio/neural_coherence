I was accessing my home LAN on my notebook computer.
Something happened and as I tried to connect to the network I got an error message saying &quot;it can't access the network and that I may not have permission and may need to contact the administrator.&quot; It was working fine before and I'm sure I didn't do anything to change permission.
What does this mean and how do I go about connecting to the network?
Also, on the laptop I see the other computers in Network Neighborhoon but I don't see the laptop when using the other computers.
I have never done anything do &quot;add&quot; the laptop, perhaps that's the problem.
Thanks for your help.
