I know their are sites that do this for you but I dont want to do it this way. What I want to do is somehow connect directly to my PC at home by somehow opening a webpage and signing in. I realise their are a lot of security issues to this. Also when I am at work they have a proxy that prevents me from accessing certain sites. Is their anyway I can get past this by somehow connecting through my computer at home and using my internet connection? Is this trackable by the system admin at my work if I did do something like this? Any links with info etc would be appreciated. Chris

Check the forum policies. As to remote access there are a few solutions like TIGHTVNC but I strongly suggest you never risk your job over internet use. Bob
