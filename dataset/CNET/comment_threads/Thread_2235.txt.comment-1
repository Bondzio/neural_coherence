http://secure.newegg.com/NewVersion/wishlist/PublicWishDetail.asp?WishListNumber=5317466 The only parts I am not sure about are the motherboard and the power supply.
I don't know if thats enough for all that stuff.
also, on the motherboard I doubt I am ever going to do SLI for an 8800. and I am also only going to have one (maybe one more) SATA hard drive in there and one older hard drive.
I do know that I plan on having this computer a while though so should I go for a good mobo like that or does it not matter?
thanks in advance guys.
