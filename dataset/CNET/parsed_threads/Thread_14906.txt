<s> I'm trying to stream iTunes from my desktop PC over my wireless network to my stereo connected to Apple AirPort Express. </s>
<s> However, I can't get it to work. </s>
<s> The AirPort Admin Utility that came with AirPort Express is no help. </s>
<s> Does anyone know how to link AirPort Express to a Windows wireless network? </s>
<s> try to disable dhcp, and fill in your main router ip, gateway, dns etc. </s>
<s> Did you enable Music/Itunes feature (on your airport express)? </s>
<s> First I updated my AirPort Express firmware and then I was able to switch the mode to client. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
