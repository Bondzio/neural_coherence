I'm guessing more than one speaker channel is encoded on a line and it is separated within the speaker system or receiver. Well I'm pretty sure a speaker set for PCs could do it, not sure about a receiver.

One channel with have front L/R, another will have rear L/R, and the third will have center. The speaker system I guess will then decide what goes to the sub and what finally goes to the speakers.
