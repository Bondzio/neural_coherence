<s> Hi, I have visited many forums and see this issue but no answers/fixxes. </s>
<s> The problem is when the monitor tried to display older games or visuals that dont meet the native resolution. </s>
<s> The monitor decides to go into a safe mode with a box pop up saying &quot;Not Optimized Mode&quot;. </s>
<s> There has to be a way around this. </s>
<s> From what i have read people are bashing samsung for this on UTube and other forums. </s>
<s> I have a samsung TV and 2 Pc Monitors and love them all. </s>
<s> Please help me fix this problem and make the fix public so the bashing may be stopped. </s>
<s> The game i am trying to play is Warcraft 3 Frozen Throne, but im positive it has nothing to do with the game as there are many posts of other games doing the same thing. </s>
<s> It seems to be any older game that dosent utalize the higher resolutions that the monitor is trying to force. </s>
<s> Samsung SyncMaster 2233, Radeon Hd 4870 1Gb, 4 Gig Ram, Drivers all up to date. </s>
<s> Try the OVERRIDE setting in DXDIAG. </s>
<s> Put it at 60. </s>
<s> Given the lack of details and you may want to bash I'll share a fix I used. </s>
<s> Good luck, Bob </s>
<s> I have windows vista, dont see an override option available in the dxdiag tool. </s>
<s> it is set at 60 hertz though. </s>
<s> i even tried forcing the 60 hertz function in ati catalist control center, no luck. </s>
<s> when i open the game, it still tries to run at 75 hertz and says not optimum setting and goes into standby mode. </s>
<s> Almost all LCDs require 60Hz. </s>
<s> Some call that a flaw. </s>
<s> Ask ATI how to keep the card at 60Hz. </s>
<s> Above i stated the game was trying to run @ 75 hertz, this was wrong. </s>
<s> Think im reading to many forums and getting burned out. </s>
<s> It says(&quot;Not Optimum Mode, Recommended Mode: 1920 X 1080 @ 60 hertz). </s>
<s> The games highest setting is 1280 X 1024. </s>
<s> This is where the problem is i think. </s>
<s> The monitor wants the game run @ 1920 X 1080, which it cannot do. </s>
<s> I have posted to Samsung support but have received no reply as of yet. </s>
<s> But give errors when the refresh rate is wrong. </s>
<s> The good thing we did here was to move connections to HDMI. </s>
<s> Do you use HDMI? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I went through all the diff rez settings and the game was happy with 1280X960X32 @ 60 hertz. </s>
<s> So i guess the fix is to play with the rez settings till you find something the monitor is happy with. </s>
<s> OK works for me, i will try to spread the word. </s>
<s> TyVm for the help. </s>
<s> &quot;1680 x 1050 resolutions,&quot; I wonder if ATI's 1280x1024 is not exactly kosher. </s>
<s> To recap. </s>
<s> Must be 60Hz for all settings and watch out on the second number. </s>
<s> -&gt; All this vanished as an issue over HDMI or even DVI to HDMI connections. </s>
<s> Ever since I changed that my kid has yet to ask me to set the resolutions. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I was having this problem, setting the resolution to 1920x1080 60 hertz, and I just found the solution. </s>
<s> You have to (on the monitor itself) hit the MENU button, and scroll down to the second from the bottom. </s>
<s> Hit SOURCE to select it, the hit the down button until the options become AV mode and HDMI Black Level. </s>
<s> Go to AV mode and hit Source to select it. </s>
<s> Now press up or down to change the setting to OFF. </s>
<s> Exit the menu. </s>
<s> As long as AV mode is off, the monitor will display perfectly. </s>
<s> If the color looks strange, change HDMI Black Level to Normal instead of the default LOW as well. </s>
