I cannot run my webcam, and watch videos online or even offline with videos in my folders at the same time, I used to but my computer guy has done work but the only thing he switched was my motherboard. What would I need to upgrade, or what else could the problem be because it was never slow before.

I hope you understand that without details you won't get good answers or any. As to the windows install, knowing about the install, the drivers used and other software matters. For example, some may install a toxic combination.
