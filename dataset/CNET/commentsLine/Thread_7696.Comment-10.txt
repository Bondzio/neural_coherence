i too am in the market for a pc (gaming) and read anything i can find about advice on pc purchase.
i must say your reply was very clear and logical and most of all usefull for anyone in the market for new pc.
i've been trying to learn as much as possible about &quot;futureproofing a pc&quot;.
i've narrowed down my system to a gateway 530 configured like this qx6700 extreme quad core overclocked to 3.2, 4mb ram, 2x250 7200rpm raid 0 hard drives, vista ultimate and will wait till they offer 8800 series gpu card (promised soon).
what is your opion on this configuration?
i want to not have to upgrade in 6mo or a yr. and want to be ready for direct x10 and quad core designed games, hoping that will happen as predicted by many online sites.
