let us know how it turns out.
--&gt; network uptime is one thing.
wifi reliability however is an entirely different problem and as long as it's non-proprietary (i.e.
common wifi) then you can't give any assurances.
all it takes is a bad or rogue device.
bob ps.
you didn't write about the channel problems.
here's a link showing we only get 2 non-overlapping 802.11n channels.
pps.
the wikipedia has changed to show grinding it even more finely but you get 2 for most setups and just one channel on 802.11n with the 40mhz option.
