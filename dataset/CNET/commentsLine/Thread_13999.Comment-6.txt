it's the 780g chip version, and update from the 690g version.
have an rma number i had to obtain by phone since for some reason their emails about it, if sent, aren't reaching me, although strangely others they sent earlier did.
hoping i don't mail this back for an exchange and never hear from them again after doing so.
i'll let this thread know the resolution of it.
