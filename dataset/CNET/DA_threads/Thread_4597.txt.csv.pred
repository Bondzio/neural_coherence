1.1.1	Hi, I have a Dell Dimension 3000 that I want to upgrade.	St
1.1.2	It has two 256 mb sticks in it now.	St
1.1.3	Can I put a single 1 gig stick in, and when I can afford the second put that in then?	St
1.1.4	Running XP home, 3.0 pentium 4 with HT.	St
1.1.5	Thanks Rick Davis	St
1.2.1	Your computer does not require both slots be used, so you can safely run it using the 1GB and add a second GB down the road.	St
1.2.2	For that matter, you can insert the new 1GB module in one slot and leave one of the 256MB modules in the second slot until you purchase a new 1GB stick.	St
1.2.3	Hope this helps, John	St
1.3.1	Keep that dual channel feature in mind.	St
1.3.2	512MB@dual channel vs 1GB@single channel.	St
1.3.3	Speed vs capacity.	St
1.3.4	In the future when you go for a second 1GB stick you might have to get a close match to get this feature to work.	St
1.4.1	memory architecture system so a new 1GB plus one of the 256MBs should work just fine provided you buy the right 1GB DIMM.	St
1.4.2	Later you could add another 1GB DIMM if desired.	Sug

1.5.1	I appreciate the help!	Polite
1.5.2	Makes more sense to buy a single stick of 1 gig now, then upgrade to two as money permits.And I will keep that single channel vs dual in mind.	St
1.5.3	To be safe I will get the identical stick down the line.	St
1.5.4	I appreciate your help!	Polite
1.5.5	Thanks Rick Davis	St
