<s> Hello, I have built a new computer and tried to format the HD with WD disk v11.3 when I receive this message. </s>
<s> I thought it was the HD so I have tried a 2nd with the same results. </s>
<s> ANY info. </s>
<s> would be great, my system spec's below. </s>

<s> Remember I won't duplicate ideas you find at http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22Cannot+Load+Dos%22&btnG=Google+Search so given your new hardware can you tell what does load? </s>
<s> Also why would one format a drive before they tried to install Linux or Windows? </s>
<s> It's a great way to trip up an OS install. </s>
<s> Please tell. </s>

<s> Bob, thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> I did try to install XP first and got the following: OXOOOOOO7B (OXF78DA63C, 0XC0000034, 0X00000000, 0X00000000) I then was going to use the Western Digital disc and partition/format and now get the messagE CANNOT LOAD DOS. </s>
<s> Any ideas to fix would be great. </s>
<s> Thanks Tom </s>
<s> Except on some boards that let you fake the SATA into an IDE drive. </s>
<s> Not only that but 500GB is far beyond XP and DOS. </s>
<s> We didn't get over 127GB support in XP till XP SP1 and then you discover the SATA drivers may fail if you don't use the XP SP2 CD. </s>
<s> So let's sum this up for how to install XP. </s>
<s> Remember I will not duplicate web content about this but give the quick version. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Boot the XP SP2 CD. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Tap F6 and slip in the SATA driver diskette. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Partition and let XP SP2 do the format. </s>
<s> Anything different about your install? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Bob, thanks again, I got a little farther and I did have an SP2 version to try, but when it asks for the driver it only wants it from a floppy drive, which on the DP35DP MB, I don't have. </s>
<s> I can install an EIDE drive and load windows on it, then install the 500GB SATA drive and partition etc? </s>
<s> More help would be great. </s>
<s> Thanks Tom </s>
<s> I have an USB FLOPPY DRIVE I carry just for such installs. </s>
<s> The issue of the needed floppy is well documented on many sites. </s>
<s> Here's the words to find the answers on google.com HOW TO INSTALL XP TO A SATA HARD DISK. </s>
<s> When you read a few of those you see answers from &quot;get the drive&quot; to &quot;slipstreaming SATA drivers.&quot; This is not a bug in XP but just signs of aging. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> this is a working computer (no problem booting up with a &quot;bootdisk&quot;)? </s>
<s> WD disk v11.3 is a floppy for setting up the harddrive? </s>
<s> All, Thanks much for your help, after reading ALL the problems with XP & SATA drives, I just loaded Vista and all went fine. </s>
<s> I will work on a way to load XP as well, but for now it is up and running. </s>
<s> Hard to believe MS doesn't have an easy fix, especialy when floppy drives are a thing of the past. </s>
<s> Thanks Again. </s>
