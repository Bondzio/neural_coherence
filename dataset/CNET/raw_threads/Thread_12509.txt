My dad bought me an iPad last month at best buy, but I dont like the rubber case that he purchased it with. Any of the girls or guys on the forum that can give a sense of direction on where I can find a leather ipad case? I went back to best buy, but they don't seem to have much of a collection for women. I also checked online for a women's case, but I am not convinced they are made of real leather. I welcome any person that has bought a case that they are happy with. Please post any pics or the brand, or where you bought your ipad case. Thanks everyone! have a merry Christmas.

It is very good & heavy but protect my iPad very well, I have dropped my iPad a few times on the hardwood floors no problem. When not in use I have a red &quot;Casecrown&quot; made to be used for netbooks but it fits just right & has a pocket, it has memory foam inside for added protection, unlike most out there. You have two options out there, cool looking but provides little to no real protection or dull & boring but protects. I picked option 2, I do not feel like shelling out another $800.

I have been surfing at Amazon and Overstock, and I had never seen such a deep assortment. Good review. Well I was impressed with the Incipio iPad case, however I wanted to see what other iPad cases were out there so I headed to Amazon and Overstock. I did find a impressive assortment of other brands like Otterbox, Incase, Mivizu, Belkin, Speck. I even found some real trendy brands like Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors, and Donna Karan and even Issey Miyake. While the assortment is deep and wide, I was still looking for a clean, sophisticated design with an elegant appeal to simplism. After review all the brands, I settled for Mivizu. The have great customer reviews, the product has well design and meaningful layout that serves it's us and purpose. I found an iPad case that delivered on all my requirements, including delivering a great value against some of the other competing brands. I do like, but I instead choose something a little more minimalist with clean contours and outlines. Here is what I have ordered in the meantime. http://www.amazon.com/Mivizu-iPad-Black-Leather-Folio/dp/B00422L39E/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qlEnable=1&qid=1294018021&sr=8-3-catcorr&searchContext=B00422L37G,B00422L376,B00422L39E
