<s> Well thanks, right now i've been pretty much hitting mine to get it to work. </s>
<s> Also the fans on my computer seems to be shutting off as well, does that have to do with the power supply that's going bad or is that a separate issue altogether? </s>
<s> And again I have to hit it a bit to get it to work. </s>
<s> as the fans have their own supply lead. </s>
<s> Bite the bullet and get a new one ASAP. </s>
<s> Besides, hitting it means there is a loose connection which causes extra resistance which causes heat which causes fire. </s>
<s> Don't mess with it, replace it. </s>
