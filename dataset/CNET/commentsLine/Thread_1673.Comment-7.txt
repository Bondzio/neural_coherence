thank you for the food for thought.
the reason i am having such trouble grasping it is because according to netgear, there product can support up to 8 simultaneous vpn tunnels.
so are you suggesting that i try using the existing tunnel to connect from the second place?
correct me if i'm wrong but shouldn't i be able to connect more then 1 vpn tunnel to one place?
or is that a myth like the great white elk?
lol background info:  those are the specs on the vpn router we are using to try and connect to.
