<s> He can't get a signal from 20 feet. </s>
<s> (1st floor ) R there any NEtbooks that have a better antenna , or I can see no reason to buy one , if u have to search for a closer hotspot ANY ADVICE? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Type Vista Broadcast Flag on any search engine to see why it matters. </s>
<s> Also test that netbook somewhere else. </s>
<s> Just so you know I picked up the usual Acer Aspire One and it's fine. </s>
<s> Mine runs XP and all I had to to was turn the wifi on. </s>

<s> involved includes the placement of the wireless router. </s>
<s> 1) if it's placed very near a wall, signal, even to a room just behind that wall, will be severally affected (As my brother had complained often) 2) The number of walls between the router and the room. </s>
<s> The more walls between, the faster it drops signal (more so if the wall has steel bars for structure) 3) Height of placement is also important. </s>
<s> Placing too low on the floor also can affect, likewise placing too high up. </s>
<s> 4) Power saving set on your wireless adapter and router. </s>
<s> that is 80 meters. </s>
<s> ts a msiu100. </s>
<s> Apologies if this seems obvious, but first step in trouble-shooting is to make sure it's turned on. </s>
<s> In my experience, troubleshooting often stops at this first step. </s>
