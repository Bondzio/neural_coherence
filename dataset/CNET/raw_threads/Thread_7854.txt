Unfortantly not much is out there, while coolers are simple, they do the job. Simply evalating the rear laptop case to expose to airflow is a plus. You can help keep it cooler by &quot;throtting down&quot; the cpu even when used as a safe bet, then throttle up when really required. good luck -----Willy

I tried the &quot;elevation option&quot;, which did reduce the frequency of the above problems but did not eliminate it. Then, in desperation I purchased a &quot;YL Notebook Cooler Pad&quot; (Model NB-02) from a supplier on E-bay for AUD 29 including postage. I'm overjoyed with the results ... Since then, I've not experienced one Blue Screen or shutdown. Additionally, the laptop seems to even funtion more quickly/efficiently when performing routine tasks. It's a truly amazing result and well worth the money spent.
