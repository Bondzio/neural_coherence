My laptop DVD-RW drive may be defective.
I can copy CD and burn home DVD movie to the hard drive but is unable to copy the home movie DVD into a DVD disc.
Although the message of Nero showed burn is successful, the copied DVD always changed to the CD drive in my computer.
So the DVD player or software is unable to open it.
Have you seen this type of problem after burning, the copied DVD disc has changed to the CD drive?
Is it DVD burner defective?
