External HD: Cavalry 500GB Started using: around early April Used: 120GB out of 500GB(would like to save if at all possible) A week ago, started to have the problem of not able to access the drive, with a warning message saying the drive is not accessible, and that the file or directory is corrupted and unreadable.
When I go to the Properties for the drive, it shows 0 byte for everything and format is shown as RAW.
Yesterday, I finally got around to try to fix it.
I first went to the Properties for the drive and tried to run check disk from there, the dialog window disappeared as soon as it started checking.
Then I went to the DOS prompt to use chkdsk /f /r from there, that actually worked.
It fixed a number of indexes as well as the MFT.
After that is complete, my correct volume is shown under properties again for this drive, and the format is back to NTFS.
But the weird part is none of the files and folders is showing up, even though it said I used up around 120GB of space.
Could anyone help me here?
