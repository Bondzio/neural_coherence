<s> I have a problem with my laptop that the screen freezes and i can't close it except by pressing the on/off button for a long time. </s>
<s> And sometimes it appears a blue screen with many letters and numbers and at the buttom &quot;Phyisical error&quot; and it restarts by itself then freezes. </s>
<s> When i open it again after a while it says &quot;Computer restarted after an unexpected shutdown. </s>
<s> WinXP detected a possible device failure. </s>
<s> The driver for the display device was unable to complete a drawing operation&quot; and says that ATI Mobility 128 AGP 2X (COMPAC) could be responsible. </s>
<s> I don't think it is a software problem cause the screen freezed with me when i was formating the laptop and when i was installing WinXP. </s>
<s> By the way, i bought the laptop years before and it is Compac Presario. </s>
<s> What shall i do? </s>
<s> SORRY for the long post. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Have you updated the video driver from the Compaq website? </s>
<s> It could be there is a new driver that takes care of this problem. </s>
<s> Sorry i am a begginer and i have a question. </s>
<s> When the screen feezed while my operating system was uninstalled (by formating) is an update issue?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> I agree, this does not sound like a software problem. </s>
<s> I'm hoping your laptop has a floppy drive, if so try this diagnostic software. </s>
<s> http://www.tufftest.com/tt01-lite.htm the lite version is available free and should give you an idea of any hardware problems. </s>
<s> Then you will know what you are facing. </s>
<s> If is a hardware problem; because you are a beginner and working on laptops is rather tricky, I think you have 2 choices based on the age/value of the laptop. </s>
<s> 1. take it to a professional repair facility. </s>
<s> 2. start shopping for a new laptop -- good news is that prices are lower than ever... My repair experience is with Dell laptops and it sounds like either a connection issue or a cracked/ heat-damaged motherboard or video card. </s>
<s> Depending on the model of your laptop, these can be really labor intensive to get to. </s>
<s> Remember even damaged laptops have value to someone, I've sold non-working laptops for parts on eBay. </s>
<s> So it's not a total loss if it can't be revived. </s>
<s> I'm sorry I can't give better advice, hopefully this helps to some small degree. </s>
