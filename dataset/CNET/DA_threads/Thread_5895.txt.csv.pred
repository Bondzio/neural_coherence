1.1.1	WE HAVE A IN HOME WIRELESS NETWORK USING A D-LINK DI-624 ROUTER (wireless G).	St
1.1.2	THE SIGNAL INTO OUR GAME ROOM IS TOO LOW TO RUN OUR XBOX360 LIVE.	St
1.1.3	IN THAT ROOM, WE HAVE ENOUGH OF A SIGNAL TO MAKE THE INTERNET CONNECTION BUT THE SIGNAL IS JUST TOO LOW TO RUN THE GAMES.	St
1.1.4	WHEN WE MOVE THE XBOX UP INTO THE SAME ROOM AS THE ROUTER, THERE'S NO PROBLEM.	St
1.1.5	MY FIRST OPTION IS NOT TO UPGRADE THE ROUTER AND HAVE TO REINSTALL NEW WIRELESS CARDS IN MY 3 CONNECTED COMPUTERS.	St
1.1.6	HOWEVER, I'VE READ SEVERAL POOR REVIEWS OF SIGNAL BOOSTERS.	St
1.1.7	ANY SUGGESTIONS?	St
1.1.8	THANKS	St
1.2.1	Raise the router above furniture level, relocate cordless phone, video sender etc away from computer or router.	St
1.2.2	Try changing channels -- the different frequencies they represent work better or worse in different environments.	St
1.2.3	If you detect neighbouring wifi, move to a channel at least 5 stops away.	St
1.3.1	Seems to be a good candidate for power line adapters.	St
1.3.2	A little pricey, but it's a good alternative if you absolutely don't want to run a wired connection to your XBox.	St
1.3.3	Netgear and DLink are a couple of manufacturers, but you may want to stick with DLink for compatibility.	St
