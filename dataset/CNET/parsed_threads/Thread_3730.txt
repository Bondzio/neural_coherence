<s> So I'm a college kid...I have a fairly basic Dell laptop. </s>
<s> I mostly use it for school work, and so over the years (I'm graduating soon) I've accumlulated quite a bit of data and information. </s>
<s> I also like to play games on it, but have hit a wall because I cannot install any new games because there is no more space on my internal hard drive. </s>
<s> Can I run/play games off of my external hard drive? </s>
<s> Meaning I would install the program files onto the hard drive. </s>
<s> I'm assuming there wouldn't be an issue but just though I'd check.... </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> what you cannot afford or prefer not to lose. </s>
<s> Once you've done that, then pursue the game initiative. </s>
<s> Gaming will put a lot of additional stress on your laptop so take the time to protect your data before you start. </s>
<s> Keep in mind data in only once place ... an internal hard drive or especially an external hard drive, it just a second away from complete, permanent loss. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS...Putting games on an external...you can. </s>
<s> Would I recommend it ..no ! </s>
<s> Why .... not matter where you install the app ... Windows apps will almost always put at least some files on your C: drive. </s>
<s> Perhaps you should consider getting a much larger hard drive for your laptop. </s>
