<s> Hello, I have Comcast internet and a DLink DIR-655 router. </s>
<s> I have a laptop, Playstation 3 and 2 Blackberrys hooked up on my wifi. </s>
<s> I also think my neighbor is using or trying ot use my wifi. </s>
<s> I need a software program or piece of hardware that will allow logging of the URL's that are requested through my router. </s>
<s> I currently use OpenDNS, and the service itself is pretty good. </s>
<s> However, it doesn't tell which user is requesting which URL, and if a website is visited with 10 ads on it, it also shows the URL's for the ad hosting company, even though they didn't actually type that URL in. </s>
<s> I know what a keylogger, browsing history, etc. </s>
<s> is but I want to know what URL's are being typed in by what user and I would prefer to have the URL name resolved other than just the IP address. </s>
<s> I have researched router logging by the actual router, but it seems as if the DIR-655 isn't very good at doing this. </s>
<s> I have also tried Wireshark and Wallwatcher, but they seem so difficult to use. </s>
<s> I would love to find a good software program that has a simple interface, that would allow me to turn off logging of certain devices, such as the PS3. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> But first all this is not easy stuff. </s>
<s> You will find folk that want easy but this area is not. </s>
<s> So look at the router and see if it supports sending information via SMNP and then look for a software that runs on the PC to collect that data. </s>
<s> Finally you'll have to set up how to filter all that data. </s>
<s> Many folk are unaware that this is going to be work on their part if they don't want to pay a few thousand for a solution in a can. </s>

<s> Is there a special place I need to look to find out if it does support SMNP? </s>
<s> Is there a piece of hardware that would do this rather than going through the software hassle? </s>
<s> I look at the router maker's documentation for this. </s>
<s> As to the hardware, there are some but then again we are back to things very expensive and you know there is software under the hood. </s>
<s> You may wonder why there is no SIMPLE to use software like this. </s>
<s> It's a very simple reason. </s>
<s> The support would cost more than folk will pay for. </s>
<s> That is, folk that can do this, use the free tools. </s>
<s> Those that want it often do not want to know how to configure it and then may grumble about the cost. </s>
<s> Sadly this means that no one has a simple system. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Do you know of a router that has good logging software? </s>
<s> My DLink has a logging option, but the options are lacking bad. </s>
<s> If I could find a good logging router, then I could use Wallwatcher or some other program that converts the IP's visited into URL's. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> And more if you get the software. </s>
<s> IP's are not URLs. </s>
<s> I guess you need an example. </s>
<s> http://support.microsoft.com/kb/190008 So now you see that an IP address does not prove a thing. </s>
