<s> Hi there, In my Apple MacBook 13 inch core2 Duo laptop, I have a small disc stuck in the drive. </s>
<s> I was going to read &quot;roughguide&quot; information provided by my travel agent to look at the maps and the rest. </s>
<s> It is on a 8cm disc, which says that it could be used in the Mac . </s>
<s> I inserted it in my MacBook's drive and hoped to succeed. </s>
<s> I did not. </s>
<s> It is in the slot, it does not engage in any contact and it does not come out whatever method I use. </s>
<s> It appears that I will have to open the case to reach the drive to get it out. </s>
<s> How do I go about it? </s>
<s> Help will be appreciated. </s>

<s> and get them to remove it. </s>
<s> Before you do that, shut down the laptop and remove the AC power cord. </s>
<s> With the CD slot facing down, shake the laptop and see if you can coax the disk into appearing enough for you to grab it with a pair of tweezers. </s>
<s> I would not recommend attempting to take this thing apart to get at the optical drive. </s>
<s> A quick glance at the instructions that came with your laptop would have told you that only regular sized CD/DVD disks can go into a Slot Loading optical drive. </s>

<s> Thank you P for your advice. </s>
<s> On this occasion I did not follow it . </s>
<s> I looked for information where ever I could find it . </s>
<s> I found it on the You Tube. </s>
<s> A clever gentleman had a whole lot of information on a lot of Apple laptops. </s>
<s> I just looked at his video/commentary a couple of times then left it. </s>
<s> Then I looked it at the website ifixit.com where I found step by step text with photographs. </s>
<s> I went through it a couple of times. </s>
<s> The end result was that I decided to do it myself. </s>
<s> I have not done a lot of computer work however I have been using them for more years than many. </s>
<s> There is no scare factor for me. </s>
<s> The only problem I have is that I forget the procedures of very familiar things if I am not using the procedure for a couple of months,it only happened in my early 70s, it is a few years since so I am used to it. </s>
<s> So I usually have to learn it afresh.My hands are steady and my brain usually works if a challenge is to be faced. </s>
<s> So I went through the video and the text with photographs. </s>
<s> I cleared my study table, in some places it had gathered some considerable dust, well the study desk clear and clean with a bed sheet for cover and a couple of screw drivers of the appropriate size I sat down to take on the job. </s>
<s> Yes ,there was a bit of apprehension as one would experience facing a new situation,but no fear of mortal danger , a foolhardy (silly) belief that I can handle it. </s>
<s> I had written the text notes on a piece of paper. </s>
<s> I went through it one by one. </s>
<s> Making sure that I put the small screws in some sensible order so that I do not forget to put them back in the right places. </s>
<s> One hour and twenty minutes I got the 3&quot; disc out and I am using the same computer to tell the tale.I guess if I have to do it again half an hour will be enough. </s>
<s> Thank you for being there, which gives me the confidence that I can seek help when stuck. </s>
<s> Yours Shafiq </s>
<s> I'm impressed. </s>
<s> It is a daunting proposition to take apart something as complex and compact as a laptop. </s>
<s> Well done, glad you have the offending disk extracted P </s>
