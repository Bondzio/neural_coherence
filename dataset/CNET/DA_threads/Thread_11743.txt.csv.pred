1.1.1	So I have a few 23 and 30-inch ACD 's dotted around my home office , but one 30-incher I just keep having problems with .	St
1.1.2	What it does is the entire display flickers off and on at random intervals - anything between 5 and less than 1 second .	St
1.1.3	If I unplug it from the power brick and plug it in again immediately , the problem goes away until the monitor is turned off .	St
1.1.4	And it does n't do it all the time .	St
1.1.5	It did it today , which is the first time in about three weeks .	St
1.1.6	It 's been away twice to Applecare , during which they could n't see anything wrong .	St
1.1.7	All devices in my home office are directly plugged in to a socket on APC switched PDU ' s which in turn are connected to a redundant APC Symmetra extended-runtime UPS .	St
1.1.8	Current draw , faulty socket , etc are not issues .	St
1.1.9	Power brick has been replaced - also tried bricks from other working monitors , to no change .	St
1.1.10	It struck me that today it was pretty cool in my home office now that I 've turned the heating totally off - no timer operation .	St
1.1.11	And having thought about it , the problem only started happening with noticeable effect in Octoberish if I remember correctly .	St
1.1.12	I do n't really see though how a few degrees can affect operation that much - especially as the monitor is absolutely fine once it has been unplugged from the brick and replugged ( literally replugged , not even a seconds ' delay ) , for the rest of the day .	St
1.1.13	The above is just a hunch though , I do n't really have anything .	St
1.1.14	Anyone else have a more concrete explanation to what 's happening ?	Ques
1.2.1	It 's not a display adapter / machine problem as it had the same issue when I had it attached to different Pros at home ( with FX5600 or 8800GT ) and in the past I was also able to replicate the problem by attaching it to a couple of my PC 's ( XPS 730H2C w/GTX280 , Dell Precision with FX5600 's ) .
