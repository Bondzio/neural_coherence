can't support the inrush and locked rotor currents at startup.
it will sometimes start after multiple tries because the capacitors got partially charged in the earlier tries and the charge has not bled off, thus the capacitor charging inrush is reduced enough to let the supply stay up.
the power supply has overcurrent protection circuits which shut down when too much currenbt is detected.
some new video cards have given some supplies problems with this.
