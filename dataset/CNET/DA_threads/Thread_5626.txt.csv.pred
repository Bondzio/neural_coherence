1.1.1	Presario 5000 Desktop , purchased in late 2000 .	St
1.1.2	1 GB processor , 128 mb ram,40 GB hard drive running Windows 2000 professional .	St
1.1.3	Floppy/CD/CD-DVD drives .	St
1.1.4	It came from Compaq with Windows ME which was unstable at best - I had assumed most of my locking issues were tied to ME , so I upgraded to Windows 2000 .	St
1.1.5	1 .	St
1.1.6	The computer will randomly not boot properly - it will ping the CD and DVD , miss the floppy , start the hard drive and then stall leaving a blank screen even though the hard drive LED is illuminates green , starts , then goes out .	St
1.1.7	If I start it repeatedly by turning the power button on , it will eventually boot up , or stall in the process .	St
1.1.8	2 .	St
1.1.9	Once operating after a succesful boot , the computer will lock randomly even when sitting idle at the desktop screen with no programs open .	St
1.1.10	It also locks randomly with open programs .	St
1.1.11	3 .	St
1.1.12	I notice that sometimes when it locks , the fan whine seems to slow and then come back up to speed .	St
1.1.13	4 .	St
1.1.14	I have to manually power it down by holding power button in , and restart with power button , only to experience problem number 1 , intermittent boot success .	St
1.1.15	Is there a known issue out there with the Presario desktops - could it be the power supply or CMOS battery , or is it likely software related ?	Ques
1.1.16	Help !	St
1.1.17	3 .	St
1.2.1	In loading W2K , did you also go to Compaq ( ne .	St
1.2.2	HP ) and download the latest drivers , especially BIOS for W2K .	St
1.2.3	If the W2K was not supplied by COMPAQ , you can not rely on Microsoft alone to support your system .	St
1.2.4	Just loading W2K and driver updates will not always do the trick .	St
1.2.5	My experience with Compaq Workstations , Armad laptops and a Presario or two .	St
1.2.6	I use W2K and have almost always had to get something from the Compaq/HP driver/software downloads .	St
1.3.1	Remove the case cover and see if the cooler air helps .	St
1.3.2	What they did n't tell you is that FANs blow air onto the heatsink and not unlike the LINT BASKET on a clothes dryer , it can build up an insulating blanket which causes the CPU to overheat .	St
1.3.3	Or the CPU FAN has failed ?	Ques
1.3.4	You need to look .	St
1.3.5	Bob	St
1.4.1	Fans are operating .	St
1.4.2	Case cover on or off - no difference in performance .	St
1.4.3	Processor , fan and heat sink are clean - removed lint and cleaned when the problem started .	St
1.5.1	It can change the response to ask to look in another direction .	St
1.5.2	For instance , tell what you do about PARASITES .	St
1.5.3	Light reading at http : //www.doxdesk.com/parasite/ Bob	St
1.6.1	Thanks Bob - Parasites are certainly a possibility and I did read the info you provided to another post .	St
1.6.2	I was experiencing hijacks on the web , etc .	St
1.6.3	but thought I had cleaned them well enough and protected my machine .	St
1.6.4	I now use Stopzilla as a pop up blocker which seems to work very well .	St
1.6.5	Could a parasite be causing random locks and improper boots repeatedly - and why would the machine boot properly one time and not the next on power up ?	Ques
1.6.6	Could it be that simple - blasted parasites and hijack code ?	Ques
1.7.1	Great idea - where do I find the updated BIOS on the site ?	Ques
1.7.2	I have been to compaq.com and the download files are very limited .	St
1.7.3	Can you point me in the right direction ?	Ques
1.8.1	It 's a common issue , but many do n't like that we have to scan and remove the pests with some 5 tools .	St
1.8.2	Some want a single piece of software to fix it .	St
1.8.3	Sorry , we do n't have that technology yet ( unless it 's Linux ? )	Ques
1.8.4	The short list is : Adaware , Spybot , Cwshredder , Housecall and BHODEMON .	St
1.8.5	BHODEMON appeared a short while ago and I 've found it usefull to list the BHOs and to remove the ones I do n't want .	St
1.8.6	Another issue is Internet Explorer .	St
1.8.7	Doxdesk explains it 's danger .	St
1.8.8	It 's such an issue that I advise to use any other non-IE browser when possible .	St
1.8.9	Bob	St
1.9.1	Thanks again - I will clean the machine again using the suggested tools and see if it makes a difference .	St
1.9.2	Any direct known issues with AOL Instant Messenger and spyware/corrupting files ?	Ques
1.10.1	To avoid the AIM issues , look up GAIM .	St
1.10.2	Open source , free and without the ads .	St
1.10.3	Bob	St
1.11.1	http : //h20180.www2.hp.com/apps/Lookup ? h_lang=en & h_cc=us & cc=us & h_page=hpcom & lang=en & h_client=S-A-R163-1 & h_query=presario+5000 & submit.x=8 & submit.y=4 Start here and step down until you get to support and drivers .	St
1.11.2	It should list by category , including bios updates .	St
1.11.3	Good luck	Polite
