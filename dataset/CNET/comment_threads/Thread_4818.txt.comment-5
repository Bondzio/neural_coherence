I had planned to buy a new card anyway but wanted to ask so maybe I could fix it until I get the money.
I think there's already been damage done to the card from heat, it never clocked at the right speeds since I got it, and always ran worse than it was supposed to, so I need a new one anyway.
I'm going nvidia because the vpu crash problem is with many ati cards, so I'm going to avoid them for this computer.
Another thing to note is that I don't have a Best Buy, Circuit City, OR Fry's Electronics anywhere within several cities of me.
I get everything from newegg and I'm definitely not in the position where I'm rich enough (or DUMB enough) to pay someone hundreds more dollars to fix something than the job is worth.
Granted, I DON'T know what to do about fixing my problem, but I'd hate to pay a BestBuy the cost of one of their price-jacked graphics cards, and then $300 more for the labor for them to install it for me - just because they were no more intelligent about the problem than I or any of you guys out there and had to replace the card anyway.
Thanks for giving input though, at least now I know buying a new card wouldn't be a bad thing to do.
