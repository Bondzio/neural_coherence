1.1.1	I'm thinking of replacing my P4 3.0GHZ with an AMD64 3800+.	St
1.1.2	Does anyone know if Adobe Premiere Pro 1.5 will run better on a 3800+ despite the lack of hyper-threading?	St
1.2.1	I'd see if http://www.tomshardware.com has a benchmark or comparison of these CPUs on this task, but just guessing, my outlook is that it's not worth the changeover.	St
1.2.2	To be more precise, I've see fairly linear payoff from sheer MHz and all I get from SMP or HT has been some smoothness and slight gains.	St
1.2.3	Moving across CPU makes has not made any gains that I would jump up and down about.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
