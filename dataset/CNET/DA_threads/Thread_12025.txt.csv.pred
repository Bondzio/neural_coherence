1.1.1	Hi I have a client who requres tablets for a number of users .	St
1.1.2	Am having problems sourcing the best tablet : Requirements : O/S Windows or Android as a vital app they/program they use is only available on Windows or Android 3G capability ( either through direct sim or dongle ) as they work rurally and will not always have a wifi connection Be able to print .	St
1.1.3	We have had trouble finding a printer in NZ that is cheap enough to purchase and is easily connected to by the tablets .	St
1.1.4	Seems to be a hard ask finding Samsung tablets in NZ at a reasonable price .	St
1.1.5	Any ideas would be really helpful .	St
1.2.1	I have n't found connections to printers to be any harder than usual for Windows 8 Pro tablets than in the past .	St
1.2.2	Maybe you mean something else but I 'm seeing folk demand easier than the usual .	St
1.2.3	They want no drivers , it just connects and prints .	St
1.2.4	Is that what you are seeing ?	Ques
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks - yes thats not a problem with Windows8 but its also finding a tablet that is 3g compatible which is causing the issue .	Res
1.3.2	Any ideas on a tablet that meets all those needs ?	Ques
1.4.1	Why is not too interesting except it gives us a better choice of carriers , lower costs .	St
1.4.2	As importing is a problem I ca n't share models we see in the USA .	St
1.4.3	But it appears you have yet to find any in your market .	St
1.4.4	Does n't that clarify that what you want is going to be something in the future ?	Ques
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Am going to find a forum in nz !	St
1.5.2	Thanks again	St
1.6.1	You probably wo n't find what your looking for in a retail or online consumer outlet for a pure Tablet based device .	St
1.6.2	My advice is to check with the local NZ wireless providers for a tablet based device as they will have to support the data/wireless plan for Windows or Android and the hardware was most likely designed specifically for them .	St
1.6.3	By comparison Apple supports the iPad regardless of wireless carrier because they own the hardware and OS .	St
1.7.1	The units with cellular are rarely outside the normal carrier channels for well discussed reasons .	St
1.7.2	I ca n't cover this in full detail but here we use the run of the mill tablets but a hotspot box for the reason I gave and more .	St
1.7.3	You seemed concerned with costs so it seems you either forge an alliance with the cellular carrier or take a big risk in importing something .	St
1.7.4	I 've seen a few try that here and they get burned later .	St
1.7.5	But folk will continue to try it .	St
