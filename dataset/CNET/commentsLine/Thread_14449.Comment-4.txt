you've repeated the exact reason why raid 1 rarely saves the day.
&quot;first, there is not really a ''main'' drive; the two drives are essentially peers.
second, data are not normally ''copied'' from one drive to the other; data are written simultaneously to both drives from the original source.&quot; bingo.
two corrupted drives for the price of one.
