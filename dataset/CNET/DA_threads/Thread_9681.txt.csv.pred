1.1.1	My router is old and runs on 802.11b while my new laptop has the 802.11g inbuilt wireless card .	St
1.1.2	Would changing the router to 802.11g significantly improve my internet speed ( I subscribe to the DSL )	St
1.2.1	Your internet speed is controlled by your internet service provider .	St
1.2.2	You would see no difference .	St
1.3.1	Your internet speed will be the same .	St
1.3.2	If you have more than 1 computer on the router and share files between them your speed will increase dramatically .	St
1.3.3	802.11b runs at 11 mbs and 802.11g runs at 54 mbs or 108 mbs depending on which 1 you buy .	St
1.3.4	A new router may provide better wireless security .	St
1.3.5	If you decide to upgrade look at your laptop specs to see if it is a 54 mbs or a 108 mbs wireless connection .	St
1.3.6	You may use either 1 no matter what you decide .	St
1.3.7	goodluck	St
