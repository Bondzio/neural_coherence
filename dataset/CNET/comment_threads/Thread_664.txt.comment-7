I had the exact same situation, same computer.
That nut, fills in the gap between the bevel, and the screen .
Hard to explain.
It goes in the middle.
If it's not there, and screw it back too tight, you will bend the frame...it's to provide resistance, and stop it from caving in when you screw it down.
Doe.. not making any sense.
I tried.
