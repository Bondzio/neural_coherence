I want to buy a new computer and to install this as my second drive. Will I need to re-format this drive when I add it, and will I lose everything on it? Old computer runs XP, new one will run Vista. I'm not sure how I could back-up all the files on the drive before moving it - I guess I could save the files on the primary drive of the new computer but that would require me to use a key drive to transfer 1 GB at a time, and I'd have to switch my monitor over each time as I'm using the monitor from my old computer for the new one. Any tips?
