<s> I am looking for unbiased exhaustively detailed comparative reviews of high end-(ish) KVM switches that will support dual link (2560 X 1600 resolution) and dual head (two monitors). </s>
<s> I know that KVM switches are not in wide use even among the tech savvy -- so I am having a hard time finding detailed reviews (including front and back images) and recommendations. </s>
<s> Can you point me to a site that specializes in KVM reviews? </s>
<s> My searches are producing mostly store-front sites. </s>
<s> I need the KVM video connections to be DVI-D (not VGA) [I think that DVI-I would also work as I believe that it is a superset of DVI-D]. </s>
<s> Would prefer for the keyboard and monitor connection to be USB rather than PS/2. </s>
<s> I would prefer a 3-port switch but can settle for 2 port (and obviously can use a 4-port but do not want to pay a ton of extra money for extra ports that would not be used). </s>
<s> Also, the switch needs to support XP and Win7 (so am looking for USB DDM KVM Switches--see link below to paper on DDM switches). </s>
<s> Would prefer a model that also switches audio but that is not a deal breaker. </s>
<s> I am currently using an Avocent SwitchViewDVI 2SVDVI10 which I believe is supposed to support dual-link but does not appear to actually support resolutions greater than 1600 X 1200. </s>
<s> And I just got a Dell U3011 and want to move up to max resolution. </s>
<s> My current switch also definitely does not support a dual monitor setup so it is time to upgrade. </s>
<s> (It also does not seem to work correctly switching my Brother printer connected via USB but that is not as critical). </s>
<s> I did find an interesting white paper from Microsoft, but it does not investigate specific models of KVM switches (see http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/display/KVM-Win7.mspx ). </s>
<s> Can you help me? </s>
<s> (Please do not recommend models that are 2-4 years old as nothing that old will have all that I am looking for--although feel free to comment on reliability/reputation of various KVM manufactures based on your experience with older models even if you are not an expert on current models). </s>
<s> But I never found such a site. </s>
<s> But let's start off with a dual link 2 port switch to see how serious the need is. </s>
<s> I've found some want this or that but when the unit is found the need vanishes. </s>
<s> Look at http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-DVI-D-Dual-Link-2-Port-Switch/dp/B0039RZG1Y Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the quick reply Bob. </s>
<s> I could definitely get by with a 2-port unit. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the model that you linked to does not support a dual monitor set up. </s>
<s> I cannot go with a single monitor switch. </s>
<s> I would also be nervous about buying any model that has no reviews at all. </s>
<s> That in all my travels and trade show visits I have yet to find such a thing. </s>
<s> Even the dual link switch is a bit rare so you might wonder why they don't make such a thing I think you know why. </s>
<s> As such, we can solve this with 2 of the above boxes. </s>
