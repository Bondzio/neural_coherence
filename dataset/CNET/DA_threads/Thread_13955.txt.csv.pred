1.1.1	One WinXP Pro wireless computer; one Win2k computer; both currently networked and ethernet cable wired to a Linksys wireless router.	St
1.1.2	QUESTION: Can I directly connect the Win2K computer by USB cable to printer; and then the wireless printer to the router by ethernet cable; and then set the Win2k computer to share this printer so the WinXP wireless can connect &quot;wireless&quot; ?	Ques
1.2.1	You have to decide, which connection you want to use for the printer.	St
1.2.2	and in your post you said something about connecting your Wireless printer to the router using ethernet cable..	St
1.2.3	I don't get it...	St
1.3.1	One connection to the printer is sufficient for sharing.	St
1.3.2	SHARE A PRINTER: Connect the printer to one computer (the ''host'' computer) via USB cable and then share that printer in the printer properties on that host computer.	St
1.3.3	For other computers to use the printer, the computer that is hosting the printer must be &quot;on.&quot; There is no guarantee that other computers will be able to use all printer functions other than printing.	St
1.3.4	NETWORK A PRINTER: Connect the printer to the router via a WIRED PRINT SERVER or a WIRELESS PRINT SERVER that you purchase.	St
1.3.5	Any computer that is connected to the network will be able to use the printer.	St
1.3.6	The drawback is it is likely you will only be able to use the print function when networking the printer.	St
