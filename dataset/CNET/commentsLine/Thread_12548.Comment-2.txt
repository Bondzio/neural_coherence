msft (see google) tends to call these issues cosmetic as the system works but does what you wrote about.
since it works, the printer prints they may leave such a bug unfixed.
this can upset those that have no history with msft.
ok, one idea.
manually clear the print queue.
here's a google on that.
but my thought is if it is printing, why fix this?
