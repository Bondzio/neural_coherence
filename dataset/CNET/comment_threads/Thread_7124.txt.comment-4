Maybe I should ask what type of UPS should I buy....
I looked at my system again to see if a smaller unit would work.
Maybe APC Back-UPS ES USB 750VA w/TEL & COAX 120V could work?
I have a Intel Core 2 CPU 6400 2.13GHz desktop with a 26&quot; LCD monitor, cable modem and router, ink jet printer (which I guess should just be on surge protection), and a USB foot pedal (for work).
OS is Windows MCE if that matters.
