1.1.1	I have a Windows Me system with plenty of RAM & harddrive space .	St
1.1.2	I just recently had a SONY CD-ROM drive installed because mine crashed .	St
1.1.3	I 'm using software called & quot ; Ashampoo Recording Suite 4 & quot ; .	St
1.1.4	The program will let me burn a new CD but will not let me burn an existing CD .	St
1.1.5	It wants me to select a CD writer form the drop-down list but there are none in the menu to select !	St
1.1.6	What can I do to fix this ?	Ques
1.2.1	& quot ; existing CD & quot ; do you mean a CD/RW or a CD that was created before you installed the Sony ?	Ques
1.2.2	If it was a CD/RW , how you & quot ; closed & quot ; it would have a lot to do with your ability to & quot ; append & quot ; data to it .	St
1.2.3	If all you want to do is reuse it , then you will have to re-initialize and/or re-format it .	St
1.2.4	Your software 's help file will show you how .	St
1.2.5	If you 're talking about a CD with data already on it then you wo n't be able to write to it .	St
1.2.6	It 's a one-time deal .	St
1.2.7	If it 's something other then please provide a detailed description of the problem and what you have already tried .	St
1.2.8	and life goes on ... Jack	St
