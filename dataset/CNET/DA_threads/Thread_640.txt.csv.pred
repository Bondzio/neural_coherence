1.1.1	I want to use my new pc to record tv shows , burn cd 's and dvd 's , digital photography and eventually video .	St
1.1.2	I 'm seriuously considering buying this package ( 17 '' LCD , Canon printer ) which does n't have a TV tuner/remote for $ 999 : GTW 835GM Pentium D processor 820 Dual-core processing 1024MB of DDR2 RAM 250GB 7200RPM hard drive Dual DVD drives Windows XP Media Center or for $ 1229 I could get this one ( same bundle ) with the TV tuner/remote : Gateway - 830 Media Center Desktop 840GM Intel Pentium D processor 830 ; DL DVDRW/CD-RW and DVD-ROM drives ; 250GB hard drive ; 1GB PC4200 DDR2 memory ; Windows XP Media Center 2005 ; TV tuner ; 8-in-1 media manager My question is would it be cheaper and easy enough for an intermediate pc user like myself to buy and install a tv tuner card ?	Ques
1.1.3	Are the USB tuners an easier option ?	Ques
1.1.4	What about the remote ?	Ques
1.1.5	Can I buy that too ?	Ques
1.1.6	I realize the processor is slightly faster but I doubt I would notice the difference .	St
1.2.1	The tv-tuner one .	St
1.2.2	Because 830=2x3.0ghz and 820=2x2.8ghz .	St
1.2.3	But i do believe that both contains a tv-tuner .	St
1.2.4	ROger	St
1.3.1	yes .	Res
1.3.2	it will include a remote and the IR connector .	St
1.3.3	go the 830gm .	Sug
1.3.4	konny	St
1.4.1	I was actually at Best Buy the other day and asked why the 840GM was $ 200 more and the salesman told me because of the slightly newer/faster processor and because it had the TV tuner card where the 835GM did not ( he even turned the thing around and checked ) .	St
1.4.2	I thought this was totally retarded for a thousand dollar ''media pc '' to not have the card already .	St
1.4.3	After all , is n't being able to watch and record TV the biggest feature of using XP Media Center ?	Ques
1.5.1	Just get the emachines t6522 than , it includes one .	St
1.5.2	Only downside is lack of dual-core and btx chassis .	St
1.5.3	If you really want , suggest getting the 835GM , because a better tv-tuner card such as the all-in-wonder x600pro pci-express card can be had for less than the difference of $ 200 .	St

1.6.7	The guy today tells me their sale always ends on Saturday and a new one begins on Sunday .	St
1.6.8	Whatever !	St
1.6.9	While I was waiting for some help I actually took a peak at an HP with Media Center and I really did n't like the way it works anyway .	St
1.6.10	All those giant icons and step by step instructions on how to do stuff like play a CD or look at your digital photos .	St
