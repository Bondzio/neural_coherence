i am currently using an ati 9250 rad 256 card(pci) for video.
i have a linksys 10/100 network card.
what would be the point of upgrading to an agp 4x or 8x or a 16x pcie card?
i am wondering if my network card would even support the bandwidth that these cards supply.
during ftp i can get up to 3.5 megs a sec but if what i am reading is correct my pci video card will deliver up to 120 something megs a sec.
so what is the point of getting a more powerful card that will deliver 2 to 4 gigs a sec if my network doesnt (?)
support that rate of transfer?
i am currently on a cable modem not a t1 line but am confused at this point as to what is the point of the higher end agp and pci cards.
mainly i am curious about multi player games and the i know that i am missing some basic facts but cant seem to find a relevant source online that points me in the right direction.
any help would be appreciated.
