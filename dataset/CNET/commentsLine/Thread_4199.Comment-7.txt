i suggest you check the setting to see if the &quot;media&quot; is the type you're printing to.
if not, change it and save it before exiting.
plus, you should at least redo the setting to &quot;defaults&quot;, try a print, if its ok, great if not then verify what the changes should be made.
very possible the print area of the media is smaller than it should be and/or an &quot;autofeed&quot; is proper for to be ready for next print job.
the reason i mentioned a simple print test for output.
also, if you have footer cmds.
remove them, these are the items &quot;page 1&quot; or &quot;file123.txt&quot; that get printed out along with the next, default them or blank(no cmd.).
