I am getting some spots on my tv. i am using the VGA cable because the tv does not have a DVI connection. i could use a DVI to a HDMI cable. but i still don't know what setting i should use?

Then it works fine. it seems to happen only when i turn my comp off and then turn it back on. when i have it running for a little while it runs fine but i have to turn it on and off twice and let it run for a couple of minutes before i restart. other wise it runs real slow and jumpy. i have a good feeling it has to do with the monitor and video card because i put my old monitor on and it worked fine. i have run virus programs and everything is a ok.
