thanks, ernie, but mine's not the wireless one.
it's hp's p/n:5187-0341. i can find many similar ones on ebay, but the photos don't have sufficient resolution to see the icons on the buttons.
i'm just going to run down to best buy or costco and take a look at a similar keyboard.
even hp can't help on this one; i just can't figure out why this is so hard.
thanks again for trying.
