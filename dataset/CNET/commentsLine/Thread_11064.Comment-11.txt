diesel's have been my thing for the past 5 years, which started after purchasing my first 3/4 ton ford diesel pickup (still driving daily at 215,000 miles) and just got more involved when my oldest son purchased a 2006 vw jetta with the turbocharged diesel.
we've had good success thus far, but the diesel technology has fascinated me so i regularly dig into those realms for efficiency gains and reliability enhancements.
thanks again for all your help.
