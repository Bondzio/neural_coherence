So far i found an antenna: http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.37185 But im not sure about the quality of the antenna so im asking you guys. Also i would like to know how much range i can look at with a 20dBm transmitter and a 36Dbm/4W Amplifier. (Transmitter -&gt; Amplifier -&gt; Antenna). Also if someone knows a better alternative it would be great. Thank you in advance. enkm

Great looking is your tipoff that they may have shortchanged the antenna work. This area is when ugly beats pretty every time. Look up the CANTENNA as a fine example. Bob

Im pretty sure you are right and this antenna is cheap and a piece of garbage but i couldn't find a better alternative, you might. Thank you for your reply and i hope that someone will have a solution to my problem. Thanks

10036	4	396343	3316821	3316784	einklienermench	6/6/10 7:40 AM	1.27581E12	okay	Well there is no problem with trying, but im a paranoid type and i always have to have a plan b, so if the antenna is not 10dBi or close, i need to know that i have an alternative at any given situation. That antenna look like exactly something i need, im also looking into the option of just modifying that antenna. Also im wondering about the radiation pattern of that antenna since there are no actual radiation pattern image i am wondering if i can contact the manufacturer. Yet i cant find that antenna at their website, so im starting to wonder if it is actually their product. Shady Stuff

10036	6	396343	3317151	3316838	R. Proffitt	6/6/10 3:45 PM	1.2758391E12	This is not going to end well.	Why must it be exactly 9 or 10 dB? Something is not being told here. If that performance is that important wouldn't we get out our RF NETWORK ANALYZER (see http://www.testequity.com/products/960/ ) and test this setup? Tipping my hand here. I wrote software for antenna testing years ago and used this and other gear to test these things. But at 10 bucks this is something you should just get and try. It's cheaper than time in the lab. Bob

And for your question, one db is not much, but two, three db is almost and twice as weak signal. im trying to establish a long range tunnel to connect to a device wireless, which is why i need the best focusing antenna i can get my hands on, one that is portable.
