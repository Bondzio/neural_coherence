<s> Ok, I recently purchased a new Dell 9100, with a Pentium d 820 chip. </s>
<s> It came with 1Gb ram (512 x 2) PC-4200, and I bought 2 Kingston 1gb PC-4200 sticks and installed them . </s>
<s> When I plugged the power cord back into the computer, it suddenly made a weird sound, you know like a &quot;you just messed up&quot; sound. </s>
<s> Did that sound about 3 times, then stopped. </s>
<s> SInce then I have not been able to get the computer to even power up at all. </s>
<s> I've removed the new sticks, and replaced the old ones and still nothing! </s>
<s> I've got some important stuff on there and need to fix this quick... please help! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Only you will know if the installation/removal went smoothly. </s>
<s> One thing I have found though is that it's easy to dislodge something else when pushing/pulling things straight from the MB in that it tends to flex. </s>
<s> The finicky component is the video card. </s>
<s> Take that out and reseat it. </s>
<s> If it does not connect properly you can get beeps on startup. </s>
<s> If not that, reseat any other cards in MB slots. </s>
<s> Hopefully the RAM was the right type and nothing got shorted. </s>
<s> The fact that you get beeps means you at least have power to the MB so there might be hope. </s>
