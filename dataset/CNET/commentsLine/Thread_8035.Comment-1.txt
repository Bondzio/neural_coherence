i have a sony vaio (pcv-rz50cg), i keep getting a low space error.
so i do a disk clean up and that is good for about a hour but then it needs it again.
my c drive is 13.9 gb with 159mb of free space left, my d drive is 212 gb with 3.25 gb free space left.
i know my d drive is filled with media center files that i can transfer to dvd but im having trouble with my c drive.
i try to scan it and see what files i can erase.
all the temp files and cookies get deleted but that dosent help the problem.
i come across so many files that i dont know what they do and i dont want to erase them and not have the computer not start up next time.
does anyone have any ideas on getting rid of mystery files, or if there is a software that would scan my computer and tell me if i need them or not?
thanks for the help!
