<s> first of all, i need to know these things.. does an external hardrive perform the same as the internal one? </s>
<s> i mean, when i connect it through firewire or usb, can i use the data on it and use it as if it were on an internal hardrive? </s>
<s> like for example, i use the avi files on it and edit the videos. </s>
<s> would that be possible? </s>
<s> i also need an external hardrive which i can connect directly to a television cause primarily im gonna use the hardrive to store my home videos.. thank you in advance... any suggestions on a very good hardrive would be appreciated.. i need 100+gb hardrive.. </s>
<s> If it's Windows, avoid firewire. </s>
<s> If it's a Mac, use Firewire. </s>
<s> Most will work fine on the PC with USB 2.0, very few will run on USB 1.1. </s>

<s> http://reviews.cnet.com/LaCie_Silverscreen_80GB/4505-3186_7-31256888.html?tag=pdtl-list bob, i found this here and it says it plays directly to tv.. is this a good hardrive? </s>
<s> so does external perform similarly to internal hardrives?what model can u suggest? </s>
<s> &quot;The Silverscreen is a sluggish mobile hard drive with a useful entertainment feature--it plays video and music directly to TV.&quot; Even the link you supplied noted this. </s>
<s> My externals are more of the 200+GB size with 7200RPM drives and quite nice at about 1/2 the dollar. </s>
<s> But my don't connect to the TV. </s>
<s> The item they won't tell you in this review is that the Video Encoding may be quite inefficient. </s>
<s> Let's take it that it's about the same as your DVD. </s>
<s> That gives this 80GB drive at most 17 movies. </s>
<s> Seems like a bad deal to me. </s>
<s> I'll share I use something along the same lines, which is the Dlink Media Center. </s>
<s> No hard disk and plays movies, music and such. </s>
<s> It's not perfect so read the reviews. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> reading ur replies uve helped me more than once from having a wrong purchase.. ill read more before i buy.. </s>
<s> I don't know if this is an option to you, but I plan to buy a 200 Gb high RPM internal HD, place it in an enclosure, and use the USB 2.0 connection from the enclosure as the connector. </s>
<s> You'll save a bundle (assuming you're not looking for a highly mobile HD; this is more of a 'stays in the house' external HD, I think) </s>
<s> I have an hp desktop and I am in the process of getting an apple laptop. </s>
<s> Can I partition the hardrive so i can back up data for both computers? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
