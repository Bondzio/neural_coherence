1.1.1	I am having USB port problems.	St
1.1.2	Sometimes it works and occassionally it doesn't work.	St
1.1.3	It has become worse since a few days.	St
1.1.4	My mouse suddenly stops working.	St
1.1.5	Is it a hardware or a software fault.	St
1.1.6	I am using intel dual core 2.5 ghz on an intel DG31PR motherboard running windows xp SP2.	St
1.1.7	I even reinstalled the USB drivers(controller, hub), etc.	St
1.1.8	But still the problem persists.	St
1.1.9	It happens more when I insert a second USB device, then both the ports stop working.	St
1.1.10	Then I have to remove and reinsert the USB device and it starts working.	St
1.1.11	It is really annoying when all of a sudden in the middle of a game, both the usb mouse and keyboard stop working Somebody please help me out.	St
1.1.12	recently i discovered one more thing .	St
1.1.13	when i plug in the speakers in the AC outlet on the UPS, both the USB mouse and USB keyboard hang.	St
1.1.14	does this problem have to do anything with the power circuit of the CPU	St
1.2.1	It is possible that your USB ports do not match the speed of the USB devices you are using.	St
1.2.2	For instance, your USB ports might be 1.1 ports, while the drivers you are using with your mouse and keyboard requires a 2.0 port.	St
1.2.3	If that's the case, then your system is going to have trouble working with those devices.	St
1.2.4	If that is the problem you're having, then the best solution is to either upgrade your motherboard or get a USB hub that can upconvert your USB ports to a 2.0 speed so your devices can work with them.	St
1.3.1	I found a couple things to try.	St
1.3.2	First with the previous poster, to see if you have USB 2.0, click on start&gt;rt.	St
1.3.3	click My Computer&gt; click Manage&gt; in window that opens click Disk Manager, scroll down to USB controllers and click the plus sign to open that branch.	St
1.3.4	Look for the word &quot;Enhanced&quot; in one of the branches.	St
1.3.5	If there you have 2.0, if not chances are you don't have 2.0.	St
1.3.6	Sometimes spyware will cause the USB devices to hang.	St
1.3.7	Run at least 4 anti spyware programs (such as Ad aware, Spybot S&D, Superantispyware, and Malwarebytes, they are all free)Delete anything they find.	St
1.3.8	Another issue that I found that affected the USB as well as Video was dust build up.	St
1.3.9	Take the cover off the left side (as you look at it from the front) and gander at the insides.	St
1.3.10	Is it a dust ball in there?	St
1.3.11	If so power down and get a can of compressed air to blow the inside dust out (hold the fan blade from turning with a finger as the compressed air will spin it faster than it is supposed to go, and as always watch out for electro-static discharge.	St
1.3.12	Of course I am assuming that this all worked before and now just started to happen.	St
1.3.13	Another thing is to get rid of temp files and temp download clutter, cookies etc.	St
1.3.14	Last but not least id defragment the computer if it has been a couple months or longer since it was last done (empty recycle bin before defrag.)	St
1.3.15	Hope this helps.	St
1.3.16	Jim	St
1.4.1	... for reports of driver problems.	St
1.4.2	I know you said you reinstalled the drivers, but the problem is persisting.	St
1.4.3	I suggest you check to see whether your computer is aware of a problem.	St
1.4.4	That may help you diagnose and correct it.	St
1.5.1	HP m7560y (32-bit)with 8 USB ports, three years old.	St
1.5.2	New Dell Studio XPS (64-bit) with 8 USB ports.	St
1.5.3	HP appears to only have v.1.1 USB, while Dell has 2.0.	St
1.5.4	A 7-port hub is connected to the HP, hub is 2.0, &quot;works with 1.1&quot;.	St
1.5.5	Front USB ports on HP no longer work, so hub is plugged into a rear USB port.	St
1.5.6	Bought Laplink PCMover Pro, says it will transfer from XP32 to Vista64, and will work with 1.1.	St
1.5.7	Tried to set up USB-USB migration, sets up on Dell, but not HP, yet I got a transfer started.	St
1.5.8	Tried Cat5 cable, and it will run until midnight, then quit (80 Gb to migrate, programs and files, best I've gotten is 8 Gb, it's so slow).	St
1.5.9	Filtered out games, Adobe CS3, turned off screensaver (Azure Bay), Norton 360, MS Auto Update, HP Update Manager, all of which try to update at midnight, migration still stops at midnight.	St
1.5.10	I read a post about a hub that upconverts from 1.1 to 2.0, I've never seen one.	St
1.5.11	Anyone know who makes it?	St
1.5.12	Secondly, I have run out of likely reasons the migration stops at midnight.	St
1.5.13	Any ideas?	St
1.6.1	From the looks, it seems like your USB ports are under-powered by the PC.	St
1.6.2	Check the USB power distribution in your USB hub in device manager.	St
1.6.3	Ensure it don't go to power savings and try it out.	St
1.6.4	Given when you plug your speaker to the UPS, have you tried plugging your desktop and speakers to the power mains directly instead?	St
1.6.5	If it still persist, next is to test your keyboard and mouse with another system to see if similar problems occurs, followed by plugging in a external card-reader or maybe try using your mobilephone connecting the desktop.	St
1.6.6	If all, except mobilephone works, you have a USB poweroutput issue.	St
1.7.1	Have you tried the reserve of from HP to Dell?	St
1.7.2	Does it happen to hang at midnight when doing so?	St
1.7.3	How about trying to copy like 5mins before midnight and see if it goes through that time and copy.	St
1.7.4	Is your hub provided with and option of taking in external power source?	Ques
1.7.5	Does both transfer stops at 8gb at different starting point and stops at midnight?	St
1.7.6	Did you see what file it's trying to migrate over when it stops?	St
1.7.7	It could be one of those huge files which takes too long that the software cutsoff transfer due to long inactivity.	St
1.8.1	Sounds like a driver issue to me.	St
1.8.2	Since they both work at some point or another, this is an unlikely solution but try plugging the USB devices into a different computer and see how they perform.	St
1.8.3	It could be the devices themselves.	St
