<s> i own a Dlink 524 D1 router, and it stopped working. </s>
<s> all the lights on the front are blinking normally as they would yet the pc thats plugged into it says &quot;the connection has limited or no connectivity&quot; and my laptop says the same for the wireless connection. </s>
<s> customer support was a joke. </s>
<s> and the internet connection itself works fine when i tried to individually plug in the pc to the ethernet port on my wall. </s>
<s> the connection when i first installed was made so that it was a secure one. </s>
<s> i tried to install it again and it told me to reset the router by pressing a button on the back for 10 sec and the lights should stop blinking, i tried that over and over but it never worked. </s>
<s> is it possible that it could've been hacked? </s>
<s> Maybe it died? </s>
<s> At such prices and out of warranty we shouldn't expect too much. </s>
<s> Try another router. </s>
