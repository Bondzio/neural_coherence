<s> I recently picked up an imation flash drive. </s>
<s> It's advertised as 8GB, but windows only shows 7.52GB of available space. </s>
<s> So I called Imation and asked them what was up with that. </s>
<s> They indicated that was normal, so I asked them why they advertised it as an 8GB drive if it really wasn't. </s>
<s> The tech assured me it was an 8GB drive, so I asked him, if I tried to transfer 8GB of data to the drive, would it hold it? </s>
<s> He said, &quot;No.&quot; Sound like false advertising to you? </s>
<s> Sure does to me. </s>
<s> Is this standard for all flash drives, and if so, why? </s>
<s> Windows calculates it differently so all we need to do is do the math. </s>
<s> Nothing wrong here. </s>
<s> Let's look at your KILO WATT HOURS on your bill. </s>
<s> Kilo = 1000 and not 1024. </s>
<s> There are some that want that to change but in a nutshell. </s>
<s> Kilo = 1000 Giga = 1,000,000,000 You see where this is going? </s>
<s> formatting requires space. </s>
<s> Imagine a book with 300 pages. </s>
<s> It has a title page, an index, appendix, maybe a glossary, and there has to be space for pages numbers. </s>
<s> A certain number of pages have to devoted to keeping track of where data is located. </s>
<s> It's the same way with your flash drive. </s>
<s> A certain amount of those 8 GB are dedicated to keeping track of where everything is located. </s>
