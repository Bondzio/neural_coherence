<s> I was just about to buy a monochrome laser printer when I read a review that you need to replace the laser printer's cartridge or drum or something every 3 toners, and each cartridge costs just as much as the laser printer. </s>
<s> Is this true? </s>
<s> I need advice on buying a printer to be used when I'm at a university. </s>
<s> Honestly, I only need black ink, and there will be months when I won't use it since I will be on break. </s>
<s> How much maintenance comes with laser printers in comparison to inkjet printers? </s>
<s> How long do they last? </s>
<s> Thanks, and sorry for so many questions, it's just so hard to pick. </s>
<s> Do some research on toner cartridge cost and availability before you buy one. </s>
<s> Sounds to me as if you just need something basic. </s>
<s> The Brother 2140 would probably work, they are inexpensive and functional and the toner cost won't break you. </s>
<s> Rule of thumb on a toner cartridge (mono) is something over 2000 copies but it can vary depending upon the unit. </s>
<s> Some manufacturers offer two variations of toner cartridges, basic and full, quantity of toner in cartridge and the cost will reflect that. </s>
<s> If you do a color laser the story changes they will be considerably more expensive to operate, especially if you have to replace a drum. </s>
<s> Some brands of laser printers (such as HP) incorporate the drum with the toner cartridge. </s>
<s> Depending on the machine and type of cartridge it uses, you'll get anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 pages (monochrome) of normal text coverage on the average page. </s>
<s> You can then either buy a new cartridge -- typically costing $60 to $90, but with some outliers much more costly -- or you can re-fill the cartridge. </s>
<s> Several firms on the internet sell refill kits. </s>
<s> We use products from TonerRefillKits.com, but I'm sure there are other reputable suppliers you can choose from. </s>
<s> Some printers, however, separate their toner cartridges from the drums. </s>
<s> Brother does this. </s>
<s> We haven't noticed that the Brother toner cartridges are any cheaper than HP's, but after you've run 3-5 through the machine, the drum starts wearing out. </s>
<s> And -- surprise, surprise -- a replacement drum costs $180 to $250. </s>
<s> Yep, that's more than we paid for the machine. </s>
<s> So while the Brother machines tend to be cheaper to start with, they can become extremely MORE expensive. </s>
