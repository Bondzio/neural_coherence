<s> I recently purchased a YAMAHA CAVIT DP-U50 Personal Sound Receiver for the PC. </s>
<s> I also purchased the Yamaha NS-U50 speakers as well. </s>
<s> How do I get these speakers to work with this receiver and did I buy the wrong speakers??? </s>
<s> The receiver has RCA plugs but the speaker are the normal &quot;bare wire&quot; connections. </s>
<s> I am getting no sound from this setup. </s>
<s> Please, anyone, HELP! </s>
<s> lol </s>
<s> amplifier capable of driving the speakers??? </s>
<s> Or does it expect you to use powered speakers which have an audio amplifier built into them??? </s>
<s> I'll do a search and see if I can learn more. </s>
<s> As for the two wires you can simply snip the RCA connector off and use the wires. </s>
<s> The shield may be the return for both speakers. </s>
<s> comes with two sound powered speakers. </s>
<s> Why did you buy separate speakers? </s>
<s> Or did you simoply buy the card????? </s>
<s> ?/ </s>
<s> it says downside NO AMPLIFIER!!!!!!!!!!!!! </s>

<s> I purchased each separately. </s>
<s> The receiver was sold alone and I thought I had purchased the correct speakers. </s>
<s> I guess I didnt. </s>
<s> I tried snipping off a pair of RCA jacks (with speaker wire) but the sound is way too low. </s>
<s> Have I missed something here or do you think I should purchase other speakers?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Ray, Thank you for taking the time to look at this. </s>
<s> I guess I should have researched this better before I purchased it. </s>
<s> (Ebay purchase) </s>
<s> speakers, because the unit does not have an amplifier built in.. </s>
<s> The first link that I went to [$190 or so] said that it came with powered speakers, then saw on other links that you could get it much cheaper without speakers. </s>
<s> Didn't know that you bought it through EBay. </s>
<s> I've never even looked there for anything. </s>
<s> I figure if I got burned once I would never save enough to make up for it on another purchase. </s>
<s> You can get a cheap pair of powered speakers at Wal-Mart for $15.00. </s>
<s> With a so called &quot;woofer&quot; for $25.00. </s>
<s> Hope that things turn out OK, now that you know the solution. </s>
<s> Yeah...DP-U50 is a processor only, no amp. </s>
<s> The RP-100 has the built in 30 watt per ch. </s>
<s> amp + a tuner; still only 2 channels (Virtual Dolby 5.1. </s>
<s> -You can find one for $99.- nice price). </s>
<s> Also, if I'm not mistaken, you can check out the RP-U200: 5 channel discrete + a remote. </s>
<s> I picked up a pair of the NS-U50's for $17.99 (new) last week. </s>
<s> They're O.K with a sub, but my Polk R15's sound much better. </s>
<s> I'm using the RP-100, mostly in straight stereo. </s>
<s> I got it to use with my G4 Cube which only has USB sound interface- does everything I need & more for not a lot more than a pair of those tinny mac pro speakers. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
