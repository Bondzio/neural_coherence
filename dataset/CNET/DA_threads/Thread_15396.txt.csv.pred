1.1.1	I need help choosing a processor for a new Dell computer I will be purchasing.	St
1.1.2	I have no idea which processor would be better either the P4 Processor 541 with 3.2ghz or the P4 630 with 3.0ghz or should i go with the more expensive Pentium D Processor 820 with Dual Core Technology (2.8GHz, 800FSB).	St
1.1.3	With any of these choices I will have 1gb ram and a 256mb pci(e) card.	St
1.1.4	Basically all I want to do is play Battlefield 2 and burn cd's.	St
1.1.5	thanks for the help.	Polite
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	While the Pentium D is dual-core, it only runs at 2.8GHZ.	St
1.4.2	THe P4 runs at 3.2GHZ.	St
1.4.3	Since they're both Prescotts, the P4 will be faster now.	St
1.4.4	In the future, games will be more than likely made for 2 cores, so the Pentium D will be faster.	St
1.4.5	Go with the Pent.D However, if you game, go with an Athlon 64, which will slaughter both chips.	St
1.4.6	AMD is making a budget X2 in the future($300-ish) and is quire faster than the Pentium D.	St
