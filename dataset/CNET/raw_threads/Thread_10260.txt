Not good, I saw this once. I came home to a strange smell and found my computer power lights blinking and just like you I turned it off and it never came back. Best bet, take it to computer repair place that will check it out for you and consult you before making any costly repairs. I took mine to a local place with specific instruction to try only replacing the power supply, if that did not work stop all repairs and call me. I was told it was trashed and that only the case was still good. I paid a $34 bench fee and took my smelly dead computer home. I fixed the PC anyway by replacing the HDD, motherboard, power supply, ram, and modem. The only parts that made it were the case, video card, and sound card. The parts alone to do this cost me about $400 and hours of work. Right now you can buy a cheap PC for that.
