1.1.1	Tried to turn on my PC today, and it wouldn't turn on.	St
1.1.2	Not a thing.	St
1.1.3	No lights, no nothing.	St
1.1.4	I'm guessing this means the PSU has given up the ghost, but there were no tell tale signs (like black smoke ;)).	St
1.1.5	Just looking for confirmation that this can happen just like that, it is a pretty old PSU, about 5 years now.	St
1.2.1	swap in a new one that's known good.	St
1.2.2	They do go just like that.	Sug
1.3.1	Thanks for your reply Michael.	Polite
1.3.2	Turns out it was the power supply, but since it was an old computer the power supply wasn't made anymore, and as it was an awkward size (only 9cm deep!!)	St
1.3.3	I had to re-case the whole PC to put a new PSU in.	St
1.3.4	Ah well.	St
1.3.5	All done now!	St
