I read that SSD will be the storage or front-end boot device for laptops and game PCs.
They're not going away and if Seagate is right, pricing is a factor holding back but only for the time being.
Once the NAND memory gets geared-up I don't see where it can't be the prime storage or boot device not long from now.
While current HDs do just fine and hold the storage maximums, I'm sure there will be a mix of storage later.
SSD are bound to jump in where the current iPods and Druids will rule once offered.
SSD are also going into devcies not 100% PC, but immediate storage doe say on printers and possibly stand-alone systems.
As for myself, I'm quite happy w/o any SSD, since my storage needs are easily meant, traditionally.
It would nice to have SSD as a flash drive and mount it and get all those s/w tools and what-nots for a field repair.
