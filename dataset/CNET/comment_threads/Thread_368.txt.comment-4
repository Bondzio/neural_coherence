To determine why requires a few million bucks of equipment in some radio site survey truck.
For well under 100 bucks, a repeater will likely just cure it.
Let me share that a microwave oven cohabits this frequency space and is some 1000 Watts.
It's not supposed to leak much but I have seen them interfere with Wifi operation.
If you want to know why, I must bow out now.
If you want to fix it, the repeater will likely cure it.
It has so far.
