Hi , Recently , I purchased a DVD writer and I am using Nero suite from Samsung for CD burning , which came along the DVD writer.
I did write a few DVDs, but now I broght a HP Re-writeable DVD, which is 4.7 GB, but now when I insert the DVD in the DVD Rom , the system hangs and just to check if the Cd empty , I completely erased the DVD using Nero , but even then, when I write sample movies for trials , the system hangs and only after I eject the DVD , the system becomes normal.
I have intel pentium Dual dore , 512 MB Ram , 80 GB HD.
Please let me know if there is any problem with the DVD or is it with the OS , FYI:I reinstalled the Nero suite once agin .
Please advise .
Thanks !
