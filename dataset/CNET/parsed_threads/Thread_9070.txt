<s> Hi unfortunately i have this problem with my brand new seagate 160GB SATA drive but i've runned some benchmarks(freshdiagnose) with this score: Write 8mb\s , Read 480mb\s . </s>
<s> Its a bit frustating seeing this slow write speed compared to the too(?) </s>
<s> high reading speed... </s>
<s> I have the newest drivers(intel Ultra/Sata storage controllers) and the whole computer is just 1month old. </s>
<s> I've runned the seatool and it took 4hours to complete with the result of failure of the extended test but it didnt say why... so it work properly but slow. </s>
<s> I checked the main IDE channel it is in UltraDMA5 mode. </s>
<s> I have two partitions on it (135-15)but i dint thin so this make the problems... How can I make it work on proper speed like 40-50mb/s? </s>
<s> I took year to copy my olda data to this drive so i dont want to foramt it again. </s>
<s> Specs: Drive - seagate barracuda 7200 (ST3160811AS) Windows XP pro s2 1gb ram Intel Pentium 945D 3.4ghz motherboard : MSI 945PL </s>
<s> Is the drive a SATA 150 or a 300? </s>
<s> Whuch of the two speeds does your mobo's SATA support. </s>
<s> The Seagates have a jumper if it is a 3.0 Gbps drive and the mobo's only 1.5 Gbps. </s>
<s> Mostly they are shipped with the jumper to limit it to 1.5, and must be removed. </s>
<s> [just the opposite for WD drives] The mobo reporting UDMA5 is an error according to Scott Mueller's book. </s>
<s> Upgrading and Repairing PC'sa [17th edition] Quote is from the book. </s>
<s> Hope that this does not violate copyright laws. </s>
<s> &quot;Note that because SATA is designed to be backward-compatible with parallel ATA, some confusion can result because SATA drives can report speeds and modes that emulate parallel ATA settings for backwards compatibility. </s>
<s> This means the drive is merely lying for backwards compatibility with existing software.&quot; &quot;UDMA 5 is is ATA 100 [parallel ATA mode at 100 MBps] while the slowest Serial mode [1.5 GBps] is 150 MBps and Ultra DMA modes simply do not apply to Serial ATA drives.&quot; &quot;The Serial ATA spec actually requires that the reply to the IDENTIFY DEVICE command are to be set as indicated in ATA/ATAPI 5.&quot; </s>
<s> This is the only one (+IDE dvd writer) and the PC is ready made so not i build it, thats mean if i open it (to change the jumper) I will lose the warranty... but who cares i took off the warranty vignette(of course very carefully so i can replace haha :D) and removed the jumper . </s>
<s> ok motherboard supports 3gb/s as its SATA II and the harddisk also supports 3gb/s but change is resulted with no speed incrase and XP become very unstable (blue screen of death several times) I reinstalled the mother chipset drivers with original ones. </s>
<s> If i can understand you its not good that my drive is on UDMA5 .. but the bios says its on UDMA6 so i've reinstalled de IDE drives in device manager (deleted first IDE channel and restarted) but it's stucked on UDMA5.. What can i do? </s>
<s> That info is INTENTIONALLY incorrect. </s>
<s> That is not the cause of your problem. </s>
<s> [I did NOT say that it was not good that the drive was on UDMA 5] Is it possible that that whatever you used for the speed test does not support SATA drives? </s>
<s> My reply was basically to tell that the UDMA 5 was not actually correct, but was intentional reported as such by the SATA specification to maintain compatibility with ATA software. </s>
<s> That does NOT control the speed of the data transfers, your mobo controller shoud do that. </s>
<s> [actually the controller is on the card inside the drive] the chipset on the mobo talks to that controller. </s>
<s> I erred in not telling you to first go to the Seagate site to verify that your drive came defaulted with the jumper on for the 150 or not. </s>
<s> Please go there and enter the drive model to double check the jumpering. </s>
<s> If the system got unstable after you removed the jumper, you should check things at the Seagate site. </s>
<s> What make and model is your computer?? </s>
<s> I am assuming that you are not using some kind of adapter to use a PATA port to interface the SATA drive. </s>
<s> I am NOT an expert on measuring the transfer speed, never bothered to check in 20 years or so. </s>
<s> Again, my info was simply to advise you that the UDMA 5 was incorrect but intentional by spec. </s>
<s> Hopefully Robert Proffitt or Ed O'Daniel can help. </s>
<s> Is the SATA drive connected to an SATA port or IDE port (with an adapter) on the motherboard? </s>
<s> of course yes its connected to the sata port my pc is ready made from the store Theres nothing with the test but i've runned some other benchmarks. </s>
<s> I can see how slow it is without it (ex. </s>
<s> : flashget mallocing disk space for 150meg for about 2mins) I've also downloaded seagate diagnostic program - seatools which says there is something wrong but it doesnt what it is... Im wondering about: if some settings are wrong if the harddrive is wrong (i have a warranty) if the motherboard chipset driver isnt installed correctly (i've tried download some new driver from intel but its the same) if something in the bios incorrect if the operating system sucks </s>
<s> Also tell us if you reinstalled the OS. </s>
<s> Completing a few details such as what's asked for in the forum note may help. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I've bought the PC with this specs: Drive - seagate barracuda 7200 (ST3160811AS) SATAII motherboard : MSI 945PL supports SATAIIas I said. </s>
<s> Its not from a manufacturer (like dell or IBM) the store should have made it from parts but its name 'optimum SPC-8' (- P Dual 3.4, 2*512Mb 533MHz DDR II, 160Gb 7200rpm Sata2 HDD, FDD, DVD +/-RW, Nvidia 7300GS) Yes i have reinstalled the OS and then drive speed was just around 3mb/s cuz it was in PIO mod I've the driver reinstalled so its in UDMA5 then. </s>
<s> It think I found out the reason of the freezes could it be because is touched the sata cable? </s>
<s> I've read somewhere this cable is very sensitive. </s>
<s> Since it's 1 month old and store bought how is it that you are having to repair it? </s>
<s> Just wondering. </s>
<s> So far I don't see any glaring clue here except maybe a bum OS install. </s>
<s> One owner complained to me and we found a pirated XP OS. </s>
<s> What to do then? </s>
<s> But this is not saying you have such but any clue would be appreciated to see if something that others have seen will show. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> As far as my os is a legal copy with all the updates provided by microsoft. </s>
<s> I will try your suggest and reinstall the OS &quot;...ok I removed the jumper ... but the change is resulted with no speed incrase and XP become very unstable (blue screen of death several times)...&quot; - freezes only happened after i had done this Insted of reinstalling the OS having an other partition with 15GB can help? </s>
<s> Install another copy of the os on this partition and will see it will be helpful or I wont need to format the whole harddisk? </s>
<s> &quot;Since it's 1 month old and store bought how is it that you are having to repair it? </s>
<s> &quot; Because it was slow from the begining and it should , it must work on much higher speed.. </s>
<s> The blue screen is telling me something's busted. </s>
<s> My XP never does this anymore. </s>
<s> I found a bad stick of ram. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> repair it under warranty. </s>
<s> Any hardware can fail at any time. </s>
<s> came after he removed the jumper that Seagate normally has on their 3.0 drives to force it to 150. </s>
<s> It is possible that the system assembler had already had the jumper in the proper position and I fouled him up. </s>
<s> I tried to tell him that but he probably has some trouble with English. </s>
<s> He probably shouild first replace the jumper and then possibly you can suggest a speed test to run. </s>
<s> I think that his data seemed weird. </s>
<s> I wonder if the Seagate diagnostic was run after the jumper change or before. </s>
<s> Certainly he should give the exact text of the Seagate Diagnostic test results. </s>
<s> OK i will run seatools - seageta diagnostics tomorrow. </s>
<s> The freezes occured by the SATA cable's berth </s>
<s> Simply that the early cables had nothing to hold the connectors mated. </s>
<s> Thus they could easily loosen and make poor connections. </s>
<s> Now one can buy cables that have a type of catch on them. </s>
<s> The ones that come with a mobo still seem to be the ones with no such catch to keep them mated. </s>
<s> They really can fall off easily. </s>
<s> you need to download and use their PowerMax diagnostic. </s>
<s> Powermax generates an 8 digit code IF it is defective. </s>
<s> This info and a link to the Powermax is located here: My internal hard drive may be defective, how can I test it? </s>
<s> This link will explain the use of the error code: PowerMax Diagnostic Codes - What does the error code mean and what do I do? </s>
<s> You appear to have changed your jumper so you might want to look at this graphic to ensure that you now have it proper for the 3 Gbits per sec (normal) configuration. </s>
<s> In short, NO pins jumpered together: http://www.seagate.com/images/support/en/us/cuda_sata_block.gif Could also be a problem with native command queuing. </s>
<s> Is NCQ enabled or disabled in your BIOS (or did the drivers you used support or not support it?) </s>
<s> for the SATA host controller? </s>
<s> http://www.seagate.com/content/pdf/whitepaper/D2c_tech_paper_intc-stx_sata_ncq.pdf Poor write speeds can also result from conflict between BIOs version and SATA driver versions. </s>
<s> Since this is such a recent purchase, I personally would waste no time taking it back and letting them (whoever built it) handle the problem. </s>
