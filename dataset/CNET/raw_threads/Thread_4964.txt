The one I am adding has xp pro on it already and I want to wipe it clean. My main hd that I am using now also has xp pro on it. Here is the problem I am having. I connected my main drive to the end of the cable and my slave drive to the middle part. When I boot up it ask which operating system I want to use and then begins to load the slave drive. I want it to load my main drive so I can get into the slave to reformat it. I have my jumpers set correct as for as I can tell. Any ideas what I am doing wrong?

Boot from a floppy or CD with a utility to wipe it clean of all data and partitions. Personally, I prefer the drive manufacturer's utility that does so as part of a destructive testing procedure. These also test the drive hardware and the integrity of the media. Every manufacturer has their own name. Seagate's is &quot;Seatools&quot;. WD, Hitachi and others offer such.

That eliminates the risk of inadvertently wiping the wrong drive and once it's wiped, it won't have an OS to boot from. If you have an old IDE 40 wire cable vs. an 80 wire cable, the Master or bootable drive is usually placed on the middle connector.

I did try using the utility that came with the hd but for some reason my A drive only reads some of the disk but not all. It would not read this one. It says the disk needed to be reformatted. I have bunches of floppies with pictures on them but when I went from 98 to xp I have not been able to view them. I even changed the A dive thinking it was bad but I get the same thing. But that is another story. I did get it wiped clean and reformatted. I have been moving my stuff to it already and all seems to be working well. Thanks for the help.
