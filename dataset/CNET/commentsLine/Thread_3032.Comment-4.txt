i once had a similar problem.
the issue was not with the physical set-up but with the firewall software (e.g., norton security, black ice, etc.)
i had installed on the machines.
if you're running one of these programs, you should go into the scren that allows you to allow or add &quot;friendly&quot; ip addresses.
just type in the ip address of your printer (e.g., 192.168.1.100) and hopefully you'll set up program will now be able to &quot;see&quot; the networked printer.
good luck...
