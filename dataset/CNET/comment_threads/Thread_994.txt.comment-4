Go to Start/Administrative Tools/Services.
Find the Wireless Zero Config Service and DISABLE it.
Reinstall your F5D7011 software and it should work fine.
The problem is that Windows tries to configure the card and screws it up.
Thanks to Bruce Finch, Wireless Guru at Symbol Technologies for the tip.
