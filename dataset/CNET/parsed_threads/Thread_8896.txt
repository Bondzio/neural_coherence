<s> I have bought systems from Monarch Velocity Micro, and Hypersonic. </s>
<s> The rest are high end gaming systems that roach wants. </s>
<s> You won't get a high end system from Compaq. </s>
<s> You will only get them from builders such as Falcon Northwest which is an extremely reliable company. </s>
<s> My friend had a problem with his optical drives. </s>
<s> He sent it back to them and got it fixed within a week. </s>
