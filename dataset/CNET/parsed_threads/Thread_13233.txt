<s> Hi Guys I know this will be a stupid question to you guys but what it is is a friend of mine installed a power supply for me ,specificley a Enermax Whisper ATX-E.Yesterday I noticed that one of the two fans in it is not running,the bottom fan (blowind down on the cpu)is working fine but the top fan or the one you see when looking at that the back of case isn't running.The person who installed it has gone away so I can't check with him so any help you can offer would be great.Everything is running fine with the one fan not turning but I'd just like to know why it isn't.Thanx guys. </s>
<s> Open your PC and check if its connected to the power supply. </s>
<s> If it is connected try transferring to another power connector. </s>
<s> If still not functioning maybe your exhaust fan is defective already, you have to replace it. </s>
<s> Thanks allot for your suggestion. </s>
<s> That's exactly what it was,I guess I somehow unplugged it but problem solved.Again thanks very much. </s>
