hi, when you are checking out the specs as others have suggested, be sure to check the duty cycle, usually expressed in pages per month - it's a pretty good indication of the workload a printer can handle.
that said, most lasers will have no problem with your 1000 pages per month (50x20).
i've had a samsung ml-1750 for about six years now and the quality of the print is still as good as the day i bought it.
it happily runs on cartridge world refilled toner cartridges ut then they do refill genuine samsung cartridges, not compatibles.
the only niggle with samsung is that the initial cartridge supplied with the printer is half load - a tad mean!
hp laserjet 10xx models have a pretty good reputation too and should be fine for the print capacity you need.
i've no experience with brother but their price is very attractive.
depending on your needs, you might want to take a look at some of the laser all-in-ones that have now reached the &quot;affordable&quot; level.
