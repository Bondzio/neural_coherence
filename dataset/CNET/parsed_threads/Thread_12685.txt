<s> Well Bob thanks for your help but I've found a work around on this one. </s>
<s> Since I'm not a gamer and don't need all of that fancy stuff I decided to go this route. </s>

<s> So far running well. </s>
<s> I have the same problem, but I am a gamer. </s>
<s> I don't know what that has to do with it, but Can you help me? </s>
<s> How do you uninstall without messing up your video card all together and then reinstall, I also have radeon 9550. </s>
<s> If it is not that much trouble could you write to my email account, I have a bad memory when it comes to where I get info, so I might not remember this site, My email is mattthemyth@live.com </s>
