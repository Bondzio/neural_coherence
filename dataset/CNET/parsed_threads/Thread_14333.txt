<s> Ok heres the situation... every time I go to rebuild my machine It fails out on copying files from any Windows Bootable CD...(Windows XP, 2000, and LongHorn_Beta). </s>
<s> The point is the machine gets to copying system files and then goes bad either a single file or a blue screen. </s>
<s> I've swapped the HDD, and the CD'S and I even took the HDD and CD and they installed fine on an older box I have. </s>
<s> Please I need any suggestion on what to do now.. Oh I have also reseated the memory IDE cables and changed CD-ROM drives. </s>
<s> The only thing I haven't done yet was reseat the CPU... </s>
<s> I hate having to move those things. </s>
<s> The machine is also rather dusty.. </s>
<s> I just want this thing to work... any help greatly welcome. </s>
<s> Thanks, Ray. </s>
<s> My usual list: 1. </s>
<s> BIG WHOPPING Power supply. </s>
<s> No mention of your complete machine parts list, but I often just pop in a 450 Watt PSU and try again. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Set the FSB (a BIOS setting) from 266 to 200 or 133 to 100 MHz. </s>
<s> (Beats crashing and hair loss) 3. </s>
<s> Pull the case cover, point a fan at the internals. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Just one stick of ram. </s>
<s> Then try another stick. </s>
<s> Don't NOT count that the ram works in another machine. </s>
<s> Needs to work in this machine. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
<s> Thanks alot Bob I'm going to have to changes the Power supply.. </s>
<s> I just bought a 300W and didn't think anything of it I'll check the other settings thanks for your time. </s>
<s> Ray. </s>
<s> Try the other settings since it &quot;lightens the load.&quot; AMD's tend to take big gulps of power and these tend to curb that appetite. </s>
<s> Can help in the pinch. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm looking at the motherboard now and I'm going to look up the power specs online... </s>
<s> I hope I can change the settings... </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> I like to add to what Robert suggested... </s>
<s> If the problem crops up under 3-different OS installs, I would look at more memory(check ram) or yet another CD drive. </s>
<s> I *assume* the OS cds are legit and not copies which can introduce problems also. </s>
<s> -OR- you maybe better off doing a fresh install if you're upgrading or reloading or trying a dual-mode install with win9x, etc.. Maybe, also the h/w just is too old as XP or even W2K become picky on that issue. </s>
<s> You just can't take anything for granted. </s>
<s> -----Willy </s>
<s> I had a similar problem; it was the cpu overheating while installing 98se. </s>
<s> Make sure your cpu fan/heatsink is clean and running; if it is very old, you might try a new fan/heatsink. </s>
<s> Ken </s>
<s> That might be the problem I have an Athlon K7 1.2 gig chip on a K7SEM board... and I took it all apart last night and the heatsink was mighty dirty... </s>
<s> I removed the fan from the top and cleaned it out the best I could... </s>
<s> I reseated the CPU and heatsink and cleaned the fan... there is another fan in the box so air flow shouldn't be an issue. </s>
<s> I'm going to go get my *legit* cd's and try again I can't give up Oh and btw the memory chip is 512DDR pc 133. </s>
<s> It should work fine It did in my other machine. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> The chip is rather new and unused... 512DDR SDRAM...PC 133. and the cd-rom was swapped I cleaned some dust out of the heat sink and fan and I'm taking my perfectly legit CD's and going to try again tonight wish me luck!! </s>
