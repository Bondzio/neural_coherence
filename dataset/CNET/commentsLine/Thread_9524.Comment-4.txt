i have also seen this type of problem when more than one cd burning program is loaded on some machines.
they seem to cancel each other out.
i got the feeling from your post(maybe wrongly) that you just added a dvd player or burner and it added cd creator.
along with the gurus suggestions, it's something to consider.
good luck.
chuck p.s.
there is a (not new) upgrade for nero 5.5
