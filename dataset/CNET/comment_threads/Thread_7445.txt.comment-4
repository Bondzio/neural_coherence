That's called an advanced Windows repair.
If we are lucky to catch it soon enough we can use System Restore.
If we let it go we know we can try the usuals like &quot;XP REPAIR INSTALL&quot; as well as installing the drivers for the machine in the CORRECT ORDER.
I find many still can't write down the right order.
Since I clone the OS to another drive I can test this on the copy without endangering the original.

For a price, Dell or Microsoft can provide more support about this than you may find on forums.
