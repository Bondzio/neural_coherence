<s> first of all, heres my computer. </s>
<s> http://www.shopdigitalonline.com/pr...p?productid=127 not sure how much info you can get from that but yea.... so right now im running a Nvidia Geforce4 MX 440, which from as much as i know, sucks. </s>
<s> i would very much like to upgrade but i dont think i know enough about it. </s>
<s> according to the info above [link], its a agp 4x card, so does that mean if i buy an 8x card it wont work on my pc? </s>
<s> im not sure, but i heard that the type of video card [performance and such], is limited by things like the processor speed and power supply. </s>
<s> what kind of card is good for me to upgrade to without having to upgrade anything else? </s>
<s> Lastly, what cards are good for me, and within the $40-$100 price range. </s>
<s> I wish to stick with nvidia cause thats already what i have. </s>
<s> and i might have to purchase this on the internet because its cheaper and all, but im not sure. </s>
<s> for one thing, my parents arent fans of internet shopping. </s>
<s> second, if for some reason i get the card and it doesnt work, im screwed. </s>
<s> third, there isnt anyone to ask for help when buying the card. </s>
<s> are largely limited by three factors: 1) What can the motherboard support in video options? </s>
<s> 2) What do you want out of the upgrade? </s>
<s> 3) How much can you spend? </s>
<s> Your link is busted, so the mainboard info is not available. </s>
<s> You have not said what you want to do, and prices can be found here: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ThirdCategoryList.jsp?SecondCategoryCode=0122 This is a safe and reliable site, in my opinion. </s>
