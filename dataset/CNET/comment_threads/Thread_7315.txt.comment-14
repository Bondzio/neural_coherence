at my age.
I'd trade retirement with you for your age.
;-) When I was in high school my 1st job was a pin setter in a bowling alley, lasted about 3 weeks, then stocker/bagger/carry-out at a grocery store, then a usher at a vehicle drive in theater, for $2 a night and watch all the great movies free.
Saved enough to buy my 1st old Ford vehicle.
My son worked as a fry cook at Taco Bell while in high school.
