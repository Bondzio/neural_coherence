Agree with Bob , however that drive is sold as a USB/Firewire external so there are two possibilities.
You can try a USB splitter cable that has two plugs that plug into two of yourusb ports and deliver the sum of the two ports' output to your device.
I have been using this arrangement for over a year with no problems.However in the event that your laptop can't put out enough juice you can get a very small USB adapter that you connect to one of the cable branches while the other plugs into your computer for data transfer.
I think you'll find the first arrangement will work for you as an inexpensive approach Regards Seewart
