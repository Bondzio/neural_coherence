hi gmartin2r; both you,&quot;skippie d333&quot; and et-al, seem to have the situation in order.
i (we), thank you for taking the time to despense knowledge to us great unwashed masses.
i am reading,taking notes, looking for common denominators and such stuff.
the cutting edge of any technology is old tomorrow.
i started my &quot;next machine&quot; back in nov. i want a portable and reliable unit that i will use only for imageing processes and sound files.
photoshop runs well on my current system but i have times where the delay/lag (12-20 sec.)
is not good.
i have started with a &quot;antec,aria mtx case, w/ 300w power supply.
i don't know if this ps is of the quality of the products they sell for large units.
if i run into heat/voltage problems they may provide a replacement or &quot;pcpower and cooling&quot; may be of some help.
i purchased a &quot;msi&quot; km4m-v(socket a), board from new egg, one of the primary considerations was the availability of having 4 internal usb terminals for the image card(s)and usb terminals on the front.
i plan on an additional sound card, i am not sure if i need a high end video card but i wish to end up with using two monitors,(one for image,the other for ps work pallets.
my question,,, help me with(amd)cpu choices.
they go from $45.00 to $4500.00.
i think that i have given ya all enough data with regards to the end use of this machine,any responses are welcome.
the issue of going for the lowest available product choice is never a wise decision.
was it john glenn who commented, &quot;we are sitting on a bomb that was built by the lowest bidder&quot;.
thank you daviepoo.
