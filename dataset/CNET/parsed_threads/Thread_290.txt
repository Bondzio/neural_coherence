<s> I remember about 2 years ago when SATA HD's really started to sell many started prophesizing the downfall of PATA HD's... SATA drives had a faster interface and SATA cables kept cases neater. </s>
<s> Going through retailers now I see that PATA drives still dominate the shelf space... and manufacturers are still producing larger and better models. </s>
<s> My question is, why is this? </s>
<s> Is it simply that SATA has not matured enough and has not garnered enough support from PC manufacturers? </s>
<s> Has the lack of movement towards SATA in optical drives simply made it easier for manufacturers to stay with PATA? </s>
<s> Or, is it just that the performance increases in SATA are too low to justify the expense of completely switching over to their production? </s>
<s> XP doesn't install nicely to it. </s>
<s> You should share why you think Microsoft doesn't have SATA support in their current OS. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> most new PCs support more SATA hard drives than PATA drives. </s>
<s> new intel mobos only have 1 ide channel that's really only intended for optical drives. </s>
<s> there's still a bunch of PCs with plenty of IDE ports available so PATA drives will still be on shelves for a while. </s>
<s> as for cd/dvd drives, moving to SATA is pure expense and doesn't bring any performance boost to the table. </s>
<s> there's very little profit margin in cd/dvd burners so there's little incentive to move to SATA. </s>
<s> still, SATA dvd burners do exist. </s>
<s> when bluray/hd-dvd drives start picking up steam, that's probably when the switch to SATA will take place. </s>
