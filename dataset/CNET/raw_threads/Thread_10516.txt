It says, &quot;no internet access.&quot; This is confusing, because I can hard wire it to my modem and it works okay, so it is not the ISP. But, we have another computer and sometimes it will work on there, and we have a Roku and it works on there sometimes. So, this is not consistant. Today I went to Linksys and downloaded the latest firmware update and installed that. I still have the same problem. --- &quot;no internet access.&quot; Any suggestions? Thanks, I'm going bananas!

However, this afternoon when I felt really desperate I found the CD that came with the router and ran it to set it up again. At first it didn't work, then I ran the troubleshooting part and after a few things it began to work again. I'm so happy right now you wouldn't believe it. I've spent all day on this stupid thing. So, thanks for your help, and if I get stuck again I'll be back. Blessings.
