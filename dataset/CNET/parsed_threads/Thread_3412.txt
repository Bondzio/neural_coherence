<s> I am building an intel computer with mobo D865GBF with a Pent. </s>
<s> 4 2.6, OCZ 1Gb PC 3200 running in dual channel mode, WD Raptor 36, onboard video, and I am not getting any video. </s>
<s> I beleive the cpu is not dead, b/c after removing the fan header, the heatsink warms up. </s>
<s> I am getting no POST beeps, the HD Light and Power light lights up, but thats as far as it goes. </s>
<s> I have installed a new power supply (Antec True 430), and have all the connections in place. </s>
<s> I have removed a stick of memory, removed all the perfs. </s>
<s> including the HD, FD, and still nothing yet. </s>
<s> I have even removed all the memory completely to see if I get a memory POST beep, and I do (Three long ones). </s>
<s> Than as soon as I put the memory back in, I go right back to square one. </s>
<s> I even added a Matrox AGP video, maybe thinking that the default BIOS is AGP, and not On-board, but it is not. </s>
<s> I still get no video, and more importantly, no POST beeps with the memory installed. </s>
<s> I have a green diode lit up on the motherboard, indicating MoBo power. </s>
<s> Is it possible that the memory is shot? </s>
<s> What about the MoBo? </s>
<s> Processor? </s>
<s> I would think that if it were the MoBo or Processor, I wouldn't get any POST if I take out the memory. </s>
<s> These are all brand new parts. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> The Sony monitor does nothing. </s>
<s> I have even tried putting back in the old AGP Matrox video card. </s>
<s> I have reset the CMOS, took out the battery, removed and reset the CPU. </s>
<s> Still nothing. </s>
<s> Please help! </s>
<s> ! </s>
