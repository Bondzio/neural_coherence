i may have lost a turn but you sound unreasonably peeved, and anyway your post in the referenced top thread says: &quot;this post is mostly for missing drive letters and not corrupt drives.
for this to apply your usb stick or drive works fine in other machines.
that is, all machines but yours.&quot; i had stated that i have already tried my unrecognised usb stick on one another machines with no luck.
as regards: &quot;a shame because we could be discussing if linux boot cds found it or not.&quot; i tried the ubuntu bootable cd without luck, either: no sign of any usb devices there, unless i should have looked in some mysterious location that i missed.
drink something mild to soothe your bruised nerves.
cheers.
