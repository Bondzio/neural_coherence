i am having a problem with this burner.
i'm using dvdfab 6 to burn movies, the drive reads the movie just fine but when it gets to the stage of burning the temp file the drive won't recognize the blank media.
it's a dual layer and i've tried ridata and maxell discs but still no recognition.
can anyone shed some light on this.
i'm using amd athlon 3000, 2.1 ghz, windows xp.
