<s> Hey all, I am currently in the market for a multi-purpose monitor. </s>
<s> I have 2 main priorities with this purchase -- I am a graphic designer, so I need a monitor that will display color accurately when used in conjunction with my PC. </s>
<s> However, I am also planning to double it as a gaming HDTV of sorts by using the HDMI input with my PS3. </s>
<s> Ive done a decent amount of research (Cnet, PCMag and PCWorld reviews + User reviews on Amazon, Cnet, Newegg, etc) into this and feel I have narrowed down my options to 4 different, potential monitors that suit my needs. </s>
<s> Im definitely open to other options, but these are the 4 Ive narrowed it down to: 1) </s>
<s> But not one seem to have accurate color. </s>
<s> Even today to achieve this we need ONE MORE THING. </s>
<s> Let me share a link to the Pantone Huey at http://www.amazon.com/Pantone-MEU113-huey-Pro/dp/B000OFC1YY I'm unsure how else you could achieve accurate color. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Oh, excellent! </s>
<s> That looks like a great little device. </s>
<s> I'll definitely look into it. </s>
<s> You make a good point about it being hard to achieve perfect color acuity. </s>
<s> I guess I should add that my main purposes for the monitor will be entertainment related. </s>
<s> I will be doing graphic work on it as well, but am most concerned about how it will perform as both an HD console gaming TV and high-def PC monitor. </s>
<s> I'm currently doing PC work on a 5-6 year old old Sony SD monitor with VGA connectivity only. </s>
<s> Time for a major upgrade. </s>
<s> When I look at games and such I'll want to avoid smearing so let's use a little math to find out what milliseconds could be needed. </s>
<s> REMEMBER THAT ALL THE NUMBERS are from on to HALF WAY OFF. </s>
<s> So a super WHITE dot to black on your average 8 mS LCD is actually not black at 8 mS but half way there. </s>
<s> And in another 8 about half way again. </s>
<s> Another factor is the screen temperature or more accurately the room temperature. </s>
<s> A very cold room, say 55F will result in smears and it gets better as the display warms up. </s>
<s> Many makers don't reveal at what temperature they do the tests. </s>
<s> It does matter. </s>
<s> Ok let's see what milliseconds we need to start with a common 60 Hz display. </s>
<s> I get 16.67 mS per frame. </s>
<s> So 8 mS should be our goal. </s>
<s> Any faster and you must be a fighter pilot in his prime to spot the dot. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Awesome, thanks! </s>
<s> Well, the good news is that all 4 of the options I listed above have 2ms Response Time (save one, which has 5ms). </s>
<s> So no matter which I choose, I'm assuming there should be little to no ghosting/smearing at all while gaming. </s>
<s> But the question remains...based on overall dollar to performance ratio, etc, which is the better option in the end? </s>
<s> Another thing Im trying to take into account is simply how they &quot;look&quot; while displaying visual content. </s>
<s> Contrast, tones, etc -- which is something you can really only gauge in person... </s>
<s> So, Im hoping someone around has actually seen or owns one or some of these monitors and can advise to buy it or against it. </s>
<s> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ghcewg8yjE for example. </s>
<s> I'd still want to see it in person but I've picked up a few displays and the last check point for me would be to dismiss any older CCFL models. </s>
<s> Go LED. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Do you have any LED recommendations? </s>
<s> I haven't run into many pure LED display monitors on the market that weren't ridiculously expensive. </s>
<s> The technology is being tough here. </s>
<s> LED LCD today means LED backlight to the LCD screen. </s>
<s> CCFL (see google) is a bit dated and I'd pass on those. </s>
<s> You listed the Samsung LED LCD and you can find youtube reviews to see what others say. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Personally I will suggest CRT monitor if colors are important to you. </s>
<s> IMO CRT is still the best when dealing with graphics. </s>
