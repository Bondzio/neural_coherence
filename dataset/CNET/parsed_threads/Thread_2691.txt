<s> I want to set up a Home network between a Win XP PRO/LINUX UBUNTU 10.10(Dual boot) and a Win XP PRO. </s>
<s> I need to find out: A) The IP address of: 1) Each machine on the router 2) The router's IP address B) How to configure the router using this information Several years ago I saw a tech set up a network using this information but I don't remember how to do it C) What software I can use on Ubuntu to set up the network </s>
<s> I assume you have a working network ? </s>
<s> More than likely the router is providing the IP addresses to all the machines. </s>
<s> You technically don't need the address of the router since the data will pass directly between the machines. </s>
<s> You also don't need to do any configuration on the router to make it work. </s>
<s> You only need to change the router when you want to share outside your house..not a good idea. </s>
<s> So open a command prompt on each machine and issue IPCONFIG. </s>
<s> It will tell you the IP of each machine. </s>
<s> You also get the router address on this, it should be the default gateway. </s>
<s> Most people use Samba to share microsoft files. </s>
<s> Many times this is already installed. </s>
<s> People have videos on u-tube showing how to install it. </s>
