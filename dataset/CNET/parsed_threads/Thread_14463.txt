<s> I've been having an issue with my computer lately, it started out happening very little, now its happening basically each time I start, and wake up from sleep mode on my computer. </s>
<s> Here's the issue, if I put my computer in sleep mode, it wakes up, the fans come on, but there's no display on the monitor, I have to hold the power button down and reboot. </s>
<s> The computer doesn't have any display after I reboot. </s>
<s> I have to keep rebooting the machine, like 20 times to get it to work.. Any idea on what the problem is? </s>
<s> I'm thinking it's the video card, or maybe the motherboard. </s>
<s> Sometimes the screen flashes black, and a message pops up saying &quot;Video card driver stopped responding, but recovered.&quot;, or something like that, also, the computer freezes at times, and the same thing happens with no display. </s>
<s> Oh, and sometimes when this happens, there's no beeps when attempting to start the machine. </s>
<s> Thanks Oh, and here's the specs. </s>
<s> Sparkle 9600 GT 2gb 4Gb's Ram Phenom 9950 quad-core Asus M3N72-D Motherboard Windows Vista 64 Bit </s>
<s> Are you sure its in sleep mode? </s>
<s> or hibernate? </s>
<s> when i had this problem with my dv2213cl the support agent told me it was caused by a boot issue, it just would not boot out of hibernate or sleep long story short i had to send the computer to be serviced and they ended up missing the commitment date and i had to end up calling them only to be told that they found nothing wrong with the computer ( but that they were working to fix the problem) well it came back with something that did not need to be fixed and the problem still was the same i had to end up re imaging the hard disk to make it work again to sum it up i was out of a computer for little over a month since it was being fixed by support.. good luck .. </s>
<s> I'm having the same problem, except I don't use sleep mode, it's just when I boot it up. </s>
<s> I've found out a few things about it: one, if I reseat everything it stops having the issue, but that's temporary and it will soon start doing it again more frequently, and two, when I kick it right after I boot it it has a better chance of starting up, but I really don't like doing that because it's potentially harmful to the hardware. </s>
<s> Even so, this tells me something is seated incorrectly or loosely, but if that's the case I can't figure out what it is because I've gone through every connection on the board, a few times each, and they all seem to be fine. </s>
<s> I can't send it to be repaired because it's a custom, but right now I'm pretty stumped and I can't find any help, and this is the first thread I've come across which has the problem I'm having. </s>
<s> Please, if anyone knows how to fix this, share. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> @nancy Oh I forgot to say, I reimaged the harddisk a few times, it's not helping. </s>
<s> I found out a few things today, I have a few IM programs that auto start when windows boots, I had my friend see if I signed onto the the instant messenger, to see If my computer even made it to windows, and he said I logged on, so obviously windows is booting. </s>
<s> I'm guessing this is a problem with the graphics card.. </s>
