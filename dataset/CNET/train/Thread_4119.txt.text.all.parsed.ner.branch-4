15149	30	374122	3201229	3200767	flatworm	12/19/09 5:05 am	1.2611991e12	stab in the dark	have you considered the possibility that the problem may not be with the video card but with the computer itself? if you're using an old p4 then i presume that your computer is... (how shall i put this?) mature. in recent weeks i have seen a problem that i did not expect on two xp computers that came to me for repair. both users were online gamers. on both computers, everything checked out on every diagnostic test i could run. although some of the drivers and firmware were older versions, none of that should have caused any problem. it turned out that both were infected by unknown viruses, and both viruses successfully evaded the anti-virus applications that were installed on the machines (freeware avira in one case and rather expensive norton 360 on the other, both fully up to date). both computers had slowed significantly and none of the usual fixes (av scans, spyware removal, disk and system area defrags using perfectdisk, registry cleaning and optimization, free space wiping) sped them up appreciably. rootkit scanning using various tools did not reveal any problem. my fix worked nicely, but it was a very drastic, last-resort fix -- a complete wipe of the disk and reload of the o/s and all latest drivers, including flashing the bios with the latest version. now they run like (actually better than) new, but restoring all the data and applications (except the garbage stuff) took a couple of days in each instance. sometimes computers are affected by hardware problems, but these problems almost always manifest themselves more drastically than mere performance slowdowns. they more usually cause problems like crashes, endless reboot cycles, or refusal to boot at all. i would look to a software issue, and that is not necessarily good news for you.
