<s> When I first got my HP Pavilion it worked like a charm. </s>
<s> I installed Norton 360 and soon after that little things started to happen. </s>
<s> Finally, the computer started to reboot at what seemed random times. </s>
<s> I had the computer checked out by a 'professional' who was only able to slightly improve the computer's performance. </s>
<s> He took out Norton 360 claiming that it was damaging some parts of the operating system, Windows XP Entertainment Edition. </s>
<s> I really don't want to reinstall the operating system, as I have installed some free software that is no longer available. </s>
<s> Lately, when I try to turn off the computer via 'RUN etc', the computer reboots. </s>
<s> I have to resort to turning off the computer via front panel switch. </s>
<s> I use the computer for work and don't really want to have much down time. </s>
<s> Any help I can get in this regard will be most appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>

<s> Try to fix it. </s>
<s> Read this link -&gt; http://www.aumha.org/win5/a/shtdwnxp.php 2. </s>
<s> Don't shutdown, HIBERNATE. </s>
<s> That's what I do now since it boots faster in the morning and the power is off so to me there is no downside and plenty of upside. </s>
<s> Good luck, Bob PS. </s>
<s> I'm not a good person to talk to about Norton. </s>
<s> I too only see it's dark side. </s>
<s> Bob, Thanks fot your prompt post. </s>
<s> It is interesting that you mention HIBERNATE. </s>
<s> This moring I came in and found the computer was on, HIBERNATING(?). </s>
<s> I know I turned it off with the front panel button whem I last used it. </s>
<s> The computer came right up wituout the long powerup wait. </s>
<s> Ralph. </s>
<s> Over in Control Panel, Power the power button can be set to Sleep, Shutdown or Hibernate. </s>
<s> I use the Hibernate feature. </s>
