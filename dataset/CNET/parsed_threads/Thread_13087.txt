<s> I would like to upgrade my video for this current retail Gateway system I have. </s>
<s> Currently I have a nVidia Geoforce 7300LE, with a 300 W power supply. </s>
<s> What would be the best video card I would get still using the 300 watt power supply? </s>
<s> What are the other specifications of the machine? </s>
<s> The most I could say would be a 8600GT. </s>
<s> Maybe a 8600GTS, but that might be pushing it. </s>
<s> ~Ibrahim~ </s>
<s> I have a 19 inch monitor, Intel Core 2 duo E6300 chip. </s>
<s> Not too many hard drives/optical drives? </s>
<s> How much memory, by chance? </s>
<s> Doesn't effect power usage hardly any, but good to check, anyways. </s>
<s> I assume you'll be using 1280x1024 or below as a standard resolution, right? </s>
<s> I would say an 8600GTS would be the absolute maximum. </s>
<s> I'm a wee bit afraid it actually might be too much. </s>
<s> The 8600GT is slower, yet draws less power. </s>
<s> Actually, scratch that. </s>
<s> The 8600GTS requires external power, which I'm not sure that PSU includes. </s>
<s> Of course, you could get adapters and such, but I'd feel safer with the 8600GT. </s>
<s> &quot;It [8600GTS] is designed to draw about 71 watts of power during operation. </s>
<s> The GeForce 8600 GT is significantly slower, but also uses significantly less power. </s>
<s> It is designed to consume 43 watts and ...&quot; Check out this review: http://tinyurl.com/2otuuj between both the cards. </s>
<s> ~Ibrahim~ P.S. </s>
<s> I'm not very up to date on the HD2xxx series by ATI, maybe someone can shed some light on those? </s>
<s> My system was bought last October, so it is not old. </s>
<s> Duo 2 Core chip, with nVidia 7300LE card, and 2 GB ram, 300 watt power supply. </s>
<s> I wonder if I could replace the video card with the following: nVidia 7800 or 7900 series. </s>
<s> thx </s>
<s> those cards are pushing the limits of the power supply. </s>
<s> I think most if not all of those cards require a external power supply, which means they draw more than the 75W that the slot itself can provide. </s>
<s> It isn't a particularly heavily taxed system, but 300W doesn't seem like enough. </s>
<s> Most those cards require a 350W minimum. </s>
<s> I'm really sorry... What resolution are you running, per chance? </s>
<s> The 7600GT is a great deal right now and the 8600GT isn't a bad card, either. </s>
<s> The 8600GTS is not too much slower than the 7800GT, but the 8600GT is. </s>
<s> Kind of confusing, but check out these charts: http://www23.tomshardware.com/graphics_2007.html?modelx=33&model1=854&model2=716&chart=287 Unfortunately, they don't include the 8600GT! </s>
