my maxtor 120gb usb external hard drive installation evoked &quot;new hardware found&quot; message however when i display my computer page the external hard drive (e) not recognized but device manager lists it with no problems and working.
the first time i added this drive it was recognized an i could use it then after about 48 hours it's spontaneously disappears from my computer page.
i found the same action when i moved this external drive to another computer, worked for awhile the disappears.
os is windows xp.
