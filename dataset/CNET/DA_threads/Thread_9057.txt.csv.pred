1.1.1	Hello I have microsoft 's bluetooth desktop keyboards and mouse set , the shingle which comes with the set is connected to one of the four USB 2.0 ports on the motherboard .	St
1.1.2	now here 's the problem .	St
1.1.3	I have two OS on my system , windows xp professional and windows vista business , when starting the machine , cold boot , we usually come across the initial screen where RAMs are counted and then comes the screen where we have to choose between the two OS systems , now here 's the catch , during all that time , no matter how much I tried to use my keyboard to choose an operation system or even go into the boot screen , using the del or esc keys , nothing happens .	St
1.1.4	I end up connecting another microsoft keyboard that has both a USB and serial connection , through the serial connection only , where the system responds , and moves on to open the OS windows for me .	St
1.1.5	can someone tell me why does this happen , why does n't the system respond to my bluetooth keyboard ?	Ques
1.2.1	Some do , some do n't .	St
1.2.2	It 's a BIOS issue .	St
1.2.3	If your BIOS does , it 's in some menu and may have words like USB , Keyboard , Mouse and/or Emulation .	St
1.2.4	But you elected to tell nothing about the host machine so this is all I can offer .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thank you Bob for the reply I & quot ; m using a gigabyte GA-8IPE775 , based on intel 's 865pe chipset , with a 3.2 Pentium 4 HT processor , its old I know , but its bios has support for USB keyboard , and USB mouse , and even an optoin called support for Legacy USB storage devices .	St
1.3.2	When I connected a USB keyboard to the computer it worked fine , but when I connect the bluetooth keyboard through the shingle it does n't work at all .	St
1.3.3	so the question is does a keyboard that connect to the computer using bluetooth shingle , should work like a USB keyboard connected directly to the PC ?	Ques
1.3.4	regards ashraf kadry	St
1.4.1	I 'd pack it up and return it since the other USB products works .	St
1.4.2	Looks like someone pushed out a product that needed more work .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	not only does it not work during startup , but its a game of luck when it comes to working under the windows environment , where sometimes the lags coming from the keyboard and the mouse seem like forever .	St
1.5.2	Thank you again Bob , truely appreciate it.. regards ashraf kadry	St
