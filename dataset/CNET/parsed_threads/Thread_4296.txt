<s> Do you really need a seperate hard drive for your Windows operating system? </s>
<s> I do light video editing and light gaming, some people say to seperate the OS to a another drive. </s>
<s> Such is easy to answer since most run the OS, applications and more on one hard disk. </s>
<s> Not needed or required. </s>
<s> The proof is all around us. </s>

<s> I'm a strong proponent for separating the OS and APPS (C:) from the data (D:) even if they're just partitions on the same hard disk drive. </s>
<s> This makes it easier to do backups because the partitions are smaller (only OS and APPs vs OS APPs and DATA) and makes it safer to recover from a system crasj because your data is isolated on D: To faciliate backups, restores and minimize downtime ...I always put a second drive in every system I build to store my backups of C: and D: </s>
