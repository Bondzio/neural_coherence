1.1.1	I have a 3.5&quot; samsung hdd from a computer that was dead and converted it to a external hard drive but when i tried to format with Easus partition software i got an error message that the format could not be completed and a second later a message that the USB storage driver could not be detected since then i have tried many ways to connect the external hdd but it's not recognized since then.	St
1.1.2	Any ideas of what could it be and how could i solve it.	St
1.1.3	Thanks in advance.	St
1.2.1	Why not use the partion and format tools that Windows offers?	St
1.2.2	I can't be specific here as I can't find which OS.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I am using Windows 7 and i couldn't use the windows tool because i wanted to create 2 partitions, one with like 100GB in FAT32 so i could use it to backup my PS3 data while the rest of the hdd in NTFS.	St
1.3.2	Since there are limitations for FAT32 partitions when using the windows tool i had to use another partition software.	St
1.4.1	Such details would change my answer to &quot;Use GPARTED.&quot; Bob	St
1.5.1	Well the problem is not my partition software but the hdd, while formatting and creating the partitions for it i received an error that the process couldn't be completed and then it stopped being recognized by the PC.	St
1.5.2	Everytime i connect the hdd i receive a message saying that the USB driver could not be installed however it was working before i made the format and partition processes.	St
1.6.1	Runs from CD I wouldn't get such a message from that.	St
1.6.2	Are you sure you tried GPARTED?	St
1.6.3	It's fairly simple as it has a mouse interface and well, it's what I would use next.	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	I'll try that and post my results.	Sug
1.7.2	Thanks a lot.	St
