Specs: Two laptops running Windows Vista x86 Belkin G Wireless Router Cable internet with at least 6mbps connection When one laptop is running Skype, MSN, Chrome, and MMORPG, the second has significant difficulty accessing the Internet via any web browser - slow speed, lag, pages hanging, unable to load, etc.
It doesn't matter if the second laptop is connected first to the Internet, adding the second, especially with the IM programs and/or the MMORPG causes the issues with the second laptop.
I don't have a lot of knowledge regarding home networks/networking as my knowledge trends more towards the hardware/software aspects of computer function.
