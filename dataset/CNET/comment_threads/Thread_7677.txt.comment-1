I have AT&T PantechP4100 Android 4.0.4 OS Tablet and Apple 3GS IPhone.
I have downloaded the following apps on my tablet: BATCH UNINSTALLER; CLEANMASTER; LOOKOUT v8.24-59c0ddc; & Android's new MALWAREBYTES.ANTIMALWARE.
I'm not sure but I think this might be security overkill.
I need to know the necessary security, cleaner instl/uninstl apps that I need to keep and/or overlap and I need to delete?
Please help!
We lost our PC to very big Virus, Malware attack last summer, so I only have this tablet and my IPhone for the internet now and don't want to be unprotected or overprotected (if that's possible).
I sync my photos, contacts and some other data with my IPhone.
Any help is appreciated.
