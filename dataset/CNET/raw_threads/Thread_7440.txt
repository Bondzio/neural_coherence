The system seems to install it fine, the Device Manager sees it and says that it is working. It shows up when I click &quot;Safely Remove Hardware&quot;. When I try to use it or find it in Windows Explorer or &quot;Administrative Tools&quot; it isn't there. I also tried to find it with &quot;Partition Magic&quot; 8.0, no luck.

They had connected the drive to USB 1.1 ports and the USB case only worked fully on USB 2.0 ports. Another forum member had moved a drive with data into the USB case and the contents vanished. Put it back in a PC and there it was again. Lesson? You must prepare said drive in the USB case. Use the DISK MANAGEMENT TOOL. Bob
10130	2	55378	660382	660332	gbvoris	1/6/05 5:59 AM	1.10499114E12	Twice Over	If, by &quot;DISK MANAGEMENT TOOL.&quot;, you mean the one available through &quot;ADMINISTRATIVE TOOLS&quot; in XP; then been there done that. It doesn't see it. I do have a USB 2 device and I do receive a message that it will work better in a faster port. Where thet at????? I have 2 ports on the front and 4 on the back, I've tried other devices in all of them and get the same message for everthing. Could it be some weird thing with a driver? One possible option would be if I could get the pci device to work right, I have one that gives me a front panel with 5 USB and 3 firewire ports. I cannot get it to work since I had to reinstall XP, XP installed drivers and it won't update to the OEM drivers.

This will never happen. You or that person need to find the USB 2.0 (and motherboard) support package for your system and install it. YOU'VE FOUND THE CAUSE OF THIS ISSUE! More at http://usbman.com/USB%202%20News.htm I'd give up a link to your motherboard driver package but I missed it if you posted the required information. Bob

To find the motherboard driver package for your machine, I'd have to find the make/model of the PC or if it's some custom job, the make/model of the motherboard. I re-read the entire thread and you never revealed such. Looks like who installed this OS didn't finish it proper for you. Bob

10130	9	55378	661338	660519	gbvoris	1/6/05 12:19 PM	1.10501394E12	Tried it	I downloaded the 4in1, usb, and video drivers. I have installed from their cd and the downloads. same thing. I built this animal and it DID work fine, it's just with the reinstall of XP it messed up. I do have an error with the &quot;NEC PCI to USB Open Host Controller&quot; I tried the NEC site and they aim me at Microsoft, no help there. As I said I do have a pci device with 5 USB 2 ports and three firewire ports; it doesn't work either. The model is F 2007 made by Koutech.com.

I finally got it to recognize it by changing the drive letter to a letter before the first drives letter. Then I turned off both drives uninstalled the software,rebooted, reinstalled software, rebooted turned on the drives and my computer recognized it finally. To do this right click on my computer,right click on manage,right click on disk management, expand page so you can see everything and right click on the drive you want to change letter.
