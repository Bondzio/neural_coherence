I have an internal seagate 100gb hdd ata 100. so I assum it's a eide or pata. cpu specs: intel celeron D 352, 3.20ghz/533mhz fsb, nvidia 8400 gs 512mb video card, 2gb ram, dvd rom/cd r+w, 10/100 ethernet 512kb l2cache. I had installed a wd 320gb, worked for a while but kept going in and out. I put ubuntu on it and it recogzied the 320gb but couldn't play any our of pc games. I have been looking for a seagate 500gb to put in but can't find one. When I tried to install the WD, it said no hard drive found. So I thought maybe it was a compatibilty issue between manufactuers. anyone have any suggestions. Thanks

I find most folk try to avoid learning such and end up at repair counters. Be sure to tell all about these two items and my hint is to use the newer 80 conductor cable next time. Bob

Proffitt	4/4/11 10:13 AM	1.30191198E12	Let's say you know an 80 conductor cable when you see one	Then you would know that on CS and if you can't accept CS then only the SLAVE setting is acceptable on the middle connector on 80 conductor IDE. But then again I'm duplicating the web on that. Bob
