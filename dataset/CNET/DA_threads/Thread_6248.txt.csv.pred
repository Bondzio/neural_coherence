1.1.1	For several new , built-up desktop computers , I 've been offered the choice of upgrading from a Dual Core chip to a Core 2 Duo for $ 60 ( before bargaining ) .	St
1.1.2	Would that be money well spent or is the performance difference not that great ?	Ques
1.1.3	Are there other considerations in making the choice in these chip types ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	if all you 'll be using the PC for is web browsing and email , you probably wo n't notice any difference .	St
1.2.2	but if you 're using microsoft office , rip CDs or DVDs , edit photos and videos , or watch high-definition video , the $ 60 upgrade will probably be worthwile .	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	email , web : no difference Office , rip CD/DVD : buy it , worth your $ 60 Gaming/HiDef videos : better performance , but $ 60 on a graphics card will be felt more	St
1.5.1	Thanks .	Polite

1.5.3	.	St
1.5.4	right now I think I only would need the faster chip for burning DVDs , some CorelDraw-type graphics , large slide shows , and sometimes working with 5 or more web browser tabs and/or work programs open at once .	St
1.5.5	So from this thread 's replies , I thought I would get the Core 2 Duo .	St
1.5.6	However , regarding the graphics card , I thought I would downgrade what is being offered on this built-up computer .	St
1.5.7	The original offer gives a G-Force 512 Mb PC-X card .	St
1.5.8	However , the shop guy said I could probably do without that and just use the on-board graphics from the Mboard , a & quot ; Gigabyte & quot ; GA-G31M-S2C .	St
1.5.9	I would save $ 60 .	St
1.5.10	What do you think ?	Ques
1.5.11	The thing is I do n't play complex games on my computers .	St
1.5.12	Thanx .	St
1.6.1	playback of any high def video .	St
1.6.2	if you do n't plan on watching video on the pc , then feel free to downgrade to the built-in intel graphics .	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
