1.1.1	I have just purchased an external floppy drive for my desktop ( vista ) , when I try to view a floppy disk that whas created on my laptop ( XP ) it tells me that the floppy needs formatting , of course this will delete all information on the floppy , when I did try to format on the desktop after a few seconds it tells me that Windows was unable to format , I need access to the information on the floppy , does anybody know what the problem is and how to fix it , Regards	St
1.2.1	If the floppy reads on other machines , this new drive is dead .	St
1.3.1	no , the drive works fine with a new floppy , i formatted a disk and saved work to it , it will not read the floppy disks that were formatted on my lapyop	St
1.4.1	Floppies are notoriously unreliable .	St
1.4.2	Certainly not suited for long-term storage .	St
1.4.3	But a good ( albeit somewhat oldfashioned , slow and low capacity ) way to transfer files between machines that do n't have Internet or USB .	St
1.4.4	All you can try : read the diskette on your laptop and see if that recognizes it .	Sug
1.4.5	That 's not impossible , although unlikely .	St
1.4.6	Then transfer the data using mail or USB-stick .	St
1.4.7	This is the umpteenth ( if not more ) proof that having data on one place only is an invitation to the gods of IT to destroy it and lose it .	St
1.4.8	Kees	St
1.5.1	There are some worms that alter the boot area of floppies and you get this sort of complaint .	St
1.5.2	But if new diskettes work fine and diskettes from other machines are fine but not from this laptop then you found the problem .	St
