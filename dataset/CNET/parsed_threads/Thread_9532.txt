<s> Recently, my mouse began to frequently require that I relocate its plug from its current usb port to another. </s>
<s> IOW, I often start up or reboot my desktop PC to find no mouse pointer until I move the mouse plug to a different port. </s>
<s> Its only a standard 2-key scrolling-wheel usb mouse and my desktop has 2 onboard usb 2.0 ports and a 4-port usb 2.0 pci card. </s>
<s> The mouse seems to work ok with all 6 of these ports, but must often be switched over from 1 port to another. </s>
<s> BTW, my PC is a home-built desktop with an AMD Athlon XP 2200+ and 2GB DDR RAM, and my OS is Win2K-Pro that runs on NTFS format. </s>

<s> Well David it sounds like the mouse plug may be the culprit. </s>
<s> Check the plug and make sure nothing is caved in. </s>
<s> If you have another USB mouse squeeking around try it. </s>
<s> If not you may want to go to your nearest animal shelter and get a new one. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack p.s. </s>
<s> I'm really sorry. </s>
<s> I just couldn't resist! </s>
<s> Jack, I do have another standard 2-key scrolling-wheel mouse to use as a spare, but the one whose pointer keeps disappearing is my fav because it's chrome-plated and monogrammed. </s>
<s> Maybe I ought to just tell Shiney that if he doesn't stay in his room (usb port), he'll never see another piece of cheese. </s>
<s> Or, I could say that if he'll be good, I'll take him to the Green Bay Packers' web site once a day. </s>
<s> --David </s>
<s> I just don't know what to say...chrome plated?? </s>
<s> I gotta see this!! </s>
<s> Where'd you find a chrome plated mouse?? </s>
<s> Or did you buy a generic and send it out to your local machine shop for chroming.. </s>
<s> I could have to real fun with this but... Maybe you could transfer the chrome?? </s>
<s> Is the shiny side up or down? </s>
<s> I mean..what can I say?? </s>
<s> This proves a point (I never made)..even chrome plated mice are subject to failure and must climb the chrome stairway to heaven. </s>
<s> and life goes on...(except for chrome plated mice) Jack </s>
