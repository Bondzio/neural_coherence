Currently my network is set up with static IP's and do not want to change this, is it possible to set up a wireless network where DHCP is only enabled for the computer accessing through the wireless conection? Also what hardware is required, is it a wireless access point? Thanks.

However a WAP is just about the same price as a WIFI router, so replacing your router may be a great idea. But then again you can move the WAP closer to the warehouse. Bob
