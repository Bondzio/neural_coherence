Hello everybody, How are you doing?
I'm looking for the best wireless router that has the fastest speed and the best range.
I got confused with &quot;Belkin N1 Vision, netgear wndr3700, and linksys WRT610N&quot; I don't know what the best one is and I don't know what the best modem (ADSL2+) to connect with any of them is.
May any one advise me or help with that, please?
I'm looking for the best speed range modem (ADSL2+) no detachable BTW: I don't care about electricity and I need something no more than $500 My net speed is 4MB.
Warm regards,
