1.1.1	Hello I have two machines one PET CT scanner and other is also a medical machine and both are communicating via LAN .	St
1.1.2	There is an IP conflict between both the machines , But we are not able to find same IP any where in the machines , Could you please tell me is there any way to filter this IP conflict .	St
1.1.3	These macines are on the same network and also they have to communicate each other .	St
1.2.1	is complaining about the IP conflict ?	Ques
1.2.2	A router ?	Ques
1.2.3	LAN devices have what is called a MAC address , not an IP address .	St
1.2.4	A router interrogates each device , logs the MAC address , and assigns an IP address .	St
1.2.5	Tell us more about how these devices are connected and how you are seeing the address conflict .	St
1.3.1	Hello , In Hoaspital network both the machines are communicating through switches .	St
1.3.2	Actual problem is when I am putting both the machine togather on the network one of the machine is asking again and again for a restart .	St
1.3.3	So I am thinking this problem might be related to an IP conflict .	St
1.3.4	Please suggest me .	Sug
1.3.5	Both the machines have static IP addresses .	St
1.3.6	Thanks	Polite
1.4.1	Somewhere someone in IT ( if that is n't yourself ) should be keeping such records .	St
1.4.2	Simply change one device to a known unused address .	St
1.5.1	& quot ; So I am thinking this problem might be related to an IP conflict. & quot ; In other words , you 've not verified this to be the case .	St
1.5.2	What this leaves is that you you 've not really expressed what sort of problem you are having .	St
1.5.3	Now a PET scanner is n't something found everywhere .	St
1.5.4	These are specialty diagnostic tools used in cancer treatment and cost plenty of money .	St
1.5.5	I do n't know how they work or what sort of network connection is needed so will ask .	St
1.5.6	Is this a PC of some sort connected to the scanner that 's used to transmit images and/or other data for pathological review ?	Ques
1.5.7	If so , it has a professional operating system .	St
1.5.8	Maybe you could give more information about that and what sort of network it 's connected to .	St
1.5.9	You might also want add whether or not you are IT or a technician who operates the scanner and other medical devices in the facility .	St
1.5.10	This might help in offering the best advice or a referral .	Ques
1.6.1	Switches do not assign IP addresses .	St
1.6.2	Routers do .	St
1.6.3	Contact your IT department .	St
