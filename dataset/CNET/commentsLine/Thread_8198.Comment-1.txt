i am trying to help a friend with his old compaq presario 4660. when i install a modem into one of the pci slots i get this at the bootup screen, resource conflict - pci bus:00 device:03 function:00 its using pheonixbios 4.0 release 6.0.13 what might be the problem, the modem is the only thing hooked up to the expansion slots, ive tried both pci slots and nothin seems to work.
any help would be great thx.
