hi!
i have new internal sata ii hard disk i bought recently.
i made it only a back up or spare drive for my old ide hard disk (with os) and also for extra storage space.
i used the new hard disk for installing software applications, games and copying files to it.
for the first few days, it worked just fine from installing apps to copying files.
but one day when i install an application to this new disk, an error occured (delayed write failed) and the installation can't continue.
then the disk no longer appeared at my computer.
sometimes the disk is ok then sometimes the same problem occured.
i can say that the problem of the new disk is intermittent.
until one day the disk no longer appeared at bios.
so i decided to claim warranty for it because of this problem.
after a week, the vendor gave me a new replacement hard disk with same specs.
i installed the new disk and it went well.
after a few days, the same problem occured that the files cannot be copied (files become corrupted).
then a week after, the disk no longer appeared again at the bios or cannot be recognized.
my question is where does this problem really originated?
is my motherboard, sata port or the new hard disk is defective?
hope to help me with this.
thanks!
