<s> Hi I'm building my own PC and I require a suitable power supply. </s>
<s> The spec is: Pentium 4 @ 3.0Ghz GeForce Nvidia 6600GT 1 CD-DVD burner 2x hard drives a few usb devices 1 PCI card for video capture I think this will require no less than 350W. </s>
<s> A local shop has no 400W units but they do have a 500W unit on special offer (cheaper than the 350W they stock). </s>
<s> I was hoping to get a 400W unit. </s>
<s> Will it be OK to use a 500W unit even if it's full potential is not required? </s>
<s> Will it overload my motherboard??? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> a cheapie and can't deliver 500 watts continuously, it will have sufficient margin to handle your system easily. </s>
<s> Nowadays one must be certain if the power supply has all the connectors that you may need if you go in for the SLI type systems. </s>
<s> The new video cards need special power and connectors. </s>
<s> Make certain the the main mobo power connector is a combo 20/24 pin connector. </s>
<s> That way if you have a 20 pin you simply detach the extra four pins, but if you later upgrade to a new mobo that uses the 24 pin, you can simply reattach the extra four pins. </s>
<s> Ok I think I follow, however I don't know much about these things. </s>
<s> I have the motherboard already (an Intel 915GUX). </s>
<s> See pic (warning it's quite large): http://www.intel.com/design/motherbd/ux/pix/d915gux_lg.jpg The main power socket has 24 pins (left of pic). </s>
<s> There is also a square 4 pin socket and a rectangle 4 pin socket (right of pic). </s>
<s> Is there any special requirements I should look out for in the PSU? </s>
<s> the 12 volts that is now used to provide power to the CPU's regulators. </s>
<s> The mobo manual should describe what the other pins/sockets are for. </s>
<s> I'm not certain what the connector next to the 4 pin connector is for, the one that you say is 4 pin rectangular. </s>
<s> I assume that you have SATA connections, and newer power supplies all seem to supply a few power connections for SATA drives. </s>
<s> Great selection of supplies at http://www.newegg.com . </s>
<s> Consider getting one that takes an input AC voltage in the range of 80 VAC to 230 VAC automatically [no switch to select the voltage] it'll give extra protection against line voltage surges at the US 120VAC. </s>
<s> Here's a link to one [a one day special price. </s>
<s> LOL] http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817103937 </s>
<s> your LOCAL SHOP has a good price on a 500w unit...go for it. </s>
<s> If for some reason it does not fit you can bring it back to your LOCAL SHOP. </s>
<s> A larger than needed psu does no harm. </s>
<s> I'm in UK. </s>
<s> I do buy from the net. </s>
<s> Bought a small micro ATX &quot;P4&quot; case to find the power supply is 150W stamped Aug 2000. </s>
<s> The case is nice though. </s>
<s> Got to pay for a new PSU and want it ASAP. </s>
<s> Thanks, thats what I wanted to know. </s>
<s> All the best. </s>
<s> The motherboard has been used previously and didn't come with a manual. </s>
<s> Will look online for docs. </s>
<s> The square one has '12V PWR' printed next to it. </s>
<s> The rectangular one has '1x4 PWR' printed next to it and looks like the power socked on the back of optical drives (male connector - 4 pin). </s>
<s> I've noticed SATA printed on it somewhere (I'm at work so I can't look. </s>
<s> What is SATA? </s>
<s> Look at docs online. </s>
<s> The rectagle 4 pin power socket is the alternative power connector. </s>
<s> Just been reading up and I'm a whole lot wiser. </s>
<s> The 1x4 PWR is if the main power connector on the PSU is a 2x10 connector, the 1x4 is then required. </s>
<s> The 1x4 connector is not required with a 2x12 connector. </s>
<s> First of all, &quot;quality&quot; matters, cheap is cheap. </s>
<s> Get a namebrand psu of at least 400W+ or better. </s>
<s> If you buy a generic brand then get the highest wattage you can find to produce the most stable psu from any poor quality or just cheap make-up. </s>
<s> Namebrand psus tend to be stable for even less wattage than generic ones. </s>
<s> Having a high wattage psu will have its power demands available for the &quot;needed on demand&quot; usage as any excess will be available as required. </s>
<s> Read the specs as any psu should detail themselves via thier decal/sticker. </s>
<s> Understand, wattage output of the rated wattage is avilable but not for constant output, its only for &quot;peak&quot; usage and can't be sustained for extended periods will surely test the &quot;quality&quot; of any psu, thus more rated wattage is a plus. </s>
<s> Find the rated wattage, and expect at least 75% be available on a constant stable output. </s>
<s> Last, remember all devices are attached to the power output should a psu fail, the strong possibility exists that it may take with it any/all weak devices to include the mtrbd. </s>
<s> so keep that in mind. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Cheers Willy. </s>
<s> How will I know a good brand from a not so good brand? </s>
<s> Can you recommend some good brands please. </s>
<s> I've been looking at a brand called Q-Tec. </s>
<s> Are they any good? </s>
<s> Unfortunely there are so many brands, more than ever it can be pretty much a hassle. </s>
<s> I recommend Antec,Enermax, Vantec, and I believe Fortec or fortac. </s>
<s> The most trusted and reliable brand is PCPower&Cooling(very $) but darn good check thier website of same name. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
