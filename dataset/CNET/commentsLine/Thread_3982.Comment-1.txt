i have been in the market for a new computer and found a deal at costco (item #470094) for a hp a6857c-b desktop with 23&quot; 1080p monitor, 8gb ddr2, core 2 quad for $879.
it has vista, i am a current xp user, and i am wondering if i should wait for win 7. my current computer(dell circa 2002) is working fine, but i really would like to update my technology.
should i wait for a win 7 computer?
will there be better deals on vista systems as win 7 gets closer?
thanks
