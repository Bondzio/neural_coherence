<s> Hello, I have a Netgear wgt624v3 wireless router + sb5101. </s>
<s> The thing is, I have a desktop that needs to be connected to the internet. </s>
<s> Now, the thing I realized is that I don't have a cable outlet where the desktop is placed in. </s>
<s> All I have is an ethernet outlet in that room and I am using that outlet for my wireless router. </s>
<s> What should I do? </s>
<s> should I just buy an wireless adaptor for my desktop? </s>
<s> sb5101 is a motorola surfboard cable modem by the way - so I don't know what I would do with this thing when there is no cable outlet in the room for the desktop. </s>
<s> How are you able to post here and now? </s>
<s> And yes, a WIFI card for the desktop sounds like a good idea. </s>

<s> I'm using the wireless router for my laptop that has WIFI on it. </s>
<s> I am in an apartment unit and when I plug the router in the ethernet jack using an ethernet cable, I get wireless connection for my laptop. </s>
