ok i have a dell e520 series.
long story short my old pc died and had to use my student loan money and had to order from dell or hp.
ok so i have 2.8ghz intel core 2 duo 256mb xfx 8600gts (added) 3gb of ram (added) windows vista home premium 32bit and the crappy mobo they give you is basically bottle necking my proformance so i want to upgrade my mobo but to do that, i need to get a new cpu fan, psu, and case because dell make everything just for there parts.
well none of that is the issue, my issue is if i get a new motherboard and plug in the hard-drive i am using right now will my current vista system work?
will the vista reinstallation dvd that came with the system work?
ive herd so many un-sure and mixed answers that i want to be 100% sure before i spend money on these parts.
