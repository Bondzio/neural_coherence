want to explain this to dprudlow and how this will help him to fix his problem with his external case only reading 32gb and saying its unformatted, when its a 400gb hard drive?
please read the prior posts.
i made a suggestion to try smaller partitions and nothing more.
it backs what i said in an earlier post about most external cases only being able to handle 300gb.
good luck dprudlow.
hope you figure it out.
