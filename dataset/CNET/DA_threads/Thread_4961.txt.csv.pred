1.1.1	My operating system is Windows XP Pro (SP2).	St
1.1.2	BIOS is up to date.	St
1.1.3	This is what went on.	St
1.1.4	I have a 200GB (Western Digital HD) drive with partition C and D. I was using PartitionMagic 8 to resize partition D when I decided to stop the operation.	St
1.1.5	I did not know it had already started the process.	St
1.1.6	Since now this partition (D) is messed up, I had to use Knoppix 5.1 CD to boot this computer, and rescue all the data from this partition D. After that, I decided to delete all partitions with PartitionMagic and reformat the whole drive I have Ghost backup for my main OS drive (drive C).	St
1.1.7	Now, I have only 33GB of hard drive space limit on this 200GB drive.	St
1.1.8	I have used the Western Digital Tool v11.2 to setup the drive, Write-To-Zero still I cannot go beyond the 32GB size.	St
1.1.9	My BIOS is fine since I have been using this drive on this machine all along.	St
1.1.10	1.	St
1.1.11	What can I do to regain my drive to its about 185GB size (after formatting)?	Ques
1.1.12	2.	St
1.1.13	When using Knoppix boot CD, I had to use one of its tools called NTFSFIX to be able to unmount the drive before I could copy the files to another drive.	St
1.1.14	Do you think this tool might have rattled the drives size limit?	St
1.1.15	Just a thought!	St
1.1.16	Though after using Knoppix, the drives size was fine.	St
1.1.17	3.	St
1.1.18	The drives size was fine when I opened it in PartitionMagic 8, so do you think my problem started with Partitionmagic?	St
1.1.19	I could not fine help in Symantec site on my issue.	St
1.1.20	All I found would not fix the drive 33GB size limit.	St
1.1.21	4.	St
1.1.22	Any utility I can use to restore the size of my drive?	St
1.1.23	Thanks all for your time.	St
1.2.1	can you expand the drive to it's limit?	St
1.3.1	That WD tool may do something odd or bad.	St
1.3.2	Why not try GPARTED to delete that partition, make a big NTFS one?	Sug
1.3.3	You can also try GPARTED to resize the drive but it should fail if any whiff of FAT32 or odd DOS boot manager exists.	St
1.3.4	Bob	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	Never heard of &quot;GPARTED&quot;.	St
1.5.2	Just Googled and found some links.	St
1.5.3	I will download and try and keep you posted.	St
1.5.4	Thanks	Polite
1.6.1	If it's PATA ...check the jumpers for CLJ ... if the drive is set to CLJ, the drive looks like a 32GB no matter how you try to change it thru software like PM.	St
1.6.2	It's designed so that users can use large capacity HDDs with older systems where the MB would not recognize a drive that size.	St
1.6.3	VAPCMD	St
1.7.1	I tried Windows 98 boot disk, PartitionMagic8 (Windows & DOS), XP Disk Manager, FDISK (Windows & Linux), Trinity Rescue Disk, Western Digital Tool, but the closest I got to see the whole drive was GPARTED.	St
1.7.2	I could not tell what to delete to for the drive.	Sug
1.7.3	I ran through the process, from the instruction steps.	St
1.7.4	When I got to the part to enter a number for the ENDING parameters (Cylinder-Head-Sectors) I don't know what to input.	St
1.7.5	When I entered, in the Partition 2, a way-off number, the drive size showed as 198+GB.	St
1.7.6	The drive is 200GB and it's parameters are Cylinders-16383, Head-16, Sectors-63.	St
1.7.7	The tutorial showed an example on how to change the parameters, but I could not understand it good enough, so I was scared to save the entries I already made.	St
1.7.8	I will Goggle GPARTED to get more information on how to use it.	St
1.7.9	If you would have more inputs, please pass it along.	Sug
1.7.10	I really appreciate your help.	Polite
1.7.11	Thanks.	St
1.8.1	Western Digital Drive Model #: WD2000JB Head: 16 Sectors: 63 Since it was the only drive during the tests, I do not have any jumper on it.	St
1.9.1	some space is saved for instructions to use the drive by the OS.	St
1.9.2	In fact that sounds like to much available space.	St
1.9.3	You such have even less.	St
1.10.1	198+ was the utility number, but I am sure after formation, it will be in the range of 185+.	St
1.10.2	If I can get it to see the &quot;whole&quot; drive, that will be great.	St
1.10.3	Just need to know how to ue the utility properly.	St
1.11.1	GPARTED DOS was what I used.	St
1.11.2	The LiveCD only showed the 33GB limit.	St
1.12.1	http://wdc.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wdc.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=723&p_created=1037288235 Sorry, there is only one option for no jumpers and it's not one I'd ever use today.	St
1.12.2	Bob	St
1.13.1	The Recommended Setup Parameters for my drive says 10-Pin type.	St
1.13.2	The jumper you see in the diagram is from the OEM as parked (OFF).	St
1.14.1	The jumper on pins 1 and 2 for 99.999% of the systems I setup.	St
1.14.2	Good luck with anything else.	Polite
1.14.3	The next idea is to use WDC's software.	St
1.14.4	Some of their drives have the limit setting done via software.	St
1.14.5	Bob	St
1.15.1	I just finished asking the Western Digital Technician about my jumper setting.	St
1.15.2	He said, for my drive, as a single drive, there should be NO jumper on the drive for the ONLY drive on the system.	St
1.16.1	Again we still look to see if WDC software can set limits.	St
1.17.1	I wrote the Write-To-Zero, still it won't pass the 33GB limit.	St
1.17.2	This afternoon, I will try the GPARTED again.	St
1.17.3	That gave me more information.	St
1.17.4	I got more Goggle infor on the use.	St
1.17.5	Will keep you posted.	St
1.17.6	Thanks.	St
1.18.1	Maybe your BIOS has some limitation.	St
1.18.2	Did you post the host PC's specs and details?	St
1.18.3	Bob	St
1.19.1	In my earlier post, I mentioned the drive was in use in the machine before, the problem started when I stop PartitionMagic function (which I should not have done) during a proccess, which messed up the partion struction.	St
1.19.2	The board is a &quot;modern&quot; board and I have already installed a Seagate 200GB drive.	St
1.19.3	The second computer also has a 200GB drive now.	St
1.19.4	So the machines are capable of handling larger drives.	St
1.19.5	Also, I use a 500GB external USB drives on both for backup.	St
1.19.6	I am just looking for something that will be able to restructure the architecture of the drive, so I can redo it.	St
1.20.1	for the drive in question.	St
1.20.2	If your system can't see 200GB ...you won't be able to access, partition, format or use 200GB.	St
1.20.3	Also...are you using and 80-wire, 40-pin cable or an old 40-wire, 40 pin cable ?	Ques
1.20.4	VAPCMD BTW...What MB and BIOS version do you have ?	Ques
1.21.1	mfgs software (WDC) or any other drive wipe program.	Ques
1.21.2	Then partition and format.	St
1.21.3	VAPCMD	St
1.22.1	http://wdc.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wdc.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=723&p_created=1037288235&p_sid=56Ac*WMi&p_accessibility=0&p_redirect=&p_lva=&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9MSwxJnBfcHJvZHM9MCZwX2NhdHM9MTg1JnBfcHY9JnBfY3Y9MS4xODUmcF9zZWFyY2hfdHlwZT1hbnN3ZXJzLnNlYXJjaF9mbmwmcF9wYWdlPTEmcF9zZWFyY2hfdGV4dD13ZDIwMDBqYg**&p_li=&p_topview=1 This drive has been in use for two years on the same machine, with correct jumper setting adn all.	St
1.22.2	I called the manufacturer for information (fron India) but counld not tell me more than I already know.	St
1.23.1	This should have been solved or called a defect in about 10 minutes at our office.	St
1.23.2	You've had a week or more so my thought is either you haven't done what was proposed and if you did then the drive is truly defective.	St
1.23.3	It does NOT matter it worked before.	St
1.23.4	Today is what counts.	St
1.23.5	Bob	St
1.24.1	The cable is what came with the drive when I purchased it in late 2005.	St
1.24.2	It has been in use since then.	St
1.24.3	Yes the BIOS can't see the full size because the drive is not set right.	St
1.24.4	This &quot;newer&quot; board does not have the capability to set the Cylinder, Head and Sector sizes.	St
1.25.1	The Western Digital's software used to &quot;Wipe-To-Zero&quot; to a drive did not make a difference.	St
1.25.2	This wipes the drive to its original form when newly purchased.	St
1.26.1	If OK....try downloading-running KILLDISK to wipe the drive VAPCMD	St
1.27.1	I will try the KillDisk.	Sug
1.27.2	Thanks.	St
1.27.3	Will keep you posted.	St
1.28.1	If that doesn't work....you could also try HDDErase or Zerofill.	St
1.28.2	VAPCMD	St
1.29.1	Could not get Zerofill, the Google sites kepet taking me to invalid different links.	St
1.29.2	I will try the HDDErase.	Sug
1.30.1	http://gleba.gotdns.com/users/WebPublic/files/util-cd-copy/harddisktools/	St
1.31.1	I tried ZeroFill but it still could not find the whole drive.	St
1.31.2	The only software that could find the whole drive is Partman (Ranish Partition Manager), but I don't know how exactly to apply the numbers for my drive.	St
1.31.3	While playing with begining and ending Cylinder-Head-Sector number, I was able to see the whole size of the drive.	St
1.31.4	I did not want to save the setting since I was not sure and did not want to mess up my drive for good.	St
1.31.5	I will go to the maker's site tho ask question.	St
1.31.6	I could not understand the user instructions enough.	St
1.31.7	I attached another 200GB hard drive to the system (so the BIOS is OK).	St
1.31.8	I really appreciate all your help.	Polite
1.31.9	I will keep you posted on any achievement.	St
1.31.10	Thanks	Polite
1.32.1	I can't help but think there's something corrupted (firmware ?)	St
1.32.2	that's not showing up in the mfg's DIAG.	St
1.32.3	Still under warranty ?	Ques
1.32.4	VAPCMD	St
1.33.1	Warranty is over.	St
1.33.2	Though I won't give up since I am sure the sysetem and the BIOS are fine.	St
1.33.3	I am still searching for solution.	St
1.33.4	Thanks	Polite
