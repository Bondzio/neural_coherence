a problem that many students have including me .. you can pay almost the same price to get : imac with good specs like core 2 duo ,1 gb ram ,128 mb vga ,20 &quot;monitor ,etc.
or macbook with good specs but a 64 vga and small 13&quot; screen.
i know that they are in different categories .. but i live in egypt and i'm going to canada after a month .. and i don't know how will a laptop help my studying in the canadian high schools .
anyway ..there is no right or wrong about this thing .. all i want is to know some opinions from people who knows about it .
thanks alot ..
