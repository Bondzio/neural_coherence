1.1.1	Your opinion please .	Sug
1.1.2	I bought my Dell 4550 series in 2002 and I 'm in need of upgrading it or buying a new one .	St
1.1.3	What do you think is the best thing to do ?	Ques
1.1.4	The specs are : Intel Pentium 4 Process at 2.0 GHZ , 256 DDR SDRAM at 266MHz , 30GB ultra ATA/ 100 Hard Drive 7200RPM .	St
1.1.5	I use it for basic college work , downloading music ( have maybe 600 songs & download 10/ per month ) , take plenty of pics and I 'm looking into editing and maybe getting a camcorder to play with a maybe edit .	St
1.1.6	In the next two years I will also be using in the field of elementary education as a teacher .	St
1.1.7	Thanks for your ideas !	St
1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	Get rid of Limewire or similar P2P ( security and legal risk ) 2 .	St
1.2.3	Remove the spyware and viruses that you let in with it .	St
1.2.4	3 .	St
1.2.5	Get the RAM to at least 512MB .	St
1.2.6	At that point , it should be a decent system for basic college/business work .	St
1.2.7	http : //support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim4550/specs.htm # 1101572 If you really need a new desktop today , look to a system based around an Intel Core 2 Duo CPU .	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	Adding a larger hard drive and or an up-to- date DVD burner might help too .	St
1.4.2	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	Check you system specs , if the cpu is a 478-socket ( Intel ) then you pretty much got little cpu to grow on , replace ASAP , if at 400FSB .	St
1.5.2	If a P4 at FSB500 or even FSB800 , you got some room to really get better and add some more ram .	St
1.5.3	However , for all the cost , you can seriously think a replacement system if only to move on an 'investment ' the money spent on newer technology and such .	St
1.5.4	Any upgrades like more ram , bigger HD , etc .	St
1.5.5	could for a few $ more be spent on new system .	St
1.5.6	Even a basic new system is in the $ 500 or less with alot of goodies that would be what any upgrades may provide into an old system .	St
1.5.7	At this time of year , it would be very possible to get a decent system to select from and be ahead of any upgrades for awhile .	St
1.5.8	Your old system is still worth something and most data can be swapped to new system .	St
1.5.9	At the rate you 're going , added audio and video files alone require a larger HD .	St
1.5.10	Since , you want edit/play media a faster system is a practical must , plus if an XP based system you may want to look into Media Center type of OS .	St
1.5.11	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	Upgrade may even cost more than a new system .	St
1.6.2	With Vista so close at hand keeping an old system may just be a waste .	St
1.6.3	If Missj1235 can hold off with the camcorder side of it then buying a new system after bugs are out of Vista may be the way to go .	St
1.6.4	I have choosen to wait and see what comes out of the Microsoft OS works .	St
1.6.5	Maybe Missj1235 should look at what camcorder will meet the need and see what system will work it now .	St
1.6.6	Then see if up-grading old system will do or hold off till the smoke clears away from Vista .	St
1.6.7	I 'm not sure but would n't a new system have to have Xp Media Center OS to have an OS upgrade ticket for Vista ?	Ques
1.7.1	Yes , I think maybe you should checkout the Media center PC 's , it sounds like it would be a good solution to your needs ...	St
1.8.1	If you buy a Media center Computer today , it will get you a free upgrade to Windows Vista Premium , 32 bit ver .	St
1.8.2	when Vista is released .	St
1.8.3	A PC with Windows XP , will get you an upgrade to Windows Vista Basic .	St
1.8.4	I have applied for my Premium upgrade already , and it appears to be going well ...	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
