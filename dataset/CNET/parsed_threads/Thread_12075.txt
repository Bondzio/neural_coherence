<s> Hi - Not sure if there's anything that can be done however I live in an area jammed full with wifi networks. </s>
<s> Lately I notice more and more difficulty with my own network dropping me, reducing range, etc. </s>
<s> I already have an external omnidirectional antenna added onto my Linksys. </s>
<s> Is there a brand of router that could be recommended with more power or a way to boost the power of my existing network? </s>
<s> It could be my apartment building at fault but I doubt it only as things worked fine for the first few months we were here. </s>
<s> Day by day I've seen more networks spring up. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance - Matt </s>
<s> I assume you have tried using different channels on your router and changing the location of it within your apartment? </s>
<s> Sometimes that can help. </s>
<s> You can also get interference from other things, cordless phones, microwaves, etc. </s>
<s> A lot of things use the same frequency range. </s>
<s> One way around that, is to change over to the wireless A standard (instead of the b/g). </s>
<s> This runs on higher and less used frequencies. </s>
<s> Of course you would have to buy a new router/wireless cards that support this standard. </s>
<s> I have heard of people creating &quot;shields&quot; and what not, but I don't know how practical or useful that is. </s>
<s> Perhaps some other folks will have better ideas for you. </s>
<s> This is not like radio broadcasting. </s>
<s> You are sharing what ever bandwidth that is available with the other users (just like the freeway). </s>
<s> Today there is no &quot;Easy Button&quot; or tool to automate WAP placement and frequency allocations. </s>
<s> At least not in the under 6 figure price ranges. </s>
<s> So put your thinking cap on and make a map of your campus then put the WAPs on the map. </s>
<s> Identify which is at what channel and then just like you do with CELLULAR TOWERS try to keep WAPs off the same channels when they are next to each other. </s>
<s> If you planning is good you can keep it to channels 1, 5 and 11 (some use the 1, 6 and 11 combo) to help with overlaps. </s>

<s> I'm actually just one apartment in a building and neighbourhood with literally tons of wifi including a citywide net just going online. </s>
<s> I've tried multiple channels to no avail. </s>
<s> Can I assume if I'm the strongest signal on a channel occupied with other people that I'll have the least problem? </s>
<s> Compared to being on a channel with someone else who has an equally strong signal? </s>
<s> Keep moving... </s>
<s> Last question, I promise. </s>
<s> Technically, can I use *any* of channels 1-11? </s>
<s> There's always a &quot;but&quot; and it's this. </s>
<s> The channels overlap when you use them. </s>
<s> There is splatter from channel 1 to 2 and so on. </s>
<s> You'll see responses to try 1, 5 and 11. </s>
<s> Or 1, 6 and 11. </s>
<s> Why this is so is because it moves you far away from traffic on the other 2 channels. </s>
