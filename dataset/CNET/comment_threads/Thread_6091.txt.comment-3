Bob, I thought it was more than odd, until I finally put the tech at HP on the spot and all he could say is that they do not support Netgear for the dv8210us, in fact I tried to use other netgear routers thinking that there was a problem with the A/B/G configuration but none of the netgear products were supported, after I tried to use each one a dialog box would come up stating that the router wasn't supported....WEIRD to say the least.....I have used this computer at several coffee shops and it works like a champ except for one place and when I asked it was a Nergear product.....weird again...... believe me I wish that I could get this resolved....
