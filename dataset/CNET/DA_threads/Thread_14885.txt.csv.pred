1.1.1	I currently have a dell inspiron e1505 with a 120gb 5400rpm hard drive and want to go up to something bigger.	St
1.1.2	My choices are a 250gb 5400 hd and a 200gb 7200 rpm hard drive for about $35 more.	St
1.1.3	Is the speed of the 7200 fast enough to really make a big difference to my system to compensate for less space?	St
1.2.1	XP for instance is limited to 127GB.	St
1.2.2	Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem.	St
1.3.1	My system is Dell Inspiron e1505, 2gb ram, 256 ati radeon hypermemory, Windows Vista Home premium, 120gb 5400rpm hd, intel core 2 duo 1.6ghz	St
1.4.1	unless your laptop is rarely on the go, you might want to stick with the 5400rpm 250gb drive.	St
1.5.1	It appears you are attempting to configure a laptop for gaming so battery time is a non-issue.	St
