well, you're correct that is a quick fix.
in my opinion it is not well thought-out though.
if i turn off my router every night and boot it every morning, all of the automatic updates, for windows and my security suite and several others won't happen until sometime during the day.
now i find that as inconvient as having to reboot the thing in the first place.
as you said earlier, you did offer suggestion; but not practical ones.
oh, and i might add, i would need to purchase yet another piece of equipment.
