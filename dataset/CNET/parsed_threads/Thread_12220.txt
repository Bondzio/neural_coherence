<s> Hi all, I was experiencing lots of noise coming from my PC case, so I replaced the case fan (not PSU) which was the problem. </s>
<s> However, I forgot to note whether the fan should be sucking air in or blowing it out!! </s>
<s> I have a temperature display on the front of case and it doesn't seem to make any difference if I swap it to &quot;suck in&quot; or &quot;blow out&quot;!!! </s>
<s> Any ideas as to what is best? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Also I am keen to replace the tower case with a desktop one (anyone noticed that they are really hard to get hold of nowdays - will have to try eBay!). </s>
<s> This is due to my 1 year old daughter switching the power off when my 7 year old son is on the PC - causing lots of grief. </s>
<s> I have even changed power button options, but the clever baby has figured that if you hold it in for 10 seconds, it will have her desired effect!! </s>
<s> Anyways, it's an Athalon XP 1900+ processor, does it matter whether I get a 300W, 350W or 400W PSU? </s>
<s> Many thanks Jeff </s>
<s> What temp gauges does your PC have? </s>
<s> Only a case temp? </s>
<s> Or does it show the CPU temp, NB temp etc? </s>
<s> If your temp gauges don't show a difference, then, well, it doesn't really matter... As far as a search for a desktop case - try a search for a HTPC (home theater PC) case, that'll get you a few more options. </s>
<s> GP air flow....in at the bottom out at the top...test. </s>
<s> If that does not work then you adjust to what does work. </s>
<s> PSU..get the biggest one that you can afford or that fits. </s>
