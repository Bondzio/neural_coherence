They screwed up and I ended up getting TWO 256 ATi 2600 XT's. I currently have one installed. I've been reading up on hardware and noticed talk about running TWO video cards. Did I read that right? Question is ... am I able to install the other one and gain anything from it? I'm currently using one monitor(42&quot; lcd)...but would soon like to switch to dual 22&quot;s. Thanks in advance.

There are some other issues surrounding these as well, like power supply support for SLI. This thread untracked.

This makes the cards work together to improve peformance for dual monitors though its not used. to use crossfire in your case you need a motherboard which supports it and has two PCI Express slots available.
