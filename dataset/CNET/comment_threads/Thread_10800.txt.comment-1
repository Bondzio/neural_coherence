Acquired a cast off Dell that was on a network somewhere.
Processor shows up as x386.
Doesn't have blazing speed.
Ram expressed as 250,000+ kb.
Runs win2000 for networks, service pack 4.
Has a bunch of Adobe editing stuff installed.
If I fill up the Ram with as much as I can find do you think it will make a good backup?
