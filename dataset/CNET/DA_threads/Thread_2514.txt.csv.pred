1.1.2	Sounds ludicrously powerful : Microsoft Operating System Genuine Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit- English 1.8GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX260 graphics card Memory 6GB 1066MHz ( 3x2GB ) Tri Channel Memory Hard Drive 640 GB Serial ATA non Raid ( 7200 Rpm ) But would all applications/games etc work on the 64-bit windows ?	Ques
1.2.1	That 's in the Windows 7 forum so unless you have a SPECIFIC title to explore the answer is that & quot ; all applications/games etc & quot ; WILL NOT & quot ; work on the 64-bit windows & quot ; but most of them will .	St
1.2.2	Will 99 % be enough ?	Ques
1.3.1	Thx , I know that you need a 64-bit driver for each piece of hardware , and the software/games have to be made compatible also .	St
1.3.2	But it sounds like win7 is pretty compatible with older software so it should be ok I think ( I 'll check the microsoft page for updates ) thx xmrb2003x	St
