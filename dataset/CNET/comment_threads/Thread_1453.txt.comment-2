http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Monitoring,_Analysis,_and_Reporting_Technology My thought is to always enable SMART since you need the early warning.
There are however some naysayers such as vendors on Ebay that don't like this.
In the last case they had resold a drive that failed smart so they had no interest in what it reported.
You can take what you can from that event.
