<s> I used to be an avid PC gamer back in the day, but was forced to (briefly) retire due to my responsibilities at college. </s>
<s> The fact that my roommate owned a PS3 didn't help either. </s>
<s> Regardless, I've gotten to a point where I would like to begin upgrading my computer for use with today's PC games. </s>
<s> Obviously things have changed in my absence, and I could use some help getting back to speed. </s>
<s> I've got an old emachines computer, of which I've replaced many of the parts. </s>
<s> Hopefully the HDD, DVD/CD drives, and RAM could be re-used, however, the motherboard/processor and video card need to be replaced. </s>
<s> That being said, what are some qualities one would look for in a motherboard? </s>
<s> RAM, PCI-E, and processor slots are all key I'm sure, but am I missing anything? </s>
<s> Would anyone be able to recommend a good processor/motherboard combo? </s>
<s> One final question; what are are most efficient video cards these days? </s>
<s> I'm sure NVidia/Raedon are still big players - could anyone give me some advice on those? </s>
<s> Thanks for your time & help. </s>
<s> Boards that I find at tomshardware.com that are used to benchmark video cards. </s>
<s> I like to read that it was stable, crashfree, etc. </s>
