Still leading the way in what issues I'm seeing is the Parasite issue. Light reading, tools are over at http://www.doxdesk.com/parasite/ My advice on the pests is simple. Don't allow such to reside on the machines and move out of the line of fire between malware writers and Microsoft. Use another browser besides Internet Explorer and never Preview Outlook email. Never open unsolicated email. Bob
