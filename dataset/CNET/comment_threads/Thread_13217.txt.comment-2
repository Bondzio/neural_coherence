Difficult to say what went wrong during the re-install.
I guess a good question would be to ask what sort of corruption issues you had and who advised you.
What sort of re-install did you do?
Complete Format and install or a Clean Archive and Install?
This drive was not original equipment on this machine which raises the question, did you have a patch installed to enable this burner to function with OS X?
Something like PatchBurn from OWC?
I remember Apple being very fussy about what burners worked in their systems.
