OS - XP sp2 Processor - AMD Athalon 64x2 Mobo - MachSpeed MSNV939 RAM - 4mb 333/400 DDR SDRAM Display - Soyo 24&quot; LCD Flat This problem has gone from being able to game for almost 60 minutes when first completed upgrade before lines appear to yesterday my system completely locking up 3 minutes into a game and needing to reboot my system to unlock Windows.
Main reason for upgrading GPU was I suspected Radeon GPU was failing.
Since &quot;upgrading&quot; from ATI Radeon x1300 series GPU to GeForce 9400GT GPU four months ago (both GPUs purchased new), when browsing with multiple browsers open or playing flight simulator type games, horizontal black lines covering complete width of screen appear to flash from bottom to top of monitor screen.
I can temporarily eliminate these lines by manually turning the on/off button on my monitor off for 5 seconds - then turning monitor back on.
I have noticed that when restarting from being off all night my processor registers 6 to 8 celcius hotter than it used to (formerly 27c now lowest 33c).
Also noticed when I'm rebooting from a crash the processor is now reaching temps of 43c on a regular basis.
Have removed processor and re-applied new ht paste and have made sure processor fan (which was upgraded to a Thermaltake TR2-R1 fan when I upgraded from the onboard GPU to the Radeon x1300) and it's heat dissipating fins are clean.
Any feedback would be appreciated.
