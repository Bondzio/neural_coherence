<s> I'm looking to buy a graphics card for my pc. </s>
<s> My current one is rubbish! </s>
<s> First of all, will any graphics card work ok? </s>
<s> Or does it need to be a particular configuration to suit my PC? </s>
<s> What are the things I need to see if they are compatible with my PC when looking for a graphics card? </s>
<s> Secondly, is there any difference between a graphics adapter and graphics card? </s>
<s> Thirdly, I've shortlisted these graphic cards/adapters. </s>
<s> Which is the one I should go for? </s>
<s> I'm looking for one that basically lets me play the latest games at high FPS. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> Read http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/05/01/the_best_gaming_video_cards_for_the_money/ and see if you picked one from their list. </s>
<s> &quot;First of all, will any graphics card work ok? </s>
<s> Or does it need to be a particular configuration to suit my PC? </s>
<s> What are the things I need to see if they are compatible with my PC when looking for a graphics card?&quot; Yes. </s>
<s> The units you picked appear to be 3 PCIe and the third one is an AGP. </s>
<s> You need to figure out which your machine supports. </s>
<s> Also some machines need a power supply upgrade. </s>
<s> Since you neglected our forum note I can't answer which one would possibly work (agp or pcie). </s>
<s> Here's the forum note you should see when posting. </s>
<s> &quot;Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. </s>
<s> Also please exercise your best judgment when posting in the forums--revealing personal information such as your e-mail address, telephone number, and address is not recommended.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> first, you need to determine what type of graphics slot you have: agp, pci express (pci-e), or none. </s>
<s> (your list included both agp and pci-e.) your motherboard's manual/website will tell you this or you can download CPU-Z from here: http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php next, you need to set a budget. </s>
<s> pci-e versions of radeon x1650xt and geforce 7600gt should run you about 75 while a geforce 8600gt will be around 85. agp versions are a bit more expensive. </s>
<s> all of the above cards should work fine with most pcs. </s>
<s> but if you have a slimline pc you may need a &quot;low profile&quot; card which can be harder to find. </s>
<s> if your power supply is less than 300w you'll also need a more powerful replacement. </s>
<s> It seems my motherboard has 2 PCI slots. </s>
<s> What does this mean? </s>
<s> Other configurations are - 1 Gig ram, 80 gig HD, Vista. </s>
<s> Actually, hang on. </s>
<s> How do I find out if my graphic card slot is a PCI or PCI-express? </s>
<s> My graphic card is a ATI Radeon XPRESS 200 series (0x5A61) </s>
<s> Does your machine have a Make and Model? </s>
<s> Share that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It is an E-system Ei-302. </s>
<s> Ei-system e302. </s>
<s> Sorry but you have the machine so only you can tell. </s>
<s> In fact, let's save me having to hunt it down and here's what I need you to do. </s>
<s> -&gt; Reply with a link to the maker's web page on the machine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> They haven't got a homepage but this is kinda what my PC is - http://www.pcworld.co.uk/martprd/product/seo/686385 It says on there that it has 2 PCI slots but I'm not sure its the same as my PC because mine has a different graphic card. </s>
<s> I can't find the maker's web site so here's a link with pictures for the various slot types. </s>
<s> http://www.buildyourown.org.uk/pc-building/fitting/adapter-cards/ You can use google.com to find bigger pictures of each slot type but there should not be an ISA slot so don't bother with that one. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Here's a pic of my motherboard, what do you think? </s>
<s> http://img368.imageshack.us/my.php?image=image098ah4.jpg The two white ones are standard PCI slots right? </s>
<s> I'm hoping against hope the long black one at the top is a PCI express slot. </s>
<s> 2 white PCI slots. </s>
<s> I can't make out if that's a PCI 1X slot then above that is a blury slot and I can't tell is that's a PCIe slot. </s>
<s> -&gt; The FOXCONN is the motherboard make so there is hope to identify the motherboard but your shot was too blurred for me to read it. </s>
<s> Look up FREE EVEREST and see if it or BELARC ADVISOR reports the motherboard model. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ...Let me get a better pic. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help by the way! </s>
<s> You can find online pictures of PCIe slots to compare with yours. </s>
<s> But the real work you need to do is to identify that mainboard. </s>
<s> Try the tools I just mentioned. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Is this any better? </s>
<s> http://img129.imageshack.us/my.php?image=image0991tz9.jpg And I have tried downloading other 'System info' programs, none of them really gave me the info I needed. </s>
<s> I will check out the programs you mentioned. </s>
<s> Excuse the poor quality of my crappy camera! </s>
<s> http://images.google.com/images?um=1&tab=wi&hl=en&q=pcie Compare but that looks like a PCIe 1x and then a 16x slot. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I haven't done a Belarc advisor scan yet (PC is busy) but it certainly looks like its this doesn't it: http://www.foxconnchannel.com/Product/motherboard_detail.aspx?ID=en-us0000240 Hurray, if it is! </s>
