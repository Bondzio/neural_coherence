The recycling process involves disassembling, inspecting, thoroughly cleaning, reassembling and completely filling the product with ink. Finally, the cartridge is run through an actual print test.

They provide &quot;OEM Matched&quot; products for Epson Printer Ink Cartridges, Hp Inkjet Cartridges and Canon Printer Ink Cartridges . Still I need some more information on inkjet printer cartridges.

Laser cartridges usually present no problem because the toner is sealed within the cartridge and protected against handling.
