1.1.1	I have a XP PC network with a Linksys wireless Router WRT54G that is across the street from our Apple Airport Extreme wireless router connected to our server .	St
1.1.2	I want to connect the two routers so that we can share the data on the server wirelessly .	St
1.1.3	Tried VPNing it but the proprietary software we use is too bulky and takes to long to load the data via wireless VPN , so any ideas on how to connect the two networks wirelessly .	St
1.1.4	Thanks in advance !	St
1.1.5	Robert rhammerman @ aol.com	St
1.2.1	If you take a moment to read the manuals on both routers you find you ca n't & quot ; bond & quot ; them as you suggest .	St
1.2.2	Try something else .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	So , do you have any suggestions on how to connect the two networks ?	Ques
1.3.2	I purchased 2 wireless access pts that I was going to connect but Netgear did not support the repeater function ... any ideas , thanks in advance !	St

1.4.1	Too bad I do n't know what you have to work with here but a common network bond would have you use one and only one router then place a client wifi device in a bridge mode to your wired lan .	St
1.4.2	Then place a WAP somewhere inside your facility .	St
1.4.3	The client would be on the channel that the ( master ) router is and your WAP should be on the opposite channel .	St
1.4.4	For example , the master router would be on channel 1 and your WAP would be on channel 11 to keep interference down .	St
1.4.5	Example .	St
1.4.6	Client device in bridge mode - & gt ; Wired LAN - & gt ; WAP Sorry I do n't teach networking in this small space .	St
1.4.7	I also will not duplicate ready web content .	St
1.4.8	Not being mean but you have to understand this well enough to be self supporting .	St
1.4.9	I ca n't be your support .	St
