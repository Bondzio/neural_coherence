i just think that as a moderator (and i speak from experience, having been a mod here in the past), it's important to foster an environment in which people feel they can come here to get help, not get reprimanded or told &quot;no&quot; when they ask a perfectly reasonable question.
yes, i found some information doing a forum search but not much, and what i found expressed opinions on both sides of the &quot;wpa or wpa2&quot; question.
in fact one of the pro-wpa2 posts was yours.
i found more information elsewhere without being chastised for asking for it, and i think i'm closer to a solution than i was this morning.
have a good weekend.
