I have the same problem with an iPod nano connected to the USB port.
The message arises even if the iPod is not connected and only the cable is connected.
I am using Windows XP Home.
The port on the back is used for a printer and another port on the front is used for a Blue Tooth device.
They function OK.
When the &quot;Power Surge&quot; message appears the curser for the BlueTooth mouse is frozen.
Anyone familiar with this problem?
