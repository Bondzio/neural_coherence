I have connected it to a desktop and it tells me it has discovered new hardware but it does not show up in my computer as a drive. When I unplug the cable it shows up as a drive but disappears immediately. What is up with this and how can I tell if there is anything on this drive to retrieve?

Also, is it a seagate drive coming from your laptop? Or is the history of this drive different? Then it's not a similar problem, but a different problem. Kees
