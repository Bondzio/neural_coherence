<s> i can get a x800 xt platinum edition (agp) for $230, is this a good deal? </s>
<s> oh and the product number is 100-435508 the pci is $300 </s>
<s> as the ati x300, x700, x800s do not support sm3.0 or fp32. </s>
<s> the prices for the following are dropping pretty fast: GeForce 6800GT for $374 CAD ($311 USD) http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1211889&CatId=0 or Radeon X800XL for $310 CAD ($257 USD) http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1476859&CatId=0 both are getting cheaper by the day, but is the GeForce worth the extra $64? </s>
<s> as it supports sm3 and fp32 which is needed for future games. </s>
<s> if u go circuit city the geforce6800gt is only 290usd but i'm not sure if its still at that price...think the rebate expired today or something </s>
<s> Thanks for the info, il go with the newer ones </s>
<s> some guy on the gamespot forums said that the GeForce is not worth it... </s>
<s> I guess it all depends on the games that are going to come out </s>
<s> it's already known that SM3.0 is going to be a requirement of upcoming games the FP precision thing hasn't been an issue for ATi, and probably won't be for a long time (i'm guessing the game will be overall too demanding/beyond the card's overall ability before the FP issue arises) but SM3.0 is going to be a part of upcoming games because it's a part of current games (Half-Life 2 and FarCry can use it, and do use it on GeForce 6 cards) my take is basically this: if your fine buying a $300-$500 card that you already KNOW will have issues with games due to lack of feature support, go for it, just know that you have to upgrade sooner me personally, I cannot justify purchase of a $300-$600 card that won't support things I want it to support in the future i'd rather be able to play the game at the settings I like 6800GT allows that, I don't feel that if i'm spending a fair deal of my hard earned money that I should have to compromise just to say I have a different brand or to get 2-3% higher in a benchmark </s>
<s> I think I will maybe get the 6800GT when it drops even lower but what is fp32? </s>
