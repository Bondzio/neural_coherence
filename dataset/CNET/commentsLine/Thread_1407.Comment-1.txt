just had a new computer built including a raptor drive for the os and programs.
this is very noisy and i have become aware of the level of disc access which is happening even when the computer has been idle for several hours.
the clunking noise from the drive is like a distant drum beat and happens every 1 to 2 seconds.
is this normal - and if not is there any way of finding out what is causing it?
if it should be happening all the time - any recommendations an enclosure to quieten it which will keep the temperature reasonable - it runs at anything from 32 to 34 degrees at the moment?
