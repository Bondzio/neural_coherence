So I just got a new computer and It is working nicely and everything.
I just bought a video card to add to it.
It is a ATI Radeon X700 Pro, 256 MB, PCIe x 16 video card.
My friend is telling me that I should buy a new Power Supply Unit because mine is probably not going to be good enough and it can blow.
Is this true?
My Current PSU Specs ( I just copied it from the sticker on the PSU) Model: ATX-300-122 INPUT: 100-127v-7A , 200-240v-4A , 60/50 Hz OUTPUT: +12 V Computer Specs OP: XP Home Edition Processor: AMD Athlon 64 (2 GHz) +3200 RAM: 1 GB DDR Hard drive: 200 GB And New Video Card: Radeon x700 PRO 256 MB PCIe So should I buy a new PSU or should I stick with the one I have?
Thank you soo much for the help.
