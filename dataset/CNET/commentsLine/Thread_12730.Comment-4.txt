as bob points out, the prices are close.
although the b speed is sufficient for simple dsl connectivity, you will find it dragging when transferring large files between computers and just plain inadequate when playing a high quality music or video file that resides on the other computer (pauses and dropouts).
the g equipment will be robust enough for that.
since the price differences are not material, don't box yourself into unsatisfactory performance with the slower b equipment.
