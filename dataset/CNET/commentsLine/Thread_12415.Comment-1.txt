just recently my mate built me a computer and it has 2 hard drives a c drive and e drive.
the problem is that the c drive only has 4gb while the e drive has 600gb.
i dont know alot about computers so im worried about playing aorund with it 2 much without help but windows etc is stored on the c drive and it is always at low disk space.
how can i get windows to load and install programs on the e drive so there is plently of room.
is there any advantages to the way it is set up now.
thanks for your help.
