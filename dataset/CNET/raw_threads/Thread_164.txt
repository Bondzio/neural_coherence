I just don't know which other cables are needed to make the connection from capture card to TV, and from capture card to computer. Thanks!

To connect the ADVC110 to your video equipment, camera, VCR, etc. you will need whatever cables fit the output of those devices. Digital (DV) camcorders usually have a Firewire cable, (aka IEEE1394 or iLink) that will connect to the ADVC. To connect the ADVC110 to your TV, you will need either an RCA cable or an S-Video cable, depending on what your TV will support. All of the above information is on the Canopus site. What are you planning to use the device for? P

Under Share, you will see an option to send it to iDVD. Here you can add menu's, if necessary, and add a few bits and pieces to make it look like a &quot;real&quot; DVD when inserted into a DVD player. Once you are set, hit the burn button and take the rest of the night off. I usually leave mine overnight and it's ready when I get up. Best not to be doing anything else when iDVD is rendering, compressing and otherwise doing its stuff. Good Luck P

You don't need to actually capture video to your hard-drive. The software will simply show you what is being fed into the computer via the Canopus. For both options, plug your video device into the Canopus, then use a Firewire cable from the Canopus to the Mac. Use whichever option you want above. I am currently watching FOX Business News on my Mac-mini, taking RCA video and audio from a VCR (which has a TV cable plugged in) and I am using QT Pro. I choose &quot;New Movie Recording&quot; and AT opens up and shows the video signal. The only problem with either of my options is that they don't give you full screen video like a TV. The TV screen image is controlled by the software and it's smaller than full-screen.

I've another problem, exact the opposite, I want to send my lap top screen to my tv using the canopus 110, any ideas?

I simply bought a cable that plugged into the Mac's Video-out plug and had RCA and S-Video cables on the other side. Audio needs a similar converter cable: Mini-plug split into RCA audio plugs. Some laptops have DVI-out, and you can buy a DVI adapter cable to get video into RCA plugs, etc.

Connect the DVD output to the same type of input on the Canopus. Launch iMovie. Run the DVD player In iMovie (you did not say what version you have) click the camera icon and then import. What is playing on the DVD is the imported, in real time, to the Mac. How's that? P
