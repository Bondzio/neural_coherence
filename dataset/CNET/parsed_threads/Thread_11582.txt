<s> My friend who is a photographer has a new WD My Passport portable external drive. </s>
<s> He also has a new Macbook Pro and a Nikon camera that takes large size files, about 70 mb each. </s>
<s> Using a 32 gb compact flash card either in the camera or in a card reader, we have attempted to copy approximately 400 image files directly from the CF card My Passport drive, both being recognized by the Mac and connected via USB 3. </s>
<s> With the first attempt, My Passport will only copy about half the files and then stop. </s>
<s> On a second attempt, it again copies about a third to a half of the remaining files and then stops. </s>
<s> On a third attempt, the same event occurs and only a portion of the remaining files are copied, although all are selected. </s>
<s> There is no problem in copying the files directly from the computer to My Passport. </s>
<s> All the files get copied immediately. </s>
<s> But we would like to copy from the CF card to My Passport while both are connected to the computer, bypassing a transfer of the files to the computer. </s>
<s> My Passport is formatted with ExFAT for both Windows PC's and Macs but will primarily be used with Mac. </s>
<s> Any solution? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> If someone tried to copy them to the top or root folder they could exceed what that folder can hold. </s>
<s> Did you try putting them into a new folder? </s>
