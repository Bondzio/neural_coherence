1.8.1	Find the right cable , the right connector on your TV , the right connector on your card and the right settings on both devices .	St
1.8.2	That 's all .	St
1.8.3	Without manuals and CD 's it 's somewhat more difficult than if you should have them .	St
1.8.4	The basic rule : try using the same connector on both ends ( be it analog , HDMI , Scart , DVI or composite video ) .	St
1.8.5	Sorry to be of no more help .	St
1.8.6	If you ca n't find out , take your PC and the manual of your TV with you to the shop and ask them for the right cable .	St
1.8.7	That might be a good start .	St
1.8.8	Then explore the settings of your video card .	St
