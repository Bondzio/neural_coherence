To jump in and start reading and eventually piece together the puzzle. Since you didn't ask for anything specific I can't answer. If you want a fine book on networking there are many out there. Bob

The nice thing about standards is that the ones you noted are documented widely and fine books at the better book stores. However there are those that think if they can ask the right person it all could be explained in two paragraphs. Sorry, this may never happen. Just look at what results you get at google and the wikipedia. So far you haven't asked for something that isn't out there on the web or in a fine book. It's all there for you to keep reading till it makes sense. Bob
