i have tried a new ps cable to no avail.
the sata bios recognizes the 2 drives, it just hangs after it posts the devices and does not let me get to the system bios so that i can reinstall the os.
i have also tried switching the hdds to the other sata ports.
still the same hang at the serial ata bios.
