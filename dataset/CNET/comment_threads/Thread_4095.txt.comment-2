My Via Cyrix 733MHz is below that, but I put on 512MB of RAM and it plays DVDs fine.
That 128MB RAM is about 1/2 what I would try for DVD playback.
Also, not a word in your post about OS, etc so go get a GEEXBOX (hint: google.com) CD and see if that plays your DVD.
I don't offer any support for this since it's all documented on the web.
