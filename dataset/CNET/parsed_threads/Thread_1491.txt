<s> Yesterday when I tried to print something, I got a message that the printer was not responding. </s>
<s> The amber screen on the printer was telling me to &quot;Insert Cartridge&quot;. </s>
<s> I have tried several things, up to and including changing all the print cartridges. </s>
<s> No change. </s>
<s> I tried to print and the printer driver returned the error message &quot;Install Print Head&quot;. </s>
<s> I did not remove anything. </s>
<s> I suspect that what is generating the errors is a malfunction on the part of the printer and is not user serviceable. </s>
<s> A quick search of the web turns up nothing specific to my printer (Pixma MP780), but some web posts do talk about replacing the print head. </s>
<s> How easy is this? </s>
<s> Is the printer worth taking in for service? </s>
<s> 2009 iMac 20&quot; OSX 10.5.8 Thanks </s>
<s> It's all about how much will it cost to fix this. </s>
<s> Most printers cost less than a trip to the repair counter. </s>
<s> If you've expended all the usuals, read the fine manual then my advice is to make ONE call to Canon's repair center to ask how much. </s>
<s> If it exceeds that of a new printer, then it's a much easier decision. </s>
<s> If the printer is 24 months or older, I also say replace it. </s>

<s> That's my thinking. </s>
<s> I think the print head went bad. </s>
<s> Since I posted my query, I was able to locate and remove the print head. </s>
<s> I am not sure if I have it in properly, but I doubt the problem was the print head becoming &quot;unshipped&quot;. </s>
<s> There is no change in the printer's error message. </s>
<s> It's amazing how regardless of use or cost, they never seem to last more than three years. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> It's not a sure thing so the problem I run into is &quot;do you feel lucky?&quot; That is, how much is that print head and is it worth the risk. </s>
<s> I think you agreed the printer was over 2 years so even if that was it, what's next? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm looking at a Canon MX 860. </s>
<s> http://reviews.cnet.com/multifunction-devices/canon-pixma-mx860/4505-3181_7-33529769.html What I want to highlight is Cnet's claim they set it up with an Apple machine. </s>
<s> I like when I see that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I think I just finished setting it up - we'll see. </s>
<s> If so, it was fairly straightforward. </s>
