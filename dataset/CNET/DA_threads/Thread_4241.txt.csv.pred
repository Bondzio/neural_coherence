1.1.1	About a month ago , i bought a PNY nVIDIA GeForce 9400 GT , 512mb DDR2 graphics card for my Gateway GT5220 desktop computer .	St
1.1.2	It worked wonderfully for about a month , then yesterday it stopped working .	St
1.1.3	My computer took longer than usual to boot , and nothing would display ( the monitor would n't detect any input ) .	St
1.1.4	After messing around with the internal components ( reinserting my RAM , Graphics card , etc .	St
1.1.5	) , i still get the same issue .	St
1.1.6	However , when i start up my computer without the graphics card , it boots perfectly , but it runs off my stock graphics card , which does n't perform at the level i would like it to .	St
1.1.7	Basically , i found the issue to be my current graphics card .	St
1.1.8	My question is , is there a way to fix my existing one , or would i need to spring for a new card ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	Why not just let them honor the warranty ?	Ques
1.3.1	The card was discontinued , so the store where i bought it said they ca n't do anything about it .	St
1.3.2	It could n't hurt to contact the manufacturer and see what they can do though .	St
1.3.3	Thanks for the suggestion .	St
1.4.1	Here in the USA , PNY has swapped many a friend 's cards .	St
1.4.2	No one I know goes back to the store to swap such things .	St
1.5.1	It has been over a month since i purchased the card .	St
1.5.2	I got it the 18th of Febuary , and it stopped working the 2nd of April .	St
1.5.3	Though that might still be covered , so i will look into it	St
1.6.1	The new driver might be the cause of the problem .	St
1.6.2	Also , you did n't mention uninstalling and re-installing your driver software for your video card .	St
1.6.3	If you have n't done so already , uninstall your video card driver and go to Nvidia 's website to get the latest available driver ( if that one did n't cause the problem in the first place ) .	St
