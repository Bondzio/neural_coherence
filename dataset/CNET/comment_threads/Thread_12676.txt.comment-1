Hello, I was having problems with my computer restarting/BSOD when using flashplayer and it kept telling me I needed more RAM.
My motherboard is an old iWill XP333 with Athlon XP1900 chip and has 1-512mb and 1-256mb RAM, both PC2700.
I went on to Crucial and PNY and they both told me that I could use 1GB PC3200 which I bought and installed beside the PC2700 RAM.
My problem is that the BIOS recognizes all of the RAM without errors but it will only let me set the CPU multiplier at 100mhz(DDR200) which makes the CPU run @ 1.2gHz.
When I set it at 133mHz (DDR266), I get either a BSOD or Black error screen.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thank you.
ps:No need to laugh, I know this computer is OLD!
