<s> can any one help me with this matter please. </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> Four pieces plus a beep. </s>
<s> But first, imagine if everyone used your Subject title. </s>
<s> Take a moment to craft something more like... Changed the power supply and it still doesn't (something.) </s>
<s> In fact, I can't tell if it turns on or not. </s>
<s> My definition of &quot;on&quot; here is fans spinning. </s>
<s> Not that windows works (or linux.) </s>
<s> So given so little words, you could try just the PSU, motherboard, Speaker and the CPU+HeatSinkFan and see if it will power up and beep. </s>
<s> If not, you are looking at the four possible bad parts. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> In addition to Mr. Proffitt's comments, if there are no signs of life (fans, hdd led, etc.) </s>
<s> you may have a bad switch. </s>
<s> check to make sure the voltage is set to 110 instead of 220 and power is on........on the back of new power supply. </s>
<s> I looked at one last week that all was wrong was power was off on back of PS </s>
<s> There are two ways that might get your computer going. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Disconect your BIOS battery. </s>
<s> Your BIOS batter is a nickle size &quot;silver&quot; battery located near your BIOS chip. </s>
<s> Take the battery out and after 5- seconds place it back in. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Check your motherboard manual for a jumper connection by your BIOS chip. </s>
<s> The jumper has three terminals. </s>
<s> Move the jumper over to the bare terminal. </s>
<s> That wil turn your BIOS off, clearing your BIOS. </s>
<s> After a few seconds, move the jumper back. </s>
<s> Just BE SURE to ground yourself to the chassis before you touch anything. </s>
<s> Static electricity can kill your motherboard. </s>
<s> Hope this works. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
