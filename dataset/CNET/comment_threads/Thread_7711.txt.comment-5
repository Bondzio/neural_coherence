the 8800GT vs the 8800GTX is nearly equal, the extra memory does nothing, and the core clock also does nothing, because the GTX has more shaders than the GT I'd go with the 8800GT, mostly because its the best deal financially, and it'll easily tear up in all of those games as far as SLI, don't bother, unless you've got a huge monitor, and a very capable PC ...just as another note, i think you mean UT3
