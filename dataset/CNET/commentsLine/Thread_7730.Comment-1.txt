i want to get a (not too expensive) scanner for scanning in b+w negatives i'm taking for school (and probably color negatives in the future) but also for general scanning in documents etc.
any suggestions?
i know i once saw a scanner that was a regular scanner but then had a frame that you put negatives in and put that on the scanner bed, and it would automatically crop and resize all the negatives-is this a common feature or only available in higher price scanners?
(i'm using windows xp sp2)
