<s> Hi, I recently got a Dell e196fp flat panel monitor at work. </s>
<s> While its size impressed me, I haven't been able to get the desired display from it (nothing close to my old CRT monitor). </s>
<s> The monitor's default is 1280x1024 resolution at 60 Hz frequency. </s>
<s> However, I have realised that at this resolution, neither graphics nor text is appearing properly. </s>
<s> Text is too light to read and letters appear broken. </s>
<s> Graphics appear stretched out. </s>
<s> I am using P-4 machine 1.8 GHz, 1 GB RAM, with built in Intel 82845G/GL/GE/PE/GV Graphics controller and Windows 2000 Professional. </s>
<s> I tried re-installing drivers but that didn't help. </s>
<s> Any idea what could be the possible reason for this? </s>
<s> How to get optimum viewing experience from this monitor. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Satish </s>
<s> If you use any ext. </s>
<s> cabling, remove them and have a direct connection. </s>
<s> Understand also, while the LCD default resolution is XYZ, your std. </s>
<s> output from the video port/card is is usually another XYZ too, they must match or get the best possible viewing, play with it. </s>
<s> Also, if you're in an office with bright lights, etc. </s>
<s> and you adjust brightness/constrast to extremes viewing will diminish overall. </s>
<s> The bigger the screen the larger some displays show thier weakness, especially when using older video ports. </s>
<s> Thus, having a newer video port/card and more video ram increases enjoyment in this regard. </s>
<s> Last, overall the quality of the LCD counts as well, but I think you need to adjust setting for the best match as Dell offers decent LCDs. </s>
<s> If possible get a video display output pattern to adj. </s>
<s> basic setting before going overboard on anything else. </s>
