if it isnt the oldest bad doctor joke in history, its probably close: a guy goes to the doctor, moves his arm in a funky way, and says, doc, it hurts when i do this.
dont do that, the doctor inevitably answers.
until you sort it out, stop doing that.
it's likely the drive needs firmware or is failing, but you didn't supply the exact make/model of the drive.
hint: i/o magic didn't make that drive.
it's something they got in bulk and had their label put on.
