7368	0	346079	3061312	NR	Romberto	6/14/09 6:40 AM	1.2449616E12	Windows media library to external hard drive	I store my mp3 music in the windows media library. When a copy a selected mp3 piece of music and copy it to my external hard drive I think it looses its properties. The mp3 icon is missing and if I bring it back to my library it wont play. Please advise.
