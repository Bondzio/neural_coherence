If the connector goes to a standard keyboard lock on the front panel of the PC, removing the connector from the MB only disables your ability to lock the keyboard.
A jumper would just lock it again so leave it disconnected.
If the RAM has been removed and not properly reinstalled, you will get beeps, especially if in slot &quot;0&quot;.
I recall something about the first 64k as being mandatory.
There is no beep code standard for MB manufacturers so, if you can, I would check for a support site for yours.
Most likely the BIOS chips are from AMI or Pheonix.
