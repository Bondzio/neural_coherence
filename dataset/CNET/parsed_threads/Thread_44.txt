<s> Well I read this review: http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/gateway-dx4831-01e/4505-3118_7-33964710.html and went ahead and got the computer. </s>
<s> Now I need to know how to add a hard drive. </s>
<s> Does anyone know if the Gateway comes with everything you need to add one? </s>
<s> I can't really remove anything from the old computer (Vaio), and might need a cable or something. </s>
<s> Most new systems use SATA type connections, thus ports. </s>
<s> In this regard, buy a new HD and allowing that space is available to mount it internally, it should be relatively easy. </s>
<s> When you buy the new HD, visit or review its manual online or physically to check out it wants to be installed. </s>
<s> Again, providing there is a space to mount the HD, proceed. </s>
<s> Also, new HD should have included the required s/w for optional or ease of install as well. </s>
<s> If not, then visit the HD makers support website for such. </s>
<s> Gateway may provide info/details on access to &quot;replace a HD&quot; but that same info/details is required to mount a new/additional HD. </s>
<s> Once installed physically access it or prepare it for use by formatting, etc., using the HD management setup. </s>
<s> Beware, to know exactly which HD you format. </s>
<s> If you like, before any of this is done, BACK-UP the system or use the maker's own s/w to produce recovery media if not already supplied. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> it sounds to me the person is looking for a solution for getting the info from the old computer to the new. </s>
<s> The title is a bit misleading to me too. </s>
<s> No reference to an old HD or new for that matter, directly. </s>
<s> The link provided offers nothing but the Gateway specs/details. </s>
<s> The info I provided will work for a new as well as old HD if SATA. </s>
<s> If not, then a PATA or older EIDE connection, then an adapter such as a ADA-2020 found at http://www.geeks.com or similar will suffice. </s>
<s> If an EIDE port is available then quite possible the adapter isn't needed. </s>
<s> But, until the original poster offers any more details of the old system besides a &quot;Sony Viao&quot; could proceed more. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Well it doesn't have any IDE slots, at least not that I can see. </s>
<s> http://img52.imageshack.us/img52/9259/hpim1157l.jpg http://img89.imageshack.us/img89/5005/hpim1158w.jpg So I guess I need an adapter now? </s>
<s> And that the current hard drive, which you can see, is connected with SATA? </s>
<s> From a quick Google search I found these: http://www.cooldrives.com/sata-adapters.html I'm assuming something along those lines would be adequate. </s>
<s> Of course I don't want to buy an adapter and find out it's the wrong kind. </s>
<s> If so, you network them and transfer what you need that way. </s>
<s> and just a hint. </s>
<s> When folks use those tiny dots in a post title, it's not all that easy to click on them. </s>
<s> A few letters of text makes a nice target. </s>
<s> Ah, I guess you aren't using threaded view. </s>
<s> Every reply to me is shown on the same page. </s>
<s> No, the old PC doesn't work. </s>
<s> I ended up just getting an enclosure for the old drive. </s>
<s> Now the next hard part is transferring my old bookmarks and data... </s>
