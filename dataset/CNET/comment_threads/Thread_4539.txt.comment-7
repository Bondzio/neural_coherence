You should read the Zalman link in my other post.
Unless you have a controlled research laboratory, you don't want to use refrigerated coolants because they can get below the atmospheric condensation temperature and cause condensatin inside your computer (BAD).
Radiative liquid cooling (with or without fans) is sufficient.
