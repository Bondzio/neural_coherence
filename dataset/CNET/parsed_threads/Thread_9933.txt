<s> My pc got zapped by a lightning storm. </s>
<s> The comp was plugged into a surge protector, but the dsl line wasn't. </s>
<s> I replaced the motherboard, processor, video card, nic card and power supply. </s>
<s> The computer will now turn on, but the monitor isn't picking up the computer. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Connect the monitor to another pc and see if it works. </s>
<s> If all those items you mentioned above failed from the lightning storm then most likely your monitor was damaged since its plugged into your vid card. </s>
<s> jakeob1106: Test out your memory, as well as the monitor. </s>
<s> Memory is very sensitive to electro static shock. </s>
