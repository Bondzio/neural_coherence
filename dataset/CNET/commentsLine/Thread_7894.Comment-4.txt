&quot;vga(wxga), dvi-d&quot; and being a pc display means it is unlikely to have hdcp.
hdcp costs a buck for the license and chip so there is no reason for it on pc displays until recently.
i missed if you used their support or contact on that web page.
an old reply noted similar at &quot;best answer - chosen by asker the manufacturer's page doesn't say in its specifications if it supports hdcp or not.
googling reveals nothing on the subject either.
i'd suggest sending the company an email (click on &quot;support&quot; on that page you linked to) and ask them.
that monitor, if it does support hdcp, can only display 720p.
it will not display 1080 resolutions-- that requires a monitor with 1920x1080 resolution.&quot;  is oddly the same as your question.
another discussion at  i wonder if you've asked this before?
