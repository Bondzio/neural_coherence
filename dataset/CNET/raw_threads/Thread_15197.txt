You can't do that. But many machines (computers, not CPUs) have slots to install sound and other cards, then you install drivers to make it work. Hope this helps, Bob

You can pt an old sound card in your computer, but 1st identify the make & model # and do a search for drivers for it. You can just try it first, but 98 has very few drivers built into it - you'll most likely need to find & download the appropriate drivers (then hope the card is any good) It would be a lot less headache to buy a card complete with driver CD for @ $15 - $20
