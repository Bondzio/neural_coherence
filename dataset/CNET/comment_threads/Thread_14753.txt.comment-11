I've moved Windows, programs & data files several times from drive to drive without having any problem, I've used Xxcopy http://www.datman.com/xxcopy/ Just read instuctions carefully, to avoid problems, mmmm and it's FREEEEEEE.
Norton Ghost is a good alternative, but it's not free.
More, Xxcopy clones totally any disk without partition size limitations.
