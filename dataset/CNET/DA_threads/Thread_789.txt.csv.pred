1.1.1	I have an AD73 PRO , ( AMD2000+ ) Skt-A , KT266A +8233A , DDR , ATX , AC97 , ATA133 Motherboard When trying to install an NVIDIA GeForceFX5200 AGP video card I am having IRQ sharing problems .	St
1.1.2	Can I force the IRQ for the video card through the BIOS ?	Ques
1.1.3	I can not move any of the other cards in the PCI slots .	St
1.1.4	Ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling the cards and drivers but no luck .	St
1.1.5	Is there a solution ?	Ques
1.1.6	WINXP Pro isnt allowing me to change the IRQ .	St
1.1.7	This is on NVIDIA 's site [ With more devices being included in today 's PC systems , it forces system builders to install components that share IRQ 's with other devices .	St
1.1.8	Some components do not like sharing IRQ 's and can lead to system lock ups.. Generally , the graphics card should have its own IRQ and not be sharing one with any other device .	St
1.1.9	The only thing that should be sharing the same IRQ as the graphics card is an IRQ holder for PCI steering .	St
1.1.10	If you have anything else sharing the same IRQ as the graphics card , you must change that device 's IRQ assignment .	St
1.1.11	The easiest way to do this is to simply to move the device , which is sharing the IRQ with the graphics card , to a different PCI slot .	St
1.1.12	Some motherboards also allow you to force an IRQ .	St
1.1.13	Check with your motherboard manufacturer to see if this feature is available on your motherboard .	St
1.1.14	Copyright 2004 NVIDIA Corporation ] The only open slot I have is next to the AGP slot and too close to the heat sink on the new video card .	St
1.1.15	How can I resolve this ?	Ques
1.1.16	It 's causing the system to crash even just when accesing mymsn .	St
1.1.17	Not to mention the havoc in trying to load Hitman .	St
1.1.18	I 've tried DFI 's website there 's no answer to be found there .	St

1.2.1	Today 's systems can share IRQs .	St
1.2.2	What OS are you having an issue with ?	Ques
1.2.3	In fact , what is the issue ?	Ques
1.2.4	Most of the time it 's the out of date BIOS or one forgot to load the motherboard driver package .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Rare to see IRQ conflicts on non-ISA boards .	St
1.3.2	Just some thoughts -- -- & gt ; & gt ; From your post I see 2 IRQ 's listed , 5 and 11 .	St
1.3.3	Is their more and if not , why ?	Ques
1.3.4	... My System ... IRQ 0	St
1.4.1	you 're able to run your PC if u r accessing the internet and doing other stuff , yes ?	Ques
1.4.2	R u able to change display property settings ?	Ques
1.4.3	Is the new card listed in Device Manager ?	Ques
1.4.4	Do you have to disable onboard video in BIOS to use the new card ?	Ques
1.4.5	device manager & gt ; video & gt ; gforce & gt ; properties & gt ; and see if u can set configuration manually .	St
1.5.1	Sorry that was just the conflicts/sharing info .	St
1.5.2	Here 's the IRQs IRQ 0	St
1.6.1	I 'm able to use the display settings not a problem .	St
1.6.2	It 's just that WINXP PRO is automatically assigning the IRQs and cluttering up 5 & 11 and I ca n't figure out how to reassign .	St
1.7.1	This should have been just a simple upgrade from a 64mb Geforce 440 MX to a 128mb Geforce5200 FX .	St
1.7.2	The computer is 2 yrs old and I did n't want to spend too much on a video card for a pc with a AMD Athlon XP 2000+ .	St
1.7.3	I was planning on building new next year when I hope my budget is less restrictive .	St
1.8.1	Usually the PCI slot nearest to the AGP slot is hard wired to share an IRQ , no way to change that .	St
1.8.2	I would remove the serial port on IRQ 3 and the video card in device manager , then reboot but stop at the bios setup screen .	St
1.8.3	In bios , disable the serial port on IRQ 3 , or both if you do n't have a modem , and if your bios allows , set the APG slot to IRQ 3 .	St
1.8.4	Reboot into Windows and see what IRQ is assigned .	St
1.8.5	If you disable the parallel port , your printer may stop working .	St
1.9.1	Is windows reporting a conflict or are you reading it this way ?	Ques
1.9.2	PCI devices are designed to share IRQs and controlled by the O/S .	St
1.9.3	Unless windows is saying their is a problem your issue lies elsewhere .	St
1.9.4	This statement & quot ; If I try to access too much information whether it 's a game or mutliple websites the system crashes. & quot ; Before or after video card install ?	Ques
1.9.5	2 year old system 1. power supply may be getting weak .	St
1.9.6	2. power supply too small with new card 3 .	St
1.9.7	Are you overclocked ?	Ques
1.9.8	4 .	St
1.9.9	Heat 5 .	St
1.9.10	Open Task Manager - & gt ; log your CPU and memory use .	St
1.9.11	6 .	St
1.9.12	( slim , very slim ) H/D failing Bill .	St
1.10.1	Also , some motherboards sugggest you not use PCI slot 1 if you can help it ( the one next to AGP ) .	St
1.10.2	You mentioned having all slots filled .	St
1.10.3	Old video card was n't an issue , but new could be ( heat , for one thing ) .	St
1.10.4	Probably not , but what are all your slots filled with ?	Ques
1.10.5	chuck	St
1.11.1	slot 1 is empty ( too close to heat sink on new video card anyway ) Heat not a problem according to temp .	St
1.11.2	Slot 2 is Lucent modem ( not being used so I disabled it running DSL through ethernet anyway ) Slot 3 ethernet card Slot 4 Sound card Slot 5 USB 2.0 card	St
1.12.1	After start up if I go to IE system crashes on MY MSN .	St
1.12.2	But not on homepage .	St
1.12.3	This was only after new card install .	St
1.12.4	( new card was purchased only to meet requirements of newer games ) But after new card install System crashes on Splinter Cell Pandora tomorrow and HitMan Contracts ) Have n't loaded other games out of frustration .	St
1.12.5	Crashes mostly occur after inital start up .	St
1.12.6	Not overclocked ( do n't know how ) Heat apparently not a problem .	St
1.12.7	Multiple fans all working nothing too close to VidCard .	St
1.12.8	Temp within safe ranges .	St
1.12.9	Can open case with big fan blowing still crashes .	St
1.12.10	CPU usage does seem to have some high random spikes .	St
1.12.11	Power supply should still be adequate .	St
1.12.12	My prev post included FAQ from NVIDIA cite stating the VID card needs it 's own IRQ .	St
1.12.13	( was n't my assumption ) So far unable to achieve it 's own IRQ assignment .	St
1.12.14	I Disabled Serial and Parallel ports ( not being used anyway ) Disabled Lucent Modem on PCI slot 2 ( also not being used , DSL is wired through Ethernet card slot 3 ) Slot 4 is sound card Slot 5 is USB 2.0 card WINXP PRO keeps reassigning randomly it seems , below is latest IRQ assigns .	St
1.12.15	It still keeps humping up on IRQ 5 & 11. yet 3 , 4 , & 7 are unassigned .	St
1.12.16	IRQ 0	St
1.13.1	You 'll have to change the current thinking to get this to happen .	St
1.13.2	I will share that your symptom is consistent with out of date BIOS , motherboard drivers and overtaxed power supplies .	St
1.13.3	Usually I watch people reload the OS a few dozen times till these areas are addressed .	St
1.13.4	Your choice ?	Ques
1.13.5	Bob	St
1.14.1	You need to think new thoughts ... .. Modern M/Bs ' with PCI slots SHARE IRQs .	St
1.14.2	The IRQ assigment is controlled by the Operating system .	St
1.14.3	Open Device Manager if windows does not show any devices with conflicts then you have none ... .. forget NVIDIA .	St
1.14.4	& quot ; new card was purchased only to meet requirements of newer games & quot ; This is what Bob and I are seeing ... .	St
1.14.5	If the BIOS - M/B - drivers are not all up to date your system will not work properly with the new card .	St
1.14.6	& quot ; After start up if I go to IE system crashes on MY MSN .	St
1.14.7	But not on homepage & quot ; What is Home Page ?	Ques
1.14.8	Any other sites affected ?	Ques
1.14.9	Check , in safe mode , for spy-ware/virus .	St
1.14.10	& quot ; Crashes mostly occur after inital start up & quot ; Time element to crash ?	Ques
1.14.11	What application are you using and how many ?	Ques
1.14.12	Bad application install can cause system crash .	St
1.14.13	I do n't play games , too old and slow , but from what I understand each game has its own requirments ... back to drivers ... . outdated drivers cause system crash .	St
1.14.14	CHECK M/B capactors .	St
1.14.15	Crowned , bulging or leaking replace M/B .	St
1.14.16	Recheck seating of memory and AGP card .	St
1.14.17	More than one memory chip ? ...	Ques
1.14.18	pull one stress it by playing a game then the other chip .	St
1.14.19	Pull new card ... . same symptoms ?	Ques
1.14.20	( a real streach ) Bad Video card ?	Ques
1.14.21	I know ... lots of questions and no true answers ... .	St
1.14.22	But this is what troubleshooting is about .	St
1.14.23	Bill .	St
1.15.1	Replaced m/b .	St
1.15.2	caps were shot .	St
1.15.3	Good call on that one .	Sug
1.15.4	Replaced the old DFI AMD mainboard with a new MSI Pentium .	St
1.15.5	Doubled the CPU and RAM now everything is shiny and happy .	St
1.15.6	Thanks for the advice .	St
