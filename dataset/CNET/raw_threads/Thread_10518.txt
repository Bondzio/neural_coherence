I wanted to upgrade it, no big deal just dissable the old one right? I called into dell and the guy said that a new graphics card could never be installed. That sounded ridiculous to me. Does anyone know why my computer would not be upgradable? given I will probably have to upgrade my power supply as well (250wt)

There isn't an AGP or PCI-E slot I think based on a little Googling I did about that Dell model. Why would you assume there is such a slot in on entry level system? Regards, JB

Yes, though if you get a new motherboard then you have to see what can be transferred over as well as the limits of the case as some cards are known for being rather big. My suggestion would be to consider getting a new computer that can be easily upgraded. Regards, JB
