i don't see where you're going with this.
i have a budget of $900 for the hybrid plus accessories, which is why i'm looking at the atom based ones.
i don't need 16 hours, but if i did, i'd stick to the asus vivotab tf810c plus keyboard dock or the latitude 10 plus 4 cell battery.
i didn't mention text conversion at all.
