all mechanical devices have a life expectancy in that they will eventually fail.
at five years, your hard drive is getting a little long in the tooth.
today's hard drives are getting more and more inexpensive.
my suggestion is to get two external drives, and alternate backups to both.
if a drive eventually fails you will still have the other backup version.
i would also suggest backing up more often than a few times per year.
remember, your pc hard drive will also eventually fail, and you will want your backup to be as current as possible, especially with the quicken files you are storing.
