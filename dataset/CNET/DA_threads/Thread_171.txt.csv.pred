1.1.1	My current network is a wireless laptop and wireless desktop that works together perfectly.	St
1.1.2	I would like to add a new desktop occasionally hard connected to the laptop so the second desktop could be seen and shared through the laptop.	St
1.1.3	Can I do this?	St
1.1.4	Just plugging the cable didn't work and the laptop lost connection to the wireless network.	St
1.2.1	Such a setup is far from automatic.	St
1.2.2	Next time just wire it to the router.	St
