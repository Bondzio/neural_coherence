1.2.1	Your two Raptors would be setup as Primary Master drive .	St
1.2.2	You can use the larger drive as a Slave to either Primary or Secondary depending on how your cd/dvd , cdrw , dvdrw is connected .	St
1.2.3	I run 2x40G in RAID 0 as Primary Master , Primary Slave is cd/dvd-rom , Secondary Master is cdrw-rom and Secondary Slave is a 46G hard drive .	St
1.3.1	I assume your Raptors are attached to SATA1 and SATA2 .	St
1.3.2	Adding 1 or 2 additional SATA drives *recommended* : + Attach your new SATA drive ( s ) to SATA3 and or SATA4 ( on the board 's edge below the PCI slots ) ; + Enter your BIOS and go to Integrated Peripherals ; + Open SATA Devices Configuration ; + Set SATA3/SATA4 RAID to Disabled ; + Go back to Integrated Peripherals ; + Open IDE Devices Configuration ; + Ensure SATA3/4 are set to Enabled ; + Save and exit the BIOS ; Adding 1 or 2 IDE/ATA drives : + If you have 2 optical ( CD/DVD ) drives , make sure they are attached to the same cable ( you may have to change the jumpers to make one a & quot ; slave & quot ; or both & quot ; cbl sel & quot ; if they 're on seperate cables ) ; + Connect your IDE/ATA hard drive ( s ) to an 80conducter cable ( usually provided with the drive and/or mobo ) ; + If connecting 2 hard drives , set jumpers for both to & quot ; cbl sel & quot ; ; + Connect your hard drive cable to your vacant IDE2 port ( on the board 's edge below the RAM slots ) ; + Enter your BIOS and go to Integrated Peripherals ; + Open IDE Devices Configuration ; + Set OnChip IDE Channel1 to Enabled ; + Save and exit the BIOS ; + Re-enter the BIOS and open Standard CMOS Features ; + Confirm that IDE Secondary Master and Secondary Slave are set to Auto ; + Save and exit the BIOS ; Once this done , you 'll need to partition and format your new drive ( s ) in Windows .	St
1.3.3	For large drives ( & gt ; 32gb ) use NTFS or the manufacturer supplied drive setup software .	St
1.4.1	Many thanks !	Polite
1.4.2	I 'll give it a shot !	St
1.5.1	Watch out for too much heat generated from the HD 's .	St
1.5.2	Make sure you have some type of fan blowing over them if they are all going to be crammed into one area , or spread them out inside the case .	St
