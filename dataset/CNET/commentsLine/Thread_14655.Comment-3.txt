it is not well covered i reviewed the suggestions in the thread & they are masks not fixes.
turning off valid warnings from windows, buying external hubs, downgrading usb 2.0 to usb 1.0, replacing power supplies and all of the other suggestions are wrong bob.
after 23 years in it i think i would not waste my time to post a true solution in a forum only to be chided by a forum moderator.
i resent your condescending response because you obviously did not bother to read my post or the posts in the thread you refer to.
you were an active participant in the thread so you should have realized my post was not a repeat of any information contained in the 14 pages of discussion the systems with the problem folks are asking about obviously cant wake from hibernation & sleep properly and the usb ports are properly reporting a surge.
the correct solution is to disable hibernation & sleep so the usb ports dont take a shot every time the system wakes up!
furthermore i challenge you to find the fix i posted someplace else bob.
i doubt you will find anything anywhere on the web mentioning it.
unless it is a forum that i just posted to submitting the same details i sent you.
furthermore if you even bothered to read the posts in the link you sent me you would have seen that disabling hibernation and sleep is not mentioned a single time.
additionally after reading all of the some 200 posts you refer to, i saw you several times encouraging people to do a bunch of useless gyrations like applying patches and buying new parts or telling them they have bad hardware.
when all they had to do was disable hibernation & sleep.
