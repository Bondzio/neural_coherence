the hp has a faster and cooler runnign processor, a faster hard drive with more than twice the capacity, a better sound card, built-in hdtv tuner and record, but a weaker video card.
the 8600gt can struggle in games unless you're willing to turn down the resolution and the effects/detail level.
to make the hp a good gamer, you'd need to upgrade to at least a 9600gt and replace its 350w power supply with a 450+w unit.
