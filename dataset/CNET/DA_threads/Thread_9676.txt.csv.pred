1.1.1	Hello, I am looking to upgrade my brother's pc with a PCIE-16x video card.	St
1.1.2	But he only has a PCIE-1x slot available as well as a regular PCI slot.	St
1.1.3	Is there any way to install the PCIE-16x card with an adapter or something?	Ques
1.1.4	If not, what would be a good cheap PCI or PCIE-1x card to install?	St
1.1.5	I'm mostly looking to play games released in the past few years like Doom 3, Half Life 2, and BF 2142 with good performance.	St
1.1.6	Preferably a card with at least 256mb.	St
1.1.7	He has a Dell E310 with 2.8 ghz, 1gb RAM, Win XP.	St
1.1.8	And his psu is only 230w.	St
1.1.9	He has an integraded Intel(R) 82915G/GV/910GL video card.	St
1.1.10	The PCIE-16x cards that I have considered are the Ati X800XL 256 mb or the Ati X1950 Pro 256.	St
1.1.11	I know he would need a higher wattage psu for the X1950, if not both.	St
1.1.12	Anyway, thanks for any help.	Polite

1.2.1	Read http://www.tweaktown.com/reviews/1045/pci_e_x1_graphics_performance_with_galaxy_geforce_7300gt/index.html	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the link.	St
1.3.2	Does anyone know how well the Radeon X1550 PCI 256mb would perform on some recent games like BF 2142?	St
1.3.3	The PCI version, not the PCIE version.	St
1.3.4	Thanks.	St
1.4.1	Read reviews at http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814103031 It's not much faster than a fx5200 so keep shopping.	St
1.4.2	The card I noted should done much better.	St
1.4.3	Why isn't that an option.	St
1.4.4	If you can find a fx5700 in PCI form I'll write it's nice for games prior to 2006.	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	I can't find the x1 card you recommended anywhere for sale.	St
1.5.2	But there's an x1550 512 x1 card on Newegg that I found: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814161079 Any thoughts on that one?	St
1.5.3	I'll check out the fx5700.	Sug
1.5.4	Thanks a lot.	St
1.5.5	Josh	St
1.6.1	&quot;Pros: works great.	St
1.6.2	runs battlefield 2142 on high settings on my Dell E310.&quot; Try that one.	St
1.6.3	Note that some had to do some metal work to get it to fit on some machines.	St
