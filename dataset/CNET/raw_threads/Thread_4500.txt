The X1300/X1600 are current generation cards; the X1300 is the low-end card, and the X1600 is the mid-range card. The high-end current generation cards are the X1800 and X1900. You'll notice that the card names all have suffixes, such as the ATI Radeon X1900XTX. I won't get too deep into the suffixes; I'll tell you that XT is better than pro, and GTO is better than GT. I could also get into the CrossFire dual video card stuff, but I don't feel like it. -Nathan

I do know a bit about high end ATI cards, because I want to buy I new computer sometime soon. I am also fairly knowedgable about Crossfire and stuff. I was wondering, if I was to upgrade my AGP FX 5700 LE video card to something less than $200 tat plays Oblivion and other such games fairly well. Would the X800, X1300, or the X1600 fit into that criteria well? Thanks for the help!

I'd suggest that you build the new PC. If you want to play Oblivion, I'd recommend the X1800XT for $280ish on newegg. But the X1800XT is a PCIe card, so get that with a new comptuer.

I am planning to get a new computer, but I would rather get a newer car (7900 GTX or 1900 XTX) or even SLId or Crossfired cards. Anyway, if I was to upgrade my computer, which of these cards: X800, X1300, X1600 or any other AGP cards you think are good should I upgrade my computer with?
1524	6	171142	1902602	1898626	nathanpsz2	4/27/06 11:53 AM	1.14613878E12	7900GTX and X1900XTX...	...are PCIe cards. What is your budget for the new AGP card?
1524	7	171142	1903422	1902602	sunnydjs	4/27/06 7:38 PM	1.14616668E12	Clarification	Sorry, I meant that I would buy one of these new cards for the new computer. I would rahter the card I buy be under $200, So I can make the new computer really good. Any suggestions, such as the X800, X1300, or the X1600? They obviously have to be AGP cards. Thanks for the help!
