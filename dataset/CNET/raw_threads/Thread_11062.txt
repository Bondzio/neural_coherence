I need firmware for both. The info I gathered on each: Ricoh Company RW5125A DVD/CDRW and... HP CD-WRITER PLUS 8000 Series 4x2x20x IDE HP C4465-56000 Please help, two drives down the drain really stinks I'll get more information or pictures if need be.

Firmware	Try here for latest. http://www.met.com.tw/eng/download/lists/list_03.htm You'll need software to play movies or burn discs, but no drivers. You didn't mention things like PowerDVD (Cyberlink) or Nero, so we don't know what you already have. chuck
