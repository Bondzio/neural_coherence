1.1.1	Hi guys : I have this new motherboard ECS KT600-A I purchased a couple of days ago with 1 Athlon XP 3000 .	St
1.1.2	I installed a piece of 512MB DDR3200 400MHZ but it will not start .	St
1.1.3	It boots and flashes the bios part where it recognizes the CPU but at that instant it shuts itself down .	St
1.1.4	I removed the piece of memory and of course it will not boot but it does not however shut itself down ( it remains on ) .	St
1.1.5	I thought it could be a piece of bad memory but I grabbed a 512MB DDR2700 which supposedly it 's supported by this MoBo but yet it does the same thing : it shuts itself down after displaying the kind of CPU it has .	St
1.1.6	Could it be a wrong set jumper of some sort .	St
1.1.7	I memory form ULTRA and they say it 's 100 % compatible .	St
1.1.8	Could it be the CAS latency of this memory ?	Ques
1.1.9	the MoBo manual says it does not support other than 2.5 CAS latency .	St
1.1.10	What should I try next ?	Ques
1.1.11	Thanks guys	St
1.2.1	call place of purchace let them tell you use warrenty	St
1.3.1	CL [ CAS ] 2 will run at 2.5 if the mobo only supports 2.5 Not sure that the shuts down/not shuts down is a clue .	St
1.3.2	AMD CPU 's do n't shut themselves down , the mobo detects the overheat signal from the CPU and shuts down .	St
1.3.3	I do not think that the mobo shut down function can work without memory .	St
1.3.4	I would worry that your CPU is getting too hot too fast and explore that entire area before powering up again .	St
1.3.5	Of course I could be totally wrong , even incorrect .	St
1.3.6	LOL	St
1.4.1	Too Add AMD heat sink is notched .	St
1.4.2	Double check that it is installed correctly .	St
1.4.3	Also check that heat sink fan is pluged into the correct port .	Sug
1.4.4	Also look at capactors for leakage or crowning .	St
1.4.5	Ray System only appears to be running w/o memory .	St
1.4.6	You will see the fans running and if speaker is attached a beep code will be heard .	St
1.4.7	M/B , most models , will detect CPU over heat and shut down the system .	St
1.4.8	Bill	St
1.5.1	would work without memory .	St
1.5.2	I have little faith in the AMD mobo shutdown systems .	St
1.5.3	They can vary widely based on age and type of CPU and MOBO .	St
1.5.4	Thanx , mountain top man .	St
1.5.5	LOL	St
1.6.1	Two different versions [ 1 and 2 ] of Soyo mobos and one PC Chips [ three of them ] simply do not beep .	St
1.6.2	They do have the pins on the mobo for a speaker , the & quot ; normal 4 pins .	St
1.6.3	Some give the signal name for three of them , one of which is Vcc .	St
1.6.4	All of the cases I am using only provide a little cylindrical gadget [ assume that it is a speaker ] with the two outer pins wired .	St
1.6.5	Have tried moving one of the outer pins to the third slot , still never get a beep .	St
1.6.6	Have no idea what a third wire for a speaker is for .	St
1.6.7	[ BTW , also have tried speakers removed from older cases ] .	St
1.7.1	& quot ; little cylindrical gadget [ assume that it is a speaker ] with the two outer pins wired .	St
1.7.2	Have tried moving one of the outer pins to the third slot , still never get a beep & quot ; What is being moved ?	Ques
1.7.3	Some boards do have speakers attached permanently to themself , have n't seen one that could be moved .	St
1.7.4	Model and make of board ?	Ques
1.7.5	Bill	St
1.8.1	they run two wires from the speaker to a small four pin connector that plugs onto the pins on the mobo in the area of the front panel stuff .	St
1.8.2	All that I have seen , and have here only have two wires , the other pins empty .	St
1.8.3	BUT some have the wires on pins 1 and 3 , others on pins 1 and 4 .	St
1.8.4	[ that 's why I move one of the pins to try both configurations .	St
1.8.5	These mobo manuals give designations to 3 of the 4 pins , one being Vcc .	St
1.8.6	Makes zero sense to me .	St
1.8.7	BTW I know that the little cylinder is a speaker because I heard one work in some devicw some time ago .	St
1.8.8	The manuals for these mobos make no mention of beeps or beep codes , and I really miss that beep at startup .	St
1.8.9	LOL [ also get no beeps for error configutations ie no video ] BTW , the & quot ; speaker comes with the case , not with the mobo .	St
1.8.10	sounds as if the mfrs may not be talking to each other .	St
1.8.11	I had a question for Soyo and they responded in two daysm well written .	St
1.8.12	I guess that I 'll have to ask them .	St
1.8.13	I made a prior post about that subject .	St
1.8.14	Hope that you Floridians are finished getting attacked by nature for a while .	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
