i must be extreamly lucky.
one of my hd's is a western digital wd800jb that i've had since 2002 and it is in its third computer since new and they all have stayed on 24 hours a day except for power outages.
i figure it has over 359,000 of power on time.
i have another hd in there, an ibm dtla-307045, that has been in there almost 3 years that a friend gave me that came from an old business computer and i've put over 250,000 of use on it and there is no telling how much use it had before i got it.
of course, i have a case fan mounted in front of my hd bay (antec case).
i also have a total of 8 fans in my case including fans on the cpu, memory and chipset controled by the digital doc 5,  plus i have either 2 or 3 fans in the power supply.
