<s> Recently my Dell Latitude D400 died (Primary disk 0 error) but fortunately (or so I thought) I had recently backed up to Maxtor one touch II (100G) external hard drive. </s>
<s> However, when restoring the most recent restore point all that I can access on my new computer (Viao SZ230P/B, Windows XP O/S) are old files (ie my most recent files won't seem to come across to my computer from the external drive). </s>
<s> This is even though I can see the newer files on the restore point on the external HD. </s>
<s> When I try to restore the new files individually it appears to work but when I try to open them on my computer I get an 'access is denied' message. </s>
<s> Can anyone help. </s>
<s> I am in a bad way here and could lose lots of very important information and hard work at that.... </s>
<s> Thanks a lot. </s>
<s> All suggestions gratefully received. </s>
