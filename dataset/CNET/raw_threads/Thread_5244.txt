I have the new comp. sitting right next to the old one. With the cable in the old one (Windows XP, Dell Dimension) there is no problem - the DSL connects fine, IP address auto detected, smooth as you like. The ISP assigns this comp. a fixed IP address; always the same. But the new computer (Windows XP, Gigabyte GA-8N-SLI Royal motherboard with dual onboard LAN - Marvell 8053 chip / Marvell 88E1111 phy) won't connect. The best I can get with autodetect is &quot;the network did not assign a network address.&quot; Repair doesn't work. Manually entering the old computer's IP/DNS settings doesn't work, pinging the server doesn't work. So - what do I do? Is it a problem with the ISP refusing to recognize this new device (if so, how does it know that, anyway?) Do I need to get them to change *their* settings to allow this new comp. to connect? Or is the LAN broken? Still scratching my head...
