Thanks for the help.
None of the original computers on the network had ever needed the driver install before today (using built in drivers, I guess) I did the driver install on the netbook, and pow!
there was the printer.
Repeated the process on the other XP machine and likewise.
Now we can print from any of the computers, regardless of the OS or location!
Thanks.
