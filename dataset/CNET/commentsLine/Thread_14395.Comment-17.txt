that forum sticky and what's there is hard won knowledge.
thanks to a kind member for helping craft the posts there and a few others that i found useful.
that content is hard to argue with but i find some that want to enable wpa2 plus mac filters plus hiding ssid and what else then complain.
these basic settings seem to pay off all over.
glad it helped you out.
