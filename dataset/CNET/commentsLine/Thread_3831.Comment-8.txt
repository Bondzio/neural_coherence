i am also having this issue but it may not be totally the router's fault.
this problem occurs with my dell studio 15 laptop running win7 home premium which i purchased early this year.
but i don't have this problem with my 4 year old lenovo thinkpad t61 laptop running winxp sp3.
so that tells me that there is a compatibility issue between the internal wireless adapter in the dell and the belkin.
i did try to muck around with the advanced wireless card settings in the dell but i had to be careful as i am not a networking expert and was afraid of making the problem worse.
i was hoping to find a posting somewhere that specified some settings that could be changed to fix this problem but my broader searches on this issue seems to point to a firmware problem.
