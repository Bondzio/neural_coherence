<s> No make, model or link to the machine's manual so I'll just write &quot;BIOS setting.&quot; </s>
<s> As stated by Robert, you can reboot or once power is returned to system cause a reboot of that system. </s>
<s> However, because this is a power issue, its far better to allow it to sit out until &quot;stable power&quot; is present. </s>
<s> If the power is erratic or on/off as it were, repeated reboots/start-ups could corrupt the system. </s>
<s> I suggest you have a more protected system as in stand-by power, line conditioner and surge protection in all or varied forms. </s>
<s> Having this will reduce any real or reduce damage to h/w and/or reduce some s/w corruption or allow a proper shutdown at least. </s>
<s> If your power problems are constant than this is your best way to help yourself. </s>
<s> I offer this as the post you supplied provided little info. </s>

<s> UPS (uninterruptible power supply) or sometimes called a battery backup. </s>
