<s> I have been looking into moving my hard drive from my computer to my network. </s>
<s> I am also in the market to purchase a new router. </s>
<s> I am trying to decide if I should purchase a router with a usb port or a separate storage device for my network. </s>
<s> I don't want to spend too much since all the NAS devices I have found are at least $200, but I have read bad reviews about accessing data through a routers usb port. </s>
<s> Thoughts? </s>
<s> I find most try this and immediately return the HDD back to the USB or other port on the PC. </s>
<s> The reason is that almost every time the drop in speed has the owner fuming. </s>

<s> That was my big concern. </s>
<s> I was not sure about the reliability of setting up a system like this. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I find most NAS to be reliable because folk don't move the units around. </s>
<s> The most common reliability issue with external drives is that they are dropped. </s>

<s> Is there a brand or specific product that you would recommend? </s>
<s> As a NAS is all over the map with some offering features that some would demand and others will not, it's a shop, shop, shop till you find the unit that fills the bill. </s>
