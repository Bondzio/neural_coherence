It's usually a PEBKAC error.
Users will try to do something they either shouldn't or can't, or hose up their machines with a gazillion running programs in the background, or they expect too much out of a PC that just barely meets requirements, or are filled with adware, spyware, trojans, etc.
As I said, a properly configured and clean machine will perform as advertised.
