I recently upgraded from a junky S3unichrome integ chip to a GEforce FX 5500 256MB, but the performance on games seems very poor. and not high end ones like doom 3. stuff like railroad tycoon 3. well a computer enthusiast friend of mine came to check my comp out for problems, she said i had like three memory addresses for one card! the other strange thing is, my card is AGP 8X, but when i check the display adapter's location, it says PCI BUS 1, device 0, function 0. shouldn't it say AGP 8X slot or something to that effect? or am i showing computer ignorance? I have a Athlon XP 2800+, 333 mhz FSB, 512 MB PC 2700 DDR SDRAM. i know these aren't great specs, but it should be able to run games from 3 or 4 years ago with out dipping under 30 frames! I don't have any spyware or any other types of malware. any help would be GREATLY appreciated thanks! socket A by the way

Remove any spyware, trojans or virus. 2. Update motherboard drivers. 3. Update video and sound drivers. -&gt; NO Microsoft Update Driver button will do this. Bob
