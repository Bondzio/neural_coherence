You know, when I started repairing computers not he early 90s, there was no internet, so no forums... how did I manage?
Guys like you make my life liveable!
And of course, as you realise, I didn't do a search.
At least I don't think I did it was late at night here in England.
But I think I assumed this was a one-off...
Thanks again will get the hot poker out tonight!
