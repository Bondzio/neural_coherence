the problem is that the device was working ok, and after the same cable was used to connect a digital camera with the computer, it did not work anymore since it recognizes the drive as optical storage and does not read any kind of cd.
it seems to me that the device does not communicate at all with the computer (it must be it since there is no driver for the cd-rw drive).
