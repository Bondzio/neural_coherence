My friend said that the wires need to be connected for the sockets to work. For example, cable A is connected in its respected slot and cable B is connected in its respected slot. How would I connect cable A to cable B? In fact how would I connect the cables together if there were 4 or 5 cables that need to be connected? I have a guess that I would need to create some sort of jumper wire between the sockets but I don't want to jump the gun on this one and have to redo all the work. If more details are required just ask. I am still new to most of this but working on learning as much as I can.

You cannot &quot;piggy back&quot; a digital connection. Voice OK, not digital. Have you noticed that there is no provision on the connector to add another wire? There's a reason for that.
