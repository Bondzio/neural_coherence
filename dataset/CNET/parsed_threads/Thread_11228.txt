<s> I have a d-link wbr-1310 router and everytime the phone rings and is picked up, my internet connection becomes unplugged. </s>
<s> I am new with routers & Cox Cable says it's the router. </s>
<s> Has anyone any information on the set up that would have caused this to happen? </s>
<s> It's very frustrating. </s>
<s> Remember I am a rookie too. </s>
<s> that becomes unplugged, I would guess both the router and the phone are operating within the same frequency range. </s>
<s> Try moving the base stations further apart and change the channel that the router operates on. </s>
<s> Thanks I will try that. </s>
<s> Not sure how to change the channel on the router but will get the book out. </s>
<s> Thanks again for your help. </s>
<s> I changed the channel two times and it still is doing it. </s>
<s> My digital phone connection is close to my router so I suppose maybe a different phone on a different mgz speed might help? </s>
<s> you have tried moving the two further apart. </s>
<s> The house is wired close so I can't move it any farther. </s>
<s> Do you think a different router or phone mghz would help? </s>
<s> I could buy a new phone. </s>
<s> I have a Netgear router I could hook up that is a WG102 model. </s>
<s> Thanks for all of your help. </s>
<s> It's much appreciated. </s>
<s> go for the phone change. </s>
