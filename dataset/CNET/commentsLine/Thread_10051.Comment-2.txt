get one of these instead:  the lukwerks camera is simple to setup and the software is excellent.
it's a little more than you want to spend, but you will want to smash the wireless ones against the wall after hours of fiddling with them and still not getting them to work right.
many radio shack stores are starting to carry this lukwerks camera, so you might want to check it our there and see if it fits your needs.
