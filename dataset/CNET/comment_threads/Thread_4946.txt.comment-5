Scandisk scans the HDD sector by sector and it has a better and more rigid testing parameters than checkdisk.
If it finds a bad sector, it tries to recover the data written on that defective sector then transfer it elsewhere to a non-defective sector.
Scandisk thereafter patches or marks that defective sector as bad so that any data will not be written on it later on.
If bad sectors had been reported in your HDD, then you have to prepare yourself for HDD replacement.
Back-up all the files.
Don't re-format it (I am referring to the defective HDD) , erase important personal files so you can show the defect to the shop where you bought it, of course, if it is still under warranty, else, you need to buy a new unit.
