Because I built the machine, but I will contact ASUS soon.
I just post problems on forums because they are a lot more helpful than most technical support, who tell you just to upgrade drivers to get you out the door quickly.
I just restarted my machine to get into the BIOS and I think its completely freezing when it gets to the splash page as I cant hit DEL.
