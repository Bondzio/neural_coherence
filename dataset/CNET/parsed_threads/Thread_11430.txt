<s> I am a Graphic Designer who has a Mac that I use for all my graphics and web design but I have found that if I want to get into Web Development, Macs just dont cut it. </s>
<s> My mac is great for what it does so I wouldn't need a extremely fast PC for those purposes but I don't know what kind of machine I would need to learn the Development part. </s>
<s> Money is tight so I am thinking about building my own, so what kind of set up should I be looking for in a PC for web developing? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Track down John Robie and ask him. </s>
<s> He'll know what you need. </s>
<s> Thank one, but I have no experience in Graphics Designs or Web Development. </s>
<s> Edward O'Daniel has a handle on it here: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7591-0.html?forumID=26&threadID=91859&messageID=1037441 Nvidia also has some good info for developers: http://developer.nvidia.com/page/home.html </s>
<s> I think I can help you after all. </s>
<s> One of my clients is an elite-level software developer (PhD in Comp Sci, master of more languages/architectures than I can remember, etc. </s>
<s> ), and I'm sure he can tell you exactly what you need for web development. </s>
<s> I'm also surrounded by photographers, illustrators, graphic artists, animators, mega geeks (people who think &quot;cluster computing&quot; is a basic requirement for a decent home network), and modders who build combination PC/goldfish ponds! </s>
<s> How did these people get into my life...and who left the friggin' door open! </s>
<s> And if you could: 1. </s>
<s> Make a shopping list of all the things you'd like to do in terms of &quot;Web Development&quot;. </s>
<s> (Microsoft .NET, C#, etc.) </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Include all the design software you plan to use. </s>
<s> (Photoshop, Illustrator, Maya, Houdini, etc.) </s>
<s> (BTW, John Robie can help you a lot in selecting the best video cards, etc...as can Ozos...and the gaming stuff usually surpasses the requirements of most design software. </s>
<s> I'll also check with my friends to be sure.) </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> List everything in order of importance--with things you'd be willing to drop closer to the bottom of the list, and must-haves near the top. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> You've said that money is tight, but a &quot;ballpark&quot; budget would be very helpful. </s>
<s> Once I have your technical and budgetary requirements, I'll ask the Prof. and the others to put their heads together and come up with some recommmendations. </s>
<s> The way I see it, it should be fun! </s>
<s> Give yourself credit where credit is due. </s>
<s> Anything you don't know, you sure know how to find out. </s>
<s> You know your gaming stuff, and you're also the best &quot;over-all&quot; guy I've seen on these forums. </s>
<s> And if anyone needs to know where to get the best price for a rig... </s>
<s> Thanks one and robie for all the info, basically I don't really know what im getting myself into. </s>
<s> Im a right brained thinker so coding is not my specialty. </s>
<s> I see that most people recommend PHP, MySQL so thats what I was going to try and focus on. </s>
<s> My mac handles most of the graphics work so I mainly need the PC for the Database/Programming work. </s>
<s> Now for the part that you have been waiting for, and this will make you laugh. </s>
<s> I might be totally out of my mind but I really don't want to spend more than like $500........errr................ok, done laughing? </s>
<s> Probably not.....................ok, you should be good now, if not you are hurting my feelings Anyways, I have the means to spend up to around $1000 but I really just want something SIMPLE but adequate for learning this software but also with the capability to expand in the future once I make some more cash from what I learn. </s>
<s> I am aware the Macs can do PHP and MySQL but it sounds more difficult to deal with rather than just having a PC. </s>
<s> I think maybe the only other thing I would have on there to run is Dreamweaver to do the web integration but thats about it. </s>
<s> I would keep photoshop and all my animation programs on my mac. </s>
<s> I hope this helps! </s>
<s> You guys are great! </s>
<s> Matt </s>
<s> I'll contact the Prof and the biggest Dreamweaver geek I know and ask them what they recommend! </s>
<s> The Prof sometimes scribbles code on napkins at Starbucks (on the days when he doesn't feel like carrying his laptop around), so I wouldn't worry too much! </s>
<s> BTW, his laptop is a Dell. </s>
<s> Are you happy now, John? </s>
<s> (*John and I have this thing about Dell--he says they're great, and I say they're crap!) </s>
<s> I've sent an email to the Prof and one to the Geek. </s>
<s> The Prof is a busy man and the Geek is an inconsiderate @#$% (who, fortunately for you, owes me a ton of favors), so it might take a couple of days to get their replies. </s>
<s> I'll keep you posted! </s>
<s> I don't recall ever saying Dell machines are great or crap. </s>
<s> There are quite a few in Dell's line up that I would never want to own and don't or would not suggest/recommend. </s>
<s> I have 3 desktops that are not Dell, and will have Monarch build (assemble complete) my next computer when that time comes as they have a large quality selection, and can built what I want for the same amount of $'s that I would spend, without me having to put up with assembly & startup problems. </s>
<s> I have several times suggested Dell over another brand of computer because of a Dell particular price and components at the time as a better bang for the $ on a specific comparable desktop. </s>
<s> I have also suggested Emachine and had good words for other brands. </s>
<s> :-) Regards, </s>
<s> Just making sure you were reading my posts, John. </s>
<s> Gotcha! </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> The Prof has answered both questions before the Geek could get his face out of the fridge! </s>
<s> (I've asked around, and the Prof's apparently an &quot;expert&quot; in Dreamweaver as well...surprise, surprise...) Here's what Professor Alex Bushnyy wrote: Hey John! </s>
<s> The PHP and MySQL are very small. </s>
<s> You don't need a powerfull PC. </s>
<s> My laptop is too powerfull for that. </s>
<s> You can run them on any PC or laptop. </s>
<s> Even for a bigger application like Dreamweaver you don't need a big PC. </s>
<s> But you are right - it makes sense to have a good video card/graphic accelerator. </s>
<s> Your friend, Alex (It's nice to have friends like this guy!) </s>
<s> Both John Robie and Ozos can give you excellent advice on video cards! </s>
<s> Fetch http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/50/07645684/0764568450.pdf for a quick overview of tools and more Bob </s>
<s> Hey guys, thanks a million for all your help and your research! </s>
<s> Sounds like the professor knows his stuff. </s>
<s> Now you are making me think about possibly going for a laptop. </s>
<s> I don't really want to take up more space in my apartment and I don't have a laptop which would be a nice toy as well Not to drag this discussion along any longer but do you guys have any suggestions for a good sub $1000 laptop? </s>
<s> I know this is the wrong board so ill probably skip on over there, but you guys have been so good and helpful I might as well ask the pro's here. </s>
<s> Thanks a million! </s>
<s> Matt </s>
<s> start a new thread for &quot;who makes the best laptops in the $1000 range&quot; or something like that. </s>
<s> We'll see you there! </s>
<s> BTW, If you run into any &quot;major&quot; snags (i.e. </s>
<s> seemingly unsolvable problems) after you start your new life as a developer, I'd be happy to ask the Prof for advice on your behalf. </s>
<s> He's very quick to share...and he cuts through code like a Raptor breaking a fast! </s>
<s> At the office we spent 720 and 829 plus 19 bucks shipping for 2 Athlon 64 R3000 refurb laptops from compgeeks.com They have 512M RAM, 60GB HD, Wifi, Bluetooth, USB 2.0, Firewire, DVD/CDRW, SVideo out, memory card reader and get from 2 to 4 hours on the battery depending on what you do. </s>
<s> One unit has the 1024x768 standard screen, the other widescreen. </s>
<s> One has the floppy (we never use that). </s>
<s> Full restore CDs are included. </s>
<s> There are a bazillion sub K laptops if you consider factory refurbs. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Wow, that is a really great deal, who is the maker of the laptops and have you had good luck with them, im sure factory refurbished is good, but my parents got a dell refurb and its been nothing but trouble, so im a little hesitant. </s>
<s> I am sure it was just luck of the draw but still a little weary. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Matt </s>
<s> The neat part is that the seals and boxes are from HP. </s>
<s> HP did the refurb and not some fly-by-night outfit. </s>
