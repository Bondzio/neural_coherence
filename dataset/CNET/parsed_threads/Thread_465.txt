<s> Still runs fine for what I do....which isn't much of anything worthwhile. </s>
<s> Last May I decided to build a new system. </s>
<s> I have been an AMD man for many years but with the Intel duo E8400 coming out I switched. </s>
<s> So now I have an Intel Core2 DUO E8400 dual running at 3.0 GHZ with 2 gigs of PC2-8500 dual channel Ram. </s>
<s> The motherboard is a Gigabyte P35-DS3L. </s>
<s> I kept my old 500gig SATA2 Seagate and my Antec case, LG DVD drive and 650W power supply. </s>
<s> I also kept my Nvida Gforce 7300 512M video card. </s>
<s> What a difference between my old overclocked AMD X2 4800 running at 2.6 GHZ and the new Intel. </s>
<s> I hate to admit it but I was wrong all these years about AMD being the best. </s>
<s> Intel rules. </s>
<s> Oh well we learn by doing. </s>
<s> HP xw6400 workstation. </s>
<s> Going to work with my older custom 3 yr old box. </s>
<s> About Six months ago my P4, 3 gig mobo went south for the second time, so I decided it was time for a new system. </s>
<s> Went with a Core 2 quad, 2.4 gig, 4 gig ram, Vista Business, duel Nvida 8800 GT's (SLI) with duel Acer 22&quot; widescreen LCD's. </s>
<s> Originally I went with a Creative Audigy card but recently switched to a Razor instead. </s>
<s> Love it! </s>
<s> Bill </s>
<s> I'm a college kid. </s>
<s> This is the laptop I got from my boarding school 2 years ago. </s>
<s> Can't really afford to replace it and it runs Ubuntu fine. </s>
<s> I would want to switch more if I gamed, but I do not. </s>
<s> I bought mine off uBid.com refurbished and got a bigger power supply and a new graphics card. </s>
<s> The whole thing cost me about $800 and can play any of today's games on max settings perfectly (except Crysis, that's not fair). </s>
<s> Does everything with zero problems, I installed Vista Ultimate with no slowdown. </s>
<s> I completely reformat it every 2 months or so to keep it running fast. </s>
<s> Main machine is Win XP/Pro SP3 I had built in Feb'08: Indel Core 2 Quad 6600, eVGA nFource 780i MB, 2x2GB PC-6400 RAM, nVidia GeForce video with 512MB, SLI capable, pair of WD Raptor X's in RAID-1 for sys/programs; pair of WD Caviar 500GB in RAID-1 for data, Cooler Master case + PS; Floppy; modem, DVD. </s>
<s> Have a ~7 year old HP laptop ... adequate because I require so little of it. </s>
<s> Also an old Compaq driven by Linux/Ubuntu and a Mac PowerPC G4 with OS-X 10.4. </s>
<s> Do web development on the XP/Pro machine, use the others to check web compatibility and to play with. </s>
<s> New machine can be overclocked and the socket will take several CPU upgrades. </s>
<s> Waiting for Windows 7 to spring for 64-bit computing. </s>
<s> As is, am pleased with configurations. </s>
<s> IBM Thinkpad A20p not enough RAM and keys are worn but it still runs.. </s>
<s> I traveled around the US with it for two years and then coffee shop visits for 3 more. </s>
<s> I bought it when it was at least a year old and refurbished. </s>
<s> It had to have the hard drive replaced while under warranty but really hasn't given me too much trouble until I tried to run Windows XP. </s>
<s> The computer was built by a custom house in new york, and has a Q6600 quad processor, 4 gig of ram and 3 internal hard drives. </s>
<s> I had windows Vista installed and Microsoft Office Small Business. </s>
<s> I have also added tons of other things too. </s>
<s> I use Pinnacle Studio 10 on it, and it is really a pleasure to do video editing with a quad processor and 4 gig of ram. </s>
<s> It works smooth as silk. </s>
<s> I also have Nero 8 installed too. </s>
<s> I use Firefox 3 with Thunderbird 2. </s>
<s> Also have Adobe Reader, Irfanview, Picasa 3, Hypersnap 6 which is a windows capture program, also i tunes and quick time. </s>
<s> I have three other browser including IE7 which I never use. </s>
<s> I use Zone Alarm and AVG 8 both free programs for security. </s>
<s> There are also several other support type programs installed. </s>
<s> Best computer that I have ever owned. </s>
<s> Spared no expense to have what I wanted. </s>
<s> I also have Memeo as a back up program for my 750 Western Digital Free Agent drive. </s>
<s> I also have a nice array of Vista gadget programs sitting on the right side of my 24&quot; wide screen Samsung Monitor. </s>
<s> My primary computer is less than a year old - a Dell XPS210. </s>
<s> Secondary computer is also less than a year old - a Dell Latitude D830 laptop. </s>
<s> Purchased both because I wanted to get a new desktop and new laptop with Windows XP while it was still available and avoid changing to Vista. </s>
<s> I am not ashamed to say I have three six year old desktops with Windows XP as OS. </s>
<s> After tweaking similarly aged PCs owned by friends & neighbors, I learned that it is a matter of optimizing one's PC that he gets the best out of it. </s>
<s> Even six-year old PCs can come to life like new if the proper tweaks, software & hardware, are made. </s>
<s> A friend of mine had a Windows Vista but because he knew little found himself complaining his PC is slow. </s>
<s> When I did the usual tweaking I do, I found out he could not achieve the speeds that his PC had because he did not take good care of it. </s>
<s> Some of the software I have tried that worked includes ATF Cleaner, CCleaner, nCleaner and Tune Up Utilities. </s>

<s> The computer I use most of the time (and the one I am using right now) is a Gateway laptop that I got in July for $400 off the regular price. </s>
<s> It has a Core 2 Duo T5600, and 3 GB of PC2-5300 DDR2, running Vista Home Premium. </s>
<s> I hated Vista until I got this unit. </s>
<s> The fact that it came with Service Pack 1 helped (I still refuse to touch 64-bit Vista), as does this machine's power. </s>
<s> I have two other computers of my own, one of which came with Vista Home Premium, and the other with Home Basic. </s>
<s> Both of them are now running XP Pro, because I couldn't stand the performance and instability. </s>
<s> Even downloading SP1 fixed nothing; it doesn't seem to do any good unless it comes pre-installed. </s>
<s> One is 2 years old, and the other about 1 year old. </s>
<s> About 3-1/2 years old. </s>

<s> I replaced the DVD-ROM and repaired the DVD burner. </s>
<s> Replaced the hard drive after it started failing. </s>
<s> And Upgraded the RAM to 2GB (max). </s>
<s> Other than that, it's been running fine and is fully compatibe with: Windows XP and Vista Linux (any distro I threw at it) and Mac OS X Leopard (small hacker experiment that lasted a few weeks) </s>

<s> My present machine is four years old and does everything I want it to do. </s>
<s> I would maybe up-date my machine but amd not completely sure that &quot;Vista&quot; is for me. </s>
<s> Maybe someone out there could convince me otherwise and let me know the obvious advantages of doing so? </s>
<s> I decided with the advent of walking talking grandchildren, I needed something I could do video editing on as well as work so I built a relative monster. </s>
<s> Started with am intel DX38BT Motherboard, combined that with 4g of DDR3 Memoryand q6600 cpu added a pair of ATI 3800`s in Crossfire, added a pvr 3000 video/tv card and 2 300g HDD`S and dual dvd drives with a memory card reader, all in Chakra case. </s>
<s> Put the whole thing together with 2 Asus pw19 Monitors(The most sexy looking monitors in my opinion ever) and just for good measure and good looks a DiNovo Edge Keyboard and an MX revolution Mouse. </s>
<s> The black beauty runs on vista ultimate sp1, and I have never had any problems with it.I would also imagine that unless it gets stolen this machine will see me well through the next windows os, with the possible exception of upgrading the cpu to a q900 series. </s>
<s> I have an Acer dual core notebook with 2GB RAM running Vista Home premimum. </s>
<s> I am very happy with this machine. </s>
<s> It's a Toshiba Satellite A200-S01 acquired in January - 2.2GHz C2D, 2GB DDR2-667, 2x160GB drives, HD-ROM/DL burner, a/b/g Wifi, 512MB HD-2600 mobile video chipset, and thoroughly exorcised of Vista - XP SP3 with help from DriverPacks.net and nLite. </s>
<s> Battery life is...rather pitiful when compared to the iBook I refurbished - granted the iBook used no more than 45W at full power, the C2D CPU uses that much power itself - but I got it because of it's gaming ability. </s>
<s> A week ago I bought a used desktop Dell from a dealer for 50 (GBP). </s>
<s> I don't know its age, but it's probably 4 to 6 years. </s>
<s> It has Windows XP Professional. </s>
<s> I wanted a change because my previous machine had Windows ME. </s>
<s> The new purchase has 512MB RAM and a 40GB disk. </s>
<s> It doesn't have a CD burner, but I could have had one for a few pounds more. </s>
<s> I use my computer mainly for web browsing, word processing and radio streaming. </s>
<s> It plays video, but I don't use that function much. </s>
<s> I wondered whether I should risk 50 on what could turn out to be a waste of money. </s>
<s> It has turned out to be one of the best bargains I've ever had. </s>
<s> My old PC wouldn't accept the data transfer wizard, but I tranferred most stuff I needed with a 1GB flash drive, and emailed other stuff to myself. </s>
<s> Pictures can also be stored on a photo processing site, then downloaded to a different computer. </s>
<s> There's a way round any problem. </s>
<s> I've done a free online virus check on my new buy. </s>
<s> Everything's fine. </s>
<s> Unless you want the latest bells and whistles, a second-hand PC seems to be a great buy. </s>
<s> Go ahead and laugh. </s>
<s> I have a six-year-old Dell Dimension 2300 with an Intel Celeron 1.8 GHz processor and Windows XP. </s>
<s> I still have a 3.5&quot; floppy drive (do they still make those? </s>
<s> Do people even *use* them anymore? </s>
<s> ), but I haven't used it in ages. </s>
<s> The only upgrades I've made to it are adding 1 GB RAM to the memory, and an external DVD-RW drive. </s>
<s> The thing still chugs along pretty well, but I'm thinking of upgrading very soon, once finances to do so become more available. </s>

<s> 4 monitors, a 20 inch widescreen HP LCD monitor, a 17 inch HP LCD monitor, a 15 inch samsung LCD monitor and an old 28 inch GE TV that I play most my movies on. </s>
<s> Given her 2 internal 120gb replacing the single 20gb hardrive that was in her. </s>
<s> Even replaced the original Zip drive with a GeeThree: Sweet Multiport. </s>
<s> She even still uses an original Apple airport card. </s>
<s> All in all since I'm not a big gamer and more a movie nut I mostly play several DVD's , Divx, Xvid, iTunes, and quicktime movies on her plus casual web browsing. </s>
<s> She also does hard work encoding video's over an Xgrid with my much older G3 iMac witch was recently upgraded to 1gb. </s>
<s> ancient technology you say? </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> Does it get the job done? </s>
<s> HELL YEAH!!!! </s>
<s> XD (And for those that want to know I'm still running Tiger on the G4 and G3 since it was the last great OS for the PowerPC architecture.) </s>
<s> Seriously, why? </s>
<s> Conventional hard drives only get so many good reformats. </s>
<s> They are like CD/DVD-RW. </s>
<s> You only get to erase it a certain number of times before its no good. </s>
<s> Have you ever tried using something like CCleaner? </s>
<s> Or how Disk Cleanup and Disk Defrag? </s>
<s> I know reformatting keeps the thing fast, but every time you have to reload all your games, programs, and other apps (unless you have complete hard drive backup images). </s>
<s> Now I use CCleaner and Revo Uninstaller. </s>
<s> These clean out all the junk and remove any unused programs at my discretion without leftover registry entries. </s>
<s> Keeps my Vista x64 PC running as quickly as the day I built it. </s>
<s> I run Intel Core2Duo E7200 at 2.53 GHz, 4 gigs of DDR2 at 667 MHz, GeForce graphics card, and a 250 GB SATA II hard drive. </s>
<s> Ultimately, what you do is your choice, but the above programs/suggestions may make your computing life a little easier. </s>
<s> I use a ThinkPad Z60m. </s>
<s> It's on every day for at least 9 hours, and works beautifully. </s>
<s> Hard drive died last year, which surprised me (ThinkPads are normally synonymous with quality) but was actually a blessing in disguise. </s>
<s> I put in a new 100 GB hd and installed Ubuntu. </s>
<s> Ubuntu takes advantage of all the fun stuff this ThinkPad can do, so in no way do I miss Windows. </s>
<s> This machine, with a 2GHz processor and 1.2GB ram, has exceeded my expectations in every way. </s>

<s> I bought a Mac Book Pro a few months back for my main office computer ( yes, I went tot he dark side, but hey, it just works), and I just bought my wife an Acer Aspire One netbook for use around the house while surfing the internet. </s>

<s> God moornin: I have a titanium Powerbook (Apple)--867 MHZ. </s>
<s> I mostly use it for word-processing and surfing the Internet, but I would like the functionality of the Intel Apples to be able to run Windows for some of the applications I want to use. </s>
<s> I have Virtual PC but it runs really slowly and the screen is tiny. </s>
<s> But I have loved this computer more than the ones I have had before--I have had Macs since 1984 and the very first one with 128k RAM! </s>
<s> I am interested in the new line of Apple laptops, which I have yet to see. </s>
<s> My new laptop will be, as it is now, my only computer, so I am swithering between the portability of the Macbooks and the bigger screen on the MacbookPro. </s>

<s> My first and only computer. </s>
<s> 1 gig ram cd-rewrite, DVD player/burner etc but they gave me a bootleg windows OS. </s>
<s> Well now 4 yrs later the only original part is the Mobo. </s>
<s> I've cut holes in the side panel added additional RAM, Fans & Lights recently a new Heatsink fan. </s>
<s> I found out about thermal gel by accident actually purchase some before I needed it, I've learned a lot,just dont ask me to count RAM. </s>
<s> My main (work) desktop is a two-year old Intel iMac, and it's running beautifully! </s>
<s> I like the dual-boot ability allowing me to switch to Win XP with a simple 'restart'. </s>

<s> I've been eyeing one of Dell's XPS laptops lately. </s>
<s> Deciding between a XPS 15&quot; or 13&quot;. </s>
<s> I built my own computer, when I first builit it I had put an intel 915 board in it and now I just recently within the year put a DP35 board in it. </s>
<s> Have two optical drives 4G of ram runnng Vista ultimate. </s>
<s> Love it. </s>
<s> I also have 4 laptops and a xbox 360 that are all wireless, No wires in this network at all except for the ones comming into the house....lol </s>
<s> If you set it up right yu will loose nothing, I do the same thing but I have an extra dfew drives that I store all of my important data on like photos, word documents etc. </s>
<s> So when I reload all I have to do is reload the OS and the drivers. </s>
<s> I usually build my own boxes and I've really gotten upset with the constant un-needed changes. </s>
<s> I have an AMD Athlon XP 3200 CPU on a SOYO Dragon MB with a gig of ram, 160 gig WD HD, ATI 128 AGP graphics, Creative Labs sound with XP as the OS. </s>
<s> I keep it alive and it still serves me well for graphics and work. </s>
<s> I've been working with PC's since the dawn of the Tandy Home computer. </s>
<s> Heck I even had an Osborne. </s>
<s> What gets me is how we've become slave to the OS rather than the other way around. </s>
<s> Every upgrade that comes out from Microsoft has required a substantial hardware upgrade which creates an incredible surge in the waste stream. </s>
<s> My question to everyone is, do you really need that much computing power? </s>
<s> The average home user never hits the limit of their PCs' capability because all they're doing is sending e-mails and surfing the net. </s>
<s> That can be done with cheap, less power hungry boxes or laptops. </s>
<s> I still recall my favorite software bundle of all time. </s>
<s> It was Geoworks and it would run on a 286. </s>
<s> AOL actually used it as their GUI before switching to then Windows 3.1. </s>
<s> Geoworks had everything a home user needed. </s>
<s> I know some people like to chase the technology but think about it. </s>
<s> Over time, how much money do you spend doing that and do you really need that much power ? </s>
<s> Will you ever reach the full capability of your PC if you are an average home user? </s>
