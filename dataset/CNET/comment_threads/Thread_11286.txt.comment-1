i'd like to clear off all the unnecessary junk that's piled up into my D drive; &quot;deleted&quot; files, etc.
i just want to know if there's a way to do this without reformatting my computer, what's safe to alter on D, and whether such an action would harm the rest of my computer.
i'd really like to clear some space, etc., but i don't know the necessary motions to it.
