<s> I've hardly used used SCSI for years but I've kept a beige G3 attached to a scanner via SCSI under System 9.0x, just for the odd bit of scanning we do. </s>
<s> The G3 video card seems to have crapped out, so my first thought was to attach the scanner to a G4 that still has a SCSI card. </s>
<s> But the G4 is now running 10.4 and no longer recognises the SCSI card. </s>
<s> (It doesn't show up in the system profile at all.) </s>
<s> Sorry, I don't know the make of the SCSI card. </s>
<s> I've found a driver/application from VueScan that should get the scanner working. </s>
<s> If I can get the SCSI card working, I should be home and dry. </s>
<s> you will need the drivers for OS X to make it do anything. </s>
<s> It may(?) </s>
<s> show up as something in the System Profiler but if it doesn't, this could mean that it is a defective card. </s>
<s> Surely there is a manufacturers name or some other distinguishing mark on the card. </s>

<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> I've pulled the card out and I've found the legend 'Lite On'. </s>
<s> Their own site doesn't seem to have anything about computer-related products. </s>
<s> Anything else I've found on the web seems to be of historical interest only. </s>
<s> Any suggestions gratefully received. </s>
<s> Are a big manufacturer of electronic components for computers and other devices. </s>
<s> Theyalso make scanners, motherboards, CDRoms, DVD burners, just to name a few. </s>
<s> However, I cannot find any reference to a SCSI board. </s>
<s> Adaptec were always the SCSI board of choice for the Mac and probably still is. </s>
<s> They have a 2906 model, part number 1772900, which may be suitable. </s>
<s> It mentions OS X (10.1) but it would be worth the price of a free phone call to find out. </s>
<s> the card is $65 www.adaptec.com P </s>
<s> I appreciate your time and effort. </s>
<s> I'll check out Adaptec 2906 model, part number 1772900. </s>
<s> Now that you've got me thinking, I may even have an Adaptec SCSI card somewhere. </s>
<s> Whether it has OSX support is another issue but it's another route I could try. </s>
<s> Cheers. </s>
