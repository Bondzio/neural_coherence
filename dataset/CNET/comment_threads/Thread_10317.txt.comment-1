I jsut installed the Belkin PRE-N Network Desktop Card on one of three PC's in my home.
The main issie I'm having with the card is something in the device manager saying &quot;out of system resources (code 12)&quot;.
I looked into this and couldn't find anything that might have conflicted with the Belkin card.
I looked in the the &quot;resources by type&quot; in the device manager and opened up the IRQ settngs and couldn't find any devies conflicting or having a problem running except for the Belkin card.
Has anyone run into a problem like this at all?
