More specs on the PC: HP Pavilion 7950 CPU is an AMD Athlon Processor 384 MB of RAM (been upgraded twice) Hard drive capacity: 55.8 GB Free space: 35.4 I have an old McAfee VirusScan v. 4.5.1 SP1 that I'm not sure has ever been updated.
Aside from that I occasionally run AdAware and Spybot on this thing.
Oh, and I tried using Add/Remove Programs to remove any old Windows updates in the hopes of extracting the offending startup sequence, but to no avail.
It still shows my SYSTEM folder...
