hi, i am getting different answers from different people.
could anyone shine some light on me please?
i am using a cable modem to connect to the internet, and i need wired internet access for 2 pc's (one vista and one xp).
i don't have lan configured, and i don't want the two pc's to be connected to each other.
the tech from my isp told me that i just need a hub or switch, but the rep at the computer store told me that i need a lan in order to use the switch, so if i don't want a lan i should use a wired router instead.
so, do i need a router or a switch?
also, if i connect more than one pc's to the router or switch, is the connection speed going to drop?
thanks a lot!
