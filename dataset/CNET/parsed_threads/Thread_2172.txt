<s> When I turned on my computer this afternoon, it had an abnormal buzzing sound coming from it that did not go away. </s>
<s> I had it on for an hour to hour and a half and it buzzed the whole time, so I turned off and used my laptop, and when I went to pull a couple files off the computer it still buzzed the half an hour it was on that time. </s>
<s> It did the noise a few weeks ago but it stopped after half an hour that time and hasn't done it since. </s>
<s> When I searched the internet for possiblities to the noise, one thing I kept seeing was that it could be a failing power supply. </s>
<s> Could that be it? </s>
<s> My computer is a 5 year old IBM, store bought, with only the hard drive and network card being update in that time. </s>
<s> How would I be able to check to see if the power supply is failing? </s>
<s> Or are there any other suggestions of things to check. </s>
<s> Would it be safe to use it for short periods of time (like half an hour here and there) in order to burn some files, if I find it is the power supply, until I can get a new one? </s>
<s> can be narrowed down to some hardware component that is not spinning freely. </s>
<s> Usually a cooling fan has stopped operating but the motor that turns the fan continues. </s>
<s> Open the case and spy the cooling fans. </s>
<s> Or look for a buzzing bee that lost its way. </s>
<s> It is hard to find a noise after it has stopped but cooling fans are usualy the problem. </s>
<s> IF it's the cpu fan and it stops could damage the cpu. </s>
<s> Best to open the case and check to make sure that the fans are working. </s>

<s> I opened up the case and looked for anything obvious that was possibly interferring with the fan and didn't see anything. </s>
<s> Blew out a good amount of dust from the heat sink fan. </s>
<s> Both that and the fan in the power supply rotated from the canned air, but I will have my brother inspect them as he knows more about this than I do. </s>
<s> I am going to assume you are meaning to check them while the computer is running, So I will crack her open again to see how both of them look. </s>
<s> I know that some air was coming from the fan in the power supply when it was on, but perhaps it's not up at the correct speed. </s>
<s> Well with the case open I could clearly tell it was the heat sink that is making the noise. </s>
<s> It was running, but it was making the humming buzzing noise (not sure what best describes it). </s>
<s> I noticed that as pitch of the sound changed, the fan would slow or speed up accordingly. </s>
<s> Will this likely need to be completely replaced? </s>
<s> I glaced at NewEgg just to get an idea on price, and all the compatibility listings confused me. </s>
<s> How do I know what I need to look for? </s>
<s> It's just the fan attached to the heat sink. </s>
<s> The heat sink is just a chunk of metal with cooling fins on it to transfer heat away from the cpu. </s>
<s> The bearings on the fan are on the way out. </s>
<s> Dont use the unit until you replace the fan or you may end up replacing the cpu as well. </s>
<s> To get a new fan/heat sink replacment 1. </s>
<s> What kind or processor. </s>
<s> Make ( Intel or AMD ) Model ( PIII-P4 or Althon ) and Speed of the processor. </s>
<s> Some fans are a standard size the are screwed on to the heat sink and maybe you can just replaced the fan. </s>
<s> A good heatsink/fan $20~30. </s>
<s> A replacement fan $5~8. </s>
<s> Your choice. </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> It's a Pentium 3, 440 mhz I believe. </s>
<s> So I shouldn't have too much trouble finding one to fit, hopefully. </s>
<s> That was a big concern since it's getting a bit old by computer standards Thanks </s>
