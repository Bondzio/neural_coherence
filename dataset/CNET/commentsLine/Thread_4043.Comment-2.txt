that machine will suit you admirably for the tasks you describe.
leopard will not be a problem for it and i'm sure it will not have any problems with future os changes.
my old g4 will be running leopard when it is available.
the radeon card is suitable, besides which, you don't actually have a choice and you cannot change it.
if what you want to do is what you say, then go ahead and get it if you can wait a month or two, os x 10.5 (leopard) will be released and installed on your new machine p
