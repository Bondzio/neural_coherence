1.1.1	Hi All , I would like to know if it is possible to get this setup to work ?	Ques
1.1.2	I have a cable modem .	St
1.1.3	From the cable modem I go to a netgear hub .	St
1.1.4	From my hub , I connect one port to my router ( which has two 2k PC 's behind it : works great ) .	St
1.1.5	from another port on my hub I connect directly to a test PC I have set up ( just a plain XP install with no data on it ) .	St
1.1.6	I would like this to be exposed to the internet .	St
1.1.7	The two PC 's behind the router work fine .	St
1.1.8	It 's the exposed PC that ca n't get an DHCP or DNS address .	St
1.1.9	Is this config possible or do I need a second ISP account for my XP box ?	Ques
1.1.10	If push comes to shove I can put the XP box behind my router and add its IP address to the routers DMZ .	St
1.1.11	To me , this looks like it would accomplish what I 'm trying to do .	St
1.1.12	Correct ?	Ques
1.1.13	I 'd still like to know if the first config is possible .	St
1.1.14	Thanks , Bruce Thanks , bruce	St
1.2.1	It 's an invalid setup .	St
1.2.2	While once could buy another IP from the Cableco , no one will help you create invalid configurations .	St
1.2.3	Why do this since most routers have a DMZ entry ?	Ques
