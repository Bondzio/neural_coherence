Yesterday, I plugged in an HP OfficeJet 4215xi printer and set it up for network printing. When I tried to print from Vista 32-bit Home Premium, the printer refused to print. I checked the queue, and it's showing the document and a &quot;Remote Downlevel Document.&quot; I've researched it and I know that it's causing the problem, but I can't figure out why it won't delete from the queue. Any ideas?

If it fails then, then be sure the printer is acknowledged as default, etc., to be active, don't swap USB ports, return to actual port. Otherwise, the printer port resets to #1, #2, start to collect, delete all those and reboot. Now, when the USB port acknowledges the printer(default), then send to print document. This problem is also present to non-networked printers. tada ------Willy
