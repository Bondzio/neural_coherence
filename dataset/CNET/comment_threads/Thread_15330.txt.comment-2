You probably have access to another AC cord, swap it your monitor one and retry again.
I rarely have any incidents of bad AC cords, far more bad PSUs.
Since, you mentioned a 10yr.
old system, well can be time to replace if you can find another similar PSU if not a better one should you want to repair.
As for accessing any data/files, remove the HD and mount in ext.
USB case and/or similar adapter in order to retrieve.
Google for ADA-2020 adapter or locate ext.
USB cases that match your HD requirements.
