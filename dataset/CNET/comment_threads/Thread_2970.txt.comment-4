I agree that newegg is a good site, but also worth a review is www.pricewatch.com It will list common items from many suppliers in price order.
You may find what you want at a cheaper price or on clearance.
Things like memory, drives, CD's video and sound cards are worth shopping especially if you know the specific ones you want.
