<s> Depending on the motherboard you will see some 2.0 to 3.5GB reported. </s>

<s> I was thinking it was the way you described, but with everyone running around with their own info on the internet these days it's sometimes hard to tell what the real deal is. </s>

<s> Who wouldn't prefer a 24 jewel watch over one with a mere 17? </s>
<s> Same thing with RAM anymore. </s>
<s> 2x2GB sticks is cheap and easier to sell than a 3 GB configuration. </s>
