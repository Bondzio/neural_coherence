<s> I just purchased a Gatway Desktop model GT5014 with 250 hard drive. </s>
<s> I noticed of clicking noise from the hard drive, the noise sound exactly like a clock ticking, This happens only when I am online. </s>
<s> if I sign in and leave PC alone, the ticking noise still ocur once every one, two or three secound, Then it incresse a bit more faster when browsing the web. </s>
<s> If anyone of you know the problem or know how to solve it, please share. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> On the internet there will be more disk activity as content is cached and fetched. </s>
<s> So far I don't see an issue except you have a new machine and it's new sounds may make an owner nervous. </s>
