&quot;--&quot; is probably the only response your system can give as it's hosed.
The error 50, is probably telling you to replace the bios chip itself as its gone too far to recover or it has failed.
You're stuck and need to replace the bios chip and really there's no routine to recover on your own.
Contact a 3rd party bios maker, I suggest http://www.badflash.com or any other vendor/service.
These things happen.
