shows two +12v rails at 18 amperes.
this means you have to go to the list, pick a video card then off to reviews to sniff out how much power the card draws from the psu.
since we want to use half the rating for this that's 9 amperes at 12 volts or 108 watts.
there's a lot of cards that exceed this and most cards do not supply this value which is why we are checking reviews.
good hunting.
too bad that wasn't a single rail psu.
