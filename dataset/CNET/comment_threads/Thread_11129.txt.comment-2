Hi everyone, I just realized that in theory a std should set the specs and therefore all routers should have the same a) download/upload speeds and b) coverage Strength/distance..
However, antennas, radio RX/TX, maybe even packet management and other matters may differentiate a) & b)...
So, I'm back at having to read all the reviews... Has anyone had to buy an N std, Dual Band Router recently?
Did anyone have to read all the reviews concerning a) & b)?
Can anyone cut my research time and give me the reply?
Thanks to anyone who did the research and is willing to share it.
Ciao, Tommaso
