<s> It offers me to back up to my D: drive which is alrealy almost filled up with movies.....and a E: drive which is my DVD player .... My HP Personal Media Drive is simply not recognized on a drive even under the Windows Explorer which recognizes my devices. </s>
<s> ...Should I check my ports? </s>
<s> they do work with my Wireless Platronic headphones and Targus Chill mat both is which use the other USB ports. </s>
<s> What am I doing wrong.. even my EaseUs Todo Back up program does not recognize the HP Personal Media Drive. </s>
<s> Ask your friends to test that drive. </s>
<s> If it's out of warranty you should replace it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Bob, Yes, it is about 4 years old and out of warranty...seems a crying shame since I never got to back up anything on it. </s>
<s> I spent alot of money for nothing. </s>
<s> I will take it into Best Buy Geek squad and if they do mechnical tests on it and find it is truly damaged I will just buy another external hard drive this time an SSD IF they sell SSD external hard drives with large capacity...in the meantime, I have to find a way to unload large sections of my SSD C: drive It is now down to 6.82 GB free of a 119 GB capacity.... </s>
<s> I do wonder if my Windows 7 32 bit operating system is to blame for any of this..??? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> And 4 years is a very long time for an external. </s>
<s> Sounds like it did well. </s>
<s> By the way, if it's like all other externals it's a drive in a case and a cable. </s>
<s> THREE PARTS. </s>
<s> You can replace the part that failed. </s>
<s> For me I carry a cable in my recovery kit that I can test the drive with. </s>
<s> Here it is. </s>
<s> http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=2020 I do that so often I don't give it much thought. </s>
<s> Why would you consider SSD for an external? </s>
<s> Sounds pricey and for now, still don't trust that media. </s>

<s> Bob, I was told the Solid state drives are much much harder to ruin than the standard drive.That is why I want one. </s>
<s> for storage. </s>
<s> I have ruined so many standard hard drives I got sick of them. </s>
<s> So far the Solid states is doing very well... Do you have a different opinion about them ? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> If you use your old ext. </s>
<s> HDs as in frequent in/out use of storage it may succumb to the same hassles of failure. </s>
<s> If on the other hand, you simply store data it may work out OK. Also, if older HDs were handled wrongly or got roughed-up then that too is why older HD tend to fail. </s>
<s> While SSD may provide use in that situation, look-up the &quot;TRIM cmd.&quot; to see why SSD can fail. </s>
<s> Also, the same proper handling and placement of ext. </s>
<s> HD still apply. </s>
<s> review all the horror stories and see why externals fail by the cat(pets), kids, falls, storms or long use even. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Don't take my word on it. </s>
<s> Read from https://www.google.com/#hl=en&safe=off&sclient=psy-ab&q=ssd+data+recovery+almost+impossible So let's get this straight. </s>
<s> You want a single device to store files on that does not fail. </s>
<s> I want that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>

<s> I want a single device that stores files and will not fail. </s>
<s> Are all these 3 Terrabyte Western Digital My Book Essential USB 3.0/2.0 External Hard drives that Best Buy sells... my only practical choice ? </s>
<s> Thanks for your input.... </s>
<s> If the message is not getting across, let me know. </s>
<s> I rarely cross the threshold at best buy. </s>
<s> I go there to &quot;showroom.&quot; If you don't know what that is, read http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/02/google-best-buy-showrooming-amazon-study-square-register.html You did get many years out of the first drive and it appears you don't want to see if the HDD, case or cable failed. </s>
<s> That's OK but I have found too many good drives inside a broke case. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Bob, I will check these things trust me I will. </s>
<s> Thanks for all your help.. </s>
<s> I will close this topic now... </s>
