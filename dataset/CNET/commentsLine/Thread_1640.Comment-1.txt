i hope somebody out there can help me.
my wife has bought a toshiba laptop with a us robotics 22mbps wireless card.
i am trying to get it to recognize my wireless router on my desktop.
the router is a d-link di-624.
i am on an adsl highspeed connection and my server says everything appears to be working-re the desktop, but the laptop cannot connect.
it worked in a different location other than home (connecting to another network) and it worked in another location using my d-link router.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
