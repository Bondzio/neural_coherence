if you have the restore/recovery cds, use them to reload the usb ability and/or drivers.
if you don't have them, then inquire at acer, there maybe a small cost or argue for them as you didn't get them.
its avaluable item to have, regardless.
the cd should provide a menu item to load usb directly, if not then the acer support website should provide them.
