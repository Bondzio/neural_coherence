<s> Hello experts, I have a dell dimension XPS T850r desktop (ATX casing, PIII, 887Mhz,760MB RAM, WinXP). </s>
<s> It is very slow machine now, and I was trying decide between upgrading it or buying a new one... since my budget is around $200. </s>
<s> IfI bought a new motherbaord, RAM and processor, will the new motherboard fit in the current casing or will there be any misalignment? </s>
<s> Which motherboard should I buy? </s>
<s> I highly appreciate any advice! </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> use the PC for ??? </s>

<s> The current hard drive is 300 GB. </s>
<s> The PC is for general purpose, e.g. </s>
<s> browsing internet, data storage/backup, little bit of Photoshop and word processing. </s>
<s> Also, since it is connected to the internet thru LAN cable and not wireless, I use it to download large files, etc. </s>
<s> This is your manual http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dkub/techovu.htm#system_board_jumpers I don't see any extensions on the mother board it looks like a pretty straight forward ATX mother board. </s>
<s> You might want to write down it dimensions before you go shopping. </s>
<s> Just some general recommendations....get the most universal socket you can find so lots of processors fit it and try to find a board that also can run as many CPUs as possible for your $$$$. </s>
<s> If you up date the MB then you'll most likely have to set your own Bios. </s>
<s> Keep this in mind. </s>
<s> I wouldn't spend much on it. </s>
<s> A new systems about $700.00 that's Vista ready and has a dual core. </s>
<s> If you shop hard you might get one for even less. </s>
<s> There seem to be lots of deals around for mini towers right now, maybe somethings up? </s>
<s> Anyone heard anything? </s>
<s> proprietary and do not accept 'clone or standard AT and ATX' peripherals. </s>
<s> So bottomline, if you're going to upgrade, don't plan on reusing the Dell case and PSU. </s>
<s> I'd optimize and try using the existing system until you save the $$ to buy or build a new one. </s>
<s> Good Luck. </s>
