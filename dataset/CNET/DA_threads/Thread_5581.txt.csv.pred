1.1.1	Hello all , I was wondering how I would go about adding a printer to my wireless network so that it can be used to print something accessing the network via wireless card .	St
1.1.2	I already have the wireless router set up ( it 's a cheap but still useful eHome 802.11 b/g router ) .	St
1.1.3	Both the host ( desktop ) computer and the intended laptop that 's trying to connect are running Windows XP Pro .	St
1.1.4	Unfortunately , I only have admin privileges on the host computer , on the laptop I 'm not sure what I am .	St
1.1.5	When I go to the control panel the all I can access is : Accessibility Options , Display , Keyboard , and Mouse .	St
1.1.6	I also do n't have the run option in the start menu so I ca n't go check the user settings that way either .	St
1.1.7	Anyways , I set up a home network using the Windows XP Network Setup Wizard .	St
1.1.8	It made me make a floppy disk at the end so that I could run the same thing on the laptop .	St
1.1.9	But , when I try to run it the laptop says , that the laptop belongs to a domain and thus the wizard can not setup a network .	St
1.1.10	I now believe that the laptop is just connecting to the internet through the host computer as I set up a shared folder but the laptop can not see it .	St
1.1.11	Thus , any advice as to how to get the laptop to either see the shared folder , or even better , how to add the printer ( which is connected to the host computer ) to tghe laptop would be appreciated .	Ques
1.1.12	It should be noted that when I go to the & quot ; Add Printer Wizard & quot ; on the laptop I can go through all of that stuff but I can not find the URL of the printer to add directly nor can the laptop browse to find the printer .	St
1.1.13	Thanks for the help , I know that this is complicated .	St
1.2.1	I find most do n't complete the wizard or do n't know about firewalls or that the printer driver may have to be installed before the share is connected to .	St
1.2.2	Sometimes I have to install the printer per the maker 's instructions and connect the USB port directly before I go across the network .	St
1.2.3	XP has added obstacles regarding accounts and more .	St
1.2.4	In this discussion http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-6122_102-0.html ? forumID=44 & threadID=198031 & messageID=2129068 we cover all this and more .	St
1.2.5	As this has almost every aspect covered I 'll leave it to you to go over the networking , shares and firewalls we discussed before .	St
