and I checked and replaced the IDE cables for the floppy and CD for testing.
The SATA cable cam brand new with the new motherboard so i think that can be ruled out.
Power supply is fine, and I know for an absolute certainty that the hard drive was working as of last week, nothing has happened to it since.
BIOS can see the drive, so can Windows setup, it just refuses to boot.
I tried FIXMBR and FIXBOOT from the recovery console and it is still hanging at verifiying DMI pool.... Anymore ideas?
