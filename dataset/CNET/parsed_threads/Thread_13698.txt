<s> I was just using my PC like any other day. </s>
<s> Now I am saddened by the fact that I have a BSOD and being unable to use safe mode or trying any other solution just makes me even more sad. </s>
<s> Things Tried That Failed: Safe Mode System Recovery Clean Install of Windows 7 Couldn't keep track of all.... Anyways, I did try the recovery console and did possibly make progress. </s>
<s> I am stuck on the &quot;NTLDR is Missing&quot; error everytime I boot. </s>
<s> As for the clean installation of Win 7, the setup could not even detect my hard drive and this process is very, very stressful. </s>
<s> What caused all of this mess was that I visited a random website and got bombarded with massive malware and programs. </s>
<s> I ended up shutting down my PC and it came up with this mess. </s>
<s> My system before the crash: Windows XP Pro SP2 ASUS M68M-S2 Micro ATX Mobo AMD Phenom II X4 965 BE EVGA GTS 250 4GB Corsair Memory 1TB Hitachi HDD Please help me out. </s>
<s> I'm really having a bad day and it would be grateful to have someone help me fix this. </s>
<s> Thanks if you can. </s>
<s> So, the Windows 7 installer couldn't see your hard drive? </s>
<s> Make sure your computer actually sees it: When you start up your computer, try poking around the BIOS to make sure that it can see your hard drive. </s>
<s> You can access the BIOS by hitting whatever key is next to Setup when you start up your computer and see the manufacturer logo. </s>
<s> If it does not specify a key, try F2. </s>
<s> MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING. </s>
<s> If you mess up something here, it can seriously screw up your system. </s>
<s> The drive listing may be under &quot;Devices&quot; or &quot;Boot Devices&quot;...sorry, I don't know your particular motherboard. </s>
<s> If your poking around the BIOS make sure you make a note of anything you change. </s>
<s> In case you need to undo the action. </s>
<s> Write down where you changed it and what it was origonally. </s>
