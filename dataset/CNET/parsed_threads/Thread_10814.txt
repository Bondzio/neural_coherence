<s> Hi I'm considering purchasing a refurbished HP Pavillion a1657c Specs are: Processor: AMD Athlon 64 X2 4600+ 2.4GHz 2x512KB L2 cache Memory: 2GB PC2-4200 DDR2 Hard-disk: 250GB 7200rpm SATA Drive: LightScribe 16x DVDR/RW DL TV/FM Tuner, 9-in-1 card reader, 56k Modem, Windows XP Media Center multimedia keyboard and mouse included Deal at Fry's is for $499 I don't use PC for playing games or watching video - in short no or minimal multimedia - mainly use PC for surfing/emails. </s>
<s> So just need a basic PC I am thinking of staying away from Vista until all its bugs are gone Can you please advise how this system is? </s>
<s> Also is it ok to go with a 'refurbished' system? </s>
<s> Thanks Rajat Agrawal </s>
<s> My friends daughter has the HP Pavilion 1657c and really likes it. </s>
<s> She does what you are wanting to do plus she is a gamer.The only thing different is she installed a graphics card and upgraded to Vista Home premium which runs great. </s>
<s> As for the re-furb thing, I have never bought one that way and don't know anyone who has. </s>
<s> What kind of warrenty are they giving? </s>
<s> If Fry's stands behind it, that is an excellent price for that computer. </s>
<s> HP gives a 90-day warranty (included in price). </s>
<s> I can also purchase a 2 month warranty for $50, but may pass on it. </s>
<s> Why did your friend have to install a graphics card - I thought the Nvidia Geforce 7500 LE graphics card that comes with the PC is a high-end card and good enough for gaming Thanks for your feedback </s>
<s> After reading your post I called and asked him Why the new card. </s>
<s> He said she wanted something heavy duty with 512MG of memory on the video card. </s>
<s> He said she also had to have the power supply changed out for that card as the 1657C comes with a 300watt power supply and the new card needed at least 450watt. </s>
<s> I have that graphics &quot;card&quot; in my computer and it sucks (well at least for gaming). </s>
<s> It is intergrated, there is no real card, it is a chip built into the motherboard and it lags really bad in FPS' and any other game with decent graphics. </s>
<s> The only plus about that is you have alot of open ports so you can buy any card you want and not worry about taking something else out. </s>
