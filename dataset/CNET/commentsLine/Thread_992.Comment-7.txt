this will take some time to straighten out.
if your pressed for time skip to the last item.
when was the last time you did a defragmentation and error check on your computer?
if you don't have registry repair software get one from this site:  if this fails this is a trouble shooter for ie7 from microsoft  if this fails you may wish to reinstall ie7, java and adobe one of them may have a corrupt file in them that is blocking your access to these sites.
good luck.
