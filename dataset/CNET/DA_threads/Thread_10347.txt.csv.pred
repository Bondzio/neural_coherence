1.1.1	I have a Syntax SV400a MOBO, and recently decided to upgrade processor from xp1700 to a xp2600.	St
1.1.2	So I do all my research and perform this properly, but my system is reading my new processor as an Athlon 1.15Ghz.	St
1.1.3	Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought it should be somewhere around 1.9 - 2.1 Ghz?	St
1.1.4	Do have to do the Flash Bios thing?	St
1.2.1	You don't have to flash the BIOS (ie: update it), but you do have to make some changes to its settings.	St
1.2.2	Someone on the board should have the correct settings, but I can't recall them (the settings, that is) off the top of my head.	St
1.3.1	Read the book that came with the MB.	St
1.3.2	You may only have to change the FSB speed in bios or a jumper on the MB.	St
1.3.3	Check the MB web site for current info.	St
1.3.4	John	St
1.4.1	http://www.vr-zone.com/reviews/AMD/XP2600+/	St
1.5.1	OK changed the jumpers per manual, works like a charm.	St
1.5.2	registering 1.9Ghz.	St
1.5.3	Thanks.	St
