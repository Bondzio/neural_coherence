<s> I had a problem with my computer. </s>
<s> PIV, 512 ram, Win XPsp2, 1.6 ghz. </s>
<s> The other day the computer wouldn't start. </s>
<s> I unplugged it for a while and it fire up. </s>
<s> When it got to the point of loading the anti virus program the computer would just shut off. </s>
<s> Tried this several times and the same thing happened. </s>
<s> Started in safe mode, uninstalled the anti virus program, restarted and everything seemed OK. </s>
<s> When I Started to reinstall the anti virus and the machine shut off again. </s>
<s> I wouldn't restart untill it was unplugged for a while. </s>
<s> I began to think the hard drive was going so maybe a reformt and reinstall windows would do the trick. </s>
<s> Nope, about 5 minutes into the installation the computer would just shut down again. </s>
<s> Tried that several times and it just shuts down. </s>
<s> I figured it was the hard drive was on its way out so I bought a new one, installed it and the same thing happened. </s>
<s> Maybe it isn't the hard drive thats the problem. </s>
<s> The only thing that is in it extra from when I got it is an upgraded video card. </s>
<s> ATI 256mg. </s>
<s> I am now thinking it maybe the power supply that is failing. </s>
<s> The computer is about 6 years old. </s>
<s> Any thoughts. </s>
<s> the problem </s>
<s> How many times have you opened it up to dust it out and clean the heat sinks of the lint, dust accumulation as well as check the fans? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I clean out the inside every 6-12 months, all fans and cooling fins are clean as a whistle. </s>
<s> No dust or dirt anywhere. </s>
<s> Honestly. </s>
<s> http://www.badcaps.net/ Also a CPU heatsink cockeyed can do that. </s>
<s> We have many parts to consider from that to power supplies. </s>
