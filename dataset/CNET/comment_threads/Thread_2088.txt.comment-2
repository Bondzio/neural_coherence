BTW I just saw the other post on being able to transfer from and to a new and old drive.
So, dont answer that.
But, it did bring up another thought, for the past month or so, every time I even remotely BUMP my external, the &quot;ding&quot; noise happens and the notification pops up that the drive has been re-attached or whatever it says.
I wonder if all these problems are simply being caused by the wire?!?
That would be crazy!
Can I buy JUST the wire?
