<s> I have a DLink 514 (I know it is old) connected between my DSL modem and my PC so I can use the wifi in the 514. </s>
<s> Is it possible to disconnect from my PC and to connect to the wifi with the 514 having no wired PC attached? </s>
<s> If needed, I'll upgrade router if later version will do what I'm asking. </s>
<s> Thanks, RON C </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> You need to purchase a wireless adapter, preferably a PCI type for the PC. </s>
<s> You'll need to set up the wireless while wired, then unplug the wired LAN connector and go wireless. </s>
<s> Thanks and yahoo! </s>
<s> I have a PCI wireless so I'll try this evening. </s>
