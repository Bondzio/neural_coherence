I'm thinking of buying a Laptop for the first time but I was curious how much I could get for my Desktop.
Motherboard: ASUS Maximus II Formula LGA 775 Intel P45 ATX Video Card: Radeon HD 5830 1GB 256Bit DDR5 Ram: 8GB G.Skill 2GBx4 DDR2 1100 Processor: Intel 2 Quad Core Q6600 2.4 Ghz + COOLER MASTER Hyper N 520 RR-920-N520-GP 92mm Sleeve CPU Cooler Intel Core i7 compatible Hard Drives: 7200 RPM 250GB Hard Drive Crucial M4 CT064M4SSD2 64GB Power Supply: PC Power and Cooling S61EPS 610W Computer is roughly 3 and a half years old except some parts are newer like the CPU cooler and video card.
Can also throw in a G15 keyboard and a 17&quot; Dell Monitor
