Oh..i see... 1 more thing.
i read somewhere just now that the &quot;msconfig&quot; u could set the max memory or somethign like that.but when i try to set mine to 3gb, the maximum is only 2gb(2048mb).It wont let me go higher.
Here's a picture of what im taking about, http://static1.filefront.com/images/personal/f/frozster/125583/lgkpkeqatf.thumb500.jpg And another question,=D,my computer actually can support window xp 64bit, should i format to 64bit?
does it affect my ram problem?
and from the link &quot; http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366778.aspx &quot; it says that it doesn't really affect because 32bit can support up to 4gb while 64bit can support up to 128gb.so what do you recommend??
=)
