Hi!
&lt;div&gt;I'm currently using a Toshiba Satellite P775 laptop for video editing, graphic design and coding.
For my work I use illustrator, dreamweaver, photoshop, premiere pro and after effects.
The Satellite is fine, but it is slow, it gets stuck and its Intel HD Graphics is not enough for me, and I want a better graphics card.
I think the best solution is to buy a decent desktop computer for the video editing and graphic design, and another little and portable laptop for the programming with enough power to work with photoshop and illustrator.
Can you recommend on good computers as specified above?
Thanks &lt;/div&gt;
