1.1.1	Long story short i had to enable WPA 2 on my home network .	St
1.1.2	I 've tried this once before bu took it off when one of my computers did not allow me to enable WPA 2 on it .	St
1.1.3	I have3 home computers : The main one is running Vista and he other 2 are both XP ( I know that does n't make a difference ) .	St
1.1.4	And they both have wireless cards .	St
1.1.5	Both Linksys .	St
1.1.6	One is Linksys WMP11 ver 2.1 , and the other is a Linksys WMP54GS ver 1.4 .	St
1.1.7	No the latter supports WPA 2 on its setup tab .	St
1.1.8	I am able to enter the password and it works fine .	St
1.1.9	But The other , the WMP11 , is a older card and does not list WPA 2 in the drop down list .	St
1.1.10	However when using XP 's Wireless Connection window , it tells me that it found a signal and that its WPA 2 encrypted .	St
1.1.11	So i open it up , type in the password , it shows a connecting window , and then just goes away after a minute .	St
1.1.12	No error messages , nothing .	St
1.1.13	And i still ca n't get connected on that computer .	St
1.1.14	I 've also downloaded the patch from Microsoft enabling WPA 2 , but i ca n't seem to get it to work .	St
1.1.15	I 've tried everything short of downloading SP 3 , which one person said would help .	St
1.1.16	Is there something i 'm missing with XP 's WPA 2 patch ?	Ques
1.1.17	Is there a way to do this ?	Ques
1.1.18	( I 'd but a new card but i 'm short on money )	St
1.2.1	But please tell why WPA is n't good enough .	Sug
1.2.2	We note this in our forum sticky and have yet to find a good reason to move to WPA 2 .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Honestly i cant tell you , i just know that WPA 2 has better security .	St
1.3.2	If WPA will do the same then i 'll use that insead .	St
1.3.3	Which encryption should i use TKIP or AES ?	Ques
1.3.4	I 've read that WPA is just as good as WPA 2 but harder to set up right .	St
1.4.1	And THAT question is one for the ages .	St
1.4.2	I will share I use the router defaults .	St
1.4.3	Let 's go with the forum admonishment and advice first .	St
1.4.4	Let 's not repeat all the discussions about TKIP or AES .	St
1.4.5	In other words , do you want it to work ?	Ques
1.5.1	Thats all i 've been trying to do .	St
1.5.2	Get it to work but be secure .	St
1.6.1	There is no exploit noteworthy today for WPA that wo n't take months and months at banging away at your network .	St
