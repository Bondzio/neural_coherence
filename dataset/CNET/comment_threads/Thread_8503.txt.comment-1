Hello every one From the past few weeks I've been facing this issue, My PC lags a lot when i open huge applications like Adobe Photoshop (or) Dreamweaver .
I Installed Speedfan and i came to know that my core's are reaching temp 50C when idle and when ever i open applications like photoshop/dreamweaver the core's temperature raises to 65-70C .
i am totally afraid what to do ?
any suggestions please P.S : My cabinet has two built in fans to pull out the heat .
but still i face the same issue .
Here is a link to the image taken from Speedfan http://img217.imageshack.us/my.php?image=core2duohn4.jpg System Information generated by CPUZ .
