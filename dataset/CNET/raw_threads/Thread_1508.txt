This is done through the Mac's airport 802.11b card. As you may know, its range is limited and I wish to extend it. I have an airport express and base station unit but I don't know how to configure them to extend the range of my network. Many thanks.

Hi Melati, when I plug in the airport express unit I always get the flashing yellow light which means that its out of range or something's not right. Anyway when I run the airport express assistant it says that it can't find an existing network. This is weird since on my PC there clearly is a network yet it doesn't show up on the Mac. I'm puzzled as the manual is no help at all. Ta.
