can you tell if it's spinning up ?
it might work if you put it another external enclousre or you cold pull the external case apart, remove the hard drive and add it as a second hard disk drive in any system you can (not as the boot drive) and see if you can get the data off to another hdd.
you'll probably have to connect it to an up to date system with all the patches so you'll get access to the entire 300gbs.
better think about another way to backup your stuff...externals are decent for a backup but a real no no for your only copy of your data.
i've got mine on drive 0 partition 2, drive 1 partition 2 and an external hdd.
let us know.
