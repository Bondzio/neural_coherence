1.1.1	I have just installed my first hard drive and the hardware installation was smooth.	St
1.1.2	Now I have a problem with the partition of the hard drive.	St
1.1.3	I don't understand what it means to partition the HD, and most importantly, how much to partition it.	St
1.1.4	I have a Western Digital 160GB EIDE .	St
1.1.5	I understand that I won't get all that 160GB, but I want to get the most out of it using NTFS because I read that it is more secure than FAT.	St
1.1.6	My computer specs are 900 Mhz, 512RAM, Western Digital 160GB EIDE Please explain what partitioning the hard drive is in lamest terms and please explain how many sections should I partition it into as well as any recommendations.	St

1.2.3	If you're installing a version of XP with service pack 2 you can create one partition for the entire drive.	St
1.2.4	Use the XP installation disc to do this and format with NTFS file system.	St
1.3.1	Yes I'm installing XP with SP2...So I should just go ahead and create one partition for the hard drive and that's it huh?	Sug
1.4.1	Yes I will install windows XP with SP2 So all I need to do is partition the hard drive in one size and I won't run into any problems down the road in the future?	St
1.5.1	Be sure to backup any files you can't live without on a regular basis.	St
1.5.2	For example, if you have numerous pictures and music files you'll want to copy them to some kind of removable media such as CD-R, DVD-R or Thumb Drive and store them in a safe place.	St
