<s> I need to get a new psu my current psu is only 200 watts. </s>
<s> I'am having a hard time figuring out what type od psu i need.I've been lokking for days trying to figure out what psu would work for my pc. </s>
<s> I have a Pavilion 750c and i need at least a 300watt psu. </s>
<s> If anyone could help me because iam completely lost. </s>
<s> Over at www.pcpowerandcooling.com you can find PDF documents with exact dimensions of what I will call &quot;standard size&quot; ATX power supplies. </s>
<s> While I've grown familiar with these to the point I can just look at the PSU then check the connections a new technician will need such a document and learn what the ATX, ATX12V and other power connections are as well as determine if the replacement supply has enough of each connection. </s>
<s> One owner spent a year seeking out a PSU because they couldn't find &quot;the right one.&quot; They were looking for one with exactly the right number of power connections but imagine them passing up unit after unit because it has &quot;too many&quot; power connections. </s>
<s> Hopefully this won't stop you. </s>
<s> Tell me how it turns out. </s>

<s> Because you have a HP Pavilion system, you need a true fit or match. </s>
<s> While you can find replacement psu of larger wattage, it will be expensive for the reason mentioned. </s>
<s> HP does offer larger psus for sale if they still have them in stock. </s>
<s> Just be sure whatever replacement psu you do get is HP compatible and what the return policy is if a mistake is made. </s>
<s> Understand typical generic psu won't work in the HP system unless you're lucky due to tje physical size and shape of the psu in question. </s>
<s> Google HP replacement psus online. </s>
<s> As for PCPowerandCooling, they're very expensive but darn best quality you can get. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> so if i was to find a psu that was the right size would it work or would it have to say HP compatible? </s>
<s> I'm a little sad that it appears you didn't do the research. </s>
<s> If you don't, it's best you take it to the service counter and have it done. </s>

<s> Get the make/model of the machine. </s>
<s> Open the machine and see if there is a make/model/s# on the psu. </s>
