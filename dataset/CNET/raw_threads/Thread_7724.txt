WIN98 was installed with this drive so I know it worked. I have checked to make sure it is securely attached. It spins when I put a disk in but no recognition. Any ideas?

Was this install recent? If so, did you install some OS other than what came with the laptop? If so, you then have to install what MOTHERBOARD or IDE DRIVERS this laptop requires. This is true for desktops as well, but in laptops, they usually supply a restore CD that does it all for you. When a person installs the Windows OS from Microsoft, they learn about drivers... Other items are: - Set the IDE controller to BOTH in Device Manager - NO CDROM items are allowed in Config.sys or the CDROM will vanish. - Test the CDROM with a BOOTABLE CD or with a combo of boot diskette and CD.

I have tried reinstalling WIN98 with a boot disk and got NO DRIVES FOUND when it wanted CDROM support. I attempted to load drivers, screwed up config.sys, had to go back into DOS to change back to previous config.bak Not a skilled worker here.

You may have to fish around the Toshiba web site for them. Be sure to check that setting (BOTH) in the IDE controller (device manager) as well as sharing the content of CONFIG.SYS Bob
