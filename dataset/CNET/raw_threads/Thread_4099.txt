I have a T42 Thinkpad with in-built Centrino/Intel WiFi that usually works well to pick up open source WiFI signals. However, occasionally it fails to see signals that the computers of my friends are seeing, and I'd like to remedy that. However, the questions that I've not been able to find answers to are: 1. Will buying a Proxim Orinoco Gold or a Senao 362 PCMCIA card lead to a better signal sensitivity than my in-built mini PCI card? I haven't been able to figure out a way to tell what the sensitivity in mW of my in-built card is. They specs on the Proxim and Senao are for a sensitivity of 200mW but I've read that they really are more like 100mW. Does anyone know what the sensitivity of a mini-PCI card in a Thinkpad T42 is? 2.Will buying an omni antenna with a 9dB gain and an SMA card lead to a better signal than my in-built antenna? The context for this question is that I've read that because all 802.11g signals have a wavelenth of 12.5 cm this means that the ideal antenna is 6.25 cm, which is apparently what is inside the screen of my laptop. Furthermore, I've read that apparently higher gain is not necessarily better because the beam is more focused meaning that it tends to multipath. Thanks very much for the replies!

Wifi, being in open airspace and uncontrolled can never mean that you use antenna X and card Y will assure you that it work better than antenna Y and card Z. This concept is the hardest one to get across. However there are new problems in the wifi world. Just recently I ran into that new aircrack tool in my neighborhood. My neighbors formerly good setup had tanked. No range and spotty connects. I got lucky in that the attack was on my wifi system first and afterwards I wrote about it and the fix in our security forum. Now you know the wavelength you also know that moving just a few centimeters in any direction can help since there are weak or dead spots in many systems. Sure, what hardware you note could help but anyone that tells you that it will always work better hasn't been out very long. The surefire fix I've found is to move a few feet closer to the base station. Bob
