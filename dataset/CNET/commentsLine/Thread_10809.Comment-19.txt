... but you get what you pay for.
sound quality isn't great but voices are perfectly understandable.
i connected mine and it immediately trashed my sound drivers.
i uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers with the magic jack dongle connected to my pc and haven't had a problem since.
aside from that hassle, no complaints here.
