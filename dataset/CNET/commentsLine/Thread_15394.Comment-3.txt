they gave you the system with the cpus already present suggests they didn't have much luck with it either.
i suppose the cpus themseleves are already buggered and may well be toast or at least one of them.
overall, if possible does that mtrbd.
work with one cpu installed alone?
if so, test that way.
otherwise, verify correct amount of cpu grease and further that is clean before install if older thermal paste was used.
thena pply new grease, otherwise amds aren't very overtemp tolerant.
remove cpus just to check the socket-a's placement, is glased or browned it shows alot of temp was active, not a good sign.
this excludes any other possiible cause mtrbd.
or elsewhere.
play with it is basically the best t/s i can give, but if the cpus are socket-a type are they transferable to another single socket-a mtrbd.
if so, then try that.
the cpu p/n# is present on the top surface or the die or bottom.
