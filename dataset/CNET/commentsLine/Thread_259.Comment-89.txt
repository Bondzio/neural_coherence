if i don't get these stories written by thursday -- and we have a holiday mid-week -- i'll have very little need for a computer, except to play games.
btw, i think it's odd that i can use the cd/dvd drives to run the cds necessary to play games.
i also can either drag-&-drop or copy fotos onto a cd-r in the second drive, while the first tells me to put a disc in the drive.
i guess it is one of those things that makes windows go bump in the night.
i use eudora pro as my e-mail client.
apparently qualcomm is no longer the owner of ep, so i wrote asking them what to do and how to get a copy onto a new drive since i never bought a cd copy.
i got a complicated answer, so i'm going to have to stand on my head -- figuratively speaking -- to accomplish that.
all of that -- and more i'm sure -- will take longer than it would normally.
i've never been good at working with partitions.
that's going to require some thought on my part, so all in all, i'd do well to think on all of this for a week before plunging into the job.
thanks again, ann
