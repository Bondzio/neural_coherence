1.1.1	First let me say that I am new to Wi-Fi - here is my issue.	St
1.1.2	I have successfully intalled the driver and card and actually had a secure connection to my network.	St
1.1.3	however after updating to SP2 for XP I have been unable to gain access to my network.	St
1.1.4	I have tried the 'Hotfix&quot; issue as well as reinstall the product, manually configure and several frimware updates and have gotten nowhere.	St
1.1.5	I had not problems on initial install - only after SP2 - any help in getting around this - also will I find this to be the case with all WiFi cards and SP2???	St
1.1.6	I guess that I should say my issue is that it cannot find IP address - then if I manually configure it will find it but will not allow the connection.	St
1.1.7	Any hell?	St
1.1.8	?	Ques
1.2.1	for a test.	St
1.2.2	In addition you may want to uninstall SP2 and note the effect that has.	St
1.2.3	A spyware ladened machine will also have this effect after an SP2 upgrade.	St
1.3.1	that is posing the issue - I have actually messed around with it some more - I am writing this from my den - wireless.	St
1.3.2	however I am having to go through a strange set up to get connected.	St
1.3.3	When I turn the laptop back on I have problem getting the driver to &quot;initiate&quot; so if I turn on the windows utility it sends me to the netgear utility - which then works???	St
1.3.4	wierd	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	After trying several configs and reinstalls I finally got one of the newer driver updates to work - not sure why this one did not work the first time I tried it though...Thanks for the help	St
1.6.1	apparently the software writers have yet to keep up with all of MS's service packs.	St
