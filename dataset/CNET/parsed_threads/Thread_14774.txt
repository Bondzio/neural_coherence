<s> Do you guys know of any hot swap capable external hard drives. </s>
<s> I have multiple hard drives and it's troublesome to for me to turn on and off the computer just to exchange drives. </s>
<s> I'm not sure how much you are planning to spend, but there are plenty of small external hard drive enclosures which offer hot-swap capability from companies like Seagate, Drobo, Thecus, NetGear, etc. </s>
<s> The easiest thing will be to purchase two (or more) equal sized/type drives for the new enclosure and copy your existing data to them. </s>
<s> Good Luck! </s>
