I've used my wife's Mac laptop on vacation to watch DVDs on the hotel's TV.
I didn't need the Canopus.
I simply bought a cable that plugged into the Mac's Video-out plug and had RCA and S-Video cables on the other side.
Audio needs a similar converter cable: Mini-plug split into RCA audio plugs.
Some laptops have DVI-out, and you can buy a DVI adapter cable to get video into RCA plugs, etc.
