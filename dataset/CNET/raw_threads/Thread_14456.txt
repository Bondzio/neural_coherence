Both of the networks will be wired and must be on 24/7. the computer has (or will have) two wired network interface cards. One is an onboard card and the other is a pci card. The operating system is XP Professional. I am &quot;somewhat&quot; familiar with networking. thanks

That is you can split the internet addresses in 2 and send requests one way for some and the other set of IP down the other. Most people want to bond the channels but that's not part of this OS. Bob

How serious are you about this? Are you going to get another machine, learn Linux or pay up for the expertise to make it happen or the boxes that will do this? Bob

I know very basic concepts and am not a real IT person. I don't have the option of buying another machine, or learning linux. The one computer MUST operate on both networks simultaneously. The application this is used for is very &quot;restrictive&quot; in nature and must be secure, and must run with XP Pro. I do not currently have a machine to &quot;play with&quot; that has dual network adapters, however, I need to figure out how to make this happen. Any help would be appreciated, but consider that I am most likely a novice (at best) when dealing with networking

Since another PC is out of the question I take it that you are not serious about this. Let's try a simple approach. Look at http://www.netswitcher.com This will allow you to switch which network to use at boot time. Bob

Simply connect it up, and windows will automatically recognise the two networks. It'll access the internet through whichever network allows, or you can even go into network settings and disable access of the internet through one or another network.

By default windows will only use a single connection. If you work at it you can make it use one connection to download from say utube and the other to download from say netflicks but you cannot combine them to get greater speed. There are companies will try to sell you services to do this but it in general is not worth the costs compared to buying a larger connection from a ISP.
