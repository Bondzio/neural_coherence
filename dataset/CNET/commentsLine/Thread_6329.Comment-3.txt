hi sunwatcher and thank you for your reply.
after a week or so struggling with the issue i've found that the problem was the phone line we were connecting to was voice only.
basic mistake i know but we live and learn.
it seems we can run an extension from a data line which will solve the issue.
again thanks for taking time to reply.
