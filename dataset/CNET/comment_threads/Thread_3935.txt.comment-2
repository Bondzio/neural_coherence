I own a few EyeFi cards and I have a few tablets but not the Nook HD.
Just an older Nook.
My nook color as well as the nook hd have a microsd slot.
So you can check out http://bookclubs.barnesandnoble.com/t5/NOOK-Color-General-Discussion/Wireless-pix-fr-camera-to-NC-Eye-Fi/td-p/1345782 It appears you can see the pictures of standard JPEG.
Sorry but I don't have the Nook HD so I can't do more here.

If support is that bad they can't answer your questions, why are you considering their product?
