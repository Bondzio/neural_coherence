1.1.1	I have been looking into new computers because mine died .	St
1.1.2	I was considering getting a intel quad core computer then some one asked if I really needed that much power when most programs barely use more than a single core let alone a dual core .	St
1.1.3	So I was thinking I should just go with a dual core chip with the best graphics card I can get .	St
1.1.4	The things is I have been doing a lot of reading and I wanted to find out which of the dual cores are the best for intel and for amd .	St
1.1.5	Then from those chips which is considered the fastest and best for games movies and music .	St
1.1.6	as a side note anyone have and good recommendation for a great website to build a computer to compare to dell and such .	St
1.1.7	thanks as always .	Polite
1.1.8	b	St
1.2.1	As to why I 'm going to skip that and point to tomshardware.com as he 's all over it .	St
1.3.1	check out ibuypower.com if you know what you want in a computer and do n't want to overpay , if you not sure you 'll end up paying HP $ 600+ for 8GB DDR2-800MHz dual channel SDRAM ( 4x2048 ) when you can get better quality ram from newegg for less then $ 300 ( http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16820227270 ) not that you 'd need that much , thats just proving a point .	St
1.3.2	Do research on your parts and know how much they are worth before buying from one of the big companies .	St
1.3.3	Or just build it yourself , its usually the best option .	St
1.3.4	AMD 's fastest dual core is the Athlon X2 6400+ Intel 's is the Core 2 Duo E6850 or the E8400 ( 65nm and 45nm )	St
