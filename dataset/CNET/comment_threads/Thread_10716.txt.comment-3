I just asked my mother if she used the software she asked me what software.
So she never used it.
I just went to help her because the keyboard was not working but the mouse was.
I assumed she used it because the mouse was working and it is not a brand new computer, so I knew she needed it, but apprently she didn't.
She told me she just did what the instructions told her to do and indeed she did because I just saw it.
No mention of the software, even though there is a disc..
It just states turn the computer off, plug the mouse in and turn it on.
Interesting so you are saying this is nothing new if I used the software.
Because they never even asked me if it was used..
