It has been replaced by Verizon 4 times and yes it works ok when wired. If I try to connect with my Iphone, Ipad or Book reader 1 in 10 times it connects, or randomly. I have changed settings and channels. I have turned off all security and it still doesn't connect. My question is there a modem/router that I can buy myself, say at staples that works well. Verizon tells me that none will work (will not connect to their DSL) I can't imagine that being true. Can anyone help me? Thanks

I would suspect you CAN run another DSL router but the DSL is not your issue it is the wireless so I would keep the DSL part since it works well on wired. So a couple suggestions you will have to dig though the manual to figure out how to do it. Run the westell device as a bridge and place a second wireless router behind it. Your second router will use ethernet and not DSL for its WAN. You in effect use the westell box as only a modem to convert the DSL to etherent. Use a second router as a WAP. You can disable the wireless signal on the westel and user it to do the DSL and the routing function. Your second router would only do the wireless part.
