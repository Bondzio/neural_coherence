Multiable cleanings would not improve quality of color so I removed it also and filled all the head wells with head cleaning fluid. [read this was very effective on episons] Now black or color will not print. Is this one of the Episons that has a chip to stop reuse of cartridges? jand

I think someone carted it off and they won't write a similar post. Nothing tells me that your printer actually works. On the downside I had to buy a full set of new ink to see if the printer had failed. Of course it had failed. So smarting from that failure I bought a new printer and am back in business. To remove part of the stinging feeling I lucked out and found another C80 owner and shipped him the full set of inks, then tossed out the old printer. You have to grapple with these printers since the costs are now so low that a full set of inks is close to what the new printer is... Bob

Printer worked when I got it except red ink had lines. Cleaning heads with head cleaning did not improve this. After using printer for a while the black ink indicator said to replace it. I refilled the black and it would not work after multiable cleanings. Decided to remove both and use head cleaner in wells. Then neither cartridge would work. That's why I wondered if this Epson was one that had the chips to prevent the use of cartiadges once they were removed. Trying to figure out if I need a chip or a printer. Sorry for the confusion. jand

Sadly, if cleaning doesn't clear that up (you have to try some dozen times, then you have to decide if its worth it for a new printhead. The &quot;chip&quot; on the inkcarts was visible on all the Epson models I've seen. It's a little green/blue circuit board. Refilling might be possible, but I never have. Bob
