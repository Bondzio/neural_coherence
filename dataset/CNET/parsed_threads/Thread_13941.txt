<s> I sent in rebate form and invoice for $500, they first denied receiving it, then they denied the invoice was included, and it was voided. </s>
<s> Their rebate vendor, and Alienware, are scammers. </s>
<s> I filed with the FTC and attorney general Florida. </s>
<s> DONT buy from ALIENWARE, THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF !!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Do you like your computer? </s>
<s> Thanks for the info AWS! </s>
<s> -JDM </s>
<s> Alienware makes an awesome gamers delight! </s>
<s> How could someone NOT like to have one? </s>
<s> haha </s>
<s> and i don't do server/professional, nor do I know where to obtain a decent MIPS ISA OS, nor do I care to find out I wouldn't like an Alienware, or any Botique computer for that matter also to Alienwaresucks...um, is it possible that it got lost in the mail? </s>
<s> Purchased 11/04, received 12/04. </s>
<s> Mailed Rebate form & original receipt via certified mail in Dec. </s>
<s> According to the rebate form &quot;please wait 12-24 weeks while we process your rebate&quot;. </s>
<s> Waited...no check. </s>
<s> Called and was told the rebate form was rec'd 1/3/05, but no &quot;receipt&quot; was enclosed. </s>
<s> I've read of several others with this same story. </s>
<s> We are considering a class action lawsuit (any lawyers interested?). </s>
<s> The system may be good, but when a company advertises a price *post* rebate, it really puts a bad taste in my mouth to have to turn on the PC every day and look at it every day knowing that Alienware has my $500 and the $500 of many others... </s>
