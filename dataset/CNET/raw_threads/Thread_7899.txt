One is my current mini-tower WinXP with PS/2 mouse & keyboard. The other is my work laptop which only has USB ports. I have been able to use a PS/2-to-USB adapter cable to use my PS/2 keyboard and mouse on the laptop. I purchased a 2-port PS/2 KVM switch, which unfortunatley doesn't have a physical button(s) switch mechanism, but relies on hotkey recognition. If I boot up the laptop first (the laptop is connected to the KVM via the PS/2-to-USB adapter cable), and then the mini-tower, I can use the laptop via the KVM. And I can switch over to the mini-tower via the 'hotkey'. If I boot up the mini-tower first, and then the laptop, I can use the mini-tower via the KVM, but I cannot switch over to the laptop. Nor can I switch from the laptop to the tower back to the laptop. It seems that once the KVM is on the mini-tower port (PS/2), it will not switch back to the laptop port (PS/2-to-USB). Anyone had this experience? Solutions?
