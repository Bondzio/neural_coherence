right now i am using seagate, previously i used maxtor and in one pc that is seven years old, my maxtor hard drive is still working perfectly.
maxtor hard drives became unreliable when they got a contract with dell to supply drives for dell pcs.
the quality of the drives got very bad because maxtor just couldn't keep up with demand.
maybe now that seagate bought out maxtor, maybe the quality will return to what it had been before the dell deal.
