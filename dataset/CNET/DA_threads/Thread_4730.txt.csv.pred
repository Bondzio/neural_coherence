1.1.1	Before I pay for a disk recovery service, I was wondering if anyone has had problems with XP and the 1394 Fire wire Maxtor 80 gb external hard drive.	St
1.1.2	I use this drive to store music and pictures.	St
1.1.3	I was in the process of backing this up to a different Maxtor One Touch 250GB hard drive when I received an error and my computer froze.	St
1.1.4	After rebooting, unplugging the firewire cables, I was no longer able to see the 80gb drive.	St
1.1.5	Unfortunately, only half of my 75GB worth of data was saved on my 250GB drive.	St
1.1.6	Anyone help!!	St
1.1.7	Also, can you removed the hard drive from the external case and plug it into a IDE controller internally and make it a slave drive?	St
1.1.8	THANK YOU ALL!	St
1.1.9	!	St
1.2.1	You'll find some reports of such.	St
1.2.2	I know this may be too late, but can I ask where the BACKUP was for this system?	St
1.2.3	Hard disks of the consumer variety are designed to last 5 years.	St
1.2.4	And some won't make it that long.	St
1.2.5	We must save what we can't lost on our BACKUP media.	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Bob, Thanks for your help.	St
1.3.2	I had no problems removing the hard drive from the case and hooking it up to the IDE channel internally.	St
1.3.3	When I booted my PC, I was able to see the drive, but WXP said that the drive needed to be formatted and I could not browse the drive.	St
1.3.4	Any suggestions?	St
1.3.5	I read somewhere about trying the Knoppix CD?	St
1.3.6	Thanks again for your help!	St
1.4.1	It supports a wider variety of disk formats.	St
