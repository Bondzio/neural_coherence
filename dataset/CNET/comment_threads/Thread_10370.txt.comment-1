I have a old pentium 4 computer custom built back in 2001.
Foll are the details: Pentium 4 CPU 1400 Mhz 256 MB RDRAM NVIDIA GEForce2 32MB While I am not a computer guy, I am comfortable swapping out parts to make it faster(Coming to think of it...I think I did swap out the orig graphics card sometime in 2005 or so).
Question is if it is worthwhile to make it last another 2-3 years by swapping out new components or should I just get a new computer.
Specifically: - What is the fastest CPU I can upgrade to using the same Board.
(The one inside is a Willamette 0.18um technology acc to Speccy) - What type of memory can i use.
I saw a post here saying DDR RAM(whcih seem to have won out the battle) is not compatible with RDRAM.
CAn I swap out all the RD RAMs to some other platform without changing the board...
Sorry for the long winded query but appreciate any expert advice.
Happy Holidays to all.
