Hiya Guys I am Dan anyway i have a new hard disk that i got about 3 to 4 weeks ago it is a &quot;imation sohot expert 2.5&quot; 320gb which i got from HK.
When i 1st used it, it worked perfectly fine but then my computer had computer problems (ISQL no more or equal) so i had to reformat it so i put all my stuff on to this hard disk for back up (mistake) and i have also pluged it into other computers to add stuff onto it aswell and it worked However after i reformated i pluged my hard disk in and it did not work, so i thought it was just because i didn't have usb 2.0 installed or something but since then my hard disk hasn't worked at all it doesn't work on any computers, there is still a light on my HD so its not dead i just think there is something i need to do....
I have tried going onto Disk management its not there i have looked in BIOS to see if it is connected and i cant find anything It doesnt show on device manager I downloaded programs to detect any extra HD but it doesnt I cannot find any drivers to install for it and i cannot take it back to the shop because i am in england PLEASE HELP i have important documents on there for my uni Thanks for your time guys
