1.1.1	I use my Linksys Wireless B USB network adapter ver 4 to get my Internet connection .	St
1.1.2	I have it outside attached to our rain gutter with some bread ties & a magnet .	St
1.1.3	I have it so Macgyvered that I have a copper wire attached to the antenna part of the Network adapter .	St
1.1.4	I found the copper wire & the rain gutters actually increase the signal strength .	St
1.1.5	Ive also found that moving the network adapter even a quarter of an inch can make a difference in my signal strength too .	St
1.1.6	Im wondering if theres anything else I can do to improve my signal strength even more ?	Ques
1.1.7	Or if anyone has some good ideas about homemade wifi antennas ?	Ques
1.1.8	Please & Thank You !	St
1.2.1	Where is the router or AP that you put the adapter outside of your house ?	Ques
1.2.2	While it 's possible that you might get some signal reflection from metal objects such as gutters , they can also interfere with a signal .	St
1.2.3	Antenna length is based on math and depends on the wavelength of the signal you 're trying to pick up .	St
1.2.4	As such , adding more wire to make the antenna longer wo n't always increase the signal .	St
