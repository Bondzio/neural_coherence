i curently have a 120gb hdd with a 2mb cache and runs at 7200 rpm.
will there be a significant increase in performance( meaning i'll be actually be able to tell )by getting a newer one with a 16mb cache also running at 7200 rpm?
also will getting a larger one make a difference?
in other words is there any performance benefits in having a 250gb hdd vs 120gb one assuming both are exactly the same otherwise?
i really don't need more storage since i barley use 1/4 of the current 120gb, but if getting a 250gb will mean better performance then i'll spend the extra $$$.
