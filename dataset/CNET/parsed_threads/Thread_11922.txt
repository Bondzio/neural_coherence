<s> Howdie all. </s>
<s> I have a &quot;very&quot; old GW2K Solo 9300 VE laptop that I had upgraded my old 12gb hdd to a 40gb hdd a number of years ago. </s>
<s> While I'd love to buy a newer laptop, budgets are such now that it'll have to wait. </s>
<s> I can however get a larger hard drive, and have been reviewing the larger, and newer hard drives. </s>
<s> And yes-- I can hear your peanut gallery comments already, so just please stick with my question. </s>
<s> What is the difference in the connection interface between the old UltraDMA-ATA 100, and the new SATA connections? </s>
<s> I must be using the wrong search criteria because I can't find side by side comparison descriptions. </s>
<s> So, if you know of any websites that show the differences, those would work. </s>
<s> Thank you for your responses. </s>

<s> In laptops you can't swap between those so let's look at a list of what should work (given no OS and more.) </s>
<s> Since it's an older laptop I'd stick to drives under 127GB. </s>
<s> http://www.geeks.com/products_sc.asp?cat=414 shows a few 80GB drives for 60 and under. </s>

<s> The older IDE/ATA drives have a double row of twenty pins which includes power. </s>
<s> SATA has a small connector and another separate power connector. </s>
<s> The two drives are not interchangeable. </s>
<s> to go on without falling back to peanuts gallery with this computer: http://support.gateway.com/s/Mobile/Solo_Series/P9300VE/p9300VEnv.shtml http://support.gateway.com/s/Mobile/Solo_Series/P9300VE/p9300VE02.shtml It's unwise to spend anymore on it without the upgrade part having a future. </s>
<s> Why not buy an external USB drive to accommodate your growing storage? </s>
<s> ...and make sure you follow all the sage advise about backups. </s>
<s> Thank you all for your replies. </s>
<s> This info was very helpful. </s>
