1.2.1	- The Internet speed is mostly determined by the connection with your ISP.	St
1.2.2	Not a very relevant factor.	St
1.2.3	- Lookup the system requirements for the games you want to play and use that as selection criterium.	St
1.2.4	- Then find a local PC shop and see what they have to offer.	St
