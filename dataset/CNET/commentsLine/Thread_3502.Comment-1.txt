hi.
i have a fujitsu n3510.
it currently has an x300 64 mb.
i wasnt satisfied with the videocard and i was wondering if there was any way to swap them out.
i know there is a way but i cant seem to find a site that sells video cards for notebooks.
i would gladly listen to suggestions of what kind of video card i should buy etc etc...
