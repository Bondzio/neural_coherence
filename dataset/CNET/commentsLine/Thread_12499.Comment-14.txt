every one of my apple computers have lasted until i replaced them due to being outdated sufficiently to warrant a replacement.
they never had a hardware fault other than my first which had an immediate calved hard drive.
failing power supplies mean cheapo components.
there is nothing inherent about a power supply that should say...good for three years.
using undersized or poorly designed power capacitors is usually the issue here.
there is a secret to the chemical coatings used in caps that some manufacturers did not know about after the electrolytic coatings formulae required were &quot;obtained&quot; from the inventors and patent holders but i understand that it was not the correct formula and so thousands of premature failures were the result of this.
corporate espionage sometimes results in the perfect pay off...unfortunately that means that many people end with with junk pcs.
buy a name brand and this is unlikely or they will repair it if it is their fault.
this is of course internet rumour but it seems to be the case.
if your computer is a reputable brand, it ought to last ten years.
all of mine have but they are so out of date by five years, it is likely time to upgrade due to slow response with modern software written for faster machines and graphics cards.
the power supplies in name brand computers are built to deliver double their rated use.
cheap computers give you just enough so that in time the overheating of the components result in premature failure that might very well take out the motherboard.
buy the best..it is cheaper in the end.
the best by the way is an apple mac pro but i know on this site i am talking to a different crew.
in case you are unaware of this the mac machines, one and all can run windows vista perfectly but you will have to buy a copy to do this.
it is a no brainer to install it and then you will have bmw quality hardware for a change.
