I suggest you reseat the HD cables several times and check results.
Try another HD cable(new?).
Try with only one HD installed, the other disconnected entirely but not removed.
make sure jumper reflect what that brand should be for solo HD.
If you had this system for sometime, maybe the bios(CMOS) battery is weak, replace.
