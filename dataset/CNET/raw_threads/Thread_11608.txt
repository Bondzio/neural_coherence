They include half of my wedding pictures, scanned as a tiff file. I wonder what experts suggest as a best method of backing up these pictures. At this moment, I am planning to backup on TDK Scratchproof DVD+R and on DV tapes (I don't know how I can backup on DV tapes but I have heard that it is possible) Any other wise method or this is enough? Thanks

Thanks for the reply but my issue is with the media, no matter which program you use, its very essential that your media survives that lifetime, else alls in vain. I am pretty much baffled with the media. Scratchproof DVDs have been working great so far at my working place but we never back it up on the tapes so I am looking for some method to backup on the DV tapes. I guess they would last longer than DVDs if stored well.
