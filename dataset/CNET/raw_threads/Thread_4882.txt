Staples, OfficeMax, etc., have their own. Sometimes there are special sales on name brand items. I prefer to wait and stock up then. Now, a lower cartridge cost does not guarantee that you will get as many usable pages of print.

There are &quot;work-arounds&quot; available to re-use the same, refilled cartridges again, but they are cumbersome. Did dozends of refills on a couple of black cartridges, but the print-head finally clogged and could not be &quot;cleared&quot; (maybe as claimed by Epson, because of using &quot;off-brand&quot; inks). Because of high cost of a &quot;shop-repair&quot; / cleaning of the heads I decided to look around for alternates. Found a Canon &quot;remanufactured&quot; printer for $ 50, bought it, since the cartridges in it were worth the cost! Also &quot;lucked out&quot; on several features that came with the printer: each color has its own cartidge (my earlier Epson had 3 colors combined in one cartrige, making replacment necessary each time only one of the colors ran out!!! --- except when doing refilling). The Canon does not use the chip on the cartridges, allowing hazzle-free refilling. The cartridges are only half &quot;sponge&quot; and half liquid-reservoir (while most others are completely filled with &quot;sponge&quot;), thus they are running longer, before replacement / refilling is necessary. Finally, the printer has a &quot;user-replaceable&quot; print-head assembly, which is available as &quot;re-built&quot; via the Internet, allowing home-replacement in case of failure, rather than shop-repair, that would have been needed with the Epson, with its &quot;built-in&quot; print-heads. All these features make Canon printers using the &quot;BCI-3e&quot; cartridges and replaceable print-head assemblies a very interesting and cost-efficient printer.
