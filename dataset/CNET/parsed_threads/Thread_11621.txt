<s> Hi, I am considering buying the Gateway ZX 6810 all-in-one pc. </s>
<s> Would someone be able to advise me if all-in-ones in general or this Gateway in particular be susceptible to overheating. </s>
<s> I intend to use it in India, where outside temperatures can get pretty hot in summers (going upto 45 Celcius). </s>
<s> In other words, is over-heating a serious problem with all-in-ones? </s>
<s> Thanks, </s>
<s> Such systems tend to be build that handle any heat build-up be exhausted or radiated away. </s>
<s> The makers knows it maybe a problem and thus allow for better static cooling. </s>
<s> However, if the environment itself is a threat then consider a system where you can improve on cooling as the all-in-ones aren't that capable of a any cooling upgrades other than external. </s>
<s> So, if you buy one, best to use it in A/C cooled room and/or where cooling is in a comfort zone for the PC. </s>
<s> This is akk an opinion, as I see it. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I'd be concerned about running any PC in an ambient temperature that high so you're probably right to be concerned. </s>
<s> You might want to see if you can find specs for operating temperature (non-condensing) and keep well within that range. </s>
