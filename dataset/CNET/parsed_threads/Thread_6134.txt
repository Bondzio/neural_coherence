<s> I have checked with the Epson website and managed to get the printer working but they do not have a scanner/photocopier driver for Windows 7. </s>
<s> Is there any way I can get these functions to work on this printer? </s>
<s> I am using an Acer 5635Z 64bit laptop. </s>
<s> epson.com wrote &quot;Download and install the Windows Vista version of Epson Scan from the Epson website.&quot; for the scanner in Windows 7. </s>
<s> Did you try that? </s>
<s> http://www.hamrick.com/vuescan/epson_stylus_cx3650.html claims their scanner software works but do drop them a line. </s>

<s> No Epson's suggestion using the one for Vista won't install. </s>
<s> VueScan seems very impressive but the free test one has dollar signs over the result. </s>
<s> The usable one costs $39. </s>
<s> Question..is it worth spending this on an old printer or do I buy a new one? </s>
<s> Vuescan used to offer a demo mode so you could test it. </s>
<s> Ask them for that or just try it. </s>
<s> I can't tell if you feel if this scanner is worth it. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob, It is the demo where you finish up with dollar watermarks over the result. </s>
<s> No I know you can't make up my mind for me. </s>
<s> It was a kinda rhetorical question. </s>
<s> At least you can give it a test before you decide. </s>
<s> Can I share an observation here? </s>
<s> A few get upset over the lack of drivers as the years roll by. </s>
<s> While I can explain why this is so what I want to write is this -&gt; Many get so upset they write &quot;I'll never buy from them again.&quot; Here's my observation. </s>
<s> This issue is not limited to just a few makers. </s>
<s> I've seen this happen with every product over the years from each maker. </s>
<s> HOWEVER I have had good luck with Windows 7 XP MODE where I use an old outdated no driver will ever be found USB MICROSCOPE. </s>
<s> This device has been very nice to capture pictures of stuff I need to document. </s>
<s> It would be a shame to work that hard and for some there is that cost to upgrade to Windows 7 Pro or higher so Vuescan is likely the cheap exit unless there is a new all in one that is cheaper than vuescan. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> But I am not eligible to download Windows XP Mode with Windows 7 home premium. </s>
<s> VueScan seems very good but I must weigh this against the cost of a brand new printer/scanner for about 50. </s>
<s> You are right about about the compatibility cost of Windows 7. </s>
<s> I lost Adobe Photoshop, Corel Draw, VideoCam Look, Greeting Card Magic and Canon Zoom Browser does not link to Pictures. </s>
<s> All these were working well on XP so I seem to be paying the price of getting up to date. </s>
<s> The cost of that is to upgrade to 7 Pro. </s>
<s> Then you gain access to XP Mode and those old softwares can run in XP Mode. </s>
<s> Maybe that would be worth it? </s>
<s> It takes a little learning to master it but I find it to be a great solution. </s>
