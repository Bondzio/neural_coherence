I have had the 7N400 PRO2 for several months, running fine.
Used @BIOS utility to update the BIOS this past Friday and now have the same problem you describe.
So much for the Dual BIOS feature.
I tried the CMOS reset and that is about it.
I have an email in to tech support at Gigabyte.
Never needed to ask them a question before so I am not sure how fast they are to respond.
