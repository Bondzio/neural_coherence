recently my laptop stopped charging.
i believe it has to do with the dc jack having s bad connection since before it completely stopped working it would get really hot.
i've opened the back panel of my laptop and can see that the dc jack wiggles a little in its socket.
do you guys think resoldering it to the motherboard would fix the issue?
