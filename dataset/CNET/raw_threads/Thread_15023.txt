An Athlon FX(X2) or an Intel Core Duo? I am definitely not going with Vista for at least a year or so after it's release, I know what the hardware requirements are now for Vista and was just curious. All opinions are respected and appreciated. Rocco

If I was going to go with a 4400+, but since the AM2 versions are no longer being made/sold, I'm stuck going cheaper since I capped my own price. Anyway, enough about me. I agree with the other guy. If you can wait a good 3-4 months, I'd build a Core 2 Duo/Core 2 Extreme-based system. It will be expensive, but as of right now, the most expensive chip will still be cheaper then the afforementioned FX-62 by around $300. It will also destroy the FX-62. Of course, if you're like me and you want to build something immediately, go with an AMD processor of your choosing, whether it be FX or X2. And I'd also go with an AM2 socket processor, just so you can upgrade down the line if you need to. DDR2 667mhz memory runs about the same speed as DDR 400mhz, so there's plenty of good memory if you need it for cheap. Just make sure you have a graphics card capable of jumping through hoops if you're wanting all the fancy effects of Vista.

Right now, it's the X2. As for the video card, the minimum requirements I found is a GeForce FX 5200, Radeon 9550, or Radeon X300.

I am not going to build one now or in the next month or so, but I was just curious about what cpu might be the best right now considering that Vista will be 64-bit and..the virtual ocean of cpu options. I am not a 'gamer' so I won't need a top of the line system, but I do have a level of performance that I expect from my pc. Right now I have an athlon64 3200 with 1gig of pc3200 ram and a 128mb agp 8x video card. I would like to experience the next level of performance in the next year or so being as my system is only about 1 year old now. Thanks much for the opinions and recommendations. Ciao, Rocco
