I was thinking about overclocking my Nvidia Geforce 5200, it has no &quot;Detect Optimal Frequinces&quot; on it so i will have to do it manuel. Does anyone no a safe limit to set the core clock and memory clock frequencies to? And is there anyway to check the temp of the GPU? Thx

Since you have a nvidia card, just google coolbits, a add-on to forceware, which lets you overclock your video card, and it also has a feature where it detects the maximum overclockability for your card, which offers you best performance and stability. Give it a try!
