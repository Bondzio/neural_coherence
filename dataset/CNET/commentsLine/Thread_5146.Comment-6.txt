&quot;i am curious why dvd media prices haven't really come down.
unless i'm missing something, they cost the same(pennies) to manufacture as cds.&quot; it would be if the volumes were the same as cd's, which they haven't quite matched yet.
in fact sam's club is dropping blank dvd's or so i was told when shopping locally for them.
even though the technology is similar for manufacturing, it is different enough that if the volume isn't there the price stays higher.
and of course there is &quot;what the market will bear&quot;.
