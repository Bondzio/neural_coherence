1.1.1	I'm running Win XP w/SP2, and originally had a 40GB hard drive on my HP desktop.	St
1.1.2	Seeing that I was beginning to run &quot;short&quot; of space, I added a Seagate 200GB HD.	St
1.1.3	The 40GB HD is the master, the 200GB the slave.	St
1.1.4	My PC definitely recognizes the additional HD.	St
1.1.5	But I've noticed that the 40GB HD continues to fill up, even though some of the 200GB has also collected some data.	St
1.1.6	How does this work?	St
1.1.7	Does the first hard drive fill up and then the second one takes the &quot;spillover&quot;?	St
1.1.8	Or is there a way to program my PC to send data only to the 200GB hard drive?	St
1.1.9	Will a full master HD slow down my PC?	St
1.1.10	Any help and opinions/solutions would be appreciated!	St
1.1.11	Thanks Al1	St
1.2.1	I advise many a client to move on to the new HD as solo.	St
1.2.2	It will be faster and less confusing to all pgms,., etc.	St
1.2.3	once the data has been xfered.	St
1.2.4	Leave the new HD in and take out the old one.	St
1.2.5	You just increased the HD capacity 5x, yet still hang on to it.	St
1.2.6	The new HD is no thought faster and carrys with it any new technology now present.	St
1.2.7	Having 2-HDs present will stress the power supply and create a &quot;hot zone&quot; bewteen them if so mounted.	St
1.2.8	Use CS selection instead of master/slave setup for the HDs is so continued, with proper 80-connector EIDE cable.	St
1.2.9	As to your orginal ?, a truly full HD causes the virtual HD, that windoze uses in order keep things in order, especially if low ram resources, will use whatever available free HD space to accomplish its task.	St
1.2.10	Google for virtual on windoze usage.	St
1.2.11	tada -----Willy	St
1.3.1	What is a CS setup?	St
1.3.2	How do I xfer what's on my old drive to the new drive?	Ques
1.3.3	Is there a website that gives instructions?	St
1.3.4	Do I sound so dumb as to just take it to a shop and let them do it?	St
1.3.5	Thanks!	St
1.4.1	put things on the second disk.	St
1.4.2	Programs usually default to C:Program Files, HOWEVER in virtually every case you can change the location to elswhere, while installing the app..	St
1.4.3	I create a Program Folder also on the second drive [partition whatever], and when the program wants to install to C, simply edit the line and change the C to a D [or whatever].	St
1.4.4	If offered, always choose &quot;custom install&quot; if offered, that will ALWAYS allow one to use another location.	St
1.4.5	For any app's that are presently on the C drive, you can change the default location/path of its data folders to a folder(s) on the D drive.	St
1.4.6	Make the folder on the D drive as the new default, and then move the old data to that folder also.	St
1.5.1	means cable select.	St
1.5.2	Most hard drives and CDROM etc use either master/slave or Cable Select.	St
1.5.3	Newer set up usually reuires Cable Select whereas many older systems required master/Slave.	St
1.5.4	I agree that your best bet is to put the OS on the new HD and get rid of the old, but that would require purchasing a new copy of XP.	St
1.5.5	I would keep all my data on the D drive and leave the OS and such on C.	St
1.6.1	It is up to the User to determine what happens, it is not automatic.	St
1.6.2	I have a similar setup as you.	St
1.6.3	40G for OS, 160G as storage drive for downloaded programs, image/video, etc.	St
1.6.4	I also don't leave a lot of crap on either harddrive, but that is another issue.	St
1.6.5	chuck	St
1.7.1	If you feel that uncomfortable, then allow some shop/techie to do this, provided you want that, its up to you.	St
1.7.2	CS = cable select an option instead of master/slave setup as what seems you're now as.	St
1.7.3	Under XP, check the file services options.	Sug
1.7.4	You can xfer the data that way since you're already linked on the same system.	St
1.7.5	Allow me to get back to you as I have a win98 in front me to give step-by-step info.. enjoy -----Willy	St
1.8.1	you own a legal liscense and are allowed to reformat with that liscense as many times as you feel like, after a certain point (it's 3 or 4 reformats) you have to call microsoft to ensure the key is only being used one time (you just have to talk to a phone tech support person and tell them it's being used one time) I would just suggest putting all of the new programs from now on, onto the 200GB drive it's much easier than removing the primary drive and reformatting (which takes hours and you lose everything)	St
1.9.1	OK, click on -&gt;start-&gt;programs-&gt;accessories-&gt;system tools-&gt;files and setting transfer wizard-&gt;next, follow prompts It will make sense once you start or review at MS knowledgebase on thier support website, find the topic, files&setting wizard, etc.	St
1.9.2	enjoy -----Willy	Polite
1.10.1	That sounds like a great plan.	Polite
1.10.2	Now if I just knew how to creat a new folder in D and set it as the default..... Ali	St
1.11.1	you DO NOT [can't] set it as a general default, except, here's a link to relocating the My Documents folders in XP http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;310147 I was speaking of locating the default save locations in Word, Excel, Access etc.	St
1.11.2	These can be located [relocated] within the program and set to defaults within the programs.	St
1.11.3	May have to use the help file in each application.	Ques
1.12.1	Reformat and set your 200GB to Master.	St
1.12.2	HP Harddrives are weaker than your new 200GB	St
1.13.1	Go to the Seagate website: http://www.seagate.com/support/disc/index.html Detailed and easy to follow instructions on installing, formatting, partitioning and transfering all the data (Your Windows operating system included)from your old 20GB hard drive to your new Seagate are there.	St
1.13.2	You will then be able to use your new, faster Seagate as your boot drive and your old drive for storage or backup, etc.	St
1.13.3	Good luck.	St
1.14.1	I probably should have gone to &quot;computer newbies&quot; for this.	St
1.14.2	But someone mentioned, whenever adding a new program or downloading something, just change the C to a D so the new stuff goes to D drive.	St
1.14.3	I've done that, and when the info actually starts downloading, the D flips back to C. What the???	St
1.14.4	Also, I did transfer my music files from C to D. And increased the amount of free space on my C drive by 9 GB.	St
1.14.5	BUT my music files are still there on C!	St
1.14.6	And they are also there on my D drive.	St
1.14.7	How can that be?	St
1.14.8	OK, please explain boot drive and storage.	Sug
1.14.9	D would then be the default drive?	St
1.15.1	How would I do that?	St
1.15.2	Wouldn't that require actually going into the case and changing the way the cables are run to/from each drive?	St
1.16.1	Did I say I am fairly inexperienced with hardware stuff?	St
1.16.2	Adding the HD is the only thing I've attempted.	St
1.16.3	So my question is: how do you transfer the data from the original drive to the new drive?	Ques
1.16.4	Thanks for your advice!	St
1.17.1	But I'm just curious.	St
1.17.2	I hear a lot of people talking about reformatting.	St
1.17.3	Just what is that?	St
1.18.1	NIL	St
1.19.1	Where did everybody go??	St
1.19.2	You probably saw the &quot;Thanks&quot; message and thought we were done!	St
1.19.3	But please read my previous post.	Sug
1.19.4	I do thank you ALL for putting up with my DUMB questions!	Polite
1.20.1	The short explanation is that reformatting is the process of completely wiping your hard drive clean of all data (including the operating system, file system, etc), and starting over as if nothing had ever been on it.	St
1.20.2	This process is used if you are trying to clean your hard drive before getting rid of it (although I prefer to physically destroy it for optimum security) or install a new OS.	St
1.20.3	(Going from Windows 95/98/ME to XP doesn't require this, but going backwards, or to an alternative OS, does.)	St
1.20.4	You can read more about reformatting in Wikipedia's article, found by clicking here .	St
1.20.5	Hope this helps, John	St
