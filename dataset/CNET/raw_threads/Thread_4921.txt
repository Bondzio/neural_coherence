I hav a P3(@550mhz) on intel se440bx-2 motherboard. Hav a 320mb(2*128+64) of ram, 32mb s3 savage4 pci grafix & 80gb hdd. I am running on Windows xp sp2 (with laters updates & hotfixes). Hav also latest directx(9.0c dec 06), flash, shokewave player, and lots more... including vista theme(crystalxp). Hav 2 problms trobling me... 1. When i try to zoom any picture in windows picture fax viewer My system crashes. I hav Zone alarm internet security suite, Avast antivirus and Spyware doctor running on my pc. The same thing is happening even wheni tried the same with all the unwanted services are stopped. But other viewers of that of nero and others dont the problem. What can i do to stop this problm of reaching to the &quot;Blue Screen of Deadth&quot; followed by a sudden restart of my pc? 2. I know i cant play high end games on my pc with a 550mhz cpu and 32mb of grafix so i used to play mid range games with the lowest settings(low resolution, low colour depdth, etc...). But some games sometimes while running(with no unwanted services running to use large part of my pc's memory) causes my display driver to stop or my system to crash or it hangs (just like dead and require manual restart to come alive again). What can I do to solve this? If somebody can help me pls mail me(Abilash-A) @ abilash_a_t@yahoo.co.in or downloadjuke@yahoo.com

But let's cut to the chase. &quot;including vista theme(crystalxp).&quot; One of the things you learn is to eject any pretty or shiny addons and get back to boring. Your tinkering and prettying up of the OS could have caused this. Bob

Hence...hardware..I would pull the Video card and use the Intergrated Video[Intel].. ..also if your useing a SP2 CD to upgrade your SP1..that might be another problem.. ..your PC sounds like its aged/ I would attempt to upgrade the RAM..and the HDD(NTFS)/ .. If you add up the price of upgrading your PC/ 1./New OS 2./RAM(more like 2 x 512MB's) 3./USB 2.0 .............................. You may find you really need to purchase a New Machine.. .. Also..the fax viewer in XP does contain a BUG/ it was FIXED about 4-years ago.. ..You also need to find the FIX at http://www.microsoft.com .. But I would just pull the Video card and go w/Integrated Graphics.. If your useing a PCI-expansion card for sound/??/pull that also..and use the Onboard Sound.. .. Instead of lowering your CRT-screen Resolution.. considering that you did PULL the Expansion cards.. you can Right-Click your Monitor PROPERTIES/in TROUBLESHOOTING-drop the hardware Accelleration-one NOTCH.. .. If none of that helps..you need a better PC.
