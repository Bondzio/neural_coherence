I am worried about compatibility, however, so I have come here to make sure my parts will work together. here is a list of the parts: AMD Phenom II X2 Processor Patriot Viper II Sector 5 4GB DDR3 1600 RAM Foxconn Cinema II Deluxe Socket AM3 Motherboard ASUS Black DVD Multi Drive Western Digital Caviar Green 500GB Hard Drive OCZ ModXStream Pro 500W PSU RAIDMAX Hurricane ATX Case Windows 7 Home Premium O/S Will my hardware support this, and is there a really good site on hardware compatibility and stuff? Oh, and will I have to do any adjustments in the BIOS for any of these? I've heard stories of with DDR2 1600 RAM people have to manually go into BIOS and tweak it, since the RAM is technically just &quot;pumped-up&quot; DDR2 800. I hope that there are drivers for Windows 7 64-bit, too... Thanks!

I'm actually thinking about scrapping the parts I've found (good thing I haven't ordered them yet) and ordering the parts for the AMD beginner computer. I've also found all the parts on NewEgg Canada, and I'm blown away with the price INCLUDING the monitor! Thanks so much for the recommendation! And whats your take on their use of the DDR3 1600? Should I go with something more like DDR3 1333 or even 1066 (or what ever the #s are)?
