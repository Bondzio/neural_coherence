Since I tend to create lots of graphic files (3d studio max, illustrator, photoshop, short animations), I generally create around 3-4 gigabytes of information every three months. I have been burning cd's each semester to store old files that I only occasionally need to access for portfolio purposes. I am now think about buying an external DVD burner as an alternative for storing those files. From my perspective, it seems like it would be faster and make the process of accessing old files simpler (1 for each semester, etc) Is this the best option? If so, do I need to get one that does -rw and +rw? If so, can soemone tell me why? Thanks Chris Becker

It does not pay to buy a bigger laptop drive, not at all.. They are way too expensive.... I went and bought an external hard drive case (USB) which cost me $30 ......... I then installed a 160g hard drive in it. You could get a USB hard drive but also are expensive and at least with my scenerio I could remove drive from the case and put in my regular computer if I wanted to...... It works fast and great.....
