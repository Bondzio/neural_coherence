<s> Hi, Can somebody help me please, I have a Toshiba PX1265SE-1G16 external hard drive, it has onspec regen in stalled on what I think is a virtual drive, the only problem is is that when I enter the password for the drive, it says that the drive is enabled but when I go to my computer, it is only showing up as a cd drive with only 19.7 mb. </s>
<s> the drive itself is 200gb. </s>
<s> I have loads of pictures and files on there which i do not want to loose. </s>
<s> can anybody help? </s>
<s> Is there a way of removing the virtual cd drive, thus allowing me access to my files? </s>
<s> I am running windows 7 on a Samsung NC10. </s>
<s> thank you. </s>
<s> It's their software and if they fail, then the next call is to http://www.drivesavers.com -&gt; All externals fail like this. </s>
<s> These are not &quot;storage&quot; but temporary copies which we must backup. </s>
<s> For those that don't backup because it costs too much, just wait till they see the data recovery bills. </s>

<s> I appreciate the advice, but I don't think it's a hardware issue, I just think that either the mbr or virtual drive has become corrupt. </s>
<s> I cannot delete anything as it will not give me access, It says it's a network drive. </s>
<s> any ideas???? </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>

<s> The problem is that this virtual drive is non-standard. </s>
<s> If you use some non-standard feature then you need to ask Toshiba how to recover. </s>
<s> AT THE TOP OF THIS FORUM ARE THE USUAL TITLES TO TRY but if you value your files I must stick to my original advice. </s>

<s> Managed to find a piece of software called CD to HDD converter. </s>
<s> It converts to a hdd again, but you will have to then use a file recovery software to get back your files because it formats (quick) you hdd. </s>
<s> My bet is they get that call too often and may have a fix that does not create the need for file recovery. </s>
<s> -&gt; But this is the lesson that these drives are not storage. </s>
<s> We must have a backup copy of what we can't lose. </s>
