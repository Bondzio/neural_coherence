hi bob, yeah we tried a different case and it didnt work, it looks like the pc wont boot with the second sata operational therefore i was suggesting putting it back into the case and using some more data recovery tools to get the data - are any other tools we havent used?
any other suggestions?
thanks a lot, ger.
