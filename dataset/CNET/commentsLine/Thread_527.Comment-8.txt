i have a alienware 51m 766 with a bad video card.
i called customer service and was told that they do not support my system anymore( it is less than 2 years old) they also gave me a few links to try and find a used card.
for a laptop that i spent over 3500 dollars for and that still is a 3.4ghz with a gig of ram, i think thats crazy.
i have also had issues with overheating and the laptop locking up on numerous occasions.
i cant believe how horrible this company actually is.
i found this link and i filled it out.
i hope this helps other people with the same problems that i have had.
