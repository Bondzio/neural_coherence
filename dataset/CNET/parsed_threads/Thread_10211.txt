<s> I'm about to buy a tablet and need some help deciding between these wide aspect choices: http://www.adesso.com/products_detail.asp?productid=347 (2000 dpi., Affordable) Not sure if it will work well with Sketchbook Pro... </s>
<s> Anyone know? </s>
<s> http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000RAHUOW?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&tag=dealtime-ce-feed-20&linkCode=asn (Only 1000dpi., This one is affordable also) http://www.entercomputers.com/_e/Graphics_Tablets/sproduct/1011139868/Penpower_Tooya_Pro_USB_Graphics_Tablet.htm (A little more than I want to spend. </s>
<s> 2000lpi.) </s>
<s> Wacom is too expensive for the size I want. </s>
<s> Looking to spend about $100(+,-). </s>
<s> I'm mostly unsure about how all of these will work with Sketchbook. </s>
<s> I think I like the Adesso but I'm just not sure yet. </s>
<s> Anyone have any other suggestions/advice? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> I would also go with the Adesso. </s>
<s> I can't find a single Adesso z12 product review. </s>
<s> It looks like a good one but I really wish I could read some reviews... </s>
<s> I did come across this tablet though: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823102010&nm_mc=OTC-C173T&cm_mmc=OTC-C173T-_-Input+Devices+-+Tablets-_-Genius-_-23102010 This one is a little cheaper and appears to have a lot of the same features as the Adesso. </s>
<s> What do you guys think? </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
