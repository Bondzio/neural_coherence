oops sorry, I use it for internet, home work, pay bills, and play games.
I like to play role play games on and off line.
It's a Dell, Dimension 4400, pent 4 processor 1.6 GHz, 16MB ATI Rage 4X AGP Graphics Card.
I bought it back in 2002.
I just upgrade my memory to 768 MB I don't want to spend to much money.
I''m looking to spend no more then $200.00 to $300.00 for an upgrade.
I would like to go less if I could.
