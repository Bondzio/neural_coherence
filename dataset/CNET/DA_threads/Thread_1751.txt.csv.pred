1.1.4	Thanks Windows XP Home edition version 2002 service pack 3 Dell Dimension DIM3000 intel (R) Pentium (R) 4 CPU 2.80CHz 2.79 GHz 1.99GB of RAM Used space 45.6 GB Free space 25.9 GB Capacity 71.5 GB	St
1.2.1	a fixed 2gb pagefile would be sufficient.	St
1.2.2	since you have 2gb of physical ram, increasing the pagefile will not affect the gameplay.	St
