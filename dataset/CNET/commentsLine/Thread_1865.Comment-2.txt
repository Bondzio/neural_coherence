pull the motherboard out of the case (yes it's a big pain but you should have done this before installing mb in case) put it on a piece of cardboard and try it with nothing but the psu, cpu, ram, video card, keyboard and monitor connected.
if you can't get it running at this config...then clear cmos and last check the cpu installation.
once it's running, then start connecting the various peripherals one at at time.
then retest.
once all the components are connected and the system's still running ...then put it all back in the case.
keep us posted.
