Thanks, but yes, I check the status every time I upgrade either OS or QT version.
I'd bet the problem lies with prefs (plists) but unless I know which one to delete I'm hesitant.
In fact: QT Pro will still export to different file formats from .mov - just converted one audio.mov file to .aif with no trouble.
But it won't do the two common operations I've described (and need).
I have worked around the immediate problem: bought iMovie 11 from the Mac App Store and will be trying its new audio editing features (which Apple dropped after iMovie HD).
