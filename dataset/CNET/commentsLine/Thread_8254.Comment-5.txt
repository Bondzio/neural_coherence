i managed to close the door.
when holding the c key (c letter not ctrl key ?
)nothing happens.
when holding down the alt key, i get 2 icons each with an arrow inside.
one straight arrow pointing to the right and the other curved like unclosed circle pointing also to the right.
and a cursor in the shape of a watch.
nothing happens when clicking either icons.
after a long while text appears where among other things it is written &#8243;type mac-boot and press return&#8221; but nothing happens when i do that.
any suggestions what i could do next?
thanks a lot
