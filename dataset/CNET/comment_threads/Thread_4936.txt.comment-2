If all you have are two PCs connected, it's likely just peer-to-peer and there is no network manager.
You will have administrative and possibly limited accounts on the individual computers and, perhaps, some sharing of folder and/or printers between the two.
If you set up your own computer, you likely used an administrator account.
But, you cannot access your roommate's PC without some additional configuration.
I can only imagine the McAfee message might be from trying to do a network scan rather than files/folders on your own PC.
