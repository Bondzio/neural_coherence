I know that, I opened it up and saw the AGP Slot for the card.
Problem is, it not written on the board what AGP Slot it is (well I looked and looked and see nothing on the board near the AGP Slot).
I couldn't find for sure anywhere what kind of slot it was for the D4362 on google (there seems to be little info about this model).
Also, the slot is brown, not green but it's made like the green one (visit the url I posted and you'll understand what I mean).
So I need to know if it's a 2x one or 8x one.
Thank you in advance.
