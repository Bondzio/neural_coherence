<s> Recently, I bought a few upgrades for my desktop. </s>
<s> After a few hours of troubleshooting, I still can't get the thing to boot up. </s>
<s> The only thing that I can think of at this point is that maybe the power supply isn't strong enough to handle everything. </s>
<s> Here is a list of the upgraded parts: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128514 http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&DEPA=0&Order=BESTMATCH&N=-1&isNodeId=1&Description=evga+geforce+560&x=0&y=0 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139023 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103727 Any help resolving the issue woul dbe greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Just a quick look tells me you need 200 Watts just for the card so let's try the usual 500 Watt SINGLE RAIL PSU. </s>
<s> Got that? </s>

<s> What RAM are you using ? </s>
<s> Power Supply: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139023 It runs 600 watts, so I thought that it should do the job. </s>
<s> Ram: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820226189 Unless I overlooked something, the ram and motherboard are both DDR3. </s>
<s> I apparently forgot this in my original post as well: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835181016 This is where the overwattage issue might come from, assuming that is the issue at all. </s>
<s> Unless you do something like add 20 hard drives or dual video cards. </s>
<s> At this point let's repeat an old issue. </s>
<s> Did you remove the extra mounting posts when you changed boards? </s>
<s> And then we need to define &quot;boot up&quot;. </s>
<s> Some folk think they can change all this and boot Windows from the old HDD. </s>
<s> -&gt; No. </s>
<s> &lt;- Bob </s>
<s> The pins that put airspace between the board and the case/hold the board in place? </s>
<s> I believe I have 4-6 placed around for support. </s>
<s> My issue is that the computer itself turns on, but my screen does absolutely nothing. </s>
<s> I'm fairly confident that I have all the connectors where they need to be. </s>
<s> ( I even double checked and reassembled by following the manual verbatum.) </s>
<s> Is when folk change the motherboard, they left one that is now touching something on the backside. </s>
<s> There's more to bringing up a new system than I can fit here. </s>
<s> And sometimes you cry as you find folk that &quot;followed the manual&quot; only to discover the manual had an error. </s>
<s> Example? </s>
<s> Sure. </s>
<s> One board I ran into had a typographic error and had swapped the HD LED and the RESET connection. </s>
<s> About half the units would not boot as the LED on the RESET pins held the board in reset. </s>
<s> The board screen printing was correct and one client insisted the manual was right. </s>
<s> Go figure. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I didn't think to check if all the mounting posts were actually under the holes on the board, though I want to say they are. </s>
<s> It will definitely be something worth double checking. </s>
<s> Hopefully there is something there that is causing the issue, as I am fairly frustrated at this point. </s>
<s> I will hope that the manual is right, because it could be fairly nightmarish trying to refit all those little pins over and over until it works. </s>
<s> (I'm not overly tech-savvy, but get the gist of where things are supposed to be.) </s>
<s> When I'm looking at such a system I take a quick peek under the main board. </s>
<s> Since I can't blow up hardware that isn't mine we always pull the main board to be sure there is not that common issue. </s>
<s> If you are absolutely sure about the pin connections, UNPLUG the HDD LED and RESET cables from same connections. </s>
<s> Also, be sure the little paper insulator is removed from the CMOS battery holder plus see if the CMOS CLEAR jumper is on/off or &quot;proper&quot; for normal operation. </s>
<s> Still dead. </s>
<s> Pull the motherboard out of the case and build the bare minimum parts on cardboard. </s>
<s> If it doesn't beep or light up, you are looking at the bad part or parts. </s>
