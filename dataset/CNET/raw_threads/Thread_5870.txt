Hello, I am looking to buy a new desktop and I was wondering if I should buy a Area-51 7500 or Dell 710 H2C. I am an extreme gamer and is looking for performance, so if any one could tell me which one I should get and why please tell me because I am on the fence with this because I like the fact the the Dell is over clocked, but the alienware has a newer motherboard and faster ram and I don't know which one to chose.thx

Its brilliant and not too expensive for custom built computers. http://www.cyberpowerpc.com/Default.asp http://www.ibuypower.com/mall/lobby.htm
