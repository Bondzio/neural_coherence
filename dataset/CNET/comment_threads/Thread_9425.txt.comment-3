I see no reason why you shouldn't download Hotspot Shield.
I'm running Mac OS X and so far everything is fine.
So what if they are building a database?
There is no requirement to provide an email address when you download anyway, so what's the problem?
For a free application that will keep my wireless communication secure, it's working just great and I am pleased as punch to have found it.
As for some people commenting about the ads that are displayed, switch to Firefox and install Adblock Plus.
It strips out ALL adds from web pages and the only images visible are the Anchor Free logo and its accompanying Rewards Bar graphic.
For a free application, Hotspot shield is great.
I give it two secure, encrypted thumbs up.
