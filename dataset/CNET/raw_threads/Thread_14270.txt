I recently moved from my apartment to a house and moved my computers+speakers along with it. Now the speakers won't work. I have made sure that the speakers are connected in the right jack (In fact I tried'em all and test the audio, but no output). The driver is updated. I went to the My device manager, uninstalled/installed the driver, disabled/enabled the driver, restarted the computer, the speakers are ON, connected to the power supply and the jack. See the link for the device settings. Have tried everything from my end. http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/2038/speaker1q.jpg

And, of course you're using the green jacks and have tried both front and back. I don't see your imageshack pictures well but I do see a digital option. You'll want to make sure that you're not outputting the wrong signal. Anyway, try to test the speakers by connecting some digital music player if you have one and see if that works.
