However, I have heard that you can replace the existing PSU (Power Supply Unit) with a third-party one (such as a Thermaltake, Antec, etc). However, I have also heard that such PSU's are not compatible with the Dell motherboard. Which of these are true? I don't want to ruin my system - thanks. btw, I have a Dell XPS 410

The key is &quot;Dell&quot; because some of their parts are proprietary from what I heard. Okay, so just to clarify, you have a Dell?
