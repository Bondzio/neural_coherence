As to which video card, for the past few years I still like this list updated almost every month. Read and pick from http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-geforce-price,2323.html Toms did motherboard comparisons a few times and found less than 2 percent variation in benchmarks when using same settings for RAM, same GPU, etc. Go with the board that people review nicely (see newegg.com comments.)
