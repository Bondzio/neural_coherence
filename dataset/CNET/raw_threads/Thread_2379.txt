I've been using a 2Wire HPNA adapter for internet connection through my landlord's DSL router/ connection. I'm running Windows XP Home SP 2 on an HP Pavilion desktop. Everything has been fine since setting it up about a month ago. When I installed the most recent Windows updates over the weekend, I lost connectivity. The PC tries to connect and gets an IP address and a DNS(?) gateway of 255.255.255.0, then it drops and says a LAN cable is disconnected. It does this repeatedly until I disable the network connection. No cables are disconnected. I've uninstalled the Windows updates done over the weekend. I've turned off the firewall, Norton firewall, and Norton virus. I've uninstalled/reinstalled the driver for the 2Wire Port. I've rebooted each time I've done any of these things. I still have the same problem. Haven't been able to find any solutions in Windows KB. Anyone out there have any thoughts or suggestions? I really appreciate the help. Thank you. Brent
