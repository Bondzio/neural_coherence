Move everything (including hidden files as well) from partition2 to partition3. 3. Make partition 2 as free space by deleting partition2. 4. Resize partition1/C: by absorbing all or part of the free space (in this case, it was part.2). I suggest all of it. Personally I have not work with this particular software before but seem like it could do this. Good luck.

The first thing to do is backup any data you do not want or cannot afford to lose. Next run Partition Wizard. Usually the way to reallocate the space is to first reduce the space allocated from an adjacent partition. For example....you would normally start by reducing E: from say 220GB to say 100GB. You would take the space from &quot;E:&quot; from the side of &quot;E:&quot; between &quot;D:&quot; So E: would shrink by 120GBs whereafter you could expand &quot;D:&quot; to use that space. Reboot the computer and check to see if the diskspace have been allocated as desired. Assuming that worked as planned, start Partition Wizard and increase the &quot;D:&quot; partition to fill the free or unallocated space formerly allocated to &quot;E:&quot;. D: would increase by 120GB for a total of 232GBs. Reboot the computer and check to see if the diskspace have been allocated as desired. Once you've done that .....start Partition Wizard again and shrink &quot;D:&quot; on the end between &quot;C:&quot; and &quot;D:&quot; by say 50GB. Reboot the computer and check to see if the diskspace have been allocated as desired. Last, start Partition Wizard and expand &quot;C:&quot; to fill the vacant space....roughly 50GBs, formerly allocated to &quot;D:&quot;. Once again.....close Partition Wizard and reboot the computer and check to see if the diskspace have been allocated as desired. Sounds complicated but it's really pretty easy if you think of it as taking contiguous space away from one partition making it available to the adjacent partition. Any questions....we'll be here. VAPCMD .
