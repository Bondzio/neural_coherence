1.1.1	Hello, I recently purchased a wireless security camera system.	St
1.1.2	It comes with it's own hub that captures the video and outputs it through A/V ports.	St
1.1.3	I want to plug the A/V chords into my laptop so that I can record the video.	St
1.1.4	A few questions I have is: 1.	St
1.1.5	Do A/V to USB adapters exist that would make sense in this situation?	St
1.1.6	2.	St
1.1.7	Do A/V to Firewire adapaters exist?	St
1.1.8	3.	St
1.1.9	What kind of software would I be looking at for recording this on a PC?	St
1.1.10	Mac?	St
1.1.11	4.	St
1.1.12	Are there any other setups I should consider?	Ques
1.1.13	For example, can I simply caputre the video from a PC off the network?	St
1.1.14	Thanks for your help!	St
1.2.1	That's called &quot;Video Capture.&quot; TOO MANY TO LIST HERE.	St
1.2.2	I'm surprised you were not flooded with options when you went shopping.	St
1.2.3	As to the network, such would a documented feature along with how or else it can't.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	does &quot;video capture&quot; refer to capturing on the network?	St
1.3.2	or capturing from a device?	St
1.3.3	i have found plenty of freeware that can handle video from a device, but nothing that can capture it off the network.	St
1.3.4	do you have any examples of these?	Ques
1.3.5	thanks heaps!	Polite
1.4.1	Let's say I have some video capture device and it is set up to save one or so many hours in a file, then another and so on.	St
1.4.2	Said file is then &quot;shared&quot; on a network or off the network (your choice.)	St
1.4.3	Seems like you can do this?	St
1.4.4	Again, there are hundreds of video capture cards and even more software.	St
1.4.5	It's like trying to find a dollar hamburger in L.A. Bob	St
1.5.1	bob.	St
1.5.2	i'm on the rgiht track now.	St
1.5.3	many thanks	Polite
