in the registry editor, i see 4 different {guid}s?
i.e.
in locating: hkey_local_machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\tcpip\parameters\interfaces\{guid} i find 4 different {guid} lines - should i make the change to all 4?
hkey_local_machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\tcpip\parameters\interfaces\{0642efcb-8e53-40c6-82bb-3788a1190acd} hkey_local_machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\tcpip\parameters\interfaces\{119f5d9f-849e-4f97-a960-89ff63afd6ee} hkey_local_machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\tcpip\parameters\interfaces\{1419d93c-0050-46a7-ab08-331abaecf716} hkey_local_machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\tcpip\parameters\interfaces\{3a539854-6a70-11db-887c-806e6f6e6963} i'm guessing that 3 of them are probably the connections i set up trying to get this machine to connect to my network, and the 4th is probably my neighbor's, whom i assist with various computer issues on a regular basis and therefore connect to his network on occasion.
so i should modify all 4 of them, correct?
wow, would it be nice to have a proper connection!!!!!
lol
