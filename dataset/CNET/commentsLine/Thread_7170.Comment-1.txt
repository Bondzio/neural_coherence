i wasn't sure where to post this, but i'm a cis student about to take a microsoft windows server class online, and i'm looking to buy a used server just to fool around with.
i'm currently looking at a used - dell poweredge sc1425 blade server for about $200.
but i've always worked with desktops, i know little about servers.
if someone has any other suggestions on what to look for to deploy an os over a small network, please let me know.
should i look at a server like this or just build a desktop type server?
