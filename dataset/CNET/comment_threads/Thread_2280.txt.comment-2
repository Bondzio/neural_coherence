First, have the drive detected and defined in the BIOS and not set to &quot;Auto&quot; where it will detect with each restart.
Next, consider whether your power supply is adequate.
It's possible the drive is not spinning up quickly enough.
You might also disable any &quot;fast detect&quot; options in the BIOS or such that does only a quick memory check.
It might mean that your entering the BIOS and doing nothing just adds enough delay time for the drive to get ready in time before Windows starts.
