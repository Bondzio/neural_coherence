Well, my PC (Win XP Pro) &quot;accepted&quot; both the drivers and the hardware and everything seemed OK, but now, whwenever I start my PC, it shows the &quot;New HArdware....&quot; window and asks for its installation. I simply click on &quot;Cancel&quot; and things go normal...printer is still there and working! But how can i tell XP -for good- that there's already a printer?

In short delete the driver you have - reboot and see what winxp installs for you - if you are not happy with the winXP version go to &quot;device manager&quot; and ask to update the winxp driver - then say have disk and search the cd for the *.inf files - and then force XP to accept the one from the cd (ignore it if you are told the driver was not written for your printer). any problems let me know peter

If it's an older printer, chances are Windows won't find a driver for it, and will ask you if you want to install from disk, or other. Then use your CD, and tell Windows to install from there. This should do it for you, and Windows may be happy that it has done it's job of bugging you
