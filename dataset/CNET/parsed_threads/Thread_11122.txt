<s> I recently replaced my PSU and graphics card in my computer. </s>
<s> Everything was fine until the monitor started to act strange. </s>
<s> I would turn on my computer and i could hear it was loading windows but the monitor will not display anything. </s>
<s> Sometimes i am able to turn of the computer and then turn it back on and it works, but now it doesnt seem to want to do anything (even though i was using it fine and hour or so before). </s>
<s> Is this problem being cause by my new graphics card or PSU r is it another issue? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> MAbey you should try it with a different computer? </s>
<s> THat'd narrow it down? </s>
<s> 'My monitor not displaying' anything isn't a question? </s>
<s> -output of new power supply...maybe not enough to support all your drives AND the new graphics card -graphics card power connector....is there one? </s>
<s> -cooling...does your card require a better cooling system? </s>
<s> -monitor...If it's a flatscreen, it should have a built-in powersaving function with a 'screensaver'. </s>
<s> If that displays correctly when disconnected from the card, but nothing shows up on your screen when plugged into the card, it could be one of two things. </s>
<s> Either the graphics card isn't sending a signal to your monitor, or it's sending a different type of signal. </s>
<s> Make sure your monitor is set to digital if you're using DVI, or analog if you're using VGA. </s>
<s> try booting into safe mode. </s>
<s> If it works fine in safe mode, you might want to try replacing the drivers for the card. </s>
