<s> I have to admit that I am to some extent accustomed to post here and chatter over trifles when I am free and spend a lot time with my gadgets. </s>
<s> But there always comes some boring things, such as the low power of ipads and phones. </s>
<s> And sometimes I found the usb connectors on my PC is not enough to support my work as convenient as possible. </s>
<s> So I searched on Amazon and found a relatively suitable item maybe I can use to solve the trouble . </s>
<s> http://www.amazon.com/product/dp/B00EHCY3AA/ But as I was used to buy peripherals from other sellers, I have no information about this. </s>
<s> Could you guys tell me your experience on the products from this seller? </s>
<s> Does this item worth being consider as a perfect one?Or some better choice? </s>
<s> Here I see &quot;Amazon Prime&quot; so as the seller is Amazon the Prime part is that returns are easy. </s>
<s> If it arrives and isn't what you wanted, it's no trouble at all to send it back. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I've ordered dozens of things from Amazon, and never had a problem with them, although I can't say how well this device will fit your needs. </s>
<s> If you're looking for convenience, you might find one of the car chargers more suitable. </s>
<s> You plug them into the 12 V power outlet in your car, then plug your devices into the car charger to charge. </s>
<s> ` Good luck. </s>
<s> OK...I guess I would look upon this way as a last choice... </s>
<s> yeah, I also give much credits on Amazon 's product quality. </s>
<s> As you say &quot;car charger&quot;, I do see it as a thing convenient for charge anytime. </s>
<s> But I comparatively need some gadgets to charge at least two at the same time. </s>
<s> So is there any kind of car charger with this function? </s>
