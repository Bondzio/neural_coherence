1.1.1	I am installing Windows XP Pro on a two year old laptop that had Windows XP Home .	St
1.1.2	I have found out that I bought the computer with a partitioned hard drive , one is primary , one is logical .	St
1.1.3	I want to merge the two into the one whole and complete hard drive .	St
1.1.4	I am staring from scratch , so none of the files are sacred .	St
1.1.5	My XP disk does not give the option of merging and I ca n't afford the $ 100.00 for Partition Magic .	St
1.1.6	Are there other options for me out there ?	Ques
1.1.7	Sony Vio , 36 GB HD , 768 RAM	St
1.2.1	allow you to remove the partitions and reformat as one partition .	St
1.2.2	Are you certain that the other partition is not a partition used by the Laptop mfr to store the op sys and all the drivers , and that your CD is actually a restore CD ?	Ques
1.2.3	Proprietary Systems normally do this , i.e .	St
1.2.4	Dell , Compaq , Gateway , etc .	St
1.3.1	Since this is laltop , you should have the orginal restore/recovcery CD if only for the & quot ; drivers & quot ; needed to make the OS install more complete .	St
1.3.2	If none or problematic , then going to the laptop makers support website for that model 's drivers will be required .	St
1.3.3	This process takes place after loading the OS .	St
1.3.4	Ray , pretty covered the OS install process , just load your XP Pro CD and & quot ; make sure the CD is 1st boot device in bios & quot ; .	St
1.3.5	Once done , when prompted upon the HD format , make all space available for a & quot ; C & quot ; drive option or 1 partition .	St
1.3.6	good luck tada -- -- -Willy	Polite
