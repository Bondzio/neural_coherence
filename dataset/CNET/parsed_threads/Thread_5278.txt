<s> Hello, I work in a University and in our dept. </s>
<s> there are several computer workgroups. </s>
<s> My computer belongs to a workgroup called ABC. </s>
<s> Now, I can connect to most of the computer under same workgroup directly by typing &quot;\\computer1&quot;. </s>
<s> However, I cannot connect to any of the computers belonging to some other workgroup. </s>
<s> I tried typing &quot;\\EFG\computer2&quot; where EFG is a name of the workgroup, but does not work. </s>
<s> I am not clear about the concepts of workgroups and interconnectivity. </s>
<s> Please advice. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> for the various workgroup names, they should all display by those names if you browse the entire network. </s>
<s> Try this rather than typing the network path and the correct route should be displayed for you. </s>
<s> If you desire, you can always map a share to your PC if you connect to it often. </s>
