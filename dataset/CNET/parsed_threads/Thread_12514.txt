<s> I have a Maxtor Basics 1TB. </s>
<s> It says to plug in the power supply first and then plug the USB into the computer. </s>
<s> I rarely need to use the hard drive so I turn it off after I have used it. </s>
<s> Is it safe to click &quot;Safely remove hardware&quot; but leave the USB plugged in and unplug it from the wall? </s>
<s> Clearly next time I want to turn it on the USB will be plugged in which the manual^ says not to do. </s>
<s> The USB design (it you must, goto usb.org and read all the fine documents) allows for this. </s>
