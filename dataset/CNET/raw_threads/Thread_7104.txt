The two routers (A) and (B) are connected by a third router (C). How do the computers on (A) communicate with those on (B) or (C). Any help on the subject or a link that explains it would be great. Thanks

Just use two of them as switches instead of routers. You could put all routers on the same subnet: For example: Router 1 (Internet Connection could be plugged into this one) 192.168.1.1 Router 2 192.168.1.2 Router 3 192.168.1.3 All the routers can then be connected with Cat5 CROSS-OVER cables. When it is two LIKE devices such as this you will need cross-over cables. Disable the firewall features on Routers 2 and 3 and you should be ok. Being behind 3 firewalls may cause issues down the road for you. All computers plugged into the 3 routers will have internet connection and be on the same network where they can share resources.
