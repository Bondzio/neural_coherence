I have ordered a printer from the online store (RX800) and they send it without the Cartridges.
Ive called imediatly and they lied to me for more then 2 weeks that they will send it.
(that was 2-3 mounths ago)...they didnt send it till now.. Do not order directly from the site!!!!!
Epson should reconsider the online store because is killing THE EPSON NAME...
