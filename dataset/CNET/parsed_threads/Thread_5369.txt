<s> Hello All, I have a scenario at hand to understand better. </s>
<s> I need your help on this. </s>
<s> I have say 3 wireless clients like PDA, iPhone and laptop that has to access the internet inside the car. </s>
<s> Now I provide internet access via a UMTS router with a plug-in PC card for connecting to ISP. </s>
<s> If I have an access point in-built with router by simply enabling wifi mode in these wireless clients I should be able to access the internet. </s>
<s> IS this so? </s>
<s> how would it be if I just have an access point? </s>
<s> I assume, if there are hotspots available, through my wireless AP i should have internet access in all my clients, right? </s>
<s> Well, one thing I want to be clear is, incase i have the UMTS router scenario, the router will provide a public IP and all my clients will be visible with this single IP to the outside, right? </s>
<s> and the router will assign private IP to each of my clients, isnt it? </s>
<s> But can the PDA alone use the mobile phone provider's internet access and still come under the network? </s>
<s> as in can two parallel connections come in one? </s>
<s> or is my understanding flawed? </s>
<s> W.r.t wireless access point, does it also give all my clients a single public IP? </s>
<s> What about private IPs? </s>
<s> I understand wireless access points dont have NAT, if so how do they distinguish clients? </s>
<s> Do please explain. </s>
<s> Any wireless home router will connect with multiple devices (laptop, desktop, wii etc) in its standard settings. </s>
<s> And they all work like they were coonected to a modem directly. </s>

<s> So do you mean to say if i plug the UMTS router given by my provider and plug in the internet PC card, all my devices connected to it will work inside a car? </s>
