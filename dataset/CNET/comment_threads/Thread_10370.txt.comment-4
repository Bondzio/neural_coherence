Then the make, model and revision of the mainboard is needed.
Here's why.
There were socket 423 and 478 RDRAM boards.
And then some boards didn't supply HT P4 CPUs.
For now you could limit your search for non-HT CPUs of the 423 or 478 P4 with the same FSB.
Sorry but I'll stick to the acronyms and you can google what they mean today.
