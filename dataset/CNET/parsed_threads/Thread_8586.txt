<s> We have 4 home computers all using Windows XP Pro. </s>
<s> We set up a home wired network (because originally used wired network, to keep the cost down and to avoid secutity issues) using a Linksys Wireless-G 2.4 Ghz Broadband Router. </s>
<s> We have networked them all through using thw Windows XP Wizard. </s>
<s> The printer is attached to one of the computers and is accessible to the network, as long as that computer is running. </s>
<s> The problem is that the fourth computer is not being recognized. </s>
<s> The message says: \\Jonathan is not accessible. </s>
<s> You might not havre permission to use this network resource.Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. </s>
<s> The network path was not found. </s>
<s> As a result we cannot access files or print remotely from this computer. </s>
<s> The other computers do not have a problem with accessibility and/or printer sharing. </s>
<s> The printer is an HP all-in-one PSC 1350 model using a USB 1.0 interface. </s>
<s> Does anyone have some suggestions as to why this is happening? </s>
<s> we have tried reconfiguring and rebooting, but to no avail. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help you can provide - Doug from Ottawa, Ontario in Canada - Brrr!! </s>
