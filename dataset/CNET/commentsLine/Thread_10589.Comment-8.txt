pcs contain to two primary contaminates, lead from solder and flame retardants.
many of the flame retardants are naturally curring substances that are non-toxic.
lead is a heavy metal and because of it's weight, it may not travel far from the landfill.
this of course varies from pc too pc and the materials used so there might be some pcs safer then others.
see the abundance of sources on the web about this topic.
this is a generalized comment and has little technical merit, see official sources for further information.
