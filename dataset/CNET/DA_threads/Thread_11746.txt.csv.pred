1.1.1	I have gotten frustrated with my current printer 's ( Canon MX310 ) propensity to chew up and engorge itself with each and any standard sized envelope ( business # 10 size ) I attempt to print .	St
1.1.2	For my own sanity I wish to purchase a dedicated envelope printer .	St
1.1.3	I need only black ink ( I do not wish to have to purchase additional color cartridges or dual purpose cartridges ) .	St
1.1.4	My volume is low ( usually no more than 10 envelopes in one day - with an average of less than 20 per week ) .	St
1.1.5	Any recommendations for something economical that actually LIKES printing envelopes rather than eating them ?	Ques
1.1.6	Many thanks !	Polite
1.2.1	If you are not doing color at all , look into getting an inexpensive laser printer , mono ( B/W only ) Brother makes an inexpensive printer that would do that , model # 2140 , you should be able to find one for around 100 bucks .	St
