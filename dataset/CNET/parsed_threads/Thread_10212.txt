<s> I had bought a dell computer a while back. </s>
<s> ive changed out a lot of parts but the mobo has only pci slots. </s>
<s> i have a pentium 4. and on newegg ive looked at some mobo that only say pentium. </s>
<s> if it fits the same slot would the processor work. </s>
<s> Having the same slot doesn't guarantee compatibility. </s>
<s> What Dell model do you have? </s>
<s> What's your goal? </s>
<s> im hoping to upgrade my computers ram and graphic card slots. </s>
<s> all it has are 2 184 slots. </s>
<s> and then 2 pci slots. </s>
<s> i want to be able to upgrade my graphics to pci express and 4GB of ram. </s>
<s> a 2004 dimension desktop. </s>
<s> it has a pentium 4 processor. </s>
<s> i don't know what slot size. </s>
<s> what do i look for to find that out. </s>
<s> A computer model number is something like &quot;Dell Dimension 8400.&quot; What's yours? </s>
<s> Once you know the model number, you can enter it (or the Dell Service Tag) at support.dell.com to get the rest of the info. </s>
<s> CPU-Z and Everest Home Edition are utilities you can download to learn your motherboard make & model number. </s>
<s> This is all moot, IMO, because there have been so many computer developments over since 2004 that you really will want to purchase or build an entirely new system. </s>
