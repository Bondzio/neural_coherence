i have a toshiba satellite also.
any type of copy-protected content (such as a commercial dvd) will only display on your laptop's screen.
if it displayed it on your tv, then it could be recorded.
(i know, it's a pain in the butt.
when i travel i'd much rather carry a few dvds and watch them on the hotel's tv rather than pay $6 for a movie.)
there are some hacks for windvd that will turn off this feature.
you could also rip the dvd to disk and remove the copy protection.
but i don't think we discuss stuff like that in this forum.
