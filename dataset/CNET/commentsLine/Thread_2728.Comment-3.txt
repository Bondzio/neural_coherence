amd x2 dual destroys the pentium d, and i'm not alone in this opinion.
i've got a the x2 and it is sweet.
i'd been a little concerned that these pre-config's might not meet your needs.
i'd like to learn what the power supply is rated at, you'll want at least 350w, 420w or higher would be good, 500+w is best.
the graphics card may need an upgrade if you do heavy graphics for web (like manipulation in photoshop) and for your gaming needs.
that could be a few hundred bones alone.
i'd definitely want 10/100/1000 base-t ethernet if you do web development for a living.
uploading sites would blaze with cat7 speed, right?
that's a mobo and ethernet card issue i'd consider, for now and for future needs.
i'd also wonder if you have enough drive bays (internal and external) for all your needs.
consider monarch computing for a more customized build.
you might pay a few hundred extra up front, but it is for value in all the right places.
or you may be upgrading later with heavy limitations like your mobo and expansion slots.
you can search my posts/profile to read about my pc rig i built for $2300 including everything: operating system, full rig, monitor, keyboard, etc.
good luck, cheers.
