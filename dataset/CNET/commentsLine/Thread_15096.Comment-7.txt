this is a regular complaint -- but the upside is that their user forum at  has to be pretty good and one of the moderators uses macs.
incidentally i've had problems connecting a friend's mac laptop and desktop to two different routers (zoom 802.11b, d-link 802.11g).
the laptop would connect to the zoom but not the dlink and the desktop would only connect to the dlink.
maybe something to do with wep vs wpa -- we spent a week on this and gave up on the laptop.
i suspect apple want you to buy their router.
