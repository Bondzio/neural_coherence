here goes.
problem #1: when scanning newsprint, the oem software looses a lot of the text.
i have ended up copying everything word for word.
then asking why use the scanner in the first place.
problem #2: i have tried to place photos onto my pages then try to edit or add text to the windows and end up with a mess.
i'm sure that i am doing things wrong, but the scanner instructions aren't exactly easy to understand, at least for me.
anyways, the pictures won't copy well and the text doesn't always print good.
problem #3: lastly, i have tried to scan to email and i fail to understand which media best travels the internet, so it is a hit or miss thing.
the omnipage program literature is better written, and understandable.
i just don't know how to make it work for me without moving the oem program out of the way.
