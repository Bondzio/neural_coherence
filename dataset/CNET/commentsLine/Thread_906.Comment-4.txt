it has to do with your concerns and if i did expand to what that sfs was and why we don't see fat32 or ntfs and that didn't appeal to you, some think it matters.
-&gt; isn't it better to know why things are the way they are?
also how about this insight -&gt; if a vendor won't answer your queries (those 4 things) why would you consider purchase of said product?
i really would enjoy your answer to my second question.
