<s> Is there any where to purchase the controler board for a Maxtor MaXLine Plus II 250GB ATA/133 drive. </s>
<s> This is a backup drive which we fried. </s>
<s> Any used supply/parts vendors out there? </s>
<s> Thank you.DAS </s>
<s> Then remove the good board? </s>
<s> I have seen faulty drives placed on eBay for such purposes. </s>
<s> They tend to auction really cheap. </s>
<s> You will stumble into eBay &quot;stores&quot; that have a lot of used and &quot;as is&quot; computer hardware. </s>
<s> I never spent money to tinker with hard drives in such a manner, though. </s>
<s> If you perform the operation, let us know how it goes. </s>
<s> Personally, I go for new drives. </s>
<s> Rebate specials on 250GB and larger drives for $70-$100 are more attractive to me. </s>
<s> The warranty is nice, too. </s>
