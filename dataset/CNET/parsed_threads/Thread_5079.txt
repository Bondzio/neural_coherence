<s> I have a generic DMP and it works fine under Dos and the self print test mode but it goes very very slow (1 cpM) under Unix. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Suspect setup or cables but not sure how to go about resolving it. </s>
<s> ok you are using a parellel port for that printer? </s>
<s> pleas e go inside your bios settings look for Perifrials menu and look for ports make sure you are set for bi directional or ecp port.. somthing other than what its set on now good luck </s>
