I then added a 200G harddrive to the pci card. I set the drive to master since it is the only one on that particular cable. I am unable to boot up the machine after adding the hard drive. My guess is that the machine is attempting to boot-up from this second hard drive. The DriveWizard that came with the drive (seagate drive) only has information for adding the drive as a slave. Any hints? Also, on the start-up screen, though I hit &quot;F1&quot;, I do not go into system set-up. TIA, Greg

The new 80 conductor cables set the drive as master/slave depending on where its plugged in. I'd retrace your steps and documentations. Old school ideas may have done you in. Bob
