1.1.1	I was under the impression that a video card , graphics card , and video adapter card were all the same thing , but now I think I 'm wrong .	St
1.1.2	On my PC , whenever I 'd run software to detect what video card I had , it would say this - & quot ; ATI 3D Rage Pro AGP & quot ; .	St
1.1.3	It 's been called a video card or a graphics card by different software I use and when listed under my device manager , it 's called an adapter card .	St
1.1.4	That 's why I thought those were all the same thing .	St
1.1.5	However , I recently purchased software that says I do n't have a video card .	St
1.1.6	I checked the requirements and it said I needed a video card that was directx 9.0 compatible and could handle up to 32-bit color and a resolution of 1024x768 .	St
1.1.7	As far as I 've been able to tell , that 3D Rage Pro meets all those requirements , but I could be wrong .	St
1.1.8	Can someone clear this up for me ?	Ques
1.2.1	The example that you gave are one and the same but if you just saay an adapter card , then it could mean lots of different types card .	St
1.2.2	As for the directX thing , Some of the newer graphic cards have directx chips built-in ( I think ) .	St
1.2.3	I do n't think rage pro meet that requirement .	St
1.3.1	Gigabyte , When refering to & quot ; graphics controllers & quot ; they can come in many flavours , onboard , PCI graphics adapters , AGP graphics adapters , and the new PCI-Express format .	St
1.3.2	All of these are & quot ; graphics controllers & quot ; The difference and what is confusing you is simply terminology .	St
1.3.3	A graphics & quot ; card & quot ; is an add on board that fits into pci or agp or pci-e slots that have an onboard video processing unit or & quot ; GPU & quot ; A video card or video adapter is the same thing really , just different terminology .	St
1.3.4	If a software application states that you must have a directX 9.0 compliant card to play , that card you have will definitely not cut it .	St
1.3.5	Your card is directX 8 compatible .	St
1.3.6	This simply means the GPU chiset is not directX 9.0 compatible .	St
1.3.7	Only the newer cards on the market are & quot ; truly & quot ; directX 9.0 compatible .	St
1.3.8	The game may still play , but with a degredation in graphics quality .	St
1.3.9	You do have a graphics card , but whether the software application will detect it is another story .	St
1.3.10	Those rage 3D cards are terribly out of date , and it would n't much suprise me to see a directx 9.0 game not recognize it .	St
1.3.11	Do you know if the rage card is AGP or PCI ?	Ques
