low-end pcs ($500 or so) can't be beaten price-wise, but they are usually either bottom barrel components or have little, if any, expanision capabilities.
once you move up to a mid-range pc ($1000), building your own becomes more competitive.
when you build your own, you can choose where you want to put your money (ram vs. cpu for example) and tailor it far better than any custom configurator.
