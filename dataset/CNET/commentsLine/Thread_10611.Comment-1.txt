so, here is my problem.
i bought a asus n6600, and it ran fine for about a day, and then basically anything 3d heavy looked like this:  i thought it was the card, so i sent it back, and recieved a new one(same model) a week later.
no change.
i can only assume its my computer, since i tested it on my friend's computer and it was fine.
what could be the problem?
a friend suggested it was overheating, but whenever i check, the gpu is always under 40c, usually the same for the cpu.
this is really starting to bother me.
what is causing this?
i have a p4 2.20ghz, with a gig of ram.
my motherboard is a gigabyte ga-8s650gxm (i can post full spec report if needed) also, yes,i have every driver posssible and everything updateable updated.
please help!
