1.1.1	First off , excuse my language .	St
1.1.2	I 'm from turkey .	St
1.1.3	I have a faculty project which will need to touch on & quot ; Channel Allocation for Ad Hoc Wireless Networks & quot ; .	St
1.1.4	I did some google search but found not much to help .	St
1.1.5	So , if anyone could refer me to a web site , a book or any document so on about this subject , i 'll be one of the happiest men in the world .	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks already .	St
1.2.1	How would this differ from Cellular Phone Channel Allocation ?	Ques
1.2.2	( Hint : it does n't )	St
1.3.1	Do you mean it 's similar to cellular phone systems ?	Ques
1.3.2	Like TDMA , FDMA and so on ?	Ques
1.4.1	You asked about channel allocation .	St
1.4.2	But a book on those protocols and more could cover channel allocation .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	I know about these protocols ( TDMA , FDMA , CDMA ... . ) but what i do n't know and could't find out is if there are any differences for these protocols or any others for using them in & quot ; Ad Hoc Wireless Networks & quot ; rather than any other network type .	St
1.6.1	This sounds like a paper project .	St
1.6.2	Or you are attempting to DOCUMENT how wifi adhoc works .	St
1.6.3	But let 's be clear that 802.11 wifi does NOT allocate channels so this makes this a very short paper .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	Yep , it is a paper project , like a minor thesis and you 're telling me there is nothing to write about this .	St
1.7.2	Actually i couldnt find something useful about that subject too so what do you recommend to do ?	Ques
1.7.3	Am i supposed to try changing subject to a more common and useful one ?	Ques
1.7.4	By the way , i 'm a little confused about the terms .	St
1.7.5	Is there a difference between & quot ; wifi & quot ; adhoc and & quot ; pure & quot ; adhoc ?	Ques
1.8.1	Wifi adhoc networks and what channel is allocated depends on a humans choice .	St
1.8.2	Since most humans do n't change the settings the channel allocation is & quot ; none. & quot ; There are proposals and studies that parallel what is done in all radio or cellular systems where you sniff the airwaves for the open channel or less cluttered but I 'll stop here since I would be duplicating all prior documents .	St
1.8.3	Back to wifi adhoc today .	St
1.8.4	There is no channel allocation I can see in the 802.11 spec on that .	St
1.8.5	You just choose and use the channel .	St
1.8.6	- & gt ; So from a paper standpoint you just go get the 802.11 papers ( costs a few bucks if your schools did n't have them in the library ) and read it over to fill in your paper on this .	St
1.8.7	Now if you were going to paper design something better then all that is moot since you just plow ahead with your new idea .	Sug
1.8.8	Bob	St
1.9.1	You tell me !	St
1.9.2	WIFI ADHOC is used today on today 's common WIFI gear .	St
1.9.3	You would have to reveal if you were writing about that or something else .	St
1.9.4	Bob	St
