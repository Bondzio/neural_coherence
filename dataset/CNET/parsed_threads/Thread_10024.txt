<s> Hello all I have an AMD chip system and need to connect a USB mouse to it. </s>
<s> When booting up I do receive the screen which indicates a new USB device has been detected etc.. challenge is, I do not have software for its' installation. </s>
<s> Is it that I might need to go to the IBM web site and d/l the software to disk or even the USB site and then try to install the proper drivers? </s>
<s> AMD, 512k memory, 20g drive Thanks... </s>
<s> AMD chipsets are not supported well by Microsoft OSes. </s>
<s> You should install the motherboard driver package and USB drivers if the maker offers them. </s>
