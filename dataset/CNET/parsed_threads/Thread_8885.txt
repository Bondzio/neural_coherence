<s> I'm working on my sisters gateway machine that has one of those dual card modems (6001856). </s>
<s> The computer recognizes it and AOL does too, but, when I try to connect online it comes back with a timeout and says no dial tone? </s>
<s> I know the line has a dial tone, it's the same one I use to dial out on with mine, not at the same time either. </s>
<s> The computer had a lot of spyware and adware on it among other things, which I removed. </s>
<s> I also even reinstalled windows without reformatting the HDD. </s>
<s> I can't figure this one out. </s>
<s> Any ideas out there. </s>
<s> I had a similar problem to a modem that would not dial, sometime found the tone, sometimes did a half dial. </s>
<s> Try reinstalling all the software and hardware(if it can be removed). </s>
<s> If this doesnt work. </s>
<s> The card may be dead. </s>
<s> It could be a part that device manager might not reveal that the actual card is bad. </s>
<s> Modems are cheap so it shouldnt be too bad if this is the case. </s>

<s> I've actually updated modem driver and placed the card in a different PCI slot. </s>
<s> Still the same situation, I'm also leaning towards a bad card now. </s>
<s> Gateway combo card, windows ME, just don't understand why the computer is showing it good. </s>
<s> Modem initializes and dials but that's it until it times out in 60 seconds. </s>
<s> sounds like a bad modem. </s>
<s> if i were you i would just buy a new one and save the hassel. </s>
<s> here are some good one[toward the end of the page] that are good. </s>

<s> Nice to see that you network when you need somwthing! </s>
