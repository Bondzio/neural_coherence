For all intents and purposes, if you want the newest out, the Emachine would be best, BUT with a 64, you have to consider the possiblility of compatabiliy issues. I have seen this more and more where many devices, apps, etc... made with the 32 in mind will not work well with 64. This was a problem with the intel itanium. 32 bit apps only use half the cpu power of the 64 and can in fact cripple it's ability to run well. I believe Amd has a patch for this with it's 64 as well may intel. It allows 32 bit OS to run smoothly on a 64 bit. Now I have to assume Emachines knew this before throwing in a 64 bit. Just looking at the processor, 64 bit is double of 32 meaning it will process double the amount. It is far faster and will be making it's way in to darn near everything in the near future. I am looking into 64 right now. So in that respect, Emachines has a heads up. On the other hand, Hp support is way better than Emachine. When I bought my Emachine, at the time was a good deal, but was told it only had 3 month warranty, was laughed at by techs there when i said i had a motherboard problem, and hung up on. Now I did finally contact management 1 year after my actual 1 year warranty was up, since i was told 3 months, and complained because my MB finally burned up. I actually had to call the corporate office to get anything done. I explained everything, they apologized, I sent the pc in. 5 days later i got it back with nothing done. I recontacted the corporate office and finally got it taken care of. Hp I have had decent experience with as far as them going above and beyond what they have to. I believe Hp and compaq are one in the same now so I don't know if it's changed but the customer support was way better. BUT, once again, i have worked on many compaq and hp and honestly can't stand them. They are slow by nature and stuffy systems. Every hp that I know of, needed upgrading even though new. I am not saying the latest will be this way but from past experience, this is what I know. Also, there was a big problem with the OS system restore. I had to call and order disks for every darn hp because the restore partition didn't work. My wife's aunt just bought a new compaq\hp and as she was using it, a message popped up saying she had so many seconds to make backup\restore disks of the OS or she could no longer restore the system if anything happened. Luckily she had 7 disks on hand and promptly did so. Others were not so lucky and missed out on the 30 second warning. Also if you use a floppy, many do not come with them anymore, just to let you know. On the other hand, emachines restore disks worked great and I could use them whenever i needed to. Also there were only 3 and it wasn't over bloated like the Hp. Things do change though and this is just my take on it having experience with both. But for what it's worth, you will most likely get a decent working machine anyway so don't let this scare ya. My emachine is going strong so far and it's been 4 years now and so are the HP's i worked with. So good luck. Paul

I have upgraded many HP pcs and all to 512 due to slow running. I apply this for not just HP's but most pcs. My kid's athlon had 256 and ran slow with XP then came the 512 and it runs great. XP is far more robust than ME or previous versions. Not saying it's better for the older version lovers out there, just that it needs more ram than 256, not to mention other apps etc...And if norton is installed, you may as well be running 64 or 128 ram until it's uninstalled for all the good 256 will do you. I am not saying some systems won't run fine on this but I think that for the most part 512 would be advisable. Paul

If you are talking about the one's at Wally-World, neither. Breware of the e-machine flat screen CRT monitors, I bought the 500 or so dollar one from wally world and never could adjust the monitor,was blury-took it back for a exchange and 2nd one was same way. You might have better luck with the compaq,you would save enough $$ to buy some extra memory,i dont know why they are even selling PC's with only 256 anymore. 99 bucks will get you a gig of memory. Which ever one you buy,uninstall all the demo crap and other un-needed programs and your new pc will be a winner. GoodLuck

It kept connecting and dis-connecting me from the internet on its own. I called their India support line, { I live in the USA} and they told me how to correct this, I did but the next day the computer had lost its &quot;mind&quot; again, went back to the same settings. Again, I called India, {why do I need India, I live in the USA} Now they are saying its a software problem, AGAIN, I ask, why should a NEW computer have a software problem. They said to reinstall Windows, I did, still problems, now its not browsing the internet. Again I called and got INDIA....grrrrrr.... I want an person from the USA I said, well they couldn't do that. So we fight again, now they decided to install windows themself, and kept me up until midnight. Though eveything was fine, nope... next morning, I tried to make a dialup connection, got the blue screen of death... Again called support, again got thrown into INDIA..... Now they decided to send a new mother board and modem. The local man came to install the stuff, when her rebooted the computer I heard him mumbling he knew he had connected the hard drive, he made some adjustments and said ok, ther eit is I thought ok, you know what you are doing and never said anything. The next morning I turned the computer on and nothing, it was trying to go into floppy drive, which I don't have.... I called support again, INDIA..... they said not to worry , so we wnet in and changed how and where it starts. That is working now, but it still won't browse the internet when connected to dialup. so I connected it to DSL and it does browse but its at the speed of a dialup connection. And now Round Rock Texas wants to have a tech call and try and trouble shoot again, I said I want my money back or I want another computer and you can take thins one and put it in your living room. My 21 day satisfaction has gone past, all teh while I have been complaining, way before the 21 days was up but the people in INDIA wasn't listening, all they wanted to so was install the software again, I ask them, hey if that is what is wrong then its still doing to do the same thing when you put the same software back in. I will NOT tell anyone ever again to buy DELL......... I almost have my laptop paid off and I will replace it with something other than a DELL..... Dell used to be helpful. Not now......on a scale of 1-9- with 1 being the low I rate them as a -2....
