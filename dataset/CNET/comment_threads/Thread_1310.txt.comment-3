Assume you are talking about the Sempron 3000+.
Curious as to where you have seen (or read) of the Barton 2800 having double the cache of the Sempron 3000?
You indicate they are both at the same price, and that may be because they are both about the same.
The Sempron 3000+ Frequency Response: 2000MHz, has the largest L2 cache (512kb) of the aprx 8 Sempron processors as opposed to their 256kb cache.
They all have 333MHz FSB.
The Athlon XP 2800 Barton has a slight increase Frequency Response: 2083MHz, has a 512kb L2 cache and 333MHz FSB.
Now if you went to the 3000+ Barton with a Frequency Response of 2100MHz it would have a 400MHz FSB
