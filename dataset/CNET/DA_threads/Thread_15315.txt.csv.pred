1.1.1	I 'm looking to replace a PC that 's recently died on me , and am looking to get the best possible machine ( just the base unit ) for under 1,000 ( around $ 1,500 ) .	St
1.1.2	I 've come across this http : //cgi.ebay.co.uk/PC-Intel-Core-i7-930-12gb-500GB-ATI-5450-1gb-DX11-HDMI-/150492224411 ? pt=UK_Computing_DesktopPCs & hash=item230a091b9b which looks like a good deal to me , but I 'm not very well educated on the quality of internal components .	St
1.1.3	i7 930 + 12gb DDR3 = Good | That 's the extent of my analysis Thanks guys !	St
1.2.1	I think intel core i7 is right choice for you .	St
1.2.2	Its performance is too good and fast .	St
