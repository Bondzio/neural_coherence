there is only one way to make sure the drive is clean and that is to zero fill it.
as we know, everything on computers comes down to 1's and zeros.
you can buy a disk at staples that will convert everything to zeros.
i bought it from a company called iolo for $20; its called drivescrubber.
here's a cool thing in addition.
since hard drives are metal and work on magnetism, there is always a chance that a tiny snippet of magnetism is left over, lets call it residual.
the same disk can write encryption over everything on the drive before putting zeros on it.
in fact, the department of defense standards is to write encryption 7 times over everything before zero-filling.
this disk can do that but one pass plus zeros is good enough.
antivirus programs can only get rid of viruses they know to exist and there are always people out there making new ones that might not be known and pout into av software definition lists.
for that reason you really cant rely on av software.
also, a lot of people will tell you that removing the partition on a disk will clean it, but actually it just makes it ready to add stuff on top of whats still there.
zero-filling is the only real way to wipe a hard drive.
