I have a Radeon 9250 256 Mb card installed, but am wondering if the Jaton Geforce 5700 pci might be better...anyone have any clue what might be better?

I picked up a BFG 5700LE and OC'ed it to 450/550 with stock cooling. It played Call of Duty, Metal of Honor, and in the upper settings. Now its sitting in my junk box until I install it in my older Dell. The 9250 is much slower. It doesn't even have a fan. Stick with the 5700LE, which is much better.
