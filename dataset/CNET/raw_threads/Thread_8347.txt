Everything was working fine for a good while, then I burned some audio cd's with windows media player 11 and all went fine. Then I ripped some cd's with windows media player with no problems. Then I tried copying some data files to my dvd+rw where I keep all of my saved programs and that's when all my troubles started. Windows does not recognized my dvd's as dvd's. It shows them as cd's. I have checked just about everything there is to check according to the searches I have done through Google and my dvd shows up as cd's and I cannot read or write to my dvd's at all. It gives me an error, &quot;please insert disk&quot; and the dvd is in the writer. It also says media not recognized. I put my dvd+rw in either writer and it just shows it blank and i know I have plenty of data on them. I can put cd's in my dvd's and read, copy, move, etc. to them all day, but of course I cannot write to them. I use a Linksys Router for my firewall and I also have a firewall for spyware, adware, and all those other kind of baddies that try to get through to my PC and I have not had any problems on that end that I can find. I ran some rootkit scanners and they come up okay. I think something changed when I ran media player to burn the audio cd's, because everything had been running fine for a good while. If it was happening on just 1 dvd, I could surmise that it might be bad but, since I have two burners doing the same thing I think something else has happened and I need some big time HELP! I have uninstalled Roxio ECDC 7 basic and some other things advised by others and still nothing good has come about. If someone out ther could give me some help I would be greatly appreciative. Thanks a bunch for listening.

A recent poster noted they had to get some update from Roxio and it worked. I won't go find that for you but Windows XP doesn't know what a DVDRW drive is. Never has and never will. Don't try to fix that. Work on your Roxio issue. &quot;I cannot read or write to my dvd's at all. It gives me an error, &quot;please insert disk&quot; and the dvd is in the writer.&quot; Research removing the UPPERFILTERS and LOWERFILTERS entries in the registry if no media is being read. Also if you use any packet writing software you have to reinstall that or the media is not readable. Bob

I uninstalled Windows XP Pro SP3, then updated SP2, then I uninstalled Internet Explorer 7 and it reverted to version 6 and I updated version 6 and then I did a clean uninstall of Roxio ECDC 7 basic. Then while leaving my computer with Windows XP Pro SP2(updated)and Internet Explore 6(updated), I reinstalled Roxio ECDC 7 Basic from my Plextor DVD and everything has worked fine ever since. I had to make a few adjustments as they came up, but none were real hard and now I can write to my all my optical drives with Roxio ECDC. DrgToDsk works great again without a hitch. Again thanks alot for steering me in the right direction.
