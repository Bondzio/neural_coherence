I'm a musician and recently purchased a Roland Juno-G Workstation.
As indicated on the following diagram: http://www.keyboardmag.com/pop-up.aspx?content_id=29104&section_code=1 This piece of equipment has a slot for a flash adaptor.
I am unsure of what exactly I need to purchase, or what I SHOULD purchase.
I was wondering if someone could point me to a website that sells exactly what I need and that ships to the US.
