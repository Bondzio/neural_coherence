Wired here says that they think that they know what the new rumored Mac portable will be like.
You know, I can understand that post, but what really makes me wonder is often the images that places like these put up as concept images.
First of all, they did say their images could be wrong, and I can already prove them wrong.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but in Leopard, the Apple and Spotlight icons in the Finder are not blue like in Tiger, but rather, the new black/aluminum color like the iMacs.
If people are going to Photoshop images, at least get the OS images right.
But maybe those guys at Cupertino run Tiger on all of their test/concept items...
I doubt that, but they do have OS X on PCs for the developers, so anything could happen.
