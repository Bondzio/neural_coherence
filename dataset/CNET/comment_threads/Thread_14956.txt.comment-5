Thanks so much for this suggestion.
I will take it into consideration.
I've been reading reviews on a lot of D-Link products, i.e.
Routers and it's a hit and miss type of situation with varying reviews.
I just want my PCI card and laptop adapter to be compatible with whatever D-Link router I purchase.
I don't have a lot of funds to purchase lots of unneccesary peripherals so I need to keep this very economical and basic.
Once again, thanks for your suggestion.
