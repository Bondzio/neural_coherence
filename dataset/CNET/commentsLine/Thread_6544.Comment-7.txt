i have an intel 955x mobo and my computer suddenly refused to turn back on yesterday.
my hd's, fans, video card, and mouse serial port are getting power, but my keyboard serial port and dvd drive are getting nothing and my monitor is getting no data from the video card's output.
anyone have any ideas?
i'm thinking of going mobo shopping today...unless i can think of something else it could be.
(i get no alerts when i remove the memory and power on the machine.
any ideas on good off-brand boards that would support the pentium-d 945?
it needs to have the ability to control my two striped sata2 drives as well as my single sata2 hd (so i think that means i need 2 raid controllers right?
i also want capabilities for 2 ati saphire radeon 512mb video cards.
anyone?
help?
