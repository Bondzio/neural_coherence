<s> But here's the GPU list I like. </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html That 7750 should best the current GPU but be sure to check benchmarks. </s>
<s> If you change the motherboard you are in for a lot more cost. </s>
<s> Power supply, OS, etc. </s>
<s> My added thought. </s>
<s> Unplug the modem if you don't use it. </s>
<s> It's a few saved Watts and you need every one of them. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> performance GPU. </s>
<s> With only 250 watts...you're probably looking at an upgrade GPU AND A PSU.. VAPCMD </s>
<s> forgot to say i did upgrade psu to 500 watts. </s>
<s> my video card didnt work without it. </s>
<s> i think my nvida is cool i can play Leage of Legends in 60 frames. </s>
<s> maybe just a new cpu. </s>
<s> mines only 2 cores. </s>
<s> also i had a brown out few weeks go my pc was acting funny so i factory reboot. </s>
<s> it kinda got better. </s>
<s> now oscially i get blue screens </s>
<s> faster with faster CPUs. </s>
<s> Usually it's just GPUs and the GTS 250 is way down the list of GPUs in the gaming world. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> If you are using 1333 ram you might find the machine to be a tad faster if you remove the 2x1GB sticks. </s>
<s> If you are not using 1333 ram you might want to head over to &quot;crucial&quot; and pick up a 2x4GB kit. </s>
<s> Remove all the sticks and fit in the kit. </s>
<s> The gpu upgrade would be easiest ........just keep the psu in mind as you go up the list. </s>
<s> Cpu upgrade?........can be easy or it might turn into a nightmare. </s>
<s> Gpu......you have a middle of the pack unit. </s>
<s> I'd leave that alone for now. </s>
<s> Cpu.......You have a very low end unit. </s>
<s> That could use some work. </s>
<s> Ram.....I'll take a guess you have 6GB of low speed ram. </s>
<s> If true.....that could use some work. </s>
<s> Only you know what the budget is and what your comfortable with doing. </s>
<s> Ram...50 bucks. </s>
<s> Cpu....100 bucks. </s>
<s> If you swap the cpu it might be best to get the latest bios before the swap. </s>
<s> is 5GB ? </s>
<s> Which 500 watt PSU do you have ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
