MS's article on the subject of file sharing in XP.... http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;304040 Basically you would turn off Simple File Sharing on the View tab of Windows Explorer's Tools menu. Then you can set the permissions for each individual folder's sharing properties by right clicking and choosing Sharing and Security.

I have turned off simple sharing, and I can still access the folders from the PC I don't it to access.... i have been told that MAC address filtering can do what i say above, is it right? and can u tell me how to make MAC address filtering? and another alternative way is to use the Windows Firewall to block off the file and print sharing service except from the IP addresses of my machines, is it true? and how can configure window firewall?
