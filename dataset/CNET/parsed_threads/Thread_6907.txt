<s> Wondering if anybody could help here...I have a 23&quot; Cinema Display (the older model with the clear plastic casing) Hooked up to a Powermac G5 Dual 2ghz. </s>
<s> On the lower left hand corner there is a little sun looking symbol which when I press it illuminates and brings up my monitor preferences. </s>
<s> It's actually not really a button but seems to be touch sensitive. </s>
<s> On the lower right hand corner there is a power symbol that is already illuminated and when I touch that it gets brighter but nothing happens. </s>
<s> I'm assuming this button turns the mac on and off but I haven't been able to figure out how. </s>
<s> I've googled it but to no luck and also have looked around my system preferences to see if some setting needs to be turned on but can't seem to find that either. </s>
<s> Not a big deal but would be nice to turn on my computer from the button on the screen and not on the tower since it is on the floor. </s>
<s> thanks, n3w </s>

<s> If the lamp is illumintated, then all is well in the world and touching the button, which is touch sensitive, &quot;might&quot; turn the machine off. </s>
<s> I doubt that though as the ability to shut down from the keyboard has been removed from all Macs now. </s>
<s> You could try touching the button for some time and the machine &quot;might&quot; shut off but it is NOT a nice way to shut the machine down. </s>
<s> It's akin to yanking the powercord out. </s>
<s> You can do this on a G4 Cube. </s>
<s> If the machine is OFF, touching that button &quot;should&quot; turn the machine back on again. </s>
<s> Try it and see P </s>
<s> It isn't doing anything...I guess it will just be a useless feature of my monitor...no biggie though. </s>
<s> Thanks for the tips. </s>
