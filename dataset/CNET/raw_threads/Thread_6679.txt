I am not confortable to add the stealth softwares such as netnanny on the computer. I have 2 laptops and both are used. So it is better to add the monitoring on the router. This is for my home. Any ideas or softwares? Checked internet and did not find but seems like this is possible. Any information is appreciated Thanks
