i had the same problem.
i also d/l and game a lot.
i bought a gateway 9310x and after 3 mo.
the hard drive failed.
got a replacement on warrenty and that one failed roughly 3 mo.
later.
started to figure out the drive was getting really hot sitting tucked away where there was no air flow.
i noticed that after the hard drive had been working a lot (ie dowloading from bt overnight) the system would run extremley slowly.
the hard drive was hot to the touch.
i got a new drive about a year ago and its been sitting on top of my comp with a fan purchaced at target blowing on it.
i have had no problems since.
i just now bought a new case with many fans so hopefully it will work.
