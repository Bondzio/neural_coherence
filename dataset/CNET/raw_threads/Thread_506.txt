The most I can hear is a sort of faint click from the power supply. I tried removing all the components, putting them back in, and so on, but I have absolutely no clue why it's not working. Advice?

Make sure the power supply &quot;voltage selection 115/230&quot; switch is correct...115V Next, make darn sure the frt. panel power-ON cable is on the proper connection, usually a 2-pin hook-up. Labeling may sometimes confuse it with &quot;remote&quot; power-ON or similar. Just shorting the 2-pins momentary will allow a power-ON as that's what the frt. sw. does. I *assume* alot here, so verify again all connections and proper ordinations, etc. is correct. Make a simple system w/o any HD or CD, just the ram, video, kybd. and FD present for a basic system. good luck -----Willy

But if you remove the motherboard from the case (to avoid shorting out the backside in the case), add CPU/HeatSinkFan, plus a speaker, with just that and a power supply (no memory, video, etc.) You'll get beeps of protest unless the BIOS battery is dead, the reset jumper is on wrong, the CMOS clear jumper is set to CLEAR... If not you are staring at the four possible bad parts. Bad can mean wrongly jumpered too. Bob

If it sort of twitches and stops, this means it is trying to turn on but has detected a load problem. Usually something is shorted. It could be the MB to the chassis due to a hidden mounting post still under the MB. It could be an improperly seated component. You can also check to see if your MB has an LED on it to indicate presense of the control voltage needed to turn on the other PS circuits. If LED is not working, there is no power to MB. Keep checking and good luck.

The faint click could be coming from the switch itself. Roger
