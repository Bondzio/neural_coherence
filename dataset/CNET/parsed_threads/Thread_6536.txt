<s> I have a Dell Dimension 2400 and I was board one day so I opened up the case (not the first time). </s>
<s> While I was doing so I decided to move a PCI card over one slot to give my video card a bit more room to breath when I noticed that there was something that seems to be a layout for putting an AGP slot in. </s>
<s> It is slighty farther back then the PCI slots (like all the AGP slots I have seen on motherboards) and it is the top slot (if there was a slot). </s>
<s> To get to the point, is it possible to buy an AGP slot so I can use AGP video cards? </s>
<s> Look for mrbios.com or other BIOS suppliers if you need to try overclocking. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> printed circuit and soldered through holes that would be used for installing an AGP socket?? </s>
<s> An expert micro miniature soldering person could solder it in, however the firs thing would be to deteremine if there is actually the proper artwork connected to the solder spots. </s>
<s> Twould take a little deft work with a DVM, and a likely schematic/wiring daigram. </s>
<s> The AGP has a special power circuit and more. </s>
<s> If I wanted to cut the costs for a special lowball PC, I'd not put those parts on or... recycle a goofed AGP board into such a machine rather than scrap the run. </s>
<s> No one I've met in 30 years of PC design (and I'm around my engineering friends) has ever done this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> that it is unlikely to work. </s>
<s> I think that I have only seen one such mobo and never checked any of the plated thru vias to see if they went anywhere. </s>
<s> Probably just filled to protect the mobo inner layers. </s>
<s> Don't tell a solder to put on a AGP slot on your AGP-less motherboard cause it will screw up big time! </s>
<s> I tried it once 2 years ago with my old motherboard and the slot fried right on the moment of when I turned on the PC( hecka pissed me off), so I recommend you to get a motherboard with AGP 8X instead( they're pretty cheap these days) </s>
