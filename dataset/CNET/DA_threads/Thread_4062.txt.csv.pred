1.1.1	my new graphic card should fit in the agp 4x slot even though its agp8x i heard its compatible but the metal bracket that surrounds the dvi/ s video plug is too small i think my new one has a low profile bracket and my current one has a full height bracket but i cant switch the brackets because my current graphic card uses one vga connecter while the new one uses a dvi and s video connector i have a converter for that but the bracket is still an issue .	St
1.1.2	i was thinking maybe i should remove the low profile bracket of of the new graphic card and use aluminum foil so the graphic card wont be hanging out and leave a hole for dust to enter into will that work ?	Sug
1.1.3	or is there anything else other than buying a new graphic card that i can do .	St
1.2.1	I think the risk of a piece causing a short is so high that I 'd make one of plastic .	St
1.2.2	As to dust , no PC I know is dust proof so that 's an odd thought .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	So is using plastic better than using aluminum foil because i thought that plastic would melt but if its plastic i should use than i can find some easy to cut plastic around maybe a binder or something like that .	St
1.4.1	That means we are well past the danger zone of the chips frying .	St
1.4.2	That 's hot !	St
1.5.1	wait i have n't tried using plastic i was asking if it would be better to use than aluminum foil and i was just predicting that it will get hot and melt but i do n't actually now if it will melt or not .	Ques
1.5.2	The computer we have should n't get that hot anyways.. so should i use plastic replace the metal bracket that is too small ?	Ques
1.6.1	Plastic gives anyone a shot at getting it done .	St
1.6.2	Metal ( any type ) comes with & quot ; extra skill required & quot ; but FOIL gives me a bad feeling as it could fall into the machine .	St
1.6.3	Yes I 've headed to the shop to make a new custom bracket when needed .	St
1.6.4	It 's just sheet metal so tin snips and a drill press then some creative bending was all that was ever needed .	St
1.6.5	Plastic could be the easy and safe fix .	St
1.6.6	Bob	St
1.7.1	I do agree with all you said and since i do n't have that much skill in using drills i wouldnt want to mess anything up so I 'll just use plastic thanks for answering my questions .	St
