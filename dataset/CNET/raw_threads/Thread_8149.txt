I wanna get xbox live working but im not sure if I can set it up where I have it now. I have it in my room and I also have a computer in here. The coimputer is hooked up to the internet thru a linksys wireless card that goes to the router. My question is, can I hook my xbox up to this computer up here (with the wireless card) and bridge the connection? Ive tried selecting the xbox connection and my wireless and hitting bridge but it doesnt get my xbox connected. Any ideas? Im on Windows XP by the way. -Hendrik
