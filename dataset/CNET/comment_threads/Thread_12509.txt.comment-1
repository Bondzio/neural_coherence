My dad bought me an iPad last month at best buy, but I dont like the rubber case that he purchased it with.
Any of the girls or guys on the forum that can give a sense of direction on where I can find a leather ipad case?
I went back to best buy, but they don't seem to have much of a collection for women.
I also checked online for a women's case, but I am not convinced they are made of real leather.
I welcome any person that has bought a case that they are happy with.
Please post any pics or the brand, or where you bought your ipad case.
Thanks everyone!
have a merry Christmas.
