<s> I have 1 gb of memory currently installed. </s>
<s> I recently caught a nasty bug, removed it, but every time I shut down the pc, I get an error about unable to read memory. </s>
<s> When my pc boots up, at the dos screen before windows, it reads 512mb memory, but I know there is 1 1024 installed. </s>
<s> Also, windows tells me that 1024/1gb is installed. </s>
<s> Whats going on?. </s>
<s> My system info is on my profile. </s>
<s> 1024MB and 1GB are equivical, so Windows is probably displaying one or the other (or both, either way its just a registry value that determines whats displayed there). </s>
<s> If you're getting memory read errors thats probably a problem with Windows, you might consider reformatting, or at least running something like CCleaner to see if you can glean some of the issues out. </s>
<s> Not sure why POST is giving you 512MB of RAM, if its a 1x1024MB stick it shouldn't/can't read half of it (unless the mainboard can only address 512MB per DIMM, which would be an entirely different can of worms). </s>
<s> I have 4 256mb modules installed, and still just the initial dos boot screen says 512 ok and windows system info says 1gb ok. </s>
<s> The error reading cannot read memory location is random, never occuring repeatedly. </s>
<s> My system has been running slower recently too. </s>
<s> I cleaned up the hard drive and defragged, but problem persists. </s>
<s> I'd suggest a reformat of the system, sounds like Windows dearly needs it </s>
