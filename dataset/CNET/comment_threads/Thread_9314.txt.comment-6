The behavior you describe is normal for an &quot;ATX&quot; type power supply, the type used in virtually all PC's made in the last 5 years or so.
An ATX supply is actually turned on via the motherboard.
The switch on the back of the supply, if any, only switches on/off the AC going into the supply.
To test on the bench, you need first attach a &quot;load&quot; to the supply to prevent damage, then jumper pins 14 and 15 to start the supply.
PLEASE DO NOT try this if you are not comfortable playing around with electricity!
