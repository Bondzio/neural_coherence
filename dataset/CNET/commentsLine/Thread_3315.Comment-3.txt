hi bob.
i was able to restore the update functionality in malwarebytes using this post:  &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt;my computer was previously checked for malware and viruses on another forum.
&lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;i think the update issues were a result of the infection that is now gone.
thank you for getting back to me.
