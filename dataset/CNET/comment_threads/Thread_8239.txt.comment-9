Ben, thanks so much for your reply to my question.
The brand recommendation if very much appreciated.
Also your specific statements of range are very useful to me.
I do have one question further for you if you can help.
What effect does the 50% signal strength have on the speed and/or dependability of your work on your network?
Do you see a decrease in speed of operation?
Do you experience a degradation of accuracy of transmissions?
Thanks...Joe W...
