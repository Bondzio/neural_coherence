I have 1 Tb seagate hard disk which was working fine but now when i connect it to my laptop running with windows7, windows detects the Hard disk and Icon of the disk displays at my computer.
But when I double click it to open it shows an error message box &quot; Location is not available f:/ is not accessible Access denied&quot;.
And when I see properties by right clicking it is shows Used Space 0 bytes Free Space 0 bytes Capacity 0 Bytes Also tried to check it for errors from tools It shows error message &quot;The disk check could not be performed because windows can not access the disk&quot; And also i have to tried to access it from command prompt (Run as administrator) using command f: It shows &quot;Access denied&quot; When I try to change access permission from properties/security by providing full control or changing the owner it shows &quot;unable to save the changes in permission information&quot;.
And finally when I try to format the disk It shows &quot;You do not have sufficient rights to perform this operation&quot;.
&lt;div&gt;And I have also tested two other external drives(WD &amp; seagate)but faced the same issue.&lt;/div&gt;How could this is possible that one day disk is working fine and next day it has this issue.
Please provide some solution to fix this.
