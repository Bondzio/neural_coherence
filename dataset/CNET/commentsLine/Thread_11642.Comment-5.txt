i've searched and found a firmware upgrade for the dvd drive (not on the lg site) which allows for 8x dvd+r dl writing, which is advertised on the lg packaging.
i've also e-mailed them regarding the lack of manual or support on their website for that drive.
no response yet, though the included software does check for updates.
i suppose maybe because it's new?
still, you think they would have their support site updated as they release new products - not impressed.
ever since i purchased my notebook with 1gb of memory, i've definitely noticed a difference between the notebook and desktop when running many apps at once.
i am going to go with crucial 2x512gb memory upgrade for the sony desktop.
crucial costs a few more dollars but seems to be trusted.
i'll let you know how that works out... i hadn't thought about turning the old 80gb internal drive into an external drive and just did some research.
case kits are cheap enough, i'll probably do that next week.
just curious why you're biased against maxtor drives & weren't they recently purchased by seagate?
thanks again for the support!
