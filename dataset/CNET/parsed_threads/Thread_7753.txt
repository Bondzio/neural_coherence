<s> from a computer? </s>
<s> Whether you can do this or not depends on your computer (specifically your graphics card) and your TV (specifically it's video inputs). </s>
<s> You can do this if any of the following are true: * Your graphics card has S-Video out and your TV has S-Video in. </s>
<s> (Average quality.) </s>
<s> * Your graphics card has composite video out and your TV has composite video in. </s>
<s> * Your graphics card has a DVI-I connector, as does your high-tech TV. </s>
<s> If none of the above are true, you can still do it if you connect your TV and computer to a network, but the hardware would be more expensive than a new graphics card. </s>
