Also there are those athlon based machines with the nvidia chip problem.
No software is the cause for that issue.
I can only guess why you would download chrome if it was running.
But let's note this.
Chrome is a very nice browser that will eat a lot of ram.
Newer users might try to open many tabs and not understand why it gets slower or worse.
I wonder if they will be the first ones to have 128 GB RAM machines?
