1.1.1	I recently purchased a second Hard Drive to add to my system .	St
1.1.2	My old 40 Gig simply was n't able to handle it anymore .	St
1.1.3	I plan on keeping this drive though and using the new one to store games , music , downloads , etc .	St
1.1.4	I 've gotten to the point where I 'm ready to install the new drive and I have a few questions .	St
1.1.5	Should this drive be set up as the slave drive ?	Ques
1.1.6	Would I need to format it in any way or can I just store things right off the bat ?	Ques
1.1.7	Any other useful tips you would suggest ?	Ques
1.1.8	I 'm running Windows XP Pro .	St
1.2.1	Simply jumper it as Slave and attach to the Primary IDE cable .	St
1.2.2	Then start you PC and check in the bIOS that the new HDD is recognized and then boot into XP and go to Disk Management .	St
1.2.3	Right-click the new HDD and create a new partition and then format it to NTFS before you can start using the HDD .	St
1.2.4	If you want to you can create more partitions to suit your needs .	St
1.2.5	If the drive letters are assigned after that for your CD-RW drive you cna use Disk Management to change the drive letters as you see fit .	St
1.2.6	See these links : http : //support.microsoft.com/default.aspx ? scid=kb ; en-us ; 309000 http : //support.microsoft.com/default.aspx ? scid=kb ; en-us ; Q313348	Ques
1.3.1	just my preference , when I put in a second drive I always format it as a system disk and put an OS on it too in case the other drive dies suddenly .	St
1.3.2	I do n't know XP but I always do & quot ; cable select & quot ; on the jumpers .	St
1.3.3	works well for me and makes things easier and more versatile if you 're & quot ; the mess around with it & quot ; type .	St
1.3.4	I also always put in a second parition of about 1 gig so I can put my delorme map CD on that and not have to put it in the CD drive for it to work .	St
1.3.5	-- -fj	St
1.4.1	Frank , FYI , I have a Perly 's Road Map CD which normally requires the CD to be in the CD-ROM drive when searching for the road maps .	St
1.4.2	I did n't have to create another partition to do what you did .	St
1.4.3	I simply copy the contents to the Perly 's Folder on the C Drive and there after it works without the need for the CD .	St
1.4.4	Cheers .	Polite
1.5.1	So if I was to go the & quot ; cable select & quot ; route rather than master/slave , the cable select would be selected on both drives ?	Ques
1.5.2	How does the system know which drive to boot from ?	Ques
1.5.3	Another issue I have thought of is the fact that I have a USB keyboard that is not & quot ; active & quot ; until I actually choose a profile .	St
1.5.4	Is this going to cause problems ?	Ques
1.6.1	If you chose Cable Select you should attach the Boot drive to the outer connector while the middle connector is for the second HDD .	St
1.7.1	Well I 've got it installed but I have a couple more questions .	St
1.7.2	The keyboard issue came back to haunt me .	St
1.7.3	I ca n't access the CMOS thing to check the BIOS so I was n't able to switch it to NFTS .	St
1.7.4	Any way around this other than buying a different cheap keyboard ?	Ques
1.7.5	For now I simply booted from the main drive and did Run -- & gt ; compmgmt.csm .	St
1.7.6	The drive showed up but said it onle had 111GB free .	St
1.7.7	It is a 120GB Western Digital hard drive .	St
1.7.8	I seem to remember Bob telling someone that it may be because its using a FAT 32 setup .	St
1.7.9	Is this right ?	Ques
1.7.10	One more problem ; the screw holes on the hard drive itself do not match up with the screw holes on my case .	St
1.7.11	Is this a big issue ?	Ques
1.7.12	Other than those things , everything seems to be fine .	St
1.7.13	I appreciate all the help .	Polite
1.7.14	Now I just need a tad bit more .	St
1.8.1	The screw holes on all cases and drives are in the exact same place , if yours do n't line up you may have the drive backwards or incorrectly placed , drives just do n't vary at all in where they have the holes .	St
1.8.2	Free space does n't mean total space , how much space does it show total ( capacity ) when you right click on the drive and select properties .	St
1.8.3	Whatever number you see , multiply it by 1024x1024x1024 to get the actual size in bytes .	St
1.8.4	In the case of a 111GB drive that comes out to 119.1 billion bytes , quite close to 120GB .	St
1.9.1	Your questions on HDD size & screw holes have been answered .	St
1.9.2	Re your USB Keyboard , since you ca n't use it to access the BIOS setup you 'll have to get a PS/2 Keyboard to do so .	St
1.9.3	I noticed in my BIOS there is an option to enable Legacy USB Support .	St
1.9.4	But that may not mean that the USB Keyboard will let you access the BIOS setup .	St
1.9.5	Unfortunately I do not use a USB KB so I can not test it .	St
1.9.6	On switching to NTFS in BIOS setup ... this is not the way it 's done .	St
1.9.7	You can boot into XP and use Disk Management to format the 120GB to NTFS .	St
1.9.8	If there is data on it , do n't format but use the conversion tool to convert the volume to NTFS .	St
1.9.9	See this link : http : //aumha.org/win5/a/ntfscvt.php Or open the Help & Support Center and research convert to NTFS .	St
1.10.1	The screw hole thing still baffles me .	St
1.10.2	I 'm telling you it does n't match up .	St
1.10.3	I know the drive is in correctly .	St
1.10.4	I would take pics but I have nowhere to host them .	St
1.10.5	Why would I need to access the BIOS anyways ?	Ques
1.10.6	Will it cause problems if I just go ahead and finish partitioning the drive without going into the BIOS settings ?	Ques
1.11.1	thanks for the info , I think I once tried just putting it into a directory like you described but it did n't work -- It had to be in the root directory or no go .	St
1.11.2	hence the partition .	St
1.11.3	see ya !	St
1.11.4	-fj	St
1.12.1	hi mike , am baffled by your lack of screw hole , that is very odd .	St
1.12.2	anyway , re : cable select etc. , you should have 2 IDE connectors on your motherboard -- numbered ( and you should see this on the board itself ) 1 and 2. your cable ( use the 80 pin ! )	Sug
1.12.3	has 3 plugs .	St
1.12.4	the blue one that is mid-way on the cable is for the slave drive .	St
1.12.5	note , whichever end of the cable is furthest away from that middle connector goes to the motherboard .	St
1.12.6	the drive at the other END of the cable plugged into the ide # 1 slot is for your primary master .	St
1.12.7	( again , the the drive that uses the connector in the middle of the cable is the primary slave . )	St
1.12.8	drives plugged into cable going to ide 2 are the secondary master and secondary slave .	St
1.12.9	you 'll see the drives being recognized with those names during the Bios POST .	St
1.12.10	note the system usually hunts thru the drives in that order until it finds a disk it can boot from .	St
1.12.11	another hint , if you have 2 drives , put the second drive and the CD rom on the secondary connector , leave the primary master all to itself on its own cable , may speed things up a little .	St
1.12.12	clear as mud ?	Ques
1.12.13	- fj	St
1.13.1	adding a second HDD , i have lost all my daata doing things like this before ...	St
1.13.2	The program r-studio 2.0 works and saved my life recovering everything from my delted partition .	St
1.13.3	Whatever is your slave HDD make sure you move the little plastic thing on the pins in the middle of the hdd plugs ( on the back ) ninty degrees , so that it is no longer able to recognise that hard drive as a master ... you can find out most of the info you need on replcing a HDD on the seagate site : http : //www.seagate.com/support/disc/install.html http : //www.seagate.com/support/disc/specs/techlib.html	St
