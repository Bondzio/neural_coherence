This is a project that I have been working on for about a week now...I've been trying to see if I can build a 64-bit PC for less than seven hundred dollars.
And this morning I finally did it!
Here's the config: Case: Antec Solution Series- $56 Motherboard: ECS 755-A-$80 Processor: AMD Athlon 64 2800+- $187 Memory: Geil Ultra Series Platinum (512 MB DDR433)-$128 Video Card: Gigabyte Radeon 9200- $69.99 Optical Drive: Lite-On LTC-48161H (DVD-ROM/CD-RW combo)-$43.50 Floppy: Alps DF354H068F- $14 Hard drive: Samsung SP1604N (160 GB)- $93 I can get all that for $675.99!
Now all I have to do is build it and see how it does...
