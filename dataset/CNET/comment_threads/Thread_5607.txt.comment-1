My HP hard drive just went splat (i'm at the library now).
The hard drive I have is an IDE drive, but the PC I am about to buy has an SATA drive.
I'm told I can not put the IDE drive in the new PC with the SATA drive, as my current PC wont even boot up how can I get the info on the IDE hard drive off & somehow on to the new PC with SATA drive?
PLEASE PLEASE HELP Thanks
