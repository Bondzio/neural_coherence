hopefully when you used that eide drive it didn't overwrite your &quot;regular&quot; master boot record.
usually by default the first ide hd becomes the boot drive (at least on all sata pc's i have worked on.)
regarding cmos checksum error..if it isn't fixed by removing that ide drive, try resetting the cmos/bios to defaults by either using the special jumpers...or removing the battery.
consult your specific mobo tech references.
