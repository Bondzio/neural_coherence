<s> if i use an adapter to connect an analog monitor to a dvi port on the card(instead of buying a monitor with dvi), is there an actual loss in image quality of an analog image itself, or is it simply that getting a digital monitor is just better since it takes advantage of better technology.. </s>
<s> You should try it. </s>
<s> The ones I've seen didn't seem any better or worse to me. </s>
<s> Remember I've seen over a thousand displays over the years and know that a .28 dot pitch will look just as bad on DVI as VGA. </s>
<s> And better displays look about the same. </s>
<s> You may ask why? </s>
<s> It's this simple. </s>
<s> To move to higher scan rates and pixel counts and dual or more displays, the &quot;DAC&quot; needs to be changed and the connections improved. </s>
<s> Also some convergence with HDTV is forecast. </s>
