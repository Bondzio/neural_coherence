I would like to know how to tell if it will work in my computer. My computer is a Dell Dimension 2100, running Windows ME. It has one 128mb stick of RAM in it. I think it uses SDRAM but I'm not positive. Any help anyone can give me would be appreciated. Thanks!

When I did that, Crucial.com says that your computer takes PC133 type memory modules. Two 256MB modules equals the maximum of 512MB. See if you get the same information. About the stick of RAM that was given to you, what do the markings and/or stickers say on it?

The first one being, can I put that stick of memory in my computer? The second, I also just received a box of old RAM for another friend and he said that he thought if the a stick of RAM had those two little notches in the bottom that they would work (the RAM that's already in my PC has the two notches). Is this true? Thanks again for all the help! P.S. Sorry for the delay in my replys, I have extremly slow dial-up.
8502	5	195726	2109436	2108480	linkit	8/3/06 5:12 AM	1.15458192E12	I'd give it a try	If the notches match, that's a good sign. Investigate (Google) each RAM module to learn its type and size. I would only insert PC133 RAM modules. Some PC100 modules may work in that motherboard. For me, it would be worth it to try some modules in that slot. Why? That is an older computer and I wouldn't care if something were to go wrong. Plus, I don't invest in PC100 or PC133 RAM these days. I would only upgrade that machine if I happened upon &quot;a box of old RAM.&quot; Happy hunting!
