A number of conditions: First off do not pull the drive from the main computer without Safely Removing the Hardware.
Use the disconnect icon to the lower right side of the screen.
Yes I know it is suppose to be Puug&quot;n&quot;play but for some reason attached USB devices like hard drives and thumb (sticks) drives can loose the boot sector.
Keep trying to get a read on the drive by using it on another system.
If you can't, look into a restore program.
Go to TUCOWS.COM and get all you want there.
