there has been a lot of talk and promotion of &quot;clouds&quot; lately, i won't go into an explanation of what a &quot;cloud&quot; is, because i'm assuming most of you are tech friendly... however, &quot;clouds&quot; depend on file storage and sharing on off-source servers... and, as we have seen lately in the news, there have already been several file-sharing services that have been &quot;shut down&quot; by either financial forces, or by government interference... whatever you might have stored on these &quot;cloud&quot; servers, including aunty gladys' picture will be gone... vapourised... as any cloud would be... eventually... save your data to multiple drives... backup to dvds... cheap... and a lot more reliable... sam
