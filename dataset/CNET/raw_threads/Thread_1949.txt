At the 75-hertz refresh rate, this does not happen. Dell recommended 60-hertz as &quot;optimal&quot;. I tried disabling some nearby electronic devices, but that didn't work. How do I correct this problem?

If I don't reset the settings to factory default after the log-on screen appears, text is coarse and blurry. But I don't want to have to reset all settings to factory default after every restart to get a clear picture. Is there some way I can do this?

About messages during boot and shutdown. This is an area that has bothered new to PC people for over a decade. Let me share that such displays were never standardised and you will indeed see such informational messages during the transitions. The Apple Macintosh is better at this and some will take comfort there. Bob

The flicker problem on my monitor can only be resolved by increasing the refresh rate, and I've done that. I'll ignore what Dell recommended as optimal.

The issue there was the circuity that drove the electron deflection coils could overheat and fail if you were pushing them. This is not true for LCD displays. This post will be my last about this issue since there is not much of an issue to chew on here. Its sad that someone has misled you a little here. You seem to be seeking some assurance I can't give you. Bob
