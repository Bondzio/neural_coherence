<s> I keep getting a timeout page every time I try to access a domain I recently purchased ( www.ledotax.com). </s>
<s> I assume that since the first time I tried to access the domain it was unresolved the router cache the domain as being unassigned and so this is a simple issue of clearing the DNS cache, but I cannot figure out how to clear it. </s>
<s> I have tried resetting to factory defaults, updating firmware, and telnetting into the router (which apparently is not an option with this router), I even tried using a hacked DI-624 firmware because it supposedly gives you more options in the control panel than the 524, but I still can't find anything useful. </s>
<s> Removing the the router and connecting directly to the modem yields no problems at all so I am positive the error lies with the router. </s>
<s> Below is my set-up. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>

<s> It may be possible that your computer connects to your routers DNS address. </s>
<s> When you plug into your cable modem you of course get a different DNS server. </s>
<s> Your router may not be updating but it should in time. </s>
<s> Your computer may also play a roll in that. </s>
<s> In the mean time you can manually edit your host file on your computer Your host file is located: C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc open the file HOSTS in notepad and make your changes. </s>

<s> I don't think that would fix the problem because I have tried directly accessing the IP address of the site and I encounter the same problem. </s>
