Thanks.. well I did get it to work and its perfect.. thank you for the help but now i realized new problems.
First is playing games or full screen applications.
How can I maybe temporarily disable the mouse and put it into a hotkey from going to the other screen?
That way i can play the game but when I want to move back to the other screen i enable the mouse to move there again so it can work.
Seeing as how many games need you to maybe turn around or scroll the map it becomes annoying with the mouse constantly moving to the other side.
Also how do i keep a full screen app from minimizing when something else is activated?
Thank you again!
