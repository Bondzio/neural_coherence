1. add a Wireless Access Point (WAP) to your current setup.
2. replace the old router with a wireless broadband router.
I prefer replacing the old router with a wireless router.
Makes life simpler and often is less expensive than a WAP.
Look at your local computer stores, electronics stores, and office supply stores for the major small office/home office brands (Linksys, D-Link, Netgear, Belkin).
