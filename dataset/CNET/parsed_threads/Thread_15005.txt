<s> I saw this question posted in 2004, so I thought I would ask it again. </s>
<s> I've been unemployed for too long and the current economny is crap. </s>
<s> I have heard form an instructor at a local community college that the A+ cert. </s>
<s> is going to dissapear soon. </s>
<s> The main question is, is the A+ cert still worth going after to get a job? </s>
<s> I've been playing with my own computer for years adding this or that hw thing. </s>
<s> The A+ Cert will not get you a job in this day and age. </s>
<s> If you already work in the computer IT field, employers will often require that you keep current certifications from CompTIA, Microsoft, etc. </s>
<s> at their expense. </s>
<s> In my opinion, getting a Bachelors or preferably a Masters degree will greatly increase your chances of employment as well as greatly increasing your salary. </s>
<s> Upon seeing ads or clips of those looking for IT people and/or techs, expect some hassles if not having some certificate. </s>
<s> More often or not, its a way for companies to weed out those that may have iffy experience and/or no track record. </s>
<s> However, experience can be used in lieu of certificates, but you may need to get whatever they require later. </s>
<s> Its also a way for business to say, they got certified people working here and provide a top notch service for those looking to use them. </s>
<s> However, the A+ certificate is the bottom rung of knowledge and it appears to be more of revenue source for colleges, etc.. </s>
<s> If it were to go away, it will be replaced by some other certification. </s>
<s> Having a degree offers more and may get you to be hired and then get whatever certificates they desire, but again, its different from co. to co.. FYI- When certificates weren't the normal when I had to take tests on my general knowledge and that too was a way to weed undesirables or less than they wanted. </s>
<s> I guess working on pacemakers or microtech requires certain skills that aerospace and/or computer repairs(before PCs), radios, military equipment just didn't share. </s>
<s> But, guess what I got hired by the 2nd co. </s>
<s> I interviewed with. </s>
<s> So go for what seems best for you. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
