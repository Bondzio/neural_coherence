<s> I have been noticing that whenever I disconnect from my WPA wireless network, my usb ports don't work. </s>
<s> Whenever I plug in my flash drives, my laptop is not able to see them. </s>
<s> Then, when I shut down, my laptop just hangs. </s>
<s> I use a Dell E1505 with Windows XP Media Center. </s>
<s> If the flash drive was already connected before I disconnect, I can still read them, but I cannot safely remove it. </s>
<s> I've encountered such things but only when the owner installed the OS. </s>
<s> Many forget to use Dell's other CDs with drivers and more. </s>

<s> Haven't had this trouble before. </s>
<s> Another cause was to accept a driver from Windows Update. </s>
<s> Fix? </s>
<s> Use Driver Rollback on that. </s>

<s> I have information: Now, I noticed that my usb ports are not working whenever I press Fn+F2 to deactivate my wireless. </s>
<s> My laptop can't see any flash drives I plug in after turning off the wireless. </s>
<s> The bluetooth manager also hangs. </s>
<s> Windows also freezes when shutting down. </s>
<s> Wireless internet works fine. </s>
<s> When I restart the machine, everything is back to normal (USB ports, bluetooth work again). </s>
<s> I don't know what's happening. </s>
<s> But below is a breakdown Let say I just turned on my laptop: 1. </s>
<s> With the Wireless off, the usb ports work perfectly fine. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> When I press Fn+F2 to activate the Wireless/bluetooth, usb ports still work fine. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> When I press Fn+F2 to turn off the wireless, usb ports don't work, and bluetooth also doesn't work. </s>
<s> In the Device Manager, if I press Fn+F2 to turn the wireless internet (Wi-Fi) on, under &quot;Universal Serial Bus Controllers&quot;, the Dell Wireless 350 Bluetooth internal Card will appear. </s>
<s> There should also be a sound as a sign that a new device installed/connected. </s>
<s> Then, when I press Fn+F2 to turn off the wireless internet, Dell Wireless 350 Bluetooth internal Card disappears from Device manager. </s>
<s> There should be also a sound that signals that a device is removed. </s>
<s> What happens is that the &quot;Dell Wireless 350 Bluetooth internal Card&quot; entry is not removed when I press Fn+F2 to turn off the Wi-Fi. </s>
<s> It is stuck there, and my usb ports are broken. </s>
<s> For now, as a temporary solution, I have disabled the &quot;Dell Wireless 350 Bluetooth Internal Card&quot; in the Device Manager. </s>
<s> Still haven't encountered the problem yet. </s>
