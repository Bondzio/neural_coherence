I am deciding between a desktop which is upgradable or a laptop which is portable. Now I am a home user however I want to be able to multi-task and be able to play the latest games. I was considering building a PC but I dont want to bother buying parts and what not. Can Someone Give me Some Ideas?

Hardware Wise - I would look for a Core 2 Duo/Quad, 3GB/4GB/8GB if you want to go all out (DDR2), HDD would be up to you, you would need to know what sort of space you are going to use, 1TB+ Should be fine.. And dont forget to make sure it comes with a keyboard, mouse and screen if you are not going to use your old ones. Posting links to computer you have spotted would be good aswell, I would be happy to look at them and give you my opinion.

Obviously, for gaming you want a higher end processor, better graphics card and more RAM if possible, so possibly.. http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8899766&type=product&id=1212192599038 - Quite expensive, but good aswell and http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=9168198&type=product&id=1218041998312
