&quot;i have not tried manually downloading the latest firmware&quot; that is one of the items covered in this forum's sticky.
and has helped many times.
but here's the deal.
why would we not use the ideas and methods that has worked so often?
and if we find it doesn't work why would would keep a cranky router?
