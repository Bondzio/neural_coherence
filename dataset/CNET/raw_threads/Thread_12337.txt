1668	0	143890	1611534	NR	UnWritten7	12/18/05 3:49 PM	1.13492094E12	Graphics Driver Stops Responding	My system specs are as follow:Antec Case, ABit IC7-G mother board, 500 watt Antec Power Supply, Radeon 9600XT graphics card, DVD drive, CDRW Drive, 1gig DDR2 Memory, 120gig hard drive, 19in ViewSonic LCD and Windows XP Home SP2. When I try playing Everquest 2 the computer freezes after a few moments and then pushes the game into a minimized window instead of full screen and says the Graphics Drivers have stopped working(or responding). I have downloaded and installed the newest drivers for the MB,Graphics Card, Sound, DirectX and my monitor. I also reduced the resolution from 1152x864 to 1024x768. Anything else I can do?

I have 1(intake),1(outtake),1(after market CPU fan/heatsink),1(after market chip set fan/heatsink) and one PCI fan that blows directly on the graphics card.

I o'c my x300se to 430mhz core clock and 450memory clock. And this is using a passive heatsink too. Roger

The fans do push air into the case but dont cool anything except the harddrive which is directly in front of the intake fan. That is why there is CPU, Graphics Card and Chipset fans.
