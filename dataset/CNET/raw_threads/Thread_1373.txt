I will never use it for more than 1 connection since it disconnect and kick you out sometime if you connection is not good and you'll need the 2nd logon to clear it out. if $$$ is not an issues, Citrix is the way to go.

If so, the problems is on your router or the IP address you use to connect from home. If you are not able to connect from the local network, check and see if both Terminal Service and TS licensing are running. (You should be running in Remote Administration Mode if you dont plan to purchase any licenses). Unless you have install 3rd party firwall on the server, otherwise, you don't need to open any port on the server to allow this connection.
