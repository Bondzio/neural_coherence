1.3.1	While I tend to agree , the fact is Apple owns the market for MP3 players .	St
1.3.2	My first player was a Dell DJ , and it was good , if not great MP3 player .	St
1.3.3	But if you want any versatility with from a player , the iPod is the only way to go because there are literally TONS of accessories available .	St
1.3.4	Although , the DJ is well represented in terms of accessories , most are only available on-line from Dell and a few other vendors .	St
1.3.5	But you can go to almost any type of store and find iPod accessories .	St
1.3.6	From docks to cases to car stereo integration to boom boxes , there appears to be no end to the options and versatility for the iPod .	St
1.3.7	Nothing beats having my music library with me at all times , whether that be in the car , while shopping at Sams , or while working out - all with the same player .	St
