It's pretty clear that you can't DMZ an entire network. That is, a machine in the DMZ would receive all incoming connections. So the usual network is behind a router and while a pool of IPs would let you take an IP and send incoming to that IP to a particular computer, that still fails to &quot;DMZ&quot; the entire network. At least that's clear to your beginning first year networker. With that out of the way, I can only suggest you chat with the folk you work with about your network. I must bow out since I think your goal is unclear. Bob
