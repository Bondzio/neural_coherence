1.1.1	Hi !	St
1.1.2	I 'm trying to build a different sub network using an adsl router/modem left from my old ISP .	St
1.1.3	( a Sagem F @ st 2604 ) I first connected the old adsl router with my new ISP gateway ( a Thomson TG784n ) on the same net 192.168.1.0/24 with a ethernet cable ( NOT cross-over ) connecting numbered Ethernet ports , ( DHCP and wi-fi off ) and all went ok ( 1 ) .	St
1.1.4	Now I 'm trying to put my PC and the old sagem F @ st 2604 on the 192.168.10.0/24 network , but I really do n't know how to configure the different Ethernet ports in the sagem modem/router , I fear that I wont be able to configure the Sagem to behave as a switch ( 2 ) .	St
1.1.5	( 1 ) I do n't know how this worked , but it did .	St
1.1.6	Can you give any light on this subject ?	Ques
1.1.7	( 2 ) Is it possible to configure the sagem F @ st 2604 to behave as a switch ?	Ques
1.2.1	2 .	St
1.2.2	Usually you just turn off any DHCP feature and viola , it 's a switch .	St
1.3.1	It & quot ; bridges & quot ; , but does not & quot ; switches & quot ; .	St
1.3.2	I will make another run , and try to reconfigure it , one more time .	St
1.3.3	Thanks	Polite
1.4.1	I thought we did n't connect it to the WAN/Modem port .	St
1.4.2	You only wanted the hub ports to work ?	Ques
1.4.3	Remember that I tend to use the networking lingo so when you ask me about a switch , I 'll include the non-switched hub as well unless you write more .	St
1.4.4	When we use these DSL modems for the switch , we would never use the WAN port .	St
1.4.5	That 's a given .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	Hi Bob I 'm only using LAN/Ethernet ports , at this moment I 'm able to assign a secundary IP ( 192.168.10.1/24 ) to them , and keep the old sagem f @ st with the 192.168.1.1/24 , but if I change my PC IP to 192.168.10.10/24 I can ping the sagem , but ca n't access the internet .	St
1.5.2	The only way that can access the internet is keeping my PC Ethernet port in the 192.168.1.0/24 sub-net .	St
1.5.3	I do n't know if this is a windows miss configuration or a bad router configuration .	St
1.5.4	My words and explanations , sometimes , may be lacking precision , that is because I 'm just starting in the network field ( studying ) .	St
1.5.5	For example , I 'm having a hard time to understand was does the option & quot ; Enable Ethernet M2U & quot ; Best regards Vasco	St
1.6.1	Is there any way to find out if this router as his 4 LAN ports working as a hub ?	Ques
1.7.1	So that 's very off in the place of weirdness .	St
1.7.2	All I 've ever had to do was to disable DHCP and bingo , it 's a hub .	St
1.7.3	Bob	St
1.8.1	ya !	St
1.8.2	it 's a hub .	St
1.8.3	No more to it .	St
1.8.4	Thanks Vasco	St
