<s> Three main questions. </s>
<s> 1) I'm upgrading some peripherals...drives, RAM, HD...how can I know how much power my system requires now and how much it will after the upgrades? </s>
<s> 2) I'm limited (very) in my CPU upgrade. </s>
<s> I have a P4 1.4GHz and specs allow for 1.8. </s>
<s> I came across some kits that state they can upgrade to higher processors (2.8) with the use of an adapter. </s>
<s> What are the benefits/problems of using such kits? </s>
<s> 3) Finally, again regarding my CPU, which is supposed to have a 400Hz BUS. </s>
<s> I recently ran a utility test and the results were that it was running at 100. </s>
<s> What can cause this difference? </s>
<s> If anyone can help with any of these I'd appreciate it. </s>
<s> To run at 400 MHz FSB you need DDRSDRAM [DDR 200]. </s>
<s> Are you sure what the 100 MHz report REALLY means. </s>
<s> The DDR 200 is actually 100 MHz memory that gets double clocked. </s>
<s> [=200], then gets quad clocked as the FSB from the MCH to the CPU [=400]. </s>
<s> Then, of course, the multiplier in the CPU multiplies that up to run the CPU at its rated speed. </s>
<s> What speed is the CPU reporting. </s>
<s> If you were not actually acheiving the 400 MHz FSB the CPU would be running less than 1.4 GHz. </s>
<s> I don't think that DDR came any less than 100 MHz, so think that it simply the reporting scheme being confusing. </s>
<s> Now there were some mobos that would take either SDRAM or DDRSDRAM [different physical sockets] and could not be mixed. </s>
<s> If perchance you are running with PC 100 SDRAM that would actually be only 100 MHz. </s>
<s> Many BIOSes will give the basic memory speed [100 MHz in this case] as the setting to get the 400 MHz FSB. </s>
<s> It varies by mobo/BIOSes. </s>
<s> Do you have the manual??? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> I guess I should've included this, but I'm running PC800 RDRAM in my system. </s>
<s> Because it was a custom order they left out several of the hardware manuals. </s>
<s> It's now that I'm upgrading some things that I've been looking into the specifics. </s>
<s> And your responce gave me an idea, so I found a new tool that showed my speed back at 400. </s>
<s> The one that was giving me 100 was from Compaq's (HP) site. </s>
<s> I contacted them as well, and by their lack of information and knowledge in their responce, I think that their tool was more of a basic preconfigured automated responce for standard prebuilt units (which carry the regular RAM like you mentioned). </s>
<s> Since mine was custom, it didn't fit the profile that was given. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> I agree with the other replys, that your reported 100mhz buss speed is not something to worry about. </s>
<s> It is a multiple of 400 , and 800, so you are probably doing just fine. </s>
<s> It does get doubled then quad pumped to the memory buss on most motherboards. </s>
<s> On the cpu upgrade, make sure you have enough power supply, 350 watt will be good. </s>
<s> 400 watt is even better if you want to overclock. </s>
<s> The newer processor will generate more heat, so be sure you have a good cooling fan and a well vented case. </s>
<s> Additional case fans are good if you have the space to add them. </s>
<s> They are cheap insurance against component failure. </s>
<s> No advice on the cpu adapter kits....use caution. </s>
