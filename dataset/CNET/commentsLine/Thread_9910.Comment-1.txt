hello all, im here looking for some really good help on building up a new desktop.
i just got an very old desktop that has basically nothing in it.
the hard drive only has 7gb max, 128mb of ram, i odnt think theres a sound card or w/e.
so yeah its pretty old and 'basic'.
i want to upgrade everything but really dont know where to start; should i start with the hard drive?
a new mobo, or start with ram?
i dont wanna dish out thousands of dollars, i just want something that decent for gaming and entertainment and doing shcool stuff.
so any simple help on where i should start would be great.
