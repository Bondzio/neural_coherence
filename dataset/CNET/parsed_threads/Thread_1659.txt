<s> Hi, I recently got a new router BTHomehub-1F10 and i cannot seem to connect to it with my main PC, i put up a WPA-PSK Encryption and i can connect with my iphone and my laptop, but for some reason i cannot with my PC. </s>
<s> I thought at first it might be because im using a belkin card, but i was able to connect to my neighbours who had netgear so that was not the problem. </s>
<s> When i try to connect i type in my encryption passphrase and it tries to connect but then it fails, doesnt say any reason w hy. </s>
<s> With my Iphone and Laptop i did not have a problem connecting to it. </s>
<s> Thank you Have a nice day </s>
<s> with an Ethernet cable first. </s>
<s> This well help narrow down the issue. </s>
