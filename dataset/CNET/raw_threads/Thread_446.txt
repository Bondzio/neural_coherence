Ok, I'm planning on buying a new computer to set up as my main base station (yes, I use all the technical words), and placing my older computer in my room. It's a custom built job, so if you need any specifications just let me know. But the problem is, that it is quite loud, and also the fan on the side has a nice flashing blue light. I'd like to be able to keep it on while I sleep, so I'd like it to be a lot less noisy. Would buying a new tower shell solve this problem? And are there certain towers known as more quiet as others? Or could this have nothing to do with the tower, and if so, what could the cause of the noise be? Thanks in advance.
