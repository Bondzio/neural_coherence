I have a dell XPS400, and need to upgrade my powers supply so I can run the new graphics card im getting which is a GeForce 9800GT.
Can anyone help me with this, not good when it comes to the inside of computers and have no idea what will work or not.
I was looking at the Silencer 500 Dell so far.
Don't know what other information is needed, let me know and ill get anything that will help.
