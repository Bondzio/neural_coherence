I'm buying a new rig soon.Considering an AMD Phenom II 1090 T with a gigabyte GA-790 XTA-UD4 board,and 8 gigs or ddr3 dual channel memory.Though I'm not a &quot;gamer&quot; I do however edit and compile a lot of dvd's in keeping up with my Grand Kids.I already have 2 EVGA GeForce 9500 GT video cards and just can't find a link to see if they are compatible with this rig.Really like to find out before I buy it.Anybody know where I can get that info?
