<s> I built our computer about five years ago so we are well past the time when it needs to be replaced. </s>
<s> I've been upgrading RAM and storage as we go, but we've reached the end of the road with this one. </s>
<s> I'm considering two different computers for purchase: one is a refurbished from buy.com, and one is a newer tower from Best Buy. </s>
<s> Regardless of which one I get I plan on installing a second hard drive (to separate the operating system from the data) which I'm guessing would void any warranty that comes with the machine. </s>
<s> So bear that in mind. </s>
<s> (related thread: http://forums.cnet.com/5208-4_102-0.html?threadID=388908%20 ) I don't do any gaming or video editing so we are looking at photos, music, streaming video, etc. </s>
<s> Gateway DX4822-01 (refurb) $399 </s>
<s> There are too many reasons even more so when we talk about video work. </s>
<s> Ok, the warranty is split into a few areas. </s>
<s> Yes you'll not get any warranty support for the OS. </s>
<s> It was not that good anyway as most questions end with &quot;restore the factory OS.&quot; But the hardware is still under warranty with something you must know going in. </s>
<s> They won't support you with a hardware issue unless you restore the factory load. </s>
<s> Some get upset about that but 'dems the rules'. </s>
<s> While the x4500 might be slammed by some, outside of games I find it a great solution. </s>
<s> My laptop with a 4500MHD connects to the HDTV with HDMI and plays HD content just fine. </s>
<s> And with your i3 you'll scream past my laptop's older C2D 2.0GHz CPU. </s>

<s> You mean return it to the state it was in when I purchased it? </s>
<s> Isn't it still void as I cracked the case can could have done anything when in there without them knowing? </s>
<s> I rarely see any company rule so harshly. </s>
<s> Given the nature of desktops and the need to clean them yearly how would we avoid opening the case. </s>
<s> Of course they would cover a non-stock setup. </s>
<s> But if you do this right you can return it to stock when needed. </s>
<s> Hard disks are so cheap that I could remove the supplied drive, slip in a new drive just for my use. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> They used to have those seals over the case side. </s>
<s> So ridiculous. </s>
<s> So it's really worth the extra $160? </s>
<s> I meant no one covers the non-stock machine. </s>
<s> The old pentium core unit is strictly a value item and nothing more. </s>
<s> How much do you value your time? </s>
<s> I guess I'm just shocked that there's $160 worth of value in the processor considering I'm going to void the warranty the minute I get home. </s>
<s> I wasn't expecting that. </s>
<s> Does anyone else agree? </s>
<s> Looking at benchmarks your one hour video render on the i3 should take longer than 1.5 hours (my bet is 2+ hours) on the dated dual core. </s>
<s> Yes, it's worth it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ... but I don't render video. </s>
<s> I might rip some DVD's so I have backups for my kids, but rendering video is not something I know how to do or am looking to learn. </s>
<s> ALL and I mean ALL dvd rippers I've seen render some of the DVD to get an idea of what to do with the DVD. </s>
<s> If you want to make a less than great upgrade to a value only box then do that. </s>
<s> At least someone warned you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I wasn't making the connection there. </s>
