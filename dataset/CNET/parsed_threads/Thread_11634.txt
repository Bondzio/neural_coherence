<s> Hello, My burner model is TSSTcorp CD/DVDW TS-L532A The computer is a Gateway 7510GX running Windows XP Home. </s>
<s> It burns CD-R/RW, DVD+-RW and DVD+DL However, as of late, I can only burn DVD discs, and not CD's, which lock up the burning software. </s>
<s> I've tried burning with Nero, CD Burner XP Pro, and Alcohol, all of which can burn DVD's fine but (now) not CD's, and I have burned CD's before. </s>
<s> The burn process starts, the light comes on and the drive spins, then after a minute or so the drive spins down and the software hangs (with Nero). </s>
<s> With CD Burner XP Pro/Alcohol an error message is spitted out (below). </s>
<s> I tried reinstalling the burner with no luck. </s>
<s> The error message listed by CD Burner XP Pro is: Writing Error: (3) Error occurred writing data to the disc. </s>
<s> The SCSI/ATAPI bus was reset and caused a write failure (1026). </s>
<s> Error Sense Data: SENSE KEY: 6 ASC: 29 ASCQ: 0 if that helps. </s>
<s> If you have any suggestions I appreciate it, thanks! </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Try it at 2x speed. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Try another recorder. </s>
<s> Good luck with this. </s>

<s> 1. </s>
<s> The CD Lens Cleaner had no effect. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I tried burning it slowly and it seems to have worked. </s>
<s> But what gives? </s>
<s> My burner is rated for top speed of 24x; and the discs 52x. </s>
<s> Why does it fail at higher speeds? </s>
<s> The laser dims with time... Bob </s>
<s> Oh okay, I didn't know that. </s>
<s> So I guess I'd have to buy a new burner? </s>
<s> Sometimes I'll change my burning software to lock in at the speed I find to work but let me share this. </s>
<s> For years I have recorded at 1/2 the media speed. </s>
<s> It takes not so much longer and I have none of the problems of people around me. </s>
<s> I wonder... Bob </s>
<s> Quite true! </s>
<s> Anyway, thanks for all your help! </s>
<s> Hey Guys, I have read briefly over the writings so far, and I have a very similar problem. </s>
<s> My TS-L632D will burn dvd's without a problem, it will read dvd's without a problem, it will even read CD's without a problem. </s>
<s> But when I burn a CD it burns like it should, it completes like it should, the light on the drive blinks like it should... but in the end... its just a blank CD... </s>
<s> I heard a piece of advice, I should burn at a lower speed, this I will try, but is there any advice that can be given? </s>
<s> other than that? </s>
<s> if that doesn't work then how else can I fix it? </s>
<s> also... if that does work, I don't want to burn at 2X from now on. </s>
<s> Alternatively I had a super-multi drive kickin' around so I've got it on my IDE to USB adapter and burn from it, but that's not a perfect solution either </s>
