you ram, motherboard, power supply unit and cpu all have to be compatible.
compatitbility comes in generations.
by slowly upgrading you would lose a lot of bang for your buck.
whilst just replacing would be an effective way to get a nice computer.
also please list any games you would actually want to play.
you can look up the recommended hardware for the game you want to play and keep those specs in mind when picking out parts.
