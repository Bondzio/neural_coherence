i recently got a 802.11g card for my laptop to use when i am traveling.
i plugged it into my computer and it detected to network and i was able to connect to it.
i was surprised since i did not purchase a router: so i'm mooching off someone else's network.
i live in an apartment in a densely populated area so i guess i shouldn't have been surprised.
when looking at the connection properties it says the connection is excellent and running at 11mbps; so whoever has the network is using .11b.
also under the properties it say the network name is &quot;default&quot;.
i already use zone alarm for my firewall but was wondering what i should do?
i have no idea whose network this is and now stable it will be.
is there a way to secure my computer further so the &quot;owner&quot; of the network can't see my information?
is there a way, besides going door to door, to find out whose network this is?
