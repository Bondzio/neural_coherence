it can't be the heat, it will crash 1 min after turning the computer on.
its been 4 days it hasn't rebooted on me, now it freezes the computer and the mouse until i reboot the computer.
games, doesn't matter cause it does it on windows xp and isn't related to games.
i am using spybot on every startup, if theres some it is removed.
i took all peices of hardware on the computer like my graphic card, ect .. out of my machine, cleaned the dust out of it and readded the cards also my ram stick was moved on a different slot on my mother board.
powered on the computer will log in and as soon as everything loads up, and i start to open stuff up it will freeze.
