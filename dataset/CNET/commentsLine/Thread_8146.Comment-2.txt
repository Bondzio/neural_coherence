i have found  free and paid editions to be much easier to use for connecting remotely.
the free edition is great.
when using a befvp41 and vpn, i opted to use a software vpn on a server in the other lan to get to network shares.
also, using two befvp41s to connect the two lans together all of the time works well.
good luck.
