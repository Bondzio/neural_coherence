Got most of the bugs worked out but having a problem with the microphone port. In short, cannot get any sound in from a microphone plugged into the port. Have verified the microphone is working, and that it is plugged into the correct port. Checked the device manager (Windows XP Pro), no hardware problems identified, drivers are all updated (VIA Audio), nothing muted... I'm at a loss, and he's frowning at me since I suggested the particular motherboard... Anyone got any ideas what to try to fix it? And, if it is a non-fixable problem, any alternates so that he can use a microphone with his system? Rich

I've made the assumption you know how to use what OS and software to enable that input, what applications would use the input and that the BIOS has the onboard sound enabled. You shouldn't fret too much over it since it's a warranty issue. If you don't take them to task over the warranty for your own reasons, then consider a sound card like http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=L-8738-6C is 9.95. There's even cheaper cards, but avoid the Aureal cards since the company is defunct and no drivers will ever appear. Bob
