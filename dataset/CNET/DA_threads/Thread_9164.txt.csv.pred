1.1.1	Hello, We have a internal network with 4 pc's connected to our university network.	St
1.1.2	We are going to do a lot of video and we need a lot of bandwith, we want to make our 4 pc network use 1Gig ethernet to share video files faster but want to avoid having to go outside our network and use the university resources.	St
1.1.3	Can regular switches recognise the 4 pc network and avoid going outside and send it straight between those pc and only going outside to surf the internet or whatever???	Sug
1.1.4	These must be done usually with a programmable switch but someone told me nowdays regular switches are able to do this.	St
1.1.5	Is it true?	St
1.1.6	How can it be done?	St
1.1.7	If it is, but basic models could I get?	St
1.1.8	If not what programmable switch which is cheap could I get?	St
1.1.9	By the way we'll be using (an can only use) windows XP, no Linux...;-( Thanks	St
1.2.1	internet -&gt; wifi router -&gt; 1GB switched hub -&gt; PCs.	St
1.2.2	Done.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	So a regular (not programmable, then much cheaper) 1G switch will not send the files outside our local network through the university resources?	St
1.3.2	It would take care of it internally???	St
1.3.3	By the way we wont be using wireless, all cable.	St
1.3.4	Thanks	Polite

1.5.1	A Gigabit router would do what you want.	St
1.5.2	But let me share something about Gigabit LANs.	St
1.5.3	You will NOT get Gigabit speed.	St
1.5.4	No hard drive made will read/write at that speed.	St
1.5.5	My Gigabit network running two IBM ThinkCenter 3 GHz processors with Gigabit and my home built 2 GHz processor with Gigabit runs on average 250-350 Mb/s speed.	St
1.5.6	Faster than my old 10/100 LAN, but nowhere near 1000 Mb/s speed.	St
1.5.7	If the above speed meets your needs then just get a Gigabit router.	St
1.5.8	Wayne Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about analog and digital data, Internet connections, Spyware removal, and download free software.	St
1.5.9	Loud pipes, Longknecks, Loose women - Texas	St
1.6.1	Can anybody specify brands and models?	Ques
1.6.2	So is clear that I dont need a programmable switch, a regular giga switch will do it, right?	Ques
1.6.3	Why not a giga switch (seems cheaper) thatn a Giga router?	St
1.6.4	What benefits do I get getting a Giga router, I just want to be able to send big video files across the small pc network, is it worth it?	St
1.6.5	Thanks.	St
1.7.1	Hello, I going to buy a 3COM SWITCH OFFICE CONNECT 8XRJ45 10/100/1000 GIGABIT,AUTOSENSING, AUTO MDI/MDIX.	St
1.7.2	Will this do wha I want?	St
1.8.1	http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1162354643512&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper&lid=4351213196B04 Excellent router.	St
1.8.2	Wireless if you need it in the future.	St
1.8.3	It also has what's called &quot;Storage Link&quot;.	St
1.8.4	A USB-2 port where you can connect a USB-2 hard drive.	St
1.8.5	Use it as storage, it shows up in your network as a shared network drive.	St
1.8.6	Pick your size.	St
1.8.7	I have an 80 Gig hard drive I use for &quot;stuff&quot;.	St
1.9.1	It looks impressive and expensive...anyhow does anyone know if the one I'm willing to buy will do what I'm asking...I dont have option to buy what your recomend, since I have to buy it for the university dealer and thats the option they have give me.	Sug
1.9.2	Thanks?	St
1.10.1	All I did was add the switched hub at the end...	St
1.10.2	I didn't answer directly what a switched hub is since that would duplicate fine content at Wikipedia or what you can find at google.com but it is the answer.	St
1.10.3	I prefer the switched hub outside the router since I've found some switches in routers to be poor performers.	St
1.10.4	You want cheap?	St
1.10.5	Try http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=CGS-800E-DT&cat=NET and the other Netgear, Dlink, Linksys equivilents.	St
1.10.6	Bob	St
1.11.1	I'll be getting the 3COM SWITCH OFFICE CONNECT because is what the store has, cant buy from the internet because university rules.	St
1.11.2	So I hope it works...I was on a tight deadline so I had to get something real quick the thing is at the store the could not answer my question?	St
1.11.3	That's why I tried here, so lets see what happens.	St
1.11.4	Thanks	Polite
