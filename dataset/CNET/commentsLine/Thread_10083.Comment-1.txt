i am planning on buying a new desktop with the following: amd 64 3400+ 1 gb memory 200 gb hard light scribe dvd+/-r/rw is there any major difference between the compaq sr1010z and the hp a850e?
if so what might they be?
when both systems have virtually the same stuff the compaq is over $100 dollars cheaper.
does the hp label on the tower really cost this much or is the hp built better?
