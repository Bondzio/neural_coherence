1.1.1	i recently purchased a few brand new TDK 8x dvd+r i have a lite-on 1693s brand new 16x burner when i go to nero 6 express i was unable to selected 4x write speed .	St
1.1.2	i know 8x dvds should be burnt at half the speed , but nero 6 only allow me to selected 6x speed minimum .	St
1.1.3	i had no choice , so i burnt the disc anyway , but after the burn was complete , the drive was able to read it , i edject it out and load it back in , the drive makes alot of clicking noises , the dvds can not be read .	St
1.1.4	is there anyway for me to force my drive to burn at 4x ?	Ques
1.1.5	please help me , please help me i beg you please HELP !	Ques
1.2.1	The old theory about burning media at 4x speed is for reliabilty .	St
1.2.2	Burning at 8x transfers huge amounts of data quickly form one media to another , and can lead more often to errors in the burn process , or corruption of data .	St
1.2.3	It 's easier to burn data more successfully and slower at 4x , than try repeatedly and fail a few times at 8x ... .but things move on .	St
1.2.4	If the media says 8x , and your drive has 8x ... burn at 8x .	St
1.2.5	Just because earliest 8x media and drives were n't up to the task , does n't mean that is always , or still , the case .	St
1.2.6	The problem here does n't appear to be the speed at all .	St
1.2.7	As you successfully recorded and read the the disk at 6x , ( see that old & quot ; 8x at 4x & quot ; plan is now a myth !	St
1.2.8	) , the problem is something related to reading the disk AFTER you ejected .	St
1.2.9	Make sure when you record disks that & quot ; Enable multisession & quot ; is not selected ( press the & quot ; More & quot ; button for some hidden options ) , and that & quot ; Finalize Disk & quot ; is on .	St
1.2.10	Multisession disks are those without an end point , but these tend to be written and read perfectly in the drive that made them .	St
1.2.11	What is odd is that you can record , and read , but then ca n't read after ejecting .	St
1.2.12	Best to buy some re-writable DVD 's and experiment , and remember not all media and drives are compatible .	St
1.2.13	Do a search , and see if others are having the same problem .	St
1.2.14	Google 'd : lite-on 1693 problems ( returned some that might be of use to you ) Good luck , GeeBee	St
1.3.1	for me is CD only .	St
1.3.2	DVDs all run at max speed as determined by Nero on auto .	St
1.3.3	Never had a problem .	St
1.3.4	Even K3b in Linux runs eveything on auto with no problems .	St
1.3.5	The issue seems to be an XP and CD issue .	St
1.3.6	That being said , you should be able to choose any speed below maximum of media .	St
1.3.7	chuck	St
