do you think it is my machine?
or an incomplete windows installation?
both machines are dell computers.
the win2k machine i reformatted the disk and installed win 2k.
the winxp machine is new from dell, dell did the install.
i used the micrsoft drivers that windows suggested to pull down from the web.
was that a mistake?
i'm happy to give more information if it helps; i would just like to diagnose the problem, but i am unable to myself.
