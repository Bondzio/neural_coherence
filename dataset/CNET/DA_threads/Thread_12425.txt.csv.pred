1.1.1	Maybe a dumb question , but is there an easy way to determine the rating of my Power Supply ?	Ques
1.1.2	I 've looked all over the thing , looked up serial numbers , etc. , and have n't found anything .	St
1.1.3	I think it is just generic .	St
1.1.4	But is there software that can determine the rating ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	Look at the side of the supply for a stick like this - & gt ; http : //www6.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/images/aerocool_packing.jpg Bob	St
1.3.1	my sticker did n't quite look like that , but by comparing it with that link you posted , i could figure it out .	St
1.3.2	thanks again !	Polite
1.4.1	There are no stickers/decals/model numbers on the power supply ?	Ques
1.4.2	Were you able to hold it in your hand and turn it around ?	Ques
1.4.3	If not , the decal may not be seen on some models while mounted .	St
1.4.4	If none is found , that does n't pass the UL provided rating it requires for use in the USA .	St
1.4.5	Please inform ... tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	Gee Bob , I was interested , and for the life of me could not get the reference link to come up for some time and wondering how Lambo got it to come up .	St
1.5.2	Could get these : http : //www6.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/images/aerocool420_full.jpg http : //www6.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/images/aerocool420_switch.jpg But not your indicated link : http : //www6.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/images/aerocool_packing.jpg I finally eliminated the 6 in www and walla : http : //www.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/images/aerocool_packing.jpg The image goes with this article : http : //www.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/power_supplies-01.html	St

1.7.1	to see a system that does n't pass the UL ( if it 's in the US , if your not in the US idk then ) after you find the rating , you should know what some of the figures mean , as wattage is n't all that matters the two thigns you want to look at ( 3 really , but the third is a bit of an after thought ) 1 ) Total Wattage , 400W is good , 500W for high performance systems ( it 's due to the high draw by graphics cards and CPU 's ) 2 ) the amperage on the 12v rail , or rails , it should be over 24A for a modern system ( AthlonXP 's and old Pentium 4 ( Willamette only ) can sag lower , 18A works fine on my AthlonXP , and willamette only needs 10A to 12A ( Intel spec ) but i 'd suggest 16 to be safe ALSO the brand matters , if it 's a crap unit than those figures are at 25C , which i doubt your computer is at , as the heat rises it loses efficiency BUT high end units ( like PC Power & Cooling ) are rated at 50C , which means they are highly efficient	St
1.8.1	Practically any p/s unit should have some decal/sticker on it or several .	St
1.8.2	What they all mean in the long term is the p/s is suppose to be able to do what it rated to do and in a safe matter .	St
1.8.3	Fonding one w/o any sticker/decal or one so simple , should be thought of as either dang cheap or a & quot ; dump & quot ; of parts from whatever source .	St
1.8.4	Any maker not willing to ID themselves or seemily so , should n't be trusted as well as thier devices/items .	St
1.8.5	Users have enough problems w/o starting from the git , with less than std .	St
1.8.6	parts .	St
1.8.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
