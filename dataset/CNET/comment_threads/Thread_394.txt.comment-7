hey there well it took me a while to figure out that while I had to not type the &quot;exe&quot; file extension on a&gt;awdflash, I DID have to type the &quot;.bin&quot; extension on the new bios filename.
I am UP and RUNNING -- AND it is recognizing the 40 gb drive now!
hooray!
How big of a drive can this Soyo 6ba+ mobo recognize now with the bios update ya spose?
