<s> Hi, I have a Dell Dimension 4700 that has all stock parts and Windows Xp Home Edition 32Bit. </s>
<s> It is a mid tower case and I am looking to upgrade it as I want to play newer games without getting another computer. </s>
<s> I was wondering if someone could help me pick out certain parts for it that are both compatible with it and will fit in my case. </s>
<s> I am looking to upgrade the Power supply to at least 500 watts, get a new motherboard that supports intel core 2 duo, 4 expansion slots for memory and can support pci express x16 and 2.0. </s>
<s> Also I want to get a good cpu that can either be overclocked or that is good for gaming (Crysis). </s>
<s> I know im asking for a lot but i am new to the whole upgrading thing. </s>
<s> The operating system from Dell could be locked to the old board so budget for a new OS as well. </s>
<s> The video card list I use is at http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/graphics-cards,1942.html Bob </s>
<s> Basically, you're upgrading everything but the case, so really what are you saving to re-use? </s>
<s> Effectively, just get a DIY setup and proceed. </s>
<s> If you plan to keep the OEM XP-OS, most just won't work outside of they're original system. </s>
<s> So, look at eMachine or similar for details of basic newer system and go from there. </s>
<s> Gamer websites should provide what really works for any particular games. </s>
<s> Basic &quot;bare bones&quot; system that have a mtrbd, cpu and some ram but nothing else are also out there, check online vendors like Geeks, NewEgg and TigerDirect for such, but there are lots out there. </s>
<s> Take my advice don't skimp on a decent psu, besides wattage and cooling for same. </s>
