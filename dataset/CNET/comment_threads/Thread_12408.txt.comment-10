Bob, I have been thinking(not good) My Old Windows &quot;ME&quot; that the 3970 scaner worked with.
The last time I tried to use it would not power up, any way to get the power start?
I know, but I can use the scanner :)I'm trying to get pictures from some slides with out sending the slide off for a week or two.
