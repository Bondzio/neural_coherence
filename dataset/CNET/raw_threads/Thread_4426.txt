I am thinking of getting a new Mac Will this create a nightmare?? Will the new Blue tooth technology in the Mac recognise router?? OR can I connect the router to the mac and have the other 2 PC connect to it thru the wireless card???

I can open them to add memory, hard drives, and various cards, But I know nothing about Mac's But, I guess when Apples says &quot;Right out of the box&quot; it could be so. I just thought it was too good to be true.
