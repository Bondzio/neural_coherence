you haven't told us much about that hp system that interests you, but i'm going to assume that the &quot;integrated graphics&quot; you are talking about comes in the form of the intel q57 express chipset that of late is being put on motherboards intended for use with core i3 and i5 processors.
256k video memory, shared at that, is not really all that much - at all.
the serious gamer cards lately come with 1-2gb of specialized graphics-oriented silicon onboard (&quot;gddrx&quot;), but will also cost you typically $100-400 extra, with exceptions on either end of that range.
all reviews i have seen say the newest intel integrated graphics will play blu-ray just fine, but only fairly rudimentary games; but also in fairness that intel never claims it'll do more than that.
using integrated graphics for mostly playback entertainment should be fine.
but if you want to play any kind of graphics-demanding game, you'd better figure on an add-on graphics card.
and unless they are the most demanding games, you should be able to get a very respectable card for under $200.
you just have to be clear with yourself about what you really want to do with the box, and be prepared to pay for whatever that is.
i recently bought a very current nvdia 220-based card with 1bg onboard for $65 which handles middle-of-the-road graphics demands pretty well, so the extra card doesn't have to break the bank.
if you've not looked in a while, prices for graphics cards are down significantly in terms of bang for the buck.
just be clear about what you want from your system, and keep in mind that you can always add one in later if the rest of your system can handle the extra demands of higher-end gaming - it's not just the card that matters.
