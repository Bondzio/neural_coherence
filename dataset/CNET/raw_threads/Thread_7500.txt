I am setting up a wireless network, but I will not be on-site most of the time. I want to use MAC address filtering, but I want to be able to filter MAC addresses remotely. I have the Microsoft g-router, and it doesn't support logging in remotely. Does anyone know of a wireless g-router that supports remote administration? Thanks
