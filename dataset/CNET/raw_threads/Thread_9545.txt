Im currently using the onboard video that is sharing 32mb of my RAM. I just purchased 1gig of extra RAM and an APG 8x video card that is to be installed this week. I was just wondering the benefit I would get, if any, of overclocking. In my CMOS the clock speed is set @ 166mhz. Is this where I would overclock it? If so how much would be &quot;safe&quot;?

But you need to study up on your computer and see what you should expect out of your hardware. Although there is a great benefit from overclocking, at the same time there is a risk of damaging your hardware if not done properly. Good Luck!!!

Now, you want faster games, right? Then mainly focus on overclocking your GPU, which is much more simpler and will give you the larger benefit. Bumping the CPU will help some, as it is a probable bottleneck, but do the GPU first. If it isn't what you are looking for, try the CPU. But please, don't just go into the BIOS and start changing settings. Please read the *many* guides on the internet. They'll show you how in a few minutes. ~Ibrahim~
