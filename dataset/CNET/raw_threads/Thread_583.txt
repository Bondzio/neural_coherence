My primary use is for viewing and editing photos using Photoshop. I plan on upgrading to the most current edition of Photoshop along with the purchase of the desktop. I won't be upgrading my monitor. Could you make some recomendations as far as system requirements to help me select a system?

I am using Photoshop CS2 and that combination seems to work great. After I bought the computer I added the 2nd gig of ram and a 256mg video card and did see better performance. I also do video editing through the firewire port and so far nothing seems to slow it down. The graphics forum on CNET has a lot of good information so you might check there.

If you are looking for a system with good performance you should be able to find multiple choices for around $500-600 that would come with the complete system, a 19&quot; flat panel monitor, and a basic printer. I would start with the major OEMs such as Dell, HP/Compaq, or Sony and see what you can configure as your best price. Don't hesitate to call them and see if they can improve the deal as well - they often have unadvertised specials and incentives that can get you a great system at a great price. If you are looking for something specific or a certain brand and would like some more help or have other questions post back and I'll see what I can do.
