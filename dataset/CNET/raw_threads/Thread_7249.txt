It won't connect unless I reboot the router while my laptop is up and running. If the connection is interrupted for any reason, including turning off or hibernating the laptop, I can't get back on unless I unplug the router and plug it back in again. Two other computers on the network, 1 XP and 1 Vista, have no trouble establishing connection at all. Has anyone heard of this problem before, and if so, how do I fix it?

That is, do you feel that a member should post no details, get asked, then begin or should the member go ahead and share the details and skip the first round? In closing, did you try turning off Vista's Broadcast Flag? And if you want a direct link, I'm going to bow out. That flag on vista is widely discussed and quite a pain. In closing, why dig up an old thread when you have a new issue? Bob

If so, please tell the forum that so folk know what your discussion is about. About me hyperlinking. Unlike some forums some moderators tend to teach how to find things. That can upset those that want tech support. This is all volunteer so the sooner you learn to use the forum and do the basic searches the less you need support. Bob
