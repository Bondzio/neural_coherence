<s> Can any one guide me to see what software conflicts can occure and is there any way to solve the problem wihout reinstalling the os? </s>
<s> Any help will be welcom Assaf </s>
<s> In a notebook, it matters that the OS is known (you didn't tell) and who installed the OS (unknown.) </s>
<s> I'll share one possible fix and not dive into driver discussions until you tell more. </s>
<s> -&gt; Look up WINSOCKXPFIX on google.com to repair the usual spyware induced damaged networking that causes a lot of posts like yours. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
<s> Thank you Bob, The os Win xp Pro service pack2 with all the updates installed. </s>
<s> I am sure this is a software problem. </s>
<s> But I verified with spybot, microsoft anti spyware and some other anti spy ware as well. </s>
<s> I am currently testing WinSock XP Fix. </s>
<s> Could a device can be unrecognize due to this kind of a bug? </s>
<s> I will post again if that won't solve the problem. </s>
<s> Thank you Assaf OS: Windows XP Service pack 2 </s>
<s> It's rare to see this installed by the owner proper. </s>
<s> They expected that XP would find all the drivers. </s>
<s> Sadly we have to check with the laptop maker for BIOS udpates, motherboard drivers and maybe patches. </s>
<s> Windows Update and the mysterious Driver Update button will not do this for us. </s>
<s> My bet is the OS install is incomplete. </s>
<s> As to WINSOCKXPFIX, yes, the spyware/malware is causing such damage. </s>

<s> This may not apply to your problem, but this solved my similar problem: http://www.linksysinfo.org/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&p=34236#34236 </s>
<s> Thank you I will try it later today, Currently I wiped all old information and nothing helped Should I run the win xp repair problem ? </s>
<s> I tried it didn't helped it. </s>
<s> I am confuse, I wipe any info related from the registry and still it is not recognise. </s>
<s> 10x Assaf </s>
<s> This is exactly how I fixed my problem: Uninstall the driver for WPC54G (from the Device Manager). </s>
<s> Download the latest driver from Linksys.com, it will be in a &quot;zipped&quot; (compressed) folder. </s>
<s> After extracting the uncompressed folder, just run the &quot;Setup.exe&quot; file. </s>
<s> If you have other versions of the Linksys wireless utility software, it will instruct you to remove that program first. </s>
<s> If this does not fix your problem, then you can try Windows Repair problem. </s>
<s> The problem with Windows is that it sometimes installs a bad driver, if you allow it. </s>
