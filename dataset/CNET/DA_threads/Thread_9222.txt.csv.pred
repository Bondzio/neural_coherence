1.1.1	Hi i have a 250 Gb external hard drive.In my computer windows xp sp2 reports : - & quot ; file system fat32 , free space 56.2 Gb , total size 232 Gb & quot ; .	St
1.1.2	However when i try to copy a 4.29 Gb .iso file to external hd i get an error message saying there is not enough disk space .	St
1.1.3	Any help much appreciated and thanks in advance .	Polite
1.1.4	p.s merry xmas	St
1.2.1	FAT32 has a maximum file size limitation .	St
1.2.2	Here 's the wikipedia on it so I 'll not write further why .	St
1.2.3	See & quot ; Max File Size & quot ; at http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table Next I want to share that USB drives with FAT32 volumes are showing up in piles because of complaints of file loss or total wipeouts .	St
1.2.4	FAT32 while good for exchanging from MAC to PC and back is not robust .	St
1.2.5	I strongly suggest you convert it to NTFS if you want those files to stick around .	Sug
