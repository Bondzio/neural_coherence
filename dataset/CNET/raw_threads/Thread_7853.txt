7616	0	234238	2407363	NR	mt64ed	2/17/07 3:42 PM	1.17172692E12	Vista Ethernet Connection	I am having massive trouble connecting my new Windows Vista laptop to my ethernet LAN. I can connect to the internet fine on all machines, but I cannot see any files on the Vista system from the others or vice-versa. I'm using a Belkin F5D7633 modem-router, a Win XP desktop, a Win 98 desktop, and a new hp laptop with Vista loaded. It could be a range of things. But one simple question is: What does it mean when you cannot get a response when pinging the same machine? My Vista system gets an answer back from the router and the Win98 PC, but not itself. Thanks, mt64ed

I have set these up properly as far as I know. I log on to all machines with the same user and password. Thanks

The Vista Network and Sharing Center kept sending me to Windows Firewall settings, but there also is the Norton (*$?%) firewall in which I found 'File Sharing' blocked. Turning that off made it OK at least for the wireless connection to the LAN, and I assume this also works for the ethernet connection. I still have a username and password problem to my Win98 system, but I'm getting closer. Being able to see the folders is much more satisfying. Thank you
