<s> Hi, I know it's a question being asked over and over, but I'm stumped as to what to get. </s>
<s> I need a new desktop. </s>
<s> I use some graphics packages and applications like dreamweaver. </s>
<s> But nothing too hungry. </s>
<s> I mainly use web apps to run my business and 'surf'. </s>
<s> I use spreadsheets etc. </s>
<s> I like to work fast (like everyone) so I'd like a PC with some uuummffff, even if it's just half a dozen browser windows open etc. </s>
<s> I'm not sure whether to stick with XP pro or move onto Vista. </s>
<s> My laptop is Vista and I have had no problems so far. </s>
<s> I don't think any apps I'll be using rely on XP, as I use mainly web based apps. </s>
<s> So that isn't an issue. </s>
<s> I'm also torn between getting another Dell or trying HP. </s>
<s> I've always used Dell... </s>
<s> I'd really appreciate any input into the spec I should look for (or avoid), with regards to processor (Dual core?) </s>
<s> and memory (I was looking at 4GB my current machine is 2GB and I'd like to move up!). </s>
<s> I use dal monitors and need a hardrive setup I can rely on (I'd like to have two drives mirrored). </s>
<s> Any and all advise appreciated. </s>
<s> The P-4 3 GHz with HT (dual core) are fast. </s>
<s> For your type of use these are perfect. </s>
<s> My current two have the P4 3 GHz HT processors and a Gig of ram, with the Gigabit LAN. </s>

<s> More than two is overkill and will not be used by 99.99% of all applications including XP. </s>
<s> Two Gig is all that is needed. </s>
<s> Trust me here. </s>
<s> Unless you want bragging rights. </s>
