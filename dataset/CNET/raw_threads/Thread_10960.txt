That being said, I have two computers, A and B, with A being wired to my router and B being wireless. A is running XP Pro and B is running XP Media Center. I am also running a program called Network Magic that helps in sharing folders and such. Computer A has a folder containing all of my mp3 files that I would like to put on computer B, and I set it up to be shared using Network Magic. When I open up the program, I can open the folder, but I can not play any of the files contained in the folder, and I can not drag them to a folder on computer B, nor can I copy and paste them to the folder on computer B. When I attempt to, I get an error saying &quot;Cannot copy &lt;Filename&gt; Access is Denied. Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected and that the file is not currently in use.&quot; Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do on how to get these files from Computer A to Computer B. Sorry for the lengthy description, and again thank you for your time.

Do you have an account called &quot;Johnny&quot; on computer B and did you set the permissions on the files to allow Johnny to read them? That's 2 things you need to accomplish. 2. Another downright nutty thing that kills some is that after they get the accounts correct it still doesn't work. What I found is Windows doesn't retroactively give Johnny access to the share. I have to remove the share, recreate it after I created Johnny's account. After this, Johnny can read. Bob
