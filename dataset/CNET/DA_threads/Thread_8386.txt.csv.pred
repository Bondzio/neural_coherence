1.1.1	I have an APC Battery backup its model is a 350 ES ( says apc 's website .	St
1.1.2	the sticker on the back says BE350U ) .	St
1.1.3	I recently found it in my uncle 's attic and he said it had n't been used in years and he did n't know the condition of the battery .	St
1.1.4	Sure enough , the last power outage the battery lasted for about 10 seconds and died .	St
1.1.5	Now i want to know if it would be better if I got a new battery for this UPS or if i got a new ( maybe better ) ups .	St
1.1.6	The only things connected to the battery part are my monitor and tower .	St
1.1.7	I think what caused the battery to die so fast was that my computer has 2 HD 's 2 cd drives and 4 fans w/LED 's .	St
1.1.8	Everything connected to it is outlet powered , except the mouse , kbd , webcam and joystick .	St
1.1.9	Its a AMD Sempron 2600 if thats relevent at all .	St
1.1.10	My monitor is a compaq 7500 CRT , but i 'm planning to upgrade to a 20in LCD HDTV that i 've already picked out .	St
1.1.11	Should i get a new battery , and if so , what kind ?	Ques
1.1.12	Or should i just get a new , better UPS ?	Ques
1.1.13	Help is MUCH appreciated .	St
1.2.1	If the UPS model is yrs .	St
1.2.2	old , then think that any battery ( s ) replacement is going to cost and maybe better spend on a new UPS .	St
1.2.3	As batteries age and do get used , the uptime for safe shutdown is reduced plus any added devices attached , the time is further reduced .	St
1.2.4	Check with APC for the specs on that model and determine what the time frames for devices attached is the uptime given .	St
1.2.5	Weight these factors and go from there .	St
1.2.6	Better UPS do provide basic surge protection , so if it got & quot ; hit & quot ; expect a lessen or defeated surge protection and a only a new UPS will do after that .	St
1.2.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	It 's an easy cost analysis .	St
1.3.2	What does the battery cost and what is a new unit ?	Ques
