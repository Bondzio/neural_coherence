<s> I have WPA-PSK enabled on my Netgear wireless setup, with access limited by MAC address. </s>
<s> Suddenly I have a MAC address showing up as an attached device which is not on my Wireless Card Access List. </s>
<s> How do I find out who/what this is, and how do I block access? </s>
<s> Unplug ETHERNET connections and reboot said router, clear that list and check again. </s>
<s> One friend fretted long and hard and it turned out to be a device on the wire. </s>
<s> That cleared everything off the network except me. </s>
<s> How did your friend come to decide it was &quot;a device on the wire&quot; as opposed to an outside/uninvited user? </s>
<s> Plugged in one ethernet plug at a time and watched the screen. </s>
<s> I showed him where the MAC number was on one device and he was able to figure it out from there. </s>
