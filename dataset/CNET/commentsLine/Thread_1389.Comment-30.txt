your computer is fine all you need to do is upgrade the hard drive.
you have several options, you can choose from a: get an internal hard drive, the limitation on this is you cannot take it with you.
b: get an exteranl and be able to take it with you.
sounds to me like the computer tech was trying to make some money off of you.
a 160gb hard drive will store alot of media that should be plenty.
one thing to keep in mind is the price on drives you will probably spend more on an external than you will on an internal.
