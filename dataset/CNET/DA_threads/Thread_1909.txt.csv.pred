1.1.1	Dell Dimension L668r 127RAM, WIn 98 2nd, DSL I wanted to upgrade my computer's memory and got a Crucial MT200314 memory addition.	St
1.1.2	It is not the one recommended for my DEll but it looks exactly the same as the listed one.	St
1.1.3	My question- if it fits perfectly, will it work?	St
1.1.4	Thanks, Bob	St
1.2.1	Just because it looks the same, internally it may be different.	St
1.2.2	You cannot just pick up a RAM stick and expect it to work.	St
1.2.3	It must be matched to the system board, clock, BIOS, existing RAM, etc.	St
1.2.4	Go to crucial.com and use the Wizard.	St
