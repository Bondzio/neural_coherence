What equipment would we have to have to accept the signal. Would a simple router do or do we need something special. Our house isn't set up for any cable or dsl.

I'm not a lawyer, but others have pointed out that this arrangement may test the limits of legality. But then, who travels 65mph?

Intentionally sharing with a neighbor (if discovered) would be a contract violation, and could result in termination of service. Of course, if the neighbor were tapping in without my permission, I should be off the hook. But then in Florida, some parts of Calif., and possibly in some other areas, he could then be charged with theft of services. So, it all depends -- Frank
