The company sounds interesting but I could not find any information about proportional LCD monitors which they produce or that are out on the market somewhere.
Perhaps they produce them but they are still experimental and/or too expensive.
It still seems odd to me that the new LCDs are wider but not taller.
Even when I am told that it is less expensive to produce such monitors as bigger monitors, it is hard for me to understand why that is.
Obviously the process of producing LCD panels can adjust the height of the panels as the manufacturer sees fit in order to produce a line of monitors of a different height.
Producing panels of the same height for every monitor and then distinguishing them by cutting different widths seems only theoretically less costly than producing different panels distinguished by different heights and then adjusting the width of a specific height for different LCD displays.
