I heard before that if you add any more memory over 1gig it will not improve performance e.g. games. and that it is usually used for servers. would going from 1 gig to 2 gig make a difference in games like doom 3 hl2 bfv and rtcw:et?

12035	2	104899	1202312	1201070	simonxliu	5/21/05 3:30 PM	1.1166894E12	yeah	Currently 2gbs is useless for gaming. But your money would be best spent on other parts. What parts do you have now?

As was mentioned, over one Gig is overkill unless you're producing, ripping, converting, and burning DVDs. Maybe your monitor is not up to the task. Most people never consider upgrading the monitor. If the pitch is .28 or above, a Terabyte of ram won't help. How about your graphic card? A bare bones card is the easiest to replace, and with a good monitor the results can be spectacular. Just some thoughts.

On an amd processor (which is much faster than an intel on nearly all games in existance) they benefit from lower latencies. Fortunately if you have 2gbs on an amd you will not have any lower performance. An athlon 64 processor has such a high bus speed (thanks to hyperthreading) that it would take many sticks of ram to for it to bottleneck your ram. For example the FX-55 has a clock speed of 2.6GHz, the bus speed would also be 2.6GHz. Perhaps you would also be thinking of a new video card?

Even though it's the second slowest P4 it's more than adequate in today's world. Once again we are accustomed to the American ideal that more is better! But its not. Even Intel has realized that now.

12035	11	104899	1203514	1203145	simonxliu	5/22/05 1:37 PM	1.11676902E12	ummm ok.....	Did i say everything? No. Anyway you cant always look at the clock speeds, a 2.6 ghz athlon 64 will give you more frames per second than a 3.8ghz pentium 4. Athlon 64s also run much cooler and quieter.
12035	12	104899	1203557	1203514	AKonny47	5/22/05 2:05 PM	1.1167707E12	woww	sry but heat isnt an issue for me. BTX case and mobo = 2 120mm fans. anyway, i can always upgrade my cpu to a faster p4 with the new 64 bit support. it just is useless now
