i know i am triple posting but i can't see any sort of edit button.
maybe a mod can merge all these posts?
please d: anyway, i hazarded opening up my computer... carefully... and discovered that my power supply is 300 watts.
i think my cpu uses about 105 watts, so that should leave me with the option of a graphics card of 150 watts or so?
with 50 watts left over for safety.
what would you recommend?
