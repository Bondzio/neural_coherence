<s> Why don't I have sound in my rear two speakers when I play mp3's? </s>
<s> All appears to work well other wise. </s>
<s> The test on the Audigy control panel works. </s>
<s> The voice says: &quot;Front left. </s>
<s> Front right. </s>
<s> Rear right. </s>
<s> Rear left.&quot; The setting is correct on the panel: 4/4.1 speakers. </s>
<s> I get sound in the rear speakers during video games. </s>
<s> Birds chirping, guns, etc... </s>
<s> I used two different players wmp and Music Match just to see if the problem was with the player, but neither let the rear speakers work. </s>
<s> I sometimes swap cards with an old Game Theater XP and that card plays sound out the back with mp3's. </s>
<s> Anyone have an idea why I have no sound in my rear speakers when I play mp3's using my SB Audigy 2 ZS? </s>
<s> In short, most MP3's are STEREO. </s>
<s> The entire idea of MP3 is to shrink the filesize and there is no reason carry more channels than 99.99% of the people will have. </s>
<s> The reason the other setup may emit sound is that it's setup to just copy stereo out that back channels. </s>
<s> Your SKILL in finding all the settings may be needed, but I do not see any flaw in hardware or software here. </s>

<s> OK here's what I had to do. </s>
<s> I called Creative tech support, and they told me to install their Creative Media Source software. </s>
<s> This was an option I unchecked during the install of the card. </s>
<s> I didn't think I would need this installed to get sound out of my rear speakers when I play mp3's. </s>
<s> In the CMS player or organizer click the EAX console tab. </s>
<s> This is to the right of the EAX enable tab. </s>
<s> Then click the CMSS 3d tab. </s>
<s> Then click the &quot;Enable CMSS 3D&quot; box. </s>
<s> Then click the &quot;CMSS 2&quot; circle. </s>
<s> That's it. </s>
<s> It seems like a roundabout way to get sound out of the rear speakers during mp3 play. </s>
<s> I didn't have this problem with the Game Theater XP. </s>
<s> (The Game Theater XP had gaming sound problems) Thanks for the reply, Bob. </s>
