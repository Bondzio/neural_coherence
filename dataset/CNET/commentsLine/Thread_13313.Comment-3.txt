no...definitely not.
this would be my sole storage of my family video.
i am trying to wrap my brain around my transition from vhs-c...and mini dv video recording.....to my new hd internal memory camcorder.
i have all the kinks out with the download to my pc...and all the editing...and saving to my new wd my passport essential se portable 750g hard drive.
now i am thinking logistics with methods to view these videos.....and started with using our ps3....which of course won't read this ntfs ehd.
when i read all the pro's and con's with fat32 and ntfs....many of the factors to consider do not apply to me or my needs....my files are well under 4g (a fat32 limitation)...i don't need password protection(an ntfs option)...so it seems logical to format to fat32.
but then people say that ntfs is more safe and sturdy...and more efficient at storing files (using less space)....but can be a problem if used in a removable device.
so i am now considering going back to vhs....haha....
