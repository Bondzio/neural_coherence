Ask 10 people and you may well get 10 opinions.
I decided years ago that I would never buy an HP PC, although I have several HP printers.
In May I bought an HP 1020n, and within 2 weeks had also bought an HP scanner and my 2nd HP digital camera.
I have had a few issues, all software related and due to the camera/scanner combo, but HP did a pretty good job of helping me straighten them out.
There is a lot of basic and intro software, but I had the same thing with my last PC which was a pre-HP Compaq.
I just uninstalled the stuff I didn't want.
If you go HP, make the System Recovery DVD/CD set ASAP just in case.
