I have a BFG GeForce 6200 (AGP) and it says it's overclocked, but http://www.digital-daily.com/video/peredelki/ says a GF6200 can be overclocked to 700mhz core clock.After looking at 6200's overclocking capabilities at various web cites I found a program, Riva Tuner(To download it just google it and you will find it fairly quickly), is said to overclock this card to the core clock speeds of a GF 6600.
If used this program would I fry the graphics card, overheat the PC, Drastically decrease the shelflife of the video card, I've heard that's it's risky to overclock My system info is if it is any help... Intel P4 2.66ghz HT 512 Kingston PC3200 Ram AGP 8x BFG GeForce 6200OC 300Watt power supply 1 40gb ATA HD Win 98 OS
