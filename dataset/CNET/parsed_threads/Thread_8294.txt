<s> Hi guys, Am having Dell Studio (1558 R) Laptop and it is dead now. </s>
<s> It mother board is crashed reset of its all part is still in working condition. </s>
<s> I was thinking to configure a new Desktop, is this possible to use Laptops's CPU(i5) on a desktop motherboard? </s>
<s> Am having following parts of laptop, 1. </s>
<s> CPU(i5) 2. </s>
<s> Ram(4GB 2 sticks) 3. </s>
<s> WLan card 4. </s>
<s> HDD (500Gb) 5. </s>
<s> LCD 6. </s>
<s> Graphic Card (1Gb) Please help me to find out some cheap solution. </s>
<s> But you have to get the exact CPU model then see if it's on a motherboard's CPU support list. </s>

<s> Robert explained what needs to be done. </s>
<s> I just like to offer you MUST be 100% sure what you have. </s>
<s> If you have a true mobile or laptop only cpu setup, it just can't be swapped in most cases. </s>
<s> Also, you may have a supported cpu, but your &quot;setup&quot; is mounted on some laptop pcb or such that the cpu is soldered to and not socketed. </s>
<s> Until you can see and hold in your hand the cpu itself and look at it's &quot;stock number&quot; after cleaning the cpu package will it all make sense. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
