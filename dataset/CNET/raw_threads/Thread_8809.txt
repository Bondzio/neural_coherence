So how many watts do you think I should shoot for?

Beware, some psu makers *may* post specs that really aren't that good once heat stress is placed on them and/or severe service, they degrade quickly. In this regard paying a bit more makes for happy system experience. The overall best advice is buy the biggest wattage psu and namebrand you can afford and be done with it. Afterall, there are now 1.5k watts(and related amps) psus offered now, though you won't need that. If you like use a psu watts calculator and then add 100W to the calculated total for optimum current needs. You can search these forums for past answers that repeatedly cover the topic. good luck tada -----Willy

You'll find the same Wattage Power Supply for sale at prices ranging from $20 to $220. Why not buy the cheap one ? Or use the PS that came with your case ? Cheap Power Supplies fail, and often they will destroy your Motherboard, Hard Drive, and pretty much everything. Honestly, it's just not worth it. Plan on spending at least $80 for a 350W or better Power Supply. It will be money well spent. Good brands I've bought are BFG and Antec, There are others that are good, too.
