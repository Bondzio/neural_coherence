1.1.1	The My Passport drive I have has been working just fine until today.	St
1.1.2	I left it in my computer when it went to sleep and now all the root directories are there, but there is nothing inside them (it tells me &quot;Folder is Empty&quot; when I hover the mouse over a folder).	St
1.1.3	Yet, the drive has the same amount of free space it did before this happened.	St
1.1.4	I don't know what to do.	St
1.1.5	I'm afraid that I've lost everything.	St
1.1.6	I'm also afraid that I haven't lost everything, but if I remove the drive, it'll lose everything.	St
1.1.7	Please help!	St
1.2.1	I figured it out.	St
1.2.2	I just needed to reboot my computer.	St
1.2.3	I'm not sure how to delete my post or I would.	Res
