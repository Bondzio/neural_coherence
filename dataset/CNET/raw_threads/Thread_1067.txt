My friendly computer techie told me I was doing the right thing to limit my software to Windows compliant and stay away from anything that starts with an 'i'. I am still scared of iTunes, I'm so happy with my music storage, playing and management using WMP - I'm talking about maybe ten years - using things like Dell DJ (obsolete) now using Zune and buying an HTC aria phone because it has HTC sync which will sync Outlook with no problems or weird accounts. NOW I am drooling at iPad 2 WIFI only. Would someone give me an honest, clear critique about my attitude and my fear of iTunes? Thank you.

More people use itunes than any other music syncing program and there is a good reason for that. It works. Microsoft has published so many software horrors that I am astounded anyone still takes them seriously for anything except windows. As you mentioned, there is Outlook, microsoft activesync, the windows mobile device center, internet explorer and other programs that can be flat out nightmares. I have spent uncounted hours on the internet trying to find a solution to syncing problems with microsoft products. Now, I am not really a big fan of itunes. I hate the way apple controls the way you can use their software and hardware products. But no one can deny that, for their stated purposes, the products work. Bottom line, itunes does a good job with media librarys and is more reliable than most.'

The software updating is dumb, it is just mostly a new install so unlike most other programs that just install the new parts, iTunes you have install the whole thing, luckily there maybe only 1-2 updates a year. It does saves all you presets but sometimes things get lost, I have lost many songs ( not big deal since I also own the CD's) & one time all my videos got lost, just had to find the folder then import the folder, fixed. Just like everything else back it up to a USB HDD.

I don't wan't iTunes to touch my music. First off, I don't like popular music. I download MP3s from Amazon, mostly listen on my PC playing thru my stereo. I have tons of copied music from old audiotapes and new CDs. I listen on my Zune to music and audiobooks - a few videos. I read books on my Kindle. The only things I would like on an iPad which are on my desktop are email, pictures, documents, writing program, games. If I had an iPad, could I e-mail myself stuff (using house WIFI) without a need for iTunes installed on my desktop or laptop? Does an iPad come with an email program? I admit total ignorance of this new medium.

You do need iTunes to register it, do updates & back it up. I have had my iPad since the 2nd month it came out & have only hooked it up to my PC 6 times, the 1st to register it, onetime for an update, the rest to back it up & transfer stuff from my PC to my iPad. What does your post have to do with iTunes? I have never bought a MP3, I buy the CD & then transfer them. What does not liking &quot;popular music&quot; have to do with iTunes, YES there's a lot of junk out there that is &quot;popular&quot; but at lease it is not as bad as the early/mid 90's with all those boy bands, that was a dark time in music history. Why so anti iTunes? No program is prefect, it is not that big of a file, it does bogs down my old 3ghz P4 2gig DIMM XP Pro laptop SOME but not to the point I can not use the Internet, just I can not say use iTunes & Google Earth with 2 or 3 windows open at the same time, it does not lockup but it is sloooow.

Sure you could email your stuff but Apple's new USB encryption system has broke about every software I knew of for sending stuff to the ipods/iphones/ipads. You may try email but jumping through hoops is not fun after the first few times. Bob

Causing problems on my desktop computer if I buy an iPad - meaning I would have to install iTunes and put up with things I would rather not put up with. Not just with music but because it is the basic software that runs iPhones and iPads. When I installed iTunes many years ago at the advice of the kids in the office this happened: Music sounded terrible played with iTunes. Several times a day people tried to access my computer. I began to associate popular music with kids chitchatting all day long and swappping stuff. (I chitchat too, on Facebook, but never about the song of the day.) It was right after the era of Napster which I thought was kind of fun until I discovered I could easily convert music I already had on other media to MP3 or WMA. And CDs got cheaper. And Amazon came along with 99cent tracks. So I think my answer is going to be the same: wait for a WIFI-only tablet which is just as good as iPad2. I certainly don't need one - it would be a toy and I don't want iTunes messing up my 'serious' computer. You confirm my doubts.
