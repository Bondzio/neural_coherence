<s> I can't seem to be able to get my new graphics card, which is a evga e-Geforce 6200 8x AGP 256mb DDR, to work on my Dell Dimension 4600. </s>
<s> If anyone can help me( every time I plug in the card into the AGP slot and turn on the computer, even when the cable is connected, the screen stays black). </s>
<s> They system came with an integrated intel extreme 2 graphics card, if it is possible to disable this, it might help. </s>
<s> If you have integrated graphics, try putting the monitor cable back on the original connector. </s>
<s> If it is still on the original connector, put it on the video card connector. </s>
<s> That will tell which card is working. </s>
<s> Also, check the BIOS setting to disable the on board graphics (although Dell hints it may be automatic) see here: http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim4600/en/4600i/sm/syssetup.htm#1138127 </s>
<s> Do i need to have the drivers already on the computer, because every time i try to do that it doesn't let me install them. </s>
<s> Also I would like to know if the dell dimension 4600 motherboards are somehow not compatible with this card. </s>
