i am running a home built intel pc.
i have a gigabyte ga-p35-ds3l motherboard running an intel core 2 duo e4400 @ 2.00ghz.
i currently have (2) 1 gig sticks of ocz pc2 6400 800 mhz dual ch ram.
the timing on those sticks is listed as 4-4-4-15. i couldn't pass up a good deal that i got online for (2) more 1 gig sticks for only $19.99 (after rebate).
they area also ocz pc2 6400 800 mhz dual ch ram.
i didn't realize when i purchased it that they have a different timing of 5-5-5. when i put all 4 in windows xp professional crashes.
i understand that with the 32 bit version i will never see all 4 gigs, but 3 would be nice.
my motherboard does have the ability to manually set the ram timing.
i tried that and i am still getting crashes.
i also took out the old ram and just booted off the new stuff to make sure i didn't get a bad stick.
it worked fine.
does anyone have any idea how to get this working.
this is the first computer that i have ever built.
if i can't get it working it looks like these sticks are going on ebay.
thanks!
