<s> I've just been told I've won a new Mac mini, with the Intel solo core (hooray!) </s>
<s> but I will be needing a display, with speakers. </s>
<s> Apple monitors are out of my price range. </s>
<s> Any suggestions/recommendations are welcome. </s>
<s> I currently have an eMac, running 10.3.9, and will be selling it with a year left on the Apple protection plan. </s>
<s> Not knowing what country/state you're in or your preference on the monitor I'll just state I'd shop around (my favorite today) for a 19&quot; widescreen LCD. </s>
<s> I've seen many for good prices in the USA but your country/state/province may not have such. </s>

<s> Notwithstanding the information from Bob, the Mac Mini will drive almost any CRT or LCD monitor. </s>
<s> You are not limited to buying an Apple branded one. </s>
<s> The machine should have a DVI connection as well as a VGA connection. </s>
<s> Get your speakers separately, they usually sound better than the ones inside monitors. </s>
<s> One thing you might want to do, add more memory immediately. </s>
<s> Good luck P </s>
<s> Thanks for the speaker hint, the VGA/DVI specifics, and about the memory addition. </s>
<s> The first is not a priority for me, but I may do the second. </s>
<s> I don't understand why Apple monitors are so much more expensive. </s>
<s> Are they just better made or are they a different kind of display -- not LCD? </s>
<s> As it applies to choices, I just wondered about the reason for the gap in price between the Apple displays and others. </s>
<s> I don't live near an Apple store, but attend a MacUserGroup occasionally, here on the northern coast of California. </s>
<s> There is a lot of talk, but I don't know who to listen to. </s>
<s> I've done internet comparisons, but guess that any brand monitor that I can afford, with LCD screen and the suggested VGA/DVI connections is OK. </s>
<s> I'm praying for guidance and am taking my time while I await the Mini. </s>
<s> I did hear that the 17&quot; are as good as 19&quot; because the larger one only stretches the pixels a bit... </s>
<s> I should take a trip to a showroom and compare, huh? </s>
<s> Thanks for your response. </s>
<s> have a good reputation for performance. </s>
<s> The 20&quot; LCD on the iMac is superb while the 30&quot; LCD is truly a sight for sore eyes. </s>
<s> Compared side by side with monitors of a similar size and specs, the Apple monitor usually comes across as the better picture. </s>
<s> However, this is all in the eye of the beholder. </s>
<s> Check out the reviews at MacWorld, http://www.macworld.com/topics/hardware/displays/ P </s>
<s> The answer about the Apple displays is simply that the design is pretty spiffy, matches the Apple hardware so you pay a designer price. </s>
<s> In NorCal I bet you have a wide array of choices. </s>
<s> So set your price point and start shopping with that connection type in mind. </s>
<s> As to 17 or 19 I have both (home, office) and the 19 is spacious in comparison. </s>
