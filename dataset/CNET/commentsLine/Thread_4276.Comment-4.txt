was just too easy.
i expected to learn a lot about networking (through trial and error), but each d-link component; cable modem, router, nics, and wireless nics all found each other, self configured, and it was done.
well, maybe not that easy, i had to input some data and set up home networking on the pcs, but all in all, the d-link configuration was really a snap.
just don't mix brands.
good luck, give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach that person to use the internet and they won't bother you for weeks.
