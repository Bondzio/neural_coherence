on my zebra 2844-z i can't print.
i load the media; plug in the usb cable install the driver from the cd.
i print a confiuration page from the printer it's self, and it works.
i go to print a windows test page and the printer gives me a flashing red light.
it seems to me to be a callibration issue or something wrong with the media or media settings but i'm out of ideas on how to figure out exactly the problem.
i run windows xp pro sp3.
i've tested it on multiple computers and i always get the same thing.
any advice is greatly appreciated.
