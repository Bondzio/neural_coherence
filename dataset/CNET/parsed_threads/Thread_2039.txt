<s> Hey, I'm new here and I need some help. </s>
<s> My brothers old Dell didn't have a burner in it, so he bought one and had it installed, years later, I inherited the computer, tore it apart and used some components in my own system, the CD-rw being my main drive. </s>
<s> Worked perfect, up until I installed a DVD player into the system, the DVD cd-rom works fine, however whenever I put a CD into the Sony CD-RW, my system freezes until I remove it, or crashes/loacks up altogether. </s>
<s> I have two IDE cables in use. </s>
<s> My system specs are 80 gig WD HD AMD Athlon 64 3500+ MSI neo2 platinum Mobo Sapphire Radeon 9800 pro Sound blaster Audigy Coolmax taurus 450 watt PSU Any help would be appreciated, it'd be nice to be able to burn again. </s>
<s> Any help is appreciated! </s>

<s> I'm not quite sure what you mean by type...one IDE cable is the rounded one that came with the system, the other is one I removed from the dell system, regular flat IDE cable. </s>
<s> I'm afraid I don't know what the jumper setting are either...can you point me where to go to check? </s>
<s> All drivers are current, I updated the bios only a few weeks ago to the newest release. </s>
