For personal computers, mostly they are for future use.
Off the top of my head: X1 = video cards; network adapters; HDD/RAID controllers; USB, Firewire and Serial cards.
X4, X8 = HDD/RAID controllers.
I just Googled for PCI Express sound cards and TV tuners and came up with a few hits.
Hmm...I didn't know about those!
