I have a Laptop 'Toshiba M45 S331' that came with xp home.
I had to install win 2000 for job purpose.
Now I cannot find the driver for the Ethernet controller (Marvell Yukon 88E8036 PCE-E fast Ethernet Controller) anywhere.
Called Toshiba and they don't support it for win2k.
Checked on Marvell website and they don't seem to have it either.
Laptop also has 1394 Net Adapter which is also without driver.
Could anyone pleas direct me to the right path...Thank you..
