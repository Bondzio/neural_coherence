I'd like to remove the hard drive from my old PC and use it to store music and photos on my new PC. I'm ok on taking the old drive out, but not sure how to connect it to the new PC. And not sure what I need to do to the old one to make it usable stricly for storage! Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Get one that has a fan. Most online retailers have them. You just plug it in a USB/Firewire port on your computer and an external harddrive ye shall make. and life goes on... Jack
