i think i asked this question before and got something of a vague response.
i have a dell computer from 2006 (an xps 410) and my video card is an nvidia geforce 9500 gt.
now i've heard that with some resolutions it's not possible to see the computer on the tv screen, but 640x480 works best and full-screen games are just fine.
my monitor is capable of going to 640x480.
now my other question is that i'm planning on getting a new computer soon (also a dell, not sure which one yet).
it's going to be widescreen, whereas the one i have now is a standard definition resolution monitor.
will that impact what cable i need or will it work for both an older and a newer computer?
i'm quite confused by this so any help is much appreciated!
thanks!
