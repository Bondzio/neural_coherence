it is possible that your usb ports do not match the speed of the usb devices you are using.
for instance, your usb ports might be 1.1 ports, while the drivers you are using with your mouse and keyboard requires a 2.0 port.
if that's the case, then your system is going to have trouble working with those devices.
if that is the problem you're having, then the best solution is to either upgrade your motherboard or get a usb hub that can upconvert your usb ports to a 2.0 speed so your devices can work with them.
