i have had this printer for 3 years and windows 7 for 1 year.
never had a problem with printing from computer until today.
a window appears stating that the printer can not communicate with the computer...all of a sudden!!!!!
last printed from a file 2 days ago now this.
contacted lexmark for 1 1/2 hours today and they could not fix.
told me my printer was not compatible with windows 7. why all of a sudden?
what can i do???
can not afford a new printer.
please be specific!!
!...thanks.
