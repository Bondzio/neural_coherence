<s> Thanks in advance for any help anyone could give me. </s>
<s> I am on an older Dell Desktop that does not have high speed USB 2.0 A lot of the External Hard Drives I see have 2.0 in the name. </s>
<s> For example a random google says &quot;Toshiba's 400GB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive&quot;. </s>
<s> Does this mean it has to have a 2.0 drive to work? </s>
<s> Secondly I am almost exclusively going to be storing music on this hard drive as a means of moving around my growing music collection. </s>
<s> Will moving music onto the hard drive and possibly back onto another computer degrade the quality of the track? </s>
<s> And lastly if anyone could make recommendation for a good external hard drive that will work for my needs and computer it would be much appreciated. </s>
<s> I am running Windows XP and Service pack 2, not a terribly old computer by some standards, it just does not have a 2.0 highspeed USB slot. </s>
<s> Thank you again for any help! </s>
<s> The USB 2.0 refers to interface between the external enclosure and the host PC system...not the HDD itself. </s>
<s> Might consider getting a USB 2.0 Hi-Speed PCI card for your Dell to take greater advantage of the USB 2.0 speed (480Kbps) over the older USB speed (40Kbps). </s>
<s> The difference is significant ...even if you're not doing it for profit. </s>
<s> Just keep in mind...it's never ever safe to keep the only copy of your family photos, music, or anything else you cannot afford to lose or easily replace on a single hard disk drive. </s>
<s> It can die, take a voltage spike, or succumb to a virus in an instant. </s>
<s> Re recommendations...if you buy retail (a fully assembled external enclosure with a hard drive installed)...I recommend Seagate or Western Digital. </s>
<s> If you build your own...buy an enclosure and a hard drive of choice..I'd pick Seagate or Western Digital drive and a brand name, quality enclosure. </s>
<s> The difference... most Seagate and WD drive have 5 year and 3 year warranties respectively. </s>
<s> Most retail HDDs I see have one year warranties. </s>
<s> Good Luck VAPCMD </s>
<s> Thank you for the reply, so from what I gather you are saying a 2.0 drive will work with my computer I will just not be taking advantage of the fast speeds I could be if I had a 2.0 usb correct? </s>
<s> My only other issue is the question about will storing music on an external hard drive degrade the quality of the music file if I was to move it between computers using the hard drive. </s>
<s> From what I have read and gathered it does not but I just wanted to ask to be sure as these things are not my expertise. </s>
<s> I planned to just copy My Music folder onto an External drive for a bit of extra protection as my collection is becoming large. </s>
<s> Thank you once again for your insight. </s>
<s> It's an exact copy, like any copy of any file on any drive. </s>
<s> So no loss of quality. </s>

<s> Quick answer...&quot;YES&quot; But keep in mind mind...&quot;USB&quot; is the interface standard between the external HDD enclosure and the PC.... it has nothing to do with the drive itself. </s>
<s> Even faster is the eSATA interface and for future use...it's faster than USB 2.0. </s>
<s> If possible ...get an external with USB 2.0 and eSATA. </s>
