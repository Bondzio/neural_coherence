I reinstalled windows xp to get rid of this virus. Everything with the reboot went ok. I noticed that when scrolling through internet pages it was very sluggish. I did some research and found that I didn't re-install the graphics card driver after the reboot. Unfortunitley my girlfriend didn't have the driver disk for the graphics card. I instead tried to manually install it from the list and accidently installed the wrong one. Now, when you turn on the computer you can see the screen that says &quot;Dell&quot; and then the Screen that says &quot; Microsoft windows with the progress bar&quot; once this is done loading the screen goes black. You can still here everything booting up but no picture. How can I remove the bad driver without being able to see anything? Any suggestions? Thanks Andy
