Trendnet just returned an email I sent them.
They think the problem is being caused by interference and asked me to change the channel.
It is currently on the default channel 6 but cannot figure out how to change it.
The user manual does not seem to show how.
Do you think this is a realistic solution?
and any idea how to change it?
thanks for the help Bob.
