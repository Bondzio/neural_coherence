<s> Hello I have a very weird problem here, concerning my UPS. </s>
<s> And this is the second UPS! </s>
<s> The first one was a &quot;Orbit&quot; 600 VA model, and now i have a new &quot;Street Line&quot; 1000 VA one. </s>
<s> Both of them show precisely the same strange behaviour. </s>
<s> When my PC is on, and the power goes out, the PC goes off too! </s>
<s> The UPS won't back up as it is supposed to do. </s>
<s> When i turn the UPS then off and on again, it won't start - just beeps short and stays off. </s>
<s> If i unplug the computer (! </s>
<s> ), i can start the UPS! </s>
<s> I can then even plug the computer back in, and boot it - so the battery in the UPS is fine and has certainly enough power to keep the computer going for more than half an hour. </s>
<s> I tested it with several other electrical devices - all of them stay on when i simulate a power failure by switching off the breaker. </s>
<s> I tried with a fan, my home stereo, a small washing machine (600 watts) and my 21&quot; CRT television plus satellite receiver. </s>
<s> All of these devices nicely stay on when the power goes. </s>
<s> So why doesn't the computer??? </s>
<s> My computer consists of a 365 watts ENERMAX PSU which is only about a year old, a ASUS A7A-133 MoBo, ATHLON XP 1800+ CPU, 2 HDD's, 2 CD drives, every PCI slot used etc and a 17&quot; LCD monitor which is just 2 months old. </s>
<s> The computer itself works absolutely perfect, no power problems whatsoever. </s>
<s> I apreciate any help i can get, because i can;t just keep buying UPS's until i find one that does the job - i already have two that work just perfect with everything except my PC, and i can't refund those because they, well, work. </s>
<s> The fault must be with the computer - somehow. </s>
<s> Kind regards..... Thanh </s>
<s> may be fussy about the waveform being generated by the UPS is the computer. </s>
<s> Some of the early UPS's simply made a somewhat square wave, the newer [better?] </s>
<s> ones make something that more closely approximates a sine wave. </s>
<s> Never heard of the two brands that you mention. </s>
<s> Maybe try one by APC, or go to their website to read up on the subject. </s>
<s> of UPS's. </s>
<s> One is always using the battery to power the output while the battery is constantly being float charged. </s>
<s> The other actually transfers from one to the other. </s>
<s> If this transfer is the problem, it may be possible to go into the PC's BIOS and change the Power Management settings. </s>
<s> Maybe set it so that the power off button has to be held in for 4 secs before it will turn the system off. </s>
<s> One thing about an ATX system is that if you shut it off, you must wait a short time [maybe 10 or so seconds] before you can turn it on. </s>
<s> Has to do with the discharge of capacitors in the power control circuits. </s>
<s> Possibly the UPS causes it to momentarily shut off and then the voltage comes back before the turn on logic will work properly. </s>
<s> Of course, this still means a reboot which is not at all what the purpose the UPS is supposed to do. </s>
<s> Could be as simple as having the PC plugged into an outlet that is NOT battery-protected. </s>
<s> On my APC, all plugs are surge-protected, but only half are battery-protected. </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> Hello, and thanks for all replies Since my PSU is rather new and of a renowned brand (Enermax) i suppose it is a good one? </s>
<s> I don't know about wave forms tough.......... what can be done in that regards? </s>
<s> About the &quot;handover&quot;, both of my UPS units are of the type that switches to battery when the AC power goes, you can hear the relays clicking when that happens. </s>
<s> And all of the outlets (there are only four of them) are battery covered, yes. </s>
<s> I describe the problem a bit more exact: If the AC power goes out (failure, or i switch the breaker) while the computer is on, the UPS along with all connected devices shuts off - it bvriefly beeps and clicks, and then dies as if the battery was empty. </s>
<s> It will then refuse to start again, exactly as if the battery was flat - when i turn the UPS switch off and on again. </s>
<s> However when i unplug the computer (only the machine, not monitor, printer or anything else that's on the UPS) i CAN switch the UPS back on! </s>
<s> And once it's on i can even connect the PC again, it will stay on (this is while AC power is still off). </s>
<s> I can then proceed to start the PC, boot normally and keep it going for quite some time before the battery REALLY goes flat. </s>
<s> If there are other devices connected to the UPS, such as a TV, a stereo or even a rather power-hungry small washing machine, these devices will stay on (along with the UPS) when AC goes off. </s>
<s> So it's definitely only the actual PC that's causing this UPS shutdown. </s>
<s> And i have two different UPS's which show exactly the same behaviour, despite being of different brands and different power ratings. </s>
<s> The issue with the &quot;wave form&quot; sounds logical to me, but what can i do about it? </s>
<s> Shield the wires somehow? </s>
<s> Add grounding? </s>
<s> (my apartment has no grounding, as most electrical outlets in Bangkok are fed by only two wires). </s>
<s> I appreciate any help i can get Kind regards..... your Thanh </s>
<s> you have things plugged wrong. </s>
<s> A washing machine? </s>
<s> That should be on a wall plug on a different circuit than your electronics if possible. </s>
<s> The TV, stereo, etc should be on the surge-only side. </s>
<s> The PC and anything that will lose data or be harmed by suddenly being shut off should be on one of the battery-protected plugs. </s>
<s> If you do this and still have the same problem, I would say you may have a battery that's not taking a charge. </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> Hello Thank you very much for reply. </s>
<s> However you didn't read it all.... - UPS has only four outlets, and all are battery-backed. </s>
<s> No surge-only outlets available. </s>
<s> - Washing machine is small, portable model - 600 watts only. </s>
<s> - Washing machine, TV, stereo and fan were connected only for testing purpose, one at a time, to see if the UPS would work with them. </s>
<s> - Battery is perfectly ok, after diconnecting computer i can restart UPS, then reconnect computer, and use as if normal. </s>
<s> Normally connected to the UPS are computer, monitor, printer and power adaptor for external DSL modem. </s>
<s> Problem occurs even when computer is alone connected - so problem MUST be with the computer. </s>
<s> Kind regards.... Thanh </s>
<s> Go to control panel, poerformance and maintanence, power options, and select the UPS tab, and select your UPS's manufacturer. </s>
<s> I forgot that part. </s>
<s> Never saw a UPS with all plugs being battery-protected. </s>
<s> I'll take your word since you are looking at it. </s>
<s> That being said, Sgt brought up an important issue. </s>
<s> Did you run the set-up program that came with UPS? </s>
<s> Unless you did, the computer is not tied to the UPS and will act as it has. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> Hello Again thank you for replying and trying to help me. </s>
<s> I have only once, EVER, seen a UPS here which had a serial sort of port to be hooked up with a computer, and that UPS did cost more than my computer. </s>
<s> The only connectors that mine (both!) </s>
<s> have are four electricity outlets, of which two are three-prong and two are two-prong, all four are backed up by the battery and have a surge protection. </s>
<s> Further there are phone - line in and line out, which provides a surge protection as well. </s>
<s> And that's it. </s>
<s> No other means of connecting it to the computer, and no setup program whatsoever. </s>
<s> When i go to the power options as suggested, it will ask for the serial port in use - narda, don't have that. </s>
<s> This UPS is supposed to simply switch to battery power in the moment the AC goes, and it DOES that - for every device except the bloody computer. </s>
<s> I think i am ready to give up on the whole issue and just thread is at a surge protection - better than nothing since once i had a PSU go up in smoke when they operated major welding machines at a neighbouring construction site, which luckily has become a finished apartment building meantime. </s>
<s> With kind regards...... your Thanh </s>
<s> First thing I would look at would be to ensure the switch over rate for that UPS is fast enough. </s>
<s> In other words, you may need a 8 millisecond rate to keep the computer going but the UPS is only switching at 10 millisecond. </s>
<s> (these rates are not actual, just used as example) I would suspect you will find your problem there. </s>
