range is limited by a few simple things (that we can't see!)
the power of the router, and the environment or walls and location of the router and buildings.
sometimes it's interference from things like old cordless phones.
no maker has a stronger router signal because all have a limit imposed by the fcc (or your government.)
to improve range i move the wifi router to a better location.
some folk ignore the basement warning and that's easy to fix the range by moving it out of the basement.
i've seen folk pay hundreds for such moves.
here i continue to move mine for free.
