My power supply is Rosewill value series RU450.
Model number AP500X.
450W max power.
I must be retarded or something, because I can't figure out how to use the memtest86.
Could you tell me step by step the way to make a cd-rom of it.
I unzipped it and burned it to a cd.
I set my BIOS to boot from my DVD drive, but it didn't find anything there, so it booted from my HD.
