for the last 6 to 8 years and the system runs 24-7-365. when using ghost, i boot from a simple floppy disk that runs ghost and helps me restore a partition image to the existing hdd or to a new hdd should that be necessary.
restoring c takes about 15 minutes and d takes about 45 minutes.
much much faster restoring from a second internal hdd.
while there are some vulnerabilities using a second internal hdd, like you i partition the primary hdd (to separate the os-apps on c and data on d).
the system is protected by a surge suppressor, a heavy duty ups, and multiple images of both c and d are copied to an external hdd..just in case.
too many posts here and elsewhere on external hdd hiccups and failures to rely on them as the only source data for a system restore.
sounds like we're following a similar path...except for the internal hdd which has been successful for me for many years.
knock on wood, i've never had to use the images stored on the external hdds but they're there if needed.
and i agree...good cloning/imaging sw is worth it's weight in gold.
i don't want to spend days finding cds and serial numbers, loading the os, the drivers, the apps, reregistering sw, setting preferences, running updates.
makes me tired thinking of it.
