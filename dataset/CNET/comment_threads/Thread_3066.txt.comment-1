hi, im really quite ignorant when it comes to most things wireless and i need a bit of help.
at my college there is wired broadband internet (i believe) and i would like to turn this into a wireless network in a certain part of the college.
i have seen it done before by connecting the broadband cable into a router or access point or something like that, im just not sure how.
its also something i would like to disconnect at the end of every day, not anything perminent.
this probably is very simple but i dont know much.
thank you very much for any help.
