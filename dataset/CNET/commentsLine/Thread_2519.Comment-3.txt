never had any trouble configuring mouse, keyboard or digital camera upload to usb port.
can't understand why canon provides parallel and usb connections on back of printer and then it's impossible to set up the printer for usb using their supplied disc.
even tried web page driver download with similar lack of success.
now have spare usb cord.
