Had it happen here with one of those high strength neodynium magnets and a 27 inch tv set.
I had a tape head demagnetiser which managed to knock most of the magnetic field out of the mask after quite a few passes.
They're pretty weak when it comes to degaussing something like this, but after a month, the built in degaussing coil finally cleared the residual magnetism.
