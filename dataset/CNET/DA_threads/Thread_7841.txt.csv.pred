1.1.1	So I just finished building a Core 2 Duo PC for a friend, and now that everythings in and all, the power switch won't turn it on.	St
1.1.2	For some reason the Power LED is on, though faint.	St
1.1.3	I reconnected all the front panel stuff and made sure they were in the correct places but to no avail.	St
1.1.4	Also, the mobo supports a 24-pin power, but I used a 20-pin.	St
1.1.5	It said it could use 20-pin too.	St
1.1.6	Also, the 12V connector had 8 slots but I used a P4 cable instead.	St
1.1.7	These might be the problem, but I'm not sure.	St
1.1.8	[URL=http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/mainboard/mbd/pro_mbd_detail.php?UID=745]Mobo Link[/URL] [URL=http://www.coolermaster-usa.com/Products.aspx?pid=634]Case Link[/URL] Any ideas?	St
1.2.1	So you connected the 20 pin connector starting from PINs 1-13 (JPWR1) and what about JPWR2 (8-pin) and JPWR3 (4-pin molex).	St
1.2.2	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Yeah, the 20 pin fit into the 24 pin in the right slots, (it's idiot-proof).	St
1.3.2	The JPWR2(8pin) has a P4 12V (4pin) cable in the 4 slots that weren't originally covered up with a little plastic thingy.	St
1.3.3	As for the molex, I stuck a molex into it from the PSU.	St
1.3.4	Hope this is all right.	St
1.4.1	esp vodeo card.	St
1.4.2	Motherboard manual suggests 450W PSU .... looks as if what you have is either 350W or optionally 380W ...is that right ?	Ques
1.4.3	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	7300 GT I believe (I'm at home now so I'm not 100% sure about this one, its 7300 for sure, not sure about the GT) As for HDD, the Master is a 250GB WD SATA2, and the slave is an IDE (160GB WD) drive with a adapter thing to convert to SATA (even though I don't like this, he's stuck with it until he can afford a SATA drive...soon) 2 Opticals are DVD burners, IDE, using the 1 IDE connector the mobo has.	St
1.5.2	We have a firewire card in a PCI slot for fun Proc is a Core 2 Duo E6300 (1.86 Ghz, 1066 FSB) The memory is CORSAIR ValueSelect (2x512) DDR2.	St
1.5.3	The PSU is 500W.	St
