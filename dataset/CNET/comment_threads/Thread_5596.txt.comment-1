Have a Dell Dimension 3000, running XP and have a Ms Pacman game installed.
Using the keyboard is kind of a pita.
A joystick would be easier.
I have a couple of usb ports available.
Can I just get a plug and play joystick?
Where do you suggest I find one?
Does anyone even use a joystick anymore?
I feel old fashioned by even asking the question.
But I know my 5 year old (and I too) would be happy playing the game with a joystick.
Thanks.
Ed.
