what cpu and how much ram does this machine have?
the reason i ask is the gamer statment the 6600 vs the gf2 mx is about a 10x performance increase aside from that, the issue is cpu whilea 6600 can handle half-life 2 like no1's business, a slow cpu probably cant (3 years means it, at best, would be around 3ghz) but i'm just wondering what cpu you have, and what ammunt of ram you have and the ammount of hard drive space is also something to think about if your system has a sub 2ghz chip, with under 512mb of ram, and a 40gb or lesser hard drive, considering an new system might not be so unrealistic (and for a new system, i'd suggest you build it yourself to save money)
