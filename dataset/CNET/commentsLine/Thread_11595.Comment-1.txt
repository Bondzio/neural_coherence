i want to upgrade my pc in the next six months, mainly to future proof for gaming.
i don't have a bad rig now, but would like pci 3 capacity.
therefore my question is should i wait for haswell or purchase a sandy bridge e or ivy bridge?
my specs are as follows: intel i5 2500k 3.3ghz nvidia gtx 680 12 gig ddr 3 ram 750w corsair psu 1 tb wd hdd -oh yes, i mainly play mmos and am looking forward to the elder scrolls.
also, do i need ddr 4 ram?
thanks so much for any help!
