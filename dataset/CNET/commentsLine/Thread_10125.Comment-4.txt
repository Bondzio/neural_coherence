as for floor system usage(nope), i meant if anything to eleveate off of floor.
the dust bunnies can easily jump in and more readily clog the works.
plus, if you have pets, the dander can too be a problem.
i've seen some dirty and dusty situations and wonder why the system still works.
as for my desk, it's a simple 6ft.
folding table brought many moons ago.
nothing fancy in this house.
ah, yes i do have my cover off, but i didn't mention that as that's more the quick cure and house fan setup.
since i tend to run my system runs 24x7, i do decide some mornings to shutdown as i won't be back until late, by that time, the house heat is pretty hot.
