1.1.1	I 'm using a fairly new built PC at work running W2K , Asus mobo w/fan and AMD XP 2800 Processor , Allied 400W PS w/two fans .	St
1.1.2	The CPU is around 2 GHz I think and RAM is 512 .	St
1.1.3	According to a third party app the CPU temp is 58C - 60C and that seems too high to me .	St
1.1.4	Others here seem to think because it 's an AMD Processor that the temp is normal .	St
1.1.5	Is it normal ?	Ques
1.1.6	Or should I worry about it being too high ?	Ques
1.1.7	I 'm used to CPU temps in the 30s .	St
1.2.1	Which 3rd Party software are you using to monitor temprature because 58-60 definately seems to high .	St
1.2.2	I recommend a peice of software called Motherboard monitor to monitor temps .	St
1.2.3	You can get it from this site - http : //mbm.livewiredev.com/ Also , check the CPU temp in the BIOS as that 'll be more accurate than the 3rd Party one you 're using at the moment .	St
1.3.1	Thank you , Spartan , for your reply .	St
1.3.2	I was using Aida32 and SpeedFan to monitor the CPU .	St
1.3.3	I now have side panel on the PC partially open .	St
1.3.4	I installed Motherboard monitor .	St
1.3.5	What a neat program , still need to learn more about it .	St
1.3.6	I rebooted and read the temp with all utilities one after the other : BIOS- 53C , SpeedFan- 52C , Aida32- 53C , MEM- 56C .	St
1.3.7	Seems high but safe ?	Ques
1.3.8	Someone shared this site with me : http : //www.heatsink-guide.com/maxtemp.htm .	St
1.3.9	The boss is not concerned so I guess I should n't be either .	St
1.3.10	Thank you for the advice and the link to MBM .	St
1.4.1	No problem , thanks for the link to the article .	Polite
1.4.2	If you 're still interested , look at this link http : //www.pantherproducts.co.uk/Articles/CPU/CPU % 20Temperatures.shtml .	St
1.4.3	Right down at the bottom of the page is a video showing what happens to Pentiums and AMDs when they overheat .	St
1.4.4	As for yours overheating , I think 56 is still a little too high but well within parameters .	St
1.4.5	as you say , if th boss is n't bothered then you 've no reason to be .	St

1.5.1	You can do better with a lot more fan noise [ higher speed HSF fan ] .	St
1.5.2	Best , quiet help is another case fan [ or two ] to move more room ambient air through the case .	St
1.5.3	Make certain that the exhaust air path allows the input fans to move the maximum air flow into the system .	St
1.5.4	Keep in mind that at 60 C degrees that piece of solid state might out live you .	St
1.5.5	It certainly should live well past the time that you will be given a new computer .	St
1.6.1	I have bought a very nice note book on the outside , but with one major flaw , if you guys think 60degrees Celsius is hot , try think about off 85degree Celsius , THAT 's running one program with this notebook .	St
1.6.2	Not even ASUS SA wants to comment on this .	St
1.6.3	Maybe I must use it as a very expensive door stopper ! !	St
1.6.4	Testing it with various RAM , up to 12 gig , still the CPU is running on very high temp , I have set a threshold of 85 degrees , after that you will have a black hole on your desk , any suggestions	St
1.7.1	I 've warned about gaming laptops for years .	St
1.7.2	This is hot but all it means is this is the state of the art today .	St
1.7.3	You might be comparing to the temps we see in desktops .	St
1.7.4	There are no plans to fix such things as they do work for a few years .	St
1.7.5	Bob	St
