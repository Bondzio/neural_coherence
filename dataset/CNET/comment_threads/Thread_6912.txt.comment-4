For my own sanity, I will ask a seemingly &quot;Wi-fi for Dummies&quot; question: Plugging in an &quot;Advanced Wireless USB Adapter&quot; like the Hawking Technology antenna or the Dynex Adapter will not conflict with the antenna already inside my laptop?
By conflict I mean the laptop deciding which antenna receiver to use.
I assume Windows Vista will give me the choice which to use... or can/will both antennas be used ?
Thanks
