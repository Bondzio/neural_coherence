i had the same exact problem when first hooking up new xp desktop through router to laptops.
it's the firewalls -- as mentioned you have to disable the built-in xp firewall however you must also disable the firewall in norton internet security (which comes preloaded in most xp's).
once i disabled norton's firewall the whole network was ready.
good luck.
