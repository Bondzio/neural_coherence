Device Manager shows that the hardware is fine and the driver is fine - I couldn't run a diagnostic test as it requires inserting a CD. I'm not very knowledgeable with computers (in the technical sense)but have tried to check this out and it still won't work no matter what I do. Any ideas? hanks

I couldnt' find anything so went on the internet in general and found anh answer under Techblissonline......................he had me go in and disable Vista's built-in CD and DVD Burning or recording features. I made a change in the registery where I typed in manually NOCDBurning Datavalue 1. Then it worked for a while and didn't. So I figured, maybe the program still exists. So I went in and deleted the Windows burning program from the list of programs. Now everything works super. Hope it continues to!!!
