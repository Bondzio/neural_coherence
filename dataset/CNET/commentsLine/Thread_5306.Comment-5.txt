thank you all for your assistance.
i ended up having to go ahead and buy a new hard drive already as i had to get something for my data.
i ended up getting 2 250 gb western digital my book premium drives.
i have under 250 gb's and so, i am going to use one full time for my data and then, every month, update the second one with an exact copy of what is on the first drive.
if something fails in the drive that i am using, i will have a whole new hd waiting for me.
it cost a bit more, but that option was better than having one hd fail on me and then having to pay 1000 for hd recovery!
can you all tell me more about norton ghost and how it works?
