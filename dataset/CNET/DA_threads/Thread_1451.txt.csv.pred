1.1.14	After the above I don't have a ton of dough left over to spend on the chip.	St
1.1.15	I haven't built a system since my 1999 PIII 500, I'm having to learn a few new things.	St
1.1.16	TIA Shawn	St
1.2.1	You usually want to design a system around the CPU you are going to use.	St
1.2.2	Since you say you are very limited on what you can spend now because of the other peripheral devices on your list, I would go back and reevaluate this first.	St
1.2.3	Then you would add your peripheral devices LAST.	St
1.2.4	The motherboard you have chosen looks excellent.	St
1.2.5	Keep in mind that it only has 3 PCI slots and would be limited for expansion in that area.	St
1.2.6	It all depends on what cards you want to add in the future.	St
1.2.7	If you are a hard core gamer, you might want to consider more memory on the video card, depending on what games you are planning to use.	St
1.2.8	512Mb cards are out there but cost a lot.	St
1.2.9	Make sure your CAS rating on the memory is 2.0 for the best performance and make SURE that it is a MATCHED pair for your dual channel DDR to function properly.	St
1.2.10	An excellent case to consider is the Lian Li case line.	Polite
1.2.11	They are very well made and you will be pleased with how easy they are to work with.	St
1.2.12	I see no other bottlenecks in what you have posted.	St
1.3.1	It may not have the correct connector for the Mobo main power plug.	St
1.3.2	See this link for some more info.	St
1.3.3	: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6122-0.html?forumID=44&threadID=56219&messageID=1029018	St
1.4.1	in the Hardware forum: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7591-0.html?forumID=26&threadID=91707&messageID=1033439 .	St
1.5.1	Good points.	St
1.5.2	I left the chip for last and it looks like I'll have to increase my budget by about 300 bucks in order to get a p4 650 3.4.	St
1.5.3	The graphics card will have to stay in the 256 range for the time being.	St
1.5.4	I'm also mainly going to be doing video editing on this system.	St
1.5.5	Any other suggestions with this in mind?	St
1.5.6	PCI slots could be an issue at some point as well in the future.	St
1.5.7	I guess a new mobo in a couple years would fix that.	St
1.6.1	The PCI slots should not be an issue in the future.	St
1.6.2	The Asus photo shows you are getting a mobo with: 1- PCI-Express x16 (for the video card) 2- PCI-Express x1 (small white bus) some mobo's with x1 &quot;Express PCI Technology&quot; only have one instead of 2.	St
1.6.3	3- PCI (regular standard large white bus).	St
1.6.4	The PCI-Express is the wave of the future, and look for more mobo's to have less regular PCI as time goes on.	St
1.6.5	I don't see you having to get a new mobo for some time (years).	St
1.6.6	http://www.asus.com/products/mb/socket775/p5ad2-e-p/overview.htm The cheapest P4 650 3.4GHz is $411 at PriceWatch.	St
1.6.7	Newegg is $419.	St
1.6.8	Don't forget $'s for a case, and the WinXP Operating System...Home complete $187, or Pro Full version $276 Please see my post at the Hardware forum suggesting you might want to look at Monarch building it for you for $49.	St
1.6.9	Why go thru the hassle of doing something wrong, or time if you are short of,or headache's ... with no warranty other than what you get along with parts purchase.	Sug
