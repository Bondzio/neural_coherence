if the message is not getting across, let me know.
i rarely cross the threshold at best buy.
i go there to &quot;showroom.&quot; if you don't know what that is, read  you did get many years out of the first drive and it appears you don't want to see if the hdd, case or cable failed.
that's ok but i have found too many good drives inside a broke case.
