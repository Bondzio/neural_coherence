i recently bought an hp pavilion a1310n desktop pc.
when i place a dvd movie in my computer i get the message &quot;no windows 2000 compatible dvd decoder installed on this system.&quot; i like windows 2000 and dislike windows xp, so i had wiped xp off the system and installed 2000. for the most part it went well, though there are three drivers i am still trying to track down and install.
how can i find out what dvd decoder needs to be installed on this system?
any ideas on where i can find it?
i very much appreciate any help.
just in case you may be a real wizard, the three drivers that are missing are listed as: 1) multimedia audio controller - location pci bus 0, device 20, function 5 2) pci device - location pci bus 0, device 20, function 0 3) unknown device - on microsoft acpi - compliant system.
how on earth do you find a driver for an unknown device, or find out what the unknown device is??
help!!!
shouldn't people be able to place any operating system on their computer they want without the computer being proprietary to a particular operating system?
