usaully hitting a function key or the delete key (it says how to when ya first boot) and change the primary boot to the cdrom drive, then put in your backup copy of windows xp that came with your computer.
It'll boot off of the cd.
From there you can delete all your partitions and start over again.
When it asks to format do a low-level format (the one thats not quick).
One thing to note though is that you should make sure you have all your drivers.
At least your internet drivers, so you can download the fresh ones from the internet if you have to.
Also, make sure you have your firewall running before you load your internet drivers.
