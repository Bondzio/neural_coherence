If you're using XP Pro you can customize the Internet Explorer title bar to read, &quot;By Lucy&quot; or anything else you like.
Just type gpedit.msc in the run dialog box.
Expand the User Configuration node in the Group Policy console on left.
Select Browser User Interface and then in the right pane double-click Browser Title.
In the dialog box that opens, select the &quot;Customize Title Bars&quot; check box and type whatever you want.
