So i assumed it was the card itself. I switched to the onboard video and have no problems. Yet when i uninstall the driver for my plug and play card i can then put that card back in and as long as i dont update the card and use the default monitor it does not do any flickering or freezing. So im not exactly sure its the card because as long as i dont update it and use default driver for it, it works fine just without any 3D. By the way its a nvidia Geforce4 mx420.Any suggestions would be appreciated.
