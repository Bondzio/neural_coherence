i have a thompson wireless router which has been firmware upgraded.
i can successfully access the internet with my intel imac and my pc laptop.
when i try to connect to the router using airport on my gg powerbook 867mhz os x 10.5.8. i get a connection timeout message.
i have successfully connected by airport/wifi to my old router in london and even to a macdonalds free wifi.
no luck here and isp unable to help despite sending me a new router and recommending the software upgrade.
any assistance greatly welcome.
