The wireless connection icon says the notebook is &quot;connected&quot; to the network, and the signal strength is &quot;excellent&quot;. I used to be able to access the wireless network from the notebook, but suddenly now I seem to be not allowed to access it anymore! The shared internet connection does not work in the notebook anymore, and if I try to access the shared folders of the desktop, I keep on getting the following error message in the notebook: &quot;(network place) is not accessible. You might not have permission to access this network resource. Contact the administrator blah blah. The Network path was not found.&quot; WHAT CAN I DO to access my own network? I already tried connecting from the &quot;wireless network connection - properties&quot; dialog box, but no success. Thanks a lot in advance
