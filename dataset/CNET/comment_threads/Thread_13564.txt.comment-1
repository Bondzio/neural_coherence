Going to replace hard drive on Titanium PBG4.
Becoming audible when it was whisper quiet before and I don't want to be caught.
It also seems to be slower but that could be imagination working.
How does one decide ?
What are the prime considerations other than size and price?
rotational speed?
4200 5400 7200?
Is faster always better?
seek times?
brand?
Thanks for any insights.
