5166	8	307250	2852781	2852681	Slackenerny	9/8/08 9:02 AM	1.22086452E12	hmmmm	sound dumb exonerate myself asking claiming novice routers actually programmed automatically unwrap every single data frame receives read ip address underneath should say above network layer top reencapsulate send away reason mac address data link layer being necessary though ip addresses themselves already unique relaying message point point point point point actually direct contact viz cannot communicate node node must go through point must use mac address message gone correct middlemanmen got maybe were deploying ipv where every networking hardware allocated unique ip address having mac address really necessary mean theoretically modify protocol something source ip address destination ip address ip address next relay lt plays role mac address maybe thatd too work
