Basically, if storage fails for some reason, then data is gone. Always think data first, then the h/w.. I suggest you wrap in orginal packing if available. If not, then a simple double bagging in plastic bags will do fine then store in closet. If you have access to descentant, use some. All this depends on the condition/enviroment of area of storage. tada -----Willy

Then with the rest of your desktop you can store in a dumpster or local recycleing center. or donate it for a tax break. or go office space on it's ass!! the possibilities are endless!!
