Aside from codecs... two basic questions: 1.
Is the DVD you're using pre-recorded or is it a home-grown version?
If home-grown, was it finalized on the original recorder before you attempted to play it on the computer?
Unless it's finalized, it won't be readible by any other player but the one it was recorded on.
2.
If this is a blank DVD, are you sure it's compatible with your drive?
(DVD + vs. -, 1x-8x format, ROM vs. RAM, etc.)
Some media just won't work with certain recorders.
