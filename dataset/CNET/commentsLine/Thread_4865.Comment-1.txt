i just bought a factory repaired seagate barracuda 750 gig sata drive and installed it .
when i rebooted the mobo started to beep , and the drive made similar sound (or noise) .
both sounds continue with drive data cable unplugged from board and drive.
after about 2 mins.
both sounds cease .
bios does not detect it .
the drive spins-up and , otherwise , sounds normal .
