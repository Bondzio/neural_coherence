as someone new to wireless, i've read the nearly 50 posts here re: wireless stuff and also followed many links to reviews via newegg, amazon, etc., because i am trying to make a decision about going wireless inside my dwelling (since my dog chewed up my 50' cable cord), for use with my laptop, which is a hp pavilion zt1000 series built-to-order, running winxp home edition.
i get broadband highspeed internet via comcast through a modem i purchased from comcast (the doxport com21 dp1110).
please, please, folks, review the following and give me any input/feedback about whether my reasoning is good, or if you suggest any changes.
thanks.
from everything i've read i've determined that i should probably go with netgear (wgt634u 1eee 802.11b/g, with wpa and 64/128-bit wep, whatever that means), for a number of reasons: [a] i'm super concerned about security (i experienced a huge crash with one of the bad viruses that circulated a few months or so ago)and i only heard one person mention positive things about security and that was re: netgear (does anyone have anything to say about security provided by other brands?
), i'm new at this & non-techy, so hooking up the netgear router will be easier for me than others, from what i've heard.
i hope this is true.
[c] for surfing away from home at coffee shops,etc., i'm already using a netgear wireless adapter, wag511 802.11g pcmcia, which i hope is compatible with the router i am thinking of buying.
any input on that?
[d]nothing's going to work perfectly anyway, so i might as well just start with something, and considering that any brand now and then issues a lemon.
i hope this has enough paragraphs for you, william.
be gentle.
thanks, everyone, in advance.
