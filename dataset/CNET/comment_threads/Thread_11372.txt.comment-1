Hi - I am looking to run a CAT6 cable from one office to another two via a server cupboard and storage area, a large chunk (30-40m) of this cabling will be outside (in conduit pipes running alongside 240v mains cabling).
Here is a picture of what I propose to do, please ask if anything is unclear.
I am sure something here must be wrong - I need you to tell me what!
