I know about the problem and brought it to the attention of some folks a good ways back.
They didn't believe it until the researched their manuals and saw the tiny asterisks and footnotes.
I'm under the impression it affected earlier boards and or CPUs with early versions of the AMD memory controller.
Here's hoping his problem is remedied by changing the RAM settings in the BIOS.
Speaking of BIOS ...maybe the problem would be cured by a BIOS update or a slight RAM voltage increase.
I went with the 2-1GB DIMMs vs 4-512MB DIMMs and it runs at 400MHz with tighter than average RAM settings.
