My motherboard is a socket 939 and I have very few choices of faster CPUs that I can use.
The MSI manual says I can go up to a 64x2 4800, but I have looked at Tiger Direct, Newegg and a couple others and can't find one.
Also the MSI motherboard can only use DDR 3200 memory and not DDR2.
Bob: Thanks for your information and I think the first thing I will do is add another gig of ram and do the /3GB switch and see if that helps.
Thanks again.
