i moved from 32-bit windows xp to 64-bit vista when it first came out and it worked with al of my hardware.
when i made the move from windows 98 to windows 2000 in college i found that some of my hardware didn't work.
i noticed that all of my hardware that had been sold with the windows logo on it (whql certified) worked fine.
some of the hardware i had picked up from other computer stores didn't.
so after that i figured i would be better off with hardware that was whql certified.
when i made the move from xp to vista all of my whql hardware moved over just find.
additionally my windows certified software all moved fine and had none of those problems with the allow/deny prompts that many people reported.
the whql drivers from xp worked on vista.
overall the transition was smooth.
