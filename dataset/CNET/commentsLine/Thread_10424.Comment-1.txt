i bought this epson stylus cx4700 all in one a week ago.
it can do everything (print, black&white copy, color copy, graysclae scan) epcept color scanning.
when i tried it, it displays the message &quot;cannot properly communicate with the scanner.
make sure the scanner is on, properly connected, andproperly set up to scan.
if using a scsi connection, restart your computer.&quot; (but i have connected it properly for sure!)
then, if i want to use it again, whatever print,scan, or copy, i must turn off and turn it on again to use it.
i thought it might has a problem with the usb.
but i don't sure.
i use microsoft windows xp pro 2002 sp2.
could anyone help me?
thanks.
