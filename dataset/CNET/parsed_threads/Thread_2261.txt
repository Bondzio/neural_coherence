<s> I have a Compaq Presario SR1620NX with an AMD Sempron processor running Windows Vista (did not come with PC). </s>
<s> I am currently running the manufacturers video card which is an ATI Radeon Xpress 200 and I just recently bought Halo 2 for PC and it does not meet the required graphics standards to run it so I am looking to upgrade but I cannot find a decent graphics card that can run on a 250w power supply, that is compatible with windows vista, and that is 512mb. </s>
<s> if you have any suggestions or comments on what i should do or buy they are greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you in advance. </s>
<s> http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/hp-compaq-presario-sr1620nx/1707-3118_7-31589079.html shows what we are working with so this means we have a PCIe slot. </s>
<s> I'm going to give the nod to a GT 240 1GB card such as http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814500138 that's a passively cooled card. </s>
<s> Since I can't guess if that wide a card fits or if there is a good breeze in the system let's find one with a fan. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814500137 Ok, here we have a very nice 1GB card for 54 bucks after rebate. </s>
<s> On my HP d4999t the fanless version of this card and the entire machine pulls 120 Watts on the P3 Watt meter so I didn't have to change the PSU. </s>
<s> That's what I'd get. </s>

<s> I really appreciate that advice I will look into those and pick the best one for my price range. </s>
