it is my guess that, at the least, i fried the logic board of the drive.
at this point, it does not seem to respond to power, period.
so i am buying a used drive - same model, same firmware - and going to try and swap that logic board onto my lacie #1 drive.
question though... what should i hook it up to from there?
can i simply plug the drive into an ata ultra compatible pc, and let the computer try to recognizie it?
because it was a standalone drive in the lacie, is there any kind of boot/partitions configurations on the drive for the lacie, that might cause the pc to not recognize it?
this is beyond my pay grade, but i want to give it a shot, and save the $$$ of having some recovery firm do the work.
thank you!
