I recently Found that my computer would not start up Correctly.
I Could get the HD to run, and everything running, except for the monitor.
I tried 2 diffrent Monitors, along with diffrent graphics cards.
I shut off all power fully, and even unpluged everything.
Then Randomly my father did the same thing i did with flipping the power switch on the powersuply and it started up.
Can anyone tell me what happend?
Should I be worried for the future.
Please respond, thankyou.
