8649	0	40386	473375	NR	Lookie_Mabutt	10/9/04 6:26 PM	1.09734636E12	Home Network Setup	Hi, I've currently got two desktops connected via a switch to an ADSL router, one running XP Home (P4 1.6) and one on XP Pro (P3 1.0). We just bought a Toshiba A70 P4 laptop on XP Home, with wireless network capability. At the same time the salesman suggested a Belkin wireless desktop PCI network card to fit to one of the desktops to act as the connection point for the laptop to the network. I've set this up on the P3, and it says it is running at 11Mbps, and connection status says it is sending packets. The laptop can find the home network via wireless and connection status also says it is sending packets. Neither machine says it is receiving packets though and I'm not sure why. I would have thought if the laptop can identify the network, then it should be able to communicate backwards and forwards between machine. I have currently got WEP etc unselected as I read this could cause set up problems. Any help would be much appreciated.

I've set this up on the P3, &quot; Sadly, I'm unfamiliar with this setup. I'd call your saleperson and ask how to make it work. Usually I just install a wifi router which the DSL/cable connects to and shares the internet to the rest of the machines. best of luck, bob
