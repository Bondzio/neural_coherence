<s> I have a 120GB maxtor external harddive hooked up and in use for a while. </s>
<s> The drive has already been partitioned and has around 40gb of data stored on it. </s>
<s> My PC went in for a repair and a blanket copy had to be made and reinstalled. </s>
<s> The only main difference to the PC was that they installed XP SP2 I'm not sure if this is related to the upgrade but the external hard drive does not apper in &quot;my computer&quot; anymore. </s>
<s> After reading others posts I've checked the device manager and the drive does not appear in their either my C drive show up as being the basic drive. </s>
<s> The only dives that are displayed are... C - Internal harddrive E - Internal CD drive D - Internal DVD drive G - External DVD drive The External drive used to be &quot;H&quot; but it doesnt appear now. </s>
<s> The drive did not come with a driver as its plug and play and worked fine when I first installed it this way. </s>
<s> The USB icon appears in my tray when I connect it and states that the device is working properly. </s>
<s> When I click on the USB icon in the tray to stop a device, and then on &quot;mass storage device&quot; in the pop up window, it displays the drive there &quot;eg maxtor 6 USB device, so the pc must recognise it. </s>
<s> can anyone help please, I'm at my wits end... </s>
<s> If so, it can hide drive letters. </s>
<s> Look up TWEAKUI and use that to see if drive letters are hidden. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for your quick reply Bob I downloaded TWEAKUI from... http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx I ran it selected drives the external hard drive is not on the list, it used to be drive H. See screenshot:- http://xs28.xs.to/pics/05190/TweakUI.JPG The dive appears in the device manager see screenshot - http://xs28.xs.to/pics/05190/DeviceManager.JPG but does not appear in the disk management see screenshot - http://xs28.xs.to/pics/05190/DiskManagement.JPG Any ideas? </s>
<s> Completely shutdown? </s>
<s> That is, shutdown and remove all power from all devices and power bricks for a 10 count and try again? </s>
<s> How about plugging that into another USB port? </s>
<s> Some discover some ports will not work, but report &quot;OK&quot;. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ok Bob, I completely shutdown and unplugged everything then booted back up. </s>
<s> The external hard drive still doesn't appear in 'my computer' I have an external DVD drive that shows up, so I swapped the plugs, connecting the external HD to that USB port. </s>
<s> Like the other port, again the PC responds when I connect it,& the 'safely remove icon' appeares in the system tray. </s>
<s> When you click on the 'safely remove icon', it asks if you want to stop the external hard drive so the USB port must be working. </s>
<s> view screenshot - http://xs404.xs.to/pics/05190/stopusbdevice.JPG It does say &quot;location 0&quot; would that have something to do with it? </s>
<s> You need to test the drive on another machine and if it behaves the same, time to call its maker to get it exchanged. </s>
<s> In closing, you may have read my statement about such devices not being a backup system... Bob </s>
<s> The drive is only 3 months old, although it does have 90/120GB stored on it. </s>
<s> It seems more of a PC problem than a hard drive problem it would be a shame to format it only to find out the PC still wont read it. </s>
<s> From the info and the screenshots I've given previously would anyone be able to point me in the right direction of a driver download? </s>
<s> I think reinstalling the driver may work?? </s>
<s> its worth a try. </s>
<s> Bob, is this problem unique to problems you've help with before? </s>
<s> It just seems like theres something silly I'm missing out somewhere.........??? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> It doesn't show in the disk management tool. </s>
<s> The problem is not unique. </s>
<s> Such devices fail all the time. </s>
<s> Again, such a device is not &quot;backup.&quot; Don't entrust what you can't lose to a hard disk. </s>
<s> AND... a test is needed on another PC to call out where the issue is. </s>
<s> I know where my bet is. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have a Medea external videoraid unit that has strangely *disappeared* from explorer as well, but it shows as working normally in the device mgr. </s>
<s> I too don't know what else to try. </s>
<s> Can't access the data without the raid controller as it is striped on the two drives. </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> On your backup tape, CD or DVDs. </s>
<s> I'm not kidding. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sometimes, the external encasement connections fail. </s>
<s> I had an external drive that suddenly lost connection and wasn't recognized by My Computer or the Disk Management. </s>
<s> I purchased a new external case, took out the hard drive and connected it to the new case, and voila! </s>
<s> Instant recognition, and my 100G of data was still there and safe. </s>
<s> I have a question for Bob, if you're still following this! </s>
<s> Bob, how DO you suggest to backup if you say that hard drives are a bad idea? </s>
<s> I have had just as many problems with DVDs that &quot;fail&quot; and suddenly lose data. </s>
<s> I have followed discussions about this as well, data that people thought were on their DVDs &quot;forever&quot; and suddenly all is lost, or the drive won't read the DVD, etc. </s>
<s> Is there a REAL backup solution? </s>
<s> I have many levels of backup. </s>
<s> Sadly it does take time to do this so I fit it inbetween and as part of my PC usage. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> CDRW/DVDRW disks contain a set of what I need to move to a new machine. </s>
<s> NO OS or applications are needed since I have the install CDs plus those have a copy. </s>
<s> A total of 3 sets are rotated and as some media fails, it gets replaced. </s>
<s> This is cheap compared to just a few years ago. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Next in line is an USB hard disk. </s>
<s> Nice for quick backups that I don't want or need to refresh that DVDRW set (I used to use CDRW, but DVDRW is just so many less disks.) </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> A smaller set of files is sent off to my mini-server that is running OpenSSH or a secure shell server. </s>
<s> This contains my core works that I can't lose and photos. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Further down the list are my set of OS CDs, applications CDs. </s>
<s> All the originals and CDKEYS are in a package far away from the computers. </s>
<s> A copy of these are in my recovery kit. </s>
<s> I use my recovery kit first and if one of these CDRs fail, I can go get the original to duplicate it again and refresh the recovery. </s>
<s> This happened once so the system works. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> The take it with me plan. </s>
<s> I recently acquired an 1 GB USB memory key. </s>
<s> On it are the items that I don't want to lose if I was away from home and the home vanished. </s>
<s> While I can't carry my photos there, key works and such are on it. </s>
<s> Some may consider this extreme but they may not have suffered a total wipeout yet. </s>
<s> Or watched others lose it all. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Had the same problem with a generic USB drive case from TigerDirect with an old WD hard drive inside it. </s>
<s> It was being recognized only intermittently which was making me crazy. </s>
<s> Some days XP saw it, some days no. </s>
<s> Removing the USB connector from the USB hub, and then putting it into a new different port on the hub did not help the computer recognize the external USB drive. </s>
<s> But disconnecting the external drive from its power supply, and then disconnecting and reconnecting the USB cable at the external drive (with the computer on) led to XP SP2 seeing it and assigning a drive letter in Explorer. </s>
<s> I dont remember if I reconnected the power supply or the USB cable at the external drive first, but it was nice to see it back in action. </s>
<s> I am having the same problem with a LaCie 250 gig drive. </s>
<s> It does seem to be related to SP2. </s>
<s> Just to take this to another level of weirdness, Mac OSX mounts this same drive and regognizes the files eventhough it can't do anything with them as they were written on a Windows PC </s>
<s> i can't see it but when i restart the red light flashes like its trying to do something but nothing happens. </s>
<s> i have a feeling its case and i have 2 of them so i am probably going switch them and see if it works. </s>
<s> who knows tho. </s>

<s> Use USB 2.0 on the PC and Firewire on the Apple for hard disks. </s>

<s> Bob </s>
<s> My 120gb external hard drive works on Windows 98 but not Windows XP SP2. </s>
<s> At times the drive gets detected and then suddenly it vanishes. </s>
<s> If you have sorted out your problem do please help me out. </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> I have the same problem with my external HD, and after reading through this thread I've not seen a solution so far. </s>
<s> My external HD is recognised and listed in My Computer intermitently and rarely seems to work long enough to transfer a file of more than a few Mb's. </s>
<s> It does work on a PowerBook/OS X so I figure the External HD Enclosure or the HDD is not at fault (though the sound the HD makes sometimes when it's not working you'd think it was knackered). </s>
<s> If it's SP2 that's got issues, does anyone know of a patch or something to fix this? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Firewire hard disk support does work for most people, just not everyone. </s>
<s> Since USB 2.0 on a good machine with proper drivers and XP SP2 is dead stable, what fix would be needed? </s>
<s> You will find some dead drives or USB external cases, but since swapping the drive or case fixes it, how can you pin the blame on Windows? </s>
<s> If firewire, then all I can write is you didn't take the advice. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yeah, my external HD enclosure is USB 2.0, not firewire. </s>
<s> Just trying to find some conclusion to this thread and I think you made it! </s>
<s> I'll check my drivers - not that it should need them. </s>
<s> Failing that I'll get another IDE cable and put the HD in my computer! </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Get this, I have some Generic Brand of 120GB External Hard Drive and I'm having the same problems at my job. </s>
<s> It's not an admin thing, but it doesn't work on one PC in the Computer Area, with all similar reaction to the External Hard Drive with Windows 2000 Pro. </s>
<s> In the Back computers, we have XP and it pops up and appears just fine and all that. </s>
<s> It just doesn't make sense why you can't locate it at all... </s>
<s> Given what we know about that machine it could be USB 1.1 or missing drivers that Microsoft doesn't supply. </s>
<s> Your post and details about the machine are too light. </s>
<s> I'll write it won't and shouldn't work. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have this common bug too. </s>
<s> Long story, it says the drive letters get mixed up with what is mapped and what is temporary trying to squeeze in so it isn't seen most of the time. </s>
<s> Go to disk management (removeable drive, or somewhere) and reassign a drive letter to your external drive that you aren't going to be using regularly. </s>
<s> That's reasonable enough, except you can't do it when your drive doesn't show up there. </s>
<s> Thanks Microsoft. </s>
<s> I've got several USB 2.0 external HDDs ... the main one's are enclosed in Adaptec enclosures ... ACS-100 (3.5&quot; HDDs)and ACS-120 (2.5&quot; HDD). </s>
<s> The systems I've connected them to have all been Win2K and to date I've never had any problems with any of them. </s>
<s> Primary use is storing extra copy of image files (made with Ghost 2003) off my home system's 2nd HDD and to transfer copies of critical data directories from my work PC to work on at home. </s>
<s> Reading all these problems, failures, etc., are making feel lucky and glad I'm still using Win2K VAPCMD </s>
<s> First back up your files to another drive because either you will have to reformat the drive or send it for repair/exchange. </s>
<s> To back up files-recover there is a great program I used to back up my maxtor 300gb with the same problem, it is not free but it is worth the money, it will cost you around $50.00, you can only use it on one computer so after you install it make a disk back up, reinstalling it again it will not work(they are smart), nevertheless they have a great customer service on the phone!! </s>
<s> Go to www.quetek.com, buy it ( file scavenger) and in hours you will back you whole drive before you format it, I used it twice alredy and did not loose any files. </s>
<s> After you install it you will be able to see your drive from within the program and copy it to another location, 150GB took the program around 7 hours. </s>
<s> Maxtors are pron to this, to avopid this make sure that you go to computer management/disk management/then go down the second window where you will see the rectangular boxes withthe disc leters and names, rigth click on the disk you want to check, go to properties/policies and make sura that the box that say enable write caching on the disk is not checked. </s>
<s> Maxtor external dont work well on this if there is a power failure at any point even if you dont notice it. </s>
<s> I hope this helps!!! </s>

<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> What about disk management. </s>
<s> Bob, Very nice setup. </s>
<s> I have somewhat of the same approach, but do not use any &quot;plastic&quot; media, only hard drives. </s>
<s> Have 2x250 GB drives inside PC case for quick and dirty backups (no mirroring but use SyncToy to backup everything that is important - inclusing all written down &quot;keys&quot; in Excel sheets). </s>
<s> Will soon add another 300GB drive and make these 2x250 drives as a RAID I. </s>
<s> All this data is mirrored about once a week onto my wife's computer, in a different room, where it lands onto her D-drive (2nd disk). </s>
<s> Outside of this, we have 2x80 GB USB drives that are stored in the basement and one 120GB hard drive that is stored at the bank in a safe deposit box. </s>
<s> About once every month, that drive is taken home to be &quot;re-freshed&quot;. </s>
<s> Is this anal? </s>
<s> Possibly so, but I did have a hard drive crash (on a laptop) in 2004 and after that I rather go a bit too far since storage today is cheap. </s>
<s> Microsoft's SyncToy is also a pretty handy and fast tool for setting up small backup routines. </s>
<s> And, it's free! </s>
<s> I have a partially corrupt external drive that I recently formatted, and when trying to merge the 2 existing partitions into 1 there was an error. </s>
<s> Now My Computer does not show the drive anymore, but Device Manager does... Eh... </s>
<s> TweakUI did have the drive unchecked. </s>
<s> Checked and after hours of trying to solve there it was. </s>

<s> Amazingly simple. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Same thing is happening to me. </s>
<s> I bought a Maxtor 3100 last year. </s>

<s> By the way, they were assigned different letters. </s>
<s> The Maxtor icon next to the clock states that it is working properly. </s>
<s> Baloney! </s>
<s> I have the same problem, except that it works fine in my laptop, but not in my desktop and although it appears in Device Manager, it does not appear in either Disk management or My Computer. </s>

<s> Hi everybody. </s>
<s> Here is the solution. </s>
<s> In most cases the problem is in MBR (Master Boot Record) created in your drive's MBR sector by OS you had before upgrade or patch with service pack etc. </s>
<s> So, basically what we need to do to get our HDD back to life is to write the MBR signature (the Hex Word 0xAA55) to your drive's MBR sector. </s>
<s> It is easy to do. </s>

<s> Well I was having the same problems as most of you have had and had a somewhat interesting break through without a reasonable explanation. </s>
<s> I was using a Seagate 120Gb hard drive in my external drive and was getting the same system responce as the first guy. </s>
<s> I tried every thing except reformatting. </s>
<s> (Its a used drive off of a Dish Dvr player) I had no idea what to do. </s>
<s> So I tried another drive off of a different computer. </s>
<s> And bingo, it started right up! </s>
<s> The only question that I have is with the Seagate. </s>
<s> Do you think that the reason that it is not running is that it needs to reformatted? </s>

<s> This only occurs on my computer which has Windows SP2 & Dot NET 2.0 framework. </s>
<s> Did it work? </s>
<s> Hi all, I had this same problem and here is my solution that worked for me, and maybe others? </s>
<s> 1.) </s>
<s> First is the order in which the drive is connected. </s>
<s> Connect the power to the drive, then the USB cable to the drive, then the cable to the USB port. </s>
<s> 2.) </s>
<s> First time the drive was plugged into the computer it came up as mass storage devie but nothing under windows explorer or computer management (but was there under device manager) 3.) </s>
<s> Safely remove the device, then reconnect it. </s>
<s> 4.) </s>
<s> If this hasn't done the trick, go into device manager and uninstall both the disk under disk drives, and the USB device under usb devices. </s>
<s> 5.) </s>
<s> Now seach for changes in hardware (Button at the top of device manager). </s>
<s> This should find the drive and name it accordingly. </s>
<s> 6.) </s>
<s> The next problem I found was i couldnt edit or read any of the files. </s>
<s> Later found this to be due to the drive not having enough free space for windows to write its necessary information. </s>
<s> Hope this helps some people atleast, sure got me going with my cheap Chinese USB to IDE cable. </s>

<s> If not.... suggest removing the hard disk drive (HDD) from the external enclosure and verifying if it is or isn't spinning up. </s>

<s> If it powers up ... then shut down the PC, connect it to the data cable and jumper it as a secondary NOT PRIMARY BOOTABLE DRIVE and see if the system recognizes it. </s>
<s> If recognized, you might be able to copy your data to another hard drive in the desktop system. </s>

<s> Four maxtor 300 GB crashed so far on me, the last one did not power up and I had over 200 gb of customer photos there, I opened the case and plug it to my computer, great, now I can see all my work. </s>
<s> I got them from Costco, I took them back and got the new 500 gb western digital $ 279.00, no problems so far, it turns on when I power my computer and turns off by it self when I shut down the computer. </s>
<s> I have a maxtor 200 and a 160 for over 4 years, no problems. </s>
<s> The 300 are an abomination!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> I have a Maxtor 80 GB drive with all of the problems listed above. </s>
<s> All I had to do in the end to get it to work was to set the drive to master using the jumpers and than it instantly worked. </s>
<s> Hi Jacob, I got the same problem. </s>
<s> I want to work on according to your suggestion. </s>
<s> But could you please give me some details like how to make that drive as master using the jumpers. </s>
<s> Mine is LAPTOP with XP software. </s>
<s> Thanks Rao </s>
<s> To change the jumpers, you'll need to look at the documentation that came with your HD. </s>
<s> The jumper settings on my Maxtor were printed on the HD itself, but I had to look on the manufacturer's web site to find that info for some of my older drives. </s>
<s> It's drive specific, so unfortunately I cannot provide any further guidance. </s>
<s> Hi Jacob, Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> I checked the manuals and the product web site. </s>
<s> I didn't get any information about the jumpers. </s>
<s> I purchased Beyond Micro external 250GB HD from tigerdirect online store 15 days back. </s>
<s> I planned to use this as my backup for my all important documents and movies, songs. </s>
<s> I copied every thing into this. </s>
<s> it worked fine for 6 days. </s>
<s> On 7th day I didn't find these drives on my computer. </s>
<s> I tried all possibilities but couldn't get any luck. </s>
<s> My concerned is I copied important documents in this from my internal hard drive and deleted those from my internal for space problem. </s>
<s> Now I didn't have any backup copies of these files. </s>
<s> Could you please help me with some kind of solution to get those files back. </s>
<s> Thanks and appreciated your help. </s>
<s> Rao </s>
<s> JAMHAY, Have you gone to DEVICE MANAGER to see if you have a conflict (exclamation point in a yellow, inverted triangle)? </s>
<s> If there is a 'conflict' delete that USB driver for your external drive and then go to ADD HARDWARE and let your PC search and find this device. </s>
<s> In doing this process it will add the driver back to this USB connection. </s>
<s> I learned this process from the Western-Digital website (www.support.wdc.com) for my ADAPTEC USB 2.0 h.d. </s>
<s> enclosure case. </s>
<s> And it worked very well. </s>
<s> So, you could go to W-D or Maxtor's Tech Support and possible find the same information to correct your problem. </s>
<s> Hope this helps your frustration, Kevin </s>
<s> This was actually a problem that I caused, and reading some of the posts to this sent me in the right direction, so I hope I am not repeating any one. </s>
<s> Basically, I usually keep my Lacie HD off, until I need to do my backups, (I also back up to tape once in a while), during the week I created another map to a network drive, and used the drive assignment letter ''G'', which had alway been my Lacie drive assignment. </s>
<s> So when I went and turned on my Lacie drive last Friday, nothing happened! </s>
<s> I thought it would just find the next available drive letter, but it did not. </s>
<s> When I reasigned the newly mapped drive from last week and freed up ''G'' again, after a reboot and then turning on the HD drive, Explorer recognised it again. </s>
<s> Hope this too helps. </s>
<s> Thanks very very much...great solution.....I wasted about two days and finally your solution helped me out.... </s>
<s> I am having the same issue and I just downloaded and searched through TweakUI to do the click thing and I can't find the drives to click or unclick....Help? </s>
<s> After I downloaded and ran the above program I had to do something else: Start --&gt;Run---&gt;CMD At the dos prompt type chkdsk /f E: Enter And Voila my external drive was back to normal. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> NB: E: is the drive letter associated with my ext drive. </s>
<s> I am not a Technician. </s>
<s> I just played around with the hardware and everything is now working fine. </s>
<s> 1/ I turned off my computer at the powerpoint. </s>
<s> 2/ I attached the Maxtor II hard-drive to the USB port of the non-powered computer and turned the Maxtor on. </s>
<s> 3/ I then turned the computer on at the powerpoint and started it up 4/ Voila! </s>
<s> Windows recognised the 'new' hardware and I was off and running. </s>
<s> I can't explain how this worked I just know that it did when all else failed. </s>
<s> I disconnected the Maxtor and tried it again and it failed to work. </s>
<s> So in the meantime I found an alternative power supply lead, plugged it into the maxtor and it is now being recognised by windows. </s>
<s> It would seem that in my circumstance the problem was power related. </s>
<s> Good Luck </s>
<s> Hi I did all steps but at the end the program doesnt' show me the option &quot;write&quot; onlin load backup and add partition, what can I do? </s>
<s> thank you mg </s>
<s> I have been advised that the problem may be due to the USB connection. </s>
<s> I have a 1.1. connection and an expert has advised me that the External Hard Drive requires 2.0 USB connection. </s>
<s> Could the solution be as simple as this? </s>
<s> I have an external hard drive and had the same problem - it was working fine and then all of a sudden not recognized by my computer. </s>
<s> I downloaded the utility and THOUGHT i followed instructions, but when I rebooted, there are a bunch of folders on my drive that don't appear to have my data. </s>
<s> What did I do wrong and is it fixable? </s>
<s> Thanks, Shelly </s>
<s> I have the similar problem, I bought an external drive an my computer does not recognize it at all. </s>
<s> I just want to have some extra storage area. </s>
<s> Start Control Panel switch to classic view Administrative Tools Computer Management Disk Managment The drive should be on the bottom right click Pick the choice you want hope this hellps </s>
<s> I have a 120 GB external hard drive and it used to work fine. </s>
<s> But yesterday when i plugged it in windows xp made a sound ( the one it usually makes when i plug smthng in) but when i open my computer it doesnt show it there. </s>
<s> Actually when the device is plugged in it cannot open my computer properly. </s>
<s> I can see the the device on safely remove hardware but cannot safely remove it because it says it is being used by another program. </s>
<s> I can also see the disk in device manager but when i click disk management when the thing is plugged on windows cant open it, it gets stuck and i have to use windows task manager to end the program. </s>
<s> Also when I plug in the external hard drive my computer seems to slow down and it gets much faster as soon as i plug it out. </s>
<s> I think 90 GB of the 120 GB disk is full. </s>
<s> And the information in it is very important for me. </s>
<s> My hard disk is 80GB and 70 GB's of it is full. </s>
<s> Can these have something to do with it? </s>
<s> Can someone out there please help me? </s>
<s> Thanks Note: Checked it on my friends PC opened. </s>
<s> Unlike what it did in my pc her pc opened my computer but didnt show the device. </s>
<s> It used to show it a s two pieces on F: and G: </s>
<s> Instead you buried your unique problem in a big thread. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sorry i am new to the forum </s>
<s> You have confused the issue. </s>
<s> Please resubmit a succinct summary of your concerns. </s>
<s> Add the type of platform you run eg. </s>
<s> XP Home;XP Pro. </s>
<s> Two things are evident from your post 1: you are running close to the bone with too little available space on your Desktop (as well as the external drive)2:Some data you risk losing, is important for you. </s>
<s> Whatever the cause of your difficulty,you may be able to place the 80GB external drive in either your own desktop PC or a friends and transfer necessary files etc to another Hard disc or to cd/dvd backup. </s>
<s> If necessary, (if eg. </s>
<s> you already run 4 drives),temporarily substitute your external drive for a CD/DVD drive( so long as you have sufficient space to store data you can write the backups after you return the CD/DVD to the original home. </s>
<s> Hope I havent confused you. </s>
<s> I recently experienced the exact same problem as jamhay, word for word, detail for detail, which is what brought me to this post. </s>
<s> I did everything suggested and couldn't get my computer to access the external hard drive, even though in the system tray the computer recognized that an external device was indeed attached. </s>
<s> After having tried everything and at my wit's end as well, I tried changing my cables. </s>
<s> When I changed the USB cable, everything worked perfectly. </s>
<s> I didn't consider checking for a faulty USB cable as the system tray was able to recognize that a device was plugged in, but changing it did the trick. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> I recently bought a Seagate 40gb 2.0 USB external hard drive to use on my laptop for saving audio files. </s>
<s> It says that it is plug and play and does not require anything but XP to find the driver. </s>
<s> My setup is not top notch but will do. </s>
<s> Toshiba laptop, XP Pro SP One, PIII, 512mb ram, and I added a PCMCIA USB 2.0 cardBus to upgrade from the 1.1 that's in the back of the laptop. </s>
<s> When I first plugged the ext. </s>
<s> drive in I got a &quot;this device is not working properly&quot; message in the lower right hand corener but it did recognize it. </s>
<s> Then when I went to investigate in the device manager it was there with the yellow exclamation point and said that the drivers weren't installed. </s>
<s> So I updated the drivers but the ones installed were the best for the device. </s>
<s> When I went back a page to the properties it said &quot;this device cannot start - code 10&quot;. </s>
<s> So that WAS/IS(?) </s>
<s> the problem to be solved. </s>
<s> I tried to restart and try again. </s>
<s> The drive won't even be recognized now unless I put it in the slow 1.1 usb and not the 2.0. </s>
<s> I still get the same messages when I look at the properties in the device manager too and it won't work. </s>
<s> The 2.0 still won't recognize it as it did the first time I plugged it in. </s>
<s> I don't think it's a power problem. </s>
<s> The PCMCIA is powered to 5VDC like it should be and it comes with a power cord to plug it in the 1.1 slot for extra juice if you need it and according to the hard drive I do not. </s>
<s> I also tried plugging it into the wall using another power cord. </s>
<s> No luck. </s>
<s> Also tried it on another computer that only had the 1.1 and it recognized it but same device properties amd problems. </s>
<s> Sorry for the manifesto but I'd really like to get this fixed. </s>
<s> Todd </s>
<s> If this is still a problem link to http://www.uwe-sieber.de/usbdlm_e.html and download USBDML. </s>
<s> Also follow the instructions closely. </s>
<s> This will not solve your problem completely but will at least let you see your drive in Computer Management (CM). </s>
<s> From there you can explore the drive and do some of the other suggestions people came up with. </s>
<s> I suggest once you access the drive in CM create a map to change drive letter paths and creating /add/ create new folder. </s>
<s> You will be able to see you drive in explorer under the new folder. </s>
<s> Cheese but it works. </s>
<s> Wow, I'd tried about everything and then used your sequence. </s>
<s> Essentially, turn off case, disconnect P/S and disconnect USB cable. </s>
<s> I then plugged in USB cable, plugged power supply back into the back of the enclosure, turned it on and my computer found it. </s>
<s> As usual, it was on my network &quot;F&quot; drive, but that was an easy drive letter change. </s>
<s> HI I've been reading what you've all said and here is how I solved my external disk drive not being fully recognised problem. </s>
<s> THE SOLUTION IS TOWARDS THE END UNDER THE HEADING SOLUTION. </s>
<s> THE PROBLEM IS HERE ____________________________ I included the problem so that you can check if your difficulties are similar to mine. </s>
<s> You don't neccesarily have to read this part. </s>
<s> It may be best to just read the solution first and then check to see if the problem I had is similar to yours and therefore the solution I found maybe worth trying. </s>
<s> Just a quick preview of the difficulties I had: I have two computers running windows 2000 Pro. </s>
<s> I am also install on partitions. </s>
<s> My external drive is an akasa integral esata 3.5 hard drive enclosure with seperate power supply. </s>
<s> It can take ide sata and esata 3.5 inch drives. </s>
<s> ( fyi not relevant but...I chose this because I currently have ide hard drives but will eventually upgrade to sata. </s>
<s> Also I bought a sata drive by mistake when I was just starting out in computing. </s>
<s> when I upgrade the large ide drive I now have goes in the enclosure UC. </s>
<s> Also the external power supply is a must, I can't get enough power to my HD ( or practically anythingh else )using my laptops USB 2 ports) I installed the sata drive and powered it up connected it up to my desktop all was lovely. </s>
<s> It worked I formated it in disc manager (go to &gt;admin tools &gt;computer manager) and set up two partitions ( probably one partition to many but old habit etc). </s>
<s> I installed the hard drive on the second partition of my laptop and the hard drive worked fine. </s>
<s> I then installed the hard drive on the first partition of my laptop. </s>
<s> That was when the problems started. </s>
<s> First It would install and recogise it under &quot;device manager&quot; but &quot;my computer&quot; said it as an unpartitioned unused unformated disk drive ( althout curiously got the assigned drive letter correct). </s>
<s> The drive was NOT recognized by disk manager. </s>
<s> The drive WAS however recognised as a &quot;usb mass storage device&quot; in unplug eject hardware icon. </s>
<s> I tried all know possible combination of switching it on of unplugging and rebooting and still couldn't get the thing to work for me. </s>
<s> I checked that the machine was still working on my desktop and yess that was still fine so it wasn't the drive. </s>
<s> well you know what they say ... </s>
<s> IF all else fails read the manual - checked the manual , I'd played it by the book so all should be fine. </s>
<s> check the microsoft website and nothing worthwhile, checked with the correct akasa website ( fyi - I checked www.akasa.com and got nothing, turns out the proper site address www.akasa.com.tw ( and not /tw either) someone is doing some really lame ad based cyber squating which I think is deceptive, low and pathetic) Theres an new updated version of the manual and it says that you've got make sure the jumper pins set the drive as master. </s>
<s> ----------------------------------------- SO THE SOLUTION - SET THE JUMPER PINS TO MASTER I solved the problem by setting the jumper pins on the sata drive in the hard drive enclosure to master. </s>
<s> one last thing If you have never set jumper pins before don't worry its the easy to do. </s>
<s> You will need to consult the manual for your hard drive. </s>
<s> Which you should be able to find over the internet. </s>
<s> Because the drive I am using was SATA the manual didn't mention anything about setting the jumper pins for master and slave. </s>
<s> However it did have something about setting the jumper pins for master and slave on a nearly identical PATA ( or ide) model. </s>
<s> The jumper setting were thankfully the same for sata as they were for IDE. </s>
<s> The drive is working again and I am happy. </s>
<s> I hope this helps JAGWAPAT (JUST ANOTHER GEEK WITH A PC AND TOO much TIME) </s>

<s> Hello: Im new to the forums and Im hoping that I can find a solution here for a problem I have. </s>
<s> I bought a Simpletech external hard drive (the ones designed by Pininfarina)a few months ago, 250 GBs. </s>
<s> It used to work fine with no problems, but recently the system stopped displaying the information stored in it, first it wouldnt recognize the hard drive, then it did, but when it did, after a small while I had to restart the drive because I couldnt look at the info in it, and finally the system detects the hard drive, marks how much space is used and left, but anything stored in folders wont be displayed at all. </s>
<s> Ive tried the following: Restoring the system Reinstalling the HD's controller Changing USB cables and ports Checking the disc for errors (at phase 4 it failed for some reason) Checking the system for virus and antispyware Checking the hard drive in other computer (works fine in other computer) I mailed Simpletech for support, but I would like to know if someone here has experienced the same problem and managed to solve it, as far as I can tell, its a system problem, not a hard drive problem, but then again, I could be wrong. </s>
<s> The HD had a IEEE 1394a Fireware interface, Im running on Windows XP Home Edition 2002 SP2. </s>
