But a good (albeit somewhat oldfashioned, slow and low capacity) way to transfer files between machines that don't have Internet or USB. All you can try: read the diskette on your laptop and see if that recognizes it. That's not impossible, although unlikely. Then transfer the data using mail or USB-stick. This is the umpteenth (if not more) proof that having data on one place only is an invitation to the gods of IT to destroy it and lose it. Kees

There are some worms that alter the boot area of floppies and you get this sort of complaint. But if new diskettes work fine and diskettes from other machines are fine but not from this laptop then you found the problem.
