8904	0	107195	1222928	NR	teseries	6/3/05 8:38 AM	1.11778788E12	Emachines T6212	I recently bought a emachines and was thinking of upgrading the graphics to the x700 pro, when you install the graphics card do you have to disable the onboard graphics first, and i was also wondering if i would notice a difference in upgrading the memory to 1gb, right now it only has 512mb? thanks

Your machine should then use a generic display until you install the new card. Also, since 128 MB is dedicated to onboard graphics on the T6212, disabling it will free up the memory so right away you'll have 512 MB. If you do add memory, don't make the mistake I made and do the following; (1) check eMachines website for recommended memory (they recommend Crucial, Kingston, Geil and a few others) and (2) MAKE SURE TO BUY THE MEMORY IN PAIRS. The mistake I made with the T6212 was buying a 1 GB stick. The memory only registered as 1.25 GB instead of the expected 1.5 GB. The documentation tells you this, but who ever reads that stuff?! Good luck!
