&quot;i do have a usb 2 device and i do receive a message that it will work better in a faster port.
where thet at?????
i have 2 ports on the front and 4 on the back, i've tried other devices in all of them and get the same message for everthing.
could it be some weird thing with a driver?
one possible option would be if i could get the pci device to work right, i have one that gives me a front panel with 5 usb and 3 firewire ports.
i cannot get it to work since i had to reinstall xp, xp installed drivers and it won't update to the oem drivers.&quot; i see you tried all the ports, but as i read the last sentance it becomes clear to me the person who installed the os is relying on microsoft to update the drivers.
this will never happen.
you or that person need to find the usb 2.0 (and motherboard) support package for your system and install it.
you've found the cause of this issue!
more at  i'd give up a link to your motherboard driver package but i missed it if you posted the required information.
