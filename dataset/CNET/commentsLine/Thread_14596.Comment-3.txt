thanks bob.
just checking - so i can replace a wired hub with a, say linksys wrt54g, router (even tho i currently use dial-up and won't use broadband or dsl access; the wired network is only used basically for back-ups) and will be able to 'talk' to the other wired hub and all other wired computers via wirewless from my new wi-fi enabled laptop via the router ?
regards, tom
