ddr3 is better than ddr2, plain and simple.
let's not get into the specs but if you check them its more visible.
just don't be so engrossed that's its that much better by leaps and bounds.
expect some improvement but as already explained its also boils down to the actual config of the pc setup.
its still best to mount in matched pairs to really benefit.
overall, you're better off having ddr3 as its the latest ram out there and you can add to it as time goes by.
