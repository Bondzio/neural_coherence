1.1.1	If you notice, most folks are recommending buying/building a new computer.	St
1.1.2	All of the replies are giving you pretty good reasons why.	St
1.1.3	Here's another one: Windows ME is going to the 'non-supported' status in the very near future (if not already)... and even supported, it can be a 'bear' to work with when it has issues (which is often).	St
