I've usually mentioned in posts, many a burner lasts a yr. or expect problems if used alot.
Your expections should revolve around that.
As for keeping it usable longer, there's only a good blow-out of any collected(every now and then, 1x in a month) dust and a CD cleaner.
That's it.
Sony, makes a decent burner as well as Philips and Plextor are tops to me.
Any other brand while good or sufficient may not last any longer but may die sooner, so paying a few extra $ now goes for a happier user expereience.
I no longer even try to repair or resolve many s/w glitches but quickly replace burner to see if that cures things and usually 9 out of 10X does.
Older burners tend to last longer oinly because the default burning speeds were slower and generally &quot;settle down&quot; and do thier tasks within specs as things got faster, burning tasks became harder so in some cases reducing &quot;burn speed&quot; can help resolve some errors until it truly wears out.
