Usually there's a specific address you type into your browser like 192.168.xxx.yyy to access the router.
Once there you'll be prompted for the admin ID and password.
After signing in you'll get a menu of options that will be documented in the router's user guide.
They differ from one make and model, so you'll just have to look and see where the option is, but it's usually not that hard to find - you can often just browse through the half dozen or so menus and stumble across it.
` Good luck.
