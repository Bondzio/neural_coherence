I have a desktop running Vista, 2 laptops running Windows 7 and a laptop running XP. I had a home network where we could all share files and printers using my Linksys router. I had to purchase a new router yesterday and now the Windows 7 laptops are not accessible from my Vista desktop. The XP is accessible, but when I try to view files in the Windows 7 laptops it tells me &quot;Windows cannot access this XXXXXX.&quot; I called Netgear for help since it is brand new but they will not help unless I purchase a extended contract.
