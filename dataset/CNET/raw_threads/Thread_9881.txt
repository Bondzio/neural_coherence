But that can be easily found on newegg, by searching only for certain types. Noise levels, well there are basically only antec cases that are the most silent. Antec sonata, and P180. As for ventilation, well, doesn't make a difference unless they don't have a place for fans. the psu with case, well you can always buy your own. So the only thing that you can use to choose a case is by personal preference, brand name, price. Roger
