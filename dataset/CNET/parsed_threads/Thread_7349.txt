<s> I am trying water cooling for the first time and something weird is happening. </s>
<s> My loop is working fine and I am using a T-line to fill it. </s>
<s> It is full and almost bubble free however when I turn the pump off the water level rises a little bit in the filling tube. </s>
<s> Does anyone know why the water level might rise when I turn the pump off? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> When the pump is on, something is expanding in volume a little. </s>
<s> NORMAL for plastics and tubing. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Water is not compressible (let's accept that for a moment) but there is some note from you that it's almost bubble free so any bubble can be compressed. </s>
<s> Are you fretting over this a bit too much? </s>
<s> I mean, does it work? </s>

<s> Well the loop is &quot;working&quot; but it is also not cooling very well. </s>
<s> In fact it is cooling the same as my air setup. </s>
<s> The water coming out of the radiator feels just as hot as the water going in. </s>
<s> Might this be due to air bubbles? </s>
<s> It's the heat connection from the CPU to the whatever it is parts. </s>
<s> Remember there are no part numbers, pictures or numbers here. </s>
<s> One member had a CPU at 30C and was concerned when a new cooler didn't make it cooler. </s>
<s> Hard to tell them it was fine. </s>

<s> My load temp on both air and cooling is 61C 2which is hot for a phenom II. </s>
<s> I am using an OCZ Hydroflow CPUblock, a Swiftech 120mm fan, and my pump is a DangerDen CPX Pro. </s>
<s> My old air cooler was a Coolermaster Hyper 212 Plus. </s>
<s> I don't think it is the connection to the waterblock because it feels hot which would imply that heat is being transferred. </s>
<s> NO PICTURES means no one can check your work. </s>
<s> If the water is getting to 61C then it's the cooler portion that needs work. </s>
<s> Basic understanding of heat transfer is needed. </s>
<s> But no pictures means folk can only guess the water is hot but the cooler is not where air can flow. </s>
