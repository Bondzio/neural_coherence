after instaling a maxtor one touch 4 plus 750 and the software i have issues.
i had to reset my folders they were not set up the way i had them, (when i go to open any off my drives the search pannel comes up on the left) i use to open my drives and go to my items, how can i change that back to when i open the drives it will go to the items and so i do not have to seach for them.
so far a nightmare with this drive i got today.
thank you for any help: wendell h
