<s> i had another topic going and someone told me i need a new psu to run my graphics card. </s>
<s> they said i need a 350w i have a gateway 506GR can some one tell me what type of power supply i need or possible give me a link to one </s>
<s> But keep in mind the GATEWAY specs shows your system has 300W PSU http://support.gateway.com/s/PC/R/3724/4367cl2.shtml System requirements for the video card you installed specifies 350W PSU http://www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp?product_code=338367&Pn=GeForce_7300_GS_Video_Card Best to start with info, specifically the part number, off the PSU. </s>
<s> It will help you determine what physical size the PSU is. </s>

<s> this is the gateway PN 102015 dont know if there is another part number i am wondering if this won will work because it says its for a Micro ATX and that what gateway classifies mine as http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817338009 </s>
<s> Dimensions - 5.5 x 5.9 x 3.4 - Inches. </s>
<s> Many many options...here's one with the exact same dimensions and it's a 550W PSU ... and I found it online at another site for $82.00 plus shipping. </s>
<s> In PSUs... higher wattage PSUs for now and later are preferable to the minimum PSUs provided by many mfgs. </s>
<s> http://www.power-on.com/ea550.html Again this is but one of many many PSUs that will work in your PC. </s>
<s> Feel free to look around. </s>
<s> You've just got to get a PSU with the same dimensions and more than 350W...I'd go at least 400/450 for now and perhaps higher for future systems, on/off switch on the PSU is preferred. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> was looking around new egg for them but they dont list there dimentions </s>
<s> links to the mfg. </s>
<s> From the looks of it...the dimensions listed seem to be fairly common. </s>
