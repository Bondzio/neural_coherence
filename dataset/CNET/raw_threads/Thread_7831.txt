Before I get set on doing so thoe i would love if somebody could just inform me if i could do suffecient upgrades to my Acer as ive bn told some things in my machine are pretty good, or would I be best just starting from scratch?? any advice with minor explination would be amazing and could save me some money thanks in advance. here's the specs CPU - AMD Phenom 9150e Quad-Core Processor Ram - Two 1gig ddr2 (it ses dual so i assume its two 1gigs) Graphics - ATI Radeon HD 3200 Im hoping to end up with a pretty solid gaming machine (for say bad company 2 and upcoming BC3) 19&quot; monitor at 1440x900 building from scratch id budget at around 1000 hoping to save if i can update this machine

Then visit the Acer support website and see if anything is offered as an &quot;upgrade&quot; option. Two areas that can benefit immediately are ram and video. Understand how your ram is set-up and add more. Then proceed to better video and here for gaming that's where alot falls on a good video card. However, once a power hungry card is installed you need the PSU that's &quot;very capable&quot; to support it and whatever else gets added. Also, cooling is very important so add more cooling if possible and/or upgrade to more fans or liquid cooling. Since, is to be a gaming rig, cooling will play an important part, so don't dismiss this until later. Heat and wattage use will increase temps and start to degrade the overall components over time, do this ASAP. Last, quality does matter, buy the good stuff. tada ------Willy

What you the about 100 buck GPU from this list to spice it up? http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card-game-performance-radeon-hd-6670,2935.html Bob
