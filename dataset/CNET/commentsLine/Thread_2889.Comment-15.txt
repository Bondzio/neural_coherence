yes, i did.
so, i got out the install cd, reinstalled the soundblaster audio.
after install, i got a window that said a file was missing (ctdvda2k.sys), did a search on the cd, and found it, and now i'm ok. i have sound.
all music plays ok in wmp...my other videos play ok...but anything i upload from this rca cam plays in fast forward and alvin and the chipmunks sing to me.
this just sucks.... any other ideas?
i do really appreciate your time and help
