I want to be able to share/store the music/picture files between the 2 computers via the external hard drive. How should the external hard drive be formatted to best fit this situation? I'd appreciate any info from those that have faced this problem before me and have a solution. Thanks

These are fine copies, but never put your only copy on an external hard drive. And about formatting. NTFS works. Even for use with today's Apple's latest MACOSX. FAT32 is too prone to corruption but maybe you knew that. Bob

I thought I had heard fat 32 was not the format option I'm looking for, but I didn't know what else would be compatable with both OX 10.5 and Vista Home Prem. Again thanks. Bob
