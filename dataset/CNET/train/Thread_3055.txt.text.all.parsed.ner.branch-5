(let's say- p3 933mhz?) 2. i want to add a fan to my pc's case, but when i connect it the screen starts flickering hysterically, and it won't stop. what can be the problem?

(let's say- p3 933mhz?) this is not possible. here's why. i'll use the game doom 3 as my example that no system today can play that game at it's top settings without &quot;stuck&quot; or a pause now and then. the game was designed to push the envelope and to take advantage of hardware yet to be. 2. i want to add a fan to my pc's case, but when i connect it the screen starts flickering hysterically, and it won't stop. what can be the problem? i'd say the cause can be either a poor installation or a power supply that is on the edges of the maximum that it can supply. bob
