<s> I was thinking of upgrading the RAM on my computer which I understood was currently 512MB. </s>
<s> I downloaded a freeware programme - Belarc Advisor which does a complete scan of the computer and reports on everything which is installed. </s>
<s> I did this to try and establish what scope there was for extra RAM. </s>
<s> The report tells me that there is 512MB of installed memory and that there are 4 memory slots (2 banks of 2) with a maximum capacity of 4096MB. </s>
<s> However, and this is where I get confused, it says that slot A0 has 128MB, slot A1 has 4096MB and slots A2 and A3 are empty. </s>
<s> This would make me think that the total installed memory is 4224MB which is more than the maximum. </s>
<s> The motherboard is MSI MS-6747. </s>
<s> I also did a further scan using Crucial.com and it came up with the same memory configuration. </s>
<s> Can anyone explain what memory I have and what scope there is for expansion? </s>
<s> That make board was listed the last time I tried it. </s>
<s> A program called CPUID and EVEREST might reveal what's in each slot if you don't remember or don't want to look. </s>
