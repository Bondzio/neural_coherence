<s> My friend has offered to build me a pc if I buy him a motherboard. </s>
<s> There are so many choices out there and I'm a noob anyway so I would like some suggestions. </s>
<s> I need a motherboard that can handle games like Age of Empires 2, Blood Bowl, Team Fortress 2, Portal 2, and other similar games. </s>
<s> I don't think I particularly need a gaming computer but I want something reliable and capable to get me through college. </s>
<s> Any feedback would be appreciated thanks. </s>

<s> &quot;Our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 LGA 1155 Core i5-2500K and a $1000 LGA 2011 Core i7-3960X, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved. </s>
<s> It turns out that memory bandwidth and PCIe throughput don't hold back the performance of existing Sandy Bridge-based machines. </s>
