1.3.1	Thanks for the info, but what is &quot;Firmware&quot; and &quot;Mac Filtering&quot; and how do I update these?	St
1.4.1	Both these terms and items are either in the router's manual or the maker's web site.	St
1.4.2	Since I don't see the make/model in your last reply, I leave it to you to look at the maker's web site for the FIRMWARE update and how to enable MAC filtering.	St
1.4.3	Example at http://www.zyxel.com/support/supportnote/ZyAIR_B2000/app/MACfilter.htm Bob	St
1.5.1	You need to make sure that you secure your wireless network.	St
1.5.2	You will need to make sure you use a WEP key.	St
1.5.3	Without using the key your leaving your wireless connection open for anyone to join.	St
