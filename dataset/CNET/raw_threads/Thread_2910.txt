In XP go to System Properties -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Starup and Recovery-&gt; Settings. There you could opt the operating system you need to load. Press edit and delete the line wherein Windows Server 2003 is written. Be Careful, for you can delete XP.. (and if you did so, go to the same place in Win Server 2003). After deleting it from this bios line, you can easly delete it from the directory you've installed it... FYI, it's not fully!! deleting it... there are many places where WIN Server places itself, such as c:\Documents and Settings and many more.... if you really need the space in your harddisk, take a day off and delete all of those appearances... Bye
