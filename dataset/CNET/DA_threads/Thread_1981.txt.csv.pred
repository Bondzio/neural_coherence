1.2.1	start - settings - control panel - keyboard - make sure it is set to US default Look at the keyboard mappings , character settings etc .	St
1.2.2	It got changed somehow - possibly malware .	St
1.3.1	When a keyboard starts messing up like you describe the first things to do are to unplug and replug the keyboard to see if that fixes it .	St
1.3.2	Next is to reboot , third is to test another keyboard .	St
