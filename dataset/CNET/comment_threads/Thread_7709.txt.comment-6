&quot;We only lose what we didn't backup.&quot; We have long discussions about backup in these forums.
My backup routine is pretty simple.
I copy out to an external USB drive, then to a SFTP server, then to a new snazzy 8GB memory stick (just the items I can't lose) and occasional to DVDR (about 6).
Anyone that won't backup has set the value of their files?
