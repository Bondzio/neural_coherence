<s> I have a Dell Inspiron 2650 previously running on 256MB of memory with two DIMMS 128MB each. </s>
<s> After a while, I decided to upgrade my computer to 384MB by combining an old 128MB stick with a 256MB stick. </s>
<s> Now a problem arised after about 5 months - my computer would not start. </s>
<s> The power light would turn on, but the harddrive access light would not blink as it normally would. </s>
<s> I called Dell Tech Support and informed me it must be the issue of combining different sizes of RAM. </s>
<s> So, I got another 256MB stick to make a combination of 512MB. </s>
<s> Yet again, the computer will start and then just lock up after about 30 or so minutes of usage. </s>
<s> After shutting the computer down, my notebook will not boot back up again. </s>
<s> I have to reinstall the RAM in order for my computer to boot up. </s>
<s> I'd really would like to get the performance boost of 512MB, but something in my computer is not letting me. </s>
<s> Please Help!! </s>

<s> A clue about possible failed fans or clogged heatsinks. </s>
<s> Even laptops need those clean and free from clogs. </s>
<s> Here's some articles about this -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=HOW+TO+CLEAN+A+LAPTOP+HEATSINK%3F Bob </s>
<s> I took apart my notebook and cleaned the heatsink. </s>
<s> The problem still resumes. </s>
<s> The computer simply locked up except much less than 30 minutes. </s>
<s> One thing I noticed was that even though Windows was unresponsive - I was still able to change screen brightness by pressing FN and the up button. </s>
<s> Does this mean that the motherboard is still functioning despite the crashing? </s>
<s> I can boot Linux from USB or CD and see if it runs fine. </s>
<s> Your post is light about use of antivirus or antispyware or what browser you use. </s>
<s> Here's an online scan. </s>
<s> Share what it finds -&gt; http://www.ewido.net/en/onlinescan/ Bob </s>
<s> Thank you Mr. Proffitt. </s>
<s> I believe you have been the only one to reply to my posts - and numerous times as well. </s>
<s> I run Ad-Aware and Windows Defender for antispyware. </s>
<s> For antivirus I use Norton Systemscan from the Google Pack. </s>
<s> I will try to run Ubuntu as soon as possible and report back. </s>
<s> Takes a different approach and has hit paydirt at times. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> RAM speed and compatibility. </s>
<s> Is it matched to the laptop? </s>
<s> As far as my knowledge goes, the RAM is correct for my notebook. </s>
<s> PC2100S-25330-A0. </s>
<s> Both my 128 and 256 pairs are made by Samsung. </s>
<s> Completed the scan with no infections. </s>
<s> After another one of my crashes, I inserted my Ubuntu live CD before forcing a shut down. </s>
<s> The computer would not access the harddrive and the Dell splash screen announcing hit F2 to enter set up would not show up on the monitor. </s>
<s> Although I did hear the CD drive beginning to spin, but eventually just stopped. </s>
<s> When running Ubuntu without a prior crash, it will still freeze after a prolonged period. </s>
<s> More Information: Only certain combinations of RAM make the computer crash. </s>
<s> 256 & 256 - Crash 256 & 128 - Crash 256 - Stable 128 & 128 -Stable At this point, I'm completely perplexed as to what the problem could be. </s>
<s> Would CNET users just recommend sticking with the 256 (total) combinations? </s>
<s> Is this memory &quot;generic&quot; or from a place like Crucial.com that will get you the right stuff? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> All of the pieces of memory are made by Samsung. </s>
<s> Since you didn't answer my question here's my new answer. </s>
<s> Go get some sticks from Crucial.com and see if they work. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> 128 and 128 is not working anymore. </s>
<s> So I'm back to running my notebook with just one 256. </s>
<s> This really does not make sense as I have been running 128 and 128 for nearly 4 years. </s>
<s> I was trying to think of all possible causes for this problem and came up with a power or driver related issue? </s>
<s> I scanned my computer using DriverAgent and according to them, these drivers are out of date: Display adapter IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers 3Com 3C920 Integrated Fast Ethernet Controller (3C905C-TX Compatible) PCMCIA adapters Universal Serial Bus controllers As for the power issue, there are two power adapters for my computer (Inspiron 2650). </s>
<s> One is rated at 3.5A and the other 4.5A in terms of output. </s>
<s> Input is the same at 1.5A. </s>
<s> So, any recommendations at this point? </s>
