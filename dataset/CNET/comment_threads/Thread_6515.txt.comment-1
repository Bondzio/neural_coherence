Hello I have two machines one PET CT scanner and other is also a medical machine and both are communicating via LAN.
There is an IP conflict between both the machines, But we are not able to find same IP any where in the machines, Could you please tell me is there any way to filter this IP conflict.
These macines are on the same network and also they have to communicate each other.
