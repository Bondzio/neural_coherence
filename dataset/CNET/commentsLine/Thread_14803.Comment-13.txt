there is a sata connection for another internal storage drive.
the comments so far indicate this computer is not capable of handling another 2 tb internal drive.
comments as to why i require more storage are irrevelant.
obviously i have maxxed out this computer.
as usual, i have to spend more $$ to accomplish my goals.
no matter.
i appreciate the straight talk on this website as always.
