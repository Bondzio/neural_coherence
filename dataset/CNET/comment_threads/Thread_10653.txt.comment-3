Same thing happened to me.
I deleted the account that I made at home and redid it when I was on another wifi network at work.
It worked ever since.
However when I go home it won't update.
I deleted the account again and tried to rejoin but it does the same thing it did before.
I will redo the account t work again on Monday.
This tells me the issue is with my cable router (motorola sbg900).
Perhaps a port or something.
