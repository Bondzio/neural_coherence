&quot;vista on intel onboard graphics 1152x768 60khz .. problem is I get running thin horizontal lines &quot; Try a video card.
Any will do.
Just FYI, onboard video is rough at times on new builders.
They may not go get a driver or the RAM is not compatible with their system and odd graphic things show.
A test with a video card is needed here as well as telling us about the driver you used.
