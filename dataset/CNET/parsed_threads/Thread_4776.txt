<s> I have a Macbook Pro with the above mentioned graphics card. </s>
<s> There are several stories and a statement from nvidia re a high failure rate? </s>
<s> Does anyone have more information? </s>
<s> Are all the chips bad? </s>
<s> My mac is not coverage by applecare, should I be concerned? </s>
<s> Neither Apple nor NVIDIA have confirmed this for us. </s>
<s> Apparently, many NVIDIA graphics cards are subject to manufacturing defects. </s>
<s> As such, they could fail after certain periods of use. </s>
<s> I have heard that the supposedly affected 8400 and 8600 cards actually belong to computers built by Dell and HP; Apple may not have them. </s>
<s> No one knows if ALL of the chips are bad. </s>
<s> Some people say that their NVIDIA-equipped MacBooks are failing, but they are in the minority (so far). </s>
<s> Mine works perfectly, and many others do too. </s>
<s> If your MacBook works fine, I wouldn't be concerned. </s>
<s> If Apple orders a recall, then it should cover all affected notebooks, covered by AppleCare or not. </s>
<s> You can only wait and see. </s>
<s> -BMF </s>
<s> It's true. </s>
<s> there is a serious problem and i know from experience: two replaced MBP logic boards and it's still dead but now out of warranty. </s>
<s> if ur screen goes dark on boot and OS only sees the nvidia chip as the intel one, u know u got the bug. </s>
<s> the only fix is logic board replacement. </s>
<s> did that twice, as apple just replaces with the same board and they only last x amount of months. </s>
<s> total hose job for hundreds of users so far. </s>
<s> i had to get an imac to get some work done, the mbp is sitting in a box. </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-g84-g86-chips-overheating,6121.html Of course this is your choice here. </s>
<s> well its out of warranty now, and they don't even sell applecare here in this country (no one is authorized for it). </s>
<s> i guess if there is a class action i can join:) </s>
<s> I cannot get applecare out of warranty. </s>
<s> it is over 1 yr old. </s>

<s> You can either go to an Apple retail store or contact Apple for information on how to obtain service. </s>

<s> You made yours so I'm unsure what your question is here. </s>
