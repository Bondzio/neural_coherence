Hello.
I am re building a old computer i found in my cuboard.
The mistake I made is that I pulled out everything when I haden't decided to re build it.
Then I decided I would.
The only problem I have now is that I don't know where all the power calbes go in the motherboard.
Does anyone know how many calbes go into the mother board, where or a website that can tell me.
Thank you in advance.
