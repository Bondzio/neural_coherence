i have just started building systems for enthusiasts and every day users.
the average is one syetm a day basing upon different specs.the one thing my clients require is a full system recovery option (one button recovery solution)i would like to do the following: - create a samll partition on my hard drive for drive image and be able to hide it as well.
- after fully installing and optimizing windows xp pro alongwith system drivers create a full-system image (like the oems) - be able to access the image upon boot (like that one-button recovery stuff used by oems) whenever i want to resort to a full system restore.
- also, please advise me on which software should i be using for this purpose which should be reliable and professional.
help will be appreciated!
!
