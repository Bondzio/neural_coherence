1.1.1	I had three tablets in my mind:- 1) Ipad 2) Innoversal Lattice Tablet 3) Notion Ink Adam Tablet Ipad has a very glossy LCD screen, which is bad for reading.	St
1.1.2	Lattice & Adam have Pixel-Qi screens, and while I was hesitating between one and the other, I found that neither do the job, as they are also both glossy, with the Adam using some protective matte thing (not real matte screen).	St
1.1.3	So, I want a tablet for reading, and I want it to have an OS (like Android) to do some other work; what do you suggest?	St
1.1.4	A side question: is that screen protective that some use on Ipad a good one just like a matte screen?	St
1.2.1	I thought all the units were prototypes!	St
