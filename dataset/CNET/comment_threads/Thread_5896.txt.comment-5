computer that it is tough to help.
Knowing the vintage of the system and what CPU and memory is used can be very helpful.
Does the CPU have a HSF on it [heat sink & fan]?
That is the key fan to be rotating.
The others should work also, but with no cooling for the CPU, the system may not boot or will shut down quickly.
Try your friend, if he could use some help have him work with you replying to this thread.
It may take some back and forth dialog but we usually find the cause.
[and sometimes fix it.
LOL]
