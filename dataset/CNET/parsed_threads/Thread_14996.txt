<s> before you think it, no, i haven't formatted my hard drive or anything like that. </s>
<s> somehow i have manged to break in half one of the components on the chipboard on the base of the hard drive, it is a Samsung sp0802n. </s>
<s> will i be able to swap the chip board from another drive? </s>
<s> (not of same make or model) or would this be a bad idea? </s>
<s> or should i contact Samsung for help? </s>
<s> or would it be possible to take apart the hard drive and swap the disk over with another hard drive of equal capacity? </s>
<s> help much apreciated. </s>
<s> It worked! </s>
<s> Please try it. </s>
<s> And of course you need the EXACT same chip. </s>
<s> The date code can usually vary but that's about all that can. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thanks alot Bob, i thought it was possible to change the chips over, but I wasn't 100% sure, and the data on the drive is worth taking a few precautions for. </s>
<s> Ive already found the same drive on eBay so i should be well away. </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> Most are easy to spot. </s>
<s> Mostly you see a manufacture week and year in some 4 digits. </s>
<s> 3207 = 32nd week of 2007 1005 = 10th week of 2005 Bob </s>
<s> ok so i ordered a new hard drive that was as far as i could tell identical to the broken one. </s>
<s> its arrived and i have taken the chip off ans swapped it over. </s>
<s> now however the hard drive will spin up, clunk, and power down, only to repeat this cycle over and over, until it eventually stops and stays powered down. </s>
<s> also in the time it takes for it to boot and crash, windows doesn't recognise it. </s>
<s> The other board on this drive. </s>
<s> If not then that wasn't it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> what you meant by that, as far as i could tell you meant take the old board and put it on the new hard drive? </s>
<s> well whatever drive the board is on the broken component still produces smoke when turned on. </s>
<s> the problem is that the new hard drive works fine, but when i take the board off the new hard drive and put it on the old drive, it just goes in the cycle of power up and power down. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_smoke Sorry but once the smoke gets out that chip's function went away with that smoke. </s>
<s> Sorry if I was unclear. </s>
<s> Another time honored hard disk recovery method is to take a working drive and steal it's circuit board and put that on the dead drive. </s>
<s> That seems to be something hard to swallow to the would be data recovery person since you might end up with 2 dead drives. </s>
<s> But that's the price of getting the data back (possibly.) </s>
<s> If this fails then the repair is beyond the home DIY methods and you drop a note to drivesavers.com Bob </s>
<s> i had heard of the &quot;blue smoke&quot; theory, just hoping it wasn't true for a little while there. </s>
<s> thanks again for your help, i don't know where i would be if it wasn't for you guys at CNET. </s>
<s> If you're in need of recovering the data off of your broken drive, I highly recommend Gillware.com for affordable and quick data recovery. </s>

<s> How fast will they work on your data recovery? </s>
<s> Looks grim. </s>
