on the same hard drive?
then you should be able to put the old drive into a usb enclosure and copy out the data from there as long as the drive is still accessible.
the other method would have been to use a usb flash drive.
maybe i'm not seeing the issue properly but it seems to me that copying the data to other media would have been...and still might be...the way to go.
