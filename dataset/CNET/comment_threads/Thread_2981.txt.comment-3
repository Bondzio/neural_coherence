I had the same problem: I'd set the registry key HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\WheelScrollLines to 1 and it would change to 3 on reboot.
Well, something would change it to 3 on reboot.
The challenge is to find out what is doing this.
The solution: load a registry monitor that will do boot-time monitoring, like Sysinternals RegMon ( http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/Regmon.html ), and check the log to see what is changing the registry key in question.
Be sure to read about RegMon's boot-time process here: http://www.sysinternals.com/Information/BootTimeRegistryActivity.html as the boot-time log can be large.
Mine was 75MB.
My culprit was a pointing device driver for my laptop that was configured in control panel to be disabled, but was still applying some of it's settings.
Good luck.
