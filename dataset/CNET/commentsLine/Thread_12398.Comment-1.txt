hi, i'm wondering if anyone can give me some recommendations for a high quality, reasonably priced color laser printer.
i'm starting an invitation and card business and need something to print the cards from.
i've spoke with a few other people that have the same business and most print their cards right from their own printer.
the two names that keep coming up are canon and rikoh but i don't see any reviews here on those two brands.
i bought a lexmark black & white laser printer years ago to make cards with so i could run vellum through it and it never fed right, even regular paper would jam or feed 20 sheets threw at a time.
lemark got high reviews here from cnet but not from users so i'm not eager to go with another lexmark.
so what i need is something that prints high quality in both color & black/white for text & graphics...speed is not as important, but feeding is....i do not want to have to stand there and individually feed every sheet.
i need something that can handle card stock and vellum, as well as smaller print sizes, 3x5 cards, but it does not have to be larger than 8.5x11 if it does that's a plus.
and of course prices is always important.
i am using a mac platform, leopard operating system.
thanks for any suggestions nicole
