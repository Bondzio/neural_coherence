I usually have the printer DHCP at first then latter if I have time set it to some known address on my LAN.
You write about using the Epson CD but for setting the printer settings on the printer I use the controls on the printer to do that.
And again about the Espon CD.
I've found such CDs to be out of date even on a new printer.
I always head to epson.com and get their latest.
