Your 2Wire 1701HG Gateway is supposed to have 4 ports for making wired connections and the ability to make wireless connections.
Connect up to 4 computers with a newtork cable to share the broadband Internet service.
The network cable plugs into the computer's network adapter (sometimes called an ethernet adapter, network interface card, NIC, 10/100 adapter, et al.).
If you want to make wireless connections to your 2Wire gateway, your gateway needs to be wireless capable and each computer that is to connect wirelessly is to have a wireless network adapter that is compatible with the gateway.
If your gateway doesn't have multiple network ports or wireless capability, you can add a WIRELESS BROADBAND ROUTER to it.
