On my XP Machine, it works great. It comes with a Suite of Audio Software that all works... But not so on my Vista Machine. It installs, but not properly and few of the features are available to use. I think it's a vista driver issue, but their website offers no relief. I'm peed off and would like to say goodbye to Creative and hello to some other replacement. Thanks for any suggestions...

If the creative drivers dont get along with vista dont expect vista to play nicely with anyone else. Yet another poor sucker that fell victim to microsoft marketing. My advice, switch back to XP for 12 months until vista becomes a little less microsofty.

It does allow a few of the Progs to work but not all. Particularly the one I wanted most, The Player/Recorder. It has the record &quot;What-U-Hear&quot; setting, and is pretty useful... It does show, but with no recording abilities. I have it installed on my XP machine, and it runs well. Thanks...

And such as MS's bad press these days that it becomes their fault. As the second reply to your post points out, the audio subsystem received a major overhaul (mostly for the better) in Vista, yet the vast majority of the vendors still don't support it properly. It is a major job to be sure but they've known about the changes for ages. Suffice it to say that older soundcards won't be supported with Vista from virtually anyone, and expect only whatever was available just before Vista launch to be supported. You should be pretty safe with X-Fi cards as far as driver support in Vista is concerned. It's not complete now, but they should have it sorted out in a while.
