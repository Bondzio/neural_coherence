most lower end motherboards and computers come with integrated graphics.
unless you build your own or buy a higher end system that is what you will get.
if in fact you plan on upgrading your graphics card to a pcie card then you will in fact regret it, because the number one thing less expensive systems without dedicated video cards do is put in a cheap power supply, usually without a pcie hookup anyway, so to upgrade the video you will also have to upgrade the power supply.
trust me you will have to buy a new power supply and a new video card if you want to upgrade.
( we are assuming the system you are buying has a pci express video card slot, if it doesn't once again you will regret buying it) you are already talking about graphic intensive games so my bottom line is yes you will regret it.
you get what you pay for.
