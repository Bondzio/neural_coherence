I have in my mind that the better way to backup photos would be to put them on an external hard drive.
(I am forever hunting for the correct CD or DVD) They would be easy to get to from other computers to edit or to store from a laptop on a trip.I think I would only use it to store photos so I hope it would last many years or am I expecting too much?
