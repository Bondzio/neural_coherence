thanks for the replies.
they make sense and seem obvious in retrospect (one of those ''why didn't i think of that'' moments).
the original question arose because a colleague at the university where i work said macs are ''memory intensive''.
so after looking at the 17'' imac on display at the campus store, i was ready to order one with 1.5 or 2 gigs of memory.
then i made the mistake of visiting a real apple store and seeing one with a 20'' monitor and i realized i probably can't afford a big monitor plus 2 gigs of ram.
this put me in a tizzy and resulted in my wondering whether i should invest in big memory or big display.
do macs need a large amount of memory?
is one gig enough for a macintosh that will be used for standard web duties, some video and photo editing, and the preparation of lectures with powerpoint?
i'm sorry if i seem obsessive.
its just that this is my first foray into macs and i would like to get it at least semi-right.
i also apologize if this submission appears twice.
i sent it from my office but it hadn't appeared as of this evening so i tried again.
thanks once more, jay
