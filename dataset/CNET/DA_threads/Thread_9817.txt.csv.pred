1.1.1	hi Everyone, I have a Netgear router connected to my desktop, and then I have a laptop wirelessly connected to the router.	St
1.1.2	At random times i will run into a scenario where the laptop has an internet connection, but the desktop does not.	St
1.1.3	Very weird...	St
1.1.4	I called Netgear support, and at first they had me change to static IP address on the desktop, and that seemed to work for a few days.	St
1.1.5	But today the same thing happened, where i have internet on the laptop, but not on the desktop.	St
1.1.6	After rebooting the desktop, the internet connection came back on it.	St
1.1.7	Anyone know what's going on?	St
1.1.8	by the way i also have Vonage connected to the router, but i don't think that matters.	St
1.1.9	Netgear basically told me they think something's wrong with my desktop.	St
1.1.10	But my desktop never used to drop the internet until the router was hooked up.	St
1.1.11	please help, thank you	Polite
1.2.1	Not with the supplied information.	St
1.2.2	But with today's pests I never discount that issue.	St
1.2.3	I scan with EWIDO, Housecall and toss what it finds out.	St
1.2.4	I also install the latest FIRMWARE in the router and try once again.	St
1.2.5	But nothing in your post gives up a clue that this will help but it's a common first response to make sure the usual items are not the cause.	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	The next time this happens you should do the following.	St
1.3.2	1) open a DOS windo and type ipconfig /all for status and info.	St
1.3.3	2) Ping the default gateway 3) Ping the DNS server listed in IP config.	St
1.3.4	Before this problem happens again, do a ..... tracert www.yahoo.com Or trace to your DNS server.	St
1.3.5	Trace Route will show you a response from every router between you and the target.	St
1.3.6	What you are looking for is the IP address of the first ISP router.	St
1.3.7	Once you know the IP address of the ISP router you can add that as step 4 above.	St
1.3.8	4) Ping the ISP router This should give you some clue what is wrong.	St
1.3.9	You can also log onto the router and check the status page.	St
1.3.10	DSL usually uses PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet).	St
1.3.11	PPP uses a username/password to track usage.	St
1.3.12	Disconnected usually means your router could not authenticate with the ISP serrver.	St
1.3.13	Some routers also allow you to ping from the GUI.	St
1.3.14	SKrall	St
