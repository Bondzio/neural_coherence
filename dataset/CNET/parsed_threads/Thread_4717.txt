<s> Hello, I need to find a way to password-protect an external hard drive in a way that is cross-platform compatible, AND find a way to add meta data or tags to the files on that hard drive that are also cross-platform searchable. </s>
<s> I have been digging around the internet looking for a solution for a day now, here's what I've tried and the issues I've run into: 1) TrueCrypt comes up as a suggestion a lot. </s>
<s> Nice because it's cross-platform compatible (downside being that it must be installed on any machine you want to access files from). </s>
<s> The downside is that there is some bug between Windows Search and TrueCrypt such that files on the encrypted drive don't show up in search results (I did find a thread somewhere with a very complicated workaround for this, but I'd rather avoid it). </s>
<s> 2) Folder Lock - nice because it allows you to just password protect without encryption (I've seen a bunch of threads that say &quot;But you really need encryption for security!&quot; - I'm not concerned about anyone attempting to hack or steal the data, the need for a password is a formality I have to meet, don't need to go into the details), and it runs from a .exe stored on the external drive, so you do NOT need Folder Lock installed on a machine to access the file. </s>
<s> The problem here is that Mac's don't run .exes so there goes my cross-platform compatibility. </s>
<s> While I'm at it, I need some way to add these tags to video files - would be great if they would then show up in the native Mac and Windows OS search applications without some third party software. </s>
<s> In Windows I can right click a media file, go to Properties -&gt; Details and add tags that are recognized in Windows search (unless they're on an encrypted TrueCrypt drive), but I don't believe they show up in Mac. </s>
<s> Any suggested solutions (preferably something simple, like another program besides TrueCrypt or Folder Lock that will do all this and not a complicated workaround) would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> That new guideline about hard disk encryption for workers with medical information. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Folk that forgot about security and computers. </s>
<s> The old physical security rule. </s>
<s> But any system you create and see out there mandates changes to the OS to give you what you are asking for. </s>
<s> So is the pain worth the trouble as well as what happens when the drive gets a little corrupted or you lose the password? </s>
<s> Most folk forget about these issues and lose thousands to have the data recovered. </s>
