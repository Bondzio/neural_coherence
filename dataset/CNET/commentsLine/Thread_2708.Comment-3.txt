hi!
thanks for the reply.
actually, my quote of 100gb for 7hrs of video recording was taken from the box of the maxtor onetouch ii 300gb hard disk at the shop.
so, i'm not very sure too.
may be 300gb is too large for my home use.
are you suggesting that, say, 80gb would be adequate for a day or 2 video recording via 2 nos x 24hrs of wireless internet cameras?
i'm open to suggestions.
thanks again
