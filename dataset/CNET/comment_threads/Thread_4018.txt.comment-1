well i have taken the leap into the wonderfull world of overclocking just to try it out.
heres what i got amd64 venice 3000+ @ 2.20ghz (9x244) system is running rock solid and i am very happy with the performance boost.
now, my idle temp is at about 33c-36c and my load temps are around 39c-47c (cpu-burn for 20mins @ 47c) i did not mess with any voltage settings and actually set my ram to 166 instead of its stock 200 (geil value ram 2gb pc3200 in duel channel mode) but with the overclock its right back up to 199. pci and agp bus is locked at stock speeds.
my question is, is this an acceptable overclock or is there something i have missed or could have done better, remember folks this is my first overclock so be gentle in your replys....i'm sensitive.....( | ) thanks in advance for your suggestions!!!
