i don't understand why you would ever need to replace any optical drive in a computer?
i've had my dell 866 mhz for 5 years with dual optical drives and never once had any problems with either of them let alone need to replace them.
any optical drive should last you (depending on your usage) the life of your computer.
the burner on my dell is an lg installed by dell.
i can proudly say that i've never had any problems with it.
