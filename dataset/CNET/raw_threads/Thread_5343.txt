PC specs: Asus P4S800 motherboard Pentium 4 2.8Ghz 512MB DDR Memory I don't think anything else is relevant. It was a barebones kit. I put everything together back in april I think and everything was working fine. I haven't experienced any problems until recently. Suddenly one day the computer would not boot. I would turn it on and it would power up but nothing happened. No beep, it would just hang. So, I opened it up and started disconecting parts(HD, CD drives, etc) one by one. No change. Then I started to check connections on everything else(video card, memory, etc) and nothing. Now for the part that really confusses me. I unlocked the CPU fan to try to take it off. I had difficulty getting it off so I decided to give up, reattached the fan and just for kicks turned it on. It booted and went straight to system BIOS with a message next to CPU external frequency(i think). It said something about the setting being too high. I think it was at something like 200/33. I could be wrong about that value. I have it written down somewhere. Anyway there wasn't a lower setting. So I left it alone and exited for the BIOS and let the PC boot. After this, anytime I wanted to use my computer I would have to unlock the CPU fan, lock it again then boot. Otherwise the system would just hang without booting. Also, the computer would freeze if I had it on for too long. Now it will not boot no matter what I do. Could this be a problem with the power supply unit? I thought it might be the processor overheating maybe. I am really lost here and hope someone might be able to help. Thank you.

Describe exactly what you are &quot;unlocking&quot; and why you can't get the fan off. Separating the HSF combo from the CPU should be simple, the heat sink compound may cause them to stick together a little but should still be easy to separate. Also it is a combination of a heatsink and a fan. Are you trying to remove the fan from the heat sink???? Any chance that you are unlocking the ZIF connector lever??? [zero insertion force] that allows the CPU to be put in or removed without any insertion force?? Had a case in the forums where someone was doing that and caused the CPU contacts to get burned due to poor contact because the lever was not locked.

I have been learning alot as a result of this problem which is great. Anyway I probably could have gotten the fan off but I really didn't know what I was doing and was afraid of accidentally damaging something. There are two levers that lock the fan in place atop the heatsink. All I did was open the levers, found the the fan came loose but did not come right off and because I didn't know what I was doing I locked the fan back in place and tried to boot up. Even if I did something wrong at that stage it wouldn't explain the initial problem. Although it might have made matters worse. I do not think that is the case. I was trying to be very carefull. As for the ZIF connector lever, I am not sure what this looks like. The levers I was touching were about 1.5 inches in length, laying horizontally, one the top and one on the bottom of the heatsink(at least I think they were connected to the heatsink). Up until about a week ago I had no idea what a heatsink was.
