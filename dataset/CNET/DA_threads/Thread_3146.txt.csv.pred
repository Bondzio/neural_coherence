1.1.1	Vista has been shoved down our throats after the appetizers of crapware and everything else.	St
1.1.2	First thing I would do is complete format and clean install of XP on my system or just build my own.	St
1.1.3	Gateway wanted to charge an additional $49 to &quot;upgrade&quot; from Vista to Windows XP on a new system.	St
1.1.4	The customer service rep became extremely confused when I asked him why anyone would pay for, and how XP magically became an &quot;upgrade&quot; from Vista as opposed to a down-grade.	St
1.1.5	It's to the point that it's just almost funny that the pc user and consumer are now considered the lower 1 percent on the intellectual scale!	St
1.2.1	Just unpacked a new Acer laptop.	St
1.2.2	The only items I removed was Norton and a Yahoo toolbar.	St
1.2.3	This experience makes me wonder if crapware is over hyped.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	i just removed norton from my new acer and that was it.	St
1.3.2	i'm also enjoying vista a lot.	St
1.3.3	i was really unsure about trying it because of all the negative press, but i'm glad i did.	St
1.4.1	Our research has shown that the less popular brands like Acer, Emachines, etc do have less crapware than Dell, Gateway, etc.	St
1.4.2	We are testing Toshiba right now.	St
1.4.3	The downfall we have found is that software that we need like Microsoft Office is not being put on systems (aside from trial versions).	St
1.4.4	We need the production software but assume this is one way for the distributors to keep the cost down.	St
1.4.5	The problems with vista we have found are that some software and hardware do not have the correct drivers as of yet.	St
