i got a new sd card a while ago for my camera.
the built in card reader in my epson printer displays a picture of a memory card with a zig zag line across it implying that the card is corrupted.
however, i can view the pictures on the camera and can transfer normally to the computer using a usb to the camera.
however, the card reader is much more convenient.
i have formatted the card using the camera's function and that did nothing.
any ideas?
