Hi all.
I've been experiencing frequent freezes lately, where I have to manually re-boot my PC.
Haven't been able to successfully troubleshoot the issue.
I have Norton anti-virus installed and updated and no viruses have been detected after a full scan, so I've ruled viruses out.
I'm wondering if it could be my processor, motherboard, OS or video card (or combination).
Do you have any suggestions how I could troubleshoot this issue?
Having to re-boot is becoming a drag.
