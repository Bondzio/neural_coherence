or required speed.
personally, i always liked 3com but they got bought by hp.
we picked up a 48 port baseline model for our school.
its auto-sensing, 10/100 with a gigabit uplink and has worked fine.
we've a couple of 24 port 3coms and one poe used for the wireless system.
none have ever had a problem.
these are all their &quot;baseline&quot; models which are unmanaged, rack mountable and moderately priced.
i'll recommend 3com any day if you can still find their products but more about your needs would be helpful.
