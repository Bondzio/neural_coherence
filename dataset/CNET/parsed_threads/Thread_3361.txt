<s> I'm sharing the wireless network with my mother's house which is about 120 feet from my house. </s>
<s> Currently, I'm using SMC usb wireless network adapter with my laptop. </s>
<s> The problem is that I can only use the network when I'm in my bedroom (about 40% signal strength) but when I move my laptop to another room which is about 20 feet further I cannot detect the network at all. </s>
<s> I once try to use my dad's laptop which has a built-in network adapter in that room and it turn out to work just fine with signal strength around 40%. </s>
<s> Should it be the same between using built-in network adapter and usb type adapter? </s>
<s> And if yes, what should I do so that I can use the network? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> The fact is that I can use the wireless network by using another laptop which has built-in wireless network adapter. </s>
<s> But when I use my laptop which doesn't have a built-in wireless adapter, I cannot connect to the network. </s>
<s> BTW, I'm using Linksys 54Mbps 802.11g Wireless router model WRT54G. </s>
<s> http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,16285031~mode=flat That's a great router. </s>
<s> You can not only fit better antennas but upgrade the firmware so it will make coffee. </s>
<s> As to the laptop that doesn't have built-in, that's great clues. </s>
<s> It's card has so-so antennas so kicking up your router will help. </s>

<s> better antenna, or change the wireless adaptor, or signal booster. </s>
<s> For Antenna, you can make it your self or get a factory made antenna. </s>
<s> Wireless adaptor, its too many brand to choose from. </s>
<s> Signal Booster, also too many brand to choose from. </s>
<s> google this, radiolabs.com, hawking technology, freeantenna, or the basic, linksys, dlink, netgear, etc. </s>
<s> BTW, the distance is not measure between the house.. but it should be measure from device to device, so if possible move the router/accesspoint closer to your house.. place it near the windows that facing your home.. </s>
<s> It may be slightly more costly, but the easiest way to boost the signal so that you totally eliminate the problem is just to get a range extender. </s>
<s> It picks up the signal, boosts it and re-broadcasts it. </s>
<s> Put that in your bedroom, then you can roam anywhere in your house on the stronger signal no matter what laptop or PC you are using. </s>
<s> You can get these as didicated devices, or some Wireless Access Points or Wireless Routers have an option to work just as a range extender. </s>
<s> Sometimes you can get some pretty good deals on them too. </s>
<s> Hope that helps! </s>
<s> it extend the distance at reduced speed.. </s>
<s> Speed on the other side of the Range Expander is cut in half. </s>
<s> If all you need is a little more coverage, a High Gain antenna might be a better solution. </s>
<s> and it should be in between the device or within range of your main access point. </s>
<s> TrendNet offers a kit that has everything in it that you need. </s>
<s> buy.com, newegg and others carry it. </s>
<s> the part # is TEW-OA14DK and it is not very expensive </s>
<s> The router/AP already has an antenna with a 3db gain (probably). </s>
<s> To see a benefit you need to exceed the old antenna by 3db or greater. </s>
<s> I like this company for antennas. </s>
