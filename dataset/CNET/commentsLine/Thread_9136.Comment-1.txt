my 3-year old motherboard (soyo k7vtapro with an amd athlon thunderbird 1.33ghz processor) recently died.
i have purchased an asus mb p5p800 865pe and a p4/2.8 ghz lga775 processor to replace the old system.
i would like to re-use my old hd (running xp home)which is fairly new.
what is the best way to get the hd to work in the new system?
should i reformat and start all over again?
thanks for your help!
