<s> I just bought a HP 8300f multi media computer. </s>
<s> Everything works fantastic with the expection of getting the TV to work. </s>
<s> I connected my satellite tv coax cable to TV/CABLE input and performed the hardware wizard and at the completion of the search there is no signal detected, same for manually doing it. </s>
<s> The TV card has DTV Antennae, S-Video, TV/Cable, and FM Ant connections. </s>
<s> I am using VGA output cable to the monitor. </s>
<s> Previously I had a combo monitor/TV with this same cable connected and it all worked fine, but now trying to run it thru the computer instead of directly into the old monitor I get no results. </s>
<s> Is this an ID10t error? </s>
<s> Can anyone give me a hand? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> has to be converted to TV format by receiver first. </s>
<s> Agreed, the cable I am connecting to the computer comes out of the dual tuner dvr box supplied by Dish Satellite. </s>
<s> goes to PC's regular RF input instead of ATSC? </s>
<s> And select that input in your software setup. </s>
<s> PC will only tune Ch 3 or 4 depending on your box setup. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> I have realized the same thing, the PC works on channel 2, 3, or 4, and my Dish box is programmed for channel 116. </s>
<s> Talked with Dish, and they say that tuner 2 on the box can only output to channel 60, 73, or 116, tuner 1 outputs to channel 3 or 4. </s>
<s> Our local Dish installer is a neighbor who will stop by to correct for me. </s>
<s> His price quote was &quot;some beer&quot;. </s>
<s> Again thanks for the help. </s>
<s> who's your favorite comic book person? </s>
<s> Sgt. </s>
<s> Rock (DC) or Nick Fury (Marvel)? </s>
<s> Sgt Fury is a character created by The Greaseman, a once popular DJ in DC/Maryland. </s>
<s> One of the first shock jocks. </s>
<s> too bad he never worked again after mlk comment (afaik). </s>
<s> greaseman & co may have 'nick'ed the name from nick fury's original comic: &quot;Sgt. </s>
<s> Fury and his Howling Commandos.&quot; </s>
