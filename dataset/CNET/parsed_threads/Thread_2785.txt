<s> Hi, I have 2 internal HDDs installed in my computer. </s>
<s> At the start-up, the computer shows both HDDs, but Windows explorer shows only one. </s>
<s> Any idea? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Windows Explorer only shows partitioned drives. </s>
<s> Is that second drive partitioned? </s>
<s> You need to go to the disk management tool in the control panel under administrative functions/computer management. </s>
<s> It's possible XP sees it as unpartitioned space. </s>
<s> You'd need to click on it and follow the prompts to partition and format it. </s>
<s> Once done, it gets a drive letter and Explorer can see it. </s>
<s> Hi Steve, Thanks for your answer. </s>
<s> I think I know why Windows Explorer doesn't show the other HDD. </s>
<s> I forgot to mention that. </s>
<s> The second HDD has Ubuntu installed on. </s>
<s> I think that's why Windows does not show it. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
