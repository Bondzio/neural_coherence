i did a quick review of the specs offered by the support webpage.
they point only to 1.5gb of ram can be installed.
these are pc-2100 ram sticks.
newer ram is much faster and can be installed or be offered 4sale at higher speed.
this is a physical limit the mtrbd.
support probably to bios constraints.
though you can actually installed 3x1gb sticks, the bios will allow only 1/2 of that amount per stick.
what maybe possible is to look for the status of the bios present.
if a later bios update is available it *may* address ram increased amounts, then and only then will it accept a full 3gb of installed ram.
because, your pc is dated it's worth looking into, but again because it dated, support has long passed for anything current.
good luck -----willy
