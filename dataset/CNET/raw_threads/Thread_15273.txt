Westell C90-610030-06. It is actually referred to as a DSL Router on the bottom of the box, so I'm not sure weather to call it a Modem or Router? Anyway, I am having trouble with it and I am looking to replace it. I am currently using a Linksys Wireless-G Router for my wireless. Anyway, my questions is: What kind of Modem do I need to purchase to replace the existing Bellsouth Modem? Will ony certain ones work or can I buy anything? Also, I noticed that Netgear makes a Modem/Router. Can this be used in place of a seperate Wireless Router?

I didn't read why you would want to pay for that. And here's a clue. If you go to the store and see a DSL modem+router the chances it is compatible with your telco is nearly 100%. You simply configure it with your name, password and provisioning information and it works. Bob
