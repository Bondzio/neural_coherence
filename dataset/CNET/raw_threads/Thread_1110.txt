Is there any color laser printer that you would recommend to print this type of card stock paper without jamming?

In other words, one that doesn't need to bend the paper in order to print and eject the finished output. This allows for less pinch&grab roller action and reduces jams, stuck, etc. in t he printer. Regardless if capable of handling 80lb. paper, it just makes for less hassle. While Robert provided a printer to think about, you responded in cost consensus way, remember, &quot;cheap is cheap&quot; and in printing the results are easily acknowledged as such. So spend what needs to be spent or respend again to replace. Since 80lb. is serious paper stock, that usually delves into serious printers that have always costed more. You may want into Canon and Mintola(sp)models as well. tada -----Willy

These were those monsters you know are in the 5 figure range so rather than bet the business on that they rented or leased them. That also cured issues of repair since the lease included maintenance calls and more. -&gt; What this also did was make sure the printing income paid the costs of these printers. If the market or sales didn't support such a printer they could end the lease. Bob
