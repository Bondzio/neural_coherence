1.1.1	The only way I know how to approach this is to explain the entire situation.	St
1.1.2	I'm very confused: i have a 500 gig seagate external hard drive that i have a bunch of stuff from an old mac backed up on... recently, i bought a windows-based notebook, but then decided i didn't like it, so i'm selling it to my dad... i hooked up the external hard drive to the notebook so i could back up songs, etc that were on there... i could not get the notebook to access to drive, so i went into disk utility and &quot;created a simple volume&quot; that was 15 gigs large, and assigned it a drive letter, which worked... i copied everything onto that simple volume... i expected that when i hooked the external drive back up to a mac, i could access those files within a volume on the drive, and all the files that were already on the drive would be in the unpartitioned space... so... i hooked the drive back up to a mac to see if it worked... but now all that displays is a 15 gig &quot;drive&quot; that is the volume i created on windows... i can't find the files that were on the drive prior to this anywhere... but then again, i can't even get the computer to recognize that there is anything there beyond the volume i created... my question is (a) did i totally screw myself and erase everything on the drive by creating that 15 gig volume?	St
1.1.3	if not (really hoping not), how do i access the data outside the volume?	St
1.1.4	i thought creating a partition/volume just created a little section within the free space that i was copied data into... was i wrong?	St
1.1.5	please help!!	Sug
1.1.6	!	St
1.2.1	Since it's a copy, why can't you go back to the original machine to get your copy back?	St
1.2.2	As to the MAC, all the details would be needed but at some point Apple added NTFS support to their OS.	St
1.2.3	If not you would install MacFuse.	St
