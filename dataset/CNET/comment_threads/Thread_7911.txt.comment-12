Ok I will use Nero 7.
I downloaded the file when I went to bed so I can make the disks.
I really would like to go over where she is to do this stuff for her I think they will have a hard time installing the DVD multi drive and chip and dont understand why they need to &quot;upgrade&quot; like this, even though it is all free.
I think she may also be confused with the 7RC and the browser 7 but I tried to explain the difference.
But thanks for the advice, the RAM is too old to be useful for a new computer and the connectors for the super multi drive wont work with a new SATA connection, but will make a big difference with her hacked together illegal OS systemed computer until they get a new one and a year should be long enough.
Thanks, Tom
