I said I would have a look in a friends PC to see if any of the memory I have kicking arround could be added. Since taking the machine home and plugging it into various monitors (I have tried several CRT and a TFT) it will not switch on the monitor. It has all the original memory in it from when it was working at my friends but it just won't turn on the monitor. The mother board in it is a Gigabyte GA-6WMM7 and it is a Paccard Bell iConnect. If anyone
