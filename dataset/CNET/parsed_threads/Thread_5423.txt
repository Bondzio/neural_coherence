<s> I have a scanner and a printer that I want to connect at the same time, but they don't seem to want to work at the same time. </s>
<s> If I connect my scanner, the printed wont' work. </s>
<s> I also can't get an embroidery digitizing program to recognize the scanner. </s>
<s> You didn't tell much, but let me share that parallel port scanners are fairly DOA for support since they were problems even back then. </s>
<s> You get to dig out the trouble guide and try it all again. </s>

<s> Guess that would help. </s>
<s> HP ScanJet 4670 and Canon i960 photo color printer. </s>
<s> Both are connected buy USB cables to the CPU. </s>
<s> I would uninstall the scanner and printer, then add back the scanner, shut down, reboot, then add the printer......shut down and reboot. </s>
<s> Then try scanning something simple, like text, to see if you are getting a printing connection. </s>
<s> I always try to stick to One MFG if I have 2 separate devices....just for the reason of compatibility. </s>
