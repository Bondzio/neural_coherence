i upgraded my computer about an hour ago, by installing a zotac gtx 650 ti (drivers were installed correctly) and a a rosewill rd600 stallion series psu.
computer worked as it is supposed to for a good 30 minutes.
however, when i entered a second game to test settings, my computer completely crashed.
no bluescreen or anything, it just instantly shut off.
now when i simply turn the psu on my system makes the first sound it normally does when it boots, but then the cpu fan turns on to full blast.
no follow-on beeps, just the cpu fan running full speed.
i have never heard it this loud before.
i do not get any video output to my monitor, and the led on the power button of my case doesn't even light up, as if the computer isn't even turned on.
i upgraded this factory model from gateway dx4840-03e the specs for this system are -1 tb hdd -intel i3 540 cpu running at ~3.1 ghz -8 gb ram thanks in advance for the help.
