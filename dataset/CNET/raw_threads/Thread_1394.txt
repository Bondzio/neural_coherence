I know I need a Core 2 Duo Processor, a 500:1 contrast ratio monitor, and 2-3 gigs of RAM. I need to know about graphics cards and such. Also, if you know any nice computer accessories (Mouse, Keyboard, etc.) that improve gaming experience let me know ;D. Thank you for your posts.

You didn't detail what part of the world you are in so if I start giving links to stores in AUS then what good is that? Let's break it down. The simplest C2D with 2GB RAM and cards off that list over 100 bucks do very well at gaming today. Bob
