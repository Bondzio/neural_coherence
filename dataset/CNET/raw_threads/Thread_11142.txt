I have yet to find software other than games that will even use the dual-core and quad-core chips. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated since I find the pricing for these high end chips to be useless to me since i'm not much of a gamer. Kudos to anyone that find software that's compatible especially in the audio/video side of software for conversion purposes.

I smiled as I used my dual Pentium Pro system while they continued to debate it. Are you using a dual core or just looking for people to agree it's a waste? Bob

I've been trying to find stuff for months since I do lots of audio/video work that requires lots of processing yet not many video convertors that use the multiple threading.using single threading programs for converting video would still be the same with multiple cores why i needed to find certain applications.

I just bought a new MAxtor ext (500GB) for video editing. It has both USB & firewire 400/800 ports. Does it make sense to capture directly to it from my camcorder. Or how best can I optimise the use? Thanks for your anticipated response. Beejow

At any given time, I usually have 3-4 windows open, and I usually have a BT client running while I'm letting BOINC use spare processor cycles. All of this on a 1+ year-old laptop running XP. Is multi-core necessary? No. But it does help keep us multi-taskers from yelling &quot;COME ON!!!!&quot; at the screen. Just my $0.02.

A multi-core is nothing more than a cheaper way to implement dual processors on a motherboard. The main use for a multi-core is for true multi-tasking. If you want to run 2 instances of Folding@Home and get the full benefit multi-core lets you do that. If you want to convert a video while doing something else on the pc without stuttering or slowing the conversion down a multi-core will help. If you'd like to run a virtual machine then a multi-core with the new virtual extensions and right motherboard chipset will help. And so on.

'till once i had tried to rendering a same 3dsmax file ( Ver.9 32bit ) with same configuration with a normal Intel Centrino and a Dual core of the same processor.I don't know how much you are familiar with Mental Ray Rendering engine and also 3dsmax ( Autodesk) Rendering but it wasn't just about the speed , on the Dual Core Laptop , there were two seperate motor engine that were rendering the image. I am wonder if they could become to 4 in the QUAD CORE Proc. or not and even how they may change from 32bit software to 64bit one , but at least i've seen that much of promotions(!) through the dual cores. hope it can help you.

Also, if you're a BOINC user, having multiple CPU cores means running multiple projects simultaneously!

In my case, I run computationally expensive, single threaded programs and I need to run them many times for satistical purposes. So, on a dual core machine, I can fire up two and they automatically get allocated to the free cores and run at full speed. In a regular user's case, this means they can do stuff like rip DVDs and do other stuff that people do without greatly affecting the performance of each application, as long as the cores aren't overloaded.

Most importantly this is done by the Operating System. The ability to do this allows more then one program to run at a time, two+ down loads at a time, run two+ scans at once, etc., etc.. There are situations where you might use two cores or more to run a single program like gaming. (game servers like Xbox 360 and Sony PS3 often use far more then two cores to run these programs, as many as eigth can be used at one time.) These are well worth the money if your time means anything to you.

Mate, press Control-Alt-Delete right now (I'm assuming you're using Windows XP or Vista and not Windows 9x or Linux!). Look at how many programs are running on your computer. Even if each program is single-threaded, the kernel will divide up the programs amongst the CPUs/cores. Even on Windows. If you do any video work, you will see a benefit to multiple cores. On my Linux system, when I'm encoding video I just tell the encoder to use two threads, and it maxes out both cores of my CPU rather than just one core. You should have a similar option on your Windows encoding software, or it might automatically do that for you. Even if it only supports a single thread, you'll have that thread using 100% of your first core, and the operating system and your other programs will use the other core. I'm not sure that dual cores will help stop your DVDs from stuttering when running a virus scan, as I'd think a virus scan would be mostly I/O bound rather than CPU bound. But I've seen a big difference since upgrading from a single-core AMD to a Core 2 Duo. But get a good Core 2 Duo rather than a cheap Core 2 Quad.
