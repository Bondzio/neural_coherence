is there any way to tweak a pc using the intel extreme graphics.
other than upgrading firmware.
adding main memory (does this help)?
i hear that using all the memory slots is more bandwidth efficient than one stick in one slot, byte or byte (is that true)?
reallocating dedicated memory?
is there a way to overclock the chipset?
its a dell 2400 with an 850e chipset and 256 mb 333mhz ram.
directx 9.0.
