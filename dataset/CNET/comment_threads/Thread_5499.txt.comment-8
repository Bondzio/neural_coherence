I'm new to overclocking.
If I do decide to go that route and get the Opteron and that board to overclock it, is it easy to do?
Is there somewhere I can go that would guide me through it?
It'd definitely something I would do assuming I wouldn't be damaging any of my new parts, or decreasing their longevity.
I would assume I would need to buy new fans in order to overclock it is that right?
Intel Conroe will come out very high in price I would assume, so it's probably not something I'd be interested in looking for, I might just go this route.
I appreciate all of your help so far, thank you very much, ~J
