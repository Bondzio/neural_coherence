Recently i tried opening a website that i frequently visit but it said &quot;Network Timed Out&quot; I had afeeling that it could be a problem with my router, so i connected the modem directly to my computer without the router and the site loads up perfectly. This has happened to multiple sites i visit. Does anyone know how to fix this? Thanks in advance.

We have suggestions that we start with such as settings and firmware. http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_CASupport_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1169671597537&packedargs=sku%3D1175233984378&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper&lid=9753784378B03&displaypage=download shows there are a few versions. But 1.01.9 dated 7/11/2007 looks to be the latest. Some routers have BLOCK LISTS. Check yours. Bob
