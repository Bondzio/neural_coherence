the graphics card won't help you with photoshop, or video encoding/rendering it will just help you with games and highly 3D intensive tasks that aren't using the CPU almost all cards on the market support AGP 4x, saying the 9550 is old is also a mistake, it's one of the newest cards in the Radeon 9x lineup my 6800GT would work in your machine, assuming the power supply could handle it since your not providing budget or PSU information, I'll suggest the GeForce FX 5500 from nVidia http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814164009 such as that one
