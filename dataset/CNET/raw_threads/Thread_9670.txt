Has worked fine until the other day when the monitor turned black and blinks with a white box in the top left corner. Can also see the desktop sometimes during the blinking. I hooked up another working monitor (same brand/model) and an older monitor to the G5 and had the same problem. Changed cables and still nothing. I am able to get the monitor to work if I restart in safe mode (extensions off). Any suggestions?

Starting in Safe Mode, as you know, turns off extensions. If the graphics card works with extensions off, then the problem is obviously software. Think back on what you have installed lately. P
