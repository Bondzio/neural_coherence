wile fat 32 may be faster , ntfs is a lot cleaner.
think of it this way.
on your desk right now you may have several notes & books , disk's or whatever spread around.
you may know the exact location of each item as you use them quite often.
it's fast for you to locate.
however, you may also have everything quite organized in a complex filing system.
you know where everything is stored but you have to go through several channels to locate the item you are looking for.
ntfs is just that, it has the ability of compressing larger files to a much smaller space & in doing so can make the search for the items slower.
the head on your hard drive moves back & forth in a much tighter motion wile on fat 32 it moves in a more free motion.
i prefer ntfs simply because i like having the extra disk space.
my 80 gig hard drive is now 2 years old & stuffed with all sorts of programs, somewhere along the lines of 75 not to mention 2000 or so mp3's & my entire ( gaming collection ).
this totals to 29.3 gb & leaves me with approx.
35 extra gigs of storage.
consider all your programs & files before you choose the format thats right for you & ask yourself is your hard drive big enough to handle fat 32 ?
bigger hard drive = longer search or is it fast enough for ntfs ?
smaller hard drive = shorter search.
i hope this helps you to understand in some way how the filing systems work & what they are designed to do.
