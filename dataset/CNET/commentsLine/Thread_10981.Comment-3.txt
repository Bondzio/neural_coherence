my suggestion would be to get a complete unit.
this way you know the thing works or don't work.
if it doesn't work then just return it; no decession as to which part of the unit is bad.
personally i always build mine (3.5&quot;) and i have used maxtor, wd, etc.
which ever give me the best bargain.
i found these thing are fairly reliable.
just my thought.
