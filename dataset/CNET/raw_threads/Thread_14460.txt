The motherboard and hard drive were replaced, but the same problem recurred in 4 weeks. Hard drive was then replaced again, but the problem repeated immediately. HP proposes trying the hard drive replacement again. Machine is running Windows 7 64 bit, and I have made no hardware modifications. It was purchased in January, 2011. Has anyone experienced this problem? Can anything else be done to solve this problem?

At the office it's 4 years since the last drive failure. However that's at the office, on UPS and in locked room so users can't touch it. Bob
