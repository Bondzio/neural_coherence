well silly me, I lied, turns out the floppy drive was unplugged.
was able to boot with it.
so I think what happened was when i plugged in this old drive, it was jumpered as master and took over as C drive, probably wrote somehing into the OS on the main HD in the comp, corrupting it, giving the error.
thisd is all win98-- --fj
