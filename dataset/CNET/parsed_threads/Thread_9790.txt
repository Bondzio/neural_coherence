<s> Recently I scavenged an old 486 laptop. </s>
<s> It boots and says it is ''Media Magic PN315/DSTN''. </s>
<s> BIOS detects 8mb of RAM. </s>
<s> I want to put it to work somehow, but first i would like to put in more memory. </s>
<s> The beast has 2 slots filled with strange memory modules. </s>
<s> I never met such things. </s>
<s> Please help me identify them. </s>

<s> [br] Do I have any chance of finding the upgrade? </s>
<s> Where would you advice to look? </s>
<s> google search gives pretty much nothing relevant. </s>
<s> It seems to have existed indeed, because it's mentioned by http://www.racore.com/solutions/3060.html However, www.crucial.com (the standard site for looking for memory) has never heard of 'media magic'. </s>
<s> A search for pn315 only turns up very standard looking PC 133 128 and 256 MB SDRAM and that doesn't look right at all. </s>
<s> I think the chances of finding this memory are rather small. </s>
<s> Moreover, do you have any information on the maximum amount of RAM supported? </s>
<s> It might be 8 or 16, which still isn't much. </s>
<s> The interesting question: what's the OS on this machine, and what would you want to do with it once you put in more memory? </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Many laptops from that era topped out at 8M to 16MB. </s>
<s> About all I see running on such is the DOS/Windows 3.1 that matched that time as well as DAMN SMALL LINUX. </s>

<s> Thanks everyone for help, It looks like EDO memory. </s>
<s> I found the datasheet on the chip used (424400) and tracked the pinout with a tester. </s>
<s> Each of the modules seem to have 32-bit wide data bus, 4 CAS signals to strobe the column address for each individual byte, and 1 RAS. </s>
<s> So it is pretty much like 72pin SIMM, though with only one RAS signal. </s>
<s> By the way I checked through JEDEC JESD-21C standard. </s>
<s> It lists a lot of wierd memory configs but none with 60 pins on it. </s>
<s> So the memory does not conform to JEDEC. </s>
<s> On both memory slots CAS signals different, as well as RASes. </s>
<s> All other signals are common to both slots. </s>
<s> I just wonder if a bit of soldering will enable me to use a regular 72 pin SIMM in here. </s>
<s> Am I understanding correctly, that wiring just one RAS signal to the SIMM will simply allow me to use just half of memory? </s>
<s> Dear Bob, do you remember what was the cause for this limit. </s>
<s> Was it unovercomable hardware limitations or it was BIOS? </s>
<s> Why I am asking - if it is BIOS - then I can simply specify the memory size for Linux loader and for Windows loader explicitly. </s>
<s> I found an old i266mmx with 64MB for 99 bucks (a Compaq Armada.) </s>
<s> What this proves is that for the cost of old EDO RAM (unless found cheap) that you should start hunting down other laptops. </s>
<s> This thing would be like you trying to take a Model A on a freeway or to the local repair shop. </s>
<s> The limits were not the address space of the CPU but economics of those days where 64MB could cost well past a few 1,000 bucks. </s>
<s> Being that no one could put that much RAM in, the designs were made to only support 8 to 16MB for many boards. </s>
<s> In closing, I'd only explore use with DOS/Win3.1 or Damn Small Linux. </s>
