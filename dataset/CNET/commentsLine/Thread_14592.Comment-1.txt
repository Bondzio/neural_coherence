i am trying to make my system faster in an inexpensive way.
my computer is an amd 1.1 with two hard drives the first one being 30gb and the second 6.4gb.
i am also running windows me and have a 52x cdrw.
i only have 194 mb of ram in it.
i know that this probably sounds like a dumb question,but how can i speed up the thing without spending much?
