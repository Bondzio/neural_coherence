<s> I have a HP Compaq Presario R3000 laptop computer, running Windows XP. </s>
<s> Linksys Wireless-G Broadband Router w/Speed Booster. </s>
<s> Model: WRT54GS Linkseys USB plug in also. </s>
<s> Problem: This setup worked well for a long time, but now I'm having a problem that happens often. </s>
<s> It will say the signal strength is Excellent, but the Speed will go all the way down to 1.0 Mbps. </s>
<s> The most is 54. </s>
<s> Right now it is at 54, but a few minutes ago it was only 18. </s>
<s> I checked with my service provider. </s>
<s> They did a test and found that things were alright at their end. </s>
<s> They suggested it must be the router. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what could be causing this problem to come and go like this? </s>
<s> I did have a phone on my desk near the computer, but I took it out and still have the same problem. </s>
<s> Also, I am only a few feet away from the router with no obstructions between. </s>
<s> The only way I get this to go back to the faster speed is to unplug my router for a few minutes and then plug it back in again. </s>
<s> And, one more thing, most of the time when I start up my computer in the morning, it will not go online at all. </s>
<s> I usually have to reboot my computer to get it to go online. </s>
<s> Kind of a pain. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Any ideas will be appreciated. </s>
<s> Both have 802.11B cards inside. </s>
<s> But these are very old machines so we learned to disable the onboard cards and use 802.11g PC-Cards for these machines. </s>
<s> There is ONE OTHER THING and it's very simple. </s>
<s> If the wifi is secured poorly (WEP, MAC filters or less) then simple kid friendly software can hijack and interfere with the connections. </s>
<s> We cover this in the Cnet networking forum so I won't write more about that. </s>

<s> Hi Bob, Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> My computer doesn't have a wifi card inside. </s>
<s> I'm using a USB Linksys card. </s>
<s> This 802.11g. </s>
<s> I don't know too much about this, but I checked my security and it says WEP(64bit). </s>
<s> I don't know what that means, but I'm sure you do. </s>
<s> Is it good or bad? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> There are kid friendly softwares to smack down, hijack and worse WEP or less protected connections. </s>
<s> This forum has a top post. </s>
<s> Change to WPA and see if the situation improves. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well, I read the top post, and then I went in and changed to WPA-Personal. </s>
<s> It took me a bit to do it correctly, but now I'm up and running again with WPA. </s>
<s> So, now I will try this for a while and see if it works better. </s>
<s> Right now the speed is up to 54. </s>
<s> Thanks so much. </s>
<s> I would be lost without you. </s>
<s> Remove a common cause that leads to complaints like this. </s>
<s> Many want to test that it is that which is a good question but the answer is to change and see if that helps. </s>
<s> Then we have folk that go beyond the changes we note in the top forum and end up with trouble. </s>
<s> Let's see how it fairs. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I changed it like you suggested and it seemed to work better. </s>
<s> Now, I am being disconnected from the wi-fi every so often. </s>
<s> Also, when I first start my computer I have a very hard time getting a connection. </s>
<s> It used to connect automatically when I started my computer. </s>
<s> Now,it won't all the time. </s>
<s> Sometimes it will if I restart the computer. </s>
<s> Right now I'm not on wi-fi, because it cut out on me before today when I was doing some office work and I lost my work, so I hard wired it back up to my service provider. </s>
<s> I click on the Linksys icon and sometimes the software to connect comes up and sometimes it won't. </s>
<s> Other times it comes up and I try to connect, but it won't. </s>
<s> There doesn't seem to be a pattern to what it is doing. </s>
<s> It is strange though, my computer is the main one and I'm about 2 feet from the router and I can't get online. </s>
<s> My husband's computer is in the other end of the house and he can be online while I can't. </s>
<s> So...it seems it has something to do with my computer. </s>
<s> Last night the spped went down to 1 again. </s>
<s> Just don't get it. </s>
<s> The other bad thing that is happening is that my computer shuts off by itself every once in awhile. </s>
<s> I'm thinking the fan might be dirty, but I do not know how to get inside this laptop, and clean it. </s>
<s> Any advice on any of this? </s>
<s> HP Compaq Presario R3000 Linkeys wireless-G Linkseys adaptor Thanks. </s>
<s> The WRT54GS can be very picky on settings. </s>
<s> For example some will follow the forum suggestions &quot;almost.&quot; That is they'll do the WPA, but add MAC filters. </s>
<s> The forum suggestions are hard earned knowledge. </s>
<s> Tell what you used. </s>
<s> But if the router's wifi has troubles (age, failures, interfering signals) then wired is best. </s>
<s> What some don't know is wifi is never a sure thing. </s>
<s> In short it's in the open air space and can be interfered with by many things. </s>
<s> The industry can't be honest here. </s>
<s> They want to sell it but if you were honest then more folk would stay wired. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Site Information: SSID Bonnie Wireless Mode: infrastructure Channel: 11 Security: WPA-Personal MAC Address: 00-22-6B-4B-8D-A2 Profile Information: Transfer rate: Auto Channel: Auto Security: WPA-Personal Authentication: TKIP It sounds like wi-fi is tempermental. </s>
<s> I like wired, but then my hubby can't get online with his computer too, and we can't take them outside on the porch etc. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Is what that router is set at the factory or defaults. </s>
<s> Since most don't change that, it can be a be crowded. </s>
<s> Try channel 3 or 6 to move away from other systems. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> maybe that will help. </s>
<s> I notice when I do a site survey with my Linksys software it usually shows me on 11, two or three people on 6, and one on 1. </s>
<s> So, I can change it to 3 and see how that works. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Newer routers have a new feature to &quot;find the least crowded channel&quot; when they boot. </s>
<s> This helps keep the interference down. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm glad they came up with that. </s>
<s> Thanks for letting me know. </s>
