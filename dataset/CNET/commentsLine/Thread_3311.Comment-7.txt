where are you finding the deal on the ram?
newegg has 512 ddr500 for less than a gig of ddr400.
and as for the cpu.
thoughts about a 3400+... obviously amd has faster ones out there but that one was roughly the price of the 3.2 ghz p4 i was looking at and from what little i've seen of comparisons is fairly close to the same performance as the 3.2. also would it be better to buy a better motherboard and not quite as good of a cpu or the other way around?
meaning a $100 board and say a 3700+ cpu or a $200 motherboard and a 3200+ or 3400+?
