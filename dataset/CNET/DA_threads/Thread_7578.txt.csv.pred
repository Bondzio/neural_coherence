1.1.1	Then 10 screen of the MSI Wind Netbook is an immediate starting point for a number of the users and offers an advantage over many of the other netbooks available .	St
1.1.2	This size is great as it allows the portability of the product to remain but also ensures the screen is big enough to handle websites comfortably .	St
1.1.3	As one of the key points of netbooks is to allow internet usage on the go , being able to handle cutting edge web sites is an important factor for any netbook to take care of .	St
1.1.4	Another important asset is portability and clocking in at 1kg will see the netbook fit into the bag of any user with no great difficulty or weight .	St
1.1.5	The slightly larger size which facilitates the larger screen also allows for a lager sized keyboard when compared to many other netbooks available on the market which makes it more comfortable for a great number of users .	St
1.1.6	People who regularly use a PC or full size laptop may find it difficult to switch between their standard keyboard and the netbook option but the MSI Wind Netbook provides a great middle ground for users .	St
1.1.7	This is indicative of the merging between different computer sizes and soon it will be difficult to tell the difference between a notebook and a netbook but for now , this product is one of the best available .	St
1.2.1	Good review , Nile .	St
1.2.2	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.3	Quick question : are there different kinds of U135 models out there in regard to batteries ?	Ques
1.2.4	I 'm looking for a netbook and the U135 was rated as one of the higher overall , so when I saw one on & quot ; sale & quot ; yesterday , I was considering getting it .	St
1.2.5	Then I checked here on the U135 and found it was priced about $ 75 cheaper online .	St
1.2.6	When I looked at the specs on it , I found that it has a 3-cell battery .	St
1.2.7	But the guy at the store ( who seemed to know a bit about it , but of course appearances can be deceiving ) told me it was a 6-cell .	St
1.2.8	I would 've thought that a factory model of a computer/laptop/netbook would be been fixed : an MSI Wind U135 has this , and this , and this , period .	St
1.2.9	But are there different sub-categories within that model ?	Ques
1.2.10	In short , IS there a U135 with a 6-cell battery , or are they all 3-cell and did I dodge a bullet by passing on the inflated & quot ; sale & quot ; yesterday ?	Ques
1.3.1	http : //www.msimobile.com/level2_productlist.aspx ? search=U135 U135 just indicates what line of netbooks it is .	St
1.3.2	The numbers following that specify what particular model of netbook is from that line .	St
1.3.3	So it 's possible that two U*** netbooks could have different batteries .	St
1.3.4	This actually does happen in other series , such as the U123 series .	St
