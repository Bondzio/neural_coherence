hey, i have a dell computer...bottom of the line, we wont even mention it, but anyway...the hdd is only 40gb and well, that isnt that much room.
i went in to disk management and it says there are 2 partitions on my hdd.
one is my normal c: drive which has 34gb, and there are only 5 left haha.
the other is 3gb fat32 partition and it even says in parenthesis unknown partition.
is this safe to delete?
