The newer owners are being tossed into the deep end and just like it has been for decades we save or install our apps on the drive of our choice. There seems to be a thought among newer users this is a design flaw but let's say it is. Why not return it if the retailer and maker won't answer your questions? Bob

You might want to check DISK MANAGEMENT to see how the total space is allocated. You've already accounted for 258GBs and 186GBs...that's 444GBs....is there more FREE SPACE or perhaps a hidden recovery partition somewhere? If yes....then you got what was advertised and maybe then some. Recommend you verify the facts before losing more sleep or wasting more time. VAPCMD
