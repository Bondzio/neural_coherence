Take a look at some of the box stores to see what is offered, there should be a lot of them out there.
Places such as Office Depot or Staples would be good starting points.
The new I-5 or I-7 7 Intel or the AMD quad core processor would do the job coupled with enough ram, 8 GB's or more, basic onboard graphics should be good enough, if not most have slots to input a stand alone video cards, should that be needed.
