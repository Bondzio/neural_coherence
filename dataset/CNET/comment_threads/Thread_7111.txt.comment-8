Well I'm under the impression that if the jumper is set to anything not listed under the choices, it defaults to CS.
I think I'll try it without the jumper.
Just plugged the external w/ usb to another laptop, still being detected alright but still no drive.
So it looks like it might be something wrong when I turned it off last time.
