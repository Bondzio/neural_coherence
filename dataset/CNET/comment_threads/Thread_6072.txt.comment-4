I have allmost the same computer only mine is the pcv rx 500.
It is my understanding that you cannot use a prossesor with more than 400 fsb.
I checked with asus web site as mine has a asus mobo.
That limits the prossesor to a 2.8 gi,400 fsb and no hyperthreading Newegg has them for $168.
I have consitered putting in a new motherboard but that involves several problems.
First the power suppy on my VAIO case is in the middle, I don't know if this makes it a propriatory Mobo but it may cause some problems with fit.
Second, if I put a new mobo and prosesor in I will not be able to use my vaio system recovery disc witch includes my operating system so I would have to buy a new copy of XP.
I hope this helps.
