I'm breathing some life into an old computer we have.
It's a no name brand put together by a local computer store no longer in business.
I took off the cover and saw 1 Samsumg 128mb chip w/ 2 empty slots next to it.
The number on the chip is M368L1713CT1-CBO.
Is it possible to increase the memory to something like 4gb?
What are my options?
Thanks.
Ed.
