In the event log, look for any obivous clue.
Since it freezes it won't be able to report but there's a chance it may.
As for any heat issues, run the PC with cover off and fan blowing IN and see if it lasts longer or gets further before a freeze.
I mentioned a possible AMD issue as together with the AMD chipset could be an issue, but check the AMD forum and query there and/or review what's posted.
Also, you may want to &quot;repaste&quot; the cpu to HSF setup using the thermo paste like Arctic Silver for better operation instead of any &quot;thermal tape setup.
Check Arctic Silver website for such details.
