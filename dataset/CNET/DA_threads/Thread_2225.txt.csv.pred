1.1.1	I got a 500GB Western Digital Caviar SE (wd5000jbrtl).	St
1.1.2	It seems like it's not compatible with my Windows 2003 Server.	St
1.1.3	Any recommendations.	St
1.1.4	I'm running a 7VM400M-RZ Motherboard.	St
1.2.1	That drive has been seen loaded up with Windows 2003 so the problem must be elsewhere.	St
1.2.2	Take the machine to a shop and have them show you it working.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Don't be sorry.	St
1.3.2	Thanks for the reply.	St
1.3.3	I'm guessing you checked somewhere on the internet for that response (can I get the resource?).	St
1.3.4	Perhaps I'm talking to Western Digital next.	St
1.4.1	I was lucky to have seen both the SATA and IDE model running Windows server.	St
1.4.2	It's about 99.99% sure the problem is not the drive.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	you've spent your valuable time to give me advice, i really appreciate it.	Polite
1.5.2	i did find the drive said it was compatible with windows 2000/xp/vista, and when i tried to load the software it came with it wouldn't work with my version of windows.	St
1.5.3	ah well.	St
1.5.4	again, i think i'm calling wd.	St
1.5.5	thanks again!	Polite
