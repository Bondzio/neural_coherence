im using xp home (pentium 4, 1.4 ghz, 256 mb ram, geforce 2) and i just installed a plextor px-716a dvd burner with the latest firmware (1.06) and software for it.
this was installed yesterday and i burned a data cd to make sure it was working right after i installed it.
it is on the secondary ide port as master with nothing else on that port.
ultra dma is on.
when i read the booklet i think it said something about older computers not being able to work with ultra dma and that the computer would hang.
i dunno, thinking of the possibilities.
i get the following message when i start windows (after it detects the drives): we apologize for the inconvenience but windows did not start successfully.
a recent hardware or software change might have caused this... (options): 1. safe mode 2. safe mode with networking 3. safe mode with command prompt 4. last known good configuration (your most recent settings that worked) 5. start windows normally i tried them all and none worked.
i disconnected the dvd burner and still none worked.
the computer kept restarting after trying every option.
when i selected safe mode, a bunch of files loaded, then it restarted anyway.
the farthest the computer starting up progress goes, is to the windows sign where it then restarts.
can someone help please.
i have files that are very important to my job on it.
tell me if there is anything else u want to know.
