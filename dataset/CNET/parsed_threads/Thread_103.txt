<s> Hello like a week ago i went to start my computer and when it start it went into a black screen which say &quot;bios update compatible, Do not insert a cd or a floppy disk if you want to update from usb drive&quot; the computer was working fine, it just went in this stage from the night to the morning, is first time i see something like this. </s>
<s> Can someone help me solve this little puzzle! </s>
<s> Its all due to your bios settings is upset..resetup the setting and this problem will be resolve.... </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> That's a rather strange message. </s>
<s> In fact, it's unique. </s>
<s> Google has never heard from it. </s>
<s> Your post is the only one on the whole Internet that mentions it. </s>
<s> So I suppose it's some other message. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> There has to be something wrong with the wording in the original post regards the message, that makes mo sense. </s>
<s> No sense, but I assume you got the drift. </s>
<s> well thats the same i was thinking, i google it and anything came up, i will take a pic and post exactly what it says. </s>
<s> well i try to write the main thing it says, i will post the exact message, which wont be to different from this one. </s>
<s> Boot Block Compatible Ver .012 Please do NOT insert any disc into CD-ROM or floopy drive if you want to recovery with an USB device. </s>
<s> EZ-Flash starting BIOS update..... </s>
<s> This is the exact message and it has been there for over 3 hours and nothing happens, Have anyone had this screen before? </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/302636-30-updating-bios-flash OK. Look around for ANY device that is attached. </s>
<s> CD/DVD/USB and all hard drives and after you power off, disconnect and unplug those. </s>
<s> The update should only be happening if the BIOS detected the update file on some device. </s>
<s> If not, you get to exchange the motherboard. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> could it be the motherboard that is dead? </s>
<s> in case i need to replace the motherboard will i have to install the system again? </s>
<s> If you replace the motherboard with exactly the same model, everything will continue to work. </s>
<s> But if you replace it with another type, you'll most likely have to do a completely clean install from the Windows disk. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Did you try what I noted? </s>
<s> i will try once i get home, am right now @ the hospital following up a fracture in my leg, but as soon as i get back i will let you know. </s>
<s> I guess am kind of having bad luck lately, first the computer, then my leg, i don't know what next, lol </s>
