The problem is that the Epson Lion setup advisor (to which you linked) directs you to install the printer through 'System Preferences...Add Printer...' process. SysPref then looks for the printer software, then advises 'software unavailable....check manufacturer website, etc'. It winds up being an endless loop. I find it hard to believe that a company like Epson would fail to keep its fairly recent products current with an OS as widely used as OSX 10.7. But it appears that that may be the case. Any other ideas/recommendations would be gratefully appreciated.
