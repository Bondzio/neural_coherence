hi, operating system win xp pro sp2, machine hp 1029.uk with 2gb memory.
my wireless adapter is a talktalk snu5630ns 05. using the administrative account it connects fine, but if i go into the limited account it doesn't connect (or just says connection is limited so no internet).
any thoughts please?
