<s> When I turn this computer one It just does one long beep over and over and over I was wondering what this ment? </s>
<s> It wont boot up at all. </s>
<s> Look here. </s>
<s> http://www.pcguide.com/ts/x/sys/beep/ </s>
<s> is that the BIOS has notified you of a fatal hardware error. </s>
<s> This could be RAM, processor or video. </s>
<s> It could just be a poor connection such as an unseated component. </s>
<s> AGP video cards are notorious for this because of the construction of the card edge and MB slot. </s>
<s> They tend to creep with pressure from tightening screws and the cable. </s>
<s> Such is probably why newer versions are locked in place. </s>
<s> Take everything apart and reseat it. </s>
<s> Try disconnecting what is not vital and try again. </s>
<s> This might help to disclose a weak power supply. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Ok well we tryed pulling stuff out like 1 think then another and the only time it dident do the long beep is when the processor was out of it. </s>
<s> I'm guessing that means the processer is broke? </s>
