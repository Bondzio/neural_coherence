You should be able to get one for around $50 and it's best to stick to the same brand for troubleshooting problems. You should already own a wireless router and need only an USB adapter for the Xbox.

In particular one of my friends has the MS wireless adapter and another an Ethernet cable. My friend with the wireless adapter can use easily with his network with little problems, fast download speeds and little lag. My friend with the wired connection on the other hand had to change his ISP from tiscally to BT (in the UK this is) as only BT can do 360 Ethernet connection. The wired connection caused more problems and in the end costs more because of the ISP change.

You can often find it for considerably less than the Microsoft adapter. Previously using MS adapter, then router died. Had to move to this as the MS adapter was incompatible with my new pre-N router from that I purchased from Netgear.
