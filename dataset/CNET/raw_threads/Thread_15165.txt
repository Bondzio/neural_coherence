It's always inactive/greyed out but always reappears after I delete it. Any idea what could be connecting initially and then sleeping?? thanks for your time.

You can always lock out access to that device through your router and see which of your devices loses access. I once had a MAC address that I didn't recognize on my network. It took some time but I figured out it belonged to a media streamer that I only occasionally used. I make a list of all devices and associated MAC addresses so that I can periodically review the list on my router and make sure there are no unauthorized devices connected.
