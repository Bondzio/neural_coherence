That was a problem about this version of Tweakui.
Once you read how to install TWEAKUI, proceed to the panel that allows you to show/hide drive letters and make sure all are allowed.
TWEAKUI installs by a right-click on the .INF and then selecting install.
Maybe you tried that, but didn't write you did.
Always elaborate as much as possible.
