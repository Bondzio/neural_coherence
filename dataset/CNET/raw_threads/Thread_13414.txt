I went into sounds on the control panel and the music works when I test it there. I uninstalled my sound card in device manager and then restarted and windows put it back but still no music.

It might help you further diagnose the problem. James

Click start, click run, type regedit and enter. click on HKEY_CURRENT_USER to highlight it, then in the right plain where it says (default) REG_SZ value not set right click on (default) click delete and your problem hopefully will be sorted Its an easy fix usually happens after a bsod or a faulty download, if your not sure about changing things in your registry than i would recommend you back it up first before doing anything, but like i said before its an easy fix and if you follow what i have said you should be ok.
