<s> I live in a 3 story townhouse and my pc is set up on the first floor. </s>
<s> My cable company provides my internet and phone services. </s>
<s> I am on bedrest and am restricted to the 3rd floor so I have purchased a laptop. </s>
<s> I want to be able to use it from the 3rd floor so I need to set up some type of network. </s>
<s> I called the cable company and was told all I need to do is get a splitter and wireless router and hook it up to my cable connection on the third floor. </s>
<s> I believe it entails more than that and wanted to check. </s>
<s> I thought the router needed to be connected to my cable modem but that wouldn't work for me since it is on the 1st floor. </s>
<s> any advice would be helpful. </s>
<s> signal will reach the top floor. </s>
<s> Some will move the router closer using a length of ethernet cable. </s>
<s> Others have success in improving the reception by using those antenna extenders. </s>
<s> Only a test drive will tell. </s>
<s> You need to hook the wireless router up to your cable modem. </s>
<s> Then you will hook your PC up to the wireless router, through one of its wired jacks. </s>
<s> After you hook up your new router to your wireless modem, make sure you reboot (power off, power on) the modem. </s>
<s> The problem you will probably encounter is that the wireless signal may not reach from the first floor to the third floor. </s>
<s> The easiest way around this is to move your cable modem to the second floor. </s>
<s> This will only work if you can move your phone up also. </s>
<s> If you have a cable jack that you are not using, then you will not need a splitter. </s>
<s> Otherwise, disconnect the TV or cable box from the wall. </s>
<s> Then connect a two-way splitter to the wall using a short cable. </s>
<s> Make sure to connect the input side of the splitter to the wall. </s>
<s> Then reconnect the cable box or TV to one of the output jacks of the splitter. </s>
<s> Then connect your cable modem to the other output of the splitter. </s>
<s> Now you will need to connect a wireless card to your pc downstairs. </s>
<s> The easiest way to do this is to use a USB wireless card. </s>
<s> You should have adequate wireless signal to connect to upstairs and downstairs. </s>
<s> If these options do not work for you, then you will have to install some additional ethernet wiring. </s>
<s> With your wireless router you can buy a compatable antenna for it that has a stronger dbi range. </s>
<s> For example. </s>
<s> Most wireless routers come with antennas that may have a max range of about 2dbi which indoors is about 100-300 feet but this leaves opertunities for dead spots or poor wireless signal. </s>
<s> That is why some hotels only offer wireless from the lobby because it is closer to the wireless router. </s>
<s> But if you get a antenna with a higher dbi like for example a 7dbi your range will be tripled. </s>
<s> I would think of this way as being the cheapest method. </s>
<s> Otherwise you can add a range expander to your wireless router that is ac adaptable and the signal should reach fine. </s>
