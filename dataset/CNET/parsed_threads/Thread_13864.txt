<s> ...to replace the NT 4.0 dinosaur that Sensei Proffit has helped me keep alive. </s>
<s> SPECS: Pentium Pro200(two of them) 512K EDO RAM, Running Windows NT, Microsoft Backoffice Server and Microsoft Exchange to provide a smooth running, reliable machine that works 24/7 on our small, 8-workstation network. </s>
<s> We get around the 5-user thing with Exchange 'cause not all 8 folks are in the office at the same time. </s>
<s> I want to upgrade the machine, that part I can handle. </s>
<s> I'll use Win2K,(maybe XP but I don't see alot of difference) a Pentium D or HT 3.0 GHZ, Intel Mobo, 2 SATA 36GB raptors striped and at least 2GB of RAM. </s>
<s> Backup will be Veritas BE 9.1 daily to tape, Sony SCSI 11000. </s>
<s> So, how do I ''move in'' to the new machine? </s>
<s> Should I use the NT SCOPY feature then upgrade the OS, or should I start from scratch and install Win2000, Microsoft Backoffice and Microsft exchange then just drag and drop the appropriate folders? </s>
<s> What would you do? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> XP and Windows 2000 Pro will not host your server applications and the install should fail. </s>
<s> Microsoft's Server OS map looks like this: NT (various) Server -&gt; 2000 (various) Server -&gt; 2003 (varous) Server. </s>
<s> If you need more storage, split that onto a new machine and leave the Dual Pro with what doesn't move. </s>

<s> ...on the new machine, reinstalling all apps and then doing SCOPY or recovery from backup tape? </s>
<s> I think it's time to make plans toward decommissioning the old PPro girl. </s>

<s> Well make sure that there are NT drivers for the new MB and video card and any new hardware. </s>
<s> W2K server or W2003 server would be better. </s>
<s> but it's $$$$$. </s>
<s> If your makeing a new server PC this would be the time to do the change over. </s>
<s> Bring the new one online with the NT server and do a change over then take the NT offline. </s>

<s> ...then I will need to buy a newer Exchange Server than my present 5.5. </s>
<s> Funny how Microsoft makes you buy the whole suit, not just the pants or jacket... </s>
<s> I will be sure the MB supports NT, I hope I can find one w/ SATA. </s>
<s> I'll be back when it's built, you can count on that! </s>
<s> Thanks all... Tony </s>
