My preference would be a internal pci card. I've checked reviews and opinions at a few sites, but you either love it or hate it. Theres two card in particular I've been looking at Wintv-250 and LEADTEK TV2000 XP DELUXE. Pretty big difference between them ( price performance encoding ect... )I don't mind spending the money if it's good but I just don't really know? One more question, DVD compatibility.They have a list at http://www.hauppauge.com/dvdplayers/ Why would there be a defference between cd-r and cd-rw media? I don't understand why for example the Sony DVPs 525D will only play cd-rw DVD's and not cd-r DVD's that would burned? Any comments or suggestions welcomed. Thanks in advance!

I've unsure about spending more, but do make DVD and S/VCD content from recordings from that card and it's capture software. My last 8X DVD Plus and Minus DVD recorder was 99 bucks so as prices go, this is cheap compared to last year. Bob
