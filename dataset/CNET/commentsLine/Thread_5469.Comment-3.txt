i don't know if will be helpful or not but i had the same problem with all 3 of my optical drives.
the culprit was slysoft's anydvd.
i would suggest that you check to see if this particular piece of software is on your machine.
after going into the registry and deleting all references to slysoft and anydvd and rebooting all 3 optical drives reappeared.
good luck
