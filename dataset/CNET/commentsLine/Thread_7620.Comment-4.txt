you have stated that you increased the count of ip addresses the dhcp server can assign.
in the admin page for the router, what is the starting ip address for the dhcp server?
xxx.xxx.xxx.150 or xxx.xxx.xxx.101 or other?
what is the subnet mask on the 101 computer?
255.255.255.0 ?
do you get any error message when you enter ''ipconfig /renew'' command?
static ip addresses shoudn't be a problem for the router.
the router will use the static ip addresses that it discovers on the computers/network devices before it attempts to assign an ip address via dhcp.
