definitely go with a dual core laptop.
there are 3 main flavors: intel core duo, intel core 2 duo, and amd turion 64 x2.
sometimes you'll see &quot;pentium dual core&quot; which is really a core duo.
the turion 64 x2s are about as fast as a core duo at the same processor speed (ghz); core 2 duo is about 12% faster at the same processor speed.
