1.1.6	THE QUESTIONS : 1 .	St
1.1.7	Can I over kill on vid card so much as to cause problems ? ?	Ques
1.1.8	2 .	St
1.1.9	Since everything about this mobo is Nvidia , will this old hardware & quot ; like & quot ; a new Radeon card as well as it might & quot ; like & quot ; a new NVidea ?	Ques
1.1.10	You wonder why spend money on old set ...	St
1.1.11	I dunno , I LIKE my old box , I guess I just want to see how far I can max it out .	St
1.1.12	My retirement income is such that I can find extra $ 100 once in a while , but if I build new , I would not be content to go low end .	St

1.2.1	Let me mention 2 cards I own and have put on a Watt Meter ( similar to the P3 Watt Meter ) .	St

1.2.3	1 .	St
1.2.4	A Nvidia 9500GT with 512MB .	St
1.2.5	The socket 939 box tops out at 120 Watts in total and idles at 70ish Watts .	St
1.2.6	I tried an ATI card but it pegged the CPU so I went with Nvidia .	St
1.2.7	2 .	St
1.2.8	A Nvidia GeForce GT 220 1024 MB DDR3 PCI-Express Graphics Card http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SG7LUQ/ref=oss_product I chose this because of the Watts but also because the next model up had complaints of fan noise .	St
1.2.9	The GT 220 on a HP d4999t w/4GB RAM , etc tops out at 140 Watts and is very nice .	St

1.5.1	It sounds like the upgrade was a success .	St
1.5.2	It looks like my kid may get one of these .	St
1.5.3	A HP d5000t quad core was found cheap so we moved his old Nvidia 6600 card over and he is settling in .	St
