-12, -5 are rated at about 300-400ma, while other voltages are rated 5a-20a.
the point being that the minus voltages can be easily burnt out.
i don't think they have the same interupt as the + voltages do.
short out the +5v and the pwr supp will restart instead of burn out.
lightening or other way excessive surges can more easily burn out -voltages, as has been my experience.
