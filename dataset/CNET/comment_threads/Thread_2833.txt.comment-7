I am using a Westell 2110 Dual connect router with Verizon.
The model is B90 210015-04.
I have noticed that they now offer a combined modem and router with their service.
We need to check with them anyway since we could get a much cheaper rate by paying for a year.
They were supposed to replace the model some time ago and didn't.
I found a new Ehternet cable made all the difference in the connection.
We also moved it up higher so it didn't get bumped.
