The software you are using is very demanding and specialized.
So you will need a computer to handle these aspects.
You might find you need to increase your budget to get what your after.
I'd contact several of these sources by phone and discuss your needs with them directly.
Also you might wish to restate your question on the Graphics or Photography & Design forum(s).
You might recieve a better response there.
