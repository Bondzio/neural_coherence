as to a do-it-yourself item some have loads of fun trying to get such to work proper.
maybe you can look on google.com about &quot;build your own media pc&quot; or such but the mce+360 combo is nice.
apple will have their itv out soon so you should look there if you want to &quot;see how it should be done.&quot; bob
