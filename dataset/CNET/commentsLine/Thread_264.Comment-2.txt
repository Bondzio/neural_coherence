some other questions: 2. what's your own antivirus?
how do you know you've got exactly those 2 viruses?
why doesn't your own antivirus not quarantine or remove them?
3. did you try it (installing your friends antivirus) in safe mode?
4. what instructions did you find (a link please)?
5. i assume the manual instructions involve some editing of the registry.
if you do it carefully, it's not a great risk.
6. can you afford to buy a new hard disk and do a clean install of your os on that and afterwards get your files (the files you didn't backup) from the old disk?
