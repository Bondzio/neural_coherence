I just added a new 100 GB hard drive to my Dell desktop computer because I ran out of storage.
I need to know how to transfer all files and data from my old drive to the new.
I specifically tried to transfer my iTunes folder to the new drive, since it was the largest folder, and it didn't work.
I suspect it has to do with system files being on the &quot;C&quot; (original) drive and the programs don't know to look for the songs on the &quot;F&quot; (new) drive.
Should I just &quot;Disk Copy&quot; or purchase a transfer utility program?
If there is an easier solution, I would be gratefule for the tip.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks.
