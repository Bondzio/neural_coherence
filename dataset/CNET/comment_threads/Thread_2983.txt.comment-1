Past few months my computer has been freezing and honestly i dont know why.
At first i thought it was a virus or malware, scanned and scanned again.
Nothing came up, so i tried to reinstall windows.
That didnt work still froze.
Then my psu went, thought maybe thats why it was freezing because it was old.Then i thought maybe there is a virus but i need to really clean it out, so i got a hd scrubber, that didnt work.
This machine is old, could this be because of its age?Could the motherboard be shorting out?
Or the processor?
Its about 5 years id say.
Its a : Amd Athlon 2700 processor 120 gb hdd 2gb ram Win xp pro 400w psu
