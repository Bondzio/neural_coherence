I have a card bus controller so I assume I have a cardbus slot which I guess is or could be the same as pcmcia slot.
I purchased a ExpressCard sound card and inserted it into the slot but it does not reach far enough in to make the connection.
My laptop is a Dell Inspiron 8600.
I take the same card to a co-workers laptop which is a Dell Inspiron 9400 and it connects no problem.
So I obviously have the wrong slot.
Is there any inexpensive adapters I might be able to find that will make the expresscard funtion in my laptop???
?
