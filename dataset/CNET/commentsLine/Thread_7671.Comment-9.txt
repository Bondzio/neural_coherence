i can't see a difference, unless someone posts some specs, for most i don't think there is.
even, if you use vga, i'm sure if you look closely see if an audio port is present as well, many have that too, just need the typical pc audio cable.
my setup has it and i connect my laptop vga and audio to the tv.
