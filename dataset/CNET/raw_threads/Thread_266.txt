Proffitt	10/21/06 8:50 AM	1.1614206E12	Beware it's 4 or more times slower than USB 2.0	While a great idea for some LANs, the speed drop from USB 2.0 480Mbps to 100Mbps could have the owners screaming &quot;what's taking so long.&quot; Buffalo makes a few such units so take a look there.

I am wanting to get three of the devices, one of backing up to, another for mirroring that back up across town and the last one to keep junk on that I need on both my notebook and networks. USB 2 means that a computer needs to be switched on to access it and while most of the time the computer is on, sometimes people like to save the environment.
