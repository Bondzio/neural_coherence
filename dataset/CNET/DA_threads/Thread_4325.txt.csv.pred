1.1.1	Ok all you tech junkies out there , time to band together and solve this very widespread problem .	St
1.1.2	The NV4_disp loop error ! ! ! ! !	St
1.1.3	I was recently doing a sketch in Google SketchUp when the screen started to flash when i would pan through my sketch .	St
1.1.4	At first i thought it was just getting too hot ( i had been doing some serious rendering for about 5 hours ) so i decided to save and let it cool off .	St
1.1.5	I got my save in thankfully and about 3 seconds later , the nv4_disp blue screen of death hit me .	St
1.1.6	It says that the problem was proably caused by the file nv4_disp and that it was caught in an infinite loop .	St
1.1.7	From here I could do nothing but do a hard restart .	St
1.1.8	I have tried many solutions which all proved to just temporary .	St
1.1.9	I have gone to the Nvidia web site and downloaded the lastest drivers , flashed the bios to the latest version ( also previous versions ) , and tried many peoples fixes that worked for them but not for me .	St
1.1.10	I have done countless hours of googling which proved no further universal answers that worked .	St
1.1.11	I have a custom built computer with the following components : Motherboard : Gigabyte GA-MA790X-DS4 Processor : AMD Athalon X2 5400 @ 2.8 Ghz Graphics Card : EVGA GeForce 8800 GTS , SSC edition 4 GB of 1066 Mhz DDR2 RAM A 550 W Power supply Not to sound negative or anything but this is a very difficult problem so dont waste your time trying to fix this on your own .	St
1.1.12	We could all use some help .	St
1.1.13	Any suggestions are very greatly appreciated , just dont tell me to re-update my graphics drivers or bios because i 've already done those ... .twice .	Polite
1.1.14	Having trouble solving problems , TheProblemSolver	St
1.2.1	Methods that worked for me : 1 .	St
1.2.2	I got lucky and setting all the overclocking the owner did to stock fixed a few .	St
1.2.3	2 .	St
1.2.4	I drew from this post - & gt ; http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-7587_102-0.html ? forumID=69 & threadID=271360 & messageID=2699006 # 2699006 to make an OS INSTALL PLAN .	St
1.2.5	Then we did that .	St
1.2.6	3 .	St
1.2.7	Another machine , another day only did that when hot .	St
1.2.8	Fixed the hot problem .	St
1.2.9	4 .	St
1.2.10	Another machine , just a 350 Watt PSU .	St
1.2.11	Replaced the PSU with over 600 Watt model .	St
1.2.12	5 .	St
1.2.13	Another machine , had to reinstall the OS .	St
1.2.14	The OS had been damaged from too much malware .	St
1.2.15	How did I know ?	Ques
1.2.16	I slipped in a new drive and the OS then it worked .	St
1.2.17	The old drive could be swapped out and it failed .	St
1.2.18	Sadly they did n't feel like paying by the hour to find what was different from one install to the next .	St
1.2.19	6 .	St
1.2.20	And a pile of machines had outdated BIOS Firmware .	St
1.2.21	7 .	St
1.2.22	Another pile had the Memory voltage set wrong .	St
1.2.23	Today I 'm seeing more of that as those that build their own do n't check it .	St
1.2.24	Bob	St
1.3.1	A few questions about your helpfull solutions : 1- on # 3 , how do i tell if my PC is getting too hot ?	Ques
1.3.2	2- on # 4 , how do i tell if my PSU is too small ?	Ques
1.3.3	3- on # 7 , how do i know what my ram voltages should be set at ?	Ques
1.3.4	Making very nice progress , TheProblemSolver	Polite
1.4.1	Give you similar answers to mine .	St
1.4.2	Try that .	St
1.5.1	what do you mean & quot ; give you similar answers to mine ?	Ques
1.6.1	I meant & quot ; Gives & quot ; but a rewrite would be & quot ; Would find similar answers to mine. & quot ;	St
1.7.1	Ok now i sort of understand .	St
1.7.2	but still , is there a way to check my voltages on my ram and ensure that they are a-ok ?	Ques
1.8.1	I look up the specifications for the memory sticks I used .	St
1.8.2	Then I check the BIOS to see if it got it right .	St
1.8.3	Sorry but how else would we do this ?	Ques
1.8.4	I 'm always open to read how people get this done .	St
1.8.5	Bob	St
1.9.1	ok thanks a lot , i 'll go check that cant believe i could n't figure that out	Polite

1.11.1	I 've got a weird issue that I have researched to the hilt and have had no luck working out ... About a week ago I started having issues with the computer 's monitor flickering and occasionally having some image distortion .	St
1.11.2	I thought perhaps I had a monitor going out or something , but it self-resolved , or so I thought .	St
1.11.3	Then , I noticed the system was sluggish and the distortion was horrible , and the image on the monitor would completely disappear for a second or two at a time about every 30 seconds .	St
1.11.4	I restarted and had no luck .	Polite
1.11.5	On the restart , I got an BSOD error message that said nv4_disp.dll was in an & quot ; infinite loop & quot ; .	St
1.11.6	I tried a couple of the internet fix ideas , such as reinstalling drivers , updating drivers , and rolling back drivers , to no avail .	St
1.11.7	This seems to be similar to problemsolvers issue , but with one twist .	St
1.11.8	What I did find interesting is that the card and monitor work just fine in safe mode .	St
1.11.9	They are stable and steady as a rock even with the system on for hours , which leads me away from thinking it could be an overheating issue .	St
1.11.10	I also ran a test on my memory and it reported no errors .	St
1.11.11	Memory voltage is set ok .	St
1.11.12	There were no software or hardware upgrades recently .	St
1.11.13	Have you ever seen anything like this before ?	Ques
1.11.14	Thanks , Chris	St
1.12.1	well lets start with you giving your computer specs plz .	St
1.12.2	thanks , TheProblemSolver	Polite
1.13.1	Hi everyone , I had this same extremely annoying problem on a GeForce FX5200 card running under Win XP and tried fixing it by installing the latest Nvidia drivers but it just seemed to make matters much worse .	St
1.13.2	I finally fixed it by uninstalling the nvidia drivers , and then running Driver Sweep to remove ALL trace of the nvidia drivers - and then the subsequent reboot everything worked perfectly - no monitor problems whatsoever !	St
1.13.3	Checking in Hardware Manager there was a warning next to the Display Adapter representing the FX5200 and when I clicked on properties it showed that there were no drivers .	St
1.13.4	Yet everything was working fine ! !	St
1.13.5	So I decided not to bother reinstalling the nvidia drivers !	St
1.13.6	It would appear that removing the drivers , and just letting Win XP sort out the plug and play capabilities of the card and monitor is the best option to fix this issue .	St
1.13.7	( For Win XP at least ! ! ) .	St
1.13.8	Please note that I only use my PC for office type functions and do n't do any gaming - so this approach may not work if you want to use all the funcionality of your graphics card - certainly for all the basic windows stuff it works just fine without the nvidia drivers ! ! !	St
1.13.9	This problem appeared gradually - finally culminating in rapid on/off and flickering screens with distorted graphics and then the constant standby state of the monitor and on occasion BSOD 's .	St
1.13.10	If you need any more background on how this problem manifested itself on my PC then let me know .	St
1.13.11	Hope this helps everyone !	St
1.13.12	Cheers Eddie	St
