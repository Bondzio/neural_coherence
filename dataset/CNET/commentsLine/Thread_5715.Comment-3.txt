i am getting the same chkdsk error message.
my problem is that the output (the error message) was coded by micro$oft, so they know what conditions precipitate it.
for example, it may mean that the mft is hopeless corrupt or missing.
why has m$ not documented the error message of their own utility?
&gt;new users are now demanding functionality that has &gt;not been included or even thought of.
kinda bogus reply, don't ya think?
obviously the functionality demanded is to fix a corrupt volume.
and m$ has thought to include the utility for many years - it's just an issue of documenting the error output.
