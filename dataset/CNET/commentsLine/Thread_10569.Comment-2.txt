if you are truly a dual boot system, when you boot your system it will give you a choice of mandrake or other.
if this is the case and you do not want to reinstall xp and its gazillion updates.
format the drive that contains mandrake.you will still get the option screen at start up, but will now have your former linux drive available for xp.
if you presently do not get the option screen at start up.
just reformat the drive with mandrake installed.
if you are unfamiliar with formating a hard drive, click on help and check out formatting.it contains a very easy explanation of formatting and all the options.
