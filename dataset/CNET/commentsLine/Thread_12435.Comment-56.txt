i discovered spinrite back in '88 (1988) when we used mfm and rll drives (20 mb hdd) and have kept using it since on &quot;dead&quot; drives and have had great success with it.
gibson really invented a winner with this software as it has recovered several hd's that sounded like coffee grinders.
my flatmates maxtor 60 gb was so loud we could hear it seeking from the room next door (no clicking - just a coffee grinder full of pennies).
after running spinrite, the noise did not lessen by much, but it kept on working for another 8 months with no problems other than bloody loud noises.
it was still working fine when it was put into a games server (in the back room with the door shut).
personally i use seagate drives as they have a 5 year guarantee.
2 * 120's sata striped array and a 200 ata.
not a sound.
