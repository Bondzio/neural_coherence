I have a cruzer micro with a p/w using the secure access s/w. I had to disable the p/w in order to move a couple of files to the new PC. Does the s/w work with Win 8? The launch s/w is loaded onto the new PC, but I'm not sure where the secure access s/w is. Thank you.

You say, &quot;disabled&quot; if that was done, you should be able to re-enter it again or enable it in order to review what's been done. I gather that the pw was for a Win7 setup and now you're dealing with Win8. the pw created should in effect be unique and reside as separate files, so when installed on either PC, proceeds w/o too much interaction other than select or provides a menu to select. Otherwise, treat the flash drive as any other storage device. As for Cruzer s/w itself, why not check their support website for your model flash drive(there are many) and see what provide. tada -----Willy
