hi... my 2 cents worth is to get a pc w a good gamer card.
now, how do u know the intergrated card is not up to snuff?
well, check out the system requirements on most of the newer pc games out there (listed on the box) and they will recommend the minimun video card for the game.
on my old dell i have now (getting a super duper one soon), i've had to upgrade the video card twice in 6 years just to keep up with the latest.
not sure of the specs on ur possible new pc, but if u can upgrade the video card, i would most certainly do.
otherwise one way or another you will see it in the performance of the games/apps u will use.
good luck!
