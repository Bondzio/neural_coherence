I got it 2 years and 3 months ago, and its served me so well, minus a hard drive crash. I will buy this one once the lease expires, and keep it for when Im on the road. The lease expires in November and I hope to get a new system then. I want a high end system, willing to spend $3000 AUD and source a monitor (looking at an apple 24&quot; cinema display). Im a graphic designer and want a system that can also do video editing with ease. I need to be able to run photoshop, indesign, illustrator and have multiple windows open without a problem. something my current laptop is now having trouble doing... can you guys recommend a system?

The notebook recommendation given today will be useless because there will be newer components in the market by then (mobile CPU's, video adapters, motherboard chipsets, &quot;Windows Vista-ready&quot; components, etc.). Do you wish to purchase something now?

Checked out some macs today they look awesome. adding 1gig ram sounds good, know how to defrag but whats this about chaging the page file?

And if you CAN wait 'til January 07 for the new system ... you could get a dual core 64 bit CPU and Windows Vista..the MS 64 bit OS. By then there's a good chance Adobe will have a 64 bit ver of Photoshop too. And you won't need to spend $3K to get a well configured, robust, high performance system unless you go to the bleeding edge with the latest and greatest.
