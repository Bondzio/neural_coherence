<s> Hi I am currently connected to the Internet via a cable modem with NTL. </s>
<s> I want to set up a wireless network at home and have been given a Wireless Router/Modem combined in the same box. </s>
<s> Can I retain my existing cable connection via the original modem and use just the router part of the combo to set up a wireless network or do I need to buy a standalone wireless router? </s>
<s> Any help much appreciated </s>
<s> You need a stand alone router. </s>
