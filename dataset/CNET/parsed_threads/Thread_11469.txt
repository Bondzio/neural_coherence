<s> I was wondering if anyone might be able to point me to a place where I could find a slimline form factor DVD burner (preferably dual layer) that could be made region free. </s>
<s> I own DVD's from more than one region and I'd like to build a home theatre PC. </s>
<s> I am looking to put it into this case: http://www.pcalchemy.com/product_info.php/pName/silverstone-lascala-sstlc19-silver-sstlc19s/cName/htpc-cases thanks, George </s>
<s> You didn't specify a country but in the US such things can't be legally sold. </s>
<s> But there is hope and that is to use Cnet's article on how to remove the region restriction. </s>
<s> Here's the article -&gt; http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6603_7-5141963-1.html The end result will be region free. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
<s> I just checked your link, maybe I'm missing it, but I see that the article talks about how cnet tests DVD burners, I didn't happen to see anything about removing the region protection from DVD's. </s>
<s> I am in Europe and I'd like to have the ability to watch American DVD's I bought when I was over there, but I'd also like to be able to watch any DVD I might buy here in Europe, so that's basically where I'm heading with this. </s>
<s> thanks, George </s>
<s> It varies with the country. </s>
<s> I know in AUS such drives are available. </s>
<s> Sorry you missed the result of the article. </s>
<s> It's a region free copy. </s>
<s> What more do I need to add here? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm not sure I understand what you meant about missing the result of the article. </s>
<s> I pulled up the link and didn't see anything about how to make DVD burners region free. </s>
<s> Anyway, I am looking to purchase the DVD burner on the internet, so I was wondering if anyone knew of some place on line that sells region free DVD's that would fit in that case I posted earlier, or at least a DVD burner that can be made to be region free either via a firmware upgrade or some code that can be entered. </s>
<s> A region free DVD. </s>

<s> Here such things are not allowed for import so we don't see them often. </s>
<s> The website that writes about firmware upgrades is frankly something that is a good source of drive sales for my friends. </s>
<s> Given the CNet article and what happens when we use that, why would I need a region free drive? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Unless you intend to leave your DVDs made for American consumption at home in the USA, the best solution is to just buy a region-free- or all-region DVD player. </s>
<s> I brought a boatload of DVDs back from a two-year trip to China home with me. </s>
<s> I found a Panasonic player online that handles the DVDs better than my Chinese player did. </s>
<s> I hope that this helps. </s>
<s> I've seen the region free players as stand alone DVD players. </s>
<s> What I wanted to find was a slimline form factor region free DVD drive to stick it a home theater PC case (I posted a link to it earlier in the thread). </s>
<s> I guess my other choice would be to buy a case that houses two DVD drives and have one for the States and one for Europe. </s>
<s> software like http://www.softpedia.com/get/CD-DVD-Tools/CD-DVD-Rip-Other-Tools/DVD-Region-Killer.shtml </s>
