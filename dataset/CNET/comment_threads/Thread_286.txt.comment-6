recovery CD's of your own as you used a new XP install, you could try DriverMax.
Run it on the relative's computer to back up the drivers to a CD and then redo the install for your computer using the DriverMax CD to install all your drivers, after the XP install is completed.
It may be possible to use the relative's restore CD's from HP but don't count on it.
The other alternative is to buy a set of Recovery CD's from HP for your computer.
They are normally $25 - $30.
