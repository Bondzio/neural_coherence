be sure you're laptop supports that sticks and that amount of ram.
i didn't check.
so first visit  and enter the data of your laptop for advice about what it can have and what type you need.
i didn't do it for you.
of course, 8 gb only makes sense if you have a 64-bit os.
with a 32-bit os the top 4 gb won't be used at all.
i can't give advice about makers and shops.
i've bought extra memory 2 times.
the first time at our local variant of craigslist, the second time in a local computer shop.
but that's not what you're looking for, i assume.
