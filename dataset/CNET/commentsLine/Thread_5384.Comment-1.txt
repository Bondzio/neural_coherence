i have a dell dimension 8300 with a geforce fx 5200 card installed.
i am looking at getting a widescreen hdtv with a native resolution of 1386x788... will my video card support that resolution?
i haven't been able to find any info that will tell me if it will support any widescreen resolutions.
thanks
