i was going to start a thread like this, not about &quot;why&quot;, but &quot;where&quot;.
really dislike the widescreen for everything i use my computer for.
i do own a tv for movie watching, really hate the black lines on the sides of monitors with most programs/games i have and/or missing parts of my wallpapers (most of which come from my camera and fit perfectly).
where are the best sources for buying 22&quot; and up 4x3 computer monitors, or the best models?
?
