<s> Basically, could I just cut off the ends of a few of them and rewire them into the middle of one of them to make it much longer without having to go buy a bunch of double sided female connecters? </s>

<s> The &quot;technical&quot; reason is called &quot;self induction&quot;. </s>
<s> Keep the twists tight. </s>

<s> is to just toss the short cables as they are so cheap nowadays anyway. </s>
<s> Check a site such as monoprice.com and you can get 50ft for &lt;$5 or 100ft for $8. </s>
