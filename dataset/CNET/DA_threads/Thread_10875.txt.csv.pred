1.1.1	I have the choice of either a netbook for work with an intel atom processor or an old ibm x41 tablet pc with intel pentium m. I am not sure how the processors are rated .	St
1.1.2	Any one has any good ideas which will out perform the other ?	Ques
1.2.1	what sort of software will be installed and what does your work entail that affect your laptop 's requirements ?	Ques
1.2.2	Certainly there 's something to be said for new versus older but the IBM brands of that vintage had a reputation for durability and reliability where as netbooks are & quot ; throw aways & quot ; .	St
1.3.1	You must try out the netbook as the small keyboard and screen could be grounds for carpal tunnel and hunching over the machine .	Sug
1.3.2	While I like netbooks ( I own one for my demos ) I would never place one into the workplace .	St

1.4.1	As far as Atom processors are concerned , you can not run heavy softwares on it .	St
1.4.2	when i mean heavy , high graphic designing , gaming can not be done on it .	St

1.6.1	I had a Dell latitude D600 with a 1.4GHz Pentium M in it once , and that thing was amazingly fast .	St
1.6.2	It ran windows Xp like my Macbook Pro runs Mac OS X .	St
1.6.3	Boot time was something like 35 seconds , and programs responded instantly .	St
1.6.4	It was great .	Polite
1.6.5	I 'd also have to agree with the others who 've said that the Atom processor is not really meant for much heavy lifting .	St
1.6.6	I 've used other people 's Atom netbooks , and none of them run even windows XP very well , much less Windows 7 , even though they usually have more memory than my old Latitude ( netbooks generally have 1GB , whereas the latitude had 512MBs ) .	St
1.6.7	Plus , these old computers were the top of the line in their day , so they were meant to last a looooong time .	St
1.6.8	Netbooks are the cheapest of the cheap and not very well constructed .	St
