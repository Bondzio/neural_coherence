Fwiw.
I'm using a rather old video card and I suspect the OP is using something older.
When I went to the maker's site for my video card I found quite a list of newer drivers.
As I walked my way up this list and tested I found there was a peak....perf wise.
Since I was not trying to fix anything......I stopped at the peak.
Newest drivers and old hardware might not be the best match.
I agree the monitor should be PNP.
