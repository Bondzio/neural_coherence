<s> I have bought a DI-524 wireless router. </s>
<s> I followed all the instructions to configure the router's hardware and software and after several calls to D-Link, I achieved success. </s>
<s> I have my notebook connected to LAN Port 1 on the router and an old Windows 98 computer has a D-Link wireless PCI card in it. </s>
<s> It all worked. </s>
<s> Both computers could access the internet and I set up a small home network successfully. </s>
<s> When I turned my notebook on the next morning, my entire D-Link folder and contents had disappeared -- evaporated. </s>
<s> It was as though Windows xp had decided it could do a better job of running a wireless newtwork than D-Link configuration could. </s>
<s> Much to my surprise, the wireless network still works -- sort of. </s>
<s> Every 10 to 60 seconds, a balloon pops up in the system tray of my notebook telling me a network cable is unplugged, but it isn't. </s>
<s> The system instantly reconnects itself and I can carry on surfing the internet. </s>
<s> My internet phone which I use for long distance calls and my Live365 radio, both of which I have used for years without problems, disconnect each time the balloon comes up -- but these two applications will not automatically reconnect as the internet will. </s>
<s> So, I can not use my PCPhone or listen to internet radio anymore. </s>
<s> The strangest of all is that yesterday, I had a whole day of no balloons or dropped signals. </s>
<s> Everything worked perfectly. </s>
<s> I listened to the radio and made several VOIP calls. </s>
<s> The days before I had problems. </s>
<s> Today I have problems. </s>
<s> Yesterday, I had no problems. </s>
<s> I have added no software or hardware. </s>
<s> I have made no changes. </s>
<s> Can anyone offer advice? </s>
<s> I'm at my wit's end. </s>
<s> There's a recent firmware update to the 524. </s>
<s> Got it installed yet? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> No I haven't. </s>
<s> My Windows xp threw out my firmware. </s>
<s> What do you recommend? </s>
<s> Bill </s>
<s> My 524 never worked better with the latest. </s>
