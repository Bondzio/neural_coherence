Brian, You might also see huge increases in performance by upgrading your processor.
The Pentium 4 is an old processor using old architecture.
Current Core 2 Duo or Core 2 Quad processors not only consume less power but will also give you a significant performance boost.
For example, a Core 2 Quad 8300 can convert 29 Hi-res photos into a video slideshow more than 5X faster than a Pentium 4-630 (a 3.0 GHz processor.
Also, most consumer software suites out there today are optimized to take advantage of multi-core processors.
I realize that you probably cant upgrade your processor with your current MB, perhaps an investment in a new system would be worthwhile.
