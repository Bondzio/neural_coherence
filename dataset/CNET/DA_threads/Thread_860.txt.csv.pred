1.1.1	Hello, Can someone say something about AMD Athlon 64 (not FX or X2)?	St
1.1.2	Bad/good?	St
1.1.3	Is an AMD Athlon 64 3000+ enough to play new games with (with 1gb ram, 128mb rather good graph card)?	St
1.1.4	Should I buy a AMD Athlon 64 FX instead?	St
1.1.5	Why?	St
1.1.6	Is it worth it (I'm a bit short of money)?	St
1.1.7	MVH Oskar R	St
1.2.1	Are you building anew or upgrading an existing system?	St
1.3.1	How much money are you willing to spend on a new processor?	St
1.4.1	and a &quot;128mb rather good card&quot;, i dont see how it wont be able to play new games.	St
1.4.2	probably better than me setup.	St
1.4.3	512mb of ram, fx5200.	St
1.4.4	p4 no ht.	St
1.4.5	and it can play nfsmw at the very lowest settings.	St
1.4.6	but it can handle flight sim 2004, warcraft III pretty good, doom 3 at 800x600 on medium settings no aa, pretty much everything on low settings.	St
1.4.7	i would say get an amd 3800+ dual core.	St
1.4.8	not that expensive, not that cheap.	St
1.4.9	and it would be worth it.	St
1.5.1	that can justify the FX price.	St
1.5.2	There's a lot of the standard AMD 64's that are just fine for you.	St
