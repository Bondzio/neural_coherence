Look at this comparison chart first http://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu_list.php before making your decision.
I would also recommend dropping your budget in the video card cpu area and get a much better power supply, a bad power supply when it craps out will take out the other peripherals.
I'll take you another direction as well, why not buy a premade quad core and add your own power supply and video card?
Here's a pretty cheap option http://configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx?c=us&cs=19&l=en&oc=DDDADG4&s=dhs&dgc=CJ&cid=24471&lid=730577
