agp is a channel for connecting graphics cards, considered a step up from pci due to the speed.
pcie, in turn, is considered a step above agp.
older systems may only have pci slots, while newer ones will have either an agp or pci slot for a graphics card.
as to turning off the integrated graphics, it depends on your system.
some will do it automatically, some require you to go into your system bios, and some cannot be disabled.
it all depends on your computer, or more specifically, your bios and motherboard.
