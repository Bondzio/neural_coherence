1.1.1	Hello this is what I am looking for , I have a labtop computer so I need some type of combo pcmcia card for esata and maybe like usb2.0 or firewire if you could send me a link to one that would be cool .	St
1.1.2	Also someone said that I should get an esata combo with active cooling does anyone know of any good ones like that if you could send me a link to that also I would really appreciate it .	St
1.1.3	I have been trouble finding stuff with esata and have no idea about any of the manufacturers I have come across so far .	St
1.1.4	thanks for your help .	Polite
1.2.1	Even at trade shows .	St
1.2.2	As to cooling , a laptop cooling pad may be today 's answer .	St
1.2.3	And while I 've found SATA PC-Cards and USB 2.0 cards , none have & quot ; active cooling & quot ; so the only hope is the cooling pad .	St
1.2.4	The e on ESATA stands for external which is by nature of being a PC-Card will be automatic .	St
1.2.5	Therefore you just need to get a SATA card and you 're done .	St
1.2.6	To get the USB 2.0 card and SATA to fit in the 2 slots you 'll have to pay a bit more for those USB 2.0 cards built with dongles .	St
1.2.7	Sorry , I will not search for these products for you but have in the past and they are still available in the US .	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	Im sorry bob i am not the best with wording .	Polite
1.3.2	I was going to get a pcmcia card with usb2.0 and sata connection for my labtop so i could hook up a esata hard drive , the guy i talked to said to get the esata combo drive with active cooling ( i dont know what that is ) .	St
1.3.3	I can find the pcmcia card but was wondering what your take is concerning the esata drives and if you could lead me to a good manufacturer of them 200-300gb with this active cooling , is this for the hard drive or for the labtop as you suggest ?	Ques
1.4.1	& quot ; I was going to get a pcmcia card with usb2.0 & quot ; You may have written this incorrectly but there has never been a PCMCIA card with USB 2.0 .	St
1.4.2	God knows people wanted them .	St
1.4.3	You also need to know that the e in ESATA is just denoting it 's external so do n't be discouraged if you find only the usual SATA PC-Card .	St
1.4.4	I 've declined in helping you search for exact products for a simple reason .	St
1.4.5	You may be in Peru .	St
1.4.6	Besides you can look at the usual sites like google , newegg and more .	St
1.4.7	ACTIVE COOLING in an external hard disk case is ... & quot ; a fan. & quot ; Again , the fancy words with such simple meaning .	St
1.4.8	Bob	St
1.5.1	that solves all my questions thanks for being so helpful .	Polite
1.6.1	What OS are you running and does your laptop have USB 2.0 ports ?	Ques
1.7.1	i am running windows xp and my labtop still has 1.1 ports .	St
1.7.2	thats why i asked if there was a usb 2.0 and sata pcmcia card available .	St
1.7.3	i just found this http : //www.pcconnection.com/ProductDetail ? sku=6809388 & srccode=cii_5784816 & cpncode=10-24485416-2 and i think this might be what i will go with .	St
1.8.1	Under constant use the cases without fans have shown a tendency to overheat .	St
1.8.2	NCQ is not exclusive to this make so I 'd take the marketing geewhiz words with a grain of salt .	St
1.8.3	- & gt ; It fails at first glance to meet your spec .	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
1.9.1	that indicated active cooling not to mention the cost ... YIKES .	St
1.9.2	If it was mine , I 'd try to find a PCMCIA Card that gives you USB 2.0 and buy that .	St
1.9.3	Generally speaking external HDDs are really quite inexpensive ... see Techbargains.com for weekly ads .	St
1.9.4	You can also 'build your own ... you pick the external enclosure and the drive and put them together yourself .	St
1.9.5	Let us know if you find the PCMCIA USB card ... USB 2.0 is plenty fast for most HDDs .	St
1.9.6	VAPCMD	St
1.10.1	compatible with USB 1.1 .	St
1.10.2	Good buer reviews too .	St
1.10.3	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16815104803 This would give you the hardware interface to use any USB device including you choice of USB external HDDs , external CD/DVDs , Flash drives etc. , You can buy prebuilt or put together your own depending on need preference and budget .	Ques
1.10.4	If you buy prebuilt ... I 'd avoid Maxtor as post for failures 'seems ' higher than most .	St
1.10.5	Let us know .	St
1.10.6	VAPCMD	St
1.11.1	hello bob , i know it does not meet what i was looking for in the specs but i wonder what you mean by ncq is not exclusive to this make also thanks for letting me know about the overheating thats probably why i was told to get one with a fan , it was just something i was looking at and posted a link to see what response i might get about the possible choice .	St
1.11.2	@ vapcmd thanks for the help but i didnt have trouble finding the usb 2.0 solutions just stuff concerning the sata drives .	Polite
1.11.3	thanks again bob and vapcmd .	Polite
1.12.1	But a good ad writer will grab anything to make their product sound better .	St
1.12.2	Bob	St
1.13.1	way less than $ 280 ... and if you build your own vs buying prebuilt ... you can get a much better drive warranty ... most are 3 to 5 years .	St
1.13.2	Packaged units only come with 1 year warrantys .	St
1.13.3	VAPCMD	St
1.14.1	After bob pointing out about the overheating and you pointing out about the price and warranty that I could gain by just builing one I will start my search in that direction , thanks .	St
