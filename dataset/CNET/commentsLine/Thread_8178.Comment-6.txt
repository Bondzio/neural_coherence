dear moderator: i don't know a lot about computers but i have found that when i go on to this website, more often than not, i can find fixes for my computer problems here.
i'm sorry if i misunderstood what you wanted me to download but when i went back and reviewed it, i noted that you said &quot;firmware&quot;.
i went back to the link you provided and choose firmware and i am getting a box that is cautioning me about downloading the firmware.
should i just go ahead and do it?
