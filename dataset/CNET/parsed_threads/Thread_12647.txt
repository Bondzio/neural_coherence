<s> ! </s>
<s> I am in the same market, but my own experience can tell you one thing. </s>
<s> *** DO NOT BUY LEXMARK PRINTERS ***. </s>
<s> The color quality is sub-par at best, the inkjet cartridges are tiny (300 prints max per cartridge) and most printouts have a faded appearance, no matter how hard you &quot;tweak&quot; the printer settings. </s>
<s> That's why they literally THROW these printers at your when you buy PC's from any BigBox store. </s>
<s> So, anyone else got advice?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> If you are looking for a AIO that is great on photo printing and scanning, I would look at the Canon Pixma MP960 or the MP970. </s>
<s> Both are 7 cartridge printers that are made for photo printing and scanning. </s>
<s> I would go into details but cnet did a good job of reviewing them. </s>
