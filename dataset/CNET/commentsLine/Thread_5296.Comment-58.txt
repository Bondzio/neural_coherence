i bought a new computer last year and it came with integrated graphics.
the newer games are not playable with integrated graphics.
though you will be suprised what games it will play with graphics settings set to low.
like crysis, grid and batman arkham asylum.
i know people knock the integratged graphics down.
they do have less graphics power.
but on a budget they can get you by.
i probaly will be sticking with mine for another year.
i also had a computer before with a amd 4000+ and 7800 gtx nvidia graphics card.
this system runs almost all those game just with lower settings.
their are also games that a company is going to make for just integrated graphics cards.
the recent game torchlight is a good example of this.
