11203	0	245280	2472746	NR	anasimtiaz	4/29/07 12:01 AM	1.17780486E12	Display Problem (Freeze/Crash/etc.)	im running an intel 2.8Ghz processor, the board is intel D865gbf. when i start my computer, everything is normal but usually (and more oftenly now) the display suddenly turns something weird, a combination of lines and blocks and everything is stalled. this can happen before or after the loading of windows (no fixed time). and when i restart the pc, normality is restored for sometime but then again this problem can erupt any time. to give an idea of the sort of display problem ive taken a snapshot of the monitor screen, which can be found at http://www.geocities.com/anasimtiaz/problem.jpg note that im running win xp (sp2) and i hv two memory (RAM) sticks for quite some time now i am not sure where the problem lies! but its really annoying...it could be the display, ram, or anything..itssurely not the monitor!

I don't see how many sticks of RAM but if there are 2 I try it with one then the other (only one at a time.) The Linux LiveCD is a good test to see if it's a hardware or software (OS) issue. Type LINUX LIVECD into google.com to catch up on what that is. They are free. Bob

Minor things that could shed light as fans and heatsinks all in their place and running. Also is this some newly built machine or ??? For now, leave the case cover off and see if that helps. Also check those fans and make sure all the heatsinks are on proper and the fans working. One plea for help found they didn't have a CPU heatsink and fan. It was one of those build yourself things and they didn't know. I don't know what you know about this machine. Bob

Proffitt	4/29/07 5:27 AM	1.17782442E12	&quot;how can i know if its proper?&quot;	You can research and read web sites about &quot;How to build a PC.&quot; I don't duplicate such content but leave it to members to look for ready web content. Why? These are self help areas and not tech support. However it helps to bounce ideas off each other. How did the test with just one stick go? And how are you doing with your Linux LiveCD tests? Bob
