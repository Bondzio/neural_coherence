I have just defragmented my hard disk and the time to open up word07 is now 6 secs so thanks that helped a lot!!
Furthermore- I now am wanting to get a Core 2 Duo for playing games at higher settings and resolutions the most.
What are the other jobs of a processor besides playing games better?
Do they help in using iTunes by any chance?
( As I am a iTouch user )
