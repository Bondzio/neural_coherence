i did contact verizon to help me resolve my networking issue but they stated that they do not support networking with there product and that i shoud purchase another usb modem and pay for 2 years $60 a month.
i thought that windows ics and with a lan crossover cable could do the job since machine#1 at like the dhcp server and not require a router, switch, or hub.
since i'm only connecting 2 machines.
as last resort i could buy a router and cross my finger it will fix my problem.
