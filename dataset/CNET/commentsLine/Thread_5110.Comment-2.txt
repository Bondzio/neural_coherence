i am no pro by a long shot.
but i think it would just be the sensible thing to do to shut down during the night.
i run mine all day partly because i use system mechanic for many things and it runs in the background or when i am away from the pc...it checks the registry, drivers etc.etc.
and i seldom have problems.
also i don't open a lot of different programs at once only what i need for whatever i am working on at the time.
norma v!
