Last week the ext. started losing connection to my PC and eventually dropped out completely at the weekend. I've tried updating the drivers, a different USB port and a different USB cable and had no luck. Today I dismantled the ext. case and connected the HDD unit with a SATA cable. When I turn on the PC and go into setup the PC lists SATA 1 IDE WD160 bladdy blah (the internal Vista runs on), SATA 3 IDE WD500 etc. (the ex-external)and SATA 2 which is the DVD-ROM and has nothing to do with anything really. But if I skip the setup stage I get the message 'Primary slave hard disk error'. I know that the old IDE drives could be set as master and slave by changing the jumpers and SATA drives don't have this. But I can't get the second drive to work and really need help. What am I doing wrong?

If you did this please forgive me for asking. Question: when you start your PC with it connected does it spinup (can you hear it or feel it? If it does then go to start, All Programs, Administrative Tools,Computer Managment, & select Disk Management. Does your drive apear here? If not the drive is more than likely dead. You can take it to a repair shop, and get their opinion. So time it can be repaired. I use a program called Spinrite. It takes along time but it recovers drives and data that other techs say are dead drives. Hope this helps...
