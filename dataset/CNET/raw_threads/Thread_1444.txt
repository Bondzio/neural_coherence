I will be using this desktop for some gaming, editing and basic processes. I plan on buying a high resolution 27+ inch monitor later on so a good graphics card that can handle high resolutions is a must. I do not want to build my own pc, because at the moment i do not feel confident in my well, abilities. Heres what i customized on HP i'll put my questions about each part in parentheses. HP elite HPE-480t Intel Core I-7 930 8 GB 1033 Ram Primary HD- 80gb Solid State Drive ( I've heard that formatting this type of drive in Raid 0 format makes it very fast but makes transfer rates lower. I only plan on putting windows 7 and a few other speed oriented files on here though. How do i put this drive in raid 0? what is raid 0? i have no idea please help here haha ) Secondary Drive- 500GB 7200 rpm HDD Graphics card- Nvidia GeForce GTX 460 ( I plan on installing a 2nd GTX 460 later on for the SLI hookup. Is this easy to do? will i have to install a new power supply to the PC? if so which PSU's are good? Is SLI worth it? I want to have a 3 monitor set up and if there is a better combination of others cards feel free to advise ) Sound card- Integrated Sound ( dont know if its worth the extra money for the sound blaster card ) Networking - Wireless N lan card ( should i get bluetooth with it? i want a bluetooth headset but don't they come with a USB bluetooth plugin? ) I researched the motherboard and its a X58 chipset with 2 X16 pcie 2.0 slots i believe, so i shouldn't have to worry about SLI / Eyefinity compatibility. Any other suggestions that i overlooked or didnt ask about that beginners should know would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

I've held back long enough for HP to correct their stance on an in warranty issue on a laptop but the last talk ended with &quot;that's not supported.&quot; It was a simple issue that my HP laptop would not boot when a Spring HTC EVO 4G phone was plugged in. While I know why it does me no good as only HP can issue a fixed BIOS. Instead the choice was to tell me it was not supported. Since HP can't warrant or support their machines, it's time to move on to those that will. Bob
