1.3.1	Hello , Every Mac with a Mini DisplayPort allows you to connect an external display or projector using an adapter .	St
1.3.2	You can use an external display as your main workspace or to extend your desktop , or you can work in mirrored mode with a projector so you can view what your audience sees .	St
1.3.3	Use the Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter to connect an advanced digital monitor , such as the 20- or 23-inch Apple Cinema Display , that includes a DVI connector .	St
1.3.4	Review the documentation or check with the manufacturer of your monitor to make sure you 're choosing the right adapter .	St
1.3.5	The new CinemaView displays will be available in 19 , 20.1 and 24-inch sizes , with display resolutions of 1440 x 900 pixels , 1680 x 1050 and 1920 x 1080 respectively .	St
