I bought my daughter a game for it called zoo tycoon- the ultimate. It installs alright, but then claims I need a graphics card. It's not 3-D or anything fancy. What kind of card do I need? The ones at Best Buy are $100 and up. Can I get something cheaper? Also, how do I install it? Any help is so appreciated!!

This is what it says about the graphic card for the Ultimate collection: &quot;32 MB graphics card with Hardware Transform & Lighting (plus support for DirectX 9.0 or later, included on game CD)&quot;. So that's what you need minimally: &quot;32 MB graphics card with Hardware Transform & Lighting plus support for DirectX 9.0. I suppose someone will come buy with a recommendation for you. I'm not exactly a specialist on this area. If nobody comes, visit a few hardware shops and ask them. Any shop will be happy to install it for you, if you pay them the fee for it. Kees
