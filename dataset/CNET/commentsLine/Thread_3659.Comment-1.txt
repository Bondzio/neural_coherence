what factors affect compatibility of crt monitors with cpus by various manufacturers?
for instance, can a dell cpu be used with an hp monitor without any serious considerations?
of course, they would be both be recent models using the windows xp home os.
after recurring dell monitor problems that have never been resolved, it seems necessary to consider another option.
thanks for any help.
