O yes, generally a wired connection works by just plugging in.
If that doesn't work it's most likely a driver problem.
Given what you did, that could be motherboard drivers.
Didn't there come something like a &quot;driver and utilities CD&quot; with the laptop?
I'm afraid your on your own with regard to selecting the right drivers from the manufacturers site.
I once managed it for a Lenovo T30 rather satisfactorily, because everything seems to work except the 'help'-key.
