<s> I just replaced my motherboard. </s>
<s> Now my CPU is shown as a single core 1.8 GHZ processor instead of dual core 1.8 (Task manager, system) Also, the tab for &quot;processor&quot; disappeared in device manager. </s>
<s> Maybe it's a driver for the motherboard? </s>
<s> I already installed everything and updated a few audio drivers, etc. </s>
<s> And the box clearly reads: Supports Intel Core 2 Duo and Quad. </s>
<s> Windows XP Professional P5G41-M LX2/GB Intel Core 2 Duo E4300 1.8GHZ (If you guys want graphics card or other info, ill provide that too) </s>
<s> Also, the P5G41-M LX2/GB is an ASUS motherboard. </s>
<s> Is power supply also an issue? </s>
