Don't look for DX10 capable games to under XP, unless they provide a solution with their s/w bundle(not likely). But heck, it still early since Vista was released and all the issues it imposes. tada -----Willy

I was planning on upgrading my video card to DX 10 to play &quot;World in Conflict&quot; thats coming out in September. No way I'm gonna fork over the cash for a new OS, DX 10 card, power supply, and probably a cooling unit to boot. There's still a lot of DX 9 games out there to keep me satisfied for awhile.
