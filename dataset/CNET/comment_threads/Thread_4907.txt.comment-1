Hi I just ordered a new computer, and was curious if I would be able to add my old video card to the system and have both cards work together.
I have found a fair amount of conflicting information about it and am not clever enough to know of my own intuition.
The new system comes with a NVIDIA GeForce 9800 GT over-clocked video card that I believe fits into a PCI-E x16 slot.
The older card is a PNY XLR8 GeForce 8800 GT 512MB, and made for just a normal PCI-E slot.
Is it possible to make these two work together, or am I wasting my time on a foolish pursuit?
