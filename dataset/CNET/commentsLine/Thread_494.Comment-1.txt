i booted nad used my pc this morning with no problems what so ever.
i had to leave and shut it down the way i always do, properly.
when i attempt to reboot now i enter my password, my desktop background image appears and then it immediately says &quot;saving settings&quot; and returns to my password screen.
i have atempted to reboot in safe mode &quot;last known good starting point&quot;, regular safemode and i get the same thing.
pc will not complete boot process or let me go any farther to diagnose problem.
i am running a: sony vaio pcv-rx650 winxp_sp2 nvidia tnt 2 64/pro gpu with 32mb's of on board ram 512mb's of system ram 80gb hd with 68 gb free space.
just wondering if anyone could help me out with this dilemna?
would greatly appreciate it!
thanks.
