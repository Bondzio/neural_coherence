<s> I have a HP dv6000 laptop. </s>
<s> It is almost 2 years old. </s>
<s> Since yesterday, the display has not been working. </s>
<s> Whenever I switch on the laptop, i can only see 'static', sort of like the image old tv's would show when the signal was lost. </s>
<s> I can hear the hard drive starting up, but there is nothing on the display...what should i do? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> Many of the DV6000's are subject to a known failure and recall. </s>
<s> Try this link. </s>

<s> The fix is to put in a new main board. </s>
<s> I know people often want it to be a reset or reload of the OS but not this time. </s>

<s> Thanks, I will try that </s>
