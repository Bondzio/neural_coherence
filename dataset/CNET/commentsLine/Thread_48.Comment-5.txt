if i was a gamer i'd get some i7 2+ghz based machine and then go as high on the list as i could from  then i'd get a nice display, keyboard and mouse and call it quits.
the recipe is very simple and i've found gamers that get caught up in some amd love fight but let's let them do that.
i want a little more stability.
