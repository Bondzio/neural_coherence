we may have got the wrong audio card.
there are no less than three audigy's.
ok, the motherboard supplies the clocks for the audio playback so if that didn't help we are still looking at the usual cause.
-&gt; another fine mess in audio loss after the driver are the volume settings and the speaker settings.
did you check those after the driver install?
