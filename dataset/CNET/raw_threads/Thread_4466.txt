My new apt is a bit smaller and I need the room on my desk I cant have my monitors taking up all the room. Currently I'm using two Dell P991 monitors that have served me well for along time. I do a lot of video work, premiere, avid, after effects etc.... so let the suggestions start pouring in please. I would like to stick with two 19&quot; monitors what do you guys recommend?

Note that there is only one brand that guarantees no dead or stuck pixels, however never heard of that brand before. http://www.newegg.com/ProductSort/SubCategory.asp?SubCategory=20

I guess that a monitor mfr could have some paid friends post. I do not know whether newegg screens to insure that ratings are only made by actual buyers.
