heatsink/fan mounting is standardized for socket 478 and that's a mid-tower case so height shouldn't be an issue.
i wouldn't recommend using the original cooler since this cpu runs more than 1ghz higher (and hotter) than your original cpu.
the latest bios for that system is from june 2002, 2 full years prior to the release of the celeron 335. the dimension's bios may not know how to deal with that cpu.
