1.)
Four PC home LAN, full file and printer sharing.
2.)
D-link Gigabit router.
3.)
External USB-2 80 Gig HD connected to one PC.
4.)
Set external drive to sharing, works fine for backing up &quot;stuff&quot; from other PCs.
5.)
Power off either the USB drive or the PC it's connected to and sharing goes away.
Have to reenable sharing again.
Normal?
Any way for the external drive to remember it's shared?
