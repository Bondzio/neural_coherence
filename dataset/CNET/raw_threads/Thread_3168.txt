So yes, I realize some of these dated CPU's are overpriced relative to more powerful options. I am however, limited by my motherboard. Here is the situation. My motherboard: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00906129&lc=en&cc=de&dlc=en&product=3424294%E2%8C%A9=en My current CPU: http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103776 The Options: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103645 I realize this is above 5600+. However, TDP is still 89w. Is it safe to say this would be compatible? http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103771 Though this is an older core and has TDP of 89w rather than the 65w of its Brisbane equivalent, it boasts double the L2 cache. This is for a PC that is heavily used for gaming, and 3-D graphics software (decreasing rendering times is a huge thing). What do you recommend?

That is your common X2 at 2.2GHz is 10% faster thatn the 2.0. All that's left for you to do is get the motherboard maker to say the CPU is supported. Bob

So I thought the 89w 6000 would be compatible. Is this inaccurate? Also there is a 65w version of this http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103234 . I'd have to purchase from somewhere else but they seem identical with the exception of the TDP. Wouldn't I want lower TDP? I'm still wondering if the bigger Windsor cache will yield the most performance. Can anybody help me with this?

Only in benchmarks is where you'll see it and at the same clock rate with more cache the effect is usually below 2%. Why 2% is important is that humans can't tell the difference until about 2%. So take time to find Tom's Hardware CPU benchmarks but after all is said and done I like to see in the nearly same CPU line more GHz and same Watts when changing the CPU out. Bob

CPU-MB compatibility is BIOS driven so while it may have socket compatibility, you could have problems ranging from not working at all to working but not reflecting the right CPU specs. If there two processor that appear to match the spec, I'd contact the system mfg to make sure which is correct for your system. Good luck and let us know how it works. VAPCMD
