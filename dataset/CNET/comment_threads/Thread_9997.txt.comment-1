I am currently using a laptop with integrated NVIDIA GeForce 7000M / nForce 610M, adapter RAM 64.00 MB.
How can I upgrade the graphics?
or can I change the graphic card?
I came across this NVIDIA Forceware 182.50 WHQL Vista.
It is said to improve graphics.
Does this actually work?
What other ways can I improve my graphics?
