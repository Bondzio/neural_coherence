thank you for all of your information.
my psu is corsair hx520w i think it is not very old.
this computer is my first built and now it is my secondary computer.
i will try with another psu and i will try to find out about bad caps.
once it started i can use as long as i like and there is no problems of reboot too.
regards wildbird
