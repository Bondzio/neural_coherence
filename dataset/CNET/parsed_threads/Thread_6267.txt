<s> I'm wanting to add 1GB in addition to my current 512MB ram in my desktop...but my computer only has 2 slots for ram and both are filled with 256MB DIMMS. </s>
<s> Is there something &quot;out there&quot; that can combine both DIMMS into one DIMM slot so that I can add the additional 1GB I want into the other DIMM slot? </s>
<s> By the way, my memory is the PC2100 kind. </s>
<s> or a single GB DIMM these should do fine: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820145024 given that board you'll need either a single GB DIMM (they exist) and one of those 512MB DIMMs, or to get 2 1GB DIMM's and have 2GB i'd just suggest getting two 512MB DIMM's </s>
<s> Will your mother board/BIOS/OS support 1 Gig of RAM? </s>
<s> Your RAM speed tells me that the machine is an older model. </s>
<s> If your setup will support it, then it's purchase time. </s>
<s> A 1 Gig stick and a 512 stick. </s>
<s> But I've also found that anything over a Gig is major overkill. </s>
