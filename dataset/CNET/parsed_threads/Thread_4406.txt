<s> Hey all- I was wondering what i need for these situations: - My Laptop on the Go - what tech do i need to have a reliable internet connection most of the time ($100-250 dollar range). </s>
<s> -Could I replace my cable with a router or something? </s>
<s> I have 2 desktop and 3 laptops. </s>
<s> But I heard routers are unreliable; would making the switch be the right and cheap choice? </s>
<s> as one in the laptop forum. </s>
<s> But, there are enough differences in the text to make it unclear as to your goal. </s>
<s> You mention being &quot;on the go&quot; but having laptops and desktops. </s>
<s> As well, you ask about replacing your cable with a router. </s>
<s> These are not interchangeable items. </s>
<s> Each does something completely different. </s>
<s> You might ask that your posts be removed and put together a new one that defines more specifically what you want to do and what problems you are having. </s>
<s> When I say &quot;laptop on the go&quot; I mean that I want to know what I can do to have wireless internet access on my high school campus. </s>
<s> Is placing a router in my locker feasible? </s>
<s> That sorta thing. </s>
<s> By &quot;replacing&quot; a cable modem with a wireless router, I meant that could I use a wireless router or some similar device to power reliable internet access in my home for both laptops and desktops instead of using a cable modem which i pay expensive monthly fees for. </s>
<s> That's pretty much it. </s>
<s> Simple too. </s>
<s> A router doesn't give you internet access. </s>
<s> It's a piece of hardware that needs to be connected to another piece...generally a broadband modem. </s>
<s> The modem connects to an internet service provider...generally by phone line or coax cable depending on whether it's cable or DSL. </s>
<s> Of course fiber optic is growing as well. </s>
<s> You can't put any piece of hardware in your school that will originate an internet connection. </s>
<s> Does your school not have a network with internet access already? </s>
<s> It's the same deal at your home. </s>
<s> You cannot toss out the cable modem and use a router. </s>
<s> In fact, you will want both. </s>
<s> The router cannot reach out and grab an internet connection. </s>
<s> It needs to connect to a modem. </s>
<s> &quot;Modem&quot; means &quot; MO ulator- DEM odulator. </s>
<s> It converts the incoming and outgoing signals to the ISP from and to a modulated signal that can carry the long distances that a purely digital signal cannot. </s>
<s> This means it's on a high frequency &quot;carrier&quot;...going for a ride. </s>
<s> The carrier is added at one end and removed at the other. </s>
<s> Your router cannot handle the signal that enters your house. </s>
<s> I hope this is clear. </s>
