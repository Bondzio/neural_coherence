i've got a fairly new dell xps 8000 (i7-860 tri-channel 8gb ram 1tb hd 2.8ghz nvidia gts 240) running windows 7 ultimate 64bit.
i just got a new lacie d2 quadra 1tb drive.
it works fine with usb and i formatted it while connected to usb.
but with the esata cable that came with it, the computer does not see it in disk management or my computer.
i'm not sure what to look for in device manager.
under devmgr.diskdrives there is just the one ata device which must be the internal one.
doing research, i see many similar problems where the solution was the bios needed to have the detection enabled.
(seems silly, why wouldn't it come that way???)
but in any case, my bios had no such setting switch, unless i missed it, but i looked at every menu.
one configuration page showed as &quot;esata not-detected&quot;, but there was nothing there to be modified.
what else can i check or do?
(keep it simple, non-techie) i hate calling mfr support, so hoping you experts can spare me that grief.
