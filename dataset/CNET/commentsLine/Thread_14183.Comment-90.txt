first personal computer was in 1984. it was an epson qx10 with dual floppy drives (5.25) and 256k of memory.
it was quite high-end at the time.
it ran cp/m and an integrated office suite called &quot;valdocs&quot; for valuable documents.
it got me through law school and made all the difference in the world.
no hiring a typist.
i could do revisions up to the last minute.
it got me hooked.
i used it all the way until 1990, when i bought my first mac.
