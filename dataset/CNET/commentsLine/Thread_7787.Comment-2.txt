thats kinda odd, if i look at my own pc.
the only time when the cpu usage goed higher is when i compress files, encode video, goes close to 100% when i do some of these cpu hungry tasks at the same time, it might be that your pc is paging to much to the hard drive meaning that u have to many apps open at the same time or to much files (garbage like temp, cache and page files on your hard drive ) how large are your partitions, try slitting your primary hard drive 20 gig and 60 gig, and load windows and the necessary apps to the 20 gig, all the other larger files including video files etc.
and games on the 60 gig, you can also use the 200 gig and do the same but not everything on one hard drive(but this must be the last resort ) i still think there is some application or even external hardware that might use your cpu to function properly or keep up with something else.
i know some older and cheap internal sound cards and modems used to abuse the cpu because they lack their own proseccing power.
