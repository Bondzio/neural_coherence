<s> Hi, before I start asking questions, here is what I am currently working with: -------------------------------- 800 MHz PowerPC G4 (Powermac4,5) ---- no Airport or any wireless hardware installed OS: 10.4.5 -------------------------------- However, to make things more complicated, within the next month or so I will also be running a Lenovo Thinkpad laptop (not exactly sure which model). </s>
<s> My problem is, I find it almost necessary to upgrade from my current Comcast Cable internet to Wi-Fi. </s>
<s> In the fall I will be going away to college and I'll be going back and forth between campus (which has Wi-Fi) and my house. </s>
<s> I will be doing all of my work on my laptop since my PowerMac will be staying home with my family while I live on campus, so I need a convenient way to also work online here at home on my laptop. </s>
<s> But, I am completely clueless on how to. </s>
<s> I've read the forums and seen a lot of talk about Airport. </s>
<s> Do I NEED to buy this? </s>
<s> Can't I just be like everyone else (*cough*windowsusers*cough*) and go to Best Buy and buy a wireless router? </s>
<s> (Such as http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=7061751&type=product&productCategoryId=pcmcat25300050001&id=1108125361676 ) My point is, I want to make this as easy as possible while still maintaining a decent connection between both computers. </s>
<s> I could probably just unhook my Mac from the cable modem and connect my laptop to it, but I don't feel like doing that everyday, I don't want to have to go through Comcast tech support and software installation, and I don't want to be stuck in my home office with no work space. </s>
<s> Sorry if I confused anyone, but I really need help before I go out and purchase anything. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be appreciated P.S. </s>
<s> : Whatever the solution may be, I need to be able to access the internet from at least 1 story above where I am now </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> I am a bit confused of what do you really want to do with your network. </s>
<s> But if I understood it correctly you have a Mac laptop and you are also planning to buy a Lenovo. </s>
<s> There are wireless cards that both are compatible with a MAC computer and a computer running through Windows better look for those device. </s>
<s> I bet Linksys have one, and it have drives for both mac and windows. </s>
<s> 802.11G is a standard. </s>
<s> IP is also a standard. </s>
<s> As long as the MAC and the thinkpad both support IP and 802.11G you should have no problems. </s>
<s> SKrall </s>
<s> Yes If what we assume is correct and all you want to do is access you modem from either the PC (MAC) or new Laptop...go buy a router...anything should work since 802.11 G is the standard. </s>
<s> Do you have to buy an Access Point for the MAC or is it wireless enable. </s>
