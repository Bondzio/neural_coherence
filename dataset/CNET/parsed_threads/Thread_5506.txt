<s> I am considering of upgrading my sound card from an on board Realtek 7.1 HD Audio to the Creative Audigy SE. </s>
<s> I know there is no argument that a dedicated SC is better than a basic on board however with the set up I have, will there be a noticeable difference on games, music and movies if I upgraded to the Audigy SE? </s>
<s> &lt;br&gt; My current system specs are: &lt;br&gt; Win Vista, Intel Q6600 processor, 4 gb ram, nVidia 8800 GTS Logitech Z-5300e 5.1 speaker system. </s>
<s> Any input would be much appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> you'll get higher eax support and slightly better framerates with the audigy se, and probably better signal-to-noise ratio. </s>
<s> i know there was a very noticeable difference in audio quality between intel hd audio and my audigy 4. </s>
