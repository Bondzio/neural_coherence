Swapping out the problem hard drive with a good drive corrects the problem. Then, to trouble shoot, I set the jumpers on the bad unit to the slave position and tried to boot with my spare hard drive again as the C drive. When the boot process got to &quot;verifying DMI pool,&quot;, the computer reported... NTLDR is missing Press Ctrl-Alt-Del to restart When I did that, the computer then &quot;hung&quot; on recognizing the good hard drive as well. So, my question is &quot;What is NTLDR and should I just garbage can this drive?&quot; I would at least like to be able to read this drive one last time as I have a couple of files that I didn't backup.
