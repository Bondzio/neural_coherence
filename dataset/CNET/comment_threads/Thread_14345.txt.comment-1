Canon MP800/950 - seems to offer excellent quality but no ADF, fax MP780 - excellent set of features but outdated HP 7210/7310/7410 - inks are too expensive Others - so-so quality Will there be an updated version of the canon mp780: a business-like multifunction with photo quality prints?
I really want ADF, if only the MP800/MP950 has that feature, or an add-on that can fix that.
I already have a Canon ip4000 and since the MP780 is built around that printer, it doesn't actually qualify as an upgrade.
