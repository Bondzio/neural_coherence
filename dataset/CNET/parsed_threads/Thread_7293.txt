<s> Hi there. </s>
<s> At work we have 2 desktops running windows NT not the fastest machines in the world but they are being replaced shortly. </s>
<s> Anyways the problem is we cannot get an lcd to work on either of them. </s>
<s> They both have matrox dual head display graphics cards and work perfectly with crt monitors. </s>
<s> When you connect a flat screen to them there is no signal at all. </s>
<s> Is there a setting in bios that needs to be changed or is it cos the systems are so old? </s>
<s> To be honest i'd rather not touch the bios and settings like that cos like i say they are work pc's and if i bugger it up i'll have me nuts chewed off. </s>
<s> Just thought this was a bit weird as i have never seen this problem before in all my years of computing ? </s>
<s> cheers </s>
<s> LCDs won't work with those graphics cards. </s>
<s> Check with the manufacturer of the cards since you didn't give us full specs. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> Did you read anywhere in the manual that came with the monitors about setting them up to use a VGA signal? </s>
<s> Are you using an adapter to go from the DVI connector to a VGA connector? </s>
<s> Have you adjusted the properties in the video card to a resolution and refresh rate that the LCD monitor will support prior to hooking it up? </s>
<s> A little more info might be helpful as I'm just suggesting general ideas. </s>
