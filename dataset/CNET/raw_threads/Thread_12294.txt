I have to do it manually, or not be able to use the keypad(numbers,+/*,etc) on the right hand side of the keyboard. While trivial, it is irritating. I have found no way to change this short of re-installing the OS. It is a standard 101/102 PS/2 keyboard. Is this a sign of a dying keyboard? Doesn't seem likely. While a dual-boot Win 98se/Mandrake 10 system, haven't been in Linux lately to see if it is doing it there. Any ideas? chuck

Some systems just don't leave it on all the time, even if the BIOS and windows are both correctly configured to leave it on. Check out this article for settings Windows to leave it on, but I have found it to be enabled and Numlock still would not stay on until pressed, so it may not help. http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;315468

Actually, I was just wondering about that. Will double-check that and go through the Microsoft info Jeff supplied. chuck
