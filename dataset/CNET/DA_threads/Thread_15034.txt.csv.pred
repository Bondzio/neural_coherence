1.1.1	ive just put in my mce cd and theres a message that appears saying NTLDR is missing , i have no idea what that is .	St
1.1.2	can anyone help ?	Ques
1.1.3	thanks in advance	Polite
1.2.1	Type the error mesage with the NTLDR word into google.com While you supplied one word of the error message , without details no do this other than for you to use google.com is likely to help .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	thank you	Polite
1.4.1	... across virually all windows platforms , that says the computer failed to find the operating system !	St
1.4.2	It does that by looking for a few vital but hidden system files on the hard drive ... .if it ca n't find these , you get the & quot ; NTLDR not found & quot ; ( NT LoaDeR ) error .	St
1.4.3	If you 've just installed the Operating System from CD , without any problems , it 's a good indicator that you 'll likely have to enter your computer BIOS , and set boot & quot ; Hard Drive # 1 & quot ; first .	St
1.4.4	It 's likely set to & quot ; Boot From CD & quot ; at the moment , which dending on hardware can stop the system booting from Hard Drive , even if that is listed as another boot option .	St
1.4.5	Good luck , GeeBee .	Polite
