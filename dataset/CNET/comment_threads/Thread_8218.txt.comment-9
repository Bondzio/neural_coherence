When I'm looking at such a system I take a quick peek under the main board.
Since I can't blow up hardware that isn't mine we always pull the main board to be sure there is not that common issue.
If you are absolutely sure about the pin connections, UNPLUG the HDD LED and RESET cables from same connections.
Also, be sure the little paper insulator is removed from the CMOS battery holder plus see if the CMOS CLEAR jumper is on/off or &quot;proper&quot; for normal operation.
Still dead.
Pull the motherboard out of the case and build the bare minimum parts on cardboard.
If it doesn't beep or light up, you are looking at the bad part or parts.
