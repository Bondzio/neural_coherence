here's a breakdown.
keeping: maxtor 120 gb hdd samsung 1 tb hdd wd 500 gb external hd 4x 512 mb ram sticks (might upgrade to 4x 1 gb ram sticks) nvidia 6800 gt 256 mb soundblaster audigy 2 gamer case (its light aluminum, with swinging side doors for easy access) need: new motherboard new processor (thinking pentium quadcore) gonna buy a blu-ray drive and dvd-rw drive i never attempted anything like this, what are the potential problems i will run into?
software, installation etc.
also, i'm not that familiar with mobos, whats a good high end product?
thanks.
