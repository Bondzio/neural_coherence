hi.
i just recently reformatted my computer to unpartition some of my drives.
after reinstalling windows 2000 pro and downloading the latest patches i'm having difficulty getting my seagate barracuda st380023as serial ata drive to show up in the disk manager or anything else in windows.
i currently have a wdc wd300bb-00ccb0 hard drive set up as my primary master and the sata drive as the primary slave.
i've checked the seagate website for support, however their troubleshooting guide seems lacking the info i need to fix the problem.
they did mention something about my needing to install a sata host adapter driver, but did not have any info on any of the names or where i could find one of these drivers.
i had a friend help me to set up the sata drive the first time around, and he's currently out of reach for tech support at the present... anything that might be helpful to my situation would be greatly appreciated.
thanks.
