<s> I am having a problem with one of my first computer builds. </s>
<s> It is all old parts; I am building outside the case to test the main components: the cpu (w/ heatsink & fan), the memory, the graphics card, and the power supply. </s>
<s> When I short the two pins to power up the computer, the cpu fan runs fine; however, my video card (PCIe) does not work. </s>
<s> I have tried multiple video cards too, so I believe this is not the problem of the video card. </s>
<s> I think the problem may be with the power supply, because when I plug in a video card that has worked in other PCs previously, its fan does not even run. </s>
<s> I am just looking for someone to point me in the right direction. </s>
<s> Might I need a new power supply? </s>
<s> What is the best method to troubleshoot this kind of issue? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any and all help. </s>
<s> And if not, how about another motherboard? </s>
<s> In other words, what spare parts do we have. </s>
<s> If none, you can't troubleshoot this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> fortunately, I work in a place of abundant spare computer parts. </s>
<s> My first instinct was to try out other parts to attempt to isolate my bad part, but having never done this before, I was unsure. </s>
<s> I'll give that a try. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Take a good machine and put the suspect PART (singular) in. </s>
<s> If no video it's that part or that part is misconfigured. </s>
<s> Examples? </s>
<s> Sure but since I can't see the machine I can't guess if these are good or bad guesses. </s>
<s> Ready? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The ATX12V is unplugged. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The motherboard is one where the manual has the typographic error about the HDD LED connection. </s>
<s> There was many thousands of boards that came back but were fine if they unplugged that connection (or read the updated manual.) </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> The CMOS battery is low. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> The CMOS Clear Jumper is on &quot;clear.&quot; Lots of reasons, too many for me to list them all but I thought I'd share my hit parade from last month. </s>

<s> Nothing will work without memory. </s>
<s> If your memory is good and compatible with your motherboard you should get output on the monitor. </s>
<s> (If the monitor is good.) </s>
<s> a good test is to disconnect everything except for the motherboard (with memory), power supply, keyboard and monitor. </s>
<s> You should hear P.O.S.T. </s>
<s> (beeps once. </s>
<s> If it beeps more than once there could be some other problem.) </s>
<s> If everything is working properly you should see at the very least the bios message on the monitor. </s>
<s> from there you can begin adding one part at a time until you hit the faulty part. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
