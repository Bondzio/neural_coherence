1.1.1	(Disclaimer: I am a newbie to these more complex computer issues) My wife and I just inherited a Seagate External Hard Drive; she uses a Mac and I use a PC.	St
1.1.2	I've been searching web forums for a way to format the HD so we can both use it, and have not found any solutions.	St
1.1.3	It looks like the best solution is to use some sort of &quot;NTFS for Mac&quot; program.	St
1.1.4	I'm hoping you more educated folk can help me out with 2 questions: 1) what sort of NTFS program would you recommend?	St
1.1.5	and 2) I've seen a number of freeware &quot;NTFS for Mac&quot; programs on the web: are these effective and safe?	St
1.1.6	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	You didn't say but the newer versions can deal with NTFS natively.	St
1.2.2	Tell more.	St
1.3.1	Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 - we've had the machine for a couple years.	St
1.3.2	Is this new enough?	St
1.3.3	And (here I'm revealing my ignorance) just to be sure: to say that newer Mac operating systems can deal with NTFS &quot;natively&quot; is to say that such a machine wouldn't have a problem syncing with an NTFS formatted external drive, yes?	St
1.4.1	http://www.tool-box.info/blog/archives/1193-On-NTFS-readwrite-support-in-Snow-Leopard.html notes the native method.	St
1.4.2	You can also try NTFS-3G as noted at http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/macnifying-os-x-introduction-and-working-with-ntfs-drives/ You won't spend a dime.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Many thanks.	St
