<s> I'm trying to find somewhere that sells a small power supply as I need a replacement for the PSU in a MEGA 180 PC (Made by MSI). </s>
<s> http://www.msi.com.tw/program/produc...il.php?UID=546 The PSU is a FSP250-60MS. </s>
<s> These look like a special made for MSI by FSP However FSP do a FSP275-50BW http://www.fsp-group.com.tw/english/...d=56&proid=395, which looks like it'll probably do the job but I can't find one anywhere and FSP and MSI don't seem to want to reply to any of my mail/posts. </s>
<s> Has anyone found anything else that'll fit this type of PC? </s>
<s> Dimensions need to be around 140 x 105 x85mm which is quite a bit smaller than most standard XT PSUs. </s>
<s> Try PC POWER AND COOLING as well as MSI for a replacement. </s>

<s> Doh! </s>
<s> PC description is at: http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/slim_pc/slm/pro_slm_detail.php?UID=546 Possible replacement PSU is at: http://www.fsp-group.com.tw/english/1_product/2_detail.asp?mainid=1&fid=56&proid=395 Thanks for pointing that out. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I agree, but its the closest I've found so far. </s>
<s> I would have thought that there must be a lot of these type of compact PCs on the market. </s>
<s> Sureley there must be some sort of alternative. </s>
<s> If PC POWER AND COOLING doesn't have it, contact the place that sells these boxes. </s>
<s> MSI should sell spares. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> There are a bunch of FSP250-60/61s for about $30 shipped (Item #6853658293 includes 2 of them for that price)! </s>
<s> Take a $30 chance. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Aren't they always out of warranty when they go wrong! </s>
<s> This one still works but cuts out after a couple of hours. </s>
<s> The motherboard still thinks it's switched on. </s>
<s> It can't be heat as I've run it with the lid off. </s>
<s> Might be something obvious but don't fancy delving into switchmode PSUs. </s>
<s> Unfortunately I'm in the UK. </s>
<s> There have been a few FSP250s on Ebay but nothing of the same size, ie. </s>
<s> 140 x 100 x 85. </s>
<s> I wonder if many of the FSP250s have the same guts? </s>
<s> I could try a PSU transplant! </s>
<s> shipped to the UK for $26 (USD). </s>
<s> it seems to be long and narrow... maybe the seller has the actual dimensions are or more pics. </s>
<s> good luck on your search. </s>
<s> One of thje critical dimensions is the depth. </s>
<s> It has to be 80mm or less as the back of the case to the processor heatsink is 80mm. </s>
<s> The GTA PSU is 86mm. </s>
<s> It looks like I'll have to try and get one from MSI. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help though. </s>
<s> I'll start polling the ebay.com as well as ebay.co.uk, might turn up something. </s>
