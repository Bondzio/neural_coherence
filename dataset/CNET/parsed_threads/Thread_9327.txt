<s> I am planning to buy a used CRT monitor Viewsonic A90F (VGA input) that has been used for roughly 2 years. </s>
<s> Link http://reviews.cnet.com/crt-monitors/viewsonic-a90f/4507-3175_7-8773931.html?tag=sub My questions are: 1. </s>
<s> Since I recently purchased a motherboard, how would I know the video format type (DVI or VGA) the motherboard supports. </s>
<s> The mobo is based on Intel P965 express chipset. </s>
<s> Full spec here - http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16813121035 2. </s>
<s> I would like to connect my DVD player to the monitor. </s>
<s> The DVD player has both S-Video and component video output (RGB) but I am not sure (could not find from the link above) if the monitor has component video input ports. </s>
<s> Can anyone please clarify this? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> If component video ports are not present in the monitor, is there some kind of adapter in the marker that will convert component RGB to VGA. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> From the info on Intel, you would need a separate video card. </s>
<s> See here: http://www.intel.com/design/motherbd/lt/lt_available.htm That monitor does not appear to have any other inputs than VGA http://www.viewsonic.com/pdf/userguides/a90fplus-1_ug_eng.pdf You may be just as able to play the DVD on your PC rather than try to play it on a DVD player and connect to the monitor. </s>
<s> Any conversion device is going to be way more than putting a DVD drive in your computer, if you do not have one now. </s>
<s> I searched for several video cards which suuport VGA port but most of them list the following ports: D-SUB, DVI, S-Video. </s>
<s> Foe e.g., http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102086 Seems like the D-SUB port is the same as VGA port (it has 15 pins). </s>
<s> So, this video card would be compatible with a CRT monitor. </s>
<s> Right? </s>
<s> Since I have a laptop with a 15pin VGA port, I want to hook-up my desktop CPU with the laptop and use the laptop monitor instead of buying a separate CRT monitor for cost-cutting. </s>
<s> But this will only work if the VGA port on the laptop has physically the same dimensions as the VGA ports on normal desktop CRT monitors. </s>
<s> The VGA port on my laptop is here: See component#7 on page9 in http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c00325428.pdf I can atleast confirm that the laptop VGA port is not a mini-VGA ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-VGA ). </s>
<s> Do you know if VGA ports on laptops are physically different from VGA ports on CRT monitors? </s>
<s> It sounds like you asked it you could use the screen on your laptop as the monitor for the desktop, it that correct? </s>
<s> If that is correct, then the answer is no. </s>
<s> That VGA port on the laptop is to connect an external monitor to the laptop so you can use the external monitor with the laptop. </s>
<s> It is not an input port. </s>
<s> The VGA port on the laptop should be the same as the input connector on the monitor, but it is not intended for connecting two computers together. </s>
