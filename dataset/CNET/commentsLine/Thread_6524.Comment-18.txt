of ddr2-533 ram as then you'll end up with 3gbs ram running at 533mhz and not dual channel.
that's a very very poor choice...any way you look at it.
for about $50...you can have 4gb ram (2 dimms @ 2gb each) running dual channel at 800mhz.
that said ... here's my best and final recommendation  ...4gb in 2 dimms for $45.99 * chipset: intel g965 * supported dram types: ddr2 sdram only * module types supported: unbuffered only * error detection support: non-ecc only * graphics support: pci express x16 * max component density: 1024 * usb support: 2.x compliant * 240-pin ddr2 dimm banking: 4 (2 banks of 2) * ddr2 sdram frequencies: pc2-4200, pc2-5300, and pc2-6400 * max unbuffered ddr2 sdram: 8192mb * maximum memory using pc2-4200 or pc2-5300 is 8192mb.
maximum memory using pc2-6400 is 4096mb.although the memory can be installed one module at a time, the best performance comes from using matched pairs of modules.
q: will my system recognize the maximum upgrade?
a: possibly how much memory your windows os will recognize depends on which version of windows you are running.
32-bit versions of windows will see (and utilize) only 3gb or 3.5gb.
to utilize more memory, install a 64-bit version of your os.
more information about os memory maximums can be found at  .
q: what memory goes into my computer, and will a faster speed be backward-compatible?
a: ddr2 memory with support for ddr2 pc2-6400,ddr2 pc2-8500,ddr2 pc2-5300 speeds.
q: how much memory can my computer handle?
a: 8192mb.
adding the maximum amount of memory will improve performance and help extend the useful life of your system as you run increasingly demanding software applications in the future.
q: do i have to install matching pairs?
a: yes.
your system requires that you install memory in pairs.
q: does my computer support dual-channel memory?
a: yes.
to benefit from the performance advantages offered by dual-channel systems, you should install memory in identical pairs.
installing a kitted pair is the best way to ensure that your modules are identical, right down to the chip count.
q: does my computer support ecc memory?
a: no.
your system does not support ecc.
because ecc and non-ecc modules should not be mixed within a system, install the same type of modules that are already in your system.
