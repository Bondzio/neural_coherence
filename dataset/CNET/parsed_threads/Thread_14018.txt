<s> Hello ppl, This is my first post. </s>
<s> I have this strange problem on my friend's comp and hope to solve it. </s>
<s> The config is AMD 64 X2 3600+ and MSI K9NGM motherboard based on nvidia 6100 chipset. </s>
<s> The problem is as follows: The latest drivers and forceware drivers have been installed. </s>
<s> Also latest version of directx 9 has been installed after a fresh installation on WinXP. </s>
<s> When attempting to play games like Fifa05, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Counter Strike CZ, the screen blanks out. </s>
<s> Then jagged, pixelated image/video of the game begins, virtually not watchable as most of the screen is blank. </s>
<s> This is with direct3d and direct draw enabled in dxdiag. </s>
<s> General movies/Videos play only when direc3d and direct draw is disabled. </s>
<s> Videos are pixelated and have greenish tinge and basically horrible when direct3d and direct draw is enabled. </s>
<s> The test of direct3d and direct draw fails with the foll result: No rectangles or Cubes were drawn. </s>
<s> DirectDraw test results: Failure at step 5 (User verification of rectangles): HRESULT = 0x00000000 (error code) Direct3D 7 test results: Failure at step 32 (User verification of Direct3D rendering): HRESULT = 0x00000000 (error code) Direct3D 8 test results: Failure at step 32 (User verification of Direct3D rendering): HRESULT = 0x00000000 (error code) Im virtually clueless how to solve this... Is it a graphic problem as it appears to be or something els. </s>
<s> Will buying a Graphics card help? </s>
<s> Or should the motherboard be changed? </s>
<s> Plllsssss help Thanks in advance </s>
<s> While I can't comment on the game, the video playback was terrible. </s>
<s> A little poking around found the properties for the video card and it's color adjustments were whacko. </s>
<s> Moving the sliders to the usual defaults cured the video playback issue. </s>

<s> Its not the hue/brightness problem while playing videos. </s>
<s> With Direct3d and Direct Draw disabled, the videos are scrambled with color tinges of various shades. </s>
<s> Its like viewing a partially downloaded video with some bad effects thrown in. </s>
<s> the games don run in ne case. </s>
<s> RMA the bad parts. </s>
