If it is, you get to find and install hardware drivers for it. Win 7 may have some and if you are fortunate may have them all, but when installed you should head over to the Device Manager and check.

When you install the new drive and start the Win 7 installation, that setup process will replace XP's boot.ini with it's own BCD file, (Boot Configuration Data). It is this which allows the dual boot. If you then remove the XP drive or wipe the data from it, Windows 7 will no longer boot, because it's boot file has been removed. Worth remembering. Mark
