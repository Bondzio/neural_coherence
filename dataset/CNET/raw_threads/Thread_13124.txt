I really want the best one not too particular about the brand. I just can't really find many reviews of range extenders online. Thanks

If you take a look at the reviews on http://www.wifirepeaterreviews.com you will get tonnes of reviews on it. Some people appear to prefer it just because its easy to use and you don't really have to be concerned about it being the &quot;best&quot;. But then there's a bunch of people who are interested in their latest releases which are just picking up steam. Take a look either way and you'll find something on there.
