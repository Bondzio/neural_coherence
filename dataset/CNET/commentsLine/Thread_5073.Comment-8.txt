your fix may be in sp2.
from what i have read.
you can try it and if it doesn't work you can uninstall it.
if your system will let you get that far without rebooting.
try to reset bios first, then try removing memory modules if you have more than one.
if you have 2 or 3, take them all out and try putting one in at a time in the first slot and try booting with one.
do this with each one.
if thats not the problem try to uninstall your video driver and reinstall it or look for an upgrade at the manufacturer.
if that doesn't work try to get service pack 2. if that doesn't work open a side panel and try blowing a fan inside while booting.
if that doesn't work i would wipe the drive clean and reinstall xp.
sometimes an install doesn't always setup properly.
let me know what you have tried.
