hi my problem is with my seagate 1tb expansion drive.when im using this hard drive to watch films on my tv or media box it shuts off within the first 10 mins (not exactly 10 mins could be 7.43 mins ect).this hard drive does not turn off and works fine when its plugged into my computer.i have done tests on seatools, hd tune pro and window error checker for bad sectors, problems ect and all seems fine.
i dont think its a problem with seagates power saving mode but not 100% additional info this hard drive is not just powered by the computer ,it had to be plugged into a power socket for power.it is usb 3.0. i only really use this hard drive for watching films on my tv and media box
