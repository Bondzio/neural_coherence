The solutions i've checked into all use wireless G which would give roughly 200-300 feet between repeaters.
The wireless N routers claim 3x the coverage of wireless G which would give 600-700 feet between repeaters.
This means less equipment would be necessary to cover the same area meaning less cost to deploy, but if im spending more money on wireless N equipment that is only gonna reach 200-300 feet whats the point?
Will the wireless repeaters connect to each other using wireless N or wireless G?
Does anyone know the answer to this?
