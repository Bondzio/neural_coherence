<s> Shortly after my wife picked up a wirless Sony Viao laptop, and decided to share our Comcast broadband with our kids (using AOL dial-up), I picked up the standard Linksys router (which is looped directly through my desktop in my office), and a Linksys adapter for my kids computer two rooms away. </s>
<s> The router is the G, four port, WRT54G. </s>
<s> After a week of wireless bliss (kids in seventh-heaven over no more dialup), the connection began to intermittently lose connectivity, then with &quot;repair, pick up again. </s>
<s> That lasted another week. </s>
<s> From that point on I was on the phone with Linksys every three days, going through complex diagnostics, pinging left, right, and center. </s>
<s> Each time they managed to get my kids puter back online...but it has become tedious. </s>
<s> It seems each tech has a different reasoning for why that adapter loses signal. </s>
<s> It's two rooms away, and no brick walls or other obvious impeding structures in the way. </s>
<s> I recently read in a pc magazine the glitch could be the 2.4GHz cordless phone, and fax/cordless phone in my office. </s>
<s> What do I do? </s>
<s> Shoot out and replace everything with 5GHz communication equiptment...or is there a better router/adpter I can switch to??? </s>
<s> Any help is greatly appreciated. </s>

<s> the Logic is when the cordless is off the base, it will transmit a signal... also when you don't use it anymore.. same logic apply... remove the battery.. </s>
<s> The cordless phone COULD be your problem, but it doesn't sound like it to me. </s>
<s> Try moving the phone on one side of your office computer, the router on the other. </s>
<s> See if that makes a difference (same for any cordless phone near the kid's computer). </s>
<s> I have heard that the proximity of the phone to the router (or adapter) can be a problem, though I didn't experience it myself. </s>
<s> If you seem to keep losing connections at a regular interval (like every 24, 48 hrs), then it would likely be your Router's LEASE time settings for the internet connection. </s>
<s> Presuming that you have a DYNAMIC IP address for your cable modem (like MY Comcast connection), check your router's LEASE time. </s>
<s> Either set it to NEVER (if that is an option), or check for an option to have it auto-reconnect. </s>
<s> It could be at some interval close to when you usually have the connection drop on you. </s>
<s> If it doesn't auto reconnect, you lose connection, and have to restart the router. </s>
<s> If it is only the connection to the wireless adapter on the Kid's computer, it COULD be simply having trouble getting a good signal. </s>
<s> That could be phone related, or due to other structures in the house (plumbing in walls, brick work, etc). </s>
<s> If the adapter on the kid's computer is a wireless USB adapter, see if they can move it farther away from the monitor or computer. </s>
<s> And change the orientation of the antenna. </s>
<s> That might help. </s>
<s> The last option would be to place the router in a more central location between the computers, or get an range extender. </s>
<s> I say check the LEASE time settings on the router first. </s>
<s> Make sure it is either set to NEVER, or check for the option to auto-reconnect. </s>
<s> good luck Larry Bell </s>
