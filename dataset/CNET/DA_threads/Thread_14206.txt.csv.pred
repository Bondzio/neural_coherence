1.1.1	I 'm having trouble setting up my home wired network and was wondering if anyone had experience this .	St
1.1.2	I have the cable modem connected to the router ( Belkin N+ ) in the living room and there is a wall ethernet jack .	St
1.1.3	I connected the router to the ethernet jack and that goes to my wire closet and is connected to a 5 port switch ( Linksys 10/100 ) .	St
1.1.4	The switch is then connected to 4 other ethernet lines that goes to other wall jacks in the house .	St
1.1.5	The problem is that when I plug in a computer to the wall jack , it recognize that there 's a signal but no internet or assigning of IP address .	St
1.1.6	Any help would be appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	Power off the router , switch , and PC .	St
1.2.2	With all devices connected , power back up in this order : Router - wait for the lights to stabilize .	St
1.2.3	Switch - wait for the lights to stabilize .	Sug
1.2.4	PC .	St
1.2.5	If you decide to move the PC , you may have to do the above steps again .	St
1.2.6	For some reason , some systems and routers do not take well to disconnects and reconnects .	St
1.2.7	The key word is & quot ; may & quot ; as once the PC is assigned an IP address , it may be able to move around as needed .	St
1.3.1	You have Ethernet to a 5 port switch .	St
1.3.2	So , essentially , you have two switches .	St
1.3.3	If these are not of the & quot ; auto-sensing & quot ; type or the Linksys does n't have a dedicated or switchable uplink , you need to use a crossover cable to connect the two .	St
1.4.1	I tried to plug the ethernet to the uplink port on the linksys switch but no dice .	St
1.4.2	Have n't tried it with a cross over cable yet	St
1.5.1	and will have something like MDIX silk screened by the button .	St
