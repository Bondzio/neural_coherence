1.5.3	ccall fujitsu again and ask for recommendations konny	St
1.6.1	looked around notebookforums.com and it CAN NOT be upgraded .	St
1.6.2	yes , it can be replaced but unless fujitsu er some other company make a special gpu to fit that then no .	Res
1.6.3	suggestion - overclock ur gpu .	Sug
1.6.4	it will automatically be underclocked to conserve power .	St
1.6.5	use ATI TOOL .	St
1.6.6	but make sure it does n't overheat or artifacr .	St
1.6.7	konny	St
1.7.1	that ?	Ques
1.7.2	can you tell me a few more details , and just exactly what overclocking the gpu does ?	Ques
1.7.3	and how much should i overclock ?	Ques
1.8.1	ok first , download ATI Tool from here http : //downloads.guru3d.com/downloadget.php ? id=725 & file=4 & evp=335618f7a0cacd5c48ca8b15da68e9fd alright , after you install the program , make note of the clock speed that is default .	St
1.8.2	you wont have to remember these because it saves it in its own profile under default to restore if anything goes wrong .	St
1.8.3	ok , what i did when i had my x300 desktop version was go into the settings of it and change apply overclock after moving slider or something like that .	St
1.8.4	open the 3d demo tab and there should be a cube thingy spinning around.now to overclock , start with the core and move it up in 5 increments making sure to note that on the 3d demo , no spikey things are sticking out because that is artifacting .	St
1.8.5	after you go up like 20MHz , try the memory clock .	St
1.8.6	5 increments also , if not avaible , just go up in small increments .	St
1.8.7	again make sure NO artifacting .	St
1.8.8	also let it run at the overclock for awhile and then feel the bottom of the notebook where your gpu is .	Sug
1.8.9	make sure this DOESNT get TOO HOT !	St
1.8.10	after you found the highest overclock without artifacting , just let it run for a couple minutes .	St
1.8.11	warnings ... the desktop might blur colors if you have gone to far .	St
1.8.12	lower the clock , and re-apply your desktop wallpaper and it will be fine .	St
1.8.13	the only way to see if this truely can help performance is in bench marking and in gaming .	St
1.8.14	download 3d Mark 05 and let it run at your default clock .	St
1.8.15	( *oh , dont forget to save your high overclock in the profiles tab er something* ) and then run it at your overclock .	Sug
1.8.16	MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE LATEST DRIVERS FROM ATI .	St
1.8.17	download catalyst 5.6 er something and everything will run smoother .	St
1.8.18	gaming ... download fraps or use the console command to show the fps .	St
1.8.19	run the game at the default clock and make note of the average fps you see in the corner .	St
1.8.20	now load the overclocked profile and now run the game .	St
1.8.21	making note of the average fps in the corner .	St
1.8.22	congratulations !	St
1.8.23	if you did this correctly , you have overclocked your laptop .	St
1.8.24	post if you have any questions .	St
