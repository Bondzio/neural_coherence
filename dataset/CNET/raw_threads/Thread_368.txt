One machine on my network is approximately 40-45 feet away from it and behind 2 walls, and running 802.11b. It seems that the machine in question can only see and connect to the network intermittently. At first i thought it was a low signal strength issue but the level of reliability seems to vary, and when it DOES connect it appears to have a decent signal. There is a moderately high amount of traffic here, we can usually see at least 5-6 networks. I've tried several frequencies to no noticible difference. Any ideas what may be the issue? Bad router? Bad card? Just need more signal? Thanks

Try 1.0 mbps. It's a radio. You are shielding the radios so that's the way it works. What to do? Get closer, put a repeater in between. Bob

To determine why requires a few million bucks of equipment in some radio site survey truck. For well under 100 bucks, a repeater will likely just cure it. Let me share that a microwave oven cohabits this frequency space and is some 1000 Watts. It's not supposed to leak much but I have seen them interfere with Wifi operation. If you want to know why, I must bow out now. If you want to fix it, the repeater will likely cure it. It has so far. Bob

INSTEAD OF SPENDING THE MONEY FOR A REPEATER, AND SURE THAT WILL WORK JUST FINE, I SAVED MONEY AND BOUGHT EXTENDED ANTENNAS, AND FOUND THE GAIN JUST ENOUGH TO SOLVE THE SAME PROBLEM THAT I HAD. I BOUGHT THE ANTENNAS FROM BEST BUY..... GOOD LUCK DONT BUY A GENERTIC BRAND, I TRIED, AND DIDN'T WORK, LINKSY HAS A DEDICATED PAIR THAT WORKED FOR ME MODEL: HGA7T
