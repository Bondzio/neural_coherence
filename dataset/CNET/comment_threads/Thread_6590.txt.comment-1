I have a lot of old vinyl and cassettes that I want to transfer to digital format on my computer.
Since the source of these formats are analog, and the typical line-in on a sound card is analog, I am wondering how I can best tranfer the audio data to digital.
My stereo receiver does not have a digital output, only inputs.
I guess what I am asking is for the &quot;best&quot; means to convert old format audio to digital and what hardware/software should I be looking at?
Particularly the sound card and the proper input to the PC for capturing the digital conversion.
thanks.
