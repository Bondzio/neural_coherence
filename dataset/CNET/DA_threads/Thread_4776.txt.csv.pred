1.2.1	Neither Apple nor NVIDIA have confirmed this for us .	St
1.2.2	Apparently , many NVIDIA graphics cards are subject to manufacturing defects .	St
1.2.3	As such , they could fail after certain periods of use .	St
1.2.4	I have heard that the supposedly affected 8400 and 8600 cards actually belong to computers built by Dell and HP ; Apple may not have them .	St
1.2.5	No one knows if ALL of the chips are bad .	St
1.2.6	Some people say that their NVIDIA-equipped MacBooks are failing , but they are in the minority ( so far ) .	St
1.2.7	Mine works perfectly , and many others do too .	St
1.2.8	If your MacBook works fine , I would n't be concerned .	St
1.2.9	If Apple orders a recall , then it should cover all affected notebooks , covered by AppleCare or not .	St
