hi!
i have a pc running xp pro.
i have tons of software applications, system files & etc on my main c drive.
i purchased acronis true image workstation with universal restore.
it's a bit difficult though getting a proper simple answer from the company to select either &quot;clone&quot; or &quot;backup&quot; for my needs.
i wish to have a safe copy of my main drive that will work without having to reinstall all the applications, xp pro system, serials & etc... which would take days.... in the event my pc is stolen or the main drive goes kaput!
do i make a &quot;clone' of the current drive & to have in safe keeping... and then just install the drive into the old pc or new one?
or do i make a &quot;backup&quot; using this program.
does any angel know!?
thank you, kris
