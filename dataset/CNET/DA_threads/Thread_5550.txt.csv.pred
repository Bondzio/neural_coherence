1.1.1	Hey Guys My computer just now is based around the still respectable Athlon 3200 XP so its not exactly ready for the scrap heap but i bought it January 2005 when 754 wasent quite the brick wall it is the now so upgrading means a full system upgrade which aint really a bad thing cos a PCI-e board will be well good!	St
1.1.2	Anyway, my question is how do the 4400 and 4800 dule-cores compare to the 3200 - obviously i assume that they are both better but are they worth the high price tags attached.	St
1.1.3	The reason I have not mentioned the 4600 is because im keen on having the 2mb cache which only the 4400 and the 4800 have.	St
1.1.4	In the end i think upgrading is gonna be the best plan but is it worth upgrading to the 4800 at almost double the price or will the 4400 do me just as well?	St
1.1.5	Thanks	Polite
