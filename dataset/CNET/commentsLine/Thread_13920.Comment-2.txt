seems that you did what i had to do with four of them to get the supply to turn on.
they all came with the cmos jumper in the wrong position.
in the case of these the manul showed the positions correctly, just that the mobos shipped with the jumper in the wiring position.
one thing common to putting new mobo in old case is to miss the fact that there is a hex standoff left on the mounting plate that does not line up with the new mobos plated ring mounting holes.
this results in shorting the artwork on the bottom layer of the mobo.
