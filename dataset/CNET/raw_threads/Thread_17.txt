So first visit www.crucial.com and enter the data of your laptop for advice about what it can have and what type you need. I didn't do it for you. Of course, 8 GB only makes sense if you have a 64-bit OS. With a 32-bit OS the top 4 GB won't be used at all. I can't give advice about makers and shops. I've bought extra memory 2 times. The first time at our local variant of craigslist, the second time in a local computer shop. But that's not what you're looking for, I assume. Kees

I am already deciding about two types of memory. They are prety the same but they differ with &quot;speed&quot; [first one PC3-8500 ; second one PC3-1060] and in frequency [first one 1066 and second one 1333]. Does these parameters matter a lot? Can I say, higher the better? The price si same to the last cent. Thanks for your help. Oh BTW, my OS is win 7, 64bit

I want to speed up my manipulating and rotation in viewport. Number of polygons in my projects really increased since last semester, and it lags in big scenes. Do you think that extra memory I want to buy can help me in this kind of issue? I think it will do some better performence, but if it is worth of 100 euros. What do you think? My OS is 64bit.

That will make a big difference in your computer speed. Make sure you install identical pairs, which means same brand with same frequency. Ram does not affect graphics that much but it makes difference. Thanks MacWin Technology
