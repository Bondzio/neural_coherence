the stock hs fan, clean it up good and reinstall it using some arctic silver 5. they've got good info on how to apply it.
if that doesn't do it...then i'd spring for the better hs fan combo to add to that mini-hovercraft.
almost hard to understand how that cpu could be running hot with all those fans unless of course it wasn't sitting flush now.
let me know how it works.
