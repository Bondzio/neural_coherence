thanks i find your message really helpfull, i was thinking about it and yes, i think i m gonna stick with 2gb of ram, i had no idea about hitachis are not reliable so i ll get a different one, i will definately check that website out.
what do you think about the processor, because what i know is that there are 4 kinds of intel new processors : the xtreme one that is like $900 and i dont need that much any way, then there are the 2.13ghz, 2.44 and 2.66 right?
i would like to get the fastest one, but is it really worth?
thanks for awnser, very helpfull
