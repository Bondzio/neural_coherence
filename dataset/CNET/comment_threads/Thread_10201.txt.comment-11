I followed your suggestion for checking that the problem didn't lie with the board so after that I went back to square one.
Redid all the jumpers on both the old and new drives and it now sees both correctly.
Many thanks for your help.
It may have been a stupid mistake on my part, but at least it showed up the failing CMOS battery when the computer was opened up.
