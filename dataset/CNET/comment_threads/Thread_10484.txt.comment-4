I have an FTP server at home (3com 3Cserver).
It is just an old PC with several hard drives.
I can use my browser to connect using &quot; ftp://10.0.0.50&quot; in the URL.
I like it better than Microsoft &quot;File and Print sharing&quot;.
It is all about preference.
I find the MS protocols very chatty.
This is ok on an ethernet switch with 100 Meg of full duplex bandwidth but i want my wireless only sending necessary traffic.
