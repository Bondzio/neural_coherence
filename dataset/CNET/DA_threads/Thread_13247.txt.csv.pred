1.1.1	Aside from always having to connect and disconnect my laptop to my HDTV with an HDMI cable , what other options do I have to access my media files ( largely DivX and AVI files -torrent downloads ) on my HDTV through my wireless network ?	Ques
1.1.2	ie I looked at Boxee or Apple TV set top boxes , but I would n't really use the streaming functionality so not sure if there is another better option ?	Ques
1.1.3	I realize this is a basic question - I am not technical at all !	St
1.1.4	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Folk that want it all are probably best fitted with some PC as piece you would have put in that Apple TV .	St
1.2.2	And the fact you have a collection or mismosh of varied encoded content means you would be upset as some files worked and others did n't ( see the Samsung forum for examples where folks do n't want to know , they want it to play . )	St
1.2.3	I suggest a PC .	St
