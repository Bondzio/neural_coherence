yes there are splitters.
i do not know what the name of it is.
(there are so many types of connectors and adaptors and cables and splitters) cables to go dot com (not sure how it is spelled) is an example of a bunch of cables.
if i were you i would just buy two identical surge protectors (a.k.a.
&quot;sps&quot;) and now i am confused about how this is all going to be connected.
i guess i could draw a map of what i think something like this would look like, but i won't.
