I thought I had a power surge because all of a sudden it wouldn't power up. No lights, no spin and wasn't recognized by laptop. So I opened it up to see if I could see any damage. I checked the tvs diodes d3 and d4. They were good. On to the SATA power connectors. got blue lights that were on and off, a very short spin and then the connectors burst out in flames. Nothing hurt except the SATA connectors. Can I replace only those or do I need a new pcb? Can I do both of these things myself? I don't know which numbers so if you need something else let me know.

Replace the connections if you can find the parts but I found new USB or SATA enclosures to be more plentiful and easy compared to replacing a connector. Bob
