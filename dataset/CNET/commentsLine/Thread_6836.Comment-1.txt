i keep getting this message, even though the cable is not disconnected.
i successfully had a home network for about two years, and then suddenly this message popped up.. on the host computer, it only happens to the card that i'm using for the network, but on the other computer it happens to both cards.
i've replaced the cards, swapped the cables around, and even replaced the cat 5 cable.
nothing has helped.
can anybody give me some more suggestions please?
