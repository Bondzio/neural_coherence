<s> I have a ton of old family photos to scan into my computer. </s>
<s> Very few have negatives but a few do. </s>
<s> Most are just the photos. </s>
<s> My question is. </s>
<s> Is there a scanner that has an auto feeder that will work with photos? </s>
<s> I didn't know if they made one. </s>
<s> I know they have document feeders but wasn't sure if it would damage photos. </s>
<s> Thanks for your time. </s>

<s> The finish on these prints are too soft for automatic feeding. </s>
<s> If you have a Windows 2000, XP machine see if you can find a HP P1000 like http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=hp+p1000+photosmart+Scanner&btnG=Google+Search&aq=0&oq= and http://www.shopwiki.com/search/HP_Photo_Scanner_1000_%28C9907A%29?loose=t If you find one, you may find that at under 15 seconds per scan you can scan in quite a few photos without much ado. </s>

<s> Not only will photos be torn by trying to document feed them, photos unlike documents rarely can be batch scanned to get good results. </s>
<s> A fast scanner will help, but you will spend time with each photo. </s>
<s> I've scanned in many old family photos over the years with great success. </s>
