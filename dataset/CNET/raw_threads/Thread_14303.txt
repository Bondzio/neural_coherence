After the comcast technician repaired the cables, I was able to get my desktop back on the internet, but not the laptop. My desktop is wired to the netgear router, and my laptop is wireless. My laptop IS connected to the network. I am able to share the printer as before. I originally used my laptop to set up the router and network. Very frustrated, please help. This my first time posting, and I'm not sure if this is enought information.

After being able to connect with a network cable, and then also with a USB adapter, I'm pretty sure it's the wireless card in my laptop. I will soon give Dell a call. Thanks for your help.

Everytime my ISP changes the IP address, I lose my internet connection on the laptop. I have been unplugging the router and when I plug it in again my connection is restored. Is there a setting that can be changed in order to prevent this from happening to me???? Can the instructions you gave (Control Panel -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Connections Tab LAN settings Make sure all the boxes are unchecked. It sometimes will revert to Proxy Settings if there is no internet when you tried to connect.), apply to my situation, too? I appreciate your help with this. It's been driving me crazy. My ISP was no help and basically blamed it on the router. I have been searching everywhere for a simple answer to this, but even when I did find an article that might apply, it was too technical for me to understand. Thank you.......Gina

(64 bit instead of 128 bit WEP for one thing). He told me that the Dell draft N wireless mini-card in my laptop may have compatiblility issues with a Netgear router. (I had no problems at all until the comcast lines were cut by the Direct TV installers)! At any rate, he made me cut back on the encryption level, and now I'm back on line.

Were you also getting disconnected when your ISP changed your IP number, or were you having a problem connecting all of the time? As I mentiond earlier, the only time I have a problem is when my ISP changes the IP number every few days. That makes me wonder if my solution could possibly be as simple as changing a setting--but if so, which setting????

It should be Cable &gt; Cable modem &gt; Wireless Router &gt; Wired desktop or Cable &gt; Cable modem &gt; Wireless Router If it's connected like this, your settings for your wireless router should NOT change. If you have it hooked up like this: Cable &gt; Wireless Router &gt; Cable modem &gt; wired desktop or Cable &gt; Wireless Router &gt; Cable modem This is wrong! Hope this helps. Rick

I am 99% sure mine does go: Cable &gt; Wireless Router &gt; Cable modem &gt; wired desktop, because I believe that's how the instructions said to do it! I am going to redo the connections as you suggested. Will I also have to change any settings because of this setup change, or should changing the connection order alone do the trick?? Thank you again! I will be so happy to get this pesky problem corrected!!.......Gina
