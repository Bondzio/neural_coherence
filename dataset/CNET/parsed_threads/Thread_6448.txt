<s> I have a desktop with 2 drives a C which shows up as windows and is 50gb and a D which shows up as Data and is 1.8tb. </s>
<s> I was told that everything would automatically go where it was supposed to go. </s>
<s> However when I tried to save a programme - it defaulted to C drive - the computer said I did not have enough space on the drive. </s>
<s> It said I needed 15gb and I only had 13 gb. </s>
<s> When I go to my menu I see that just about everything is on C drive and my D drive is just about empty. </s>
<s> Can I just decide to save everything to D, or can I rename D to C and what do I do when things automatically want to go to C. Can I just change this to D. If necessary will have to get a technician in, but I'm hoping someone can give me hints. </s>
<s> I back up both drives on an external drive. </s>
<s> Thank you - June </s>
<s> But I've never found this to be automatic. </s>
<s> I never suggest a small C drive unless the owner is very PC savvy. </s>
<s> It's far too much to ask new owners to cater to such a setup. </s>
<s> No. </s>
<s> You can't rename D to C. Bob </s>

<s> Yes there are definitely 2 drives. </s>
<s> The C drive has 59 gb and that is the one that is nearly full. </s>
<s> The D drive has 1.8 Tb and that is the one that is nearly empty. </s>
<s> Thanks - June </s>
<s> as most systems have only one HDD....sometimes split or partitioned into two or more logical drives. </s>
<s> But if you're sure there are 2 separate physical drives mounted internally...the options are to replace the smaller HDD and image the smaller HDD to it. </s>
<s> Or you could image the smaller drive (C) to the larger drive and use the 1.8TB HDD as your internal HDD. </s>
<s> Personally I like the idea of two internal HDDs as I use the 2nd HDD solely as a backup to the 1st HDD. </s>
<s> With a second drive mounted internally, backups and restores are quick and easy. </s>
<s> External HDDs are OK but usually less reliable as you can see from reading in this forum. </s>
