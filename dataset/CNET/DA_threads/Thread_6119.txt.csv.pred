1.2.1	But look at the usual ATI 5450 1GB low profile compatible card you find for 30 bucks at newegg .	St
1.2.2	It 's a sleeper of a card that has HDMI and enough oomph without need to change the power supply in all the boxes I 've seen .	St

1.3.1	Does the interface type matter ?	Ques
1.3.2	how would I figure this out if I had to know ?	Ques

1.4.1	You supplied quite a few details .	St
1.4.2	Maybe I missed which Lenovo it is .	St
1.4.3	Sorry but the card 's memory is only of interest to those that dissect cards .	St
1.4.4	Here we need a video card .	St
1.4.5	The memory could be DDR , static or core and it would not matter to the host PC .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	It 's refurbished ( joy systems ) - so I 'm not sure that the components are original - it could actually be 'rebuilt ' - with some other components but this was the description : Lenovo IBM ThinkCentre M55e Desktop PC - Intel Dual-Core 1.6GHz , 2GB DDR2 , 80GB HDD , DVD-ROM , Windows 7 Home Premium 32-bit , Also - wo n't buy from newegg anymore - nothing but headaches with UPS lost shipment .
