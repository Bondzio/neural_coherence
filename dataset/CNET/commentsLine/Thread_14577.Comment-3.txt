well, i would've thought so too since they are simple voice recordings, but so far i cannot find anything to play or convert the files that is my end goal; to convert the files to mp3 so they can copied onto a cd &amp; played in any cd player.
i have limited knowledge of such things but done a fair amount of research and can't seem to find another solution.
at this point, it seems easiest to try &amp; go back to the original setup with windows 98 and faxworks.
i have the files on cd (along with an installed version of faxworks) and also on my hard drive.
each .vmf file has a sister .ctl file.
two files with the same name, just different file extensions.
thanks for your interest!
