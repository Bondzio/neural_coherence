1.1.1	I have just installed the DI-624 to set up my wireless network at home .	St
1.1.2	I followed the instructions , changed the SSID , changed the admin password , and enabled WEP 128bit encryption with a random key .	St
1.1.3	( I was going to use WPA , but my laptop does not accept WPA , so I am using WEP . )	St
1.1.4	My landline computer has Internet Security with firewall enabled and Internet virus scan .	St
1.1.5	First , is there an easy way to test to see if I have adequately protected my wireless network so that no one can use my network or gain access to my home computer ?	Ques
1.1.6	Second , I have n't figured out how to properly set up the firewall on the DI-624 itself .	St
1.1.7	Is this necessary or is having the firewall on my computer sufficient .	St
1.1.8	I 'm a newbie at the whole wireless realm , so any help would be greatly appreciated .	St
1.2.1	You have changed the SSID and set the encryption which is good .	St
1.2.2	Take it a step further and stop the SSID from broadcasting which will stop anyone from knowing that you have a wireless network setup .	St
1.2.3	It should be a simple matter of choosing enable/disable from the online setup .	St
1.2.4	You did not say if you are using a wireless card or built in one in the laptop .	St
1.2.5	If its a card then on it you should see MAC and then a mix of # 's and letters .	St
1.2.6	With it you can enable Mac filtering using the interface which will only allow that card to interact with the router wirelessly .	St
1.2.7	To test ask a friend with a laptop to try and use your network and if you did it correctly they will not even be able to find it in a search .	Sug
1.2.8	As for the firewall it putting a wall before the one on your computer , good but not something worry about .	St
1.2.9	Just use D-link online support for help in setting it up .	St
1.2.10	Sorry could not give exact info as I have not use D-Link but the info is general for all of the big makers of routers as they all offer the same things now .	St
1.2.11	Someone else may be able to give exact info .	St
1.3.1	1 .	St
1.3.2	Try to log into the network without entering the proper WEP password .	St
1.3.3	If you ca n't then it is working .	St
1.3.4	Note : If you logged in at least one time already and the wireless connection utility saved the password in the properties of a ''Preferred Network , '' the you will not be prompted for the password until you change the password on the router or ''Remove '' the Preferred Neteork from your list .	St
1.3.5	Check the router manual to see if it can provide the added protection of some sort of MAC filtering .	St
1.3.6	2 .	St
1.3.7	Router firewall should automatically be on .	St
1.3.8	Read more about this in the router manual .	St
1.3.9	Be safer -- use the router firewall and at most one software firewall on each computer .	St
1.3.10	My rule is always to have firewall , antivirus , and more than one antispyware program on each computer at all times .	St
1.4.1	Thanks to both people responding .	St
1.4.2	I have incorporated all suggestions and it appears to be working well .	St
1.4.3	Cheers !	St
