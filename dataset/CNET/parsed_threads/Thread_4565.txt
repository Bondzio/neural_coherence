<s> I bought a Simpletech simpledrive 250GB external drive. </s>

<s> I got the external SimpleTech Simpledrive 500Gb a week ago. </s>

<s> Formatted (NTFS) with no problem. </s>

<s> Next day I find that the drive has reverted to RAW formatting again. </s>
<s> I tried installing again via the accompanying disk, reformatted to NTFS and, after two more days, I put a few more folders on. </s>
<s> A day later, I go back to the drive and find that it's reverted to the unformatted state - gone back to the RAW - so I couldn't access it (the file folders were mainly back-ups so I wasn't unduly worried). </s>
<s> Hmmm - tried their 'Support' line - no reply (and it's been either no reply or voicemail several times since). </s>

<s> First try both drives at another PC. </s>
<s> If they work there, it's the computer. </s>
<s> Then try ALL USB-ports. </s>
<s> Some may work, some may not work. </s>
<s> If you find a working one, you're done, more or less. </s>
<s> Then try a working USB-port (check with any other USB device, like a mouse or a USB-stick) and connect it the disk through an active hub to that port. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> I tried plugging the drive into another computer... it worked like a charm... so it looks like it's my computer. </s>
<s> Not sure what to do next. </s>

<s> This post looks like it's getting hijacked and is getting fragmented. </s>
<s> I looked at just your posts and can't tell if you use the rear USB port and if you installed your motherboard's chipset drivers. </s>

<s> I just did what you said, and it worked fine for me. </s>

<s> I have a simpletech 500gb external drive and experienced all the same problems as you did.......the wire that comes with it is cheap, so after much aggravation I decided to change the usb wire and have NEVER had a problem since, hope this helps........ </s>

<s> if it is not your usb wire, it may be the connection from the usb port, i took my 250gb simpletech hard drive apart and disconnected the wires form the hard drive and reconnected them, i hope this helps anyone that couldn't find an alternative solution </s>
<s> SimpleTech sent me one of these drives as a replacement for another one of theirs that failed. </s>
<s> It did NOT work out of the box, but here is how I got mine to work just fine. </s>
<s> SimpleTech told me to go to RadioShack and buy a power supply. </s>
<s> It was a 7.5 watt, and cost over $30 I decided that was TOO much. </s>
<s> So I went to WalMart and bought one of those powersupply things that you can adjust the voltage on, and has all sorts of plug in tips. </s>
<s> WalMart had two types of these, and I bought the cheaper of the two. </s>
<s> The drive had NO information on polarity of the power supply pin, but another SimpleTech drive has Center Positive, so I set for that. </s>
<s> Also, a standard USB port only gives 5 watts. </s>
<s> I thought jumping to 7.5 watts was a BIG change, so I set the thing on 6 watts. </s>
<s> SimpleTech sends you that Y-shaped cable. </s>
<s> The bottom end connects to the drive, and the other branches into two. </s>
<s> When I used the FARTHEST one, the drive Didn't work. </s>
<s> When I used the closer one, the drive worked and I have stored a lot of stuff on it. </s>
<s> -that was today! </s>
<s> VAPCMD - That worked like a champ... Thx </s>

<s> Apparently the invisible USB drive is a very common problem. </s>
<s> On Windows XP Pro, I initially used Windows USB Troubleshooting. </s>
<s> Everything checked out in Device Manager, and the drive was visible under the USB branch. </s>
<s> Everything was listed as operating properly. </s>
<s> I repeatedly examoined and refreshed my list of drives, but nothing was listed for this external drive. </s>
<s> Called Simpletech support, and was routed through several levels of the phone queue, and was offered the support scenario of a drive which is invisible within My Computer. </s>
<s> The pre-recorded solution was said to be plugging just the cable into two USB ports on the back of the desktop, and then connecting the drive, which was supposed to appear after twenty or thirty seconds. </s>
<s> It didn't. </s>
<s> Began internet research, and found that many drives came to life after users noticed Unallocated Space under Device Manager - indicating that the drive had not been ready for use, and needed to be partitioned. </s>
<s> Yikes!!! </s>
<s> Mine was already full of data, so this would have been a very bad sign. </s>
<s> Checked under Device Manager for unallocated space, but noticed a SECOND listing for the Simpletech drive, not under USB devices, but under hard drives. </s>
<s> Under the properties Volumes, nothing was listed, so I clicked Populate, and found my drive listed as F-drive. </s>
<s> Voila! </s>
<s> But no, F-drive was not Simpletech, but a mapped network drive. </s>
<s> DRIVE CONFLICT! </s>
<s> I unmapped the network drive, and it came to life as Simpletech. </s>
<s> Although bus power works fine on my laptop, I could not get it to detect when I plugged it in with just usb to my vista desktop. </s>
<s> After stressing a little, I plugged in the power supply, and it worked perfect. </s>

<s> So I had a 500 GB Simpledrive for about two weeks, and had over 256 GBs worth of stuff put on it already, and deleted off my computer because that was slowing my computer down alot, and suddenly the drive was nowhere to be found. </s>
<s> My laptop couldn't find it, i read and did everything that didn't involve buying something on this forum, to no avail. </s>
