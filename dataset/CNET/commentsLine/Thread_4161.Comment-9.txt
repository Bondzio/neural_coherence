so i went to the link you provided and read about how to find what graphic resolutions the graphic adapter supports.
but because i have windows 7 (i think directions were for vista) it took me a little bit of time to find access to the list (under control panel, change display settings, advanced settings).
then i went to my monitor menu, and under advanced went to information.the monitor info reads &quot;1280 x 720 60 hz&quot;.
then i went back to supported graphics resolutions and switched it from where it was set, &quot;1280 x 720 true color (32 bit) 59 hz&quot; to the same but at 60hz.
instead of 59hz.
clicked apply and now i have full use of the screen.
one strange note.
when i first changed the setting from 59hz to 60hz i encountered a wavy screen problem.
so i went back into the supported resolutions list and tried a few of the other 1280 x 720 choices.
those did not solve the problem.
so i decided to go back to the above 60hz setting.
and for whatever reason the wavy screen problem was gone.
thank you for all your help
