Hi, I am for sure getting the E8500 core 2 duo CPU, and later planning on getting a Radeon 4890.
The CPU is very nice but I'm wondering if it would bottleneck the card at all and if so, to what degree.
I'm also planning on getting a new 750 watt PSU at the same time as the card and my current system also has 4 gigs (only 3.3 usable from vista 32 bit) of 667 RAM.
Any estimations would be appreciated, thanks in advance.
