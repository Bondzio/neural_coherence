Ati just has never been good for me in general its more of a preference to use nvidea.
Ive had many nvidea card and they all functioned perfectly for me.
The 4870 was my first ATI and its just missing something that I like from nvidea.
Ive been looking at the gtx 200 series but I really dont know what the prices will look like in a few months with the 300 series coming out
