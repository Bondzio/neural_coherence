I had something happen to my unit last night.
It will power up, (fans running, LEDs light up), but I get nothing to my monitor.
Thied it with two other monitors, nothing...
I've been in HP.com trying to find a new motherboard, but cannot locate an exact match; Micro-Star International, Gamila/Giovani/Neon series030.
Serial Number: 4811472490 Bios: Award Software 3.25 04/12/2005 HP Part Number : P8557-69002.
I got this number from the HP website, but they said - Not Available.
Any suggestions?
