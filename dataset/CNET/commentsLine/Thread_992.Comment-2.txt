if not, then i suspect something with the new internet explorer, (version 7), is breaking them.
however i use windows xp and both sites work with my ie7.
if they did work with your windows vista and with ie7 then there has been some change to your system that has broken ie7 for these sites.
does this happen only on these two sites or does it happen with other sites as well?
as a short term measure see if you can get access to these two sites with another browser.
internet explorer isn't the only type of browser we can use on windows and there are other good ones available.
mozilla has one called firefox at  .
it is compatible with windows vista and doesn't affect using ie for other sites if that is what you wish.
if firefox does not allow you to access these sites then i suspect some software is blocking your computer from accessing them.
do you have any anti-spyware software installed?
