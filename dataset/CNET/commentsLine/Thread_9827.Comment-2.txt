more than likely those systems used 30 simms ram as my 486dx4-100 unit took 78 simms ram.
i worked on a number of 486 units with the 30 simms ram (just threw out a whole slew of them two weeks ago, btw) and 8mb ran over $30 per stick and had to be purchased as edo/pairs by 1994. i don't know the original price in 1989, but assume it was much higher at that time because the 78 simms was priced about the same $30 by 1994. toni
