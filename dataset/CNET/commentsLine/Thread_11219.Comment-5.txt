what do you mean a backup?
i am not going to buy two external hardrives the put the same exact content in both of them, it would end up costing 300 bucks instead of 150 bucks, plus there is no guarantee that both won't die up eventually.
okay i get that external hardrives are not as reliable as external ssd's, but as i said when you know that an external ssd cost about 130 bucks for 64gb, it comes to the point where you don't really have much of a choice other than to buy the less reliable external hardrives.
anyway, that wasn't my question, i want to buy a new external hardrive (previous ones when i was still using windows xp where iomega presitge 500gb and iomega professional 1tb) now i am using windows 7 64 bits home edition and the company that i want to buy from sells either one type of external hardrive with external ac and cold aluminium case and another type is with an internal ac and internal cooling fans.
which is best?
and what are the differences really?
