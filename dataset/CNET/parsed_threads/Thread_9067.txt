<s> I'm considering buying a netbook that comes with Windows 7 Starter. </s>
<s> I checked Microsoft's &quot;check-list&quot; to compare Starter to Windows 7 Home Premium. </s>
<s> It seems to me Starter edition would simply eliminate much of the &quot;fluff&quot; and not much that would be really missed. </s>
<s> Can anybody say what reasons one may be disatisfied with Starter on a netbook? </s>
<s> Some folk have put one item or another on a stick to parade around that 7 Starter is garbage. </s>
<s> Things like the wallpaper. </s>
<s> Ok, let me share I pushed a little netbook to the edge and it did fine. </s>
<s> Here's what we setup. </s>
<s> It's advanced so here goes. </s>
<s> Visual Studio 2008 for Windows Mobile development. </s>
<s> We ran the debugger over USB &quot;plus&quot; we installed Mobiler for remote control. </s>
<s> No speed demon but what proof you can do a lot with Starter? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yes, when I searched this forum to see if my question had already been answered, I saw your posted test results. </s>
<s> I realize there's only so much performance you can expect in these little computers- that's understood. </s>
<s> But for normal usage that a netbook is intended for, my only concern is if there are important features left off Starter. </s>
<s> I don't consider Aero and &quot;shake&quot; important. </s>
<s> Some take the wallpaper item, put it on a stick to parade around as proof. </s>
<s> Here even BLUETOOTH works without any driver hunt. </s>
<s> I only have 2 adapters but they plug in and just work. </s>
<s> This is super nice. </s>
<s> --&gt;&gt; Another rant we see is the missed DVDRW drive. </s>
<s> But this is an optional item that you decide on. </s>
<s> ---&gt;&gt;&gt; And then we have the problem of how to restore the OS when folks or malware kills it. </s>
<s> You'll see rants about how they feel entitled to the DVDRW drive because you can't load the OS without one. </s>
<s> I don't know how to respond to those. </s>
<s> Ok, NORMAL USAGE. </s>
<s> A netbook is not a laptop and should never sub for one. </s>
<s> You might understand this if you used one for a few hours. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So I can assume Windows 7 Starter Edition isn't missing anything included in Home Premium that's very important? </s>
<s> As for a $300 netbook, it's performance limitations are obvious and should be accepted for what it is. </s>
<s> So how would you re-install the OS, if necessary? </s>
<s> Pretty simple. </s>
<s> I use the usual USB DVDRW drive and the restore media. </s>
<s> Some opt out then start a rant about it should be included because its required to restore the machine. </s>
<s> Again I don't handle that rant well. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> OK, I wasn't sure if you could boot from an external CD/DVD drive. </s>
<s> Didn't know if it would just show as a &quot;Removable Storage&quot; USB. </s>
<s> I think I'm all set. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
