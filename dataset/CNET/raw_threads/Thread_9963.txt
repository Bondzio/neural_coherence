I have a GeForce GTX670 video card and primarily play the Fallout series, Skyrim, the Batman games, NBA 2K13, but I am not into FPS. I really need help figuring out two things: 1.) Is TN worth it over the IPS considering the color production of the IPS? Or, is the fast response time of the TN the way to go? 2.) I am leaning towards a TN and have narrowed my choices down to two: &lt;div&gt;- Asus VG248QE &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;- BenQ XL2420T &lt;/div&gt; I am not totally set on either of the two monitors above, but haven't found anything else better. Finally, my price range is roughly $400 (willing to go higher if it is truly worth it). Thanks!

I do like IPS so while I may seek out that on display I would not buy sight unseen or pay double. RESPONSE TIME IS SOMETIMES OVER RATED. I'm sure by now you've done your homework and learned that this number is variable with temperature and for most systems the display is locked to the panel rate or 50 or 60Hz (depends on where in the universe you are.) So there is that new ultrawide rolling out but the demo I saw had more than 2,000 bucks of video cards driving it! Bob
