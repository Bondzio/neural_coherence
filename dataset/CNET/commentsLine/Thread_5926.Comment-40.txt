what does the boot screen show as the hard drive???
model, location et al.
i'm sure that you know that if you hit the &quot;pause&quot; button when the boot screen comes up you can read it at your leisure.
the lack of a floppy drive really limits any further troubleshooting to take a look at what is on the drive to find what may be the cause of the problem.
probably, two other things to try, get a floppy drive, or get/make a knoppix cd.
i'm not exactly certain how to use the knoppix for the situation that the hard drive is in, put it may always come in handy.
here's a link to it.
robert is somewhat an expert in its use.
i have no other ideas, except to check all connections over again.
but please keep us informed with any progress or whatever.
this is a very interesting case.
