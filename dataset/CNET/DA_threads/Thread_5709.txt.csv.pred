1.1.1	Hello , I was hoping someone here could recommend a quality WiFi router with a good track record that I could get on Ebay for under $ 20 .	St
1.1.2	I made the terrible mistake of buying a used D-Link DI-624 , which has turned out to be an epic piece of junk .	St
1.1.3	Thank you .	St
1.2.1	Have setup many 624 's but wo n't call them junk as they all work fine .	St
1.2.2	Maybe you did n't try the settings in our forum sticky ?	Ques
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Hi Bob , I checked the sticky which contains some pretty elementary basics for set-up .	St
1.3.2	My knowledge base is far beyond this .	St
1.3.3	I 've worked with other Wifi routers , even other D-Link routers and have never encountered problems like I am encountering with the DI-624 .	St
1.3.4	I bought it based on CNET 's recommendation .	St
1.3.5	There are a plethora of complaints about the DI-624 out there .	St
1.3.6	We all have the same problem .	St
1.3.7	The radio just drops out occasionally and we lose the connection .	St
1.3.8	I 'm curious to look into a Broadcom-based router so that I can install Tomato firmware .	St
1.3.9	Ryan	St
1.4.1	If you want to move to what I like and consider great stuff go get any router you can run DDWRT on .	St
1.4.2	Those are nice and what I use .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	can you give a simple explanation of what ddwrt is ( I did a web search and am still confused ) , and even though I know you do n't like to recommend a specific brand and model number , I 'd appreciate if someone would .	St
1.5.2	The 2 I 'm considering are the Linksys WRT546S or the NetGear WRG614 .	St
1.5.3	thanks , Janice	Polite
1.6.1	Being open source you have what may be thousands of programmers poking and fixing at it .	St
1.6.2	Dlink , Linksys do n't have that many working on it .	St
1.6.3	DDWRT is stable powerful router firmware .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	Bob , I know based on the published bandwidth capabilities of G band , I should n't have a problem - yet I was still wondering if a G Band router might choke if three computers were online at the same time on a 20 Mbit/s broadband connection .	St
1.7.2	I do n't want the router to get in the way of utilizing all 20 Mbits of bandwidth .	St
1.7.3	I 'm confused over Net bit rate of 54 Mbit 's vs. the throughput of 19 Mbit/s .	St
1.7.4	At which point does a G band router bottleneck and slow things down ?	Ques
1.7.5	Thanks .	Polite
1.8.1	You hear howls from that gamer about ping when the other user piles in .	St
1.8.2	It 's that simple .	St
1.8.3	Bob	St
1.9.1	I have no idea what you are talking about .	St
1.9.2	We 're not gamers .	St
1.9.3	I just wanted to know if a G band router could handle 3 users at one time on a 20Mbit/ sec cable connection - for general online use .	St
1.9.4	Thanks .	Polite
1.10.1	The sharing works almost as if you have the entire connection if you are getting email , loading a web site or such .	St
1.10.2	You can pile 100 users on a router and it works super since no one is demanding long demands on the connection .	St
1.10.3	Your email is fetched and that 's over .	St
1.10.4	The Web page loads and it 's over .	St
1.10.5	It 's sharing at its best .	St
1.10.6	However if someone starts downloading something big then you see the effect .	St
1.10.7	Bob	St
1.11.1	Thank you .	St
1.11.2	Assuming all users were downloading something at the same time - my cable bandwidth service tops out at 20 Mbit/sec - so would a 802.11g spec router split the bandwidth into 3 or give precedent to the user that started first ?	Ques
1.11.3	Assuming the router divides the bandwidth evenly , can a g band router handle 3 simultaneous 6 Mbit/sec transfers ?	Ques
1.12.1	The reason is deeply technical and you do n't get an exact division of the bandwidth .	St
1.12.2	It 's a long discussion of queuing theory , packet sizes and probability .	St
1.12.3	In the long run it may be 1/3 for each of the 3 users but you can safely bet it will not be exact .	St
1.12.4	And it has nothing to do with who started first .	St
1.12.5	Yes , it 's a fine thing to discuss in a class room but this small space would be overwhelmed if we truly dissected how it plays out in real life .	St
1.12.6	Can we go with almost 33 % for each user during long downloads ?	Ques
1.12.7	Bob	St
1.13.1	Okay .	St
1.13.2	Last thing I 'd like to know is if a g band router can handle 6 Mbits/sec from three separate computers at the same time - 18 Mbits total .	St
1.13.3	Is this what & quot ; throughput & quot ; means .	St
1.13.4	If so , g band can do 19 Mbit/sec ( per wiki ) - so the answer is yes ?	Ques
1.14.1	But since your internet connection is not 18 Mbits total and the wifi link is half duplex , all this becomes an exercise of how exact you insist the answer be and if we are talking about laboratory conditions and more .	St
1.14.2	Under ideal conditions , if the packet sizes are the same , if the response times are stable , the servers that are being fetched are responding on time , all things being perfect .	St
1.14.3	Remember I lived through the days of battle over the network protocol Asynchronous Transfer Mode ( ATM ) versus TCPIP and you are treading right into the argument for ATM .	St
1.14.4	Bob	St
1.15.1	Okay , I 'm clear now .	St
1.15.2	Thank you much !	St
