<s> i think that the ps3 cpu is bullcrap. </s>
<s> i believe that it DOES have 8 cores and uses 7 but rather there is ONE MAIN CORE and 6 others too help it a little. </s>
<s> it has crappy cacshe on its main core(512 kb) i dont know if all the cores put together make 4mb or not but in any case i think core 2 duo 2.6ghz+ is faster than cell. </s>
<s> i think that sony and IBM did this for marketing to make 8 CORES OMG OMG OMG its so powerfull seem true. </s>
<s> wat do u guys think? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> http://www.geekpatrol.ca/2006/11/playstation-3-performance/ Sorry, but it's not a desktop so maybe multiple cores is a great thing for gaming? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i got C2D OC 2.7 ghz, 2gb OC 800mhz ram, 7900 gtx wich i OCed and DEFINITELY if i get a phsx card </s>
<s> omg the ignorance... dude why do you think server farms are so powerfull ? </s>
<s> because there is power in numbers. </s>
<s> right now its not noticeable but when games are made to utilize all the cores at even 50 percent it will be such a leap from a single powerful core. </s>
<s> there wont b any load times because one core can be loading the next level, lighting and textures can all be split up. </s>
<s> Games are for the most part maxing out pc video cards and games for the ps3 are using maybe 10% of its true power. </s>
<s> using multiple cores is so much more efficient too. </s>
<s> the writers of games and programs at that matter just need to start writing stuff for multiple cores. </s>
<s> multiple cores are the future no doubt about it. </s>
<s> the cpu aint that fast. </s>
<s> im pretty sure that xbox 360 cpu is actuly a little faster. </s>
<s> i think that sony is misleading u. they made the statement wen intel core duo came out. </s>
<s> they said it was the fastest cpu, well it was then. </s>
<s> but then core TWO duo came out in about half a year. </s>
<s> im not a cultist trying to take down sony or anything but im tired of ppl sayin that ps3 is the best thing in performance in gaming in the world. </s>
<s> my gpu is faster, i have a 7900 gtx ps3=2 6800 GTs or 1 7900 &quot;&quot;GS&quot;&quot; and my gpu aint the best by far. </s>
<s> an 8800 would rip the rsx to shreds. </s>
<s> im not an expert in programing, or pc parts but im pretty sure ps3 aint the best gaming machinw in the world. </s>
<s> the whole &quot;8&quot; cores thingy is probably a marketing trick. </s>
<s> i know it has 8 cores but one is a backup core(wich means if one of the other 7 goes down i think its reduced to ONE core) and its one main core then 6 others to help it out a bit. </s>
<s> one may dish out the workload but thats pointless. </s>
<s> it may take only a 50mhz procssor to do that (ram cud do it) its not like a 19ghz pc its more like a 3.2ghz main core and 6 others to compensate for a crappy amount of ram. </s>
<s> onother thing is that sony doesnt want sum1 to hack its system so they might have done this for 2 reasons(marketing, and it would be very hard to put windows on it. </s>
<s> maybye linux but they cant do much about that) so its not the best </s>
<s> thanks for the link bob^_^ did u notice the performance from single thread and multithread???? </s>
<s> it was barely better. </s>
<s> so my speculations are looking tue. </s>
<s> 1.6 ghz sucks man i got 2.7 ghx so that would put it WAAAAY up on the scales. </s>
<s> if you get a quad core it would go even more, if you OCed the quad it would tear the scale up. </s>
<s> apple sux anyway for computers. </s>
<s> did u notice that apple makes like 80% of their income from ipods alone? </s>
<s> so i doubt the ps3 is the best gaming rig. </s>
<s> i saw ur some of your posts and u dont look like an expert so u probably looked online and read some of sony's descriptions about the ps3 im not an expert either but i think i know more than you. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> so what about the whole teraflop business </s>
<s> obviously this is a wierd cpu but core2&gt;overall from it. </s>
<s> prolly in games too core 2 doesnt even show teraflops on specs </s>
<s> p4 sux so much a 2ghz amd beats a 3.4 ghz p4 by alot from my expierence alone from my old pc and my moms she had ddr2 ram and i had ddr, one channel same amount but crappier. </s>
<s> thats ridiculouse man. </s>
<s> my cpu is prolly like twice as fast as the fasted p4. </s>
