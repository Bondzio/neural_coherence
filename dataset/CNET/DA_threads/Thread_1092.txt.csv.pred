1.1.1	Is the INTEL CORP system board model 7802W an EXACT replacement for DELL board model 4H665 or equal INCLUDING DELLs unique non standard ATX style PSU connection pin outs and the same DELL on board connectors?	St
1.1.2	reeltoreelguy@gmail.com	St
1.2.1	But you don't expect Dell's OEM OS to boot so with that out of the way, why stick with this board?	St
1.3.1	I am rebuilding this tower for someone else.	St
1.3.2	The DELL board is the 4H665.	St
1.3.3	It is used in the GX400 and precision330.	St
1.3.4	I have also used it in the dimension8100 as an upgrade.	St
1.3.5	Since INTEL made this board and others and can be used with any OS I figure this board will work as well as long as the non standard specs for DELL were used for this board as well.	St
1.3.6	This board number came up during a search for the 665.	St
1.3.7	The seller indicates it will work for the gx400.	St
1.3.8	But I am trying to find someone knowledgeable enough to verify this for me.	St
1.3.9	I will use the same DELL PSU.	St
1.3.10	If the connector pinouts are NOT DELLs than I will blow up the board.	St
1.3.11	Any help welcome.	St
1.3.12	The 665 uses a 1.7 P4, up to 1 gig memory, XP PRO, one 80 gig hhd, 24 plus 16 pin ATX board connectors, 16 pin power connector for the front panel button.	St
1.4.1	But this was all I could offer.	St
1.4.2	I can never warranty anything like this since it's not mine to cover.	St
1.4.3	It looks fine but you encounter folk that will want you to warranty the advice.	St
1.4.4	Not possible.	St
