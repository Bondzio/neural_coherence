I was wondering what type of video card I should look at. I am not a gamer, but I primarily use my PC for video editing and encoding (AVI - MPEG2 - DVD). I have had lots of overnight encoding sessions with my Dell, and I am ready for some speed. I am planning on going with an Athlon 64 3200+, and my mobo choice depends on what type of video card will work better for me. Thanks for your advice!

As for the motherboard specifically, well theres lot to choose from. Get what is right for you, try to balance price with features. ROger

Motherboards equiped with PCI Express sockets cost more. 16x PCI Express runs faster than 8X AGP only in theory. In the real world, AGP comes out faster almost every time. Graphic cards aren't nearly fast enough for AGP to become a bottleneck. PCI Express tends to be less efficient, and tasks the CPU more than AGP, especially when a big game is running, and the CPU is working at nearly 100%. Also, the last time I checked, the fastest graphics card aviliable is still AGP. It's not a matter of paying a lot more for a little bit of speed increase. By buying PCI Express, you'll be paying a lot more for a slower machine.

But then AGP 2x then 4x and 8x came along. We are at the same point now in the switch from AGP to PCIx. So at this point in time if I were to build a new PC I would still go with a good AGP card.

13347	4	108171	1233593	1233277	John Robie	6/9/05 11:01 AM	1.11831486E12	Agree John......	Right now there is hardly any game performance difference in AGP vs PCI-Express. I have not read anywhere that AGP is faster than PCI-E. PCI Express x16 (double x8) offers an increased bandwidth of 4GB. As always, when there is more bandwidth available, developers will find a way to put it to good use, driving the technology into the mainstream. It may take a little time until this will really show in any applications, especially games, but future 3D games and applications will continue to become more realistic and eventually will need more bandwidth. It can be noted that the latest motherboards being produced are looking to the furure producing PCI-Express X-16, x1, and x4 slots. Also ATI & Nvidia see the future and have shifted to PCI-E, but realize there is an awful lot of current AGP boards out there and don't want to miss out on the $'s so are producing AGP versions of their PCI-E cards. As someone at Tom's Hardware once said, &quot;It's a case of &quot;If you build it, they will come!&quot; Something like finally Intel announced in February their shift to 64-bit (EM64T). The 5xx series Processors are being replaced with the 6xx series and 8xx (dual core) that contain EM64T. There is not a lot of applications currently available for 64-bit, but it will be the wave for the future and even games will be forthcoming with 64-bit and dual core applications, re Intels announcement: http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20050308net.htm?iid=search& It should also be noted that companies like Dell, HP, etc... are now producing computers with the 6xx series (EM64T & PCI-Express), and as soon as they sell out of the 5xx series, then EM64T, PCI-E, and of course Dual Core will be the computers sold for Intel.

Does anyone's computer even has 4GB of memory? O_o PCI Express is more complex and creates more overhead. Identical GPUs will always run faster on AGP than PCI Express. GPUs nowdays are nowhere nearly fast enough for AGP to become a bottleneck, and they won't for the near future. Also, they're putting more and more onboard graphics memory. This reduces load on the bus, as the GPU don't have to access the main memory bank as much. It delays that date even further. Chances are, by the time PCI Express actually becomes useful, your computer would be obsolete anyway. Last time I checked, the fastest graphics card is still AGP. If you look at the present, using PCI Express is the same as paying more for a slower computer.

Please read my post...it is about the future. Didn't I indicate AGP & PCIe are currently about the same in performance. Please provide a link that shows what you say..re: &quot;Identical GPUs will always run faster on AGP than PCI Express&quot;. I guess some people just cannot bear a change or that PCI-e is currently taking over in motherboards and video cards......

As I said I am not a gamer, so I don't need the top of the line card. I was looking at this card: ATI ALL-IN-WONDER Radeon 9600XT 128MB 128-bit DDR VIVO AGP 4X/8X Video Card - Retail . Newegg ~ $189 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814102352 I like the TV Tuner aspect, and since my primary purpose is video editing, being able to hook up my VCR/Video Camera directly is a big plus. The price is about as much as I want to spend. What do you think?

13347	11	108171	1234523	1234441	dagger906	6/9/05 9:33 PM	1.11835278E12	Definately too expensive...	That's definately too expensive... ^_^ As I said, it'll be a long while before AGP becomes a bottleneck. Definately not in the next few years. The thing is, by the time graphics cards reaches that speed, and PCI Express becomes the standard, the rest of your PC would be obsolete anyway. PCI Express is definately faster, a lot faster. It's just this extra bandwidth does not make a difference today. I'm not talking about 10 years from now. Today, here and now, PCI Express gives you no advantage in speed whatsoever. PCI Express also creates more overhead, which actually lowers speed, especially with chipsets designed for AGP, which is the overwhelming majority of GPUs today. You'll be paying extra for not speed gain, and in most cases, net loss in speed.

13347	14	108171	1234605	1234523	damasta55r	6/9/05 10:57 PM	1.11835782E12	RE:	Definitely will be in the next year or two. Soon, ati and nvidia will stop porting their high-end cards to agp. So basically expect the 6800 ultra to be the last agp card... The manufacturers won't stop providing agp cards, but don't expect new models, but models avilable now. Like the 9200se, nvidia 5200, etc. AGP cards will soon be stuck in time.

They made the same assumption about PCI Express a year ago, and you know how that turned out. Of course PCI Express is faster, no arguements there. There is no way such things will happen in the next one or two years. Graphics cards cant become fast enough for AGP to be a bottleneck during that time. I's say 3 years at least, during which your PC built today will be obsolete in any case. You have to think about the need for a new bus. As long as AGP is not a bottlneck, the need for PCI Express does not exist. Getting PCI Express now will mean paying extra for no benefits. Also, they've been saying the same thing about 64 bit applications for a long time. Today, there are no 64 bit applications, because there is no need for it.

These don't offer any significant advantages anyway. It'll be a long time before 64 bit replaces normal as standard. By then, a computer you build today would be obsolete anyway.

13347	19	108171	1238551	1238539	dagger906	6/11/05 11:57 PM	1.11853422E12	That's just it...	There is no significant difference between normal Far Cry and 64 big Far Cry. It's just an adaption for the existing software which offer no real benefits of 64 bit. I wouldn't consider these real 64 bit software. 64 bit windows has been around for a while. They said that 64 bit would take over immediately after the news breaks out. That hasn't happened. Look at the old pattern here. People are always eager to jump on new technologies. Eventually times do change, just not as soon as you would think. Right now, it makes no sense to pay a lot more for no benefits.
