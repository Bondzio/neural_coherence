seriously if you are young, then don't mess with it.
if you can work full time then go get a job, save $800 have someone who isnt a noob help you spend $600 on new parts and keep the other $200 for repairs if you botch the job.
you will learn a lot more and the 1.1ghz box.
if i had it, i would scrap the ram buy 1 stick of 512mb of the fastest soppourted, install open32 xp on it, a stripped down auto installing, zero config xp that installs to a meager 900mb.
then i would install a torrent downloading program, tight vnc and of course, folding at home.
then i share the hard drives on my network, make it fold and download and could be accessed by any computer with vnc installed.
i wouldn't bother with a keyboard or mouse.
thats what i did to my 500mhz celeron pos with 2x20gb hard drives and a 10gb hard drive.
