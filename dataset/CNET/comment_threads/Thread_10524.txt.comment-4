XP, Windows 2000, Linux all have pretty good disk cache systems.
If I look at my system, it's 283 megabytes of disk cache which the difference of that 2, 8 or 16 MB on the disk drive would not make much difference.
www.tomshardware.com may have some benchmarks if you want to look further.
The RPMs seem to be what you can't skimp on.
