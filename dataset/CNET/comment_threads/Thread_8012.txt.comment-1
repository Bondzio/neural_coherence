hi y'all.
My next upgrade will pretty much include the works, but my hard drive is fine, currently running full retail win7.
Will MS let me use current OS if I get a new MOBO/CPU (and SSD)?
I plan to simply migrate the old HDD to my upgraded rig.
Or will MS force me to buy new retail OS?
In advance, thanks for the advice.
