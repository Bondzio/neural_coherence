hey guys i just wanted to see if anyone could help me make a new computer config using newegg.com or tigerdirect.com.
i was just going to get one off of a website or something but i really think building one would be fun and make the system hold a sense of ownership.
all i really need is a setup that would work with the cpu and gpus i want i just dont know what else i would need like right size case, cables, and or other stuff like that.
pretty much i need everthing else to house a amd 4000+ cpu and two oced nvidia 7800 gt graphic cards and a 600watt sli rdy power supply.
this is what i got so far off tigerdirect for bout a grand &gt;amd athlon 64 4000+ / 1mb cache / 2000mhz fsb / socket 939 / san diego core / processor with fan &gt;two (2) xfx geforce 7800 gt overclocked 256mb ddr3 pci express video cards and an ultra x-finity 600 watt power supply (comes with 600 power supply) i havnt done this before and im only looking to spend about 1600+ but if there is a way to keep the price down i would like to have a fx53 cpu:) and no dual core stuff plz i know it rocks and i will upgrade later when every game is dual cored thanks
