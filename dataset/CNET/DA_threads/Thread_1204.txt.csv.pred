1.1.1	I am looking to upgrade my wireless network from a netgear mimo range max to the new n. I think I have it narrowed down to the NETGEAR WNDR3700 or the DLink DIR-825 .	St
1.1.2	I really like the ability to set up a guest access point along with the more secure home network .	St
1.1.3	Another issue is the space where it will sit .	St
1.1.4	Standing up on edge it the most preferred setup .	St
1.1.5	I am looking for speed , range and stability .	St
1.1.6	I already have a set up for multiple drive on the network , and the printer is wireless so the usb port and network sharing on the router is not a major concern .	St
1.1.7	Also was looking to upgrade the usb pc wireless adapter for the main pc to maximize the benefits .	St
1.2.1	You most likely will see little if any difference between what you have and these newer routers as far as internet surfing go .	St
1.2.2	Your bottleneck is your internet connection and G and N both far exceed any consumer internet .	St
1.2.3	Next you will need to upgrade all your equipment to N to really get the advantages .	St
1.2.4	If you have a single device running G it will slow everything else down to G. Now both the routers you mentioned have 2 radios so you could run G on one and N on the other .	St
1.2.5	This assumes that you can run you N on the 5G band and leave the G on the 2.4G There is not a lot of difference between these routers mostly which software feature you like more .	St
1.2.6	Both are limited by FCC regulations so they will have similar strength so speed/range should be about the same .	St
1.2.7	The only difference I could see is that if you have signal strength issues is that the D-link let you put different antenna on it but you only do that when you have coverage problems .	St
1.2.8	The USB for the PC is similar issues but they make dual band verison of these too .	St
1.2.9	I would get one that has a long USB cable or buy a USB extension cable so you can place it on top of the PC .	St
1.2.10	The PC case itself tends to block signal if you are not careful	St
1.3.1	SO is there a reason to upgrade to an N ?	Ques
1.3.2	I was having connectivity issue with wife 's laptop but have discovered if I disable the wireless network and use an usb adapter it seems fine .	St
1.3.3	I do have some signal strength issues which is why I was looking at upgrading .	St
1.3.4	What would anyone suggest ?	Ques
1.4.1	I think as you found out the issue is on the PC side .	St
1.4.2	Generally the internal cards on a laptop are not your best bet since they are a compromise .	St
1.4.3	They are nice and built in and save battery by running at low power .	St
1.4.4	I like the cards put out by ALFA .	St
1.4.5	Many models have external antenna that you can change as well as the ability to transmit up to the legal maximum power levels .	St
1.4.6	These are best used when you have a power source since they eat your battery when you turn the power up .	St
1.4.7	If you are going to buy stuff always buy N since they all support G also .	St
1.4.8	There is little difference in the price and someday you may be able to convert to N without replacing stuff again .	St
1.4.9	The key difference between N and G is that N is more tolerant of interference which sometimes give better coverage but both are limited by the same rules as far as transmit power goes so basic signal strength is the same .	St
