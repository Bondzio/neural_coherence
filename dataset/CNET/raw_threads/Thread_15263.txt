Is there any way to fix the file system without formatting it so I can possibly save the data I had on it? I'm running Windows 2000 Pro with Service Pack 4. The drive is not the system drive for the computer.

Here's a link to the usual software: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=file+recovery+pro&btnG=Google+Search Bob

When a drive all of a sudden needs formatting again there is usually something wrong with it, physically. What actually happened that led up to this, what told you it needed formatting, EXACTLY what did you see?
