<s> I recently bought an HP Pavilion a1310n desktop pc. </s>
<s> When I place a DVD movie in my computer I get the message &quot;No Windows 2000 compatible DVD decoder installed on this system.&quot; I like Windows 2000 and dislike Windows XP, so I had wiped XP off the system and installed 2000. </s>
<s> For the most part it went well, though there are three drivers I am still trying to track down and install. </s>
<s> How can I find out what DVD decoder needs to be installed on this system? </s>
<s> Any ideas on where I can find it? </s>
<s> I very much appreciate any help. </s>
<s> Just in case you may be a real wizard, the three drivers that are missing are listed as: 1) Multimedia Audio Controller - Location PCI Bus 0, device 20, function 5 2) PCI Device - Location PCI Bus 0, device 20, function 0 3) Unknown device - On Microsoft ACPI - Compliant System. </s>
<s> How on earth do you find a driver for an unknown device, or find out what the unknown device is?? </s>
<s> HELP!!! </s>
<s> Shouldn't people be able to place any operating system on their computer they want without the computer being proprietary to a particular operating system? </s>
<s> You'll find your software DVD player with a name such as WinDVD, PowerDVD or other. </s>
<s> Since I don't have your XP CDs I can only share that I have yet to see if there is a way to retrieve it from such. </s>
<s> Each DVD drive has a decoder supplied by the DVD drive maker or motherboard maker that is specific to that drive or mobo. </s>
<s> I had the same issue on Win 2000; try downloading POWERDVD (trial) which has a software decoder built in rather than having to buy a $15 or $30 decoder for Windows Media Player and other software.. if you can't install the original motherboard and system drivers (which you CAN'T because HP doesn't support that on your Pavilion) I know that because I have the HP A1250n, the same family. </s>
<s> HP only supports the Media Center Edition they supply, and no other drivers. </s>
<s> Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 MAY recognize that &quot;Multimedia Controller&quot; (your onboard sound). </s>
<s> If not it may not be supportable on 2000. </s>
<s> If not, search for AC97 generic codecs/driver for Windows 2000. </s>
<s> You will also probably not get USB 2.0 speeds from your PC, Win 2000 doesn't support it AFAIK. </s>
<s> XP didn't until SP1. </s>
<s> &quot; Each DVD drive has a decoder supplied by the DVD drive maker or motherboard maker that is specific to that drive or mobo. </s>
<s> &quot; How did GEEXBOX make theirs? </s>
<s> If what you write is true, they would have thousands of versions. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> More like specific OS versions (Win XP, Win 2K..) It is like Nvidia's PureVideo DVD decoder. </s>
<s> Most PC's have it built in to decode DVD's, but a bare reinstall needs one. </s>
<s> A good player that doesn't require it is VideoLAN. </s>
<s> Here is an old ATI decoder that should work with Radeon X200.. http://drivers.soft32.com/driver/download-ATI_DVD_Decoder-24075.html </s>
