1.1.1	From 2005 to recently I used a Powerbook G4 ( it still works ) ; recently have bought a MacBook Air .	St
1.1.2	With the Powerbook my habit was to rarely turn the computer off ; I just put it to sleep .	St
1.1.3	In the last year that I used it , the computer would sometimes go to sleep , sometimes literally between keystrokes , and I would be unable to wake it , had to pull the battery , unplug the power cord , and then hit the power button to turn it off , then could turn it back on again .	St
1.1.4	Occasionally it would go to sleep while it was powering up .	St
1.1.5	The problem most often occurred when I was using the computer at close to its limits with respect to ambient air temperature , that is , it was in the 90s or 50s F. Is there any connection between continually using sleep mode instead of turning the computer off and problems with sleep ?	Ques
1.2.1	it was dying or some part of the OS was corrupted which resulted in the machine developing narcolepsy .	St
1.2.2	Although you did not actually define 'sleep ' can we assume that it just froze in the middle of what it was doing or did it go black and quiet ?	Ques
1.2.3	I do n't believe there is a connection between using the Sleep function and not turning off the computer P	St
1.3.1	No , it did not just freeze ; it went black and quiet and the sleep indicator ( the Powerbook had a light on the front of it that cycled up and down in brightness , sort of like a lighthouse seen from a distance , when it was asleep ) came on .	St
1.3.2	I failed to mention that sometimes I was able to wake it from these sleeps by hitting keys continuously for anything from a few seconds to a few minutes , but all too often it just would not wake up , and then I would power it off as I described above and then power it up again .	St
1.3.3	Thanks for the answer .	St
