<s> i bought a t23 2647 laptop a while ago. </s>
<s> everything worked perfectly untill i found out that i had no graphics card. </s>
<s> i used the dxdiag run program to search for my device and there it said &quot;N/A&quot; i looked around my C drive for a bit and i found ATI and S3 Savage drivers in my video drivers folder.... could it be that it doesnt recognize my device? </s>
<s> or did the guy who sold it to me take it out before he sold it to me? </s>
<s> i dont really wanna take appart my laptop but if anyone has instructions in how to do so i would unwilling look for my graphics card </s>
<s> At least 99.99% of them. </s>
<s> The graphics &quot;chips&quot; are on the mainboard to save space. </s>
<s> You found your video chipset so what is the next issue? </s>
<s> I wonder if you are looking for the video driver (you didn't tell.) </s>
<s> If so, it's at ibm.com or lenovo.com Bob </s>
<s> ATI: http://ati.amd.com/support/driver.html S3: http://www.s3graphics.com/en/resources/drivers/ This thread untracked </s>
<s> that laptop uses s3 savage graphic chip and i don't think it has any dx8/9 capabilities. </s>
<s> thus, from dxdiag's standpoint, the laptop has no graphics card. </s>
