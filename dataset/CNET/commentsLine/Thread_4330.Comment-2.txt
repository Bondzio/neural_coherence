imho, you really don't need two dvd drives installed.
unless you plan to do alot of copying and even then it maybe too slow.
its actually better to use a hd and dvd in such cases.
also, the power burden of a dvd drive that does nothing until needed is just that a burden.
save it as a spare.
as for the hd itself, mount the old hd and use either master/slave setup or cs.
if sata type then mount in next available port.
after bootup, goto &quot;disk management&quot; and format the old hd.
be 100% sure you are addressing the old hd and proceed.
here's the ms link on the topic:  once done the prepared hd is now ready for data.
all previous data is gone and effectively you have a blank hd, recognized by the system as letter, &quot;?&quot;.
gain, while 80gb may seem alot, it too places power burden.
i mention this as most oem type systems tend to be power deficient until proven so.
a new 500gb hd on sale are available at $99 or less if you want alot extra storage.
