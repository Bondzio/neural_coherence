However, replacing the fan maybe 1/2 of the problem as prolonged operation of an intermit fan causes &quot;stress&quot; on the p/s componets and there's a 50/50 chance it will fail entirely. While, the replacing the fan makes sense, replacing the p/s is a more practical solution besides a new p/s plus the included fan, you have a chance to increase the wattage of p/s if available. The choice is yours. The fan size is usually 80 or 90mm in size or 3-4in.. good luck -----Willy
