so my family is getting a new computer for christmas, and i can do anything i want with the old computer.
so i've decided to turn it into a media center/ torrent tivo.
mainly for just watching videos, listening to some music once and while, etc.
the computer is an hp pavilion a320n.
its has 2.98 ghz amd athalon processor, 512 megs of ram, and 120 gig hardrive, windows xp home edition.
i have 512 megs of ram, so i'm going to upgrade it to 1g, should that be enough?
i don't plan on using it record live tv or anything that intense.
i also need to upgrade to video card so i have tv out put.
which card would be a good deal?
i don't want to spend alot, between 30 and 50 bucks is kind of my range.
should i opt for a card with a tv tuner instead?
the hardrive is 120 gigs.
i don't plan on stooring my movie collection on it really.
more like torrenting my favorite shows i miss and then wathcing, and once wathced delete them.
so should 120 gig hardrive be big enough?
as for media center software, i've been looking at media poral.
i don't want to spend the money to get ms media center.
are any other free suggestion for media center type software?
thats about it, have i covered all my bases for a basic media center/ torrent tivo device.
i'm going to upgrade my ram, and get a video card with tv output.
don't think i need a bigger hardrive.
anything else you all would upgrade.
