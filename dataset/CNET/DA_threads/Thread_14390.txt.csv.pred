1.1.1	The motherboard in my computer is Asus A7N8X-X with 3 memory slots , and it can be installed up to 3GB DDR 400Mhz ( PC3200 ) of RAM memory .	St
1.1.2	However , it exists also a single module of 2GB DDR 400Mhz ( PC3200 ) of RAM memory.My question is can I install ( 3 x2GB ) 6 GB of RAM memory ?	Ques
1.1.3	I know that on motherboard description says up to 3Gb , but I suppose that it is possible , that this 2GB module entered the production after the motherboard .	St
1.1.4	So , can anyone help me with this question ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	First if your manual says 3gig , that 's probably correct .	St
1.2.2	Beyond that if you have a 32bit operating system ( which is more than likely ) you would be wasting money as it ca n't use more than 3-3.5gig depending on your hardware .	St
1.2.3	If you are running XP 32bit 2 gig is plenty , just because you have 3 slots does n't mean they have be full .	St
1.3.1	Go with the system specs ... not what you 'think ' will fit .	St

1.4.1	'Hvala puno ' anmor i VAPCMD.That means 'Thank you very much ' in my language : ) .	St
1.4.2	Anyway , I wanted to improve my RAM memory because I want to install Windows Vista.Curruntly my operating system is Windows XP and I have 512MB of RAM memory installed.How much would be enough for Vista ?	Ques
1.4.3	Just one question more : ) Can I expect any problems if I install the same memory ( DDR 400 Mhz ( PC3200 ) , but from a different manufacturer.My RAM memory is manufactured by Kingston .	St
1.4.4	Well , Hvala puno , for the second time : )	St
1.5.1	to run Vista comfortably , if you do a lot of video edditing or other memory intensive programs go to 3 .	St
1.5.2	I suspect that is not the case with you as you have been getting along on 512mb .	St
1.5.3	Best to buy 2 gig of quality ram which is suitable for your computer , then trying to get more and cheaper .	St
1.5.4	I would get 2 x 1gb to match what is recomended , you should be able to still use your current module giving you 2.5gb which will be more than enough .	St
1.6.1	mfg and series wherever possible .	St
1.6.2	That 's why it 's always best to get the MAX amount RAM you anticipate to need when you buy the PC ... . it 's so much easier to get it then than trying to match the original RAM later .	St
1.6.3	Cheers and You 're most welcome .	St
