I was following this guide : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTQoH-j5KZY and the links it provides, and I'm currently looking at a gts 450 or a radeon HD 5770. Can anyone tell me if my current power supply could handle it? Also, any other better alternatives would be great too.

While I did fit a GT240 on some HP d4999t with that size I used a Watt meter to measure before and after to see the total load was 1/2 of the PSU rating. I don't suggest that for those without Watt meters and a good grasp of why we derate. Bob
