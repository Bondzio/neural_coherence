<s> I am trying to understand about IP addresses. </s>
<s> My understanding is that everyone has one if you are on the internet. </s>
<s> If I run Belarc advisor, it reports these IP addresses: 1394 Net Adapter NVIDIA nForce Networking Controller primary Auto IP Address: 192.168.1.102 / 24 </s>
<s> It appears you did this from your PC behind your router. </s>
<s> Unless you pay for it you will only get a single IP from your ISP. </s>
<s> That is your 71.56.46.184 address. </s>
<s> Since there is only 1 ip address the device you plug into the modem or other device the ISP uses gets this IP. </s>
<s> If you run without a router your PC will directly get the ip. </s>
<s> When you use a router the router pretends all the machines at your location come from the same address. </s>
<s> In effect your machine has 2 addresses. </s>
<s> The 192.168.1.102 is your &quot;fake&quot; address. </s>
<s> These are actually called private addresses and are used to reduce the actual number of ip used. </s>
<s> bill102 said thoroughly just about all there is to be said. </s>
<s> But not that I'm adding to the topic at hand; I would take that private information off the web. </s>
<s> It may open you up to spam or other personal privacy invasion. </s>
<s> Just a little warning. </s>
