1.1.1	I have not used Seagate Hard Drives for a long time so do n't know if this is normal .	St
1.1.2	It makes a lot of noise the the Western Digital drives do n't .	St
1.1.3	This started when I had 3 BSOD in one day and as soon as it would re-boot , it would go right into CHKDSK .	St
1.1.4	The computer is still under warranty so I called Dell and after some trouble shooting steps it was determined the hard drive is going bad .	St
1.1.5	The tech came out the next day and installed a new Seagate hard drive , that 's the one making noise that sounds like someone tapping on the bottom of a aluminium can with a pencil or stick .	St
1.1.6	Not real load , but very anoying .	St
1.1.7	Turns out the drive was sent with the wrong image and they have to send another hard drive to replace this one .	St
1.1.8	The tech will be here tomorrow and I have no idea what brand hard drive it will be .	St
1.1.9	Is this noise normal with the Seagate drives or was I just very unlucky ?	Ques
1.1.10	Thanks Wayne	St
1.2.1	The tech was a day early and installed the drive today .	St
1.2.2	It was another Seagate drive and this one you ca n't hear at all , so the first one must have been bad .	St
1.2.3	One bonus is the first drive was a 640 gig and the new one is a 1 Terabyte drive .	St
1.3.1	To me it sounds like some harmonic being created and emanating from the cover .	St
1.3.2	You said a pencil tapping on a can .	St
1.3.3	The covers on newer drives can be very thin and made to flex easily .	St
1.3.4	That could be just the way it sounds when the heads move and the vibration is picked up by the cover .	St
1.3.5	Putting some foam tape on it might have reduced the noise .	St
1.3.6	Of course the 1TB drive will be a different model and could be made differently .	St
1.3.7	As long as you 're happy with it , that 's fine but do n't think that all drive noise is an omen of impending doom .	St
1.4.1	The 1 terabyte drive has been working great and still no noise .	St
1.4.2	One thing is it appears the bigger drive is actaully faster than the 640 .	St
1.4.3	I thought it would be just the opposite .	St
1.4.4	This is not only the seak time , but also boot up and shut down .	St
