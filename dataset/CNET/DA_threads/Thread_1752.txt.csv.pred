1.1.1	I have a Lan-Plus laptop with an AMD Athlon XP-1600+ 1.39 GHz processor & 112 MB of RAM that's about 3 yrs.	St
1.1.2	old.	St
1.1.3	I purchased a wireless router & a wireless cardbus adapter.	St
1.1.4	However, I didn't realize my laptop doesn't have a cardbus slot.	St
1.1.5	My manual says it has a Infrared Data Port that allows it to be wireless.	St
1.1.6	What does that mean???	St
1.1.7	My device manager shows under network adapters a 1394 Net adapter & a SiS 900-Based PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter.	St
1.1.8	Under Infrared devices it shows a Winbond Fast Infrared Controller (DMA).	St
1.1.9	I have no idea what those are or what I need to do.	St
1.1.10	All I want to do is surf the internet using my Road Runner!	St
1.1.11	Can I do this?	St
1.1.12	If so, what do I have to do?	Ques
1.1.13	Any help is greatly appreciated!	St
1.1.14	!	St
1.2.1	Just kidding I'm not familiar with infrared things, but I know that if you get online with that you will have a sloppy speed if at all.	St
1.2.2	Plus, security might be an issue for you.	St
1.2.3	assuming that you have USB 2.0 capabilities on your laptop, you could try getting the 54mbps wireless 2.0 adapter( http://www.netgear.com/products/details/WG111.php ) without parenthesis.	St
1.2.4	If you don't have USB 2.0 capibilities then probably your connection will be slower since USB 1.1 is 40x slower than 2.0.	St
1.2.5	If you have a free USB port then you are all set.	St
1.2.6	good luck and next time make sure you give people a really detailed computer spec.	Polite
1.2.7	sincerely; Aneudys	St
1.3.1	have in mind that wireless devices working together from a same manufacturer work better than two devices that are not.	St
1.3.2	eg USB adapter by netgear will work better with a router made by netgear.	St
1.4.1	I purchased the D-Link Router & Cardbus Adapter at the recommendation of a couple of different people, particularly because it's XBOX compatible for my sons.	St
1.4.2	But it sounds like it doesn't matter since I have such an ''antique'', which is what I was afraid of anyway.	St
1.5.1	Yes I do have 2.0 USB ports.	St
1.5.2	I guess extra info.	St
1.5.3	is better than not enough - sorry!	St
1.5.4	I'd love to dump it but I just bought my desktop a few months ago.	St
1.5.5	A P4, 3.4 ghz.	St
1.5.6	that flies compared to the laptop but I figured it would make a good backup when someone's on the desktop.	St
1.5.7	We also go camping & it comes in handy when trying to map your next stop when traveling.	St
1.5.8	But I see a new one possibly from Santa so I hate to spend a ton on $ on a card so your suggestion maybe the answer.	St
1.5.9	Thanks!	St
1.5.10	!	St
1.6.1	try getting a USB adapter that is made by D-link since it will work better with your router and make sure to set the wireless channel for the router on any of this 3 channels-11, 6, 1, -the others channels will be overlapping with microwaves and cordless phones and cellphones	St
1.7.1	Thanks for your suggestions - I'll give it a try!	St
