1.1.1	It did n't come with any standoffs .	St
1.1.2	My old PC case standoffs raise the motherboard too high to fit correctly .	St
1.1.3	The new case has the screw holes raised away from the case .	St
1.1.4	Does this mean I do not need standoffs ?	Ques
1.1.5	If you need to see a pic to be sure let me know .	St
1.1.6	New Case http : //i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll46/ryudragon23/DSC05803-1.jpg Old Case http : //i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll46/ryudragon23/DSC05804-1.jpg	St
1.2.1	Yes I would think that is true .	Res
1.2.2	But just double check to be sure none of them touch the board where they should n't .	Sug
1.2.3	If so happen that it does touch then I probably use electrical tape or plastic washer to insulated it .	St
1.2.4	Good luck .	Polite
1.3.1	The case appears to offer metal standoffs as part of its make-up .	St
1.3.2	These are screw down , hold it place areas/posts .	St
1.3.3	But , if this does n't match what is required for the mtrbd .	St
1.3.4	as in the mounting areas are off , though these standoffs are there only to prevent moving of the mtrbd .	St
1.3.5	and proper grounding .	St
1.3.6	If other stand-offs are required then the h/w is either missing or was n't include .	St
1.3.7	There is nothing to keep you from returning the case as its incomplete .	St
1.3.8	usually some plastic stand=offs are needed to keep the mtrbd .	St
1.3.9	flexing to touch the metal casing .	St
1.3.10	Though , when short of some items like this or seemingly lacking a good fit or match , I use foam to help separate metal and mtrbd.. You have to use your judgment of this as the picture while helpful is n't showing just how the mtrbd .	St
1.3.11	would fit .	Res
1.3.12	A local source of a computer should have h/w kits or spare posts to buy .	St
1.3.13	also , online vendors offer such items , google for them if you want to keep the case and standoffs are needed for best install .	St
1.3.14	tada -- -- -Willy	St
