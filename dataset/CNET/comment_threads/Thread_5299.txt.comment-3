The only PCI-Express Video cards available for under $100 is the ATI X300,Nvidia 6200, and FX5790, which are really junk, i know this because i have the X300 and am currently planning to upgrade to the Nvidia 6800GT.
Beware, the majority of Nvida 6200 share memory with the system, so they are not so good.
If you are not playing any games, i suggest you at least get the X800XL, which runs for $300-400.
Not many PCI-EXPRESS cards are that cheap.
