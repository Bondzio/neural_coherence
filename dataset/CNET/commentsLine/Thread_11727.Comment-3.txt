i downloaded and tried both of those (and a few others on the net) the problem seems to be the drive itself isn't being detected, so no matter what program i use i dont have a drive to see and choose in these programs even when its hooked up direct sata and power to pc or via sata cord via usb, the drive just never &quot;appears&quot; as viewable etc.
i did go thru the bios saw nothing to really adjust for drive detection, any drive i ever put on here shows in the bios (even usb thumb drives) just not this drive that failed on me.
thought that freezer thing might work for me but seems my problem is more basic (getting the drive to even show up), altho it does spin up and has no weird clunks or anything, just cant seem to get anything to &quot;see&quot; the drive so i can attempt to view or recover from it.
gonna send it in at the end of this week but man i wish i could figure a way out to get to the content before it goes.
