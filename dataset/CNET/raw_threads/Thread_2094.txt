I have a motorola/netopia 3347-02 wireless router in the house currently as well as a Belkin f5d9231-4. Is this possible or am i dreaming? any guidence would be appreciated.

Place the webcam connected to the netbook connected to the router in a house near a window. Start up the webcam. When you want to view the webcam do a Remote Desktop Connection/Protocol (RDP) to the netbook and view it from there. This is if it's wireless-N. (Check specs to make sure you can connect wirelessly 400ft with wifi-n. I'm not 100% sure you can.)
