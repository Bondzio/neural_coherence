speakers behaving like that can be caused by one of two things: a faulty audio cable or a faulty line-in jack if its the former try using a different cable or swapping speakers.
if its the latter, you've hit a dead-end.
you either replace the card or take it to service.
sorry but there's no user servicable part on an audio card.
