after making a backup, store it in a safe place, preferably off-site.
send your dvd backup to a relative, or keep it in a safe-deposit box at your bank.
this will keep it safe from fire or theft.
i would also reccomend getting a safe, for your backups and important papers.
be sure to bolt it to the floor, and do not have the combination written down anywhere near the safe.
a decent-sized safe can be bought at walmart for 100$, and weighs 100 pounds.
the walmart safe is mainly for protection against fire, but is also reasonably safe against burglars.
