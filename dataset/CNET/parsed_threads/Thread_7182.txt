<s> Okay, I've been out of the computer world for a while and don't consider myself knowledgeable enough anymore to make these decisions on parts. </s>
<s> I'd like to make the best gaming desktop or laptop computer possibly using only about $1,000. </s>
<s> While I prefer a laptop, a desktop is also acceptable. </s>
<s> Now, I'm not a hardcore gamer, I just want to get into computer gaming. </s>
<s> Maybe a little World of Warcraft, some Star Wars, and a few other games. </s>
<s> I'm also always downloading programs (though I am carefule) and busy making presentations and reports, so it's important to have a good processor and sufficient memory. </s>
<s> I can't make it myself, but I'd happily buy my parts and pay to have it put together than pay the same price for a not-as-good computer which I will not like. </s>
<s> It should include DVD and CD burners and readers, and other ports for memory cards (Pro DUO), and USB. </s>
<s> As for operating system, I've heard nothing but bad reviews in regards to Vista. </s>
<s> I'm aware of Linux but have never used it and would not like it to interfere with games. </s>
<s> I feel like I've spoken to much. </s>
<s> Are there some build suggestions? </s>
<s> Any help is very much appreciated. </s>
<s> they don't have the graphics horsepower. </s>
<s> they'll be able to handle old games (2005 or earlier) or world of warcraft at moderate settings. </s>
<s> see this post for a $1000 gamer that can handle new games: http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7586_102-0.html?forumID=68&threadID=274616&messageID=2646997 </s>
<s> Are there any more suggestions? </s>
<s> I'm still not completely sure about switching to Vista, and if so, 32-bit or 64-bit? </s>
