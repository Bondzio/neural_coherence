Now this is the Computer how it was http://www.emachines.com/products/images/emachines_t1862_main.jpg Specifications Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition Intel Celeron Processor 1.80 GHz (128 L2 cache & 400 MHz FSB) Intel 845GL Chipset 256 MB DDR (PC2100) (DDR for optimal performance) 60 GB HDD 1 24x10x40x Max. CD-RW Drive 3.5'' 1.44MB FDD Intel Extreme Graphics 10/100Mbps built-in Ethernet 56K ITU v.92 ready Fax/Modem AC '97 Audio Keyboard, Wheel Mouse, Amplified Speakers 6 USB 2.0 ports (2 on front), 1 Serial, 1 Parallel, 2 PS/2, Audio-In & Out, Mic-In & Head Phone jack on front, 3 PCI slots (2 available) 7.25''w x 14.125''h x 16''d AOL 3 month membership included Now im useing the same CPU and stuff but i seen these motherboard's on the website called www.newegg.com and i was wonder which of the motherboards on this site is a good motherboard to pick from? http://neweggmotherboard.notlong.com/ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ (Which One out of these?) And Is these the once's that i can use with the Intel Celeron Processor 1.80 GHz ? And Will This MotherBoard Fit Inside the caseing on the eMachines T1862? (and i also found a Intel P4 CPU that was 2.8Ghz. Can that also be on the motherboard?) http://www.2and2.net/Priv/picture0017we.jpg Im not sure exactly what that is under the Socket the was a metal heatsink i think siting there...um how can i say this it had 2 Hooks or Pins that was suppose to hold it down into place...the other pin is broken off...and im not sure if the motherboard had a AGP slot but if it did its broken off as you can see... The reason why is because the computer just shuts off.....the Computer was working, it was just shuting off and i thought it was because of that being off the motherboard those 2 things....

You said: &quot;The reason why is because the computer just shuts off.....the Computer was working, it was just shuting off and i thought it was because of that being off the motherboard those 2 things....&quot; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ I suspect the heatsink clasps you mentioned broken can be replaced. If you can try a plastic/nylon screws&nuts found in h/w stores that fit. -OR- try you're local computer shop to retrieve one from a broken system, etc. laying about. Yeah, it shuts down if heat build-up is too great, do the fix, ASAP. As for the mtrbd. replacement is relative. If you retain the emachine case, many ATX type mtrbds. will work, BUT necessarily all holding posts can be used, beware of that. You need to verify once installed, the mounting posts wehere they are and if extra not shortening out the new mtrbd. or if less that flexing isn't an issue. Hope this helps... tada -----Willy

But this is a picture i made to show what exactly i am talking about. http://www.2and2.net/Priv/ThisRightHere.PNG The T1862 Motherboard is a VC37 http://www.fic.com.tw/product/motherboard/INTEL/VC37.aspx Intel 845GL Chipset, Performance uATX Mainboard for Intel Pentium 4 Processor. 400MHz FSB, Embedded Graphics, DDR266, On-board Audio, LAN option, Ultra ATA100, USB 2.0 Now Im asking if theres a way that i can fix this or i could just buy one of these motherboards on this website. http://neweggmotherboard.notlong.com/ Im Asking which motherboard out of the ones on that site is the best one to pick from?

Go with the BIOSTAR P4VMA-M.... More eMachine info can be found here: http://www.emachineupgraders.info/
12551	4	121460	1379569	1378861	Dragonbssj	8/23/05 5:59 PM	1.12481994E12	Oh	Well i kinda seen that myself i believe it narrows down to the only 2 i see that is mATX REFURBISHED: ASRock P4VM800 Socket 478 VIA P4M800 Micro ATX Intel Motherboard - OEM REFURBISHED: BIOSTAR P4VMA-M Socket 478 VIA PM800 Micro ATX Intel Motherboard - OEM TD25x said to go with the BIOSTAR but why do that? i am asking because to me i think the ASRock looks better for one thing it has more USB ports on that one.
