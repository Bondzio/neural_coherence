Anytime you use a hub to connect devices, each device connected to the hub diminishes the bandwidth from the source (in this case your internet connection coming from your pc). I would suggest you get a switch instead and plug all 8 machines into it along with the incoming internet connection. Everytime something is plugged into a hub, it cuts the original bandwidth or transfer speed in half.
