the ac power connector goes directly to the ground bus in your main power box.
thus your case is always grounded as long as the power supply is plugged into the ac power.
very difficult to understand how the cpu could get zapped.
could see the radiated spike from the discharge causing a glitch on the software processing.
very unlikely to cause damage, unless the computer is totally assembled improperly.
