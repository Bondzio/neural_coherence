Sometimes I am in a room of 5 executives viewing my screen, other times in front of 500 viewing through projection. I am in need of a visually impressive laptop (not a MAC), lightweight (&lt;4lbs), that easily runs animations, presentations, video, etc. and is projection system friendly. If anyone has any advice as to what I should consider, I would love your input.
