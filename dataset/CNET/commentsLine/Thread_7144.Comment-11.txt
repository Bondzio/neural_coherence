oh your right!
never thought of that when i disconnect all the cables to clean inside of computer / fans / etc.
live in a very dusty, damp environment and it's a once a month chore at least.
i'm going to try what the op suggested in the thread and update the drivers from windows base...i found out that microsoft supplied the software for this product originally.
thanks to all for your suggestions.
i all else fails, i'll just leave well enough alone.
