Type BAD CAPS in google.com to find the bad caps web site with pictures. Make sure your system doesn't have that issue. Next are overtaxed power supplies. Is yours stock, old? What size? The last issue is &quot;some other part.&quot; To figure that out I have to reduce what's in the box. Last idea? Replace the CMOS battery. It could be on the low side. Bob
