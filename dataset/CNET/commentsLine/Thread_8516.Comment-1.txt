i have a usb memory bar usb device flash drive which i got recently.
i was able to use it for a few times but after that when i click on properties it has 0 bytes capacity and the file system is raw.
i could not format it because it says &quot;write protected&quot; but i know that it is not write protected, since it is not the type with a write-protect notch/switch.
i always safe-remove it whenever i use it.
please help, thank you.i am using windows xp service pack 2
