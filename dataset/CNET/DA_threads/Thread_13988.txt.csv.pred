1.1.1	I am currently having an issue with a new server build I am working on ( Extended ATX tower ) ... It is an ASUS Z8PED12 MOBO with two xeon 5520 CPUs ... The PS is an OCZ 500W with two 12V rails ( 1 4pin and 1 8pin connector for the cpus ) .	St
1.1.2	I have used a 4pin to 8pin adapter so that both 8pin female power jacks are used on the MOBO .	St
1.1.3	When I first turned on the system , it would reboot about 5-7 min after starting ... it would do this cycle many times until i just turned it off .	St
1.1.4	I tried it today and the server will not turn on at all ... Do i need a better suited PS ?	Ques
1.1.5	This is seemingly a power issue ... any thoughts ?	Ques
1.2.1	http : //vip.asus.com/forum/topic.aspx ? board_id=5 & model=Z8PE-D12X & SLanguage=en-us Reading the posts there it seems such adapters will be troublesome .	St
1.2.2	In other words you need a proper power supply .	St

1.3.1	Server PSU 's from Newegg http : //www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory.aspx ? SubCategory=520 & name=Server-Power-Supplies just make sure you get one that will power the 2 CPU 's	St
1.4.1	The only thing is from this link i have yet to find one that specifically states that it has 2 8pin connectors ... .they only display the +12V1 @ 18A , +12V2 @ 18A which i believe i have seen with the 1 8pin and 1 4pin configurations .	St
