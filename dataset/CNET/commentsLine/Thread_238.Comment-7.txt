another utility that may interest you is the emergency recovery utility nt (erunt) unlike system restore, erunt backs up the entire registry and when it is used to restore the system it actually removes the many orphaned files left behind by many applications that have been uninstalled.
if you download it, read the readme.txt file for a lot of interesting info.
but in spite of what is says about disabling system restore, i suggest not disabling system restore (except to remove pests) as two back ups are always better than one.
erunt backups can also be copied to a cd for safe keeping.
as long as the erunt program is installed on the cd or the computer you can restore with it.
the web page also has a registry optimizer, but it is rarely necessary to use such a utility.
these apps are free of spy ware and such and the price (free) can't be beat.
