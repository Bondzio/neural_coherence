I'm planning to build a new computer, or rather to upgrade a new bare-bones PC, because I don't trust myself to put everything together. I've done a barebones before, but not a video card, sound card, or RAM. I'm looking to buy a barebones from Cybertron PC- with: 400 watt power supply AMD Athlon 64 3000+ NC Pcchips M871G S754 V/A/L ST Motherboard onboard video onboard sound 10/100 network card Firewire card I'm also planning on buying: two 250GP SATA 7200RPM Hard Drives DVD+/-RW Drive DVD-Rom drive 5.1 PCI Sound card two sticks of PC2700 DDR 1GB RAM ATI All-In-Wonder 128 MB 9600 8X AGP Video Card I already have the 5.1 speakers, a VGA/DV-I Monitor, mouse and keyboard. I've had a lot of experience with DVD and HD Drives, and only little experience installing RAM and PCI Drives, so I'm hesitant to buy all of these items at once. Just by looking over this, does it make sense to buy? I'm looking to be able to input and output TV video, as well as burn DVDs, and run many applications, possibly on two monitors. I have done all this before to some degree with the exception of TV out/in-put. I'm especially hesitant about installing the Video Card. For instance, if I installed that card, would I be able to plug a VGA monitor into the VGA port of the motherboard? I can only assume so. And what exactly is the middle squarish port in the middle of the video card, as pictured here: &quot; http://us.st7.yimg.com/store1.yimg.com/I/directron_1870_2728961&quot;? Sorry if this is too long, but I'd appreciate any advice offered.

Key points: * My primary computer has an AMD Athlon64 3300+ processor, which is almost a year old, and was only considered average then. Since technology is always advancing, I wouldn't settle for an Athlon64 3000+, as it is already nearing it's end of life. (AMD has already cut the 3000+ from it's pricing charts.) * The motherboard listed is socket 754, while AMD has recently switched to socket 939. This means you'll find the possibilities of upgrading the processor in the future very limited. * The current standard for RAM is DDR400 PC3200, with DDR2 gaining ground. If you want to look towards the future, go in that direction. However, I'd suggest not going less than PC3200, as PC2700 is reserved for older models and budget systems. * If you click here , Cybertron PC lists the power supply as 350W, not 400W. * The squarish plug on the ATI 9600 is the standard ATI adapter port. You plug the included cable into it, which splits off into 2 VGA connections, the audio cable, and I believe one other. (It's been a while since I've had it.) However, you may want to read the reviews of the AIW 9600, including the one where I wrote of numerous software and driver issues. Personally, I think you might be better off looking through the flyers for a computer as opposed to buying the barebones system and adding onto it. You'll probably be able to find one on sale with an AMD Athlon 3500+ processor (socket 939), 1GB of PC3200 DDR (or even DDR2) RAM, DVD burner, DVD-ROM, and 200-250GB SATA drive for under $700. (HP and Emachines are typically the best deals.) That will give you more power and future upgradability for just slightly more. Then all you have to do is add your seond hard drive and audio/video cards. Hope this helps, John P.S. To my knowledge, there's no way for you to use the motherboard's VGA port while using the video card. However, since the AIW 9600 supports dual monitors, that shouldn't be a problem.

I've posted in other places on the Internet, and I rarely get anything more than ''PCChips ist teh SuXoRz!'' and no further direction. The advice I have basically has made me abandon what I really wanted to do, because I apparently don't understand enough about chipsets, motherboard companies, and types of RAM, I shouldn't be allowed to touch the inside of a computer. But I do know that I want around 500 GBs of HD space, a lot of RAM, a DVD drive with a separate dual-layer, dual format lightscribe burner, and a video card that lets me input and output TV. Beyond that, I just want a good computer that works, not the pure performance that I think most are thinking of. The biggest thing I'm worried about is the video card. I think I can handle everything else, providing the other parts are compatable. If I bought an Emachine or HP, I still wouldn't know exactly what video card to buy.

Any PC YOU build will be better than an Emachine or Dell. http://www.build-your-own-computer-tips.com/index.html I usualy use MSI or Gigbyte MB socket 939. 2 sticks of 512mb DDR-PC3200 memory and the fastest processor you can afford.
