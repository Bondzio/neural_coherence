Hello, I found some information on this forum that helped me identify the cause of a very annoying alarm sounds my PC recently started to make when playing games and running a lot of applications at once.
THANK YOU.
I installed SpeedFan and find that my GPU lowest temp is 135 degrees F and my CPU lowest temp is 125 degrees F. I cleared some dust out of the vents and am keeping the door open, but the temps won't go down.
The side fan is working fine, and the rear fan seems a bit slow, but it's working.
I can't get to look at the video card fan right now.
Any ideas on why my PC is running so hot?
It's driving me nuts!
TIA
