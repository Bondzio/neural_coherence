is the laptop displaying any messages (ie., limited or no connectivity, network not connected, etc) what kind of settings do you have for your security (wep, psk, etc) i have the same router and have encountered a few problems.
at first when i connected everything worked like a charm, then the issues began where it would not connect using wep security encription.
i now have no issues after reseting the router and running the psk security setting.
it runs through three walls and some 50 feet away.
give us a little more info in terms of messages being displayed in the laptop itself.
