Well, I planned on buying a new case, which would come with a new PSU.
I should have worded by original post better, what I meant was maybe I'd need to buy a new PSU to replace the one that would come with my new case?
Like for instance, I was looking at this one: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811129155 It comes with a 450W power supply, would that be good enough?
That case only has one fan, but the processor I am buying comes with a fan and heatsink, and the video card I buy will probably have one as well, would it stay cool enough in there?
