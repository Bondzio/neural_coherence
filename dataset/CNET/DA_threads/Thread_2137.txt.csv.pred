1.1.1	alright , so i know very little about anything & quot ; tech & quot ; but i 'm looking into buying a ( midrange priced ) computer so i looked into some things i might need .	St
1.1.2	Here 's my question : I 'm looking into the Dell XPS 410 .	St
1.1.3	I seem to be hearing ( and reading ) that the difference between the E6600 and E6700 Core 2 Duo processors is very small , so the choice would be between the E6600 and the E6400 .	St
1.1.4	My question is that if i spring for the E6600 , will my 1 GB of RAM waste the extra speed ?	Ques
1.1.5	With only 1 gig of ram , would the difference between the 6600 and the 6400 be so small that it 's not worth the price differential ?	Ques
1.1.6	or would you suggest the 6600 and 2 gigs of ram ( with the price increase involved ... ..on the order of 3-4 hundred ) .	St
1.1.7	information on all of them would be nice , but i 'm also looking for the best price-to-performance .	St
1.1.8	thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	sorry , but i forgot to add a little something .	Polite
1.2.2	As i said , i 'm retarded when it comes to anything tech , but would it be worth it to buy the slower processor , then have a friend of mine overclock it slightly ?	Ques
1.3.1	Hey there jambeat , Here are a few quick note-type thingies : 1 ) Nowadays , I 'd say that 2 GB of RAM is minimum .	St
1.3.2	Your instincts are right -- a fast processor is useless without memory to back it up 2 ) I 'd add that the speed of your RAM is an important factor .	St
1.3.3	So , check the RAM 's speed on the configs .	St
1.3.4	( just in case , disk speed can also be an issue ) 3 ) Overclocking : bad .	St
1.3.5	Do n't overclock .	St
1.3.6	I 've wound up crying over more broken equipment due to overclocking than I care for .	St
1.3.7	Picture this : a brand new computer that you 've just busted because you wanted it to go a bit faster Plus , no way you can make the guarantee work ... Hope this helps , Red .	St
1.4.1	And so should the 6400 .	Sug
1.4.2	Exceptions would be if you do a lot of 3D Gaming or Video editing , or use other high-end applications ( typcially professional apps like Photoshop , AutoCAD , 3DMax , etc ) .	St
1.4.3	Otherwise , browsing the web while checking e-mail and typing a document will barely dent the 1GB of ram , and certainly wo n't tax the processor .	St
1.5.1	This is a case of bottleneck management .	St
1.5.2	At some point , your processor is n't going to be fast enough for what you want , and at some point , you are going to find that you do n't have enough ram for you requirements .	St
1.5.3	If you invest in the processor now and forsake the ram , then if you find out that the ram is not enough , you can simply add more .	St
1.5.4	Make sure that whatever system you get has enough slots for more ram - but whatever ram size you choose , make sure that it is in two sticks .	St
1.5.5	So if you get a 1GB system , make sure it is in two 512Mb sticks of DDR ram , and that there are two more slots that can be used .	St
1.5.6	Having two sticks allows the system to access both simultanously , and enhanced performance over a single stick .	St
1.5.7	This means that doubling your ram is easy .	St
1.5.8	If you do things the other way around , by filling out your ram but underspeccing the processor , then your options are to take out the processor that is installed , and binning it for a faster one - which will ultimately only ever be a few percent faster than the one you are chucking .	St
1.5.9	So in buying a system where the cost is weighted toward the processor , you have a fairly clear upgrade path .	St
1.5.10	As for overlocking , getting a slower processor in the hope that you will clock it faster - well you may well have luck .	St
1.5.11	The problem is that you may not have luck , and diagnosing an error caused by overclocking is a difficult business , as they tend to masquarade as driver errors , or memory errors or whatever .	St
1.5.12	On a windows system , you get a blue screen of death and a lot of wondering about whether it was the last bit of software you installed or the overclock .	St
1.5.13	Having said that , getting a faster processor does n't prevent overclocking - all processors can be overclocked to some degree .	St
1.5.14	If you are going to overclock , then at least start from a position where if it does n't work for you , you wo n't feel like you lost out .	St
1.5.15	Finally , buying extra ram from Dell is not always the cheapest or best quality option .	St
1.5.16	You may be better buying the 1Gb then hunting around for a good deal on some Corsair TWINX .	St
1.5.17	koan	St
1.6.1	I rambled around looking for a replacement for my Dell 8200 .	St
1.6.2	I would have upgraded the ram and been happy but the cost to buy Dell ram was a bit of a shock when other machine 's ram was really reasonable .	St
1.6.3	So I looked around and came up with an HP a1540n with 19 & quot ; flat panel monitor for right at about $ 800.00 after rebate .	St
1.6.4	( We have two Compaqs that operate really well , one locally made to order machine that works really well , and one Dell 8200 that works really well also but needed a ram increase .	St
1.6.5	They all work well ) The HP a1540n has dual core AMD 64 , 2g ram , 250 hard drive sata , cd/dvd writer , front side usbs , firewire , 9 card reader , some room for expansion , and I saw it before I bought it .	St
1.6.6	I did n't have to do mail order .	St
1.6.7	This is our first HP .	St
1.6.8	Still works great after two months .	St
1.6.9	No problems .	St
1.6.10	Have wireless network setup .	St
1.6.11	I complained about having to pay sales tax and the guy gave me $ 50.oo off on an HP all in one printer that I wanted .	St
1.6.12	Everything flows well together .	St
1.6.13	I recommend looking around before getting locked into just buying & quot ; a Dell & quot ; .	St
1.7.1	If you 're not a builder , and do n't plan on building , DELL is not a bad choice .	St
1.7.2	I 've had 5 and had good service .	St
1.7.3	I have just completed an E 6300 build .	St
1.7.4	1 Gig will be fine as long as you choose a very good Video Card with whatever system you choose .	St
1.7.5	Do n't choose Intergrated Graphics as your option .	St
1.7.6	In my benchmark tests , I have found that onboard graphix will utilize a little too much RAM and elevated the CPU temperature with the C2D systems .	St
1.7.7	The 6600 is the sweet spot .	St
1.7.8	You wo n't be overclocking for two reasons : Intel and DELL .	St
1.7.9	Believe me , you wo n't need to overclock with a C2D .	St
