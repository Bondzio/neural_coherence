<s> Alright, so I'm new to this forum, so please excuse if I'm doing something wrong. </s>
<s> But a few months ago I purchased a custom-built desktop from someone. </s>
<s> My intent was to use it for minor-gaming, and so I did. </s>
<s> It worked for a month or maybe a little more than a month and all of a sudden one day I got home from school and I tried to start it up, and it didn't turn on. </s>
<s> It was working fine the night before, and the next day, nothing. </s>
<s> I don't know what could have happen, but my father unplugs things every morning before going to work, maybe that could have done something. </s>
<s> I opened it up to look around. </s>
<s> One thing was unplugged, that was the power LED, the other thing is the ATX SW however, that was plugged in. </s>
<s> I messed around with it for awhile and nothing seemed to work. </s>
<s> I then shifted the wires a bit, and what I got from it was a blue LED light on the power button when the system is powered on. </s>
<s> That didn't happen before from what I recall. </s>
<s> I also took out the PSU and tested it using the paper clip method, and the method worked, the PSU fan was spinning, but when I plug it back into the MOBO, it doesn't work, nothing turns on but that blue LED light on the power button in the front. </s>
<s> No sign of power, no fan, or anything. </s>
<s> I also tried to remove my 4gb of ram memory, that did nothing. </s>
<s> I don't know what else can be done, help please? </s>
<s> I spent a decent dollar on it.. </s>
<s> I don't remember specifics on specs, all I remember is that my MOBO is a BIOSTAR SATA2 A780L3G v6.1 and I had 4g of ram. </s>
<s> Could be simple. </s>
<s> That old extra mounting post problem. </s>
<s> Keep telling more. </s>
<s> Full details such as the 200 Watt PSU and the 8800 video card. </s>

<s> I don't remember any specs, and my PSU just says on it Thermaltake Purepower ATX 12V 2.2 550 and it says that the combined power of +5v and +3.3v is 141w max. </s>
<s> And some new ones, I think there is not enough here to hazard any guess at what it is. </s>
<s> Since you own the machine and don't have make, model, or a story the next stop is the repair shop. </s>
