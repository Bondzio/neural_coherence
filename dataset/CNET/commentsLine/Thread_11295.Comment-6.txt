the basic requirements for file sharing to work are: 1. all computers need to be set to the same workgroup name.
(right click my computer and select properties, then click on the computer name tab) 2. if windows firewall is turned on, file and print sharing must be checked in the windows firewall exceptions area.
(click on start &gt; control panel &gt; windows firewal &gt; exceptions tab) 3. if using a 3rd party firewall such as zonealarm, mcafee or norton, it needs to be configured to allow network access.
4. you must physically have a file or folder shared by right clicking the file name and selecting the sharing tab.
