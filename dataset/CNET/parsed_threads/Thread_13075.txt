<s> I am building a computer for the first time and i have a few questions. </s>
<s> Will an Antec 350w case with ps be enough to power an amd 64 3000+, dvdrw drive, geforce fx 5200? </s>
<s> Which would be easier to set up ide or sata hd. </s>
<s> If i had just the dvdrw on its own channel would i set it to slave or master and if i decided to go with an ide hd would i put the two on the same channel or on different ones and if they were on the same which would be slave and master? </s>

<s> thanks man, isnt the whole cablin setup of a sata drive easier though? </s>
<s> Like do u set a master and slave on sata? </s>
<s> Is the recognization of sata drives a little quirkier than it is with ide drives? </s>
<s> While that will be a big enough power supply to start the install, you may install hardware that will require a lot more than that in the near future. </s>
<s> Get a 400-450W power supply, don't settle for only 350W. </s>
<s> see im lookin at an antec solution series case with a 350w ps or a case from liteon with a 400w ps. </s>
<s> Is going with the better company with lower wattage a good idea? </s>
<s> In my experience, cases that come with power supplies often times like to rip you off and give you crap. </s>
<s> Antec I would trust, and lite-on, yeah maybe I'd trust them too. </s>
<s> But an alternate solution would be to buy a case without a PSU, take the money you save on that, and buy a PSU of your choice. </s>
<s> That's how I always do it. </s>
<s> and the 350 watts is kinda low for your hardware. </s>
<s> Definetly go higher, it never hurts. </s>
<s> Hehe, if you can get an xp 3000 i dont think an extra 50-60 will hurt? </s>
<s> then again maybe im wrong. </s>
