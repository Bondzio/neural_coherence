<s> I have a 320GB 7200rpm SATA-HDD already running off SATA port #1 on my Mobo, and my DVD/CDRW running off of the single IDE channel. </s>
<s> I have a 40GB 5300rpm IDE-HDD lying around and I was thinking of running it on the IDE port as master with the DVD as slave. </s>
<s> The plan is, I was going to just use the 40GB drive for storage only , just for keeping stuff that sits on the faster drive taking up space (documents, images, etc). </s>
<s> I've seen comments on a few other forums that if I do this, it could cause problems for normal operation, even though it's on the IDE channel instead of the SATA where the 'main' drive is. </s>
<s> I realize that there would be problems if I'm using the DVD and the IDE-drive simultaneously, but I doubt that the situation would arise very often, if ever. </s>
<s> The way that I envision it, the SATA and IDE are separate channels, and that there would be no conflict between the two of them. </s>
<s> However, I may be wrong. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> Cheers! </s>

<s> One piece of advice. </s>
<s> Use the shiny new 80 CONDUCTOR IDE CABLE and the CS jumper if you can. </s>

<s> Unless, you left something out, you should be able to use the 40gb HD on the IDE channel. </s>
<s> While, IMHO you really don't gain that much other more storage. </s>
<s> What *may* happen and what becomes a problem is thre old HD will slow things down when accessed and/or become a bottleneck area if used alot. </s>
<s> What you can do, if you like is mount it in an ext. </s>
<s> USB case and use it that way. </s>
<s> Robert also offered using the newer 80-connector IDE cable as well plus CS setting. </s>
<s> Of course, once you set this up, you're &quot;real world&quot; usage will decide for you. </s>
