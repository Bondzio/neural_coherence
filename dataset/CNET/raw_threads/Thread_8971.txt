8658	0	64579	766747	NR	Cycleman	2/15/05 4:21 PM	1.10848446E12	Splitting a monitor output	I would like to split the monitor signal from the computer (15 pin SVGA), with one going to a monitor that is hooked into a KVM switch, the other to an LCD t.v., which has a monitor capable input. I initially tried this with a monitor Y cable, but the monitor behaved erratically, as if it wanted to turn on and off. The LCD t.v. looked normal, except it flashed some signal &quot;over size&quot; which I haven't yet investigated. Would a video distribution amplifier, for a 15 pin monitor cable be available for sale? One input, with two outputs? I assume this would solve it. Al

Devices such as you mention will provide some isolation and signal attenuation but I don't see that to solve a problem where two different signals might be necessary. You can run separate video cards or find one with multiple outputs that might suit you better. Hope that helps but I cannot answer your question directly.

Could you recommend a video card with dual outputs? Would the original monitor output run independently from the video card outputs, so if/when using the KVM, the monitor signal from the computer would be visible on the LCD t.v.? Al

You can do a google search for dual display video to get some ideas of what is available. If your PC motherboard has on board video, you will be limited to PCI cards. It is possible to have more than one in a system. I have a couple Radeon cards with both D-sub and DVI connectors. These will run 2 displays but not at different resolutions.
