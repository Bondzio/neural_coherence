i'm very sorry i don't understand which you mean by last year's best machine.
and if you are questioning about my owned pc specs; it's insufficient for my field work, it's a 2.13 ghz core 2 duo processor with 3 gbs of ram and a 512 mbs nvidia display adapter with a normal 5400 rpm sata hard drive, and a 15.4&quot; screen with native resolution of 1280 x 800. and, yes too, if you mean by dpi the display native resolution of the screens, then the xps one 27 has a resolution of 2560x1440 whilst lenovo ideacentre a720 has 1920x1080.
