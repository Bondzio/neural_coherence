buying ram that's faster than the system components design speed.
all things considered ...i'd go with 2gbs vice 1gb.
that way your ram needs will be covered for this system and os and perhaps one os upgrade (vista ?).
also check asus qvl for ram compatability ... and also see the asus forum on the mb you've chosen.
you can avoid lots of hassles by doing some advance research.
believe most users are reporting better compatibility with corsair ram.
the other thing is how are you planning to backup your data files ?
let us know how it turns out.
