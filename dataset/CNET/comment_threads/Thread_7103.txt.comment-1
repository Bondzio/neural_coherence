The door on my superdrive won't open using the button on the door or with eject from Toast software, I have a firewire drive attached and it does open from Toast.
Superdrive is a Pioneer DVR-103.
Computer is Power Mac G4 733 digital audio running OS X 10.2.8.
Drive shows up on system profiler and on Toast.
Do I have a bad drive?
