Sadly, the attached HD has taken to coughing fits of random mechanical noises and must soon be replaced. To the same system, I've added an Adaptec USB 2.0 expansion card. Q: Any comments/ideas as to the differences in speed to be expected on an internal SATA replacement drive -vs- external USB 2.0 drive in this case? thanks in advance for any help.

There are web sites that cover this in gory detail so the average ATA133 drive is all of 133 megabytes per second in a burst. The slow PCI bus you write can burst at over 2X an ATA drive and SATA drives are not much faster. Think this one over since USB 2.0 is just some 480 mega BITS per second and that pales in comparison to both SATA and PCI speeds. Bob

So clearly the internal drive will be much faster, but my sound card is also on the PCI bus (which my understanding is the number you state is shared amongst everything). Also, I'm not sure - does the AGP video card draw from that as well? Thanks for the prompt reply. This follow-up is to primarily fuel or extenguish my lust for an onboard SATA adapter.

While it is possible to give one off answers to specific points, the PC architecture is widely discussed out on the web or in a book for the better book stores. I'm unsure what you are attempting but there are bottlenecks all over various PCs. But in spite of that we still use them. Bob

AGP has it's own bus dedicated soley to the video card plugged into it (and it's much faster than the PCI bus, despite the usual 3 or 4 PCI slots which all share the same PCI bus). So yes, your sound card and SATA card would be sharing the same bus. It's unfortunate that the moderator chose to, in this case, be a pretentious, unhelpful jerk. Don't offer a coure in PC architecture? Let's stop being condescending for a second and just say that you don't know.
