I am one that likes the latest tech but not a show stopper. Is the above listed issues really a big deal or are they being blown out of proportion? THANKS!!
6292	1	553067	5259824	5259805	R. Proffitt	1/13/12 12:26 PM	1.32645756E12	Can you elaborate?	Here's the GPS &quot;problems&quot; I've read. Both are limitations of GPS technology but new to GPS users may not know about the limitation and write these are glaring defects. 1. On power up, can take many minutes to lock onto satellites. 2. Doesn't work indoors or in parking garages. Is that the problems? Bob

I read the metal case is limiting the range of both the GPS and WIFI. My question is , is this a real concern that makes this tablet less desirable than others.

Something about working with GPS tracking helps me here but as to the WIFi that's odd too. I found no two devices to give the same range. Some would call that a defect. Again, I'm back to writing about limitation or differences. The biggest problem I see folk encounter is when they try to replace their laptop with an Android or other pad. They learn first hand what's up. Bob

6292	7	553067	5259868	5259867	R. Proffitt	1/13/12 3:50 PM	1.3264698E12	Just like most PCs	As we passed some GHz and cores, you have to ask what apps are in need of that quad core tablet. It is very nice but my advice is to wait till the dust settles from CES. Bob

6292	10	553067	5260272	5260224	MWS032653	1/14/12 12:15 PM	1.3265433E12	Price	So , at the same price as an Ipad2 you feel it is too high now? You are right it will probably come down at least some.
6292	11	553067	5260285	5260272	R. Proffitt	1/14/12 12:44 PM	1.32654504E12	For the price of an iPad I'd get the iPad 2.	You never revealed the use for this pad. I'm watching folk rush in and learn the lessons the hard way about apps and more. If you are jazzed about all this, don't buy until you can get past the jazz. As to your comment about if this will bring out this or that, let me comment about Ice Cream. Some folk are waiting for that but developers I know won't use its new features because most folk are not that yet. They seem to be in agreement that in 6 months or a year they might have an Ice Cream feature app. Bob
6292	12	553067	5260329	5260285	MWS032653	1/14/12 4:36 PM	1.32655896E12	Use	I will use it to compose docs,spreadsheets etc for work, check email, share pictures, surf web and use some basic apps at first. It will be my first tablet but I also want it to be worthy of time from a techno point of view. Don't want to be buying or wanting to buy another one in -6- months. Prime is priced the same as the IPAD2. I did not mention the Ipad.
6292	13	553067	5260396	5259805	R. Proffitt	1/14/12 7:22 PM	1.32656892E12	For that use folk are getting really UPSET.	PLEASE do yourself a favor and try to do what you wrote on any Android tablet today. That use is exactly what I'm finding folk upset about. Bob
6292	14	553067	5260473	5260396	MWS032653	1/15/12 4:52 AM	1.32660312E12	Any Tablet	A couple reasons I and looking strong at Asus Transformers(both old and Prime) is the dock and Polaris software.
6292	15	553067	5260590	5260473	R. Proffitt	1/15/12 10:28 AM	1.32662328E12	That will not fix the issues folk are having when	When they think they are going to produce Word and such documents this is where folk are getting upset. My advice is to not buy this system for that use today. Or if you do, don't spend so much you don't have the bucks for a laptop. Bob
6292	16	553067	5260604	5260590	MWS032653	1/15/12 11:30 AM	1.326627E12	Laptop	I have a laptop and Polaris is compatible with Microsoft Office..The tablet will not be used as my only Office tool. Will use it that way mainly when I'm away from home/office.
6292	17	553067	5260634	5260604	R. Proffitt	1/15/12 12:59 PM	1.32663234E12	Then one last thing.	Be sure you can get your money back. At nearly 500 bucks (over?) you are inching towards Ultrabook prices.
6292	18	553067	5260637	5260634	MWS032653	1/15/12 1:44 PM	1.32663504E12	Thanks!!	Thanks for all your advice.....
