i don't have a voltmeter in my place and i am not well-informed in this discipline.
but if it is really easy to learn i will go and read up on my own regarding this.
i have considered all the possible factors said above.
the connection i did is just a bare bones power supply to main socket connection.
i didn't connect the monitor, the speaker, the printer etc.
to imitate what it was done at the technician's place.
further, i did place the computer at the same orientation as what i saw placed in the technician's area, and at the same time, i blasted the fan full speed at the motherboard but still the problem persisted.
i guess then it probably really is the motherboard.
thanks for the help.
