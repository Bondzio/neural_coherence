i have ever heard somewhat &quot;qiguan diagnostic cards&quot;.
it is said that their diagnstic cards thoroughly eliminated the &quot;initial codes&quot; and solved problems like wrong codes, redundant codes and omitting codes, which greatly reduced guesswork in pc troubleshooting.
maybe you can have a try.
