Now, at my house I have 3 computers. The new XPS M1710 that I am typing on, a computer next to me that, unfortunately I dont have very complete specs on, as it was built from scratch by my brother-in-law (It is his computer) and my ancient Dell Desktop, Dimension 8100, which has been continuously upgraded over the years. My brother-in-law and I are both real big gamers, so when he visits on the weekends we like to waste a night on the LAN, so to date have used a Belkin F5D5231-4 (Wired?) Router to service the series of tubes to both my old Dell Desktop and his custom rig. However, now that I have a mobile laptop (Notebook, whatever), I am interested in having the wireless option for the M1710 should I choose to move about my house. I mentioned this to my brother-in-law, however he seemed rather opposed to a wireless router. Both his custom PC and my old Dimension 8100 would need those network cards, (Which equals more money, he tends to be very stingy with his cash), whatever, but my main concern is he claimed that Wireless Routers are inferior at transmitting my internet access. Now I can certainly see merit behind that, but I still believed that in today's fast-paced tech world there much be SOME sort of wireless router that can do the job. However, a light bit of research seems to prove that general point- wireless routers are often restricted by how much Ted Stevens they can handle at once. I did see mention of Routers that had both ports for the Wired Ethernet, as well as Wireless capability. My question is: Is it possible to find a Router that would both have enough ports for at least the 3 wired connections to all 3 of my computers (Including the M1710 Laptop), AND provide wireless internet to my M1710 when I choose to move about my house without the wired connection? Would switching between these two services be a nightmare? Or hassle-free? If this would be possible, where could I find a good router that provides both wired internet access as well as the option of wireless access for my M1710, while not limiting my 3meg internet service, and how much would it cost? Anything over $100 is a bit pricey, but exceptions can be made. My brother-in-law is an awesome gaming companion, but can be stubborn and hard to convince. Is there any technological compromise to be had here? Sorry for the long-winded question, and thanks in advance. P.S. -------------------------------------------------- If you need any more specs on the computers I will do my best to list them in a reply, but I did not want to make the initial request any more wordy than necessary. I also apologize for any technically errors or mistakes I may make, as I am still a teenager and constantly trying to improve my understanding of the latest and greatest tools at our disposal.

The wired connection is some 100 megabit and even with every card updated that 108 megabit wireless connection is only theory and must be shared with all other wireless traffic. Some gamers won't do this. On the other hand no one I know has 100 megabit connections to the internet so all that bandwidth is just buffer from here to there and won't really be felt (except by the most rabid gamers.) I have no correct answer here but the kid connects over 802.11g (just 54 megabit) to a 20 buck di-524 from Dlink. Yes they play online games but they don't complain. Bob

Prices vary but are somewhere in the range of 40 to 70 USDollars.

I've tried searching around a bit more and hopefully found one that will work well: The Netgear WGT624: http://netgear.com/Products/RoutersandGateways/SuperGWirelessRouters/WGT624.aspx (Not sure if I'm supposed to do that, if not, my apologies) Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to have: 4 ports for wired Ethernet, so the Dimension 8100 and the custom rig can stay plugged in at all times, and the XPS M1710 can physically plug in when I'm not up and about my house. A 108mbps speed, or at least I gathered that, And the wireless network option for &quot;standard 802.11g connections&quot;. ----- Now, the XPS M1710, as far as I can tell, has &quot;an Intel PRO/Wireless 3945 card, supporting A, B, and G bands&quot;. I'm assuming that this is good news, but since I have zippo experience with wireless networks, I'm taking tiny baby steps. Now my only questions are: Was I correct in assuming this example router will correctly work with the XPS M1710 when it is operating wirelessly? And should I choose to use the physical ethernet cable (and it will spend most of its life in this state, being a desktop replacement) will it encounter any issues switching between being connected with the cable and then going wireless and back? Would this... &quot;confuse&quot; either the router or the system? And would this router inhibit the capabilities of the physical ethernet connections in any negative way? My brother-in-law lives in a sort of &quot;internet dead zone&quot; where the only connection the ISPs have available to him is what amounts to a good old fashioned 28.8k modem, so he considers any loss in my 3 meg service to be a huge sin. And finally, if anyone familiar with a Netgear router like this one (or heck, any router situation similar to mine) how would you rate the difficulties of setting it up? I'm hoping for the better, but its good to be informed. If any of these questions can be answered I would be most grateful, and I apologize for any lapses in my knowledge and/or manners. (On a side note I managed to spell &quot;technical&quot; in my first post &quot;technically&quot;. Golden star for me)

Additionally, I switch between wired and wireless on my laptop and have never experienced any issues, including the other two laptops also. One is a Gateway, one is a Toshiba, the other an Acer. As far as setup goes, After going thru the learning curve, I find it somewhat moderate to set up. The biggest issue is making too many changes at one time. So my advice would be to take it one step at a time, make sure the last step implemented works properly, then proceed to the next step. If all else fails, post here and you will get an abundance of great help to point you in the right direction. Don't get discouraged or frustrated, most of us have been there, done that, and will gladly help you out as best we can.
