<s> iMac G4 Flat-Panel, OS 10.4.11: My iMac keeps recognizing one EXT FW HD but not my IOMEGA EXT FW HD. </s>
<s> Both are journaled. </s>
<s> Startup Disk selection in Prefs does not recognize the Iomage HD, yet I see it on my desktop. </s>
<s> Whazzup? </s>
<s> How to keep the Imega HD as my startup disk? </s>
<s> why do you need it as the startup drive? </s>
<s> Along with the Mac OS X (Journaled), make sure that the thing is set to GUID partion table. </s>
<s> If it is not, it will not be recognized as a legitimate startup disk P </s>
<s> TechTool Pro tells me the INT HD (only 80) is failing; the IO HD is 250, only 8 mos old. </s>
<s> So I figured the IO HD could hold every thing with room to spare. </s>
<s> Where do I go to set to GUID partition table? </s>
<s> How to do? </s>
<s> and erase that Iomega drive. </s>
<s> Then partition it into ONE partion. </s>
<s> Click the Customize button and choose Apple as the partition type. </s>
<s> Proceed from there. </s>

<s> Solved my problem: PPC Macs will not boot from USB EXT HD, only FW. </s>
<s> I goofed on titling this thread: my Iomega HD is EXT USB! </s>
<s> Anyone selling an EXT FW HD for a G4? </s>
<s> Should be hundreds of choices today. </s>
<s> But if I had that Iomega I might pull the hard drive out of it and see if it fits in some enclosure like http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817146604 </s>
<s> platform specific. </s>
<s> A FW HD will work on a PC or a Mac, as will a USB drive or a SATA drive P </s>
<s> USB 2.0 has max transfer rate of 480 Mbits/s; IEEE 1394b-2002 has 786.4 Mbits/s. </s>
<s> Wouldn't Iomega or WD use slower drives for USB 2.0 external drives than they do for Firewire 800 external drives, to minimize costs. </s>
<s> What would happen if I put a slower SATA drive inside the Firewire 800 external drive enclosure. </s>
<s> Does it still work except for slower transfer; or my Mac won't mount the drive on its Firewire 800 port? </s>
<s> I'm interested because I'm looking for a fast Firewire 800 external drive to make periodic bootable backups of the boot-disk on my MacBook Pro. </s>
<s> I think I need about 500GB to keep the most recent 2-3 bootable backups of my 200GB boot drive on my Mac to recover from disk crash or system hang. </s>
<s> I already use an IOmega eGo 1TB Mac Edition for Time Machine backups. </s>
<s> Is it wise to assemble my own Firewire 800 external storage or buy one off the shelf? </s>
<s> My problem is mfgr's like IOmega and WD don't give you enough details of the hard disk inside the box to compare. </s>
<s> I'm a computer hardware professional in a past life but is not sure how to make sense of the info published by hard drive manufacturers. </s>
<s> Any recommendations for a refresher or tutorial. </s>
<s> I find many to get uppity as they begin the learning process that transfer rate over the wire is not any indication of the overall speed of the transfer. </s>
<s> Yes, 800 should result in lower times but in my experience it never cut a 10 second transfer down to 5 seconds. </s>
<s> As to the slower SATA drive that's easy. </s>
<s> Even SATA 1.5GbS is faster than 800 so you should not see any measurable change from SATA 3GbS to that. </s>
<s> Yes the drive seek time changes have more of an impact but you knew that. </s>
<s> As to the tutorial I suggest you keep reading and reading and after a few months it will start to make sense. </s>
<s> I like our classes when we read about Amdahl's laws and think it applies here. </s>
<s> This and thinking about this like the slowest link in the chain sets the speed. </s>
<s> However the read and write speeds of drives are far lower than the transfer rate of the interfaces. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yes, you're right. </s>
<s> Thanks for pointing out that these external storage all use SATA drives. </s>
<s> Unless I have an eSATA port on my Mac, I'm getting way too cerebral here and would be wasting my money on the faster drives! </s>
