hi, i'm looking to put together a mid-range to (low)high-end workstation pc for my own use and i'm trying to educate myself on what parts i should think about getting, but i am stuck on the video card.
geforce cards are way more affordable than the quadro fx cards(i'd like to stick with nvidia.)
in a perfect world i'd like the performance of the quadro with the price of a geforce.... but to be honest i've never used a quadro and wouldn't know how much of a difference it makes.
would it make more sense to buy a high end geforce or a mid to entry range quadro?
