<s> Ok Heres the time line of events Original hard drive working wine with WinXP Buy new 160gb seagate hard drive and install Ubuntu Linux. </s>
<s> (I left the xp drive in place, but i just swapped the ide cable to the new drive). </s>
<s> I run the new seagate hard drive with linux (which installed fine the first try) for a few days then switch the ide cable back to my xp drive....no problem. </s>
<s> few days of widows...open the case plug the ide back to linux, start-up and BAM...problem. </s>
<s> Ubuntu would start loading but would hang and never get to the desktop. </s>
<s> I would have to switch off the power. </s>
<s> I never had a problem loading Linux before i switched to the other XP hard drive. </s>
<s> I try to reinstall Ubuntu...but it doesn't let me reinstall gives me an error during installation. </s>
<s> So I switch back to the XP drive, and everything boots up fine, then after about 5 min, the computer just turns off. </s>
<s> Does this everytime i boot up win xp. </s>
<s> 5 mins of running than BAM - off. </s>
<s> So i decide to reinstall XP and now it wont reinstall XP, it hangs during install. </s>
<s> So now Ive got two seperate hard drives both of which won't complete a full install of an O.S. </s>
<s> and I've tried both XP and Ubuntu on both hard drives same problem on both drives. </s>
<s> I checked the new seagate drive using the diagnostics disk, and no problems were detected, i even wrote zeros to the entire drive (took about 10 hours) and still the same problem when trying to reinstall. </s>
<s> Since this happened to two drives that were never connected at the same time, and because the diagnostics for my hard disk comes back clean I assume I may have a hard ware failure somewhere else. </s>
<s> Could this be a MB problem? </s>
<s> Any suggestions on how i solve this problem. </s>
<s> (good thing my laptop still works!) </s>
<s> Thanks, -Brent </s>
<s> If you remove any HD from your configuration (comparing with configuration when Linux was installed), or change Primary/Secondary or Master/Slave position, Linux won't boot without /etc/fstab reconfiguration. </s>
<s> Please, send error reported in boot sequence. </s>
<s> An overheating cpu could cause these problems. </s>
<s> Any chance you accidently unplugged a fan while you were inside the case? </s>
<s> Make sure all fans, including any on the CPU are spinning. </s>
<s> Also check for cables/wires that might block a fan when you close the case. </s>
<s> Are both hard drives powered on during your tests? </s>
<s> Unplug the power connector to the drive you're not using. </s>
<s> Make sure the IDE cable is firmly and correctly connected to the hard drive and the motherboard. </s>
<s> When one starts to move things around, it easy to turn one simple problem (stopped fan) into two problems (stopped fan and loose IDE cable.) </s>
<s> Could be other things. </s>
<s> Be specific about what the problems during your installs. </s>
<s> Completely hosed it. </s>
<s> Destroyed. </s>
