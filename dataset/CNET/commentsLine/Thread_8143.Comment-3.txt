here's some combo that works.
1. the haupaugge tv pci capture card.
the go product is mono, but does not matter since capture is from your audio card.
you can use it's capture software to get the first step done.
less that 50 dollars.
2. a dvd recorder with bundled software.
many out there, but a multi-format unit with plus and minus media support and dvd creation software (light video editing too)  starts at 113 dollars.
maybe a trip to radio shack for a cable, but unlikely.
the host machine for a 2 hour video will have about 20gb free during the work and even my older p3-600 with 256 mb or ram could do the dvd creation overnight.
even with more ram and many more ghz of cpu, you still have to be patient.
bottomline?
this is getting a lot cheaper.
