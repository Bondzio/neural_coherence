<s> I have Seagate 400 GB hard drive with alot of music on it. </s>
<s> And I can't get it to show up on my computer. </s>
<s> Here's the deal. </s>
<s> Last Thursday during a big storm, and our power went out. </s>
<s> I usually keep the computer and the external hd on during the day while I'm at work. </s>
<s> When the power went out, the computer and the external hd went off. </s>
<s> Last night, I plugged in the computer - works fine, no prob. </s>
<s> I plugged in the external hd - nada. </s>
<s> First, I can't really get it to turn on. </s>
<s> When I push the on/off button, the blue light doesn't light. </s>
<s> If I unplug it from the wall and from the usb, then plug it in the wall, the blue light blinks, and then stays lit if I plug it in the usb. </s>
<s> But even with the blue light on that way, it still doesn't show up on my computer. </s>
<s> I basically can't get my computer to recognize it, and I need some help. </s>
<s> 300+ gigs of music (and who knows how many hours of d'loading it) hangs in the balance. </s>
<s> Thx! </s>
<s> Go out and get another case ($20-$30). </s>
<s> I don't really know what that means. </s>
<s> A new case for the external hd? </s>
<s> And then what? </s>
<s> Take the hd out of the old case? </s>
<s> Basically, again: I can't get the external hd to show up when I click &quot;My Computer&quot; even when the external hd appears to be turned on. </s>
<s> So I can't even run data recovery software until I can get the computer to recognize that the external hd is hooked up, right? </s>
<s> Either the USB port is broken, or the case, or the disk itself. </s>
<s> Assuming you tested the USB port by using it for some other device and by testing the case/disk combination on another PC, the conclusion should be that the port is OK and the case or the disk broken. </s>
<s> Next step: mount the drive in a new case and try again. </s>
<s> With some luck it works. </s>
<s> If it doesn't work in a new case on another PC either, the disk itself is broken. </s>
<s> Then it's time for a new hard disk also. </s>
<s> A data recovery company might be able to get your data off it. </s>

<s> Quick followup. </s>
<s> Some friends told me to open the case and plug hd inside the computer as a slave. </s>
<s> I'm not really sure what that means, or how to do it. </s>
<s> I open the case and unplug the hd. </s>
<s> Then I open the tower and plug in the hd? </s>
<s> Where? </s>
<s> Will it be obvious? </s>
<s> Do I have to plug in a power supply for the hd, too? </s>
<s> http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6121_102-0.html?forumID=45&threadID=262041 There's a very good chance there's a fitting cable. </s>
<s> Note the position/side of the red stripe on that flat cable! </s>
<s> The power connection is somewhat easier. </s>
<s> Good luck, Kees </s>
<s> Really appreciate the help! </s>
