in a home environment nat does almost as much to protect you as a firewall.
the primary job of a firewall is to prevent unauthorized traffic from getting to your machine.
when you have only a single real ip address the router has to be told where to send the traffic.
it is smart enough that if you talk to a site on the internet it will allow the traffic to come back in.
for traffic that comes in without you asking first the router is stupid and throws it away since it dose not know where to send it.
not a lot different than if you put a rule in the firewall.
if you run dmz type configuration that tells the router to send everything by default to a machine then you need a firewall more since unknown traffic will come into a machine.
there are ways to place a hardware firewall in your setup but it gets messy since the wan link is wireless and you still want to use wireless on your lan.
you could always buy one of the usb things for the verizon and buy a aftermarket router that has a firewall if you really wanted.
i suspect you will be fine with just the pc firewall, just do not setup the dmz or port forwarding unless you absolutely need it.
make sure you test this before you commit to a 2 year contract.
if you cannot get lte (4g) coverage in the house it will be very slow compared to anything else you have used.
3g coverage is fine for phone surfing but is painful when used with a computer.
