I have just updated my motherboard on a 3.0 AMD XP desktop and now have an embarrassment of opportunities for network connections; something I want to use, but have never tried.
My folder says I have : Broadband WAN miniport, PPPoE, disconnected, Broadband (dialup) connected, 1394 1 adapter, and 1394 2 adapter, local area connection 3 (nVidia nForce Networking Controller) local area connection 4 (3com 3C920B-EMB Intergrated Fast Ethernet Controller, 1 gigabyte LAN).
Which of these A) is most practical for Wi-fi connection to a Notebook, and B) would best serve as a physical connection to another desktop?
Probably naive question, but I've been slow to get into this side of computing.
Thanks in advance, phantazy.
