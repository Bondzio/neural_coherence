1.1.1	Hello everybody, I'm asking for your help in locating a unique case for my next build.	St
1.1.2	I'm looking for the following features: 1.	St
1.1.3	Right side window (which means the mobo will be inverted) 2.	St
1.1.4	Four USB connections (preferably near the top) that can be accessed without opening a door/panel 3.	St
1.1.5	Two 3.5 external bays (one for a floppy for SATA & one for a card reader) 4.	St
1.1.6	Black, Silver or 2-tone 5.	St
1.1.7	Price range up to $139 6.	St
1.1.8	Power supply is optional 7.	St
1.1.9	Oh, and something unique, but not TOO flashy or dorky!	St
1.1.10	LOL I've found a few, but nothing that matches perfectly.	St
1.1.11	Two of the AeroCools come close, the Masstige and the Spiral Galaxies.	St
1.1.12	The Silverstone Temjin TJ06 comes mighty close and the Enermax CS-718 looks VERY good.	St
1.1.13	Since you guys are the experts, I thought I'd turn to you and see if there are any deals to be had out there that fit this criteria.	St
1.1.14	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	I can't advise you on your case, but I do know that some motherboards have heatpipes that don't function properly when upside down.	St
1.2.2	Just making sure you have this issue covered.	St
1.3.1	Yeah, I read that somewhere else.	St
1.3.2	I'm curious as to why turning the heatpipes upside down would decrease their ability to discipate heat.	St
1.3.3	Hmmm....OK, thanks for the insight!	Polite
1.4.1	[gravitational force] is what causes air movement via natural convection.	St
1.4.2	[hot air rises] Can't use natural convection in a satellite because of zero gravity.	St
1.5.1	BTX type.	St
1.5.2	Why not stick with ATX?	St
1.5.3	Intel has vertually failed to convince anyone to go to BTX configiuration.	St
1.5.4	Else find a BTX type mobo [good luck].	St
1.6.1	there is only one acceptable direction of the heat [air]flow to move heat from the CPU to the heatsink.	St
1.6.2	Thus the force to move the heated air is generated in the vertical legs of the heat pipes.	St
1.6.3	Inverting them would cause the flow in the wrong direction.	St
