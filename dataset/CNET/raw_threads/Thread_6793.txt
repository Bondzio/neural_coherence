(obviously it would be better to go in between, i wanna know out of personal interest. so those are you only two choices ;))

For example if you try to play games on XP with just 256 RAM the video card likely doesn't matter. Similarly, borderline minimal requirements on either may not be good if the game is graphic intensive. Meanwhile you could have all the memory in the world but an integrated video with limited memory, e.g. a 64 MB integrated video configuration, would also limit gaming experiences. Regards, JB

So a video card (graphics engine) with a lot of memory will be able to handle the most graphical processing. On the other hand, if your graphical interface is on the motherboard (and not separate card) lots of ram would greatly increase its performance.

Usually somewhere (often the bottom end) on the game software box is a list of the system requirements to run the software. Often there will be two sets of specs: the minimal hardware required to run it (in its lowest graphical modes), and also the preferred or &quot;optimal&quot; system specs that would allow you to set the in-game graphics parameters to the higher or max variables. Also, the DirectX minimal version the game requires is important (software wise). The newest released is DirectX 10, which is vastly different than 9 and the previous versions. However at the present time, DirectX 10 video hardware is just emerging and so is kind of rare to find, and can cost BIG bucks, often over $600 USD. The prices will drop predictably over time, as earlier versions did, so most people wait on new standards until they are affordable.

Right now, technology is at a crossroads, the new operating system; Vistaaaaaa, ugh, supposedly uses a 1GB or RAM, so it might be a good idea to have 2 GB or more just in case, getting back to graphics; Go with Nvidia or ATI for a graphics card, make sure your motherboard supports either AGP or PCI Express before you buy one. Nvidia has already released their new line of graphic cards, ATI is about to release theirs around April. I suggest waiting till ATI releases theirs, has the best graphics, or go ahead and get a Nvidia graphics card if you can't wait. Remember, in terms of graphics, very few games even use 256MB of memory for both the computer and the GPU of the graphics card; like the saying &quot;If it ain't broken, don't fix it!&quot;

Obviously, the more RAM you have, the better some games will perform (Battlefield 2/2142 eat RAM alive). Both are pretty important, since a good videocard with no ram won't really help you, and a lot of ram with a junk video card won't run some games.
5753	7	228003	2385720	2384124	vewert	1/26/07 5:12 AM	1.16978832E12	depends I guess	my comp. as of now has 2 gigs of RAM and a 128mb ati standard video card that came with the desktop. I'm thinking about upgrading the video card now but I have no problems running games like counterstrike or battlefield on it. But with Vista now out, 256mb video memory is the standard it seems.

Having somewhat higher than the min will allow u to play lower-end/older PC games better, but which probably won't end up using the might of the muscular vid card since those games aren't likely to have great textures, graphics, lighting/shading, and other visual effects having a crappy vid card but lots of RAM, again probably limited to flash games and lower-end/older PC games. Ditto if the vid card were slightly above low-end. U'd actually be able to play higher end games decentl, but with features and details turned off/down. If it came down to these 2, I would go latter for work, as generous RAM is certainly a performance/productivity booster. For home, the former, as i would just upgrade RAM right away, which is the easier of the 2 to upgrade.

I started with the base game, 256MB RAM, and an on-board video card with 64MB shared. The base game was not too bad, but it took a player a while to cross a room. When the expansion packs started coming out, I crashed lift, right, and center, until I added a 1GB stick to my computer. What a difference in speed, until the game ate up all of my CPU resources, so I knew it was time for an independent video card. I went to the website for The Sims2, and printed out their requirements. I then ran the Direct-X to see what I actually had. I took both papers into the place that custom-builds my computers for me, showed them the list, and told them how much money I had to spend. I walked out with an ATI Radeon 9250, with 128 MB of RAM, and the game runs very smooth, and I can actually see blades of grass, fine patterns on furniture, and actual patterns on wallpaper. Total cost for the 1GB RAM=$70.00 CDN; video card was $40.00 Cdn. Soon, for the next EP (Seasons), I will need a better processor; mine is 1.2 GHtz, which is 0.2 GHtz over the latest EP (Pets), so that is when I will fall into trouble. Good luck.

XP 'likes' about 1gb of memory to stay out of the swapfile. Any time xp reads/writes to the swapfile, everything stops... A 8800gtx won't help here... It will just look great while waiting for the swapfile to finish. If you have LESS than 1gb of memory, forget about the video card and buy as much memory as you can afford (and what your computer can use). 1gb is my minimum, with 2gb being a sweet spot.

You can't really choose between RAM and a good GFX card for excellent gaming experience. Both of those two work together to deliver great graphics. For example, I have 1gig of RAM and I used to have a GeForce 6600 128MB. Playing the Sims 2 was sweet, even with the expansions installed. There was very little lag, and I spent hours in front of the computer. When I would play Counter-Strike: Source, it looked great. I even used that HDR (I think, you know that stuff where it was featured in Half-Life: Lost Coast) and it was playable with no lag. So you really can't choose. :P
