why not do just that and once done, reformat the whole drive or wipe it clean.
then reformat and make that whole drive available as &quot;c&quot;.
all you're doing is safeguarding your old &quot;c&quot; drive data either by backup or save critial data you deem necessary.
again, once done reformat.
in the install the os, once it asks do you want to use the whole drive, select yes and allow to reclaim all space.
however, i like to truly wipe it clean to remove all past anything and thus start fresh.
once that's done, i then reformat or install the os providing it reclaims all space and proceed.
i use killdisk or dban free versions for disc wiping.
