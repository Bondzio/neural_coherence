<s> I recently got a new computer and NETGEAR WGR614 router and i installed my guild wars game onto the cpu. </s>
<s> when i go to login, it gave me an error saying i couldnt connect. </s>
<s> i went to the guild wars support site and found i need to have ports 80 and 6112 open. </s>
<s> i went and configured them. </s>
<s> i added both to fowarding and was still not able to connect. </s>
<s> then i tried to add them to triggering, but i can only add Port 6112. when i put 80 in, it says i cant use it. </s>
<s> is there a way to put it in or do i have to do something else. </s>
<s> nevermind, i re-installed an it works fine </s>
