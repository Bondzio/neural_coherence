<s> My motherboard is a Gigabyte GA-965P-DS4. </s>
<s> All information about SATA hotswapping is very unclear: Does this motherboard support SATA hotswapping? </s>
<s> That is, does it have the ability to detect if you connect a external harddrive with SATA-II connector, to the SATA port (through an e-SATA connector at the back of my case, that is connected directly to one of the motherboard's SATA ports). </s>
<s> If I try in Linux, nothing happens. </s>
<s> If I try in Windows, nothing happens either. </s>
<s> And if I disconnect it while in Windows, it crashes. </s>
<s> So I assume that either my Linux and Windows will need some drivers to support e-SATA hotswapping, or the motherboard just doesn't support it. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what the deal is, and how I can get it to work? </s>
<s> I can connect the external HD through USB2.0 of course, but SATA is much faster, I want to play games from this HD and still have the ability to disconnect it from my PC and connect it again without rebooting. </s>
<s> Technically no. </s>
<s> This is done all in drivers. </s>
<s> If an owner missed a driver or has an outdated BIOS that the driver needed then it fails. </s>
<s> I have not researched YOUR board but the number of times I encounter a missing driver is nearly 100% of the time. </s>

<s> Back a long time ago it was thought it was when you didn't tell the OS you were going to remove a drive. </s>
<s> Today you see this in the no-support zone. </s>
<s> For Windows you'll have to eject the drive prior to removal. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Can I hot swap a external hard drive using a sata cable? </s>
<s> Hot Swap would need some additional software to pull it off. </s>
<s> ESATA supports hot plug just like USB but is that all you need? </s>
<s> If I'm not reading minds here please correct me what you think How Swap is. </s>
