1.1.1	i recently went to plug in my speakers into the back of my computer but mistakenly tried to plug it into a usb port : S when i realised i unplugged it and a pop up on the monitor came up saying usb overload and everything froze , i then turned off my computer and the power lights on the tower were blinking , i then unplugged the power and plugged it back in and tried to turn the computer back on , but nothing would happen .	St
1.1.2	does anyone know what i can do to get my computer working again ?	Ques
1.2.1	You said ''i then turned off my computer and the power lights on the tower were blinking , i then unplugged the power and plugged it back in and tried to turn the computer back on , but nothing would happen . ''	St
1.2.2	Not good , I saw this once .	Polite
1.2.3	I came home to a strange smell and found my computer power lights blinking and just like you I turned it off and it never came back .	St
1.2.4	Best bet , take it to computer repair place that will check it out for you and consult you before making any costly repairs .	St
1.2.5	I took mine to a local place with specific instruction to try only replacing the power supply , if that did not work stop all repairs and call me .	St
1.2.6	I was told it was trashed and that only the case was still good .	St
1.2.7	I paid a $ 34 bench fee and took my smelly dead computer home .	St
1.2.8	I fixed the PC anyway by replacing the HDD , motherboard , power supply , ram , and modem .	St
1.2.9	The only parts that made it were the case , video card , and sound card .	St
1.2.10	The parts alone to do this cost me about $ 400 and hours of work .	St
1.2.11	Right now you can buy a cheap PC for that .	St
