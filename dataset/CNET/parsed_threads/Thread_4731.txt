<s> Hi, I'm running a wireless network using a Belking G router, with WPA2-PSK authentication and AES encription. </s>
<s> I'd like to wirelessly connect my new MacBook Pro running XP to this network. </s>
<s> The properties box says the Mac has an Atheros AR5006X wireless network adapter. </s>
<s> It currently runs the default windows wireless utility, which has only WPA-PSK, *NOT* WPA2-PSK. </s>
<s> My installed Atheros driver is ver. </s>
<s> 4.2.2.27 from 17/07/2006. </s>
<s> Is there a specific Atheros configuration utility I can use? </s>
<s> Is there a generic (open-source) one? </s>
<s> I've searched the web and haven't been able to find one. </s>
<s> I found some Atheros drivers that may contain such a utility, but they're OLDER than the driver I have. </s>
<s> Failing that, how can I use the windows utility to configure the Mac to use WPA2? </s>
<s> Thanx, Nir </s>
<s> The drivers are from Apple.com and they hold all the keys here. </s>
<s> Just change your router to one of the supported encryptions and it works. </s>
<s> Not good enough? </s>
<s> Call Apple. </s>

<s> Hmmm... Where do I find these drivers? </s>
<s> How can I find out if/when Apple (or anyone else) publishes updated drivers? </s>
<s> What about the configuration utility? </s>
<s> Can I use any utility other than the default Windows one? </s>
<s> Am I dependant on Apple for this as well? </s>
<s> Thanx, Nir </s>
<s> They have their updater. </s>
<s> If you feel you have found a bug, do report it. </s>
<s> I bet the issue is elsewhere. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ??? </s>
<s> I'm not sure what I could consider a bug. </s>
<s> My question was where to find the latest drivers, or more importantly, an alternate configuration utility. </s>
<s> Am I always limited to the hardware manufacturer's drivers and utility? </s>
<s> Thanx </s>
