The Surface looks perfect.
But yes, bet it'll be expensive - probably double my budget.
In the meantime, any recommendations for the best value PC laptop at a budget of 500 UK pounds / 600 euros / 800 US dollars ?
I'd go for 10.1&quot; for weight of 1.3 KG or less, and am a sucker for big brands such as Samsung and HP (can't imagine buying a Lenovo, Assus or Acer).
