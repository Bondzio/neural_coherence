9172	0	350380	3083368	NR	pamlo	7/17/09 11:43 AM	1.24783098E12	Wireless to wired connection	I have a 2wire DSL modem and last year set up a wireless network for my nearby laptop and my PC downstairs. Due to problems since day 1 I'd rather have a wired connection downstairs. I don't care about having a network, sharing files between the two computers, etc. Can I just connect my PC to the filtered phone jack downstairs? Can the laptop still be wireless upstairs or does that need to be wired too? Thanks so much!

I thought it came into the house and you could use any phone jack to receive the signal and, thus, have more than one computer at a time receiving the signal. Thanks,Pam

So, I'd have to run a wire from the 2wire gateway to my laptop nearby and to my PC downstairs. That's not too practical. I guess I will have to work on restoring the wireless connection on my PC downstairs, a topic for another forum!
