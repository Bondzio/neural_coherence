&lt;&lt;without a cpu, how did you run diagnostics?&gt;&gt; should have been more clear - didn't run diagnostics, used diagnostic section of the manual.
manual had a diagram of 4 lights at the back of the machine.
it said if the 4 lights were red, the processor is dead or damaged.
the 4 lights were red.
my shiny new (january 21, '04) 64-bit athlon processor is fried.
power is not the problem - i can still open and close the dvd drives, the monitor comes on, but with a black screen and blinking green stand-by light.
the fans come on as well.
it was plugged into a good surge protector, but that was apparently not enough.
its a compusa machine, we bought a different power supply at purchase, and they were to install it.
when we came to pick up our machine, i had the strong feeling they were scrambling through the installation while we waited.
perhaps the power supply was improperly installed (i.e., not properly grounded).
