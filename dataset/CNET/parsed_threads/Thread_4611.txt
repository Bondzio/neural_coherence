<s> Hi, I just set up a 2 computer home network with ICS. </s>
<s> I'm using SMC Ethernet adapters and a Cat 5E Crossover cable, and I have a dialup connection to the internet. </s>
<s> My host computer has Windows ME and the client has Windows 98SE. </s>
<s> Everything works fine - I can share files and the printer between the computers, and they both can access the internet. </s>
<s> My problem is that now my host computer always wants to connect to the internet. </s>
<s> When I disconnect, it automatically reconnects, and sometimes it dials up by itself when I'm not even around! </s>
<s> This is no good, because I have limited access, and it's using up my time on who knows what. </s>
<s> So, I went into DUN settings and changed it from &quot;Dial whenever a network connection is not present&quot; to &quot;Always dial my default connection&quot;, and I also removed my password so now I have to type it in, but none of these things has helped. </s>
<s> It's like it has a mind of it's own now, and it's obsessed with being on the internet! </s>
<s> Daily virus and spyware scans are all clean, so I don't think that's a problem, but I don't know what else to do to make it behave. </s>
<s> How can I get control over my computer again? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> Any DNS query, open web page on any machine, etc... will trigger a dialup. </s>
<s> A lot of software autoupdates. </s>
<s> Sadly with the move to broadband very few new softwares are &quot;quiet&quot; today. </s>
<s> Keep looking at what's running on each machine. </s>
<s> Power them off to find the offender. </s>

<s> But at least I now know that it's a common problem with ICS and not something I did wrong. </s>
<s> Thanks, I'll try your suggestion and see if I can't find the offender. </s>
<s> I do have another question about my network, but I'll start a new topic for it. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> A long time ago, there is a virus that do that thing... (You do update your anti virus, don't you?) </s>
<s> Today Spyware or adware might do that (your anti virus, won't detect spyware/adware) Try also using online scan... trendmicro or panda etc. </s>
<s> because I thought that might make it not connect even when I wanted it to. </s>
<s> My anti-virus and anti-spyware applications are up to date, and I scan daily so I don't think that's the problem. </s>
<s> But I guess an online scan couldn't hurt. </s>
<s> Thanks for your suggestions. </s>
<s> Ethereal is free and it might give you insight into the traffic that is triggering the demand for internet connectivity. </s>
