He'll know what your talking about. It may take a little time for him to locate his vintage degauss coil but that should work. He got a lot of practice with it back in the 60's.

I had a tape head demagnetiser which managed to knock most of the magnetic field out of the mask after quite a few passes. They're pretty weak when it comes to degaussing something like this, but after a month, the built in degaussing coil finally cleared the residual magnetism.

I know both my crt's including a 10 year old princeton have an automatic demagnetizing function that can be activated from it's control menu. Or my newer samsung I think does it automatically every power on. Don't know if yours can but might be easier than taking apart and degaussing.
