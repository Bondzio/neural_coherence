<s> I just wanted to know what's the advantages of having a printer that is network ready and one that doesn't? </s>
<s> thank you mike </s>
<s> Network Ready usually means that it has a LAN connection device, such as an HP Jetdirect card in it already. </s>
<s> This lets you connect a cat5 cable to it, connect to a hub or switch and print to an IP address. </s>
<s> No PC is required to be on for this to work. </s>
<s> Some printers may say &quot;ready&quot; or &quot;capable&quot;. </s>
<s> Make sure if you want the LAN connection it does in fact have the LAN (ethernet) connection already installed. </s>
<s> Mikey you asked essentially this same question on July 30, over in Computer Newbies Is there something that the 3 responses there did not answer? </s>
