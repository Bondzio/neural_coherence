I Googled: free &quot;ping utility&quot; regular time interval I got a couple links that may be promising.
I have never used this software, so I don't recommend any of these from experience.
Check it out: http://www.vicman.net/lib/continuous/ping Scroll down to FREEping - Server Pinging 2.0 .
Part of the description reads as follows: FREEping is a free ping software utility which will ping all your IP addresses in free-definable intervals.
FREEping automatically pings in the background and shows statistics for each pinged hosts.
