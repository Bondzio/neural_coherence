i checked one gtx 285 card and it requires: 575w pci express-compliant system power supply with a combined 12v current rating of 42a or more* two 6-pin pci express supplementary power connectors -or- one 6-pin pci express and two 4-pin peripheral supplementary power connectors note: for the power requirements of multiple geforce gtx 285-based graphics cards in an nvidia sli configuration, please visit  *minimum system power requirement based on a pc configured with an intel core i7 965 extreme edition processor bottom line you need to pick a card, get the specific specs and pick a good quality psu ....maybe a 700 or 750w psu.
it pays to have the head room and an efficient psu.
here's one.... 750w by corsair  $99.00 after rebate vapcmd
