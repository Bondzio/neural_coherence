me too.
long ago my pager wasn't working.
during lunch i went to the support line where the nice fellow took my pager, opened it and flipped the battery over.
i guess i should have been watching the show as he did that with about every third person.
&quot;next!&quot; yes, i hung my head after i said my thank you.
