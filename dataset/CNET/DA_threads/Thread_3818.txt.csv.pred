1.1.1	I am a student who uses a laptop heavily - I use it for heavy internet browsing and research and hard core programming .	St
1.1.2	As a student , I also appreciate being able to easily transport the laptop to and from school every day - I also really need the laptop to be durable !	St
1.1.3	On that note , I have narrowed down two laptops that I particularly liked : the Asus UX32A and the Asus S400CA .	St
1.1.4	Both have i3 processors and 500GB of storage ( more than enough ) as well as 4GB of storage ?	Ques
1.1.5	Which laptop would be better for my usage , considering the requirements I listed above ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thank you !	St
1.2.1	Laptops do n't stand up to what durable is defined as .	St
1.2.2	Here 's the dictionary .	St
1.2.3	& quot ; able to withstand wear , pressure , or damage ; hard-wearing. & quot ; I would not subject today 's laptops to pressure or damage .	St
1.2.4	If this is indeed a criteria you have to move to laptops such as the Panasonic Toughbooks .	St
1.2.5	Why not treat it gently ?	Ques
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Based on your requirements , I 'd buy the lightest and/or smallest .	St
1.3.2	But you might have other requirements you did n't state .	St
1.3.3	Kees	St
1.4.1	Do you think that the Asus UX32A might be damaged easily ?	Ques
1.4.2	As a clarification , I am not going to & quot ; throw it around & quot ; and be rough with it .	St
1.4.3	I just want to know if it is able to last as long - I am asking because it seems really thin and might be a tad flimsy .	St
1.4.4	In general , are Ultrabooks good enough to program with and research with ?	Ques
1.4.5	Thank you all for your excellent advice !	Polite
1.5.1	The office has supplied me with a few models .	St
1.5.2	The Asus x202e looks nicely built but just like all the models except for those Toshiba toughbooks I have to be gentle .	St
1.5.3	And let 's call out the battery with it 's 300 cycle rating .	Sug
1.5.4	Let 's say an owner charged it daily to use it on battery power every day .	St
1.5.5	The battery would be worn out in one year ( almost all laptops have this type battery ) so durable is not a word I 'd use here .	St
1.5.6	Bob	St
1.6.1	I am not referring to the Asus X202E model but rather the Asus UX32A and S400CA models .	St
1.6.2	But thank you Bob , for your input on battery .	Polite
1.6.3	I am going to assume therefore that all batteries with most laptops function this way ... Is there anyone who can answer three simple questions - 1 ) Might the UX32A be damaged easily ?	Ques
1.6.4	2 ) Which is better for power - the UX32A or the S400CA ?	Ques
1.6.5	3 ) Which is better for programming - the UX32A or the S400CA ?	Ques
1.7.1	Again , laptops are well known to fail from drops and spills .	St
1.7.2	Today a member is sharing a story about a drop from 1.5 feet and the HDD and other parts have failed .	St
1.7.3	2 .	St
1.7.4	The i5 wins the CPU benchmark round .	St
1.7.5	3 .	St
1.7.6	The 14 inch screen for me .	St
1.7.7	Looking at these closely , they are similar in many ways to the x202e I have from the office .	St
1.7.8	The x202e looks great for hitting the round to do support for our apps .	St
1.7.9	But for programming I 'm back to some 15.6 inch laptop with the usual 16GB RAM , big HDD , etc .	St
1.7.10	Bob	St
1.8.1	Point taken .	St
1.8.2	However , both laptops have an i3 and a 13.3 inch screen is just as good as one with an 14 inch screen .	St
1.8.3	Keeping this in mind , which is more suitable for programming and which might be faster ?	Ques
1.9.1	http : //www.cnet.com/laptops/asus-vivobook-s400ca/4505-3121_7-35547535.html notes an i5 and 15 inch screen .	St
1.9.2	Sadly it appears you have left out the EXACT model so I took a chance and used the first CNET review I found on each model .	St
1.9.3	I would find a 13 inch screen too small .	St
1.9.4	Here 's a setup I used before and similar today .	St
1.9.5	Link follows .	St
1.9.6	Bob - & gt ; http : //i175.photobucket.com/albums/w146/rproffitt2000/desktop2.jpg	St
1.10.1	Awesome - thank you !	Polite
1.10.2	!	St
1.11.1	NIL	St
