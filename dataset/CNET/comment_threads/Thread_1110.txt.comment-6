A print shop I know in Vancouver, BC never paid for such printers.
These were those monsters you know are in the 5 figure range so rather than bet the business on that they rented or leased them.
That also cured issues of repair since the lease included maintenance calls and more.
-&gt; What this also did was make sure the printing income paid the costs of these printers.
If the market or sales didn't support such a printer they could end the lease.
