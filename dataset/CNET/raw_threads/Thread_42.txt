I am using a pretty old computer at the moment and they would like to update me. I usually use a Mac, and am not sure how to go about finding an appropriate PC for my functions. I will generally be running Photoshop, Illustrator and indesign all at once as well as the other standard office applications to run email and word processing. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I need in a PC, Monitor and or laptop.

I use Adobe CS5 with no slow downs no matter what I throw at it. Also get at least 6 gig of Ram. Mine has 12 gig, but I think that is a little overkill. Mine is Tri Channel Ram. I know there is a debate about tri channel being no faster or better than the duel channel, But I disagree with that. As for the monitor, get a 22' or bigger LED monitor. They throw off very little heat and have a better picture than the LCDs. Also get a good graphics card in the computer. For the little added expense, you won't be sorry.
