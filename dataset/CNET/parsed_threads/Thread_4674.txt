<s> Anyone know which replacement fan will work for an Interage GeForce FX5200 AGP video card? </s>
<s> Mine is seriously whining and I would like to order a replacement. </s>
<s> Not sure about sizes, best brands, who sells etc. </s>
<s> The original one that is on it is clear plastic mounted on an aluminum heatsink. </s>
<s> Video card vendors differ amongest themselves when using the same chipset, so it really depends. </s>
<s> Here is a link, but you need to guess or estimate what should work for you. </s>
<s> http://www.directron.com/cpu---coolers-cpu-coolers.html Google for more as there are alot of vendors out there. </s>
<s> Its a good chance you have a 50mm fan. </s>
<s> On top of that, vendors vary how they attach and that can cause havoc. </s>
<s> Sometimes, I get lucky and I'm able to relube the fan, doing this: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ If you have a noisy fan and no replacement, try the following. </s>
<s> Remove fan from mounting and save screws or unclip the fan. </s>
<s> Clean any dust or dirt build-up at this time as best as possible. </s>
<s> Now with fan in hand, most fans have a sticker(s) top or bottom. </s>
<s> Look for the non-fan blade side, this is the bottom. </s>
<s> On bottom side slice small half-moon cut, slightly off-center on the sticker/decal leaving a flap. </s>
<s> You *don't* want to remove sticker/decal entirely. </s>
<s> Flip flap open to expose center of fan and place 1 drop of oil there, don't over do it, blot any excess oil. </s>
<s> Rotate the fan to work the oil in and then place fan with bottom side up on a flat surface. </s>
<s> Allow gravity to migrate oil into bearing for 30-minutes or over night if possible.When done, tape over the cut flap and remount fan. </s>
<s> Use deft care and don't over-tighten screws, you're done. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Willy, Thanks, all very good info. </s>
<s> I ordered a replacement specific to the GeForce FX5200 with a copper heatsink and 50,000 hr rated fan. </s>
<s> I had a choice of a bigger heatsink or heatsink/fan combo. </s>
<s> I'll try the fan combo again and see what happens. </s>
<s> I've extended the life of a few fans in the past using your method, though not quite as professionally done. </s>
<s> Its cheaper to replace when you can find them. </s>
<s> This one was an odd size, cut to fit the existing heatsink. </s>

<s> John, I just lubed the whining fan in my GeForce FX5200. </s>
<s> That may take care of it for a while but I'd like to know what fan you purchased to replace the one on your card. </s>
<s> My fan is located in a rectangular aluminum heat sink with a circular opening in the middle for the 1.5'' (38mm) fan. </s>
<s> I know it's been quite some time since your post but any assistance would be appreciated. </s>
