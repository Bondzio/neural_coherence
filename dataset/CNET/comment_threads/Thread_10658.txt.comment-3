Despite all the bad rap they get, you will get a great system and as you already know, at a great price.
Their Tech support is definitely not top notch, but they do get the job done.
I know because that's where I oredered my system from, and I shopped for several months seeking out the best bang for the buck.
The closest price I found for the same exact components and configuration was still $1800 more than what I paid at Cyberpower.
I am very happy with my system, I have used their tech support and although it took longer than I wanted to spend on the phone, they took care of me, and to be honest my system F'in rocks.
Sit tight, you will be happy in the end...
