i just purchased a wd 500gb external drive.
i know nothing about working with them, but want to use it mainly for backups and also store photos and music.
first, i would like to know just what i actually need to back up and how often.i won't need any office information,just general uses.
also there is little information about how to back up.
i need to learn from scratch the very basics.
would appreciate any help and information anyone can give me.
thanks in advance.
