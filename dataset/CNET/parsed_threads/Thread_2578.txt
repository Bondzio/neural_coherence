<s> I've decided to buy a refurbished Refurbished iMac 20-inch 2.4GHz with 1GB of memory and 320GB hard drive. </s>
<s> I know refurbished iMacs work fine because my friend has one and he says there is no difference. </s>
<s> But the one problem I had was with the low memory. </s>
<s> I have these questions about that topic: -Do you think it's a good idea to add an extra stick of RAM? </s>

<s> -Will there be a difference in speed? </s>
<s> I really appreciate your advice, Thanks! </s>
