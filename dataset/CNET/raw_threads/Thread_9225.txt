I know this is an older card than the 9250 so I assumed this would be fine but just want to make sure what others thing. Here is a list of things connected to my motherboard of cource the motherboard will use some power. 2 CD drives one is CD-RW one is DVD player 20gb hard drive Floppy drive 56K V92 fax modem Wireless adapter PCI My system specs 1 gHz Celeron 512mb PC100 ram 20GB hard drive Intel 3D Direct AGP AC'97 sound card Windows XP Home SP3 I hope the ATI Radeon 7200 PCI will work on this machine. Thank You

I find most owners are unhappy about the state of affairs that Windows is in. That is, after a decade of XP look at the amount of work required for driver installations. I can't predict if your OS is in good enough shape to accept the driver CD without issue. Bob
