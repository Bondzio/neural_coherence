Basically i want a tablet that HAS to be 10+ inches (So no small nexus 7's (Don't see the point in a small tablet) And i would like it too be pretty quick. So dual core and some sort of tegra. But the main thing (Unless you can persuade me otherwise) is i want a high res screen. (I played on my friends ipad 2 and being able to see the pixels really annoyed me) The best fit i can find is the nexus 10,. however it's out of my price range.

We got to try the cheaps, that is the ones half the cost of a Nexus and lower and always came away with issues. Now those that buy such have their reasons but for now I think the bottom end is the Nexus and the rest is for folk that have a budget to meet. That is, they have to compromise what they want to meet the budget. The iPad with retina is great too. And take another look at the Kindles. Remember you didn't tell what use this is. A rather poor and now poorer student thought it could stand in for a laptop! Ouch! Bob

Got it at this reltd.org website and have never had any problems. Plus you dont need to tell anyone you didnt pay 200 odd quid for it lol
