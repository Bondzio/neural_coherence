<s> My HP Pavilion 750N went out. </s>
<s> The monitor is blank and the pc just beeps for about 5 seconds, pause, beeps for 5 seconds, pause and etc. </s>
<s> There is no short/long beeps, just one standard beep. </s>
<s> I tried pressing the F keys to no avail. </s>
<s> I noticed the power supply fan was not working and replaced the power supply. </s>
<s> I also replaced the RAM, since I was planning to upgrade. </s>
<s> Again, the same beep with nothing on the monitor (no signal). </s>
<s> I took out the RAM and made sure the new RAMS were seated properly to no avail. </s>
<s> I tried to ensure no dust inside and it looks clean inside. </s>
<s> I put back the old RAM, just in case the new RAM were incompatible, again to no avail. </s>
<s> I took out the video card and RAM and started up the PC, but only get the same beep. </s>
<s> Since I did notice the power supply fan was not working, but the CPU fan was working. </s>
<s> Nonetheless, is it possible the CPU or motherboard is fried? </s>
<s> Any help greatly appreciated, as I'm a novice. </s>
<s> Here's the original specs: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&docname=bph07045#N751 </s>
<s> Open it up and gently press the cards back into place. </s>
<s> If the machine was neglected (failed fans) then all bets are off about what failed. </s>
<s> What spares do you have? </s>
<s> The beep sequence is your clue to what ails the system. </s>
<s> Since, you know the beep sequence then find the bios maker and allow it to tell you. </s>
<s> Because, your system is constant and you'll noted the cpu working but not the PSU, then its either a bad PSU(test it) or the mtrbd. </s>
<s> to include the cpu itself. </s>
<s> Now, it really appears like a total failure, IMHO. </s>
<s> Google for the bios error code for beeps. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I fixed the PC this morning. </s>
<s> It was the RAM issue. </s>
<s> The power supply was broken (fan wouldn't work), so the power supply did need replacing. </s>
<s> However, I was also upgrading the RAM and it appears the new RAM cards (I have two of them) are incompatible. </s>
<s> I tested each one and it gave the same beep. </s>
<s> I replaced with the old RAM and my PC is working. </s>
<s> I did this earlier, but I must not have seated it properly, as I put one old card back in at a time and now it's working again. </s>
<s> I'll try to return or exchange the RAM card, if possible. </s>
<s> Thank you for your feedback. </s>
