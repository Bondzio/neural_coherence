I have been very happy with the color prints produced on the R800, until recently.
I'm getting a blue/green tint to all black and white prints, regardless of whether or not I &quot;remove color&quot;, take saturation to &quot;0&quot;, or do both.
I've always used the Epson ink.
At this point, I've exhausted the traditional options to correct the probelm (ran all the utility clean-up prodcedures).
Any suggestions?
