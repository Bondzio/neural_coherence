1.1.1	My daughter just bought a large Ide harddrive.	St
1.1.2	When we opened up her new computer I found there is a SATA harddrive installed.	St
1.1.3	Is there anyway to use this IDE harddrive on her system without removing her cd drive and dvd writer?	St
1.1.4	If not, can we get an external usb harddrive case for the new harddrive?	St
1.1.5	We are unfamiliar with sata drives.	St
1.1.6	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	The best of my knowledge, you need to buy a pci ide adapter (not expensive).	St
1.2.2	The you can install up to 4 ide devices.	St
1.3.1	If so, as pboothe says, you can buy a PCI card to give 2 more ports [4 drives].	St
1.3.2	You can also buy SATA to IDE adapters that plug into the IDE drive.	St
1.3.3	Do a google search to find some.	St
1.3.4	They adapt both the power and signal inputs.	St
1.3.5	I have no experience actually using one though.	St
1.4.1	Yes, that is also an option.	St
