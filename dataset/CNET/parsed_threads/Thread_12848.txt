<s> No, Secondary Master, Secondary Slave, show as none at the first screen at boot up </s>
<s> How do I enable the IDE ports? </s>
<s> I have the Secondary Master and Secondary Slave set as auto, if set up to cd-rom the outcome is the same, none detected. </s>
<s> Look around for IDE settings. </s>
<s> Sometimes you find someone has disabled the secondary ports. </s>

<s> the BIOS ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Now how do I go about and do that? </s>
<s> If the BIOS screen isn't reporting it, then you've either disabled the port, blown the port, has the cables in wrong, bad cable or &quot;other.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> &quot;ON BOARD PCI IDE ENABLE: BOTH&quot; shows on the chip set, on the primary screen shows secondary master & slave as auto </s>
<s> How exactly can I check if the port is disabled, I can not find anything refering for secondary diabled, I already changed the cable, blown? </s>

<s> Try just one CD drive jumpered as MA and installed on the end of the data cable. </s>
<s> Does it show in BIOS? </s>
<s> Now try just the other CD drive jumpered as MA and at the end of data the cable. </s>
<s> Does it show in BIOS? </s>
<s> Repeat above steps, but jumper the CD drive as CS. </s>
<s> Result? </s>
<s> ASIDE: Just to make sure, are you connecting both the data cable and a power cable to the drives? </s>

<s> You didn't reveal the gritty details of IDE cable type, jumpers so let's jump into the thick of it. </s>
<s> Let's remove one CD/DVD drive and use only one drive. </s>
<s> Let's jumper it as MASTER and put it on the end of the IDE cable. </s>
<s> The other end goes to the Secondary IDE port. </s>
<s> You can not use any RAID or FASTPORT or other port on a sound card (details matter.) </s>
<s> Once booted the drive must be able to open and close with the front eject button. </s>
<s> This is a power and other test. </s>
<s> The drive should be listed on the BIOS screen. </s>
<s> No? </s>
<s> Try the other CD/DVD drive as MASTER and repeat. </s>
