yes, i found i had posted in the wrong place, but could not see how to delete the first one.
i have used other logitech devices and was satisfied.
will the camera come with software so that if i bought two i could connect with my daughter, or will we have to use messenger, icq, yahoo etc.?
if so, which one of those should i use?
