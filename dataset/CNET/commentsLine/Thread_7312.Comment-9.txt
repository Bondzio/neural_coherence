i did test that with the cable tester, it was all good, this coupler is a straight thru shot.
i also used another wall jack as well.
still the same results.
it just seems to be very difficult.
the only other thing i can think of is that the cable tester has gone bad.
but i have been using it for some time with no problems.
just wired up an entire office with it, and everything was a go.
no problems at all.
