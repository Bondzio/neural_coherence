No Bob, I'm aware that the Paperwhite has a backlight, I just haven't found any other devices that really provide the same kind of user experience.
I was hoping, prior to purchasing anything, that I might get a bit of insight from users of other devices.
Perhaps there is another device that I'm unfamiliar with, that could satisfy my requirements?
