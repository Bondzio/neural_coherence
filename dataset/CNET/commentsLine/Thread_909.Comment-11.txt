...but to answer your question about the d: partition: for some odd reason, asus splits the hard drives in their netbooks into 2 similar sized partitions.
there is a third, hidden, and much smaller partition used for system recovery.
you can use something like easeus partition manager to change the size and number of partitions on a drive.
