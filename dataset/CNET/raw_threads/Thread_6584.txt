Hi all, &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;I have a Virgin Media Super Hub with a 60mpbs connection in my study on the first floor. The hub is connected to my NAS and my laptop, both wired. Wireless is disabled on the VM Super Hub, but it is not running in modem mode since I need access to the extra LAN ports. &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;A gigabit cable runs from the study to the living room on the ground floor where it is connected to the LAN port on a TP-Link n router. There are three devices connected to the router, again wired. This router acts as my wireless hub for all the devices in the house (approx 10 devices in all). I use only the TP-Link as the wireless router since its performance far exceeds that of the Super Hub. &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Unfortunately, none of the routers are dual-band. Now that I have a couple of dual-band capable devices, if I enable 5Ghz on the VM Super Hub and retaing the 2.4Ghz on the TP-link, will I get the benefits of dual band? If not, what would I need to configure in order to achieve that? Do they need to have the same SSID? &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Many thanks. &lt;span&gt;DSG

You never revealed that. I find that having a dual band helps since we know that WiFi is half duplex (sorry if I don't define all tech terms) and that means only one device can transfer a packet at a time in only one direction. Having a second WiFi channel (you may call this dual band) means we doubled our WiFi capacity. Bob
