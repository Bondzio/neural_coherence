1.1.1	I bought my son upgraded & quot ; Bot & quot ; right when they were bought out by Dell .	St
1.1.2	The video card went out first , which I had upgraded .	St
1.1.3	Then the Fans , now the power supply , I think .	St
1.1.4	The fans were getting noisy , and the pc would overheat .	St
1.1.5	We kept it clean , and free of dust , and plenty of ventillation .	St
1.1.6	Now it wo n't even boot up , or come on .	St
1.1.7	Does anyone have any suggestions for me about replacing the fans , and power supply myself ?	Ques
1.1.8	I really ca n't afford to spend any more money on this thing , and it is only two years old .	St
1.1.9	He is wanting to get an Alienware Laptop , but I want more information before we spend another damn dime with them .	St
1.1.10	HELP !	St
1.2.1	*post the original specs and your upgrades sometimes newer graphics cards and other components generate a prodigious amount of heat ( the 4870X2 comes to mind as a recent example ) *is your psu big enough to support the components under full load suggestion : you pay for the Alienware case , like Apple fans pay for the Apple logo , but ask yourself , do you need it ?	Sug
1.3.1	Please note , it 's still a Dell .	St
1.3.2	Their reputation amongst the IT community is horrible .	St
1.3.3	They seem to have a decent reputation with consumers , but you will NEVER see a Dell under the desk of someone doing graphic intensive work .	St
1.3.4	Your problem sounds like a serious heat problem .	St
1.3.5	Dell is n't known for complying with the laws of thermodynamics , thus they engineer failure into their systems .	St
1.3.6	Neat huh ?	Ques
1.3.7	Unfortunately for those who believed Alienware was doing things with computing , other companies could n't do , Dell has made that theory fact .	St
1.3.8	No REPUTABLE system builder would build as cheaply as Dell does .	St
1.3.9	I 'm an A+ Certified account manager with Microsel of Colorado who has been building and selling high-end graphics workstations and servers for the past 10 years and have absorbed Dell 's intelligent customers looking for high-end machines quite easily because when you build custom with a QUALIFIED system builder you get much better support , much better product , and far better pricing .	St
1.3.10	Every time I spec high-end machines , I go straight to Dell and config a comparable machine ( I say comparable because Dell does n't offer the same quality motherboard , memory , cooling , ensure matching batch codes on RAM or matching Firmware on RAID arrays ) yet , I 'm always about $ 1,000 less .	St
1.3.11	That sort of price difference definitely depends on the shop you 're buying from as smaller shops do n't buy in the Volume we do .	St
1.3.12	Our company is an Intel Mobile Channel Leader , Intel Authorized Integrator , and Microsoft Gold Certified Partner .	St
1.3.13	We buy upwards of $ 1m/month in product so really , there 's nobody physically near us in price .	St
1.3.14	Do some research on a good local custom system builder and have them build your next machines .	St
1.3.15	The warranties and service are typically better or at least equal to the big box nonsense .	St
1.3.16	For reference , on the laptop your kid wants , I quoted a 17 & quot ; notebook with Intel X25-E Solid State boot drive , Quad Core processor , 8GB of RAM , 320GB SATA Storage Drive , A/G/N wireless , bluetooth , and Vista Ultimate and it came in around $ 2300 ( $ 1200 ) less than anyone I could find who 's system could even be close to considered & quot ; comparable & quot ; .	St
1.3.17	Good luck with that Dell in the meantime though .	Polite
1.3.18	Take a look at where it 's being stored , if it 's in a cabinet , there 's your answer .	St
1.3.19	If your kid throws is clothes on it , there 's your answer .	St
1.3.20	If one of your fans are out , again , there 's your answer .	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
