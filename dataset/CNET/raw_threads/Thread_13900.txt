I attempted a restart after removing a program and it gave me a BSOD. When I attempted to restart in safe mode, it locked up on the mup.sys. I had this happen once before and was able to resolve it by booting from the recovery discs. However, this time, when I went to boot from the recovery discs, it would not even do that. I removed the disc and was going to retrieve the important files I had created since my last backup by placing it in a hdd enclosure and attaching to another computer, but when I do, the primary partition asks to be formatted before use and shows 0 bytes used. Does anybody have a good idea of how to proceed? Thanks Brian

If the information is available, it will help you to get it retrieved. I would then expect to get a new hard drive and use the recovery discs to return the PC to operating condition. I do not see a mention of what PC this is in other than Windows XP Pro but since there are recovery discs, I have to assume it is from a major manufacturer like Dell, HP, Gateway? There may be a way to do a repair install, if more info is provided.

It echoes something I helped create years ago at http://tips.oncomputers.info/archives2004/0401/2004-Jan-11.htm Today it is even better and EASIER than ever. If that fails, try ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY and GETDATABACK. Use google to find those titles. If these fail, the next stop is http://www.drivesavers.com Bob

The error message that I got when I first tried to mount the disk was: &quot;Unable to mount location DBus error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply: Did not receive a reply. Possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken.&quot; When I went through the steps and tried to force a mount anyway, I got an error message to the tone of: &quot;DBus error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply: Did not receive a reply. Possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken.&quot; I did some digging around and found another similar idea from howtogeek http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/15761/recover-data-like-a-forensics-expert-using-an-ubuntu-live-cd/ that uses the testdisk utility. I will give that a shot. Further thoughts? Brian
