1.1.1	I want to max out my Gigabyte 7IXE4 motherboard.	St
1.1.2	I currently have a Duron 850Mhz and want to go up to a 1.4Ghz.	St
1.1.3	Yes I know it still isn't that fast, but getting a new motherboard is not an option.	St
1.1.4	I wanted an Athlon Thunderbird 1.4Ghz, but I'm not sure if I'll even be able to find one anywhere.	St
1.1.5	There's the Duron 1.4Ghz, but that would require a BIOS upgrade, which I've never done before and could be risky.	St
1.1.6	My mom also uses this computer for important things so if I were to mess it up it would be hell.	St
1.1.7	There's also the option of an AthlonXP, but I'm not sure if the motherboard will support it.	St
1.1.8	The FAQ on the Gigabyte website says that the board supports Duron and AthlonXPs, but on the same website there is a processor compatibility chart that doesn't list any of the XPs as compatible.	St
1.1.9	I'm not really sure what to do and could use some advice as to the best path.	Sug
1.1.10	Thanks Adam	Polite
1.2.1	I made this jump 2 years ago.	St
1.2.2	Big difference between Duron850 and Athlon T-Bird.	St
1.2.3	Here is a 1.33&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp?description=19-103-156&depa=1 While you should hone up on your knowledge of hardware.	St
1.2.4	I wouldn't recommend a rookie to perform this task.	St
1.3.1	In short.	St
1.3.2	1.	St
1.3.3	BIOS Update.	St
1.3.4	It's something I've done many times (2^9 times?)	St
1.3.5	and for me has never lost a board.	St
1.3.6	2.	St
1.3.7	If it doesn't list the XP, then it's not going to support it.	St
1.3.8	But did I look at the wrong board at http://www.giga-byte.com/Motherboard/Support/CPUSupportList/CPUSupportList_GA-7IXE4.htm since it lists some XP CPUs.	St
1.3.9	3.	St
1.3.10	I don't see a lot of these CPUs out there either.	St
1.3.11	http://www.compgeeks.com/products.asp?cat=CPU#Socket%20A%20CPUs%20 (Duron) But you may want to be sure your power supply has the Watts and you also will be fitting a new proper sized CPU HeatSink and Fan (HSF)	St
1.4.1	.	St
1.5.1	Thanks Tharpeli, but unfortunately I live in Canada.	St
1.5.2	I think I will upgrade my BIOS and then see what the local tech shop can do.	St
1.5.3	R. Proffitt, I was just curious as to what method you use to upgrade the BIOS.	St
1.5.4	The Gigabyte website has three utilities, one updates from the operating system, one searches the internet and the other is through DOS.	St
1.5.5	I just want some more advice because I really don't want to screw this up.	St
