<s> I have a USB Enclosure that I put a hardrive from an old machine running windows 2000. </s>
<s> The new machine is XP and when I connect the drive and it only detects the first of the two partitions. </s>
<s> Is there something I need to do for XP to detect the second partition? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> You are lucky to see even the first partition. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> Drives don't always move to such and retain their contents. </s>
<s> Issues abound. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> There are other than Windows 2000 partitioning tools that could have been used and such will cause issues when you move the drive. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> There is an issue with XP and Windows 2000 partitions noted in some Microsoft Article. </s>
<s> Microsoft nonchalantly asks that you backup, recreate the partition and restore the data. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> You may have XP and not XP SP1. </s>
<s> Or even XP SP2. </s>
<s> I have an external USB 160GB drive and with plain XP, only 137GB is usuable. </s>
<s> XP SP1 gets the full 160GB support, but CHKDSK fails. </s>
<s> Finally at XP SP2, the full size is supported and CHKDSK works. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
