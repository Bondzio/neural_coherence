No red light and pointer did not move. Steps I have taken taken to make it work. Removed Logitech mouse and installed the original mouse with out the adapter, that did not work either. Also checked for bent pins (OK) Reinstalled the Logitech on a open USB. It worked. The mouse worked fine yesterday but not today. I would like to find why it did not work and how to fix. Thanks Joe

Then I would scan for the pests using the tools listed here: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6132-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=1313&start=0

The serial port doesn't have the power to run such a mouse. Yes, you can buy USB or PS2 to RS232 adapters or find such, but I think you've found such an adapter and was hoping it would work. Bob

I guess I was lucky to have the optical mouse last a year in a standard mouse port. I will leave it the way it is with the optical mouse in the USB. As Bob says &quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot; Thanks again.
