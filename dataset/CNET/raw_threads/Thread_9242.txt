The only game that I play on it is World of WarCraft: Wrath of the Litch King. Currently I have a ATI All-In-Wonder 2006 256MB Video card (Radeon 9600). I have to play the game at the lowest settings and would like to find a card that will allow me to play it at the best settings and be able to handle updates to the game. The cards that I have looked at are: XFX GeForce 8400 GS Video Card - 512MB PNY GeForce 8600 GT Video Card - 512MB DDR2 XFX GeForce 8500 GT Ultra Silent Cooling Video Card - 512MB DDR2 BFG Tech BFGE851024GTE GeForce 8500 GT 1GB HIS Hightech H260XTP512DDN-R Radeon HD 2600XT 512MB Most of the reviews are not from gamers and the ones that are do not always list PC specs. I heard that nVidia is better for gaming, so I'm leaning that way. Any thoughts on which of these or any other cards I should buy? My PC Specs: Gateway GT5032 with modifications ( http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/gateway-gt5032-media-center/4507-3118_7-31801238.html?tag=mncol;rnav ) WinXP MCE 2005 AMD Athlon X2 2.2GHz 2GB RAM ATI All-in-Wonder 2006 256MB video card 160GB & 250GB HDs

And most 9 series are PCI Express 2.0. The only card that is 9 series and PCI Express 1.0 is: Galaxy 95TGE8HUFEXX GeForce 9500 GT 1GB (Newegg.com $82) But according to this post, I can use PCI-e 2.0 in my PC: http://forum.desktopreview.com/showthread.php?t=236596 This seems like it might be a recipe for disaster putting a PCI-e 2.0 card in there. Or at the very least it won't function properly. If this is true, then Id get something like this: EVGA 01G-P3-N959-TR GeForce 9500 GT 1GB (Newegg.com $70) ASUS EN9500GT TOP/DI/512M GeForce 9500 GT 512MB (Newegg.com $80) Galaxy GeForce 9600 GT Video Card - 1GB DDR3, (TigerDriect.com $105) Any thoughts appreciated.

It is not a recipe for disaster since they designed this so it should always work. HOWEVER I can't speak to those that have trouble but when we dive in we find people that can't install drivers. bob

My other worry about this is that the card won't operate to benchmarks b/c of the limitations in interface. To Ramarc: For the price and the graphs my belief of nVidia is better than ATI for gaming is changing. Is it safe to assume that the performance charts did not have the video cards paired? I'll probably go with the 4830 unless anyone else has an opinion. Thanks to you both for your help!

7641	8	328653	2971141	2970855	Phntm3	2/4/09 12:05 PM	1.2337491E12	Power Issues	Doing further research on the 2 cards requirements brought up this: 4670 = http://ati.amd.com/products/radeonhd4600/requirements.html 4830 = http://ati.amd.com/products/Radeonhd4800/requirements.html My PC specs: http://support.gateway.com/s/PC/R/5878/5878sp3.shtml The 4830 needs a 450W power supply and the 4670 a 400W power supply. If I were to get either of these cards, then would I be able to run them since I have a 300W power supply? And if I need a new power supply, what do you think of this: LOGISYS Computer PS575XBK 575W ATX12V SLI Ready Power Supply (Newegg $30)
7641	9	328653	2971142	2971107	Phntm3	2/4/09 12:11 PM	1.23374946E12	I mean...	I wondered if they were paired, as in 2 of the same video cards linked together. I'm not up on the SLI/Crossfire technologies, so I don't know how else to explain it. I just wanted to make sure that the data was from a standalone card and not 2 of them linked together. I don't have 2 PCI-e slots...so I can only put one in there, nor do I feel like upgrading this PC much more other than a new video card and maybe power supply. Next time I'm making one.
7641	10	328653	2971460	2971141	ramarc	2/4/09 5:43 PM	1.23376938E12	the hd 4830 would require a new power supply	but the hd 4670 shouldn't. video card power supply recommendations are estimates. the hd 4670 does not require a pci-e connector -- it draws all of it's power from the pci-e slot. a pci-e slot must provide up to 75 watts of power so generally if a card doesn't have a seperate power connector, it doesn't need a big power supply either. gateway uses pretty good power supplies so i'd leave it be. here's an article on the actual power draw of PCs using various video cards (as you can see, the hd 4670 only draws 60w and thus doesn't require a seperate pci-e power connector): http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-radeon-power,2122-6.html p.s.: the benchmarks are sent earlier are for single card configurations.
