1.4.1	It really depends what your doing with your computer .	St
1.4.2	The FX will definatly be better for high-end gaming that is single threaded , however , the dual core CPU 's like the X2 will not be as fast for gaming due to lower clock speeds and inablility to overclock as well .	St
1.4.3	The X2 would be great for multitasking , such as photo/video editting , 3d rendering , encoding music/videos things like that ...	St
1.4.4	The FX would be great for single threaded applications such as video games .	St
1.5.1	Yes but overclocking a 3800 x2 to 2.7Ghz will rip through games without any trouble and gives you the dual core power as well .	St
1.5.2	The FX is n't worth the money anymore .	St
