<s> I have a Gateway GT 5622 desktop and for a month now its been giving me problems. </s>
<s> I have 3 hard drives in the system (2 SATA and 1 IDE slaved) I noticed the IDE drive was taking a long time to access so i restarted the pc and got a Floppy COntroller Failure error. </s>
<s> I finially got past that screen but as the systemm was powering up i noticed the power button LED had started blinking. </s>
<s> It would blink once quickly and not blink again for around 30 seconds or longer. </s>
<s> Sometimes it would blink once and then twice very quickly. </s>
<s> I disconnected the IDE drive and started up the PC again and still got the floppy error. </s>
<s> This continued for about 2 weeks (with no help from Gateway because I'm out of warranty). </s>
<s> During those 2 weeks the power led was still blinking but soon after i noticed 3 sets of blinkning. </s>
<s> It would blink once, stay steady for around 10 seconds, blink 3 times, then right after 2 times real quickly. </s>
<s> Gateway refuses to tell me what the blinking could mean, if its the motheboard, power supply, cpu or cpu fan. </s>
<s> I deccided to try a few suggestionns i found after searching online, pulled all connections, bios battery and ram, blow out any dust in fans and coonected components one by one. </s>
<s> When it came to connecting the IDE drive no floppy error, connected the second SATA (w/o the OS) no error, connected with OS error. </s>
<s> Disconneccted and connected the IDE again it gave me error and so did the other SATA now. </s>
<s> Inn the midst of doing all of this noticed the CPU fan slowinng downn, speeding up real fast on a cycle and all i was doing was connecting parts. </s>
<s> I'm at my end here, Gateway cannt even do me the courtesy to tell me waht blinkning means (they suggestedd i do a factory recovery or replace the hard drive). </s>
<s> When i get passt the Floppy Failure screen the pc is slow, sometimes it hangs when i move the mouse or open IE or a folder. </s>
<s> Im thinking its the motherboard, but cant be sure. </s>
<s> My SATA hard drives are brand new only 6 months old. </s>
<s> I'd really appreciate any help, sorry this is so long. </s>
<s> GATEWAY GT 5622 Windows Vista 3 GB Ram 1TB SATA 500GB SATA 500GB IDE </s>
<s> I'd move it back to stock or 1 hard drive since the power supply sounds to be under strain of the added drives. </s>
<s> The floppy error is something I'd disable in the BIOS. </s>
<s> Here we copied off all the floppy material to a 2GB memory stick then pulled all the floppy drives out of the office since support was killing our budget. </s>
<s> We don't let the staff know we keep some USB floppy drive around just in case someone turns up with that dead medium. </s>

<s> I'm pretty sure heat has taken your PSU down. </s>
<s> The demands of 3 HDs is alot for the OEM Gateway PSU, so its taken its toll. </s>
<s> Replace with a higher wattage unit and of a decent name brand one. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I noticed that my sound card driver no long working and wont reinstall. </s>
<s> Also it keeps asking me to install my flash player again and again after it tells me its installed. </s>
<s> Result in new and wonderful errors. </s>
<s> I've watched folk chase down error after error and it all lead back to the power supply. </s>
<s> I'd pull the machine back to stock (one hard drive) and disable, remove the floppy drive. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I dont have a floppy drive. </s>
<s> The system has built in card reader. </s>
<s> I disabled the floppy in the bios. </s>
<s> I can't find a manual for the system under discussion. </s>
<s> Try setting the floppy type to none. </s>
<s> Some BIOSes will issue an error if we have the floppy set to some type and in another page have the floppy controller disabled. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> sounds like you have about 350-400 watts and may be pushing it to hard. </s>
<s> go back back to stock configuration or upgrade power supply BUT check to make sure you do not have a proprietary PSU.. </s>
<s> MANY off the &quot;shelf&quot; machines are powered just enough to run as they are designed. </s>
<s> with about 20% to spare for usb or what ever. </s>
<s> in other words for the most part they are almost maxed out right from the start. </s>
<s> sounds like you have a corrupt file system or even virus. </s>
<s> as for floppy get into bios and on basic settings many times where you set clock, disable floppy or remove. </s>
<s> save and exit. </s>
<s> I put everything back to stock. </s>
<s> 1 hard drive, 1 cdrom, even reset bios to default and shut off the floppy controller. </s>
<s> Still the LED blinking and pc sluggish. </s>
<s> I even noticed that after defaulting the bios, i saw the audion controller was shut off. </s>
<s> Can all of these problems be because of the motherboard? </s>
<s> I dont see why defautling the bios would shut off audio controller. </s>
<s> Is there any way to be sure it the MB? </s>
<s> What are my options here? </s>
<s> FYI: Power supply is 300 watts. </s>
<s> Sound card integrated Video intergrated. </s>
<s> Let's read about how XP degrades the IDE speed with each error. </s>
<s> It's up to us to flip it back to speed. </s>
<s> Read and do -&gt; http://winhlp.com/node/10 </s>
<s> I have the same Gateway GT5622 and the symptoms you describe above are exactly what I am experiencing. </s>
<s> I have same config except for 500GB IDE drive (yes, I also installed a 1TB SATA drive) I recently replaced my CPU fan as the old fan was making a loud noise and I could hear the fan speed fluctuating too much. </s>
<s> The first 2 weeks with the new fan was fine and now this issue of &quot;floppy error&quot; while booting up. </s>
<s> Probably I have to start-shut the computer 10 times before one of the attempts results in it booting up. </s>
<s> Also my on switch LED light no longer stays on. </s>
<s> Last 2 days I am afraid to shut my computer down. </s>
<s> Have you found the optimum bios settings or did you have to change power supply as someone above suggests. </s>
<s> I really appreciate your reply. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance </s>
