<s> Someone please help me because I am going nuts The problems involve my HP C7200 printer. </s>
<s> It is on my home network. </s>
<s> 1)The printer randomly goes off line for no reason what so ever. </s>
<s> It is very annoying. </s>
<s> The pop up states it is off line while I am doing something important and it sometimes it causes what I am doing to minimize its window. </s>
<s> It just happened. </s>
<s> And it will not stop until I check that the printer is online. </s>
<s> Which I never took off line in the first place. </s>
<s> After I check that a little while later the same pop up states the printer is once again offline. </s>
<s> 2)I looked around for solutions and it looks like I should go to the Printer properties and then port and then go to configure and enable or disable SNMP. </s>
<s> Well when I click on configure I get &quot;error was caused during port configuration Access Denied.&quot; Please some one help me. </s>
<s> It is a home network just 2 laptops and a PC and a Roko and one printer on it. </s>
<s> I am running Vista Premium. </s>
<s> This is very frustrating because in just the little time I took to write this that pop up saying my printer is off line came up 3 times. </s>
<s> And help will be appriciated. </s>
<s> I'll just share that I don't have this issue with my WIRED connections and rarely with wifi. </s>
<s> Remember that wifi is not reliable so let's do what we can to get it as good as can be. </s>
<s> That is, follow the advice in the Networking forum. </s>
<s> Good luck, Bob </s>
<s> Thanks I will look over there. </s>
<s> I also contacted HP because I think it is a problem with them. </s>
<s> HP should never allowed WEP use on wifi. </s>
<s> It's too easy for neighbors to interfere and kids to smack down such a setup. </s>
<s> Go get em! </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Assuming that this is the 7280 hp unit that came out a few years ago. </s>
<s> Did the unit disk have the Win Vista drivers? </s>
<s> Some did and some didn't, if not you would have to download the patch from HP. </s>
<s> As Bob stated, wirless hook ups can be erratic, not as stable as hard wire. </s>
<s> Proximity is also an issue and there are server issues, signal and bandwidth variations can make a difference. </s>
<s> Late yesterday I decide to go on Chat with a HP tech after having no luck whatsoever at it website to see if there were any alerts for my printer or new drivers. </s>
<s> Well it turns out there are two critical updates for HP Printers for this very problem: 1) Critical Update to Correct a PC to Printer Communication Issue http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=oj-67880-1&lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&lang=en&os=2100&product=3204785 2)Critical Update to Enhance Reliability of Network and USB Connectivity and Improve System Responsiveness While Printing&quot;. </s>
<s> Nobody knows about this until you actually get a hold of the tech. </s>
<s> If you go to the page where my printer is at there are two alerts and none of them are those two. </s>
<s> So problem solved. </s>
<s> I am a little mad because HP has this real intrusive program that automatically installs in your computer that suppose to tell you when the products you are using has a update but all it seems to do is pop up to tell me I need to buy HP Products and that the printer was offline. </s>
<s> I have the same problem. </s>
<s> It is not solved yet but this is a great help. </s>
<s> YW. </s>
<s> Definitely use the HP Chat. </s>
<s> The tech knew what is was right away and directed me to the links and walked me through the process. </s>
<s> It has been working fine since. </s>
<s> One thing they wanted me to connect my computer to the network printer using the usb cable before I did it. </s>
<s> I told them I could not do that because I was in a wheelchair (I just had a car accident)and I could not get upstairs where the printer was so they did it wireless and it worked fine. </s>
<s> So if you do not want to use the usb cable make up a excuse why you do not have a access to the printer </s>
