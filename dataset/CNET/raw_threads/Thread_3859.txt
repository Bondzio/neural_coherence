I have recently downloaded a file from a torrent site that includes map files for the whole of Europe which I would like to burn onto disc for my car. I have also d/loaded WinZip and IMG Burn to try to achieve this. In the past I have succeeded in doing this with other torrent maps but I can never remember how I did it!! Just sheer luck I think. A nyway, I've tried a few times and thrown a few discs away....soon it might be my pc!! I do remember in the past that I could open up the main file and see many smaller files within it, on my pc, but in this case I know the files are within, cos it says 2.7 gb , but I can't open it to view. Pretty please. lend me a brain guys!!

For all naviagation DVDs to date and all that I see today, these are copyrighted works and not one would be from a torrent. Alert your post if your make/model supplies such but as it stands it looks like the usual bad thing.
