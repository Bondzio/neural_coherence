&quot;FAT32 can't read...&quot; I'd rewrite that to be ... &quot;The OS Windows 98 can't...&quot; It's a minor point and why the office only has a few Windows 98 machines left.
It's decade old technology that is what it is.
Also, MS provided 8.3 name mangling so even with your noted issue, it still works.
