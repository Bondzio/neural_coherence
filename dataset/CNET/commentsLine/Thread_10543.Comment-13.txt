i installed, hd and os in less than 3 hours.
all was painless and automatic!
it also helps; to have security updates from microsoft, on a cd via snail mail.
you can get sp2 this way, for free, no postage.
i also took the opportunity to; dust out the works and removed the cooling fan, cleaned it and re-installed.
only a slight increase in performance.
i expected this however, since my files were well managed on the old hd and i already had near peak performance with it.-----my thanks, go out to the above folks, for all the help and suggestions.
cnet rules!!
