The system BIOS is set to AGP, I have the 9800 set as default, but I have also turned on and off in testing the bios vga.
Nothing has changed in this computer except I went from a 9700 to a 9800PRO.
Is there a way to reinstall the 9800 BIOS?
IT seems like it's not seeing it - only the operating system is finding it after it boots up.
I also reinstalled the software twice.
