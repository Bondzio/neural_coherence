<s> I just bought this great tablet a couple weeks ago. </s>
<s> I was just getting everything set up, apps, games, news, shopping, etc... and while I was playing solitare I picked up the nook in my hand and it was real hot on the back panel,,, seconds later it shut itself off and it aint starting anymore, is it toast ? </s>
<s> I hope this is covered by warranty,,,,, any opinions ? </s>
<s> I would go for a full refund and try some other system. </s>
<s> Barnes and Noble tried but it's hard to get traction in the market. </s>
<s> I think there are many other fine choices. </s>

<s> 24 hours later I had tried charging it and the whole time the nook charge light just glowed green, even thou it should have been orange first, so I tried one last time to restart it,,, pressed the on tab for about 15 seconds instead of usual 4 or 5. it came on,, best I can figure,, I had been activating apps from Nook , and I get the feeling they want you to do them one at a time,, they say the tablet will pick up the app in about a half hour,,, I had tried to get about 3 in that time, so Im thinking that might have been too much info coming to the tablet , so for now its been working great all day, and I dont have to toss $120, in the trash. </s>
<s> That's not that bad a deal. </s>
<s> But if it fails for you and is defective I didn't write to toss it but to go for a refund. </s>

<s> If Id have bought it at Walmart, I would have returned it, exchange for another,,, but returning something thru an internet purchase is not my idea of fun, LOL so I got lucky, &quot;This Time&quot; and theres 1 less &quot;refurb&quot; out there. </s>
