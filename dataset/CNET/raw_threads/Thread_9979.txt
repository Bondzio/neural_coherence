I bought an APC UPS for my desktop,but don't have a grounded outlet to plug it into.Does not having a grounded outlet affect the UPS as far as protection to my equipment goes? I can put up with the little red light that indicates &quot;building wiring fault&quot;. For some reason,APC says it's warranty is void if I don't use a grounded outlet.

I only run into no-ground outlets when the owner has fried a few thousand bucks of gear. One of them thought an UPS could save their hardware. Get that fixed! Bob
