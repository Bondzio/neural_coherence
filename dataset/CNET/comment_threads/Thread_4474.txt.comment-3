Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 - we've had the machine for a couple years.
Is this new enough?
And (here I'm revealing my ignorance) just to be sure: to say that newer Mac operating systems can deal with NTFS &quot;natively&quot; is to say that such a machine wouldn't have a problem syncing with an NTFS formatted external drive, yes?
