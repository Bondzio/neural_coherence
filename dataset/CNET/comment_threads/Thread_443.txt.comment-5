Too bad I don't live/work in the UK.
Plextor has a write protect hdd available to Europeans.
http://www.plextor.be/products/px-ph08u.asp?choice=PX-PH08U It is NOT available in the USA.
I've already looked.
I wish it was.
I even contacted Plextor to try and find out what it would take to get some here.
The guy on the phone was a real smartass about it and wouldn't lookup any contact info for anyone in the company that would actually know something.
