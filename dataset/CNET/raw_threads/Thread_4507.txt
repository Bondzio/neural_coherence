I have a ruko for streaming Netflix etc, but I am wanting to be able to watch free videos such as on the network website or from the free tv websites. I would appreciate any help with this. Thanks

I cannot determine if it will play other video like networks (abc, nbc etc) and free tv. It sounds to me like it will but do not want to purchase something that will not do what I want. I looked at your suggestions but doesn't sound like they will let me watch free tv from the web. I appreciate your response. Thanks

Unless you get one like the Sony and it plays in the Chrome browser. Worth a try. I know I may get it.
