<s> i have a Compaq (yr 2004) Desktop and want to add and LCD Monitor to it. </s>
<s> Should I upgrade the graphics card? </s>
<s> One step at a time upgrade? </s>
<s> I guess I do not have to upgrade my graphics card? </s>
<s> I think I am going to buy the monitor and if it does not work I can return it but I was hoping someone could tell me. </s>
<s> PC Displays are pretty much plug and use type things. </s>
<s> I very much doubt you'd need to do anything with the video *except* make sure to go to the compaq (or nvidia or whomever) site and make sure you have the latest driver for your graphics processor. </s>
<s> Fwiw. </s>
<s> I'm using a rather old video card and I suspect the OP is using something older. </s>
<s> When I went to the maker's site for my video card I found quite a list of newer drivers. </s>
<s> As I walked my way up this list and tested I found there was a peak....perf wise. </s>
<s> Since I was not trying to fix anything......I stopped at the peak. </s>
<s> Newest drivers and old hardware might not be the best match. </s>
<s> I agree the monitor should be PNP. </s>
<s> Hey, If you have a Desktop Want to Upgrade Monitor for your pc then once you have to conform with the technical person Who has good knowledge of computer hardware. </s>
<s> Then after your have to modify you monitor.Also search in Google ,it's also help you. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
