that makes perfect sense.
while i did make multiple adjustments to the router (so i'm not 100% what fixed it)... we do have all the portables and since they are not n compatible, the weaker of the link is probably tuggin' on the chain.
setting that to b and g only probably did make the difference.
well, if i can transfer the big things fast over the lan then i'll be happy and get at least 8mpbs or much more than the sad 1.2mpbs for net.
thanks for the org post and hope all this helps out any newcomers.
