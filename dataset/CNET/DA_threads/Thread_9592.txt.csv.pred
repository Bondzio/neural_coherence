1.1.1	Hello , I have seen previous posting on this problem but no answers , so I 'm wondering if anyone has some new advice .	St
1.1.2	I have installed a Pentium III 667 MHz processor ( from an IBM 300PL-6584 ) into an IBM Aptiva 545 ( 2171-545 ) and get the error message & quot ; CPU BIOS Update Code Mismatch ) after booting .	St
1.1.3	I tried getting a BIOS update floppy , but the computer will not even access the floppy before it gives this message nor will it allow me to enter the BIOS menu .	St
1.1.4	The IBM 300PL accepted the Pentium III 450MHz processor ( from the Aptiva 545 ) once the BIOS update had been completed .	St
1.1.5	I contacted IBM and they told me that there should n't be any compatibility issues , so I am stuck as what to do .	St
1.1.6	I 've found forums on the net about that message , but only dealing with Acer PCs .	St
1.1.7	I 've gotten the newest BIOS update ( 6/30/2000 ) for the Aptiva and still no results .	St
1.1.8	I also have put the old processor back and re-updated the BIOS , which has not helped yet .	St
1.1.9	If anyone has any ideas as how to fix this issue , PLEASE let me know .	Ques
