type the dead pc and you find the usual dead pc troubleshooting.
i can't tell you exactly what and which part to change to suspect here.
hut with xp and vista we do have system restore to fall back on if you want to install that driver.
-&gt; but first, norton and some other antivirus programs or suites can have you do one more thing to get system restore (sr) to work.
here's a search about that issue -&gt;  hope that helps, bob
