i am also in the invitation printing business.
i have bought several different hp printers.
i bought the hp3600 laser jet and it curled the card stock.
it also made black streak marks on the card stock.
it handled regular paper well.
i ended up sending it back to hp.
the toner was $80 each.
i currently have an hp officejet pro k550 (inkjet).
it handles the heavy card stock well, graphics print beautifully, but the ink smears.
i am still looking for the perfect printer.
good luck!
