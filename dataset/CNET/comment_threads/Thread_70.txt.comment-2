Try opening the system case and place a household fan to blow-in and see if that helps.
Understand, if the room temp is outrageously hot or humid, that it maybe too much and far more attention to cooling is required.
If you continue to operate the system is such conditions w/o proper cooling it can only lead to a failure of some sort.
