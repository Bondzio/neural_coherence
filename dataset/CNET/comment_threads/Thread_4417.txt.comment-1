I'm having the darndest time cooling my CPU.
It seems to idle at abot 55 C. I had the stock fan in there, but replaced it with a copper hsf with silver 5.
It started off cooler when I started it up again, but then went back up to 55.
It's a AMD Athlon 3000+ on an Epox 8KDA series MoBo, 1GB RAM.
Any ideas on what's wrong?
