<s> I have WinXP Pro with a 2.4G P4, 512 RAM, and trying the following on the NEC DVD-RW 1100. </s>
<s> I'm trying to get the drive to play a music CD so I can plug my headphones into the jack on the front panel of the drive. </s>
<s> Is there a utility that will cause this to work? </s>
<s> I've tried letting Windows Media Player run the CD and can hear through speakers, etc. </s>
<s> but if I plug headphones into the front jack I hear nothing through the headphones. </s>
<s> I can unplug the speakers and plug the headphones into the sound card and hear fine. </s>
<s> I'm trying to troubleshoot a &quot;static-like&quot; pop or click that occurs only when a wav sound file, streaming media, mp3 or a CD is played through the system sound card. </s>
<s> There is only the Insert/Eject button, the volume control and the headphone jack on the drive itself. </s>
<s> Perhaps I should be using a particular type of headphones? </s>
<s> I'm using my Koss Pro/4X stereo headphones. </s>
<s> Thanks, Ron </s>
<s> Read http://www.nwlink.com/~zachd/pss/pss.html and set WMP to play back in ANALOG MODE. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi Robert and Happy New Year! </s>
<s> That's quite a site. </s>
<s> Fortunately I can't find anything that applies - this is a good thing, (my interpretation). </s>
<s> WMP is up to 9.00.00.2980. </s>
<s> DirectX was updated in the past two weeks. </s>
<s> I only have one mp3, it was from Clint Black's site and offered free. </s>
<s> Other than that I don't download music files. </s>
<s> No worries about pirated software, just not worth it. </s>
<s> XP Pro is patched and drivers are updated as far as I'm aware of. </s>
<s> Virus, mal & spyware regularly scanned for. </s>
<s> I switched from Digital to Analog but still no joy on the headphones playback from the front jack. </s>
<s> This audio anomaly is mostly heard during system wav files (Windows Start, etc.) </s>
<s> or feed from Internet stream or Web sites playing midi or wav files. </s>
<s> I very seldom play audio CD's or Video DVD's so I'm only trying to use the drive to exclude the sound card source. </s>
<s> I started with Dell a couple days ago and they've had me disconnecting this and that and everything in between. </s>
<s> They seem to be looking for some sound issuing from a device but I can't seem to get them to understand that it is only heard through the speakers when played through the sound card. </s>
<s> I've moved the system, isolated the sub-woofer on a separate electric outlet, tested with two other speaker systems and as I mentioned plugged my headphones into the speaker output from the sound card and get the same results every time. </s>
<s> Not sure where to turn at this point. </s>
<s> It's not keeping me from using the computer and isn't causing any problems elsewhere. </s>
<s> Just something annoying. </s>
<s> I would like to simply un-install the sound card totally and replace it with a new one but right now I think this is Dell's call. </s>
<s> I'm patient. </s>
<s> Thanks Bob, Ron </s>
<s> If I re-read both your posts, then I realise that you may be expecting the CD-AUDIO OUTPUT JACK on a CDROM DRIVE to output sound from the computer's sound card. </s>
<s> &quot;Ain't gonna happen.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> you DO have the audio control turned up on the drive? </s>
<s> - fj </s>
<s> No, that's exactly what I want to bypass, Bob. </s>
<s> I'm trying to hear what's being played by using just the headphone jack on the drive - independent of the sound card. </s>
<s> I figured that was the only point of audio output I could use to isolate the play-back from the sound card. </s>
<s> Ron </s>
<s> Yup - I can rotate it back and forth but still no sound through the headphones. </s>
<s> Ron </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> What CD is this? </s>
<s> While I did write &quot;Audio-CD&quot; and to make sure the settings are all set to ANALOG PLAYBACK, another person had made a CD with MP3 files on it and was unaware it was not &quot;CD-Audio&quot; or &quot;Audio-CD.&quot; Just want to be crystal clear on this. </s>
<s> Use some store bought CD to clear up 1/2 of this question. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Is it in Analog playback? </s>
<s> To use analog playback instead of digital: 1. </s>
<s> In Windows Media Player on the Tools menu, click Options. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> On the Devices tab, click Properties for the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive that is being used for playback. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Under Playback, click Analog. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> but thought I would check. </s>
<s> I do not believe you can hear anything through the CD ROM headphone jack while an application has control of the drive. </s>
<s> You must turn off MP or other player and use the play button on the CD ROM. </s>
<s> You can go so far as disconnecting the IDE cable and trying the drive as a stand alone CD player. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Actually I am trying to use a commercial CD, Fleetwood Mac/Rumours to be exact. </s>
<s> I did go in and specifically set the drive to Analog. </s>
<s> It was in digital so I had to change it. </s>
<s> Is is possible there isn't sufficient output power or whatever from the CD-ROM itself to drive the Koss headphones? </s>
<s> It did work when I listened from the sound card output (but then, that wasn't what I wanted). </s>
<s> Ron </s>
<s> Interesting, however there isn't a Play button on the drive. </s>
<s> Only the Insert/Eject, volume and the jack. </s>
<s> I wondered about the program control and if it would have an effect, that's why I was wondering if there was a utility that would cause the player to be used on it's own specifically for using the output jack. </s>
<s> Thanks, Ron </s>
<s> It sure seems to me that it's still in digital mode or the front panel is just too weak. </s>
<s> Here's how I test such. </s>
<s> I unplug the small CD Analog Cable. </s>
<s> Here's a picture -&gt; http://www.spi-connects.com/images/catalog/r/r1.jpg Bob </s>
<s> when the jack is inserted into the &quot;socket&quot; on the front of the CD-ROM, possibly the jack on your headset is not the corect one?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> to feed the analog music signal to the output on the front of the drive. </s>
<s> They can fail. </s>
<s> I had a friend with a Dell that had that exact problem [while under warranty LOL]. </s>
<s> Bob, had to take an end run. </s>
<s> Wouldn't let me post further in that last one. </s>
<s> I'll give the cable disconnect a try and make a trip to Radio Shack tomorrow and see if I can find an inexpensive set of headphones suitable for the PC. </s>
<s> Maybe the Koss headphones need a little more output power. </s>
<s> I'll let you know. </s>
<s> Ron </s>
<s> Don't blame the earphone. </s>
<s> If the light on the drive is blinking then you have either a defective volume control or a defective output jack. </s>
<s> Hmmm, OK, then I'll pose that one with Dell also. </s>
<s> Thanks, Art. </s>
<s> Ron </s>
<s> Ray, I assume that you refer to the Digital to Analog? </s>
<s> If so, then I did try that. </s>
<s> It would then go along with what Art posted and I responded that I will now bring that up with Dell also - - in addition to the sound anomaly. </s>
<s> Thanks, Ron </s>
