Yes, my speakers are connected correctly through the line out or headphone jack.
My problem is with the line-in jack right next to it.
I've plugged my game system's audio OUT to the macbook's line IN, and I see signal in the system preferences sound window, but I don't hear any of the audio through the speakers I've plugged in.
Regular system sounds play just fine, and audio through programs play fine.
