I have a 2wire HomePortal 1000SW and would like to get an inexpensive wireless card or USB connector that will work with this system.
I have read elsewhere that you have to use a 2wire product, but I find it hard to believe that no one has developed a product to fill this demand (SBC/Yahoo DSL has many customers).
Can anyone help with this?
A 2wire adapter costs almost half as much as I spent to build my daughter's computer.
Thanks: Blackflame
