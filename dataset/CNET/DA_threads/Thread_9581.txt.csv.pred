1.1.1	I have decided I would like an external HD to back up mainly my music and digital pictures on my main drive .	St
1.1.2	I really do n't have anything else that important to back up or worry about .	St
1.1.3	If I buy a new external is it as simple as plugging in the USB and begin transferring files to that drive ?	Ques
1.1.4	I just want it for storage only .	St
1.1.5	Also , I have noted that it would be best to unplug this new drive when not in use so it does not get a bug or corrupted is that good advise ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks for the help .	St
1.2.1	No write protect switch .	St
1.2.2	Any virulent virus/pest/trojan can delete such without anything stopping it .	St
1.2.3	If a spare copy is all you want , then this is fine , but never call it a backup .	St
1.2.4	Your pictures are likely better off on CDR .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	When a USB storage device is present it is seen as yet another & quot ; storage & quot ; area or drive .	St
1.3.2	While you can unplug/plug on the fly its best to use the & quot ; unmounting & quot ; icon or feature of that product to handle that .	St
1.3.3	Yeah , the ext .	St
1.3.4	drive can be left unplugged before powering up system .	St
1.3.5	In effect it 's simple to use but do n't let that fool ya , treat it like any HD as if internal , handle with care .	St
1.3.6	Now buy whatever ext .	St
1.3.7	HD you like but please check whatever features seems to fit your likening .	St
1.3.8	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.4.1	I have 2 120Gb USB2 externals and a 120Gb internal which I connect when I want to transfer large batches of files , a few Gb .	St
1.4.2	The externals are normally disconnected .	St
1.4.3	I connect only with the internet off and after I 've run Trend Internet Security 2005 , Adaware , Spybot and Giant ( MS 's new acquisition ) , all updated daily .	St
1.4.4	I have 3 backups for all the personal stuff , just to make sure I do n't lose anything else ( big virus attack 2 years ago ) .	St
1.4.5	After I connect the externals , I do another set of scans and I have never had any pests resident in the externals , or the sometimes connected internal either .	St
1.4.6	Looks like they prefer the straight line approach , the C drive .	St
1.4.7	Normally , I delete\quarantine anywhere from 10 to 80 malwares per day , depending on where I surf .	St
1.4.8	I go where I damn well please but have to spend up to a couple of hours occasionally to clean the PC .	St
1.4.9	Either that or hide in the closet - not my style .	St
1.5.1	& quot ; I delete\quarantine anywhere from 10 to 80 malwares per day , & quot ; Is n't it time to find out how such get on your system before one wipes you out ?	Ques
1.5.2	Bob	St
1.6.1	But I looked at the possiblity of tracing the different ones and got nowhere .	St
1.6.2	I get cool web search constantly .	St
1.6.3	Search Assistant took over my home page 3 or 4 times .	St
1.6.4	Trend gave 30 notices of Dial Tibs a and instructions for downloading the fix , which was n't an .exe and was n't recognized by the Anti-Virus pattern file .	St
1.6.5	I got many other repeats characterized as critical , which were quarantined , apparently before corrupting much .	St
1.6.6	So far , the worst symptom is erratic browsing and IE6 freeze followed by shut-down and send error message , like MS is going to do something heroic and cut off the monster 's head .	St
1.6.7	I refuse to be paranoid about surfing ; I go where I please and when I get a trojan ( regularly ) , the last 3 URLs get put in AdAware ( I 've got a bunch in there ) .	St
1.6.8	Yeah , the overhead is excessive but since I 'm retired , I look at it as a game of sorts .	St
1.6.9	I figure if none of the major players in Anti-Virus can block this stuff but they seem to be able to contain the worst threats , I 'll see how it goes .	St
1.6.10	Since I do have several backups for everything I 'm concerned about , and have n't lost any files I care about for a couple of years , the worst-case scenario is putting in a formatted C drive , re-installing XP Pro , transferring my backed up Documents and Settings , Favorites and Desktop , and reinstalling some of the apps that like to clutter up the registry , but that I prefer not to do without .	St
1.6.11	At least I 'm learning about the guts .	St
1.7.1	If so , you are letting the pests in .	St
1.7.2	Try Firefox and see the pest count go down .	St
1.7.3	Bob	St
