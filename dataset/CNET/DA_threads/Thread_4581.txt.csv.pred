1.1.1	Hello , I have two computers , a host and a client .	St
1.1.2	Both are running Windows XP Pro .	St
1.1.3	The host is not connected to the Internet or a network , but simply has it 's NIC connected to a webcam via a crossover cable .	St
1.1.4	This is the first & quot ; network. & quot ; The host also has a modem which is setup to accept incoming calls ( PPP ) to allow access to the host .	St
1.1.5	This is the second network , when there is a connected incoming phone call .	St
1.1.6	The client ( the computer dialing into the host ) is not connected to the Internet .	St
1.1.7	The client connects to the host via its modem ( 28.8 ) .	St
1.1.8	Essentially , the host is in an isolated area where no Internet access is available .	St
1.1.9	I want to dial into this computer and access the webcam to & quot ; keep an eye on things. & quot ; I can dial into the host just fine , and access Remote Desktop .	St
1.1.10	I can view the webcam on the remote desktop , but its very slow as you can imagine .	St
1.1.11	I can not go to my command prompt on the client computer and ping the webcam , or access it with the viewer application .	St
1.1.12	It appears that the webcam and my dialup computer are on two different networks .	St
1.1.13	The host can see both networks , but the current configuration will not enable the dialup computer / client to access the webcam .	St
1.1.14	This is my problem .	St
1.1.15	If I can connect the client directly to the webcam via IP , the image downloads will be much more efficient because I wo n't have to use Remote Desktop .	St
1.1.16	I ran ipconfig on both the host and the client during the dialup session .	St
1.1.17	Here is the host : PPP adapter RAS Server ( Dial In ) Interface : Connection-specific DNS Suffix .	St

1.1.116	: 192.168.1.3 The IP address of the webcam is 192.168.1.115 and its subnet is 255.255.255.0 .	St
1.1.117	I can access this IP address only from the host , not the dialup client .	St
1.1.118	I am hoping there is a simple answer to this .	St
1.1.119	I 'm a certified Netware Administrator , which means I know a little bit about Netware file systems but thats about it .	St
1.1.120	The reason I 'm using a dial-in method is that the host computer is in a remote location in the mid-west U.S. where broadband is not available .	St
1.1.121	Also , the webcam does not have a usb interface , only ethernet .	St
1.1.122	Thanks for any insight you can provide .	St
1.1.123	Robert	St
1.2.1	the problem is not networking but dial-up speed .	St
1.2.2	The higher the resolution on the camera equates to larger files ( pictures and frame rate ) , which will be much slower uploading from the camera .	St
1.2.3	You might try lowering the camera resolution to bare minimum .	St
1.2.4	I 'm on 10 Meg cable and a friend is on the same .	St
1.2.5	When we use our cams the voice is perfect but the pictures are very slow .	St
1.2.6	I can just imagine what it would be like on dial-up speeds .	St
1.2.7	Just a thought .	St
1.3.1	You say the dial-up speed is 28.8 ?	Ques
1.3.2	That 's standard & quot ; download & quot ; speed .	St
1.3.3	Upload speed from the camera will be a fraction of that .	St
1.4.1	Guys , my plan is to set the camera to the absolute lowest setting .	St
1.4.2	In the range of 10,000 bytes per photo or less if possible .	St
1.4.3	Remote Desktop actually works reasonably well with the resolution and colors turned down .	St
1.4.4	I havent had a chance to try the camera , yet .	St
1.4.5	Once I get this networking problem solved .	St
1.4.6	Any ideas on that ?	Ques
1.4.7	Thanks	Polite
