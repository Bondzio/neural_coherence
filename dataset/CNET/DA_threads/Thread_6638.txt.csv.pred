1.1.1	Does anyone know of a plugable USB AM/FM/TV &quot;Stick&quot; tuner that is compatible with Windows 7 Media Center.	St
1.1.2	Where it can be purchased as well as general info/capabilities.	St
1.1.3	I have an USB TV tuner &quot;Stick&quot; that works fine so my second choice would be a standalone USB AM/FM tuner &quot;Stick&quot; Thanks, Altoid666	St
