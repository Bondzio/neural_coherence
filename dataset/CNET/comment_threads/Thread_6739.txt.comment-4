Get the Acer, the Asus has a high return rate on the 900A and complaints on the Asus eee forums which can really only be fixed by Linux geeks or someone willing to invest time to fix it.
I own the 900A myself but because I fit in the geek category and knew I was going to change the 4GB SSD hard drive (btw it's a POS, the first linux update will either crash the comp or get errors) to larger SSD drive (which is what I did, to 16GB for about $50).
Asus is great if you like to mod it but Acer is the better buy if you don't and they cost the same.
