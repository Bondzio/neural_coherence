After 5 versions (2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and now 2004), the only reason I see for it is a cheap way to get NAV (which looks like a misfire in 2004) and Disk Doctor.
The rest can be done without.
Reference http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/nunt.nsf/docid/2000120915010309&src=n The same bug continues on in most if not all versions.
