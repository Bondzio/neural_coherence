ok yea i get you i was wokring undet the impression router was same as hub/switch (not too hot on networks).
got a cable modem from ntl.
we have a set top tv cable box, which also contains a cable modem.
the ethernet cable goes from that box to the gateway pc, the gateway pc goes to the switch which the client pc also plugs in to.
