Maybe 200 or 300 mhz. I'm going to get an AMD 3500+ on Socket AM2. My question is will any after market fan/heatsink work with any processor? In particular, will http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16835128007 this cooler work on http://www.newegg.com/product/Product.asp?item=N82E16813138026 this motherboard with an AM2 3500+?

I dont think gigabyte make that heatsink any more. Goto this link http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Products/Cooler/Default.aspx . If you want something to cool your CPU down. Try asaka aswell. But goto the Manufacturers site first! and also do some more research on AM2!

So, if you get a fan for XYZ-1000cpu and it becomes overclocked to XYZ-1300cpu then you're really going beyond the rating of the fan. Though a fan can take excessive heat, don't expect all fans to do so and whatever &quot;quality&quot; means alot. Thus, some namebrnads fans are capable of handling OC'ing but look for any rating label to match what you plan to OC to as a safe bet of sustained usage. Remember you still have to &quot;exhaust&quot; the immediate heat build-up as well to best serve any HSF to maintain its sustained rating or over time will fail. tada -----Willy
