<s> I was currently in the market for 5.1 or higher system with the works, but now considering the space I have to work with and knowing that installing all those speakers is just goiing to cost much time, labor and $$$... </s>
<s> I really don't want to but I just have to and, I have a few obstacles to deal with since the shelfs on my entertainment system are only 12&quot; in height. </s>
<s> Now I really like the Denon S301 mainly due to it's ease of use and having pretty much the works, HDMI, IPOD hook-up, good dvd player, etc. </s>
<s> My only problem is that the speakers are 1&quot; to big. </s>
<s> Bose 3.2.1 ? </s>
<s> ...Well from what i've researched and read on, they don't clearly have such a good rep. </s>
<s> The speakers would fit great on the shelfs, but I jst can't get over that boxy dvd receiver. </s>
<s> All I really want is to keep it simple with really good sound and manageability. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Receiver / Dvd / Ipod connection / Tuner 2. </s>
<s> Subwoofer 3. </s>
<s> Front surround speakers Any suggestions... </s>
<s> Are you talking about adding this to your PC, or is this completely separate? </s>
<s> This is the PC hardware forum... That being said, what's your budget? </s>
<s> How big of a room do you need to fill with sound? </s>
<s> sorry but I did not realize in what forum I was in before i just started asking questions... Well if you can help, that'll be awesome.. 15L x 13W x 9H room. </s>
<s> Tv viewing distance about 10'. </s>
<s> If I'm watching tv; wall to the left, sliding glass door/wall on the rear, kitchen to the right(8' of open space), 2'Wide wall next to kitchen leading to dining room(5' of open space). </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated.. </s>
<s> If I work off of the price of the S-301 as a budget, you can do pretty well... if... Speakers- The 12'' opening is pretty restrictive, but most 2-way bookshelf speakers are just fine laying on their side. </s>
<s> It's with the 3-way configurations (tweeter flanked by two mids, known as a D'appolito configuration) where laying them on their sides makes a big difference- don't do it unless they're made to sit that way. </s>
<s> In this total price range, I would look at a pair of B&W DM303s . </s>
<s> They should be in the $250-300 range, and not much touches 'em in that category. </s>
<s> Sub- get something decent. </s>
<s> I would look at the Velodyne line, they're a great value at their lower price-points. </s>
<s> You shouldn't need much with the small-ish room, but placement is VERY important, and every room is different. </s>
<s> My favorite method- put the sub where you would normally listen to the system. </s>
<s> Play some music. </s>
<s> Slowly walk around the room listening. </s>
<s> You'll notice that some spots the bass will be louder than others, some spots it'll be horribly boomy, and a couple of spots will sound just right. </s>
<s> Put the sub in one of those spots (you'll probably end up towards the front of the room and near, but not in, a corner. </s>
<s> Continue tweaking volume and crossover frequency to blend in with the mains. </s>
<s> Receiver- Denon is a solid brand that's readily available, stay with 'em. </s>
<s> They have good-sounding, no frills stereo receivers in the $200-300 range. </s>
<s> You can also look at their entry level surround receivers if you want to add speakers in the near future, but they don't typically sound as good (musically) as their 2-channel counterparts - there's more circuitry in the way, lower-quality amp sections, etc. </s>
<s> DVD player- whatever floats your boat. </s>
<s> Good luck and have fun! </s>
