1.2.1	Do n't assume anything , know what you have with 100 % certainly .	St
1.2.2	Then visit the Acer support website and see if anything is offered as an & quot ; upgrade & quot ; option .	St
1.2.3	Two areas that can benefit immediately are ram and video .	St
1.2.4	Understand how your ram is set-up and add more .	St
1.2.5	Then proceed to better video and here for gaming that 's where alot falls on a good video card .	St
1.2.6	However , once a power hungry card is installed you need the PSU that 's & quot ; very capable & quot ; to support it and whatever else gets added .	St
1.2.7	Also , cooling is very important so add more cooling if possible and/or upgrade to more fans or liquid cooling .	St
1.2.8	Since , is to be a gaming rig , cooling will play an important part , so do n't dismiss this until later .	St
1.2.9	Heat and wattage use will increase temps and start to degrade the overall components over time , do this ASAP .	St
1.2.10	Last , quality does matter , buy the good stuff .	St
1.2.11	tada -- -- -- Willy	St
1.3.1	The 3200 video is the bottleneck .	St
1.3.2	What you the about 100 buck GPU from this list to spice it up ?	Ques
