So my Gateway desktop (as well as my notebook) have both recently died about the same time after 5 years... strange, but anyway, I'm looking at Dell desktop to replace the home system. I don't want to spend more than 500-600. There are many options, but some general questions: Can I use my Gateway monitor with a Dell? (I suppose not, but why not?) Can I use the Office and/or Works installation CDs to install those programs on the new Dell? These came with the Gateway systems. I have heard that I can't use the XP installation CD either, but has Vista worked out all the bugs for a home user who is not using his system for gaming? Is it worth buying the option to keep XP OS on the new Dell? What will I need to ensure I can enable wireless networking at home? Lastly, I am interested in the Optiplex because I have read (don't recall where) that the tech support for business machines is US based and not via India and an overall quicker and better experience. Is this true? I am considering the Optiplex and if the tech support is not as described above, I may go with the Inspiron. Thoughts? Thanks! Frank

You will need to tune it in if outside of its &quot;native resolution&quot;. Any s/w that came with the Gateway in all likelihood may not work in a Dell as it verifies if the OEM EULA applies. However, excluding the OS it may work, but it varies. The OS itself definitely needs to be run under a Gateway system as the EULA rules applies here too. Your new system will have an OS if Dell to be Vista. Vista, has worked out some kinks but fixes come out regularly, it teething pain is behind it. If you can hold out Win7 is supposed to be better. Dell support if you need is there but as you stated, you really don't have a choice, you go with the plan. If you want so-called US support, then get a business system or from the business website, but read the &quot;fine print&quot;. You may to query in the Dell forum for a better answer as Dell people are there. tada -----Willy
