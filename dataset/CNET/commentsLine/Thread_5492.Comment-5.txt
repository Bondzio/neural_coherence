well, my stinky little hard drive must've &quot;understood&quot; how angry i was - just after i posted, i managed to get one solid hour of the hd staying mounted!
have managed to recover most of the data, so i got that goin' for me.
which is nice.
thanks a million (or maybe even 160gb?!)
for your assistance, bob.
since i don't think i'll be able to get my money back, guess i am stuck with getting a new wd hd.
will reformat to ntfs the second i get it home!
tangentially, do you have any opinions about one mfg or another?
who makes the best ext hd?
jenni, the soon-to-be ntfs magician
