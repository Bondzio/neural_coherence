xp is so much more stable than w95/98.
that's why the reset button is gone.
xp can recover from frozen screens, if and when they ever happen.
i have four pcs running xp home and pro and it never happens to me.
then, again, pressing the power button for &gt;5 seconds powers off and you can power back up.
