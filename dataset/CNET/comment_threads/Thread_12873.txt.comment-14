That switch on the back of your power supply does not change your power supply too 212 watts it changes the current that the power supply uses from 115 to 230 It has absolutely nothing to do with the actual wattage that the power supply pushes to your components and the reason that it doesnt work when you change it is because american homes use 115 volts mainly so when you flick the little switch it will not work
