we rarely find it to save anyone.
plus the more common failures are not something raid helps on.
we've seen more luck with automatic backups to other machines on the network as well as real backup systems than raid.
just sharing what i've seen over the years.
if you were looking for some speed tests or such may i suggest tomshardware.com since they recently did some comparisons of raid chipsets.
