As most of us know, Dell cannot recommend third-party options for upgrading any hardware - thus the hardware that comes with it remains...
However, I have heard that you can replace the existing PSU (Power Supply Unit) with a third-party one (such as a Thermaltake, Antec, etc).
However, I have also heard that such PSU's are not compatible with the Dell motherboard.
Which of these are true?
I don't want to ruin my system - thanks.
btw, I have a Dell XPS 410
