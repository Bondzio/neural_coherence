I thought it read 112 or 212, probably 115 and 230 and that's VOLTS, not watts.
That is the switch to select voltage level when outside the USA power grid.
Don't DO THAT if you're part of the USA electrical grid, Canada, OK too, keep at 115V.
If you remove the computer side cover and look at your psu, some decal or sticker will explain what your psu is capable of in wattage.
