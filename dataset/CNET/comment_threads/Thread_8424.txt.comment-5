Thanks again for the reply.
That's interesting.
I think DVD-RAM is a big selling point over here.
TV cards are also a big selling point as well.
The sales rep at the store I went to said that it would be better to get a computer that came with a TV card preinstalled since the good ones cost about $300 (my guess) on their own.
Your replies have made me start to seriously consider ordering a computer from a U.S. company over the net.
Can you or anybody else recommend any going places that ship internationally and offer good support?
Also, I would need to get really good Japanese language capability so do you think I'll need a Japanese OS for that?
Thanks again.
