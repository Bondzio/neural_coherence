<s> Been looking at HP's MV2020, Netgear ReadyNAS, and Iomega StorCenter. </s>
<s> I would entertain other options as well. </s>
<s> Things that are important to me are: data security (redundancy, we had a HDD fail and lost lots of pictures of first baby), speed, and media streaming. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> No matter which system you choose if you don't follow the old rules about backup you get to (re) learn why they came up with that. </s>
<s> Too many people today use such systems as STORAGE and forget about the all important second copy and backups. </s>
<s> I like that HP but for me a simple low wattage LINUX BOX is doing my NAS. </s>

<s> I see on friday's paper that Fry's has a sale on a Maxtor 500GB shared storage II NAS for $200 (normally $300). </s>
<s> The # is 5306728. </s>
<s> Maybe I am putting too much faith into the RAID system. </s>
<s> I was hoping that I could avoid or at least minimize the amount of backing up I needed to do with the redundant drives. </s>
<s> The HP seemed to be fine but with only RAID 1 capability data corruption seemed to be a potential problem. </s>
<s> I had thought that the RAID 5 of the netgear might help in that aspect. </s>
<s> I admit that am not that familiar with the pro's and con's of the different RAID systems as a backup system to a HDD failure. </s>
<s> when the nvidia Ion comes out ,that will be the best one easily, running Ubuntu of course. </s>
