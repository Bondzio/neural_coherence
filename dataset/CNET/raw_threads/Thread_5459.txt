Do you know if there any official specifications for wireless positioning (localization) for such standards as: 802.15.1 802.15.4 802.15.3 802.11 802.15.4a 802.16 LTE? If you got some information i'll be very thankful for it.

Not all specifications are freely available. This can upset some when they ask and find out the paper is not free. Also it is apparent you didn't do your research before asking. Please do your research. Bob

If you need this content then back to your boss or company to get them to pony up the bucks to pay for the papers. -&gt; I read you are researching this and found out that there isn't much free content. That's true. And there's a reason why that is. Be sure you didn't tell anyone else you would get this report done for free. Bob
