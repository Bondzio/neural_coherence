1.1.1	[URL=http://img689.imageshack.us/i/smartlog.png/][IMG] http://img689.imageshack.us/img689/3498/smartlog.png [/IMG][/URL] Actually I have another question this HARD Disk has been on problem with UDMA as shown here [img] http://img821.imageshack.us/img821/7185/sata.png [/img] when I emailed WD &quot; the company of the HDD &quot; their techiqual support say it may be from the firmware of the HDD because it was not intended to be in a desktop computer it was intended to be for PVR/DVR and DVD recorders So Please Help Me	St
1.2.1	Now that you know, did you try a new hard drive intended for us in a PC?	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	If this is a cable problem then try another one.	St
1.3.2	As for the dual reference, the HD if not originally for PC use, tends to be optimized for DVR, etc., is more smart and/or receptacle for that intended purpose.	St
1.3.3	They do that for this very reason, NOT to be used in PCs to gain access to whatever data those vendors use to optimize usage.	St
1.3.4	You can't just wipe it clean as the maker tech's offered its a i/c chip(firmware) setup.	St
1.3.5	Also, in my experience, the access to the HD is done via the DVR box once connected to whatever setup and it d/l's the required s/w for its use.	St
1.3.6	Which in effect optimizes for non-PC use.	St
1.3.7	tada -----Willy	St
