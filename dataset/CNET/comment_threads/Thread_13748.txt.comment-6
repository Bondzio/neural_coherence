You can set the resolution to what you like.
But native is usually the best.
What I did.
I have a 19&quot; wide screen.
I found a 22&quot; wide screen.
When I got it home I found out that my Intel graphics card supported about a gazillion resolutions.
But not the one specific to the new 22&quot;.
Specifically, it supported resolutions above and below the new LCD, but not the exact one.
Bummer.
I took it back.
