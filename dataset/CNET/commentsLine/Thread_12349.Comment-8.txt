if there's an electricity interruption or the infamous comcast cable &quot;blinks,...&quot; i just purchased the wrk54g linksys wireless - i have 4 wireless comps and one wired running thru it, crossing two floors, some concrete, drywall and bookshelves, etc - and the connection is very good.
however, we suffer the same comcast cable &quot;blink&quot; and i have to reset the modem and router every time.
pain in the butt, but ultimately, it is a comcast issue.
i did have good help from linksys phone support the one time i needed them.
their built-in help is way too geeky and non-informative - no true explanations of what options do and don't do.
almost a throw-back to the original computer manuals of 1980.
