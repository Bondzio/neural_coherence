buying a new pc, or motherboard, always raises many questions.
if the pc or motherboard you are wanting already has an integrated graphics feature, fear not.
for most applications other than gaming or high-end business graphics use, an integrated solution is usually perfectly adequate.
however, if you subsequently decide it's not quite up to the job, you can fit a separate graphics card and turn off the integrated graphics from within the bios.
read the mobo manual to see how to access that (it varies between makers and versions) and then how to turn off the integrated graphics feature.
even mobos with integrated graphics provide either an agp or pci-express slot for the new card.
then you're good to go with your new graphics card on a reboot.
hope that clears up some of the confusing posts.
