I would like to network it (as a file server) with my Windows XP MCE05 Sony. I have both connected to a Linksys hub, but I can't seem to get either to recognize the other. Any suggestions? Also, I have a 1.2Ghz P4 Dell PC running Windows XP Home. It too is connected to the hub. On this PC, it can 'see' the Sony, but the Sony does not show the Dell and I cannot access either from the other... I know I'm doing something tragically wrong here... Any help would be appreciated.

Basic requirement for sharing are: 1. File and printer sharing is turn on/enabled. 2. You must shared something (a folder/directory). 3. Sometimes you also need a same workgroup name (although it might see each other even with different workgroup name)
