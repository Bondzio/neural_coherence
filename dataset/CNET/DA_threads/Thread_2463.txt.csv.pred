1.1.1	I have both IR and RF devices that I want to control with my ipad using it as a remote control .	St
1.1.2	I have been able to replace my IR remotes but now want to be able to do away with my RF remotes as well .	St
1.1.3	Can someone tell me how to take the RF signals from my various remotes , and be able to channel through some device and then through my iPAD then to the appliance ?	Ques
1.1.4	Is it possible ?	Ques
1.2.1	But you may have to create and build the last interface with some boards and software .	St
1.2.2	Unlike the IR controls which is a pure bit on software kit , this requires much more work .	St
1.2.3	I find many are not ready for this work but as I have done this in the past I do have solid ideas on how to create it .	St
1.2.4	However there appears to be no off the shelf system to note yet .	St
1.2.5	If there is something made it would be specific to what you would control .	St

1.3.1	Thanks Bob .	St
1.3.2	That is a relief .	St
1.3.3	I have a home theatre where I want to operate the curtains , screen and blinds that have RF remotes .	St
1.3.4	Can you tell me how to do it or where I can go to have it done ?	Ques
1.4.1	I do n't know your electronics design background but if I was to build this I would CHEAT BIG TIME .	St
1.4.2	I 'd get something like a IP controlled relay box like http : //www.controlanything.com/ Now I can wire up those relays to that curtain or even the RF control device .	St
1.4.3	Like I said , this is not for a consumer to do but for those that create stuff .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	Bob That ius a big help .	St
1.5.2	Ill see if anyone here can take it further .	St
1.5.3	Cheers	Polite
1.6.1	There are more boards like this but the root of this system is to get from the ipad to ANYTHING that I can make to press those buttons or to power that curtain .	St
1.6.2	Bob	St
