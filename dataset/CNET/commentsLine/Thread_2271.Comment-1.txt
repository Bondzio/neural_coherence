i was in the process of changing my power supply when the bulb in the lamp i was using exploded in front of the open case.
after cleaning up the mess i continued with the installation.
i pushed the power button and the pc wouldn't come on.
so i took the new one out and put the old one back in same result no power.
the green led light comes on but when i push power it goes out then comes back on but nothing turns on.
could the bulb exploding have damaged my motherboard.
