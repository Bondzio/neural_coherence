i ended up ordering the xerox phaser 6180n.
i never considered metallic paper though...that would have been a thought!
this is all new to me.
i have not done any invitations yet...just holiday cards and i am very pleased with the results...although the printer did get finicky a few times but i think it was actually because i had to few sheets of the card stock in the feeder.
that's what i'm guessing.
it didn't seem to do that when i had a stack in there.
it has a feeder that opens in the front.
so far i'm pleased with the text and graphic quality but like i said i have not done that much with it yet.
i'm going to try vellum out next...we'll see how it goes.
