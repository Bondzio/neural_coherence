you said: &quot;the reason why is because the computer just shuts off.....the computer was working, it was just shuting off and i thought it was because of that being off the motherboard those 2 things....&quot; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ i suspect the heatsink clasps you mentioned broken can be replaced.
if you can try a plastic/nylon screws&nuts found in h/w stores that fit.
-or- try you're local computer shop to retrieve one from a broken system, etc.
laying about.
yeah, it shuts down if heat build-up is too great, do the fix, asap.
as for the mtrbd.
replacement is relative.
if you retain the emachine case, many atx type mtrbds.
will work, but necessarily all holding posts can be used, beware of that.
you need to verify once installed, the mounting posts wehere they are and if extra not shortening out the new mtrbd.
or if less that flexing isn't an issue.
hope this helps... tada -----willy
