WOW Roger, sounds like a lot of fun!
Intermitents in anything can be a nightmare.
Have you checked the inverter(most LCD'S use one) could be iffy connectivity there that is the first place I would look.If that isn't the problem, like Bob said, get out your jeweler's loop and check solder joints but I wouldn't put a lot of time into it.
It is just a fair monitor to begin with.
Good luck!
