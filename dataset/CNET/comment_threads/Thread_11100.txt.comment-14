As I wrote in my last message, I had changed the address of (wired) Router #2 to 192.168.2.100, and the access point to 192.168.2.99 - that is the strange thing.
I checked it - with a wired connection into router #2 - and those addresses are correct.
But turning them on somehow makes it impossible to log into router #1 at 192.168.2.1.
A minor matter, since things work, but a mystery nonetheless.
My main goal, accessing a (wired) network-addressable camera attached to (wired) router #2, works.
Thanks again for your time.
