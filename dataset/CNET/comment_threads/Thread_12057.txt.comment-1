Hi, I just bought a new computer here are the parts: MSI P965 NEO-F V2, P965, Socket-775, ATX, 1333FSB, GbLAN, DDR2, PCI-Ex16 4 x 1024 5300 667Hz DDR2 RAM Core 2 Quad processor HIS ATI Radeon HD 2400 PRO 256 MB GFX Card My problem starts when I'm finished with the GFX card driver installation and are asked to reboot.
When I rebook, my monitor wont work.
When I connect an ord (One of those big ones.. CRT I think it's called) it works.
I have tried to reduse all the resolution and Hz but it still does not work Note that the monitor that does not work is a LG Flatwide 19&quot; standard LCD screen and that it works untill I install the GFX driver anybody who can helt me with this issue?
