<s> Did you check to see if your DVD hardware is video or audio DVD?If you have an audio DVD player...then you wont be able to use video DVD disc. </s>
<s> Did it ever work. </s>
<s> What brand/model DVD drive is it? </s>
<s> Are the commercial DVD's you are trying to play or DVD's someone made? </s>
