just a thought.
if i r/c a blank area of the desktop and select properties it brings me to a screen that applies to my vid card.
if i go through the tabs on that screen i get to a screen that allows me to select refresh rate.
in my case it is set to default which gives me a rate slightly higher than yours.
i have tested higher rates and for my use i do not see a diff, perhaps gamers play with this stuff.
