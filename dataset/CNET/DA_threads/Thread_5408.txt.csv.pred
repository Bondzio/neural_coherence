1.1.1	Did a MOBO upgrade a while back .	St
1.1.2	With everything else , I got USB 2.0 ( also added Firewire A card ) .	St
1.1.3	When paying extra for USB 2.0 cables , I noticed they do n't appear to be any different than my USB 1.1 cables .	St
1.1.4	Asked a knowledgeable salesperson , he said USB 2.0 cables are marked .	St
1.1.5	I can find no difference !	St
1.1.6	Either this is just a marketing ploy or I have been using , then giving away USB 2.0 cables .	St
1.1.7	Does anyone have any info about this ?	Ques

1.2.1	The shielding and RF performance is different .	St
1.2.2	You do n't want to know the number of times I see some complaint about a USB 2.0 device not running at full speed and the line goes silent when you ask & quot ; Are you using 2.0 cables. & quot ; Given that such a cable is not a premium price ( note the price is $ 1.19 at http : //www.compgeeks.com/details.asp ? invtid=USB2-10-AB ) I 'm unsure what & quot ; extra & quot ; price people pay for this .	St
1.2.3	Seems not much could be saved .	St

1.3.1	At Microcenter where I got my hub , USB 2.0 cables were running $ 10-20 ( found $ 4.95 in town source ) .	St
1.3.2	I understood 2.0 cables and hubs were different ( throughput ) , but ca n't find VISUAL difference .	St
1.3.3	They wo n't let me take them somewhere to bench test them before I buy them .	Sug
1.3.4	chuck	St
1.4.1	You also need a piece of gear such as HP 's RF Network Analyzer http : //wwwasic.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/testlab/g_info/HP4396A.html to see what the signals do on the cable from your USB 1.x speeds of 11 Mbps to 480 Mbps .	St
1.4.2	Given that it 's a dollar for the cable , I do n't understand when people do n't use the right cable .	St
1.4.3	And since the cables are a dollar , why not slice a few open and see the difference ?	Ques
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	All I have left is USB 2.0 and firewire .	St
1.5.2	Do n't have a problem buying USB 2.0 , just want to be sure that is what I 'm getting .	St
1.5.3	Thanks again for the help , Bob .	St
