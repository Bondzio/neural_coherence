the operating system&quot; It would really help if we had which O/S you're using; because if I go to the ASUS support site, it automatically wants to know which O/S you're using.
I figure you're probably having issues with a missing (updated) video driver, so here is the link: http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx Just input click on 'motherboard', socket, model #, then click on what O/S you're using, this will take you to their 'download' page for everything (including BIOS, drivers, manuals, etc.)
