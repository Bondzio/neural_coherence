On my Zebra 2844-z I can't print.
I load the media; plug in the usb cable install the driver from the CD.
I print a confiuration page from the printer it's self, and it works.
I go to print a Windows test page and The printer gives me a flashing red light.
It seems to me to be a callibration issue or something wrong with the media or media settings but I'm out of ideas on how to figure out exactly the problem.
I run windows xp Pro SP3.
I've tested it on multiple computers and I always get the same thing.
Any advice is greatly appreciated.
Billy
