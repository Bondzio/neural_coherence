<s> I'm am fixing up an old computer to put in my barn to have access to my dairy goat herd records. </s>
<s> Currently I have to print out files and write everything down and transcribe in onto my main computer (when I remember). </s>
<s> I have the most detailed herd and milking records for my herd thanks to my computer geekyness and it would be great to access this in the barn. </s>
<s> Anyway.... </s>
<s> I currently have my two home office computers networked. </s>
<s> I want to add my new/old barn computer to the Network and actually use the barn computer as a &quot;terminal&quot; to access my main computer, using the wonderful RealVNC software ( http://www.realvnc.com/ ) that I use to access my main computer when I am out of town. </s>
<s> Here's my problem. </s>
<s> I know nothing about wireless technology. </s>
<s> I do have line of sight to the barn from my office window. </s>
<s> The barn is 450' from my office. </s>
<s> The &quot;office&quot; in the barn is on the other side of the barn, so we're talking about 490'. </s>
<s> The signal would need to go through my office window, the two wooden (oak) walls in the barn that are about an 1 1/4&quot; thick. </s>
<s> The barn computer will be running Windows 98 SE. </s>
<s> My main computer runs Windows XP. </s>
<s> I cuurently have my two office computers &quot;cable networked&quot; using a very old Linksys Router and a hub. </s>
<s> How can I set this up?? </s>
<s> Is it possible? </s>
<s> thanks! </s>
