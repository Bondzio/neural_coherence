i don't think that matters much, if at all, even with usb 3. may i give you a warning?
experience has proven that external hard disks are quite unreliable and error prone.
too many members here thought they could be used as storage, forgot about a backup (a copy on one or two other media) and lost everything.
so better buy 2 disks and copy to both.
three would be even better, especially if you keep the third one on a safe place outside of your home or office (or where-ever those 3 other disks are).
