<s> Rather recently I have discovered my hard drive &quot;buzzing&quot; rather loudly. </s>
<s> I have been using this computer that I built along with this hard drive for well over three months now (the hard drive is roughly a year or more old and the additional parts are over a year old but I put these pieces together about 5 months ago) and am just now starting to hear this noise. </s>
<s> It seems to happen when the hard drive is more active, though it's buzzing has increased. </s>
<s> I have my computer sitting open and can tell it is the hard drive due to the fact that when I move it, the noise changes slightly. </s>
<s> I have it currently sitting on one end (&quot;face&quot; down, perpendicular to the way it normally would sit) simply because for whatever reason, it quiets down that way. </s>
<s> I have noticed a definite decrease in functionality with my computer but I have also managed to get a small string of viruses (so I was planning on formatting it anyways - thank god I already have it backed up) so I'm not sure if it's really the hard drive going bad that is causing the slower system. </s>
<s> If anyone has any suggestions, I would love them. </s>
<s> I've attempted to look up this problem on Google but really didn't find much information. </s>
<s> Thankfully my hard drive was still under warranty and Maxtor is sending me a new one immediately. </s>
<s> When I told the Maxtor tech support my issues with the drive, he immediately suggested that there was in fact, a defect with the drive. </s>
<s> So if you have a hard drive that is sending out the same signals, pray that you're under warranty! </s>
<s> I build my own pc as well and i was hearing a buzzing noises a few weeks ago i formatted the drive using a bootable disk since it wouldn't let me format any other way. </s>
<s> The problem went away after the format and it is working well now if this fixes the problem do that instead of buying a new hard drive most likely you have bad clusters and the format will find and mark those clusters. </s>
<s> The defective hard drive in my case was my slave drive which was a 40 gig western digital drive my primary drive was a 40 gig sygate drive. </s>
<s> I recently build this sempron 3200 computer with 512 megabytes of RAM i was looking for a stable second computer for my sister and it works well. </s>
<s> My primary computer is my Emachines 6212 and from now on i'll just buy an emachine instead of building one its just too much time and effort and money and the E-Machines are making better computers ever since Gateway bought them out. </s>
<s> Well im not sure my drive is under warranty i bought it 4 years ago and it had problems then but I never reported it so I'm not sure my drive is under warranty. </s>
