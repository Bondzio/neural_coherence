i will willingly let a person have a copy of my xp cd because it's useless without a proper activation code.
i will not share my code and i registered mine to prevent theft of that code.
so your answer will be found when you activate your xp.
you won't have any choice in the matter as xp will cease to function in 28 days after the install.
given all this headache, i wonder if you will save any money when the dust settles and the aspirin bottle is empty.
you can report a pirate if you get ripped off to piracy@microsoft.com bob
