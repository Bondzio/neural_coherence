seems to me that 12 dvds is less than 60 gb; a lot of dvds but only equal to a small hard drive.
if it was me, i'd get a very small hard drive - a local electronics store recently had the western digital 200 gb hard drives on sale for $59.
then i'd spend another $45 for a kit to convert the hard drive into an external usb drive.
for about $100, you'd get much more storage and could have all your files appear in windows explorer in a single view (making files easier to see/find).
in addition, this would sooner or later be cheaper than buying all those dvds, which could only be used once.
some of the external hard drive kits even have fire wire connections in addition to usb.
