<s> Have ECS k7s5a board, DIMM, DVD, CD Burner. </s>
<s> First PC would start intermitently, then it stopped turning on. </s>
<s> I only have power to HD and floppy. </s>
<s> PC appeared to post,saw monitor scroll for a few seconds then go blank. </s>
<s> HD ran for a few minutes then system shutdown and will not start. </s>
<s> I have connected monitor to another pc and it is ok. </s>
<s> Using Antec power supply tester PS seems to be ok; PS is 250w which may be low but system has been running for a couple years without a problem. </s>
<s> What else should I check? </s>
<s> in the towel, OR your CPU is getting too hot very fast, like with a dead HSF fan. </s>
<s> The power supply may also be shutting down due to too much starting current. </s>
<s> Possibly disconnecting the power and signals from some devices may let the supply start. </s>
<s> Then put them back, one at a time, to see if it is the supply or a bad device. </s>
<s> Testing with new PS. </s>
<s> Win2k (not XP, sorry) keeps re-booting, did a boot normally and system is now hanging at logon. </s>
