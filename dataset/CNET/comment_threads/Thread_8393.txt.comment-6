I can't tell from your post if the IP is valid.
Seem close, but you didn't reveal the rest of the numbers.
Netmask, and more.
It's not a public IP so there are no jewels at risk.
Another nugget to get network sharing to work is that the firewalls of XP are &quot;off&quot; and that the WORKGROUP names are the same.
If you can't share, I have to leave you to read http://www.wown.com and http://www.practicallynetworked.com It's also very important that Zone Alarm be uninstalled or again, I can't help... Bob
