it has all the big ones & you can import the odd ones.
you do need itunes to register it, do updates & back it up.
i have had my ipad since the 2nd month it came out & have only hooked it up to my pc 6 times, the 1st to register it, onetime for an update, the rest to back it up & transfer stuff from my pc to my ipad.
what does your post have to do with itunes?
i have never bought a mp3, i buy the cd & then transfer them.
what does not liking &quot;popular music&quot; have to do with itunes, yes there's a lot of junk out there that is &quot;popular&quot; but at lease it is not as bad as the early/mid 90's with all those boy bands, that was a dark time in music history.
why so anti itunes?
no program is prefect, it is not that big of a file, it does bogs down my old 3ghz p4 2gig dimm xp pro laptop some but not to the point i can not use the internet, just i can not say use itunes & google earth with 2 or 3 windows open at the same time, it does not lockup but it is sloooow.
