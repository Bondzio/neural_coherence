One day out of the blue my HP computer decided to shut down on its own without warning. Then when it went to reboot, it keep going in circles. It would get to the windows welcoming screen and then suddenly restart. And it keep doing this. well I called the local repairman and he said my hard drive might be fried. Long story short it wasn't. Because we hooked it up to one of my older ACER computers and I was able to get all of my stuff off the hard drive. Now, the problem is i reformatted the hard drive, however, it is still doing the continuous cycle of restarting. shouldn't it stopped seeing how a reformatting is supposed to erase EVERYTHING. I guess my question is how do I get windows seven on this crazy hard drive? So I can put it back in my HP computer and get things working again.

If you had another HD, you could quickly see what the results are. i suggest you get your hands on a Ubuntu bootable disc, made from using the live version of Ubuntu. Get the .ISO file, burn it and make a disc. Once done, enter your bios to verify the 1st boot device is the CD/DVD drive, save it before exiting. Mount new Ubuntu disc and see how it reacts. If there is a PC problem, then the remaining PC w/o the HD attached, should start to boot. If not and it tries repeated boots, you know the PC is kaput in some way. If you have warranty, use it as that maybe a way out as they suggest this or that. Also, details do matter, telling you have a HP system provides few details. tada ----Willy

Same problem. I figured the MB on the HP computer was to blame and took everything out of it I could...ie dvd burners and some cables. Thanks a lot!! I will be calling HP explaining the problem. thanks again.
