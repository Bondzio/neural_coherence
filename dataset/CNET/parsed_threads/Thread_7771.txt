<s> Seems like D-Link has a problem with these modems, I have had 2 not work out of the box, took the first one back to the store, sent the second back to D-Link for replacement. </s>
<s> My cable provider (Cox) told me they have had many problems with this modem not working. </s>
<s> To make matters worse D-link has very poor customer service. </s>
<s> After shipping the modem back at my expense, they are taking over 2 weeks to ship out a replacement. </s>
<s> Would not recommend this product to anyone. </s>
<s> I don't have such, but I'm having to update firmware in all such devices before they work. </s>
<s> Dlink must mass produce the product, box it all up and expect to fix it later with firmware updates we get to install. </s>
<s> Some consumers will not or can not deal with this and the product must be returned. </s>
<s> You did the right thing. </s>
