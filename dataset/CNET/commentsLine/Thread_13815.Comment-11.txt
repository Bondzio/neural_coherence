you've boiled it down nicely what the distinction is.
the answer to it, however, is something each person needs to decide for themselves.
with a nas you can access from all computers at the same time, and from off-site, too.
but you could nearly get 2 regular units for the price of one networked... the answer to the question boils down to how much is it worth to you for the freedom of not having to move the hdd back-n-forth?
understand also that from a compliance point of view, ease of use means people will typically be better about following a regimen.
with networked you can set it up so that backups are gonna happen no matter what.
if you're using a &quot;sneaker network,&quot; there's more risk that someone will say &quot;oh, i&quot;ll do that backup tomorrow, i can't be aed to move the hdd.&quot; which will lead to data loss...
