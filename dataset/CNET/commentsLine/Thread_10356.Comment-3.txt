bill---thank you for your thoughts.
the router in question was obtained used from ebay--already flashed with dd-wrt.
perhaps its time i move on to something more reliable at higher transmission rates.
(could be reason ebay seller unloaded the router) external antenna ---- yep i agree--i was hoping to not have to add a repeater/extender/bridge.
the increase of complexity of the wifi network something i wish to avoid.
aggravation=blood pressure issues.
i've done to research on new routers looking for something with higher cpu speeds, strong radio, and more memory.
what it comes down to is they are out there but not without firmware issues out of the box.
i've also heard success stories and failure in flashing dd-wrt etc.
with my limited geekyness (a word?)
, i am a 59 year old farmer, i would like to keep it fairly simple.
pperhaps my expectations of simple are too elevated??
a gentle nudge toward a functional kiss router probably ?
