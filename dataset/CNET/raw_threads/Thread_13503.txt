SBC yahoo wants $80 for the 2wire, and $50 bucks for the regular modem. They refuse to give me a new one since my warranty was only for one year. Are there any cheap places to get a dsl modem?

I plug into my dsl through my phone jack, and the 2wire	I see on ebay says that it does not have a cable or phone port. just ethernet ports. ???? do i need to get a 2wire that has phone port or do i need to get an additional piece of equipment?
