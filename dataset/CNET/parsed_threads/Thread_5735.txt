<s> I have a MacBook Air. </s>
<s> I have it connected to a large external monitor and use it mostly like a desktop. </s>
<s> What makes most sense for battery life: a) Keep it plugged in at all times while using? </s>
<s> b) Use on battery all the time (up to 100%, run down to 0, back up to 100% ...)? </s>
<s> As a rule, I do not turn the computer off, put it to sleep at night, so if you recommend &quot;a&quot;, what about at night? </s>
<s> Keep it plugged in, or recharge in the morning? </s>
<s> And if recharge, run it to 0 first? </s>
<s> Or what? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> http://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html gives you all you need to know about your Macbook Air battery and how to take care of it. </s>
<s> I wonder why you did not just buy a desktop Mac instead of a MB Air. </s>
<s> You have not mentioned moving it around at all. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> I said mostly as a desktop; I do move it around. </s>
<s> But thanks for the site; it answered my question. </s>
