<s> My current desktop monitor just died, so I am faced with the decision of whether to get a regular LCD monitor (that could play TV with a tuner in my computer) or a HDTV. </s>
<s> They would both be the same size (19 inch), but I wanted to see what people think the pros/cons would be of getting one vs the other. </s>
<s> I assume they would be able to achieve roughly the same resolution and performance as a computer monitor, and if I got an HD tuner for my computer, they might be similar as TVs too. </s>
<s> Would there be any difference in expected life or other factors? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> your primary use is as a TV away from the desk, get a hi-def monitor. </s>
<s> TV/monitor combos usually lower res than monitor alone in your size. </s>
