1.1.1	Hey Friends, I have been having this problem since long from time to time.	St
1.1.2	When I am surfing my PC or net, suddenly in between I first hear a very faint tick-tick-tick sound from the CPU cabinet and then my PC hangs (freeze) and after a long time it restarts on it's own.	St
1.1.3	After restart, on the very first screen the hard drives are not detected and on the second screen after restart get this error..	St
1.1.4	Disk Boot Failure Insert system disk and press Enter From here on I can do absolutely nothing, either install Norton Ghost 03 &quot;C drive&quot; image or reinstall windows etc.	St
1.1.5	I have to switch off the PC through the main switch.	St
1.1.6	Earlier I used to get this problem mostly while running windows update, installing programs, browsing my picture folders in thumbnail view (have a lot of pictures more than a GB) etc.	St
1.1.7	But in the last couple of days this problem has been occuring even more times while doing the simplest activities on my PC and now after restart on the second screen, I get this error..	St
1.1.8	Boot from CD/DVD: Invalid system disk.	St
1.1.9	Replace the disk and press any key After which again, the only thing I can do is switch off main switch.	St
1.1.10	Anyone please have some ideas what could be the cause(s) of this problem of mine and how to deal with it.	Sug

1.3.1	No this is my old original hard disk which I had brought along with my assembelled PC parts some 4 years back.	St
1.3.2	If you are suggesting, I should buy a new hard disk and see if this problem is solved with it; then that is not an option for me right now (financially).	St
1.3.3	Unless I am really sure that my current hard disk is dying and there is no other option for me but to buy a new one and backup all the data on it while the going is good for my previous hard disk, I can't buy a new one.	St
1.3.4	Any more ideas mate..	St
1.4.1	Have a friend make one.	St
1.4.2	The reason is that running Linux from the CD does not require you to have a hard disk in the machine.	St
1.4.3	At 4 cents for a CDR this is the lowest price solution I know of to making the machine work again.	St
1.4.4	If you can't afford the 4 cents ask a friend to give you the CD.	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	No it's not that my machine is not completely working.	St
1.5.2	Like this problem struck me some 7-8 hours back and I had to switch off my machine from the main switch.	St
1.5.3	An hour later I switched on my PC again and I was able to enter into windows.	St
1.5.4	Something like this happens everytime so far and my machine is not completely blacked out yet.	St
1.5.5	I wanted to know what possible could be causing this problem.	St
1.5.6	Is it really a hard disk problem or can this be causing due to something else.	St
1.5.7	I hope I am not reading you wrongly..	St
1.6.1	That the hard disk is giving you fair warning.	St
1.6.2	I've heard the click click, death sound far too many times (we have hundreds of machines at the office) so I had hoped you could make plans so you don't lose it all.	St
1.7.1	So the Final word is that my current Samsung SP0802N 80 GB hard disk is dying and I should get a new one and transfer all my data on it before it's too late.	St
1.7.2	Which new hard disk should I buy now.	St
1.7.3	And is there a drastic price difference between 80 GB and slightly higher capacity hard disks nowadays.	St
1.8.1	I paid 89 dollars for a 750 GB hard disk so it's assured that anything larger will be very expensive.	St
1.8.2	Remember that hard disks have about a 5 year rated design.	St
1.8.3	How many years did yours last?	St
1.9.1	I brought my &quot;Samsung SP0802N 80GB&quot; hard disk in july 2004.	St
1.9.2	Thats about 4 years back.	St
1.9.3	What is the approx warranty of this hard disk, do you know?	Ques
1.9.4	I went to the samsung site but there they are asking for some PIN or Serial No.	St
1.9.5	along with the model name &quot;SP0802N 80GB&quot; which I don't know as I threw away the box a long time back.	St
1.10.1	To get an answer to that you ask samsung.	St
1.10.2	As to part numbers, serial numbers I find those on the drive.	St
