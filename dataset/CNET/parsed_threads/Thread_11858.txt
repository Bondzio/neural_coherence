<s> Can anybody offer me any advice regarding connecting my LCD TV as a monitor for my laptop? </s>
<s> I have a Sharpe Aquos LC26 GA5E LCD TV and an ACER Aspire 5510 Media centre laptop. </s>
<s> The TV has PC input and I have tried plugging it in to the laptop but cant seem to get it to work properly. </s>
<s> When I turn it on the Windows screen appears on the TV but the welcome screen doesnt, it appears on the laptop and then the desktop appears on the laptop. </s>
<s> Ive tried checking the Extend my windows desktop box in display properties but that doesnt help. </s>
<s> My desktop wallpaper appears on the TV but none of the icons on my desktop do. </s>
<s> If I drag a window to the right of my laptop monitor, it will disappear and then reappears on the TV. </s>
<s> There must be a way that I can either use it as a stand alone monitor or I should be able to have the same images on both screens. </s>
<s> I can do this if I connect my laptop to the monitor I have on my desktop PC. </s>
<s> Ive tried looking on Sharpes website to see if there are any drivers that I need, but they dont appear to have a support page. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. </s>

<s> ...your desktop is extended. </s>
<s> The LCD TV is now extended screen space to the right of your main display (the laptop screen). </s>
<s> Nothing will appear on it unless your drag it there. </s>
<s> You can 'swap' the displays if the &quot;use this device as my primary display&quot; checkbox is available in display properties when the TV is selected. </s>
<s> If you want to see the same thing on your laptop and TV, you'll need to clone the display. </s>
<s> Some laptops do this via the display properties and others do it via a hotkey. </s>
<s> Hi Ramarc, I understand about extending the desktop, but when i try cloning it doesn't work, &quot;use this device as my primary display&quot; is greyed out as my laptop has a Hotkey as you suggest, but when i use it with the TV is connected it doesn't work. </s>
<s> It does work if i connect to my desktop PC monitor though. </s>
<s> any further thoughts? </s>

<s> when connected to the laptop as an extended display? </s>
<s> Also, what model laptop and TV do you have? </s>
<s> I've found some laptops handle two monitors very well while others are finicky. </s>
<s> My Toshiba with a geforce go was simple as pie; my wife's compaq with intel gma was easy also. </s>
<s> My friends compaq with an ati 9000 was a nightmare to get working right with multiple displays. </s>
<s> You might also want to hit the forums for your laptop mfg and pose the question there. </s>
