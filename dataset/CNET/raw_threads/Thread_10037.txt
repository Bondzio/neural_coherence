I can't seem to get correct incremental or differential backups. I'll do a full backup of a drive or files, make a minor change, go back and back up the same files or drive. I have to choose the original full backup file first (or I get an error) and then choose incremental or differential. But all the files get backed up again, not just the ones that have changed. Anyone seen or heard of this? Pretty weird. Chris Dell 8400 Dimension XP PRo 1 gig RAM 3.2 GHz

I bought the product too but to date have only used it to create and restore full partition images. My prefernce for the moment is still Ghost 2003 because I have used it with great success for years. Very simple and fast. But again I only use it to create and restore full partitions (or full drives if the situation warrants). Must admit it would be nice to do (automatic) incrementals too which is what Acronis is supposed to do as well. The trick is to be able to use this and if the sh*t hits the fan....you can boot up of a floppy or CD and restore you latest image (and updates if any) back to the partitions simply and easily. The trick is to put thm on a second internal hard drive where it out of the way and backup-restores are fast and easy. Wouldn;t be without it nyself. VAPCMD
