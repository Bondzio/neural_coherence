be certain that you set the jumpers properly for the location that you are going to put it.
twill be either a slave on the primary controller, of either a master or slave on the secondary controller.
your new system is probably using the 80 conductor [still 40 pin] cable and using cs [cable select] jumpering.
you should then set the jumper on the old drive to cs.
then whether master or slave is determined by which connector on the ribbon cable it is attached to, the end connector will be a master, the middle connector will make it a slave.
your new computer's boot drive will be the primary master [unless its a sata drive], so to be the slave on the primary, it may be a little tricky to engage the middle connector of the ribbon cable to the old drive.
also anumber of new mobos, especially the bargin dell's, hp's, compaqs, have sata ports and thus only provide a single ide port [2 drives].
