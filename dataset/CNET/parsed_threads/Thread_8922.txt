<s> Here's my setup. </s>
<s> I have tried this with regular cable internet, business class and DSL, all with the same results. </s>
<s> I have internet into the house in the basement which goes into the modem. </s>
<s> Modem feeds to my N900 router, where addresses are handed out to the machines, phones, tvs, etc, everything on the network, which then plugs into a netgear 24 port switch. </s>
<s> From there, I have about 1600 feet of cable strewn to wire each room in the house. </s>
<s> From the start, I had intermittent packet loss. </s>
<s> Pinging my router has never been an issue, it's getting beyond that. </s>
<s> Sometimes I can go 12 hours and not lose a packet, sometimes I can go 12 hours and lose every other one. </s>
<s> The ISP (both of them) are stumped. </s>
<s> I've replaced the modem 6 times. </s>
<s> I think it's safe to rule out the modem. </s>
<s> The ISP can see drops on the outside of the house at times, but at other times, cannot. </s>
<s> I use VPN for work, which is very sensitive to packet loss, and I do quite a bit of online gaming when I'm not working, again it's noticed. </s>
<s> It seems to also be 'triggered' by activity on the network. </s>
<s> Meaning I click on a link or fire up pandora or download a file and bam...packet loss. </s>
<s> Otherwise idle pinging with ping plotter shows very little loss (&lt;1%) which I believe is normal. </s>
<s> Tonight, I had DSL hooked up, ran some errands, came home and found it erroring out every other packet. </s>
<s> I plugged the router into the cable modem which is still hooked up with the same results. </s>
<s> I rebooted the router and it went away...for about 10 minutes, then it's back again where I have intermittent packet loss. </s>
<s> I'm seeing this on all my pcs throughout the house. </s>
<s> These are wired PCs. </s>
<s> In every case, rebooting the router (which has already been replaced) fixes the issue, at least temporarily. </s>
<s> So it's a router or switch issue. </s>
<s> Are there settings that I'm missing? </s>
<s> I'd rather not (re)invest in a new switch and router if the one I have needs to just be tweaked. </s>
<s> The switch is a simple Netgear unmanaged 24 port switch. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be helpful. </s>
<s> Thanks, </s>
<s> My Netgear was updated to its latest and problems ensued. </s>
<s> A little research on the web found folk rolling back a version. </s>
<s> You should look into that. </s>
<s> About the switch. </s>
<s> Seems overkill. </s>
<s> For testing reduce complexity and no WiFi till it's working. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Didn't seem to work. </s>
<s> Router is Linksys N900. </s>
<s> Two wired connections are plugged directly into the router in order to cut down on possible switch issues. </s>
<s> I have two pcs, one on the router, and one on the switch running pingplotter, both losing connection simultaneously. </s>
<s> Disable WiFi and ask Netgear about their latest firmware issues. </s>
<s> If you research this you learn about iPad/phone connection issues but here it extended to PCs as well. </s>
<s> I was this close to returning this Netgear. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The Netgear is a switch, unmanaged, there is no software for it, at least that I'm aware of. </s>
<s> The router is this: http://homestore.cisco.com/en-us/Routers/Linksys-EA4500-Dual-Band-N900-Router-with-Gigabit-USB_stcVVproductId145330245VVcatId543809VVviewprod.htm </s>
<s> I just realized that I had my 2.4 ghz and 5ghz using the same network name...thinking this royally confused the router when anyone sent wireless signals. </s>
<s> Would this account for it? </s>
<s> Just the first 20 minutes with wireless off seems better, time will tell. </s>
<s> I didn't see that router in your posts. </s>
<s> The issue is sadly being copied it seems to other routers so when I look into this I bring another router. </s>
<s> As to you suspicion I can't tell you if that hurts. </s>
<s> The most common issue I encounter is moochers. </s>
<s> Before that were routers that the old Vista Broadcast Flag issue would cause issues. </s>
<s> The moochers still are out there and the broadcast flag is easy to research and resolve. </s>
<s> BUT if you find a router that has that issue you update it or toss it (in my opinion.) </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I've also had these issues when I bypass the router completely, any chance at all this is the switch? </s>
<s> Do I need to put the MAC address for the modem somewhere in the router software? </s>
<s> If you are still having issues with less gear, then you haven't found it. </s>
<s> As to the MAC address, that's well discussed so I will be short. </s>
<s> Only required if your ISP locks the connection to a MAC address. </s>
<s> Otherwise I leave it &quot;stock.&quot; Let me share another story of a person with dropping connections (cable and DSL). </s>
<s> Turns out they were running torrent software. </s>
<s> Even I walked out. </s>
<s> No one can support that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Not running torrents. </s>
<s> I will ask ISP if they lock down address. </s>
<s> Also - replacing the router still seems like best alternative, would you agree? </s>
<s> I don't suppose an 8 lb sledgehammer will resolve the issue, at least favorably. </s>
<s> Can you supply an article that said it was? </s>
<s> Since we don't need a router to connect a PC and test, why isn't that done? </s>
<s> I supplied a little detail about router issues I hit last year. </s>
<s> Netgear was my personal experience and my shop buddies tell me of the others. </s>
<s> It doesn't mean this model has the issue but I keep an eye open for it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> OK - they do not lock to a MAC. </s>
<s> Ready to go out any buy a new router if you believe it will help. </s>
<s> I have had it directly connected to the modem in the past with the same issues, but they (the ISP) cannot see them on the outside. </s>
<s> However, with wireless turned off, it hasn't been tested this way. </s>
<s> I think this may be a muti-tiered issue. </s>
<s> I'm going to hook direct into the modem (both cable and DSL) and see what I can see... </s>
<s> Regarding an article about the sledgehammer being helpful to other than my sanity. </s>
<s> I haven't been able to locate yet and will spend my time resolving, and not destroying, the router. </s>
<s> Now, I'm totally puzzled. </s>
<s> Hooked up the pingplotter to the modem and it's significantly worse. </s>
<s> Right now, loss of a packet every 30 - 60 minutes - not significant, at the modem level, losing packets every 2-3 minutes - pretty significant. </s>
<s> Same with the DSL. </s>
<s> So two different connections both with the same issues, would suggest a wiring issue coming into the house...at least I think. </s>
<s> How can it be worse on the modem than the router, is the router 'cleaning up' the signal? </s>
<s> Workign through this in my head, the problem is before modem, after modem or in modem. </s>
<s> I've ruled out after modem (switch, router ok) ISP has ruled out modem and before modem remotely. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> There apparently was an area problem with DSL so that's cleared up now and I get a clean signal, but why would cable be so bad. </s>
<s> Is error correction that good in the router? </s>
<s> I can discuss how cable can be a problem. </s>
<s> Unlike DSL where each house gets their own connection to a DSLAM (I'm just an electronics engineer and software author) cable is more like a LAN. </s>
<s> So what your neighbors are doing can impact this area's network performance. </s>
<s> Put poor programming practices that can't survive a drop in the connection and you have a recipe for complaints. </s>
<s> While slower DSL is painful to some, it's usually the one with less drops. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I get this, but why am I losing connection when my neighbors stay on? </s>
<s> Wouldn't that root back to my property? </s>
<s> The cable company is watching both of my neighbors connections to be sure it's not a regional issue, they stay on when I drop. </s>
<s> Any chance at all that something in the modem and/or switch causes the internet to drop even at the modem level? </s>
<s> If you are getting drops from dsl/cable with just their gear on all your computers, then you are pretty much done. </s>
<s> If the owner can't remove gear to find the cause then you give them more time. </s>
<s> There are odd houses with power issues but usually the owner knows the lights flicker and you might spot it on your call. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have a pingplotter going and it very rarely drops, if ever when I'm not using. </s>
<s> But when I push traffic at times it goes down, but never while it's idle. </s>
<s> It's almost like the modem is 'overwhelmed', but it's not like Im pushing form every pc at once, generally it's just one, I click on a file to download and it goes down almost instantly. </s>
<s> That's why I keep thinking it's something on my end. </s>
<s> I bring my laptop. </s>
<s> We plug directly into the ISP's supplied gear. </s>
<s> If that drops, it's an ISP issue and we are done. </s>
<s> If it's fine, then you try their PC plugged directly into the gear. </s>
<s> You might have to go back and forth a few times but if the line drops on the client's PC then you have a very odd issue. </s>
<s> Since it is possible to tell a device to reset or drop you pull out a bootable OS such as UBUNTU to load up and download a file. </s>
<s> That test is crucial to tell if the PC has some odd issue. </s>
<s> The neat part about this sort of work is the pay is good. </s>
<s> You get to be nice as possible and the meter runs all the time. </s>
<s> I've seen the meter exceed two thousand bucks on such a call. </s>
