my old pc's mb has three ram slots, and two of the slots have two 128mb ram already plugged.
recently, i buy a 256mb ram so that the pc will now have 512mb memory.
the kind shop assistant recommend me to plug the new 256mb ram into the 1st ram slot so that the system can access the resources more quickly.
but problem's that i don't know which of them is the 1st ram slot!
please help if you could!
:confused:
