Hello, i have a Linksys WRT150N router.
I've had it for well over a year now and uptill now i did not have any problems.
Recently i tried opening a website that i frequently visit but it said &quot;Network Timed Out&quot; I had afeeling that it could be a problem with my router, so i connected the modem directly to my computer without the router and the site loads up perfectly.
This has happened to multiple sites i visit.
Does anyone know how to fix this?
Thanks in advance.
