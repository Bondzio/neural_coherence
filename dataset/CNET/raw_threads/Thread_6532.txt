You could build a high end computer for around $1,000. Check out www.newegg.com. If that is not an option then for what you are wanting to do you really don't need anything special at all. You already have the monitor, so if you could find a low end computer that has a DVD/CD Burner on it then thats all you need. As far as the processor and hard drive goes I'd say a Pentium 4 and maybe an 80GB hard drive so nothing fancy. These guys that are saying go with a dual core processor, I wouldn't go for it. Thats way overkill for what you are wanting to use the computer for.
