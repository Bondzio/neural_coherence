1.3.1	Hey Thnaks .	St
1.3.2	I am using Windows XP home edition .	St
1.3.3	I looked at usbman but could not find anything relevant .	St
1.3.4	As far as the bios , I do n't know how to get into it with the new board .	St
1.4.1	If you ca n't get into the BIOS and you do n't know the make/model of your machine or board , USBMAN wo n't help much .	St
1.4.2	As to the BIOS , check the manual or tell the make/model of machine or board .	St
1.4.3	Generic boards use the Del key , and USBMAN notes that USB should be & quot ; Enabled. & quot ; The error messages in Windows are often mis-programmed and & quot ; denied & quot ; could be because your account is not capable of installing drivers ( Administrator capable ? )	Ques
1.4.4	or the USB ports are disabled .	St
