I have recently bought a 64 GB memory stick and I am having problems opening some files copied on it.
Some windows media files won't open and I get the following message: Windows Media Player cannot play the file.
The Player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file.
I also have similar problems with some power point and word documents.
The USB memory stick is unbranded and is fomated as FAT32.
My operating system is Windows Vista Ultimate
