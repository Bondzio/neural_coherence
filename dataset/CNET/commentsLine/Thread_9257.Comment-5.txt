i knew to up the voltage and correct the timings because i fixed many computers before, just never seen an issue like this.
i figured it out though, it was service pack 2, i reinstalled windows, this time x64 edition, loaded drivers, been running stable since, did memtest overnight no errors, then prime 95 for 5 hours no probs.
thanks
