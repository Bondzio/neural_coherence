<s> I know some motherboards have problems supporting drives of large sizes. </s>
<s> I was thinking of buying a 200 GB harddrive and throwing it in a USB 2.0 enclosure. </s>
<s> I was wondering if it will be supported no matter what since it's coming in through the USB ports or will it still depend on my motherboard? </s>
<s> For example, all Windows 2000 CDs as well as most XP (Pro/Home) CDs will not install and support your 200GB USB 2.0 drive until patches, updates and in the case of Windows 2000, a registry change is made. </s>
<s> USB 1.1 support may be problematic since many USB drive cases omitted USB 1.1 support. </s>
<s> http://www.48bitlba.com notes part of the issues as well so you can get a complete picture of the problems. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
