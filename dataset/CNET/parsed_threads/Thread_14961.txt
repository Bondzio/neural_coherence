<s> I've had my current desktop for about 2 years now. </s>
<s> Back in its day it used to be a BEAST but I'm finding it lagging behind a little. </s>
<s> I'm just going to post a list of my hardware and have you guys point out what you would think would be the highest priority upgrade. </s>
<s> Thanks for all the help! </s>
<s> (Sidenote: My HDD is running out of space, would you recommend just buying an external or getting a new internal and making it a slave drive?) </s>
<s> Mobo: GIGABYTE GA-MA790X-UD4P Processor: AMD Phenom II x4 925 ~2.8GHz (O/C'd to 3.0 GHz) RAM: 4GB GPU: Nvidia GTX 550 ti 1024mb GDDR5 HDD: Hitachi HDP725050GLA360 500GB PSU: (unnamed) 750watt Primary use for this is gaming. </s>
<s> What OS? </s>
<s> You say it's only 2 years old but is lagging. </s>
<s> Personally I wouldn't have thought it was a hardware problem on a quad-core after only 2 years. </s>
<s> Although I see it's overclocked so no doubt you have improved the fans and venting to allow for increased heat. </s>
<s> Other than dust around the fans and vents, I would then look at software itself. </s>
<s> Even after 2 years a system gets clogged up with software installs affecting startup and load on the CPU and RAM with running Processes and Services, so may be you can trim those down. </s>
<s> As to hard drives, I don't think it really matters if it is for storage only. </s>
<s> An internal will increase the load on the PSU but 750s watt should be fine. </s>
<s> However I understand that PSU wattage drops over time, so you could check that. </s>
<s> It's just as easy to copy off personal files onto an external, (and don't forget your backup copies on additional external media), as it is to an internal. </s>
<s> I'm no technician, but I'm guessing that cleaning the inside of the case and housekeeping the install itself would help a lot. </s>

<s> Only an answer to your side note: NEVER use an external hard disk for storage. </s>
<s> It's slow and error-prone. </s>
<s> And most likely you have a SATA drive. </s>
<s> Then the best choice for your new drive is another SATA drive, and those aren't master/slave. </s>
<s> The main reason for performance slowing down gradually is software running. </s>
<s> So the priority upgrade is a simple reinstall of your OS and the applications you need. </s>
<s> Upgrading CPU, RAM or video only is indicated if that particular component is the cause of the machine being too slow. </s>
<s> That depends on what it's being used for and what is slow in particular. </s>
<s> The best remedy for a long boot time, by the way, is installing the OS on a SSD in stead of a HD. </s>
<s> My colleague Bob Proffitt probably would advice you to buy a &quot;hybrid&quot; hard disk and use that to install Windows and programs on, while using your current one only for storage. </s>
<s> But it hardly helps for faster video rendering. </s>
