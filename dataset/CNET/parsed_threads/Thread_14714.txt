<s> Since there seems to be at least 2-3 posts a week about folks looking for a good mid range priced PC, I saw this deal in the Compusa that looked good. </s>
<s> I don't spend TONS of hours shopping around since I am only starting to look for possibly buying a PC (translation = I want one, wife says lets hold off for now...) BUT ANYWAY: http://www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp?product_code=22347&pfp=5105sale For $649.99 HP Pavilion AMD Athlon 64 3400 512 MB Ram 200GB HD Lightscribe Double Layer DVD +R/RW Drive 2nd 16X dvd drive 17&quot; CRT Monitor PLUS $0.01 shipping (penny shipping) PLUS you get the following with any purchase $799 or over (which this is BEFORE the mail in rebates, so I think it counts) Epson Printer/Scanner Netgerar wireless G router Norton System works &* Anti Spam McAfee Internet Security Based on a lot of folks saying the emachine 6212 (Athlon 64 3200, 512 mb, 160gb hd) $550 deal was good a few weeks ago, this seemed like it was at least in the ballpark of that since you get the 3400 and 200 gb hd instead. </s>
<s> Note - if you order online you may not have to pay sales tax either, so that could be factored in. </s>
<s> OR this is one you could pick up in a store as well. </s>
<s> I will say I do not know how &quot;upgradable&quot; the mobo is, but I think the site says it has two memory slots with one used ( not quite as flexible as 4 slots, but one is open I guess) and has agp video slot I think I don't know how good HP is (that statement ought to start a few comments alone...) but this might be a good one. </s>
<s> But Anyway - good deal or not? </s>
<s> As I said, I am both passing this on to folks that are looking, as well as trying to get a sense for me if I do get teh green light to pull the trigger sooner or later. </s>
<s> the hp is not a good deal as the processor is specially made for hp and not upradeable. </s>
<s> also will 40gb really make a big difference for u? </s>
<s> also the hp only come with agp slot and no pci express slot. </s>
<s> No PCI-Express (x16) slot. </s>
<s> ROger </s>
<s> Hi Chip, Yes, I saw that in todays specials that will last until 7 May and it may fit a nitch for some people. </s>
<s> The HP a1022n was just introduced March 31st and appears to be a update of the HP a810n with both having the same motherboard, the only differance being the a810n has a 3300 processor and 160GB HDD. </s>
<s> Comparing the difference of emachine T6212 with the HP a1022n: The HP a1022n: Athlon 64 3400 processor, Socket 754 Integrated graphics, can upgrade to AGP Video Cards. </s>
<s> Has 200GB HDD Price: $649.98 w/17&quot; CRT monitor after rebates. </s>
<s> Maybe printer? </s>
<s> The emachine T6212: Athlon 64 3200 processor, Socket 939 Integrated graphics, can upgrade to PCI-Express x16 Video cards. </s>
<s> Has 160GB HDD Price: When on sale $550 w/17&quot; CRT monitor & printer after rebates. </s>
<s> It may not make a difference to some people not having the latest features for the future like Socket 939 and the PCI-Express video cards, so paying aprx $100 more for the future obsolete Socket 754, AGP Tech, but larger processor and hard drive may be OK for them. </s>
<s> Another that may be of interest (near the price range) that I would consider is the Gateway 827GM Media Center Edition 2005 with TV Tuner: Athlon 64 3500 Processor, Socket 939 Integrated Graphics, can be upgraded to PCI-Express x16 video cards. </s>
<s> Has 200GB HDD Price: At Circuit City, $724.99 after rebates or... $989,97 with 17&quot; LCD Flat-Panel Nonitor and Printer after rebates. </s>
<s> Err..... the 3400 processor is a regular AMD Athlon 64 3400 processor. </s>
<s> The only weird (*******) processor made for HP by AMD is the 3300 which is not listed at AMD. </s>
