answer to the 2nd question first: more than likely the cable companies that give you that answer are expecting to provide analog channels after the cutoff date or expect you to get a cable box.
it has not been made clear to me which way they are planning.
you might ask your provider which way they plan on going, if they will tell you.
now the other question.
i see no reason that integrated audio would not work with this if your other components are working properly.
