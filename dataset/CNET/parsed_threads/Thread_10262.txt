<s> My system has 1 IDE port which is taken up by the boot hard drive and the DVD drive. </s>
<s> I have a second hard drive which is also IDE but is connected to the 1st SATA port using a SATA-&gt;IDE converter. </s>
<s> So far, I have had no problems using this system, however recently, my much larger USB external hard drive failed. </s>
<s> In looking for a replacement, I was wondering if there would be any problems if I were to use an internal SATA drive for storage as well as the other two drives. </s>
<s> I can't think of any reason why it wouldn't work, but I thought I'd just check before spending the cash! </s>
<s> Cheers </s>
<s> Did the external harddrive itself is bad or is it the case is bad? </s>
<s> Is this an ide or sata? </s>
<s> Personally I probably would do it this way; harddrives are so inexpensive now, I would just go and buy another one (lot less problem). </s>
<s> I've had a 400 Gig SATA drive connected to a SATA and power connector using 6&quot; cables. </s>
<s> The drive sat outside my PC. </s>
<s> Soooo, it was internal drive on the outside. </s>
<s> No USB needed. </s>
<s> SATA is easy. </s>
