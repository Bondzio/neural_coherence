the problem with oem type systems is you're &quot;dead-end&quot; path to better options or upgrades or very limited.
review your manual and find out if and what upgrades are available or visit the dell support website.
i provide celeron d link as dell model 3000 also was sold as such.
the intel info is here:   if that class of cpu(find yours) then see if adding a higher ghz rating is possible.
the cpu itself will drop-in and should be seen automatically and be reset as so.
however, that's not always a given with oem type systems and you may need to reset the bios to accept the new cpu.
as for duo-mode cpu, nope.
you have a different class of cpu, though don't take my word for it, recheck the specs.
