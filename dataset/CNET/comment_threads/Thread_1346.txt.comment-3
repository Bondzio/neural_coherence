Don't take anything for granted and recheck all setting and cabling.
Next try moving the monitor or system to a different location and outlet.
If it settles down then, you have &quot;RF outside interference&quot; of some sort.
Last, its possible some damage may have been done during the move and its starting to fail.
If under warranty, use it don't mention the move.
