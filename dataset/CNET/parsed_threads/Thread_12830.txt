<s> I am a novice with computer-related issues and would appreciate some advice with the issue that I am having with the signal from my wireless router. </s>
<s> I have a Westell Versalink 327W from Verizon. </s>
<s> I had to relocate it to the basement of my home. </s>
<s> The signal that I receive on the first floor is excellent. </s>
<s> The signal is very poor/nonexistent on the second floor. </s>
<s> My question - is there anything that can be done to the versalink router to increase the signal that it puts out or should I purchase another router. </s>
<s> If I need to purchase another router, what would you recommend. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Or tried a directional antenna like the CANTENNA? </s>
<s> My neighbor has the 327w and you can replace the antenna with ease. </s>

<s> Do I need to purchase a specific type or brand of antenna? </s>
<s> There are dozens out there at newegg.com geeks.com cantenna.com But I just posted too fast here. </s>
<s> The 327w is DSL so it can't be limited to the basement. </s>
<s> Any phone outlet would do fine. </s>
<s> Why would I move such to the basement and pay more for better antennas? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It is contected to a pc in the basement via ethernet cable. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
