actually, windows has nothing to do with it.
using the same ssid is common (think of when you're using a wireless service in a large hotel.
they have multiple wireless access points with same ssid.
otherwise they'd have to publish the name of every single one).
i'm just not sure if i need to do something else since i'm using routers instead of dedicated wireless access points.
