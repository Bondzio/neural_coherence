I recently purchased a new computer and I'm curious as to how good/bad it is?
How long before I will have to replace it?
The websites I viewed gave me mixed answers.
CPU - AMD Athlon 64 3400+ Motherboard - GA-K8NS Pro nForce3 250 Video Card - Geforce FX 5700 LE (256MB DDR) Harddrive - 80 gbs Memory - 512 mbs pc3200 400mhz (Planning to upgrade soon) Those are the basics.
I didn't include the DVD/CD-RW drive cause I'm lazy.
But that is much easier to upgrade than a processor and motherboard.
