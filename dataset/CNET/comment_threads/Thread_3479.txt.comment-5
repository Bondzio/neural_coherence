The way it's set up is 2 screws on 1 side, and 1 screw in the other side.
That's what the bay allows.
And no i'm not 100% sure it was the hard drive.
It could have probably been a number of things, it's just at the time I was installing the hard drive since I got the 300 watt power supply at a local shop (not enough connector's though, but that's in another post ).
The system isn't shaking much now but it was before.
It's just humming along nicely.
I probably will look into either the washers or these things I saw at the computer shop that are plastic and go around the power supply and some for the drives to reduce shaking or whatever.
