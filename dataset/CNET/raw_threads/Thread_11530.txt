Hopped out to the inet and the entire system shut down. Power off then power on produced nothing. I disconnected everything - powered off and then on - nothing. Receiving power, fans working and that's it. The dvd writer doesn't seem to be receiving power however. I've called Dell and am waiting on a fix. Thought someone here might shed some insight. Could there a be a relationship with the dvd burner?
