If the wieght of that HD is shaking the desk, then it certainly is a cheap desk.
Any noise is not good but if your old HD was exceptionaly quiet expect a little more with the 120gb though not that much more or basically the same level.
I suggest you snug the mounting screws but not &quot;too tight&quot;.
You maybe hearing the &quot;resonance&quot; of the system case metal and if so, use small rubber washers(provided they fit) or plastic(very thin) to relp reduce resonance.
Also, check your fans as they're a known source of noisy operation especially if you knock off dusty build-up, clean them anyways.
You can try to set the system on a more sturdy area to see where the noise maybe coming from too.
I hope this helps... good luck -----Willy
