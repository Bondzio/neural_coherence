1.1.2	I plan to have: Intel Core i7 3770K ASUS Sabertooth Thermal Armour AMD Radeon 7970 (Overclocked ~10-20%) SSD HDD 8GB 1333MHz RAM	St

1.3.1	this card.	St
1.3.2	I like headroom so I'd opt for an 850 or maybe a 950....depending on what's reasonably priced at the 850-950 range.	St
1.3.3	VAPCMD	St
