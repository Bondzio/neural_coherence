i won't try to add to all the technical posting.
i'll merely say this.
i have five ssds in my pc (240gb ocz agility 4 for win8pro + apps, two 80gb intel x25m in raid-0 for ea origin games, two 120gb samsung 830s in raid-0 for steam games) plus another four tbs on three regular platter hds that contain my data.
my present pc build is rock-solid reliable and faster than crap through a goose.
go get one or two.
you won't be sorry.
the only caveat is that some ssds with sandforce controllers are less stable than they ought to be, so research them before buying.
good luck, and enjoy the ridiculous speed increase!
