6750	2	59706	708952	708875	R. Proffitt	1/23/05 4:43 PM	1.10649858E12	No drivers exist.	The unit works as a CDROM until you install CDRW software. Many don't know this. The number seems a little off? Bob

6750	4	59706	709171	709015	R. Proffitt	1/23/05 7:02 PM	1.10650692E12	That explains it.	The software ID will be some &quot;other&quot; number. How about the model number that's on the drive? In closing does http://www.cdburnerxp.se/ work with it? Bob
