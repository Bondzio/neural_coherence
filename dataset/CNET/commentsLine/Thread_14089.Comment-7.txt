i wanted to share that these forums are all volunteer, all member to member.
which means you get to try a little harder.
no paid staff also means that a few members get upset over &quot;tech support.&quot; i apologize for my analogy but i have many more to choose from.
but let's get back to your discussion.
all that i wanted to share i have, now it's time for you to decide if it's worth helping others help you.
