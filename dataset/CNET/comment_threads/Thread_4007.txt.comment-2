But if you're trying to separate the pairs within an ethernet cable and run two digital signals through it, that isn't going to work.
Sure, only two of the 4 pairs are needed for data but that doesn't mean the other two pairs are just wasted.
Otherwise, you'd see transmit and receive pairs only.
Someone here might be able to explain why the unused pairs in the 8 wire system are required.
Perhaps it's hardware handshaking or some such.
I really don't know....but you need all 8 and not just 4.
No splitting or cable, Y connectors or un-twisting longer than necessary.
