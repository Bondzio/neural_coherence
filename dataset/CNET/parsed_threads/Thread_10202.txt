<s> I got a brand new hp computer a few days ago and now my cd drive is not working. </s>
<s> The official name for it is &quot;LightScribe DL 16X DVD +/-R/RW drive&quot;. </s>
<s> It can play DVDs but it can't read instalation CDs, music CDs, or burned Cds. </s>
<s> I thought it may be that it just wasn't clean but it can't even read one of those CDs you put in to clean the drive. </s>
<s> So, anybody know what I can do? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
