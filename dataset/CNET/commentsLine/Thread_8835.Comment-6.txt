if anyone has priced dual layer media lately?
i had heart failure when i did.
i can buy another drive for the price of four disks, or a hell'of'a large hd for a few more disks.
didn't want to get into the middle of this conversation, but dl-dvd disks are just too pricy for me.
then again you can still use single layer disk in a dual layer drive like i do.
i bought the drive before i priced the disks.
and they are slooooow to burn.
