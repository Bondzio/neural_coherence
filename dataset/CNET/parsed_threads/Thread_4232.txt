<s> I have a brand new computer - HP a6218x with Vista Home Premium - I used the CD/DVD Rewriter once to copy some photos (wiht Roxio Creator) and since using that one copy, it won't recognise any discs and won't play music cds either. </s>
<s> Device Manager shows that the hardware is fine and the driver is fine - I couldn't run a diagnostic test as it requires inserting a CD. </s>
<s> I'm not very knowledgeable with computers (in the technical sense)but have tried to check this out and it still won't work no matter what I do. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> hanks </s>
<s> Do a little digging...the ANSWERS are here in STORAGE as well as other forums. </s>
<s> And there's always the MFG you bought then PC from. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Actually, it's been a really interesting journey and I have no idea what I REALLY did but it all worked. </s>
<s> I couldnt' find anything so went on the internet in general and found anh answer under Techblissonline......................he had me go in and disable Vista's built-in CD and DVD Burning or recording features. </s>
<s> I made a change in the registery where I typed in manually NOCDBurning Datavalue 1. </s>
<s> Then it worked for a while and didn't. </s>
<s> So I figured, maybe the program still exists. </s>
<s> So I went in and deleted the Windows burning program from the list of programs. </s>
<s> Now everything works super. </s>
<s> Hope it continues to!! </s>
