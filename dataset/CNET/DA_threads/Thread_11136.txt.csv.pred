1.1.1	Hi, I was hoping if someone could tell me how to booktype my Sony DRX840U 20x External Dual-Layer DVD Burner.	St
1.1.2	Thanks Alot	St
1.2.1	What software are you using to write your DVD's?	St
1.2.2	ImgBurn will booktype if your drive supports it.	St
1.2.3	If you do not know if your drive supports it, try DVDInfo or Nero's Drivespeed to check.	St
1.3.1	Your software does that and your drive supports it.	St
1.3.2	BUT!!!	St
1.3.3	This has NEVER been the reason why your DVDs created in said drives don't play on DVD players.	St
1.3.4	Don't waste people's time chasing down that dead end.	St

1.4.1	Hi, The programs I use are clone dvd and 1 Click Dvd Copy Pro.	St
1.4.2	I like them because they rip and burn.	St
1.4.3	Does IMG Burn do the same??	St
1.4.4	?	Ques
1.5.1	Hi Absoluttely, I have a very old NEC dvd burner single layer.	St
1.5.2	I downloaded firmware and flashed the drive.	St
1.5.3	Now it Burns +R to DVD-ROM.	St
1.5.4	Also it know supports double layer recording.	St
1.5.5	How do you explain that ??	Ques
1.5.6	The reason for my post is because I did it such a long time ago that I have forgotten how to do it and do not want to brick my drive.	St
1.5.7	I just want to play videos for family who still own old dvd players that do not support +R or -R.	St
1.6.1	I decline to duplicate web content about firmware updates that add capability.	St
1.6.2	If you want to discuss it, supply links to the firmware and the drive so I don't have to dig it up.	St
1.6.3	The booktype and it's relationship to DVD(+/-R) media not playing is well discussed.	St
1.6.4	It's not the solution and as such I will not discuss it.	St
1.6.5	Why?	St
1.6.6	It's a deadend.	St
1.6.7	Bob	St
