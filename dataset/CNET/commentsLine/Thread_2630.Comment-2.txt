what does disk management say about the disk?
is a not too clear article about it.
the most important thing: don't change anything.
don't chkdsk.
don't defrag.
just look with disk management and tell what you see.
i assume your off-line backup still is ok. so you won't lose anything, whatever you do.
still, it makes sense to be careful.
