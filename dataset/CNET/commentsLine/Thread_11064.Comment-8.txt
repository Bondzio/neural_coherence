it's how these &quot;routers&quot; perform the internet sharing.
since an inbound connection is not routed to any machine unless you configure the router to do so, these are dropped and well, how would they get to your files?
i wish i could write it in less technical terms but my bet is that this is why everyday folk gobble up this firewall feature without much research.
let's say that all old routers that didn't have this new firewall were vulnerable.
you would think this would be marketed and create millions of sales to replace the old gear.
