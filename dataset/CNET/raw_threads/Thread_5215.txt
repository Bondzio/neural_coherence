Only problem is, when the the PC boots it gets as far as the black XP 'loading' screen, then re-starts. So far I have tried swapping out the hard drive for a known good one. Still get the same result. New motherboard require? any suggestions?? Cheers.

Here's the spec: A Packard Bell ixtreme 9200 i package containing: P3 1Ghz, 128MB SDRAM, 40GB UDMA HDD, Creative SB Live, GeForce 2 MX 32MB. As far as I know all of these are the proginal compoenets and have hot been upgraded/changed etc. The problem has only recently occurred, so I'm guessing that one of the components has had it. Based on my very limited knowledge, I'm guessing perhaps the Motherboard, or possibly the power supply. Just wondering if anyones encountered a simlar problem. Thanks

Even with what you've noted, any one of the items on the list can fail and cause the reboot. And without any story to give wieght to any specific software issue, I still think there's more to be told. Here's something to try. SAFE MODE. What happens? Bob
