<s> I ran an erase program and created a master boot record on a hard drive.in a spare USB external enclosure. </s>
<s> When I plug it in I can hear the USB device recognition sound from the OS but the drive isn't recognized. </s>
<s> If I plug in any other hard drive it is immediately recognized and accessible.. How can I force the system to open the drive and permit reformatting or whatever is necessary? </s>
<s> Some think an erased drive would show in Explorer. </s>
<s> It won't. </s>
<s> And that's proper. </s>
<s> Did you try creating a partition and formatting that partition (I suggest the quick format)? </s>
