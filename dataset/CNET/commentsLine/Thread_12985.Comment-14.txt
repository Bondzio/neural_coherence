imagine a flash memory card that held 40 gb for about $500.
that would allow you to carry your hard drive in your pocket - that would allow you to have computers all over the place, cheap ones, with small hard drives with just an os on it - you plug in your flash memory and you have your computer there - would not need laptops if these computers were all over the place - airplanes - hotel rooms etc.
would need a new os that would allow total running of programs from the flash memory without needing to install anything on the computer's hard drive - but imagine the use of all these kiosks all over the place - it would be great.
