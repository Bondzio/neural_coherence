Sadly, if cleaning doesn't clear that up (you have to try some dozen times, then you have to decide if its worth it for a new printhead.
The &quot;chip&quot; on the inkcarts was visible on all the Epson models I've seen.
It's a little green/blue circuit board.
Refilling might be possible, but I never have.
