1.1.1	This is a small issue... COMPUTER: I have a Dell Dimension 8400 (P4 3.0GHz, 2.5GB RAM, 80GB SATA drive).	St
1.1.2	Original power supply is 350 watts.	St
1.1.3	MY MODIFICATIONS: * Added a Linksys Ethernet NIC, on-board connection died * PCI card with 4 USB 2.0 ports * Combo Firewire (2 ports)/USB 2.0 (4 ports) PCI expansion card (bought but haven't installed, so count it) * 2GB of DDR2 SDRAM, 533 MHz, on top of my original 512MB Other than that I am running everything on external power, e.g.	St
1.1.4	external HDD, flash drives which are bus-powered.	St
1.1.5	Between MS Office documents, music collection, and pictures, I have finally gotten to 2/3 full on my original HDD and want to add on another SATA drive in the 160-250GB range.	St
1.1.6	MY QUESTION... Do I need a new power supply?	St
1.1.7	If so, what do you recommend?	St
1.1.8	Is there some formula I could use to calculate my needs?	St
1.1.9	It is a Dell so I also have concerns about proprietary equipment dimensions, cabling, etc.	St
1.1.10	Also, does anyone have any successes with any hard drive makers?	Ques
1.1.11	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	http://www.atxpowersupplies.com/choosing-a-power-supply.htm HD... their all good, untill they die and you have no &quot;backup&quot;	St
1.3.1	The Dell psus are darn good, though many think they're not.	St
1.3.2	The point is they do deliver the juice until it fails like any other psu.	St
1.3.3	I suggest you calculate your actual power demands and add on top of that at least 50% or simply double it.	Sug
1.3.4	Because you have a Dell, you do need to be sure it is compatible to physically as well deliver the added wattage in its space.	St
1.3.5	You can check at: http://www.pcpowerandcooling.com and follow their lead on suggestions.	Sug
1.3.6	If price affects you then find what they offer in wattage and then look for another *namebrand* psu of similar rating.	St
1.3.7	tada -----Willy	St
1.4.1	just leave your original power supply alone.	St
1.4.2	it's more than adequate for your usage.	St
1.4.3	as for hard drives, any name brand will do: western digital, seagate, hitachi.	St
1.4.4	i'd only get a maxtor (since they're a subsidiary of seagate now) if it was cheaper than the other brands i mentioned.	St
1.5.1	Sorry for the delay - thanks to all the advice.	Polite
1.5.2	I kept the current PS, might swap out hard drives but everything seems to be working fine.	St
1.6.1	good thing u kept the old psu b/c dell has there psus specially made for there mobos so even if u did try and get anotehr one it wouldnt work believe me thats how my old pc was lol	St
