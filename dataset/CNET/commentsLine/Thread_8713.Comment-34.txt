cut one or two 120mm holes in the floor of your box.
screw the box to a two or three inch tall wood frame the same size as case.
add casters, the biggest auto air filter you can fit on the underside of the frame, and up-firing fans.
had to spot cool the northbridge and memory.
block exhaust except where it can help cool something, like front panel holes around dvd drives, etc.
with no exhaust fan running, a positive pressure of cool, filtered air will fill the box as long as the system fan lead is hot.
by the way, i use duct tape and weatherstrip foam to mount fans, no reason to obcess when tape works great.
