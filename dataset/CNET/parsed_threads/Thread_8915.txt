<s> I'm currently enrolled in school and I'm working on obtaining my CISCO CCNA certificate. </s>
<s> My school also offers a RedHat... Is RedHat really important to have for a career or not? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> As with any certificate it's value will greatly depend on what kind of job you plan to get, and how your employer views them. </s>
<s> For example, if you are going to be working for an organization with only Windows software, a RedHat endorsement is going to be worth very little. </s>
<s> But since you are still in school, I will assume that you do not know where you will be working after you graduate, so it probably wouldn't hurt to have it. </s>
<s> But from personal experience I have seen very few jobs that were looking for a RedHat certificate. </s>
<s> It is always good to have options though, if Linux is something that interests you anyway. </s>
<s> Most employers are going to be more concerned about your experience, but having some certificates might give you and edge to at least get an interview. </s>
<s> You might be better off considering getting something like an A+ certificate or something more generalized that can applied to many career options. </s>
