(not of same make or model) or would this be a bad idea? or should i contact Samsung for help? or would it be possible to take apart the hard drive and swap the disk over with another hard drive of equal capacity? help much apreciated.

Ive already found the same drive on eBay so i should be well away. thanks again

Proffitt	8/10/07 5:28 PM	1.18676688E12	An explanation about that smoke.	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_smoke Sorry but once the smoke gets out that chip's function went away with that smoke. Sorry if I was unclear. Another time honored hard disk recovery method is to take a working drive and steal it's circuit board and put that on the dead drive. That seems to be something hard to swallow to the would be data recovery person since you might end up with 2 dead drives. But that's the price of getting the data back (possibly.) If this fails then the repair is beyond the home DIY methods and you drop a note to drivesavers.com Bob
