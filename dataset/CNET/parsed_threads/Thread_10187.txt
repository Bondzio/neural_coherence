<s> I tried to update an ASUS Bios (K8VSEDX) as I was having some operating issues. </s>
<s> The upgrade seemed to be successful, but now the computer is dead. </s>
<s> It provides no signal to the monitor so I can't boot from a floppy or CD. </s>
<s> Any thoughts would be most appreciated. </s>
<s> offer you the option of making a backup of your original bios information (and it puts it onto the floppy disk you used to flash with)....can you boot up with that disk and restore the original? </s>
<s> TONI </s>
<s> resetting the cmos to see if it is a total loss. </s>
<s> Usually Jumper pin # 1 or 2 on the motherboard although some vary. </s>
