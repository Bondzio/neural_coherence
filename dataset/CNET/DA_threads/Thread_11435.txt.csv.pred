1.1.1	I had a computer that died a few years ago (motherboard).	St
1.1.2	I have kept the HDD (has XP sp1 installed) around because there is some data on it that I want to keep.	St
1.1.3	I built a new computer with Vista installed, and I threw this old HDD into it to recover the stuff I wanted off it.	St
1.1.4	I'm able to access the HDD, but I can't open any files or copy any files out of the &quot;owner&quot; folder because I don't have admin permissions on the drive.	St
1.1.5	I'm assuming this is because the admin name/password on my new computer are different than on the one this HDD was in.	St
1.1.6	I don't remember the password or admin name of that old computer either...I might be able to guess it, but when I go into the security properties it only gives me the options to select my current user acct or my current admin acct.	St
1.1.7	I was wondering if there is a way to trick it into just letting me copy the files off and accessing them on the HDD with Vista on it, cause right now I can't even copy them.	Sug
1.2.1	Use these.	St
1.2.2	XP TAKE OWNERSHIP	St
1.3.1	I appreciate it.	Polite
1.3.2	That's such a simple process.	St
1.3.3	I actually got it off with no problems using Zero Assumption Recovery.	St
1.3.4	I previously bought this program to recover data off a WD Worldbook that died.	St
