you want to look at the physical size and specs for bestec model#.
once you have that in hand, you compare to any similar or direct replacement psu.
so be 100% sure the model# is what is stated on the decal/sticker located on the psu.
then do your search.
if as robert states is correct, you maybe lucky and have a common atx-12v type sized psu, which many are generic to your needs.
btw, having more wattage and/or connections won't hurt.
