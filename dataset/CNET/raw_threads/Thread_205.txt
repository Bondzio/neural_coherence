It works fine with ethernet, but when I try to connect through wireless its status is continually 'Acquiring Network Address'. I have tried using the winsoc fix, to no avail. Any ideas?

Did you do the usual ipconfig /release all and then disable the ethernet in device manager? Is this network WIFI setup per our forum sticky and does this wifi work at free wifi hotspots? Bob
