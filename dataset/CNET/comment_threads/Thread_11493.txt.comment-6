John, I appreciate the info you have provided also...but the new cord seems to have fixed the problem.
I guess a new cord would have fixed the adaptor end you were talking about too!
As to the uninstalling being a problem, dealing with my cd rom issue taught me that this is much more of a problem than I ever imagined.
I will check this out if the problem crops up again.
Thanks everybody for their help!
Jackie
