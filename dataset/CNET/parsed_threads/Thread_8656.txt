<s> I have a Dell Inspiron 8600 running Windows XP SP2 with a TSSTcorp DVD+RW TS-L632D optical drive installed. </s>
<s> This is a replacement for a similar NEC drive. </s>
<s> When I insert a CD or a DVD, the drive thinks it is a new blank disc. </s>
<s> This is the same behavior that caused me to replace the NEC drive. </s>
<s> The drive is able to write files to the disc. </s>
<s> Occasionally, if I go to the device manager and inspect the drive's properties, the drive will start spinning very fast and if I then double click the drive's icon in My Computer, it will read the files. </s>
<s> This is what I have tried so far: Windows reinstall repair (booting from the DVD!) </s>
<s> Uninstalling the drive and rebooting. </s>
<s> Uninstalling CloneDVD and rebooting. </s>
<s> It's not a dirty lens or a failing drive since both drives exhibit the same behavior. </s>
<s> I think I've stumped every Dell technician in New Delhi (and they have really tried to solve this). </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be much appreciated. </s>
<s> Removed the usual registry entries named UPPERFILTERS and LOWERFILTERS? </s>
<s> If you don't know what these are or if your Dell support didn't do this there is some hope. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
<s> Wow, thanks for the prompt reply! </s>
<s> I checked HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Control/Class/{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318} and found no UpperFilter or LowerFilter entries. </s>
<s> I believe the techs did remove those when they were trying to fix the problem. </s>
<s> I also checked ControlSet002 and ControlSet003 under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM just in case they are relevant. </s>
<s> They had no filter entries either. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I haven't found a ControlSet001, only CurrentControlSet, 002, and 003. </s>
<s> Looks to be there. </s>
<s> Next time just search for UPPERFILTERS and share what keys you find as well as the LOWERFILTERS ones. </s>
<s> Since no 2 windows machines are the same, you get to help us help you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Had the same prob they are right try to remove the upper and lower filters But it kept coming back to me!!!!!!!!!!!! </s>
<s> I found out that the back up feature of norton 360 was causing it, I have since stopped using the back up and it had never happened again </s>
<s> When I searched on UpperFilters, I came across numerous entries for other devices and then came across an entry in the following key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet002\Enum\CdRom_NEC_DVD+RW_ND-5100A___________10AC____\5&1517b2fe&0. </s>
<s> I'm not sure how many underscores are in the key name. </s>
<s> If I try to delete the UpperFilters entry here I get an error message box titled &quot;Error Deleting Values&quot; with the message &quot;Unable to delete all specified values.&quot; I also found an UpperFilters entry under the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet002\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}. </s>
<s> This was the key that the Dell tech asked me to look in along with ControlSet001 and ControlSet002. </s>
<s> I thought that I had deleted it but it was there. </s>
<s> I've deleted it and will now restart and see if it made any difference. </s>
<s> After rebooting, the first data CD I put in was read correctly. </s>
<s> After that, it went back to the same old behavior thinking every disc I put in was blank. </s>
<s> I rechecked the registry but the UpperFilter entries were still gone. </s>
<s> I think I may be ready to reinstall Windows. </s>
<s> Is that my best course of action at this point? </s>
<s> How old? </s>
<s> How long since you used a CD/DVD lens cleaner? </s>
<s> Be aware that many would rather reload the OS ten times than replace a possibly bad drive. </s>
<s> I can't figure out why. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I purchased a replacement drive at Dell's suggestion and it displays the same symptoms. </s>
<s> I don't think it is the drive. </s>
<s> Also, When I did a repair reinstall of Windows the computer read the CD just fine. </s>
<s> You didn't tell. </s>
<s> Also I can't tell what CD/DVD software you use. </s>
<s> Some is out of date (or you have the Norton) or you have some combo of software that is toxic. </s>
<s> Such details are not here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I am running Norton Security Center, but I don't use it for backups. </s>
<s> For that I use Bounce Back by CMS. </s>
<s> I used to use Easy CD Creator Platinum 5 but it started causing an error some months ago and I no longer attempt to use it. </s>
<s> However, I haven't yet uninstalled it. </s>
<s> I also recently tried out CloneDVD but it didn't meet my needs so I uninstalled it. </s>
<s> Any clues there? </s>
<s> Robert </s>
<s> If you want to test it, do your repair install and carefully test when it breaks by using said software titles. </s>
<s> Then complain to that title's maker for an update. </s>

<s> This issue always comes down the above issues PLUS one more. </s>
