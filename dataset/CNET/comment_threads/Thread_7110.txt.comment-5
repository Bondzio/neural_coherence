Thanks to you both for those thoughts and observations.
So to confirm, I think that you are suggesting that my proposed approach should work and I can stop worrying about crossover cables.
Sunwatcher, terminating the cable runs with RJ45 plugs and connecting directly to the hardware is definitely an option to consider.
I had planned on color coding the keystone connectors to identify the outlets origin but of course I could equally use that approach with the plugs.
Thanks again guys.
