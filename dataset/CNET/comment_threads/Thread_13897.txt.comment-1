I installed a new power supply today -- and watched the cpu temp climb from 97.7 to 122F in one minute while the computer was idle.
CPU fan is working and was rated for this cpu.
I would really prefer to have this computer to work without a babysitter.
Thanks for the great ideas, but what to do now?
The new power supply seems more robust than the old one so that's something at least.... System: Abit Kv7-v mobo AMD 2900 cpu 450 watt power supply (newly replaced.)
512 mb ddr 400/pc3200 ram Radeon 7000 series video card/64mb ddr onboard AGP sound card& lan card are on the motherboard.
Running xp pro sp2
