The second option should have a total of $280.
And for the cpu's, I would go with the Core 2 b/c of it's solid performance with better graphics cards.
Better cpu's tend to work better with th faster video cards, you'll even see a 40-50 fps increase with the Core 2 compared to the Athlon X2, trust me.
