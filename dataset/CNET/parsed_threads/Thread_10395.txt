<s> Good day, my friends. </s>
<s> I'm having a Samsung Galaxy Note II, more commonly knows as the 'Phablet&quot;. </s>
<s> Initially I was happy that I needn't invest in a tablet as this is combination of both the interfaces. </s>
<s> Well, later I was really fascinated by the Windows 8 Pro Tablet that had come up in the market, and I had wished I had one. </s>
<s> So basically my question is like, will buying a Windows 8 Pro Tablet render my 'Phablet' useless? </s>
<s> Or is there anyone out there, who inspite of having a Phablet owns Tablet? </s>
<s> Please provide me with some details! </s>
<s> Thank you very much for the help in advance! </s>
<s> I'm not sure I understand your concern, but doesn't this device support bluetooth? </s>
<s> If so, you can buy a $15 adapter for the laptop and copy stuff back and forth. </s>
<s> I have an LG smart phone that works like that, although I've never had any other brand. </s>
<s> I do have an Android based Kindle Fire which I can connect to my laptop via a micro USB cable, and it works just fine as well. </s>
<s> ` Good luck. </s>
<s> I understand that you've got a 'smartphone' and not a 'phablet'. </s>
<s> But my question is will a Phablet-Tablet-Laptop combination make sense? </s>
<s> only have a bicycle. </s>
<s> Others only have a car. </s>
<s> Some have both. </s>
<s> Depends on their needs. </s>
<s> Same with you. </s>
<s> What are your needs? </s>
<s> You didn't tell. </s>
<s> How about the new Asus Fonepad? </s>
<s> That's a 7&quot; tablet (like the Nexus 7 or the iPad mini) that doubles as a phone. </s>
<s> Maybe that's what you were looking for but didn't know it existed. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> Well, that example's good. </s>
<s> Basically I'm a 11th grade student. </s>
<s> So will the Acer Windows 8 Pro Tablet supplement my Galaxy Note II? </s>
<s> I....... 1. </s>

<s> Anyways, now can you tell me? </s>
<s> Those 11 to 13 inch Utlrabooks look closer to your needs. </s>

<s> Currently, I've already got a very high performant, top notch Laptop. </s>
<s> But based on my requirements, my question is whether a Tablet will fit in, in spite of having a Phablet and a Laptop? </s>
<s> At the office we have many tablets and they all fit in. </s>
<s> Why they do is because we work on apps and need a collection of devices. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> But all I wanna know, is whether anyone out there own a Phablet and a Tablet, and a Laptop. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info, anyways! </s>
<s> But I rarely carry them all except to the demos. </s>
<s> Again, we sell this. </s>
<s> What we use is well, what we use. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> While I don't have a phablet and a tablet, here's my take on it. </s>
<s> Consider your &quot;phablet&quot;. </s>
<s> Just what is a phablet anyway? </s>
<s> It's an attempt to give you the utility of a smartphone and a tablet in one device. </s>
<s> Let's put it another way. </s>
<s> Your &quot;phablet&quot; is just a very big smartphone, at 5.5&quot;, a lot bigger than the typical smartphone (say, a Galaxy S4). </s>
<s> But, it's still smaller than a 7&quot; tablet and a lot smaller than a 10&quot;+ tablet. </s>
<s> Just as your Galaxy Note might be easier to navigate and view because of its larger screen, getting a full size tablet will also improve your experience over what you have in the same way for the same reason. </s>
<s> But, there's an obvious cost. </s>
<s> The larger full-size tablet, is just that, larger. </s>
<s> You're not going to carry around a 10.1&quot; or 11.6&quot; or 12.5&quot; Windows 8 Pro Tablet as your phone. </s>
<s> Even a 7&quot; tablet is really pushing the envelope. </s>
<s> Now, only you know for sure what's useful for you, but I'll try to answer your basic questions plus a few more. </s>
<s> Will a Windows 8 Pro Tablet be useful for you in a way that your Note isn't? </s>
<s> Probably yes. </s>
<s> You already said you wished you had one. </s>
<s> Will a Windows 8 Pro Tablet replace your Note? </s>
<s> I seriously doubt it (unless you plan on carrying it in a backpack with a bluetooth hands-free perpetually in your ear). </s>
<s> You're not going to carry your tablet everywhere, and your Note still offers you convenience that a smaller smartphone doesn't have. </s>
<s> Will your Windows 8 Pro Tablet replace your laptop? </s>
<s> Again, probably not. </s>
<s> Even the best and biggest ones fall a little short of the typical laptop or ultrabook. </s>
<s> Everyone is different. </s>
<s> For some, the Note is too big for a phone and too small for a tablet. </s>
<s> For others, it's the perfect compromise. </s>
<s> I imagine you'll probably use the Note the way you're using it now. </s>
<s> You'd likely use the tablet when the Note falls short, when you want a better movie viewing experience or easier data input, but still want extreme portability. </s>
<s> Last, you'll use your laptop when you really need the best performance and the convenience of more ergonomic data entry and viewing. </s>
<s> You didn't mention it, but you'd also probably use a desktop or at least a docking station if you spend any serious amount of time in front of your computer and don't want to end up with some sort of repetitive stress disorder. </s>
<s> Personally, I use a cell phone, a 7&quot; android tablet (which still fits in my pocket, but would never suit me as a phone), and a desktop PC (I do too much work at my computer to tolerate using a laptop, but I do have one for times when I need to do serious work on the road). </s>
<s> Good luck with whatever you decide. </s>
<s> Remember, there are no wrong answers here. </s>
<s> There are many, many choices. </s>
<s> Pick what works best for you. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot porsche10x! </s>
<s> That seems convincing! </s>
<s> Now I've got a hang of it. </s>
<s> Thanks a ton for getting me understood about the whole thing! </s>
<s> Good day! </s>
<s> I vote this to be the 'best' answer. </s>
