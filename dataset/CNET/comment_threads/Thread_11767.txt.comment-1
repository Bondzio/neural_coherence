Hey, i just built a new computer that should be wrecking the performance of my old one.
It does run smoothly and i haven't had any issues yet, it runs games just a little better than my old PC.
In certain games on my old PC id get around 100fps and now its only around 125-150 and i think something is holding it back.
I'm going to list my specs and see what you guys think.
PSU maybe?
-Sabertooth 990fx R2.0 motherboard -AMD FX 9590 5.0 GHZ CPU -EVGA GTX 760 4g -Coolermaster HAF case -Corsair H60 water cooler -128gig Kingston SSD + 1tb 7200rpm HDD - 1 stick of 8gig gskill RAM -Coolermaster GX Bronze 650W PSU - Windows 7 pro I'd appreciate any feedback on what (or if) you think think is stopping this from making higher fps numbers.
