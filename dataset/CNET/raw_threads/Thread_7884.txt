Is it OK to buy a case from Redstar? Is 400watt PSU enough to supply all the power even if I buy the GTS video card? Note: I'll be running XP, I'll update to vista only when it's absolutely needed (I want to keep my XP as long as possible) Thanks, J.M.

I have an all too similar system that peaks out at 165 Watts on the AC meter (I have a Watt meter.) So that gives you a 50 percent load on the 400 Watt PSU. If you load up the machine with much more I'd shop for a new PSU if you ever suffer random reboots. In closing ask the supplier that the motherboard be supplied with the current BIOS version F7 so you don't have to learn why. Bob

To the PSU, well the whole case is $60 including psu with 12cm fan, I dont want to spend another $60 on a psu if its not absolutely needed... What can happen if the power supply gets overpowered? Can this damage any of my components? Ok and last question, is there any noticable performance drop by running the RAM on different clock than the CPU, or it does not care? In my original configuration they both run @1066mhz. Thanks again, J.M.

Nevertheless, it is extremely interesting as a very new solution and for a number of objective reasons, such as the use of more advanced production process. Therefore, enthusiasts pin a lot of hopes on Intel P45 expecting the boards on this new chipset to become one of the best overclocker platforms out there. http://www.hardocp.com/article.html?art=MTUxNSw0LCxoZW50aHVzaWFzdA== almost no performance difference between p45 and p35. http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,2845,2325039,00.asp tagline: We look at four P45 motherboards built using Intel's latest mainstream chipset. Some are still a work in progress. as for the power supply, don't expect a $60 case+power supply combo to last powering an 8800gt. that's a nice midrange board attached to cheapo power supply. a bad power supply can cause strange, hard to pinpoint errors (random shutdowns, freezes, lines on the screen, etc.) and sometimes damage motherboards. that's why i recommend you save $20 on your motherboard and another $25 on your memory -- the saving pay for a good power supply. 1:1 memory ratios do perform the best, but the difference between ddr2-800 and ddr2-1066 is only noticeable in benchmarks. 2 fps difference in games that already running at 115+fps (&lt;2%): http://www.anandtech.com/memory/showdoc.aspx?i=2867&p=3

15	7	304124	2830902	2830305	Phil Crase	8/10/08 7:57 AM	1.21835502E12	Build	Looks good, I too would recommend a heavier supply, preferably 500w or more, Antec is good. I would also probably stuff in another GB of DDR just in the event you might for some reason decide to go to Vista.
15	8	304124	2830979	2830793	ramarc	8/10/08 10:29 AM	1.21836414E12	fortron's a good brand but 450w is the recommended size	for an 8800gt. the p43 is just as new as the p45 (it's the 'value'/low end model). but if it's the same price as a p35 go for it. remember that you *may* need to get one or two bios updates if run into problems. btw, here's the link with benchmarks between ddr2-800 cl4 and ddr3-1066 cl5. http://www.anandtech.com/memory/showdoc.aspx?i=2867&p=3 it was chopped off of the other post.
