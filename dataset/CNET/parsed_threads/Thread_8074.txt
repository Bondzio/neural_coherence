<s> Those cores are some pretty old stuff.. i had a 4200+x2 more then 5 years ago. </s>
<s> When it comes to gaming, it varys based on the game.. Should the game support multi-core processors, the 4400 would definately be the better, but for older solo core games, you would probably see a minor speed buff in the 4000. </s>
<s> To be honest though, compared to todays CPUs, neither of those would be considered gaming level anymore. </s>
<s> If you are planning to run newer games on either of those CPUs, you are going to see equally poor performance. </s>
<s> say I had about $50 to buy a new cpu? </s>
<s> should I get one of the black box editions? </s>
<s> AMD's Black Edition CPU's have the multipler unlocked. </s>
<s> If you're planning on the possibility of overclocking, then that's the CPU that you'd want to get. </s>
