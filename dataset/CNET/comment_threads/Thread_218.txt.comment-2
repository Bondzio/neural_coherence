Forgot to add this last time: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01301711&lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&product=3644726 I've got the 32-bit OS.
Anyway, my top mobo slot is open, I think that had the dial-up jack on it.
I removed it when I put in my video card.
That's a PCI or PCI Express x1?
The one below it is the TV Tuner card.
