I have been using the Corsair H50 water cooler for some months with the fan that came with it and no problems at all. I decided to buy a new fan for the radiater just to see if I could get cpu temps. down even more. I bought an Akasa Apache Black PWM fan, took out the Corsair fan and installed the Apache. Now when I BOOT I get an error beep. In BIOS it reports that the CPU fan which the fan has to be connected to isn't spinning. I turned off CPU fan fail warning. In Windows I used Core Temp to check cpu temp. and it was stable at 35-36c meaning the fan was working. Question is why does the Apache fan cause an error and the Corsair does'nt? Both are 4 pin PWM fans and all I did was take one out and replace with the other.

The pump that fits over the cpu has to have 100% power all the time so is connected to a 3 pin power connecter that's why the pump connecter is 3 pin. The fan connects to the PWM/cpu fan connecter as this is the variable speed for cooling the raidater that's why the fan comes with a 4 pin PWM connecter.
