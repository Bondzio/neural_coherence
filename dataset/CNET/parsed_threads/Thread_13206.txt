<s> Hi all, I am planning on building a new computer from scratch in about 2 months time from now ( July 2010 ) and I was hoping for some input on the specs that I have, so far, come up with. </s>
<s> I have done a reasonable amount of research, though I am somewhat of a noob The computer is to be used primarily for gaming , but also for graphic design & video production . </s>
<s> I'm not really interested in overclocking anything. </s>
<s> I am in Australia and I'm planning to order all parts from Australia. </s>
<s> My preferred website to order from is PCCaseGear . </s>
<s> Sadly, parts are not cheap over here, and shipping from overseas is expensive. </s>
<s> I'm not interested in overclocking. </s>
<s> My budget is approx. </s>
<s> $5000 USD ($5500 Aussie dollars) . </s>
<s> Case - CoolerMaster CM Storm Sniper Black Edition I'm open to any suggestions here. </s>
<s> I just want a case that offers excellent airflow and cooling. </s>
<s> CPU - Intel i7 980X I'm fixed on getting this. </s>
<s> GPU - 2 x EVGA nVidia GeForce GTX 480 ??? </s>
<s> OK, this is something I need advice on. </s>
<s> I absolutely want to run 3 x 24&quot; monitors , and be able to spread both games, and my windows desktop over the three monitors. </s>
<s> So I need 2 GPUs. </s>
<s> I want to be able to run each monitor at 1900x1200 , with current games on max settings (don't care if I'm out of date in 6 months from now). </s>
<s> Is two 480s overkill? </s>
<s> I'm a bit skeptical about brand new GPUs. </s>
<s> Perhaps two slightly older ATIs is a better idea? </s>
<s> I want to avoid over-heating, but I don't want to resort to water cooling. </s>
<s> I'm not interested in 3D . </s>
<s> Memory - G.Skill 8GB (2x4GB) DDR3 Dual channel vs triple channel? </s>
<s> I don't understand the difference, but I want at least 8GB . </s>
<s> If I go triple channel, I will have to go up to 12GB won't I? </s>
<s> As far as I can tell, you can't get 3GB sticks. </s>
<s> If I buy a motherboard that supports triple channel is it bad to only use dual channel on it? </s>
<s> I did some research and the general consensus seems to be that G.Skill or Corsair are the way to go. </s>
<s> Motherboard - ASUS Rampage III Extreme (Intel X58) It's brand new, supports the i7 980X, both ATI Crossfire or nVidia SLI, and up to 24GB RAM. </s>
<s> Seems like a solid choice? </s>
<s> Power Supply - CoolerMaster Silent Pro M1000 1000W - Would this handle two GTX480s along with everything else in the computer? </s>
<s> From what I've read elsewhere 1000W should be sufficient. </s>
<s> Hard Drive - Seagate Barracuda 1.5TB ST31500341AS Seagate or Western Digital? </s>
<s> I've scanned a few forums and most posts seemed to indicate that Seagate are now slightly better? </s>
<s> Monitors - 2 x BenQ 24&quot; E2420HD (+my old Dell 24&quot;) I'm not fussed about getting the latest greatest monitor, I'd rather save money. </s>
<s> As long as it's 24&quot; and it works. </s>
<s> It's not a problem mixing 2 different brands is it? </s>
<s> The Dell will sit in the middle to make the setup symmetrical. </s>
<s> And the rest Logitech Cordless Keyboard Microsoft SideWinder X8 Mouse ASUS Optical Drive (all optical drives are pretty much the same no?) </s>
<s> Windows 7 Premium So what's your opinion guys? </s>
<s> Is anything here overkill, or are there any bad bottlenecks? </s>
<s> Any brands that I've mentioned that should be avoided? </s>
<s> All suggestions are welcome Thanks for taking the time to read this! </s>
<s> Cheers guys, Dave. </s>
<s> hd 5970 handles most any game well in multi-monitor setup with ati eyefinity . </s>
<s> this hardocp article tests two crossfired hd 5870s (hd 5970 is basically two hd 5870s in one package) with 3 monitors. </s>
<s> also, the x58 chipset is optimized for triple channel memory so for best performance you'll need 3 memory dimms (3x2gb or 3x4gb). </s>
<s> this hothardware roundup of 1tb and 2tb drives has the wd caviar black and seagate barracuda xt trading blows for best drive. </s>
<s> if you get a seagate, make sure it's an new xt model since older 7200.xx models had firmware issues that made them generally slower than other wd and hitachi drives. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> What do you think about 2 x 5870s with eyefinity? </s>
<s> Surely this card is new enough such that having two of them will allow me maximum gaming performance with current games? </s>
<s> It will save me a lot of money. </s>
<s> Thanks for the hard drive info too. </s>
<s> that has just been released by EVGA http://www.evga.com/articles/00537/ might be a bit 'overkill' - will run with either dual X58 or dual XEON CPU's (and up to 48GB of RAM). </s>
<s> hd 5970 is two hd 5870 in a single package. </s>
<s> Heat is more distributed, each chip get full x16 on the slots, rather than x8 when on 5970. </s>
<s> Make sense? </s>
<s> I'm willing to spend the extra money. </s>
