isn't a restore CD and that he didn't pay extra for it?
Nowadays they do not normally provide the restore CD but tell you how to create one by burning their special partiton to a CD, or they sell it for about $25.
For normal systems, they [all of the main group of proprietaries, such as Compaq, HP, Dell, etc] haven't actually provided Operating System CD's for years.
Some will sell it with the business systems, but not cheap.
