i knew that dell bought alienware.
my problem is with cnet continuing to give alienware a 4 star rating.
you don't show reviews that people post for stores, only products.
you check any other reseller rating site and you will find dozens of bad reviews for this company yet cnet continues to give them 4 starts.
here on cnet you don't see what an awful time people are having with this company unless you read the reviews for alienware products.
it's turning your own store ratings into a joke.
look at:   yet here they are on cnet with 4 out of 5 stars.
