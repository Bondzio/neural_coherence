I have a Windows XP machine (custom built), first it didn't recognize my DVD-R all of a sudden (thanks to your forums I fixed the problem), now that it recognizes my DVD-R, every time I open My computer, then I double click one of my hard drives (C, D & E) a dialogue box of &quot;Choose the program you want to use to open this file&quot; pops up.
My floppy drive my DVD & DVD-R opens just fine, if I go through other means to get to the folder (My Docs, or other windows) I can access the stuff I need, only when I open My Computer and try to double click the C, D, E drive does this happen.
I went to device manager etc etc and all indications show that the hard drives are recognized and are working properly, please help.
