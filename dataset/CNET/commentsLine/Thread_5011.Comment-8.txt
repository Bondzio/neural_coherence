cpu: amd athlon 64 x2 6400+ windsor 3.2ghz 2x1mb l2 cache am2 socket.
$210 -my bad, failed to specify.
as far as amd vs. intel, maybe i'm counter-culture.
i just like amd more.
hard-drive: hitachi deskstar 7k1000 750gb 7200rpm 32mb cache sata 3.0gb/s $200 -well, i thought the matter over and maybe extra space wouldn't be that bad.
the price seemed alright and i liked the cache.
psu: pc power & cooling turbo-cool 1kw-sr eps12v $430 -thanks for the johnnyguru link.
i went back and picked this one out.
reviews were favorable.
adjusted total: $1754 --- i figure if i need more ram i can always go back and buy more; the motherboard has the slots.
if the games i play can't use it yet, i'll wait until they can.
