1.1.1	I am running WinXP Prof and have SP2 installed .	St
1.1.2	I purchased a Belkin 802.11g wireless card for the desktop but it is not recognized as a device .	St
1.1.3	I tried to search for new hardware and no luck .	St
1.1.4	Can this be a SP2 problem ?	Ques
1.1.5	I know the slots are working because it will recognize other cards .	St
1.1.6	( NIC and Sound card ) .	St
1.1.7	I also know the wireless card works because I installed in another machine and it detected .	St
1.1.8	The only thing was the 2nd machine was a Dell without SP2 installed .	St
1.1.9	Any help would be appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	& quot ; I tried to search for new hardware and no luck .	St
1.2.2	Can this be a SP2 problem ? & quot ; I 'm used to installed drivers for such things .	St
1.2.3	Your post did n't tell , but let me share that Dell preloads some drivers so you do n't have to .	St
1.2.4	A stock install of XP will not have the drivers .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks Bob .	St
1.3.2	The machine I 'm having problems with is not a Dell but just a generic machine .	St
1.3.3	I have the disk with the drivers and they are installed on the generic machine .	St
1.3.4	It seems like the PC does n't even see the card .	St
1.4.1	& quot ; Generic machines & quot ; may use a motherboard with a chipset that Microsoft may run on but you need to have latest BIOS and a MOTHERBOARD DRIVER PACKAGE before cards or USB things work properly .	St
1.4.2	Your post did n't share the information so I ca n't tell if this is the issue .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	The motherboad has VB-601 on it and on the corner there is a label which has MI413s .	St
1.5.2	The BIOS is Award Modular BIOS 4.51PG .	St
1.5.3	It says verison : MI413 Award Plug and Play BIOS Extension v1.0A	St
1.6.1	If this is a BX based board ( only you will know ) then this google ... http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & ie=UTF-8 & q=VB-601+ & btnG=Google+Search seems to agree , the issue can be.. 1 .	St
1.6.2	You need the latest BIOS .	St
1.6.3	2 .	St
1.6.4	You need to & quot ; Reset Configuration Data & quot ; in the BIOS .	St
1.6.5	3 .	St
1.6.6	You try another PCI slot since ... the one next the AGP can be ... problematic .	Sug
1.6.7	4 .	St
1.6.8	The card is just incompatible with this board .	St
1.6.9	5 .	St
1.6.10	Someone disabled the IRQ PNP features in the OS .	St
1.6.11	I offer this since I lost a day over that .	St
1.6.12	The owner was thinking DOS days where IRQs could n't be shared .	St
1.6.13	Bob	St
1.7.1	This info does n't give us a clue about the age of the system .	St
1.7.2	What processor is in it , how old is it ?	Ques
1.8.1	The PC is probably from 1999 or so .	St
1.8.2	I got it from a friend and put a Pentium III 500Mhz processor and it has 768 of RAM .	St
1.8.3	I tried all the PCI slots and also verified the PnP option in the CMOS is enabled .	St
1.8.4	I flashed the BIOS using the MI413 one from this site : http : //www.fic.com.tw/support/motherboard/bios.aspx ? model_id=16 .	Ques
1.8.5	I also uninstalled SP2 and reinstalled XP without any luck .	St
1.9.1	http : //www.netstumbler.org/archive/index.php/t-10573 It would be amazing to expect owners to exchange cards , do such gyrations on drivers and more .	St
1.9.2	You should try another card .	Sug
1.9.3	Bob	St
1.10.1	I have a dell D610 running win xp2 .	St
1.10.2	The wireless card is a dell 1470 .	St

1.11.1	Digging up a 5 year old post does n't give you the right exposure .	St
