<s> hey guys, Is a dual core processor better for gaming than a single core or should u try and stay with a single core? </s>
<s> Thanks for the help </s>
<s> Some gamers claim they disable it back to single core for best performance. </s>
<s> I've never found that to be true. </s>
<s> Wait and you'll find a disagreeing post on this one. </s>
<s> Since I also edit a little video, the dual core is all I'll want. </s>

<s> The dual core Intel &quot;Core 2 Duo&quot; CPU family is the current top dog for gaming. </s>
<s> If you look at the gaming performance scores, you will see that it essentially beats all other CPU families, either single or dual core. </s>
