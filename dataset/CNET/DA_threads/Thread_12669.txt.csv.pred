1.1.1	I am planning on building my first computer fairly soon .	St
1.1.2	Before I order all of my parts in the next two months , I have to know exactly what I am buying in terms of cooling .	St
1.1.3	The case comes with two 80mm fans .	St
1.1.4	I understand that the fan in the power supply goes in the back ( obviously ) , but besides the other air hole in the back where one of the 80mm fans will fit , where will any additional fans go ?	Ques
1.1.5	Where do I install them ?	Ques
1.1.6	Do I just sit them inside the case ?	Ques
1.1.7	And finally , what is a heatsink and how and where do I install it ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thank you for your help .	St
1.2.1	http : //www.buildeasypc.com/	St
1.3.1	made of iron , copper or aluminum [ all good heat conducting materials ] .	St
1.3.2	They have many & quot ; fins & quot ; , the sole purpose of the fins is to increase the surface area for heat to be transferred through .	St
1.3.3	The heat transfer can be by natural convention [ simply heat rises ] , or forced convectionn [ a fan of some type moves air past the fins to transfer heat much faster ] .	St
1.3.4	The heat sink is flat on one surface for making intimate contact with the flat surface of the device that it is removing heat from .	St
1.3.5	There are more exotic versions that use copper heat pipes in conjunction with fins etc .	St
1.3.6	Some Video cards and chipsets have simple heat sinks .	St
1.3.7	Some include the fan .	St
1.3.8	The most well know is the HSF [ heat sink/fan ] that attaches to the cPU to get the humungeous heat that the CPU generates away from the CPU core .	St
1.3.9	Virtually all cases have mounting places for fans .	St
1.3.10	There are usually a place in the front to mount a fan to pull air in .	St
1.3.11	The mounting places are not real obviou from outside .	St
1.3.12	If you buy a retail boxed [ 3 year warranty ] CPU , it will come with a HSF that will adequately cool the CPU .	St
1.3.13	[ but overclokers et al put beetter HSF 's on them ] I now will only use a case with a top exhaust fan .	St
1.3.14	They are extremely effective , again because heat rises and the top area of the case gets hot .	St
1.3.15	The ones with a top exhaust may also have additional fans that come with them , but if not they will have places to mount fans front and rear .	St
1.3.16	The side fan that blows air into the case in the vicinity of the CPU ? HSF is also very helpful .	St
1.3.17	There is one new development that is catching on very slowly , that is the BTX case/system .	St
1.3.18	In them the fan arrangements are somewhat difference .	St
1.4.1	This link will provide alot of the details for you : http : //www.arcticsilver.com/arctic_alumina_instructions.htm Next , if you buy a factory cpu with supplied fan , it should contain a help guide or similar to install it .	St
1.4.2	The above link is one of the perferred comppounds to apply , but the orginal OEM one is OK too .	St
1.4.3	It all comes together when things are in hand , just use common sense and deft care .	St
1.4.4	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
