i've taken a look at that site you recommended.
it is great!
i'm actually thinking about scrapping the parts i've found (good thing i haven't ordered them yet) and ordering the parts for the amd beginner computer.
i've also found all the parts on newegg canada, and i'm blown away with the price including the monitor!
thanks so much for the recommendation!
and whats your take on their use of the ddr3 1600?
should i go with something more like ddr3 1333 or even 1066 (or what ever the #s are)?
