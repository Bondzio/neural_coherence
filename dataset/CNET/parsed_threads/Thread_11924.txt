<s> I would like to update my desktop with a new video card. </s>
<s> I have a Dell Dimension 4400 with 640mb's of DDR ram. </s>
<s> I am running Windows XP home. </s>
<s> The current card is an ATI Rage 128 with 16mb. </s>
<s> I don't play games but the video seems slow. </s>
<s> I understand that I have a 250 watt power supply so I would be limited to ram size in the replacement. </s>
<s> Now the question! </s>
<s> Could I run a card with 128 mb and TV out? </s>
<s> What would be a compatible card for my system that could be had for under say $75? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> check the video upgrade advice For Dell 4400 here: http://www.tek-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=1366809&page=1 </s>
<s> Thanks anmor for the link to this excellent site. </s>
<s> I found an ATI 8500 Pro graphics card on e-bay for a good price. </s>
<s> It has 64mb with tv out. </s>
<s> I know it's a couple of years old but I found a professional review that said it was very good card. </s>
<s> I know you can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear but if I can improve my video, I can think about buying a new desk top in a couple of years. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Are you freaking kidding me? </s>
<s> The 8500 Pro is like 6 years old. </s>
<s> Whoever told you it is still a good card must be smoking crack, or you read an article 6 years ago saying it was good. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> If you're not going to game, and not going to do any graphics work, you don't need a dedicated graphics card. </s>
<s> Chances are, the lag is because of out-of-date drivers. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> If you want a card that badly, pick up an X1650 XT for about $50. </s>
<s> Ps. </s>
<s> Nowadays, Video ram isn't everything. </s>
<s> It used to be everything back in the old days of Descent and DoS. </s>
<s> Gee Mingo, I didn't mean to hit a nerve here! </s>
<s> I know the card is old but I have Dim 4400 that is almost that old and that card was supposed to be good in it's day. </s>
<s> I don't do games and I can't swing a new computer right now but my current video card is a Rage 128 with a whole 16mb of memory. </s>
<s> All I want is a card that will update my video without causing a power supply crash. </s>
<s> There isn't much to choose from with AGP 2X. </s>
<s> Is the X1650XT an ATI card? </s>
<s> I also head a GEFORCE FX5500 will also work in my 4400. </s>
<s> Any help is appreciated. </s>
<s> Sorry I didn't mean to sound rash like that. </s>
<s> Like most other people who would tell you, I suggest you just wait until you can upgrade your whole PC. </s>
<s> AGP is old, and AGP 2X is even older. </s>
<s> Even PCIe 1.0 is starting to get old (but not yet). </s>
<s> Since you're not gaming or anything, any ol' cheapo card would do the trick. </s>
<s> Most cards from ancient Geforce 6 and down don't use an additional power current from the psu. </s>
<s> Yes X1650XT is an ATi card. </s>
<s> Ps. </s>
<s> Buying a new PC can be much cheaper than what you think. </s>
<s> This is a theoretical build I put together (minus the graphics card) for fun: http://secure.newegg.com/NewVersion/wishlist/PublicWishDetail.asp?WishListNumber=6913348 </s>
<s> Thanks to you all for your input. </s>
<s> I'll do some thinking and maybe a quick letter to Santa is called for! </s>
