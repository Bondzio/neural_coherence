stop acting like that.
i've swapped harddisks before, and it will work.
sound cards don't work without a driver, but you don't need sound to get into the system.
graphic cards will always work without a driver, even though very inefficiently, usually at only 256 or even 16 colors.
when windows doesn't detect the existing hardware, it'll simply try to detect and install the new hardware.
it'll work, it has always worked.
trust me.
when you try, you'll see.
