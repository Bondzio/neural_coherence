<s> Hi all, we have several walkabout hammerhead hh3 tablet pc's. </s>
<s> They are at the age now that they won't hold the cmos settings. </s>
<s> The company says that they are the only ones who can replace the battery/cmos chip, and of course rather expensive. </s>
<s> I have completely dismantled one and I can't find anything resembling a battery. </s>
<s> I thought they might be using a cap but the one I see that is in the package I would expect is being used to filter the backlight. </s>
<s> I have looked under battery, behind pcmcia slot, all around the screen and I am stumped. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Since there is no manual available try this link. </s>

<s> Don't be cheap. </s>
<s> Pay them for the answer. </s>

<s> I appreciate your help and comments, keep them coming. </s>
<s> Hello. </s>
<s> Have you looked for a small black square box on the mainboard? </s>
<s> It is an integrated real time clock / battery used on some motherboards. </s>
<s> An example is one that has the brand Dallas Semiconductors and has a drawing of a clock on it. </s>
<s> I am surprised the Cmos battery is depleted on a recent tablet like the hh3. </s>
<s> Thank You, I have looked for that as well and unless the package has change since the last one I replaced. </s>
<s> Thanks and keep em coming guys and gals this is a stumper for me. </s>
<s> The CMOS battery is located on the motherboard. </s>
<s> This is the last board that can be removed from the unit. </s>
<s> It is the one with the RAM chips on it. </s>
<s> The battery is on the bottom of the board. </s>
<s> The battery is a Panasonic BR2330. </s>
<s> Digi-Key part number P025-ND. </s>
