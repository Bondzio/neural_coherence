thanks for the replies all the CPU is being re-installed with Heatsink Compound....I will check for the indicator lights mentioned for a Dell MB....checked cables but will do it again Hadn't thought of the &quot;beeps&quot; on boot-up but will pay some attention to that as well this machine is only 1-1/2 years old so hopefully it isn't classed as an &quot;older&quot; machine just yet I'll post the results tomorrow
