<s> I'm in the process of upgrading my current system. </s>
<s> I just purchased a Gigabyte mobo, GA-7N400 Pro2. </s>
<s> My old system used a RAID controller card with my OS boot drive connected to it. </s>
<s> The new mobo already has the RAID installed so I don't need the controller card. </s>
<s> I have the OS boot drive connected to the IDE1 of the new mobo, but it will not boot up. </s>
<s> Actually, it will make it to the Windows boot screen but then turns to the BSOD. </s>
<s> The BIOS sees the drive, but I cannot get to it at the DOS prompt. </s>
<s> Any ideas on what my problem is, and how to resolve it? </s>
<s> Windows XP Pro by the way. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> itself connected to another computer(motherboard change). </s>
<s> As such it won't work. </s>
<s> You could try a repair install with your XP cd then a call to MS for activation. </s>
<s> The drive may be formatted as NTFS. </s>
<s> DOS can't read NTFS. </s>
