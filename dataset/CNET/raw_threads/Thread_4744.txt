Im building a new computer now I dont know how to configure it to work properly. The motherboard (a ASUS P5GDC Delux) has only one IDE bus, and two RAID buses (one primary and one secondary). I have a Maxtor 300 GB Hard Drive (ATA) and a Memorex DVD Burner. When I connect both the Hard Drive and the DVD Burner to the IDE, one as Master the other as slave, the the HD light stays on for &quot;too&quot; long while booting, and it doesnt detect my Hard Drive. How should I connect the drives to work properly. Ive tried different ways, both RAID, both IDE, one RAID the other IDE, etc. OR do I only need to know a trick for configuring the BIOS? Ive tried different things there too.
