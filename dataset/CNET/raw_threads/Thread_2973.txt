8702	0	140742	1579591	NR	bently	12/4/05 10:17 AM	1.13369142E12	exchanging hard drives	Just Installed new 80 gig WD hard drive as C and D, replacing a 40 gig WD HDD. Win XP home is on C. Have a second HD, a 10 gig HD labeled F and G. I want to remove the 10 gig F&G hard drive, and put in place the OLD WD 40 gig C&D drive, which has windows XP home and lots of program & data folders. 1. Will the drives show up as F&G, same as one replaced? 2. Will there be any problems doing this... will windows somehow try to access the old copy of XP on the other drive? ''I will insure jumper in correct position''. Do not want dual boot. 3. I plan to copy all wanted files from the ''old'' C drive to the new D drive, than REFORMAT the old C drive, removing WIN XP from second drive. ANY PROBLEMS DOING THAT? 3. Is there anything I should look out for? Thanks Ben

Hard disks, content don't move, keep drive letters on their own so you'll have copy/clone drives as you see fit, format/partition as needed. No &quot;easy button&quot; that I've seen. Bob
