motherboard msi k7n420.
i have 3 additional usb slots on my mb.
i have 2 usb ports on front of my case and d-bracket with 2 usb and 4 led.
i had the d-bracket connected, but the usb ports would not function and the 4 led remained green, always, which is supposed to indicate that the operating system is booting.
whats wrong with the d-bracket?
how, if possible, can i use all the available usb ports?
