<s> I'm looking to upgrade my AGP one last time and wondering which AGP card'll run all of the present day games with most of the eye candy turned up. </s>
<s> The users guide to my mobo also says I can only use .8 or 1.5 volt cards and not 3.3. </s>
<s> Is that something to look at or are 3.3V cards rare </s>
<s> I asked this too. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> The 7800GS looks like better deal. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> you're in luck the early AGP (ver#1-#2) used 3.3v and you have a motherboard that supports AGP4/8. </s>
<s> which is the common one. </s>
<s> i'm stuck in the same boat that you are. </s>
<s> i have two systems running 3.2 prescotts and i'm not ready to scrap them out just yet. </s>
<s> the 7800 looks like the end of the line for agp unless someone steps forward. </s>
<s> the x850xt-pe cards are close but still bringing too much money and they are getting hard to find. </s>
