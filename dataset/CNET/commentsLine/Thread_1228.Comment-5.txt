those frequencies you mention are relatively low.
because of this the data transmission will be low.
higher frequency means higher data speed.
data can be and is sent within those lower frequencies.
but it's usually slower than dialup.
if you'll dig a little, notice the specific frequencies involved with the b, g, and n ranges and notice the associated data rates.
