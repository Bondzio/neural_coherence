I point my web browser at my router.
It has a system menu then I click on the update router button.
From there a file browser button is clicked and the usual Windows file open dialogue shows up.
Find the bin file, click OK and then back to the web browser.
One more click on an OK and the router updates.
I hear you as far as the computer industry goes.
Wish they would do a lot better job.
