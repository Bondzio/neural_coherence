sb909 - I think I am right with you - I am also leaning heavily towards the eMachine T6212.
I think either that one or some of the custom built HP's (the 1030s) - they look really good.
The nice thing about HP is you can have them upgrade/customize right then and there and get exactly what you want (either upgrades for memory, video or sound cards) or if for some reason you need to take options away (lower HD etc.)
BUT by the end of the day, I think eMachine comes in slightly lower, especially if you DO need the monitor and printer.
