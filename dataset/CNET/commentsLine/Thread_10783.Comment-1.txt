hey guys, i just bought a new 250gb hard drive for my computer and i installed it as my slave drive, i already have a 40gb hard drive installed as my master.
i installed my new game (resident evil 4) onto the new hard drive (f drive) everything worked fine.
i played the game for a couple minutes but then i decided to update it because apparently the game is 100x's better if you update.
my issue is... when i go to update the game, i save the download onto my old drive (c drive) and when i click run, the program does not read that my game is located on my f drive and it says that the game is not installed, it's only reading whats on my c drive.
how do i make it work?
please thanks, travis ps: i'm running windows xp if that helps?
