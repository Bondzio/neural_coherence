ouch.
my answer is, yes!
what i like to do is create (with an old dos boot diskette) a 2gb fat 16 (xp will not do that).
then install a bare minimum xp.
bare minimum!
activate it.
no service packs, no nothing else.
i don't even do video drivers.
then: format all of the drive (less the 2gb partation) ntfs.
install xp &lt;again&gt; on that partation.
add all drivers, updates, then programs.
rational: fat 16/32 is dumb, and has no security.
not good.
fat 16 can be read by anything on the planet (almost) that calls itself an o/s.
(good).
so lets say you corrupt your ntfs.sys file on your &quot;real&quot; xp.
prior to windows 2000 you we're pretty seriously hosed.
today you can run recovery console.
that takes time.
so, if my ntfs.sys goes south and i cannot read my &quot;real&quot; xp, i go back to the xp forced onto fat16 and boot that.
that ntfs.sys is fine, since the fat table is never touched... i can then copy/paste a clean ntfs.sys file over the corrupted one, faster than you can finish loading the recovery console.
the other side of the coin of fat xx is while it has no security at all, it has almost zero overhead.
so on my systems, it lies there like rip van winkle.
i wake it up if i need it.
this has been my game plan since nt 3. i don't know what i will do when longhorn is a real product.
ask me then.
