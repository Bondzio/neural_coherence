<s> I am happy with my six years young PC. </s>
<s> Afterall, who doesn't like a PC which play music nicely, and surfs internet okay, and doesn't need Vista? </s>
<s> So, why the forum? </s>
<s> My PC doesn't seem to have USB 2.0 and my handycam won't like it. </s>
<s> I know I could just buy a FireWire cable, or just a PCI to USB thingie. </s>
<s> But I just wanted to know if there was a way to get USB 2.0 on my current system itself? </s>
<s> I looked here http://support.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/d850gb/ and here and they say I could http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/CS-009024.htm But I don't see any option like that in BIOS. </s>
<s> I am contemplating upgrading the BIOS, but will that really help? </s>
<s> What do you think? </s>
<s> Or will I just end up wasting my holiday redoing my OS? </s>
<s> Your advice and help is appreciated. </s>
<s> If the links you provided offer no mention of USB2.0 then you have NONE under your *specific mtrbd. </s>
<s> model#*. </s>
<s> You already know the cure, get a new pci card that can provide it. </s>
<s> There is no way to add/or somehow fix your current USB chipset to v2.0. </s>
<s> The USB level is strictly a h/w item, s/w only acknowledges or provides access to it to include the bios area. </s>
<s> The link for &quot;enabling USB2.0&quot; was if the mtrbd. </s>
<s> does have it, then you need a supporting OS to actually use it, and some patches to further support it. </s>
<s> This doesn't actually fix a mtrbd. </s>
<s> that &quot;physically&quot; lacks USB2.0 but does have USB but only at a USB1.1 level. </s>
<s> Any bios update is serious business, so be sure before proceeding and be ready as instructed for a successful update. </s>
<s> From link: To Enable USB 2.0: Step 5 5. </s>
<s> Enable &quot;High-speed USB&quot;. </s>
<s> -If no USB2.0 is found, then that option isn't present, it will read &quot;enable USB&quot; or similar, thus low-speed at USB1.1 tada -----Willy </s>
<s> https://www.lemcomputers.com/intel/brochure/mboard/d850g.pdf If just says USB. </s>
<s> If USB-2, it would say so. </s>
<s> Also uses RAMBUS memory. </s>
<s> Hmm. </s>
<s> Big bucks getting that stuff. </s>
<s> Anyway, USB-2 standards were finalized in 2001. </s>
<s> If your board is of that vintage or older, it's not going to work. </s>
<s> A BIOS upgrade doesn't add this feature either. </s>
<s> You'll need an add in card. </s>
<s> BTW, which OS? </s>
<s> Hopefully XP w/SP2. </s>
<s> Thanks Willy, kinda I knew what you said, but you know they say -- don't give up! </s>
<s> Thanks Steven. </s>
<s> Correct link. </s>
<s> I have the same board. </s>
<s> D/l technical manual from intel site as well. </s>
<s> No luck. </s>
<s> Currently using XP. </s>
<s> Have tried with 95/98/2000 Adv Server SP4 as well. </s>
<s> No luck. </s>
<s> So if the mb doesn't have it, OS won't add it. </s>
<s> Gotta get a PCI-USB card/FireWire cable. </s>
<s> Oh btw, are RDRAMs still in production :-? </s>

<s> Funny, 2 GB of PC 800 RDRAM costs as mush as a Brand new desktop </s>
