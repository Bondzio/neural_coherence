<s> A while ago my 350W PSU failed so I replaced it with an Antec truepower trio 550W. </s>
<s> I connected it to my Asus M3A motherboard and when I turned it on, sparks came out of that motherboard. </s>
<s> The motherboard is wasted, and I was told that something with CPU voltages went wrong, I don't really understand, but anyhow, I need to get a new motherboard. </s>
<s> I want it to either be compatible with the 550W PSU and my Athlon 64 X2 dual core 6400+ (because somehow, that's where it went wrong). </s>
<s> OR If you say it's silly to buy a new motherboard and not a new CPU, which ones should I buy, that are compatible with eachother, my PSU, my memory (I really don't have a clue what type or RAM it is, I could check if you want). </s>
<s> I really need some help with this, I want to avoid another &quot;fireworks party&quot;, and need my PC up and running again soon. </s>
<s> replaced several psu with different wattage before and the most important is the main board power pins. </s>
<s> Second will be the drives. </s>
<s> Sparks that you gotten would probably be and unwanted plugging in of a line to the plug which is actually not meant for power (but rather a peripheral). </s>
<s> Any new board will have a manual to guide you on which plug really needs to be plugged, especially, ensuring the main 16/20 pin is completely plugged. </s>
<s> Everything was connected correctly, I found some article where the same motherboard was burned in the same spot as with mine: www.bit-tech.net/blog/2009/02/20/rip-asus-m3a-h-hdmi-bursts-into-flames/?tcs=nl Anyhow, that's no use now, even though it's unclear why it's broken, it is, and I'd like to replace it. </s>
<s> I can't buy the same motherboard as I had, because that would probably give the same weird problem, and fireworks. </s>
