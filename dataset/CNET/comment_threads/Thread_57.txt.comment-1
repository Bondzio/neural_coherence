I have physical access to a network printer working fine on a network but when I add my notebook to a cat5 connection and try to find the printer it cant.
When I check other workstations control panel printer is &quot;IBM 1145 on MYSERVER01&quot; and I even have a printer name (&quot;LXK485DC8&quot;) and an IP address but nothing helps find it in the printer find window after selecting the server name to find.
Other info states I need to specify (e.g.
&quot;server.host1.printer/LXK485DC8&quot;) but that doesnt work either.
I also try searching under the share name &quot;IBM1145&quot; and that doesnt work.
Again, I have printed the printers network configuration info.
and have access to printer setup GUI from the notebook but dont know how else to setup.
