<s> Me and my wife have identical machines. </s>
<s> They are custom built and both run XP SP2. </s>
<s> On my machine I have a diabetes monitor on com 1 and a blood pressure monitor on com 2. </s>
<s> Both pieces of equipment work fine on my machine. </s>
<s> My wife just got the same equipment as me and I connected them to the com ports on her machine. </s>
<s> None of the equipment is found when we try to use them. </s>
<s> I checked to make sure that the ports are enabled and they are. </s>
<s> The settings on hers are the same as mine. </s>
<s> I connected her equipment to my computer and they work fine. </s>
<s> I can't seem to figure out what is wrong. </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> The cause is not there. </s>
<s> But it's new so you can make it a warranty issue. </s>

<s> In device manager they both show up and when you hit properties they indicate they are functioning correctly? </s>
<s> If yes then are you both running the same software that talks to them? </s>
<s> (meaning by identical you have the exact same hardware and software configuration). </s>
<s> If they don't show up in device manager than they could have been disabled in the BIOS setup. </s>
<s> As Bob says if the system is new and custom - take it back with a description of your problem. </s>
<s> Both systems are a few years old. </s>
<s> What gets me is the fact that the equipment I mentioned works on one machine but not the other. </s>
<s> Both computers are the same and run the same software. </s>
<s> Did they ever function? </s>

<s> Apologies in advance but you are disregarding our forum note. </s>
<s> It's not unlike wanting a diagnosis for your car but not telling make, model, year or other details. </s>
<s> &quot;Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. </s>
<s> Also please exercise your best judgment when posting in the forums--revealing personal information such as your e-mail address, telephone number, and address is not recommended.&quot; </s>
<s> Both devices work on my machine but not my wifes. </s>
<s> I disabled the ports and enabled them again. </s>
<s> I reinstalled the software also.I'm about ready to give up. </s>
<s> I can't find make or model. </s>
