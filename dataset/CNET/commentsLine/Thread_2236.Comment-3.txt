the gateway gt5032 is a great computer for processor-intensive operations, if you aren't afraid to do a couple of upgrades.
1.)
you need a 'real' graphics card.
the cpu ships with an onboard nvidia geforce 6100 video processor on the motherboard.
good for everyday stuff, but not so good for serious computing.
i upgraded to a geforce 7800 gt oc pci express card.
2.)
it ships with 1 gig of pc-3200 ddr memory (do not believe the tech assistance info here.
it falsely says the system uses pc-4200 ddr2, it does not.)
install at least one more gig (there are 4 memory slots each supporting up to 1 gig) of high quality ddr (i used dual channel matched corsair memory).
the unit ships with 1 gig cas 3 memory, you can do much better.
after these upgrades i can easily play 2 instances of dark age of camelot on the computer without missing a beat.
photo editing is a breeze, even if my antivirus is scanning in the background.
one caveat here, while the media center computer has 7 usb2 ports and 2 firewire ports, it only has one pci express slot and 2 pci slots, one of which is occupied with a useless 56k modem, and the other with the tv tuner.
consequently expandability is very limited.
the gt5032 does not have a 3.5&quot; floppy drive.
on the plus side, thanks to its btx motherboard/layout this is one very quiet computer!
it also has convenient memory card slots in the front.
this is a good little computer, that with some cash and a bit of tweaking can be a great one.
