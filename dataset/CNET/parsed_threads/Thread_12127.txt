<s> This usually doesnt happen with computers but i am stumped. </s>
<s> Last night my PC died on me, no lock up or warning, just turned off. </s>
<s> When I went to turn it back on, and in every attempt there after, I get power for all of 1 second. </s>
<s> The fans fire up, disk drives light, and thats it. </s>
<s> I replaced the power supply not too long ago but it has been working fine for about 3 months. </s>
<s> The mother board is getting power, when switched &quot;off.&quot; So im guessing it is not that. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> XP P4 200mHz 512 self built power supply is 550W did not smell any burn up. </s>
<s> also...I do not get an indicator beeps, and if i try the process immediately...nothing happens. </s>
<s> When faced with a dead as a doornail system I strip it down to 4 parts. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Motherboard. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> CPU plus HSF (HeatSink/Fan). </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Power Supply. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Speaker. </s>
<s> No case, no RAM, no extra cables. </s>
<s> Just those four pieces on a square of non-conductive cardboard. </s>
<s> I use a jumper to power it up and hope to beeps. </s>
<s> Power down. </s>
<s> If I get beeps I can add a minimum amount of RAM and try again... More beeps is good. </s>
<s> Power down. </s>
<s> A video card and hopefully more beeps and a display output. </s>
<s> I then move that back to the case and check that no metal standoffs are where they shouldn't be. </s>
<s> If you can't get beeps with the 4 items above, then you have narrowed it down to those 4 items are either dead or grossly misconfigured. </s>
<s> Happy hunting, Bob </s>
<s> Ok, now if anyone is an optimist out ther i could use some smiles. </s>
<s> No beeps, only the same on/off one second burst. </s>
<s> With no smell of burning, but with the recent replacement of a burnt up power supply, which should i suspect. </s>
<s> the motherboard is an asus p4b533, and the cpu is pentium 4 2.0, not overclocked </s>
<s> If not. </s>
<s> Do it. </s>
