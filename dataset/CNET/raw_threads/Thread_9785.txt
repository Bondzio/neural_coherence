O.k. so, my specs are as follows: Amd64 3000+ (Venice no oc) 2 GB geil dual channel pc3200 Asrock 939-dual (pci and agp) 256mb ati aiw x800 agp 2 x 160 GB Seagate drives Lite-on dual layer dvd-rw Lite-on DVD-ROM Blah, blah, blah So what I am wondering is, say Im limited to about a 500.00 upgrade which way should I go? I mean I love my all-in-wonder but should I go with a newer gaming card and run both (agp and pci) or do I really need more ram (4gb seems excessive). Or the motherboard does support the dual core CPUs. Any input is appreciated. Thanks

I'm gonna skip the CPU and talk abt in the end. The 2GB is good, very good actually. Storage/Removable storage looks good. For clarifcation, this is your motherboard, correct: http://www.asrock.com/product/939Dual-SATA2.htm Motherboard looks good, I like the hybridish combination of AGP and PCI-e. (btw, is that a typo in the mobo description?) The only thing that isn't very very best in it's field is just the CPU and GPU. If you are getting solid numbers in games, I would upgrade the CPU. If it is sluggish in non-gpu intensive apps, like uh... word? (lol) jk, but you know that I mean, right? Also, whats the wattage, make, and maybe rails of the PSU? Name and series would work, too. A reasonable upgrade for the mobo would be either semi-entry line X2, maybe the 4200+ or if you look hard enough, you could squeeze in a 4400+. (Mobo does support X2) I think they have the same clock, not sure though. Think it is more advanced in other things. Anyways, if you get a GPU I'd go for a 7800GT, easily in your budget. Or do want to buy both a GPU and a CPU? Otherwise, the machine looks good. Good luck, and remember in the end: Its your call. ~Ibrahim~

I had not thought of the psu, it's some off brand 480w that came with my transformers case (yes, I am that geek with the autobot case). unfortunatly i am pretty sure i'm limited to either a cpu or the gpu (i think i'll upgrade the psu no matter what). so i know it's up to me in the end but if it was your system and your money which would you choose?
