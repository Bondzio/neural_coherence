Hi I just bought a HP Pavilion dv9000t series custom few days back to replace my iMac.
I chose this computer for HP reputation and it came with HDMI out.
I wanted to know if HDMI is the same thing as a DVI with sound can I use this as a output to connect the laptop to my 22&quot; gateway display with DVI as a extended desktop?
I talked with someone at radioshack about this and they sold me a cable with HDMI out and DVI in attached.
Today I talked with someone who thought the HDMI was only used for TVs and not display.
Is this true?
If it is do anyone know what the cable I bought is used for?
Did I waste fifty bucks too?
Thank you for your help.
