but it all comes down to amps per rail and we have to get very technical.
and to head off any question, you get to find the numbers.
that said i am running an old agp his (another maker) ati 3650 512mb on a 230 watt psu.
the entire box averages 140 watts on a watt meter so i'm just there.
i don't suggest anyone exceed the 50% mark.
