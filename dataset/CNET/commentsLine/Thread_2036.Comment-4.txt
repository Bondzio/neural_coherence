i've been working at a major computer retailer here in the states for the past two years, and it made me realize, for that price range, it can be really hard to beat a compaq, emachine, etc.
i am talking regular, no rebate, full retail prices.
so my advice is just make sure you price match some pre-built systems against what you are going to build, you may be suprised.
