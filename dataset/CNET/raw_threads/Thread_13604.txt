The retractable Pentax lenses not leaves the hole. Can be the end-of-life of batt? I do recharge but problem persist. I bought the camera two years 1/2 ago

The lens was stuck and I lucked one by giving it a quick thud against my palm to dislodge the stuck lens. I also had to use a fresh set of alkalines since the rechargeables didn't have the full kick of a new set of batteries. Since it's busted I can't see how you could break it. Bob
