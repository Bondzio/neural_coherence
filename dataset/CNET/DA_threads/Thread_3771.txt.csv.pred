1.1.1	Hello , I own an HP Deskjet D4200 series printer .	St
1.1.2	Recently , my input and output trays were broken in a freak accident , and have to be replaced .	St
1.1.3	I looked at various sites , and could n't find the parts .	St
1.1.4	Are they replaceable , and if so , how much does it cost ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thank you .	St
1.2.1	Parts like that from HP are usually unavailable as you discovered and you may have to get an entire printer ( dead or alive ) to scavenge these .	St
1.2.2	Once in a while you encounter folk that only want the parts they want .	St
1.2.3	If so you , as the shop keeper get it from ebay , sell it to them for the usual markup of what the entire printer cost then ebay what remains .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Since this is a basic HP printer you 're better off just getting a used one from eBay or Craigslist .	St
1.3.2	You can advertise there your quest or simply check on what 's there .	Ques
1.3.3	You take your chances .	St
1.3.4	The other good source is simply googling away for any parts sources , but as this is a simple printer its better getting the whole unit .	St
1.3.5	Goodwill online may have one or your local Sal .	St
1.3.6	Army shop .	St
1.3.7	http : //www.shopgoodwill.com If you 're lucky other thrift shops may have it too .	St
1.3.8	The D4XXX series maybe common enough that other models may also work ( not sure ) .	St
1.3.9	Otherwise , you last attempt at keeping a D4200 is buying new and saving the consumables for your new printer , used as well can do this .	St
1.3.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
