<s> Recently purchased new LCD flat panel and needed digital connection so purchased new graphics card - NVidia MX4400 by Asus. </s>
<s> Installed card fine, no problems. </s>
<s> In last two weeks have had crashes. </s>
<s> First one said drivers bad for card and not acceptable to windows, so went to NVidia site and installed new drivers, had problems but finally got all working again. </s>
<s> Crashed again tonight with following windows error &quot;STOP 0X000000EA THREAD_STUCK_IN_DEVISE_DRIVER (Q293078). </s>
<s> Finally got computer back up after three false starts of quitting in mid load and shutting down by itself. </s>
<s> Choose go to last known good settings and finally got back up again. </s>
<s> Do I have a defective card? </s>
<s> Y did u get such a junk graphics card? </s>
<s> I would have went for the nvidia 6600gt </s>
<s> Just wanted the cheapest card with digital output. </s>
<s> Guess it may be a problem. </s>
<s> Even tried going back to old card but couldn't get it to work as it was still recognizing new card even after deleting drivers. </s>
<s> Any good suggestions? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> At what resolution are you running it at and the refresh rate, could be that your card cannot handle or the heat is causing your comp to crash and after 3 shut downs, it cooled back down? </s>

<s> The error message has a MS notation. </s>
<s> The MS Q-number shows your video driver is stuck in an endless loop. </s>
<s> Also shows this mostly happens when Symantec PC Anywhere is installed. </s>
<s> First off, I would completely uninstall the video card and drivers. </s>
<s> Reboot and reinstall, being sure to disable any anti-virus (and PC Anywhere, if it is on the machine). </s>
<s> Probably things are out of sequence. </s>
<s> Also,LCDs have a native resolution. </s>
<s> You don't a lot of choices like a CRT. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>

<s> Running at recommended for monitor - 1280 x 1024 at 75 Hertz. </s>

<s> Am going to try the uninstall tonight and disable Norton AV and Zone Alarm, but have already tried reinstall 2x's. </s>
