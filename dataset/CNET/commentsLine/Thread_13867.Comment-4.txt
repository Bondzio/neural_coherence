thanks for clearing that up.
so you're encountering folk that feel that manuals should be available and possibly free.
these clients have been tough to handle at times but i tend to nod a lot and if they won't pay for the manuals for the task at hand i thank them for their time and consideration and hope they call again.
i didn't offer any manual since you could find them with google if they are out there.
but makers do own them so they can control how they are disseminated.
are you seeing folk that think that such is tantamount to highway robbery?
