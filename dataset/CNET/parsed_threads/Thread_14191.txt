<s> In the best explanation i can come up with, here is my problem. </s>
<s> My pc ran fine until one day the chipset heatsink popped loose. </s>
<s> after reattaching it i could not seem to get it to boot up. </s>
<s> i ordered a new board, same problem. </s>
<s> new processor installed, no bootup again. </s>
<s> new video card, nothing. </s>
<s> new power supply, nothing. </s>
<s> all this time im getting a long beeeeep, short beep beep beep. </s>
<s> after discoving this is typically bad memory, i replace memory. </s>
<s> long story short i have new everything except for a case and hard drive. </s>
<s> even with the hard drive unplugged i still get the beep error i get before. </s>
<s> i can't come up with a reasoning for all of this but it has become very expensive. </s>
<s> can anyone help? </s>
<s> And sometimes it damages whatever is connected to it. </s>
<s> The damage runs deep in this one it seems. </s>
<s> Why is your post so light on detail? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> processor in there now is a 2.4ghz celeron and before was a 2.8 ghz p4. </s>
<s> the board is an asus p4s800 and the other board is a biostar. </s>
<s> old memory was 2 512mb sticks of kingston valueram pc3200. </s>
<s> new memory is rosewill 2 512mb pc3200. </s>
<s> video card is gigabyte radeon 9250. now running a samsung cd drive 52x since my dvdrw doesnt seem to be working. </s>
<s> new power supply is a 300w antec. </s>
<s> case is an antec case. </s>
<s> other pci cards are there but pc doesnt seem to run without them installed either. </s>
<s> Read http://www.tomshardware.com/column/20011012/index.html Frankly, this power supply is suitable for the up to 1 GHz class of machines. </s>
<s> Yes, it might work for awhile, but as a test I'd slip in a 450W to see if power is the issue as well as removing all drives. </s>
<s> Nothing but motherboard, CPU/HSF, RAM and a video card. </s>
<s> Not much else is needed to see a screen display. </s>
<s> Why so small a supply? </s>
<s> Have you read http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/index.html and such articles? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i was running a 350w that came with the antec case. </s>
<s> i picked up the 300 cheap to see if the PS was the problem. </s>
<s> my concern now is where to find a 450w supply. </s>
<s> i've sort of hit the bottom of my bank account on this project and i dont want to buy anything else th at wont fix it. </s>
<s> i mean if this is the problem, i have enough to setup 2 pcs once i pick up another power supply or 2 </s>
<s> There is that test I proposed to see if there is a power issue. </s>
<s> Have you tried it? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i am reading both articles mentioned now but i do not have real access or knowledge of testing electronics </s>
<s> I propose you DOWNSIZE the machine. </s>
<s> NO HARD DISKS, NO CDROMS, just video card, one stick of RAM and the CPU plus heatsink/fan to see if a lighter load lets you see it boot. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Attempting to boot with only memory, video and processor still fails </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> after testing every part on it.. swapping every possible combination ive given up and bashed the case against the wall and floor. </s>
<s> its completely trashed now and i've wasted 1500 bucks. </s>
<s> i've given up. </s>
<s> i have way too much bad stuff going on in my life and i refuse to let this thing bother me anymore. </s>
<s> eventually i'll have it paid off and then i'll buy another pc from dell or somewhere. </s>
<s> i've discovered that god hates me and i have no desire to trick myself into thinking the something positive will ever happen. </s>
