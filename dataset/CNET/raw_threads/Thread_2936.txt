After that my Hard Drive is usually 10-15 degrees celcius hotter than my cpu. After a while of usuage my computer will automatically shut down.

I think that there might be something wrong with it (I keep hearing this sound (sounds like one of those machincal saws people use to cut wood). I checked with Asus Probe - I got 29C for cpu and 44C for HD. I also checked all the fans and the sound doesn't seem to be coming from them. Is it possible that the sound is coming from the hard drive, if so what should I do? My computer is new (1 year) and should I contact Asus?

If the HD's are up front, sometimes you have to purchase and install a front case fan for the HD. There are other solutions as well, but it depends on the particulars of your case. Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and modify your case or get a better one.
9523	12	193620	2100040	2098180	mikexz	7/29/06 2:25 PM	1.1541831E12	Well...	I am pretty sure that I won't need to add any more fans to my noisy computer. Also this problem just started 3 weeks ago after the strange noises began appearing. Before then my computer was fine, the HD was always 30C or so.
9523	13	193620	2100926	2100040	linkit	7/30/06 8:03 AM	1.15424658E12	Well, do you?	You can have success in cooling a computer system with many or few fans, but that is not the issue here. I repeat: Do you have a fan that blows over the hard drive? This is usually the front intake fan. Many cases have a place for that fan, but mfgs. do not install one there. ASIDE: You can get larger and quieter fans to take care of your noise problem.

Many if not not most PCs have fans at the bottom front of the case to induct cool air and move it directly over the internal HDDs. There are lots of choices for case fans with different CFM and noise ratings.....with and wihtout temp and speed controls. I was running SpinRite one day and noted the HDD temp. Just for the heck of it I connected an 80MM case fan to blow air over it. It was interesting to see how quickly the temp dropped.

Also I changed the position of the HD so that there would be more air flow but there wasn't a big difference (about 1C lower sometimes). I am using power max right now to check my HD, I'll post the results in a couple of minutes. thanks again for your help

I've never bought a case that didn't have at least 1 fan located at the front of the case. One case I have has 3 80mm fans .. one at the very bottom front of the case and two more located at the front of the two drive cages. And if get a chance look at some of the better cases...they all have fans located at the lower front of the case..check Lian Li VAPCMD

A friend of mine was having problems with his computer, so I stopped by his place yesterday to look at it. He told me that he turned it on, and there was nothing on the monitor, and the activity light was not flashing at all. The hardware was working fine though (Fans turning, DVD drive opens and closes, etc.). When I stopped at his house to look at it, it was working fine. I decided to update his video card driver, and make a few tweaks while I was there. After about an hour or so, I restarted the computer and it showed the previously mentioned symptoms. I reach in and touched the bay holding his hard drive, and it was effin' toasty. I told him I'll swing by with an extra fan or 3 and we'll pop those babies in. I'll let you know how that works out. Unfortunately, if it was working fine before, and now it's overheating, I think the drive is on it's death bed. I say back everything up now. A few fans might delay the innevitable, but it's not going to keep it alive forever. I'd back everything up and prepare to buy a new hard drive. These other people can keep recommending software to monitor the drive all day, but if you know it's hot, you don't need a program to tell you what you already know.

9523	21	193620	2125956	2125587	linkit	8/10/06 8:45 PM	1.1552427E12	one last thought	For pricing, search ''Completed listings'' on eBay.com for similarly configured computers. Personally, I would try the largest fan that fits the front intake before giving up. This can be done for under $10USD. Much cheaper than a new computer. I have a P4 3.0GHz (Northwood) in a mid-tower case (Antec SLK3700-BQE). It has a 120mm rear exhaust fan and a 120mm front intake fan that blows over three HD. The only other exhaust fan is in the PSU. Each HD is below 40C.
