1.1.1	How loud should a 120gb 7200 rpm hard drive be?	St
1.1.2	I put mine in and it shakes the computer desk, although not too much.	St
1.1.3	In all fairness it's a cheap computer desk from wal mart to begin with, but still it makes a humming sound, and every second it goes up for a bit and back down.	St
1.1.4	Imagine a car going by you in a race.	St
1.2.1	As many bargain machines come with 5400 or slower RPM drives with slow seek times, people may be alarmed or concerned as they install some 7200 or even faster RPM hard disk.	St
1.2.2	Another factor is that people are often not exposed to more than a few hard disks and will be bothered by the new sounds.	St
1.2.3	In short, faster means more noise and maybe a little shake as the faster seeks occur.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	If the wieght of that HD is shaking the desk, then it certainly is a cheap desk.	St
1.3.2	Any noise is not good but if your old HD was exceptionaly quiet expect a little more with the 120gb though not that much more or basically the same level.	St
1.3.3	I suggest you snug the mounting screws but not &quot;too tight&quot;.	St
1.3.4	You maybe hearing the &quot;resonance&quot; of the system case metal and if so, use small rubber washers(provided they fit) or plastic(very thin) to relp reduce resonance.	St
1.3.5	Also, check your fans as they're a known source of noisy operation especially if you knock off dusty build-up, clean them anyways.	Sug
1.3.6	You can try to set the system on a more sturdy area to see where the noise maybe coming from too.	St
1.3.7	I hope this helps... good luck -----Willy	Polite
1.4.1	firmly enough or is mounted to a flimsy piece of metal that is transferring the sound throughout the structure.	St
1.4.2	And yes, if it gets anywhere near the resonance frequency of the structure it can get loud.	St
1.4.3	Most people only put two screws in on one side of the drive because they don't know how to get the drive rack out to put screws in on both sides.	St
1.4.4	I've seen that done in repair shops, but that is because they are lazy.	St
1.5.1	The way it's set up is 2 screws on 1 side, and 1 screw in the other side.	St
1.5.2	That's what the bay allows.	St
1.5.3	And no i'm not 100% sure it was the hard drive.	Res
1.5.4	It could have probably been a number of things, it's just at the time I was installing the hard drive since I got the 300 watt power supply at a local shop (not enough connector's though, but that's in another post ).	St
1.5.5	The system isn't shaking much now but it was before.	St
1.5.6	It's just humming along nicely.	St
1.5.7	I probably will look into either the washers or these things I saw at the computer shop that are plastic and go around the power supply and some for the drives to reduce shaking or whatever.	St
