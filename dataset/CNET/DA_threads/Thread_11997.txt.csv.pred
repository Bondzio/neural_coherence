1.1.1	01) Can anyone recommend a good monthly cell provider coverage for a built-in 4GWiMax cellular chip that is in a laptop I am thinking of purchasing?	Ques
1.1.2	02) I was told that with a built-in 4GWiMax cellular chip that if I am not a light user that there will be bandwidth caps.	St
1.1.3	What are bandwidth caps and how do I get around them?	St
1.1.4	03) If the laptop I decide to purchase has a 4GWiMax cellular chip already installed and I have a monthly contract with a provider, will I be able to connect to the internet anywhere/anytime?	St
1.2.1	The reason is the location, location and location determines coverage.	St
1.2.2	I'm unsure if I can make this clearer than this.	St
1.2.3	2.	St
1.2.4	The reasons for the caps are well discussed.	St
1.2.5	I can't add much but if there are ways around it my bet the only legal one is to use some local wifi connection.	St
1.2.6	3.	St
1.2.7	No.	St
1.2.8	As we know from answer #1 that some places have no service.	St
1.2.9	But today you find new folk that have to be told this many times.	St
1.2.10	Sometimes that answer is taken badly and they complain the answer is mean or harsh but look at how cell phones work today.	St
1.2.11	Everyone I know has a dropped call.	St
1.2.12	Same for this anywhere, anytime answer.	St
1.2.13	The answer is no.	St

1.3.1	Thanks Bob.	St
1.3.2	Cory	St
1.4.1	I would avoid any built in chips.	St
1.4.2	It is much simpler to get a different adapter if your requirements change compared to getting a new laptop.	St
1.4.3	Not sure who told you that about WiMax.	St
1.4.4	This is the technology used in the sprint/clear network.	St
1.4.5	It is the same network but if you buy it from sprint and you run only 4g they have a uncapped plan.	St
1.4.6	This is the only uncapped data plan I know of.	St
1.4.7	The fine print is if you do not get enough 4G signal and switch to 3G there is a cap.	St
1.4.8	Will see the future of WiMax, there are rumors sprint/clear may change to LTE.	St
1.4.9	Your other choice is mostly verizon using LTE for 4G.	St
1.4.10	Att is suppose to roll out some LTE 4G this summer.	St
1.4.11	All these have caps of various forms.	St
1.4.12	A few other smaller providers have LTE but most only allow usage on smart phone, no PC.	St
1.4.13	Everything else that is called 4G that is not LTE or WiMAX is quite a bit slower.	St
1.4.14	The bad news is coverage is very limited, this is new technology.	St
1.4.15	Verizon if they do what they say they are should be the first to offer 4G coverage in a large area.	St
1.4.16	Still it is a long way off to expect good coverage outside of major cities.	St
1.4.17	Of course ATT promises lots but they are just starting to turn up their first towers.	St
1.5.1	But today, the tech as it stands and the companies behind it all is &quot;all about maximizing the return on investment.&quot; You may find the wired solutions to compete well with wireless.	St
