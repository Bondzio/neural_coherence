Okay.
Understand all.
I have never put a partition on the drive nor have I had to personally format even from first use.
Therefore, I say that the drive is formatted or its the first external HD that I have had to use that didn't need to be formatted before initial use.
What I have done, using that same information that you found, is connect a sata cable from sata 5 to the sata connection just behine the DVI output on the mobo itself.
I orginally connect to sata 3 as 1 and 2 are being used by other HD's.
I will try again.
