<s> Hey guys, I live in an apartment complex where they have free wireless internet throughout each building. </s>
<s> However, I'd like to be able to have a wireless network in my apartment, but somehow use the wireless internet throughout my building. </s>
<s> So, basically, I'd like to be able to have a wireless network in my home so that I could share files from my ps3 and my two computers wirelessly, but with those on that same network still be able to access the internet connection through out the building. </s>
<s> Is this possible? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>

<s> To have your own network you need a hardwire connection to start with and connect it to a wireless router. </s>
<s> I checked around after reading your post and found out that most wireless ethernet cards are on radio frequency and all I saw run at 2.4 Ghz. </s>
<s> If the wireless system at your apartment does as well then you might be in business. </s>
<s> Note I said might. </s>
<s> Check with the property manger. </s>
<s> Wireless ethernet comes in two forms external that requires a cable and internal that is a PCI card. </s>
<s> This second form does not. </s>
<s> If you have a 56k modem in your machine you can take it out and put the ethernet card in this slot. </s>
<s> Make sure you disable the 56k unit in &quot;hardware devices&quot; though. </s>
<s> Doing this will safe you a slot you may need later and reduce energy demands on your machine. </s>
<s> While you have the case open, buy a can of compressed air and clean out the dust inside your system, especially in and around the CPU. </s>
<s> This doesn't sound important but it is, do this. </s>
<s> Try to keep your hands off metal parts while inside the case. </s>
<s> All of these items are fairly simple to do and require no tools and should take only a few minutes to perform. </s>
<s> Go internal it will save you the price of the cable. </s>
<s> Go external if your computer is still on warranty. </s>
<s> I have a wireless network card, and an ethernet card also. </s>
<s> I was thinking i might be able to get the signal from my desktop's wireless and then connect to a seperate router wired and then bridge the connections. </s>
<s> I dont know how stable that would be, plus how much of a pain in the butt it would be to keep my loud desktop on. </s>
<s> I know they have wireless bridges such as the linksys wet45g but that one you have to connect it wired to the other wireless router before being to bridge them wirelessly </s>
<s> First I'll need a WIFI Ethernet Client device. </s>
<s> I'll supply an example monetarily. </s>
<s> That unit would be placed where it gets the best signal. </s>
<s> Porch, wall, closet (wherever). </s>
<s> Now we have a client we run that to our usual WIFI ROUTER's WAN port. </s>
<s> Now it looks just like any common internet service. </s>

<s> http://reviews.cnet.com/networking-and-wi-fi/netgear-me101-wireless-ethernet/4505-3243_7-30485209.html There are newer and others to be found. </s>
<s> yeah that is what i was thinking. </s>
<s> i might just get me one of those and a a router. </s>
<s> but i might just go ahead and pay the money to get my own internet connection. </s>
<s> I just dont know if the speed i get will be fast enough, especially for gaming... 1500 kbps down and only 100 kbps up. </s>
<s> let me know what you think. </s>
<s> Don't like shared connections... </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> yeah right now i am actually using someone in my apartment's wireless internet connection that isnt secured late at night when they dont use it. </s>
