1.1.1	Can anyone tell me how much importance I should put on an HD Gateway monitor/computer package , versus a similar comparable Hewlett Packard computer package with a regular lcd monitor .	Ques
1.1.2	I would prefer to buy the HP computer package , but for the price , I 'm wondering if it would be better to stare at Gateway 's HD monitor ?	Ques
1.1.3	The computer deals are about the same , at bestbuy , so I was probably just going to get the better deal .	St
1.1.4	So since the deals are also about the same , should I just go with the High Definition Gateway Monitor even though I prefer hp ?	Ques

1.2.1	your links are to the same monitor , but generally an & quot ; HD & quot ; LCD monitor can properly display a 720p HDTV signal .	St
1.2.2	if you ever plan to hook your monitor up to a cable box or dvd player , then get the HD monitor .	St
1.2.3	if it 's only going to hooked up to your PC , then HD support should n't influence your purchase decision .	Sug
