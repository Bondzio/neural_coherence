it all worked out.
many folks from ms newsgroups, cnet and hp forum gave great advice.
so i disconnected the pc and brought it outside in the sunlight where i cook hog cracklins.
someone suggested using a flat blade screwdriver.
also to straighten bent pins using the tip of a ballpoint pen.
i used the screwdriver first and got them both up.
then i shot one of my pigs and while waiting for him to finishing bleeding tested with the ballpoint pen.
supporting the pin with the blade and using the ballpoint pen to finish the top half of the pin they looked very straight.
then i put the hog cracklins frying.
reinserted the 2 dvd's, harddrive and floppy drive.
connected all the data cables very slow or slowly.
using both screwdrive and ball point pen - and it worked well.
brought it all inside, connected all cables, started up, burned all my music files to a dvd as a test.
everything is really zooming.
went outside and scooped up a large bag of hog cracklins.
eating them with my jambalaya while posting this message to you.
you really saved me the cost of a mobo.
