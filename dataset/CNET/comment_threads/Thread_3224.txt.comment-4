Mostly the 'button' is a round blob of badly molded plastic secured with two lesser blobs to some arbitrary part of the case front.
I know, because the slot button on my Sony DVD writer broke, and wouldn't eject (it did on command in 'My Computer') I had to stick cardboard behind to force it forwards.
Works fine, but shouldn't be necessary.
