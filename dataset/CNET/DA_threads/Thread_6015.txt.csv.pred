1.1.5	For the stats I have looked up it always says the MB supports AMD 64 X2 up to 5200+ .	St
1.1.6	I am currently running a 5400 processor ... so I am wondering , is it safe to assume that the MB can handle any AM2 64 X2 .	St
1.1.7	Possibly the 6400 ?	Ques
1.1.8	Also .	St
1.1.9	I saw one website selling this MB bundled with the new Phenom X4 processor ... . is it even compatible ?	Ques

1.3.1	Mtrbds .	St
1.3.2	can provide support for newer released cpus when they are & quot ; bios updated & quot ; .	St
1.3.3	Since , you gave no mention of the system model # , if OEM then that maker is the 1st place to visit fo such an update , otherwise the mtrbd .	St

1.3.8	You said , & quot ; MB supports AMD 64 X2 up to 5200+ .	St
1.3.9	I am currently running a 5400 & quot ; thus the answer is already YES .	St
1.3.10	You are currently running 1 cpu above the listed level .	St
1.3.11	Wherever you got your system has already provided a bios update/status that supports newer cpus .	St

1.3.13	Just be sure to check the specs and go from there .	Sug
