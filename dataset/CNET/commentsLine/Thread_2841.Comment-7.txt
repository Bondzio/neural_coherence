first of all thanks for the suggestions and thoughts.
i don't how the coffee discussion came up.
i was reading around the dell website and it looks like the cd/dvd combo reads and burns cds at 40x.
games that run from the cd like doom 3 and vice city run a bit lagging.
it's not the system it's a 3.4 ghz with 2gb of ram, and 256mb video card.
my brother had an extra burner so i installed it, and it was rather easy.
the computer had everything i needed, but i'm looking at getting a brand new one either a lg, plextor, or sony.
again thanks for the help.
