just the IDE cable ?
the IDE cable with any drive, the hard drive connected?
what if you just connect the power to 'it...but not the IDE cable.
Sometimes connecting just 'power' (without the IDE data cable) to a hard drive can kill a system....can you check that scenario too ?
You said: ide...yeah, not dead, but it will all power up without it plugged in, and with it plugged in, all seems to be on... lights fans, et cetera, just no power to the drives... Posted by: destructicon (see profile) - 05/07/2006 3:28 PM
