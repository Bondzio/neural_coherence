I have used a 4pin to 8pin adapter so that both 8pin female power jacks are used on the MOBO. When I first turned on the system, it would reboot about 5-7 min after starting...it would do this cycle many times until i just turned it off. I tried it today and the server will not turn on at all...Do i need a better suited PS? This is seemingly a power issue...any thoughts?

The only thing is from this link i have yet to find one that specifically states that it has 2 8pin connectors....they only display the +12V1@18A, +12V2@18A which i believe i have seen with the 1 8pin and 1 4pin configurations.
