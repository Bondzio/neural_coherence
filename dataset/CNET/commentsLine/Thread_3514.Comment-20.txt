that was one of the questions i had in my original post.
i am wondering if it is just that easy, get a newer atx board with a faster processor and heatsink, more ram, possibly a larger power supply, and just plug it into my case and existing peripherals.
is it going to be that easy?
will any atx standard mobo work?
