<s> I want to upgrade my computers RAM from 1 Gig to 3 gigs and I wanted to know whether the new RAM I get should be EXACTLY the same as the factory-installed RAM( as in the Mhz rating, PCxxxx type , and manufacturer) On that note I want to use two video cards and I am want know if you can use 2 different cards( the one in my computer is the ATI X700 and the one I want to use with it is the nVidia 6800 Ultra) </s>
<s> why do you need 3 gigs of ram? </s>
<s> seems like overkill for pretty much every application out there. </s>
<s> but to answer your question as i understand things as long as it'll fit into the slot the system will automaticaly configure the memory to operate at the slowest speed... meaning if you have say a stick of ddr 333 and 2 of ddr 400 the ddr 400 will be &quot;underclocked&quot; to operate at the same speed as the 333. and no you cant use 2 different cards. </s>
<s> they have to be the same model. </s>
<s> ATI and Nvidia use different setups to utilize SLI type technology and boards so no you cant wire them together in a sort of hybred SLI setup. </s>
<s> if you're going to go for a dual card setup go with a pair of 6800s; or even better 7800s. </s>
<s> simultaneously. </s>
<s> Even with 2 pci-express slots. </s>
<s> Why need 2? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Still 3gb is overkill. </s>
<s> Those games are new, but 2gb is good, unless of course you are running a 64+ player server on BF2?? </s>
<s> And, the Ultra will play each very well. </s>
<s> replace the factory installed card with a nVidia model(6800 Ultra is what Im going for) </s>
<s> 2 GB's of memory is quite enough. </s>
<s> If you check benchmarks posted on most games, the system memory is not as much of an issue as the video card. </s>
<s> You probably wouldn't even get a 5 FPS boost using 3 GB instead of 2 GB. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
