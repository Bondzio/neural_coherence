Don't think your wanting to solve your problem.
As I already asked ..... Is the jumper on CDROM set to master?
Maybe &quot;cable select &quot; if not noticed when on master.
Did u enable sata in the bios.
Bring it here I'll fix it or tell u what broke in 10 minutes !!
Now your forcing my hand lol I have to ask what this exactly means &quot;I've never built a computer from scratch, but I have put them together hundreds of times before.&quot;
