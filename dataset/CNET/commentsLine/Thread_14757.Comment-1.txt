i have a new inspiron e1505 that i want to hook up to this router i just purchased: srx200 wireless-g broadband routers with srx (wrt54gx2) and then network with an older laptop dell latitude c600.
i currently have powerlink highspeed internet that was initially installed with my old dell latitude c600.
ideally i would like to have a network with the old dell and the router (wired) and the new inspiron (wireless).
i wanted to know of any tips before getting started, neither laptop has been configured for any type of network, both laptops have windows xp.
i am not sure which &quot;wizard&quot; to run first: windows network, wireless wizard or the installation cd w/ the router software.
thanks!
