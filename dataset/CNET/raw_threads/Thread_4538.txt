If it doesn't have the proper output you'll need to get one that does. There's no way to change the TVs PC input.

If it has 1080p, I am pretty sure there would also be hdmi connection. What kind of contents are you trying to view at 1080p? You have a PS3 or blu-ray player on that PC? I will also venture to say if you don't have a HD video card you might not have much fun trying to output 1080p contents. Just my thoughts.
