I just rebooted the computer by using f4 at the startup of the computer and it worked.
It seems that my files aren't gone because the amount of free space in my hard drive remained the same but nothing is showing when i search for it.
I was wondering how to recover or show these hidden files.
I've even added up all the files in my hard drive that i could access and it doesn't go over 150 gig.
when the properties tell me that it is using 250 gigs, the same space before i rebooted the computer.
