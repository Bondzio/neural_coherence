1.1.1	I am interested in building a new desktop system around the Intel E6600 Core 2 Duo processor.	St
1.1.2	Can anyone advise me on what the best motherboard would be to use with this processor?	Ques
1.1.3	I am looking for SPEED to run programs like Adobe Creative Suite 2, and Adobe Premier video editing.	St
1.1.4	Right now, my system is dying trying to run these programs.	St
1.1.5	From what I have read, the E6600 should have more than enough horsepower for at least the next year or so.	St
1.1.6	But, I need a good MB that will handle this processor, as well as at least 2 GB of fast dual channel RAM with spare slots for upgrade later if needed, and a fast SATA 3 harddrive interface.	St
1.1.7	I am not looking for a 'gamers' system, so I think onboard video and audio should suffice for my application.	St
1.1.8	However, I would need onboard LAN and preferably a number of USB 2.0 and firewire ports.	St
1.1.9	Also, I would like these ports on the FRONT of the system case, if that is possible, for easy access.	St
1.1.10	So, if anyone can give me some advice, or pointer on where to look, I would really appreciate it.	Ques
1.1.11	Thanks!!	St

1.2.1	Perpers.com and the many others you can find through Google.	St
1.2.2	They all seem to focus on a couple of high-priced MBs by ASUS P5W DH Deluxe and another from Intel motherboard D975X Bad Axe.	St
1.2.3	If you can, I'd hold off a little as long as you can and see how these products do after a little further testing and BIOS revisions.... some were not much more than engineering samples or near production samples versus retail boards at the time they were tested.	St
1.2.4	Re the video...by all means get a video card .	St
1.2.5	.	St
1.2.6	even if it isn't $300-$400 card.	St
1.2.7	There are lots of attractively priced GPUs that would be great for the use indicated ... not to mention what Vista will want when it comes out in Jan 07.	St
1.2.8	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	i would only recommend motherboards based on the intel 965 or 875 chipsets.	St
1.4.2	ati/nvidia motherboards will support the core 2 but for best compatibility this early after release, stick with the 965 or 975 chipsets.	St
1.4.3	anandtech has an article about core 2 duo mobos at http://www.anandtech.com/mb/showdoc.aspx?i=2797 .	St
1.4.4	IMO, the best motherboard for a core 2 duo is the Asus P5W-DH Deluxe.	St
1.4.5	its the mobo that practically every web site has been using to benchmark the core 2 duo and, as its been available since early this year, its the most mature and stable conroe compatible mobo.	St
1.4.6	but the i975 is intel's high-end chipset and the motherboard is expensive.	St
1.4.7	the 965 chipset is intel's mainstream chipset for all current CPUs.	St
1.4.8	it's brand new so mobos that use it may still have a few rough edges.	St
1.4.9	i believe the best choices for a 965 mobo are the Biostar TForce P965 Deluxe, the Intel DP965LT, and the ASUS P5B.	St
1.4.10	The Biostar's received very good reviews; the Intel is a safe bet (but still may have issues); and ASUS will smooth any rough edges out quickly.	St
1.5.1	Thanks for the reply.	St
1.5.2	I am still digging into this.. was at my dealer today and I suggested the Gigabyte boards with the 965 chipset might be what I want.. he said they had all been recalled for chip defects, and they were not expecting any new boards for at least a month.	St
1.5.3	Another discussion I read about the Intel boards was that they needed an upgrade, and it could only be done with an older CPU installed... then, they could plug the new CPU in to run.	St
1.5.4	Sounds weird.	St
1.5.5	Anyway, my dealer said the E6600 CPU is way backlogged.. they won't be getting shipment til then end of September.	St
1.5.6	Even then, only a handful are destined for Canada..	St
1.5.7	I had to give them a deposit to be put on the wait list.	St
1.5.8	So, I guess I have some time to research mobos.	St
1.6.1	as i mentioned earlier, the 965 chipset is brand new and issues are to be expected.	St
1.6.2	the most common ones are related to memory.	St
1.6.3	your safest bet is to stick to 1.8V ddr2-667 or ddr2-800 from corsair/ocz/crucial.	St
1.6.4	i'd steer clear of cheap ram and ram claiming ddr2-1066 (which isn't a real spec... their SPD may be out-of-whack).	St
1.6.5	frankly, i wouldn't consider a gigabyte board this early.	St
1.6.6	gigabyte has a rep of being very innovative but pushing products out too quickly.	St
1.6.7	the gigabyte 965 board reviewed at anandtech had problems that i find typical of new gigabyte hardware.	St
1.6.8	your best you can hope to get this month is probably an e6300, maybe a e6400.	St
1.6.9	everything faster is on allocation to high tier vendors (dell, hp, etc.).	St
1.6.10	ncix supposedly has some instock today (e6300 $260, e6400 $326 CAD): http://www.ncix.com/products/index.php?majorcatid=101&minorcatid=106 e6300s/e6400s have great OC potential so if you're adventuresome you could get them past e6600 speeds rather easily.	St
1.7.1	Lots of people are going for Gigabyte's DS3 and DS4 motherboards, just a suggestion.	St
1.7.2	The asus board mentioned, i think, can have bad compatability issues, with some needing the bios flashed before working with conroe processors.	St
1.8.1	I am leaning towards the DS4.. mainly because it has onboard firewire ports, and I want to have both USB and Firewire ports out the front of my case for easy access.	St
1.8.2	It also has additional memory slots for expansion - many of the other boards seem to only have 2 slots, so if you want to upgrade later, you need to discard you current memory sticks and buy larger ones.	St
1.8.3	I would much rather just add to the existing memory.	St
1.8.4	However, as I said earlier, my dealer said all the 965 chipset Gigabyte boards have been recalled because of defects in the chipsets.	St
1.8.5	New one are expected within the next month or so.	St
1.8.6	I am in no hurry.. the E6600 won't be available until mid to late September, if I am lucky!	St
1.8.7	Thanks for all the responses.	St
