on the netgear 108 mbps wireless router i'm considering for purchase, i did not find the designation you're talking about, or am i just not finding it?
the one i'm pricing is labeled a &quot;storage router.&quot; is that dfferent?
can i use it as i intend to or not?
(please see my post above titled &quot;help: my dog ate...&quot;) thanks.
