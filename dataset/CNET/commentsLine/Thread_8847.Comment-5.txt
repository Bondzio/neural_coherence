ok i've got another thread going, but maybe you've had experience with both.
is ddr2 running at 533mhz with 4-4-4-12 timings any faster than ddr at 400mhz with 2.5-3-3-7?
i've built a few systems, but i've never really messed with the timings.
i'll soon have my hands on a gig of both types and i want to get another gig to match.
i've read a bunch of conflicting articles, but most seem to think that unless you get ddr2 with really good timings, ddr is still the way to go.
good timings + ddr2 = $$$
