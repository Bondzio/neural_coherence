<s> I have a WD My Book Pro II 1T external harddrive and one of the 500GB drives has failed. </s>
<s> I had it set up under the RAID configuration so I have not lost any data. </s>
<s> What I would like to know is can I replace the bad drive with the following WD 500GB harddrive WD5000AAKS? </s>
<s> The bad drive has the following on it WD5000KS. </s>
<s> They are both SATA drives and it looks like it will work, but I'd like to get some input. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>

<s> Did you confirm that one of the HD's failed; or is it the case that both hard drives are physically healthy, but the RAID-1 array failed? </s>
<s> It's possible that both HD's are healthy, but the array needs to be rebuilt. </s>
