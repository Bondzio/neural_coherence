Please don't respond with, &quot;use cisco&quot;. Please respond with a model and resoning or personal expierance. Price is not much of an issue. Looking probably around $1k each. (Of course lets not spend for something I dont need) Only needs to support around 200 machines.

Things like a RV042 or 82 will most likely work and these are very cheap. If you want something with more feature we use juniper (netscreen) SSG5. We get a huge discount but they are well under $1000 and are full firewalls with vpn and many other features. In theory you should be able to pass more encrypted traffic though them than the linksys but I have not ever tested it to see if its true. We have a few hundred of these installed for various purposes
