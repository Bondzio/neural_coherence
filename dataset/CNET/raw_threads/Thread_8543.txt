My problem is that sometimes the drive is activated even though there is no disk in it. It seems to happen mostly when I am on the Internet. No viruses detected, spybot is run weekly. I am running a Gigabyte Technology K8 Triton motherboard and an AMD Sempron processor, 512mb ram, onboard video, LAN, and a modem. I really have no clue as to why it is doing this, but I do know it did not do it when I first built the computer.

Getting to the locations to find the culprit are different than XP so you will have to do some searching for them. http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/2003/s1408/53s08/53s08.asp&guid=
