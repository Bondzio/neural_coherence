<s> HP once told me how to remove static electricity to reduce random mouse movements. </s>
<s> Anyone remember how? </s>

<s> Static would dissipate within a few minutes of you sitting down at your PC. </s>
<s> Unless you sit with woolen slippers on and shuffle your feet on the carpet? </s>
<s> Static can sit in something. </s>
<s> That's what static means. </s>
<s> Do you know the process? </s>
<s> It was pushing down the power button when turned off or something. </s>
<s> Thanks, </s>
<s> I did ESD control in the labs for years. </s>
<s> We would treat surfaces, install wrist straps and more. </s>
<s> However in PCs you have many conductive surfaces so it goes away in a few minutes after you sit down. </s>
<s> Unless you are generating it! </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I've seen it mentioned before. </s>
<s> Seriously. </s>
<s> I'm not looking for your view of it disapating. </s>
<s> I'm looking for the process. </s>
<s> Working in a lab, it would disapate. </s>
<s> In closed box - there is a process to release any build up. </s>
<s> That's for bumping this up with answers, but I hope someone who remembers, notices this post. </s>
<s> Unknown. </s>
<s> Thoughts. </s>
<s> Since you are the source/battery....touch and hold something grounded. </s>
<s> I doubt you can build much of a charge if you have your finger on a ground. </s>
<s> Raise the humidity in the area. </s>
<s> Static will bleed off faster than you can generate it. </s>
<s> Wear the wrist strap to a ground. </s>
<s> Increase humidity (what is it now?) </s>
<s> And my best tool. </s>
<s> The antistatic mat on the work surface. </s>
<s> Let's hope this is not about random mouse movements. </s>
<s> That's never been a static issue. </s>
<s> I've seen people try that and fail each time. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> taking out battery, unplugging & holding down power button. </s>
<s> So what causes mouse to jump once in a while, or insert to toggle on it's own? </s>
<s> I'm doing it because I'm desperate to find ways to reduce something coming from the unit since repair that's hurting my ears. </s>
<s> Can't hear it, but original problem was the now famous buzz (the rmclock did get rid of it). </s>
<s> Wish I'd known about that before sending it in. </s>
<s> Because now something is wrong with the new fan. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> It's blowing cold. </s>
<s> I've changed to older bios so it isn't always on but it's still blowing downright cold air. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Some buzz or aspect is causing ear pain. </s>
<s> I don't need to develop tinnis from a laptop. </s>
<s> So figured removing static couldn't hurt - specially since mouse & insert's been a problem since got it back from HP. </s>
<s> Now there's a clue. </s>
<s> There is a KNOWN issue where the laptop battery ages and it loads the laptop PSU and you get random mouse and keyboard issues. </s>
<s> I consider this discussion almost closed as that is not a static issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So it has nothing to do with battery doing anything. </s>
<s> Bob - You don't get to close MY discussion. </s>
<s> I appreciate your input & if you don't have to add when you don't want to, that's fine. </s>
<s> But it is my thread that I started. </s>
<s> Someone may still be able to confirm static process & more, add something about my problems themselves. </s>
<s> All around it. </s>
<s> You may have the age old dancing mouse issue and members as well as I noted how to reduce and remove static. </s>
<s> If that is not enough then the issue is elsewhere. </s>
<s> In fact, why isn't this a warranty issue at this point? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Because you have issues with this laptop already and now a static one, it seems too much is going on. </s>
<s> With all this happening, you may a warranty problem and have to escalate it for a true repair or refund. </s>
<s> Of course static(ESD) is part of your environment. </s>
<s> If you have such an issue, you're the cause as well as the home. </s>
<s> You as a person transmit or allow as you're the conduit for ESD passage. </s>
<s> A properly grounded modern home will provide a path to discharge if you touch anything already grounded. </s>
<s> There are desktop style static touchpads for such use. </s>
<s> You can then touch laptop. </s>
<s> A &quot;anti-static floor mat&quot; can help as well as using static sprays if alot of static build-up is happening. </s>
<s> While you mentioned it maybe the battery then you got a &quot;electrical issue&quot; not a static one. </s>
<s> Let's be clear if all of this is happening, then the 1st sentences above applies. </s>
<s> Then again, if you truly have a static problem, then its not HP laptop fault, this is something you have to resolve. </s>
<s> I have provided some solutions above. </s>
<s> You can also take the laptop to a totally different area(someone's else home or library) and check out results there. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> which you answered. </s>
<s> I said, I'd sent it to HP for repair 3xs & it's getting worse with each repair. </s>
<s> I also said, static wasn't a known cause, just one more thing to try for what has become bigger problems (not mouse bouncing, but buzz, ear pain, cold fan blowing too much). </s>
<s> So this thread is getting more attention than my first one a day or day ago - that had all the details & worries. </s>
<s> I assumed since you'd answered it, you'd followed that info. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
<s> Removing static was an effort to see if it'd help the real problems. </s>
<s> Here's where I posted them. </s>
<s> (This link was just because I couldn't remember the removal process for static.) </s>

<s> With each new discussion it is a new discussion. </s>
<s> This way the discussion starts unpolluted from prior discussions. </s>
<s> Dancing mice pointers are not fun to deal with. </s>
<s> Even more so if it's the laptop pad. </s>
<s> For years I've used simple solutions like external mice, no drivers with great success. </s>
<s> However once in a while you encounter some that what the mouse pad to be fixed. </s>
<s> For that we must deal with the product's maker as there is no other place to go. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> not the issue. </s>
<s> All I wanted with this thread was the PROCESS. </s>
<s> I added the mouse info because you said there'd couldn't be a static problem. </s>
<s> This is way off my original problems. </s>
<s> Please check out the original threads I've linked to below (in response to next person's inputs).... and see what can help with those. </s>
<s> Please don't focus on the inconsequential. </s>
<s> The mouse isn't &quot;bouncing around&quot; or anything at some rate to worry about. </s>
<s> I just wanted the PROCESS for removal. </s>
<s> We covered this in this discussion. </s>
<s> More than one person has told you how to control static. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Put not the removal proccess I was looking for that doesn't involve long term special pads or actions. </s>
<s> Just at the moment removal. </s>
<s> Obviously you haven't heard of it. </s>
<s> So be it. </s>
<s> Please check out the threads I mentioned & move on from this one. </s>
<s> Do many people answer on cnet PC hardware except you? </s>
<s> Just ground yourself and you drain the static from what you touch in seconds. </s>
<s> Yes other people answer but something is amiss here. </s>
<s> You have the answers but must be searching for something else as a member and I have answered your question. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> My background is from labs where we used many forms of ESD controls and measured what was on surfaces and more. </s>
<s> It's unlikely you will encounter someone else with years of working with the ESD and control of ESD issue. </s>
<s> You obviously are not familar with what I'm talking about. </s>
<s> You're years of experience can still leave a gap in smaller items here or there, such as the procedure I'm talking about. </s>
<s> Besides - you haven't gone back to the original issues. </s>
<s> Just focused from the beginning of this tread to now to tell me &quot;I&quot; don't know what I'm doing. </s>
<s> You're really got to read the details to understand what I said. </s>
<s> No grounding myself to it won't do what I was trying for - there is a procedure, I think just holding down the power button without power. </s>
<s> So, please buzz off or help me fix the buzz . </s>
<s> I'm beginning to feel a bit of arrogance coming my way & I'm frustrated enough, without that too. </s>
<s> I see that you want to remove static. </s>
<s> This is VERY easy. </s>
<s> Just ground yourself and hold onto the laptop at some metal surface. </s>
<s> The USB port is a good one. </s>
<s> In a minute the static is drained. </s>
<s> Now you say its still there? </s>
<s> Let's say it is. </s>
<s> And let's say it causes your mouse to jump. </s>
<s> Here's the problem. </s>
<s> As the mouse jumps some of that potential energy is used up so it will fade within a few minutes. </s>
<s> -&gt; I feel your frustration with the jumping mouse but you are pursuing a dead end. </s>
<s> Maintain this direction at your own peril of missing out on the real fixes. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You aren't reading my notes & giving me nonsense answers. </s>
<s> Your even claiming I said things I didn't say. </s>
<s> Enough. </s>
<s> Try actually reading what I wrote. </s>
<s> You are asking how to remove static electricity which you say is causing your mouse to move. </s>
<s> &quot;How remove static elec from system? </s>
