hi, i'm looking to buy a mac and i want to do some video editing on it.
(video is a side job for me) i'm looking a 2.0 ghz or faster processor, at least 1 gig of ram, and a decent video card.
hard drive size doesn't matter- i'm going to buy an external.
so what mac would be best for me?
i'm on a very tight budget.
i thought about buying a mini, adding a dvd burner, and adding ram, but the processor speed wouldn't be that great.
so should i get a macbook?
or am i better off with an imac?
portability is not an issue- i'm just looking for the best value for my money.
