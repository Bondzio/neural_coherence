1.1.1	Hi .	St
1.1.2	When I first set up a wireless network in my house a few years ago , I bought a Linksys WRK54G router .	St
1.1.3	It 's been disconnecting a lot and occasionally the wireless Internet connection is unusually slow .	St
1.1.4	I know that it 's a poor quality router and that Linksys stopped supporting it in 2004 .	St
1.1.5	I was wondering if anyone would recommend a good router that is n't prone to disconnections .	St
1.1.6	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	Disconnections and slow connections can have many causes .	St
1.2.2	Scan for viruses AND spyware Use latest router firmware Use latest network adapter drivers Use latest network adapter firmware ( some models ) .	St
1.2.3	Enable SSID Try different channels ( 1 , 6 , or 11 first ) Use security to keep neighbors off your network .	St
1.2.4	Move portable phones and microwave ovens away form router .	St
1.2.5	Computer is too far from router/access point -- move router to more centrally located position .	St
1.2.6	There are good routers from Linksys , DLink , and Netgear here in the USA .	St
1.2.7	A wireless-g model should be good for now .	St
1.2.8	If you need a stronger signal , consider the highly rated MIMO routers .	St
1.3.1	old tech is good but i see nyou mentioned years in your phrase it is time to UPGRADE and treet your self to something new if you can afford it and get you one of the more up to date models they have much inproved speed and security it will get more options in your router set up page and have new things to learn about and play with and you may even increase the over all performance of your TIRED connection 1-800-33qad ;	St
1.4.1	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.4.2	I 'll still be doing research , but your posts helped me out .	St
