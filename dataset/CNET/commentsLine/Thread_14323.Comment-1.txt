i will be upgrading my g4 graphite 400mhz and g4 mdd dual 1.25ghz setup to the latest g5 dual 2ghz.
please advise if and how i can:- 1) move the g4 graphite's stock internal hd to the g4 dual (as 2nd hd).
2) move the g4 dual's stock internal hd to the new g5 dual (as 2nd hd).
3) replace both g4 graphite's and g4 mdd's main internal hd.
thank you.
