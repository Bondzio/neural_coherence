I have: Nokia 6230 Toshiba Equium Laptop with USB 2.0 ports Windows XP Home Edition Nokia Connectivity cable I am planning to buy a bluetooth donlge for my laptop, but then wondered: Would it be possible to connect my phone to my laptop (via the cable or infra-red) and then use the bluetooth on the phone, making my phone itself the bluetooth dongle.
Unleashing it's power to my laptop.
Any tech-wizard up for the challenge?
