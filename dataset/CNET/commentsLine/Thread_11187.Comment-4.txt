i always recommend turning off all encryption, mac filtering, etc.
security settings when trying to get a new wifi network established.
get it to work under plain vanilla conditions.
perhaps there is something funky about the driver settings that you need to delete and reinstall the wifi card driver on the new laptop.
perhaps there is something about the channel.
perhaps there is something about... and the list could go on.
but if mismatched security settings are in the way, you'll never know what might be wrong because the router and the card will simply refuse to talk to each other, leaving you with no idea why.
so turn all that off for now.
get the connection established, and then put the security back on one step at a time.
