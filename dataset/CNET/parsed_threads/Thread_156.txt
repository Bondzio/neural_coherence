<s> The first thing to check is the small print of your contract with your ISP. </s>
<s> If that doesn't allow sharing WiFi outside your own home (and usually it doesn't), this discussion is a no-go on this forum. </s>
<s> So please provide a link to their TOS. </s>
<s> We're a law-abiding forum, you know. </s>

<s> no probs will do ... my neighbour is family, so don't know if this make any difference .... but will check ... thanks for the info Kees regards Gary </s>
<s> http://www.afar.net/wireless/ethernet-bridge/ Get a quote to see what the cost is. </s>
<s> I find most folk never implement such since access even on dialup is cheaper. </s>

<s> LMAO so sorry i meant 50 meters ... 50 m to me has always been meters ... miles is 'ml' ... i'm from the UK so it must mean different in other places, sorry i should have put meters Gary </s>
<s> Put the router in LOS of the target and then off to the kitchen to soup up the WiFi. </s>
<s> Here's the video. </s>
<s> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOBfxbpxosA 50 meters might not need anything but I find folk stick the router in the basement then ask why WiFi is so terrible. </s>

<s> Weren't it yards? </s>
<s> And miles in stead of km? </s>
<s> And lb's in stead of kg? </s>

<s> LOL ... i live in spain now .... but there's so many foreigners in the UK ... it could be anything now </s>

<s> my router is upstairs and my uncle has an Edimax EW-7612UAN V - it's a 3db, 300 Mbps usb antenna ... but he signal is weak and will not work if we put a usb cable longer than 3m on it </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yard_%28sailing%29 Just last week I read a manual with the phrase &quot;metric meters&quot; and will have to see why they added that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I thought you wrote &quot;50m away from in LOS&quot; so what are you saying here? </s>
<s> If it's not in Line Of Sight (LOS) then it's not and all bets are off. </s>
<s> You can forget about 300 Mbps since that's under ideal conditions such as 6 meters or less with no obstructions. </s>
<s> Try plain old 802.11g settings on the router. </s>
