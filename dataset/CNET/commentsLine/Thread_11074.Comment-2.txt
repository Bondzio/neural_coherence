your 1st ques - ati makes the gpu (graphics processing unit) which is then embedded on a graphic card which is manufactured by asus/xfx/club 3d/powercoler/sapphire etc.
your 2nd ques: the 128 bit bandwidth of radeon hd 4770 having gddr5 memory is about thrice faster than graphics card with gddr3 memory having the same clock freqeuncy.
so its the best card in its price range(sometimes even better than some of the pricier ones like raadeon hd 4850) so go for radeon hd 4770 with no hesitation...
