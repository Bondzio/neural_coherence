<s> The AMD HD9600WCGDBOX Phenom 9600 Quad Core Processor is about $20 more than the AMD HD9600WCJ4BGD Phenom 9600 Quad Core Processor. </s>
<s> I was looking the specs for each and they are both the same. </s>
<s> Is there a difference between the 2 besides the part numbers? </s>
<s> the oem part will not come with a heatsink/fan. </s>
<s> the other 'RETAIL', then another difference is product warranty. </s>
<s> Warranty on OEM products is from the retailer/seller and is usually whatever the retailer/seller provides ...30 days, 60 days, 90 days etc.,. </s>
<s> On the otherhand, retail boxed CPUs whether Intel or AMD, usually have 3 year warranties from the manufacturer. </s>
<s> My recommendation, get a retail boxed CPU which gives you the HS fan and the longer 'manufacturer-backed' warranty. </s>
