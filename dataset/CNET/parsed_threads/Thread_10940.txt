<s> Recently I bought a new syste which I asembled myself and after the reboot from installing the video card drivers, the screen remains blank and the monitor loses its signal from the computer. </s>
<s> I thinbk that this might be some sort of driver conflict but am not sure. </s>
<s> Can anyone offer some advice as how to fix is problem? </s>
<s> p.s. </s>
<s> i am currently running the defult vga drivers. </s>
<s> Thanx, Cameron </s>
<s> I also can only run on standard vga. </s>
<s> the card is running on an ABIT fatality mainboard AA8XE Sys: p4 3.8 1gig DDR2 @675mhz win xp home with sp2 160gig SATA bassically if i install the drivers from the cd that came with the card, the system boots up but then the hole system locks up and the screen goes off (blank). </s>
<s> sometimes i can get into windows, but again as soon as i try and do anything with the mouse (cliking START for instance) the same occurs. </s>
<s> I have reflashed BIOS with the latest from ABIT and have upto date DxD. </s>
<s> I too am having problems with the drivers that came with my card .Let me know how you resolve your sissue I will do the same. </s>

<s> I posted elsewhere but I had a X700 brandnew and it kept loosing my vedio signal drove me nuts still not sure if I have it right but I reinstalled the 5.2 catalyst and the bios and the motherboard for a 775 chipset so far everything is going well but I haven't stressed the system yet as that could be a sure way to get my monitor to go on and off again,same driver I believe lots of issues with different boards in doing my research, I thought going to a 850 or some other PCI express vedio might solve my problem as they have a seperate powersupply, geuss not. </s>
