Alright, so I am waiting for black friday to buy all (most) of my pc components to build a new pc. This is the first pc I have ever built but my dad is an electrical engineer, which will hopefully help. I basically want a computer that can game (including crysis).. but in all honesty I will probably end up just doing web and programming stuff.. but still want to game every now and then. 1.Budget: Currently the build up there is &lt;$500 so trying to keep it that way. 2.Brands: No preference. 3.Multitasking: Not ridiculous amounts but I want to be able to. 4.Gaming: I actually never game but I definitely want to be able to (and I will try it for awhile) 5.Calculations: No 6.Overclocking: I don't want to over clock but it would be nice if I had the option (currently the mobo and processor are said to be oc compatible. 7.Storage: Eh. Ive never filled a computer to 80gb but there are cheap hds that have way more...so whatever. 8.Legacy Support: No, this is a completely new build. 9.Operating System: Do you want Windows XP or Vista, or Linux compatibility? All of them 10.Case: I'm not educated enough to know what type of case I want. 11.Accessories: Already got'em. 12.Recycled Components: If anything, just hd. 13.Monitor: Got one (22). 14.Stores: Trustable stores. 15.Location: US Anyways, this is what I am thinking Case http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119068 $44.99 OR http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811146041 $30 till 11/26/08 Front fan?

(I have a 80gb in my old computer atm) ~$40 Excluding monitor/mouse/keyboard/speakers, am I missing anything? Would some of these not go together well? Is there anything I should get instead of what I listed? What memory would go with that motherboard (I looked on newegg but they didn't have the motherboard listed in their memory finder). If I were to get dual gpus or a better one, would it be able to play intense games like crysis at 40fps+? Thankyou so much! (And please, if there is one thing you can answer, tell me if the case and power supply are good, because the sale ends 11/26).

It's not free so tack 100 to 200 on the list so that leaves us 400 to build a machine to run Crysis. We know that we'll want a dual core CPU and 2GB RAM so that's a bare minimum. Now blow the rest of the budget on the video card from this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2064.html Please get as much video card as you can as Cysis is going to use it all.

The low end C2D's get really good (+1GHz) Overclocks. On AMD's side we have the 5000+ and 5400+ Black Editions, the adjustable multiplier helps, bump it up and you can get 3.2 w/out voltage increases, if you need more, set multiplier to 15 and play with the FSB and vcore.
