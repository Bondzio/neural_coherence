i got mine two months ago and i printed out about 10 excellent quality pictures in the first week or so.
my ink was at 90%, and have not touched it much for maybe to mix in some blue and a tad of yellow in the past two months.
slowly they've been getting low on ink, until now which two inks have run out and the rest are at out as well.
i haven't printed anything demanding such as photos, just black and white text, and it went from 90% to 0%.
even more frustrating is that it won't even let me print or copy in black and white.
and i guess the worse thing of all this, is that it won't even let me use the scanner option.
i figured, since it's not doing any printing, it would at least let me scan something... but no, it keeps asking for ink.
it's very disappointing.
it may be my fault for not printing much in color, but my epson 750 color ink never dried out this quickly.
this one shouldn't have either.
