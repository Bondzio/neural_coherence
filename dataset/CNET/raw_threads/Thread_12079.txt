Question - which is better to use, or does it matter. As a side note I do know HDMI carries both Audio and Video, while the DVI-D does not carry audio, but that is not an issue for me. I have the sound taken care of through my sound card and a seperate external speaker config. So I am asking strictly for the graphic part of it. does one work better? Or is it both digital signals and thus pretty much the same? Finally, I assume either will give a better picture than if I use the VGA connection (which I also have) - correct?

Forget VGA, it has zero to offer you unless you ever need to use an old monitor for some reason. Naturally you should always set the video adapter resolution in Windows to match the LCD monitor's native resolution, any other setting causes a noticeable losss of image quality. SC
