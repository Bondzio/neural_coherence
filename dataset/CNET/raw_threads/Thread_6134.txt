Is there any way I can get these functions to work on this printer? I am using an Acer 5635Z 64bit laptop.

Did you try that? http://www.hamrick.com/vuescan/epson_stylus_cx3650.html claims their scanner software works but do drop them a line. Bob

VueScan seems very impressive but the free test one has dollar signs over the result. The usable one costs $39. Question..is it worth spending this on an old printer or do I buy a new one?

A few get upset over the lack of drivers as the years roll by. While I can explain why this is so what I want to write is this -&gt; Many get so upset they write &quot;I'll never buy from them again.&quot; Here's my observation. This issue is not limited to just a few makers. I've seen this happen with every product over the years from each maker. HOWEVER I have had good luck with Windows 7 XP MODE where I use an old outdated no driver will ever be found USB MICROSCOPE. This device has been very nice to capture pictures of stuff I need to document. It would be a shame to work that hard and for some there is that cost to upgrade to Windows 7 Pro or higher so Vuescan is likely the cheap exit unless there is a new all in one that is cheaper than vuescan.

VueScan seems very good but I must weigh this against the cost of a brand new printer/scanner for about 50. You are right about about the compatibility cost of Windows 7. I lost Adobe Photoshop, Corel Draw, VideoCam Look, Greeting Card Magic and Canon Zoom Browser does not link to Pictures. All these were working well on XP so I seem to be paying the price of getting up to date.

Then you gain access to XP Mode and those old softwares can run in XP Mode. Maybe that would be worth it? It takes a little learning to master it but I find it to be a great solution. Bob
