I have just subscirbe to verizon dsl and here is what they sent me; a wireless dsl modem/router (it's actiontec model GT704-WG). So far I haven't got it connected yet. I am still learning, hehe. If I were you, I problaly would stay away from the bluetooth thing. Sounds like a different animal to me.
