<s> Hi, Home network with 2 xp pro sp3 towers and an xp pro sp3 laptop. </s>
<s> Attached to one pc is a printer (via usb port). </s>
<s> Suddenly when the other tower pc prints the output font size is about 1 (everything is shunted up into the top left hand corner of the page). </s>
<s> If the document is emailed to the machine with the printer attached then it prints ok. Any suggestions please? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I'll give that a try </s>
