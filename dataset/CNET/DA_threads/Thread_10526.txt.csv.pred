1.1.1	I have not had any success getting a constant signal with my wireless router in our 3-storey house and am considering Lynksys ' Powerline products , namely the PLE200 .	St
1.1.2	This allows me to run my broadband connection through the house wiring .	St
1.1.3	Lynksys is just re-releasing this product , in an upgraded version , and I 'm wondering if anyone out there has has any good or bad experiences with this type of networking .	St
1.2.1	Most homes have 220V feeds .	St
1.2.2	That means you have 110V on each side and if your upper story plug is on the left of the 220v feed and the lower story is on the right hand feed then your powerline feed might be flaky to non-existent .	St
1.2.3	This is not vendor or model specific but a fact .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	You wo n't have any problem getting a signal on both phases of your 220V house .	St
1.3.2	In fact the signal from HomePlug devices will travel as far as the transformer that feeds your house from the power company ( which might be shared with a few of your neighbors , so be sure to use the software utility include to change the default 128bit AES encryption key from & quot ; HomePlug & quot ; to something unique ) .	St
1.3.3	The Linksys devices work great and use the latest HomePlug AV technology .	St
1.3.4	I Highly recommend them , especially if you plan on doing any streaming of audio or video in your home .	St
1.4.1	I ran into this issue more than once .	St
1.4.2	Linksys , you and others say it should n't be a problem but the instance I moved the malfunctioning unit to another outlet that was on the other side it worked just fine .	St
1.4.3	Real world experiences tend to outweigh what Linksys tells me .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	And this was a Linksys PLE200 device that you were working with ?	Ques
1.5.2	What other devices were on the same circuit ?	Ques
1.6.1	There were 2 units so go figure .	St
1.6.2	While it may be so that it should n't matter what are we to do when it does ?	Ques
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	Was this a few months ago , or years ago ?	Ques
1.7.2	Linksys in their rush to be first when the original HomePlug spec came out a few years back , released some products that had faulty bridging tables that caused devices to stop talking to each other after a while .	St
1.7.3	This happened back around 2001-2002 .	St
1.8.1	I run into powerline hardly ever .	St
1.8.2	So as time passes I just remember the workarounds and do n't see why I should call them on such when I got it working just by a simple change .	St
1.8.3	No other change and we could repeat the move , break it and put it back on the other circuit and it would work .	St
1.8.4	Since it works and that cured the few systems that I saw I have to share what happened and move on .	St
1.8.5	Bob	St
1.9.1	The PLE200 just came out within the last couple of months , so that definately was n't the product that you tried out .	St
1.10.1	I received my PLK200 and PLE200 last week and really gave them a workout over the weekend .	St
1.10.2	I tried them in every obscure location in my house and am extremely happy with the results .	St
1.10.3	No dropped signal ; constant signal strength ; and virtually no hiccups .	St
1.10.4	The set up wizard was extremely easy .	St
1.10.5	Had n't thought about the encryption , so I 'll go back and set that up .	St
1.10.6	The only complaint I have with the units is the ethernet cable that is included is only 3-4 long and barely reached from my router to the wall outlet , so I had to buy some longer cables .	St
