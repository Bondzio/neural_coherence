i used my laptop hooked up to my tv and stereo to catch up on shows i missed last year and it worked well.
i recently picked up a new pc with a nice fast dualcore processor, plenty of ram, a combo hd-dvd/bluray drive, wireless card and a nice size hard drive.
i will still probably use the individual components but if i decide to, i can do anything with the pc.
it is hooked up with 5.1 channel analog out to my stereo and by vga to my 42&quot; toshiba 1080p lcd.
i may upgrade the graphics card but the picture is perfect as is.
i have all my music on the computer and am working on ripping my dvd's as well but it takes time and i am the kind of person who likes to have the disc(cd or dvd) instead of just buying the music or movie online.
