<s> Ok, I'm building my first computer and I was wondering if this is a good build for online gaming and what not, it's not meant to be top of the line stuff. </s>
<s> Motherboard: Intl Desktop Board D915PBL ATX Socket 775 Processor: Intel Pent.4 530J Prescott 800MHz FSB 1MB L2 Cache LGA 775 processor Graphics Card: Radeon X800XL Vid. </s>
<s> Card, PCIe, 256MB DDR. </s>
<s> Any Tips or pointer or problems? </s>
<s> Also, does this configuration work?? </s>
<s> Thanks for help. </s>
<s> Also, what it's the difference between DDR-SDRAM and DDR3-SDRAM? </s>
<s> which is better 256 Mb DDR or 128 Mb DDR3?? </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> Okay my first issue with your config is that you've negated to go with a SLI capable board. </s>
<s> If you're a die hard ATI fan, this sytem will perform well and you'll get good gaming results. </s>
<s> If you're not a die hard ATI fan, you might want to consider a motherboard powered by Nvidia's Nforce 4 SLI Intel edition board. </s>
<s> The PCI-E card you selected has a Nvidia counterpart that would be SLI ready and you could add a second video card at a latter date provided you could locate an identical card (same manufacturer and card model) Another option is to go with a AMD based SLI board ike the rock solid A8N-SLI line of Asus boards. </s>
<s> This chipset supports DDR as oposed to the DDR2 spec on the Intel edition SLI. </s>
<s> Now if stability is your mandate, my opinion is stick with the Intel processor and board. </s>
<s> The difference between ddr and ddr3 is essentially the bandwidth at which it can transfer data. </s>
<s> My question about that is are you refering to what type of memory is on the graphics card? </s>
<s> If so go with the ddr3. </s>
<s> Particularly with a PCI-E spec card. </s>
<s> I'm not even sure if regualr ddr is available on any PCI-E cards and if you were talking about system memory, ddr3 is not available for that configuration, you'd have to use the DDR2 specified for that motherboard. </s>
<s> Another thing to think about is many people don't realize the importance of a quality power supply. </s>
<s> Make sure you have adequate power to run your rig or you'll end up with a whole host of problems you don't want, especially your first build. </s>
<s> I recommend Antec, OCZ, Enermax, or Thermaltake. </s>
<s> Read where the P4 600 series outperformed the 500 and were less expensive. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> AMD is not only cheaper, produces less heat, 64 bit ready, but most of them are in a socket 939 so you can upgrade to an even better AMD processor down the road when you got the money. </s>
<s> No x800XL, get 6800GS. </s>
<s> unaware, you can use DDR3 for computers yet... Get DDR2. </s>
<s> 2x512 sticks. </s>
<s> I'm assuming you have monitor/key board/mouse/speakers/printer. </s>
<s> DOn't forget windows and arctic silver 5 thermal compound, optical drives, case, hard drives, and psu? </s>
<s> AMD 64 3200+ and cheap MSI or Gigabyte motherboard would be alright. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> i assume you're talking about 400mhz ddr2? </s>
<s> i thought AMD's support for ddr2 and speeds above 400mhz was still in the works. </s>
<s> it was before i suggested the amd processor, so if you were getting intel, then that's why i suggested ddr2. </s>
<s> AMDs only support regular DDR right now, get DDR400 PC3200. </s>

<s> Card, PCIe, 256MB DDR.&quot; This is last years equipment. </s>
<s> You really should have some room to upgrade. </s>
<s> I suggest an intel 945 motherboard or an ATI 200 Chipset. </s>
<s> This will allow you to use Dual core chips in the future. </s>
<s> I am personally partial to AMD chips. </s>
<s> You should be able to get a Nvidia Nforce 4 chipset motherboard and an AMD 3500 for the same price. </s>
<s> You would have much better performance and and have the ability to upgrade and overclock. </s>
<s> For a few more $$ you could get an SLI motherboard and a GeForce 6600GT graphics card. </s>
<s> This would alow you to go duual card in the future. </s>
