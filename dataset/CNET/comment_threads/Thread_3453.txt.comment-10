but kinda believe Ozos, John, Nerdyboy, and Damasta are thinking that maybe AMD will come down on the pricing of their Dual-CPU system....say maybe in July?
As of now Newegg is offering the Intel Dual Processor 820 2.9 GHz 1MB L2 cache with heatsink & fan for $313.99.
The 830 GHz 3.0GHz 1MB L2 cache for $409.99 with heatsink & fan.
AMD was supposed to come out with their dual core processor to consumers somewhat higher in price by the end of October, however Monarch is offering the following AMD Dual Processors and expecting June 16th: 4200 - 515k L2 cache per core = $579 without heatsink/fan 4400 - 1MB L2 cache per core = $610 without heatsink/fan 4600 - 512k L2 cache per core = $822 without heatsink/fan 4800 - 1MV L2 cache per core = $999 without heatsink/fan
