thanks.
i've tried that, and i get a data error: cyclic redundancy check.
i don't know what this means, exactly.
nothing happened to the drive physically - it was removed carefully from another computer.
i have used a number of programs that all get this same error message.
maybe i need to attach it back to the motherboard of the old computer?
i am stuck right now.
