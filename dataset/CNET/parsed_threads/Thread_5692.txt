<s> I am in the market for purchasing a new computer. </s>
<s> I am deciding between a desktop which is upgradable or a laptop which is portable. </s>
<s> Now I am a home user however I want to be able to multi-task and be able to play the latest games. </s>
<s> I was considering building a PC but I dont want to bother buying parts and what not. </s>
<s> Can Someone Give me Some Ideas? </s>
<s> If you want a PC for Multi-Tasking, Gaming and possibly the option to upgrade, I would suggest buying off well known computer builders, Such as Mesh, Cube24/7 Etc (UK Companies) Its worth a bit of research into the company if you are just searching it on the internet, but a good idea is to go into a Magazine shop and look in a computing magazine, they normally have double page ads for computer builders. </s>
<s> Hardware Wise - I would look for a Core 2 Duo/Quad, 3GB/4GB/8GB if you want to go all out (DDR2), HDD would be up to you, you would need to know what sort of space you are going to use, 1TB+ Should be fine.. And dont forget to make sure it comes with a keyboard, mouse and screen if you are not going to use your old ones. </s>
<s> Posting links to computer you have spotted would be good aswell, I would be happy to look at them and give you my opinion. </s>
<s> Here is an idea as to what I was looking to buy from Bestbuy.... http://www.bestbuy.com/site//olspage.jsp?id=pcmcat146400050029&type=category OR http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=pcat17080&type=page&qp=crootcategoryid%23%23-1%23%23-1~~cabcat0500000%23%23e%23%231i9~~cabcat0501000%23%235%23%231w~~f681||496e737069726f6e~~q466173746c696d69747067735f3231~~nf558||343030474220616e642061626f7665&list=y&nrp=15&sc=abComputerSP&sp=%2Bbrand+skuid&usc=abcat0500000 </s>
<s> Yeah, most of them are perfect for what you want </s>
<s> So tell me....If I was going to choose one of those systems......What do you think is good for playing games? </s>
<s> Obviously, for gaming you want a higher end processor, better graphics card and more RAM if possible, so possibly.. http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8899766&type=product&id=1212192599038 - Quite expensive, but good aswell and http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=9168198&type=product&id=1218041998312 </s>
