the hp sr1010z is a socket 754 mobo while the emachines t6212 is socket 939. the hp has an 8 x agp slot while the emachine has pci express x 16. the 939 supports dual channel memory while the 754 does not.
i think the emachine t6212 is more advanced than the hp sr1010z though i do not like the ata hdd when it is designed for sata:)
