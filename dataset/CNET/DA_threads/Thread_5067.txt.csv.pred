1.1.1	I have a Goodway BU2240 / 4 port Card Bus card which fits into one of my PCMCIA slots which does n't work anymore .	St
1.1.2	It was working fine .	St
1.1.3	Then I took it out , after I had shut down , to take my PC with me .	St
1.1.4	When I returned I put it back in and booted up .	St
1.1.5	It was dead .	St
1.1.6	I put my 3Com card in the slot to make sure it was n't the slot at fault .	St
1.1.7	I also removed the software and drivers of the card .	St
1.1.8	Put the card in and the system recognized it so I went through the install again .	St
1.1.9	But upon reboot the laptop froze and the card did n't work .	St

1.1.12	I have an IBM 390x laptop , running Win98SE .	St

1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	That would be the easy and expensive way $ $ $ My PC recognizes the card and tries to install it .	St
1.3.2	It works in the lower PCMCIA slot .	St
1.3.3	and my 3 Comm card works in the upper slot where I need to have the Card Bus because of the plug in 's .	St
