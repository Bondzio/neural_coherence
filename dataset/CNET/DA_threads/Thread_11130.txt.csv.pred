1.1.1	Hello everyone, I am building a new system with a MSI 939 socket motherboard and Athlon 64 CPU, 2GB Ram, 256 MB video etc.	St
1.1.2	It will be rather high grade system from what I have owned previously.	St
1.1.3	It was suggested to me to purchase a high grade power supply.	St
1.1.4	The Enermax 660 Watt PSU was recommended.	St
1.1.5	It looks to be a heavy duty unit.	St
1.1.6	What are your thoughts on the Enermax 660 watt PSU?	Polite
1.1.7	Thanks.	St
1.1.8	Greetings from Canada.	St
1.2.1	Hi, I belive that you made a good choice.	Polite
1.2.2	A 660 watt power supply will power all your components and you won't get any power hiccups due to a low watt power supply.	St
1.2.3	Also a high watt power supply will surport newer hardware that demand more power, if you decide to upgrad in the future...	St
1.3.1	I have always recommended the Antec and Enermax psus.	St
1.3.2	They have provided decent service if a good match is found the more wattage the better.	St
1.3.3	However, Enermax also makes I believe the PowerMax series of psus and is trying to leviate those models to a premium level which it maybe, but generally if you have the wattage and build-in cooling most do well.	St
1.3.4	If you like the bells and whistles sorta thing, remember that is usally just that it really do much to cool or maintain a stable output, so look beyond LED lites, dials, and too fancy cabling.	St
1.3.5	I suggest it should have at least 2 fans for best operation, the quieter the better.	Sug
1.3.6	tada -----Willy	St
