trust me, it's not a driver issue.
the problem lies somewhere else in the computer, not your graphics card.
games and other very large applications tend to use a lot of memory, and will crush if you don't have enough ram.
when a gpu overheats, you start seeing artifacts.
it won't prompt the computer to restart immediately.
