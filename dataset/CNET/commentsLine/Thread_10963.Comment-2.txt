a good place to start is looking at the system/app event logs.
especially when the connection was lost.
another step would be to look at the nic to see whether the led's blink plus check the port the pc is plugged into on your switch/router.
when the pc goes offline, is there any activity?
also, does changing the port effect the dropouts?
