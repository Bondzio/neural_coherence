I looked up what i'd get on a $394 budget: -MSI MB w/o video.Has 4 RAM slots,and two PCI-X 16x slots. $49 -AMD Phenom 3-Core 3.0GHz CPU..crap,out of stock for good. $70 -Rosewill Green 700WT power supply w/crossfire . $79 -1GB video card (might grab two) $68 ea -Seagate Barracuda 7200rpm 1000GB H.D. $69 -G.SKILL Ripjaws 4GB DDR3 1600mhz RAM (2 sticks for now) $59 Using my old hardware & operating system,4-bay case,burner,and roms. [NOT buying a 6-core CPU,too much $] $394 COMPLETE.

By posting here or elsewhere, at least they have a chance of someone spotting those errors and helping them avoid an incompatible product or find a compatible or better product for the use intended.

4471	5	508271	5055337	5039662	Noblepuker	12/29/10 8:50 PM	1.2936558E12	yes VAPCMD,your right	I wasn't giving the rookie a hard time....and yes,it's smart to post even the dumbest of questions.The only stupid question is the one not asked. It's easy to misinterpret,or take text out of context...one can sound snotty,or like a 'know it all' when it wasn't intended that way. Your comment is fine,and sounded respectfull....maybe mine sounds snotty,if so,i apologize.

Have seen a variety of	proposed new as well as upgrade configs where the CPU doesn't go with the MB and more often where the RAM is DDR2 and MB only accepts DDR3. Also see a fair number of instances where the PSU doesn't support the HW identified or if it worked...it wouldn't have lasted long. Wonder how the poster's build went ? Happy New Year VAPCMD
