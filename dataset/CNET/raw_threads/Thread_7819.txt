It comes with it's own hub that captures the video and outputs it through A/V ports. I want to plug the A/V chords into my laptop so that I can record the video. A few questions I have is: 1. Do A/V to USB adapters exist that would make sense in this situation? 2. Do A/V to Firewire adapaters exist? 3. What kind of software would I be looking at for recording this on a PC? Mac? 4. Are there any other setups I should consider? For example, can I simply caputre the video from a PC off the network? Thanks for your help!

I'm surprised you were not flooded with options when you went shopping. As to the network, such would a documented feature along with how or else it can't. Bob

Let's say I have some video capture device and it is set up to save one or so many hours in a file, then another and so on. Said file is then &quot;shared&quot; on a network or off the network (your choice.) Seems like you can do this? Again, there are hundreds of video capture cards and even more software. It's like trying to find a dollar hamburger in L.A. Bob
