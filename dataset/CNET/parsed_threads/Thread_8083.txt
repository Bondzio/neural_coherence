<s> I have a Linksys WRT54G Router (works fine with both a hard-wired and a USB Linksys remote-connected desktop PC). </s>
<s> My laptop connects with a DWL-G650 D-Link AirPlus Xtreme G card. </s>
<s> The laptop connection seems to break for a short time every few minutes and then reconnects within a few seconds or a minute max. </s>
<s> The same thing happened at another location, using another Linksys router (same model as mine). </s>
<s> The problem could be my laptop or the D-Link card. </s>
<s> My next step is to buy / borrow a Linksys laptop card to try. </s>
<s> Anybody has any better idea? </s>
<s> Anybody encountered similar compatibility problems? </s>
<s> Thanks for any any help, (ps. </s>
<s> my SMC 801.11b USB connection, which worked fine with the SMC router does not work at all with Linksys. </s>
<s> Is all the G-level compatibility limited to each manufacturer?) </s>
<s> The router's firmware is out of date. </s>
<s> A new router often has out of date firmware. </s>
