I have one in an older computer and it can run halo, counterstrike, ect, and unless your playing batlefield 2 or something you'll be fine. This will also save you some $ on the motherboard, but good call on the asus. stay with that brand. KEY part missing. ram. get 1 gig of fairly fast ram and you should be fine. and finaly you don't need a 3800+ proccessor. a 3200+ will suit your needs perfectly. trust me. i have tested many products, and you'll be fine with these.
