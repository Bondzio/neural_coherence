First thing to check obviously is the jumpers from the power/reset to the motherboard.
Maybe hit it with a little canned air while in there.
That is the easiest solution.
From my experience building them, many power supplies turn on the computer once they are plugged in (unless they have the on/off switch on the back).
Sometimes I've found that you should unplug and replug everything and clean the gold connectors on all the AGP/PCI slots.
Also, if the boot screen isn't coming up at all then that makes me think that either your video card isn't plugged in/working or your system memory (RAM) isn't seated properly.
Those are the things I would check before having to buy a new motherboard.
