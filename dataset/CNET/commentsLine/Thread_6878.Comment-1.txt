last night i upgraded the firmware on the cd-rw/dvd combo drive and now the computer doesn't recognize it.
its dead.
i have a samsung sm-332b combo drive.
the old firmware version was t-408 (from dell).
i downloaded and installed version t-406 from the samsung website.
kaput.
i did a system restore to the previous day with no luck.
how do i get back or get a copy of the old firmware?
it's an older dell dimension running xp sp2.
hey, at least i took some notes.
thanks
