1.1.1	Hi , the rig I 'm building is : Shuttle SN26P 2 x ATI Radeon X850 Platinum Edition 256 PCIE 2 x 1GB Crucial Ballistix Tracer PLEXTOR PX-716SA/SW 1.44 Floppy drive ( then swap in another Plextor ) Windows XP Professional with SP2 I 'm trying to decide between AMD processors .	St
1.1.2	Either the FX60 , or the X2 4800 .	St
1.1.3	Originally I was going to go with the FX55 or FX57 depending on budget , but I 'm going to be doing multitasking which is why I 've added dual core processors to my list , mostly burning CDs , DVDs , playing Video Games , mostly .	St
1.1.4	The X2 4800 and the FX60 actually looked similar , only difference I could find was process speed 2.4 vs 2.6 ghz .	St
1.1.5	Are there other differences , could someone educate me ?	Ques
1.2.1	versus the fx60 which isnt .	St
1.2.2	dual core better for multitasking	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	Again , I 'm trying to decide between the X2 4800 and the FX-60 .	St
1.4.2	Both are dual core , and when looking at specs , except for processor speed 2.4 and 2.6 ghz they appear identical .	St
1.4.3	Could someone explain what the difference is .	St
1.4.4	For clarification , both are Toledo , both are 1.3-1.4volt , both are 90nm , both L1 and L2 Cache are identical , I mean what is the difference ?	Ques
1.4.5	I 'm on the fence , leaning towards X2 only because it 's cheaper .	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	So if I 'm not interested in overclocking , than I should stick with the X2 4800 , also because it 's cheaper ?	Ques
1.7.1	NIL	St
