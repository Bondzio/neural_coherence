1.1.1	Hello, I have a Netgear wgt624v3 wireless router + sb5101.	St
1.1.2	The thing is, I have a desktop that needs to be connected to the internet.	St
1.1.3	Now, the thing I realized is that I don't have a cable outlet where the desktop is placed in.	St
1.1.4	All I have is an ethernet outlet in that room and I am using that outlet for my wireless router.	St
1.1.5	What should I do?	Sug
1.1.6	should I just buy an wireless adaptor for my desktop?	St
1.2.1	sb5101 is a motorola surfboard cable modem by the way - so I don't know what I would do with this thing when there is no cable outlet in the room for the desktop.	St
1.3.1	How are you able to post here and now?	St
1.3.2	And yes, a WIFI card for the desktop sounds like a good idea.	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	I'm using the wireless router for my laptop that has WIFI on it.	St
1.4.2	I am in an apartment unit and when I plug the router in the ethernet jack using an ethernet cable, I get wireless connection for my laptop.	St
