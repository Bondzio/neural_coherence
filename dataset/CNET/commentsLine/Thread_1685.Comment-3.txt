well the laptop's wifi is ok with most every other wifi signal source, it just won't connect up with my own wifi router.
it's even weirder because my other desktop can link up with my router (i am certain as it has a unique name), and i can see the router's name in the laptop's wireless connections list but there is no data getting sent/received between these 2 pieces of hardware, both of which seem to work and play well with everyone else.
i just can;t figure this out.
i like the faster wired connection but would be nice to be untethered once in a while.
thanks - jl
