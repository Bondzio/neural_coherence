first off, apologies if this was already asked.
i searched the forum, but found no solution to my particular problem.
i'm having problems detecting my hard drive.
now, what i did: got a new 160gig hd (my slave, d: ) and installed it.
i was able to format (via: admintools &gt; comp mgmt &gt; disk mgmt) it and put some data onto it.
i formatted and reinstalled winxp pro onto my master hd.
both were formated as ntfs.
no problem.
now, when i went to mycomputer, my d: didn't show up.
i checked the jumpers, the bios and device manager, they all say the hd shows up/is running okay.
went back to the diskmgmt screen and the hd is innactive.
right clicking on it prompts me to change it to a basic volume (which would delete everything) in order to use it - which i obviously can't do since i have some data i need on it.
what can i do to view the drive??
?
