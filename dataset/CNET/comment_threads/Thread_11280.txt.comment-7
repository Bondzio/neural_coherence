If you have recently upgraded to SP2, there was an issue with some drivers.
Oak Technologies has a driver that will fix that problem, and it is a universal driver.
If that doesn't help, I am clueless.
If you have NEVER had a successful burn with the new burner,,,take it back and get another one.
Once in great while, you get a bad one.
In the mean time, use a CDRW, and just reformat it if the burn goes bad.
