1.1.1	I have a Quantum Fireball HD from a Dell optiflex GX 1000 .	St
1.1.2	The drive had Win 98 .	St
1.1.3	The drive no longer boots up the PC .	St
1.1.4	It was used as a slave drive in a Gateway running Win XP Pro for about a year .	St
1.1.5	Now it no longer is recognized in the donor machine as a slave .	St
1.1.6	I need the name of a data recovery company that can recover the data from this HD .	St
1.1.7	Any recommendations ?	Ques
1.2.1	Check out Actionfront and DTI .	St
1.2.2	I have heard good things about both ( though never used them ) , and they both charge you only upon successful recovery of your data .	St
1.2.3	Their pricing is on a per-case basis , but expect to pay $ 500- $ 4,000 depending on what the problem is .	St
1.2.4	In the future , only one word should be going through your mind every weekend ... BACKUP .	St
1.2.5	Hope this helps , John	St
