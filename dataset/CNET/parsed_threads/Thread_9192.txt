<s> This summer, I bought an Inspiron 6000 from Dell. </s>
<s> It has 512 RAM and a 64 mb graphics card. </s>
<s> I was wondering, can I get a graphics card if I need to sometime in the future? </s>
<s> I am fairly confident that your motherboard will not take a new GPU. </s>
<s> I'm sorry. </s>
<s> Few laptops can have an upgraded GPU. </s>
<s> Could your run Belarc Advisor for me to make sure? </s>
<s> Maybe you can... Look under video adapters. </s>
<s> Does it say anything about PCI-e or AGP or something? </s>
<s> ~Ibrahim~ </s>
<s> If you can, Dell would know and have the right video card. </s>
<s> I didn't see anything like that, and I searched the page for PCI-e and AGP but nothing came up. </s>
<s> How do I find out? </s>
<s> There was an option of a bigger 128 mb card, but I didn't go for it when I bought the machine. </s>
<s> Not all laptops have upgradable cards. </s>
<s> Dell should tell you with just one call. </s>
