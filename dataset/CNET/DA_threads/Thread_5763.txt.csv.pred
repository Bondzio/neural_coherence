1.1.3	I primarily use the PC for browsing and also some software I have installed .	St
1.1.4	Since I plan to buy a new computer in the next 2 Years , I want to spend a little money on this to upgrade it .	St
1.1.5	My thought is just to upgrade thr hardisk to some 20GB .	St
1.1.6	What kind of Hard drive would be suitable for my PC ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.7	Can I get a used one ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.8	Can anyone suggest any brand , specs ? ?	Ques
1.1.9	?	Ques
1.2.1	Maybe you should n't do this ?	Ques
1.2.2	In 2 years , the landscape will look quite different and the used market will have nice things as well .	St
1.2.3	It 's basically worthless except for those who can use such .	St
1.2.4	My best advice is to keep your money away from this machine .	Polite
1.2.5	The issue with the hard disk was answered in your prior post .	St
1.2.6	20GB drives are rare now .	St
1.2.7	And the used market may or may not be such a deal since it 's all over the map .	St
1.2.8	Let 's see , if you go and find that 80GB drive for 50USD you may want to offer less than 20 bucks for that 20GB drive .	St
1.2.9	Nobody I know has those .	St
1.2.10	Bob	St
1.3.1	Will my machine support a 40GB or a higher Hardisk	St
1.4.1	If you had such at a shop , they could try it , but given the age of the machine , a waiver would be signed first that any and all problems with said machine , repairs and such are your responsibility .	St
1.4.2	I 've seen such aged machine simple go up in one last puff of smoke when & quot ; tech & quot ; tried to fit a drive or card into such .	St
1.4.3	Its best to know that opening such a machine is dangerous .	St

1.5.1	Hi .	St
1.5.2	I have a rather old desktop at home too .	St
1.5.3	The specs are : Intel Pentium III 533 MHz ( Slot 1 ) DFI PA-61 Motherboard ( VIA 693/596 ( PC-133 ) ) 512 MB PC-133 SDRAM S3 ProSavage3D 8MB 10 GB HDD Windows ME Well , I 'm planning to upgrade the computer in terms of changing the video card to maybe a NVidia GeForce 2 or ATI Radeon 7500 ( or something like that , not too expensive , but reasonable performance ) , and also the hard disk to 40 GB ( because I need more space , plus the present hard disk is 3 years old already , I want to change it before it dies ) .	St
1.5.4	Besides my above upgrades , are there any other upgrades recommended ?	Ques
1.5.5	And , based on my current system , would you advise against me using Windows XP ?	Ques
1.5.6	Thanks !	St
1.6.1	Let me comment : 1 .	St
1.6.2	Hard disk .	St
1.6.3	I picked up some 40GB 7200 RPM 2MB cache unit for a paltry $ 29.99 new ( after rebates . )	St
1.6.4	This is a cheap boost and very likely will install without a hitch on your PC .	St
1.6.5	2 .	St
1.6.6	Video card .	St
1.6.7	May or may not pay off .	St
1.6.8	The MX series is a value item much like what the 7500 is and may give you no boost at all .	St
1.6.9	Besides , video performance is closely tied to the CPU and you may not see enough of a gain .	St
1.6.10	If you move to the 9000 series or the Geforce 4 or higher , then that 's about it and is well above the current video display .	St
1.6.11	Best of luck , Bob	Polite
1.7.1	Thanks Robert !	St
1.7.2	And thanks for the luck !	Polite
1.8.1	You may want to check the specs for XP , i cant remember them off the top of my head , but i do know that it does take a fair amount of system rescources compared to something like win98se or winME also , you may wanto contact DFI and check on what kind of AGP slot you have before going out and buying a new video card , if its 8x your fine , if its 4x so-so if its 2x i dont know how much more you could upgrade , maybe a few 32mb cards , if the s3 is integrated you have to disable it to use the new video card .	St
1.8.2	unless windows catches on and does that all of the parts u need can be found at various locations on and off the web .	St
