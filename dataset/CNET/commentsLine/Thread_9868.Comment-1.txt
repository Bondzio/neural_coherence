hi, my set up: 550w psu - new mobo - gigabyte 7n400 pro 2 - new 3 x 256ddr amd xp1800 i have just bought a new mobo (gigabyte 7n400 pro 2) and am trying to rebuild my pc.
i have installed the minimum - mobo, floppy, 1 stick of ram, video and the processor.
when i powered on the psu, ram led, and the cpu fan all came on.
but i got no beeps and no signal to the monitor at all.
so i removed the cpu and powered on - still no beeps, then i removed the floppy - still no beeps.
i do not want to belive that this motherboard is dead - its new.
is there any way i can test the cpu?
my old mobo died and took my old psu with it - could it have killed the cpu as well?
please help!!
thanks cat
