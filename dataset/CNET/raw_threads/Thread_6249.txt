I rebooted, and several minutes later it happened again. I booted down and vacuumed everything out. I made sure my CPU was locked in place 'cause my computer shuts off if it isn't. When I tried to boot back up, it shut down in a few seconds. And again and again. Sometimes it will boot for up to thirty seconds but then shuts off. Video, mouse, keyboard don't work. No beeps when it stays on for more than a few seconds. I took out everything but one stick of RAM, the CPU, PS, and motherboard. Immediately shut off. When I put my GPU in, it stayed on for about fifteen seconds the shut off. Still no video. Specs: OCZ GameXStream 700w PSU nVidia Geforce 8600GTS Seagate 320GB SATA HD nForce 650i Ultra chipset Four 1GB 800Mz RAM Core 2 Duo E6750 2.66GHz CPU Nothing is overclocked.

If that falls off and you just stick it back on then voids in the heat sink compound may form. Fix? Add a little more compound and hope that's it. Bob

It got loose about a year ago when I was cleaning it out, but since then I haven't had any problems. I suppose if that's not the problem it's like the power supply? I assume CPU's are much more robust.

If you can't put ONE DOLLAR of heatsink compound in to remove this from the suspect list or want to discuss heatsink compound and how it should dry out or need more then I must move on. This is a simple thing, easy, cheap and something I encounter weekly. Try that! Bob

13307	5	380924	3236494	3236505	R. Proffitt	1/31/10 2:18 PM	1.26494748E12	Good!	But the 8600GTS is my next suspect. The 8400 and 8600 chips are dieing all over. Beg, borrow any other card for a test run. And for now, leave the case cover off till it gets better. Bob
13307	6	380924	3236509	3236494	AwTin	1/31/10 2:30 PM	1.2649482E12	GPU	Shouldn't I be able to hear beeps after booting even without a GPU?
13307	7	380924	3236512	3236494	AwTin	1/31/10 2:42 PM	1.26494892E12	Time	Also, if I let it sit for a while, it will stay on for about thirty seconds, albeit still with no video or anything. Each time I boot after that, the amount of time it stays on gets shorter.
13307	8	380924	3236550	3236512	R. Proffitt	1/31/10 4:14 PM	1.26495444E12	Sounds like a heat issue.	Find each heat sink to clean off. And you have compound, drop a little on each and hope you find it. Otherwise we get to replace parts till you find it. Bob

Read http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-11319_7-6240575-1.html The nVidia Geforce 8600GTS possible failure -&gt; Haven't read if another card was tried. This and the 8400 dropping like flies out there. OTHER Heatsinks and Compound -&gt; I'd do that! Bob

Did you try reseting the BIOS by removing the battery for 15 mins? This may sound odd in this case but never know, bad BIOS settings can also cause this. If still no go then it must be the PSU or MOBO(motherboard) itself a cause of problem.
13307	13	380924	3241103	3240966	ebbtides	2/6/10 9:22 AM	1.26544812E12	Bad &quot;BIOS&quot;?	Bad BIOS is NOT likely to be your problem unless you made changes to it since your problems first started. If BIOS worked before (and no settings have been changed since then), then it is not a suspect. DO NOT remove your BIOS battery without FIRST BACKING-UP YOUR CURRENT BIOS SETTINGS!!!!!

13307	16	380924	3243190	3242409	MrNittyGritty	2/9/10 1:25 AM	1.2656787E12	Shutdowns Possible Solution	I would investigate the BIOS settings. I have experienced spontaneous changes in BIOS settings on a few computers. Most computers of recent vintage have temperature monitoring circuitry. The BIOS settings allow you to select a preselected temperature to execute an automatic shutdown. I would increase the temperature indicated to see if there is any change in the shutdown time. If the computer remains up longer I would suspect either a faulty sensor or faulty component. You can also disable the temperature sensing / shutdown option. Good luck
