My DVD drive is an LG GWA-4164B HH 16X DVD+/-RW in a Dell Dimension 9150 system. I first enountered the problem trying to burn a DVD. The burner would spin/stop/repeat and not recognize the discs. I don't have the problem with any other type of disc (CD or DVD +/- R). The DVD drive is updated with the latest firmware. I am running Vista 32-bit (Home) with the latest updates. My burning software is Nero 7.7.5.1. Other system specs are 2 Gb RAM, Dual Core 2.8 GHz. Any suggestions? As far as I know, Nero 7 is Vista compatible, and burns any other disc just fine. Thanks!
