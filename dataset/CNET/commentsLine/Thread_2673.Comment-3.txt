your power isn't too stable, replace it.
while 450w is pretty good enough, each leg of power can be lagging, so now is a good time to replace before it starts to stress componets.
plus, a top-notch agp video card is very demanding and if you're wanting hi-end output the system starts to lag as well, perforamnce wise.
decent generic psus are in the 500w range and namebrand if 400w are stable.
heck, some users are putting in 600w in order not to worry about power.
an atx tester only checks for presence of power not necisarrily if clean&stable output, so its only good to say, good/bad power present if undeterminable.
however, power should flucate with 5%(good) and 10% now and then and now always.
a good ac line conditioner can help too as an extra measure.
