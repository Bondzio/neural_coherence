<s> I was wondering if any one would be able to help me: I recently bought a new MOBO: GIGABYTE GA-7N400 PRO2. </s>
<s> I also bought a new case (which is no probs), a new power supply: Q-TEC 450W, new RAM: Kingston 512MB DDR Pc3200, and a new processor: AMD 3200+. </s>
<s> I kept my old graphics card: Nvidia 64MB Ti-4200. </s>
<s> I connected all the items to the MOBO and did what it said in quick set up, but when I turn the computer on it doesnt even do a P.O.S.T, no bios beeps nothing, all the fans come on but nothing else no monitor response nothing. </s>
<s> I just wondered if someone could help me!!! </s>
<s> THANK YOU </s>
<s> The motherboard was shipped with the CMOS clear jumpered to &quot;clear&quot; and it won't boot. </s>
<s> Another motherboard had a documentation error and the HD LED was connected (in the manual) to the RESET connection. </s>
<s> Again, no boot. </s>
<s> Think over what you would do in each case. </s>

<s> I have had the 7N400 PRO2 for several months, running fine. </s>
<s> Used @BIOS utility to update the BIOS this past Friday and now have the same problem you describe. </s>
<s> So much for the Dual BIOS feature. </s>
<s> I tried the CMOS reset and that is about it. </s>
<s> I have an email in to tech support at Gigabyte. </s>
<s> Never needed to ask them a question before so I am not sure how fast they are to respond. </s>
