<s> We are a two person non-profit office needing to get new hardware. </s>
<s> We were going to buy towers and a server but I am hearing conflicting info about what we really need. </s>
<s> I am not sure we want to host our emails, fire wall and domain because I now nada about that so if something failed I would have to call someone for support. </s>
<s> So now I am doing research on NAS and file servers. </s>
<s> We do all of our website maintenance, collateral material and artwork. </s>
<s> We don't necessarily need to access (MS Exchange) our computers away from the office (other software out there than can do that). </s>
<s> Can someone tell me the pros and cons of server vs NAS for a small business? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> No 2 person office I know runs a server or even a NAS. </s>
<s> What for? </s>
<s> As to email you can do like most and use some gmail account while on the road. </s>

<s> If you growth rate or needs are simple, then keep the system simple. </s>
<s> The NAS will do what you want. </s>
<s> However, you limited in expansion, up to a point. </s>
<s> Any decent system can have the NAS added, as for any true server needs, then you must look at the whole system to match what you want to do. </s>
<s> You can look at some outside network service and allow them to host you and your cause. </s>
<s> That way, the expertise is on their end and all you provide is the content. </s>
<s> Of course this costs, but it doesn't hurt to see what it involves. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Thank you R. and Willy. </s>
<s> I appreciate your advice. </s>
<s> You referred to Exchange Server. </s>
<s> Do you have one? </s>
