a beta 1 (test) version of longhorn is slated for release this june primarily aimed at developers.
others who have a 2nd computer to risk playing with the beta version will probably go for the test.
the final version of longhorn is slated for the second half of next year.
please provide a link (url) on what you heard instead of spreading or starting a rumor.
microsoft has a beta antispyware program out now that has nothing but good reviews.
of course this beta version is safe as it is basically the antispyware program of a company that microsoft recently purchased, and want others to check it out.
