<s> I am looking for a way to get voice through my computer to my telephone. </s>
<s> I do not have VOIP. </s>
<s> Perhaps this is very basic, but I cannot seem to find a way to use a bluetooth head set with my desktop and outlook to dial and then speak on the telephone wirelessly. </s>
<s> I have vista ultimate, blue tooth headset, usb modem, and office professional 2007. </s>
<s> If not bluetooth, is there another wireless headset that you know of that you would recommend? </s>
<s> Thanks, Allen </s>
<s> Look in to Skype. </s>
<s> Phil, Thanks, I checked it out, but I am not looking for another carrier. </s>
<s> I have unlimited telephone service with comcast digital voice. </s>
<s> I just want to connect using outlook to dial and pick up the call on a bluetooth (or other wireless) headset. </s>
<s> Allen </s>
<s> Bluetooth phone, bluetooth capable PC or L/T and phone server software. </s>
