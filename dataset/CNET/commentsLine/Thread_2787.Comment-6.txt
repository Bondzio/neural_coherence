i have had the same problem w/ my e521 ever since i got it.
however, when i got mine, i immediately did a clean install of xp pro sp2.
so it has none of dell's preinstalled software or vista.
there is a link on dell's support site that makes reference to a bios issue w/ the e521.
that may be helpful.
