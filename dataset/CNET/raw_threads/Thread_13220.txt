Hi, I have a custom built pc with P5n32 SLI deluxe motherboard,3ghz dual core, 2gb ram, 256mb BFG 6800 ultra graphics card. My computer has been acting a little strange lately. Whenever i switch it on, the display doesnt come up. to counter this i plug out the battery of the motheerboard and restart the computer again and it works fine afterward. The same problem occurs again after a few days. can someone explain me the problem?
