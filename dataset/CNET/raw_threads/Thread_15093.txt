Just so you know I picked up the usual Acer Aspire One and it's fine. Mine runs XP and all I had to to was turn the wifi on. Bob

The more walls between, the faster it drops signal (more so if the wall has steel bars for structure) 3) Height of placement is also important. Placing too low on the floor also can affect, likewise placing too high up. 4) Power saving set on your wireless adapter and router.
