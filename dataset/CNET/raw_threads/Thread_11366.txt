(hardware idea)	I want to see a wireless terminal that allows you to remote into your home computer and looks/acts like a big iPhone. Hardware would include a 13 inch touchscreen, an 'N' network card, a small video card, and a battery. The whole thing would remote into your home computer (or someone elses) and you could bring up a transparent keyboard on the screen with a screen gesture (terminology?). Battery life would be stellar! And realistically this shouldn't cost more than $250

I think they could gain a big foothold if they were done 'right': 1. have it look like this http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/21/we-want-a-dead-simple-web-tablet-help-us-build-it/comment-page-10/ 2. include two modes: a remote desktop+usb for high bandwidth availability and a browser only functionality for low bandwidth 3. make it a little rugged and water proof. without a keyboard, it would be easy. then you could use it at home, away, or in the shower thanks again!
