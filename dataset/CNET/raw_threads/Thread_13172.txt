I am not willing to install an internal hard drive into my computer that is becoming dated. I figured a 2TB Fantom GF2000EU ought to do. Am I missing something here or is this the correct solution?

Many go for such and STORE files but forget backups. Also, video editing on USB drives usually takes all the fun out of editing. See http://img.trustcollective.com/tool/comcast-wagon2.jpg Bob

I use SyncBack. http://download.cnet.com/SyncBack-Freeware/3000-2242_4-10413802.html Here's another jpeg about video editing on USB drives -&gt; http://www.multichannel.com/photo/77/77811-lavahome.jpg Sony Vegas is always a favorite in the forums.
