hey again, i tried the cardboard and everything.
nothing is working.
i think i am just going to have to buy a new combo.
i will tell you this, however, when i first took the heatsink off, the cpu was practically glued to the back of the heatsink.
in other words, i didnt have to undo the latch to take the cpu out, it came out when the cpu came off.
do you think this could have done something to the cpu or the &quot;cpu holder&quot; on the mother board?
is there anyway to test the cpu to see if it is still ok?
thanks
