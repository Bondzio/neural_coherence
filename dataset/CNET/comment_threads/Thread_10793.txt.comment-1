i have a 100mbs LAN crossover network on the 192.168.0.0 IP on windows XP Pro but i want to share the internet but no such luck im on BTYahoo Broadband (ADSL) and i want to introduce the PC upstais to WWW both systems a running XP Pro SP2 and both have the same network cards in (cheap 5.99 realtech's) but still no internet i have used the wizard countless times and i just get &quot;page can not be displayed&quot; the little tick box for IE options for LAN is ticked but just goes &quot;No im not going to work&quot; i wouldnt mind paying for a router but i need an ADSL one which are expensive (needs to be 4 port) and i dont eally want to throw more money at this.
I would use this machine as a proxy but.. i have no idea how to config the pc to do it (thats new to me) any help anyone?
