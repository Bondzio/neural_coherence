1.1.1	Hi all .	St
1.1.2	This is my first post so bear with me if I do n't know all rules I have a web server with public IP that is connected to internal network .	St
1.1.3	I would like to display content from my networked machine .	St
1.1.4	The network machine ca n't be accessed from internet and I want to keep it that way .	St
1.1.5	( it can go to web though ) .	St
1.1.6	Web server is Ubuntu server so I get the part of working it out with ip tables .	St
1.1.7	I want to display content from internal nw machine but so it can only be seen through web server .	St
1.1.8	( it should be re-rendered on web server with some technology or application ) .	St
1.1.9	To recap : show content from nw pc on web server and only visible when looking on web server , other direct connections prevented .	St
1.1.10	Thank you , Mario	St
1.2.1	What stopped you ?	Ques
1.2.2	While you were not clear about the setup or what is to be displayed and how , you did n't reveal your plan or design .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I have an html web app in & quot ; internal & quot ; network .	St
1.3.2	I want to display it 's content on web server and web server only .	St
1.3.3	Is there some solution that would present my web app from internal network on my public web server , and not open it so that anyone that can look into source open it directly .	St
1.3.4	If I access it via iframe , that would mean , it can be accessed from outside .	St
1.3.5	is there a solution that would serve as a gateway but close any connections to network machine outside the network ?	Ques
1.3.6	Thanks , Mario	St
1.4.1	You wrote & quot ; not open it so that anyone that can look into source & quot ; .	St
1.4.2	That 's a little muddy but for years folk have danced around and lost far too much time over trying to hide or obfuscate source in HTML .	St
1.4.3	Sorry but it 's right there in all the web browsers I use if I view source .	St
1.4.4	The source code is in the clear .	St
1.4.5	It 's a shame that the real goal seems hidden here .	St
1.4.6	Sometimes folk try to avoid revealing they want access to the files on that PC .	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	Install the usual remote access software ( gotomypc , VNC ) and network , password , secure as needed .	St
1.5.2	As presented it 's a mess .	St
1.5.3	I ca n't tell what & quot ; content & quot ; is .	St
1.5.4	It could be some HTML pages , maybe it 's the usual & quot ; I want to access my PC from home & quot ; or something else .	St
1.5.5	What 's clear so far is that the solution is not going to happen given the current skill set .	St
1.5.6	Bob	St
1.6.1	I have an amazon instance that has public IP eg : 10.25.251.38 and is also connected to internal network ( 10.1.50.xxx ) with bunch of other amazon instances running ubuntu that have a BI Web Application installed .	St
1.6.2	They are also on the same internal network different subnet ( 10.1.51.xxx ) .	St
1.6.3	I can start and stop those instances from web server ( 10.25.251.38 ) using amazon aws sdk .	St
1.6.4	Now the tricky part : I also want to load those instances up directly in same web server .	St
1.6.5	Best course of action would be to use in Iframe , but then users can easily see the address where iframe is pointing to and I want to force users to use my web app only .	St
1.6.6	I agree with Bob on the subject of openness vs closeness of html , but in this particular case , I would prefer to limit access as much as possible to internal network .	St
1.6.7	Hope this clarifies the question and results in an awesome response Thank you guys , Mario	St
