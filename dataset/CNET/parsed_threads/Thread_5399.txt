<s> I am running Win95 (yes I know but can't afford to upgrade) and have been trying to add on a HP 5100C scanner. </s>
<s> I have tried SEVERAL times to load the software (from the CD) and according to HP an icon in the tray shows an X across it means that the drivers are unable to communicate with the scanner. </s>
<s> I have disconnected and reconnected the scanner several tmes and still nothing. </s>
<s> BTW I am usng a paraell port and have a Cannon printer connected to the scanner and I am able to print via this connection. </s>
