they just said they'll give the refund which is $177 less than what i paid since shipping fees totaled up to that amount and they didn't have to if they just built the computer the way it's supposed to be built.
now i, the customer, have to pay extra for their mistakes.
they just received it today according to the fed ex tracking site but i don't expect to see a credit on my credit card til i've completely waited myself to death.
