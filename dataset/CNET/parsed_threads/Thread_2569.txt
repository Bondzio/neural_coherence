<s> A frien d is letting me use his card, it is a nVidia nd it is a 64MB but not sure what else, how do I find the specs and how do I overclock it? </s>
<s> Thanks, </s>
<s> I have never done this, but you can to give it a try. </s>

<s> Even w/o O/C'ing, video issues are a problem should they arise. </s>
<s> All too often the makers themselves have done alot to give the best performance and more importantly, &quot;stability&quot;. </s>
<s> O/C'ing will increase unstability and really the reward isn't that much plus you may damage the video chipset or vram. </s>
<s> The other poster gave some links, follow them. </s>
<s> Google for overclocker type websites for details, though. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
