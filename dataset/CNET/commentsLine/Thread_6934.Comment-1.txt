first off, i own a gateway gt4016 desktop computer.
on the front there's a little panel thing in one of the slots like where the dvd drive is fixed that has a usb connection and two slots labeled &quot;sd/mmc/sm/ms/ms-pro/xd&quot; and &quot;cf/microdrive&quot;.
i, being the genius that i am, inserted my cf card from my camera into the cf drive, but i think i did it backwards.
it wasn't reading and didn't click or anything, so i got tweezers to try to pull it out, but that just pushed it in more and now i can't even try to pull it out from the front.
it doesn't read on my computer and whenever i try to open the drive called &quot;compactflashi/ii (h:)&quot; it says i need to insert a disk.
if i click eject, it does nothing.
my question is, how do i go about getting my card back out?
any help would be appreciated!
thanks!
