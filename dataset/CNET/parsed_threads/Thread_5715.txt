<s> My computer one day decided not to boot. </s>
<s> It hangs right after the bad quality bitmap &quot;loading windows 2000&quot; screen and instead of jumping to a login prompt just sits at a blank screen. </s>
<s> To make a long story short, I ran three versions of the manufacturers utility and none of them found bad sectors on the drive. </s>
<s> So when i dropped the drive into a working windows 2000 box and tried to chkdsk it says the following... C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator&gt;chkdsk H: The type of the file system is NTFS. </s>
<s> Unable to determine volume version and state. </s>
<s> CHKDSK aborted. </s>
<s> What can I do to fix this? </s>
<s> I've searched high and low and well I haven't been able to find much of anything. </s>
<s> :*( </s>
<s> If damage is too severe, you try other tools like Norton Disk Doctor and in the end a wipe and restore from backup. </s>
<s> New users are now demanding functionality that has not been included or even thought of. </s>
<s> Let me be blunt that PCs are not appliances. </s>

<s> I am getting the same CHKDSK error message. </s>
<s> My problem is that the output (the error message) was coded by Micro$oft, so they know what conditions precipitate it. </s>
<s> For example, it may mean that the MFT is hopeless corrupt or missing. </s>
<s> Why has M$ not documented the error message of their own utility? </s>
<s> &gt;New users are now demanding functionality that has &gt;not been included or even thought of. </s>
<s> Kinda bogus reply, don't ya think? </s>
<s> Obviously the functionality demanded is to fix a corrupt volume. </s>
<s> And M$ has thought to include the utility for many years - it's just an issue of documenting the error output. </s>

<s> or do we want to tackle your issue? </s>
<s> You first. </s>
