If I am reading the information on this correctly, it appears that the software needs to be loaded on the targeted machine.
Also as noted in a article on ZDNET &quot;Reality check time.
Even a 100x speed increase isnt all that remarkable.
If youre using sub 6 to 8 character passwords/passphrases, and youre leaving them in place for months (or years) at a time then you need to be worried.
If youre using long pre-shared keys consisting of uppercase, lowercase, digits and common punctuation, youre still very safe.
For example, a 15 character password made up of uppercase, lowercase, digits and common punctuation is highly resistant to a brute-force attack.
Even at the rate of 100,000,000 password attempts a second, cracking that could take 3.5 x 1012 years.&quot; As before, weak passphrases are what are vulnerable.
If you use a 64 digit hex as your PSK, you're going to be pretty secure, and of course WPA2-Enterprise is not at all vulnerable.
