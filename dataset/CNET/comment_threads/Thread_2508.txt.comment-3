and/or the os needs a fresh install.
personally, i'd reset the bios to default settings and install win7 from scratch.
btw... that's not a high end pc.
phenom 9850 cpu is 2 years old... ditto for radeon hd4850s.
these were nice midrange components in 2008, but have been superseded by new generations (phenom x4 ii 900s and radeon hd5800s) and are definitely behind the curve now.
if you can, you should consider returning the pc.
