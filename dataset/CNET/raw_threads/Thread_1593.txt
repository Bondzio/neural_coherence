I was going to buy a Dell, but a friend told me about Cyber Power Inc, however their reviews suck. I've also check Ibuypower.com and Monarch computers, which is the best website to buy a decent computer from? Thanks for any help, this is driving me crazy Coreth5

Is this a general question or can you narrow it to a specific purpose? gaming, business, programming, CAD, video editing, graphic design, desktop publishing, media center, general use, limited use (writing & browsing), etc.

For what it's worth, I personally suspect Monarch is better, but ibuypower is cheaper, so I don't know. If you hear anything, let me know Coreth5

I was a long-time customer, and had great luck with them prior to the last year... I bought a high-end notebook and workstation from them about a year ago... The notebook died within months of purchase... needing a bios and hard drive replacement. The workstation experienced motherboard failure almost immediately (related to a faulty USB port that seems to be endemic to the ASUS motherboard that was shipped with the unit). To their credit, they replaced the computer... but its now a year later, and the computer went up in smoke yet again! The company is dragging its feet with repairs (the thing croaked over a week ago).... needless to say they won't replace the computer (even though it is abundantly clear that the product is defective). In the past year, the computer has been non-functional for over a month! The company is utterly unapologetic, and utterly unresponsive to repair requests. I heard a rumor that they are going under... is their any truth to this?

I got an ABS from 2000 and never had any problems with it. It even came with a 20 ich CRT which works to this day, but I replaced it with a 19 inch LCD. The system had a P3, and worked fine until a coupke of months ago when I got broadband, and the whole system was infected with spyware. That was my fault for not having anything to protect it. The system works great, but I replaced it because I needed a more current computer. I even have 2 removable hard drives on it. I find ABS to be great PC builders.
