<s> Hi, i have installed seagate 3tb, and want to use only this with my p8p57 motherboard, problem is that when i format with mbr i get 2tb space, how do i get access to 700gb rest space? </s>
<s> if i install with windows disk management tool i get whole 3tb, but its guid and windows installation on primary dirve doesnt support that only mbr support that, so whats the solution please? </s>
<s> thx </s>
<s> mbr actually occupy very little space. </s>
<s> How did you partition the harddrive? </s>
<s> Personally I probably would use 1Gb. </s>
<s> for the primary partition and 2Gb. </s>
<s> for the extended partition, in which you can form 1 or 2 logical drive, whichever you choose. </s>
<s> Try that to see if that would work. </s>
