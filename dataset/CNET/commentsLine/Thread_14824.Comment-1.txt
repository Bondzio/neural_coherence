so i ordered the sound blaster audigy 2 to replace my onboard realtek ac97.
my question is, can i just uninstall it from my device manager??.....
because i heard you had to do it through the bios which is something i've never tinkered with.
also, if i uninstall it through device manager, will it kep trying to reinstall itself through windows detecting it?
thanks for any help
