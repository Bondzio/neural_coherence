i am switching from a pc to a mac and am somewhat unfamiliar with the inner workings of macs.
i am going to order an imac g5 (2.0 ghz) next week.
i intend on ordering 1gig of ram and was thinking of ordering a single one gig dimm (so i could upgrade later without wasting memory).
but i have seen some comments posted around the web arguing that the imac may run faster with matching pairs (i.e.
2 512 mb memory sticks are better than one 1 gb).
i was wondering what you guys, who are obviously more experienced with macs that i, think.
any thoughts.
