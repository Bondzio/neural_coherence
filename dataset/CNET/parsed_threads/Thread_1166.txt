<s> My Dad's PC is driving me (and him) absolutey mad.It's a Gigabyte GA71XE-4 with a Atlon Thunderbird (850) and 576MB RAM. </s>
<s> It also has a Hercules Prophet 8500LE, A 20GB Maxtor and it's in A modded case. </s>
<s> Basically everytime the PC is booted up, it crashes on the XP splash screen, I think it's at the Hardware detection part (Where the optical mouse and keyboard flash). </s>
<s> It used to require turn off from the plug, and after restart would load windows normally, but now it does it twice, allways following the Same pattern, I have tried re-installing windows many times but to no avail, what shall I do, Most parts of the PC are 5+ Years old so I would not be suprised if something is not working, But what? </s>

<s> The power supplies had to be updated. </s>
<s> An aging supply could be the cause. </s>
<s> Since it's under the 1GHz mark, any 350 Watt supply will do. </s>
<s> Could be under 20 bucks to remove this from the issues list. </s>

<s> Open the case and look and clean out. </s>
<s> Bad capacitors, the large ones located in the vicinity of the CPU, look for puffed up ones or leaky goo around the bottom of the caps. </s>
<s> The vintage of your machine is a candidate for this one. </s>
<s> Power Supply going bad. </s>
<s> No, It can't be any of these things, i have tried several PSU's, and the current is for a Pentium 4, so there should be no problems there, and the case has 4 Case fans and a better than stock Fan/heasink, so my CPU is only 40oc, I was given an Idea about Hard disk rotation speed, any more ideas? </s>
<s> No leaks capacitors e.t.c </s>
<s> The Athlon 800 is well known to me and you never revealed the models of power supplies you fitted. </s>
<s> My bet is they were all 300 or less Watts. </s>
<s> In closing, you need to run this memory test. </s>
<s> http://www.memtest86.com What failures do you find? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> psions Along with the other suggestions. </s>
<s> More than one memory chip? </s>
<s> Run Memory test provided and reduce to one chip. </s>
<s> Un-plug all devices and remove cards. </s>
<s> Check BIOS for up-date. </s>
<s> Run Mnf diagonstic on HDD. </s>
<s> &quot;I have tried re-installing windows many times but to no avail, what shall I do,&quot; you can do this till the cows come home... won't do you any good till the bad hardware is found. </s>

<s> have two separate 12 Volt rails one is wasted ]so is its power capacity] in that system because the mobo regulators get fed from 3.3 volts. </s>
<s> There's no place to plug in the 4 pin 12 volt connector. </s>
<s> I will have to wait till I am back at my parent huse then I will do the memory test, and post the results. </s>
<s> Ran into a Problem, His PC doesen't have a Floppy drive, I never really thought it would ever be needed, the age of the floppy is over really, though some may disagree, are there any other programs/alternatives to Memtest 86? </s>
