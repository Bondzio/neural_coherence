There are periodically studies/reports of repair rates.
The last I read for desktops had HP/Compaq and Acer/Gateway as top.
They all flip-flop and aren't all that far from each other.
Dell's pretty middle of the pack when it comes to quality.
World-wide they retain good marketshare.
My problems with Dell were more a symptom of being mail-order, getting DOA computer and having to ship it back, wasting a lot of time I didn't have.
The XPS 420 and others in that line impressed me as being pretty complete machines and a good value.
