when i recently upgraded my laptop from 2 x 2 gb to 2 x 4 gb, it didn't detect either one.
i went back and noticed that i hadn't pushed the little suckers in all the way (even though i thought i had), so i pushed them in with more force (more than i had expected) and rebooted.
it could be that one of your might have the same problem.
if that's not it, i've read that sometimes there's a bios setting you have to tweak, although i've never personally seen it.
since you say it's a new computer, i don't suppose there's a 4 gb hardware limit, but i'd check that just to be sure.
good luck.
