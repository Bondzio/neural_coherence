just set the ip addresses manually?
i can't hold the full class on ip networking here but even with dhcp enabled nothing stops you from setting the ip addresses manually on a server.
as to no wifi on the tplink, routers in my town start at 20 bucks so why not sell off that poc and get what you really want?
