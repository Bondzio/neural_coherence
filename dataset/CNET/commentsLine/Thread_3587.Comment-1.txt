i'm looking at buying a used system for my nieces/nephews since theirs just died.
right now, looking at a nice dell gx745 sff which has a 275w power supply (which can not be replaced by a regular after market unit).
question is... looking at low rise single slot video card upgrades around $35, i see that cards like the radeon hd5450 requires a min.
of a 400w power supply, but, when i research the card's benchmark tests i see that it's max power consumption is only 19w.
so... when looking at video cards... do i look at min.
required specs?
or the actual power consumption?
otherwise, with a 275w power supply i don't think they make a pcie video card that low in specs that can be considered an upgrade.
