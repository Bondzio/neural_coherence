i have lost my designated drive letters.
the first clue something was wrong when i tried to burn a cd and i got an error in the burning telling me the process wasn't able to be completed.
i found this to be odd so i just tried it again thinking maybe it was some one time thing, (with a different cd) and got the same problem, at that time i was burning a data cd so i tried again to burn an audio cd using a different program, (the first was the windows writeable folder, the second was windows media player) but it wasn't showing a drive and by then i knew there was something wrong, so i shut down the computer and tried again.
again no drive letters and i look in the device manager and it shows the hp dvd writer is disabled, try to enable and it doesn't work.
i checked the cords in the back of the dvd rom after shutting it down and everything was secure.
please help me.
thanks
