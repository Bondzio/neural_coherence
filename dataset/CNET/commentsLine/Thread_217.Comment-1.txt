i have a floppy disk with a very important document on it that i need to get off of it.
however when i put the disk into the floppy drive of a couple different computers it prompts me to format the disk.
i read about this problem once before but i don't recall how to get around it.
the only copy of this document is on the floppy.
please advise.
