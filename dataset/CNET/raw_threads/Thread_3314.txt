WHEN I WAS INSTALLING A NEW VERSION OF XP PRO, I JUST FINISHED UP BACKING ALL MY DATA FROM MY LAPTOP TO MY MAXTOR 3100 80 GIG EXTERNAL DRIVE. I FORGOT TO UNPLUG MY USB FOR THE DRIVE AND FORMATED IT. I HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING TO IT SINCE. WHEN I PLUG IT IN IT SAYS DRIVE NOT FORMATTED AND WANTS ME TO FORMAT IT. CAN I GET THE FORMATED DATA OUT SOMEHOW, BEFORE I RE-FORMAT IT. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME... KICKING MYSELF NOW...
