I have tested the power supply with volt meter and all have proper voltage. I even changed out power supply with a spare same problem. I then started disconecting power plugs and found the four pin 12 volt plug on the mother board is the problem. With the 4 pin plug disconected the computer will try to power up. I am then thinking mother board or processor. I took the processor out and computer now trys to power up with the 4 pin connected. I ordered a used processor on Ebay put it in and the same problem. The computer is 5 years old and I don't want to spend the money on a mother board if I am off base. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.

That also includes the PSU itself. I have reseated several times the connections and that helps if not a bad cap problem as the cabling can be pinched at odd places,e tc.. If a bad cable, replace until found. If you do in fact find a bad cap or mtrbd. itself, you should consider moving away from it, only a mtrbd. replacement works(fixed) because of old age, etc.. Ebay for a working replacement mtrbd. if so inlcined. tada -----Willy
