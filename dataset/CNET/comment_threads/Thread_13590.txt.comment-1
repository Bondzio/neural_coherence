I have always had a habit of buying Kingston memory (no particular reason), but I noticed that on NewEgg for instance, I can get 4GB of &quot;OCZ Gold&quot; for $250 whereas 4GB of Kingston HyperX is $390.
The Kingston also has a high latency of 9.
Basically, what am I missing about the price difference, since as far I can tell OCZ is another great memory maker?
