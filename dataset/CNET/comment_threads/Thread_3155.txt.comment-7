I had to make a decision - which was more important extra cores or extra SATA ports.
Since I really have little experience in working with either CS or Pinnacle Studio, I may find it more than I can handle.
I have worked some with PhotoShop 5 and with an older version of Pinnacle Studio but that was a few years ago.
And as I am The Ancient One (85 years old) I move rather slowly and if the computer moves slowly we will be on the &quot;same page&quot;.
