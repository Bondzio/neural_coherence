i have a thermantake xaser3 tower full of goodies.
i clean the case fan filters every three months and when i crack the case i check for anything that has happened to get inside.
i do a detail check of the innards once a year, but dust accumulation hasn't been an issue with this case.
i have serviced other machines including laptops that have been a very different story.
i use canned air and a basting tool and occasionally plastic tweezers on those ones to get them clean.
keep it clean and cool and keep it alive.
