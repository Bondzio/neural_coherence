1.1.1	I found a grate deal on a ATI Radeon 9250 256MB AGP Video Card I want to get , but I 'm not sure if I have an AGP slot for it .	St
1.1.2	could some one show me a pic or tell me what the slot looks like ?	Ques
1.2.1	If you enter the model name at the computer maker 's website , you can see all the specifications for your computer , including what kind of AGP slot you have , if any .	St
1.2.2	Alternatively , you could download and run a program like CPU-Z to learn the name of you motherboard model .	Sug
1.2.3	Google the model and you will learn a lot about what slots you have .	St
1.2.4	A picture , here you go : http : //www.abcd.com.au/v/agp_slot.htm How did I find that ?	Ques
1.2.5	I went to Google.com and typed in AGP SLOTS .	St
1.2.6	Tell us the computer manufasturer & model so we can help you find a compatible card .	St
1.2.7	Moterboard manufacturer and model name helps , too .	St
1.3.1	Like Linkit says ... you need the MB mfg name , model and revision number if you want to be sure whether it will work or not .	St
1.3.2	CPUZ will help with that .	St
1.3.3	VAPCMD	St

1.6.1	Today 's AGP slots do not have a set voltage .	St
1.6.2	The voltage is set by the AGP card and the AGP slot obliges .	St
1.6.3	That area causes far too much confusion .	St
1.6.4	Another confuser is the bad writing about 8X voltages .	St
1.6.5	The tech writer 's coffee priviledges should be revoked .	St

1.7.1	I had purchased one from crucial that I had to send back - it only had one slot in the card not two and it is pictured that way at this site : http : //www.crucial.com/promo/index.asp ? prog=uslp_clickscansnap Darrell Lewis - PS the piece that is in the center was the difference and crucial has no space on the side for it to fit .	St
1.7.2	Fortunately , I did n't force it in nor did i remove that piece in the slot .	St
1.7.3	But if that looks like yours you can find out when you go to the site .	St
1.7.4	The memory was correct but the AGP Vid was not , it has one notch and not two .	St
