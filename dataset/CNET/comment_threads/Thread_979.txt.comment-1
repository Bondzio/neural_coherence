Hi, I am looking at the Linksys rvl200 router, mainly for its SSL VPN function.
However, the router does not have wi fi capabilities.
How would I configure a wi fi router to the rvl200?
Particularly I would like to see the &quot;inner&quot; LAN from the outside via the vpn.
I am particularly looking at the Linksys 350N, so that I can add a storage drive.
Much thanks.
