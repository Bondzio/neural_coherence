<s> I recently purchased a Dynex 2-port USB 2.0 card for my desktop at home. </s>
<s> Looking at the system requirements, It needed an OS from Win98SE to Windows XP SP1, no mention of SP2. </s>
<s> I didn't think that was a big deal at first. </s>
<s> I installed the card and when I rebooted Windows, Windows XP went through the whole &quot;detected new hardware&quot; thing in the lower right hand corner of the screen. </s>
<s> I even installed the driver CD that came with the card. </s>
<s> A couple of days later I tested out the new card by plugging in a flash drive into it. </s>
<s> No response. </s>
<s> I plugged the flash drive into one of the old USB 1.1 ports and the flash drive came on just fine. </s>
<s> I wouldn't have thought there would be a huge technological difference between SP1 and SP2. </s>
<s> I thought the Service Packs only dealt with Security issues. </s>
<s> I'm going to put the USB card on a Win98SE machine that I have that I use for emergencies and to play old PC games to see if the card works there. </s>
<s> Was there issues in the past with some Hardware not working when moving from SP1 to SP2? </s>
<s> I currently have Windows XP Home that came with SP2. </s>
<s> But let's check something first. </s>
<s> Tell me which motherboard driver package you are using. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> XP OS doesn't supply USB drivers, though it may have in earlier releases. </s>
<s> that's a function of the mtrbd. </s>
<s> support CD or USB driver from the support website. </s>
<s> Plus, it has to be enabled in bios. </s>
<s> Then you have to if so supplied install the USB cards own driver, I have found some cheaper USB cards or devices simply problematic and only the &quot;generic USB&quot; driver does any good from the http://www.usbman.com website. </s>
<s> Check all that... FYI - SP2 dealt with alot more than security, but it should also include SP1(or portions needed) as part of the total install package. </s>
<s> tada =====Willy </s>
<s> After the computer was re-booted a few times, the USB 2.0 card decided to work on my Win XP machine. </s>
<s> I'm not entirely sure why it finally decided to work, but I'm happy it did. </s>
