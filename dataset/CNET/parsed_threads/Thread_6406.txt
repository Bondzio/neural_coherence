<s> I just bought a hard drive which was shipped to me. </s>
<s> Living in the upper midwest, the weather has been 20 deg Farenheight during the days that the hard drive was in transit. </s>
<s> When I checked the manufacturer web site regarding maintaining the drive properly, they say not to keep the drive below 40 degrees. </s>
<s> 1)Have I put the hard drive at risk by shipping it in this extrememely cold weather which contradicts the manufacturer recomended temperature? </s>
<s> 2)Can shipping an item like a hard drive in a small box as it was shipped from the retailer, jeapardize the inegrity of it? </s>
<s> Then you avoid the usual damage. </s>
<s> Sorry but this will be my only reply as I find folk fret a lot about this and I can't repeat long discussions about why moisture is bad. </s>

<s> Being shipped in cold temps shouldn't be a problem as long as you give it a couple of hours to get to normal room temperature before trying to use it. </s>
<s> When not in use, the read/write heads will be docked away from the platters to keep from having problems. </s>
<s> I've seen folks ruin hard drives by trying to operate them when they're too cold though. </s>
<s> The platters in the disk drives are made with a metallic base which expands and contracts with temp changes, so you do need to be careful not to operate them when they're outside of the manufacturer's specifications. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
