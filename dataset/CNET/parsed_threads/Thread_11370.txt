<s> I have a 2wire HomePortal 1000SW and would like to get an inexpensive wireless card or USB connector that will work with this system. </s>
<s> I have read elsewhere that you have to use a 2wire product, but I find it hard to believe that no one has developed a product to fill this demand (SBC/Yahoo DSL has many customers). </s>
<s> Can anyone help with this? </s>
<s> A 2wire adapter costs almost half as much as I spent to build my daughter's computer. </s>
<s> Thanks: Blackflame </s>
<s> http://www.dsldepot.com/item.asp?id=24 notes it does 802.11b. </s>
<s> That's a standard and the cheapest 802.11b pcmcia card I ever dredged up was 8 dollars. </s>
<s> On average it's closer to 20 or 30. </s>
<s> It's not proprietary (802.11b) so why not? </s>

<s> I use a GetOn from Truckstop.net. </s>
<s> Bought it on eBay for $5.00. </s>
<s> I work in a small office about 25ft from the portal and it just zips along. </s>
<s> Good Luck. </s>
