i contacted hp, they said it has 1.5 amps on the 12v rail, i;m going to cancel that order.
they also said that installing a psu with more than 1.5 amp would damage my mother board and that all hps are give 1.5 amps on the 12v rail.
apparently it's impossible to upgrade my computer cause i've been doing this for about 2 weeks and still nothing.
