<s> I recently put the guts from an E machines 1500 in another case because of mechanical switch problem with the case front. </s>
<s> I can not find usb pin out ID for the usb Hub on the am35 motherboard. </s>
<s> Would like ot install a card reader /usb internally but everything I can find has different plug wiring including the blocked connection. </s>
<s> For what it is worth the wire colors shown in the manual do not match what is in the block. </s>
<s> Any help or reference to a site with the answer would help&gt; </s>
<s> We don't know what your header looks like. </s>
<s> Often it's two rows of pins with 5 in one row and 4 in the other. </s>
<s> The odd pins don't much matter. </s>
<s> It should be easy enough to find the +5v & the ground. </s>
<s> They should be on opposite sides of 4 pin row and will those will match the corresponding pins in the row parallel to it. </s>
<s> The pins in between should be the data+ and data-. </s>
<s> Data- should be next to the +5v pin. </s>
<s> So in sequence you have +5v, data-, data+ and ground. </s>
<s> On the mtrbd. </s>
<s> USB connection follows the USB standard, starting at pin 1. </s>
<s> If what you're asking is what wire harness setup is, then that's entirely unique even though it follows once properly connected the same results. </s>
<s> If you have actual separate wires per pin, then I can easily see your situation. </s>
<s> You need to google for USB wiring and there several examples out there. </s>
<s> As the other poster offered a meter would help to determine basic wiring. </s>
<s> Also, since you have an old 1500 model, that maybe at a period when USB connections did vary, pin wise amount. </s>
<s> true USB std. </s>
<s> now is 10-pin, minus 1 pin for &quot;key purpose&quot; to ordinate pre-made wire harness. </s>
<s> -OR- as use the pin 1 on wire harness to pin 1 on mtrbd.(noted). </s>
<s> Yet, most wire harness use 4-wires(when separate), the idea behind 10-pins at mtrbd. </s>
<s> is to properly set it all up, thus a hub for 2-USB ports If you're dealing with a 4-wire connection, then find the Grd, 5V+, and Signal. </s>
<s> Confusing, you bet in older and early USB setups, thus the 10-pin connection became the norm. </s>
<s> Colors do vary, sorry they do, so while a clue they're not always followed. </s>
<s> If you're lucky, the wire harness has stickers/labels ID'ing what they do. </s>
<s> Maybe, your USB labels are [+], [-], [data or signal], [grd], or [5v]. </s>
<s> Google for wiring schematics. </s>
<s> If this becomes too painful, then use a USB PCI type card to add USB ports for quick use of the PC for the time being, cost is low. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I have a pci card installed. </s>
<s> I also have another pci card with both rear case and one internal USB socket. </s>
<s> What I really want to do is install a front case card reader with a USB port. </s>
<s> I have looked high and low for an internal reader and I can not find one that does not connect to the 9 pin hub on the mothjer board. </s>
<s> They all have the blocked pin on the wrong corner of the connector. </s>
<s> You have an int. </s>
<s> connection on the mtrbd. </s>
<s> WHAT does it look like? </s>
<s> Can you provide pix on the matter and be sure its USB as well. </s>
<s> Don't confuse any audio(SPIF) port for USB , they look similar. </s>
<s> As i stated older mtrbds. </s>
<s> weren't all std. </s>
<s> and may differ which is why many USB harness had separate wires for a connection in order to match the needs. </s>
<s> Later USB connections followed the 10-pin connection(refer to previous post) and then try to connect. </s>
<s> Yeah, it maybe difficult but that's the way it is. </s>
<s> It's very possible your PCI USB int. </s>
<s> connection is up to date and may follow the USB std. </s>
<s> connection, use it instead of mtrbd. </s>
<s> supplied for the time being. </s>
<s> Also, your USB reader has to be similar. </s>
<s> if you're trying to carry over some eMachine USB reader, it may not be a match or direct connection, because OEM supplied parts are made for their wants and needs. </s>
<s> This maybe a case of &quot;look and see&quot; what you have in order to resolve it. </s>
<s> FYI- A mtrbd. </s>
<s> connection is considered a &quot;hub&quot; or to a hub that normally supports 2-USB ports. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> The more I look, I see reference to emachine W1500. </s>
<s> So what does the decal/sticker say as to the full model#? </s>
<s> Because, if it is W1500, then that's a real old mtrbd. </s>
<s> of socket A variety which suggests the USB is probable USB1.0 or worse that USB connections did vary too greatly from one brand to the next as the USB std. </s>
<s> wasn't fully settled as it is now at USB2.0. </s>
<s> General AM35 info link, maybe??? </s>
<s> Emachine manual, not provided so far at their support website. </s>

<s> with all the answers everyone provided I am now educated on USB. </s>
<s> I will put in a USB pci card with 4 + 1 outlets. </s>
<s> In oreder to get a 3.0 card reader with a usb plug I will Have to settle for 2.0 performance which qwwas all I was looking for thanks </s>
