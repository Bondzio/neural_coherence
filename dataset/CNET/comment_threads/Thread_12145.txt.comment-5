Bob, I hope that my question didn't irritate you near as much as your response seemed that it did!!
If so, I apologize.
As I said, I'm a novice at this... your first email indicated that I couldn't move the programs, but that was different than my second question.
I took all the steps to register CS2, so I will try to contact Adobe and see if I can get either CS2 replaced or the current CS4 at a reduced rate.
Thank you for that advice!
Karen
