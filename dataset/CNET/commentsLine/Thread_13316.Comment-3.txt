i don't know if you've heard of &quot;tiny&quot;... they were a uk-based company that didn't too well, so i'm no longer covered by them.
in any case, i'm well past my guarantee's duration.
a friend has told me it may be the motherboard that is messed up, but i can't afford investing in that so i'm likely to just buy a couple of more fans.
i have tried leavin the cover off but that hasn't solved it.
