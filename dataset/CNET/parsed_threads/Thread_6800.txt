<s> This is an ongoing problem and I am wondering if a firmware update is called for. </s>
<s> We have had the router for some time and to the best of my knowledge nothing has been done to fix the problem except the old &quot;unplug for 10 seconds&quot; routine. </s>
<s> There are now four users on the home network with multiple devices. </s>
<s> Can anyone advise me as to how to approach this problem? </s>
<s> I can't answer any firmware question. </s>
<s> However I do suggest the usual default setup noted in the CNET Networking Forum. </s>
<s> Some routers don't work well with hidden SSID, MAC filters but the details are not in your opening post so not much can be offered yet besides the old &quot;try it our way&quot; routine. </s>
<s> I know how frustrating this issue is, hope there is something we can try. </s>
