My pc ran fine until one day the chipset heatsink popped loose. after reattaching it i could not seem to get it to boot up. i ordered a new board, same problem. new processor installed, no bootup again. new video card, nothing. new power supply, nothing. all this time im getting a long beeeeep, short beep beep beep. after discoving this is typically bad memory, i replace memory. long story short i have new everything except for a case and hard drive. even with the hard drive unplugged i still get the beep error i get before. i can't come up with a reasoning for all of this but it has become very expensive. can anyone help?

Read http://www.tomshardware.com/column/20011012/index.html Frankly, this power supply is suitable for the up to 1 GHz class of machines. Yes, it might work for awhile, but as a test I'd slip in a 450W to see if power is the issue as well as removing all drives. Nothing but motherboard, CPU/HSF, RAM and a video card. Not much else is needed to see a screen display. Why so small a supply? Have you read http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/index.html and such articles? Bob

7671	8	98375	1126097	1126051	chrispauley	4/14/05 7:33 PM	1.11350718E12	nope	Attempting to boot with only memory, video and processor still fails
