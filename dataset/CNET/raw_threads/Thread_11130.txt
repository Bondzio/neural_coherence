It was suggested to me to purchase a high grade power supply. The Enermax 660 Watt PSU was recommended. It looks to be a heavy duty unit. What are your thoughts on the Enermax 660 watt PSU? Thanks. Greetings from Canada.

A 660 watt power supply will power all your components and you won't get any power hiccups due to a low watt power supply. Also a high watt power supply will surport newer hardware that demand more power, if you decide to upgrad in the future...

They have provided decent service if a good match is found the more wattage the better. However, Enermax also makes I believe the PowerMax series of psus and is trying to leviate those models to a premium level which it maybe, but generally if you have the wattage and build-in cooling most do well. If you like the bells and whistles sorta thing, remember that is usally just that it really do much to cool or maintain a stable output, so look beyond LED lites, dials, and too fancy cabling. I suggest it should have at least 2 fans for best operation, the quieter the better. tada -----Willy
