1.1.1	I had the opportunity to restore Windows XP on a E Machine model T3092 with a 3000XP Athlon and 512mb ram and was amazed at how fast it could boot up and load programs compared to my P4 2.8 with 1024mb ram .	St
1.1.2	I know I have not had a reason to reload my computer for some time but have done at least one other P4 2.8 and I always thought they were quick until now .	St
1.1.3	This E Machine is running factory and not over clocked and I am surprised as to how quick it is .	St
1.1.4	Should'nt the performance on these two computers not be closer .	St
1.1.5	Looking for opinions and not any real tech stuff I would n't understand .	St
1.1.6	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	I have a P4 3.4 GHz , with 4GB RAM DDR2 , ATI X700 256MB , with SATA RAPTOR 10K RPM .	St
1.2.2	On which I use to run program for PIC MicroChip Emulator , to test programs that I make for PIC Processor .	St
1.2.3	At that time I also had a P4 2.8 , 1GB Laptop .	St
1.2.4	But one of the guys from my office walked up to me and asked me to exchange his laptop for mine , his was a brand new Athlon 64 , with 512MB but it had few other things like Wireless and better looking screen , he wanted to exchange it because I had a serial port on mine .	St
1.2.5	So I thought it was a good deal but not a great one , still I did exchange it , after installation I Ran the same emulation program to my surprise the program actually was running 5-6 times faster .	St
1.2.6	Which is really amazing .	Polite
1.2.7	BTW if you want your machine to boot really fast do n't install MS Office , I use OpenOffice and it really boots up faster and works faster after being booted up .	St
1.3.1	I keep my start menu and services trimmed and is very close in content to the new install I just did to the E machine , so I am sure this is not the difference which is large .	St
1.3.2	Also the P4 I did awhile ago was fresh as well and was not noticeably faster than mine .	St
1.3.3	I have looked into comparisons at various sites and found these configurations should be close in operation speed .	St
1.3.4	Are Athlons normally quicker at start up ?	Ques
1.4.1	Webroots Spysweeper has been slowing my computer down immensely and when turned off it is much faster , but is still slower than the Athlon version .	St
1.5.1	Download 3D Mark 06 and SiSoft Sandra if you want to compare them .	St
