1.1.1	I have a lot of old vinyl and cassettes that I want to transfer to digital format on my computer .	St
1.1.2	Since the source of these formats are analog , and the typical line-in on a sound card is analog , I am wondering how I can best tranfer the audio data to digital .	St
1.1.3	My stereo receiver does not have a digital output , only inputs .	St
1.1.4	I guess what I am asking is for the & quot ; best & quot ; means to convert old format audio to digital and what hardware/software should I be looking at ?	Ques
1.1.5	Particularly the sound card and the proper input to the PC for capturing the digital conversion .	St
1.1.6	thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	There is no quick and easy transfer .	St
1.2.2	It take 60 minutes to capture 60 minutes of LP or tape music .	St
1.2.3	You connect the source , via cable , to the & quot ; Line In & quot ; connector on the sound card .	St
1.2.4	Cable available at Radio Shack .	St
1.2.5	You play the LP or tape and use recording sofware on the computer to capture the music .	St
1.2.6	Here are two sets of instructions I found on the CNET site : http : //reviews.cnet.com/4520-6450_7-5020869.html http : //reviews.cnet.com/4520-7899_7-5116211.html ... .. .	St
1.3.1	In addition to that simple wiring set up there is some very good software by Steinberg called & quot ; Clean Up & quot ; I think which is specifically designed to digitally remove the hiss and crackle associated with vinyl and tape .	St
1.3.2	Good Luck	St
1.4.1	I am doing exactly what you are trying to do .	St
1.4.2	Transfer old LPs to my hard-drive and to CDs ( I assume ) .	St
1.4.3	I guess ignorance is bliss , because I installed RealPlayer ( after many annoying pop-ups , etc . )	St
1.4.4	and found that for $ 19.95 I could have ( among other things ) the option of recording from & quot ; line-in & quot ; or & quot ; mic & quot ; jacks on my sound card .	St
1.4.5	All I did then was run a cable from the & quot ; phones & quot ; jack on my old turntable to the & quot ; line-in & quot ; jack on my sound card .	St
1.4.6	After opening RealPlayer , I chose & quot ; record from line-in or mic & quot ; and followed the step-by-step procedure which was kind of intuitive .	St
1.4.7	With a few trial & error guesses , you will be off and running !	St
1.4.8	I have not found this option with Windows Media Player , and queries to MS produced no satisfactory replys except for computer generated & quot ; FAQ & quot ; answers .	St
1.4.9	If they ca n't be bothered , neither can I .	St
1.5.1	I am also recording over to cd .	St
1.5.2	All i did was run a cable from my stereo to my computers line in ... i use the program called Sound Capture .	St
1.5.3	Only bad part is 60min of music takes 60min to record as said earlier .	St
1.5.4	www.magicsofts.com has the program and its free just like all things that are wonderful .	St
