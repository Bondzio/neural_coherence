Why are you doling out the details?
I've guessed wrong 2 times now and given your useless information.
Sorry about that, but it could explain why you are finding it difficult to find help.
In closing, it seems you have a normal setup.
In that case just read what came with the router.
Nothing is out of the ordinary so I bid you well and write that your setup has thousands of web sites of help.
