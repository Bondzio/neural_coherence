Oh, I forgot to ad, currently, I really do not have a solid backup plan.
In the past I have used a 1gb thumbdrive to back up important documents and other items of importance; some I would just drop into my second hardrive.
I would do this by using the backup utility that comes with Windows XP.
Could I even use a 3rd drive as a backup in another Raid configuration?
