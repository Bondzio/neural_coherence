<s> You can boot from a Ubuntu disc or flash drive even when you can't boot from your hard drive. </s>
<s> And you can use Ubuntu to examine your hard drive too. </s>
<s> You probably just need to refresh the MBR (Master Boot Record) on the hard drive unless the drive has totally crapped out. </s>
<s> Ubuntu will tell you whether that's the case. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
