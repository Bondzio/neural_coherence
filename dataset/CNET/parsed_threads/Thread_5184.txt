<s> I have a &quot;stigma tel C major&quot; sound card (i think) and the sound is very dodgey for when i listen to music the voice of a person is very faint and the bass tune is very loud,, the speakers aren't that old either </s>
<s> Is the sound &quot;card&quot; is not a card, but on a motherboard. </s>
<s> Such affairs are low cost options and certain no attention is paid to any frequency response curve since the amplified speakers are likely to be a bundled deal as well. </s>
<s> In a line, &quot;that ain't hi-fi.&quot; Be sure to look at all the sound controls in the control panel to be sure someone didn't diddle with the base/treble controls. </s>
<s> Some have them, some don't. </s>
<s> New Windows users just need to be shown where these are, but sometimes you can't because like most things, the vendors can modify such for more eye-candy. </s>
<s> Here' s a typical picture which may or may not show the bass/treble control. </s>
