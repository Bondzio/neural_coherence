I currently have a Celeron 2.2GHz Socket 478 running inside a Dell Dimension 2400 still with the stock Dell motherboard.
Currently, identification programs such as CPU-Z have listed the effective FSB as 400 with a true FSB of 100.
I have heard other people describe Intel FSB's as &quot;quadpumped&quot; (100x4=400).
Does anyone know if 400MHz is the limited effective speed for this computers motherboard because I'm curious to know if putting a Socket 478 Pentium 4 with an 800MHz would work in this computer.
