<s> Hello, I have some computers in a workgroup and can't access my Windows XP machine from the Windows 2000 ones. </s>
<s> If I try to browse the XP computer, it prompts for a user name and password but won't log me in even when I try to log in as Administrator. </s>
<s> I can, however, get to the windows 2000 computers from my XP one. </s>
<s> Have any of you ever ran into a problem similar to this? </s>
<s> Thanks, Chris </s>
<s> your a stupid head everyone knows how to log on even my senile grandma can do it. </s>
<s> (ITS WINDOWS ITS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE!!!!!) </s>
<s> _ su uno estpido cabeza cada uno saber cmo entrar uniforme mi senil grandma poder l. _ (SU WINDOWS SU NO COHETE CIENCIA!!!!!) </s>
<s> _ apenas kidding! </s>
<s> I belive you have to run the Windows XP Network Wizard on the Xp machine to have it be accessible bye other computer on the network. </s>
<s> I not a 100% sure if this will correct the issues with 2k machines accessing it </s>
<s> It can be that simple. </s>

<s> I ran the network setup wizard and it works great now. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
