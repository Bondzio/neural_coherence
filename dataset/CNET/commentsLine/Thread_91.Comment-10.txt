well after doing some research on the topic, i did find out that it can work for short periods of time.
as in a few min or an hour ect.
wich can be long enough to get the files you need off the hard drive.
but also begs the question, why ask that question here??.
for me to find the info took all of 30seconds.
click on new tab - google - type in -- freezing your hard drive and wala i found a million sites that have tons of info about that topic.
