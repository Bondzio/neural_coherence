what exactly is the point of doing what you suggested?
i mean, really... save $800, and spend $600 of it repairing?
if you are going to save $800, i would buy a whole new pc.
there are very good deals on hp, compaq, emachines, and powerspec computers.
you could have 1gb of ram, a 120gb hard drive (and a backup drive), a 52x cdr/rw/ and a 16x dvd-r, and windows xp pro fo $800!
and if that sounds good to you, imagine what you could do if you save $800 now, keep working with the pc you have, and gradually saving more money until windows releases vista next year!
when that happens, all the machines you could buy now will be ancient history, as 4gb of ram and 500gb hard drives will become common.
i understand not wanting to spend a lot of money... being 15 and currently unemployed (damn report cards...).
but really, it is not worth the hassle to even try and &quot;soupe&quot; up you computer bro... go with a new one.
or wait for vista.
