i want to upgrade my p4 2.8 gh, 1 gig ram, agp nvidia fx 5700 vid card rig.
i am wondering if either of these cards would be good upgrades for my system, and be able to play oblivion fairly well:   also, i currently run my system on a 250w power supply.
if i upgrade to one of these video cards, will i have to upgrade my power supply?
if so, can you suggest one to me?
thanks!
also, if there are any other agp video cards under $200 you would suggest, please tell me.
thanks!
