<s> I'm about to purchase a Gateway 200X notebook. </s>
<s> Should I go with the integrated 802.11b/g capability or should I dump that and just get a wireless network card? </s>
<s> My concern with the integrated capability is that it can't be upgraded in the future. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any recommendations? </s>
<s> Just FYI. </s>
<s> ALL the integrated units that I've encountered were mini-PCI cards that you could change or remove... My advice is to go with it installed since it will be good to go on arrival. </s>
<s> One less thing for you to install and setup. </s>
