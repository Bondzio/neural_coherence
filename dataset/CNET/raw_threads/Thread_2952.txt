I thought it may have been a power problem but i had a 350 and changed it to 480 and still the problem continues. Is it maybe a hard drive issue or a heat issue. 2.53 pentium Windows Xp 1gb 2100 ram 7 fans 480w power radeon 9800pro 128mb 80 gb hard drive ( 60Gb empty) I checked bios and the it said that cpu Heat - 48c Pc heat - 28C

Latest BIOS. 4. BIOS defaults. I've seen people with a dozen fans and still the cover off fixed it. That drives them nuts. bob

That second hard disk... and go back to the prior video card. It can still be a glitchy power supply or motherboard. Be sure to look for domed or leaking capacitors too. So far, nothing in your post points to any specific part. So you get to use the old ways. bob

Try and see if you have a acceleration card. If not then try these: 1.Reformat your whole comp 2.Update latest drivers for all cards 3.Make sure you have the latest XP 4.I hope these work. If not then email me at BrennanandEvan@aol.com
