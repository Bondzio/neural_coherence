in about 1975, i started hunting and pecking on the terminals of a newspaper typesetting system.
that's how i wrote my letters to santa claus.
my father lamented that learning that way, my fingers would never be strong enough to operate a real typewriter.
of course it turned out that i never needed to use a manual typewriter, and my fingers were plenty strong for electrics.
i made my last regular use of typewriters in the late 80s and in 1988 bought my first computer, a mac.
my college friends either used lab computers or had dedicated word processors and i was feeling way tech savvy when flipping disks between the floppy with the system and the floppy with the applications and data - no hard drive!
getting an external floppy drive a year later to end disk swapping put me over the moon.
