I'm about to change from a past decade old 17&quot; CRT to an LCD for the first time. Going to get a 19' standard this time around and when more applications support widescreen then I'll upgrade. For the moment though I know that the size of the lcd will give a 1280x1024 reso. I've been told that lcd worked best on their native resolution and even though that is obvious I would like to know how it responds to lower settings. I'm an old school gamer. I play games like Master Of Orion 2 and I still love my Starcraft and Diablo to name a few. How would these look on an lcd? I would be really disapointed in getting a screen that couldn't show some decently my all time fav games. If brand helps in this query. I'm currently looking at the Samsung 932BF and the LG L1900R - both at 2ms and at 2000:1 and 3000:1 respectively of contrast ratio. Thx

You'll love yours. One thing you didn't mention is your video card. Will it support the native resolution of the proposed LCD? The reason I ask is I recently purchased a 22&quot; and was excited to hook it up. Although my high end nVidia 256 Meg video card supported a gazillion resolutions, the specific native of the 22&quot; was not listed. In tears I returned it.

As I move the slider left/right I think it's trying to tell me what res my vid card can handle. Perhaps worth a look to see if the #'s match.
9420	7	262369	2574566	2574386	Coryphaeus	8/31/07 5:45 PM	1.1885823E12	Oh yeah. . .	I'm well familiar with resolutions. But the specific one for that monitor was not listed. I could set it a little below and the picture, specifically text was not good. Above the native and I got the screen message, &quot;Out of Range!&quot;.

Talk about an improvement. I'm still tweaking the settings but already I am impressed. After much research my fears about how older games would look like had abated a bit. I loaded up Master of Orion 2 and found out that I could play with native resolution by &quot;changing&quot; it to what was required for me to play (640x480 for this game). I'm not sure if that is standard but my video card allowed me this. It looks a tad bit soft but its nothing major. Came with a DVI corde so I was all set. YAY!!!
