use ie and go into the setup screen for your router.
check the mac address for your cards in the mac setup screen.
set the router so it will only allow these mac addresses to use the router.
you can also set up a log file that will keep track of every use of the router and usually you can set it up so the log is e-mailed to any address you want.
it is easier to go in and look at the log rather than getting a bunch of e-mails from the router.
