when makers rewrite the networking book we'll have to match the old names to what they write today.
that's a bridge mode and can harbor a firewall.
domains are going to tax even the most season it staff as the domain servers must be configured just so.
but i wonder if you have confused domains with workgroups?
if you have different workgroup names you have to correct that.
