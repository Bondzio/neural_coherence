<s> Hi, I bought a Sony DVD(burner) drive and I hook up to my workstation. </s>
<s> Some times my XP pro recognizing the drive and most of the times it is not recognzing. </s>
<s> I can't see the drive in File explorer. </s>
<s> When I go to the Safe mode I was able to see. </s>
<s> Right now it is not working and I was frustrated why it is not recognizing. </s>
<s> Pls help me out with this. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Is it jumpered properly. </s>
<s> When you saw it in safe mode was there also another entry??? </s>
<s> If so remove all of the entries and then reboot and let the system find it again. </s>
<s> power and ribbon cables for likely damage and are securely plugged in </s>
<s> Are you using CloneCD or uninstalled it recently? </s>
<s> I had this problem and it appeared to stem from that.. </s>
