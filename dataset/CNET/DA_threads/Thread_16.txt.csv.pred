1.1.1	Hi, I currently own a netbook without an optical drive.	St
1.1.2	I was first pondering the idea of just purchasing an external drive when the idea came to me that I could just network one of my desktop's CD drives.	St
1.1.3	The problem is, that I want more than just file sharing, I want the netbook to see the virtual drive as a local drive.	St
1.1.4	Reason being: If i want to install software from CD's, newer applications today have anti piracy checks in place that won't allow this kind of installing (which I am not upset about since piracy is becoming a bigger and bigger problem).	St
1.1.5	I am not looking to pirate anything, I just want to save the expense of an external CD drive.	St
1.1.6	Any ideas?	St
1.1.7	(ie software solutions, or OS tweaks (im perfectly fine with editing the registry if this is a possible solution path).	St
1.2.1	I've not done this with a CD ROM drive but it might be worth a try.	St
