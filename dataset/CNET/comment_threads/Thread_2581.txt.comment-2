Windows Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) will do it.
Just run the Windows Network Setup wizard.
HOWEVER...
I highly recommend purchasing a broadband router.
It adds an extra layer of security (firewall, filtering, etc.)
between your computers and the DSL modem.
Also, a router will allow your laptop to use the DSL Internet connection without having to turn on your desktop, as ICS requires.
I recommend purchasing a wireless-G broadband router.
Most allow you to make 4 wired connections and multiple wireless connections at the same time.
