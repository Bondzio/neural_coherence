it's tough to determine external hd reliability unless the manufacture has completed real life reliability tests.
some manufactures have the capability of completing these tests however it is expensive.
with budget cuts and companies revenues on the line you can bet that these tests have been eliminated.
there is another method however it is not accurate.
the manufacturer can complete a reliability prediction called mtbf predictions.
mtbf (mean time between failures).
it is calculated by several methods.
this method is often used in place of life tests.
it is expressed in hours.
i would suggest for you to contact the manufacturer of the external drive and ask for the specification for reliability.
ask whether it is from real life tests or is it calculated by using the above method- mtbf predictions.
good luck.
it figures wd had a failure.
