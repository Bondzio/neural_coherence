<s> We have a lot of video footage from our various vacations. </s>
<s> As you can imagine it is precious stuff we don't want to lose! </s>
<s> Looking through various sites on the internet, I am not clear on what the most robust and reliable storage mechanism is. </s>
<s> Some considerations: 1. </s>
<s> Internal vs. </s>
<s> External: I know Internal is cheaper, but which is likely to last longer? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Docking Station for Internal Hard Drive: a friend recommended this, but my concern is won't the Internal Drive degrade if you either: (i) leave it sticking out of a docking station; or (ii) continually insert it and remove it. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> External Drive with Enclosure: is this worth considering, and how would it compare with (2) for longevity and reliability? </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> RAID solutions: have read a bit about data redundant solutions, but have no real idea how to set this up. </s>
<s> What would I need and how would I set it up? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for advice! </s>
<s> A single copy on one drive or even two copies on the same drive no matter how reliable fails folk all the time. </s>
<s> RAID is interesting with the DROBO (see google) but is no cure for having no backup. </s>
<s> If you can't lose them, get two drives and keep them synced. </s>
<s> Here I have 3 drives that I sync but then I really don't want to lose my stuff. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob -- but I would I set this up? </s>
<s> What drives and configuration would you recommend? </s>
