<s> Sorry for the long post but here it goes. </s>
<s> I have a pre-existing ethernet network with three computers attached sharing one DSL connection with an empty ethernet port available on my router. </s>
<s> I also have an HDTV. </s>
<s> My primary computer runs MCE 2005 but does NOT have a PVR or TV Tuner. </s>
<s> I have been reading very intently on a very interesting setup for home networking. </s>
<s> It uses the power system already in your home. </s>
<s> You connect a device (computer, router, etc.) </s>
<s> to a powerline-network adapter via Ethernet and then connect the power cable into a power outlet. </s>
<s> You then connect another device in the same way. </s>
<s> This creates a good connection from anywhere in your house. </s>
<s> I have also heard a lot about people buying &quot;digital media adapters&quot; which let you hook it up to a TV/stereo and connect to the network via Ethernet. </s>
<s> Then you can share your photos, video, music, etc. </s>
<s> on your HDTV. </s>
<s> My goal is to use the powerline networking method I described to connect my router to the digital media adapter. </s>
<s> My main question is, &quot;Will this work?&quot; Here is a link to CNET's article: http://reviews.cnet.com/4321-3243_7-6557573.html?tag=cnetfd.mt My next question is what digital media &quot;device(s)&quot; would I need to buy in order to send my (HD)TV signals over this said network so I could watch them and save them on my main computer(the one running MCE 2005 w/o a TV Tuner/PVR)? </s>
<s> I assume I would need to buy one of the digital media adapters that has HD inputs so it could send HD video to the network. </s>
<s> Is it even possible to send HD video to the computer using this networking option? </s>
<s> Thanks for bearing through with my long post. </s>
<s> I would really appreciate your help... </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> If any more info is needed, please ask! </s>
<s> this setup will replace the cat5/6 cable or wireless configuration. </s>
<s> From my point of view, it's convience but expensive (in other word..no big deal). </s>
<s> it is impossible for me to run an ethernet cable all across the house, I think this is exactly what I need. </s>
<s> The $50 adapter would suffice for me but do you if this whole setup would work? </s>
<s> I.e. </s>
<s> HDTV signal to computer via network, connect the adapter to the TV/stereo system itself? </s>
<s> Thanks for your input. </s>
