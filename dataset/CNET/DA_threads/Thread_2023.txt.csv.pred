1.1.1	have formatted 80g toshiba hhd in a blue ghost usb box.	St
1.1.2	xp says it is there and works.&quot;my computer&quot; does not show it.The drive already has o/s on it because I replaced it with a new seagate 100g ulta ata/100	St
1.2.1	Was this drive partitioned and formatted in that box?	St
1.2.2	If not, it may not work.	St
1.2.3	Bonus Question.	St
1.2.4	Is it connected to an USB 2.0 port?	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	no it was the drive out of my notebook,needed faster drive,5400 instead of 4200.what can i use to make the external drive work without reformating it.	St
1.4.1	There was another discussion just like this.	St
1.4.2	They had the USB 2.0, but after they partitioned and formatted it, the drive worked fine in the box.	St
1.4.3	They tested it by putting the drive into the PC and again it was unreadable.	St
1.4.4	You may have to use some laptop to desktop adapter (they are cheap) to drag your data off this drive.	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	the old drive (toshiba 80g) works just fine if I reinstall it in my laptop.Using usb box as in original post &quot;MY COMPUTER&quot; does not see it but device manager does says it works fine.	St
1.5.2	Tried my new 100g seagate in box same result.	St
1.5.3	Tring to find way to use both drives already formated on my laptop without having to remove one to use the other.I guess what I am saying isthat I would like to use the drives by selecting which one is the boot on start up but my bios does not seem to do that.If I take the one out of my computer,just get error message it does not see the one connected to the usb as bootable.	St
1.6.1	Here's the deal.	St
1.6.2	The drive does work.	St
1.6.3	Just that in many USB 2.0 drive cases, you have to partition and format such in the new USB 2.0 case.	St
1.6.4	Many wish it wasn't so, but this is how it is.	St
1.6.5	Hope this makes it clear how things work.	St
1.6.6	Bob	St
1.7.1	I have the same situation, a know good drive, xp finds and installs the new device, hardware manager says it works and I cannot find it in my computer (or any where else).	St
1.7.2	I'm game to refomat it re partition or what ever; but how do I find it to do these opeerations?	St
