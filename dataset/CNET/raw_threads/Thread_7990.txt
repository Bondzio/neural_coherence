I received one reply to another post concerning another topic which was which desktop PC by Velocity Micro was better for basic home office use; the Vector SX-V Value Edition or the Velocity Micro Vector PCX? The response which I received was the EMachine T6212 was better than either model offered by Velocity Micro. Do others in this forum agree with that statement or are desktop PC's manufactured by Velocity Micro better than those made by EMachine? Would the SX-V or Vector PCX be a better desktop PC than the EMachine T6212? Big Steve 05/12/05

I upgraded the grphics card to a 6600 GT OC and threw in 2 512 sticks of ram and the thing kicks ass! I can play Half Life 2 with all of the graphics turned up no problem. Same with Far Cry. I also bought a $20 soundblaster card, and a 450 Watt power supply, but you don't &quot;need&quot; these last two items. Nice to have though. AND when you decide to go SLI all you have to do is buy a motherboard! It's a no brainer dude..

It was a Seagate drive they were having problems with and my contact at Best Buy told me the new shipments were Western Digital 160gig ATA100. I bought one and am amazed at the bang for the buck! Added a 1 gig dual channel Kingston PC3200 memory kit and a Radeon X600 pro video card and it rocks! Never did like preconfigured rigs, but this is a near perfect platform to build on according to your needs. Keith.
