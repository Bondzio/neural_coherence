To get an idea of the value of a piece of hardware, search for it on eBay.
Use the option on the side of the page to view &quot;completed&quot; sales as most stuff like this will not find any buyers.
If you live in a Craig's List area, that's probably a good place to try to move some of your old &quot;goodies&quot; since there is no listing fee or seller's fee on Craig's.
The eBay listing fees on this &quot;yesterday's&quot; equipment list will bleed you dry.
Perhaps a better idea would be to find some place that takes &quot;tax write off&quot; where you MIGHT recover a bit of yesterday's values.
