Hello all, I am running windows 2000 pro and I recently moved a computer after getting it all set for a new user.It was fine and connecting to the network and internet until I put it in the new office.Now it wont connect at all and when I check the networking it is not receiving packet.Any help steering me in the right direction would be great.
