<s> Greetings - I am starting the process of building my own pc. </s>
<s> I already have a home theater pc (htpc) running Snapstream so I'm interested in building a new pc on the cheap for use just as a file server/storage. </s>
<s> I got an Ultra Wizard case for free after rebate from MicroCenter. </s>
<s> It has three external 5.25&quot; bays, one external 3.5&quot; bay, and five internal 3.5&quot; bays. </s>
<s> I also just got a Ultra 500 watt power supply for $5 after rebate. </s>
<s> Now, I'm looking at motherboards and processors. </s>
<s> Since I won't be gaming with this box, it doesn't need to be state of the art. </s>
<s> I'm trying to build it on the cheap. </s>
<s> I've been looking at AMD Athlon 64 processors from Newegg and Outpost. </s>
<s> Most seem to run around $50 or so. </s>
<s> For the motherboard, I'd ultimately like to have a mobo which supports 6 PATA hard drives. </s>
<s> Looking at Newegg, it seems most mobo's only support 4 hard drives. </s>
<s> All of my hard drives are PATA - I don't have any SATA yet. </s>
<s> I did find an open box motherboard at Newegg for $27. </s>
<s> It is a SOLTEK SL-K8TPro-754 Socket 754 VIA K8T800 ATX AMD Motherboard. </s>
<s> It's PATA is 3 x ATA100 up to 6 Devices. </s>
<s> The only problem is that Soltek is no longer going to make motherboards and their website is down. </s>
<s> I can imagine that BIOS updates will probably be non-existant so while it's cheap, the support options are probably non-existant. </s>
<s> I'm thinking a mobo manufacturer which is still in business is probably a better idea. </s>
<s> Anyone know of another mobo manufacturer which has support for 6 PATA drives and doesn't charge an arm & a leg for the board? </s>
<s> Thanks for any & all advice! </s>
<s> Why don't you just buy a cheap PCI ATA controller and plug it into the board? </s>
<s> They can be had for less than $20. </s>
<s> I usually buy from mwave.com and get a motherboard/ram/CPU combo, they will assemble and test it for 9.00 extra and that way you eliminate one more thing at assembly time. </s>

<s> Why do you need a mobo that supports 6 PATA devices when you have a case that only accomodates four? </s>
<s> &quot;I also just got a Ultra 500 watt power supply for $5 after rebate.&quot; Bad, bad, bad. </s>
<s> Ultra isn't known for making good products, and if this machine is a sever, you'll want it to be stable. </s>
<s> What are the amps on the PSU's +12V rail? </s>
<s> &quot;I've been looking at AMD Athlon 64 processors from Newegg and Outpost. </s>
<s> Most seem to run around $50 or so.&quot; I recommend the Athlon 64 3000+ Venice , which is $66 on newegg. </s>
<s> It's a socket 939 chip, though; you'll need to get a socket 939 motherboard, like the [url=http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131035]ASUS A8V-VM[/url. </s>
<s> It supports 4 PATA devices, so you should get the PCI adapter, like someone else said. </s>
<s> There are so many inexpensive storage solutions nowaday you don't need that extra 2 pata connections. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
