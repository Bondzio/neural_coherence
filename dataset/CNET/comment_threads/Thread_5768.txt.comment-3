How do I &quot;try Cable Select&quot; ?
Is that in the BIOS setup?
This is new territory for me.
I reattached the same cables used in the broken drive.
Thanks for your reply.
p.s.
I forgot to mention that my DVD drive did not appear either when I opened control panel.
After removing the new CDRW it does appear.
