1.1.1	Hello all Often when I try & safely remove a USB Mass Storage Device a Problem message appears to advise it's still in use suggesting, &quot;I close any programs or windows that might be using the device, and then try again later&quot;.	St
1.1.2	Any/ all programs are closed & it doesn't matter how long I wait, it cannot be removed safely.	St
1.1.3	I've had a look at Task Manager Processes and Services for anything obvious but I don't really know what I'm looking at so leave those alone.	St
1.1.4	I run CCleaner to no avail & end up shutting down my machine as a last resort.	St
1.1.5	My machine is a HP Compaq Presario A900 Notebook PC & OS is 32-bit Vista Home Premium SP2.	St
1.1.6	Any ideas guys?	St
1.1.7	Thank you.	St
1.2.1	Your anti-virus or any other protection scheme maybe active in scanning unattended any new files or media sources.	Ques
1.2.2	Also, while connected, if you networked, its a storage area that may not readily return until unhooked.	St
1.2.3	When this happens to me, I just shutdown the system rather than gamble the flash drive become corrupted because I removed it during that time.	St
1.2.4	Also, check your firewall for any doubtful activity.	Sug
1.2.5	tada -----Willy	St
1.3.1	Cheers, thanks Willy.	Polite
1.3.2	I'm glad I'm not the only one.	St
1.4.1	Rip it right out of the port.	St
1.4.2	Simple as that.	St
1.4.3	I do it all the time and nothing gets screwed up.	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	I used to &quot;just remove the device&quot; until my computer wouldn't shut down because the device &quot;was still running&quot;.	St
1.6.2	I ended up plugging the portable drive back in, powering down the computer and unplugging device, then rebooting as suggested above.	St
1.7.1	I agree that something may be accessing that drive, but if you're waiting that long, that isn't the problem.	Res
1.7.2	I wouldn't bother with clicking the &quot;Safely Remove Hardware&quot; icon.	St
1.7.3	I haven't since ME.	St
1.7.4	I only did that because the computer didn't like to reboot with that drive in it all of the time.	St
1.7.5	After the drive stops blinking, I wait till the count of 10, then remove it.	St
1.7.6	Unless I'm still going to use it.	St
1.7.7	No issues there.	St
1.7.8	I even do that on my friend's computer (an HP), she does the same.	St
1.7.9	If you're having a shut down or reboot issue with it I'd reformat it.	St
1.7.10	Which is good to do every few months.	St
1.7.11	This doesn't apply to PNY (I don't use them since they screwed me), nor the &quot;Cruiser&quot; line of drives from San Disc, that is one's which have their own program in them.	St
1.7.12	They could be writing to the drive as well.	St
1.7.13	I'd opt for reformatting the drive.	St
1.7.14	I'm sure you've tried using other drives (size & model) & have the same problem.	Res
1.7.15	Don't forget to defrag your computer, & no, you don't have to defrag the flash memory card.	Sug
1.8.1	installi dispositivo, scansione controlla percorso.	St
1.8.2	Apri da computer chiudi 2 click sx autorizzi e rimuovi.	St
1.9.1	If you are using iTunes, then look out for a couple of processes that will continue hooking your USB drive - even after you've shut down iTunes itself.	St
1.9.2	If you find iTunesHelper.exe in your Task Manager, Processes list, then try shutting it down (click on iTunesHelper, and End Process).	St
