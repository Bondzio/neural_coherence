Today, a Core 2 Duo should be fine for what you do. Since you watch movies, maybe put the extra cash towards a nice monitor or a killer surround sound system.

I wouldn't worry about getting a quad-core system but rather focus on having a big network connection where you may connect over some fiber-optic connection if you want &quot;lightning fast&quot; downloads as with the downloads and the IMs and the surfing these all share the same pipe which is the connection you'd have and you did say that price wasn't a factor. I'd suspect most AMD Athlon 64 x2s or Core 2 Duos wouldn't break a sweat on these things and if you have at least a couple gigabytes of RAM then you should be fine except for that network connection. Regards, JB

I would say that a quad core isn't really necessary. I agree with the other people, perhaps a lot of money shouldn't be invested in the computer itself, but with other features like a nice monitor and speakers. For a monitor I would suggest a Dell 24&quot; or potentially a 30&quot; if you are willing to spend the cash. A Logitech 5.1 surround system like the 5450 would do you very well. A good sound card (X Fi of some type) and a decent graphics card would serve you well, I don't know how many games you play. If you don't game much, I would suggest a 7600GT. I would also stay away from the Core 2 Exteme X6800, because for about the same price you can get the quad core Core 2. For your needs though I think a Core 2 Duo e6700 would probably be best. For movies and entertainment a good sound card/monitors/speakers is always a good deal. Also, a very nice new TV Tuner came out - the Vista View Saber, which if you have an available PCI-e x1 slot it is available (cnet review here: http://reviews.cnet.com/Vista_View_Saber_2020/4505-8902_7-32166004.html ). Investing in Windows Vista Home Premium or Ultimate when it comes out is highly recommended too. Unless money really isn't an issue at all, I would go dual core. But if your heart is set on quad core, I would go with the Intel QX6700, with the above components as well.

Unless he needs gaming, 7600GT is fine. It's also good for Vista (scores a 5.5 and 5.9 in graphics), which will keep him good until he decides to get DX10.

Having an adequate amount of memory is possibly the most important factor in doing all of those things at once with no slow down. (Obviously, connection speed is very important, and a good processor too) Basically, all the stuff your computer is currently doing is stored in the RAM. If it runs out of RAM, it starts using the Hard Disk to store data. One analogy is that the RAM is your desk and the Hard Disk is a file cabinet down the hall. Imagine having to make a few hundred trips up the hall every day because your desk is too small. The above recomendations are good (like a quality video card for actually *viewing* the movies) but for the tasks you described, make sure to get 4Gb of RAM (2Gb, if cost is a concern; but not less, or expect slowdowns)
