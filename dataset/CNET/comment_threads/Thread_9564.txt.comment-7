If you look at my motherboard in the above link it's the one plugged into slot #25.
So the one you're recommending would be plugged into slot # 27 or 28, right?
And they'd both be in use simultaneously?
Just to follow up: -I'd rather spend less money.
What's the cheapest one I could get that would work on my system with a 1600x900 monitor?
-second, will my PSU have enough juice to support 3 displays?
