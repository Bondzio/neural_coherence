<s> ok well i got a brand new geforce 6800 GT OC and when i turned my computer on my monitor is SOOO BLURRY! </s>
<s> it looks like im looking at it without my glasses on all teh words ar e messed up and eveyrthing...yesterday i messed witht he cord in the back of the monitor and noticed when its angled at a certian way the words stop being blurry but then i can see shadows of my mosue cursor,icons and stuff and its onnying...is my monitor going bad should i buy a new one? </s>
<s> and my monitor is pretty dark no matter how high brightness is </s>
<s> I recommend trying it on another monitor to see if the problem follows. </s>
<s> You did not say how your monitor worked b4 the new card. </s>
<s> If you swap parts to isolate the problem you can often narrow down the problem area to find a solution. </s>
<s> If the same prob shows on another monitor that would indicate not a monitor specific prob. </s>
<s> The same for video card, cables and drivers. </s>
<s> If you use extra video cable, reduce it to the only the orginal VGA cable, check results. </s>
<s> If the problem persists, then use that warranty NOW! </s>
<s> Of course try to adjust the monitor for best results, otherwise you have a bad monitor, maybe caused by shipping, etc. </s>
<s> Cjeck also for any bent, pushed, otherwise odd looking pins on all the VGA cable(s). </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> i already RMA'ed my video card and they sent me a brand new one againa nd its still doing it </s>
<s> You've already gotten some good suggestions, like swapping things around. </s>
<s> FWIW, I'll add the following. </s>
<s> What size monitor is it? </s>
<s> Is the video cable built-in or does it plug into the monitor? </s>
<s> When I got this 19 inch monitor I found that text was kind of blurry. </s>
<s> There was a sort of ghost effect. </s>
<s> This may be similar to what you've been seeing. </s>
<s> I can't tell. </s>
<s> The cable on this monitor is not built-in and the cable I was using was pretty lightweight and not well shielded. </s>
<s> When I replaced it with a &quot;heavy duty&quot;, shielded, video cable, the problem cleared right up. </s>
<s> If your problem started when you changed video cards, maybe the signal on the new video card isn't quite as strong as the old card or something, so you need a better cable. </s>
<s> If your video cable plugs into your monitor, you might try a new, &quot;heavy duty&quot; and shielded, video cable. </s>
<s> Especially if you have a large monitor, since they apparently require a better video signal. </s>
<s> Cables like this can be had fairly cheap. </s>
<s> I got this one on eBay for around $12 as I recall. </s>
