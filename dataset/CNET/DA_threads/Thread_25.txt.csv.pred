1.2.2	There are thousands of folk with this issue so my question is why your suppliers have left you out on the road with a dead car and no gas ?	Ques
1.2.3	As you can tell it 's rarely the same thing and the advice repeats often .	St
1.2.4	That is , start with less parts and never skimp on the PSU if you ca n't add up the Amperes and know why you get a single rail when you ca n't add it up .	St

1.3.1	I agree with Robert 's post , something is amiss and you have tear it down and get to the basics .	St
1.3.2	Recheck your work and that means tearing it down out of case .	St
1.3.3	Using cardboard , rebuild the system on it and make that a & quot ; MINIMUM SYSTEM & quot ; just what it needs to boot .	St
1.3.4	In fact you need no drives at all , see what it does upon applying power , it should at least get to the error display or try entering a bios display .	St
1.3.5	In other words , its up and running but ca n't go far but remains , & quot ; ON & quot ; .	St
1.3.6	Do n't take anything for granted and do n't be in a rush to build , check and verify it all .	St
1.3.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
