I have a case with front USB ports, but no pinout on the motherboard. I know that I could add front USB access in other ways via drive bays but was interested in using the ports already built in the front of my case. Thanks

You should be able to find one to do what you would like to do and the prices for them are pretty reasonable. So just look for a pci usb card. Just make sure you got an available pci slot on your mobo.

I've already looked at many PCI USB cards and hadn't seen the type I was talking about. Has anyone had personal experience with such so that I could get the name?
