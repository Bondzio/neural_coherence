I am looking to buy a new All-in-one style desktop. As far as I can tell most offer the same specifications in the guts of the computer, yet Hp ,while slightly underpowered, offers a touch screen and tv tuner with standard wireless keyboard and mouse. Apple on the other hand also comes standard with wireless keyboard and the new Magic mouse (which is rather nice) yet they lack the touch screen and tv capabilities offered by most other manufacturers (including blue ray player). I'm thinking I want to go with the an apple product, but I like the Touch Screen of the HP. Herein lies my problem. Should I go with a touch screen feature that I want in HP or should I buy an apple all in one now, only to have apple produce a new touch screen IMAC in the next year or so. Please offer any suggestions or correct me if my assumptions are unfounded. Thanks
