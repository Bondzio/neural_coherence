1.1.1	Ok, I have $80 from a Graphics card I sold.	St
1.1.2	And I'm going to start building a new pc.	St
1.1.3	But I have no idea which parts to start on.	St
1.1.4	I am getting a 775 slot Pentium d 3.0 ghz processor and an asrock motherboard.	St
1.1.5	But I have this $80 and I am wondering what to spend it on.	St
1.1.6	Case?	St
1.1.7	Hard drive?	St

1.1.10	thanks for the advice	Polite

1.3.1	Since you needed all these things before you can build the system, so which one is first doesn't matter.	St
1.3.2	Save your money until you are ready because a whole computer might be cheaper than getting the parts individually.	St
1.4.1	Buy what you need.	St
1.4.2	Pay more for namebrand items and if you're not thinking it, think a darn good PSU with a high wattage rating and stable outputs.	St
1.4.3	You can have the best devices in the world and a cheap PSU will take it all down.	St
1.4.4	tada -----Willy	St
1.5.1	a P4, they were overwhelmed by AMD CPU's and Intel got their butt saved when their Israli division came up with the Conroe core.	St
1.5.2	Save your money until you can get a Core 2 Duo [Conroe core].It out performs the P4's and only consumes 65 Watts, thus you can even live with a smaller case than needed to cool the P4.	St
1.6.1	im after power for money, and 1.8 dont cut it.	St
1.6.2	and isnt pentium d different to pentium 4?	St
1.7.1	clock rate to be the determinate, you have totally missed the current technology.	St
1.7.2	The architecture of the Core 2 Duo allows that lower clock rate to outperform the higher clock rates as Intel found when they madse their long instruction pipelines and couldn't cool them at the higher rates.	St
