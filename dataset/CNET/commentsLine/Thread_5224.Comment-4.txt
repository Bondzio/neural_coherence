but it costs more than $100 you mentioned see here:  if you are not as concerned with hd recording, then the wintv-pvr line is quite popular.
there are four choices of that line or there are wintv-hvr which add clear qam channels along with the sd channels.
the hd pvr ( hauppauge 1212 ) is the most all round capable choice as long as the inputs fit your needs.
it looks like you have to use component inputs for hd recording.
it has pass thru so you can intercept the signal from the stb, then on to your tv without any other changes in the connections.
