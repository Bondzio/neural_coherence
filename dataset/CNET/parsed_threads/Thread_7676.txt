<s> I have a machine with a Radeon x1300 video card in it (distributed by VisionTek). </s>
<s> It's been fine since I installed the card about a year ago, but now there's something screwy going on. </s>
<s> When using the computer, the screen will, at random, go blank and display an &quot;Out of Range&quot; error. </s>
<s> The computer continues to run, e.g. </s>
<s> while watching video, the audio will continue to play even though nothing is on screen. </s>
<s> The computer has to be hard-rebooted. </s>
<s> It's happening quite frequently. </s>
<s> Several times a day, and it's pretty much made the computer unusable. </s>
<s> I did some searching, and it's led me to believe that the video card is the issue, since a few forums have said that when a monitor gives an Out of Range without warrant, usually it means the monitor isn't getting a signal. </s>
<s> I opened the computer up, blasted some of the dust out, and started it up. </s>
<s> The fan keeps spinning when the monitor OORs, so it's not a cooling issue. </s>
<s> I also tried swapping the monitor from port one to port two on the card, and it seemed to have fixed the problem at first, but no dice. </s>
<s> It's still doing it. </s>
<s> Also note that the TV attached to the card's S-Videp out (the TV mirrors the main monitor for watching DVDs and streaming videos like Hulu) goes blank when the main monitor OORs. </s>
<s> Any ideas on what's wrong? </s>
<s> As I use this machine for watching DVDs, I'd like to find a solution. </s>
<s> Netflix can be expensive if you're unable to watch and return discs. </s>
<s> It did similar things like that. </s>
<s> After a few too many instances I replaced the card and gifted that away. </s>
<s> Never did find a cure short of replacement. </s>
<s> I took your advice and bought a new video card yesterday (an Nvidia this time), and it's working now. </s>
<s> I'll take a $100 video card over $1200 on a new computer any day... </s>
<s> I felt a little bruised over that card. </s>
<s> Maybe it was buggy after all. </s>
<s> The Radeon card lasted about a year. </s>
<s> I'm not sure how long the rest of the computer will hold together (it's about three years old, and exhibits some odd idiosyncrasies occasionally) though. </s>
<s> I seem to have bad luck with electronic devices; they always seem to fail too soon. </s>
<s> My last desktop computer failed two years after getting it... </s>
