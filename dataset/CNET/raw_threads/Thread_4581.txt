The host is not connected to the Internet or a network, but simply has it's NIC connected to a webcam via a crossover cable. This is the first &quot;network.&quot; The host also has a modem which is setup to accept incoming calls (PPP) to allow access to the host. This is the second network, when there is a connected incoming phone call. The client (the computer dialing into the host) is not connected to the Internet. The client connects to the host via its modem (28.8). Essentially, the host is in an isolated area where no Internet access is available. I want to dial into this computer and access the webcam to &quot;keep an eye on things.&quot; I can dial into the host just fine, and access Remote Desktop. I can view the webcam on the remote desktop, but its very slow as you can imagine. I cannot go to my command prompt on the client computer and ping the webcam, or access it with the viewer application. It appears that the webcam and my dialup computer are on two different networks. The host can see both networks, but the current configuration will not enable the dialup computer / client to access the webcam. This is my problem. If I can connect the client directly to the webcam via IP, the image downloads will be much more efficient because I won't have to use Remote Desktop. I ran ipconfig on both the host and the client during the dialup session. Here is the host: PPP adapter RAS Server (Dial In) Interface: Connection-specific DNS Suffix . : IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.2 Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.255 Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection: (this is NIC connected to the webcam via crossover cable) Connection-specific DNS Suffix . : IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.1 Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0 Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.0 Here is the dialup client ipconfig: PPP adapter skynet: Connection-specific DNS Suffix . : IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.3 Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.255 Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.3 The IP address of the webcam is 192.168.1.115 and its subnet is 255.255.255.0. I can access this IP address only from the host, not the dialup client. I am hoping there is a simple answer to this. I'm a certified Netware Administrator, which means I know a little bit about Netware file systems but thats about it. The reason I'm using a dial-in method is that the host computer is in a remote location in the mid-west U.S. where broadband is not available. Also, the webcam does not have a usb interface, only ethernet. Thanks for any insight you can provide. Robert

The higher the resolution on the camera equates to larger files (pictures and frame rate), which will be much slower uploading from the camera. You might try lowering the camera resolution to bare minimum. I'm on 10 Meg cable and a friend is on the same. When we use our cams the voice is perfect but the pictures are very slow. I can just imagine what it would be like on dial-up speeds. Just a thought.

In the range of 10,000 bytes per photo or less if possible. Remote Desktop actually works reasonably well with the resolution and colors turned down. I havent had a chance to try the camera, yet. Once I get this networking problem solved. Any ideas on that? Thanks
