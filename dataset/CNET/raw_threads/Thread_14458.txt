But when I try to install it, it is not even detected by the system. I booted under Linux and ran the 'lsusb' program to detect USB devices; it isn't even there. Searching has found that this printer needs an &quot;USB 2.0 cable&quot;. Can someone confirm this? Thanks!!

I find the old USB 1.1 cable to be fine even at this but then again that FRONT USB port wiring issue is why I test with rear USB ports. As to USB 2.0 cables, I gifted all my old cables away and replaced them with the 99 cent USB 2.0 cables from geeks.com or newegg.com I see no reason to keep the old cables and any issues they harbor. Best of luck, Bob
