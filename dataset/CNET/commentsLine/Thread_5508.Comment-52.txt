i had virtually the same problem approx.
14 months after buying a wd &quot;elements&quot; 640 gig external drive.
the fault started intermittently with it not rustling up and it didn't appear to be spinning when i had a close listen.
it eventually refused to work at all.
i took the beast apart and installed the actual drive in an independent external housing and it's been fine ever since.
obviously a similar interface problem and the drive itself was ok. i have since heard that wd are actually quite helpful in this regard, so it may be also worth contacting them, depending on the age of the drive.
