That points me down the correct path.
I found the following links: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/115486 http://www.wilderssecurity.com/archive/index.php/t-192426.html I suspect you are correct that installed the drivers in the wrong order.
It looks like there are registry entries I can add / modify to control the order in which the drivers get loaded.
Thanks for the pointer.
