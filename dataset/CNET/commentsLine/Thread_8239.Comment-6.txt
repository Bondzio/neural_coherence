hatim, thanks for your kind reply.
i surely wish i could place a range extender half way between the systems.
i'm sure that would solve the problem.
unfortunately i'd be placing it in the middle of 200 feet of open air where there is no electrical outlet and no weather protection for the delicate electronic equipment.
my only option would be to put the range extender next to the outside wall of the house (toward the workshop) which would place the extender about 30 feet from the system.
or, if i put the extender near the shop system it would be about 40 feet from the system and near the outside wall of the barn toward the house.
in either case the 200 feet of unobstructed air between the house and barn is the big question in my mind.
i may just have to either buy the equipment on the chance i can make it work or bury cable all the way.
thanks for your help, if you think of anything else that may help let me know...joe w...
