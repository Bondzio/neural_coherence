i own a averates laptop computer model 3300 series.
i used to access the internet via a gateway model t com speedport w 500v.
(i live in germany) last month i received a call on my wireless telephone while i was connected to the internet.
i lost the wireless connection and has not been able to reconnect to the web wireless.
some folks has told me that because my wireless telephone is from the us the signal frequency might have disrupted the gateway settings.
any suggestions??
thank you!!
