i need to replace my power supply.
thing is, i'm pretty sure the model i have isn't made anymore.
my question is - can i go with different specs?
i.e., can i go with a higher wattage?
does the input voltage/ampage need to match?
basically, what do i have to look for in the specs of a purchase so it's compatible with my tower.
i'm powering 1 hard drive, 2 rom's, audio, video card, and a floppy drive.
i've found some really good deals online but i dont want to buy something i cant use.
here's my current specs -- input rating: 115v-6a 230v-3a 50/60hz output rating: 235w (max) red +5v 23a yellow: +12v 9a white: -5v 0.5a blue: -12v 0.5a orange: +3.3v 15a purple: +5vsb 1a black: gnd gray: power good +3.3v & +5v 115w max
