IEEE1394 (Firewire) is just the means of transporting the converted video to the Mac. There have been a number of discussions about this subject recently. If you have a digital movie camera, it almost certainly has a IEEE1394 connection on it. It may also have RCA Video connections. A look at the manual may reveal that it is possible to use the camera as a analog to digital convertor. You may also want to take a look at www.canopus.com They sell analog to digital convertors that use IEEE1394 connections. P

He just didn't think he could use it that way. You should have seen the look on his face when I told him about it....Thanks again
