best buy has to offer something is certain price ranges otherwise, people(buyers) won't come-in.
westinghouse is a good brand name, but it never was a recent electronics power house.
its just another import offered branded by westinghouse, so take care and read the specs.
if possible, take one in hand and look at the model label/sticker you may find who really makes it and thus take that to the google search.
sorry, for now, price is the best virtue of the lcd.
everyone wants a cheap lcd, but if you really intend to keep it for awhile, cheap is not the way to go and pay for decent brandname out there.
if not best buy, some vendor always has a sale on some lcd.
