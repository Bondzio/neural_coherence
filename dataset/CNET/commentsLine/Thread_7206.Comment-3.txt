hmm well let me add some more info here to clarify.
the pix is setup to connect to a vpn tunnel as you mentioned, but i didn't configure it myself (it and the laptop are from my office, and i don't really want to mess with them if i can help it, or run my other traffic through it, for that reason).
yes, the majority of my wireless traffic will by my home setup, but it would be really convenient to be able to connect the vpn through it, if i could figure out how the pix fits in without routing everything else through it.
as you mentioned the belkin does not have an ability to do different subnets... is there another router that does that would enable me to set up this network a little more simply?
i did just get this and it got good reviews of range, etc (and seems to work fine) but i am considering returning it if it doesn't solve my problem without buying a 2nd router anyway, if something else exists that will work in this scenario.
is there any way to associate the pix on the other side of the router?
(i can plug it into one of the other ports on the belkin and it connects, and plug the laptop to it and get to the vpn tunnel, but then the laptop isn't wireless).
or with the other type or router you are describing, are there basically two lines coming from the modem to the router, and one goes through the pix and the other does not?
i'm having trouble visualizing that but it sounds promising.
