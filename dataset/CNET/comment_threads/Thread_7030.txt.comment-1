Hi, Wondering if anyone knows a tablet program that would allow one to write into a standard form text file questionaire that has pre-typed items then convert what is written into text?
It's for work.
Example: (pre-typed) What are a few of your favorite colors?
(In this space hoping to write below the text with a stylus): blue, green, red Then what I write gets converted to text, in he proper position: (result) What are a few of your favorite colors?
Blue, green, red
