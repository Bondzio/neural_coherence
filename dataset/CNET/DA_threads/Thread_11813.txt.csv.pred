1.1.1	I just redistributed the free space on my hard drive for one partition via Norton partition magic .	St
1.1.2	Switching originally with 130 gb to 250 gb ( the size of the drive ) because well ... . no one really wants to get only half what they pay for .	St
1.1.3	So , merging the unallocated space I combined the two to make one partition .	St
1.1.4	Doing this i noticed that boot time took exceptionally long .	St
1.1.5	( 8 minutes almost . )	St
1.1.6	So what I ' am asking is by me merging the two make windows take forever to boot ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks , Jack Hanington	St
1.2.1	Lets say your PC came with Windows XP .	St
1.2.2	Since XP 's boot manager did n't support over 127GB in the boot drive , you could have later installed SP2 then expanded it and tripped over this nugget .	St
1.2.3	More at http : //www.48bitlba.com that notes this issue with & quot ; Windows XP. & quot ; Sorry if this does not apply to your machine but you did n't tell all the details .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	partitioned and formatted the unused space and moved some of all of the data to D : ?	Ques
1.3.2	Much better that way for me as thereafter you can do pretty much anything you want with C : leaving my data intact on D : ... if the drive dies or fails mechanically , there 's no advantage .	St
1.3.3	But if C : becomes corrupt or wo n't boot ... I can re-image C : , restore or reinstall C : without touching D : .	St
1.3.4	For me , partitioning provides the ounce of separation for broader alternatives solving problems with drive C : .	St
1.3.5	Re booting ... should n't increase booting VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	Sorry Bob , I have a 250 GB drive and the computer was originally installed with XP Pro SP2 .	St
1.4.2	No problems when it was installed .	St
1.4.3	This might be true on the other versions .	St
1.4.4	You might want to look into it a bit further .	St
