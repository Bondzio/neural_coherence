Of course all connections MUST be done and in proper place. If this has been done and it still refuses to work, you have a secondary problem. When the PSU failed it *may have* taken down another device/component and refuses to boot or power-ON. If HD or CD dreive, etc., replace and hope it continues to work. However, if the mtrbd. is zapped, then consider another to replace it. In most cases, fixing the mtrbd. won't be practical or becomes troublesome as time goes on, of course this depends on your repair abilities. If so, eliminate any device/compotent before installing on new mtrbd.. tada -----Willy

8235	3	404867	3352064	3351945	Willy	8/5/10 8:48 AM	1.28099808E12	Final tests	Remove *everything* on the mtrbd. leave only the spkr. attached. and assure the PSU is connected. Power-ON, it should beep away in some form or fashion. If it doesn't then the mtrbd. is truly gone. If it does beep, then return the cpu and HSF, remount and test, it should still beep but in some pattern. Connect video and so on, one item at a time and test each time for results and the beep pattern. The bios beep code will determine if or anything is related to missing device, etc., but it may not and that could be the problem area. If possible, test other devices elsewhere to verify them. Also, take the time when everything is missing, to inspect closely the mtrbd. for blown, bulging, etc. &quot;bad caps&quot;, google for examples. tada -----Willy
