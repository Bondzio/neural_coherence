All, I am looking at the following PC and I just wanted to know what people think of these specs.
I do not need a beast or anything like that.
Rather, I want to be able to play all the current titles on at least medium-high settings with a decent FPS.
Needs to be able to play World In Conflict, Crysis: Warhead and Warhammer.
I have to go through Dell, so please let me know if you think any parts of this are sub par or going to give me trouble (rather than suggesting I use a different company).
Thanks!
