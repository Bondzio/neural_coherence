thanks bob!
is this the link you are referring to in your post?
if so then how many routers can i daisy chain in this manner?
can i add a third router as a access point?
so, linksys #1 n @ 5mhz linksys #2 n @ 2.4mhz airlink #3 g @ 2.4mhz would this set up be possible without too much interference?
or should i just drop the airlink and focus on the two linksys?
thank you once again bob..looking forward to your reply..
