<s> NTFS - FAT32 - partition/format I recently installed a 2nd HD (80 gig - non formatted/non partitioned - as of yet)...my original system is running XP on a 40 gig FAT32... 1. </s>
<s> Is it in my best interest to convert the FAT32 to NTFS...and format/partition the new 80 gig to NTFS or run the 40 as is and run the 80 as NTFS? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> When/if I convert the FAT32 to NTFS, should I just use the XP convert ''tool'' since I have the OS/programs/files on the drive? </s>
<s> Or should I backup the drive and format? </s>
<s> Benefits/Drawbacks? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> I am in search of a way (if possible) to backup my operating system and programs so I do not have to reinstall everything from scatch...(if not the best idea...suggestions?) </s>
<s> Background Information: System will eventually have an external HD to use as a backup of drive #2, while drive #1 strictly runs OS and Program files. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
