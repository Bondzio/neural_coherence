<s> I have XP installed in my Intel Macbook Pro in the separate partition created by boot camp. </s>
<s> Recently while I was running on XP the computer crashed badly and XP system seemed to have been damaged and I can't boot as XP anymore. </s>
<s> I would like to simply erase the XP partition and merge it with the main drive. </s>
<s> But the problem is that Boot Camp got expired and I can't use the application to do that. </s>
<s> Can anyone tell me how I can do that?? </s>
<s> I am guessing that Disk Utility would be the one to use but I want to make sure I know what I am doing before I screw up anything... </s>
<s> Please help!! </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> DA </s>
<s> Check this Apple Article and you will probably say &quot;why didn't I think of that?&quot; I know I did Good Luck P </s>
<s> Duh... </s>
<s> Thanks so much for the link. </s>
<s> I can't believe it was that simple... DA </s>

<s> Of course, if you DID want to reinstall XP this trick should work as well. </s>
<s> Set the clock back, remake the partition, install XP and go back to work. </s>
<s> Hi To merge a windows partition that has already had the windows os removed. </s>
<s> Goto on your mac partition utilities &gt;&gt; Disk Rtility then click the windows partition. </s>
<s> Click Erase tab and select &quot;MS-DOS(FAT)&quot; and name it untitled. </s>
<s> Then goto Bootcamp and the installer will allow you to erase partition and merge it with exsisting Mac osX Partition. </s>
<s> WARNING: ALWAYS MAKE A BACKUP BEFORE MERGING, FORMATING OR INSTALLING AN OS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE PARTITION. </s>
