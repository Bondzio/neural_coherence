1.1.1	I am looking for an old Gateway 2000 desktop computer , preferrably with Windows 98 .	St
1.1.2	MUST have a Telepath II ( 14,400 ) modem and the Faxworks program that came with the computer .	St
1.1.3	Does n't have to look great ; just run so I can replay some old sentimental voicemails of a deceased family member .	St
1.1.4	For what it 's worth , the one I had was a Pentium 75 with about 64mbs of RAM and a 720 mb hard drive .	St
1.1.5	Does n't have to match those numbers necessarily .	St
1.1.6	Any suggestions ? ?	Ques
1.1.7	?	Ques
1.2.1	I need to wonder why you need a computer to play old voicemail messages .	St
1.2.2	If you have them stored on some media , it would seem there could be other options .	St
1.3.1	Well , I would 've thought so too since they are simple voice recordings , but so far I can not find anything to play or convert the files That is my end goal ; to convert the files to MP3 so they can copied onto a CD & amp ; played in any CD player .	St
1.3.2	I have limited knowledge of such things but done a fair amount of research and ca n't seem to find another solution .	St
1.3.3	At this point , it seems easiest to try & amp ; go back to the original setup with Windows 98 and Faxworks .	St
1.3.4	I have the files on CD ( along with an installed version of Faxworks ) and also on my hard drive .	St
1.3.5	Each .VMF file has a sister .CTL file .	St
1.3.6	Two files with the same name , just different file extensions .	St
1.3.7	Thanks for your interest !	St
1.4.1	and were answered by one of the most knowledgeable people here .	St
1.4.2	His advice was to do as you are asking here .	St
1.4.3	About all I can find is a suggestion that something called & quot ; Iwave Media Player & quot ; can handle that format .	St
1.4.4	It also seems that the extension is n't unique to the voice mail program mentioned .	St
1.4.5	I 've found plenty of hits using google to search for converter programs for that format but none seem like solid leads .	St
1.4.6	My guess is that you may have already explored many of these sites already .	St
1.4.7	I do n't think I can offer much help here but thought knowing the file format might be useful .	St
1.4.8	Good luck in your efforts anyway .	Polite
1.5.1	Do you have any leads on this Iwave Media Player ?	Ques
1.5.2	I think tried searching for that too , to no avail .	St
1.5.3	It seems like a lot of hits on Google lead to nonexistant websites or have changed since the introduction of the inet wave player .	St
1.5.4	However , someone , somewhere should have an archive of such things I would think they we we use data storage and archives .	St
1.5.5	Thanks again for your interest .	St
1.5.6	If you come accross anything that will help , please keep me in mind .	St
1.5.7	P.S .	St
1.5.8	I think it was suggested to try a Google 's virtual machine ( or virtual box ? ? )	Ques
1.5.9	or something to that effect .	St
1.5.10	Is this something you 'd agree could work ?	Ques
1.6.1	I just bought a computer from a gentleman that lied to me ... . he said it was 8 years old but it is older..and a 2000 because i found stuff on it that was from 2000 ... .. not 2004 .	St
