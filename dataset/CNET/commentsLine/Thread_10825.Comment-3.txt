trying the drive on another pc.
if it fails there also, it's time to disassemble it to find out if the failure is caused by the drive or by the enclosure (that are the two parts, roughly speaking).
if it works there and not on your pc, try it on another usb-port and try another external disk also.
taken together, you'll get a much better picture of the problem than you've got now.
i assume you tried a power-down/reboot on this pc already as the first thing, of course.
