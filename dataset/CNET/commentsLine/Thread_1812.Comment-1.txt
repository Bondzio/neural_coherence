anyone i am a very beginner.
this is the first time.
i am trying to install a 2nd drive with the old drive.
the old drive is a western digital, i think, a 5 pin jumper selection.
my new drive is maxtor.
i've been trying to find out the jumper settings for the old drive.
there is one jumper on the old drive on 1-2 pins.
i want to set the old drive to cs, cable select.
i really don't wish take the old drive out if i don't have to.
all i have about the old drive is that it is 40gb, ultra dma hd, 5-pin, by western digital.
i don't understand much of the language or what they are talking about at western digital site.
or anywhere else for that matter.
i would appreciate any help anyone has to offer.
thanks ron
