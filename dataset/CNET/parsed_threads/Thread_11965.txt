<s> I am having some trouble setting up a network for my neightbor. </s>
<s> Both computers are running XP.one home one pro. </s>
<s> I ahve gone through the network setup wizard on both of them. </s>
<s> I dont know which configuration to choose so i just picked one. </s>
<s> I think it was the defalut that comes up. </s>
<s> I entered in all of the info and it said it was done and that I ahd to restart. </s>
<s> so i did. </s>
<s> i also did this on the other which connects via 802.11b. </s>
<s> I went to My Network Places and tried to view the workgroup computers. </s>
<s> Each time i received a dialog box that said I couldn't access the network. </s>
<s> It said that a server hadn't been secified. </s>
<s> The internet works fine on both of them by the way. </s>
<s> I have done other posts in the past and i have not provided enough info. </s>
<s> if you need anymore. </s>
<s> please let me know. </s>
<s> name, they both should be the same. </s>
<s> Turn off the firewalls until the LAN is working. </s>
<s> &quot;It said that a server hadn't been secified&quot; This sounds suspiciously like a Domain had been set. </s>
<s> the workgroup names are both the same. </s>
<s> I pretty sure that I didn't set up a domain in the first place. </s>
<s> just a refresher put what is the domain again. </s>
<s> on the Computer name tab your workgroup name or the Domain you belong to will be shown. </s>
<s> If a Domain name is listed you can change by clicking the Change button and switch to a workgroup. </s>
<s> well in order to do that you would have to be able to view the workgroup computers right. </s>
<s> (i think) well thats when i get the error message. </s>
<s> it comes up when i click &quot;view workgroup computers.&quot; I came home and i did what you have just explained wheere your click on the name and click on properties so i think i know what your saying. </s>
<s> i am going over to their house tomorrow to look at it again </s>
