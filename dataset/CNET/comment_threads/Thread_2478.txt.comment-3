Copy it at the store and see if the store model does ok or not.
Remember that color copiers do not make color accurate copies.
I will not embark on the lessons about color copiers, color calibration (look up Pantone Spyders), paper and even why this is so.
But expectations of a color accurate copy are usually dashed.
