<s> bought a new deskstar from hitachi 500gb SATA and when i go and try partition and format it doesn't work i get this error --------------------------- Logical Disk Manager --------------------------- The path cannot be used for creating a drive path likely because the folder does not exist or is already a drive path to some other volume. </s>

<s> You stop Remote Storage Server? </s>
<s> Did you try setting it to Disabled, reboot and try again? </s>
<s> idk if i am suppose to have that service because i don't but i did look in my system event logs and it said virtual disk service may fix it so i restarted nothing happend this is leading me to think its my system more and more </s>
<s> But if you are not checking, looking then what am I to do? </s>
<s> If you don't find the service, tell us so we can look for other possibles. </s>
<s> well i thought i made myself clear with that explanation but i dont have that service and i think thats because i'm not using windows server 2003 </s>
<s> I do not have the time to find the same article rewritten for Vista, XP and so on. </s>
<s> If you must have that then I have to say I'm sorry and try some other troubleshooting tactic. </s>
<s> Let's try this. </s>
<s> Share the services that are currently running. </s>
<s> Here's how. </s>
<s> Run CMD and use the NET START command then post the results here. </s>

<s> Try this. </s>
<s> Boot Safe Mode command prompt and use the DISKPART command line. </s>
<s> If that's too rough or hard, boot SAFE MODE and try it there. </s>

<s> well i would try the dispart but i do not know the commands and do not have ink in my printer to print the commands out i tried the safe mode and nothing same errors as in normal windows boot wondering if i have it format in another computer can it work once i do that in my current pc </s>
<s> Move the drive to another machine and partition it there. </s>
<s> DISKPART commands are DOCUMENTED on the web. </s>
<s> It's not hard to use and the only issue could be you forget to select the right drive. </s>
<s> With no disrespect intended I think its best to learn the OS you are using even if one command at a time. </s>
<s> My guess is it's the software installed after the OS that is at play here unless there is flighty hardware. </s>
<s> One member revealed the drive had been dropped after we went through all the steps. </s>
