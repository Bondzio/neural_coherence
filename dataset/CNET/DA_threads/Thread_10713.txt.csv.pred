1.1.1	I would need help on the following problem: One of these scenarios can happen Scenario 1: During boot my HDD is not recognized and the boot sequence finishes with 'Ultra100 Bios not installed, because there are no drivers attached' Scenario 2: However sometimes the HDD is recognised and the PC powers up and starts Win2000 as normal.	St
1.1.2	Everthing is running fine for a while until suddenly the HDD stops to 'operate' and the PC 'crashes' and subsequently returns to scenario 1.	St
1.1.3	Firstly I am puzzled why I get this Ultra100 message because no controller Ultra100 is actually inserted in one of the PCI slots.	St
1.1.4	Secondly I wonder why the HDD is sometimes detected and the other time not.	St
1.1.5	During the faulty boot sequence I've also received the message 'check cables' - which I did but with no idea what to do - everything looked fine to me.	St
1.1.6	Listening to the HDD it sounds like it sometimes simple stops 'turning' the disk.	St
1.1.7	My motherboard is a Asus Cubx-E with a primary master / slave and secondary master / slave.	St
1.1.8	Please note: I am not a Hardware Person - but I understand what to do if the answer is not written in techy language.	St
1.1.9	Are my bios settings screwed??	St
1.1.10	(and why what that be - have not made any amendments to hard- or software - problem occured out of the blue).	St
1.1.11	Your help is appreciated.	St
1.2.1	Are my bios settings screwed??	St
1.2.2	Not unless you changed them.	St
1.2.3	Presume this just started happening.	St
1.2.4	Look to a power problem and, or possibly controller / drive fault.	St
1.2.5	Do the standard things like run an external fan on the open case and see if it runs longer before a fault - could be drive cooling.	St
1.2.6	Remove unecessary devices and see if it runs longer (less power consumption) Check the connections - both sides - drive and at controller and controller and PCI slot.	St
1.2.7	Try changing slots if necessary which will require re-installing drivers etc.	St
1.2.8	Back everything you need ASAP	St
1.3.1	Thanks a lot for this prompt reply.	St
1.3.2	A lot of ideas - I will start checking what you have suggested in the next couple of days and come back letting you know what the situation is.	St
1.3.3	Your support is appreciated.	St
