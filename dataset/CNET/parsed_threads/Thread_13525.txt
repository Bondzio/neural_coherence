<s> I was wondering if i could play blu-ray in windows vista media center. </s>
<s> I know i can play it with the supplied software and i got sonys $200 blu-ray drive. </s>
<s> but i wanted to use vistas. </s>
<s> Im using a barebones shuttle pc with vista home prem, core quad, radion 2600hd with hdmi and i know every complies with hdcp. </s>
<s> If you've done your research you'll find &quot;It's up to these developers to determine whether the environment they have set up will meet the environment criteria the &quot;content owners&quot; impose on manufacturers. </s>
<s> So that probably no next-gen playback for Vista out of the box. </s>

<s> Ohhkayy, that puts more closure on that, i didnt think you could. </s>
<s> Ive read alot from mags awhile back (when hd-dvd was still selling) that you couldnt, but was kinda hoping that its changed since then.. </s>
<s> You could change out the drive and I see that the cost of BLU RAY drives has dropped significantly over the past couple of months. </s>
<s> It is like being between a rock and a hardplace, HD, then BLU RAY, what to do. </s>
<s> Geez, look at the price of BLU RAY disks! </s>
