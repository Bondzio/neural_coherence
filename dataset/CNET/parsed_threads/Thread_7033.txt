<s> I have recently replaced my old Wi Fi routers. </s>
<s> One was actually running as a router, the other as an access point in another part of the house, with a Cat 5 connection between the two. </s>
<s> I couldn't decide what to buy so I ended up getting a Belkin Wireless N and a D-Link DIR-655. </s>
<s> Both have had some good reviews. </s>
<s> The D-Link is functioning as a wireless router, the Belkin is configured to be a wireless access point. </s>
<s> They are on non-overlapping channels (D-Link is on Channel 11 primary, paired with Channel 6 secondary and Belkin is on Channel 1). </s>
<s> My wife complains that her laptop (Vista Home Premium, 802.11 b or g capable) feels sluggish since the change. </s>
<s> The other PCs, either wired or wireless, have not felt different to me, and I don't use her laptop enough to have an opinion. </s>
<s> Most of the time she is logged on to the Belkin access point and is the only device attached to it. </s>
<s> My laptop (Win 7, 802.11 b, g or n capable) connects to the D-Link. </s>
<s> It is possible that she is encountering interference from a neighbor or it is possible that one of the wireless devices is functioning below specs or other problems may be coming up. </s>
<s> Unfortunately I no longer have the old WiFi access device she used up until recently because I gave it to my Father-in-Law so I can't do direct measured comparisons of speed and I cannot easily check which channel the old one operated on. </s>
<s> This raises several questions: Is there any good way to determine whether the apparent sluggishness comes from things outside our house, the access point, the router, her computer, or a source between keyboard and chair? </s>
<s> Is it possible to determine which wireless protocol she is actually using (as opposed to which protocols are available)? </s>
<s> Is there any easy way to figure out what channel the neighbor's WiFi is using to see if interference seems likely? </s>
<s> From other readings in these forums, it does seem that mixing wireless &quot;g&quot; with &quot;n&quot; and expecting smooth fallback isn't realistic. </s>
<s> You might try to temporarily lock your wireless on &quot;g&quot; to see if the complaints stop. </s>
<s> I believe you can use windows &quot;tracert&quot; to determine the connection path of your wife's PC just to make sure she's connecting through the desired device. </s>
<s> As for network finders/sniffers, etc., I believe such as &quot;netstumbler&quot; might assist in determining who else is broadcasting locally, at what signal strength, and what channels are in use. </s>
<s> There are only 2 802.11n devices in the house, and they usually use the same router. </s>
<s> The other laptop doesn't have the 'n' protocol and it uses the other router. </s>
<s> The problem did improve some when I reconfigured the router my wife is using. </s>
<s> It turns out that the Belkin unit I bought prefers to have the connection to the network on the WAN port when it is set up as a Wireless Access Point. </s>
<s> That is different from any other router I've set up that way. </s>
