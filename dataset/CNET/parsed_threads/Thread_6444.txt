<s> Do I have to wait for a manufacturer to validate a new processor with their board for it to work? </s>
<s> I want to get the Intel Core 2 Duo E7200 Wolfdale processor but it only came out last month and has not been validated with my board yet. </s>
<s> Will I have to wait for validation by the board manufacturer? </s>
<s> Other processors with similar specs work with this board as is. </s>
<s> Here is the response from Gigabyte: hello, core 2 duo E7200 wolfdale with 3 MB cache is new still under validation may need bios update to support cpu ID code please check back with us a week later or keep an eye on this web for cpu support list after validation will listed in there : http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Support/Motherboard/CPUSupport_Model.aspx?ProductID=2714 </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> your mobo already supports 1333mhz processors. </s>
<s> you might have to manually set the 1333 fsb if the mobo doesn't. </s>
<s> gigabyte will release a bios update soon which will detect the processor if necessary. </s>
<s> It's best to wait, afterall you do want it to work. </s>
<s> The mtrbd. </s>
<s> support probably will issue a bios update and w/o that you're stuck at some lower level and thus no 100% benefit from the new cpu installed if it works at all. </s>
<s> IF you have a problem then everyone in the loop expect you has an excuse. </s>
<s> Effectively they'll blame you for rushing the issue as it wasn't proven yet, so they can back out of any &quot;warranty&quot; because you went in too soon. </s>
