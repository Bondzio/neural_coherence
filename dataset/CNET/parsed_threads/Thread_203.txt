<s> I've recently signed up for dsl service. </s>
<s> Included in my self installation kit was a Siemens SpeedStream 4100. </s>
<s> However, it's functionality seems to be crippled; the thing doesn't seem to have an option to block or reconfigure ports. </s>
<s> Is this limitation a firmware &quot;feature&quot; set by the ISP? </s>
<s> I know that this particular modem has a much larger range of configurable options than what is being shown when I try to access the settings. </s>
<s> So here's my main question. </s>
<s> Do I have to use this modem to receive internet service? </s>
<s> Or can I go out and buy a different, fully functional, DSL modem? </s>
<s> Also, if I am indeed to suffer with this modem, is there any way to access the full features of this thing? </s>
<s> Many thanks in advance : ) </s>
<s> Units they allow. </s>
<s> The list will be from them. </s>
<s> Most will look over the DSL modem+router to see if it can be configured to it's modem only mode and add a router. </s>
<s> But that's your choice. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> So I should put the modem in bridge mode, go get a router and hook it up to the modem? </s>
<s> How exactly can I get the modem into bridge mode? </s>
<s> Can I get some details at exactly what bridge mode is? </s>
<s> I do need to buy a wireless router anyways, as I have more than one computer that's needing internet at the same time. </s>
<s> Also. </s>
<s> If I went out and got the exact same modem directly from a retailer instead of through ATT/Yahoo, will I be able to use it to it's fullest capabilities? </s>
<s> Thanks a bunch, I know these questions are pretty basic and tedious in nature, and I really appreciate the help : ) </s>
<s> Just try google.com Bob </s>
<s> The useless thing didn't come with a manual. </s>
<s> Googled it and found what I was looking for. </s>
<s> So if I hook up a wireless router to the modem in bridge mode I'll be able open and close ports? </s>
<s> Go to modems GUI 192.168.0.1 Go to advanced tab Then go to PPP location Then choose, set modem in bridge modem that's it If it ask for a code, it is under the modem in a yellow sticker And as I know the modem is not crpted, the only code is that, and as i told you is under the modem, somehow if you want to block ports, or wireless connection I suggest the router option or buy a 2wire with ATT (is a modem/router/firewall , all in one) this will also works </s>
<s> I have a customer that recieved his modem from SBC and I need to have him open port 5631 and 5632 for PCAnywhere and SBC's support tell him that they are open but they are not. </s>
<s> I googled and downloaded the manual for this but it is not the software that SBC had him install and the logon is not the same. </s>
<s> Does anyone know how to open these ports from the SBC installation. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> As long as I know, ATT or SBC just block the port-25 all other ports are open, maybe the firewall on computer is blocking it </s>
<s> That is great information as SBC was saying the same thing, almost always when I can not remotely get in with PCAnywhere once I have their IP address it means that the ports are blocked. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help! </s>
