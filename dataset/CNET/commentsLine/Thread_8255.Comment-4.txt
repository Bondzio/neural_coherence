you're welcome the adaptec enclosures seem to dissipate heat well ... so while a fan might help...they don't appear to be necessary.
the key is the enclosure is well constructed, it lets you see and use the entire drive capacity (which many enclosure don't) and it's comptable the systems you connect it to.
the specs on many enclosures don't even address the maximum drive capacity in gbs.
based on the posts i see here..there seem to be an unusually high number of maxtor externals failing.
can't tell from the posts whether it's the drives or the enclosures themselves failing.
it certainly pays to handle them with care.
