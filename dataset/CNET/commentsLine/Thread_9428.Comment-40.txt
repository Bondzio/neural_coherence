anytime after a year it ''can'' be time to upgrade to a new system.
although we have built thousands of pc's and servers (combined) over the years, i still use an amd 1.4g, 512mb/pc2100, 40gx2/raid0, 46g/slave, cd burner, ati ''original'' radeon 64mbddr, along with floppy/etc.
and many usb components running win2kpro.
it performs comparably with many new systems that are supposed to be ''much faster'' and are 1.5 to 2 times as many mhz.
other setup: intel 850mhz/512 cache slot1, 512mb/pc133, 40g, cd burner, ati ''original'' radeon 32mbddr, along with a floppy/etc.
and many usb components running win2kpro.
still faster than most celeron systems below 1.7. it's all in quality parts and proper configuration.
by the end of this year, the new version (all different combos available in the usa) of windows will (supposed to be) released.
it's wise to avoid any use of the new product until a minimum of 9 months has passed.
although bragged up to be so great, there are major areas of weaknesses that need to be strengthened between the hardware manufacturers and ms. sit back and wait a year...........besides the new windows is a resource hog and will need a big power supply along with some heavy-hitting hardware to operate for what it is intended( a 400w or higher power supply, ''minimum'' 512mb fast memory; preferably 1g, ''minimum'' 128mb videocard; preferably 256mb, at least 64 bit cpu).
this is top-end gear that is being recommended for the ''average'' home user.
here's an example of an inexpensive (you should note that any quality, high-midrange to high-end systems are not cheap anymore) system that should last you long enough (maybe another 3-5 years, who knows) to upgrade and not break the bank yet still have a screamin' demon system: asus a8n5x socket 939 nvidia nforce4 atx amd motherboard $63.90 amd athlon 64 3200+ venice 1ghz fsb 512kb l2 cache socket 939 processor - retail $168.00 ocz el platinum revision 2 1gb (2 x 512mb) 184-pin ddr sdram unbuffered ddr 400 (pc 3200) dual channel kit system memory - retail $166.44 seagate nl35 st3250823ns 250gb 7200 rpm 8mb cache serial ata150 hard drive $125.00 sapphire 100106sr-rd radeon x850xt 256mb 256-bit gddr3 pci express x16 video card - retail $199.00 a ''minimum'' power supply (in my reasoning): reliable 400 watt dual 12v rail atx12v 2.01 power supply with 20 and 24-pin connectors startech.com id: atx2power400 as low as $46.95 $769.29 not including s/h and some misc.
hardware... (i figured you needed to get a glimpse of a decent midrange power pc base component profile)...... toss in an inwin or enlight case (with a front intake fan/extra rear/exhaust fan), cd burner(lite-on), dvd burner(lite-on), extra hard drive if you wish, your ''old'' floppy (and burner if you would rather instead of purchasing a new one), ''maybe'' a plug-in soundcard, extra usb/firewire ports and (although i still prefer win2kpro-stable, stable, stable os) a copy of win xp pro.
this system would be stable (well matched/compatible components), fast and dependable(quality components).
in fact,i may just use these same specs to build my daughter's new system!!!!!!!!
