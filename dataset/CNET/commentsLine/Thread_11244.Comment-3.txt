i got the xp pro from the goodwill, i thought they're trying to pull a fast one.
it appears to be an oem xp release.
i can buy another xp pro oem release or the coa license which is &quot;suppose&quot; to be allowable to add xp to another system, but as i said before, i didn't get an answer to my question as i see it.
basically, i would save $ if coa but hassles i deal with all the time, its just be my hassle.
it appears, i leaning to another oem purchase and use the auctioned cd as toolbox backup for files or whatnots.
&quot;sigh&quot; thanks robert -----willy
