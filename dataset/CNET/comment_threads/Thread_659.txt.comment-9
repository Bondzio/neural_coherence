Just bought it last week.
Have similar problem, monitor would not wake up when on DVI connection &quot;Signal not detected!&quot; comes up and that's it.
Had to reset the computer every time.
Works fine on VGA/D-sub connection, but resolution no good.
Here is the response from Spectre support - so there you have it: Dear Customer,That means your video card is not compatible with the monitor.
You'll need to change your video card or use the VGA connection.
You can also try updating the video card drivers to see if that makes any difference.Best Regards, Sceptre Technical Support Group ...Like which one should I buy??
?...so it's not a bargain after all.
