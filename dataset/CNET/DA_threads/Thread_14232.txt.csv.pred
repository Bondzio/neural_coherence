1.1.1	HI , I just purchased a Western Digital Hard drive ( WD Caviar SE 80GB ) .	St
1.1.2	I want to use it as a second hard drive to install Linux on it .	St
1.1.3	Once I connected everything and I am starting my computer windows home edition does n't boot .	St
1.1.4	The Computer also does n't see the new Hard Drive ? ?	Ques
1.1.5	Bios : p4vma-m	St
1.2.1	That would be my initial quiestion to things .	St
1.2.2	Also , how do you plan on controlling which O/S will boot ?	Ques
1.2.3	Some people use utilities for this though I think one could use the BIOS settings to change this .	St
1.2.4	Regards , JB	St
1.3.1	It 's Sata so I do not need any jumpers .	St
1.3.2	I did n't get as far as installing linux .	St
1.3.3	The system is hanging as soon as I connect my hard drive ...	St
1.4.1	I Have a Sata drive and had a lot off issues with it .	St
1.4.2	But when I installed the correct drivers , and set all the settings inside Bios every thing worked fine .	St
1.4.3	I also had a second operating system on one off the 3 hard drives I have in my system .	St
1.4.4	To get to my second hard drive with the XP on it or what ever , I had to go inside ( Bios ) and then inside off ( Advanced Bios Features ) and make a change from ( HDD 0 ) To ( SCSI ) or HDD 1 , HDD2 , HDD3 .	St
1.4.5	Thats how you access your second operating system on your other hard drive .	St
1.4.6	( A lot OFF Fun ) Good Luck Wendell H	St
1.5.1	I made all kind of changes with bios , but windows does n't boot properly .	St
1.5.2	It ishanging right in the beginning ?	Ques
1.6.1	Some settings could be wrong inside Bios or you may have somthing wrong with your operating system .	St
1.6.2	Inside Bios there is a settings that will set you back to Load fail-safe default settings or Load optimized default settings .	St
1.6.3	You could try either one off them , and if that does not work you may have to reinstall windows .	Sug
1.6.4	Good Luck Wendell H	St
