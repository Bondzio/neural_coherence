&quot;would you recommend getting that ram thats sold that comes in pairs thats made for dual channel?&quot; again, no one will tell you with any warranty that this will fix that.
but i think you just answered your question.
i will share that i see a lot of those type machines.
i have to set the fsb from 266 to 200 or 133 to 100 mhz and often the machine stabilizes.
many cry out saying it will run slower, but random reboots or lockups seem pretty slow to me.
in short, why isn't there a warranty on this machine or its parts?
call the suppliers.
