<s> I have a Leadtek Winfast TV 2000 XP Deluxe tuner and wonder if I can watch digital cable TV with it. </s>
<s> I have Comcast basic cable service, and it seems to be digital. </s>
<s> Now, is there is any way to watch digital cable TV? </s>
<s> I'm new to it and will appreciate any support. </s>
<s> My PC configuration: AMD Athlon 5200 Dual Core Motherboard Gigabyte GA-M57SLI-S4 RAM 2gb HDD 750Gb Nvidia 8600 GT WinXP Pro SP2 32bit </s>
<s> The analog channels work just fine. </s>
<s> Bob Yes, I have comacastic </s>
<s> but the basic cable usually does not have any digital channels. </s>
<s> Even if it did, the digital channels are usually above the channels that you can get without a cable box. </s>
<s> Our basic cable stops around channel 70-75, which are analog. </s>
<s> The basic package and the analog channels MATCH one for one except for the on demand items. </s>
