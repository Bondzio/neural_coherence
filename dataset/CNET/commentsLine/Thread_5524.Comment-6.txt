i guess we can discuss this at length.
what do you need to know to go get the latest drivers?
it's a very common issue which i solve daily by installing such.
i find many want to discuss why this happens.
sorry, but i'd rather just fix it and move on.
if the latest doesn't fix it then we drill down to less common issues.
your choice here.
