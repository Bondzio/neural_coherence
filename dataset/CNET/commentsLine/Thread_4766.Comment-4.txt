i looked on the maxtor site and did not see a driver and i looked on the asus site and got the same result.
i did a search on the net and found a maxblaster, but that looks like a utility not a driver.
i thought i had found something, but now my 160g maxtor 6v160eo drive is showing up as a 149g scsi.
