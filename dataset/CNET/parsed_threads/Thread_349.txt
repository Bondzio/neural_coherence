<s> I have what I think is a tough question to answer. </s>
<s> Is it possible to wirelessly link two networks together? </s>
<s> Here is the situation: Network 1 - 2 desktops & Laptop(with wireless) hooked up to a Belkin Wirelss G Router/Gateway which is hooked up to Comcast Internet. </s>
<s> Network 2 - 2 desktops hooked up to a Netgear Wireless G Router/Gateway. </s>
<s> I would like the two networks to be able to share internet, files, and be able to play games. </s>
<s> The distance between the two networks is at max 50 feet. </s>
<s> But there is ABSOLUTELY NO way to wire the networks together as they are across a hallway. </s>
<s> If this can not be done, some suggestions on how to make the situation better would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Also I don't really want to buy wireless cards for the two desktops on network 2. </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>
<s> That's called a wireless bridge and the only mistake I see is that you may be attempting this with a wifi router. </s>
<s> If said router has bridge capability that's fine but imagine if it doesn't. </s>
<s> Hint. </s>
<s> WIRELESS BRIDGE on google.com Layout hint: LAN -&gt; Wireless bridge --- (air) --- Wireless Bridge -&gt; other LAN. </s>

<s> Speaking of wireless bridges ... </s>
<s> I have a situation where we're trying to set up a wireless network in a SINGLE ROOM because the architectural geniuses who designed the place put the cable jack in a spot surrounded by TWO DOORS so it would be borderline impossible to run ethernet cable to the 2nd workstation. </s>
<s> Now, the 2nd workstation itself is a desktop machine without any open PCI slots so we've been trying to use various USB wireless network adapters that seem to cause all SORTS of lovely driver-related lockup issues (to say nothing of severely complicating reloading Windows on the 2nd machine). </s>
<s> I had been looking at potentially using a wireless bridge (I guess some of them are called &quot;gaming adapters&quot;?) </s>
<s> so that the 2nd machine can be connected to the network via its built-in ethernet port (which performed well when previously connected to a wired ethernet network at another location). </s>
<s> Questions - has anyone tried this configuration? </s>
<s> Does anyone have a wireless bridge they have had luck with? </s>
<s> (There seem to be lots and lots of wireless network adapters but very few wireless bridges.) </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Please follow my suggestion of what to type into google.com since I don't duplicate ready web content. </s>

<s> I read your post and that is sort of what I was thinking needed to be done. </s>
<s> Unfortunately the routers are not bridges, so I'll need to buy two bridges it looks like. </s>
<s> I was wondering if you have any experience with bridges and know what brands are any good? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Linksys, dlink, etc. </s>
<s> Some routers can be a bridge and that wrt54 series if it doesn't might be coerced if we install other firmware. </s>
<s> I'll note where it is so you can see if it has a bridge mode. </s>
