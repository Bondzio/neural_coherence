I have the cable modem connected to the router (Belkin N+) in the living room and there is a wall ethernet jack. I connected the router to the ethernet jack and that goes to my wire closet and is connected to a 5 port switch (Linksys 10/100). The switch is then connected to 4 other ethernet lines that goes to other wall jacks in the house. The problem is that when I plug in a computer to the wall jack, it recognize that there's a signal but no internet or assigning of IP address. Any help would be appreciated.

With all devices connected, power back up in this order: Router - wait for the lights to stabilize. Switch - wait for the lights to stabilize. PC. If you decide to move the PC, you may have to do the above steps again. For some reason, some systems and routers do not take well to disconnects and reconnects. The key word is &quot;may&quot; as once the PC is assigned an IP address, it may be able to move around as needed.

If these are not of the &quot;auto-sensing&quot; type or the Linksys doesn't have a dedicated or switchable uplink, you need to use a crossover cable to connect the two.
