Hello, I have a Linksys WRT54GL v. 1.1 that has been dropping connection speed (starts at 54mb, then drops to 48mbs, 36mbs, 28mbs, down to 1mbs) then disconnects, then reconnects at 54 mbs.
After a short while, it will drop the speed again until it disconnects and reconnects again.
This is the third Linksys WRT54GL that has done this.
The first one was 5 years old before it started doing this in February, the second was 3 months old, and now the replacement Linksys sent to me is doing this?
Does anyone know what is going on with my router?
I am able to connect fine with the Cat5 cable, but wireless seems to be the problem.
Even my phone(s) get disconnected from the wireless router.
This problem just recently started and I don't know why, no settings had been changed on any of the routers until after the problem had already ocurred, then the Linksys phone tech support had me make multiple changes.
