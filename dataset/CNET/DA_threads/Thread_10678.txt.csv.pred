1.1.1	Hey everyone this is my first post here .	St
1.1.2	I am not a networking expert and I need some help and possible clarification .	St
1.1.3	First let me start off by saying I currently am switching from Hughes Net broadband internet service .	Sug
1.1.4	( Satellite ) I will be replacing it with the Basic DSL service from AT & T .	St
1.1.5	Now , I have two offices currently networked ( wired ) together and because I am on the Basic DSL service plan ( will upgrade when available ) I would like for each office to have its own connection to the internet to lighten the load .	St
1.1.6	Yet , I still want them to be networked for file sharing .	St
1.1.7	This is what I envision : Office One : Modem 1 Router 1 -Will be given the address of 192.168.1.1 -Will not be set as a DHCP Server -Will allow IP connections from 192.168.1.2-50 Hey everyone this is my first post here .	St
1.1.8	I am not a networking expert and I need some help and possible clarification .	St

1.1.13	This is what I envision : Office One : Modem 1 Router 1 -Will be given the address of 192.168.1.1 -Will not be set as a DHCP Server -Will allow IP connections from 192.168.1.2-50 -Will be connected to the SWITCH Clients -Will have a manually configured IP from 192.168.1.2-50 -Will have a gateway of 192.168.1.1 -Will be on the Network called DASILVEIRA SWITCH Office Two : Modem 2 Router 2 -Will be given the address of 192.168.2.1 -Will not be set as a DHCP Server -Will allow IP connections from 192.168.2.2-50 -Will be connected to the SWITCH Clients -Will have a manually configured IP from 192.168.2.2-50 -Will have a gateway of 192.168.2.1 -Will be on the Network called DASILVEIRA My question is will this work .	St
1.1.14	Even though I have two separate routers , which will be connected by a SWITCH will , the computers still connect on the same network .	St
1.1.15	Will I have to use the RIP feature ?	Ques
1.1.16	If so how exactly does this work ?	Ques
1.1.17	Will my routers recognize one another and now that the clients are on the same network and allow them to communicate ?	Ques
1.1.18	( My SWITCH does not have the option to change any settings . )	St
1.1.19	I know about Dual WAN routers but have never worked with them .	St
1.1.20	Also , from my understanding the second WAN is for back-up purposes only .	St
1.1.21	Unless , you can specifiy on a Dual WAN router which computers use what connection I do not think it would be helpful .	St
1.1.22	Thanks , Tommy	St
1.2.1	Okay I am thinking that if I set both modem RIP Directions to & quot ; Both & quot ; then they will recognize what host ( client ) is where and that should ensure they stay on the same network .	St
1.2.2	Is this correct ?	Ques
1.3.1	1 . )	St
1.3.2	One DSL modem per DSL line .	St
1.3.3	Period .	St
1.3.4	2 . )	St
1.3.5	You can not put a switch in front of a modem .	St
1.3.6	Period .	St
1.3.7	( And expect it to work . )	St
1.3.8	Possible resolution .	St
1.3.9	DSL line - & gt ; DSL modem - & gt ; Wireless router - & gt ; various computers connected via Ethernet cable and/or wireless .	St
1.3.10	Set File and Printer Sharing on all PCs .	St
1.4.1	It will be DSL Modem 1 -- - & gt ; Router 1 -- - & gt ; Switch & lt ; -- -- Router 2 & lt ; -- - DSL Modem 2 | | Clients 1 Clients 2 The switch is only necessary to connect the two Routers as they will be a block away from one another .	St
1.4.2	I believe if I have the RIP feature on each Router set to & quot ; Both & quot ; then they will communicate .	St
1.4.3	Hopefully , this makes more sense .	St
1.4.4	I have two seperate DSL Lines .	St
1.4.5	I know that is a necessity .	St
1.4.6	This is my current setup with my Satellite Modem : Modem -- - & gt ; Router -- - & gt ; Switch -- - & gt ; All Clients Thanks , Tommy	St
