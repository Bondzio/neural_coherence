This condition of locking up comes up randomly. I m in the process checking for loose connection to see if I can remedy this. Im able to access the setup configuration and could change the hard drive from unavailable to available. The optical drive is set at cd-rom. How do I change it to CD/DVD RW to represent the new up grade optical drive? W
