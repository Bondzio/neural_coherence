i have 2 dell pcs and 1 sony laptop.
they are all 3-5 years old but fully updated to xp pro.
i juse a linksys 802 b g router.
the laptop uses a linksys card and the pcs connect via ethernet.
i have no problem with any of them except when i am online, every 10 minutes or so i get the work offline?
or try again?
error message.
often i get the page not found message when refreshing.
sometimes i can't connect to the internet at all.
when i hook the cable modem directly to the computer w/o the router, there is no problem.
to fix the problem i go into my network places/network connectons and right click on the network connection icon and click repair.
this fixes the problem every time.
does anyone have any idea what the problem is and how i can fix it?
a solution is much appreciated.
thanks.
