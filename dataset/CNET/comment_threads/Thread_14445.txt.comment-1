I have never done this before and need some advise.
Can you direct me please?
I have two computer, one with a small external hard drive that is full now.
I purchase a new large HD and I want to load all the files from the small HD to the new one and then all the files from my second computer.
Is there anywhere I could find directions on doing this without loosing all my files?
Can someone advise me?
I guess I don't know how to load the files from one external HD to the other??
Please advise.
Thank you, Wadda
