Hey there guys.
I've had this problem for a while now, I can't seem to permanently fix it.
It's extremely aggrivating.
With making no changes, my CPU runs at 1.2 GHZ instead of 2.4 GHZ, it's normal operating speed.
Is there ANYTHING common about this issue?
Any help is very widely accepted.
Aside from that I also have another question: Is it worth enabling the CPU's featured Hyperthreading function in BIOS?
