He has a Viking Interworks 512 MB USB 2.0 Flash Drive. His computer at work (running Windows XP) does not recognize it and always goes to the download wizard to look for drivers. It does work properly on a different computer, and he has tested all of the USB ports on the problem computer, and they all work. In the past when plugging a USB 2.0 device into a USB 1.0 port, I have seen a pop-up window come up that says it can run faster, but it still works. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
