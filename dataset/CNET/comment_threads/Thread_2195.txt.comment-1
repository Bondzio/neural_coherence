Hi, I'm a college student and my roommate is bringing a Lexmark x1185 (I know its a cheap printer).
I would like to connect this printer to my wireless network or be able to connect to the printer through bluetooth.
Now, I know that this printer does not have these capabilities right out of the box, but is there some type of cheap adapter that I can buy for it to give it these capabilities?
Preferably I would like to keep the price below $30.
Thanks, D0LFAN
