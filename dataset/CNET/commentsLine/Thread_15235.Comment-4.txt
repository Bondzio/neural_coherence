the chipset on that mobo failed to meet the high expectations for an nforce chipset.
the 610 was the first to be considered to be as good as or slightly better than the intel chipsets.
look closely though, some of the intel chipsets have zero support for pata drives.
although on a given mobo the mobo mfr may add a chip to provide one pata ide port [2 drives].
