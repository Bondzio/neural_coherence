1.1.8	- Locate a Fujitsu hard drive diagnostic on http : //www.fujitsu.com/us/services/computing/storage/hdd/support/utilities.html .	St
1.1.9	They only have one for IDE .	St
1.1.10	However , it needs to be run from a DOS bootable device and the laptop has no diskette drive .	St
1.1.11	I wonder if it 's worth the trouble to make a bootable CD or a bootable USB .	St
1.1.12	- Download a general hard disk diagnostic ( mhdd - comes with iso for a bootable cd ) .	St
1.1.13	That finds only the DVD/RW and no trace of the hard disk .	St
1.1.14	Any other option than going to the repair shop and ask them to check the cables and then put a new hard disk in ( and check it by installing Windows XP ) ?	Ques
1.1.15	It 's not something I 'd like to do myself .	St
1.1.16	And yes , I happened to make a backup last week .	St

1.2.1	even if you need a USB floppy or CD ROM to run it .	St

1.3.1	You could always try doing a live-USB Linux boot , go in the partition settings and check your 80GB hard drive .	Sug
1.3.2	You can still see your hard drive of 80GB in your partition..	St
1.3.3	It just wo n't be mounted .	St
1.3.4	I doubt you 'll need help doing that ( live-usb ) but if you do I suggest Debian Live ... That 's where I do my partition work .	St
1.3.5	& quot ; unetbootin & quot ; is a very useful program to push .ISO images to your USB to make it bootable .	St
1.3.6	p.s .	St
1.3.7	At my old school , when we had those & quot ; OS not found & quot ; errors.. we had to refresh the RAM by taking the sticks out then putting it back in.. sometimes it would work .	St
1.3.8	So ... Make sure your RAM is properly connected and the hinges are properly securing it so it 's not shaky .	Res
1.3.9	Hope that helped .	St
1.4.1	To happen so suddenly suggest either a component failed or heat damage .	St
1.4.2	Laptops tend to get hot and when run in such a condition sooner or later they poop-out .	St
1.4.3	To test the HD , I 've used ADA-2020 adapter to a desktop and access the HD that way .	St

1.4.13	tada -- -- -Willy	St
