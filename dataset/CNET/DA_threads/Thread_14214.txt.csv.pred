1.1.2	Now that it is just beyond its one year warranty period, it has the modem has started to make a strange noise.	St
1.1.3	It sounds sort of like a machine gun, and lasts about 5 to 10 seconds at a time.	St
1.1.4	I have not noticed that there is any action that I take on the computer that trigers this.	St
1.1.5	It seems to happen at random times, and it may happen once or twice within 2 hours of computer use.	St
1.1.6	I have not noticed any change in the good performance of my computer.	St
1.1.7	Any ideas?	St
1.1.8	Should I do something about this?	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Maybe I am using the wrong term.	St
1.3.2	By &quot;modem&quot; I am refering to the computer.	St
1.4.1	Without much to work with and a false lead on the modem I'm going to take a WILD GUESS.	St
1.4.2	Here it is.	St
1.4.3	-&gt; Something has moved inside to occasionally brush with a fan.	St
1.4.4	To fix I open it up and inspect the areas around any fan.	St
