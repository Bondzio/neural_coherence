Here is what I am dealing with: - internet access via browser works - windows updates work - windows defender updates work - updates from within antivirus and MalewareBytes don't work - tracert to data-cdn.mbamupdates.com executed in command line works - when I try to do the same via traceroute_malwarebytes_cdn application, its log has the following error: &quot;Unable to initialize the Windows Sockets interface, error code 11003.&quot; - running ESET online scanning tool (antivirus) doesn't work - asks if I am connected via proxy, which is not the case Does anyone know what could possibly cause this block and how do I fix it? I am running Windows 7 64bit. Used Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2013 but temporary uninstalled it due to this issue. Also, Kaspersky 2013 and IE 9, 10 crash. I had to rollback to IE 8 and it works just fine.

The IE 9 and 10 crash are clue something's up but it's unclear what. Try scanning with what Grif notes at http://forums.cnet.com/7726-6132_102-5098912.html?tag=posts;msg5099421 Bob

I was able to restore the update functionality in MalwareBytes using this post: http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/443087/hi-guysnoob-at-pcs-needs-help-badly/page-2#entry2622975 &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt;My computer was previously checked for malware and viruses on another forum. &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;I think the update issues were a result of the infection that is now gone. Thank you for getting back to me.
