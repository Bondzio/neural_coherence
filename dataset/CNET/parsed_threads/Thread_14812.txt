<s> Im trying to cut down the wires in my house. </s>
<s> My computer is in my office while the closest cable outlet is in the living room. </s>
<s> So, right now I have to run a cable along the baseboard down the hallway. </s>
<s> I was wondering if a wireless network would allow me to get rid of this wire. </s>
<s> Im not familiar with this type of network so I dont know exactly how they work. </s>
<s> Is it possible for the wireless access point and the modem to be in the other room and not physically connected to any computer at all using a wireless NIC? </s>
<s> One more thing... </s>
<s> I want to get rid of the wire for my X-Box as well. </s>
<s> This is another wire I have to run down the hall back into the living room. </s>
<s> Currently I use an extra NIC in my PC to connect it. </s>
<s> If possible, I want the X-Box and PC to share the access point so I don't have to use my PC as a hub anymore. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Yes, but what many don't realize is that you need to wire up the first time to configure the wifi router... </s>
<s> The XBox has it's own model &quot;gaming adapter&quot; which I will provide an example... http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=33&scid=38&prid=550 Bob </s>
<s> Ah, thank you. </s>
<s> Looking into it a bit more, I may go with the Motorola wireless G router for the PC but still wire up the X-Box since it will only be a few feet away. </s>
<s> That way I could save about $80 by not buying the gaming adapter. </s>
<s> I was given a Motorola Surfboard cable modem and it's been great so far. </s>
<s> I figured I would just stay with Moto since the modem has been solid... or do you think I should go with a Linksys wireless router? </s>
<s> The Moto to my surprise was $10 less. </s>
<s> Moto's track record speaks for itself. </s>
<s> They tend to drop out and you won't get a firmware update or such. </s>
<s> Linksys/Cisco on the other hand... it's their primary business. </s>
<s> For 10 bucks I'd get the linksys. </s>

<s> Well, I got the router and wireless NIC today and set it up in a matter of minutes (or rather closer to a half hour). </s>
<s> I followed the directions to the T and followed your advise on connecting the PC to the router with an ethernet cable first. </s>
<s> I got the router working, I unhooked the cable, installed the NIC card, and everything is beautiful. </s>
<s> I'm getting 54 Mbps as my connection and I am delighted. </s>
<s> It seems to be running great and I'm gonna test it with a few games later tonight to push it a bit. </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>
