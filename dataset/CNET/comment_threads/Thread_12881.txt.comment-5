My motherboard won't recognize the AMD XP2900 processor.
I have tried to reset the bios to the recommended 200 mhz x 10x multiplier.
When the system tries to reboot it just hangs.
I have to shut down and clear the cmos just to get it to the bios screen to start again.
Suggestions?
The manual says this processor should work with this motherboard.
