do you have sata support anyway?
even on most benchmark tests, sata is not much faster than ata, sometimes slower.
if your motherboard supports it(should) go with ata133.
i disagree on the burner.
double-layer, dual-format is the way to go.
you don't have to burn everything as 2 layer (or anything, actually).
my dvd burners burn more cds than dvds.
recently bought 16x, dual-format, double-layer dvd burner down the street at office max for $39us.
unless it is a more expensive, always buy modern equipment, even if you can't use all the features now.
your next deck may play double side discs.
will the more expensive sony do anything better, or last longer?
fwiw chuck
