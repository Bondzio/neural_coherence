you've been taken a little advantage of by the person/place that took your money, gave you a bare drive and tossed in the deep end of the pool.
it's not funny.
and while you can beat me up, i have to pull all the dirty items up on the table so we can work the issues.
it would be interesting if dvdshrink was able to dupe and make a good dvd since that points to updates needed in nero/other or even a firmware update.
these bagged drives are for oems that update the firmware and more... bob
