Basically i'm upgrading this pc for improving the internet surfing(cos' browser is working slow), a lot of downloading and also some applications sometimes takes 30 sec - 1 minute to start up.
Does a change from 450 Mhz to 800 Mhz Cpu clock would improve the above or the RAM upgrade from 192 MB to 384 MB or Both?
