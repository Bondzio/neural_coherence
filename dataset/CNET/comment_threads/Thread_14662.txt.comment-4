&quot;But I don't have PC133 RAM.
I have PC2100 DDR.&quot; PC133 was to note the clock rate to the memory.
In (most?)
DDR RAM, the numer refers to some bytes per second.
The math then looks like this: clock rate times byte count on stick x double (data rate) = number OR 133 x 8 x 2 = 2,128 Since no one will note PC2128, they round it off.
