1.1.1	On my Zebra 2844-z I ca n't print .	St
1.1.2	I load the media ; plug in the usb cable install the driver from the CD .	St
1.1.3	I print a confiuration page from the printer it 's self , and it works .	St
1.1.4	I go to print a Windows test page and The printer gives me a flashing red light .	Sug
1.1.5	It seems to me to be a callibration issue or something wrong with the media or media settings but I 'm out of ideas on how to figure out exactly the problem .	St
1.1.6	I run windows xp Pro SP3 .	St
1.1.7	I 've tested it on multiple computers and I always get the same thing .	St
1.1.8	Any advice is greatly appreciated .	Polite

1.2.1	I would think printing the windoze test page is too large or wide for that matter .	St
1.2.2	The Zebra is probably 40-col. printing and normal PC output is 80-col or more .	St
1.2.3	So , if you use the std .	St
1.2.4	windoze test pattern , that 's not going to work .	St
1.2.5	Generate a dummy file , of small size and dump that instead , if possible .	St
1.2.6	example : 1 22 333 4444 55555 end of test Just is the final use of the Zebra intended for ?	Ques
1.2.7	Install the app .	St
1.2.8	you want it to use and then configure that as well .	St
1.2.9	This is where it may start to work right provided it knows the configurations of both PC and printer match to accept each other .	St
1.2.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	I can get it to print a windows test page ( it 's just a picture of the windows logo ) After I send the print job and it errors , I can restore the defaults .	St
1.3.2	It runs through and calibrates to the label size and prints what ever print job was in Que .	St
1.3.3	Even if it 's multiple print jobs ( either the windows or the intended application . )	St
1.3.4	However , the whole process repeats it 's self after that .	St
1.4.1	Since you already stated you tried on various PCs , the error remains the same .	St
1.4.2	That suggests the Zebra is somehow misconfigured or its bad .	St
1.4.3	I checked the manual , after some time and it offers nothing to resolve this other that to check the physical h/w ( platen , etc . )	St
1.4.4	or use the command lingo , as in ^SC , if I recall .	St
1.4.5	the error is in the Zebra physically or the setup .	St
1.4.6	While you have tried USB connection , try the parallel port if available , unless of course ONLY USB is present at the printer .	St
1.4.7	If you swap to various USB ports , that will cause an issue as quenes get hosed unti returned to proper last connection of that request .	St
1.4.8	The manual also refers to the media being ( paper ) , be sure its routed correctly and refers to same media .	St
1.4.9	If I remember right , the Zebra post is a repeat of a past post .	St
1.4.10	If this is so , then maybe its best to query Zebra for support .	St
1.4.11	If in fact there is something wrong it will diagnosed and maybe covered under warranty .	St
1.4.12	If you have access to another Zebra printer , copy those settings as reference .	St
1.4.13	It should n't be taking any issue , because you say it prints a windoze test ( logo ) but the typical windoze test is more than a logo , far more .	St
1.4.14	Because it stops and errors and does n't finish the job , it should try again when cleared , maybe that 's an area to review .	St
1.4.15	If I had this setup in frt .	St
1.4.16	of me , it makes more sense to try this or that .	St
1.4.17	The options should be few and it works or does n't .	St
1.4.18	tada -- -- -Willy	St
