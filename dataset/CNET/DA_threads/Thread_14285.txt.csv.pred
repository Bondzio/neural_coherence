1.1.2	My brother told me that the latest processor of the AMD trinity A10 is very good deal , so I went search and find this one called ARCTIC MC101 .	St
1.1.3	Does anyone know about this PC ?	Ques
1.1.4	It looks very nice for my living room but I cant find any review about it yet and would like to have some comment by you guys , thanks , hope you can help !	St
1.1.5	Here 's the website and youtube about the product I mentioed above : http : //www.arctic.ac/en/p/living/entertainment-center/571/mc101-a10.html ? c=2296 http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=xjx4IFuma6M	Ques
1.2.1	Hey there , I have a media center PC myself and I enjoy it very much .	St
1.2.2	I never seen the MC101 before but it has a very good processor , The AMD Trinity A10 only came out mid-May and it sounds promising .	St
1.2.3	It doesnt have review yet poss .	St
1.2.4	coz this is too news , it 's on pre-launch only ...	St
1.2.5	Think is a good deal with these specs , I mean mine was more expensive with less RAM , storage and older processor than this one .	St
1.2.6	I would go for it , good luck !	St
1.3.1	I own an HP Media Center .	St
1.3.2	When I purchased it I was excited .	St
1.3.3	It had all the right bells and whistles , TV , radio , great Nvidia graphics card w/ an extra slot to add another graphics card for a dual monitor possibility .	St
1.3.4	I immediately created the diagnostic and restore disks as indicated by the manual ( since they do n't supply the restore disks any more with the purchased system ) .	St
1.3.5	I was elated .	St
1.3.6	Unfortunately my positive awe changed to wonder , amazement and bewilderment .	St
1.3.7	I noticed that the OS , at the time Vista Ultimate [ Business ] was the hottest thing ; although the system is a Dual Core 64 bit system , there was a 32 bit Vista OS installed .	St
1.3.8	To correct this issue would have cost me almost $ 300 more .	St
1.3.9	But besides that after about 6 months the computer started indicating that the fan was n't working .	St
1.3.10	But when the system case was opened up both fans were working .	St
1.3.11	Then suddenly the system began to reboot itself at the most inopportune times .	St
1.3.12	then finally it would reboot and then after rebooting it would reboot again in an endless loop of rebooting .	St
1.3.13	I tried researching the problem unsuccessfully .	St
1.3.14	I thought it could be a virus or something , so I thought about restoring to the factory default from the recovery disks ( since the recovery section on the hard drive was then inaccessible . )	St
1.3.15	The first disk worked fine .	St
1.3.16	but when prompted to insert disk 2 the app refused to recognize the second disk .	St
1.3.17	I called HP for help but they had stopped supporting that computer model and that recovery disk was no longer available .	St
1.3.18	So , in conclusion , beware when buying from HP .	St
1.3.19	It is often the practice to stop supporting some systems .	St
1.3.20	It has happened several other times in the past as well with several HP printers that I have purchased .	St
1.3.21	As soon as there was a new OS available for some reason they stopped supporting that particular model and drivers were no longer available .	St
1.3.22	Sorry this turned out to be so long .	St
1.3.23	I just wanted to be fair and clear .	St
1.3.24	BEWARE !	St
1.3.25	!	St
1.4.1	Oh no , poor & lt ; dvmarion & gt ; , that is bad luck ...	Polite
1.4.2	I heard that from many people do n't get HP computers coz they are not good ... . @ serena_va - have you brought the MC101 you mentioned at the end ?	Ques
1.4.3	I just brought one as well and I got the barebone version , so that I can add my own OS and storage .	St
1.4.4	The device works really well , the trinity doing it job well , is really fast and the graphic is brilliant , no problem with online games .	St
1.4.5	I got 2 TB HDD so that I can storage series and movies I downloaded from internet .	St
1.4.6	I like it very much so far , think is a good choice !	St
1.4.7	good luck to you ... ..n maybe not HP as & lt ; dvmarion & gt ; mentioned lol & lt ; /dvmarion & gt ; & lt ; /dvmarion & gt ; & lt ; dvmarion & gt ; & lt ; dvmarion & gt ; & lt ; /dvmarion & gt ; & lt ; /dvmarion & gt ;	St
