hi, i recently bought an acer aspire notebook.
when i plugged a gadget in the usb drive (tried all 3 drives) it says that the usb drive is low-powered.
i have tried a usb hub with a y-cable, a usb hub with external power and a usb 2.0 pcmcia card and it doesn't work.
i checked and the usb port is 2.0. is there anything i can do to make it high-powered?
can i change the usb controller?
any advice greatly appreciated.
thanks in advance.
