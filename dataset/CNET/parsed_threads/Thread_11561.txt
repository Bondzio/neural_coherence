<s> Hello, I'm Mark, I'm wondering what PC should I get between theese two? </s>
<s> The price doesn't matter, here are the specifications: Number 1: Intel Core i7-950 3.06 GHz MB Foxconn X58 8 GB DDR3 RAM 1000 GB (1TB) HDD nVidia GTX560 1GB GDDR5 DVDRW Number 2: Intel Core i7-2600K 3.4GHz MB Foxconn-H67M-S 2.0 8 GB DDR3 RAM 1000 GB (1TB) HDD nVIdia GTX 550 Ti - 1GB GDDR5 DVDRW So, as you can see, Number 1 has weaker cpu than number 2, but A LOT faster gpu than number 2. </s>
<s> But, I'm not entirely sure in that, so that is what I'm asking you! </s>
<s> If Number 1, has weaker cpu, what should I get??? </s>
<s> Faster CPU, or Faster GPU??? </s>
<s> I need this pc for video making (Sony Vegas, After Effects) and fast rendering! </s>
<s> I also need it for gaming (Battlefield 3, Crysis 3, GTA 5 and other high-end games)! </s>
<s> Please, HELP!!! </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> Split a hair in some respects, I am nodding to # 2 using # 1's graphics card. </s>
<s> As far as processor speed is concerned unless you can think in nano seconds I seriously doubt you notice any difference. </s>
<s> And of course it would depend on what speed you are alluding to, internet speed ( hook ups) notwithstanding. </s>
<s> As soon as you mentioned gaming the Gpu takes center stage. </s>
<s> For most games it's where the action is. </s>
<s> My vote.......the 950 and the 560. </s>
<s> OK, Thanks for all the replies guys! </s>
<s> So as I can see the gaming takes more gpu as I thought, but if we say like this, which is better: i7 2600k 3,4 ghz or i7 950 3,06 ghz??? </s>
<s> Cause they are different models, as you can see one is 2600k, and other is 950... Any help! </s>
<s> -Thanks! </s>
<s> Thanks for all the replies, guys! </s>
<s> So I see gaming takes more gpu as I thought, but if you guys can tell me, what cpu is better, the 2600k or the 950??? </s>
<s> -Thanks again! </s>
<s> Ooops! </s>
<s> Sorry for posting 2 posts, I didn't see the first one! </s>
<s> Sorry... </s>
<s> The 2600k wins. </s>

<s> Thanks for all the fast replies guys! </s>
<s> OK, I found another PC on the market, so if you can tell me is this good? </s>
<s> Spec: CPU: AMD Phenom II X6-1055T 6-Core BOX RAM: DIMM 8GB (2x4GB) DDR3 1333MHz Apacer GPU: Gigabyte PCX GeForce GTX560Ti 1GB DDR5 HDMI/2xDVI Overclock HDD: 3.5&quot; 2TB Hitachi SATA3 64MB 7200RPM CASE: ATX Midi Tower Case Hantol 2881 POWER SUPPLY: PSU 685W Hantol Is this good? </s>
<s> The price is between the number 1 and number 2! </s>
<s> Is the CPU faster than the 2600k? </s>
<s> I emailed them and asked them how much Ghz is the CPU? </s>
<s> And how big the case is? </s>
<s> So umm, is this good? </s>
<s> -Thanks! </s>
<s> Is the CPU faster than the 2600k? </s>
<s> No. </s>
<s> So umm, is this good? </s>
<s> Maybe. </s>
<s> The case looks like some mini tower thing..........not a gamers case. </s>
<s> The psu.........who knows......the specs seem to be a secret. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply! </s>
<s> And yeah, totally, I decided to get number 1! </s>
<s> Thanks for the replies guys! </s>
<s> THANKS! </s>
