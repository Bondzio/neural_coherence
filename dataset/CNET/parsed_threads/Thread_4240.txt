<s> I'm looking to hook up my desktop PC in a room with no phone/ethernet jacks. </s>
<s> Is it possible to hook up a wireless router without physically connecting it to any computer, or does there have to be at least one wired connection for admin purposes? </s>
<s> &quot; does there have to be at least one wired connection for admin purposes?&quot; You wire it up the first time, configure and then unwire. </s>
<s> But without any connection to the Internet, such will not offer much of anything interesting Bob </s>
<s> got it set up. </s>
<s> As you probably already figured out, the default &quot;out of the box&quot; settings will typically work like plug-and-play. </s>
<s> As long as nothing specific needs to be entered for your router, like names and passwords, then the router plugging into your cable/DSL modem will get your router on the air. </s>
<s> Installing the wireless card into your PC is typically set up to the default of using any found, and open, wireless network. </s>
<s> Of course, sometimes things don't work like they're supposed to, and you have to tweak. </s>
<s> But that is how it is supposed to work. </s>
<s> Just remember that without setting up some things away from those defaults leaves your wireless network exposed for others to gain access just as easily. </s>
<s> You might want to enable some of the security measures. </s>
