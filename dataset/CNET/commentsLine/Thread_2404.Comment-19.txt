part iv (final chapter-the adventure begins) now back to your issue &gt;&gt; things have changed.
now at boot time, a configurable default physical disk is used, but you have the option of selecting any other disk on the system.
.
get a new ide cable just for giggles (theyre cheap) and double check the drive jumper pins.
the bios should be able to see both drives pure and simple.
if its making your cd/rw d it doesnt know that both drives are there.
you cant have them both jumpered as master (or both slave for that matter) well kinda not really.
you dont need a boot disk be it c or otherwise to load an os.
all you need to do is make sure that the bios knows where to look for the mbr that you want to use.
i would just install each os while that hard drive was the only one connected.
as far as using a backup to install that gets iffy.
you can clone a good install, you can make an image of it like i do with norton ghost.
but restore from a backup is more for data than code with many backup programs and won't cater to needs of certain files being in certain physical locations on the disk.
you can run into some problems with some devious copy protection schemes.
as you can tell from above i believe in lean installs ) sure you can boot the d with c disconnected, but the os will of course name it 'c'.
give them each a volumn label... george and gracie or something so you tell them apart no matter how the os labels them but get the cable and jumper thing taken care of first.
