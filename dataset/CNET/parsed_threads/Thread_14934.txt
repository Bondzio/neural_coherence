<s> I have been having a problem lately with my wireless internet: About one or two times a day I cannot connect to my wireless router through my laptop. </s>
<s> When I view the available wireless networks, I can see my network and the signal is at full strength. </s>
<s> When I click connect it says aquiring signal, but never connects. </s>
<s> If I go reset my modem and router then try to connect it works fine. </s>
<s> I have a cable modem with a Netgear wireless G router. </s>
<s> I am using a dell Inspiron laptop with a Netgear Wireless G card. </s>
<s> My wireless network settings are set to WEP-128 bit encryption, on channel 7 and I have an access list with my laptop on it. </s>
<s> I should also note that I have a desktop connected to the router via a ethernet cable that works even when my laptop doesn't. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for the help! </s>

<s> It's so fast today that it's not considered to be secure at all. </s>
<s> Try it our way as we note in the forum sticky. </s>
<s> Stock settings, SSID broadcasting, WPA and no other changed settings from stock. </s>

<s> The only option for WPA I have says &quot;WPA-PSK (Wi-Fi Protected Access Pre-Shared Key)&quot; Is that the same thing that you recomended? </s>
<s> Also, should I eliminate the access list? </s>
<s> Saves me from typing it. </s>
<s> And yes, yes. </s>
<s> Ok, changed all the settings, I also have a wireless print server that I had to update with the new password for the network and I updated the firmware for the router while I was at it. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help, hopefully this solves my connection issues...thank you for the help! </s>
