I kind of feel the i3 would be the &quot;minimum&quot; processor and I'm afraid it would be obsolete too quickly... thus the reason I was thinking of the i5 or i7.
No, I will not be doing DNA sequencing work (LOL), but I know new programs coming on the market gobble up space and may overtax a minimum system.
But thank you!
