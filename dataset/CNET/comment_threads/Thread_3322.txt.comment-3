look under DISK MANAGEMENT and see if you see 'unallocated space' on drive 0.
The fix ... you could create a new partition in the unallocated space, wipe drive 0 and start all over creating the partitions or buy a product like Partition Magic or Disk Director which would allow you to 'expand' drive C to the full capacity.
The options are endless...these are the probably the most common.
Should you choose using PM or DD ...you should backup your data to minimize the risk of data loss.
