So, I saw that with the Sony Tablet S, the SD card slot isn't actually expandable memory, it reads it, but in order to watch a movie or the like, you have to download the stuff to the tablet's memory.
Kind of defeats the purpose of having a SD card slot.
But, is this because of an older Android OS?
Does ICS do away with that, and basically use the SD card slot as actual expandable memory?
