hi: i have always used live essentials until recently.
the reason was i could not download adobe flash on a windows 7 ie 9 64bit.
the issue is still pending; so i switched to google and am satisfied.
i am not sure if i can delete all live essentials or would this affect my operating system?
sure could use help re this.
