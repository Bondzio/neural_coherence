For dual channel support, you populate in pairs....same spec RAM in each color coded slot. It would probably be best to have all the same and these are generally offered in matched pairs. As such, you would need 2 matched 2 gig pairs (which is the same as saying 4 1 gig modules. That would max your PC and make your wallet much lighter as well.

General computing for Windows XP doesn't need more that 512MB of system RAM. Some games will benefit from 1GB RAM, but that is the most I would install. 2. Current Radeon Xpress 200 chipset is integrated into the motherboard. The 128MB of advertised video memory is actually drawn from shared system memory (the existing 512MB of system RAM). 3. Adding a PCI Express X16 video card with dedicated video memory (doesn't share system RAM) will improve your system performance more than using 4GB RAM. If you intend to run some of today's games, definitely get a nice video card instead or more RAM.

I recommend a DDR or GDDR3 video card for better performance, which means they do not say TurboCache or HyperMemory.

Once you've installed and run Belarc Advisor...use the info from Belarc and go to Crucial.com. Enter the info about your system and it will tell you exactly what RAM is available for your system and it's guaranteed to work. If you do need more RAM ...and it must be installed in pairs you could get 2 DIMMs with 256MBs ea for 512 or 2 DIMMs with 512MBs for 1GB. If you get 1GB..I recommend you put those in slots 0 and 1 and the old RAM in slots 2 and 3. Regards, VAPCMD

However, I'm overly cautious and when you're mixing RAM from different manufacturers and adding 2x512MBs to a system with 2x256MBs, I'd always put the higher density DIMMs, the 2x512s, in the first two slots. In the event there's any incompatibility or abnormal behavior ... you can pull the 2x256s and still have dual channel and 1GB RAM. Regards, VAPCMD
