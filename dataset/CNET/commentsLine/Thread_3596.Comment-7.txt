as long as i play the game in a window, i can do 2 things at once.
what if i didn't, would it be split across the 2 screens?
also, what about regular programs.
like, say i was using mozilla and itunes at the same time.
could i make it so one monitor has itunes on it and one has mozilla.
also, whatever i did on one monitor, would it happen on the other?
like, if i am on mozilla on the crt, and i moved my cursor to say close the window, would it be moved on the other one as well?
if not, how would i switch between monitors?
sorry about all the questions, i am just very new on this whole thing.
