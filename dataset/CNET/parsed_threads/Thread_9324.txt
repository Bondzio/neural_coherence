<s> Hey guys, I really need help on choosing the right gaming pc in time for Christmas-ish. </s>
<s> This will be the first gaming pc though I am a devout gamer, consoles mainly until my friend introduced me to the world of pc gaming so this is the first time I have ever bought one so be gentle with me. </s>
<s> I'm looking around for a good pc that runs the latest games and is going to be future proof for a number of years. </s>
<s> I have a budget of around &#163;1000 though I may be able to go up and down a little bearing in mind that I have got to buy a monitor and keyboard etc (Using a laptop at the moment). </s>
<s> I have been snooping around and the amount of choices are insane. </s>
<s> So essentially what I would really like is advice on graphics cards, processors and the likes and what I could get for most bang for my buck. </s>
<s> Recommendations are welcome whether it be desktops or sites but I have no intention of building my own I'm afraid. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Any dual core CPU is about all we need. </s>
<s> 4 or more GB RAM and then the ALL IMPORTANT VIDEO CARD. </s>
<s> I have a list I really like. </s>
<s> Here it is -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-performance-radeon-geforce,3018.html Frankly any card above the 101 USD line is going to rock compared to most off the shelf desktops. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Why go with a dual core, when you can get an i3 quad core for another hundred dollars or so. </s>
<s> A dual core may work just fine, but the op was requesting a machine that wouldn't be horribly outdated for a couple years or so. </s>
<s> My advice would be to look for an Intel i5 quad core. </s>
<s> You will notice a difference in performance between the two. </s>
<s> Do you have some online shopping sites in the UK that you would consider buying a pre-built PC from? </s>
<s> Do share them here and we'll be happy to help you pick the right system for your gaming needs. </s>
<s> Sorry about late reply haven't had the time to check emails properly in ages. </s>
<s> Err I was looking at overclockers.co.uk I don't really know any others. </s>
