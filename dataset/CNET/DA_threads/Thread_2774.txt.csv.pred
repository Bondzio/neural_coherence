1.1.1	I have a new HP Pavilion a1510n with XP MCE 2005.	St
1.1.2	It has the built onto mother board sound (AC 97) with Realtek drivers.	St
1.1.3	It sounds ok, but I have wondered if I would notice any real inprovement with installing a seperate sound card, or would that just be more money for negligible improvement?	St
1.1.4	Thanks!	St
1.1.5	Wayne	St
1.2.1	What I found was that it did have less hiss and noise but I had to connect it to a rather big speaker set to notice it.	St
1.2.2	On the headphones I could barely tell.	St
1.2.3	NOW THERE IS ONE AREA THAT WAS REALLY BETTER.	St
1.2.4	This was the audio capture.	St
1.2.5	That was definitely many steps up.	St
1.2.6	Hope this helps, Bob	St
1.3.1	i think there's a definite improvement in sound quality with an audigy 4/x-fi over built-in sound.	St
1.3.2	definitely worth the $40.	St
1.4.1	http://techreport.com/etc/2006q4/onboard-eax/index.x?pg=1 In spite of what the Realtek chipset (AC97 and others) specifications say, it doesn't handle EAX sound very well or at all.	St
1.5.1	I bought a X-Fi gamer and love it.	St
1.5.2	I noticed a lot of sounds that I was missing with the AC-97 Hi def onboard sound.	St
1.5.3	I spent about $100 on mine and I think it was worth it.	St
