Let me say in advance, I thank you for any advice you may have for me.
I currently have Compaq SR1910NX that has an ASUS A8N-LA (NAGAMI2L) motherboard with 2 GB of RAM.
I am having trouble multitasking so I did a little research online.
I have learned from multiple sites that the A8N-LA motherboard will support an AMD Athlon 64x2 cpu.
I would like to know if this is in fact true and if I would gain any noticeable difference in my computer with the swap.
I am confident in my ability to swap the cpu's however I am concerned that I will need to alter the BIOS settings.
Can anyone point me in the right direction?
Again, Thank You for your advice.
