xp will glide onto good hardware.
you've found a bad combo, setting or part.
you may be nonplused to learn that today's machines still have poor to nonexistant diagnostics, arrive with out of date bios or firmware and can be setup (bios) to be nonfunctional.
a call to the machine's supplier for warranty replacement of parts or machine is the next call.
