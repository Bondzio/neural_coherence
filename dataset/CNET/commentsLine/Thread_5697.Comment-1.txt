hi, my computer has been infected with a virus for awhile now and it's affecting overall performance.
i'm throwing to much money into anti virus programs that aren't doing the job.
i need to to scrub the hard drive and start over fresh.
can you recommend a product that can be effective and information on operating system installation?
thanks!
