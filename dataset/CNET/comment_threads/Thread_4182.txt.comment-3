Its a common problem, but maybe these may help.
First, flash drives do go kaput and no amount of help will be enough, they're dead.
Next, some recovery s/w can help but again depending on the physical damage(ESD/static) may not help.
Here's link to such, look for others if cost is a problem: http://www.freedownloadscenter.com/Utilities/File_Maintenance_and_Repair_Utilities/USB_Flash_Drive_Data_Recovery.html If you can, try using the flash drive in another system entirely and see if data can be recovered.
Last, look at the support website for that flash drive maker and see if they offer any help or clues to recover or resolve the problem.
Quite frankly, in most cases I haven't been too successful when this problem comes up in recovering, &quot;data&quot;, though sometimes re-use of the flash drive comes back, but that's not saving the data.
It's important in the future to duplicate data to a system folder whenever possible.
