I am going to Europe for 10 days and trying to decide between a netbook or a tablet so that I may check email in my hotel.
I will have free wi-fi in the hotel, and checking email and some light web browsing are the only functions needed.
I am looking to spend $200-$250, no more.
Any suggestions?
Thanks for the feedback.
