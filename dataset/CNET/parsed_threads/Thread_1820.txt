<s> I've got this old dell pc with the following specs Win XP sp3 P II 231 Mhz 396 MB Ram. </s>
<s> I have a SATA hard drive that I need to be able to read using this old dell. </s>
<s> Except that it doesn't have a sata wiring. </s>
<s> Someone said to me to get an IDE/SATA controller card. </s>
<s> There are several available that I've noticed on newegg and just about all have very bad reviews. </s>
<s> Not to mention the fact this is an older PC, I am really asking for trouble? </s>
<s> This hard drive that I'm speaking of has some data that I need but something happened to it and it boots into the blue screen of death. </s>
<s> I ran the diagnostic routine and it told me the disk is bad, which I know is not really the case; I think only the boot sector is gone bad. </s>
<s> So anyway, a local PC shop wanted 130 bucks to retrieve my data, I said, are you kidding? </s>
<s> I guess they have to make a living and people who don't know any better will pay. </s>
<s> Where was I, oh yeah... </s>
<s> Anyone has experience with a similar configuration and why are all these SATA controller so funk prone? </s>
<s> Thank, Risho. </s>
<s> Would be to buy an external enclosure to put the drive into. </s>
<s> Assuming your old Dell has USB, they will probably be 1.1 instead of 2.0 which will make it slower. </s>
<s> That PC is pretty old. </s>
<s> I would possibly expect it to not have PCI but ISA slots which would further complicate a SATA adapter. </s>
<s> a damaaged boot sector can be fixed with a reformat, but if the diagnostics say the drive is bad they are detecting a hardware issue and the drive is close to toast. </s>
<s> here's a cheap sata-to-ide adapter: http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=CX-STI1001&cpc=SCH no drivers will be necessary. </s>
<s> if the pc has usb, consider this case: http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=SIL-35U2-SATA&cat=CSE if you want a controller, here's another inexpensive choice but you'll have to install drivers. </s>
<s> http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=CL-SL3114&cat=CCD as for newegg's customer reviews, you'll find many folks complaining because they didn't know what they were getting. </s>
<s> &quot;it won't work with my 1TB drive; the drivers are buggy; it won't work with this drive, it's slow&quot; etc. </s>
<s> adding new tech to an old pc can be a challenge. </s>
