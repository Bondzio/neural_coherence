<s> I'm in the process of upgrading my entire system's hardware and would like to transfer the data from 2 PATA hardrives to the new SATA hardrive that is in the new system. </s>
<s> The two old drives are both western digital, the new one is a seagate. </s>
<s> Whats the easiest way to transfer data between the old and new hardrives? </s>
<s> Both the old and new systems are or will be running XP Pro. </s>
<s> Can I install XP on the new system using the XP disc that was installed on the old one, without running into licensing problems? </s>
<s> Or would I be better off installing a fresh XP disc on the new system? </s>
<s> The data I want to transfer is saved games for the kids, pictures, and videos. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> First, games (and almost any program) will not move if they have been installed. </s>
<s> They're set in the registry and just will not move. </s>
<s> Other stuff can be moved by putting the old drives either: As a slave drive in the new machine By putting the drives into an external USB2 case Once XP is installed in a machine it cannot be installed into another machine. </s>
<s> Remember the &quot;Activation&quot; step? </s>
<s> Thats kind of the way I was thinking. </s>
<s> Games being re-installed and just the saved progress folders being substituted, and trying to direct transfer other files from one HD to another. </s>
<s> A new XP disk is already on the way also. </s>
<s> I'm glad to know I'm on the right track. </s>
