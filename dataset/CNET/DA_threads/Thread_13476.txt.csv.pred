1.1.1	I know most modern laptop PCs have wireless capabilities so they can access the Internet in any Wi-Fi hotspot.	St
1.1.2	However, I would like to know how you can access a Wi-Fi hotspot with a desktop PC.	St
1.1.3	My parents live in an apartment complex that operates a Wi-Fi hotspot.	St
1.1.4	They only have a desktop PC (and a very old one at that).	St
1.1.5	My sister can access the Internet with her laptop PC in the apartment.	St

1.3.1	You will need to make sure that the PCI wireless card has drivers for the operating system of the old computer.	Sug
1.3.2	a couple of years ago I was in a similar situation and a Belkin product wouldn't work on a computer with Windows 98 on it, where a Linksys was OK. That may be even more of a problem now.	St
1.3.3	Another solution would be an ordinary PCI network card, may need an old second hand one?	St
