and &quot;better written&quot; software is what I've been told.
My contacts say it's going to be a great new &quot;framework&quot; for doing bigger and better things.
Their verdict is &quot;awesome&quot;...and they are really picky guys.
Knowing them, they're impressed by things like &quot;stability&quot;, &quot;efficiency&quot;, &quot;security&quot;, &quot;expansion capacity&quot;, etc.
(I'm not a programmer, so I don't understand exactly what it is that has them so excited--but they are quite excited.)
From what I know, once you've installed the software, it won't be easy to enable/disable the enhanced graphical features.
That will be more of an &quot;initial setup&quot; issue.
I would assume, however, that those features wouldn't really interfere with game play.
