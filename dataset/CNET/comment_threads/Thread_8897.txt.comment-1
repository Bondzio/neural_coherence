I have a Samsung 174v lcd monitor, for some reason it just shuts off.
I can manually turn the monitor off then back on again and it will work for a few seconds then it turns off again.
Sometimes like now it will stay on then for no reason it shuts off again.
Any ideas on what is causing this?
windows xp pro.
Thanks......
