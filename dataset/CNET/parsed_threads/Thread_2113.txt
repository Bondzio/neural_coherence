<s> Ok I'm trying to recover from a hard drive change, I cloned my drive, then the windows xp had to be repaired, I cant get my video card working. </s>
<s> I'm using a Jetway Kp8 motherboard, with a AMD 64 bit processor. </s>
<s> Their is an AGP on the board, and I think this is where the problem lies, I cant load the drivers from the magic install disc that came with the board, it says it is corrupted. </s>
<s> I cant findd the 4 in 1 drivers or any agp driver for the board. </s>
<s> I used the driver windows ask for viaagp1.sys that I found (with great difficulty)I have loaded several agp drivers, I still Have no video card showing in my systems files, and the ATI radeon driver program refuses to load. </s>
<s> Any one with any ideas on this issue? </s>
<s> I'm about at my ropes end. </s>
