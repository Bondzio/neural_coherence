1.2.1	http : //www.pos.epson.co.uk/products/printers/tmt88iii/index.htm notes that this printer ( yours uses the same command codes ) can do this , but since I consider this not a freebie endeavor I will only share its possible and do n't do such work for free .	St

1.3.1	Dear Mr. Bob , Can you instruction me like that : - There is program , that can load bitmap into printer , in this program , it can send command to order printer print out that bitmap .	St

1.4.1	I do n't do many POS systems or terminals .	St
1.4.2	However , those that were done , suggest that the printer comes & quot ; pre-loaded & quot ; and was replaced .	St
1.4.3	I have n't seen one programmed out in the field .	St
1.4.4	The process maybe easy to do to transfer the logo , but not the make-up of the logo , so alot is in the air .	St
1.4.5	At best , you may get by with some & quot ; text message & quot ; .	St
1.4.6	On top of that some special s/w or standalone h/w would be needed to deal directly with the ptr .	St
