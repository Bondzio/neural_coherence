the actual clock rate of the memory and memory bus.
however because it is ddr sdram it reads/writes on both the leading and trialing edge of the clock, thus 2 read/writes at 200 mhz = 400 mhz effectively.
it is simply a terminology issue.
i doubt if your cpu supports dual channel, however understand that dual channel is not a memory characteristic.
dual channel is a mobo, chipset, and cpu function the memory used is simply standard ddr memory.
just uses a pair of the same size and type.
if you run the memory bus up to 250 mhz you may fry something.
the mobo is simply giving you a capability to overclock your memory bus.
that is usually done in 1 mhz steps until the system becomes unstable and then back down a mhz or two.
lot more to it than that and you risk frying things.
