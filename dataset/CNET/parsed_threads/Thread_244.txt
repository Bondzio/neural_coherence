<s> I have a new dell desktop that came with a 19&quot; flat screen monitor. </s>
<s> Now my not so old LG 17&quot; flatscreen monitor is collecting dust. </s>
<s> I'd love to somehow run cable TV to the LG, but I understand that's a problem b/c it's not a TV, it's a monitor. </s>
<s> So I thought I had the problem licked when I heard I just neededd a TV tuner. </s>
<s> So I went to Circuit City, explained my situation to a sales rep, and he told me &quot;no dice&quot;. </s>
<s> He said I'd only be able to watch tv on the montitor I'm using with the desktop. </s>
<s> So now I really have no idea what to do. </s>
<s> Is this LG monitor now useless???? </s>
<s> I'd love to have it display cable tv, while it sits right next to my desktop monitor that is displaying Windows, etc... Is there anyway this can work?? </s>
<s> Any help is greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>

<s> Got one of these -&gt; http://www.viewsonic.com/products/tventertainment/tvvideoprocessors/nextvisionn4/ It helps give the VGA display TV and video game console connections. </s>
<s> Very nice box. </s>

<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> I actually already tried to order one of those. </s>
<s> Nobody seens to carry them anymore. </s>
<s> The store I irdered it from called me back and said it had been discontinued. </s>
<s> So now I'm back on the prowl..... </s>
<s> I lucked out on geeks.com. </s>
<s> Ebay has them now and then and there are other type boxes that do the same. </s>
<s> Try VGA TV CONVERTER on google.com Bob </s>
