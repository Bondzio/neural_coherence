3103	1	103838	1189083	1189043	michael geist	5/14/05 5:20 pm	1.1160912e12	swap the drive, it's	a &lt; $10 item.
3103	2	103838	1189999	1189083	platinumppc	5/15/05 9:39 am	1.11614994e12	agreed.	i wouldn't even think about trying to troubleshoot a floppy drive. replace it.

3103	15	103838	2650888	2650906	r. proffitt	12/10/07 12:48 pm	1.19729088e12	remember ...	i can only go by what you tell me. now all you need to do is boot that diskette. again, working with the usual 95 owner they'll know how to do that. or if they forget they'll look in the bios and set the floppy as the boot device. bob
