1.1.1	System : Home Built MB : ASUS-AV-600 PROCESSOR : AMD 2700+ RUNNING AT 1.7MHZ MEMORY : 2 STICKS 564 EACH ( have swapped places with new with no changes ) VIDEO cARD : PNY VERTO GEFORCE 6200 8X AGP 256MD DDR Main HD : SERIAL ATA 80 GIG SECONDARY HD : WD 7200 120 GIG CD : SONY CDR/RW DVD : SONY DVDRW POWER SUPPLY 450 WATTS THREE FANS INCLUDING POWER SUPPLY +12 = +12.48 -12 = -16.97 +5V = +4.92 DOWN TO +4.85 DIPPING -5V = -8.78 VCORE = +1.76 +3.3V = +3.2 Windows XP-PRO SP-2 Problem is shutdown with blue screen during game playing .	St
1.1.2	I play Luxor a lot also star wars etc .	St
1.1.3	Video starts to shake , then starts to jump ball in one place now three balls over , person on left now on right .	St
1.1.4	System will either restart or end game play .	St
1.1.5	If I stop the game will get blue screen and restart , system will not shut down completely using proper shutdown procedures after game play .	St
1.1.6	Works fine with office 2003 and all associated programs .	St
1.1.7	System fans increase and decrease in speed at any time , checked AC power in via UPS and its a solid 120VAC out .	St
1.1.8	Need help on this one .	St
1.1.9	THanks in advance	St
1.2.1	I forgot to tell you that I have an ATA power supply tester and it is all green when testing this power supply .	St
1.2.2	CD/DVD 's are not running when fans slow and +5V dip down below +4.9Vs .	St
1.3.1	Your power is n't too stable , replace it .	St
1.3.2	While 450W is pretty good enough , each leg of power can be lagging , so now is a good time to replace before it starts to stress componets .	St
1.3.3	Plus , a top-notch AGP video card is very demanding and if you 're wanting hi-end output the system starts to lag as well , perforamnce wise .	St
1.3.4	Decent generic psus are in the 500W range and namebrand if 400W are stable .	St
1.3.5	Heck , some users are putting in 600W in order not to worry about power .	St
1.3.6	An ATX tester only checks for presence of power not necisarrily if clean & stable output , so its only good to say , good/bad power present if undeterminable .	St
1.3.7	However , power should flucate with 5 % ( good ) and 10 % now and then and now always .	St
1.3.8	A good AC line conditioner can help too as an extra measure .	St
1.3.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	I am montering both +5v and they are spiking up from 4.82v on one and down from 4.92v on the other .	St
1.4.2	Have a APC 500 back-UPS and it is steady on the output side/input to puter .	St
1.4.3	+12 and the rest seem to be okay except for a major downward spike then it spikes up a bit .	St
1.4.4	Any brands you would suggest ?	Ques
1.5.1	I found that & quot ; generics & quot ; when in hand and that are heavy usually can be trusted and be 500W+ .	St
1.5.2	I have found huge rating on similar looking genercis of 400W+ ( and others ) but are light as a feather sorta speak , they do n't last long .	St
1.5.3	I recommend on namebrands , Antec , Enermax , and Deer , plus Sparkle , though Enlight could work if not too demanding .	St
1.5.4	Check the websites of Geeks and NewEgg for decent psus .	St
1.5.5	tada -- -- -Willy	St
