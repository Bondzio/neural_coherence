The only PCI-Express Video card available for under $100 is the ATI X300, which is really junk, i know this because i have this card and am currently planning to upgrade to the Nvidia 6800GT.
If you are not playing any games, i suggest you at least get the X800XL, which runs for $300-400.
Not many PCI-EXPRESS cards are that cheap.
