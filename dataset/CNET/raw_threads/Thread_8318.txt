I have since tried the drive in my new PC, configured as a slave and the original (new pc) drive as master; however, configured this way, not even the master will start. the computer powers up and goes through the BIOS check but will go no further, just hangs at a blank screen. The drive also failed to work in another, third computer as well. The jumper settings are correct-- is it possible that the drive was damaged when the motherboard went out, or possibly even got a static zap? Thanks! Bunny M.
