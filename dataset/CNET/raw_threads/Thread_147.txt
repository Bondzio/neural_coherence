In cable select CDRW isn't recognized. I have tried diferent IDE cables, Different CDRW drives, The drive installed works on another computer. I have determined the lockup occurs when it tries to load turbovcd.vxd (This is listed as a virtual device driver for windows 95. Pacific Comware 1991-96) My computer is a Gateway, Intel Cereron a, 333 mhz. 66mhz external bus. BIOS American Megatrends OAAKW040 64MB Memory, FAT32 6137MB C drive 2642MB free. Your thought would be greatly appreciated.

(NT) Remark out turbovcd. Further explaination would be helpfull. Don't want to do a major screw up. Thanks for the response

Boot SAFE MODE. 2. Run MSCONFIG. 3. Uncheck the turbovcd. Try again. If MSCONFIG doesn't offer it, then find the .VXD in the C:\windows\system.ini and insert the semicolon in the line that notes turbovcd. Bob

With CDRW drive connected, system locked up at prompt prior to the one I removed. msmouse.vxd (locked up) with turbovcd.vxd unchecked. Previously would lock up at turbovcd.vxd which comes directly after the msmouse.vxd. I rebooted with the CDRW unhooked and without fixing the turbovcd.vxd, system booted correctly. Just following the msmouse.vxd is the windows screen. I would assume the CDRW problem conflicts with the opening of windows. I'm not sure where to look from here as the step by step mode ends and the system boots. Your thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks

That means the hardware in Manager and software, first from the Programs list, then Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel. Even check My Computer-Find. Then reboot. I found I have less problems installing hardware if I leave the OS disc in a drive(in case it needs a file)till it installs successfully. But thats just me. DO NOT put the deck software in till Windows installs the basic CD drive on first boot. Till it does that, you got nothing. Good luck. chuck

Proffitt	11/29/04 8:16 AM	1.10171616E12	Are the motherboard drivers current?	http://computercops.biz/postp90589.html also notes what turbovcd is as well as what other turbomodem drivers might be at play. My &quot;guess&quot; is the motherboard drivers are out of date or never installed. I don't remember you posting the make/model of machine or motherboard so I have to wait for more information before I can comment further. The forum tip does ask for such so you can get speedy resolutions. Bob

If I try and start the system with only the CDRW drive installed (I have removed the DVD drive and have cleared the Device Manager of the DVD drive) the system will lockup at the above mentioned location. This is consistant. I haven't tryed the other things you have suggested and will do this later this evening. I have been at this on and off for about three months. I have tryed two different drive manufacturers and have replaced the existing drive three times. IDE cable as well. Tryed the drive and combinations with DVD drive in all comfigurations.(locked up when ever CDRW was installed) Even tested the CDRW drive in a different computer. It worked. The drive is an IOMagic 52x24x52 internal CD-RW. Thanks for your response.

I re-read the first post and I indeed missed that info. http://members.driverguide.com/driver/detail.php?driverid=154086 only listed a 2001 BIOS and some other drivers I would PASS UP. I'd review your choice of cable and JUMPERS on the new CDRW drive since having it incorrect will cause a hang. http://downloads.guru3d.com/download.php?id=17 however finds the INTEL .INF motherboard package that could be needed, but let us file that for later. FOR NOW, just tell what the old drive jumper was and what the new drive jumper is. Bob

The system works fine with only this drive connected. (Origionally when I started this process, months ago, my Hard drive was hooked to the secondary IDE. I switched it to the Primary.) If I remove the DVD drive and install only the CDrw drive it locks the system. Set as a Master on the secondary IDE. I have tried installing both drives in all combinations of master or slave and I get the same results. If both drives are connected and both are set to cable select the system will boot, but it only recognizes the DVD drvie in device manager. I have tried the CDRW, installed alone, in both Slave and Master positions won't boot. I also have tried two different IDE cables. I started this process with a drive distributed by Mad Dog. Two different drives from them. This is the third IO magic drive I have had. This drive also operated in a different computer. I did have a computer tech come over and he upgraded the bios off the gateway web site. I have talked to Gateway and am told this drive should work in my system. IO magic says the problem has to be in my computer, however, they did exchange the drive. I'm beginning to think I have a compatability issue. Thanks again

I find the line in device manager, but how do I disable? YOur information would be greatly appreciated. I will try the drive again in another computer. For your information I have an IDE cable and the CDRW drive calls for an EIDE cable. Could this be the problem? Thanks Again Petter

It was detected in the computer stores system, but would burn a cd. I'm sending the drive back again. Could it be I need to go with a slower drive? I'm not sure in the detection process how the drive is detected. Maybe you could walk me through how the drive is detected. Petter

Since all this and more is on MSDN (the Microsoft site), you can digest it there. I'm unsure how such information will help you since what would you do with it? Good CDRW drives work fine on 98 if the machine is not &quot;broken&quot; and if the machine has motherboard drivers if such are needed. I've never had to dive much deeper than this. But there are a few that can't accept that CDRW (or other) drives fail and spend months with &quot;it can't be the drive&quot;. I've learned over the years to swap in a new drive earlier than later and to do simple tests such as trying to boot for said drives. bob

New optical and hard drives are SUPPOSED to run as cable-select. Not all do. I had to change my new drives back to Master and Slave for them to work. Second point, also ran into a different problem when I got my new DVDRW and it wasn't recognized. It would only run as Master and DVDrom as slave, not the other way around like I wanted. Gave away a perfectly good CDRW for the same reason, thinking it was bad. Wanted the DVDRW anyway. Experiment a little, it might help to figure out the problem. chuck
