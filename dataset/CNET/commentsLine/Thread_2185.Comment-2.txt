make sure the hd harnesses and those of the cd as well are properly configued either for master/slave or cs setup.
that bios is setup for &quot;auto&quot; or similar mode that the wire harness refects all that.
verify jumpers on cd & hd are what you need.
power is firmly seated, etc.. what are your results?
