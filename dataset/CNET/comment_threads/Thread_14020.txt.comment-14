can make a big difference.
MBs can be sensitive to working at all with 4 DIMMs of the same density from the same mfg or working at the 'design speed' with all 4 DIMM slots populated.
I've seen two MBs personally where DDR400 drops from 400MHz to 333MHz when you go from 2 DIMMs to 4 DIMMs.
I decided the best approach for me (on an ASUS Socket 939 MB) was to use 2-1GB DIMMS vice 4-512MB DIMMs.
And as Bob indicated...assuming you get the both combinations working at the design speed ... say 4-512MBs @ DDR400 running at 400MHz and 2-1GB DIMMs at 400MHz, it will be difficult to 'see or notice' the difference without using a benchmark.
The trick for you will be getting the 4 DIMMs working at design speed in your system..that depends on the MB.
It wasn't so long ago when it was difficult to find a MB that would work at all with 4 DIMM slots populated.
