I have a Compaq Presario with an 1.4GHz Intel Celeron Processor.
It is equipped with a Realtek Ethernet and a Broadcom 802.11b/g WLAN.
Until yesterday I was able to connect to any available network but now the system fails to connect and gives the following message: &quot;make sure the wireless switch on your computer is on&quot;.
I heard this problem is not uncommon but I have no idea what to do.
Can anybody help, please?
