1.1.1	I use an HP computer and my OS is Win XP.	St
1.1.2	I get 10Mbps download from my ISP and it's up to speed.	St
1.1.3	I have disconnected the modem electrically and also reset it to no avail.	St
1.1.4	I did this with a Tech from my ISP.	St
1.1.5	I read a lot of business articles on CNBC.	St
1.1.6	My computer downloads a printed page, then freezes and the print disappears leaving me a totally white page.	St
1.1.7	After 5 seconds the printed page reappears and the mouse wheel becomes operational about 5 seconds after that.	St
1.1.8	This also happens when I download some page from the internet that is not a page of print.	St
1.1.9	That is, the system just seems to freeze and then after a few seconds I can navagate in the page with my mouse.	St
1.1.10	Is this a buffering problem?	St
1.1.11	Could the problem be with my OS, Win XP?	St
1.1.12	Any help to cure this greatfully appreciated.	St
1.2.1	Does this happen on all web pages?	St
1.3.1	My Internet Explorer version is 8.06001.18702 Cipher strength is 128.5 Updates = 0 Yes this happens on all pages.	St
1.3.2	Thanks for trying to help an old pastor!	St

1.4.1	Example at http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-11319_7-6240575-1.html Also, while you are in there, check if the CPU heat sink is on proper.	St
1.4.2	Another member had such issues and they found the heat sink was connected with only 3 of the 4 pins.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Desktop Maintenance.	St
1.5.2	About once a month I delete all of the files in my Recycle Bin.	St
1.5.3	I use Outlook Express and once a month I delete all of the files in the Outbox, Sent Items, Deleted Items, and Drafts.	St
1.5.4	In Internet Explorer about once a month I delete all of the files Temporary Internet files, Cookies, History of websites visited and InPrivatae Filtering Data.	St
1.5.5	I don't think I have the knowledge or skills to check the CPU heat sink.	St
1.5.6	This problem is relatively new, like a month, so I doubt that could be the problem.	St
1.5.7	But, if I can't get it fixed, I take it in to a shop and tell them to check the heat sink.	St
1.6.1	Out of curiosity, what are you using for a printer and how do you have it hooked uP?	St
1.7.1	Not sure if it is you problem but when you read pdf files you sometime see this stalling.	St
1.7.2	It seems sometimes it wants to load a large piece of the file before it displays it but it does not tell you it is still downloading.	St
1.7.3	If you mess with when its in this condition I have had it then refuse to load that document untill I clear all the cache things.	St
1.7.4	For links that are PDF files you can generally get around this right click the link and save as.	St
1.7.5	If you have issue on general web pages that are HTML only hard to say ....	St
1.7.6	I tend to blame the firewall/virus software first for any strange problems.	St
1.8.1	The CNET Video I supplied covers the basics.	St
1.8.2	If you are not doing this yearly then your machine eventually has issues very much like you posted.	St
1.8.3	I have begun to wonder if this is why most folk buy new machines.	St
1.8.4	They don't do the basic maintenance.	St
1.8.5	Bob	St
1.9.1	Downloading PDG pages from the web are interrupted also.	St
1.9.2	All pages of print from the web are interrupted.	St
1.9.3	If I go to my home page, CNBC, it isn't interrupted but it probably takes more than 10 seconds to load because there's such a lot of content.	St
1.9.4	The last things to load are the Dow, Nasdaq, and S&amp;P figures and then I can go to other articles or videos offereb by the site.	St
1.9.5	Another thing I've noticed is that while the my computer seems to be stalled or the download is still going on, I can move my mouse arrow around but neither the left or right buttons work nor does the wheel word.	St
1.9.6	In addition, the arrow doesn't change into an hourglass to indicate it is downloading.	St
