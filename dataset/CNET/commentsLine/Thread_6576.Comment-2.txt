you have changed the ssid and set the encryption which is good.
take it a step further and stop the ssid from broadcasting which will stop anyone from knowing that you have a wireless network setup.
it should be a simple matter of choosing enable/disable from the online setup.
you did not say if you are using a wireless card or built in one in the laptop.
if its a card then on it you should see mac and then a mix of #'s and letters.
with it you can enable mac filtering using the interface which will only allow that card to interact with the router wirelessly.
to test ask a friend with a laptop to try and use your network and if you did it correctly they will not even be able to find it in a search.
as for the firewall it putting a wall before the one on your computer, good but not something worry about.
just use d-link online support for help in setting it up.
sorry could not give exact info as i have not use d-link but the info is general for all of the big makers of routers as they all offer the same things now.
someone else may be able to give exact info.
