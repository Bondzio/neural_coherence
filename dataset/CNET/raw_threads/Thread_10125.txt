You're more than welcome to correct or add suggestions, but heck it works for me. Cooling tips Now that summer(or anytime) is here and that added heat is certainly present, cooling is ever more important. While, I can say for certain my system isn't in an A/C'ed room, it still does its job. Why, you ask, because I follow common sense and a little knowledge goes a long ways. Your situation maybe different but could use the information, I'm passing on, though repeated many times elsewhere. 1) clean the system case insides as best as possible 2) route wire harness and cables to better airflow(rounded cables?) 3) if possible mount HDs apart from each other to reduce &quot;hot spot&quot; between them 4) use quality componets like bigger cpu fan/heatsink, extra case fan(s) 5) use your system away from direct sunlight or at least shield it 6) use system away from floor or place higher/elevate from floor Blowholes, a handmade top of case hole to mount fan/or none to vent &quot;rising airflow&quot;. Most cases if dual fans, one in front(IN) and one in back(OUT) for airflow, mount extra fans to follow that convention, unless otherwise directed. Replace power supply besides added wattage, using a dual fan setup itself. Seriously consider removing the old HD if less than 10gb, maybe 20gb as your new HD is 60-200gb now. You're old HD did its job maybe for years and then you stuff a new HD on top or below it creates a hot spot, I practially guarantee the old HD will fail or cause the new one to become flaky within 3 months. By all means if you can cool the room to a lower temperature that the air being sucked in into the case will benefit, also called &quot;ambinent&quot; temperature. tada -----Willy

The dust bunnies can easily jump in and more readily clog the works. Plus, if you have pets, the dander can too be a problem. I've seen some dirty and dusty situations and wonder why the system still works. As for my desk, it's a simple 6ft. folding table brought many moons ago. Nothing fancy in this house. Ah, yes I do have my cover off, but I didn't mention that as that's more the quick cure and house fan setup. Since I tend to run my system runs 24x7, I do decide some mornings to shutdown as I won't be back until late, by that time, the house heat is pretty hot. -----Willy

One the things I do on most of my PC cases is cut out the section in the case where the fan is mounted so it is open and then get a wire fan guard. This will allow for more air flow than the stock fan openning on most cases. John

If you have an Intel CPU... well, you obviously don't care about cool . Also, use a high-efficiency power supply like the Seasonic S12 series. The power supply doesn't generate as much waste heat and its 120mm fan helps system cooling. Definitely make sure your next case has 120mm fans. Antec makes some good ones.

I have a really good heat sink cooler and two other 80mm fans (1 front and 1 back)installed already. Sure would like to get your opinion on the cooling devices I mentioned above though. Thanks a bunch! Jobey M.

It dropped the tempurature of the primary hard drive by 10 degrees F. (verified by &quot;speedfan&quot; using built in HD sensor) About $10 for the fan I expect this will extend the life of the Hard Drive. This also reduced the tempurature of the exhaust from the power supply also, so everything is running cooler. Also, I have found that just getting the system up 4&quot; will reduce the dust quite a bit, an old phone book or two works great. My cooling issues are in the winter; the heat blows down near where this computer sits; in the summer the A/C blows into the same spot, so it runs quite a bit cooler in the summer than in the winter. I could never run a PC in the summer without A/C in Texas. When the A/C failed the last time the 2nd floor tempurature reached 118 degrees F. after two days. Clayton

2852	10	112156	1286188	1285743	Willy	7/8/05 9:11 AM	1.12081386E12	OK, let see	You said: &quot;My cooling issues are in the winter; the heat blows down near where this computer sits; in the summer the A/C blows into the same spot, so it runs quite a bit cooler in the summer than in the winter. I could never run a PC in the summer without A/C in Texas.

It was surprising that users just didn't understand having a system under direct sunlight couldn't possibility be the cause of added heat to the system. I understand being next to a window is great for viewing the outside, but there is a price to pay, system wise. If your system is direct path or your A/C, great a benefit, the flipside is in path of heat vent, not so good. Why not have a movable platform(simple dolly on wheels) and move system to a less direct path. Why, push you're luck. -----Willy

I leave my computer on 27/7/265.25 and never had a problem, i have 2 hard drives-not a problem, an extra 5 2.USBs-not a problem, a better ethernet card-not a problem.

Computer has been running this way {I never switch it off} for over a year, through the warmist June on record in a non a/c room, with no heat or hdd. problem. I have 1 extra fan blowing out at the top back of computer.

I dont know that the temps that are shown are accurate, but they do show relative temperatures when they change. Recently I noticed that the machine I'm currently using was running quite a bit hotter than when I built it. One hot day Windows shut down because the temp had reached the danger limit I had set. When built the cpu temp showed an average of about 136* F. When it shut down it showed 170*. When I opened the case the first thing I did was remove the cpu heat sink fan. As I suspected, there was a thin layer of dust over the top of the cooling fins. Very little air was being blown down between them. I cleaned them and, of course, all the case openings, etc. as well. Now all is well and it's running at 136* again.
2852	14	112156	1287279	1274675	bobncat	7/8/05 4:35 PM	1.1208405E12	Cooling PC - Air Flow	Air Flow depends upon the ability to push undesirable hot air out and pull cooling air in. Sounds obvious but: Imagine a straw with one hole at each end. It is simple to push air through the system as pressure is focused. Now punch a series of holes and your not getting much air out, as seen by how you have to sit down after the effort :&gt; Same with cutting holes in the case. The fans are not assisted by pressure to push the air out. Same goes for just placing fans anywhere. My strategy is having the front case fan pull air in and the rear case as an exhaust. Its just a matter of which way you face the fan. Leaving the side covers off just invites dust and real bugs, not to mention the integrity of the case is compromised--- for those who stack hardware. My speciality is on software, yet the idea of memory and hd cooling fans is met with skepticism. Same for the double cpu cooling fan. This is a great msg thread.

It works expecially well on my Athlon XP 1700+ which went from 115F to 97F normal temp. with CpuIdle Extreme. Also big fans, my 120mm keeps my two HDs at just a hair above room temperture most of the time.

A PC stand w/wheels in &quot;Home Improvements Catalog&quot; I've used this company for years for various &quot;good stuff&quot;. http://www.ImprovementsCatalog.com #265919 Mobile CPU Stand $19.99. Plastic. It adjust for width. Sets right up. I keep my home alittle on warm side to save money. Plus three cats with lots of fur. But I mainly got it to get my new HP Media Center up more to turn it on easier. Some new PCs are so small making the button waaay down there to lean over and turn it on. (oh yeah lazy . Helps your back though. But this has been a great help for many reasons. The PC fan grille stays much cleaner, I can reach the button, and move the PC if I need to to vacuumn. The room fan or air can circulate around the PC now. It's $19.99. I'm tight on money but this was a very worthwhile purchase for me. Never dreamed there was a stand out there. I was searching the house for something to use. Also if you have it up higher for the new ones you can still use the top to lay your papers or current projects on handy to the PC. I have to place my PC beside me, to the left due to lack of room but it's handy. My old PC was so tall I could use it as a little table for current notes CDs & Zip drives. I'm usualy frugal and did have an item stacked under it but this idea beats what I had. Much airier for the PC and that's the point. hope someone else finds this stand useful too. Like I said it's really wonderful for the newer samller units especially.

My latest is to mount a 80 mm fan in the right side of the case--ie, the side that is next to the motherboard. On the outside of this, one inch in from the sides, I mounted a spacer 3/4 inch thick and on top of that I placed an air filter. The fan fits through a hole and faces the internal racks for the harddrives so now I have clean filtered air blowing directly on these units==they are cool to the touch. The fan also lights up the case which I view thru the clear panel on the left side of the puter. (All parts scavenged except filter for total cost of $3) I ran for years without the sides mounted on the case until a dropped pen bounced into the case--nothing happened, but I was warned.

I have found those look-alike milk crates while decent do vary in quality and break more easily than the real McCoy, so placing too much weight shouldn't be over-looked. But, yeah, you seem to have a good setup going. I used to make shelves out of them and stash all sorts of papers, until I got some real shelving. tada -----Willy

It's not so good because the hot air takes longer to circulate out. If your room is constantly cold, then you might be able to pull it off*** ++++++++++++++++++ +Negitive AirFlow+ ++++++++++++++++++ -Negitive AirFlow is when your fans are sucking out more air than they are forcing in. -Works well even in cramped or hot rooms. -Circulates the Hot Air OUT a lot faster. ***I use negitive airflow, I also recommend it. Blowing air on your componets are one thing, but it wont mean jack if your blowing hot air on them. So having a case setup to circulate new air in and circulate the onld air out even faster is, in my opinion, the smarter thing to do.*** My Setup(Good Example of Negitive Airflow setup): +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Air Blowing OUT- Rear: 2x 80mm fans Front Bottom: One 80mm Fan +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Air Blowing IN- Side Of Case: One 80mm Fan +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Neutral Cooling- -CPU Fan -Video Card Fans -ChipSet Fan -Memory Cooler -HardDisk Cooler +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Hope this Helped! -Alan

Cooling performance could whind down because the filter will collect dust and wont be able to suck the dust out through your exausht fans. You'll be changing or cleaning filters more offten than using an aircan to clean you componets. Those preciouse moments when the filters clog up before you clean them could cause unwanted damage. I only say this out of personal experience and research. You'll also notice that computer companies only use small mesh grilles at most. Not because the companies want to rip you off, its because the companies know the danger of dust clogging airflow. Dust can also start fires. Remember ALWAYS that filters are ment to do one thing- and that is to TRAP DUST!!!! Trapped Dust = Poor airflow
2852	26	112156	2751210	2750623	3rdalbum	4/14/08 5:07 AM	1.20814962E12	Another tip	Some cases have fans with a little switch for fan speed, rather than having it controlled by software. Open up your case and see if your fans have any of these switches, and put them all up a notch. I've also heard that it's a good idea to have more fans blowing out than in. The fans blowing out will also pull in fresh air from the front. While we are focusing on airflow through the case itself, don't forget about airflow through your whole room. If you have windows on opposite sides of the room (or as opposite eachother as possible), open them both up. If you get a flow of air through your room, that will cool your room and therefore cool your box.

I had hoped in general terms that cooling tips would benefit those that read and passed along their tips. It seems it has, thanks. I like to add that cooling in general has been taken a serious step by vendors to provide &quot;bolt-on&quot; items to better cool your system. These are: 1) replace original cpu fan/heatsink(HSF) with a better rated one 2) add extra fan(s) on case or larger size fan(s) 3) use water cooling 4) replace case side covers, extra fan holes/exhaust 5) replace/wrap wire harness(better airflow) 6) relocate psu to bottom(depends) 7) use of buss/slot fans 8) use of refrigeration cooler or peltier units 9) better cases in general 10) laptop/notebook cooler Any cutting, removal or additional work to a system case is considering &quot;modding&quot;. The term implies you've done something extra or done DIY project beyond the norm. As everyone's system is different, what works for you is obviously better outcome. Some users have relocated their system to custom cases(they build). As for up off floor statement, that was meant to imply to remove off floor to lessen dust intake and pet dander, etc.. It needn't be much, but some users have used milk crate. A small table does fine as well but again what works for you, is fine. Please add your comments. thanks -----Willy
