I find this happens when XP is installed, but the person installing XP is unaware about motherboard drivers.
Many are just discovering that Microsoft does not do this for us as well as we should avoid any driver offered by Windows Update.
You didn't write about the machine so I can't offer what driver package I'd try.
Try this.
Boot XP and remove the CDROM in the device manager.
On reboot XP will add it back in.
If it's a simple issue that may do the trick.
