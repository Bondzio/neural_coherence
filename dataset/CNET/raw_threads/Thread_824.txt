He formatted the hd so the &quot;work related info&quot; would be gone. I know what formatting does and I need help to restore it. It is a 20gb Quantum. It had win98 on it and also drivers for cdrom, usb and ethernet. I have a 2gb hd with win 98 on it but no such drivers (base system) I want to run the 2gb as the primary and the 20 gb as the slave so I can reinstall the OS on it. Any suggestions?

The one that is usefull is a 2gb harddrive that has win98 and a handful of other programs on it. Dont ask me how they got all of that on a little hd. My problem is that the 20gb harddrive i got was formatted. I use the 2gb to boot the gateway system that the 20gb came in, and Im trying to create a new operating system on the 20gb. I need to find new drivers so I can use the cdrom, and I need to find either win98 or xp to put on the 20gb after I get the new drivers installed. The problem at hand is the jumpers on the back of the hd's. The 2gb has 3 sets of prongs but no jumper. The 20gb has 4 sets of prongs with the jumper on the second set away from the ribbon. I want to know where the jumper needs to be so that the 2gb harddrive is the primary and the 20gb harddrive is the slave.

It is designed for win98 and has the 20gb harddrive. The hd in this computer was formatted by a guy that I work with. The second &quot;donor&quot; computer is a no name brand built by my cousins husband. It has a 2gb harddrive that has win98, microsoft office and a handful of other programs. He uses winzip to fit everything on it. I am trying to rebuild the Gateway using the small hd from the donor to boot the system, then installing win98 or xp on the 20gb harddrive. I cant get the system to show the two hd's. It will boot from the little one but it only shows that I have one, not two. I put the jumper on the 2gb in the first spot closest to the ribbon. The 20gb I have put the jumper in the second spot. I am stumped. Also,the little hd only has drivers for video and 3.5 floppy. I need to find win98 drivers for cdrom, usb and soundblaster sound card. Any advice or suggestions would be great. Thanks

Today we use 80 CONDUCTOR IDE CABLES (see google.com about that) and both drives are jumped to Cable Select. Even a 2000 era PC should have that cable and use those jumper settings. The CDROM is never a CDROM DRIVER issue. When you install the motherboard drivers, the CDROM works. Same for USB. Which leaves the soundblaster. Google is your friend here. The soundblaster drivers are a bit too easy to find. Bob
