<s> I have used my yahoo mail for some time and love it. </s>
<s> However, I recently changed some settings for IE6.0 due to security concerns that I read about on CNET, and after making those changes (disabling the active scripting) and my yahoo mail page changed drastically after that! </s>
<s> My page used to have a box on the left side of the screen showing my folders etc. </s>
<s> and now when I hit the mail button I go to my inbox and can't even get to the other folders! </s>
<s> I can't seem to find a way to get back my old mail page and even after resetting the security items in my IE 6.0 security tab, the old page is gone! </s>
<s> The new page does not appear to be the most modern version of the mail inbox page and I am trying to put back the old controls! </s>
<s> HELP! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> IEFIX on google.com which pushes IE back to its stock settings. </s>
<s> Hopefully Microsoft will fix IE soon. </s>
<s> We can use Firefox or Mozilla till then. </s>
