i found a workaround here:  posted by: melonhead posts 6 answer re: &quot;windows cannot connect to the printer.
access is denied&quot; -please help.
answer was this post helpful ?
reply quote i had the same problem.
i found a solution.
logically it makes no sense to me, but it worked so... go to control panel.
choose printer.
then choose add printer.
chooseadd a local printer.
click on create a new port.
the default in the drop down box is local port.
do not change that.
click next.
a dialogue box will appear asking for you to enter a port name.
type in the \\computer name\printer name ie.
my computer's name is basement and the printer name is epsonsty so i typed in \\basement\epsonsty yahoo!
it worked.
go figure!
i guess microsoft thinks printers on a intranet are local.
hope this helps someone else so they don't spend the hours i did on it!
// it worked for me.
