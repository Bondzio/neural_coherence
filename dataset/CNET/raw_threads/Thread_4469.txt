Its a Compaq 6016US with AMD Athlon XP 1800 (1.53GHz) wiht 512mb PC2100 DDR Total system Memory and 60GB UltraDMA Hard Drive. I use computer mainly for internet, email, photo storage and now am getting into photoediting with photoshop elements 5.0. He photoediting software is making the computer slugging and its a pain to switch between windows while its running. I am better of trying ot upgrade RAM or just buying a new computer. My budget for new computer is less than $1500 but I really would rather not have to if I don't. THanks for any advice. sarah

You could also add 512MBs RAM to the existing system and that would likely help too. . . . about $50. http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=Presario+6000+Series+%28Athlon+processors%29 VAPCMD
