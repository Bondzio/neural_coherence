1.1.1	i've spent hours trying to reset my netbooks bios (i misplaced my password somewhere in my head or have totally lost it) searched online and came across this link but it doesn't work for my laptop.	St
1.1.2	http://macles.blogspot.com/2008/08/acer-aspire-one-bios-recovery.html now my netbook doen't have warranty anymore unfortunately i've also tried FLASHING bios from Windows 7, with no luck... i'm not sure if FLASHING is suppose to clear BIOS as well or just update it i've gone as far as dismantling the netbook and to my dismay the CMOS battery is soldered (attached) to the board which means i have to break the solder and re-solder it back (again unfortunately i have zero soldering experience and have no intentions on trying) i also couldn't find any information or manual on the Mainboard for the Aspire One so i couldn't even find where the likely spots for short-circuiting and cold-reseting the BIOS i also disabled alternative booting options in BIOS please help...

1.2.1	Shorting out board traces is a great way to solve the problem (permanently.)	St
