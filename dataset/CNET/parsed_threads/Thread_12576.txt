<s> I would like to set up a Wireless B network in my home, not for my laptop, but for my Palm TX. </s>
<s> The reason is for the Palm TX has wifi, but can only connect to 802.11 Wireless B Networks, so I am currently out of luck. </s>
<s> I have an 802.11 Wireless G network, but that is after B came out. </s>
<s> I want a B router and range expander to cover my whole house. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> What are the right products for an 802.11 wireless b network with a router and range expander? </s>
<s> most 802.11g are downward compatible with 802.11b already. </s>
