<s> I have A LOT of slides and 35mm negatives I'd like to preserve digitally. </s>
<s> Any recommendations and or comments on the PrimeFilm 3650U scanner? </s>
<s> This isn't good. </s>
<s> No reviews at http://www.epinions.com/pr-Pacific_Image_Prime-Film_3650u_Flim_Scanner For now, I'll keep noting the Coolscan. </s>
<s> Such as http://www.epinions.com/Nikon_Coolscan_IV_ED_APS_Film_Adapter__Scanners_9296 But look at the other coolscan units too. </s>

<s> A few reviews of this scanner said it was easy to install. </s>
<s> That's not been my experience on a Win98SE machine. </s>
<s> Unless you can get some better feedback from users, I'd not buy one. </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> : Unless I can get a refund, or get it working, I'll have a new, unused one avialable real cheap, real soon! </s>
<s> Hi- I too am having a terrible time getting my new scanner to scan properly. </s>
<s> I'm running on an HP with Windows XP, don't think my computer is the problem. </s>
<s> When scanning slides, I get half the photo green, half red. </s>
<s> Anybody have any idea what would be causing this? </s>
<s> It's a brand new scanner, I have yet to have any useable scans completed. </s>
<s> Grrrrrr... </s>
<s> I too have had intermittant problems with the otherwise fantastic scanner. </s>
<s> My issue is that occassionally I get colored bars that run parallel to the long (width) of the slide. </s>
<s> I have yet to find its cause and a consistant method of fixing the problem. </s>
<s> The4se bar may cover the entire slide or may show only a few in varried positions, but always apparllel along the width. </s>
<s> IBM T43 with 1Gb RAM and 80 Gb HD in Windows Explorer Professional. </s>
<s> Is there as help out there on this matter? </s>
