i don't see any user access to the battery so my bet is that it's a return to factory as you wear out the battery.
-&gt; about digitizer accuracy.
i find in all the models with the usual touch sensor (aka capacitive) that a stylus works best and we have to write larger and shrink it later.
again, i am doing this but it appears you have yet to use these products.
so here is how i would write on almost any of the usual tablets.
1. grab the stylus.
2. start the app (natch.)
3. get to where i need to write.
4. write at about 2 times the size i want and then use the note taking app's feature to shrink it to the good looking normal size.
only those that have not used these devices would think they could write as if they were on college ruled paper.
