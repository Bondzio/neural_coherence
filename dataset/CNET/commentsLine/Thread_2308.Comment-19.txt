all skill levels show up here.
i can't know if you have never seen a jumper setting or heard about cmos or bios settings.
is the home page of this board.
page 39 of  (the manual) shows which slot to install one stick of ram.
page 42 tells you which of the two pcie slots to use for the video card.
page 54 shows four power connections for this board (did you get them all?)
page 55 shows &quot;setting the bios configuration jumper&quot;.
sorry if anything upsets you.
this is not my intention.
