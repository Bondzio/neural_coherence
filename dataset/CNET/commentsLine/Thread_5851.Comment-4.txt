but there are copies of said files back on the machine you made the dvdrw on.
time to go get those.
a recurring lesson is that if you want to lose files, make sure there is only one copy on one &quot;thing.&quot; -&gt; next up.
go get zero assumption recovery and getdataback and see what they think.
if blank, then it's likely that you can send it to drivesavers and for a few hundred they'll see what can be done.
