hi, i have an 06' dell b110 and it came with a god-awful integrated graphics card.
i wanted to upgrade it, no big deal just dissable the old one right?
i called into dell and the guy said that a new graphics card could never be installed.
that sounded ridiculous to me.
does anyone know why my computer would not be upgradable?
given i will probably have to upgrade my power supply as well (250wt)
