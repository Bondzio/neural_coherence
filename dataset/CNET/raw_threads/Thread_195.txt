Mid tower case............................80 bucks Mid range vid card........................100 bucks Psu to support the new vid card...........80 bucks I would suggest that you test the new machine as is. If it does everything you need it to do and the only problem is that you don't like the looks of the case......put something in front of it so you can't see it......be frugal!

But i do want to change my tower , i have $50 that i can spend like right now .But i can stretch up to $100 can you suggest me any good tower ? also i have never changed towers or made my own pcs so i have no idea. Will it be easy or is it going to be a hard job ? is it like opening the screw and put it back in next or or pretty hard ? thanks for help

Moving the innards from a small case to a large case seems like an easy task............until you figure out the cables won't reach.....bummer. Or the large case has no mounting for the small mobo that came out of the small case.....bummer. Moving the innards from a proprietary case to a standard case may turn out to be a PITA.....or not. If you do this I suspect your warranty went.....POOF.

I suggest you find one that supports atx and micro atx. Better chance the gateway mobo will fit. With a little luck it will just be a matter of moving parts from one case to the other.
