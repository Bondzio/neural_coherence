there are virus that can exist after a format, these reside in the mbr or the &quot;drive fat&quot; that helps eliminate bad drive areas&quot; part of the manufacturing process.
these are real sneaky or profound threats, so don't discount their presence, while formatting can work for typical re-use, i find using a &quot;disk wiper&quot; better suited.
the wiper doesn't format per se, but does clean any old data and setting or os fat tables, once done you use the os setup which will format as usual and prepare the hd.
i had great success with dban and killdisk, both free versions, run once and then later reformat hd for use.
also, take a grain of advise don't use too old of hds, they still crash even in ext.
usb cases.
a good 16gb flash drive is better for typical use rather than dragging an 40gb around even if more space, but you can use it all once practiced.
