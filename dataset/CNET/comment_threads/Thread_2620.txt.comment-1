Hello, Every so often my connection drops out on my network.
I have 3 comps connected through the router.Linksys BEFSR41 Firmware version 1.45.7 I just reset the router and it works fine.
I am using Win XP Pro VER 5.1 SP1 and a cable modem.
I have no other issues with any of the computers.
(win98se on both other comps.)
I have checked and my network connection details which look as below...
Physical Address: 00-0C-6B-1A-CC-63 IP Address: 192.168.1.100 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1 DHCP Server: 192.168.1.1 Lease Obtained: 30/10/2003 5:39:33 PM Lease Expires: 31/10/2003 5:39:33 PM Is it normal for the lease to expire daily like this?
Has anyone had this type of issue?
Thanks Mike
