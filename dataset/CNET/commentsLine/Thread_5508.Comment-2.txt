hi - i have run into this type of problem several times in the past.
it sounds like something has happened to corrupt or damage your master file table or file allocation table, that tells your system what is on your hard drive and where.
the first time i had this problem, i looked for data recovery software, and downloaded a number of trials to see if any of them could find anything.
the one piece of software i found that was easy to use and saw everything on my drive was a product called getdataback from runtime.org.
there are two versions, one for fat and one for ntfs.
you can download the trial versions and make sure whether it finds anything before you actually purchase it, but the price is reasonable.
you would hook up your external drive to your pc, install this software on your internal drive, and use it to find files on the external drive.
you can then copy them to another location (your internal drive, or another external drive).
it can take a long time to run, depending on the size of your drive, but i have always been able to recover everything with it.
as long as your system can see the external drive, the software should work.
the sooner you do it the better, though - if you have a hardware problem on your external drive, it could get to the point where it would not be recoverable using this method.
good luck!
