<s> What one? </s>
<s> AMD Athlon 64 3000+ Venice 90nm (Socket 939 OR AMD Athlon 64 3200+ Venice 90nm (Socket 939) * there is a 20 step in price (that's like $39) * would be be worth getting the more expensive one? </s>
<s> * would I notice a difference in gaming? </s>
<s> but my understanding is that the video card has more impact on gaming, and then the amount of memory. </s>
<s> That slight difference in CPU speeds should be third. </s>
<s> So put the money in the video card if you have it. </s>
<s> Check with OZOS on which card. </s>
<s> I know almost nothing about overclocking, but I have heard it is quite easy to overclock a 3000+ to a 3200+ and a 3200+ to a 3400+ </s>
<s> If .. 3000+ &gt; 3200+ 3200+ &gt; 3400 I might go with he 3200+, not sure though ... </s>
<s> I am planing on ANOTHER PC build so if I did get a 3000+ I could later get a 3200+ and pop the 3000+ in me older one! </s>
<s> It depends on you MB. </s>
<s> I have a MSI Neo with a AMD64 3000+ running the FSB at 210Mz. </s>
<s> This takes the CPU up to the 3200+ range. </s>
<s> MSI has an program app that does this in XP. </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> A motherboard supporting PCExpress with a video card that pushed your finances in combination with dual channel ram would hedge you for the future as well as a performance demon...... Take a look at AMD systems at WWW.gogocomputers.com in the $899. </s>
<s> range to give you an idea.... the video card could be improved to the nvidia 6800 series and the hard drive could be changed to a Hitachi for improve hard drive response..... thats what I would do hands down.... </s>
<s> I was skeptical of Hitachi harddrives until I bought a 160 gig unit 7K250 Deskstar not expensive but performance dripping... maybe investigate further .... system startups and file transfers were reduced in regards to time .... you may ask what do I reference this to? </s>
<s> Maxtor, Western digital, Quantum, Fugitsu and Seagate used on my family system building..... Do the research with the net ... Google it , use TomsHardwareCorner, etc. </s>
<s> hope this is of help ..... </s>
<s> You may want to overclock GPU. </s>
<s> They're much easier to overclock, and more heat resistant, so it's safer too. </s>
<s> It can be done just by using a user-friendly software utility like this one: http://www.guru3d.com/rivatuner/ CPU OCing is tricky, and you really shouldn't do it, espeically for AMD processors. </s>
<s> Sometimes, it can end up with higher clock rate, but lower performance. </s>
<s> Listen, what you want to do is you want to buy the AMD Athlon 64 3200+ Venice Integrated into Chip FSB 512KB L2 Cache Socket 939 Processor - OEM. </s>
<s> This comes without a fan, so you'll have to supply your own. </s>
<s> Tigerdirect.com is the best place to buy anything, so buy it from there. </s>
<s> But the reason you want to buy the 3200 over the 3000 is because the 3200 is the most easily overclocked chipset in the WORLD!!!! </s>
<s> You can take this in-exspensive $190 procesor and overclock it to 2.6 GHZ!!!! </s>
<s> Yes, thats right the 3200 can be as powerful as the $900 clawhammer fx55 chipset. </s>
<s> So the answer is buy the Venice 3200 (939 socket) with the ASUS delux SLI motherboard (future profing) and and NVIDIA 6800 GT. </s>
<s> OR go with a nice DFY motherboard. </s>
<s> Hope it was helpful. </s>
<s> to hva a higher clock speed but slower performance? </s>
<s> i've heard that amd's were the better cpu's to oc cause they were designed to take up to a 33% oc as is. </s>
