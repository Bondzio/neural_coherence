Is there a device, a pedal, that will allow me to stop, start, rewind, and fastforward audio- and video-recordings without taking my hands off the keyboard? I am transcribing interviews, and a pedal that is compatible with RealPlayer will be useful. The computers involved are of diffent operating systems and models. I posed this question to RealPlayer technical support, and they referred me to CNet. Thank you, Jeffrey Lofton [Edited by: admin to remove member's phone number--Note to Jeffrey--it's probably not a good idea to post your phone number in public forum for the world to see.]

Sounds like good work porting to Linux, MacOSX, Windows versions, and support of all the machines. My background includes some CCTV programming and while I know what you are after, your specs push this product's price through the level that most will pay for. With cross OS and platform support that could hit the 1 million dollar mark with some exorbitant fees for onsite support to sort out specific machine issues. Bob
