You may want quietness as a good feature, so if you can't hear one operate, get it, but most run fairly quiet. Those that run using the USB port for power, beware as that takes power less available for long periods of usage. tada -----Willy

It works pretty well but it might be a bit small for your laptop. My boyfriend has a 15&quot; widescreen laptop and got an Antec notebook cooler. It has two (two-speed) fans and the surface is large enough to cover the entire base of his laptop. The only annoyance may be that the Antec has a bright blue LED light that turns on when you have the fan plugged in (via USB). Otherwise, it might be the best one for you.
