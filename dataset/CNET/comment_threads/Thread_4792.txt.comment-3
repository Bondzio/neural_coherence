its like i dont get u clearly, pls let me explain myself using an illustration: I have an Adobe installer which is inside an external HDD/ I want to give out this HDD to a person to install Adobe from it, but i dont want that person to tamper with the Adobe, just install and return my HDD i.e dont copy my Adobe or corrupt it.
Please, what can i do or is there any advance external HDD i can purchase that has this features?
Thanks, Proffit.
