I'd say there's a good chance the old drive will also be cable select.
Just to make sure, there's a chart at this site: http://support.wdc.com/techinfo/general/jumpers.asp As far as the old drive crashing, unless you've been having trouble with it, I don't see why it would.
After you install the second drive, you'll need to format it and then you'll be able to use it as extra storage.
