jose, for most people, those types of systems are indeed the way to go.
embedding the graphics chip on the motherboard is a good way for the manufacturer's to keep the cost down, and make them more affordable for everyone.
the obviouos drawback is you may be limited later.
you'll really have to check the system, and see what it can accomodate.
you're going to want to see if it has an available pcie slot, and the type you're after for video is an x16.
you'll also want to see if there's a power connector already there to power that video card you may later purchase.
consider the games you may want to play, too.
many of the newer on-line mmorpg's will require 256 dedicated ram at the very minimum, and at that level they'll be almost unplayable.
for performance, you're looking at 896mb dedicated ram on the video card.
i've got a special nvidia with 1.7g, and it's a great card.
my previous was a p4 dual core, at 3g, with 256mb video, and i upgraded the whole computer because it didn't have enough horsepower.
my suggestion (which is the same as i give almost every time): list the things you need (or want) to do with the computer.
check the requirements for each of those tasks, and get the system that will perform them.
spend the most you can afford now and get the best system you can, otherwise you'll be back very quickly trying to figure out how to upgrade it.
sometimes it requires saving for a few months and putting a couple hundred aside to dedicate to that system.
budgets are tight for (almost) everyone these days, and we're all watching our money closer than we did.
best of luck!
