<s> Desktop with Windows XP Toshiba Laptop with Windows Vista Linksys Wireless G WRT54G Broadband Router Arris Cable Modem HP PSC1400 All in one Printer Having problems setting up a network environment allowing my laptop to access my printer connected to my desktop. </s>
<s> I want to be able to be in another room in the house, and print from my laptop without having to connect my laptop to the printer. </s>
<s> I have ran the network wizard and the laptop sees the main computer name, but that is all. </s>
<s> Any help will be greatly appreciated&gt; what do I need to make this work? </s>
<s> do you have a duplicate account on your desktop that will authenticate you and grant access to the printer? </s>
<s> not sure what you mean by duplicate account, try to explain in a way ill understand. </s>
<s> Have you log in. </s>
<s> Let's say you log in as &quot;dudley&quot;. </s>
<s> Now when you want to print to another machine's printer, &quot;dudley&quot; must have an account on the other machine. </s>
<s> Plus all the other things that need to be right as well. </s>
<s> Simple test for that. </s>
<s> Go to the other machine, log off and can &quot;dudley&quot; log in with the same name and password as the other machine? </s>
<s> OK thanks Ill give it a try! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> We recently went through the same thing. </s>
<s> When my husband loaded the printer driver on my laptop, everything worked fine. </s>
<s> Hey hadnt thought of that, I actually went to a bookstore here and did some reading. </s>
<s> And that was one thing I did not do, so Im gonna give that a shot. </s>
<s> Thanks.. </s>
