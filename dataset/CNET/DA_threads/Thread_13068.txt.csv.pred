1.1.1	I have a question regarding networking and Slingboxes.	St
1.1.2	In a few weeks, my client will be moving from one major US city to another.	St
1.1.3	As he finds it unlikely that his new city will broadcast his old city's football team (he's a big fan) he plans to use a slingbox system to transfer his old television service to his new home.	St
1.1.4	Unfortunately, his TV is in his living room and his modem (the slingbox works via internet) is in his bedroom.	St
1.1.5	My client would rather not run a cable through the house, and would like to know what the best alternative would be in his situation.	St
1.1.6	He is aware of the Slingbox Turbo system which runs the signal through the houses electric wiring, but he is unsure if this will work in his situation as he lives in an older mobile home and is not confident in the wiring or the circuit breakers in our house to provide a clear, clean data transfer.	St
1.2.1	will stutter over wireless but SD works fine, even with 11g.	St
1.2.2	Also he needs someone to caretake the network since WiFi does hiccup sometimes.	St
1.2.3	Might want to try 11a since there are fewer users in that band.	St
1.3.1	Sorry, but I am admittedly a bit unfamiliar with this.	St
1.3.2	What is SD?	St
1.3.3	What equipment does it take to set up and what does it cost?	St
1.3.4	Alternatively, where could I go to gather more information?	St
1.4.1	Start at slingmedia.com or cheaper silicondust.com.	St
