new xeons and core2duo are based on the same architecture and will perform almost the same with the same clock speed and cache size.
here are benchmarks which show the xeon 5000 series and core2duo are neck-and-neck with most apps like photoshop:  desktop boxes usually offer faster ram than workstations because of the added cost of ecc ram.
ddr2-800 is the fastest ecc ram available, but ddr2-1066 and higher is available in non-ecc form.
