1.2.1	u should go for retail parts processor : amd athlon 64 3000+ hard drive : western digital or seagate memory- corsair value ram is good psu- thermaltake psu ( the $ 30- $ 40 ) one will do fine gfx card : since not much gaming i would go for nvidia 6600 optical drives- get a dvd burner around $ 50 whichever brand u like case- ur choice win .	St
1.2.2	xp home u can get oem but i would go for the retail , u can see it on sale during weekend ads sometimes , easier to get than online media card reader/floppy- if necessary u should go newegg for all ur parts .	St
1.2.3	great price and service keyboard/mouse , speakers , monitor of ur choice y would u want to go through all this trouble to build ur computer when u can pick up a computer around $ 800 and stick in a low-end gfx card for less than $ 1100 and less time	St

1.4.1	arctic silver thermal compound and case fans .	St
1.5.1	When you settle on a CPU and motherboard ( a good place to start ) , see what cables , adapters , and hubs that come with the motherboard .	St
1.5.2	This will allow you to purchase some OEM parts .	St
1.5.3	For example , the retail versions of hard drives and DVD drives come with cables and usually some software .	St
1.5.4	The OEM versions do not not come with cables or software ( usually ) , but you can use the cables that come with the motherboard .	St
1.6.1	yea but will i need software	St
1.7.1	You do n't need software for the HD .	St
1.7.2	Any utility software that comes with the HD can be downloaded free from the mfg website .	St
1.7.3	If you need CD/DVD burning software , go ahead and get the retail version of the DVD drive .	St
1.7.4	I think it 's worth it if you do n't have any on the computer .	St
1.7.5	Some folks end up using free burning software anyway ( CDBurnerXP ) .	St
1.7.6	You can find some retail DVD burner drives for about the same price as OEM .	St
1.7.7	One of my favorites is the NEC 3540A ( retail or OEM , check NewEgg.com ) .	St
1.7.8	Buy OEM Windows XP when you make the qualifying hardware purchase .	St
1.7.9	The best deals that I find are the weekly rebate specials from brick-n-mortar stores ( CompUSA , CircuitCity , Staples , etc . )	St
1.7.10	The retail price after rebate often beats online OEM ; however , you have to get lucky with rebates being offered when you need the part .	St
1.7.11	In general , though , most of the hardware and software for my builds is OEM and comes from NewEgg.com , Geeks.com , ChiefValue.com , et al .	St
1.7.12	Price comparision sites like PriceGrabber.com and Shopping.com come in handy .	St
