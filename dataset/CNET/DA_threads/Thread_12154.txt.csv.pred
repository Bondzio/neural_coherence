1.1.2	Since I tend to create lots of graphic files ( 3d studio max , illustrator , photoshop , short animations ) , I generally create around 3-4 gigabytes of information every three months .	St
1.1.3	I have been burning cd 's each semester to store old files that I only occasionally need to access for portfolio purposes .	St

1.1.7	If so , can soemone tell me why ?	Ques
