i have spoken with you all a few times before, about the same computer ... i've been trying to fix it since before the summer.
i just got a new processor, the ram works (tested it mom's computer), and the motherboard is new, though i suppose it could have been doa.
technically, the processor could be doa too, but i really hope not, because i want a working computer (that's not my mom's).
hah... whenever i turn it on, the fans go, but my monitor light remains orange (inactive).
i noticed something, though ... when using another monitor, instead of remaining orange, it flashes between orange and green when the computer is turned on (when off, the light is orange).
computer on or off, the viewsonic e70 (my usual monitor) shows orange computer off, the compaq p50 shows orange; on, it flashes orange & green.
that tells me that the monitor is getting some sort of signal stating the computer has turned on, but isn't sending signal properly.
another note: the motherboard i have has onboard video, and i have a pci express x16 nvidia graphics card.
i've tried with the onboard video, as well as plugging in the video card and using that.
same results for both.
did i receive a bad motherboard?
what's newegg's policy on returning motherboards?
gosh, this is frustrating ... thanks in advance for the help!
