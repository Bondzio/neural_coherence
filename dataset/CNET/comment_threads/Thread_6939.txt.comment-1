I have A celeron 1.7 GHz PC 128 MB RAM, using XP and Windows 98 on different partitions.
Yesterday i had just been trying to upgrade BIOS-&quot;Award softwares&quot;-using motherboard-&quot;Gigabyte&quot; cd.It asked for some .bin file from MB cd, so I searched and okayed.
it then asked to restart the system so restarted... now the real problem started, now system does not start at all.
i cant even go upto bios setting prompt.
it says &quot;BIOS Checksum error&quot; and &quot;boot disk failure insert system disk and press enter&quot;.Inserting motherboard cd or XP cd doesn't help it as system doesnot detect cd-drive and says boot disc failure.
when i insert the floppy it detects the floppy but cant boot from it, says again &quot;disc failure pls insert system disc and press enter, and that too doesnot work.
I am screwed.... can any1 suggest any solution.... i think a few settings are missing.. but i dont have ny idea... plz help
