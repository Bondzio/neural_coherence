<s> I have an HP 7160 Media Center PC, (old, I know, but good enough, not ready to upgrade yet) Comcast cable modem, and linksys WRPT54G broadband router. </s>
<s> (2 phone ports, wired ports, wireless) I am constantly disconnected from the internet, have to get up to go across the house to unplug/replug/reset the router so much I count it as &quot;exercise.&quot; It takes forever to do anything on the net. </s>
<s> If I had a more constant connection, I might find time to actually do some REAL exercising! </s>
<s> (-: What router should I buy to replace it? </s>
<s> Thanks for your suggestions. </s>
