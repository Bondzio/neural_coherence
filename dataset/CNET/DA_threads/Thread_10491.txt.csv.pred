1.1.1	I 'm trying to find the best bang for the buck configuration for a 4 monitor desktop .	St
1.1.2	My desire is to use 4 ViewSonic VX2025WM 's ( which received high marks in its review here ) running in their native resolution ( 1680 x 1050 ) turned 90 degrees ( portrait orientation ) .	St
1.1.3	I 'm considering using 2 XFX GeForce 8800 GTS ( 320MB ) cards to drive them .	St
1.1.4	I have a dual PCI express slot motherboard with a Core Duo processor and I 'm running XP SP2 .	St
1.1.5	I believe my most demanding application will be video editing .	St
1.1.6	I use the Xbox 360 for games .	St
1.1.7	I have a few questions that I ca n't seem to get a straight answer to : 1 .	St
1.1.8	Is changing the output orientation from landscape to portrait a video card software issue or an XP issue , i.e .	St
1.1.9	does XP SP2 support this directly ?	Ques
1.1.10	2 .	St
1.1.11	Does this XFX card support running in a dual card configuration ?	Ques
1.1.12	3 .	St
1.1.13	Should I upgrade to the 640 MB card ?	Ques
1.2.1	Just recently we discussed and I disclosed no payoff in highend GPU cards at this link - & gt ; http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-7582_102-0.html ? forumID=28 & threadID=236651 & messageID=2420463 # 2420463 So at the office we use simple dual output cards ( ATI or Nvidia ) and see no speed loss during edit or rendering .	St
1.2.2	We also save bucks on power consumption .	St
1.2.3	Just my answers to your questions .	St
1.2.4	1 .	St
1.2.5	Is changing the output orientation from landscape to portrait a video card software issue or an XP issue , i.e .	St
1.2.6	does XP SP2 support this directly ?	Ques
1.2.7	It 's done with the drivers that come with said software .	St
1.2.8	Microsoft is not keen on driver development .	St
1.2.9	2 .	St
1.2.10	Does this XFX card support running in a dual card configuration ?	Ques
1.2.11	From what I 've read , yes .	St
1.2.12	3 .	St
1.2.13	Should I upgrade to the 640 MB card ?	Ques
1.2.14	For video editing ?	Ques
1.2.15	I 'll write no .	St
1.2.16	Gamers would .	St

1.3.1	I actually got someone knowledgable at XFX that agreed that I could basically get two 7900 GS cards for the price of one of the 8800 GTS cards and accomplish my objective .	St
1.3.2	And there 's another benefit ... apparently the 8800 's are real power hogs , requiring one 500 watt power supply EACH !	St
1.3.3	The other issue I guess is the distinction between Extended Desktop and Desktop Spanning .	St
1.3.4	I was looking for Desktop Spanning , which is not possible with rotated displays I 've been told .	St
1.3.5	Extended Desktop is able to rotate and use all 4 , apparently , & quot ; with a little tweaking & quot ; but not as one continuous desktop .	St
1.4.1	i just tried rotating both my displays using the nvidia control panel and only the first/primary display wound up being rotated -- the second display remained in landscape orientation .	St
1.4.2	this may be due to my dual monitors having different resolutions ( primary is widescreen , secondary is 4:3 ) but you should confirm this functionality & quot ; in-person & quot ; since it would n't be the first time a tech support rep has made an misleading claim .	St
1.4.3	if you 're not going to do any gaming , a geforce 7300 is more than sufficient .	St
1.5.1	Thanks .	Polite
1.5.2	He said it would take some tweaking .	St
1.5.3	Could you have missed a tweak with their software ?	Ques
1.6.1	rotation is on a different tab than the monitor selection window , but regardless of which monitor i selected , only the primary monitor rotated .	St
1.6.2	again this could be due to my setup ( 1 widescreen with DVI , 1 4:3 with VGA ) .	St
1.6.3	still , enough folks have dual displays that you should be able to find someone who can confirm it for you .	St
1.7.1	Speaking with XFX , they said do not use the nvrotate utility .	St
1.7.2	That only rotates the primary monitor .	St
1.7.3	Instead , using the classic nvidia control panel ( not the new one ) , go into nview , click display settings , highlight the monitor you want to rotate , right click , then rotate .	St
1.7.4	They tested that in house and said it worked .	St
