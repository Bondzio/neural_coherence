hi to everyone!
i would appreciate your advice and time; i have 2 single areas of concern: 1. download/upload speed 2 coverage distance/strength i use win xp (sp3), my home is about 200 msq (600 sqft) and the walls are thin, wooden, paperwalled separators, yet an &quot;n&quot; draft buffalo airstation nifty giga cannot manage to allow g std laptop operation throught the house.
i want to watch blueray movies, in full hd, by streaming them wirelessly from my laptop to my ht (through a digital media centre).
here is my doubt: given certain technical specifications as the &quot;n&quot; standard and the dual band (2.4 and 5 ghz) does it matter which model or brand i buy?
i am not interested in options and accessories as preferential bandwith assign, or usb mass storage sharing or safety improvements or lcd screens, etc... only speed and coverage.
any advice for my next &quot;n&quot; std, dual band, router purchase?
thank you for any help.
tommaso
