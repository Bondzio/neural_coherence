But without make, model and how things are connected we are often left with no where to start.
Sorry about that.
&quot;because the hub will not work from router ports.&quot; Armed with that clue I am still missing the make/model of the HUB.
Some have the AUTOMDX feature, some don't.
My ANSWER is that you didn't wire to the uplink port but without the make/model I can't be sure of that answer.
