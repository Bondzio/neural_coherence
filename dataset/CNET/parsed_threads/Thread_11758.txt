<s> I have 3 comps hooked up through a switch. </s>
<s> I can't move files larger than 600 megs between computers or I get cyclic redundency, time out, and unable to find file errors. </s>
<s> The same happens if I try to transfer more than about 2 gigs of files at one time. </s>
<s> Normal moving works fine. </s>
<s> The problem happens if I try to take or move files from another computer . </s>
<s> I get more data through if I take files though. </s>
<s> 2 comps on xp pro and 1 on xp home. </s>
<s> I was wondering what might cause this prob and if I switched to a router it might help. </s>
<s> Also, 1 xp pro is sharing the internet connection. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> for what you want to do, a router is. </s>
<s> Get a router and remove the switch. </s>
<s> A switch is only used behind a router for adding more computers. </s>
<s> Guess you get what you pay for. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
