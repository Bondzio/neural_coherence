My HD has worked well, with some minor OS tweaks on a Toshiba 1905 Satellite for several years using the Firewire port with XP SP2 OS. Now trying to get a new Gateway laptop to recognize (running Vista OS)on Gateway firewire port with no luck. Have read the referenced link but does not appear to apply. Open to suggestions. Thanks!
