i'm thinking of buying hd 6670 but i'm afraid that it will burn my psu and i cant afford a new psu (pocket money problem) so my question is will it be safe to use radeon hd 6670 1 gb ddr5 with my psu  my pc specs are intel pentium e5400 @2.7 ghz motherboard - gigabyte g31m-es2l 4 gb ram windows 7 monitor resolution 1366x768 nvidia 9400 gt (current graphics card ) and the second question is is hd 6670 compatible with my motherboard
