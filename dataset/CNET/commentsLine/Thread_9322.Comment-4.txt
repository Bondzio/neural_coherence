try the other type of dvd media.
if you used dvd-r try dvd+r.
also, burn the media at 1/2 the media speed or 1/2 the drive speed, whichever is lower to get the best results.
i'll share i gifted 2 players because of this issue and replaced it with a philips dvd divx capable player.
that one lists dvdr media so there is no question about support.
