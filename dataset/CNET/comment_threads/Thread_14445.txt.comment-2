If it's form one computer with XP on it, to another XP compatible computer, this should do the trick.
But only after you've purchased the cable.
A cable purchased form your local computer store is required.
Also note that additional resources are also provided at the bottom of the page.
You may wish to provide more information.
OSs involved and computer brands so someone can assist you further.
Good Luck.
