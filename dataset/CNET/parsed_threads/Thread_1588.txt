<s> My cable-company-supplied cable modem is kind of old and worn out. </s>
<s> My wireless network is on the slow side and prone to breakdowns. </s>
<s> Is it possible that the cable modem is at fault and do you think it is worthwhile replacing the modem? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> Yes Modem can deteriorate... and newer modem certainly have something better in it. </s>
<s> But then again... maybe your modem is not the problem... bring it to the ISP (or someone who can) and ask them to check your modem condition... </s>
<s> Need more info on your wireless setup and equipment brand. </s>
