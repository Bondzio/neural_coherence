While there would be some improvement, it's not going to rock your world sorta thing.
You'll be better off using a desktop and having an int.
HD that accessing a 10,000RPM HD.
That would be better but again, that's a hard major investment.
Under your circumstances, you might be better served having a NAS setup, not only for work but immediate storage and minor back-up.
You may want to look into SSD setups as well, speed here is greater overall but that's only an idea I'll throw out there.
Back-up should be an important consideration on top of any initial movie storage.
