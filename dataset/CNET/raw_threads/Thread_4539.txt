2789	1	175681	1930789	1930584	Willy	5/11/06 7:37 AM	1.14733302E12	ideas	power water mix prepared water cooled setup must considser happen cooling leaked next water coolers video cpu look theyre available expensive once water cooling besides actual pads everything else outside handle items become larger std case handle cooling effect best served outside case returned cooling liquid tipshints googled looking modding websites cover topic related topics idea why use dorm type frig place tubing thru added cold cooling hope helps tada willy
2789	2	175681	1930865	1930789	twistedintellect	5/11/06 8:17 AM	1.14733542E12	trying ultimate gaming machine	ok trying create ultimate gaming machine myself got good idea going contemplating how cool quite flexability over clocking etc kinda thinking stuff loads water cooling tubes being fed realy cold water use custom components radiator emits cool air taps controll flow water different components realy big slow rotating fan keep air moving inside comp completely enclose stop cats hair getting inside loads keeps gathering metal grid intake good softwarehardware measures heat levels comp

2789	5	175681	1931058	1930865	linkit	5/11/06 9:47 AM	1.14734082E12	reading material	zalman reserator plus subwebaddr many modern components cpu hd motherboard video card etc temperature sensors builtin come temperature fan utility software
2789	6	175681	1931070	1931009	linkit	5/11/06 9:52 AM	1.14734112E12	refrigerated coolants careful	should read zalman link post unless controlled research laboratory use refrigerated coolants below atmospheric condensation temperature cause condensatin inside computer bad radiative liquid cooling without fans sufficient
2789	7	175681	1931103	1931058	twistedintellect	5/11/06 10:25 AM	1.1473431E12	thanks	thanks thing rooms always ends getting rather warm matter tower thingy water cooling air entering case
2789	8	175681	1931334	1931103	linkit	5/11/06 12:03 PM	1.14734898E12	heat transfer	heat go somewhere room radiator tower same room theoretically should take longer heat room computer heat liquid liquid heat cooling fins radiator finally cooling fins heat surrounding air remember water coolants take longer heat lose heat many liquids including air water cooling air entering case possibly air conditioning unit windowor type air conditioning unit room
