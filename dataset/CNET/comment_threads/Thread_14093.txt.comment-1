What is the main difference in performance between ATA HDDs and SATA HDDs?
Do you notice the difference?
I know there is some difference in speed, but I wonder if the common user has any need for the SATA drives.
The difference in price isn't a lot, but if the difference in speed isn't to be noticed, I don't find a reason to get a SATA drive as of now.
Tnak you all in advance.
