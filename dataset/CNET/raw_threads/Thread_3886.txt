13009	0	236036	2416203	NR	abrash43	2/28/07 3:12 AM	1.17263232E12	New hardware for Games	Hello, I would like to ask what shall I choose for the moment between a new Core2Duo e6300 and a Leadtek 8800Gts to gain more performance for the newer games. Right now my PC specs are: Asus P5ND2 SLI Intel Edition, Leadtek nVidia 7900GS, Creative Audigy 4, P4 630 3Ghz, WD 120GB SATA, 2GB DDR2 800Mhz Corsair, Seasonic S12 430W. 5 Months from now I will have both hardware pieces but right now I have to stick with the one that my PC really needs so I could play the newer games (GRAW2 , MOHA Airborne, STALKER) at HIGH details and 1280x1024 resolution (not with 2AA active). My 7900GS is overclocked at 550mhz(GPU) & 1600mhz(mem). If the answer is the CPU is needed the most right now, I would like to know if a e6300 or a e4300 is better. Thank you.

I just want to know if it's better to buy the graphic card first or to upgrade the CPU (and the mobo) to gain better performance for the games that will come out 5 months from now, because after 5 months I will have both of them. I'm afraid that if I'll buy the graphic card it will be slowed down by my current CPU, or if I'll buy the CPU, i wont' get enough performance compared to buying a 8800gts. I really don't know and this is just for the next 5 months as I said. And I would also like to know if a Leadtek 8800gts (640mb) will be enough for Crysis (on high details and 1280x1024), and of course with an Core2Duo e4300 (OC at 2,6Ghz) and 2Gb DDR2 at 800Mhz.

I can crank all the settings ALL the way up on Oblivion, Company of Heroes and Supreme Commander, and I dont have a problem with any. However, I DO have the e6600 2.4Ghz. Here's what I did. Asus P5N SLI mobo may not be the best one out there, but it supports up to 16GB of RAM, intel's 775 socket processors (including quad core) and of course, its SLI capable. And its fanless, so its quiet. Plus, its only about $105, which is cheap for a mobo. Granted, between all three of those, it cost me about $784, but heres how I see it. the e6600 will be good for a while, and the gfx card will laugh at games for a while to come. In the Future, when I need to turn the settings down to increase my frame rates, I can always get another 8800 (which will have dropped in price by then) as well as upgrade to a quad core.
