hi i have a client who requres tablets for a number of users.
am having problems sourcing the best tablet: requirements: o/s windows or android as a vital app they/program they use is only available on windows or android 3g capability (either through direct sim or dongle) as they work rurally and will not always have a wifi connection be able to print.
we have had trouble finding a printer in nz that is cheap enough to purchase and is easily connected to by the tablets.
seems to be a hard ask finding samsung tablets in nz at a reasonable price.
any ideas would be really helpful.
