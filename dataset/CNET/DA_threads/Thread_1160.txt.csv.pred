1.1.1	I built our computer about five years ago so we are well past the time when it needs to be replaced .	St
1.1.2	I 've been upgrading RAM and storage as we go , but we 've reached the end of the road with this one .	St
1.1.3	I 'm considering two different computers for purchase : one is a refurbished from buy.com , and one is a newer tower from Best Buy .	St
1.1.4	Regardless of which one I get I plan on installing a second hard drive ( to separate the operating system from the data ) which I 'm guessing would void any warranty that comes with the machine .	St
1.1.5	So bear that in mind .	St
1.1.6	( related thread : http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-4_102-0.html ? threadID=388908 % 20 ) I do n't do any gaming or video editing so we are looking at photos , music , streaming video , etc .	St
1.1.7	Gateway DX4822-01 ( refurb ) $ 399	St
1.2.1	There are too many reasons even more so when we talk about video work .	St
1.2.2	Ok , the warranty is split into a few areas .	St
1.2.3	Yes you 'll not get any warranty support for the OS .	St
1.2.4	It was not that good anyway as most questions end with & quot ; restore the factory OS. & quot ; But the hardware is still under warranty with something you must know going in .	St
1.2.5	They wo n't support you with a hardware issue unless you restore the factory load .	St
1.2.6	Some get upset about that but 'dems the rules ' .	St
1.2.7	While the x4500 might be slammed by some , outside of games I find it a great solution .	St
1.2.8	My laptop with a 4500MHD connects to the HDTV with HDMI and plays HD content just fine .	St
1.2.9	And with your i3 you 'll scream past my laptop 's older C2D 2.0GHz CPU .	St
1.2.10	Bob	St
1.3.1	You mean return it to the state it was in when I purchased it ?	Ques
1.3.2	Is n't it still void as I cracked the case can could have done anything when in there without them knowing ?	Ques
1.4.1	I rarely see any company rule so harshly .	St
1.4.2	Given the nature of desktops and the need to clean them yearly how would we avoid opening the case .	St
1.4.3	Of course they would cover a non-stock setup .	St
1.4.4	But if you do this right you can return it to stock when needed .	St
1.4.5	Hard disks are so cheap that I could remove the supplied drive , slip in a new drive just for my use .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	They used to have those seals over the case side .	St
1.5.2	So ridiculous .	St
1.5.3	So it 's really worth the extra $ 160 ?	Ques
1.6.1	I meant no one covers the non-stock machine .	St
1.7.1	The old pentium core unit is strictly a value item and nothing more .	St
1.7.2	How much do you value your time ?	Ques
1.8.1	I guess I 'm just shocked that there 's $ 160 worth of value in the processor considering I 'm going to void the warranty the minute I get home .	St
1.8.2	I was n't expecting that .	St
1.8.3	Does anyone else agree ?	Ques
1.9.1	Looking at benchmarks your one hour video render on the i3 should take longer than 1.5 hours ( my bet is 2+ hours ) on the dated dual core .	St
1.9.2	Yes , it 's worth it .	St
1.9.3	Bob	St
1.10.1	... but I do n't render video .	St
1.10.2	I might rip some DVD 's so I have backups for my kids , but rendering video is not something I know how to do or am looking to learn .	St
1.11.1	ALL and I mean ALL dvd rippers I 've seen render some of the DVD to get an idea of what to do with the DVD .	St
1.11.2	If you want to make a less than great upgrade to a value only box then do that .	St
1.11.3	At least someone warned you .	St
1.11.4	Bob	St
1.12.1	Thanks .	Polite
1.12.2	I was n't making the connection there .	St
