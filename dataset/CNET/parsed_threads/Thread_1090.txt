<s> On this black friday, I purchased Dell XPS desktop with huge discount. </s>
<s> Almost half price of right this moment's price. </s>
<s> However recently while I am researching about dell computer, I found out that quality of dell computer parts are really low and they are using cheap parts. </s>
<s> Return policy period is not past and I kept every boxes and every parts of set. </s>
<s> Thus I am able to return the product. </s>
<s> Do you guys think that I should return the computer? </s>
<s> you may as well return it if you can. </s>
<s> Then, you can pay twice the price for something else and, the next day, wonder, again, if you made the right decision. </s>
<s> Is it real that Dell computer is using cheap and low quality parts ? </s>
<s> based on what i have seen on the web, I know that among pre-built computer. </s>
<s> It has at least a year warranty so would your quality desktop per year be more or less? </s>
<s> Dell parts are no better or worse than any other OEM maker......I suppose not to include Apple. </s>
<s> If you go around the web you will find a 1000 post bitching about Dell. </s>
<s> Why is that?......................Dell sells a gazillion machines. </s>
<s> I'm looking at a couple of year old Dell desktop.......works fine. </s>
<s> I'm with you, Dell is as good as any ready made boxes on the market. </s>
<s> The only way to get a zoot kick butt whiz bang set up is to BUILD IT YOURSELF, which many of us do or spend a bunch of loot and get an ALIENWARE UNIT...or the alternative go to MAC. </s>
<s> This is entirely up to you if you feel you got a raw deal. </s>
<s> IMHO, Dell uses the same parts except for the mtrbd. </s>
<s> that everyone else uses. </s>
<s> Sure, they buy in bulk, but so does everyone else. </s>
<s> Unless, your Dell falls apart, then it's just as good as any other OEM based PC out there. </s>
<s> If you want, check 3rd party builders and check prices. </s>
<s> Also, remember you get the s/w bundle and OWS which in many cases a huge hunk of the purchase, so beware of other vendors that offer a PC, yet you pay extra at least for the OS or its a billable item. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I got the fact that Dell's parts are same with any other OEM computers, but how about compare with &quot;Building my own computer.&quot; If prices are equal, for sure, quality of built computer will be better compare to manufactured computer, but how much different? </s>
<s> Because I also considering about building my own computer with money i receive from dell if i return the desktop. </s>
<s> What you guys think? </s>
<s> I've lost count of posts where folk build their own only to discover installing Windows is just as bad as it was 20 years ago. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Go here. </s>

<s> Don't forget the OS. </s>
<s> Your call. </s>
