thanks for the reply.
i did not prepare it as you mentioned.
how do i partition and format the blank drive?
when i plug it in, the pc makes the sound that it recognizes something was plugged in, but no drive appears in the computer folder.
thanks again any help is appreciated.
fyi i have a dell that uses windows vista.
