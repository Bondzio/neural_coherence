1.1.1	i have a mesh pc , athlon 64 3500 + 256mb nvidia 7800 gtx 2 x 512mb DDR RAM PC3200 ( 200MHZ ) im looking to get some more ram , preferably 1gb ocz or crucial , something fast ... i just need help to know if it will work .	St
1.1.2	I see ram that says pc3200 400MHZ , will that work ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.3	im mainly looking for something to improve my gaming , my motherboard is quite old.. its a gigabyte ga-k8 pci express .	St
1.1.4	if anyone can give me advice on any other essentials to upgrade like processors thats appreciated .	Ques
1.2.1	Look at your MB manual , the MB manula on the mfgs website ; or check the RAM mfgs websites such as Crucial.com ; Corsair.com ; Kingston.com ; etc. , From the websites above , select the MB mfg , the MB model # and the RAM selector will show you what RAM they offer for your MB .	St
1.2.2	You can buy direct or go to resellers like Newegg.com , ZipZoomFly.com , etc. , to buy .	St
1.2.3	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	pc3200 runs at 2x200mhz and is commonly called ddr-400 .	St
1.3.2	so the ram you 're looking at will run just fine except if you fill all 4 slots .	St
1.3.3	in that case , it may slow down to ddr-333 speed but will still run fine .	St
1.4.1	i 've sort if read up and i think i know what to get , there is only 1 more thing i need to know , if i get dual-channel memory , what happens to my old 2 x 512mb memory ? ?	Ques
1.4.2	do i just have to sell it on or something ?	Ques
1.4.3	?	Ques
1.5.1	PS ... .no such thing as 'dual channel memory ' .	St
1.5.2	But there is memory that operates in the motherboard 's dual memory architecture and for best results it takes matched pairs .	St
1.5.3	To avoid the RAM from going from 400MHz to 333Mhz ... get 2 DIMMs @ 1GB each and place them in the first dual channel dimm slots .	St
1.5.4	Test the new DIMMs thoroughly with Memtest86+ .	St
1.5.5	If they test OK ... .then add the 2 @ 512MBs and see how it runs ... be prepared to obeserve the impact and tradeoff of the RAM speed reduction and the extra 1GB RAM .	St
1.5.6	Then make your decision what to do the 2-512s .	St
1.5.7	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	im a bit confused now , i read that you put the dual ones in at the first slot and 3rd slot .	St
1.7.1	take advantage of dual channel architecture .	St
1.7.2	I meant place the new DIMMs in first channel vs 2nd channel .	St
1.7.3	VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	There are many Gigabyte & quot ; GA-K8 & quot ; motherboards : http : //www.gigabyte.com.tw/Products/Motherboard/Products_List.aspx ? VenderType=AMD & CPUType=socket+939 Which one do you have ?	Ques
1.9.1	i have the gigabyte GA-K8N51GMF -9 , according to cpuz .	St
1.9.2	i have found out that my 2 x 512mb actually runs in dual channel currently , now im not sure if adding a 1gb stick will effect that .	St
1.10.1	VAPCMD gave you an excellent plan of action to learn how to add more RAM to your motherboard .	St
1.10.2	According to the manual , having three modules installed & quot ; will cause system unable to boot. & quot ; I 'd stick with what you already have or replace your existing modules with two identical 1GB modules .	St
1.11.1	You want to believe these folks .	St
1.11.2	http : //www.crucial.com/ And IF that mobo # is correct .	St
1.11.3	You MUST install ram in pairs .	St
1.11.4	Your mobo does NOT support dual channel .	St
1.12.1	Crucial.com says the motherboard does not support dual channel mode .	St
1.12.2	VS .	St
1.12.3	The motherboard specifications say it does indeed support dual channel mode .	St
1.12.4	The manual goes into detail with a table showing which configurations of filled memory slots will enable dual channel mode .	St
1.12.5	http : //www.gigabyte.com.tw/Products/Motherboard/Products_Spec.aspx ? ClassValue=Motherboard & ProductID=1939 & ProductName=GA-K8N51GMF-9 Whom should we trust ? ? ? ! !	Ques
1.12.6	I usually go with the motherboard specifications over Crucial.com .	St
1.12.7	I 'd also make sure that the motherboard BIOS is up to date .	St
1.12.8	Since Crucial.com takes pride in the accuracy of its information , I guess one could contact them to help clear the fog .	St
1.13.1	http : //www.gigabyte.com.tw/Support/Motherboard/Manual_Model.aspx ? ClassValue=Motherboard & ProductID=1950 & ProductName=GA-K8N51GMF and I ca n't find where it noted dual channel memory operation .	St
1.13.2	Bob	St
1.14.1	I might be looking at the wrong one , but I was looking at the & quot ; dash-9 & quot ; model ( GA-K8N51GMF-9 ) .	St

1.15.1	You need PAIRS .	St
1.15.2	I see we already covered the & quot ; there is no such thing as dual channel memory & quot ; .	St

1.16.17	Max capacity : Up to 4GB by 4 DIMM slots	St
1.17.1	many motherboard will activate dual channel if each bank has the same amount of ram .	St
1.17.2	so you could put your 2 existing 512mb sticks in one bank , and a new 1gb stick in the second bank .	Sug
1.17.3	( see your mobo/pc manual to identify which bank a slot is part of . )	St
1.17.4	if 2gb is your goal , that 's probably the best way to go since all 3 sticks will be running at full ddr-400 speed .	St
1.18.1	thanks , btw..if my memory doesnt run in dual channel why does it say & quot ; memory runs at dual-channel & quot ; when i boot ? ?	Ques
1.18.2	i no this is a bit of-topic but , if i upgraded to an am2 motherboard and got a x2 am2 processor , will i need to get ddr2 memory or can i still use ddr on a ddr2 motherboard ? ? ?	Ques
1.18.3	thanks in advance	Polite
1.19.1	RE : you question ... thanks , btw..if my memory doesnt run in dual channel why does it say & quot ; memory runs at dual-channel & quot ; when i boot ? ?	Ques
1.19.2	Not sure I follow the question ... sounds like you ARE taking advantage of the dual channel architecture with your 2-512MBs DIMMs in DIMM slots 1 and 3 .	St
1.19.3	It simply takes 2 DIMMs ... usually matching ( same capacity , same speed ) to complete the circuitry design .	St
1.19.4	i no this is a bit of-topic but , if i upgraded to an am2 motherboard and got a x2 am2 processor , will i need to get ddr2 memory or can i still use ddr on a ddr2 motherboard ? ? ?	Ques
1.19.5	thanks in advance Do n't know of any AM2 MBs that use DDR..the design is for DDR2 and if you found such a MB , you 'd suboptimize system performance .	St
1.19.6	The only good new is DDR2 has dropped in prices rather dramatically since Christmas .	St
