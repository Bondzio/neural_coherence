i reside in a university residence and i own both a laptop and a desktop.
there is a single network point in my room.
i keep my desktop connected to this as this is where i get internet access.
i want to sync both my laptop and desktop and this usually involves me unplugging the lan cable and plugging it into my laptop.
i'm looking for an easier solution.
can i buy a usb wifi stick for my desktop and connect simultaneously to my laptop wirelessly and the university network via cable?
note both pcs have windows 7 x64.
