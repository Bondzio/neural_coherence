i have a printer (hp laserjet 1000) connected to a terminal.
every morning when i switch on the printer, it will say that the printer is not connected properly when it's actually connected.
then after restarting, uninstalling, and adding the printer again, until the terminal detect my printer (from usb port), everything will work fine until the next morning.
i tried connecting using other usb port (back and front) and it doesn't work.
does anyone know the reason of it?
thank you in advance.
