1.1.1	i have a compaq V5101us laptop and im often sitting right next to a power outlet while working on it .	St
1.1.2	my thoughts were to always just plug it in while im on it but i that that is bad for some batteries on some other types of devices other than computers and i was wandering if it is also bad for the computer .	St

1.2.3	Read and decide .	St
1.2.4	We leave the battery in and they last years .	St
