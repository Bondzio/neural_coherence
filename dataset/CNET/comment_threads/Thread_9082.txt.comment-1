My Pavilion a1324m computer with an ECS 410-M motherboard has 1G of memory.
I installed another 1G chip in the second channel, DDR2 PC2-4200 533 mhzs as per the manufacturers specifications.
At boot-up the computer does not recognize the second chip and I am still stuck with 1G of memory.
Have I missed something or is there a solution.
I purchased 2 different manufacturers chips, Kingston and PNY and neither work.
This is a Pentium 4 3.06 Ghzs.
