<s> Anyone have any suggestions for third party web sites offering tech support on Adobe (fka Macromedia) Flash Player? </s>
<s> Adobe/Macromedia support is non-existant and Flash Player no longer works on my PC. </s>
<s> All I have are blacked out boxes where flash content should be playing and Internet Explorer's manage add-ons indicates the Flash Player active-x control is enabled. </s>
<s> I have recently gotten rid of Norton Systemworks and a combo Pop-up/Ad Blocker software and have searched and removed possible kill-bit entries in the registry, all to no avail. </s>
<s> Any suggestions appreciated. </s>
<s> But the posting member should supply all details (what OS?) </s>
<s> and post in the forum for their OS. </s>
<s> All the other places such as geeksquad will cost some money, but if that's what you want. </s>
