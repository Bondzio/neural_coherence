<s> I plug a USB cord into my computer (iMac G5 running OS 10.5.8) and into my tablet (Craig CMP741e). </s>
<s> It says that the device is drawing too much power and the computer shuts down the USB port. </s>
<s> The cable works fine on other devices. </s>
<s> I don''t know how else to transfer media to my tablet. </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Maybe this one is defective? </s>
<s> I did not. </s>
<s> It does have an adapter that I can plug my flash drive into. </s>
<s> Temp fix; also my phone can take my 8GB card and I can transfer to the card from there. </s>
<s> Something could be defective and there is no reason for you to get stuck with a bad unit. </s>
