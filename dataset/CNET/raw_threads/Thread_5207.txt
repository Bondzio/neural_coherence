10553	0	64550	766385	NR	hh	2/15/05 1:54 PM	1.10847564E12	Printing trouble	OK, so I have this new state of the art computer, and somewhat older HP 40 (all in one) printer. When I first connected the printer to the computer everything was OK. After several days, I cannot print anything from a web site. If I pay a bill and I want to print the confirmation, I get an error message. If I copy the confirmation and paste it to Word, I still cannot print it until I do a reboot. This happens everytime. Is it something to do with pop up blockers? I am lost and don't know what to do. I have the same pop up blocker I had with my older computer and ha never had this issue. This is a XP Professional OS, while my ols one was Windows 98. Thanks for any help.

I uninstalled and re-installed the printer and on the first go it seems to have worked. However, in the past also whenever I did something like this it worked the first time and then it was not able to print any longer.
