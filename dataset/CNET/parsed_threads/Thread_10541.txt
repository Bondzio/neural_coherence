<s> Hey all - Simple question: Looking for a network storage device that can act as a central data area for multiple (heavy home use) computers. </s>
<s> I.e store all the digital pictures, etc. </s>
<s> Plus be able to backup the area easily. </s>
<s> I see everything from $100 to $1000, but I just want to make sure it's easy and dependable. </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> None of them offer an integrated data protection system. </s>
<s> That is a system that prevents data loss from virus or simply pressing the delete key. </s>
<s> Also, most are hard disk based which causes them to have some number of years till the drives fail. </s>

<s> -&gt; Yes I use a NAS, but I also have a backup system to add reliability. </s>
