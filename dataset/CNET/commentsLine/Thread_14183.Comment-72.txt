in the seventies i bought a commodore vic 20 for myself and kids.
it ran on basic and we all learned the language.
i bought a $30.
printer for it which had to be reset for each line but it was fun and rather exciting to actually use it to write notes.
the computer cost around $130.
which i borrowed from a loan company i was so determined to get a computer.
having always been interested in science i told my children that computers were going to be the machine of the future and they should learn everything they could about them.
i bought several games for it.
one was a mystery in which you had to find the pirate's gold.
directions were in text--no graphics.
it started out with a description of 3 objects on a table from which you had to choose, a rope, a pen or a pair of old sneakers.
the sneakers was the correct choice.
they were needed because later as you progressed you were forced to climb out a window and walk on a slippery ledge and without the sneakers you'd fall to your death.
except for my husband, who wasn't interested in computers, our older kids and i took turns playing it.
the youngest of my children who was old enough to use it was my 10 yr old daughter and she was the first to find the treasure--much to her 3 brothers' chagrin.
a year or two later i bought a word processer and after than a 1985 ibm computer that ran dos, had word perfect and the real &quot;floppies.&quot; i bought a dandy little printer at a local thrift store for only ten bucks because the management didn't know a thing about it.
it printed on paper rolls with holes on the sides to advance the pages.
i used that until the mid nineties when i bought a gateway that ran windows 95 and came with a mouse!
i didn't think i could ever get used to a mouse after using dos for so many years, but i finally managed.
in 2002 i bought the computer i now use--another gateway.
it runs xp and has an 80 gig hd which i thought huge back then but now that's so obsolete!
ah, well....
