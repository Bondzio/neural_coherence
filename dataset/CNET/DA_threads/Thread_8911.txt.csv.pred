1.1.1	Hi - i have tried to set this router up on my Grandad 's laptop .	St
1.1.2	I did not get an installation CD with the router so i set it all up on line .	St
1.1.3	All that seemed to work fine and when i go to the & quot ; see available wireless network connections in range & quot ; , on my laptop it does show up , however i can not connect to it wirelessly .	St
1.1.4	What am i doing wrong ... ..it has driven me potty - my grandparents have now gone away for a short break but i would love to have the solution ready to fix this when they return .	St
1.1.5	They currently connect to the internet via virgin NTL - from what i can see i plugged all the cables in correctly to get it up and going however as soon as i unplug the blue lead belonging to the netgear wireless router from my computer the internet connection goes and i still can not connect wirelessly ! !	St
1.1.6	Any help would be hugely appreciated L	Polite
1.2.1	http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html ? forumID=62 & threadID=264135 & messageID=2584349 notes that the CD is not required .	St
1.2.2	The reason you ca n't connect is that DSL can use PPPoE software to login .	St
1.2.3	When you change to your router you do n't need that since you 'll set the router to handle the login .	St
1.2.4	There was some clamor to ship the routers with the radio set to off .	St
1.2.5	Did you turn it on and set it up like we note at http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html ? forumID=62 & threadID=264135 & messageID=2584349 Bob	St
