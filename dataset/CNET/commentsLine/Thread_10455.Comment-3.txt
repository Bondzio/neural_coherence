please tell more, such as the full message that lets you think this.
in normal cases, the ip-address isn't found, but assigned by the router, so the laptop doesn't search for it, but gets it in a message.
a possible cause: password doesn't match.
resetting the router (turn off, wait a minute, turn on) might help also.
that's the first thing to try.
