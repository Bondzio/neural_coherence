i worded that poorly.
i replaced the hdd in an hp pavilion 304w and created a system and recovery partition on the new hdd.
i then cloned the old partitions from the old hdd to the new.
there was about 1.2gb of unused space left on the recovery partition of the old hdd.
so i couldn't understand why the company left such a large amount of unused wasted space.
on the new hdd i left only 512mb of unused space on the recovery partition after cloning of the recovery system.
as far as i know the recovery partition isn't wrote to during the recovery process.
it only copies the recovery back to the system partition.
so i wasn't completely sure that the recovery partition isn't written back to during the recovery process.
if it is then maybe i need to make that unused space a little bigger.
