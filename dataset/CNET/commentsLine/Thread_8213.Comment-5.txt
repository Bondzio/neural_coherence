alot goes on in a video cable, simple as it is.
the resistance or drop of signal lost on the distance can be lousy.
cheaper cables offer too little when compared to pricier cables but cost saving.
it would be great if it works but there are times for whatever reason the display is plain no good.
the more info to cover a larger screen makes for a demanding link, so it pays to have better.
the simple video output of typical laptops won't always provide the best output but a capable one.
the more resolution deemed necessary the more likely of a display could be faltered by lacking componets.
one reason to review the specs of monitor, video source and cable and/or link as they should be within specs of each other on a &quot;native level&quot;.
meaning, they compliment each other quite well w/o too fancy of setting.
