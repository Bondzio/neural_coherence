1.
SP1 is needed to support over 137GB drives.
2.
If you have such a drive and reinstall XP and XP doesn't have SP1 built-in, then the over 137GB drive contents VANISH.
Fix for item number 2 is to get or make an XP CD with SP1 integrated.
If this is a DELL, then ask for an updated OS CD so you don't lose it all.
