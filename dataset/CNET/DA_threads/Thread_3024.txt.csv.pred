1.1.1	I want to set up my home network to run a DLNA server for videos , music , etc .	St
1.1.2	I know that there are many new routers and NAS devices out there that now have the capability to run a DLNA server built-in .	St
1.1.3	My question is , which would provide a better DLNA server : one that is built into the router or one that is built into the NAS device ?	Ques
1.2.1	For now , I 've yet to find folk HAPPY with DLNA .	St
1.2.2	Well there is one that frequents the forums but I suspect they are here to disagree at times .	St
1.2.3	To answer your question you would have to test both and see if they deliver what you expected .	St
1.2.4	For example , many expected fast forward and rewind to work but ( surprise ?	Ques
1.2.5	) , that 's not in the basic DLNA specs .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	If you 're looking for a server to store your media , then you need a DLNA certified NAS .	St
1.3.2	A router can be DLNA certified , but has no storage capabilities and ca n't act as a server .	St
1.4.1	A router can very easily become a dlna server if it has a usb port for external drives .	St
1.4.2	USB3 works well with 802.11n wifi - you wont get much better unless you use a wired gigabit setup ... but do you really want the clutter ?	Ques
1.4.3	I use the netgear N600 ADSL2+ router/modem , with my bravia and boxee ( on older tv ) - I have no complaints .	St
1.4.4	Why dont I use a NAS - getting a decent NAS is too costly to be feasible .	St
