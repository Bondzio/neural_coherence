I tried to connect my LaCie 1TB harddrive to it, but it wouldn't recognise it. The harddrive is in NTFS file system. My friend has a WD harddrive connected to a WD multimedia player, and it works perfectly. His harddrive has an NTFS file system as well, so this is why I get confused. Is it because his mm player and hd have the same manufacturer? I know that you're going to tell me to format it to FAT32, but I know that the max file size there is 4GB, and this is not a solution for me, because I bought it to watch hi-def films with it.

And to experiment: - Does your friends player recognise your drive? - Does your LG recognize your friends drive? Kees

I think I threw the manunal out. I thought about experimenting and testing that out once I get back, I'm currently not home. I'll have to wait till sunday evening. I'll post the results then! And thanks again!
