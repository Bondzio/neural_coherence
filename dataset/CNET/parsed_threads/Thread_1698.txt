<s> I have been looking at netbooks and reading reviews for some time. </s>
<s> The service reports regarding Dell are so negative, I am looking away from Dell though the vostroa90 netbook seemed good. </s>
<s> The asus has gotten very good reviews. </s>
<s> Can someone give feedback and how does asus compare with acer? </s>
<s> Also, asus is offered at BestBuy for only 299, a good price, yet Best Buy also has a bad reputation for service, would it be better to buy a netbook directly from manufacturer? </s>
<s> Thanks, Cathy </s>
<s> I own the Acer 8.9 inch 160GB model and it's fine here. </s>
<s> Now the only issues I'm seeing are people that don't want to get some USB DVDRW drive to make the restore media and those that think support includes software issues. </s>
<s> Beyond that I like all the netbooks I've used. </s>
<s> One last thing. </s>
<s> All the people that got these to replace a laptop are getting very cranky. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I just read a report on repair rates, and the Asus looks really good in that regard. </s>
<s> Re: best buy and service on a netbook It's not like you need much done with it, save on shipping and easy return if yours falls in the small percent that is defective. </s>
<s> Compared to dell.com or similar outlets, I like Best Buy better than zero service from a call-center in India. </s>
