They supply power to the standby power leads for functions like Wake On Lan.
You may be less than enthused that the design takes the AC Line, rectifies it (AC to DC) and at that stage you have over 200 Volts DC.
Any number of component failures or a screw falling inside (I've seen pennies, paper clips, etc...) can cause this voltage to travel to what is connected to the PSU.
Rare, but not unheard of.
