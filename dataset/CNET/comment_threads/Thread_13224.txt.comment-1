About 6 months ago, a thunderstorm was in the area and caused lightning to go through my computer (which was turned off, but unfortunately not unplugged).
When I attempted to turn it on the next day the only thing that came on was a fan somewhere in the computer.
I tested out the hard drive in another computer and it came up fine; the CD-ROM drive works as well.
Is there anyway the problem could be the Power Supply Unit?
Or is that not likely the problem?
