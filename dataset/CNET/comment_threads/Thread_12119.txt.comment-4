I am having exactly the same problem with a used Dell Latitude I just purchased.
I can connect to my network at home but when I try to connect here at work the Laptop sees the network, says I have excellent signal strength but limited or no connectivity.
When I try to repair the connection the laptop is unable to acquire a new IP.
The router is a linxsys WAP54g.
Can anyone help?
