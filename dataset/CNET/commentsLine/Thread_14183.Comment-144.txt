there aren't many of us.
i remember jumpman with a lot of nostalgia.
that was a great game.
i also had the 410 tape drive, and i later bought the 1020 plotter and used it as a tiny printer.
much later i bought several disk drives and a modem and ran a bbs which i kept going till about 5 years ago, but by then it had migrated to a pc running ms-dos.
