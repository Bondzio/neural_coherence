thank you for your advice.
i fell victim to the ssid broadcasting thing, i changed it back and so far it's stayed online.
i have vista so i'm pretty sure that the dell wireless isn't running i checked the task manager and i don't believe it is running.
i'm pretty sure that vista takes complete control over the connection (as with everything else).
i checked the dell website for driver updates and there aren't any.
i did briefly chat with a rep and they said that they are working on an updated driver for my wifi card because they said there were having &quot;issues&quot; with it and audio.
fun times.
well thank you.
if i notice anything at all i will put another post up.
oh and i have read the billions of posts about draft n and pre n. i am contemplating buying another router to take advantage of the &quot;draft n&quot; speeds.
