First the SATA HDD would start only occasionally then sometimes fail either a few minutes or a few hours after startup. My SATA HD contains all my data and software and my IDE HD contains windows and a few other programs. So far no data has been lost from this drive, it just rarely starts (I have moved the most important files on to my IDE for safety). Soon after that my computer became painfully slow to start up. It would take a long time loading windows then the screen would go black for a while before going to the login screen. Any help would be much appareciated System: Windows XP SP2 AMD Athlon 64 3000+ Asus K8V Deluxe mobo 2gb RAM Seagate 200gb SATA HDD IDE 80gb HDD Geforce FX 5950 Ultra 256mb gfx
