<s> Just got back from vacation, and my computer isn't working. </s>
<s> It turns on, fans are running, but never boots up. </s>
<s> My burner light is green, but won't open. </s>
<s> I can not even power it down. </s>
<s> Thinking it is a motherboard issue, but thought I ask around first. </s>
<s> Hi, first of all, was the computer shut off and unplugged while you were away? </s>
<s> The motherboard CMOS battery may be dead, which causes the CMOS settings to be lost when the computer is unplugged. </s>
<s> Check all cables and connections, if the computer was moved recently before being used, some of the cables may have become loose or completely disconnected. </s>
<s> Make sure that you're grounded, carefully check that the RAM is firmly seated in place. </s>
<s> Check the other cards, sound, video etc. </s>
<s> Next attempt to start the computer. </s>
<s> You should see the memory detected, the HDD detected and the CDROM's detected. </s>
<s> If not, go into the BIOS settings and select fail safe settings and try to start the computer. </s>
<s> This time you should see the hardware detected, memory, HDD etc. </s>
<s> You may need to manually detect the HDD if the BIOS does not find it the first time around. </s>
<s> Look in the Bios main menu screen for HDD detection select your HDD, should be Primary Master. </s>
<s> Computer should boot up. </s>
<s> If not, there may be other issues that the experts here at the forum can assist with. </s>
<s> Please write back with the results. </s>
<s> Tried everything, but no success. </s>
<s> When I power on, my fans start turning, but nothing else happens. </s>
<s> I am also unable to turn it on or off with the switch. </s>
<s> I am about to give up and start fresh. </s>
<s> Any other suggestions?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> What is the computer make and model? </s>
<s> Did you leave it on while you were away? </s>
<s> What all do you see on the screen and when? </s>
<s> Shot in the dark: check monitor power cable and data cable. </s>
<s> Turn off the monitor and turn it on again. </s>
<s> I built it myself. </s>
<s> ASUS Motherboard with an Athlon XP 2800. </s>
<s> I don't get any kind of signal to the monitor. </s>
<s> I know the monitor works, because I have hooked it up to another computer. </s>
<s> When I go to power it on, the fans turn, but no signal ever goes to the monitor. </s>
