<s> I was brought a computer, that didn't want to start (it turned out to be too much dust on the VGA card and it wasn't working. </s>
<s> After I run the PC there came up a problem with the HDD &quot;replace the damaged hard drive&quot; etc. </s>
<s> After I replaced it, cleaned the whole pc (it's some old P3) and ran it there was a &quot;hardware error, enter power setup menu for details&quot;. </s>
<s> Here's what I find in the power setup menu: VCORE Voltage 1.72V +3.3V Voltage 3.72V (it is in red) +5V Voltage 4.99V +12V Voltage 12.28V -12V Voltage -11.50V -5V Voltage [Ignore] So I guess that the problem is the one, colored in red. </s>
<s> I don't understand much, but I think the one in the left is what it should be, and the one in the right is what it is ATM. </s>
<s> Can this damage something, or it is too little to worry? </s>
<s> That's the voltage for main memory, so you can see the results once the system gets used. </s>
<s> Voltages vary by at least +/- 10% aren't that much but it shouldn't be constantly at those levels, if so then replace with new power supply. </s>
<s> Being an older system system, the psu probably saw better days, but the expense of new psu and other repairs suggest to start looking for a newer system when funds are available as problems may crop-up sooner than later. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Well, meanwhile came clear, that a new PC will be bought in the next 2 months, so I guess it's not THAT much of a problem. </s>
<s> In the worst case scenario - the new PC will be bought sooner, than later </s>
<s> go into the bios and reset it to defaults. </s>
<s> increasing memory voltage is a common technique to overclock ram to higher levels. </s>
