I wasnt to use it in an old D955 intel MB but I do not know which card it is. I also can not find any ATI software that does an ID. http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/hs057.snc6/168747_1464924437706_1671363695_881189_140772_n.jpg Thanks!

A firm answer lies under that HSF setup, if you could remove the HSF, the large IC chip IDs the product or what it is. Which in turn provides the basic driver s/w. If there is an FCC tag#, visit the FCC website and enter it to locate the model#. If no labels/decals or silkscreened info is provided, its a hit&miss process to have the right driver s/w or install package. In most cases, you can use the ATI driver s/w suite to load and it gets used by various video cards provided they're driven by that same IC chip. Installing the AGP mtrbd. driver from Intel can also help install a video card as at least the basic install is present. You can then use Belarc or PC Wizard 2010 to ID the product once the system is up and running. With what you provided, that's as far as I can go in help. good luck tada -----Willy

The tower it is going in has a dead HD that I'm grinding off the broken screw so I can get it out. Once I get it running I will follow your method above, thanks!!
