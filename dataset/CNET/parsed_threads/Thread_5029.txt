<s> Do any of the US model Galaxy Tabs actually come with the SIM card slot? </s>
<s> I just bought the Verizon Tab with a pay as you go plan for the first few months, with the intent to get it unlocked and use it in Australia (permanently) upon return. </s>
<s> The salesguy at Best Buy said I'd be able to do this, but in researching this, it appears that this model doesn't even have a SIM card slot. </s>
<s> Any advice as to which Tablet I should get until I go back (4 months)? </s>
<s> I didn't think I could use a country-specific SIM card for the I-Pad since it is so proprietary and thought the Galaxy would be more flexible. </s>
<s> HELP PLEASE!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Verizon and Sprint models don't have such a slot. </s>
<s> My advice is to not buy android tablets until the next revision of the os for tablets is out. </s>
<s> You're only a few weeks away from CES in Las Vegas when many are betting on news. </s>

<s> Does anyone know if an existing Galaxy Tab running Android 2.2 will be able to be upgraded to run the new Android 3.0 Honeycomb OS? </s>
<s> Compare iPad VS Galaxy tab. </s>
<s> Which is best? </s>
