5196	0	375636	3207908	NR	George The Second	12/28/09 3:45 PM	1.2620151E12	Puzzled about puzzles	Using WindowsXP Svc Pak3, Internet Explorer 8 The LA Times Sudoku and Crossword Puzzles suddenly stopped showing on my monitor on Dec 24. Had been coming up with no problem for at least a couple of years. I figured the Times co-ordinator took a Christmas break. The Times advises no personnel change, no format change, and finds no problem. All I get is a red &quot;X&quot;. Am still getting New York Times puzzles OK, E-mails OK, all other Internet functions OK.

I did not realize this forum was EXCLUSIVELY hardware. The hardware is intimately involved with the software that controls it. Hard to say where to draw the line. Nevertheless, thanks for the guidance.

I was unaware it was out 2 years ago. Let me check that. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_8 and other places seem to write the beta one was March 2008 so it can't have been working for years? Bob
