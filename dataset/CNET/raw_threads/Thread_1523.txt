Case: Cooler Master Centurion 5 Miditower Black/Silver without PSU PSU: CFT-560A-12S 560W ATX/DualX EPS-12V 120mm Fan 20/24-pin (AMD&P4 OK) Motherboard: Asus P5K PRO iP35 4DDR2-DIMM 3PCI 4PCIe SATA Raid Audio GB-LAN Socket775 ATX CPU: Intel Core 2 QUAD Q6700 2.66GHz 8MB FSB1066 Boxed (with cpu-cooler!)

How many fans are enough if I want to overclock this and does anyone have a good tutorial/FAQ site about overclocking?

It struck me odd to have a Crossfire capable mainboard but then use Nvidia. For OC action, a good cpu cooler is important. I'm a fan of Zerotherm, particularly the Nirvana NV 120, because they work well and have good craftmanship. Here's a benchtest & review. http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/coolers/display/apack-zerotherm.html I don't know how the Cooler Master case is, leave that to someone else. The Asus board comes with some nice features for OC.
