<s> Just a bit of advice, I've just started overclocking and want to see what the max voltage I can safely send to my CPU as Ive been told that this will help increase my FSB speed, here's my setup - Asus A7V600 (KT600 chipset) Motherboard Athlon XP 2400+ 512MB 2700 Samsung RAM Radeo 9800 Pro 450W Power Supply Initially, the FSB was set to 133/33 in the BIOS, this gave me a CPU speed of 1.99GHz, I've took it step by step to 149/33 (anything above this and the PC won't start), this gives me a speed of 2.23GHz. </s>
<s> However, as stated above, I've been told that if I increase the voltage going to CPU, I can overclock even further. </s>
<s> the current voltage is 1.650V. </s>
<s> What can I safely increase this to so I don't damage the CPU? </s>
<s> With more voltage and heat, you are decreasing the life of the component. </s>
<s> It's a simple issue, but your choice to trade off speed for life. </s>

<s> So if it's got a reasonable heatsink and fan on it, this should help matters. </s>
<s> It's top temprature at the moment is 46 degrees C. That's when I'm in the BIOS, I'm led to believe that this puts a 100% load on the CPU. </s>
<s> Windows is averaging around 40-43 degrees. </s>
<s> Whats the acceptable temprature limit? </s>
