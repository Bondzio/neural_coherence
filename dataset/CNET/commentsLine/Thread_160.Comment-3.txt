thanks for the info bob, i cleaned all the dust and made sure nothing was loose but it still crashed, this time it crashed after about an hour or so, i know theres an issue with carbon, theres articles on the game crashing for people so that could be a game problem until the patch comes out, but age of empire has worked for me perfect in the past , don't know why it keeps on crashing
