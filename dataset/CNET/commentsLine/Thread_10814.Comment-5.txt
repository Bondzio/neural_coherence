i have that graphics &quot;card&quot; in my computer and it sucks (well at least for gaming).
it is intergrated, there is no real card, it is a chip built into the motherboard and it lags really bad in fps' and any other game with decent graphics.
the only plus about that is you have alot of open ports so you can buy any card you want and not worry about taking something else out.
