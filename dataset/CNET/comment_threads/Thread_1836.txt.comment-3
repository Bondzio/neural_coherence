good thing for me.
so all i need to do is set it up as a slave and then i will not have any other files?
One thing though.
On my PC that got messed up i had accounts with password.
Someone could not see someones else accounts(like thier desktop, documents, folders) will i be able to see them after setting it up as a slave?
