<s> I am looking to buy a bluetooth device that can be connected to a desktop computer and used to send out text messages and multimedia to cell phones within a range of 500 meters or more. </s>
<s> I am not familiar with this type of technology, so I'm not sure what type of device I need to purchase or where I could purchase it. </s>
<s> Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Sorry but that 500 meters is beyond most bluetooth devices. </s>
<s> Yes you might jury rig a base station or such but the device you try to talk to can't respond. </s>
<s> Maybe you need to reveal more since the bluetooth speed is far too slow for video files. </s>

<s> stlcardsfan13, Have you found a means to do this? </s>
<s> I am interested in doing the same thing to distribute multiple text messages (for a new media art piece). </s>
<s> I am running a Mac oSX. </s>
<s> I am also hoping that when people respond to this text message on their mobile phones it uploads to an online blog (like Twitter). </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be great! </s>
