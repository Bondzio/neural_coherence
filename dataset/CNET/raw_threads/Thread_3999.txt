I kind of want the tv tuner, but can live without it or think I could always add later. Are these good prices? just about 1k for a AMD 4200+ dual seems like it is. thoughts? thanks

Does that mean the m7248 has a better video card since it is PCI-E versus integrated (plus obviously i know it includes the tuner).

It is always good to have a graphics card and it seems the HP M7248 has an ATI All-In-Wonder card which is a combination of a graphics card and a tv tuner. The HP M7248 has a better duel core processor, a tv tuner, and graphics card which are all $200+ upgrades if you got the HP A1250. The HP M7248 is also at a better value. If you can live without the latest and the greatest, then the A1250 will suit you just fine and can handle all the chores you throw at it.
