<s> I just recently built my own pc. </s>
<s> I bought the DFI 648FX-ALE motherboard, and a Pentium 4 2.6ghz w\800mhz front side bus speed procesor. </s>
<s> The motherboard can support an 800mhz fsb speed, yet when i run PCMark04 it reads my fsb bus speed as 200mhz. </s>
<s> I cannot find anywhere in the bios where to change it, and I do not believe my motherboard has any fsb speed jumpers. </s>
<s> I would hate to think that my pc is running alot slower than it could thank you for your help. </s>
<s> Ohh yeah i have Phoenix Bios. </s>
<s> &quot;PCMark04 it reads my fsb bus speed as 200mhz&quot; I've found that some programs can't report this reliably over the few thousand makes/models of PCs. </s>
<s> You can try CPUID or CPUIDz you can find with http://www.google.com and if it gives a different answer, contact the authors as to why that happens. </s>
<s> But more to the point, the supplier of your machine should answer your inquiry about the jumper settings (if there are any.) </s>

<s> is running at 800 MHz. </s>
<s> You are using DDR memory [double data rate] Two reads/writes per clock cycle, on one memory bus [thus 400 MHz]. </s>
<s> Your mobo has two memory busses for use with Dual Channel memory. </s>
<s> Thus [if you have two sticks of &quot;matched&quot; memory sticks plugged into the proper memory sockets] you would have two memory busses feeding the MCH and then the CPU, each bus double data rate. </s>
<s> Thus you get 4 memory reads/writes[oversimplified] at 200 MHz which = 800 MHz. </s>
<s> I only have one stick of 512 ddr ram, so i need another? </s>
<s> sticks of DDR SDRAM. </s>
<s> &quot;Matched&quot; just means two sticks of the same size and speed. </s>
<s> Your mobo probably has two sets of different color RAM sockets. </s>
<s> [either a total of four or six sockets]. </s>
<s> To use Dual Channel, one stick must be in the first slot of each color. </s>
<s> Keep in mind that your FSB will still be 200 MHz. </s>
<s> [just the way that the mobo mfrs deignate things] The CPU will be running at 800 MHz memory speed. </s>
<s> The memory must be DDR 400 [or faster], also known as PC 3200. </s>
<s> [it is actually 200 MHz memory that gets double clocked thus is called DDR 400, kind of confusing, isn't it] The stick that you have now must be that or better in order for the system to show an FSB of 200 MHz. </s>
<s> This info should be in the manual that came with your mobo. </s>
<s> It is not always too clearly written due to the &quot;Pidgen english&quot; used by the Taiwanise authors. </s>
<s> Hopefully my explanation will help to clarify it a little, </s>
<s> support the 800 MHz FSB processor speed. </s>
<s> The socket WILL accept the 800 MHZ processor but the highest CPU FSB supported is 533 MHz. </s>
<s> It DOES NOT have Dual Channel memory capability. </s>
<s> Thus disregard my other posts. </s>
