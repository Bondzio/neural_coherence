hi, i want to buy a wireless laser mouse.
i ve researched a lot on various mices, but logtiech's g7 gaming mouse and the mx610 laser mouse catch my interest.
onto my question.
i ve seen on the mx610, there are two buttons near the thumb area, for going back and forward while browsing the internet.
i had an hp mouse with similar buttons but they always accounted for accidental clicks.
and i would end up way too back or forward while browsing.
does this happen with the mx610 also?
please let me know, thanks in advance.
