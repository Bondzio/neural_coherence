Back then I didn't have a vid card and now I do. My vid card is a XFX 7600 GT XXX with DVI and S-Video outputs. I hooked up my comp to the big screen through the dvi cable and its not working. I also tried through the s-video but no signal was being produced. What could be the problem? Does my comp need special drivers from it? please help
