no clear feedback on the exact router settings.
no exact feedback if they are using some static settings, and so on.
i've been slow to ask for this since some take it badly if you pressure them to engage in their discussion.
this is not that easy for some to find out the answers to simple questions (for those that setup networks daily) but i try to go with simple things to shut out the more common issues (such as the wifi hijacking issue.)
