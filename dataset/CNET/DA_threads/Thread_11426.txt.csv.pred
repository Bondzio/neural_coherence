1.1.1	Hello.	St
1.1.2	This is my first post here.	St
1.1.3	I currantly have a 'home-built' computer: ASUS A7NXE-Deluxe AMD Athlon 2500+ Radeon 9200 DSL (SBC's modem) I run Ubuntu Linux 6.06 on it and use all of Ubuntu's onboard programs as defaults - OpenOffice, Gnome, Firefox, etc.	St
1.1.4	I am getting a second 'home-built' computer: ASUS A8N-VM AMD Athlon 64 3800 3D Fuzion GeForce 7600GS I will load Ubuntu Linux 64 6.06 on it and this computer will be used by my children for schoolwork, supposedly.	St
1.1.5	Anyway, I'm going to have the 64 bit unit on a wheeled cart for sharing purposes between children.	St
1.1.6	I have never used a LAN or a router, so here is what I need guidance with.... Do I need to establish a LAN for both computers to work off of the router?	St
1.1.7	If so, can I use the 32 bit computer as the 'master' and the 64 bit as the 'slave'?	St
1.1.8	Do I need to purchase anything else other than the router?	St
1.1.9	This info and any other pertinent info would be greatly appreciated.	St
1.1.10	Thanks Gary	St
1.2.1	one thing I do know is when using a router, it's not necessary to configure the computers as server and client setup.	St
1.2.2	I have never network linux computer before; that will be an interesting experience for me later.	St
1.3.1	Network = two or more computers connected together.	St
1.3.2	LAN = Local Area Network = just another name for a smaller network (such as the one you will create in your home).	St
1.3.3	You could connect two computers with one crossover network cable to form a two computer network (no hub, switch, or router needed).	St
1.3.4	Not very versatile, though.	St
1.3.5	Today, the simplest way to create a network is to get a router and connect all computers to it with network cable (not crossover cable).	St
1.3.6	If you get a broadband router, you can plug your Cable/DSL/other into it, so that all connected computers may share the Internet service.	St
1.3.7	Get a wireless broadband router (and compatible wireless network adapters) to add wireless connection capabilities.	St
1.3.8	If the Linux distribution has a proper driver for the network adapter installed in the computer, you shouldn't have problems.	St
1.3.9	Just connect all computers to a router.	St
1.3.10	Diagram: Internet --- DSL modem --- router --- (all computers connect to router)	St
