My daughter's computer started freezing up - it turned out to be the power supply - the fan was a bit sluggish just enough to cause it to over heat enough - so i dusted and replace the fan with one from an old computer and she worked like a charm after that - your graphics card chews up the juice as well - try and run it at lower freq for a while hope this helps peter
