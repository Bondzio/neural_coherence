<s> I'm a big Tron nerd so was really looking at the Tron keyboard by Razer, but it appears to be a terrible keyboard unless you only want to look at it. </s>
<s> Bummer. </s>
<s> I got to thinking though I really do need a new keyboard. </s>
<s> I'm not an expert, but I believe I need a mechanical keyboard. </s>
<s> I see a lot of discussion about &quot;cherry&quot; and &quot;switches&quot;. </s>
<s> I can type pretty fast and am beginning to see how inefficient my old Microsoft keyboard is and how hard I have to press to type. </s>
<s> I'm looking for effortless and responsive typing. </s>
<s> I do a ton of typing and want high end all around great typing. </s>
<s> That being said I want it to look outstanding as well. </s>
<s> Cool lighting is much preferred. </s>
<s> So far the only keyboard I have found online to be mechanical and have neat lighting is the Black Widow Ultimate, but again I am not an expert and can use any and all advice you all have on keyboards. </s>
<s> Please let me know what is out there that would be good for me. </s>
<s> I appreciate the help! </s>

<s> http://www.datamancer.net/keyboards/aviator/aviator.htm has a few models. </s>
<s> Although they are really designed with gaming in mind, I really like the Logitech G series of keyboards. </s>
<s> There is a G15, G11 and some new ones. </s>
<s> I have the G11. </s>
<s> The keyboard has a nice feel to type on, not clicky buttons, but not soft and squidgey either. </s>
<s> They allow you to turn off the lights, have them dimmed or full brightness. </s>
<s> One of the main reasons they are gaming keyboards is because they come with extra programmable shortcut buttons, but I find these useful out of games. </s>
<s> I write a lesson plan every week for school, and it is in essentially the same style each time. </s>
<s> So, I simply have the shortcut buttons set up linked to macros. </s>
<s> I have the first 6 buttons linked to sentences that I use often in the document. </s>
<s> For example, I use &quot;The children develop&quot; all the time, so that is key G6. </s>
<s> I hit that in Word, it types it right out for me. </s>
<s> I have 2 other buttons set up to auto format. </s>
<s> So I highlight some text, hit G10 and it formats the size, font and bold settings to my standard. </s>
<s> These button also have three memory settings, so you could set up on group of shortcuts for Word, another for Excel, and a third for Outlook or something, and simply switch between them at the touch of a button. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
