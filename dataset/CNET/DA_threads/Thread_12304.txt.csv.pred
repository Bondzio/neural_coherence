1.1.1	I have a USB Enclosure that I put a hardrive from an old machine running windows 2000.	St
1.1.2	The new machine is XP and when I connect the drive and it only detects the first of the two partitions.	St
1.1.3	Is there something I need to do for XP to detect the second partition?	St
1.1.4	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	You are lucky to see even the first partition.	St
1.2.2	Here's why.	St
1.2.3	Drives don't always move to such and retain their contents.	St
1.2.4	Issues abound.	St
1.2.5	1.	St
1.2.6	There are other than Windows 2000 partitioning tools that could have been used and such will cause issues when you move the drive.	St
1.2.7	2.	St
1.2.8	There is an issue with XP and Windows 2000 partitions noted in some Microsoft Article.	St
1.2.9	Microsoft nonchalantly asks that you backup, recreate the partition and restore the data.	St
1.2.10	3.	St
1.2.11	You may have XP and not XP SP1.	St
1.2.12	Or even XP SP2.	St
1.2.13	I have an external USB 160GB drive and with plain XP, only 137GB is usuable.	St
1.2.14	XP SP1 gets the full 160GB support, but CHKDSK fails.	St
1.2.15	Finally at XP SP2, the full size is supported and CHKDSK works.	St
1.2.16	Best of luck, Bob	St
