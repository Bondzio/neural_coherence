the e520 only has a 305w power supply which is too small for an 8600gts.
that's why it doesn't have a pci-e plug.
most new 400+ watt power supplies will be fine for you and will have the pci-e plug.
i'm wary of thermaltake power supplies, but folks seem to like this 430w for $40 .
raidmax units are an ok budget alternatives with this 530w unit for $60 before $20 rebate .
don't expect a full 530w out of it (it's really more like a 400w unit), but it will handle your 8600gts.
antec's a good safe choice with this 500w for $79 .
if you prefer corsair, here's a 450w for $89 .
