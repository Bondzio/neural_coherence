This may or may not work.
Much depends on the partition type of the XP drive.
If your laptop has XP, this is not an issue.
The external enclosure will have its own controller.
It may or may not be able to access the information on the drive.
The ones I have work, however.
If you have access to another XP machine that you can temporarily connect the drive to and transfer your wanted files, this is another avenue you can pursue.
The external is a crapshoot.
