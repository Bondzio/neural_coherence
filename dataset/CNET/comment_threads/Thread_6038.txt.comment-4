The company I work for bought two V2 Premier computers and so far we've replaced 3 motherboards, two power supplies and two hard drives...the techs who came to repair them said they are constantly working on these computers.
Basically we're replaced everything in both computers in less than a year and they still reboot and have numerous stop errors...You have to keep calling them before your warantee expires or you will be stuck with a piece of junk...sorry.
