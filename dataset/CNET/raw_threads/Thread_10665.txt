5011	11	298651	2801730	2796173	3rdalbum	6/29/08 1:23 AM	1.21470258E12	exactly why	windows talking windows xp vista support gigabytes ram minus hardware devices contain their own memory expensive editions windows server come bit edition use pae access gigabytes memory believe computer comes gigabytes ram almost certainly bit windows preinstalled bit linux distro preferred option least gigabytes ram youll able access couple hundred megs gigabytes
5011	12	298651	2802264	2801730	22003693772731064779096366802102	6/29/08 7:14 PM	1.21476684E12	yeah	yeah recently switched over bit ubuntu loving too bad laptop hp dv support gb ram
