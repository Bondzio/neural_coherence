1.1.5	Or is it the end??	St
1.1.6	Please advice, anyone out there....HELP.. JACK	Ques
1.2.1	That's why I backup via an icon on my desktop or an batchfile on my removable hard disk.	St
1.2.2	And restore manually.	St
1.2.3	It's easy to click on the wrong icon or on the wrong batchfile.	St
1.2.4	And it's even possible that you do a manual restore the wrong way, thus overwriting your backup.	St
1.2.5	But it's unlikely you do a restore in stead of a backup this way.	St
1.2.6	Kees	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
