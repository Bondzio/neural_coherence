i agree with charlie.
like lee koo i use several external hard drives for backup.
i had the unfortunate experience of loosing two external drives at once and with them all my archived photos.
i did exactly as charlie says.
mine were ide drives so i had to be careful with the external plug but i got my computer to recognize the drives with the use of a rescue disk.
i could not access the drives directly as something in the file system (fat 32 at that time i think) was corrupt.
i retrieved all my photos and much of the data.
some of the data was corrupt but i got the photos which were the important items.
