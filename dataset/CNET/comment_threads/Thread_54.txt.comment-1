I just bought a Dell Poweredge 400 SC and it has a reportedly good 250 Watt Power supply.
However I intend to use a bit more stuff in it (Nvidia AGP, Sound Blaster card, Combo CD/DVD/RW) and was wondering if anyone was aware of a 3rd party replacement that fits the slightly non standard form factor Dell uses.
Dell's has the power plug and a 110/220 slider directly below it, but no on/off switch.
The mounting holes seem to match a standard ATX supply.
Looking from the back, the fans on the right and the power cord connector is upper left.
Any thoughts, thanks, John
