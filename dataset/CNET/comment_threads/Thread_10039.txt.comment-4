Thanks for the replies.
It was an internal drive i was looking for.
The reason I asked was I seem to remember that the laptop or os needed a piece of built in software to enable you to play discs a bit like dvd software but hardcoded in.
I was looking at this drive: http://www.advancetec.co.uk/pioneer-bdr-td03rt-internal-slim-6x-bdrw-bluray-writer-for-laptop-small-form-factor.html it seems cheap enough and does what I want
