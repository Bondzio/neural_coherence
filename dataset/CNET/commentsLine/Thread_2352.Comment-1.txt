i have read all the other reviews witg people regarding there f1703 blacking out and i am certain that my monitor has the same defect my f1503 flat pannel.
it blacks out and then if i turn it on and off again it comes up for about 2 seconds than blacks out again.
hp says they can do nothing b/c my model has not been recalled but it is evident that it is the same problem as the f1703 and hp is just screwing me over.
