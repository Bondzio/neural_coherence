Clicking noises could be a power issue.
Try an Y-cable (to connect it with 2 slots), or a powered hub, or run your laptop from an adapter.
Or, as Bob suggested, another enclosure or directly in the case.
Luckily, as long as it makes these sounds, most likely you can't even format it.
So you won't lose your files.
But better make a copy to another disk as soon as possible.
