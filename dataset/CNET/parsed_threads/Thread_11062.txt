<s> While trying to find and install a working driver for a DVD Drive on Windows 98 (if that's even possible), one program I tried screwed me over on both of my drives so now the computer will not detect either. </s>
<s> I need firmware for both. </s>
<s> The info I gathered on each: Ricoh Company RW5125A DVD/CDRW and... HP CD-WRITER PLUS 8000 Series 4x2x20x IDE HP C4465-56000 Please help, two drives down the drain really stinks I'll get more information or pictures if need be. </s>
<s> what do u mean lose firmware... firmware and driver are different... i am thinking that the drivers are missing. </s>
<s> give the spec of ur computer. </s>
<s> if this is indeed an hp or compaq machine visit the site. </s>
<s> what would be much easier would be go out and buy a new dvd burner drive. </s>
<s> it is probably much faster at reading and burning disks than both of your drives and relatively inexpensive and easy to install. </s>
<s> thanks for the advice, i thought about just getting a new one, but um...yeah really weird story. </s>
<s> you probably wont even believe it, the computer is just sitting there turned on while im over here on this one, and it just like turns off randomly. </s>
<s> so i turn it back on, and the drives work (take note this is maybe the 8th or so time the computer has been restarted) but now i need to find a driver for the ricoh. </s>
<s> my problem was firmware, and now its the driver </s>
<s> Does the system 'SEE' the compact disc drives during bootup ? </s>
<s> Optical drive firmware...start here. </s>

<s> I solved the issue but thanks. </s>
<s> I just need a driver now for the Ricoh RW5125A </s>
<s> It didnt, it would say they are incompatible on startup, now i believe it does. </s>
<s> but as CD-ROM's, i need drivers for them </s>
<s> Try here for latest. </s>
<s> http://www.met.com.tw/eng/download/lists/list_03.htm You'll need software to play movies or burn discs, but no drivers. </s>
<s> You didn't mention things like PowerDVD (Cyberlink) or Nero, so we don't know what you already have. </s>
