you said you were able to share the printers so... go through the &quot;add printer wizard&quot; and add a network printer.
for the printer name put the computer share name followed by the printer share name (e.g.
\\my-computer\my-printer).
then point it to a print driver and !viola.
you can also browse to the share and install it that way as well.
the easiest way to do this is start&gt;run...in the open box type in the computer name you are trying to connect to \\my-computer then click ok. the whack-whack bars are needed for the computer to understand you are looking for a network name.
this should open the shares on the \\my-computer.
you should notice the printer that you shared by the name you have given it.
double-click the printer and it should prompt you for installation.
hope this helps a bit.
