I disconnected the USB and the noise stopped. However when I re attached the USB problems started. Firstly, the windows explorer of drive :F was responding very slowly, when I tried to copy a few things over explorer.exe crashed. This happened a few times after. However on a reset on the computer and reboot of device, I could not even access the storagebird. On my computer the device had been renamed to local disk opposed to Storagebird which it is meant to be, and also every 2 mintues the blue light flashed for a few seconds. Finally after about 10 mintues of windows explorer crashing (firefox and other programs worked fine) the light stopped flashing and a error came up saying :F\ is not accessible. The request could not be performed because of I/O device error.

As to backup, what to do with the files you didn't backup, we've discussed this in this forum a few times so be sure to leverage those discussions.
