I have installed 256 of pc133(crucial) memory and 128 (unsure of the speed, doesnt say on stick), from my p3 1gig dell. There was already a 128 pc133 (crucial) stick in the pc. The bios shows 512 installed, is there any settings that could be changed in the bios or any other ideas??

For instance the larger RAM might go in slot 0 while the smaller goes in 1. 0 is usually the one nearest the CPU but again see your users manual. Sure you bought the right RAM memory. Better check! Here a link to make sure there running RAM that is good. Sometimes the RAM is bad when you buy it. http://oca.microsoft.com/en/windiag.asp This is a helpful guide to RAM memory: http://www.kingston.com/tools/UMG/default.asp
