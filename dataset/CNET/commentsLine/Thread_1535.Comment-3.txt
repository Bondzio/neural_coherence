between the time i wrote this post and now i have changed back to wanting a good old nvidia (i have never used ati yet, all my cards are nvidia but none are very good i still have my old geforce 2 mx200) so now my question shifts to will there be a considerable difference between the geforce fx 5600 ultra and the geforce fx 5700 ultra?
(i would prefer the 5600 since it costs less, and has vivo)
