what additional information would you like?
i have about 30 bsod minidumps since 1/17/10 that i could provide.
would a system restore to factory settings be worth a shot?
i guess that if things still are haywire it would pretty much cingle out the memory, right?
i just can't beleive that the memory passed the memtest86+ and a stress test if it is faulty.
is that possible?
thank you!
