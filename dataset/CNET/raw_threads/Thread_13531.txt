Our office is running XP Pro with DSL to a netgear router then to a 24 port netgear hub, that everything is hardwired to. We have recently undergone a medical software change from a server to a web based program. In order to maximize utilization of our new software, a wireless connection has become necessary. The office is hardwired to all computer stations, but we are trying to implement tablet PC's (Toshiba Tecra with wifi), which will be carried into the patient exam rooms by the physician, where a patient charge slip will be created. I need for the tablet to be able to communicate with the network so that it will not only create the &quot;Super bill&quot; on line, but also communicate with the print router to print out patient receipts. My question is what kind of equipment do I need to achieve this? I want the best, most secure, and fastest system for my money, and really don't know where to start. Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated, as I am trying to save as much money as possible. Dr's don't make what they used to.

I won't repeat prior discussions about wifi security where I dismember one protection after another but if you purchase the usual wifi router you see from Linksys, Dlink, Netgear or other then enable WEP, WPA (your choice) as well as enable MAC FILTERING then that's the state of today's best protection. I see no need to describe MAC FILTERING since it will be in the product manual or you can ask any search engine. If you want absolute security then wifi is never an option. Part of this has to do with governmental restrictions on encryption so don't blame the vendors. Bob

The last thing I need to do is spend an enourmous amount of time trying to learn all this. I hate to hire anyone to do anything around here, because it's not a matter of &quot;if you will get screwed&quot; just to what degree. I did buy a new router today though, a Cisco 1721. A couple of questions. Since our program is web based does it increase or decrease security risks like the ones you mentioned in the discussion? How secure does a pediatric clinic really need to be anyway? Who would want to hack into that? Or am I way to careless with regards to security? Thanks for taking time explaining everything, I really appreciate it. Jim

Second, it also isn't near as difficult as the previous poster makes it. Here in the Atlanta area, almost every doctor I or my family have had to visit in the last year or so have WiFi and are using it successfully. Let me make this suggestion, contact some other doctor's offices in your area and ask their office manager if they use WiFi and who they recommend. I think you will be pleasantly surprised by their responses and help. As to the &quot;getting ripped off&quot; problem, while that may be a legitimate issue, the Dallas area has a great PC Users Group. You might want to also contact them and see what type of expertise they have and can recommend. The biggest issue is don't get frustrated or overwhelmed by the problem. It has been solved and does work, so you just need to concentrate on making the right choices for your business. And also, thanks for taking care of the kids out in the Dallas area. These days, being a doctor, means a lot more than people give credit for. Good Luck and please let us know how you make out or if you have any other questions.
