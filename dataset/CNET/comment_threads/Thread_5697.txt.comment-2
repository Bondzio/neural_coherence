Most computers either come with a set of disks to recover your computer to out of box condition or has a feature to make a set of recovery disks to correct problems just like yours.
They also have a D partition on the hard drive that has a recovery program.
There are several free programs such as Rkill, Malwarebytes, Superantivirus and others that don't cost anything except the price of a blank CD and the time to run them.
There are free antivirus programs you can download and run, just Google &quot;Free Antivirus programs&quot; and choose one.
Some ISPs will give you free antivirus programs just for subscribing to their service.
In my case I am with Comcast and they supply Norton 360v5 at no charge.
