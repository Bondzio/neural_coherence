i think the problem is that ubuntu was trying to instal itself on the hard drive where windows 8 exist and since there is no room there as i did not shrink it, hoping ubuntu would use the other hard drive it failed.
if i shrink the first hard drive that windows 8 is on it and if ubuntu installs correctly can i move it or give it more room from the second drive which would be free it is just a thought i am a beginner and do not know exactly if the cause of the error message (cant mount file) is really what i just said any expert thoughts/suggestions please?
