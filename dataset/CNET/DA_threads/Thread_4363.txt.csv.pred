1.1.1	Built my first computer yesterday , everything was plugged in correctly .	St
1.1.2	Went to turn on computer the power supply briefly flashes then nothing happens .	St
1.1.3	I am not sure what is wrong whether it is the Motherboard , PSU , or something else .	St
1.1.4	I bought an Aspire 500W PSU .	St
1.1.5	I tried the case PSU same type of thing happened except no LED lights to tell if it turned on .	St
1.1.6	Any help would be greatly appreciated	Polite
1.2.1	Do they sort of & quot ; twitch & quot ; and stop ?	Ques
1.2.2	If so , the PS has shut down sensing an overload .	St
1.2.3	Now it 's time to look for what is shorted out .	St
1.2.4	The best way is to remove the MB from the case and assemble it on a non-metalic surface and see if you can get fans and such to start .	St
1.2.5	One common problem is extra metal mounting posts that short out something on the rear of the MB .	St
1.2.6	Another can be poorly seated boards or memory modules .	St
