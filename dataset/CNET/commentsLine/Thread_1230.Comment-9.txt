thats what i get for trusting the manufacturers of both the computer and the operating system that runs it to tell me what i need to know about their product.
thank you for your time and your ability to state the obvious.
i use computers every day and i'm almost always able to fix my own issues but this time i got the idea in my head that i could run 4gb of ram on my computer, of course this idea was given to me by a salesman selling ram of course.
anyway, thank you for your help and now i'll sit back and wait to see if the apps i use will ever be compatible with an 64bit os.
