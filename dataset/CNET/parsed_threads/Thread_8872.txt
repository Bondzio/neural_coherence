<s> Ok so im a trainee in a IT dept, and i was tasked to configure a WAP(WAP-6011 Level One). </s>
<s> The WAP needs to be configured to extend a network from a WIFI router so that coverage is available for all corners in the office. </s>
<s> Having little knowledge in networking, this task was meant to provide some exposure on configure network devices. </s>
<s> However i cant seem to get the WAP going. </s>
<s> I'd tried almost every single operation mode that is given with universal repeater seems to be the most plausible option to go for, in which i can get connected to the WAP from other devices but no access to internet. </s>
<s> Any guides/pointers would be much appriciated. </s>
<s> (Do excuse my posting should it contain any errors because its my first time posting). </s>
<s> I think it's best if you go and talk with your mentor or supervisor or whatever he's called, and ask for a little bit of help. </s>
<s> After all, a traineeship implies being trained. </s>
<s> And showing you're open to learn from him makes a good impression. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> It might. </s>
<s> It's just that i'd like to somehow try myself first before i go to my supervisor for help else it'll make me look like a lazy person no trying. </s>
<s> So far the options i tried I had no clue or whatsoever they does so it does help if you give me some general idea/description on where should i be heading towards. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply </s>
<s> Then you get out the book on the product and follow its install/setup procedure. </s>
<s> If it requires information about the installed system you ask for that. </s>
<s> I've encountered new IT staffers that get upset as I go to the manual and we read it together. </s>
<s> They don't last long. </s>
