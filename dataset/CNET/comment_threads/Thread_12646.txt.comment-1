Hi I am a tad confused.
I have a generic desktop PC running an ASUS H61-MX-USB3 board.
To date I have run this wired to my router (a D-LINK DSL-2680) but as I now have a multitude of other (potentially) wireless devices, such as games players etc I wanted to re-rig to run wireless.
I have two old redundant (generic) desktops both with ASUS boards and PCI cards installed.
I took one of the cards out (a Belkin G) to use but the motherboard ports are different?
No amount of google etc has indicated when they or if they changed.
I realise having read elsewhere on CNET that I could use a USB adapter (but which one?)
but the consensus seems to favour a card.
I am a simple soul and your advice would be appreciated; greatly!
