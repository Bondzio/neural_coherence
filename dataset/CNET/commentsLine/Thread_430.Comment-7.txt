this idiot was building a new computer and setting up the old one for another user.
the old one was using an ls120 [ide] drive as the floppy.
this was needed for the new computer which had the old hard drive with quickbooks on it.
used it to back up quickbooks.
now two years ago, this same idiot disabled the floppy controller because at that time the system didn't have a floppy drive.
guess what happened when i enabled the floppy controller in the bios.
now i have an isa controller that can handle a bunch of floppies.
anyone need it?
?
