<s> Hi,Im Edwin I was wondering what is a good backup program that can back up to a external hard drive? </s>
<s> (I own an custom build 250GB External HD) Thanks You can email me at edwinqut@hotmail.com </s>
<s> Pictures or documents and music you can simply copy/paste them. </s>
<s> If you need to clone the entire drive use this. </s>
<s> http://www.xxclone.com/ </s>
<s> Hard disks fail, and your attached drive could be wiped out when a virus or other disaster strikes. </s>
<s> That's a fine copy, but where is the real backup? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It can backup to any removable disk (including external one) also i find it very reliable and rather cheap. </s>
<s> http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/trueimage/ this is the last 10_th version, but u can download the 7_th for free http://www.acronis.com/mag/vnu-ati7 </s>

<s> Bob, Are you saying that backing up to an external hard drive is not enough? </s>
<s> How would you suggest backing up data from a pc&gt; </s>
<s> My backup includes multiple media and multiple locations. </s>
<s> YOU must develop and choose your plan. </s>
<s> All I can do is warn people off about &quot;storing&quot; stuff on some external drive. </s>
<s> A visit to our Storage forum is like a visit to a data graveyard. </s>
<s> My backups are: 1. </s>
<s> Copy to the USB hard disk. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Copy to a secure OpenSSH server. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Then some DVDRW disks 4. </s>
<s> And to my set of USB memory keys that have the bare essentials of what I can't lose. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I was planning on backing up my data to 2 separate external usb hard drives, I will also check out the Storage forum. </s>
