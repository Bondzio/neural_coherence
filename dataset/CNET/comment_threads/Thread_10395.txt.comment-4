only have a bicycle.
Others only have a car.
Some have both.
Depends on their needs.
Same with you.
What are your needs?
You didn't tell.
How about the new Asus Fonepad?
That's a 7&quot; tablet (like the Nexus 7 or the iPad mini) that doubles as a phone.
Maybe that's what you were looking for but didn't know it existed.
