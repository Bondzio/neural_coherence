when i move the switch back and forth it goes from orange to blue indicating the antenna is on and as i said, the bluetooth on the card still works.
the antenna icon indicates that it likewise goes on and off.
hp wireless asst says the bluetooth is on as well, but reads no wireless card as it used to.
the wireless b/g has disappeared from the the list of devices and the hp wireless asst.
since the bluetooth and the wireless b/g are supposedly on the same broadcom card, i find it odd that only the wireless portion seems to have disappeared.
