1.1.1	Im just looking for opinions on a good 22 & quot ; or 24 & quot ; LCD widescreen monitor for under $ 600 for my PC .	St
1.1.2	Ive seen some good samsungs and dell but still not sure which one , im going by some stores to take a look also but just wanted to get some feedback .	St
1.2.1	... I just received this monitor this week .	St
1.2.2	It 's a 22 & quot ; widescreen .	St
1.2.3	Only $ 219 at buy.com ( free shipping ) .	St
1.2.4	It 's a good budget monitor .	St
1.2.5	On the high end , definitely get the Dell 2407WFP .	St
1.2.6	Every magazine and reviewer has given this monitor higher marks than the Samsung .	St
1.3.1	has , or at least was having , a sale on a Westinghouse widescreen , which was of exceptional quality , and only around $ 180 in-store , not sure if the sale has ended Other good options are always Apple Cinema HD ( you pay more , but its guranteed to be a good display ) , Dell produces a sound monitor , Samsung 's are always decent to stellar depending on which one you 're buying , LG produces decent monitors , and Acer has produced a decent line of affordable monitors .	St
1.3.2	24 & quot ; probably is n't possible for under $ 600 , at least not without sales , and if it is , its probably not a panel you 'd want to own .	St
1.3.3	For a 24 & quot ; , you want 1920x1200 as the native resolution , do n't settle for anything else , for 22 & quot ; , ideally you want 1680x1050 or 1920x1200 , for 19 & quot ; , 1440x900 or 1680x1050 , and I would n't entirely write off 19 & quot ; widescreens .	St
1.3.4	Also , ensure your computer can support the resolution of the monitor you intend to buy , and by support , I mean not only drive in a 2D display , but handle it in 3D games .	St
1.4.1	I have a geforce 8800 GTS 320 factory Overclocked , so i have enough video power to run any monitor .	St
1.4.2	Thanks for the info .	St
1.4.3	I 'll check and see if any sales are going on still .	St
1.5.1	You should of gotten the 640 for anything over 22 & quot ;	St
1.6.1	my plan is to later get a 2nd 320 , which will have the same ram as a 640 but be much faster .	St
1.6.2	i didnt want to spend all that mony at once .	St
1.6.3	my mobo will suport SLI running at full speed 16x PCIE .	St
1.7.1	being able to run & quot ; any monitor & quot ; Also , the 640MB IS wasteful , I agree with the SLI option Look at this to get more of a perspective on what you can do with your card : http : //www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion : System_Requirements # Requirements_To_Run_Oblivion_on_Absolute_Max_settings Oblivion is surprisingly simmilar to a number of other current top level DX9c games , while the 8800 is fast , it is by no means capable of doing everything on the market at maxed settings on a 1920x1200 or 2560x1600 monitor ( playable that is ) , something to keep in mind .	St
1.8.1	i just mean that i could run any of the 22 or 24 inch monitors ive been looking at , im not planning on going any larger .	St
1.8.2	I know that a lot of the high end games still have a hard time if i try and run it at a max res of 1600x ?	Ques
1.8.3	or higher .	St
1.8.4	What I 'll probably do is compare the frames per second with the game video settings and get something that works once i get the monitor .	St
1.9.1	24 & quot ; monitors run at 1920x1200 vs 1680x1050 for 22 & quot ; ers , or 30 % more pixels .	St
1.9.2	your games will be able to run faster with more eye candy on the 22 & quot ; and there 's not that much of a difference in size .	St
1.9.3	samsungs are typically considered the best LCDs for gamers .	St
1.9.4	acers are good and i 'm perfectly happy with my westinghouse .	St
1.9.5	be sure to demo the monitor in person if possible and check the viewing angles and ghosting for yourself .	St
1.10.1	Unless anyone else has a suggestion im leaning more towards the Samsung SyncMaster 226BW Black 22 & quot ; Widescreen LCD Monitor right now .	St
1.10.2	Bestbuy has it for $ 320 , the only bad thing is it doesnt have the ability to adjust up and down but its not a huge deal .	St
1.10.3	Ill take a look at the acers and westinghouse while im there also .	Sug
1.11.1	should be about half that price , so keep that in mind , it might be a better deal the reason I added the bit about the video card , if your card ca n't run the games you have in mind at the monitor 's native resolution , it 'll look awful ( especially on a widescreen ) because its an LCD so if the card ca n't handle 1680x1050 , or 1920x1200 , its more or less not worth having the pixels , yes , you can run lower resolutions , but it looks a lot worse ( you loose a lot of clarity due to how LCDs are designed and how they operate ) a 22 & quot ; is probably a safer choice , as 1680x1050 is a friendlier resolution than 1920x1200 ( and if you have to scale 1440x900 to it , it wo n't look as pixelated as it would if scaled on a 1920x1200 panel )	St
