sorry if i confused you with the abbrev.
before you get a motherboard, you need to make sure it will fit in your case (unless you're willing to get a new case) and your power supply can work with it (unless you're willing to get a new power supply).
the easiest way to determine that is to get the size and type of your current motherboard and/or your current pc's model number.
i don't want to recommend something that may not work for your setup.
