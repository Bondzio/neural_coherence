initial setup: satellite internet link is in the house with the receiver box upstairs in back bedroom used as home office.
main computer was wired to ancient netgear 802.11b access point/router and sometimes used a wireless card in a laptop from the other room.
''problem:'' built a cozy little office in converted tack room of upper level hayloft in barn, about 150 yards across the field.
had same question as you.
solution in three easy pieces: piece no.
1: a much longer ethernet cable poked through a small hole in the wall between the front and back bedrooms so that the netgear router could be moved to the front bedroom, sitting on a small table by the window.
piece no.
2: a homemade parabolic reflector on the antenna of the router made from stiff paper and foil, pattern and simple instructions can be downloaded from  (sorry, can't make a clickable link of that url, the cnet anti-spam filter will farkle the word &quot;free&quot; in it, so copy and paste to your browser address bar...) piece no.
3: a hawking higain usb wireless adapter.
i choose that one because it had directional antenna which can be placed on a shelf where it can point out the new barn office door through the window in the hallway toward the house.
72% signal strength through 4 layers of glass, mid-60% signal strength if i move the hawking antenna to the middle of the desk where the signal must pass through the wooden barn walls instead of through the window.
