1.1.1	I just have a simple question .	St
1.1.2	Do you have to use DDR3200 with a XP 3200+ , because I have seen on many sites that it is a requirement , also MSI told me that i needed it .	St
1.1.3	HELP	St
1.2.1	will simply run at a lower clock speed .	St
1.2.2	{ within reason ] .	St
1.2.3	Simply check the manual for the mobo to see what the lowest FSB that it will support is .	Sug
1.3.1	It boils down to a good matching of componets .	St
1.3.2	When you get a high end cpu , expect to have high end ram in order to take advantage of the abilities present , otherwise it may just default to what works , which usually is lower results .	St
1.3.3	enjoy -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.4.1	You probably are n't going to see any difference between PC2700 and PC3200 outside of a benchtest .	St
1.4.2	That 's if you already have DDR memory of some sort .	St
1.4.3	If not , buy 3200. chuck	St
1.5.1	mobo's/chipsets that allow the FSB and the memory bus run asynchronously .	St
1.5.2	The system processing is slower [ maybe not noticeably ] becase when the & quot ; next & quot ; clock arrives for the FS bus , the data is not avauble until the next clock of the memory bus .	St
1.5.3	The Northbridge compensates by introducing & quot ; wait & quot ; states .	St
1.5.4	These are states where the memory process has to wait for a clock time very frequently , resulting in slower speed overall..	St
