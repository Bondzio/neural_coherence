while using the second internal hd solves the problem with booting from another hd, it makes the clone copy vulnerable to the same atacks as the first hd (theft, fire, mechanical damage of the pc, overvoltage etc.)
so it is generally safer to use external disk - and store it separately.
you naturally won't be able to boot a working windows system from your external cloned hd, unless you physically replace it for the original one in its place.
but the cloning software you used for creating the copy (i myself prefer hdclone, after trying acronis and norton first) will of course allow you to restore the original contents onto original/replaced hd.
the cloning soft can be booted as stand-alone system to accomplish this.
it is also advisable to divide your internal hd into at least two partitions, for the system and data, because a cloning soft enables you to clone just a partition.
so you can clone the complete hd at the beginning and later replace only that part of image (partition) which has significantly changed.
additionaly, since cloning is usually very tim-consuming action, it can save you a lot of waiting .
a good cloning software is hard to get free of charge, but price of individual cloning systems is so low and its role in data security so high that i didn't hesitate to spend those few bucks for it.
