<s> When you run FDISK, if you don't answer YES to large disk support, you get 2 (or 1.9999) GB partitions. </s>

<s> ive tried running fdisk and ive enabled larger disk space but it doesnt seem to work.anymore ideas?thanx </s>
<s> You didn't describe in detail what doesn't work. </s>
<s> But to give a little push, FDISK from Microsoft only lets you delete and add partitions. </s>
<s> But once you made that 2GB partition, then you limited what could be done. </s>
<s> You would have to delete all the partitions and start over. </s>
<s> Some don't find FDISK easy enough and pay for PARTITION MAGIC. </s>
<s> I never use PARTITION MAGIC since I learned too long ago how to use FDISK. </s>
