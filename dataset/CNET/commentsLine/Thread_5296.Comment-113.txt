whatever you decide, do it now.
graphics cards like everything else move on with time and you may find that in a couple of years the latest cards do not fit into your pc.
i have had the same experience and due to slow performance recently decided to add a graphics card to my 3 year old desktop.
alas the existing slot is too small for the current available cards.
i might as well buy a new pc for the cost of modifications to my existing one.
do not procrastinate.
