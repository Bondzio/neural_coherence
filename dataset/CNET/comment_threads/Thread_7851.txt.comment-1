I'm planning on buying a new laptop soon since my current HP ZT3000's monitor does not work properly (works 1/50 times the laptop is turned on) so it's constantly hooked to an external and... well, no longer a laptop (costs around $600 to have it fixed by buying a new motherboard).
I remember when I bought a desktop 6 years ago I went with an AMD because they were generally cheaper than the pentiums, and performance-wise they were almost the same.
With all this new intel dual-core, Inter core duo and AMD dual-core, I'm kinda lost now.
What's the best option out there?
