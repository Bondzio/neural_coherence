choose the e6400 but a 'plain' p5b instead.
here's a feature comparison.
unless you *need* dual gigabit lan, dolby audio, dual x16 graphics slots (crossfire), firewire, ecc ram, or matrix raid, the p5b should be sufficient.
(if you're not going to use the features, why pay for them?)
the 965 chipset actually overclocks better than the 975 chipset and its just as stable (if not more stable).
for video editting use, most modern gpus perform the same.
still, i'd get at least a 7300gt so vista's aero interface won't be sluggish.
go with 2x1gb of fast memory.
i prefer ddr2-667 with agressive timings to ddr2-800 for better stability, but ddr2-533 value ram is needlessly slow.
the sonata ii is a very quiet case.
consider the p180 only if you want its looks, need an even quieter case, or plan on serious overclocking.
