Thanks for your time and efforts , but the issue with NVIDIA 8400 and Intel 965 is history .
I want to know if you have encountered any issues with the NVIDIA 240 GPU and ATI Xpress 200 chipset .
I have configured PCs with Intel G31 and G41 chipsets as well as the X58 chipset ( Intel X58BP server board ) with NVIDIA GPUs cards ; No issues at all .
I am just asking because I have no experience with the ATI Xpress 200 chipset .
Thanks Sam
