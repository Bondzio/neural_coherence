I have worked on PCs with BIOS that had some limit on the number of devices it would show in the boot order.
I had to disable the ones I didn't want in order to get others to show up.
Go figure...I couldn't.
As for the mysterious floppy drive, I suspect your BIOS isn't set up properly.
There may be an option to show whether one is present or not.
If it shows as present and you don't have the &quot;floppy seek on boot&quot; turned on, you may not get the usually floppy drive error.
In any event, see if your BIOS shows the floppy as present or enabled and change to not present/disabled.
