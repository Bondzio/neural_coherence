i am putting together an old computer from parts and have an old isa sb 16 sound card.
running under win me it works but in system in the control panel there is an unknown device and under that is an unsupported device.
when i delete the unsupported device and reboot the computer finds the sb 16 and unsupported device and installs them.
i've tried drivers and deleting the sound card but it always comes back.
if i leave the sound card out, it is fine, so i know it is the sb 16. the problem is that when this happens my linksys usb100tx responds during the windows start up screen and shuts off before it gets to my desktop.
thus no network log on and i have to re-install the usb100tx causing me to have to reboot and start the cycle again.
any suggestions?
