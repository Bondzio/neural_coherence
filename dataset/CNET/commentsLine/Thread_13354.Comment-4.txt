i forgot to mention you may want to look for a better psu.
the wattage you have may not be capable or a weak leg of the power is stressed.
also, since you mentioned replaced heatsinks, be 100% sure the cpu(hsf) is properly attached and rated for your cpu.
that a small amt.
of thermo goop is all you need, excess actually hurts here.
also, beware of using thermo goop where the manufacturer has already placed a thermo pad, remove pad and use goop.
otherwise, idf properly installed the thermo pad will suffice.
