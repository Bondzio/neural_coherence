1.1.3	Anything else I need to do to make this work ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Does the 700 get on the internet ?	Ques
1.2.2	You could use GMAIL to make a draft email then attach files .	Sug
1.2.3	Just do n't send it .	Sug
1.2.4	Then on the new machine look at your gmail and copy out the attachments .	St

1.3.2	And , many of the files I need to transfer are large ( graphic designer here . )	St

1.4.1	Either way the machine would crash .	St
1.4.2	Ok , the old fashioned way .	St
1.4.3	Go get a FTP SERVER on your new mac .	St
1.4.4	Now FTP the files over fast .	St
1.4.5	This is not to offer a course on IP addresses and networking or FTP use .	St

1.5.1	that you get an ethernet crossover cable and use it to connect the two macs together .	St
1.5.2	On the Quadra , turn on File Sharing and share the quadra hard drive , allowing access to everyone , including guests .	St
1.5.3	Connect to that HD from the iMac and suck the files off of the quadra .	St
