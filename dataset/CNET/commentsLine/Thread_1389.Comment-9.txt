i have faced the same question that you have now several times in the past and its one that only you can truely answer.
you have several options.
1. you can add more ram very inexpensively.
this could be below $100.
in cost.
2. you can add another hard drive for well under $100.
and still use your current hard drive.
3. you could purchase a barebones system and add your cd/dvd/floppy and all of the other extras you currently have for well under $400.
if you do not use your computer for anything other than the normal surfing and word documents your speed for the processor is fine, however, if you are looking for mp3/dvd downloading you probably will want to upgrade to a faster speed for your cpu.
the computer i just built cost me under $900.
and it is pretty good too.
it has an amd 64-bit 2800 processor using a mach speed 754 motherboard and corsair for the ram.
barebone system $199 ram 2g $205 hard drive 80g $ 89 17&quot; flat panel $247 ati video card w/256gddr $120 total $860 all of these prices were with no rebates and includes the shipping.
i put this together myself so it didn't cost me anymore for the labor.
my system kicks and i can do just about anything.
i won't have to do another upgrade for at least a year or two.
