the html problem with these forums is that it can't do it well except for smileys.....since : ) together or : &gt; together or : \ is simple html for smileys, that's what you end up with so if you are going to type C: &gt; or C: ) or C: \ and normally wouldn't put in the space, just type C: or C: prompt instead and we'll get the picture.
Most of us forget that the html coding here is crapped out so if you see an inadvertent smiley assume it is actually : ) or : &gt; : \ instead.
OK.....on to the next problem.
Are you saying that the software has already been installed and that you now want the END product to be sent/stored on the F: drive?
If so, look in the settings/configurations of the program itself to direct it to a specific folder you create on the F: drive ahead of time (usually it will say something like DESTINATION or STORE LOCATION....with the C: \ in front of the default folder setting so you can create a new folder with the same name but change the drive to F: \ instead.
The reason both drives are marked as Primary Partition is because when the drives were created by the IT, he didn't make the new one just an Extended Partition with a logical drive instead that Extended Partition.
This way, you could always just install XP or another operating system on it and it would be ready to be a bootable drive....whereas Extended Partitions would have to be completely redone to be bootable.
