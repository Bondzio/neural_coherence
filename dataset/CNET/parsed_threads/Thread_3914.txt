<s> My 40GB Maxtor hard disk crashed. </s>
<s> It cant be detected when booting up, giving a message saying that Primary.. bla.. bla failed. </s>
<s> I even have tried setting it as Secondary using another hard drive as primary, the status still failed. </s>
<s> When I enter the BIOS, I can see that it recognises my 40GB hard disk. </s>
<s> There's a lot of data in the crashed hard drive. </s>
<s> How can I salvage the data in it. </s>
<s> Is there any utility of software that I can try and use. </s>
<s> Can I ask why you did that? </s>
<s> Error messages are GOLD. </s>
<s> What you add to it is &quot;the story&quot;. </s>
<s> As it stands, I ask you to find a bla bla ... Oops couldn't resist... KNOPPIX CD, boot it up and see if it sees the data. </s>
<s> Try power off, open the case and reseat the cables and boards, then try again as well. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I guess I should have provided more details. </s>
<s> The bla... bla... is I just cant really remember the error message. </s>
<s> Anyway, the error is Primary hard disk 0 not found. </s>
<s> The cables are working find as I can use another hard drive on the same machine and it bootups up as per normal. </s>
<s> I know to check the BIOS first since too many diddle and end up disabling the IDE channels. </s>
<s> Next? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Check the BIOS IDE settings. </s>
<s> (Defaults are nice) 2. </s>
<s> Move the drive and cable to the secondary IDE channel. </s>
<s> Does it detect it? </s>
<s> Do not boot that! </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> If detected, try primary channel again and a new 80 conductor cable. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Check drive jumper settings. </s>
<s> Few get them right. </s>
<s> Rules are simple, opinions many. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Move the drive and new cable to a test machine. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> Does the drive spin? </s>
<s> Do tell! </s>
<s> Best of luck. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Actually I have done all that you have suggested even before you replied. </s>
<s> See my answer below 1. </s>
<s> Check the BIOS IDE settings. </s>
<s> Ans : Done. </s>
<s> Ok. 2. </s>
<s> Move the drive and cable to the secondary IDE channel. </s>
<s> Does it detect it? </s>
<s> Do not boot that! </s>
<s> Ans : Done. </s>
<s> Ok. 3. </s>
<s> If detected, try primary channel again and a new 80 conductor cable. </s>

<s> Ans : Done. </s>
<s> Ok. 5. </s>
<s> Move the drive and new cable to a test machine. </s>
<s> Ans. </s>
<s> No. </s>
<s> Do not have a test machine around. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> Does the drive spin? </s>
<s> Do tell! </s>
<s> Ans : Yes </s>
<s> Put another hard disk in place of the failed unit. </s>
<s> In closing, You may have done all that and that's great, but think about sharing it in advance so to move faster towards new idea. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have put another hard drive in replace of the failed unit. </s>
<s> I mentioned it before(in article 3).I have replaced my machine with a new HDD. </s>
<s> A new one. </s>
<s> Re-installed everything, from the OS, firewall, application, programs etc etc. </s>
<s> What I am missing now is my data that is in the failed HDD. </s>
<s> I have actually went to the manufacture website(www.maxtor.com) and downloaded an utility called PowerMax and runs a diagnostic on my failed HDD. </s>
<s> The result is from the utility is &quot;HDD is failing. </s>
<s> Pls backup all nescessary data&quot;. </s>
<s> Data recovery companies, KNOPPIX and sites like http://pub50.bravenet.com/faq/show.php?usernum=4220517151&catid=3726 If you wait till a drive fails before backup... As to me duplicating a prior item, I will do that since I will not review each post again unless I need to. </s>
<s> If this annoys you, please don't read my replies. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
<s> Nope. </s>
<s> You didnt annoy. </s>
<s> I guess I'm just a little disappointed at myself for not taking nescessary precaution. </s>
<s> If you decide not to go to data recovery hoses and KNOPPIX and other freebie recovery fails, try these common plays: -&gt; Put the drive in an antistatic bag and airtight into the fridge over night. </s>
<s> See if it comes back long enough to drag data off it. </s>
<s> -&gt; Unscrew the back PCB and gently wiggle all connections. </s>
<s> Put it back together and try again. </s>
<s> -&gt; Find the exact drive and swap the PCB. </s>
<s> Sometimes you pay the price of a new working drive, but data is worth more than that. </s>
<s> The new working drive may fail so it's the price of this exercise. </s>
<s> -&gt; Rare, but worth it... </s>
<s> Try the drive on each of its side sides... -&gt; Only 80 conductor cables, CABLE SELECT and place it on the second IDE channel, boot the KNOPPIX CD and try again. </s>
