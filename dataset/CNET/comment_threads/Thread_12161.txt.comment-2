Firstly in order to do anything with a camcorder/pc hook up USB won't fly.
You need a firewire hook up, not sure what the unit has for output, either 4 or 5 pin.
The pc has to have a firewire hook up as well.
Basically it is a matter of getting the right cable and of course your computer having firewire capability.
Could it be used as a web cam, possibly.
Check the unit manual and specifications.
It would be easier, unless you have the hardware, firwire card in computer and proper link cable, to buy a usb web cam, they are cheap and readily available.
