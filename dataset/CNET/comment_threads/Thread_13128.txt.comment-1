My family owns 2 MacBooks plus XP desk top and Vista laptop.
Wireless setup is provided with an older linksys a/b/g router and Comcast Cable Modem.
The 2 MacBooks have frequent problems printing to the Brother 5250 DN printer, with connect fails.
I have to reset the IP addresss frequently to get the printers to work with the wireless side of the network.
The Windows OS PC's don't experience this problem.
I am at a loss as to why the Macs have this IP problems.
Any hints or solutions would be appreciated from the forum.
thanks in advance thedrifter
