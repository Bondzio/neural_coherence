I have an external USB/Firewire HD installed.
If I leave my MiniCruz flash drive plugged in during a re-boot, Windows (98SE) changes the drive letter on my external HD.
If I remove the flash drive, reboot, it corrects the problem.
Is there a way to lock the drive letter on the external HD so this stops happening?
