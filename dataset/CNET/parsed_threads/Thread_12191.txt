<s> CPU- Intel i3-3245 Motherboard- ASUS P8Z77-V LK Socket LGA 1155 Z77 ATX Graphics Card: EVGA GeForce GTX650Ti Boost 2GB How would these parts work together? </s>
<s> Do you think this could run BF3 Mid settings around 40FPS? </s>
<s> How would these parts work together? </s>
<s> Quite well I would think. </s>
<s> Do you think this could run BF3 Mid settings around 40FPS? </s>
<s> No idea. </s>
<s> Only someone with those exact parts can answer that. </s>
<s> Based on sys reqs for bf3 and benchmarks for the parts you listed......you should be fine. </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-650-ti-benchmark-gk106,3318-6.html Looking at the benchmark there we see 36.0 and 40.6 FPS in the first chart. </s>
<s> And looking at the rig they used at http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-650-ti-benchmark-gk106,3318-4.html we see that you are electing for something more than a few steps back. </s>
<s> My answer is no. </s>
<s> -&gt; When folk want a gaming machine on a budget I have 2 answers for that. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> This Haswell value build. </s>
<s> http://www.pcworld.com/article/2040319/build-the-ultimate-intel-haswell-pc-for-under-1000.html http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-hd-7790-bonaire-performance,3462-8.html shows it trade places with the 650 so I'm calling them comparable. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> If budget is the issue I give the nod to the AMD A10 based machine with good ram. </s>
<s> It games without the wallet drain. </s>

<s> I'm building my first computer and those are the parts I thought could do the best for $600, but I wanted toaje sure they were captible. </s>
<s> http://www.amazon.com/Virtual-5-1-surround-External-Sound-Card/dp/B000N35A0Y highlights why we must match RAM with the A10. </s>
<s> Keep in mind this was done with the A10-5800K I'd look to the 6800K just because of the occasional FPS render time slowdown, http://semiaccurate.com/2013/06/04/amd-brings-richland-to-the-desktop-the-a10-6800k/ shows a good graph and the 6800K would be my choice along with a pair of high speed memory sticks IF I wanted to do this on a budget. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The op is talking about the boost model. </s>
<s> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhQi3EhUZdc Granted I have no idea what rig the demo is feeding the cards with. </s>
<s> Seems like the boost model moves things along quite well. </s>
<s> Sorry I'll add the link about the RAM later today. </s>
