i am attempting to download wanted files on disc.every time i download a piece,i'm told to insert a new disc.these discs are 4.7gb and should hold the whole computer on one disc.i'm really sorry about my incompetence but this is giving me a major headache.i'm trying to download my address book and the computer just won't burn it.i had 5 discs and have little bits on each.now the computer refuses to download any more files because i used each disc?i was tempted to just start on the new download of osx but really want the addresses.what am i doing wrong?it says to drag the wanted file to the disc icon and it will then burn on command.it doesn't.it always demands a new disc.like i said,it's like teaching a first grader phonetics.
