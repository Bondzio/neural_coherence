<s> Thanks to all on this forum. </s>
<s> I have read threads and followed to other sites and read some more. </s>

<s> I'm pretty sure I want an Intel Dual 2 core proc, alteast 2-5 gigs of fast ram, a fast bus, a great video card, etc (in other words I want the thing to be fast) The biggest software program I run is Quickbooks Pro, soon to be 2008. </s>

<s> I don't know how to build a puter, and can't find one that's got all I want in a package. </s>
<s> BTW, don't want to spend more than $800-$1,000. </s>
<s> My question is can someone tell me where's the best place to buy and exactly what specs to make sure are included? </s>
<s> I promise not to hold anyone responsible later and will be eternally grateful not to think about this again for another 5 years. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>

<s> When it comes to computing it's all about speed and power. </s>
<s> These other systems lack speed and power in differing ways. </s>
