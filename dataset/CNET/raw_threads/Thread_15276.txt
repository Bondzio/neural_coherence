Is this hardware, software, maybe not enough cooling? Please help

Cooling is very important as well as adding a slight voltage increase for the cpu to be OC'ed. This is a go or no go process, until you finally get there. As you increase cpu voltage then cooling even in a default system is critial it becomes even more so with an OC'ed one. So you take your chances as it wre. good luck tada -----Willy
