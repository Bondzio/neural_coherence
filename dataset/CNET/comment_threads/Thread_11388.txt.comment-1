Hello ,I have macBook running tiger 10.4.10.
Recently I've been facing some difficulties while trying to burn cd's.
I am thinking about buying an external dvd burner.
Are there any recommendations?
Are there any limitations i should be aware of?
Would i have to remove my internal drive?
Thanks in advance
