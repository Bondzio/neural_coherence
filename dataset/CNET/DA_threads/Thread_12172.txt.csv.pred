1.1.1	Hi , I am running a Dell Laptop , with a docking station , and using a Netgear WGR614v9 router .	St
1.1.2	My goal is to be able to unhook the laptop and use it wireless when needed .	St
1.1.3	I have a wireless network going now and it works like a charm .	St
1.1.4	The problem is when I unhook , the network goes down .	St
1.1.5	I do not plan to have a PC wired to the router at all times .	St
1.1.6	My understanding is that this is not needed .	St
1.1.7	Cable is hooked to modem , modem is wired to the router , and the network cable is wired to the docking station .	St
1.1.8	I do not think I even need the connection to the docking station , but right now that is how it is set up .	St
1.1.9	I guess my question would be - can I run this router to just route the network signal and not have it set up as an access point or a permanent connection ?	Ques
1.1.10	Is this not possible ?	Ques
1.1.11	Thanks for any advice you have .	Polite
1.2.1	Set up the wireless protocols in the router via wired .	St
1.2.2	Unplug the wired cable and use the wireless connection .	St
1.2.3	Use the docking station as usual , but connect wireless .	St
1.2.4	& quot ; Going down & quot ; is a common issue when switching from wired to wireless , as in unplugging from a wired docking station .	St
1.2.5	Fixable by rebooting the laptop .	St
1.2.6	Sooooo , just set up the wireless and remove the Ethernet cable from the docking station .	St
1.2.7	Run wireless all the time .	St
