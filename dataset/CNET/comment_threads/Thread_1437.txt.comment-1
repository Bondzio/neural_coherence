Hi all, I'm hoping I can explain what we are trying to do without sounding like a complete idiot.
Doubtful.
We have a wireless signal in our house that comes through a service provided router.
The troubles come when we try to get internet to our shop which is separate from the house and a couple hundred feet away.
We have tried a wireless repeater with no success.
My husband ran CAT5 such that you can have a wired connection in the shop, but we cannot seem to get a wireless network to work through this connection.
At my disposal I have the service provided router, a Linksys Wireless-G WRT54G V8, and a Uspeed Wireless-N Wi-Fi Repeater Access Point Range Extender .
Any help would be most appreciated.
Thanks!
