Hi I recently got a TL-R470T+ I got it running with one modem with a dd-wrt router hooked up with it.
I'm trying to get my pepwave on the go to help speed up the internet a bit my neighbor let me use his wifi .
So I'm trying to hook up both to work and I can't seem to get it to work.
The pepwave and the modem work well by them selves but I cant get both of them to work.
Can I get some help please.
