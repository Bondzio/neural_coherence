I am unable to print any items sent to me by email.
I am using Outlook Express 6 on my Dell Dimension 8250.
When I go to File and then Print.
I just get a pop up window with the following error message An error has occurred in the script on this page.
Line 1344 Char 1 Error Unspecified error Code 0 URL Res://C:/WINDOWS\system32\shdoclc.dll/preview.dlg Do you wish to continue running scripts on this page?
Does anyone have a resolution for this problem please
