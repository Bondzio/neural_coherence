1.1.1	Hi, I am currently running SLI GTX460's and tend to keep my temps under 70C (73 being the max most cases) However, when Playing FF14 for the first time in a long while today, the temps ran to 79-80C and stayed there most of the time (and was extremely loud as well) Heres a screenshot of how my fan curve is currently set (I messed around with it a bit since playing FF14) http://i1231.photobucket.com/albums/ee510/TheShAnEMeIsTeR/Dwm2011-10-2321-28-43-16.jpg I was hoping maybe someone could help me make adjustments.	St
1.1.2	And if you can, I would be very grateful	St
1.2.1	I tried playing FF14 again, and the top temp it goes is 72C now it seems (sometimes as high as 74 but it drops back down really fast)...	St
1.2.2	So I guess the problem fixed itself, or the adjustments I made to the fan curve earlier were effective	St
