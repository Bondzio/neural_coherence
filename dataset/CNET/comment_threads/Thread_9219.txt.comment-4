Hi Bob Thanks for replying!
What do you think of the durability of Lexmark's laser printers?
I trust HP.
However, the only HP model which fits the bill is the 1020 which unfortunately requires me to plug out the power at the back of the printer to stop the printing.
It's toner is also much expensive.
