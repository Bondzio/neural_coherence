i was wondering if anyone has any information on upgraded hardware (ram, harddrive, video card, etc) is available for an Acer Aspire 3004WLCI, Win XP HE, model number ZL5.
i dont know of anyway to actually find a site that will give you the exact specifications that will be compatible for the upgrade.
so i thought you computer folks could help.
thanks.
