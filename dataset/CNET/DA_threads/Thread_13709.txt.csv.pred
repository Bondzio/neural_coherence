1.1.1	Hi everyone, I'm working on a 7 old dell optiplex.	St
1.1.2	I've got a 40GB HDD that gets recognized by the Windows XP install cd.	St
1.1.3	The XP cd formats and begins install on the drive.	St
1.1.4	The system reboots but the HDD doesn't get seen by the bios.	St
1.1.5	I tried to run SpinRite on the drive, but it doesn't see that either.	St
1.1.6	I've reset the IDE cables.	St
1.1.7	My drive is set to master.	St
1.1.8	I haven't tried hooking it up to another computer yet.	St
1.1.9	That is my next step.	St
1.1.10	Any other ideas or has this 7 yr old dell given up the ghost?	St
1.2.1	The last time I saw a machine that the BIOS didn't see a HDD but Windows did, involved some SCSI controller card.	St
1.2.2	But you wrote IDE.	St
1.2.3	Try the BIOS defaults and another IDE cable and drive.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
