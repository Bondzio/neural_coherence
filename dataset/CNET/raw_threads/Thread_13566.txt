They don't look like Marty Feldman's eyes or anything but they are definitely not flat. No leaking or anything evident and the system seems to work fine, but what I'd like to know is can I just replace them myself and have everything be hunky dory or is there something else I should know? Should I wait for the system to fail should they really be bad or try to head off more serious damage and try to replace them now? The board is far out of warranty.

Remember that the mobo is a four layer printed circuit board and the caps may be connected to an inner circuit layer. So make certain that you have the tools and techniques to handle the job without damaging the surrounding artwork. Also since the Caps were probably bought in a large batch, what's to say that more won't go bad soon. Note that after a class action suit, ABIT has just agreed to replace the bad caps on any of their mobos regardless of age. Try complaining to Soyo.

We used to have solder suckers, vacuum operated with tip temperatures adjusted for the job, which you stuck over the component lead, right on the barrel ( the through plate ), using lots of resin flux. Good techs could get away with copper braid. But too much heat too long will destroy the bond, particularly if the inner layers are connected to the barrel. It can be salvaged by using small magnet wire to jump the broken connection, if you know where it's supposed to go. A map of each layer is a big help. It's also possible to cut the compnent off - not out!!! - and do a surface attach to what's left of the leads. This is an inferior solution mechanically and electrically.

This board was in use for only 2.5 years when the machine started freezing abruptly. I discovered 3 domed capacitors on the board. By far the easiest fix is to simply replace the board. (with another brand) I have also discovered that these older boards are not easy to locate. Newegg has a Tyan Tomcat i815T (Celeron/PIII)that will work for me. Best of Luck

Capacitors on thier own, will with time self destruct because they dry out or are exceeding thier capacity. All componets do degrade over time and since mtrbd. makers provide a decent product but not necessary a high level one when you look at all the makers out there, cheap comes to mind. Some hi-end mtrbds, do quite well but others aren't so, thus they in all probability will have some problem. I exclude the caps of the recent make that are known to be defective about 18mos. or more ago when that problem surfaced. I had caps long before that, that blew-up or bludged then leaked. One or two didn't always cause a breakdown but certainly didn't make things stable. If you experience such, replace as you're capable of. The cost is very low for such caps but the actual job may not be. Since alot of mtrbds. are multi-layered it could be a hassle to unsolder and/or make 100% contact. But most replace easily provided you're careful, its certainly worth the try. But heck, if it ain't broke don't fix it provided it does deliver the goods sorta speak. enjoy -----Willy
