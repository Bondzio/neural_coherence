at the office we use generic names like teac, liteon, sony, lg and more.
we pay from 39 to 99 bucks for the drives and use software such as cdburnerxp or other titles.
it all works and if we do lose a drive (rare, but happens) we replace it and move on.
some want to analyze the makes, models until they find the best solution.
we can't do that so we buy it, install it and start using it.
hope this helps.
