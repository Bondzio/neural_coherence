<s> I received a iMicro MO-5013P today as a replacement mouse. </s>
<s> Sadly, the mouse works perfectly in any other situation besides gaming. </s>
<s> The PS/2 mouse is unresponsive when playing games. </s>
<s> I was just in TF2 when the mouse wheel would act on it's own and then the entire mouse will not respond for thirty seconds after. </s>
<s> Not to mention how it will randomly stop responding mid turn in other games. </s>
<s> I've disabled V-Sync and scaled down on my settings, but nothing works. </s>
<s> It's a iMicro MO-5013P PS/2 mouse. </s>
<s> I was thinking of a driver update, but the iMicro site provides none. </s>
<s> Should I try the Basic Optical Mouse drivers from Microsoft? </s>
<s> Which mouse should I select when the driver installer prompts for one? </s>
<s> Generally; optical mice don't fair well when gaming, they can't keep up with the movements required in games (especially in FPS games). </s>
<s> http://www.wikivs.com/wiki/Laser_Mouse_vs_Optical_Mouse newegg has some decent laser mice...also try looking for wired laser mice, better sensitivity. </s>
