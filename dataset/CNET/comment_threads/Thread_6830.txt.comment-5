I have the problematic external drive plugged into one of two USB ports on the front of the computer, so I decided to plug it into a USB port in the back of the computer after what you said.
It works GREAT now!
Thanks you VERY much!
I really appreciate the simple suggestion that nobody else has offered.
I am currently backing up all the info onto another external drive that I have plugged into the second USB port on the front of the computer.
I am happy that it works now and I was able to avoid having to pay for file recovery, but I am confused as to why one of the two front USB ports is running correctly, and the other isn't.
Shouldn't they be connected?
Any Ideas?
