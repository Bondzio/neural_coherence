1.1.1	Got a general question on HD backups and viruses .	St
1.1.2	I have couple problems : 1 ) Belarc advisor has flagged my old 30GB HD as & quot ; failure & quot ; ( although it still works for now ) 2 ) The old P3 machine where this HD resides is plauged with a bad malware virus ( about : blank / oneclicksearches.com / PSGuard ) .	St
1.1.3	I 've tried cleaning the machine of this horrible virus with multiple apps , but no luck yet .	St
1.1.4	Fortunately I 'm buying a new PC this weekend so I 'm ready to get my critical files ( digital photos & MS docs ) off the old machine and just scrap the beast .	St
1.1.5	I got CD software backups for all my apps on the old PC , so I litterally only want to transfer photos & MS docs to the new machine .	St
1.1.6	Because my HD is on the brink of failure , backing up my critical photos & docs is the primary concern .	St
1.1.7	Ideally , I 'd just network my old machine and new machine and conduct file transfers .	St
1.1.8	However I 'm afraid by doing so I 'll risk transferring viruses & malware to the new machine .	St
1.1.9	I could just burn backup CD 's or buy & use an external USB HD to backup my photos & docs , but again I 'm not sure if some of these viruses & adwares will 'stow away ' on the CD 's or ext .	St
1.1.10	HD , and eventually infect my brand new machine .	St
1.1.11	Any advice would be appreciated !	Polite
1.1.12	!	St
1.2.1	Funseeker , If you have n't done so , run McAfee 's free virus scan or Trend Micro 's virus scan .	St
1.2.2	If your machine comes back clean of viruses then you should be able to move your files to new drive OK .	St
1.2.3	If not , buy the software that found the virus and clean it up .	St
1.2.4	Then copy your files .	St
1.2.5	Viruses generally do not attach themselves to photo files and other data files .	St
1.2.6	They are typically .exe or some other type of call executable .	St
1.2.7	You get infested by email or the virus might be on a CD or diskette that is not a original manufacturers media .	St
1.2.8	Using an external HD ( IMO ) as backup is best as long as you keep it disconnected when not in use .	St
1.2.9	As far as asware/spyware goes check CNET 's review of this software .	St
1.2.10	They have n't been wrong yet .	St
1.2.11	And life goes on ... Jack	St
1.3.1	To make life easier , how about first clean up the old computer ?	Ques
1.3.2	You said that you tried to clean it , but i think you should use a more extreme method : 1. download Spybot , Adaware , Microsoft Anti-spyware beta , SpySubtract ( including CWShredder ) , and use them to do FULL-SYSTEM scan .	Sug
1.3.3	2. get HijackThis 3. scan a HijackThis log and post it on Aumha forums ( http : //forum.aumha.org/viewforum.php ? f=30 ) 4. wait for reply .	Ques
1.3.4	5. then follow the replies to clean out your computer .	St
1.3.5	( usually will have a lot of steps , but you have to follow them word by word , or the malicious stuff wo n't go .	St
1.3.6	recommended : after following the reply 's directions , do another full system scan in Safe Mode . )	St
1.3.7	hope this helps	St
1.4.1	Thanks , I 've actually spent the past 3 evenings ( til the wee hours ) trying to eradicate this crap off the old machine .	St
1.4.2	I had already started using hijack and several of the other tools before posting here .	St
1.4.3	I 've been following along dozens of forums and tooling the net for strategies on how to clean this PC .	St
1.4.4	Last night I thought I took care of it , but now programs are running slow and scans are coming up with some junk again .	St
1.4.5	I 've got a bad variant of the Smitfraud.B virus - lookout for this one , it 's bad ! !	St
1.4.6	Fortunately my ailing HD has weathered through all this so far .	St
1.4.7	I plan on connecting a secondary HD to the machine to drag off all my data as soon as the machine starts running right again .	St
1.5.1	that could work .	St
1.5.2	but it will still be the best not to copy the whole HD .	St
