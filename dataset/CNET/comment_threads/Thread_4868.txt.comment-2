At just 2 years with many not doing the yearly cleaning (read http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-11319_7-6240575-1.html ) plus BAD CAPS (google that) about half the time I find it's not drivers or pop ups.
Good sleuthing on the drivers but here's the deal.
Windows 7 is better than the prior versions on drivers but far from done.
Try the usual.
Remove the case cover and point a fan at it.
The reason you make me think it is heat related is the 2 hours.
