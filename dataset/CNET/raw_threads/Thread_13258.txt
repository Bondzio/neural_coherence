I opened it up a and removed its hd(Toshiba MK1516GAP 15GB ATA-2/3/4 2.5&quot; 9.5mm Notebook Hard Drive) and placed it into an external portable case USB. I then connected it to my PC via the USB port and formatted the disk. I find that anytime i try to write to it i keep getting this message Windows - Delayed Write Failure ------------------------------ Windows was unable to save all the data for file G:,The data has been lost. This error may be caused by a failure of your computer hardware or network connection. Please try to save the file elsewhere. ------------------------------- After this error the device (external hard drive) is automatically unplugged by windows from the system. what is the problem here ? i'll be very grateful for any help.
