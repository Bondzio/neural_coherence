I have two 640GB hard drives that I have put into RAID configuration, with 200 GB worth of mirrored RAID1 space and approx. 800GB of striped RAID0 space. I am a little confused about the best way to allocate my programs and my system onto my space. I have an awful lot of large files to copy over and create(i do a lot of graphic design) and music and pictures, hence the 200GB of RAID1. I have also put windows vista x64 on the RAID1, as i don't want to go through the headaches of reinstallation if something goes wrong, and set the RAID1 part as the primary boot partition. I plan on putting the rest of my programs (adobe suite, autoCAD, assorted games) on the RAID0, along with general non-backup needed files. Am i taking full advantage of the RAID array I've created? should I put the OS on the RAID0 partition? currently EVERYTHING is set up ono the RAID1 part, as i've just set the thing up and installed windows. if i should change something, i have no problem reinstalling things or reformatting my system now when it is squeaky clean. also - i am a new vista user and kind of a newbie in general - doing a bit of learning by doing. if you advise doing something with the page file or crash dump or anything like that, please either explain or send a helpful link. thanks for the help matt
