I have a custom build computer (P4 1.8) which i had been using for quite a long time, a week ago, i accidentally hit the top of my PC tower and the screen freezes and then suddenly blacks out.
After a few hours, it can switch on again but after some time, the same thing happens I thought that it was the mainboard problem, so i bought a new one but it did not work out, so i tested the power supply and it turned out OK, but the problem persists.
I think that maybe the black 'thing' between the cpu heatsink/fan and the cpu is causing the problem.
I suspect that it maybe a overheating problem.
im quite unsure of what is really wrong with my com, can anyone help?
?
