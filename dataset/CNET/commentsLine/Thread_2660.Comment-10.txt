good day, i returned my pny 7600 gs back to the store but i'm looking to try another brand.
to answer your question on the card temp...the pny or nivida has a graphics card manager that has a tab for the temp.
when i checked the temp and it was around 83c/186f i became concerned and shot alot of questions to this forum that helped.
i hope i helped.
