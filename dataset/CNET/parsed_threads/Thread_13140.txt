<s> Yes, another user that can't print wirelessly! </s>
<s> My Canon MP530 is connected via USB to a desktop PC running XP Pro. </s>
<s> The printer is set to share, which is confirmed by Network Magic. </s>
<s> My laptop, also XP Pro, connects wirelessly to a 2Wire modem. </s>
<s> The Canon printer is shown as shared on the Laptop. </s>
<s> The Network Magic troubleshooter reports that &quot;This printer is available for printing from this computer.&quot; Here's what happens when I try to print from WordPad: I get the Print dialog box showing the Canon MP530. </s>
<s> But when I click Print, nothing happens. </s>
<s> Same with Print Preview in WordPad. </s>
<s> Notepad isn't much better. </s>
<s> In that case I get &quot;The handle is invalid.&quot; A test print using the Printers and Faxes folder yields &quot;Test page failed to print.&quot; The Printer Properties PORTS tab shows Canon MP530 on Port USB001, described as &quot;Virtual printer port for USB.&quot; If I click on Configure Port, I get &quot;An error occurred during port configuration. </s>
<s> The operation is not supported.&quot; Here are some of the things that I have already tried: - Deleting and re-entering the share doesn't help. </s>
<s> - Windows Firewall off on both machines - no difference - Anti-Virus off on both machines - no difference Any suggestions appreciated! </s>
<s> I'm assuming that you can print from the desktop. </s>
<s> Are the computers in the same workgroup? </s>
<s> File & Print Sharing added to both the computers? </s>
<s> Also check to see how many documents are in queue on the desktop computer. </s>
<s> Many thanks for the reponses, Queue and Test. </s>
<s> Yes I can print form the desktop. </s>
<s> Both machines are in the same workgroup. </s>
<s> Indeed, I can access shared folders without any problem. </s>
<s> Yes, Fle and Print sharing was added on both computers. </s>
<s> There are 0 documents in the queue on the desktop computer. </s>
<s> Try adding the network printer again from the laptop's control panel, printer. </s>
<s> See if it prints out a test page. </s>

<s> philbernie, many thanks for the suggestions. </s>
<s> The article at http://www.computing.net/answers/windows-xp/test-page-failed-to-print/170571.html gave real hope because the situation described there matches mine: My Desktop *is* running XP SP2 and my laptop *is* running XP SP3. </s>
<s> So as suggested in the reference: I deleted the drivers on both machines, downloaded the latest driver from Canon and re-installed on the Desktop. </s>
<s> Then I set up the share. </s>
<s> Still doesn't print. </s>
<s> Sigh. </s>
<s> One User in the reference suggested that it could be &quot;a user permission problem.&quot; In my case I'm the admin on both desktop and laptop, so presumably this would eliminate that problem. </s>
<s> If not I confess that I don't know how to change the permissions on a printer. </s>
<s> You also suggested &quot;Try adding the network printer again from the laptop's control panel, printer.&quot; I went to Control Panel/Printers and Faxes and picked &quot;Add a Printer.&quot; Unfortunately I got the dreaded &quot;Test page failed to print.&quot; On the bright side I can display the ink cartridge levels on the printer, so the laptop *is* talking to the printer (&quot;bidirectional support&quot;). </s>
<s> It's talking, but just not printing! </s>
<s> Any other ideas appreciated. </s>
<s> I seem to read problems with 2wire as a modem/router. </s>
<s> Is that a combinations of modem/router? </s>
<s> Get a hold of a router someplace other than 3Wire. </s>
<s> It does NOT have to be connected to a modem on the WAN side. </s>
<s> Take down software firewall and antivirus like you've done before. </s>
<s> See if the different router works. </s>
<s> Resolved! </s>
<s> ALthough both PCs are running XP Pro, I used a technique that Vista folks have been using. </s>
<s> It's counterintuitive, but of course this is Windows. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> On the laptop, select: Control Panel/ Printers /Add Printer 2. </s>
<s> Choose Add Local Printer. </s>
<s> (Yes Local, NOT Network.) </s>
<s> Uncheck the box marked &quot;Automatically detect my PnP printer. </s>
<s> Click Next 3. </s>
<s> Select Create a New Port and leave the default in the drop down selection as Local Port. </s>
<s> Click Next 4. </s>
<s> Windows displays a small dialogue box asking a port name. </s>
<s> Key in \\Host name\printer name Host name - is the name of the desktop eg User-judf5564 or Home etc. </s>
<s> Printer Name - is MP530 or OffcPrnt, etc. </s>
<s> Click OK 5. </s>
<s> Windows will show a list of printer vendors and models. </s>
<s> The list looks just like the Windows Add Hardware Dialog. </s>
<s> Select your printer manufacturer and printer model from the list. </s>
<s> My particular model wasn't shown so I clicked on Windows Update. </s>
<s> After an interminable wait the list of models was updated. </s>
<s> I chose the closest match and will update the driver later. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> When offered, indicate that you want a test print. </s>
<s> Hopefully this will help someone else so they don't have to go through all the iterations that I tried. </s>
<s> Many thanks to Test, Queue and Philbernie. </s>
<s> You were persistent and it turned out well for you. </s>
<s> Pat yourself on the back </s>
<s> Just wanted to say thank you for posting this fix. </s>
<s> I have been running in circles for the exact same problem. </s>
<s> Good T/S. </s>
<s> Keep it up. </s>
<s> I followed the directions to a &quot;T&quot; and it worked out perfect. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> Thank you for resolving this, Concordal et al. </s>
<s> Hours of trying to get my Windows 7 64 bit laptop to print to an ancient XP Pro shared HP Laserjet printer on wired network at work, and then came across these concise instructions. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> Hi, I have been experiencing the same problem of printing from my Laptop over a wireless network to a HP LaserJet 1020 which is attached to my Desktop computer. </s>
<s> The main difference is that in my case, both computers have been upgraded to Windows 7. </s>
<s> I tried the solution with a couple of twists from their XP to my Windows 7. </s>
<s> When I tried to print, I can see the document via the 'See Whats Printing' go to the Printer, it Spools then Prints, but doesn't. </s>
<s> Meanwhile on the Desktop computer in the 'See Whats Printing' box for the attached LaserJet, the Document Name shows as 'Remote Downlevel Document' Status - 'Printing' but again nothing prints. </s>
<s> This has caused a great deal of frustration. </s>
<s> I have been searching for answers for days. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> I share 2 printers on my desktop. </s>
<s> I was able to print to both from my laptop, but recently lost the laser printer. </s>
<s> I followed your instructions and successfully restored the lost printer. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I had exactly the same problem. </s>
<s> I tried the suggested solution and it got better --- no more error message. </s>
<s> However the documents sit in the queue and nothing gets printed. </s>
<s> The XP desktop is connected to the home network wirelessly. </s>
<s> Is this problem more related to the wireless connection? </s>
<s> Or is it more related to the fact that I am having an XP and Windows 7 combination? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> YES! </s>
<s> I tried this approach, and it works just as described! </s>
<s> I have Windows 7 (64 bit), and want to connect to a shared HP LaserJet P2015d on a Windows XP (32 bit), and had a hard time even to talk to the right people in HP. </s>
<s> I am not sure the approach described here will work, but I tried anyway. </s>
<s> It works! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> Hi Fishing guy, I really hope you are still around...I am having this exact same problem. </s>
<s> Using two systems (1) 64bit windows 7 desktop (sharing the printer) and (1) laptop 32bit windows 7. </s>
<s> Exact same printer as you and exact same issues! </s>
<s> Did you find a fix? </s>
<s> It is driving me crazy and I just cannot let it beat me. </s>
<s> I was able to share the printer fine before I updgraded my laptop to from vista to win 7. </s>
<s> PLEASE help! </s>
<s> Your post is the fis=rst I have seen with my exact same issue. </s>
<s> Most are from 7 to XP not 7 to 7. </s>
<s> Any help is greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> Thanks so much- we spent so much time trying to get our printers on a network and failed. </s>
<s> This information was exactly what we needed! </s>
<s> A really big bump to the thanks for this post. </s>
<s> This issue has been bugging me for over a year! </s>
<s> I have 2 desktops that are in the same room, but on opposite ends. </s>
<s> I got the file sharing to work so I could always put something in shared documents and print from the pc connected to the printer, but I always wondered why I couldn't get both computers to print. </s>
<s> Now if I can just figure out this Google Cloud stuff... </s>
<s> Thank you posting this fix. </s>
<s> I got a new desktop computer and couldn't get my laptop to print using the printer attached to it. </s>
<s> It was the same printer that I had no program using before. </s>
<s> This worked. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
