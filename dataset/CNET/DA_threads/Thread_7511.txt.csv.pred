1.1.1	Hi everyone, I have just got an archos 80 cobalt tablet (cheap!).	St
1.1.2	I'm going to take it abroad on holiday.	St
1.1.3	I can turn the wifi off, but will it charge me for data roaming?	St
1.1.4	I'm not sure it's even got it!	Res
1.1.5	How do I make sure it's all off?	St
1.1.6	Thank you!	St

1.2.1	http://www.archos.com/products/elements/archos_80cobalt/?country=gb&lang=en I see WiFi but no way can this run up a data bill on its own.	St
1.2.2	That is, it has no cellular connection so I'd leave the WiFi on.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thank you that's great!	St
