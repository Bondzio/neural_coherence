I use OEM (a.k.a.
&quot;White Box&quot;) parts.
For those of you who don't already know--white box parts are what large producers use.
They usually come without any cables or manuals, and have a 3 month guarantee at best.
For me, the prices are great--so I don't really mind scrounging up a few cables and downloading the necessary info/software from the web.
I get my stuff from what you might call &quot;warehouse stores&quot;...although I think &quot;garage stores&quot; might give you a better idea of what they actually look like.
I get sales/price info from local &quot;computer rags&quot; and off the web.
JDM (*OEM parts are nicknamed &quot;white box&quot; parts because they usually come in plain white boxes.)
(**OEM stands for &quot;Original Equipment Maker/Manufacturer&quot;--if anyone really wanted to know.)
