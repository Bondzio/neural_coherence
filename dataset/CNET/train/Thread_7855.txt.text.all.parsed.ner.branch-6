(sp3) i can use the m/c for a long time if i am just accessing the internet and doing email. problem usually occurs pretty quickly when i use an application like access or powerpoint. i have removed the battery and left just the plug in. same issue with battery removed. i have re-installed the operating system, same issue after new o/s installed. i have replaced the hard disk. i would like some opinion as to what would be the next (easiest, cheapest) step. replace ?? 1. memory; 2 power supply; 3 mother board; 4.display; 5 laptop;...(yeah i know..the last one...) any help would be appreciated. thanks
