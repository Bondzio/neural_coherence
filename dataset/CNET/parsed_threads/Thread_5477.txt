<s> In my home, we have a router with 3 computers connected: One desktop, plugged into the router One laptop, connected wirelessly Another desktop, connected wirelessly The second desktop lost Internet access on Friday, although it still connects with the router. </s>

<s> Some other things to try: - check the wireless switch or the program to enable/disable wireless; those are the things you use in an airplane to switch it off). </s>
<s> To confirm that it's hardware, boot from a Ubuntu Live disk and see if that works - a public hotspot or with a friend - remove the connection and let Windows detect it again (you'll have to re-enter the password) Kees </s>
<s> Thanks for your response, Kees. </s>
<s> I'm not quite sure how to do what you suggested. </s>
<s> I have gone through the Network and Sharing Center on the problem desktop to disconnect it from the wireless connection and reconnect it, several times. </s>
<s> Also, the computer connects to the router automatically every time I restart the computer. </s>
<s> I'm not sure how to get the problem computer to &quot;forget&quot; the router password, but I tried changing the password it uses to connect, at which point it failed to connect to the router. </s>
<s> Then I changed it back to the correct password, and it connected to the router again, but still no Internet access. </s>
<s> There is no wireless switch on the desktop, the computer runs on Windows Vista (not Ubuntu), and I can't take it to a public hotspot, but I'll see if I can find a system restore point. </s>
<s> If that works, I'll post an update. </s>
<s> If there are any other suggested solutions, please let me know! </s>
<s> It connects automatically, because it's a defined connection. </s>
<s> If you remove it totally (like you do with the different connections your laptop found during its life on all places it ever was) you'll have to redefine it. </s>
<s> Won't harm and might help. </s>
<s> Although changing the password should have the same effect. </s>
<s> Still, it was clear from your ipconfig output, that the DHCP didn't work. </s>
<s> So it's only a partial connection you now have. </s>
<s> If you hover your mouse over the wireless connection symbol on right side of the taskbar, you most likely see something about 'limited or no connectivity'. </s>
<s> That's a well known problem ( https://www.google.com/search?q=limited+or+no+connectivity+vista ). </s>
<s> A bad password is one of possible causes. </s>
<s> You can run any computer on Ubuntu, by just booting from a disk you burn yourself. </s>
<s> It's totally independent on whatever it runs when booting from disk (such as Windows Vista). </s>
<s> But if it connects (albeit limited) I suspect some software or setting issue, not the hardware. </s>
<s> If system restore doesn't work, and none of 'solutions' you find, a sure solution (although it takes some time) is a clean install of Windows Vista, back to factory settings. </s>

<s> Thanks, Kees, I did a system restore to 5 days ago, and the Internet access was working again! </s>
<s> I never figured out how to totally remove a network connection, but it looks like it's a moot point now. </s>
<s> As for what caused the problem, I don't know if it was McAfee; I'd read that a recent McAfee update caused people to lose Internet access. </s>
<s> To be safe, I installed AVG on the problem desktop and uninstalled McAfee. </s>
<s> Who would have thought that after all the connection settings I changed and commands I entered, something as simple as System Restore would solve the problem? </s>
<s> That's a lesson I won't soon forget! </s>
<s> Windows often is a mystery. </s>
