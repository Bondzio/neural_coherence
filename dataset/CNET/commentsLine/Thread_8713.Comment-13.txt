i used to have huge bunnies until i did a major upgrade to my pc.
besides all the hardware i added, i needed extra fans to keep it cool.
i now have 6 fans total (3 intake, 3 exhaust) and all intakes have filters.
my computer sits 12&quot; off the floor in a &quot;rack.&quot; the fans are all controllable with 4 temp monitors inside the case.
when i change the filters, the inside of the pc gets a cleaning.
i find very little dust.
