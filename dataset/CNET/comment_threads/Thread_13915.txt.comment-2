anything you want to put on them..not just movies.
Might also consider going to 120GB...they're almost same price as then 80GB and they're under the size limit where almost any OS would recognize the full capacity (see 48bitlba.com).
Check over at Newegg.com ..they've got a wide selection of HDDs and and DVD burner's.
