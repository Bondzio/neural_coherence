i bought a kick ass top of the line computer from dell last year, and it was loaded with a bunch of crap that was conflicting with photoshop, and some of the other imaging software that i use.
i called dell, and for 20 bucks they sent me 2 restore discs.
one has xp on it, and the other has device drivers on it.
i was able to just have a clean install of windows and put only that software that i need to use.
