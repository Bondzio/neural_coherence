Hi, I want to buy a external hard drive, but I have 1 question I am buying the external hard drive for the gameplay video's I make. I use a notebook, and a notebook doesn't have a big hard drive. So i want to save the movies directly on my external hard drive. For a fast transfer I will buy a external hard drive with USB 3.0 Now i want to know if more RPM makes a faster transfer from PC to external hard drive? Makes 7200 RPM a faster transfer then 5400 RPM? Greetings, Noobie ^^

Experience has proven that external hard disks are quite unreliable and error prone. Too many members here thought they could be used as storage, forgot about a backup (a copy on one or two other media) and lost everything. So better buy 2 disks and copy to both. Three would be even better, especially if you keep the third one on a safe place outside of your home or office (or where-ever those 3 other disks are). Kees

You'll be better off using a desktop and having an int. HD that accessing a 10,000RPM HD. That would be better but again, that's a hard major investment. Under your circumstances, you might be better served having a NAS setup, not only for work but immediate storage and minor back-up. You may want to look into SSD setups as well, speed here is greater overall but that's only an idea I'll throw out there. Back-up should be an important consideration on top of any initial movie storage. tada -----Willy

IF however a firewire or ESATA drive were used, there should be an increase in transfer rate, but the notebook would have to have the hook ups.
