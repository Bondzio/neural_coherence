i never trust ecs, jetway, epox, mach speed , pcchips etc mobos these mobos have no nice tech support and can't be used more than 2-3years because of the weak capicator.
these mobo are expensive but really good even good at overclocking 1-evga 680i (16x16) 2-asus p5n32-sli (16x16) 3-asus p5n-sli (8x8) better choose a mobo which works sli in 16x mode.
there are many other mobos in sli
