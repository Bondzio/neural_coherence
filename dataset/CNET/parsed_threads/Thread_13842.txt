<s> oh wow this is annoying. </s>
<s> i bought a linksys wireless N PCI card, and i had two problems, one was resolved in another thread about using WPA encryption, and the other is I had a stuttering problem which didn't exist on the wireless-G usb by linksys. </s>
<s> so i decided to try a D-Link wireless-N usb adapter to replace the PCI one, thinking the PCI was causing interference with my PCI soundcard. </s>
<s> well, it stutters alright, but another check back on the wireless-G usb card shows no stuttering. </s>
<s> any ideas? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> tried that, thank you for the suggestion though. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> but isn't this an adapter problem? </s>
<s> the wireless-G adapter had no stutter issues. </s>
<s> my router is WRT300N v1.1 with firmware 1.51.2 and linksys is offering 1.03.3 for WRT300N v1.0 on their downloads page which is weird. </s>
<s> I've had the same annoying stutter since I installed the N card and router. </s>
<s> I tried a couple of things I read on other threads, but nothing fixed it - it would stutter at least 2 or 3 times in a matter of 3 or 4 minutes. </s>
<s> I just tried something new and It hasn't stuttered for 10 minutes - I'm hoping this fixed it. </s>
<s> Go into your router's control panel and open the Wireless Settings tab - in the Basic Settings panel, make the following changes: Radio Band: Standard 20 MHZ Channel Standard Channel: 11 - 2.462GHZ Then, re-establish your connection. </s>
<s> I've just listened to over half a CD and still no stutter. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Earl </s>
<s> hey earl, thanks for the response. </s>
<s> unfortunately that's not good enough for me cause i work as a composer, so having a wireless system that causes any stuttering is really bad. </s>
<s> for the time being i'm still on my G adapter and just hoping that the N router has been helping with the connection however it can. </s>
<s> maybe not by being N but being more up-to-date maybe it has better range. </s>
<s> then for those moments when i'm really stuck with say an FTP upload i use my cheap D-Link N adapter. </s>
<s> this is not ideal though but hey better than drilling holes in my house for wiring. </s>
<s> The Linksys WRT300N was one of Linksys' first configurations in the Wireless-N format. </s>
<s> All reviews by CNET, PC Mag and other reputable sources gave it a less than stellar rating going back to June, 2006. </s>
<s> User opinions were worse. </s>
<s> If your devices are all 802.11 b/g then a wireless-N router is going to afford you little to no improvement. </s>
<s> 802.11- b/g devices are intended to operate in the 2.4Ghz band and not the 5Ghz band of 802.11-n. Granted WPA security is better than WEP. </s>
<s> However, to gain the maximum through-put in a 802.11-n environment you need to use WPA2 security. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, most 802.11 b/g devices prefer WPA. </s>
<s> If you want 802.11-n and 802.11 b/g connectivity there's only one best choice - the Linksys WRT600N router which has dual band capability for 2.4GHz (802.11-b/g) and 5GHz (802.11-n). </s>
<s> Also, it is the only router on the market, at this time, that will allow operation of both bands at the same time. </s>
<s> It has also received an excellent review by PCWorld Mag. </s>
<s> The only negative is that it's expensive at $150-$200 plus and extra $100 for a WUSB600N (USB) adapter that supports both bands. </s>
<s> So, not knowing what devices you are trying to connect (meaning their internal configurations and how old they are) you may want to consider the WRT600N. </s>
<s> FYI, I own a Linksys WRT600N. </s>
<s> I didn't need the WUSB600N adapter as my laptop is wirelss 802.11-a/b/g/n capable. </s>
<s> Good Luck! </s>
