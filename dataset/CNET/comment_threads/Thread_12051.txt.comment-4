I should probably mention that just because a computer came from Dell or Gateway or whoever that doesn't mean it's mainboard was manufactured by them.
In fact I don't think any major computer retailer makes their own mainboards.
They usually buy them in bulk from companies such as gigabyte or soyo.
Most decent mainboards will be marked with a manufaturer name and model number or FCC-ID.
I have run across a few mainboards without any identifying marks at all, not even an FCC-ID.
In this case you'll have to contact the system builder to ask them for specs on the mainboard.
