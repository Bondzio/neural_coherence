That here we have windows installed and the boot drive is marked removable as it's in the tray.
I've seen this often with XP, SATA connected drives and Windows installs just fine.
Vista seems to understand SATA much better and will not mark the boot drive as removable.
After a few hundred installs you just gotta wonder what is immutable and what is not.
