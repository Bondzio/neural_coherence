hi guys, at first, i'm new to this forum so excuse me if i put this discussion in the wrong area first the story: i bought a netgear wn3000rp extender for better wifi range, because on my room upstairs i have no signal at all (so called dead spots) so, i installed it a few months ago and all was working fine, untill we had to leave the house for vancation.
someone in the house pulled the extender out of the electric outlet.
a few weeks later we pulled it back in it, but here started the problem: i installed the extender again, but now without any succes.
(just incase you want take a look:  ) there are 4 led lights attached to this extender.
3 of them are lighting, but the 4th won't light at all.
led's:  i did the exact same procedures as exampled in the installation manual, but nothing worked.
i always got this error on the end of the unsuccesful installation: move the extender closer to the existing router or gateway.
im really sure the extender is in the range of my actual router!
i've tried everything from restoring to factory defaults to wps, dps, disabling security, nothing works.. i always get stuck on the error.
(with wps i press both the buttons on the extender and the router, but they cant find each other.)
i hope someone can help me.
thanks!
