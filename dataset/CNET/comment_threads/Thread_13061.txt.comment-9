It looks like to me either this CPU number 519 is no longer in production right now or is a special cpu made just for Emachines with a lower FSB.
It seems as all the socket LGA775 are 800fsb when mine is only 533MHz.
And the lowest CPU number I can see is 520.
Looks like I'll need a new CPU,motherboard, and ram by 2006.
