Thanks Steven.
Correct link.
I have the same board.
D/l technical manual from intel site as well.
No luck.
Currently using XP.
Have tried with 95/98/2000 Adv Server SP4 as well.
No luck.
So if the mb doesn't have it, OS won't add it.
Gotta get a PCI-USB card/FireWire cable.
Oh btw, are RDRAMs still in production :-?
