That thing is from 2001.
Wally-mart...400 bucks....10x the machine.
If the user insist on keeping the machine.
Consider a ram upgrade.
Waste of money in my opinion...but it might make the user happy.
HP says that machine comes with 128MB of ram with a max of 768MB.
If the user is running w98 bump the ram to 256.
If the user is running XP bump the ram to the max.
