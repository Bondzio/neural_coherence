and I read that it is pointless now since no game out there takes advantage of &quot;true dual x16 slots&quot;.
Dual x8 slots are fine now and provide excellent SLI performance at the highest resolutions.
I also realized that the 32 delux does not come with onboard firewire, which IMO sucks.
I know that you lose PCI slots when doing SLI, but the 32 delux is too expensive, you only have one PCI slot after SLI, and I am reading reviews that it is way too buggy right now.
