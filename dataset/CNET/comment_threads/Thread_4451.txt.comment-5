Hi Confed, I am a printer engineer, and think that your office kit needs calibrating... the output is usually pretty good.
I don't like Canon Inkjets, partly because if there is a quality problem and you remove the ink cartridge, it can take up to 10 cleaning cycles (with the wastage that entails) to get it to print again.
I much prefer HP or Lexmark.
Bear in mind that due to the nature of my job I only see the problem kit, and I see far more Canons...
