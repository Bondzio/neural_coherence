1.1.1	i have an old external LaCie CD-RW that i no longer use.	St
1.1.2	So I decided to trash the burner and use the enclosure to make a new 500GB external HDD.	St
1.1.3	I swaped the ide burner for a Seagate Baracuda 500Gb ide hdd and made sure that its jumper was set to master.	St
1.1.4	Then i pluged it into my toshiba notebook running xp pro media edition.	St
1.1.5	using the Disk Management utility in Administrative Tools, the new 500GB drive is visible but the device is still recognised as a cd-rw.	St
1.1.6	I can't format the drive or manage to load it as a hard drive.	St
1.1.7	Windows automatically loads a cd device driver and i can't seem to get arround it.	St
1.1.8	does anyone have a solution to this problem, i'd rather not have to buy a new enclosure.	Ques
1.2.1	http://www.seagate.com/ww/v/index.jsp?locale=en-US&name=maxblast-eula&vgnextoid=65af7bb4d9391110VgnVCM100000f5ee0a0aRCRD It should work with Seagate because they bought Maxtor.	St
1.2.2	Good luck.	St
1.3.1	How about some specs first, like OS, service pack, etc... Paul	St
1.4.1	But has that computer seen this external box as when it was containing the CD drive?	St
1.4.2	It could be the OS is assuming it is the same as it was when it was connected before.	St
1.4.3	Check the Device Manager under &quot;DVD/CD-ROM drives&quot; when it is connected.	St
1.4.4	If it shows up there as a CD, delete it by right clicking on the drive and then let Windows reinstall it.	St
1.4.5	If that does not work, try a different computer.	St
1.4.6	Another thought would be try a Linux live CD.	St
1.4.7	Boot from that to see what that OS does with it.	St
1.4.8	If that still shows as a CD drive, then the external box must have an identifier built into the front end.	St
1.4.9	In that case, a different box will be needed.	St
