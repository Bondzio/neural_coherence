1.1.2	Everything else on my system produces sound.	St

1.2.1	If you have other cd drives that work properly, and if you have a pci sound card, did you connect an audio cable from the back of the drive to the sound card?	St
1.3.1	My other drives are working properly.	St
1.3.2	I connected a power cable, and the IDE Ribbon cable to the DVD drive.	St
1.3.3	If I recall correctly, this system has &quot;Integrated&quot; sound - which I thought was built into the MoBo.	St
1.3.4	Here is the system info.	St
1.3.5	for the sound.	St

1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	Do you have more than one?	St
1.6.2	You say audio CDs play fine.	St
1.6.3	On THIS drive?	St
1.6.4	Most MOBOs only accept sound from 1 drive, even when having 2 plugs.	St
1.6.5	These are for different types of plugs, not both at once (I fell for that one, way back when).	St
1.6.6	Good luck.	St
1.6.7	chuck	St
1.7.1	Yes - this new DVD drive plays audio disks fine.	St
1.7.2	But when I pop in a movie disk, great video but no sound.	St
1.7.3	I have made sure that the mute button on the player is unchecked, and I can't find any other settings that might be causing this.	St
1.8.1	It could be the lack of some codec that's required for the dvd.	St
1.8.2	You can download and install the Nimo Codec Pack here: http://nimo.titanesk.com/modules/freecontent/index.php?id=1	St
1.9.1	Double-click on the volume icon next to your clock.	St
1.9.2	This will bring up a whole bunch of volume settings.	St
1.9.3	Make sure the &quot;Wave&quot; sound source Mute box is UNCHECKED and its volume is up.	Res
1.9.4	(If there is no Volume icon next to your clock, go to the &quot;Sounds and Audio Devices&quot; control panel, click on the &quot;Volume&quot; tab, and and click &quot;Advanced&quot;.)	St
1.9.5	To make it simple, you might want to UNCHECK all Mute boxes and turn up all volumes, to cover all sources.	St
1.9.6	Also, if you installed a retail version of a DVD drive, there should be a port for a 3 or 4 pin audio cable in the back of the drive.	St
1.9.7	The other end of the sound cable plugs into the motherboard (if you have motherboard integrated sound) or into your sound card (if you have a PCI sound card).	St
1.10.1	After downloading an audio codec pack, I now have sound with the movies.	St
1.10.2	The volume seems low but it works.	St
1.10.3	Thanks for your help.	Polite
1.11.1	Glad to hear it's working.	St
1.11.2	Check the volume level in control panel/sound and audio devices.	St
1.12.1	I have a similar problem with a new i/o magic DVD RW 16x.	St
1.12.2	OS Win2K.	St
1.12.3	(no audio connector required).	St
1.12.4	I also have an old DVD-ROM in the system (with same problems) It plays audio cd's, mp3s, and even a DVD created with the packaged nero6.	St
1.12.5	So, when I put in a commercial DVD... NO AUDIO.	St
1.12.6	I got one pop up about Dolby decoders, but unable to find a reference to this online.	St
1.12.7	Any help is appreciated.	St
