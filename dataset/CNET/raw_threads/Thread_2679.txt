I played with the different speeds and eventually found some settings that let all my computers talk to each other. Double-click on the network-connected icon in your taskbar, then Properties. Before you click Configure, just see if both your computers have the same things under 'This connection uses the following items'. It's not important that they do, but the experts say that they should. Best, Jack
