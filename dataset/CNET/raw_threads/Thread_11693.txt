As to expensive, the cost for the OS is the same when that day comes and as to other applications, we'll see. Already, Open Office has started to dislodge that other office. Cost?

Prices should be getting 'right' this coming Spring. I'm going to wait to see what MS has to offer with the 64 XP before making the plunge, but in any case, plunge I will ere another year has passed.

I have already put aside any idea of upgrading any machines that we don't have to in anticipation of the changeover. I already see the price plummeting over the past month and XP-64 may not be what we'll be installing for these workstations. In the case of the next setups, it's Open Office and some development work in C++. Since it will run Windows 2000, we can do that with a dual boot to some Linux-64. Bob
