1.1.1	ok So i had to delete some kernal/stuff out of the library and cache and then restart but the sata came up...so got that under control but... my g4 was originally an agp graphics model, which has been upgraded to a 1ghz processor w/ 1gb ram.	St
1.1.2	The bus is an ata 66 probobly and i am finally having to replace the old system drive desktard i had attatched to it.	St
1.1.3	I have a pci card w/ sata 2 channel that i have one sata 80 gb drive that i record my audio to.	St
1.1.4	(i use my comp for music production only)I know that the ata bus is limiting but how fast is the pci in comparison?	St
1.1.5	(my sata is 1.5 which by itself is way faster than ata 66 but what about the pci bus itself?	St
1.1.6	is there a bottleneck going on therer?	St
1.1.7	i think its 100mhz.	St
1.1.8	Should i just forget about my ata and work off of the pci/sata?	St
1.1.9	or, since it is only my system drive and not really audio intensive should i save a little money and stick with an ata drive?	St
1.1.10	thanks c	Polite
1.2.1	Your G4 is still an AGP graphics G4.	St
1.2.2	The designation refers more to the logicboard layout rather than the processor speed.	St
1.2.3	My AGP Graphics runs Dual 1.25Ghz processors but is still restrained by the limitation of the AGP Graphics board.	St
1.2.4	I would continue on with the SATA PCI card, I don't think there is actually a bottleneck worth talking about.	St
1.2.5	The ATA bus is 66, as you said.	St
1.2.6	All earlier G4's suffered from an LBA deficiency, 28bit, which limits the size of the ATA drives to 137GB.	St
1.2.7	The use of a PCI card, IDE or SATA, will usually bypass this limitation as the majority of new cards will almost certainly be 48bitLBA.	St
1.2.8	As for saving money, SATA drives are dropping in price and are good value.	St
1.2.9	You could use the IDE bus for a system drive and still use the SATA's for audio work P	St
