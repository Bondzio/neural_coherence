santa brought a new dvd drive for christmas.
he got a oem from newegg.
all that came was the drive and that was all.
santa's helper (me) installed it.
it must need drivers because it will not play a dvd movie.
the drive is a ''nec dvd_rw nd-3550a.
i went on google to look for nec but didn't find what i was looking for.
please help!
!
