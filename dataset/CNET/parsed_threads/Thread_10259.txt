<s> I hope someone can help me. </s>
<s> I have purchased two flash drives from different companies and downloaded the Windows 98SE drivers from their websites, but my computer still won't recognize them. </s>
<s> The first one just wouldn't install and the second one caused my computer to have the blue screen of death. </s>
<s> These companies say that the flash drives work with Windows 98SE, but it's not working for me. </s>
<s> Can anyone tell me what the problem might be? </s>
<s> Is this a common occurance? </s>
<s> Short of transfering files on a floppy (because I don't have a CD burner), is there anything else that I can use to transfer files from my Windows 98SE to XP. </s>
<s> Cable? </s>
<s> External hard drive (which also needs a driver)? </s>
<s> Or am I just going to have the same problem. </s>
<s> I would greatly appreciate if someone can help me with this. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The motherboard drivers are not installed. </s>
<s> Even with seasoned Windows 98se owners I still find the owners to not be aware of the motherboard driver packages. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The front USB ports are often of the wrong wiring type. </s>
<s> Most were fine back in USB 1.1 days, but not on today's hardware. </s>
<s> Workaround? </s>
<s> Use the rear ports. </s>
<s> In closing, why was the machine details left out? </s>
<s> If you had followed the forum note I might have offered a link to the driver I suspect. </s>

<s> Bob, Thanks for responding. </s>
<s> My computer doesn't have the front USB ports - only the back ones of which I have only two. </s>
<s> They have worked for using a mouse for example. </s>
<s> I am not the most computer savvy person, so please excuse that fact. </s>
<s> If you could recommend a couple of drivers as per your comment, then I can try each one until hopefully it works. </s>
<s> Thank you very much. </s>
<s> Since there is no make or model given and such drivers are for specific make and models you own. </s>
<s> While it's great that you use the rear ports, the mouse or such working is not at issue and is no indication the USB drives should work. </s>
<s> There are other possibilities but I like to start with what I see cure such most of the time. </s>
<s> Can I ask why the make and model of the machine is unknown after so many years? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Bob, I am not at home right now, so I can't give you complete specifics. </s>
<s> It is a Compaq and I bought it used a few years back. </s>
<s> Having said that, my complete hard drive was tranfered from the computer that I had long before this Compaq that we are talking about now. </s>
<s> Beyond that, I can't tell you anything until I get home and see the information you require. </s>
<s> As it is Windows 98SE, I just assumed that there was a standard Windows 98SE driver or update that needed to be downloaded. </s>
<s> Tell me exactly what you need to know and I will provide that when I get home from work. </s>
<s> Thank you very much. </s>
<s> The make and model is usually enough. </s>
<s> From there I use google to find the motherboard chipset and then hunt down the motherboard driver pack. </s>
<s> Microsoft does not supply such things. </s>

<s> is USB1 vs. USB2. </s>
<s> Maybe these new flash drives will only work on USB2. </s>
<s> A machine &quot;a few years old&quot; probably has USB1. </s>
<s> To check this go into Device Manager and look at the Universal Serial Bus Controllers. </s>
<s> USB2 will have an entry of &quot;Enhanced&quot; listed. </s>
<s> If &quot;Enhanced&quot; is not listed you have USB1. </s>
<s> To fix this is easy, purchase a USB2 PCI card. </s>
<s> Done. </s>
