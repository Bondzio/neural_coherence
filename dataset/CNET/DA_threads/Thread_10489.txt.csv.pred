1.1.1	I 've got a 1GB HP PAV Processor and am supposed to have 128MB of SDRAM only 92 MB show up on the Performance Tab .	St
1.1.2	Any ideas where my memory has gotten to ?	Ques
1.1.3	I 've tried shutting down down drivers one at a time to find a change ... ..no dice .	St
1.2.1	Do you have a separate video card or is this on your MB .	St
1.2.2	If the later , your RAM might be shared with video and your system will not report that portion .	St
1.3.1	Your system probably uses build-in video which uses system ram for its own reserved use .	St
1.3.2	In some cases you can +/- that value to suit your needs .	St
1.3.3	It then either uses some vendor utility or the setting value in the bios .	St
1.3.4	You ca n't defeat it , if you continue to use the build-in video .	St
1.3.5	Otherwise , if capable get a video card that directly installs and uses it own ram .	St
1.3.6	You need n't woryy about it and you add more ram if you have available ram slots open -OR- swap out the ram for a larger mb size in its place .	St
1.3.7	Hope this helps ... good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
