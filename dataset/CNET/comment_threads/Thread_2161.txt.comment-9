I bought a 600w PSU for a bit more than 15 and i take it that means its that not being able to hold a stable enough voltage or something like that?
Exactly.
NEVER cheap out on the PSU; it's what's powering your whole system.
If it's not stable, then your computer's not stable.
If it dies, then your computer (or at least parts of it) die.
