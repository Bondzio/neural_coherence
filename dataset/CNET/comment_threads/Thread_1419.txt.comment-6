PC is now running fine.
No damaged parts.
I'm still not sure what I did wrong, but it booted up fine for the PC shop.
Since I've been going there for several years, they gave me a break on the diagnostic fee and said forget about it.
I told them I would be back anyways in the near future to look at some upgrades for it.
Thank you to all of the quick suggestions.
I tried several times to check and recheck the connections, but somehow I missed something.
Thanks again to all.
