<s> My computer: Gateway GT5648E AMD 64x2 6000+ 3GB DDR2 GeForce 6150SE 300 watt power supply I know this is not much of a gaming computer, which is fine because I am not a hard core gamer. </s>
<s> I just like to play the occasional flight sim and am wondering if I can upgrade this computer slightly. </s>
<s> As it is, IL-2 still plays a little choppy. </s>
<s> I don't need to run the sims at their maximum settings - just above average settings would be fine for me. </s>
<s> Am I right that I can still install an external card along with the 6150SE? </s>
<s> I would rather not bother with a stronger power supply if I don't have to, but I will consider it. </s>
<s> I don't want to spend more than $200 total. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> on this same subject ? </s>
<s> Have you read you product docs to identify what your options are for installing a GPU card internally ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS...Looks like a recent purchase...did you overlook this requirement when you bought this ? </s>
<s> I did look through the others, but I couldn't find one that applied to my situation. </s>
<s> Haven't been able to find anything in my documentation either. </s>
<s> I bought this computer knowing that the 6150SE is not intended for high-end gaming. </s>
<s> That's fine, because I don't play many games and when I do, they are usually not the graphic-intensive variety. </s>
<s> It's just that occasionally I like to fire up a flight sim and am wondering if I can get a little bit better performance out of this computer. </s>
<s> I assume that means a graphics card, but if there are other ways to do it, I'm all ears. </s>
<s> You might try shutting down some of your background task before running your game....test. </s>
<s> Int vid works well for non-gamers and light gaming. </s>
<s> If you try to push this... things can get a little slow and choppy. </s>
<s> The int vid does not have the horse-power to process all that data. </s>
<s> Your machine seems to have a pci-e vid slot. </s>
<s> If you decide to use this you might open a can of worms....power+cooling. </s>
<s> Just be aware. </s>
<s> You'll find links to a list of cards and a note about your power supply. </s>
<s> Please re-use recent discussions. </s>

<s> specs in &lt;30 seconds on the web...you have the product docs, access to the WEB, access to Gateway Tech Support and access to all the similar posts here. </s>
<s> Re the PSU...you need to pick a GPU before you can decide if a larger PSU is required. </s>
<s> I'm still at a loss to understand why you recently bought a new PC with a decent processor, 3GBs RAM and onboard video and want to run Flight Simulator or any other GPU intensive software. </s>

<s> radeon 2600xt, $85: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814103038 geforce 8600gt, $104 (before $20 rebate): http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127293 either will work with your existing power supply. </s>
<s> Hello Rob. </s>
<s> I recently bought two of the same PC that you have, and let me say I love it. </s>
<s> Just to answer the question of the video card, yes you can install in internal video card. </s>
<s> I bought the 8800 GT for both of my systems ($279), and upgraded the power supply as well, but that was just for safe measure. </s>
<s> I just tracked down a card that would work perfectly for you. </s>
<s> Since the onboard graphics are nvidia, I would stay with a nvidia card as well. </s>
<s> Here's the link for the card http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814143112 You might want to toss in a power supply as well. </s>
<s> The card doesn't need one, buy a 400W supply would make your system more stable. </s>
<s> And here's a link for the supply I would recommend. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817153060 Like I said, don't need the power supply, but it would definatly help. </s>
<s> I hope this helps. </s>
<s> yah I just built an system with EVGA 8600 GTS and its good. </s>
<s> but on the card I would go EVGA or XFX. </s>
<s> they usually make good cards. </s>
<s> If your willing to look used then go to ebay. </s>
<s> I got my card for $90 bucks. </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> gaming had you equipped it with a suitable video card and PSU. </s>
