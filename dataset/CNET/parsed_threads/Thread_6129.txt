<s> I have a Sony Vaio desktop (RCX5550) computer running Windows XP with an internal CD drive and an internal CDR drive.Yesterday I went to open the CDR and it wouldn't open. </s>
<s> I then clicked on my computer to open it that way and it didn't exist anymore under the drives listed. </s>
<s> What could have happened that deleted it from the system? </s>
<s> The cd drive is fine(E:)but the CDR is nowhere to be found. </s>
<s> I had system restore turned off so I can't try that method. </s>
<s> Any ideas ? </s>
<s> Open case and with power-OFF, reseat the cables to that drive. </s>
<s> Reseat several times, including the power cable. </s>
<s> Restart system and check results. </s>
<s> If it works, great, you had minor problem. </s>
<s> Upon boot-up does the bios report it? </s>
<s> If not, then more than likely the CD drive is dead or done in, replace. </s>
<s> While there can be s/w glithces, more often than not, h/w failure is the cause, nothing can be repaired, just replace. </s>
<s> If you were having some difficlties prior to this, that's a good reason to replace. </s>
<s> You can try cleaning the drive out, but that's alast gasp effort. </s>
<s> I leave any other possible cause to other posters. </s>
<s> I found so many CD drive problems are resolved by replacement and thier cost is very reasonable. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Could I have deleted it by mistake? </s>
<s> I was trying to delete some files due to the fact I started getting a low memory message.If I did, how could I re-install it. </s>
<s> Also how do you access thebios. </s>
<s> I know each computer is different but what are some of the ways to check that? </s>
<s> http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6142_7-0.html?forumID=5&messageID=1536441&threadID=136396 Works for me. </s>
<s> Your recovery/restore CD should have the files you need. </s>
<s> Depending the nature of that CD you *may* directly select the drivers for the CD drive in question. </s>
<s> You thus re-install that way or if you know the product find the driver directly from the Sony support website or the CD drive maker support website, get related driver. </s>
<s> Yeah, you could have made an error in wiping out some files that supported that CD drive, but at least it should have reported being present though not active. </s>
<s> Check, the h/w device manager and see what it states about that drive, there too can re-install drivers needed at that time. </s>
<s> As for the bios, you manual should give a clear method to access or upon boot-up any key sequence to eneter the bios. </s>
<s> I suggest for now hitting eiother F1 or F2 key if so stated, otherwise find what your manual states. </s>
<s> This info should also be repeated at the Sony support website as well. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I tried removing the upper and lower filters from the registry but I only showed the lower filters which I removed and it didn't do anything. </s>
<s> Thanks anyway. </s>
<s> Windows installed the drive because the BIOS reports it as there. </s>
<s> If the BIOS does not report the drive, Windows won't display it. </s>
<s> Follow the previous poster's advice. </s>
<s> With a can of air and the power off, open the computer and blow it out. </s>
<s> Carefull reseat all the cables. </s>
<s> Watch the screen when you power up. </s>
<s> Note if the BIOS detects both optical drives. </s>
<s> If it does, most likely Windows will show your drive. </s>
<s> (Note that it never uninstalled the problem drive in the first place.) </s>
<s> If it does not show up in the BIOS, you will probably have to replace the drive. </s>
<s> Gwee </s>
