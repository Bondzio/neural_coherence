<s> hi, i have a few computers over a small business network and i was wondering is it possible to boot a computer over the network from NAS or do i have to go into servers which i would like to be informed about. </s>
<s> i am running xp but i can also run linux if needs be thankyou </s>
<s> to boot from a NAS would mean it would have to be running some piece of software that would send out a &quot;magic packet&quot; or some such thing. </s>
<s> NAS devices tend to be rather passive. </s>
<s> Booting over the network is usually done by &quot;wake on lan&quot; (WOL) through the network interface device. </s>
<s> It's done by broadcasting the &quot;magic packet&quot; to specified MAC addresses that you want to start. </s>
<s> I don't think a NAS can do that, but I could be wrong. </s>
<s> good post above. </s>
<s> What you are looking for is what is called PXE(&quot;pixie&quot;)-booting. </s>
<s> This is more than just the protocols on typically consumer NAS devices. </s>
<s> It is possible to do, but you better have a good background in IT and ready to spend a good bit of money for products that aren't commonly sold in consumer applications. </s>
<s> good luck! </s>
<s> would it be easier with a server and what is tha basic principal of a server as i have very little knowledge about them </s>
<s> They can be used to store and retrieve files. </s>
<s> A NAS does that as it's basic function. </s>
<s> They can be used to run programs from in a server/client environment which eliminates the need to install some programs on every PC on a network that will use them. </s>
<s> They can be used to keep databases. </s>
<s> There are web servers, proxy servers and the list goes on. </s>
<s> Your original question was about use of a NAS. </s>
<s> These generally run services but not applications. </s>
<s> They work well as file servers but can have some limited ability to keep databases. </s>
<s> It sounds as if you're looking for ways to start up PCs remotely. </s>
<s> It would not require a server to do this. </s>
<s> It would require the remote PCs to have certain hardware capabilities. </s>
<s> You'd broadcast a wake up signal from any PC on the network. </s>
<s> That signal would address the PCs you wanted to turn on but it would be by hardware address or &quot;MAC&quot;. </s>
<s> Remote or timed shutdown can also be accomplished. </s>
<s> Hope that helps. </s>
<s> u said could could run programs from servers with no installation if i understood you correctly. </s>
<s> is there a certain function that the server has to have for this to be available or do generally most servers have this ? </s>
<s> You purchase network server versions of the application and client licenses to run from terminals. </s>
<s> These client licenses are generally packaged by a specific number of remote terminals/PCs that can access the application. </s>
<s> A company might by a server version and 50 client licenses. </s>
<s> I don't know how popular this is anymore but was useful with networks that used &quot;dumb&quot; terminals....types without hard drives, etc. </s>
<s> As such, you cannot buy just any piece of software and run it from any other PC on the network as a workaround to buying more copies of the application. </s>
