Since i have a low budget and I'm not even an extreme gamer, I just want to know - Is Nvidia Geforce 8400GS good for gaming (as compared to Nvidia Geforce 7300GT and Nvidia Geforce 7600) ?
Also ,Is 256 MB Video Memory (512 MB with the Nvidia TurboCache feature) sufficient to play the current generation games quite smoothly ?
