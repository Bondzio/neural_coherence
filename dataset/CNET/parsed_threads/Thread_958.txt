<s> ive wrote about it before i was trying to decide what to get a antec case with a 350w ps or a liteon casewith generic 400w ps. </s>
<s> People said that i should try gettin a ps seperately from the case but i dont know if ill have enough money. </s>
<s> Can someone suggest one of these cases or if possible find a good case - ps combo on newegg for like under 70 bucks if possible? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I would like to make a more direct suggestion here but I can't. </s>
<s> It would help a lot if you provide some specs for the cases or a link to the cases. </s>
<s> Given that generic power supplies can be purchases for less than $30 and decents cases that provide good cooling solution and space and be purchased for less than $40, purchasis the P/S and chassis seperate might be the best way to go. </s>
<s> It really depends a lot on the parts that you will be installing in the case. </s>
<s> Antecs usually provide better cooling. </s>
<s> I haven't heard much about Liteon cases and to be honest I didn't Liteon made CASES. </s>
<s> If you get a P/S with more than 350 watts then you will have more room to work with on future upgrades. </s>
<s> I picked these based on my preference since you didn't indicate your preferences. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=11-199-005&depa=1 This particular case does not come with fans for cooling but at $26 for the case and 430Watt you can afford fans. </s>
<s> It takes up to 4 fans to keep your mainstream products at a optimal temperature. </s>
<s> I have an IT classmate that has 1 of these cases with a P4 installed. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/app/viewproductdesc.asp?description=11-195-004&DEPA=1 This case is for gamers who like a flashly looky cases to show off. </s>
<s> It comes with 430 watt P/S and 1 fan. </s>
<s> You can install 2 extra 80 mm fans in the rear. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/app/viewproductdesc.asp?description=11-144-035&DEPA=1 I picked this 1 as an option because it comes with a P/S (420 Watt) and its a professional looking entry-level server case. </s>
<s> And best of all, unlike to other cases, its aluminum when means dissipate heat better. </s>
<s> It only comes with 1 fan but you get another 80mm fan and still make your $70 budget. </s>
<s> However with the $10 shipping fee, you will spend a little more than intended. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=11-154-013&depa=1 This is just another professional looking case that would make a good option. </s>
<s> I hope that this gives you some idea of what you can get. </s>
<s> For a $70 budget the options are almost countless, especially if you're enthusiastic about it. </s>
<s> All of these came from Newegg.com. </s>
<s> Just take a look on there. </s>
<s> In the future, you will get a lot more useful help if you provide some indication of how the parts will be used, as in, for gaming, home entertainment, or office or server use. </s>
<s> Oh yeah, I kind of figured that the Antec Case that you were considering is the Antec Solution Series Mid-Tower Case w/350 W PS. </s>
<s> For the price of that case I don't see anything special. </s>
<s> It's a basic case. </s>
<s> Its made out of steel. </s>
<s> It does not come with fans (I have 1 system with this case.) </s>
<s> And lastly, 350 W is rather limited when you add future upgrades as a factor. </s>
<s> Its a decent case but would be better if it came with a larger PS and was aluminum. </s>
<s> Thats my opinion of it but I'm a semi-gamer and I like to loaded systems. </s>
<s> Good Luck. </s>
<s> Better system cases are sold w/o power supplies. </s>
<s> End-users can then install the desired p/s unit, usually what they consider best. </s>
<s> The whole point is, if you skip on cost for a decent p/s, you'll pay for it later, especially in a stuffed system. </s>
<s> While generic p/s will do fine upto a point, basically they drop down considerably under stressful conditions while a quality unit tends to maintain its wattage levels for longer periods and at stable outputs. </s>
<s> If you've a simple system, get the 350W for now and upgrade later. </s>
<s> When you check on pricing for p/s, you can see a wide difference besides the bells and whistles. </s>
<s> If you want your system to be as problem free from the start and you know you'll be putting high wattage demands, then start on the right footing, get the best p/s unit you can afford, of course a decent case with a good p/s just makes it all better. </s>
<s> Think, &quot;long term&quot;. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
