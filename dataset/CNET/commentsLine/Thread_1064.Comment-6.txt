hi r profitt thank you for your help.
i can start in safe mode but win7 has the same problem and disables the mouse and keyboard so that i cannot achieve anything.
i'd thought of editing the registry in safe mode to see if that would have helped but i cannot.
i've also tested all the usb slots when win7 boots and they're all dead.
no matter which ones i plug my keyboard and mouse in to they do not work.
interestingly the cd/dvd drive seems to be recognized in this state.
if i put a disc in i get the normal pop-up with the options to open and examine the files.
this all seemed to happen yesterday after i tried to jailbreak my iphone.
i'm sure this is a coincidence as i continued the process with my wife's pc and succeeded.
