<s> I bought a Windows 7 tablet pc recently. </s>
<s> I have searched for customized softwares for Multi-touch, but I have not got any application and any forum that gives links those applications. </s>
<s> Please help me find them. </s>
<s> Does that mean you are wanting folk to write something specific for you? </s>
<s> Sorry if I misunderstood your question but multi-touch support is in the new Visual Studio 2010 and apps you write (hence custom) there. </s>
<s> You may have to get such things created since your off the shelf apps are going to be WIMP (windows icon mouse pointer) based for a reason. </s>

<s> what type of products? </s>
<s> Sellers do not provide services? </s>
<s> Do you mean can not find drivers for multi-touch? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> I'm sorry, difficult to understand. </s>
<s> I mean end user applications like image viewer, image editor, media player, text editor, screen savers, games etc... customized for multi-touch. </s>
<s> Where can I find them? </s>
<s> Microsoft has released Touch pack, this contains globe, screen savers and games. </s>
<s> You can download it from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=b152fadd-82e4-4ddb-a46a-aebe49944428&displaylang=en I heard that corel has release media player and image editor but I have not tried them. </s>
<s> Recently I got a editor called StNotepad Touch, which has gestures for copy, paste, cut, enter, space, delete, backspace, undo etc... Download it from http://stforms.net/stnotepad-touch/download I saw a media player also in the above website, which has cool gestures for media player, but it's a very simple player, no advanced features. </s>
<s> Inform me, if you find any new softwares. </s>
