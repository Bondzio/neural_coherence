I have a brother printer as well.
I suspect that you model has the memory card readers built in.
If I remove a memory card prior to shut down then MS will hang up at shut down.
It wants to save the files even though they are no longer open.
I don't have the same problem with standard memory sticks or USB models for SD cards, just when I use the slots in the Brother Printer.
Given that you probably would catch on to that error, I would try try uninstall and reinstall the brother printer software.
