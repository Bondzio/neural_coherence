1.1.1	Computer specification: 40gigs, pentuim 4, 2.8gh, windows xp pro.	St
1.1.2	when i turn on computer the message &quot;check signal cable' appears than computer operates normally.	St
1.1.3	i upgraded from win 2000 to xp pro and it took almost 12 hours to complete upgrading.	St
1.1.4	Now the start up of the computer takes about 5 minutes (very slow unlike before)to star up.	St
1.1.5	can any body explain what could have caused this to happen.	Ques
1.1.6	ta.	St
1.2.1	It appears you get the signal because the monitor is ready before the system actually &quot;finished&quot; loading the OS.	St
1.2.2	More than likely because you &quot;upgraded&quot; the OS from W2K to XP, you left alot of old baggage and XP must waddle through all that before it OKs the boot-up processes and finishes it.	St
1.2.3	Your best bet is to try to use some decent &quot;registry cleaner&quot; and let it go at it.	Sug
1.2.4	Accept the fixes and proceed foward.	St
1.2.5	Be darn sure you backed-up any important data beforehand.	St
1.2.6	What you should have done if you hadn't is to do a &quot;clean OS install&quot;.	St
1.2.7	Not an upgrade with the old OS intact, that way you leave behind old and cumbersome s/w links, etc.. 12hr.	St
1.2.8	upgrade isn't normal, IMHO.	Sug
1.2.9	Further, you should have all CDs, floppies, etc.	St
1.2.10	to finish the install process and even get the latest drivers of your componets as well, if you go this route.	St
1.2.11	Otherwise expect this slow system to manage but only a snail pace.	St
1.2.12	tada -----Willy	St
1.3.1	i backed up my required data and reformatted the hard disk and did a clean install of win xp.	St
1.3.2	it may be the screen as you say.	St
1.3.3	Sould i try new install after reformatting the hard disk agin?	St
1.4.1	If you did a clean install of XP, why reformat again?	St
1.4.2	You got lost me here.	St
1.4.3	Just finish the OS install and then add the drivers as required.	St
1.4.4	Then proceed to the MS windows update website and get the latest OS updates, etc.. Once all that is done, then add(install!)	St
1.4.5	your pgms.	St
1.4.6	and swap your saved data to the required folders.	St
1.4.7	Don't just place folders and try swapping data that way, it won't work at least for many of the more complex pgms.	St
1.4.8	just re-install them.	St
1.4.9	Make sense?	St
1.4.10	adios -----Willy	St
