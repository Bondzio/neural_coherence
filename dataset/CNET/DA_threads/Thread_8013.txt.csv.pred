1.1.1	I have a dell laptop that will lose signal while on line and will sometime lose connection.	St
1.1.2	Distence from router is not a problem.	St
1.1.3	It will lose signal at five foot from router.	St
1.1.4	Any suggestions on correcting this problem will be welcomed.	St
1.2.1	If the answer is yes, make sure you do not have ANY device broadcasting at the same frequency in the general area.	St
1.2.2	I struggled for months with my Dell laptop and a wireless connection.	St
1.2.3	I changed routers, changed cards in the laptop, added antennas, and still no luck!	St
1.2.4	I still lost signals, had very weak connections, etc.	St
1.2.5	I didn't think it was interference because our wireless telephones were using 5.8 MHz.	St
1.2.6	Then I realized that an old wireless audio headset that I had not used in a very long time still had its base station powered on.	St
1.2.7	It broadcasts at the same frequency as Wireless-G. Sure enough, as soon as I turned the power to the base station off, ALL the problems cleared up!	St
1.2.8	Geeesh!	St
