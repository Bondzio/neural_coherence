one reason i posted as i found newer mtrbds.
and/or other components showing cap damage.
though, in some it wasn't apparent, a real close look resulted in a tipped or distended leaning.
yes, i have taken apart psus and checked them for similar damage.
some are so bad, but they still worked at least intermittently.
of course, others are &quot;smoke generators&quot;.
