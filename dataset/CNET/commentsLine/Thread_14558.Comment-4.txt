from what i read, it seems everyone was agreeing that removing the side panel was only effective if you then had a desktop fan flowing over the computer.
even then, it was mentioned that doing so is really bad for your computer due to the incredible amounts of dust that will build up inside on every computer component.
it's not a slimline/micro/mini case.
it's a medium size tower from medion(german company).
it only came with one hard drive, i added the second.
it also has a floppy drive, a full flash dashboard(any type can be loaded), a cd-rom, and a dvd-rw drive.
that means that while there's some space below the hard drives, there aren't any left over bays to use.
