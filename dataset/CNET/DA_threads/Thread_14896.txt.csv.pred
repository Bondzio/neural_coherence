1.1.1	This is a system that I built myself 2 years ago.	St
1.1.2	I have upgraded a few things over time but never any problems.	St
1.1.3	I have the MSI K7T266 PRO2 ver2.0 motherboard with an AMD XP1800 processor.	St
1.1.4	Lately whenever I start it sometime the led just flashes once and it won't start.	St
1.1.5	If I turn the power off for 10 secs.	St
1.1.6	and then back on it starts fine.	St
1.1.7	But now it won't start at all.	St
1.1.8	Everytime I turn the power off and them back on the led will flash one time and all the fans including the cpu fan will start to spin and then nothing else.	St
1.1.9	I went ahead and replace the power supply but it still does the same.	St
1.1.10	Just looking for some possible input before I start buying more parts.	St
1.1.11	I was planning on upgrading the motherboard and processor anyway but I was going to use the ones i have now in my wifes computer to upgrade it.	St
1.1.12	Thanks for any help, Carl	St
1.2.1	I'm not a guru but it could be your temp sensor that the power supply uses to auto shutdown.	St
1.2.2	If your temp sensor has a break in the wire or a short it may be giving you a false overtemp.	St
1.2.3	Also, God forbide, your new supply could have been a lemon.	St
1.3.1	I havn't recieved much imput on this problem doesn't anyone have any ideas on this problem.	St
1.4.1	But the short version was to replace the most likely bad parts (and upsize the PSU along the way) from cheapest to more expensive.	St
1.4.2	We start with the minimum 450 Watt PSU, then the motherboard and finally the CPU.	St
1.4.3	But first you strip it down to just PSU, Motherboard and the power on switch to see if it powers up.	St
1.4.4	If it doesn't then you know its one of the two.	St
1.4.5	Then add the CPU/HSF and SPEAKER to see if it comes up and beeps.	St
1.4.6	Keep building... You have read the former discussions and know the bulging, leaking capacitors mean you replace that board.	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
