I was having the same problem with my Belkin N+ Router and Comcast service (RCA Thomson modem).
I had the Comcast guys come and check the internet signal, which was strong and uninterrupted.
I took the usual steps (power cycling the modem and router, changing wireless channels, resetting modem to factory defaults, etc.)
to no avail.
I have seen rumblings around the internet about problems with this router.
There is no new firmware upgrade to address these issues.
It's a shame because I was getting great speed and throughput on the router before these problems arose.
I ended up returning the router and getting a Linksys N router - that seemed to solve my problems.
