I'm going to write no.
Here's why.
It's entirely possible the failed connection is a Chip-Select or &quot;other&quot; that will only make a difference when both are present.
My background includes embedded controls with... various types of these sticks of memory.
I'd make the visual inspection if it was my machine.
My collection of tools include some small dental surgical tools that have brought back such boards.
But if I didn't look at the sockets then I would have never repaired them.
