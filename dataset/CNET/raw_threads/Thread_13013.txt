If all looks good in there, make sure you are set to try to boot from CD/DVD drive first. Then try a Live Linux CD or Ultimate Boot CD and start check devices for a failure. It could have been memory or a heat build up or just a hardware failure. If you can boot into one of the above CD's more than likely you can find the problem.
