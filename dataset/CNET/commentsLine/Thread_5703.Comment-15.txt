i have bought my ink from two places, the first is 123inkjets.com.
their prices are very good for the printer that i have, about $4.00 per cartridge.
the last place that i purchased ink from was abcink.com, and their prices were just as good as 123inkjets.com.
the only reason that i changed companies was 123inkjets.com no longer uses paypal as a payment source.
i received fast service from both of those companies.
