Would love to find a laser printer that works with refilled cartridges (trying to be green) or at least has cartridges with such high yield that you don't mind paying for them every once in a while. It's a small office, we probably print less than 50 sheets a day and do not require color printing. We are switching to laser due to running through our print cartridges so quickly with the inkjet and being fed up with printers NOT working with refilled or refurbished cartridges. If you have a suggestion for or against any laser, we would appreciate it!

As I said there are many manufacturers out there, it depends on what you are doing from a quantitative standpoint. The best thing to do would be to go and look at a few and compare specifications, cost per page etc. Best of luck!

Having wireless technology will work very well in an office setting. I have never used a stock HP cartridge with this one, except the very first one that came with the printer. HP wants 70 bucks for them, and I'm getting them on amazon now for 11 bucks including shipping. Our family has always had good luck with HPs. Another thing to keep in mind is that (at least when I was shopping for a laser) you might want to see if the drum is a separate accessory, and if so, how many pages you can expect to print off of one, before replacing it. When I was shopping, HP said that the drums are built into each cartridge so you don't have to worry about this, but they can be quite expensive for other printers. Maybe they are all like this now (built into the toner cartridge), but when I was buying this, a Brother that I was thinking of had it as an extra part that would need to be replaced.

The more popular, the more likely easily available. There are also, services that maybe local to you that provide the actual refill service or carts when needed. From what I've seen Brother and Samsung have the bottom end of mono-lasers out there. They're good and you need to review the specs. Many are under $100 and deals can be had. At those prices, you can buy another printer and leave it on the shelf until dire need. Replacement toner carts, while new from OEM are cheaper now, refills still are cheaper, but as always, cheap is cheap. Buy, from a source you deem worthy. Also, HP has low cost mono-laser but here you need to review what options start to fall into place, like wifi, memory, paper handling, duplex, etc., to include other brands as well. A low-end printer should last at least 2yrs. before some issue crops up and that also depends on usage. As a small SOHO, don't settle for price alone. I have recommended Konica, HP and Canon while more expensive tend to simply last under normal use. taeda -----Willy

I used to spend my days charging a lot more than a cartridge costs to tell people &quot;The problem is the toner cartridge&quot;; or worse yet cleaning up the mess when a &quot;rebuilt&quot; cartridge dumped its toner in the machine.

I am using it for about 2 years now, without any trouble. I am delighted to use it. &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

I've had a Samsung ML-1750 for about six years now and the quality of the print is still as good as the day I bought it. It happily runs on Cartridge World refilled toner cartridges ut then they do refill genuine Samsung cartridges, not compatibles. The only niggle with Samsung is that the initial cartridge supplied with the printer is half load - a tad mean! HP Laserjet 10xx models have a pretty good reputation too and should be fine for the print capacity you need. I've no experience with Brother but their price is very attractive. Depending on your needs, you might want to take a look at some of the laser all-in-ones that have now reached the &quot;affordable&quot; level.
