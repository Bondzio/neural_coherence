1.1.5	Everything seems fine , I can adjust volume and whatnot , but there is no sound coming from my speakers , except for a strange buzzing sound when I move my mouse .	St
1.1.6	It 's soft , and can only be heard if I have the speakers turned up significantly loud .	St
1.1.7	Everytime I move my mouse it 's like I can hear it as a buzz ... Anyways , can anyone help ?	Ques
1.1.8	I would be VERY grateful I do n't know what to do and I really need sound Thanks a lot	St
1.2.1	Check the port you are using as output to the speakers .	St
1.3.1	Verify you 're plugged in to the right sound port .	St
1.3.2	Then verify in the bios area that you have the audio , & quot ; enabled & quot ; .	St
1.3.3	Read your manual to find out just what key sequence is required to eneter the bios .	St
1.3.4	Also , make sure to save any changes before exiting the bios area .	St
1.3.5	These are primary steps that have to be checked .	St
1.3.6	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.4.1	I am plugged into the right port , but just in case I have tried all three ... and also , I have it enabled through my BIOS .	St
1.4.2	I have the sound enabled and the onboard LAN disabled .	St
1.4.3	What else could be wrong ?	Ques
1.4.4	: ( : ( : (	St
1.5.1	If downloading latest drivers does n't work , you can pester the supplier for a working motherboard or disable the onboard sound and install a sound card .	St
1.5.2	Your choice .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	Test under the control panel- & gt ; multimedia & sounds icon and try a sound output .	St
1.6.2	OR do an audio system setup where you config the speaker setup , output , etc .	St
1.6.3	for best operation .	St
1.6.4	That depends on the type of chipset you have .	St
1.6.5	You can try reloading the mtrbd .	Sug
1.6.6	drivers for audio as well .	St
1.6.7	Of course check to see that ouput is n't , & quot ; muted & quot ; or set so low .	St
1.6.8	If none of this helps , then you may have a bad audio chipset , of course if any & quot ; manual & quot ; jumpers need to set , do so , check in the manual/docs for details .	St
1.6.9	Under device mgr , verify no red/yellow flags are present , if so , correct them .	St
1.6.10	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
