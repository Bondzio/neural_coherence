With help from my buddy the parts were put together without any problem. Our dilemma lies in the booting of the installed O/S. We tried booting with XP Professional or Linux Ubuntu 10.10 but the hard drive is not able to fully start up either O/S. XP gives us the Blue Screen, while Linux only gives the blinking cursor after the bios runs. My friend believes there is something wrong with the hard drive. After getting the Blue Screen he used a software to do a clean wipe of the drive which found many dirty/corrupted sectors. If so I can get the drive replaced by NewEgg. However, I wanted to know if any of you had other suggestions. Please see my build specs below.

I can download the drivers for the HD but I'm not sure if the PC will read them since they will be on a separate disk. I can try it since its worth shot.

Page 28 tells you to set the BIOS for XP &quot;2.13.1 Installing Windows? XP / XP 64-bit Without RAID Functions&quot; PAGE 2 of http://www.asrock.com/support/qa/TSDQA-44.pdf repeats this advice. Bob
