even if you have to reboot a few times - particularly if any numbers appear as these are a clue - but even the odd word will do like &quot;volume&quot;.
As for emergency CD's, in case we get separated here is the link - you can Tailor this CD to your needs and include a virus program or just download as is - The trouble with XP is it is not DOS based, therefore when problems occur and the operating system crashes only the recovery console is available, which for most users is not user friendly.
