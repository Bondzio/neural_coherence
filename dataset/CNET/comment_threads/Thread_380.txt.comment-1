I tried a dual monitor setup for several days when my company donated 3 older CRT monitors.
I played around with: ATI 128MB Radeon 9800 Pro Dell UltraSharp 18.1'' LCD monitor (no pivot mode) some 17'' Compaq CRT monitor I don't have this setup anymore since.
My deskspace barely has enough for these 2 monitors, my PC tower, and misc stuff like speakers which also meant i couldn't really see the TV with it the extra one there, but I might reconfigure the setup later on.
In the meantime, any1 have tips or utilities to share for dual monitor users?
Tips like how to seperate 2 opened Excel files into 2 entries on the taskbar so I can put 'em side by side across the monitors.
And utilities/software/games like MinMaxExtender which is actually for single monitors but deals with window functionality like ''always on top'', ''vertical max'', etc.?)
or fun stuff like Particle Fire 2 (screen saver with dual monitor support) I keep work stuff at work, so this PC is mostly used for PC games, surfing, and and multimedia.
I actually tried using the 2nd monitor to surf while watching TV shows/movies (on DVD) or while a slow/lagging PC game was loading up.
It was pretty neat.
