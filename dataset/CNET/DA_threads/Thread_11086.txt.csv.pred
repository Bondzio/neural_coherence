1.1.1	Dear Cnet members, Earlier today I partitioned my external hard drive using Acronis Disk Director.	St
1.1.2	I then later found out I didn't need to partition it for the intended purpose so I deleted the partition.	St
1.1.3	Now it comes up as unallocated space and unless I format it I cannot use it.	St
1.1.4	Now I want to format it but I want it to go back with the original drive not as a separate one.	St
1.1.5	For example Original drive F partitioned to F and Y drives.	St
1.1.6	Then deleted Y and it became un allocated.	St
1.1.7	I need the Y to merge with the F again.	St
1.1.8	Sorry fr the poor explanation, it's hard.	Polite
1.1.9	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	to 'expand or extend' C to use or take-up the unallocated space.	St
1.2.2	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Thanks it worked.	St
1.3.2	I didn't see that option before in the software.	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
