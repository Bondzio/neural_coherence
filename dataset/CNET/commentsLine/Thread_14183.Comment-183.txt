as a mechanical engineer, i worked in research wing of indian railways in lucknow (india) from 1968 to 1971 and was given a weeks training by ibm in fortran-iv.
then i started developing programmes for the railways, traversing on alternate days, all the way to iit kanpur ( about 50 miles away, local transport, rail and then again local transport), punched cards there, got them listed and submitted them to the computer center (main frame 4406 or some similar number.
i am not sure now) spending almost whole day, and would get the result on my next visit, again to revise and re-submit for further run.
left railways in 1971 to join a steel plant and had nothing to do with computers for next 30 years.
now i am retired, own a pc as pastime, initiated by my niit trained daughter, have learnt *** bits of c++, made a few programmes, and run them by f4 and f9, a matter of one or two seconds, performing a task which necessitated commuting for whole day in 1968-71.
