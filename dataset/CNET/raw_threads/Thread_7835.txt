She currently struggles with AOL, and I've been advised that I can get her using my cable connection - without no inconvenience to me (I work from home) - if I just network her to my computer, using a wireless router. Could somebody advise? She has 2 USB ports, but no Ethernet port, so I'm assuming I need to get a USB to ethernet adapter, but then what? What other stuff do I need to buy, and what do you recommend that is inexpensive but works well enough: she just needs to be able to go online to check her emails, and very rarely browse some online store or other! Many thanks, in advance, for your feedback and advice.

I hope you won't mind a couple of follow-ups: Do I also need a router with this? If so, what router would you recommend I purchase? The site you referenced states it works with Windows 98SE...does it work with the regular Windows 98 as well? My wife has a Compaq &quot;Internet Computer&quot; from 1999, which works fine, and has 2 USB ports, and runs Windows 98.

Workarounds are: 1) Upgrade the OS 2) Place the wireless router near the 98 machine and use a CAT5 cable to it. Of course some type of ethernet adapter would need to be installed in the machine. A multiported wireless router which feature both wired and wireless capabilities from D-Link or Linksys are among the most popular devices used.

He claims I should get the G-120, instead of the 122, as the former goes to 54 Mbps, and the 122 only goes to 11Mbps. I asked him if I even needed more than 11, given my wife only uses the net for checking email, and the very rare browsing session. He said yes, because it would ensure less dropped connections...He also strongly recommended the DI-624 router, because they will be apparently shortly discontinuing the DI-514...your thoughts? thanks again, in advance, for your advice.

As far as a faster internet connection, not really since your internet is traveling much slower then 11 mbps. I have no idea what he meant by &quot;less dropped connections&quot;, this seems misleading.

Am now planning on upgrading my home networking (ie: installing some beyond just simple PC to PC wireless). Thanks again, and sorry for delay in expression of gratitude!
