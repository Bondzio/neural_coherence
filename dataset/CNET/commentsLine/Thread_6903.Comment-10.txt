i bought an external harddrive from the local store myself, and want to put the entire contents of my computer on to it to store in case of my computer crashing.
the directions were written in broken chinese/english, and didn't make much sense.
can someone tell me step by step how to do this?
i've got windows xp pro and 33.1 gb to copy.
it's a dell desktop, too.
like someone mentioned, is it possible to copy everything so that if it crashed i could use it to boot up and restore everything if i had to reinstall windows and lost it all?
i never did see anything about &quot;partitioning&quot; using the directions they gave, but i did see the command to format the external f drive and did that.
after that, i was lost... thanks for any help... jan
