1.1.1	My dad has a Sony DW-D22A DVD burner that's failing (in this computer).	St
1.1.2	I was wondering what's a good replacement?	Polite
1.1.3	My dad will probably be buying this locally (in San Diego, CA), but I'm doing some of the research online.	St
1.1.4	I would like something that's: very reliable not too expensive (but not too cheap either.	St
1.1.5	I've seen drives locally for $40 or so but I wonder if they'll hold up over the long term (2-3 years or more), and I'm wondering if somewhere around $100-120 is the sweet spot?)	St
1.1.6	at least 8x DVD+/-R, 4x RW write speeds (and 48x CD write speed) Dual layer would be nice, but (I'll have to check with my dad on this though) I think we may be able to do without it for now.	St
1.1.7	Also, what brand(s) of media is(are) good to get?	St
1.1.8	I've been using Memorex, but a lot of CDs I've burned recently will skip the first time I play them, and they have scratches and smudges even the first time I put them in the drive to record onto them.	St
1.2.1	Just get a 16X or 18X dual layer DVD burner for about $30 +S&H.	St
1.2.2	They will burn just about everything, except the new HD/Blu-ray DVD's.	St
1.2.3	Want Lightscribe technology?	St
1.2.4	Then, get one with it.	St
1.2.5	Check reviews at NewEgg.com	St
1.3.1	I want one that will last a while without having problems.	St
1.3.2	Are any brands/models better than others, or as long as I spend $x I'll be fine?	St
1.4.1	cdrinfo.com cdrlabs.com cdfreaks.com Pick one or two that look good to you like and read buyer comments at NEWEGG.COM	St
1.5.1	... at those sites, but I'm having trouble making sense of the info.	St
1.5.2	As far as features, I basically want what you'd normally expect on a recent-model DVD drive, for example 16x DVD+/-R reading & writing, 48x CD reading & writing, 32x CDRW writing, 8x DVD DL writing, or something along those lines.	St
1.5.3	I don't need blu-ray at this point - way too pricey.	St
1.5.4	Basically I want a drive that will pretty much work with anything I throw at it (I might be able to do without DVD-RAM or Dual Layer, and I CAN do without Blu-Ray for now), and is very reliable (I want to replace the drive several years from now because I'd be very stupid not to buy a then-current generation of newer-than-Blu-Ray drive (for, say, $30-50), and not because this one breaks (that's the reason I'm replacing my dad's Sony DW-D22A).	St
1.5.5	So any specific drives I should look at, or is it basically get anything in a certain price range?	St
1.5.6	Also, I don't want an OEM drive - I want the manual and software at least, and, it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to have the cable(s) thrown in, too.	St
1.5.7	We (this is actually for my parents' computer) NEED TO GET A DRIVE WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS (sorry for the caps, but I don't think there's bold and underline support on the forums).	St
1.5.8	I live in San Diego, CA, so there are plenty of local computer stores where we could get a drive.	St
1.5.9	I'd like to have it installed (probably either by me, my dad, or my brother) on Saturday, if possible, or at the absolute latest, Monday, the 13th.	St
1.5.10	RELIABILITY over the long term is extremely important, as well as compatibility with as many types/brands of media as possible.	St
1.5.11	Also strongly wanted is a non-OEM drive (i.e.	St
1.5.12	one that includes more than just the actual drive, as I said above).	St
1.5.13	Last but not least, and I hope I can convince my dad to open his wallet a little more (although I haven't talked to him yet about his price limit) if it means we'll get a much better quality drive, I'd like to keep the price in the $50 to $80 range, give or take a little, if possible.	St
1.6.1	I would add I've have good luck with Plextor ... downside is cost and their ratings are't materially better than drives 1/2 their price.	St
1.6.2	NEC, Samsung and LG are the ones I'd probably look at now.	St
1.6.3	Re durability...	St
1.6.4	I've never had one fail of any brand and there are no stats that I've seen to recommend one over another.	St
1.6.5	They're truly becoming more of a commodity.	St
1.6.6	My advice again ... look at the current crop as reviewed in the refs provided ...might try PC World and and PC Magazine too...then read some of the buyer comments from Newegg.com.	St
1.6.7	Make sure they have the features you want, pick one or maybe even two ... they are very very inexpensive these days and place your order.	St
1.6.8	VAPCMD	St
1.7.1	before I got a chance to read the responses.	St
1.7.2	It's a Lite-On SHW-160P6S04C 16X +/- R & RW dual layer drive.	St
1.7.3	Came with Nero Express 6.6, we already have 6.3 installed from the previous drive, so we haven't updated it.	St
1.7.4	Any good reason to?	Polite
1.7.5	My gut instinct tells me it's only a minor version change/upgrade and probably not worth it.	St
1.7.6	Also, what is some good brand(s) of blank media to get?	Ques
1.7.7	My dad's recently been using Sony.	St
1.7.8	I have been using Memorex CD-Rs and got a pack of GQ DVD-Rs (which I decided I won't touch GQ again in their current incarnation).	St
1.7.9	I've been having trouble with my Mem's, though.	St
1.7.10	Would TDK be another good brand for me to try?	St
1.7.11	I don't want to get the same brand that my dad gets, cause we want to be able to know whose discs are whose by what brand they are.	St
1.7.12	I will want to get a 100 pack each of DVD (is - fine or should I get +?)	St
1.7.13	R, CD-R, and maybe, if the price isn't too high, a 25 or 50 of + or - DVDRW.	St
1.8.1	Same with CD-DVD firmware ... neither are major changes but changes nonethelss that may help fix minor flaws and incompatibilites and sometimes offer expanded functionality.	St
1.8.2	Re TDK...I've had excellent results with their CD and DVDs.	St
1.8.3	Let us know how you like the Lite-On.	St
1.8.4	VAPCMD	St
1.9.1	For what it's worth, I got a Lite-on LVW-5116GHC+ DVD Recorder to record from TV and Tivo and have been VERY pleased...very simple to operate and it will read and record most any media with no problems.	St
1.9.2	(It doesn't do double layer recording tho)	St
