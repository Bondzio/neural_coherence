Proffitt	8/8/12 8:16 AM	1.34441376E12	Do you own the usual solder iron, magnifying lens?	http://superuser.com/questions/83540/repair-snapped-usb-flash-drive shows the usual picture of what's inside. We take that to the bench and solder on another cable or connector for that last time use to get the files out. http://www.drivesavers.com also does this if you don't. Bob

Then if there is file system damage they can recover that too. When you can't lose it, they are to go to people. The highest price we paid was about 24,000 for recovering Novell drives. Long story about an IT that believed that RAID meant that backup was not necessary since RAID could recover from drive loss. Backup copies are always cheaper. Bob
