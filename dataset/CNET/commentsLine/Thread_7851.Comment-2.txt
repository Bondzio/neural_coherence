what metric do you use to determine &quot;best&quot;?
if it is performance then the core 2 duo would be the winner while if it is bang for the buck then it may vary a bit.
i would suggest a dual core laptop, e.g.
intel core duo, core 2 duo(which is the successor to core duo) or amd turion 64 x2, if you do any cpu-intensive tasks.
i would likely stay away from celeron or sempron laptops unless you don't mind having a low power processor as these are for low-end systems which isn't the same as saying they use less electricity.
