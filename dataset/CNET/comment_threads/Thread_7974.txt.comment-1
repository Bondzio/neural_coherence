I need to quickly and inexpensively create a network for transfering files between two computers.
Laptop (Vista) getting internet over wifi (net not needed for this operation) and desktop(XP SP2).
Is a crossover cable required or can I just ethernet them to each other (hasn't worked yet)?
Are there special settings to configure or should something just pop up.
