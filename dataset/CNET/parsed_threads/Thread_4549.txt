<s> I have a 2+ year old Dell Dimension 4600 desktop with a CD/DVD RW drive. </s>
<s> We hadn't used that drive in a while, and last week it didnt work. </s>
<s> It has power, but the system can't see the drive. </s>
<s> I opened up the box and found it wasn't connected to the mother board! </s>
<s> OK, so I plugged it into its slot. </s>
<s> Still no joy. </s>
<s> Two months ago (in its last week of warrantee), a Dell tech replaced the power supply, which had failed. </s>
<s> Perhaps he had unplugged the drive. </s>
<s> QUESTION: Why doesn't it work now? </s>
<s> Could the power supply failure have fried the drive? </s>
<s> Is there some kind of device driver that's missing? </s>
<s> If you are running Winxp, you might want to go right click on my computer -&gt; properties -&gt; Hardware -&gt; Device manager -&gt; DVD/CD rom column. </s>
<s> Is there a question mark? </s>
<s> Another thing you could do is make sure your IDE cable is connected properly to the motherboard. </s>
<s> Check the pins configuration. </s>
<s> Pin 1 should go to Pin 1 on motherboard and CDROM. </s>
<s> I got that mixed up sometimes. </s>
<s> Thanks, HWN Yes, I am running XP, but Device Manager shows nothing for the CD ROM. </s>
<s> It's just plain blank, as if the drive isn't even installed. </s>
<s> I'll try resetting the cable again. </s>
<s> Thanks Pepperdog </s>
<s> the tech fried it and didn't want to say anything because the warranty was going to expire? </s>
<s> Could HE have left the drive unplugged?? </s>
<s> Stranger things have happened. </s>
<s> Good Luck and get a new drive. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
