1.1.1	I recently acquired the AIW 9800 Pro .	St
1.1.2	I 've had luck in the past with ATI products , and this card works great for the most part .	St
1.1.3	The one difficulty I am having however is that my TV OUT is not working .	St
1.1.4	I can not seem to open the Catalyst Control Center and am given a message that it failed to initialize properly .	St
1.1.5	I 've installed both the copy of Catalyst that came with the card and the copy found online .	St
1.1.6	Both show the same problem .	St
1.1.7	I 've called tech support to try and solve the issue ... yeah right .	St
1.1.8	It is true what they say about AIT 's tech support .	St
1.1.9	Of course , that seems to be the case with almost every tech support out there nowadays .	St
1.1.10	Anyway , anyone out there that has experienced similar issues ?	Ques
1.2.1	Hopefully you have resolved this issue by now , but if not , here 's what I do .	St
1.2.2	I see this message from time to time , usually after using Nero to capture DV camcorder input via firewire and not through the AIW card .	St
1.2.3	I just have to re-install the tv capture drivers ( which I had to download after installing the software from the CD ) and then the TV function works fine .	St
1.2.4	I 've included the description and link from ATI 's driver pages .	St
1.2.5	WDM Capture Driver version 6.14.10.6246 V3 is required for capture support on ALL-IN-WONDER and VIVO products .	St
