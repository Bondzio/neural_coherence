<s> i got a new Dell Inspirion 9300 and it has Intel Centrino Mobile Technology and has a wireless internet card. </s>
<s> but i dont pick up any signals because i am in a military base and i was wondering how to set up a internet router on my laptop without a pc. </s>
<s> You have the hardware, DO you have the internet provider to connect to? </s>
<s> If you don't have one, then How do you expect to browse the internet? </s>
<s> If you are hoping, there are some wireless signal in your area.. then Think again.. you are in a military base... probably they banned all signal.. </s>
<s> just connect the wireless router/modem to your provider line.. configure it.. (Give it a name/SSID, enable WEP/WPA/WPA2 security, then your laptop will pick up the signal... enter the name and password required (you create this when you enable the security).. thats it... </s>
