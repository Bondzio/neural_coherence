Get a high level Sound Card like an Audigy 2 zs or the X-Fi. http://us.creative.com/products/category.asp?category=1 Speakers - I would go for at least the T5400's. http://us.creative.com/products/category.asp?category=4&subcategory=25 I would go for a non-wireless keyboard and mouse. If you are really into gaming, get an optical mouse with a high resolution.
