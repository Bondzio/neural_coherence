<s> Whats up with chinese tablets. </s>
<s> Many have no service centers and some are buggy. </s>
<s> And the OS is usually done without any license fees. </s>
<s> Of course there is that issue with labor. </s>

<s> In this instance, &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; holds very true here. </s>
<s> I shell out a bit more money and get one that has a reputable brand name. </s>
<s> With those no name tablets, you're just asking for grief. </s>
<s> Cheers! </s>

<s> If you told me that Toshiba, Motorola, Samsung and Lenovo were rebranded Chinese tablets I would be surprized, but if you told me the Kindle Fire, Nook color, Vizio or Viewsonic were I would not be. </s>
<s> We know that the iPad kinda-sorta is/is not a rebranded Chinese tablet. </s>
<s> Rebranding adds a lot to the price. </s>
<s> Also having a turtleneck wearing CEO telling you that you are cool for owning one of these things adds a lot to the price. </s>
<s> Also they are made generally as one piece. </s>
<s> A Lenovo TPT you can field strip it. </s>
<s> Virtually every tablet has a limited lifetime. </s>
<s> Depending on use, it could be as low as two years, on average five years and probably ten years max ( assuming normal usage ). </s>
<s> Chinese tablets are built with the expectation that tablets will last 3-4 years on average, and aren't built to last much longer. </s>
<s> That reduces the production costs. </s>
<s> I think many people would be surprised how many tablets you see out there come of the same assembly line as a Chinese tablet but simply have a different cover slapped on. </s>
<s> Of course many people don't mind paying the extra for the rebranded tablet, seeing how the instructions are in English and you don't have to ship it to China for service. </s>
<s> YMMV </s>
