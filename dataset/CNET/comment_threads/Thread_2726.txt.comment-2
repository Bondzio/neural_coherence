or required speed.
Personally, I always liked 3Com but they got bought by HP.
We picked up a 48 port baseline model for our school.
Its auto-sensing, 10/100 with a gigabit uplink and has worked fine.
We've a couple of 24 port 3Coms and one POE used for the wireless system.
None have ever had a problem.
These are all their &quot;baseline&quot; models which are unmanaged, rack mountable and moderately priced.
I'll recommend 3Com any day if you can still find their products but more about your needs would be helpful.
