thanks to all of you for your recommendations.
i did research arctic silver and i can't wait to try it!
for the short term, i ordered a &quot;thermaltake tmg nd2 video card / gpu cooler cl-g0078, for nvidia 6800.&quot; that hopefully will channel some hot air out of the chassis.
my raid 1 drive crashed last year and i could not revive it (so now i'm on 1 160 gb drive, re-imaged from oem on raid 0).
i wonder if this hotness is what killed my raid.
i just quit playing the witcher enhanced edition, which should be cake for my system (3ghz ddr2 ram), and saw my cpu temp at 172 degrees f. i'll see what happens with the vga card.
anyway, thanks again for the great information.
happy gaming, and happy thanksgiving!
