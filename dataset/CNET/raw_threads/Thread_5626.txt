Floppy/CD/CD-DVD drives. It came from Compaq with Windows ME which was unstable at best - I had assumed most of my locking issues were tied to ME, so I upgraded to Windows 2000. 1. The computer will randomly not boot properly - it will ping the CD and DVD, miss the floppy, start the hard drive and then stall leaving a blank screen even though the hard drive LED is illuminates green, starts, then goes out. If I start it repeatedly by turning the power button on, it will eventually boot up, or stall in the process. 2. Once operating after a succesful boot, the computer will lock randomly even when sitting idle at the desktop screen with no programs open. It also locks randomly with open programs. 3. I notice that sometimes when it locks, the fan whine seems to slow and then come back up to speed. 4. I have to manually power it down by holding power button in, and restart with power button, only to experience problem number 1, intermittent boot success. Is there a known issue out there with the Presario desktops - could it be the power supply or CMOS battery, or is it likely software related? Help! 3.

HP) and download the latest drivers, especially BIOS for W2K. If the W2K was not supplied by COMPAQ, you cannot rely on Microsoft alone to support your system. Just loading W2K and driver updates will not always do the trick. My experience with Compaq Workstations, Armad laptops and a Presario or two. I use W2K and have almost always had to get something from the Compaq/HP driver/software downloads.

What they didn't tell you is that FANs blow air onto the heatsink and not unlike the LINT BASKET on a clothes dryer, it can build up an insulating blanket which causes the CPU to overheat. Or the CPU FAN has failed? You need to look. Bob

Thanks Bob - Parasites are certainly a possibility and I did read the info you provided to another post. I was experiencing hijacks on the web, etc. but thought I had cleaned them well enough and protected my machine. I now use Stopzilla as a pop up blocker which seems to work very well. Could a parasite be causing random locks and improper boots repeatedly - and why would the machine boot properly one time and not the next on power up? Could it be that simple - blasted parasites and hijack code?

9843	7	30888	351531	351519	R. Proffitt	7/27/04 7:48 AM	1.09091448E12	Yes.	It's a common issue, but many don't like that we have to scan and remove the pests with some 5 tools. Some want a single piece of software to fix it. Sorry, we don't have that technology yet (unless it's Linux?) The short list is: Adaware, Spybot, Cwshredder, Housecall and BHODEMON. BHODEMON appeared a short while ago and I've found it usefull to list the BHOs and to remove the ones I don't want. Another issue is Internet Explorer. Doxdesk explains it's danger. It's such an issue that I advise to use any other non-IE browser when possible. Bob

It should list by category, including bios updates. Good luck
