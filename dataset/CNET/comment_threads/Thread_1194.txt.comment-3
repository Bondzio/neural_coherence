I'm no expert however, I suffered similar problems in that my comp, without warning, would switch itself off completely and then restart and boot to the welcome screen as if nothing had happened.
I persevered for around three months until I could take it no more.
I checked all my wiring connections inside my comp to start - no probs there!
I did a virus scan - no probs there!
I changed my RAM - still had the problem.
Then I changed my PSU from a FSP 250-60 GTA (250W) to a Jeantech 400W (30 from PC World) - Problem cured!!!
Since changing the PSU (it has been running for around two months now) I have not experienced any more unexplained shutdowns.
I hope this helps.
