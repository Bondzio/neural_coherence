If I were looking to buy right now, I'd pick RAM with good ratings and more buyer reviews. http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=100007611%20600006127%20600006069&IsNodeId=1&name=8GB%20%282%20x%204GB%29 Just one question....what will you be backing up to ?

In the event the primary drive dies, I replace it and use the data from the backup on the 2nd HDD to restore a full working image to the new primary HDD. Then I wipe the original drive and send it for warranty replacement. Fast and easy. Beats the heck out of finding all the installation discs, the serial numbers, reloading all the SW, setting preferences, etc., makes me tired just thinking of it. VAPCMD PS..Good choice on the RAM !
