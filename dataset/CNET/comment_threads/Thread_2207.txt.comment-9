The main problem is when i stick the dvd in the drive, the drive in my computer no longer thinks is a dvd drive it just says cd drive and when i access it it says that there is 0 free space on the disk (yes its a new DVD) and i already tried the upperfilters and lowerfilters or whatever didnt work...
