1.1.1	Building new system- kit came with rounded cable option , do I set all drives to cable select-or -- master / slave- I at first thought because there were n't 80 conductors ( like ata133 ribbon cables ) that master / slave would be the way- but have had several people say-Noo , use cable select ? ? ?	Ques

1.1.3	?	Ques
1.2.1	You can try the other way , but why is there confusion here ?	Ques

1.3.1	80 conductor cables .	St
1.3.2	If they were n't your mobo will tell you that they are n't if you are using any drive of ATA 66 or above .	St
1.3.3	They also will be keyed such that the end connector is Master [ for CS ] and the middle connector is the slave .	St
1.4.1	That 's all they are , ribbon wire , slit and bundled neatly in round form .	St
1.4.2	Same = Same .	St
1.4.3	Use the master / slave pinning as you normally would .	St
