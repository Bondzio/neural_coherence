<s> I've set up a home network between my laptop and PC and I've got no problems connecting between the two using a wireless network - I can share files and access the internet via a broadband router. </s>
<s> When I use a direct cable connection between the two machines using network cards, nothing happens. </s>
<s> Both NICs are configured to give an IP automatically and ever time I connect the two machines I get a 'limited or no connectivity' message. </s>
<s> The wireless card also assign IPs automatically. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> needs to be a crossover type cable for a NIC to NIC connection to work. </s>
