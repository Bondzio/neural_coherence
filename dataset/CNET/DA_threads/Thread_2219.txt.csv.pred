1.1.1	Hi i'm planning to build a new gaming/work desktop and I have my mind set on having 8 Gigs of ram on it.	St
1.1.2	Now I know that 32-bit OS's will not recognize more than 4 Gigs, so I will install Vista 64-bit.	St
1.1.3	My mobo and Processor will be: EVGA 122-CK-NF68-T1 and Intel Core 2 extreme QX6800.	St
1.1.4	Note that I've done extensive research on the mobo and could not find anything relevant to this issue.	St
1.1.5	The mobo's spec does not mention it supporting (or not supporting) a 64-bit architecture or Intel's EM64T technology.	St
1.1.6	Does this mean that I cannot have 8 gigs of RAM on this Mobo even with Vista 64-bit ?	Ques
1.1.7	So my question is: WHAT ARE ALL THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR A 64-BIT SYSTEM THAT HAS 8 GIGS OF RAM ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks in advance	St
1.2.1	So you get your 64-bit OS and all is good.	St
1.2.2	Now where is your 64-bit game?	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	and all core2 processors are 64bit so you're all set.	St
1.3.2	newer games can run on vista/64 with a bit of coaxing.	St
1.3.3	older games are more problematic and some won't run/install at all.	St
1.3.4	games certified as &quot;games for windows&quot; are designed to run on both 64bit and 32bit windows.	St
1.3.5	here are some gaming benchmarks on vista ultimate 64bit.	St
1.3.6	http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/cpu/display/core2duo-e6420_5.html	St
1.4.1	http://www.intel.com/design/processor/datashts/313278.htm	St
1.5.1	Well, I would just settle for the &quot;meager&quot; 4GB of RAM and then upgrade in a few years when I actually need it.	St
1.5.2	But that's just me.	St
