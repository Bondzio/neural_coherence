i've bought the pc with this specs: drive - seagate barracuda 7200 (st3160811as) sataii motherboard : msi 945pl supports sataiias i said.
its not from a manufacturer (like dell or ibm) the store should have made it from parts but its name 'optimum spc-8' (- p dual 3.4, 2*512mb 533mhz ddr ii, 160gb 7200rpm sata2 hdd, fdd, dvd +/-rw, nvidia 7300gs) yes i have reinstalled the os and then drive speed was just around 3mb/s cuz it was in pio mod i've the driver reinstalled so its in udma5 then.
it think i found out the reason of the freezes could it be because is touched the sata cable?
i've read somewhere this cable is very sensitive.
