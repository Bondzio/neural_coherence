try futuremark's 3dmark2003 (or 2005 if you think the system is up to it, if it's a 6600 or lower it'll be a slideshow (wait, what am i talking about?
it's a slideshow on 6800 series cards, even sli doesn't break 50 fps in anything))  and just download the free demo versions it'll give you a good idea of how the computer performs in gaming application if your interested in how it performes in non gaming application, get pcmark2004, as it will benchmark office productivity and other non-gaming type things
