Thanks, I am already running a Linksys PrintServer with my system upstair.
I print to the upstairs printer from my Laptop downstarirs.
I guess where I am still confused is, If I hook another Linksys PS to my downstairs printer, it will be a total stand alone.
Can I then print through my Wireless Links Router from the up stairs setup with my wireless Laptop?
I don't think Linksys make that very clear in the install instructions.
