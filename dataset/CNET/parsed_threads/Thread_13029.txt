<s> I was reading this from CNet and i like the specs. </s>
<s> http://reviews.cnet.com/eMachines_T6524/4505-3118_7-31556305.html But I saw a few posts about the 300watt supply isnt enough? </s>
<s> Is this really no enough if i am not planning on upgrading it anytime soon? </s>
<s> Could I easly put a ATI 700 pro graphics card in there and also 4gb of RAM and still run it well with the 300watt supply? </s>
<s> I also read that the motherboard is kind of old. </s>
<s> Is this true? </s>
<s> Would I be able to run Vista with this as long as I updrade the graphics card and the RAM if needed? </s>
<s> Any bad news about this system? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> 300 watt psu is not enough for gfx card upgrade and ram upgrade. </s>
<s> wouldnt recommend upgrading to the x700 anyways. </s>
<s> would suggest upgrading to the 7800gs or better in the future. </s>
<s> also the mobo is not old. </s>
<s> unless u consider maybe a year or less to be old. </s>
<s> and about the vista question. </s>
<s> ya but it just wont be as good. </s>
<s> that is just like someone with a win. </s>
<s> 98 machine then asking whether to upgrade to win. </s>
<s> xp. </s>
<s> of course it can run but not as good as a pc that is designed specifically for vista. </s>
<s> This system is an excellent buy for those who need great tech on the cheap. </s>
<s> Saw the video, and the motherboard is new. </s>
<s> Has a socket 939 good for future a future CPU, and a x16 pcie slot, which allows you to upgrade to a future graphics card. </s>
<s> With the addition of 4gb of RAM, it should be able to handle Vista like nothing. </s>
<s> Of course the 300 watt PSU is nothing so you will have to upgrade to a 500 watt PSU or better. </s>
<s> All in all this system is a great buy. </s>
<s> Since for the moment i will not be using it for demanding things i think i am ok with this PC. </s>
<s> I was wondering if this PC, right after i buy it, be able to play the Sims 2? </s>
<s> i have this game on a 3.0 P4 with hyperthreading and 256mb of RAM and it is just to slow to play comfortable. </s>
<s> But with this system, will i be able to run it smoothly? </s>
<s> Will run just fine on this system as it is from the factory. </s>
<s> To upgrade the video card to a PCI-e card, you may, or may not need a more powerful psu. </s>
<s> For PCI-e, ATI recommends a minimum of 350 watts. </s>
<s> I put a 400 watt psu in my 6524 to go with the ATI X800XL card I upgraded to. </s>
<s> Upgrading the psu is a 5 minute job, very easy to do even for a novice. </s>
<s> The system takes a standard atx power supply. </s>
<s> Since you won't use your system for demanding tasks yet, you can run Sims 2 on it. </s>
<s> But you also have the good feeling that you can upgrade in the future to a better processor (socket 939) and a better graphics card. </s>
<s> Just get a more power puwer suppply unit and you will be fine. </s>
<s> Probably some more dual-cores 5000+, 5200+, and fx-60 and that's it. </s>
<s> bye bye to socket 939. </s>
<s> you need more ram! </s>
<s> 256 is not enough! </s>
<s> i run 1024 and it handles anything! </s>
<s> also what card of video card do u have? </s>
<s> So the 939 is getting ditched, so I should get a new motherboard now or later? </s>
<s> Also lmao I don' think it will be the fx-60 but the fx-59. </s>
<s> Dominican doesn't want to run anything to intensive, so the Sims 2 should work fine on this emachines system. </s>
<s> I would say get 512 of memory to make this system work better since you don't need bleeding edge performance. </s>
<s> Ummm, perhaps you weren't aware or did not check the specs of this system? </s>
<s> It comes with 1 GB of RAM, that's 1024Mb. </s>
<s> Now 128Mb of that is shared with the onboard 3D video chipset, leaving a still respectable 896Mb of system memory. </s>
<s> Still enough to handle most tasks and even games reasonably well. </s>
<s> Sims2 is no hassle to this system even as it comes from the factory. </s>
<s> Wow this is an emachines to get. </s>
<s> With a serious graphics card, and a better processor this can a pretty serious gaming machine. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> but for some serious gaming on this emachines, you would need something like an Fx or an X2. </s>
<s> have been tested already. </s>
<s> I knew that the RAM was slow but I just wanted to have a comparison. </s>
<s> I got the low-end FX5200 APG graphics card. </s>
<s> I know its not that good either </s>
<s> I only need RAM on my now Dell PC. </s>
<s> It only has 256 RAM. </s>
<s> I am just trying to find out if the Emachines would run it. </s>
<s> Emachines aren't as good as they sound. </s>
<s> I've worked on 2 people's emachines and they were both...odd. </s>
<s> The one tried to upgrade the video card, with a pci card instead of the agp 4x it came with. </s>
<s> the bios wouldn't ever see the card, neither would windows. </s>
<s> but the card worked fine in my system... </s>
<s> The specs look fine, if all you wantta do is play sims 2 then go right ahead, you won't need to upgrade, vista will prolly go fine too, but if you wanta get into real games like doom3 or call of duty 2 then you might wanna get a Dell or an Hp... or build your own! </s>
<s> most educational thing you can do. </s>
<s> and i have never heard of anyone sticking a dual core processor or an fx into an emachines. </s>
<s> i dont think u can even install the x2 unless there is a bios flash posted somewhere on the net. </s>
<s> Umm .. sorry, hate to tell you this .. but ... </s>
<s> Call of Duty 2 runs fantastically on my eMachines T6524. </s>
<s> You're right of course ... a PCI video card wouldn't do much good on an AGP system. </s>
<s> AGP is a form of PCI bus designed for higher speed video. </s>
<s> An AGP 4X motherboard would not recognize an 8x card either. </s>
<s> PCI-e is twice as fast as AGP 8x. </s>
<s> Of course Windows would not see what the system's BIOS does not support. </s>
<s> PCI-e works like a charm in the eMachines T6524 which has a motherboard and BIOS that supports PCI-e. </s>
<s> Odd? </s>
<s> eMachines used to be extremely proprietary years ago. </s>
<s> Just as HP which you suggest. </s>
<s> HP is the only OEM that has a boot strap program that checks memory modules for a special chip that just says it's HP memory. </s>
<s> HP does NOT make memory, they just license a memory company to put the special chip on the modules labeled as HP. </s>
<s> Talk about proprietary ... which I believe is what you mean by &quot;odd&quot;. </s>
<s> As for Dell, they have the absolute worst customer support now, all off-shore ... meaning India. </s>
<s> Good luck getting help from them. </s>
<s> Dell, used to be fantastic, my Dimension 4100 866 MHz still runs just fine 5 years later. </s>
<s> It's just too slow to handle high speed DSL. </s>
<s> Oh, eMachines' support, by the way, is in northern California. </s>
<s> They speak English there. </s>
<s> Yes, Vista should run just fine on the new eMachines systems. </s>
<s> Of course though, no one knows what Vista will require yet. </s>
<s> But the T6524 exceeds the advance release specs for Vista. </s>
<s> I might add that I did NOT like my mother-in-law's eMachines system from 5 years ago. </s>
<s> The seal that voided warranty if broken when you opened the case was ridiculous. </s>
<s> Now, eMachines gives full instructions for opening the case, and their tech support will assist you if needed ... at no charge other than the possible toll phone call. </s>
<s> The new ones though are great. </s>
<s> Oh yeah ... and they also use the same motherboard and CPU that HP / Compaq uses in their new systems. </s>
<s> If the Dell system you have uses DDR PC3200 RAM, then you could possibly use it in the new eMachines. </s>
<s> If it uses something other, which is more likely the case, then No. </s>
<s> DDR is not the same as PC100 or PC133 RAM. </s>
<s> They are not mix and match. </s>
<s> DDR is not that expensive either. </s>
<s> You can easily pick up two 512 Mb modules to add 1 Gigabyte for under $100, or two 1 Gb modules to add 2 Gb for a total of 3 Gb with the factory installed 1 Gb for under $200. </s>
<s> I used to build my own custom work horse systems. </s>
<s> I can't buy the parts and build the tower for what this machine sells for. </s>
<s> I just purchased one of these on November 4th, I upgraded the ram to 2 gig for Photoshop, swapped the power supply to an Antec. </s>
<s> Did I tell you I was an Intel or Nuttin person till I tried this AMD based machine? </s>
<s> So far no complaints other than the pre loaded software....too much stuff. </s>
<s> This is a great buy and from what I have researched, EMachines have turned a corner and are producing better quality than in the past. </s>
<s> I like the fact you buy the tower without a monitor. </s>
<s> So far so good. </s>
<s> dittomax only know enough about all this to be dangerous </s>
<s> To run the Sims 2 properly, you should have at least 512 MB of RAM. </s>
<s> Does your computer have integrated graphics?? </s>
<s> If it does, then you should buy a seperate video card. </s>
<s> Integrated graphics borrows system memory (RAM) do to the graphics work. </s>
<s> You don't want this. </s>
