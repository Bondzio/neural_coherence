<s> Using Vista Home Premium I've got a D-Link Dir628 router equipped with a USB printer port. </s>
<s> All is well when it is working. </s>
<s> However, at irregular intervals, the router and the printer do not communicate. </s>
<s> The only way I can restore communication is to toggle the power on the router, then all is well until the next time this happens. </s>
<s> I've seen various references to USB printing problems on routers on this and other forums. </s>
<s> Has anyone found a solution? </s>
<s> What is the printer? </s>
<s> What type of Computer and what is the OS? </s>
<s> Is this supposed to be a wifi printer hook up? </s>
<s> Need some more information. </s>
