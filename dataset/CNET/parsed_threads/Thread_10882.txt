<s> Hi I have bought this hard disk about 1 week ago, and since then I have 2 problems. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> I have received this error for several times: http://www.imagedoll.com/out.php/i1405_untitled.jpg More details in the event viewer: Windows Disk Diagnostic detected a S.M.A.R.T. </s>
<s> fault on disk SAMSUNG HD502HJ ATA Device (volumes C:\;D:\;E:\). </s>
<s> This disk might fail; back up your computer now. </s>
<s> All data on the hard disk, including files, documents, pictures, programs, and settings might be lost if your hard disk fails. </s>
<s> To determine if the hard disk needs to be repaired or replaced, contact the manufacturer of your computer. </s>
<s> If you can't back up (for example, you have no CDs or other backup media), you should shut down your computer and restart when you have backup media available. </s>
<s> In the meantime, do not save any critical files to this disk. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> For several times, at windows, suddenly the picture got noisy and the sound hanged up(like cd's scratch), and 1 second after, this blue screen showed up: http://www.imagedoll.com/out.php/i1461_30062010.jpg I've re-installed the windows, changed the PSU in use, but none of them worked. </s>
<s> The problem is here that every diagnostic software I used, has never detected any problem. </s>
<s> HD Tune Pro, Speedfan, HDDLife and even ES Tool (which is Samsung's diagnostic utility) says my hard disk is healthy and no problem was found. </s>
<s> How can I diagnose if this is from hard disk or not? </s>
<s> Any help is strongly appreciated! </s>
<s> We swap in a new drive. </s>
<s> The discussions about this are legendary and why Windows does that hangup is well discussed. </s>
<s> It's your choice to use the drive till it fails. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Could you please insert the link of those discussions here? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> It's google.com and ask a question like &quot;What do I do when my hard drive has a SMART failure?&quot; All this is your choice and money. </s>
<s> Some don't rely on their PCs or don't have much to lose when the drive fails. </s>
<s> The nice part about SMART is the early warning. </s>
<s> It's just that. </s>
<s> It does not tell you that it will die tomorrow or last 2 more years. </s>
<s> But that Windows failure is telling me that it's sooner than later. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> http://www.eggheadcafe.com/software/aspnet/32844088/how-to-stop-smart-failure-detection-.aspx finds the usual owner that disbelieves that SMART is so smart. </s>
<s> There's not much you can do for them but wait for the end. </s>
