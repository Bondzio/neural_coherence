<s> I am looking into maybe getting a new computer in the near future. </s>
<s> I have only used Pentiums before and I was looking into maybe getting a Athlon. </s>
<s> How does the Athlon 64 compare to the Pentium 4? </s>
<s> I have heard that Athlons are better for gaming, but Pentiums are better for video rendering, editing and such. </s>
<s> I was wondering what the Athlon equivalents to the Pentium were? </s>
<s> I figure that this might be it, can someone confirm or correct it for me? </s>
<s> Pentium 3.0 Ghz = Athlon64 3000+ Pentium 3.2 Ghz = Athlon64 3200+ Pentium 3.4 Ghz = Athlon64 3500+ Pentium 3.6 Ghz = Athlon64 3800+ Pentium 3.8 Ghz = Athlon64 4000+ Pentium 4 Extreme Edition = Athlon FX-55 </s>
<s> that list is solid except the FX-55 is way ahead of the extreme edition...they are't exactly equal throughout but fairly close </s>
<s> me to suggest waiting a few months until the picture regarding Intel and AMD Dual Core CPU's becomes clear. </s>
<s> Intel's are already out. </s>
<s> One issue with AMD would be whether or not their's will support DDR2 memory. </s>
<s> The present AMD 64 bit CPU's do not. </s>
<s> Their memory controller is doing quite well with old dusty DDRAM. </s>
<s> I don't have a link handy, but its worth noting that AMD did some magic in this area. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I've noticed that Pentiums and Athlons have very different clock speeds, FX-55 is only 2.2Ghz I think... </s>
<s> So what I don't really get is how a 1.8Ghz Athlon64 3000+ can be compared with a Pentium 4 3.0Ghz </s>
<s> The chip is just faster as the pentiums have a front side bus, while the athlons have something different called hypertransport which is faster then intel's fsb substantially, and the architecture of the chip is a lot better than intel, so even with a low clock speed the chip is fast. </s>
<s> Just like apple, they have low clock speeds yet they are very fast. </s>
<s> Clock speeds are becoming a stereotype! </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> thanks for the info </s>
<s> those are what is SUPPOSED to work BUT AMD's PR is a little bit off the Athlon64 3800+ is directly equal to the 3.8GHZ not the 4000+ (the 4000+ really has no rival, as Intel canned the 4GHZ P4 (that is what it was supposed to compete with) so it's just a high power chip with no real rival (as the EE chips are too expensive to compete, and the 3.8 isn't fast enough) but in gaming performance the Athlon64 vs Pentium4 is rather different the 3200+ may be comparable to say, the 3.4GHZ or the 3.6 </s>
<s> while clock speeds don't mean much and the K8 architecture is good (Pentium 4's architecture isn't bad, it just needs REALLY high speeds to get worthy performance (the 3.8gHZ is faster than anything Intel has (it beats the Smithfield dual 3.2 in some things) because it actually effectivly uses the Prescott design (but it's very hot, so Intel is trying to end it (PRescott only shines at over 3600MHZ, and at over 3600MHZ it also glows hot red, a 4000MHZ chip would've needed a rather good cooling solution) but another thing that affects performance in gaming (Especially) and other things is the IPC (Integer per clock iirc, not entirely sure on the meanigns of the letters though) basically it's how many operations the chip can do per clock cycle the Athlon64 FX-55 is 2.6GHZ, meaning 2600MHZ or 2600 million operations per second it does roughly 9 IPC (so it's 9x2600 million...) and 3 of those IPC are FPU operations 3 are ALU and i forget what the last 3rd is (it's always cut into thirds, ALU, FPU and i forget (like i said) what the last one is) Pentium 4 does 6 IPC so a 3.8GHZ 570J is doing 6x3800 million that is one of many factors the bus speed thing also affects it (Pentium 4's with an 800 FSB or higher are basically immune to FSB lag, as it gives them a HUGE throughput (at 200 FSB (intel quadpiped the P4, so it's labled as 800FSB) the P4 can achive 6400MB/s (6.4GB/s) of communication bandwidth (Which is rather impressive) while the 400 FSB chips only achive half that Athlon64 isn't limited by FSB and has a rather good memory controller (i believe bobm entionted that in this thread) which aids it's performance Athlon64 (K8) is a great architecture it's efficient fast and the chips are easier to produce (3800MHZ is hard for any chip, the chips that actually pass and become 570J's is probably a small number compared to those that fail and become 560's, 540's, and lower) in general it's a battle of architecture P4 is designed for high clock speed, with a weak FPU which hurts it in gaming, yet helps it in video editing (the clock speed does, and the long pipeline) while Athlon64 is designed for performance, has a very strong FPU, and does great in gaming, and good in video editing/encoding (not beating the P4, but it's not a slug) this isn't to say a 2.8ghz P4 could kill an FX-55 in encoding or editing it couldnt i'm saying comparable chips like the 3.73EE vs the FX-55 the FX-55 would win in gaming the 3.73EE would win in video editing/encoding/rendering type things (most of the time) just go by PR if your buying a chip the chart he made is generally useful another tool is this http://www23.tomshardware.com/index.html </s>
<s> really appreciate it, thanks all </s>
<s> I Gathered This Information: AMD Athlon 64 (Socket 754, Socket 939): + Shorter/ Wider Pipelines (Better for Games) + Bigger L1 Cache + More IPCs (Instructions Per Cycles) + New, HTT (Hyper Transport, Full Duplex, 16x16 point to point link, high in bandwidth) + Integrated Memory Controller (Memory controller onto the chip) + Better 64bit Extension + Cool n Quiet + Awesome Branch Prediction + Lacks Hyper Threading + Price/ Performance chips Intel Penitum4 (Socket 478, Socket 775): + Longer/ Narrower Pipelines (Better for CAD/ Audio Encoding) + Less L1 Cache + Less IPCs + Still having FSB, Half Duplex + No Integrated Memory Controller + Not so good 64bit Extension (EM64T) (6xx Series) + Still having issues with heat + Branch Prediction not efficient, again due to higher frequencies + Hyper Threading (Proved much better for Multithreaded applications) + Expensive Chips What's the pipeline, and how does it make a difference? </s>
<s> Also, I saw this example about the IPC, it said something like this: AMD is like a 18-wheeler truck taking a large load at a slower pace, Intel is like a Formula One car taking a small load at a quick pace. </s>
<s> Is this correct? </s>
<s> I just noticed that there was a Athlon64 3700+, does that compete with the 3.6 Pentium? </s>
<s> Also, I see all these things at the end of the processor, like Venice, Winchester, Clawhammer and San Diego, what do they mean? </s>
<s> They're the cores. </s>
<s> Clawhammers are the FXs. </s>
<s> Venice are the newest and the newcastles is specifically for the AMD older 3800+s. </s>
<s> As for the winchester and san diego, i think they're older cores. </s>
<s> I've never heard of san diego, but winchesters are still sold... Roger </s>
<s> are new as well </s>
<s> I wonder if it'll ever be released as dual-cores are just over the horizon. </s>
<s> Though, there are no games that can run more than one thread. </s>
<s> A new FX chip. </s>
<s> Wonder what'll it be called? </s>

<s> Whats the difference between the Venice and Winchester cores? </s>
<s> How come AMD's beat the crap out of Intels in gaming, but Intels beat AMD in multitasking and video encoding? </s>
<s> What should I get? </s>
<s> I hear that Athlon beats the crap out of Intel in gaming, but Intel wins in video editing/encoding and multitasking. </s>
<s> If I'm looking for all of that, what should I go with? </s>
<s> wait for the amd dual core? </s>
<s> or if u don't have the cash for that, go with a socket 939 3800+ or 4000+ </s>
<s> Well, asking me about AMD &quot;beating the Crap out of Intel in gaming...&quot;...LOL. </s>
<s> To be practical that is in the eye of the kiddies, especially those who think they should and need the absolute top of the line, no matter what it cost. </s>
<s> Braggards and professional gamers may select AMD, but IMO excellent high quality gaming can come from many different Intel based computers and a Athlon 64 4000 or FX 55 is not necessary. </s>
<s> Intel now has 64-bit support and should be coming out with more choices in their Pentium D Dual Processors. </s>
<s> The recent AMD Dual Processors should also be showing up. </s>
<s> There will be games to come out in the future based on the 64-bit tech and dual processors. </s>
<s> I will be waiting quite a while for prices to stabilize, but if you can't wait that long perhaps you can wait a little while thinking of dual processors. </s>
<s> Perhaps there will be dual processors with dual video cards for the real high end dollar users, but if I have a choice, I'll go for a single video card and dual processors. </s>
