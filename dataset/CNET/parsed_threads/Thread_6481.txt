<s> I bought computer parts and try to assemble several PCs in my work place. </s>
<s> I successfully did it for several PCs. </s>
<s> But only in one PC when I try to install windows XP home edition it took lot of time to install OS and installation screen shows it is try to install network drivers. </s>
<s> In bottom left hand corner it shows approximately 32 minutes remaining to complete installation. </s>
<s> But installation is not proceeding from this point onwards after two hours time also. </s>
<s> Then I try to install OS changing default BIOS settings. </s>
<s> I disabled onboard LAN and try to install OS. </s>
<s> In that case above problem doesnt occur. </s>
<s> After installing OS I enabled onboard LAN and try to connect to network but onboard LAN unable to send or receive packets. </s>
<s> It takes lot of time to assign IP address to PC and gives message status- Limited or No Connectivity. </s>
<s> Then I tried to Repair it, but in that case also I got error mentioning problem in repair IP. </s>
<s> I dont think there is problem a with network cable or default gateway, because other computers in network which has same configuration can access internet without any problem. </s>
<s> I dont know how to solve this problem. </s>
<s> Can you please help me to fix this problem? </s>
<s> Given what's in your post, nothing was told about the hardware so nothing specific can be written. </s>
<s> That's quite a long post to write and not supply the make/models. </s>
<s> If I were to guess I would guess you install Windows but not the motherboard driver package. </s>

<s> Machine configuration as follows: 1. </s>
<s> I already try to update onboard LAN drive using motherboard CD. </s>
<s> It also doesnt solve my problem. </s>
<s> It takes lot of time to assign IP address to PC. </s>
<s> Then gives message status- Limited or No Connectivity. </s>
<s> Then I tried to Repair it, but in that case also I got error mentioning cant repair IP. </s>
<s> Also I tried to update network driver using motherboard CD which provided with motherboard. </s>
<s> Then I tried to assign IP, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS manually. </s>
<s> In that case also it takes lot of time to assign IP address to PC. </s>
<s> After I restart PC, IP and other information taken as what I manually set. </s>
<s> Then I can ping to 127.0.0.1, machine IP and localhost successfully, but cannot ping to default gateway. </s>
<s> I think there is no problem in with network cable or default gateway, because other computers in network which has same configuration can access internet without any problem. </s>
<s> Your posts don't tell much about the hardware (make/model, more.) </s>
<s> I can share that most drivers on CD are outdated. </s>
<s> I've seen the repair fail on the driver from CD and work when we use the fixed driver from the motherboard maker's web site. </s>
<s> A complete post could help narrow it down but my guess here is a bum Windows install. </s>
<s> Microsoft does not fetch proper drivers. </s>
<s> That's for us to do. </s>
<s> It's also possible there is some wiring issue to the router or other device. </s>
<s> But that's easy to test by using this wiring with a known good machine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Latest BIOS from ASROCK. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Latest Drivers from ASROCK. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Test your wiring with another machine. </s>
<s> And I don't recall you telling about your network. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Im not much understood about this problem. </s>
<s> That is why Im asking this question. </s>
<s> Is it possible to work onboard LAN without any problem in one machine and giving problem in other machine which has same software and hardware configurations? </s>
<s> That is BIOS version, Driver versions, installed software, RAM, HD, VGA, etc same in both machines. </s>
<s> I used same wiring and connect other machine which has same configuration. </s>
<s> Then it works without any problem. </s>
<s> Therefore I think there is no problem in wiring. </s>
<s> But it almost sounds as if you cloned the hard disk? </s>
<s> How odd. </s>
<s> Did you not tell something here? </s>
<s> And how are those driver updates going? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Im not familiar with cloning. </s>
<s> This is how I did OS and other software installation for machine. </s>
<s> Just assemble machine using parts. </s>
<s> Switch on the machine. </s>
<s> Load default BIOS settings. </s>
<s> Insert windows XP CD to CDROM and install OS. </s>
<s> After finishing OS installation I install drivers for devices which are not correctly installed from OS CD. </s>
<s> Then I register and activate windows using internet. </s>
<s> Every machine I used auto configure for IP settings. </s>
<s> an electronic device is susceptible to static.. so even a new MB can be zap without warning... Beside, Not every MB sold out there are in good condition. </s>
<s> Try external Network adaptor... and see if that works... then you know what is the problem.. </s>
<s> XP has no defenses so I wonder if you need to try again. </s>
<s> If you were able to activate then the internet was working at that step. </s>
<s> Next time, a firewall, antivirus BEFORE connecting to the internet. </s>
<s> Your install method is common, but flawed. </s>
<s> You are relying on Microsoft for drivers. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I tried to install PCI network card and its working without any problem. </s>
<s> That means problem with onboard LAN. </s>
<s> Thank you very much for you all for valuable comments to solve my problem. </s>
<s> after re install windows in day one it works fine but after 24h i have same problem .... cpu : 8450 Phenom main board :abit AN78HD main chip : MCP78 </s>

<s> ..bios reset ..7 X reinstalling many ver of windows XP and Vista and &gt;&gt; http://tinypic.ws/files/26ujyky527c9q1blqz8v.jpg i $$$$ for this mainboard(abit an78HD) and ..... why i most pay $$$$$ and buy a new network card ????????????????? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> install latest driver from nvidia clear CMOS (bios) memory... install TCP-IP repair &gt;&gt;&gt; KB884020 (you can download it from microsoft.com) and it work </s>

<s> yes . </s>
<s> i got it i posted this prob to microsoft forum and they solved my prob my prob has been solved with removing PCI(DVB&quot;Comporo Video mate&quot;). </s>
