i tried earlier plugging my laptop directly into the router and attempting to update the firmware.
i downloaded the latest version 2.24 and when i attempted to open the file on the router page to load the new firmware version, it didn't work and told me that the version i was attempting to upload may be corrupt and that the gateway would not be updated.
i will attempt to change the ssid to something more simple.
