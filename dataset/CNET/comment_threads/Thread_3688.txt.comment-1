Can anyone provide some information on wireless cable modems?
Do they eliminate the need for a wireless router between the modem and the computer?
Any recommendations on a model.
I've seen different reports on Motorola's SBG900 and SBG1000.
I need to hook up my existing modem via USB rather than Ethernet.
Is there any performance difference between a wireless cable modem and a standard cable modem with wireless router.
Thanks Steve Rehmann
