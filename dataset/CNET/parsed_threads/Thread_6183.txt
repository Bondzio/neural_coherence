<s> The only way we can use our Motorola router is unencrypted. </s>
<s> I have gone into the router numerous times and reset it, unplugged it, retyped the WEP key, tried to shift to WPA and nothing works. </s>
<s> None of three computers in the house will connect unless all encryption is off. </s>
<s> We live in a good neighborhood on a cul de sac, don't get a lot of traffic through here, and know the immediate neighbors, but nothing is stopping a stranger with a laptop from sitting on the street and using our wifi. </s>
<s> I've talked to the Comcast tech. </s>
<s> The trouble just seems to be our boxes won't get past the WEP encryption stage. </s>
<s> Has anyone had this problem? </s>
<s> Motorola has both a Modem/router and a stand-alone wireless router, which one do you have and what is the model number. </s>
<s> But it was when my SSID was odd or I tried to use MAC filtering too. </s>
<s> Tell more. </s>
<s> It's the Surfboard SBG900 router and modem. </s>
<s> My SSID is one simple word. </s>
<s> Sorry but I would need to know all 20 settings to see if that's it. </s>
<s> I never set up MAC filtering. </s>
<s> Default is no filtering, yes? </s>
<s> As the makers can change anything, if we can't see all settings we'll have to go with bum router. </s>
<s> It could be as simple as the old hidden SSID issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> My computer finds my strong router signal when instructed to search for wireless networks within range then lists two from my neighbors with weak or non existent signal. </s>
<s> Two boxes in the house run just fine on wireless with no encryption. </s>
<s> But as it stands, everything points to bad setting or bum router. </s>
