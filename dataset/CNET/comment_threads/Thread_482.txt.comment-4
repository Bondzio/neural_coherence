You asked for the maker and that's what's on one here.
The keyboard has English key tops.
The unit may have been boxed as a PS2 USB Keyboard which had some other name such as KingMax on it.
All this confuses the issues here since it's a generic product with many suppliers and in many packages.
Let me ask if the maker is a needed piece of information to purchase such a keyboard?
I picked these up at EBGames, Best Buy but don't venture to Circuit City so I can't answer that.
