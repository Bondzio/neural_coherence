hi i just made a new system with the following: .intel p4 3.4ghz .asus p5wd2-premium i955p pentium d 4xddr2 raid pci-ex glan lga775 .ddr2 512mb cm2x512a-5400ul xms2 .western digital 160g sataii 7200 rpm hdd .zalman copper heatsink fan.
.4 case fans cpu runs at about 57 degrees celcius, my case is a antec p180, but for some reason really slow boot???
sometimes my pc hangs once the 1st bios screen loads its the newest bios available but still takes well over a minute to boot up and load windows and msn messenger any ideas on how to boot faster?
?
