<s> I recently bought a DVD +/- RW DL. </s>
<s> I am trying to copy DVD movies for my kids so they do not destroy the origionals. </s>
<s> I cannot do it with NERO 6. </s>
<s> Are there any programs that will let me do this? </s>
<s> I thought NERO was the best and easiest program to use. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> rather it's because the dvd are copy protected. </s>
<s> will do what you want. </s>
<s> DVDSanta is a purchase program on the internet and is very simple to use...DVDShrink is free on the internet and has pretty good instructions on how to use it properly. </s>
<s> TONI </s>
<s> fo a site for DVDShrink, http://www.filehippo.com/download_dvdshrink/ Chris L </s>
<s> Does the recode program come with NERO 6? </s>
<s> I installed the program that came with my DVD recorder, and then I updated it. </s>
<s> I think it is now NERO 6. </s>
<s> I'm unsure why it's needed. </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> If you have Nero 6 Ultra in there, I can safely give you the site to get it. </s>
<s> It is the NeroVision Express 3, package 2. </s>
<s> I had to remove NERO MediaHome,NERO Photosnap (take your photos out of the computer, it did mess with mine), NERO Photosnap Viewer & NERO Showtime (I have PowerDVD). </s>
<s> All on theis link is the updated version of 4.4.1.4 and everything is updates at: http://www.nero.com/us/nero-up.php/ PS - I was incorrect about needing both. </s>
<s> In a magazine I get, it has DVDShrink, NERO Recode, AnyDVD, Intervideo DVD Copy 4, DVD Dycrypter and #1 DVD Ripper (add DVD Santa to that!!) </s>
<s> This magazine has instructions on how to build a laptop with what you want in it. </s>
<s> Broke hip in Dec 2005 and wound up getting it, sent card from rehab. </s>

<s> Found it won't copy write protected DVD's. </s>
<s> It might work with DVDShrink but I don't know if it was the DVD or DVDShrink that had my computer going around - had to shut down and go into safe mode to resolve problem though that update I mistyped and version is 6.6.1.4, if yours is ver.6.6.0.14, it is the first one but the latter is Jan. 31, 2006 Darrell L. </s>
<s> her's the thing, dvd shrink will pull files off a dvd (and you can then view them on your pc) but has no software for writing dvd's-- instaed it looks for nero's dvd writing software and if you don't have it it tells you to install nero. </s>
<s> be advised, home burned dvd's in my experience work pretty well on most nachines but they don't last very long. </s>
<s> after a few months they get funky and unplayable. </s>

<s> Have a look here if your problem is copy protection. </s>
<s> Please be aware that copying is only legal for personal backup to preserve originals. </s>
<s> I'm just trying to make back-up copies because the boys WILL mess the origionals up. </s>
<s> I,ll try the URL you sent me. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot. </s>
<s> could be the downfall for copying dvd movies as well. </s>
<s> Newer dvd burners, dvd players, audio players, and television sets are all being manufactured that will be able to detect burned illegal copies and won't play them. </s>
<s> You either will get nada, zip, zero on screen or silence in an audio player or you will get a screen saying to put in a new disc because the disc can't be read. </s>
<s> Before you waste money and time burning dvd's, try one and play it immediately to see what results you get on screen or in an audio player. </s>
<s> You may be able to play them on your pc, but nothing else. </s>
<s> Making copies of anything copyrighted is illegal in the USA...even backup copies. </s>
<s> The reason being is that if you can make one copy as a backup you can just as easily make many for pirating. </s>
<s> When you consider that even hardware, such as a video or sound card, is copyrighted, there is nothing to stop a hardware maker from charging for newer drivers rather than make them available for free as a download...I think some of these copyright laws make no sense at all and they covered too large a canvas with that sweeping brush they used to paint the law in their haste to protect music and movies. </s>

<s> Glad to be of help. </s>
