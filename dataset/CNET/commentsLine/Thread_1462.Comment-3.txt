found this on another forum and it worked for my dell 1501, hope it works or you.
disable the ati hotkey poller service in windows.
go to start-&gt;control panel-&gt;administrative tools-&gt;services you should see the ati hotkey poller services listed.
right click on it and select properties.
halfway down the screen you should see the &quot;startup type.&quot; choose disabled from the drop-down list, click apply, close out all applications and reboot.
this should resolve your issues.
