the originals should be fine so why not wipe and start over?
unless this is not a backup and is instead &quot;storage.&quot; in this forum we have some resolutions and fixes.
here they are in quick fire form.
1. remove the drive and place it as slave in a desktop.
2. copy the files out.
3. not showing up?
try each of these titles found with google.
a. getdataback b. zero assumption recovery 4.  usually does a great job.
but is this a backup or storage is the real question.
if backup, that's one thing.
but storage you will find you need a backup plan.
