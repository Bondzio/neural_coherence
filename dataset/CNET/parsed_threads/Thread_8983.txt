<s> Hello, I'm attempting to use my old desktop in a new work situation and am looking to beef it up as much as I possibly can with such an old system. </s>
<s> I've never done any upgrades to items like the processor. </s>
<s> How do I know what processors my motherboard will handle and other such info? </s>
<s> My system is about 5 years old at this point, an HP Pavilion 8575c (more detailed specs at - http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/genericDocument?lc=en&cc=us&docname=bph05190#top ) Can somebody explain this to me or point me in the direction of some documentation to help? </s>
