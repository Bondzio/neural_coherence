1.1.1	Hello everybody, I'm planning to buy an iMac G5 in a couple of months and I've been reading some feedback on the product from other users.	St
1.1.2	I like the elegant desing of the iMac G5 but I'm worried about a possible fried system because of the tiny all in one integrated design.	St
1.1.3	That concern comes to mind after reading some users said that the system has not lasted more than 30 days before frying.	St
1.1.4	My concern is greater since I don't live in the U.S. and a refund or system change is more difficult overseas and the investment is too much to take such a risk.	St
1.1.5	I read that consumers should not buy first generation Apple products because they always fail.	St
1.1.6	Is this true?	St
1.1.7	Should I wait a little more?	Sug
1.1.8	I haven't heard from Apple explaining possible issues about the heating factor on the new iMac G5.	St
1.1.9	Many users have complain that it has a noisy fan and its performance is not like the one advertised by Apple in the first place.	St
1.1.10	I like the space saving design and upgrading capabilities of the iMac G5 and I would like to buy one.	St
1.1.11	What do you guys recomend me about the possible heating and fry factor?	Ques
1.1.12	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Hi, I can see you concern about the difficulties of returns and system changes.	St
1.2.2	However, I think that Apple has the required infrastructure in place for all the places that it sells equipment to.	St
1.2.3	You have not said where in the world you live so I cannot be more specific.	St
1.2.4	First generation machines are always a little suspect but the iMac G5 is no longer a First generation machine.	St
1.2.5	It has been updated at least twice.	St
1.2.6	I know of 8 iMac G5 owners and none of them have had any problem with their machines.	St
1.2.7	Do some more reading and remember, you only hear about the fried few and never about the working thousands.	St
1.2.8	Good Luck P	St
1.3.1	Hello, One of my co-workers purchased a new iMac G5 over six months ago and loves it.	St
1.3.2	No problems ever.	St
1.3.3	I think that Apple did their job on this one.	St
1.3.4	Yet, he leaves his toaster oven on repeatedly.	St
1.3.5	He will probably burn his house down some day.	St
1.3.6	He does not use his iMac for frying eggs in the morning either.	St
1.3.7	Seriously, on the other hand, another co-worker bought one of the brand-new iMac G4s before and has had a lot of problems with it for over a year.	St
1.3.8	But, not overheating.	St
1.3.9	Mostly software issues.	St
1.3.10	Where in the world did you hear the feedback that the iMac G5 overheated and fried?	St
1.3.11	I would like to know please?	St
1.3.12	Need facts and documentation!	St
1.3.13	If it is true, than I think that it could become the next George Forman Fry-O-Lator!	St
1.3.14	Foodnetwork.com could be selling them next.	St
1.3.15	I think that I am getting hungry with all this frying stuff.	St
1.3.16	Is it also good for toasting crumpets also?	St
1.3.17	Thought that I would keep the discussion light.	St
1.3.18	:) Kevin	St
1.4.1	Hi, Yes, my concern about the returns and refunds is a bit higher than purchasing an iMac living in the U.S.	St
1.4.2	I live in Central America.	St
1.4.3	We do not have Apple stores over here, only distributors.	St
1.4.4	Their sells and systems have guarantee of course but I will not be purchasing one to them cuz is a lot money to spend.	St
1.4.5	I want to buy my iMac G5 directly from the Apple website.	St
1.4.6	It's good to know that the iMac G5 has been updated at least twice and according to your buddies none of them has had any problems with the overheating factor.	St
1.4.7	That will be my first Mac since I wanna change from Mac to Windows because I'm tired of all the updating thing and spyware, viruses, OS inestability, etc.	St
1.4.8	Regarding of the feedback I read, yes, there were some people who had troubles with their Mac's cuz of the overheating factor.	St
1.4.9	Of course I will do more reading but I wanted some opinion of this community.	St
1.4.10	Thank you for your help.	St
1.5.1	I had a lot of fun reading your post.	St
1.5.2	Well, the feedback I read was from CNET's users opinion on the new iMac G5.	St
1.5.3	I want to make something clear too.	St
1.5.4	Out of the 450 something... opinions about the product, maybe only 10% or 15% were bad.	St
1.5.5	But it happens that almost all the bad opinions were noisy-fan related and that makes you wonder if there could be a problem with an overheating system in the future since the desing is up to such a thing to happen.	St
1.5.6	And about the frying thing, yes, there was some user that affirmed that his system fried due to overheating.	St
1.5.7	But my concern about all of this is that it happens that I can be a person that can face the same situation and since I live in Central America my invesment adquires a higher risk.	St
1.5.8	I hope you guys can understand my concern.	St
1.5.9	I'm not saying exactly that this will happen to me nor do I want you guys to think that I'm overreacting.	St
1.5.10	I just wanna be sure before I make the decision.	St
1.5.11	I will catch up my reading also.	St
1.5.12	Have a nice weekend.	St
1.6.1	There was a problem with a brand new G4 tower that had a bad cooling system and a really noisy fan a year ago at work.	St
1.6.2	Kind of sounded like an air-conditioner starting up.WWWWWRRRRRRWWWWHHHEEERRRR!!!!	St
1.6.3	(Lousy sound effects!)	St
1.6.4	Our company sent it back to Apple and the new G4 replacement was quiet as a Church Mouse.	St
1.6.5	(Bad Fan) If you are worried about getting fried by Apple, don't worry.	St
1.6.6	Apple will replace it!	St
1.6.7	Guaranteed and they do not want any of their apples fried.	St
1.6.8	Baked, maybe, with some brown sugar!	St
1.6.9	I do not think that it would cost you anything to have it returned and sent back for a new iMac-G5 if it ever came to that, being fried.	St
1.6.10	What are the latest CNET reviews on the iMac-G5?	St
1.6.11	As a suggestion, go to about.com and read the reviews on the iMac-G5.	St
1.6.12	About.com has a ton of info also.	St
1.6.13	One other site would be daniweb.com A forum site.	St
1.6.14	Nice!	St
1.6.15	Ask a question and get the answer.	St
1.6.16	Free to join Apple stands behind all of its products.	St
1.6.17	Guaranteed.	St
1.6.18	If you ever had a problem with an Apple product and had to do a replacement, you would probably receive your replacement in the same time as I would living here in New England.	St
1.6.19	Check out the Apple website and distribution.	St
1.6.20	Where do you live in Central America?	Ques
1.6.21	Thanks for your post, Kevin	St
1.7.1	Well, about the CNET's reviews I just did a search on home page (iMac G5) and I clicked on the &quot;all users opinions&quot; button.	St
1.7.2	Thank you for giving info about these sites that can also provide me with feedback on the iMac.	St
1.7.3	I live in El Salvador.	St
1.8.1	Users opinions are sometimes helpful.	St
1.8.2	Try those other sites out also.	St
1.8.3	Good luck.	St
1.8.4	Kevin	St
