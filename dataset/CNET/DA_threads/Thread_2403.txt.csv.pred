1.4.1	Many thanks for your replies .	Polite
1.4.2	Unfortunately I still ca n't get it to work .	St
1.4.3	It 's an IDE drive and at the moment it 's configured as Dual ( Master ) .	St
1.4.4	I 've also tried it configured as Single ( Neutral Position ) and Cable Select .	St
1.4.5	I 've tried it in another USB port .	St
1.4.6	I 've spoken to Akasa and they confirm that there are no Akasa drivers - it uses the Windows one .	St
1.4.7	This appears to be usbstor.sys .	St
1.4.8	I 've tried driver update but Windows says that I have the most up to date one .	St
1.4.9	The Akasa site ( and the Help Line ) say that it should work with Win 7 .	St
1.4.10	The only point here is that the manual that came with the enclosure ( dated 2006 ) only mentions up to Win XP .	St
1.5.1	Did you delete the USB drivers .	St
1.5.2	Delete and reboot system .	St
1.5.3	Try another USB 2 cable .	St
1.6.1	Using another PC , install ( as normal int .	St
1.6.2	HD ) prep the old HD and reformat it , etc..	St
1.6.3	When done , test it using the WD diags provided by the vendor from their support website .	St
1.6.4	If OK , now install in ext .	St
1.6.5	case and use Master as possible setting on HD .	St
1.6.6	This way you eliminate any HD fault here , thus only the ext .	St
1.6.7	case is viewed as faulty if it does n't want to work .	St
1.6.8	The ext .	St
1.6.9	case vendor MUST have given some clue to proper install of HD , if not or lacking , running through the possible cures is problematic at best or worst , their fault .	St
1.6.10	If it still refuses to work and known good HD , then return it .	St
1.6.11	Get another brand and YES , cheap is cheap and your results are why is is so .	St
1.6.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.7.1	I tried the suggestion of using another USB cable and , lo & behold , after uninstalling and starting again the installation apparently worked .	St
1.7.2	Device Manager said it was OK. As it did not show up in Explorer I went to Disk Management which showed that the HD was there but with an unallocated 2044 GB - not a good sign !	St
1.7.3	When I tried to Initialize the HD I got the error message & quot ; The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error. & quot ; I have now decided that enough is enough in trying to recover what is an old , smallish drive .	St
1.7.4	I may try some time in the future the suggestion of finding another PC to try it on , but the problem is now on the back burner .	St
1.7.5	However , many thanks for all the comments .	Polite
1.7.6	It 's nice to find such a helpful forum .	St
