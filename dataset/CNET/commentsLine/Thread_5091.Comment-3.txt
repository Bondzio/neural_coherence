because of their experience in the pc peripheral business and they handle hdds up to 1,000gbs.
i've got 2 acs-100 (with wd320gb hdds) and 1 acs 100 (with seagate 100gb notebook hdd).
the adaptec acs-100 (3.5&quot; usb 2.0), acs-120 (2.5&quot;, usb 2.0), and acs-200 (3.5&quot; usb 2.0 and firewire).
gimme a shout if you any questions.
newegg has a lot to choose from they have better than average product info.
last time i looked, buy.com had the lowest price for the adaptec enclosures.
