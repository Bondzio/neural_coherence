1.1.1	I'm sure this is been asked before, but I will be building this computer.	St
1.1.2	And after it's up and running I will be posting updates to this thread, so take a shot heres your opportunity.	St
1.1.3	I'm looking to build a &quot;Supercomputer&quot;.	St
1.1.4	I am in the position that money is not a concern, but instead of just giving an unlimited budget, I'd like to set a limit at about $8,000 (this includes everything down to the mouse (including keyboard, monitor, everything)).	St
1.1.5	Now, even though I have done this before, I'm running into many problems on specs.	St
1.1.6	It has been about 3 years since the last time I have built a computer from scratch, and of course the technology has changed drastically and is still changing.	St
1.1.7	But I have done this several times in the past.	St
1.1.8	Here's what I'll be using the computer for:	St
1.2.1	as far as P5 goes.	St
1.2.2	Go AMD 64 x2 4800 dual-core.	St
1.2.3	It's much faster than P5.	St
1.2.4	Look for latest benchmarks in CNET.	St
1.2.5	Get OCX Platinum for overclocking.	St
1.2.6	The videos will do nicely.	St
1.2.7	SCSIs are on the way out.	St
1.2.8	Go with dual WD Raptor 10k SATA on a RAID0 array, striped and a 300gb SATA for files.	St
1.2.9	If you are looking for BEST quality in a monitor, get a ViewSonic 21&quot; flat screen or a Samsung.	St
1.2.10	Yes, they are big, but you wanted the best, right?	St
1.2.11	I'll leave the case up to you.	Sug
1.2.12	and life goes on... Jack p.s.	St
1.2.13	For $8K I'd even consider a XEON server...just a thought.	St
1.2.14	;)	St
1.3.1	Wow, 8k in budget; this should be fun.	St
1.3.2	Let's start this Processor- AMD Athlon X2 $4800+ http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1447057&Sku=CP1-A64-4800%20E Graphics Card- 2x BFG GeForce 7800 GTX OC http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1647923&CatId=0 Power Supply Unit- PC Power & Cooling TURBO-COOL 850 SSI http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817703002 Optical Dives- 2x Plextor PX-740UF http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1544661&CatId=0 Sound Card- Creative Labs Sound Blaster X-Fi Elite Pro Sound Card http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1618855&CatId=107 Motherboard- Asus A8N 32-SLI-Deluxe NVIDIA Socket 939 ATX Motherboard http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1645240&CatId=0 Case-Thermaltake Tai-Chi Aluminum Case - Liquid Cooling http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/category/category_slc.asp?CatId=1510 Memory-4x Mushkin Green Line 1024MB PC3200 DDR 400MHz Memory http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1056183 Operating System- Microsoft Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1104919&CatId=672 *This list has some of the most advanced components out in the market and the case even has a liquid cooling system.	St
1.3.3	If you can get all of these components, you will build a super monster gaming machine that you can even overclock to get the maximum performance out of this system.	St
1.3.4	Good luck on this build, reply back for any questions.	Polite

1.5.1	Hard drive- 2x Seagate 300GB HD http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1388892	St
1.6.1	Due sometime in early 2006 is AMD's new socket the M2.	St
1.6.2	This means newer motherboards and AMD processors using the socket M2.	St
1.6.3	Socket M2 I believe is the sucessor to the socket 939 and more powerful processors are going to be using the M2.	St
1.6.4	Although the only components that will be affected by the new socket in my list of hardware for you to get, is the motherboard and the AMD processor both using the socket 939.	St
1.6.5	If you totally want to future proof your PC, I say you wait and get the new motherboard/ processor using the socket M2.	St
1.6.6	As I said, you can still get the other parts such as hard drive, sound card, etc.	St
1.6.7	but may want to hold off getting the motherboard/ processor.	St
1.6.8	Also AMD will be making an AMD X2 4800+ and all of its dual core processors using the M2 socket.	St
1.6.9	If you don't want to wait, that it up to you.	St
1.6.10	As I said you can still get the other hardware for your system.	St
1.7.1	Thanks Eddie.... You have either been thinking about this one one your the fastest researcher around.	St
1.7.2	your info is complete and invaluable, thank you.	Polite
1.7.3	As soon as I have time I will go though the list more thoroughly, but from what I See we are on the same page.	St
1.7.4	Thanks again	St
1.8.1	No problems here and yes weare on the same page .	St
1.8.2	It depends on what components you want, for example you may want a cheaper sound card, etc.	St
1.8.3	This gaming machine will be sick and can handle anything today and down the road for a long long time.	St
1.8.4	I wish I had the chance to build one but so far I am saving up for components.	St
1.8.5	I really hope this build works for you.	St
1.9.1	This is the correct link for the taichi case, although you can still find it on the other link.	St

St
1.12.1	2x 74gb 10,000 rpm and a 500 Hitachi hard drive would be a better setup.	St
1.13.1	This is where I have fallen behind in tech race.	St
1.13.2	I here that a Raid 0 con-fig actually speeds up the seek times, am I correct in this?	St
1.13.3	Can someone explain (or point me in the right direction) in plain English just what this will do for me.	St
1.13.4	Your suggestion of 2x74 plus a 500gb would be the best way to go, should I set up the 74's in ''raid0'' and if so how do I do this?	St
1.13.5	Remember as simply as possible.	St
1.13.6	Thanks for you patience.	St
1.13.7	By the way this is what I have so far.	St
1.13.8	Microsoft Windows XP Professional with Service Pack 2 Thermaltake Tai Chi Liquid Cooled Case - VB5001SNA with/Water Cooling System PC Power & Cooling Turbo-Cool 850 SLI ASUS P5AD2-E delux- mainboard - ATX - i925X 4GB Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM at 667MHz - 4 x 1024MB Mushkin 1024MB 667MHz PC5400 DDR2 Memory Seagate Barracuda 7200.9 500GB Hard Drive	St
1.14.1	Build looks great, see no problems here.	St
1.14.2	Ok about the hard drive question, you set the 2x 74 Raptor (which is the company that makes 10,000 rpm hard drives) 10,000 rpm hard drives in a Raid 0 so it is like making a big 148gb hard drive.	St
1.14.3	People tend to use these hard drives for the OS.	St
1.14.4	Since it is 10,000 rpm, the hard drives spin faster than normal (which is about 7,200 rpm) giving you faster access to your files, etc.	St
1.14.5	The 500gb hard drive would be a seperate hard drive for your games, movies, and other programs that take large space.	St
1.14.6	It is totally up to you on how you want to use your hard drive(s).	St
1.14.7	Monitor looks good; Samsung makes high quality monitors, but I couldn't tell if the monitor is 4ms or 8ms.	St
1.14.8	The &quot;ms&quot; is the response time for an LCD.	St
1.14.9	8ms is the standard for gaming with an LCD or watching movies.	St
1.14.10	Their are LCDs out with 4ms response times, which is significantly better.	St
1.14.11	Any questions, reply back.	St
1.15.1	Honestly you have been great except I expect more people to chime in on this discussion.	St
1.15.2	doesn't everyone have their own design just waiting for the time and money?	St
1.15.3	Anyway I think I am finally getting it, as far as the Raid config is concerned.	St
1.15.4	thanks again.	Polite
1.15.5	As far as the Monitor, as far as I can tell (and I have read many reviews and tests) it has a 6ms seek time.	St
1.15.6	What really caught my eye was the pivoting display and the fact that it will go portrait automatically.	St
1.15.7	Great for what I use it for.	St
1.15.8	Now on to ordering the system.	St
1.15.9	Any thoughts on who is fast and competitive on price?	St
1.15.10	I would like to get this done in the next Month.	St
1.15.11	Here is everything that I have so far with Est.	St
1.15.12	cost .	St
1.15.13	Microsoft Windows XP Professional with Service Pack 2 $249.99 Thermaltake Tai Chi Liquid Cooled Case - VB5001SNA with/Water Cooling System $429.99 PC Power & Cooling Turbo-Cool 850 SLI $499.00 ASUS P5AD2-E Premium - mainboard - ATX - i925X $249.99 4GB Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM at 667MHz - 4 x 1024MB Mushkin 1024MB 667MHz PC5400 DDR2 Memory x4 $319.96 $319.96 WD Caviar RE2 400gb SATA 2	St
1.16.1	DDR2?	St
1.16.2	AMD doesn't support DDR2 as of yet...	St
1.16.3	I assume you don't need speaker,monitor,keyboard, mouse, nor printer, or media-card reader, or floppy.	St
1.16.4	Don't forget arctic silver 5 thermal compound.	Sug
1.16.5	Other than that looks good.	St
1.17.1	NIL	St
1.18.1	ASUS A8N32-SLI Deluxe ASUS A8N-SLI Premium Or maybe some of the DFI Lanparty offerings: DFI LANPARTY nF4 SLI-DR Be aware that these more expensive gaming boards may be a little more difficult to set up because they have more BIOS settings that you can tweak.	St
1.18.2	Check some reviews on NewEgg.com and elsewhere.	St
1.19.1	working on the complete list.	St
1.19.2	I thank you for pointing out the problems.	Polite
1.19.3	havn't ordered anything yet.	St
1.20.1	then newegg offers that(www.newegg.com).	St
1.20.2	They have fast delivery and competitive prices.	Ques
1.20.3	Other sites that are good are www.tigerdirect.com, and www.zipzoomfly.com	Polite
1.21.1	Unless of course you guys that have been assiting me have any other ideas.	St
1.21.2	By the way THANK YOU, whether you suggested something or set me off in the right direction, I could not have done this without your help (or at least it would have taken me a lot longer).	St
1.21.3	Any way, let me know what you think.	Sug
1.21.4	Here it is: New Computer Configuration Date: 12/16/2005 10:53 AM Operating System:	St
1.22.1	&quot;MotherBoard: ASUS A8N-SLI Premium $249.99&quot; If you are in the USA, you can get that motherboard for $163.	St
1.22.2	Did you mean the &quot;ASUS A8N32-SLI Deluxe&quot; for about $230?	St
1.23.1	Having a 3.5'' floppy drive often comes in handy, as some drivers (especially SATA) still come on 3.5'' floppies.	St
1.23.2	You can get one for less than $10.	St
1.23.3	At least have another computer handy to download drivers and transfer them to/from the proper discs.	St
1.23.4	I use a combination 3.5 floppy/memory card reader like one of these: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16821104104 (I hate to insert just a floppy drive these days.)	St
1.24.1	Hope the build works great for you.	St
1.24.2	That is one sweet system you are going to have there.	St
1.24.3	Hope everything works out.	St
1.25.1	I did indeed, mean the A8N32-SLI Deluxe Thanks	St
1.26.1	Prices are not the final cost although I saved quite a bit from listed prices.	St
1.26.2	Most of the products were ordered from ''Tigerdirect and Newegg''.	St
1.26.3	One question, do you work for Alienware?	St
1.26.4	as your name might indicate?	St
1.26.5	Anyway I will keep you updated on the build and thank you for all your help....absolutely invaluable One other question if you don't mind.	St
1.26.6	I have yet to order the powersupply.	St
1.26.7	I can save a bundle by ordering the &quot;SilverStone Zeus Series 650-W NVIDIA-Certified SLI PSU&quot; instead of the &quot;PC Power & Cooling Turbo-Cool 850 SLI&quot; will that unit give me what I need nowq and in the future and what do you think of the Manufaturer.	St
1.26.8	New Computer Configuration Date: 12/21/2005 9:58 AM Operating System:	St
1.27.1	If you want to save a little $$$, then you can go for the 650-watt power supply.	St
1.27.2	I only suggested the 850-watt power supply because you will have alot of high ends parts in your system and it is always good to have enough power for them all.	St
1.27.3	This is a bargain 850-watt psu and comes with 3yr.	St
1.27.4	warranty, http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817104126 or you can get this 700-watt power supply http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817104015 Yes I used to work Alienware, but I didn't leave on mutual terms.	St
1.27.5	Hope the build works.	St
1.28.1	get the 650-watt psu if you want to save money.	St
1.28.2	With all the high end gear and hardware you will need a bigger psu (at least in my view, you might get away though), so as I said you should get a 700-watt psu or greater.	St
1.28.3	I was looking at other parts when I cam across this neat cooling kit http://www.maximumpc.com/2005/07/koolance_exos_2.html It might be too much or overkill, but if you want to keep your parts cool(and I am aware that you case comes with a cooling kit), you can get it .	St
1.29.1	Just had to trust my gut and this thing rocks, as far as I can tell.	St
1.29.2	I was reading reviews the other day and ran across several that list peoples computer builds.	St
1.29.3	We must be doing something right as this identical built was listed twice (can't remember where I saw it, had to many up).	St
1.29.4	They were however posted 2 days after I posted the original discussion, so maybe they just copied it, who knows.	St
1.29.5	As far as Alienware goes, I don't blame you.	St
1.29.6	When they first started they were great, but have lost something recently.	St
1.29.7	I was originally going to purchase the ALX and was turned off by their &quot;customer service&quot;.	St
1.29.8	Thanks again	St
1.30.1	Great that the build worked.	St
1.30.2	I wish I had a system like yours .	St
1.30.3	Remember, get those anti-spyware and anti-virus protection going, don't want a system like that to fall under some dumb virus.	St
1.30.4	Good luck and I hope your enjoy your system.	Polite
1.31.1	Use AMD instead of Intel.	St
1.31.2	Just use this page as a template: http://mw-cc.com/productcart/pc/configurePrd.asp?idproduct=2	St
1.32.1	NIL	St
1.33.1	Tried the ASUS that is listed and had on problem after another (see previous post) decided top go with the premium.	St
1.33.2	Reason is simple it has been out for a while and has gone though 2 revisions.	St
1.33.3	Now I wait should be here 2maro.	Sug
1.33.4	Also have an RMA on the bad WD drive, have to wait for this also.	St
1.33.5	The design of that ASUS A8N32 just wasted 2 pci slots and ran to hot on the Video card (I had not even installed the 2nd).	St
1.33.6	It seems I will have 3 PCI slots to get to on the Premium Board.	St
1.33.7	Any thoughts on the A8NSLI - Premium?	St
1.34.1	Hi(it is me Eddiefromalienwarecomps); that board was used in this build.	St
1.34.2	http://sysbuild.corsairmemory.com/report.aspx?id=2 .	St
1.34.3	The link was provided by another cnet member.	St
1.34.4	The people who built the computer( as you will see in the link) even show how you can overclock.	St
1.34.5	The Asus board even comes with more hardware, and onboard firewire.	St
1.35.1	Just curious, why would you go with the X2 instead of the FX-60?	St
1.36.1	And the minor performance difference doesn't justify the price.	St
1.37.1	The A8N-SLi is a great board, pretty good Overclocker, and has most, if not all, the features on the 32 board.	St
1.37.2	The A8N-SLi, I hear, also has a Firewire on the back panel.	St
1.37.3	~Ibrahim~	St
1.38.1	Why Not just order a Quad 2.5GHz PowerPC G5 and then customize.	St
1.38.2	Can cost up to 15 grand and over.	St
1.38.3	Although apple only has a selection of one graphics card, just go out and buy it yourself.	St
1.38.4	Although apple is expensive, i think that if money is no object then go ahead.	St
