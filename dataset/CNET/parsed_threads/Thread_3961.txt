<s> Hey Guys, I'm trying to figure out what all components to buy to get a wireless media playing setup. </s>
<s> I'm an enthusiast. </s>
<s> Not a novice but not an expert either. </s>
<s> Only good thing is currently I have a nothing else than 20mbps internet connection from TWC and looking to buy everything else. </s>
<s> So I'm open to options. </s>
<s> What I need: - Wireless access to internet for laptops and cell phones = so a wireless-N router. </s>
<s> - Streaming to HDTV from internet and local (NAS/USB-HDD) media = an HDTV + Roku/Google/Apple-TV, I'm okay with 720p if 1080p doesn't work well in wireless. </s>
<s> - Want to set it up once and hide all wired connections. </s>
<s> (keep them away from my kids' reach). </s>
<s> What I don't need: - Cable TV via internet/cable/sattelite. </s>
<s> - Watch NBA, NFL, NASCAR (I'm an F1 and Cricket guy .. ). </s>
<s> Options I considered, with pros/cons to the best of my knowledge: A. Wireless-N router + HDTV with Google-TV ++ Router can handle most media on my USB HDD and stream to TV via DLNA ++ A keyboard for remote helps dealing with UI when you want to stream. </s>
<s> -- Google TV reviews aren't great. </s>
<s> ( http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-media-receivers/logitech-revue-google-tv/4505-6739_7-34165117.html#reviewPage1 ) -- Cost B. Wireless-N router + HDTV (w/o WiFi) + PS3 ++ BD player + gaming in addition to all I need. </s>
<s> ++ Better support for media formats than opption A. </s>
<s> -- PS3 cost. </s>
<s> -- Don't think net-browsing via PS3 Controllers would be easy. </s>
<s> C. Wireless-N router + HDTV (w/o WiFi) + Roku XS ++ Cheapest option -- Roku has no DLNA right now. </s>
<s> -- Internet streaming from selected sites only, no free fledged browse and watch what you wnat like in options A and B. I'm assuming that a good Wireless-N router (e.g. </s>
<s> Linksys E4200 or NetGear N750 (WNDR4000)) would be enough to stream HD contents from my USB drive to the TV without any other equipment?? </s>
<s> That way I can have a static setup where I download using my laptop to the HDD and then play it on TV later w/o changing any wired connections. </s>
<s> My current preferences are: NetGear N750 (WNDR4000) + LG 42LV3700 (42&quot;, LED, 1080p, 60Hz, with WiFi) + PS3 == 130$ + 650$ + 250$ = 1030$ NetGear N750 (WNDR4000) + LG 42LV3700 (42&quot;, LED, 1080p, 60Hz, with WiFi) + Roku XS == 130$ + 650$ + 100$ = 880$ (LG 42LV3500 viz w/o WiFi is just 20$ cheaper than LG 42LV3700) Please help me out. </s>
<s> I'm open to suggestions on different brands etc as well. </s>
<s> You find some folk that will disagree but if you want a committee solution with the lowest common denominator and no support do that. </s>
<s> (Just don't tell me later it didn't fast forward rewind, etc.) </s>
<s> OK I have the Logitech Revue and well, I'm going to go us it right now. </s>
<s> I spent 99 bucks on it and have a simple Netgear something 3500 and it works fine. </s>
