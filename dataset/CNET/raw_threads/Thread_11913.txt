Hi, last week I findally had time to assemble my pc like I did it in school before, to be sure I also checked my mainboard manual, when I press the on/off switch on my power supply on the back of my computer and then I press the powerswitch in front of my case, nothing happends, only the leds are burning, the first time when I did this, I heard the air coming out in the back of my pc, but it went out after 1 min, and now I never getted that again and nothing happends except for the leds burning My leds are working so I don't think my mainboard is fried and my dad thinks there is something wrong with the power supply, it's 350 watt btw. Anybody got an idea? De computer -------------- Amd Sempron 2600+ K8N Neo3 (agr slot+pci-e en pci slots) 512 MB Ram pc 3200 corsair 120 gb hd maxtor Sapphire Radeon 9600 pro DvD Writer van Benq

RED ITEM ONE: What is the voltage rating on the memory module (MSI says 2.5V is compatible)? What voltage setting does the BIOS have for the memory? RED ITEM TWO: Although the MSI compatibility list for the AGR slot is probably incomplete, the Sapphire 9600 Pro is not on the list of tested compatible cards. If you can, I would consider returning that board for one that is known to support your card or has a standard AGP slot. Maybe get a motherboard that has less issues in general.

Have a bootable floppy and upon booting enter the bios and be suree no CD&HD present, save and exit out. Reboot and try to boot from FD. If it actually boots, you have power issues, your psu is too weak or lacking. Further, repelace with a decent namebrand and be at least 400W+ or better. Of course recheck all connections, ect. and teardown to see that no shorts are present, DON'T TAKE ANYTHING for granted. Reseat all cables/harnesses/wiring and be 100% sure that's where it goes. Also, you you see any video display at any time during boot-up, even before the problem came up? tada -----Willy

But, please reduce the system as I explained in the previous message. You can always add the devices later. Since, this is a new build, again recheck the work and make sure no standoffs are shorting the mtrbd. backside, etc.. If you checked the psu w/o the mtrbd. attached, understand the psu needs a &quot;load&quot; in order to turn-ON. There are ATX psu simple testers yes/no condition. tada -----Willy

There are ATX psu simple testers yes/no condition.&quot; What you mean by this? It needs a load? And how I do that.

If you test with no mtrbd. or no load attached, the psu isn't capable to turn-ON. I usggested an ATX type tester as it's safe to use. There is a trick, but I won't do that for a novice, safety issue IMHO. But google for such if you like, up to you. tada -----Willy
