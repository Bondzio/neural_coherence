<s> My home and work computers both run Windows XP Home Edition and both are connected to the internet via ADSL broadband. </s>
<s> I want to network my 2 computers through the internet. </s>
<s> I understand that VPN is usually the way to do this, but does XP Home Edition have the facilities to act as a server? </s>
<s> So far I have been unsuccessful at trying to set it up through Windows Network Connections. </s>
<s> Or do I need a different software programme. </s>
<s> Surely there is a very simple way of networking these 2 computers through the internet? </s>
<s> Am I just too dumb to do it? </s>
<s> Linksys USBVPN1 they cost about 79 bucks a piece - you need 2 to create a data tunnel. </s>
