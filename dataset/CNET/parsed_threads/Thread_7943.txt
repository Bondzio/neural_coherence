<s> I have an HP Compaq dc7800 Small Form Factor computer with a built in Intel Q35. </s>
<s> I'm trying to install an ASUS EAH4350 SILENT graphics card. </s>
<s> Without the card in, the computer boots up completely fine, running Windows Vista with 2gigs of ram. </s>
<s> The ASUS card uses a PCI Express slot, but once the card's plugged in, and I power up the computer, it will beep 6 times in sequence with a red light flashing on the front, stop for a second, then start beeping again. </s>
<s> The start up HP screen won't run either. </s>
<s> Any idea on how to install it with it working? </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> That box looks to have a very small power supply. </s>
<s> Ask HP and ASUS if the power supply is big enough. </s>
<s> My thought is it's power related. </s>

<s> here is a list of the Intel beep codes, scroll down to where it explains the '6 beeps' http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/cs-010249.htm </s>
<s> Is there a way besides a PSU calculator to figure out how much extra power I have or would be needed to run this card? </s>
<s> As in an actual application in Windows or something? </s>
<s> The entire reason I want to in include this card is because while playing the Sims 3, the screen will go black, but comes back darker than before. </s>
<s> When the Sims is minimized, a warning triangle will appear in the notification area saying that the display driver crashed but has successfully recovered (or something or the sort) so I figured that a new graphics card would be the solution. </s>
<s> Other manufacturers websites suggest a minimum 300 watt power supply for their HD4350's, you also have to take in consideration that your PC is a 'small form factor', so write down the measurements of your power supply, and compare that to the size of new ones. </s>
