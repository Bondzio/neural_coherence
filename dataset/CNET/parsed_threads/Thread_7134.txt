<s> I have a Dell 2350 running a celeron processor at 1.8 GHZ. </s>
<s> Ive upgraded memory, power supply and video and graphics card and now for fun Id like to try a new better processor. </s>
<s> Pentium if possible or a faster Celeron. </s>
<s> As expected Dell told me no way but Im wondering if any one has had any luck with this.Thanks in advance for any response. </s>

<s> Once at the support website for Dell, see if any &quot;upgrade option&quot; is being sold/available for that model. </s>
<s> If yes, then get it on the open market. </s>
<s> What may have happened is Dell no longer offer upgrade parts as stock is depleted or too old. </s>
<s> You can check the &quot;specs&quot; page as well for what if any info is available, but its important that the bios be able to support any new processor of the same class. </s>
<s> IMHO, you maybe able to go to 2.4ghz, but that's a maybe as if no FSB settings, etc. </s>
<s> can't be changed you're locked-in to that processor. </s>
<s> Check the mtrbd. </s>
<s> itself for any setting printed on possible jumpers. </s>
<s> But in most cases the bios itself has to the setting area. </s>
<s> Check your bios and see if you can change it at all at least to a lower setting, if lower can be done then very possible a higher setting can be as well. </s>
<s> Since this is a OEM type system you're at the mercy of what the vendor allows. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> If you change too much hardware in that type of machine, Windows may refuse to work. </s>
<s> You won't be able to reinstall Windows using the Dell restore disk. </s>
<s> Your disk is proprietary to that system. </s>
<s> It will be looking for your old hardware. </s>
<s> You could end up having to purchase a new Windows XP cd to make it work. </s>
<s> Thats why it can be less expensive to purchase a new computer than update a proprietary machine. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info I figured Im stuck. </s>
<s> Just have to start fresh and build something from scratch. </s>

<s> Thanks for the input I may just build a new machine from scratch. </s>
<s> I always wanted to so now may be the time. </s>
