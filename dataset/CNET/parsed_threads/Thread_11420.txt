<s> (My PC is getting more worthless every day. </s>
<s> Its an HP,with Windows XP Professional & an intel pentium 4 processor,it says it has 256 MB or RAM but that might be wrong. </s>
<s> The PC had a lot of problems and everytime we went it to get fixed it worked well for a short while then got even worse. </s>
<s> I also suspect that the people who &quot;fixed&quot; it used a fake/false copy of Windows because recently when I checked on the Microsoft site, it wasn't a genuine copy. </s>
<s> At first we said we would order a new copy but now we're thinking of just buying a new computer. </s>
<s> I really don't feel...right using a fake copy after we've spent so much money buying and &quot;repairing&quot; this PC I am a little fed up.) </s>
<s> --I like music and videos and I want a fast PC that has a lot of memory. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me? </s>
<s> many members would be happy to help I would look at this video guide: http://computer.howstuffworks.com/build-a-computer.htm If that looks like its for you, then I would suggest building your own If not, then I would suggest looking at Dell or Hewlett-Packard/Compaq (or maybe Apple, if you have no qualms about that (Apple would handle what you've described just fine, but OS X isn't for everyone)) Generally, the bottom shelf systems from Dell (as I recall its still a dual core Athlon64 x2 3600+, with something to the tune of 512MB or 1GB of RAM, and a hard-drive in the multi-hundred (I wanna say 250) gigabyte range with integrated graphics, all for about $399-$499 with some sort of monitor included (or offered at a discount)) will handle your described workload flawlessly If you are interested in building you own, look at www.newegg.com (also a good place to find Acer computers) and www.zipzoomfly.com for parts </s>
<s> You can't lose with either of these. </s>
<s> Velocity Micro has better customer support, more expensive too. </s>
<s> Call either company and they can set you up with what you need. </s>
