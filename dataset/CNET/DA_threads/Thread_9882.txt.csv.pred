1.1.1	Hi I just bought a HP Pavilion dv9000t series custom few days back to replace my iMac.	St
1.1.2	I chose this computer for HP reputation and it came with HDMI out.	St
1.1.3	I wanted to know if HDMI is the same thing as a DVI with sound can I use this as a output to connect the laptop to my 22&quot; gateway display with DVI as a extended desktop?	St
1.1.4	I talked with someone at radioshack about this and they sold me a cable with HDMI out and DVI in attached.	St
1.1.5	Today I talked with someone who thought the HDMI was only used for TVs and not display.	St
1.1.6	Is this true?	St
1.1.7	If it is do anyone know what the cable I bought is used for?	St
1.1.8	Did I waste fifty bucks too?	St
1.1.9	Thank you for your help.	St
1.2.1	you'll just need a hdmi to dvi cable.	St
1.2.2	shop around since $50 is way too expensive for a cable.	St

1.4.1	Thanks for the clarification.	St
1.4.2	It's just I used DVI with the Last two Macs I had and I don't want to go back to VGA connection ever again.	St
1.4.3	I never seen or heard of a HDMI on a PC or a Mac before and it raised some doubt after hearing and only seeing HDMI only in TV related products.	St
1.4.4	Again thank you.	Polite
