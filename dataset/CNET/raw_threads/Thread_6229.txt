Proffitt	9/8/04 2:01 PM	1.09465206E12	Re: HP scanjet 5470c problem	If the scanner returns to good color after power off and repeats such, then you've done 1/2 the testing needed to tell if it's the scanner. The last test is to put it on another PC and see if the problem persists. What bothers many people is that repair costs more than a new scanner. Bob
