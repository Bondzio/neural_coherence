Before I can use the CD-W and CD-Rom in the Chinese Windows 98 but after I installed the other hard drives used the Englsih Windows 98 SE, I only can use the CD-R and CD-rom in the new hard drives for windows 98 SE. When I try to use the CD-r and CD-rom in the old hard drive, it said missing the Win APSI files. Can somebody help me? The CPU is P3-350 with 384 Ram. Thanks Summer
