a good cpu operating temp is 50 deg.
c, give or take 5 deg.
but i would look into ray's suggestion to increase the airflow in the case itself to allow more air around the cpu.
round cables, another fan, funneling the flow that direction, etc.
dating back to athlon, amd recommends 42 deg.
c case temp and about 50-55 deg.
cpu as the optimum (ideal), and anything close as fine.
