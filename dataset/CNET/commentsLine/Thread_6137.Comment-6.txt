going from 3 to 4 potential users won't make much difference.
adding more to the system of networks to accommodate more users has to potential to cause serious bottlenecks depending on how much and what all these folks download from the internet.
it's streaming video and movie downloads that tie up bandwidth.
general surfing uses much less.
this sounds like a generous move on your part.
