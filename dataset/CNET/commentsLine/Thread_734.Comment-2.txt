change the psu and continue from that.
while you have some items &quot;running&quot; that means that voltage is present but not others.
the usb is key as that points to 5v being low or gone, while the fans running suggest 12v is up.
at 3yrs.
and it seems you've tasked this pc, it's shown its age.
that's where i start, swap psu for a better wattage level and a decent name brand.
you can use a meter if you're capable to verify presence of voltage.
the other half of this is not powering-off.
that also suggests psu, but the mtrbd.
key to logical power on/off.
if swapping psu doesn't cure it, then that's an issue of the mtrbd., or a 2ndary problem, if the psu was bad and it took the mtrbd.
with it.
