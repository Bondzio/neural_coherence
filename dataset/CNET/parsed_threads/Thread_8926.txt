<s> I'd like some suggestions as to what a decent PC for various video operations would be. </s>
<s> For example: Capturing & processing video with a PCI PVR card. </s>
<s> Ripping & processing & burning DVD video. </s>
<s> Price is flexible, but I am interested in best bang for my buck This will be a dedicated unit that sits down by the home theater. </s>
<s> I'm even open to building it myself. </s>
<s> Although I've never built one before, I have a BS in EE & I work full time as an embedded software engineer. </s>
<s> And ended up with some refurb RCA Scenium DVR as well as a DVD-Recorder. </s>
<s> It's working fine. </s>
<s> My dad opted for a refurb Windows XP Media Center. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> That doesn't mean a lot to me. </s>
<s> I am interested in what you guys would buy & put together for a PC. </s>
<s> What kind of board? </s>
<s> Which processor? </s>
<s> I plan on tons of RAM & perhaps some raid array drives for faster hard-disk performance. </s>
<s> I found it to require a 2+GHz P4 and preferably some HT CPU or 64-bitter. </s>
<s> The big problem was not the &quot;raid array&quot; or disk speed, but just the overwhelming amount of data the CPU has to crunch. </s>
<s> The 4400 RPM DRIVE was the best solution to cut down on noise coming from the PC in the video room. </s>
<s> I'm sharing that while SNAPSTREAM is very nice, you may want to just go with a ready to use solution (much cheaper!) </s>
<s> than build your own or something like -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=PJ473AAR which my dad purchased and has been enjoying for over a month now. </s>
<s> My SCENIUM was a refurb at 139 bucks and the DVD recorder is the APTEK for 129 bucks and both are doing fine. </s>
<s> I also have the DLINK MEDIA CENTER like you see at http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=318 and it has the benefit of being very quiet while letting me put all the media collection somewhere else in the house. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> That media center looks like a great deal. </s>
<s> thanks!!! </s>
<s> I will try & read some reviews about it & see if it has any faults </s>
<s> It's a little slow on the menus. </s>
<s> In fact, I'd say it needs to get about 1/2 the time to display stuff for me to never note it as a nuisance. </s>
<s> The other gotcha is that Dlink doesn't reveal how to encode video for playback. </s>
<s> I've had to use the old trial and error method and still haven't nailed it. </s>
<s> I'd try another Media Center like that when I can this year, but for now its working. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> One thing I would consider is what do I want to do with this system in the future. </s>
<s> In reading reviews and doing comparisions look at the expandability of the case and memory in relation to what you may want to do and is this power supply really adequate? </s>
<s> There is no expansion available for RAM and the power supply seems just fine. </s>
<s> Just wondering if you were talking about some other device and if so, be sure to respond to the post about it or note it in your posting. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I meant that I was interested in the HP MEDIA CENTER 2005. </s>
<s> I definitely want a comp, even though the other device is nice & cheap. </s>
<s> I wouldn't mind paying twice as much though, but the question is... what kind of increase in performance & capability will I be able to acheive for an extra $800 ? </s>
