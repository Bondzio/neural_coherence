<s> Hi, using a hp desktop with windows xp home. </s>
<s> 352mb ram. </s>
<s> I used to be able to copy a cd with no problems. </s>
<s> Now when I try to burn a cd,it will get to 65%, and my computer will shut down and restart. </s>
<s> I checked the heat inside of the computer, and it seem to be ok. </s>
<s> I left the side panel off, and the fan is working ok. Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Other then this my computer is working real good. </s>
<s> Hi there can be trouble with spyware and other things running in the back round when doing anything on your puter. </s>
<s> have you cleaned it of late? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Hi rocky, yes I'm clean. </s>
<s> I run a check every day. </s>
<s> After more work on burning a cd, I believe that it is a heat related problem. </s>
<s> I hooked a fan up, and put it beside my computer. </s>
<s> I was able to copy a cd with no problem. </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>
