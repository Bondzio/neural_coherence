I suggest you keep with USB devices and if possible use an ext.
power source for stable output.
This will reduce power demands on the laptops own psu and provide a longer life as such.
The added benefit is any USB device will more generically be mobile to other systems vs the eSATA as has limited support for now.
The decision is yours to best fit your needs though.
