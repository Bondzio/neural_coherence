The Apple specs state that we have a &quot;combined optical digital output/headphone out (minijack)&quot; on the side, and we would like to connect our mbp to our stereo receiver so we can play music through our (new) ceiling speakers.
We would appreciate any help from anyone who has actually done this and knows the best method.
If you could also please include the name(s) of any hardware/cables that should be used, we would appreciate that as well.
Thank you.
