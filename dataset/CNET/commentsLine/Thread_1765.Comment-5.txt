again, much thanks - with your added info, i checked the usb hubs - none set to power save.
sorry, i'm using the internal windows firewall on each unit.
and on your last point, yes, i know of network magic - it came with my router, and for the 1st month of the router's operation, n m did it's thing very well - but i guess i'm one of those nuts who consider problems to be challenges, and i figure that if there's a way to make this work w/o n m, then that's the way i'd rather it be.
some would say that's just being a stubborn fool, but in my heart i know it's the way i learn the few things i do.
and besides, i no longer have the resourses to support the economy the same way i once did.
