<s> I have an Acer laptop I recently purchased. </s>
<s> I know it has built-in storage capabilities but whenever I attempt to download anything to store, a message appears saying that I must insert a CD. </s>
<s> Why won't the unit simply use it's built-in storage? </s>
<s> What kind of CD must I buy? </s>
<s> I bought the unit mostly for surfing the web but once in a while, I find an interesting article or image that I want to save. </s>
<s> I am not computer savvy so I am probably doing something wrong. </s>
<s> You don't tell what browser you use (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, to name the 4 most common), so I can't be specific about HOW to do what you must do. </s>
<s> But I can tell you WHAT to do in your browser. </s>
<s> And that's setting the default folder to store the downloaded files to something else than the CD-drive. </s>
<s> Some people download everyting to the desktop. </s>
<s> Others prefer to have a dedicated folder on the hard disk. </s>
<s> It's your own choice. </s>
<s> But a CD-drive is rather unpractical indeed. </s>
<s> If I were you, I should change that setting. </s>
