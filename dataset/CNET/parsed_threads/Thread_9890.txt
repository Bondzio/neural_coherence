<s> Hello all, I am looking for some input on upgrading my PC. </s>
<s> Current specs on the PC I built about 4 years ago: Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 EVGA 132-CK-NF78 Motherboard 4G DDR2 Ram Nvidia GTX560 Video Card What I am thinking of getting: Intel Core i5-2500K BX80623I52500 ASUS P8Z77-V LX Intel 7 Series Motherboard 16G Corsair CMZ16GX3M4A1600C9B Vengeance Desktop Memory Kit Questions: 1. </s>
<s> Can I use the same case, drives, and power supply I did with my old one? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Is this upgrade worth it? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Suggestions for other cost effective upgrades? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance - Paul </s>

<s> You can check the power connections to see if it can be re-used but I worry about old power supplies. </s>
<s> They are not ageless. </s>
<s> 2. iffy. </s>
<s> The i5 is a dual core with 4 threads, the older Core 2 Quad is a quad core with 4 threads so not a major uptick like a move to the usual i7. </s>
<s> Then again it's all about the apps. </s>
<s> My i5 laptop and my old Core 2 Quad are fairly equal in transcoding video. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Think about what you are using the machine for. </s>
<s> If it's a current 64 bit OS, 8GB RAM may hold off an upgrade for another year. </s>

<s> largely on use and perhaps whether the results are for fun or profit. </s>
<s> Re using older components...that depends too. </s>
<s> Certainly the case and the drives as secondary of maybe for backup. </s>
<s> PSU...depends on the old PSU and the new GPU. </s>
<s> Might be usable to start with replacement in 12 months...it really depends on the PSU and past use. </s>
