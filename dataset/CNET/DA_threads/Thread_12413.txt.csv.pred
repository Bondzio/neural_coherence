1.1.1	in this case , 32 bits plus 32 bits is nog 64 bits , that is complete bull .	St
1.1.2	the only 64 bit processors are processors wich can adress to 64 bits of memory , and intel core duo can only adress 36 bits .	St
1.1.3	if the x86-64 instruction set is not included , it is not an ( x86 ) 64 bit processor , no matter how much cores your system has vista will be in both 32 and 64 bit flavours , but I expect 64-bit will be a tad faster .	St
1.2.1	The bus size has been 64 bits for years , however , yes without specific processing capability it does not process 64 bit code .	St
