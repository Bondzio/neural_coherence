It seems your main thrust is speed, USB simply is more generic to be accepted by more systems than eSATA.
If you need(desire) both ports in a ext.
case, google for such(USB and eSATA ext.
case).
When using custom or adapter type situations expect some problems to crop-up one way or another, maybe not in this case though.
Like i mentioned before do what best suits ya.
