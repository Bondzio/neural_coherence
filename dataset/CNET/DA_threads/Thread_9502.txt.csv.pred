1.1.1	I'm building a PC pretty soon.	St
1.1.2	I want to overclock my CPU not a lot.	St
1.1.3	Maybe 200 or 300 mhz.	St
1.1.4	I'm going to get an AMD 3500+ on Socket AM2.	St
1.1.5	My question is will any after market fan/heatsink work with any processor?	St
1.1.6	In particular, will http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16835128007 this cooler work on http://www.newegg.com/product/Product.asp?item=N82E16813138026 this motherboard with an AM2 3500+?	St
1.2.1	What I would do is goto the manufacturers websites, I have no idea what AM2 socket is lol.	St
1.2.2	I dont think gigabyte make that heatsink any more.	St
1.2.3	Goto this link http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Products/Cooler/Default.aspx .	St
1.2.4	If you want something to cool your CPU down.	St
1.2.5	Try asaka aswell.	St
1.2.6	But goto the Manufacturers site first!	St
1.2.7	and also do some more research on AM2!	St
1.3.1	A good place to start would be with AMD......	St
1.4.1	MOst cpu/HSF setups are rated for thier highest level of usage.	St
1.4.2	So, if you get a fan for XYZ-1000cpu and it becomes overclocked to XYZ-1300cpu then you're really going beyond the rating of the fan.	St
1.4.3	Though a fan can take excessive heat, don't expect all fans to do so and whatever &quot;quality&quot; means alot.	St
1.4.4	Thus, some namebrnads fans are capable of handling OC'ing but look for any rating label to match what you plan to OC to as a safe bet of sustained usage.	St
1.4.5	Remember you still have to &quot;exhaust&quot; the immediate heat build-up as well to best serve any HSF to maintain its sustained rating or over time will fail.	St
1.4.6	tada -----Willy	St
