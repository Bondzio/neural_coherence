Hi...
I have used generic ink cartridges for a long time for my hp psc 950 *printer*fax*scanner*copier*...
However, I don't think this problem I'm asking for advice on has to do w/ the cartridge: this time when the black ink ran out, I never got the message on the little screen &quot;low ink&quot; replace ink soon or whatever, my copies just got so faint that I replaced the cartridge.
Now, the message on my little screen says, &quot;press enter to align cartridges&quot; and, when I do so, it begins and the screen reads: &quot;printing align cartridge page&quot; then it goes about it's business for a minute then says, &quot;alignment failed, please try again&quot; and I can't get past this... over and over.
I take the cartridge out, I replace the cartridge, I even got a new cartridge and, even tho I'm only replacing the black, I take the color out too and reinsert it: nothing... and no option to just clear the error and use the machine as is...
I can't even send faxes out which requires no ink at all... any advice?
thanks
