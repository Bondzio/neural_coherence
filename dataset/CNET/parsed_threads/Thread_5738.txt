<s> Hey, I'm having a very annoying problem. </s>
<s> Just after Windows XP Pro launches on my computer, the motherboard begins to let out one long annoying beep and it doesn't stop. </s>
<s> I have no idea what is causing it and I can't get it to quit with the beep. </s>
<s> It is really loud and makes it so I can't use my PC out of sheer frustration. </s>
<s> What is the problem and how can I fix it? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> You may want to remove the case cover to see if the fan is in place, the airflow is good and the fan is not blocked. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Of course, a real phone tech support type would probably just tell you to unplug the speaker. </s>
<s> Kidding, Just kidding! </s>
