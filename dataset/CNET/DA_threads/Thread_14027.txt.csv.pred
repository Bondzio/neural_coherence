1.1.1	I am trying to borrow my Uncle 's shared broadband internet connection by unplugging the ethernet cable from his laptop and plugging it into my laptop .	St
1.1.2	At first , my computer tried to acquire the network address on the LAN connection but it ended with limited or no connectivity .	St
1.1.3	I eventually fixed that problem by changing the IP address on my laptop to my Uncle 's IP address and making the last digit different .	St
1.1.4	While it now says LAN connection is connected , I still can not browse the internet .	St
