<s> I have Intel PentIII 800, Gigabyte Motherboard, 630Ram, and a Western Digital 160GB HD. </s>
<s> My system wouldnt recognize the HD until I Flashed the BIOS from Gigabyte. </s>
<s> Now it recognizes 149.5 GB, but not in the BIOS. </s>
<s> The bios wont recognize a HD, only will accept Auto. </s>
<s> Then when I boot up, it cannot find a HD until I reboot, then it finds a 160GB HD, but my systems file still only recognizes 149.5 GB HD. </s>
<s> When I shut down, I have to boot up twice each time I restart in order my PC to find the HD again. </s>
<s> I checked with the Gigabyte experts but they couldnt figure it out. </s>
<s> Anyone ever hear of a problem like this. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> But we cure it with BIOS updates and if the maker doesn't fix it... then we get a new motherboaard or a drive under the magic 127/137GB size. </s>
<s> There is no cure if they didn't do the BIOS proper. </s>
<s> ---------------- Some fight the jumper settings tooth and nail. </s>
<s> I'm unsure why people insist that a jumper setting be &quot;this&quot; when &quot;that&quot; works. </s>
<s> You didn't share the IDE cable type you used, the jumper setting of the IDE drive and what you tried. </s>

<s> There are gigabytes and there are billion bytes. </s>
<s> You can read the hard disk maker's web site about how to convert from one to the other. </s>

<s> I just installed Partition Magic 8.0 and it shows 160GB fully partitioned into 4 patritions, and all my apps seem to work fine, but it still takes two boots to locate the HD, the first boot indicates no HD installed. </s>
<s> Just installed a new ULDMA cable today, same problem. </s>
<s> Wierd. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> Bob H. </s>
<s> That's a known BUGGY BIOS quirk. </s>
<s> Or you have the drive on master/slave on an 80 conductor cable. </s>
<s> Or there is another drive on the same cable and ... isn't entirely compatible with its neighbor. </s>
