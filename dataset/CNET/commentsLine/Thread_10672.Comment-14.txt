i tried both dvi and analog on my dell 18.1&quot; ultrasharp lcd.
i personally didn't notice a difference.
i wasn't looking real hard however.
this is kinda subjective.
some ppl will notice a diff while others won't be able to see it for the life of them.
only way i can tell u for sure for my model lcd is if i had 2 of them side by side, but htat' won't happen with only one lcd monitor of that model.
