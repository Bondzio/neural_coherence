<s> I was using some video editing program and burning a DVD, when the DVD player started acting up. </s>
<s> It wasnt burning, but was still spinning and making noises like it was. </s>
<s> I closed the application in the task manager, but the DVD player just kept humming like it was still burning. </s>
<s> I shut down the computer, but the DVD player kept humming along and the computer wouldnt come to a full shut down. </s>
<s> After a few mins, I unplugged the darn thing to get it to stop. </s>
<s> Which it did. </s>
<s> NOW my computer wont boot up. </s>
<s> Just black screen. </s>
<s> I am using Windows La Vista. </s>
<s> I have a 2 month old custom built computer and this DVD-RW player is new as well. </s>
<s> I'm at work using the computer to try to get some answers before I go home. </s>
<s> Do you think unplugging the DVD ROM cables inside the computer would help and then trying to restart? </s>
<s> With the thoughts that the DVD player is the culprit? </s>
<s> I have another DVD player in the computer, so do you think it would boot from the La Vista CD and I could attempt a repair? </s>
<s> I can usually fix problems if I can get a computer to turn on, but when I cant. </s>
<s> Then I'm usually at a loss, as this appears to be a Hardware issue now, instead of a software issue. </s>
<s> This is my computer: Jr P45-T2RS Motherboard , with a Intel Duo Core E8400 CPU, 4 gigs of DDR2 800 Memory, and an ATI 4500 Vid card I think it is. </s>
<s> The drive had some odd failure so we unplugged it and later replaced it. </s>
<s> Why not try unplugging it? </s>
<s> What computer is this? </s>
<s> It looks like some homebrew. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> That's what I'm doing now. </s>
<s> Unplugging the offending DVD player and gonna try seeing if it will boot up now. </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> It's a crazy homebrew put together with new and old pieces. </s>
<s> I only kept the 2 SATA Hardrives and a DVD player.. </s>
<s> That didnt work. </s>
<s> Now I have no clue what to do... *sigh* </s>
<s> A disconnected DVD player is the cause the machine doesn't boot. </s>
<s> That's really strange! </s>
