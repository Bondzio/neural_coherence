I have photos & whatnot saved into my WD Essential external, but I when I try accessing my own photos, I get a pop-up telling me I' don't have &quot;permissions&quot; to open it. I've already switched the &quot;owner&quot; to my 'name&quot; in the permissions & it's still not allowing me access. I &quot;fixed&quot; this once before & have long since forgotten how I even did it. I need to fix it *permanently*. Sick of going through with that every time. Using Windows 7 on an hp laptop. Thx!

Googling for WINDOWS 7 TAKE OWNERSHIP might tell you what you need to know. Otherwise, find a big enough USB-stick, formatted in FAT32, and use a Linux disk to copy those files to that stick and delete them on the external. And then you're logon with your id in Windows to copy it back. Kees
