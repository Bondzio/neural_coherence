so i over clocked my amd athlon 64 3500+ 2.2ghz to 2.46ghz and when i use my computer for any reason sometimes its 5 minutes sometimes more i get a blue screen that says something about hardware i've never finished it but after it i turned it down to 2.25ghz and i dont get it anymore.
is this hardware, software, maybe not enough cooling?
please help
