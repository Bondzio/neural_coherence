<s> When I overlock my FSB to 400, am I right to assume that all else being equal, using DDR2-800 (or 1066, if just for a little more headroom) will yield about the same performance as DDR3-1660? </s>
<s> In other words, is it that simple or am I missing something? </s>
<s> ddr3's advantage is higher speeds can be reached and lower voltage is needed. </s>
<s> as for overclocking your fsb, the memory speed will be determined by what ratios (multipliers) you or your bios choose. </s>
<s> so if your bios is dumb (it doesn't automaticaly change ratios based on fsb and memory spd) and you don't manually configure it, moving the fsb from 333mhz to 400mhz will result in ddr2-800 ram running at ddr2-960. </s>
