1.1.2	It finally looks like I need some help of my own.	St
1.1.3	Actually, I have a few problems at the moment.	St
1.1.4	The one that is frustrating me the most is probably a fairly simple one...however, I can't seem to find a solution.	St
1.1.5	I recently had my nieces using my computer and they must have been playing with the buttons on the monitor.	St
1.1.6	Now the screen is off center and difficult to read.	St
1.1.7	No matter how hard I try, I can't quite get it to look like it used to with the monitors controls.	St

1.1.12	And thank you very much in advance.	Polite
1.2.1	and fills the screen.	St
1.2.2	If so, it's not the monitor but display settings.	St
