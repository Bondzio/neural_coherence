1.1.1	Good day, from what I have discovered so far this is an ongoing/reoccurring issue for a lot of people however, I have only just run into it.	St
1.1.2	I have an older Desktop running XP SP3, wired to a Motorola modem/router/wireless combination.	St
1.1.3	The Win7 machine is a toshiba satellite latptop connecting with a realtek rtl8188ce wireless card, as well I have only just connected a 2tb wd live book for storage/backups.	St
1.1.4	All machines access the internet with no issues, it is when trying to network that my issue begins.	St
1.1.5	I can see/access the Win7 machine and the WD live book from the XP machine.	St
1.1.6	I am not able to access anything from the Win7 machine, all settings have been confirmed/reconfirmed, all machines are on the same workgroup, both have file/print sharing enabled, and as near as I can tell both have the required services running in order to see/network with each other.	St
1.1.7	Accessing the router configuration, everything looks as it should to me, I see no glaring settings that need to be changed/turned on or off.	St
1.1.8	I have tried quite few different suggestions found through google on sites similiar to CNET, as well as some microsoft tutorials (guaranteed to work).	St
1.1.9	the only step forward was when I was able to see/access the Win7 machine through the XP Machine.	St
1.1.10	I updated what firmware that required updating with no results, I tried running microsoft updates on both machines to see if there was some optional updates that might help, as well I went to the nic cards and checked to see if there was updated drivers for these.	St
1.1.11	To date not one single thing I have tried has had any effect on the Win7 machine, it has only been since I wanted to share some files/folders/data without running back and forth copying them that this issues came about.	St
1.1.12	Other than this one issues it works great, I have had no problem with either it or Windows7.	St
1.1.13	Hope you/someone can offer some solutions.	St
1.1.14	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	But there are so many good web pages on this now.	St
1.2.2	Plus your post is hard to read as it looks like a single paragraph so I may have missed why you didn't get it to work.	St
1.2.3	Here's a good link about this setup.	St
1.2.4	-&gt; http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-7/share-files-and-printers-between-windows-7-and-xp/ Now this won't address those new routers with firewalls so you may have to tailor that firewall in the router.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Good day all, Thank you very much for taking the time to read my post if you did.	St
1.3.2	I have solved my issue.	St
1.3.3	In the event that other might benefit from the solution I found, here it is.	St
1.3.4	After trying a whole lot of googled suggestions with luck, this evening I started going through the WD knowledge base, long story short I found a fellow with a similiar issue, he apparently was on the phone for about 2 hours with a microsoft tech, I guess after sorting through/verifying some other settings the tech had the guy to the properties of his network adapter and verify he had the Client for Microsoft Networks client installed, he did not, once he added this client and with some other settings he was able to do what he wanted to do, so I went into my network adapter properties and sure enough it was not there, I installed the Client and a little while later everything worked the way I wanted it to.	St
1.3.5	Who knew LOL.	St
1.3.6	Hope this helps others.	St
1.4.1	Sorry to take so long getting back to you, it took me a while to realise I had a reply/response, then another while to actually get around to reading it .	St
1.4.2	Anyhow, my apologies for the long windedness of my post, I do tend to get carried away with my typing.	St
1.4.3	Thank you very much for your answer/reply, I had been to that site allready, verified that I had done what it suggested, it did not help.	St
1.4.4	This evening I have only just a little while found the answer to my issue, and have posted it.	St
1.4.5	Thanks again.	Polite
