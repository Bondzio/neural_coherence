i have a dell optiplex gx280.
it is 3.2 ghz, 2gb ddr2 ram, xp pro sp3.
i want to replace my cd drive with a dvd burner.
my cd drive is a samsung sc-148a, and i'm pretty sure it is ide.
i am looking at the lite-on ihap422-08.
it has the features i want, and is okay with the size, and system requirements, but i don't know if the pata connection is right.
do you need any other info?
thanks
