<s> I have 2 computers both win XP, a network laser printer, and a broadband internet connection, all hooked up to a linksys befsr41 router. </s>
<s> I had the 2 computers networked to each other but now I lost the connection between them and can't get them to find each other. </s>
<s> However each computer can access the internet through the router. </s>
<s> How come they can't find each other? </s>
<s> I have run the necessary XP programs and rebooted. </s>
<s> What could be the problem? </s>
<s> &quot;I had the 2 computers networked to each other but now I lost the connection between them and can't get them to find each other.&quot; since it last worked? </s>
<s> Upgrade to SP2? </s>
<s> Viral or spyware infestation? </s>
<s> Have you checked the workgroup names? </s>
<s> Done a search for computer from each computer? </s>
<s> Tried to ping each others address? </s>
<s> I worked on this problem for hours until I decided to do a system restore to an earlier point. </s>
<s> That re-set whatever was wrong so I was able to connect again, however different problems arose with my internet connection. </s>
<s> But now it seems to be working Ok. </s>
<s> So I'll go forward from this point. </s>
<s> I just wish I knew what was wrong so I could have fixed it myself. </s>
