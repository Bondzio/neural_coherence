i don't think this is a custom build and right off the cd in it's live mode and even installed i am able to read and write to ntfs volumes.
what version are you using?
i wrote current since i forgot the exact number but it is 10.04 from  and let me share i've used this boot cd in live cd mode to read/write xp, vista (32&64) and windows 7 64 bit hard disks without any fuss.
