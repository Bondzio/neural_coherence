My 533mhz P3 (windows 98) has been freezing up intermittently ever since I had the processor cooling fans replaced (old ones were making noise). I have taken it back to the shop twice, and they cannot duplicate the problem. It works fine for them, and they say the processor is NOT overheating. But when I get it back home, it locks up. I've tried plugging it into a different electrical outlet, to no avail. Any ideas? Thanks.

While it may or may not help, I wish you the best in finding the cause and a cure, but let's just state that old machines can go unstable even with the best of care. A prime example is this GOOGLE -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?&q=BAD+MOTHERBOARD+CAPACITORS Also worth noting are the PESTS that we find on too many machines. I wrote up a short list about this at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6132-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=1313&start=0 Not many shops will alert people to this issue because it would run up a bill and inflict too much time educating the users. (NO OFFENSE INTENDED HERE!) Now that we've got a good idea it's not heat related, we move to &quot;other items.&quot; Bob

They work in my shop but not at my customers site. I have tried putting in a new power circuit and using surge protectors. The cpu and power fans work perfectly. I get lockups while in the bios or when windows starts or has been running for 20-30 min. I think it may be related to the wireless G communications card (Dlink). It works on some networks but not on others. Do you have a wireless card in the pc?
