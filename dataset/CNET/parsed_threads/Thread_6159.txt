<s> I have a Wi-Fi booster that can connect to remote distance networks, and I want to share the Wireless Networks that the booster connects to all the local computers in its range (maybe in Ad-Hoc?). </s>
<s> The computer that has the booster has it's own separate built-in Wi-Fi. </s>
<s> Is this possible? </s>
<s> For example, the booster gets a signal from Wi-Fi network A, and I want Network A to be broadcast to the computers who can't receive Network A's signal. </s>
<s> I really don't mind how this is done, preferably without having to buy new hardware. </s>
<s> My old setup at the farm was to place a WiFi BRIDGE on the window sill and then run that to a common WiFi router. </s>
<s> I might use post 19 in the CNET NETWORKING FORUM STICKY to aid in such a setup. </s>
