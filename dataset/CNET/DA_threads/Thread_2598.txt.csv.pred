1.1.1	Was using a Linksys router running on a G network for almost 8 months now .	St
1.1.2	My PC and laptop use this router .	St
1.1.3	I 've had a load of problems with the router and have decided to move on to an N network router from D Link .	St
1.1.4	My question is , do I need to do anything in terms of & quot ; ridding & quot ; the PC and laptop of the previous network they were running on before I create a new connection to the new router ?	Ques
1.1.5	I do n't want any signs of the Linksys router around when I attempt to hook up the D Link one .	St
1.2.1	& quot ; discovery & quot ; software to help you connect to the other router .	St
1.2.2	Otherwise , just yank the old and install the new .	St
1.2.3	You 'll need get into its web interface to do a little configuring so knowing it 's IP address would help .	St
1.2.4	The defaults will be somewhere in the instructions .	St
1.2.5	You should change the username/password for the router while you 're in there , decide whether you want to do static addressing or use DHCP or maybe a mix of both .	St
1.2.6	But this does n't find it 's way to your PC unless you plug the gateway address into your network settings manually .	St
