1.1.1	I want to replace the motherboard on my old Gateway 832GM .	St
1.1.2	I want to replace it with a newer motherboard compatible with 2nd gen. intel i3 or i5 .	St
1.1.3	any suggestions since it is an old batx form chassis .	St
1.1.4	if the computer faces you the chassis opens on the right side .	St
1.2.1	If the PC is that old , I strongly suggest you just leave it .	St
1.2.2	Bite the bullet and get a new case or least a more newer spacious type , in order to benefit the install of the i3/i5 mtrbd. , and start with a better foundation as it were .	St
1.2.3	Not to pick on you , but sometimes its better this way .	St
1.2.4	If you 're trying to save costs , then rethink what would happen it after all is said and done , after shoe-honing the new mtrbd .	St
1.2.5	in and maybe finding a PSU that fits , etc. , you may bump up against some issue that was easily resolved with a newer case .	St
1.2.6	You can simply just lay the parts out and connect them minus the case to see if they work and final mount them into the Gateway case if you like .	St
1.2.7	Your main consideration is space , will a new mtrbd .	St
1.2.8	fit .	St
1.2.9	Typical OEM based PCs tend to be build with *only* its details in mind , so they do n't provide an ease of install for other full-blown upgrades .	St
1.2.10	But , if its generic enough it may be workable .	St
1.2.11	I just find OEM based PCs just get into problems all to easily on the most basic level , usually physical size and/or spacing .	St
1.2.12	What has happened with newer PCs is the basic PC has more cooling and better PSU and ram additions or similar details .	St
1.2.13	All this boils down that a new PC , a DIY should also follow a similar path .	St
1.2.14	A better wattage PSU ( amps too ) and additional ram slots with leads to better cooling demands , plus any video upgrades .	St
1.2.15	Even if non-gaming use PC , the new i3/i5 will expect no less .	St
1.2.16	If for gaming then you better think all that in mind beforehand .	St
1.2.17	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	I totally agree with Willy , you would be better off setting up a new system from scratch .	St
1.3.2	Use the old Gateway as secondary system and base a new unit on newer technology , you will have much better results .	St
1.3.3	Shop around online for components , Newegg and others , there are always deals and sales on hardware plus it is a lot of fun designing your own set up .	St
1.3.4	Have fun and good luck ! !	St
1.3.5	!	St
