another driver.
many think they can use a pc as delivered without worry about drivers.
this is sadly not true.
since you revealed the make and model, here are the 2 drivers i would install.
but first, if you used your service like this...  you would see what they offer.
notice how some items are in the year 2007?
are you keeping up?
see item 1 at  since the dimension 2400 offered three different audio cards i can't offer which driver i'd use until you tell me a bit more.
