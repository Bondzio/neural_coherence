Each cable plugged into a USB port on the laptops. The cables connected to USB to serial converters. The computers indicated that the cables were connected to com ports. This setup had been working, but I upgraded some software and I think that some settings got overwritten. I kept getting messages that the computers were not connecting. What should I do? Any help would be great. Thanks.

Since the previous version of this software was working, and the software upgrade process said nothing about changing the hardware, I would like to leave the hardware in place. Thanks.
