On my machine I have a diabetes monitor on com 1 and a blood pressure monitor on com 2. Both pieces of equipment work fine on my machine. My wife just got the same equipment as me and I connected them to the com ports on her machine. None of the equipment is found when we try to use them. I checked to make sure that the ports are enabled and they are. The settings on hers are the same as mine. I connected her equipment to my computer and they work fine. I can't seem to figure out what is wrong. Can anyone help?

In device manager they both show up and when you hit properties they indicate they are functioning correctly? If yes then are you both running the same software that talks to them? (meaning by identical you have the exact same hardware and software configuration). If they don't show up in device manager than they could have been disabled in the BIOS setup. As Bob says if the system is new and custom - take it back with a description of your problem.
