<s> i have a dell pentium d i945express chipset 2 gb ram 7800 gt 512mb OC I want the 8800 gtx for the upcoming crysis so i looked at a new core 2 duo chip but aparently it wont work on my motherboard so i shall build my own system next year. </s>
<s> The thing is i can afford the 8800 GTX now (with a new 600 watt power unit). </s>
<s> I get bottleneck at the moment on my current card. </s>
<s> so of course i would get bottleneck on the 8800 but will i see any performance increase because of this bottleneck or will the card take the load from the CPU? </s>
<s> many thanks in advance kazicameron </s>
<s> If you can afford the GTX now, I say wait, and when you can build your computer, GTX will be even cheaper. </s>
<s> The Cpu will bottleneck the GTX. </s>
<s> Though games that are very graphic intensive will raise the fps quite a bit. </s>
<s> But its not worth using a outdated CPU with a top of the line card. </s>
