<s> System: Dual monitors (before, 2 CRT, now 1 LCD, 1 CRT) Windows XP Before I took my PC to shop, system monitors were going to sleep 10 minutes after boot up. </s>
<s> At shop, both screens working without going to sleep. </s>
<s> When I brought back home, unpacked new LCD monitor, cabled both monitors to machine, booted up, both went to sleep at first within a few minutes, now they're both going to sleep at boot up. </s>
<s> Graphics card was replaced, so this is not the problem. </s>
<s> Please help, this is my business and I am losing money. </s>
<s> Thats not a good sign. </s>
<s> Since you don't see the BIOS, Windows booting or even a beep (not noted in your post) the machine has likely failed. </s>
<s> Nothing in your post tells me that its not the machine. </s>

<s> What I don't understand is why the system works at the shop but not at home. </s>
<s> I've even tried plugging various parts of the system into the wall directly, bypassing the surge protector, to no avail. </s>
<s> That's the rub. </s>
<s> Your AC cord could be bad, the machine could be on its side at home, upright at shop. </s>
<s> Etc. </s>
<s> As it stands, as described, it's a dead PC. </s>

<s> Time to ask for a house call. </s>
