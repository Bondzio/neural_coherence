its quite small, about lets say a notebook.
only choice because &quot;costco is cheaper&quot; is what my parents say but in the end i choosed between 150 and 250. pros: -comes with wd syn -small -from 60-250gb cons: -the wire is small i got mine around 90$ to back up my dad's music one day when the music was missing due to system recovery long time ago.
