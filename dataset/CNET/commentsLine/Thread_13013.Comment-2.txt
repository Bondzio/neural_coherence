in the bios if you can get that far.
if all looks good in there, make sure you are set to try to boot from cd/dvd drive first.
then try a live linux cd or ultimate boot cd and start check devices for a failure.
it could have been memory or a heat build up or just a hardware failure.
if you can boot into one of the above cd's more than likely you can find the problem.
