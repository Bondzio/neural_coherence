So upgraded my 300W to a 450W. Was getting error message on boot saying that not enough power was going to the graphics card so it was lowering performance so as not to damage hardware. So I got a 600W PSU put in there, and still the same thing is happening. Why? And what do I try next?

I got that message on a system a few weeks ago. In one there was a place near the bottom of the mobo to connect a 4 pin molex to.
