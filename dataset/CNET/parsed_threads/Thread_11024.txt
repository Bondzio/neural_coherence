<s> Hi, I have a hard drive IDE , but I cant access to my data so I decided 2 format it and recover it after that,but I cant format it . </s>
<s> please help to solve this problem. </s>
<s> Thank U. </s>
<s> I assume you know that once you have reformatted a hard drive there will not be any data to recover? </s>
<s> Or did I not understand your post correctly? </s>
<s> Tell us more. </s>
<s> What are you attempting to do, and why? </s>
<s> Which OS, and what make/model computer? </s>
<s> Is this hard drive the one with your Operating System, (OS), on it? </s>
<s> If so, how are you trying to reformat it? </s>
<s> Generally, you cannot reformat a hard drive which has the OS installed, whilst you are logged in to that OS. </s>
<s> The OS will not let itself be deleted like that. </s>
<s> You will need to format it using tools with the OS not loaded. </s>
<s> Why can't you access the data? </s>
<s> What error messages do you see? </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> You offer nothin in how or what the PC is. </s>
<s> If you simply plan to format, I suggest now you google and then use KILLDISK or DBAN pgms. </s>
<s> that totally wipe out the HD. </s>
<s> Then, reformat using the windoze OS disc, I suspect to reuse the HD. </s>
<s> There will be no data to recover unless, the data is on another HD or partition(?). </s>
<s> tada ------Willy </s>
<s> Is this an EXTERNAL hard drive? </s>
<s> Very confusing post. </s>
<s> Now I have XP but the speed is very low so I wanna instal 98 and I need the driver. </s>
<s> Today if you want to do that you research using google. </s>
<s> Sometimes you find drivers, sometimes you don't. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Your question seems unrelated to the subject of this thread. </s>
<s> Please start a new thread and be sure to tell more about your hardware and what driver you need. </s>
