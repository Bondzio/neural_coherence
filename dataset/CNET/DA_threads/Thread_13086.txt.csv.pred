1.1.4	I used to be an avid PC gamer back in the day, but was forced to (briefly) retire due to my responsibilities at college.	St
1.1.5	The fact that my roommate owned a PS3 didn't help either.	St
1.1.6	Regardless, I've gotten to a point where I would like to begin upgrading my computer for use with today's PC games.	St
1.1.7	Obviously things have changed in my absence, and I could use some help getting back to speed.	St
1.1.8	I've got an old emachines computer, of which I've replaced many of the parts.	St

1.1.10	That being said, what are some qualities one would look for in a motherboard?	St
1.1.11	RAM, PCI-E, and processor slots are all key I'm sure, but am I missing anything?	St
1.1.12	Would anyone be able to recommend a good processor/motherboard combo?	Ques

1.1.14	I'm sure NVidia/Raedon are still big players - could anyone give me some advice on those?	Sug
1.1.15	Thanks for your time & help.	St
1.2.1	Boards that I find at tomshardware.com that are used to benchmark video cards.	St
