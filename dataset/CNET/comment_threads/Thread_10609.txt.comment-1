I have lost the use of the Geforce graphics card I installed over a year ago.
I have an IBM Netvista with Windows ME o/s.
I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but windows keeps defaulting back to the Intel video card the computer came with.
I can not figure out how to disable the Intel card and enable the GeForce card so that my system defaults to it.
When I plug my monitor into the GeForce card I get a blank screen.
I have to plug back into the original port to see anything on the monitor.
I am as fustrated as can be.
Any ideas are welcome.
Thanks, Todd
