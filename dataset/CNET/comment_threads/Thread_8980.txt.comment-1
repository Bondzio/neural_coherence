A friend has a laptop and wants me to add an external HDD (via USB) to it.
It's a relatively old system (166 mgz) running Win98.
48 megs of Ram My question is what would be the limit of hard drive this system could detect.
He's looking at buying a 6 Gig drive.
Is there a general rule of thumb to determine this systems' HD limit or would I need to provide more info?
Thank you
