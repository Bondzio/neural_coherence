i need to quickly and inexpensively create a network for transfering files between two computers.
laptop (vista) getting internet over wifi (net not needed for this operation) and desktop(xp sp2).
is a crossover cable required or can i just ethernet them to each other (hasn't worked yet)?
are there special settings to configure or should something just pop up.
