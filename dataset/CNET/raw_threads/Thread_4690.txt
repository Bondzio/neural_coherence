My wireless network symbol in lower right corner indicates I'm connected to my wireless router however, no webpage cannot be displayed. This must be some kind of firewall problem but can't figure it out.

The icon in your taskbar that indicates you are &quot;connected&quot; means only that you are successfully connected to your router. That doesn't mean that your router made the proper connection to your cable/DSL modem. The router needs to be configured according to the instructions that your ISP provides for using a router with their service. Internet --- modem --- router &gt; &gt; &gt; computers This usually means setting the router to &quot;PPPoE&quot; for DSL or &quot;Automatic DHCP&quot; for cable service. Sometimes MAC Address cloning is required. Don't rely on me, though. You need to follow the instructions from your ISP for configuring your router. * * * * * Also, make sure your router has the latest firmware.

I am even connected to msn messenger. However, IE 7 cannot display a single web page. The problem started suddenly one day - I had not touched any settings (at least intentionally). Please help.

Other people can connect to my wireless network and bring up webpages, but I can't using my laptop. Mylalptop also does not bring up webpages when I am staying at a hotel and accessing their wireless network. There has to be something on my laptop that I am not using. My desktop calls the wireless network &quot;smith&quot;, but my laptop calls it &quot;linksys.&quot; I am considering deleting the network on both computers, then trying to set up the network again. It all went haywire when I changed from a DSL connection to fiber optics. My laptop works fine at work on my work LAN. I uncheck the LAN box when I get it to my house, so that is not the problem.

An ADSL modem/router has an address(consult the user's nanual) - http://xxx.xx.xxx.....etc . where you set the modem with details from your ISP, e.g. DNS, username, IP, password, type of connection, etc. One of the items is whether to enable NAT or not. For your particular problem, it seems that your wireless network &quot;SSID&quot; is smith, and your desktop has the wrong SSID. Try to configure your laptop wireless adaptor to detect all available networks, or right click the connection icon ans choose &quot;repair&quot;. This may also solve your peoblem at the hotel.

It may help to &quot;enable broadcast SSID&quot; at the wireless access point/router. It can be disabled later if so desired. Note that it takes time for networks to be detected, and once detected, to get connected. Connection may fail if the signal is not strong enough, although the signal may have been detected.

I have also tried adding the laptop to the desktop network by running the wizard again and transfering the the configuration on a flash disk. Still, smith does not show up on the desktop. It looks like I had better get a hold of my ISP. Thanks for trying to help. Jane
