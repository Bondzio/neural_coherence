about honey,it will dry up and turn to sugar in time,now twinkie on the other hand will last for years and years,they say they can last for more than 50 years if keep in a cool dry place,now thats some life expectancy.the food will almost out live you lol.the food that will be around long after there is no other food options left.i could go on about the food shortage problems in the future,but i think we are all aware of the enviable,there will be no food due to globle warming,famine,drought and so on.the future is bleak,so enjoy what you have now.
