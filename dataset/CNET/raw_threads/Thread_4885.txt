The best price I can get on the repair is $250 which is about half of what I paid for the laptop 2 years ago. I have loved this thing, but dont love vista. So my should I just buy a new computer or fix this one? And If I go for a new one what would be a good idea? It has a 320gb hard drive and 4gb ram, with a intell core 2 duo. I am a college student going into my last year, and this things computing power has been more than enough since I don't play a lot of games.

However, if your laptop is only the HD that is bad. AND! you have the recovery/restore discs, then get a new HD, a 250gb is round $60 or so and reloading the OS, etc. should be a snap. You can try to recover data from old HD using an ext. USB case that accepts your old HD. The cost for a HD replacement and such is far cheaper. If you need the recovery/restore discs, then try ther vendor support, most sell them for very low cost and/or 3rd party vendors that offer OEM type restore/recovery discs. Again, all this is cheaper than buying new. Up to you. tada -----Willy
