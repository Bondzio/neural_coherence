Printers have &quot;enable sharing&quot; turned on (the little hand icon appears). Laptop is Vista Home Premium. Running Norton. When I tell the laptop to search for printers on the wireless network, it never finds them. I should note that my previous laptop (Windows XP) never had an issue connecting to the same PC's same printers that I am trying to connect to now. Very strange. Is this a Vista -&gt; XP issue? I have poked around in the McAfee setting and I don't see anything obviuos blocking the printer sharing. Also, as I mentioned, it worked fine with my old laptop, and I haven't touched the McAfee settings. Thanks

Restarted the pc and checked on the laptop...still doesn't find the shared printers plugged into the PC. The PC DOES show up on the Vista network map. However, when I click the PC's icon, it just opens up Media Player and accesses the media I have on that computer (which I was able to do before that patch as well). Help!

7986	7	287552	2728972	2727924	ezatnova	3/14/08 4:48 AM	1.20547008E12	Only &quot;Media Devices&quot; recognized	In case it helps, I want to reinforce that even after I installed the &quot;vista thing&quot; on the xp machine, my laptop shows the pc as &quot;Media Devices&quot;...not like a real computer I can click into and brose te shared folders and printers, like I used to be able to do with my old xp laptop. If I click the PC's icon, it just opens WMP because it thinks it's a Media Device!

7986	10	287552	2729035	2728972	ezatnova	3/14/08 7:11 AM	1.20547866E12	another thing	Also, the PC can see the laptop fine, and all of its shared folders...just not the laptop-&gt;PC (and hence the printers)

Again, Network Magic removes the need for you to learn about accounts, permissions, firewalls, network names and more. If you want to do it manually, please check each area in depth. Bob
