I have a Win CE6 device that communicates with USB flash drives.
I want to be able to connect the Win CE6 device to a PC using USB connections.
I can't make changes (hw or sw) to the Win CE6 device.
I am looking for cable/hardware that has two USB ends.
One end looks like a standard USB flash drive, it connects to the Win CE6 device without any changes to that device.
The other end connects to the PC and allows some of the PC memory to appear as a USB flash drive to the Win CE6 device.
Read only access to the PC memory is ok for my purposes.
Any products available like this?
Thanks, Lachlan
