i was on the verge of buying a new psu for my hp xw6000 workstation when i read on several forums that they may not work as some manufacturers use motherboards designed to be compatible with proprietary psus only.
is there a converter plug or something i can use to make them compatible?
i dont want to have to fork out on another standard psu when i could get a higher quality, less noisy, more efficient psu.
btw, i am considering changing my psu as the computer emits an annoying high pitched whine.
i have exhausted other reasons: not the monitor, cleaned the inside of dust and put the cpu on the floor away from speakers.
the whine comes on when i boot and stays all the time...not intermittent.
i read it could be due to failing capacitors and a psu change is called for...apparently those bundled in cpu packages tend to be less than top quality.
if i am barking up the wrong tree, then some advice would be appreciated!
