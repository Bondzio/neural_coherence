1.1.1	I purchased the sbg900 earlier this week and i am using the wireless for two macbooks and an xbox 360. i have a WEP password on it and i had to put the 360 on the nat passthrough so i could connect to xbox live.	St
1.1.2	The problem i am having is that everytime i turn on the 360 or either one of the macbooks they will not connect to it so i have to unplug the sbg900 and then try to connect to it again.	St
1.1.3	It always connects after i unplug it but it is just extremely annoying having to unlpug the modem/router every time i want to connect to the internet.	St
1.2.1	In our forum sticky we don't suggest WEP, filters or much else fancy.	St
1.2.2	You are repeating well worn problems.	St
1.2.3	Good luck.	St
