<s> hi i want to upgrade my p/s but i want to know if its going to be compatible with my mobo. </s>
<s> right now i have one of 200 watts and i'd like to get one of at least 400 watts or maybe more. </s>
<s> what should i know before doing such step and what brands are reliable? </s>
<s> operating system windows xp compaq presario s3100nx AMD Athlon XP2200+ 1.8 GHz PGA462 Socket A Total Expansion Slots (3) PCI (1) AGP 4X 1.5v hope this info can be enough and thanks for any help. </s>
<s> well good brands would be ocz, antec, enermax, and some thermaltake units. </s>
<s> take a look at newegg.com </s>
<s> everyone should replace the psus in oem pcs. </s>
<s> (IMO) it will be quieter, more stable, create less heat and make ur pc happy. </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> I was surprised that it came with a lite-on psu. </s>
<s> Really junk though. </s>
<s> But even more surprising is it comes with dual +12v rails. </s>
<s> But still the psu is crappy with very low +12V rail voltages. </s>
<s> But its 400watt and has dual +12V rails, pretty good. </s>
<s> This is the compaq sa4000t Roger </s>
<s> a 450 PSU should be more than adequate. </s>
<s> I am over here in the uk and H/W is more expensive. </s>
<s> I bought a new PC case which inclused a 450w psu and found it was a better idea as the price of both was little more that the stand individual PSU i would have bought regards ........ John </s>
