i think i'd take it to a service center.
and hopefully a lesson is learned.
backup.
all my data i don't want to loose gets backed up to an external hd, and that data is backed up to dvd data disks.
i have three copies.
having all your important &quot;stuff&quot; on only one drive is asking for trouble.
good luck.
