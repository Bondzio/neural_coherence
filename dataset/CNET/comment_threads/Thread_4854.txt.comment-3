seeing Seagate is the laggard in SSD.
FUD won't work and it is Seagate which will become the niche player, in high end high cap disks for servers, cloud and externals.
Unfortunately for disk mfrs, none have made an aggressive move to counter the disruption of SSDs.
Too bad, and sad, to see more storied brands and companies become invisible to consumers.
