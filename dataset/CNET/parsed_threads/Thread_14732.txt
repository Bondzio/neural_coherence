<s> I have a 2wire gateway on a desktop PC, a wireless notebook and a 2nd desktop with a linkys wireless adapter. </s>
<s> All XP machines. </s>
<s> My problem is file sharing. </s>
<s> The 1st PC and laptop were OK initially, I added the 3rd wireless desktop and it can access the shared printers of the first 2 - but they can't access the new PC. </s>
<s> Then all 3 couldn't share at all - so I reran the nework setup and made sure the firewall is defaulted off. </s>
<s> Now 1 & 2 can read the original Windows shared file of each machine, but not my files I have set as shared in both. </s>
<s> Also they still can't reach the 3rd desktop at all - same error message says I ''don't have the rights to access - see admin' for both scenarios. </s>
<s> Frustrated - help? </s>
<s> Re-running the network setup disk was the what caused problem with your shared files. </s>
<s> (re-share) Re-set the share this file setting of the files you can't see. </s>
<s> You could also try system restore on your first two PC's, if no date prior to the 3rd computers system add date, restore is not an option. </s>
<s> The 3rd PC is it Home or Pro? </s>
<s> Pro XP has a problem with peer to peer networks. </s>
<s> Wireless complicates the matter. </s>
<s> Do you use a router or is it an adhoc wireless Network? </s>
<s> There are several reasons possible for this, but the printer access clears up some of them. </s>
<s> Is it part of the MSHOME network or is it WORKGROUP network? </s>
<s> This is an XP pro issue. </s>
<s> Home XP is MSHOME and Pro is WORKGROUP. </s>
<s> This caused me the same problem. </s>
<s> if this doesn't solve the problem, please post more on the wireless setup and Xp pro of home? </s>
