Actually as i have mentioned in my first post itself that I am also not able to change any permission setting for the drive.
it shows &quot;unable to save the changes in permission information&quot;.
and same error windows have no access to this object.
I think this is not a permission issue because in this case it is not even showing the disk capacity when I check properties.
