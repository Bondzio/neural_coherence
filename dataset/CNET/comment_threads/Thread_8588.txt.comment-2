just make sure it's jumpered correctly with the Master that's on the same cable.
Then if there's anything you want from it, you can use windows Explorer to drag and drop to your current drive....then format the slave by rightclicking and choosing format right from Explorer.
Shut down and remove it (make sure the Master is jumpered correctly again to what it was before).
