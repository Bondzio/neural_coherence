Thanks for the help guys.
I set it up again from scratch and made a tiny improvement in that my laptop would connect for a while (a minute or so) before disconnecting itself.
I've bought a new router, so I'm praying the problem is the old router and not the settings, or else I've just bought a new router that won't work either Thanks again.
