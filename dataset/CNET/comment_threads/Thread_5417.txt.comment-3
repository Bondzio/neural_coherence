I got the external enclosure, plugged in my old desktop HD (was running XP), and connected it by USB to my notebook (also running XP).
No problem detecting and reading the drive ... except: I could not get into my folder, I did not have access.
The program files, shared files, all other folders were accessible, just the &quot;my documents.&quot; I guess my login under the XP OS from my old drive is still necessary, but I can't get any prompt to get in.
How can I access this folder when I am using this HD as a secondary drive?
