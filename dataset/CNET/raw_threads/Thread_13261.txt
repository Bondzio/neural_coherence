Does anyone know why the division by 2 is necessary?? How can I know if the correct number is 2 or 3 or ...?? Hernn.

You may have a bigger goal in mind but between this post and your other post I can't see what you are attempting to figure out that a simple link test couldn't answer. Maybe you are trying to figure out what the maximum transfer rate is but given &quot;reality&quot; items such as the client or host ACK time is variable then I can write that I've yet to find the mathematical models to match the real world. Most of the error is the delay in the acks. Bob

Wireless B = 70 sec Wireless G = 47 sec (router set in mixed Mode) Wireless G = 36 sec (router set in G Mode only) Wireless N = 12 sec (Belkin Pre N hardware) Wired NIC = 4 sec (Wired 10/100 ethernet)
