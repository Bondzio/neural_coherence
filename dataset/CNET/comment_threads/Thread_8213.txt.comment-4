the only question is what resolution your laptop can output.
it should be optimally be configured for 1920x1280.
other resolutions may be stretched and/or 'fuzzy'.
1920x1280 shouldn't require any special cable.
just get a $10 cable from office depot or target, preferably with ferrite cores (the cylindrical bulges on both ends of the cable).
