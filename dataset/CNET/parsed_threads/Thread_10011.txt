<s> Hi, i'm connecting my laptop up to a touchscreen in the car, anyone know of a way of having the CRT ouput of the Savage graphics card always enabled? </s>
<s> Every time you disconnect the VGA output it disables it and u need to go into display properties e.t.c... not much good for conveniently chucking the laptop in the car. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> My laptop has a convenient Funtion-F5 hotkey that I use for enabling screen or external video. </s>
<s> Never noticed if they had another method. </s>
