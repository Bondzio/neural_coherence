I used a cloning program and it worked without a hitch. I kept the partition between O/S and data but proportionately bigger. Recently I lost data & want to reconnect old HD to transfer the lost data across. unfortunately it asked for a boot disk which I don't have nor a floppy drive. Do I need one? Will the O/S on older HD conflict when both old & new HD are connected? Can anyone shed some light? Regards Illya PS. O/S = XP Home Edition

Just properly slave the other drive or temporarily connect it to another IDE port until finished. XP will see this as a hardware change, however, and the meter keeps running until enough of these prompt a reactivation.

How do I 'properly slave the other drive or temporarily connect it to another IDE port until finished'? Can you please give me a quick run down or link me to an appropriate site. Either way, thank you very much for your help Steven. I assume I go into 'bios' and slave it there. Can I slave it before I connect it?
