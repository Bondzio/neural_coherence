1182	0	376310	3211119	NR	OrionOmega	1/1/10 7:05 PM	1.2623727E12	Heatsink and Fan	I have a desktop computer with an Intel Celeron processor, but is just 1.8ghz, so i'm thinking in buying an Intel Celeron Dual Core 2.2ghz (Is just and everyday computer, but I want to play Spore Galactic Adventures and with 1.8ghz I can't) so I found one at great price. But I wonder, Do I need to buy another heatsink and fan to my desktop, or the ones from my old Celeron work just fine? Thanks in advance for your replies.
