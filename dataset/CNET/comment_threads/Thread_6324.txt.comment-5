But My board # is AAC27646-206 which seems to rule out the top 8 processors on the list or am I missing something?
It seems I can only use a CPU with 512 L2 cache or again do I not understand?
And after googling the only CPU I could find like that over 3 gb was that board.
And its too expensive I can almost get a new board and CPU for that price.
Does that board require the Northwood CPU?
Thanks again
