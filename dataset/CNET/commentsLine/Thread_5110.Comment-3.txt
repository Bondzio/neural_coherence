if you aren't going to use the computer for more than a couple of hours, i would shut it down.
the time saved by using the hibernate function is minimal, and i'm sorry microsoft, but hibernate has always had problems.
sleep is a viable option for short durations, such as an hour or less, and/or if you need your computer to be up and running in a real hurry.
but powering it down and allowing windows to reboot when you need it, will always save you money, hardware usage, and headaches.
if you are in a hurry to reboot windows, try a solid state drive for your operating system and programs.
mine boots faster from scratch than it ever did coming out of sleep mode with a regular hard disk drive, and with fewer glitches.
that's just my experienced layman's opinion.
