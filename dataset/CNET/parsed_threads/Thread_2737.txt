<s> I did the scan and it showed &quot;safe, nasty unknown&quot; under the 'kind' category. </s>
<s> The other categories did not reveal any information. </s>
<s> The computer is not opening anything except internet. </s>
<s> The error message states 'internet explorer has encountered a problem and needs to close'. </s>
<s> Post your HJT log and tell if Firefox works. </s>
