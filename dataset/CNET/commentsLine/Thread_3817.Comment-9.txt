i think i got the bios figured out.
and have the onboard disabled.
i didn't find the items you told me to look for but i found similar items in these menus: advanced&gt;chipset&gt;internal graphics&gt; under int.
gra.
it lists primary video controller = gfxo-gpp-igfx-pci, uma framesize buffer, surround view (this i disabled), amd 780 hd audio, display port config (this i disabled), 1394 controller.
so i think i got it disabled.
as for the hdd i have uninstalled generals and defragmented all drives that needed it.
was some nice defragmentation.
i have yet to reinstall generals so i will have to wait till saturday afternoon.
you think my install issue might be one of the ram sticks?
hmmm i'll have to try that one on saturday as well.
this is where i stand for the moment.
i'll check again on saturday, and update as i go.
