<s> I have decided to build my own gaming rig to shave some $, and I am in need of some guidance. </s>
<s> So far I've semi-decided on the following parts: Motherboard- -ASUS P5N-T Deluxe Motherboard Video Card -EVGA GeForce 9800 GT Video Card Processor- -Q9650 Intel Core 2 Quad Proc Hard-drive- -Western Digital Caviar SE16 500GB RAM -Kingston 1GB(x3) 667MHz DDR2 I know that I haven't listed an optical drive, case or monitor but that's not really a concern. </s>
<s> Anyway, my question is, am I missing anything important? </s>
<s> Is this a terrible mixture of components? </s>
<s> Am I off my rocker? </s>
<s> Any help, advice, suggestions or guidance would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> proposing...most of us don't have time to look them up. </s>
<s> So the easier you make...the better chance you'll have for getting help. </s>
<s> Feel free to start with the ASUS MB but it looks to me like its really a crapshoot or just crap. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&DEPA=0&Order=BESTMATCH&Description=ASUS+P5N-T+Deluxe&x=0&y=0 You didn't indicate a PSU...pretty important component and 1GB RAM ain't enough for a high-end PC with a Q9650. </s>
<s> I'd also look at the WD640GB...the WD6400AAKS or WD6401AALS. </s>

<s> Good idea. </s>
<s> REPOST! </s>
<s> Motherboard- -ASUS P5N-T Deluxe Motherboard http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?modelmenu=1&model=1981&l1=3&l2=11&l3=610&l4=0 Video Card -EVGA GeForce 9800 GT Video Card http://www.ncix.com/products/index.php?sku=33091&vpn=512-P3-N971-TR&manufacture=eVGA Processor- -Q9650 Intel Core 2 Quad Proc http://processorfinder.intel.com/details.aspx?sSpec=SLB8W Hard-drive- -Western Digital Caviar SE16 500GB http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2795126 RAM- -Kingston 1GB(x3) 667MHz DDR2 http://www.jr.com/kingston/pe/KGS_KVR667D2S51/ I totally forgot to mention the PSU, but I've one that works so no problems there. </s>
<s> As for the RAM I indicated 3X but that was probably too small, sorry. </s>
<s> The motherboard is where most of my uncertainty lies and I'm definitely not set in my ways with regard to that particular one. </s>
<s> you've paired a high-end mobo, high-end cpu, with a mid-range video card and low-end ram. </s>
<s> if you don't plan on SLI, don't get an SLI mobo. </s>
<s> an asus p5q pro is nearly half the price and will perform better. </s>
<s> if you do plan on SLI in the future, an asus p5n-d (based on 750i chipset which doesn't have the flaky issues of the 780i) is a better choice. </s>
<s> the 3ghz q9650 won't improve your gaming experience much when compared to a 2.8 q9550, but the q9550 should save you at least $200CAD. </s>
<s> use the money you saved to upgrade to a radeon hd 4870 or geforce gtx 260 and 2x2gb ddr2-1066. </s>
<s> you'll should still wind up saving at least $150CAD but have a faster gaming rig. </s>
<s> Re the 3 GBs RAM....OK if you get 2 @ 1GB and 2 @ 512MB but you don't want 3 @ 1GBs ... you need RAM in pairs to maximize system performance. </s>
<s> If it were mine, I'd just bump it to 4GB RAM total....then there's no need to worry about upgrading later. </s>
<s> Re the MB....ditto my comments above. </s>
<s> While ASUS usually makes decent MBs...buyer comments on the model you've proposed are poor at best. </s>
<s> Re the HDD....WD640GB has better ratings and higher density per platter. </s>
<s> Last....re PSU....make sure it's a decent PSU..there's lots of pretty ones that aren't worth anything. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I see what you're saying about the proc, seems like a waste of money to get one that surpasses my reqs. </s>
<s> Any thoughts on how the Core 2 Duo E8400 Wolfdale 3.0GHz would hold up? </s>
<s> It seems like enough and I've heard a lot of good things about it. </s>
<s> http://www.ncix.com/products/index.php?sku=27784&vpn=bx80570e8400&manufacture=intel . </s>
<s> As for the mobo/graphics card combo, I can see myself going sli in the future, so the p5q pro you suggested seems like a good choice. </s>
<s> With that extra money in mind, I could go upgrade to the gtx 260 like you suggested and spring for a better hd and ram, (any preferences on the latter?) </s>
