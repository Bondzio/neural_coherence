&quot;I have HP cd12 cd-writer (software identified as cd12d, HP label marked as C9631).
Firmware version was LKS2.
But it was some problems with modern high-speed media, and I can't find newest firmware from HP (see ftp://ftp.hp.com/pub/information_st...tware/fwrev.bin - newest firmware version is OKS2 version, but it's not present on HP ftp).
Today I download newest firmware LS23 from Lite-On LTR-12101B (because one string on the writer case label is LTR-12101B)&quot; Just one of many examples where the dirty secret is HP doesn't make the drive.
They buy OEM units and re-label.
Your version of the HP CD12 (there are a through f?)
may indeed be this drive.
I'm sure that with some registry magic, you can have it show in the Device Manager as whatever you want, but I avoid such hoop jumping for reasons you can imagine.
