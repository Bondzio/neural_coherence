what operating system (and service pack number) are you using?
if you are using windows xp, you need to at least have service pack 1 (sp1) installed to use hard drives over 137gb.
i have not experienced any major differences between ata/100 and ata/133.
your motherboard is ata/100; however, you still can install an ata/133 drive.
it will be compatible.
you have two ata slots on the motherboard, each capable of handling two drives (making four total).
maxtor wants you to spend money on an ata hard drive controller card that supports ata/133 if your integrated ata hard drive controller is only ata/100.
it is not required/necessary.
another issue i see is finding space to insert the drive inside that case.
try not stack one hard drive directly on top of another with, say, only a cm between them.
heat is the enemy of computer components, including hard drives.
if you have a free 5.25'' drive bay, you could put the drive there as an option.
if you ever have to install a pci card for any reason, you can use combination cards to fit all of your functionality.
for example, you can have usb, firewire, and a 10/100 network port all on one pci card.
