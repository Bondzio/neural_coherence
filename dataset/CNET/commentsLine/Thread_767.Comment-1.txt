i was thinking of buying a 60 dollar new amd xp 2000 or 2200 and putting it in place of my current t-bird.
nowadays they run pretty cheap (60 or so).
is it worth it since my ram is so slow?
would this be an easy install?
ive never done a processor replacement but i've done pretty much everything else.
thanks!
