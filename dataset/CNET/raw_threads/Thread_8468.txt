It seems to install and then after words it does not go into the application folder. I had to map the ip address to the printer to connect to it. It prints right now I just want to get the cannon printer software to work. The software does not work on windows xp or vista.

Download the current firmware from here http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&tabact=DownloadDetailTabAct&fcategoryid=335&modelid=14980 Click on it. It will prompt you when to connect your printer. Rick
