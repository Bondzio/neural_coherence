<s> I have a HP 8775C desktop. </s>
<s> I have a AGP slot but can't figure out what it is. </s>
<s> 2x? </s>
<s> 4x? </s>
<s> Without opening the case to look at the slot how do you tell. </s>
<s> If you go to HP and look at the motherboard configuration, it just has a box that says AGP slot. </s>
<s> I have looked in the pamphlet that came with it and can't figure it out. </s>
<s> Your system could have onboard graphics GPU or a separate AGP video card in the AGP slot. </s>
<s> Your docs should indicate ...if not...you'll probably have to go inside. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Go into the BIOS to your video settings. </s>
<s> When you enter, it should have the Onboard option, AGP options, and an auto configuration. </s>
<s> When you enter into the AGP options, it should have speeds indicated. </s>
<s> If it simply says AGP, or if you can select AUTO, a 4X/8X will do fine. </s>
<s> If you install an AGP card, disable the onboard graphics controller in the Windows DEVICE MANAGER prior to installing the card. </s>
