To my surprise, it does not seem to display video any faster than the Intel video that is built into the motherboard. Other owners have commented on increased redraw speed but I cannot tell any difference. I have downloaded and installed the latest ATI drivers. I run a pretty standard clone computer with an intel 845g chipset, 512 megs of ram, XP home edition and a 1.8 ghz processor. Is there some configuration utility or method that I am missing to kick this card into high gear?

If yes, the PCI bus runs at half the speed or less than the AGP bus and is not a dedicated bus. It is shared with other PCI cards. However, I dfo know that ATI drivers can be a bear to install properly.

Outside of gaming, your integrated intel graphics are just as good as any other video card.
