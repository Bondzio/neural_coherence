Dual channel RAM need to be in pairs or else they get lonely and quit working... well dual channel RAM is faster by provide parallel performance to your applications.
depend on your motherboard, which can have 2 or 4 slots, you can support up to 4GB (4 x 1GB) or 2GB (4 x 512 MB or 2 x 1 GB) Some chipset don't support up to 4 GB even with 4 slots, so check your specs with Fresh Diagnose or contact your manufacture.
I recommend a DDR or GDDR3 video card for better performance, which means they do not say TurboCache or HyperMemory.
