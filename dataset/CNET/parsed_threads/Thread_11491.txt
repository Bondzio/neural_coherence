<s> I am in the process of building a computer and don't know what Graphics card to get. </s>
<s> I will not be doing any gaming but I do plan on doing video editing, photo editing using Adobe CS 3 and quite possible using dual monitors. </s>

<s> http://www.pcworld.com/article/2040319/build-the-ultimate-intel-haswell-pc-for-under-1000.html I like a lot about that. </s>
<s> I could skip the SSD and change the GPU to what I noted above. </s>
<s> Do you know if the integrated graphics on the Haswell is much better than the one on Intel's DZ77GA-70K with Core i7-3770, which is the one that I have been contemplating buying. </s>
<s> If not then I might be better of buying 2 of these: GIGABYTE GV-N760OC-2GD REV2.0 GeForce GTX 760 2GB 256-bit GDDR5 PCI Express 3.0 HDCP Ready WindForce 3X 450W Video Card. </s>
<s> As long as I can keep the price of my mobo, CPU, and graphics whether integrated or not at no more than $1000. </s>
<s> Just get the models listed and you'll have a great all round machine. </s>
<s> You could drop the ssd and boost the GPU but all your choice. </s>
<s> Also you could go without any gpu and install later. </s>

<s> I have decided to go without the gpu and see how things work. </s>
<s> Actually, I won't be doing much if any video editing until sometime next year. </s>
<s> In your previous post you mentioned the Haswell and I have been giving that very serious thought along with an Asus mobo (because it supports dual monitors) and now I am investigating a psu that will be compatible with the Haswell which as I understand it needs a psu that can work with a very low voltage when the cpu is in &quot;sleep mode&quot;. </s>
