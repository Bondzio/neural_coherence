1.1.1	Hello, I need to build a PC that will be outside 24/7.	St
1.1.2	It will need to be in a protective casing that can withstand the elements.	St
1.1.3	Can you give me some recommendations on parts that can withstand the extreme in temperatures.	St
1.1.4	I need recommendations on motherboards, CPU, harddrives, fans and cases.	St
1.1.5	I will also need to get a PCMCIA card in order to send information back to the server.	St
1.1.6	Thanks in advance.	St
1.2.1	A mobile CPU will help get the heat down.	St
1.2.2	But for the rest, we need specifics.	St
1.2.3	What kind of temperature extremes are we talking about?	St
1.2.4	How will the case be designed, will there be ventilation?	St
1.2.5	What are you using it for and where will you be mounting it?	St
1.2.6	For the most part, normal PC hardware will work, unless the extremes are pretty extreme.	St
1.2.7	Just not enough info here to go on.	St
1.3.1	Hello, the case will be a weather resistant case that has insulation as well as vents for multiple fans.	St
1.3.2	The computer is used to analyze and collect environmental data in the wild and very very rural areas.	St
1.3.3	There are no cables or DSL lines where we are talking about.	St
1.3.4	It does have power supply, but the only way to transmit this data is through cellular link.	St
1.3.5	It will be about 20 feet in the air and will gather data on the environment (ie, temp, humidity, ect for scientific purposes) through a series of sensors on the ground.	St
1.3.6	The temperature extremes will be -20 to about 120F.	St
1.3.7	Hope this helps.	St
1.4.1	Check out http://www.mini-itx.com/store/?c=3#p1153, and look for the &quot;VoomPC Vehicle PC Enclosure&quot;.	St
1.4.2	It's not water tight (you'll be hard pressed to find one that is), but it is designed to be in rough temperatures and environments.	St
1.4.3	I hope that helps!	St
1.5.1	Linux has a project that is trying to create laptops for 3rd world countries.	St
1.5.2	they are facing the same challenges as you & more http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Hardware_specification	St
1.6.1	I work in a maritime enviorment.	St
1.6.2	We use pelican cases to keep our sensitive cases free of water and the elements you might have to mod a case but they are good...but not cheap.	St
