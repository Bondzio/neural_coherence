But what do I need to do to get it working with my second computer. On my second computer I have already installed the wifi adapter and it is working as it sends packets but dosent recieve any. Do I need to install any isp software. I checked my tcp/ip setings and are ok. I dont know if I have to do anything else..

I set the other computer ip settings the same as my original computer. But this did not solve the problem because I had 2 network connections open, as soon as I disabled 1 connection I connected straight away. If I setup the internet on another computer and I double click on iexplorer how can I stop it to go into setup mode ie configure LAN, configure Dial up etc.
