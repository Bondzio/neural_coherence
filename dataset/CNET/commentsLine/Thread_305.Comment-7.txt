as bob said no need for new motherboard to add a capture or sound card.
for info on your mobo download belarc advisor  find what free pci slots are available and buy the appropriate cards.
choose a capture card that does not require a seperate audio connection, and problem solved.
my compro digital/anolouge tv tuner capture card requires no connection to the sound card.
no doubt there others.
