<s> Hello Everybody, This is my first posting here so please bear with me. </s>
<s> I have been having a problem with an HP Pavilion a1250n (AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+, 1gb ram, XP Media Center 2005). </s>
<s> I first noticed it when the modem would disconnect whenever I ran a cpu intensive program that maximized cpu usage for more than a minute, such as a long computation or even the aquarium screen saver that comes with the system. </s>
<s> The modem would disconnect from my dial-up service after 50 seconds and I would be unable to connect until the cpu intensive program ended or I killed it. </s>
<s> After many fruitless calls to HP technical support I took it upon myself to investigate the problem and found that if I moved the modem to the middle PCI slot from its default bottom PCI slot it worked fine. </s>
<s> I then tested a sound card and another modem in the bottom slot and neither worked correctly although they did in one of the other PCI slots. </s>
<s> I exchanged the machine for another of the same model and found the exact same problem. </s>
<s> I exchanged yet again and again found the same problem. </s>
<s> So it appears the bottom PCI slot is bad in all of these or a large batch of them. </s>
<s> All of the machines I had used an MSI motherboard although the HP website now lists an ASUS motherboard in the a1250n's specs. </s>
<s> Currently the third machine is at HP for repair (putting in the ASUS motherboard) and it has been there since Nov. 21. </s>
<s> Anyway, I was hoping people with this machine could test for the problem I described. </s>
<s> HP claims mine is an isolated case but my experience with three different machines indicates otherwise. </s>
<s> The test is easy to do -- set the screen saver to the aquarium screen saver and set an activation time of 1 minute. </s>
<s> Dial in to your ISP and wait. </s>
<s> If the problem is there, the modem should disconnect within about 50 seconds of the screen saver's appearance. </s>
<s> As a side note, the HP service technician and engineer working on the case have been great but the rest of HP's 'award winning' customer service has been atrocious. </s>
<s> They had me describe the problem and gave me the same solutions over and over, they told me they were going to call back and never did, they said a case manager had been assigned but one hadn't, just to name a few of the problems I've had with them. </s>
<s> I appreciate your help. </s>

<s> in the world don't you get an eMachine then?????????????? </s>
<s> Or upgrade the model??? </s>
<s> Or have them put a MSI mobo instead of an ASUS. </s>
<s> I'd really be surprised if it was a production fopah. </s>
<s> ASUS just doesn't put out stuff like that. </s>
<s> This wouldn't be the first time HP's chasis were the culprit either. </s>
<s> Either way...good luck! </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> Thanks for your response and I wanted to clarify some things. </s>
<s> All three machines that had the problem had the MSI motherboard (MS-7184, which is an OEM motherboard and not supported on MSI's website, as far as I know) and I asked that they put in an ASUS motherboard for the repair. </s>
<s> As for other options, the only other Athlon 64 X2 machine that I found from HP (model m7248n) uses the same MSI motherboard and eMachines doesn't make an Athlon 64 X2 machine. </s>
<s> I considered putting my own together, which I've done in the past, but I wanted a reliable machine from a well-known company with a good warranty and support. </s>
<s> Ironic, isn't it? </s>
<s> As for an update, I spoke with the HP engineer working on the problem and he was very understanding and helpful, in direct contrast to most of the others I've dealt with at HP. </s>
<s> He told me that he found a problem with the MSI motherboard and forwarded it to another engineering group for further investigation. </s>
<s> He said he found no problem with the ASUS motherboard but because it is a non-standard motherboard I would have difficulty getting BIOS updates from the HP website. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if this is correct because the HP website now lists an ASUS motherboard as standard in the a1250n. </s>
<s> HP has offered to buy back the computer, which would make all of the time and effort I devoted to this problem a waste of time, or fix the machine with the ASUS mobo and give me $100 or unspecified upgrades, which I feel still doesn't go far enough. </s>
<s> I'm trying to decide between getting the money, building my own machine, and cutting all ties with HP or getting the repaired machine and cash. </s>
<s> Thanks for listening, Kelly </s>
<s> Obtain a serial port connected modem. </s>
<s> WinModems can do as you describe and fixing the Winmodem issues usually cost more than the known fix. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Anytime! </s>
<s> Getting it fixed with ASUS mobo, to me, would be the way to go here. </s>
<s> Even tho HP won't/maybe won't be able to support the BIOS you could still get them from ASUS. </s>
<s> The update procedure isn't much different. </s>
<s> BTW. </s>
<s> Merry Christmas!! </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> The Winmodem issue is well known but if this is so (bad slot) then they only need to exercise their warranty. </s>
<s> My offer is a solid fix and death of a well known problem. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Remember when you could not use the slot next to the AGP slot? </s>
<s> That issue was and still is a well known PC design issue. </s>
<s> To hold HP responsible for making a PC compatible design is a very interesting stance. </s>
<s> What about all the other PC (and Windows) nuances and quirks? </s>
<s> Bottomline: If we are asking for a perfect machine, I don't think we see such yet. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The original modem, a sound card, and another modem all worked fine in the middle PCI slot (PCI2) but did not work properly in the bottom PCI slot (PCI3) when another program was using 100% of the cpu. </s>
<s> Is there a well known design issue pertaining to high cpu usage and the PCI3 slot? </s>
<s> I'm no expert but I haven't come across anything in my searches. </s>
<s> Also, the HP engineer working on the problem has told me he found a problem with the MSI motherboard but not an ASUS motherboard that is also listed for the machine. </s>
<s> I think the MSI board, MS-7184, is used in most of HP's Athlon 64 machines and by a number of other brands including eMachines (according to http://www.emachineupgraders.info ). </s>
<s> I wonder if the problem is related to the dual core Athlon 64 X2 processor? </s>
<s> Otherwise it seems it would be far more widespread than it is. </s>
<s> HP still claims mine is the only case they have even though their own engineer found a problem on his test model. </s>
<s> Obviously the easiest thing to have done was to put the modem in PCI2 and lived with an unusable PCI3 slot. </s>
<s> That would have bothered me and HP said they would repair it and get it back to me in 5-7 days so I sent it to them. </s>
<s> It is still sitting in the repair shop while they wait for an ASUS motherboard to arrive. </s>
<s> Oh well. </s>
<s> Kelly </s>
<s> The annoyance has been around for a very long time. </s>
<s> However it comes and goes with how good a driver writer you have and more. </s>
<s> You may not find solace with HP so I offered a solid fix of how we cure that. </s>
<s> Your choice to fight it, but that's your choice. </s>
<s> Winmodems are well known failure points with high CPU loads. </s>
<s> If this is news to you then welcome to the winmodem story. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I knew winmodems sometimes had problems with high cpu load but I didn't know if it was PCI slot specific. </s>
<s> Since the sound card I had also didn't work in the slot but both worked in another slot I thought it pointed to a motherboard problem. </s>
<s> I'm finding a little solace with HP. </s>
<s> They finally have the new ASUS motherboard at the repair site but I'm still trying to decide whether I want the machine back or the full refund they have offered. </s>
<s> I am still furious with the customer service/technical support side of things at HP so I may not want to have anything to do with them anymore. </s>
<s> Thank you for your interest in this issue. </s>
<s> Kelly </s>
<s> Thanks, and Merry Christmas to you as well. </s>
<s> I'll probably go the route with the new ASUS motherboard but I'm still furious at the technical support/customer service side of HP for this ordeal. </s>
<s> I did get a little of what I wanted from HP when the engineer called me and thanked me for troubleshooting this problem. </s>
<s> He also said it was now in another engineering group's hands to come up with a fix for it, so at least I know someone at HP is working on fixing it for future machines. </s>
<s> Take care, Kelly </s>
<s> The IRQs are now shared. </s>
<s> If a driver has a bug then under high load the IRQ software chain may show the bugs. </s>
<s> This is not a HP specific issue and why I offer the surefire cure. </s>
<s> However there are some that don't want to hear that PCs still have bugs to be worked out. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I suspected the shared IRQs initially but didn't have the knowledge or time to fix the problem on my own. </s>
<s> I hoped HP technical support would come up with a fix in the form of a driver or BIOS update but all they ever told me to do was reinstall the original driver, which didn't work. </s>
<s> Your suggestion of a serial attached modem is valid in that it would give me a working modem but I could have that by simply putting the modem in one of the other slots. </s>
<s> In either case, as pointed out by jackintucson, I would be left with a slot that I couldn't use for a modem, a sound card, or who knows what else. </s>
<s> It seems that if one manufacturer (ASUS) has a board that doesn't have this problem then the other manufacturer (MSI) should do what it takes to fix the problem with their board. </s>
<s> At least now someone at HP is working on this problem and hopefully a simple solution for the MSI motherboard will be found. </s>
<s> Thank you for your input, Kelly </s>
<s> Right before Xmas, I purchased a HP a1250n. </s>
<s> The evening I recieved it, I downloaded a BIOS upgrade and my computer has been 'hung-up' ever since. </s>
<s> I can't describe how terrible HP's Service has been. </s>
<s> I will return my machine on Monday and never purchase another HP product. </s>
<s> I concure that the problem is a faulty main board/BIOS. </s>
<s> This board, the #ms-7184 is NOT supported by MSI and that's about the same for HP. </s>
<s> It looks like it was made by MSI as an OEM product for HP. </s>
<s> Every post I can find on this machine, reports some kind of base-level problem. </s>
<s> It would be my recomendation, that anyone thinking about purchasing this computer, look elsewhere. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
