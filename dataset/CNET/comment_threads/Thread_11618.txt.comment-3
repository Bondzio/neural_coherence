I know this forum is hold but I had the same problem and i just noticed that there a little tray icon in the bottom of the screen that have a form of a music note Double Click on it &gt; Main Setting (first tab) &gt; Ouput Mode Section &gt; AnalogOutput Section &gt; You can choose the number of speakers.
&gt; (headphones - 4 - 6 - 7.1) Click OK It worked for me.
Seems like even if windows is telling the soundcard to have its sound in 7.1, it doesnt override the custom software of startech... (USB MultiChannel AudioDevice) And That's it.
Enjoy
