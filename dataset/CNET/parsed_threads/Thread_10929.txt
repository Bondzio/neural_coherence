<s> I just purchased a Dell laptop that came with a free 802.11G Netgear Router. </s>
<s> I currently have a Linksys 802.11b router with one wired desktop (windows 2000), 2 wireless desktops (one running xp - one 2000) and three laptops (XP). </s>
<s> My question is .. Do I need to get two netgear usb adapters to replace the linksys adapters or will they work with the new router( at the slower speed). </s>
<s> I figured I would ask before I start ripping everything apart and have no internet in the house. </s>
<s> thanks for any assistance jim </s>
<s> have the ability to discriminate between ''B'' and ''G'' adapters without setting the speed to the lowest common denominator. </s>
<s> If LAN transfers are not an issue then you can live with the mixed mode method, elsewise upgrade to all ''G''. </s>
<s> G02.11g is backwards compatible with 802.11g You are just restricted to 802.11b speeds </s>
