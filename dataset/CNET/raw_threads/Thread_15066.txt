I was wondering If i can make my external hard drive use the same drive every time I plug it in, For example drive G: or anything like that, every time I unplug it and plug it back in, it turns into I different drive, and then i have to delete all my music off of Itunes, and reinstall them, for them to play, since I have all my music on my external hard drive, Thanks in advance. ~Frost

If not, it will rediscover it each time the PC restarts. I'm suspecting this begins in the BIOS. You do need to keep keep the drive connected to the same USB port...no swapping...or it finds new hardware. You can also try assigning the drive letter yourself and see if that works. But I'd check device manager to see if the external is showing by the actual hard drive's ID which should suggest the manufacturer's name, model # and connection type.
