<s> I've been using a generic USB hub for picking up wireless internet signal from the router. </s>
<s> Everything was fine, until I restarted my computer Saturday. </s>
<s> Then, my connection was gone. </s>
<s> I click on the tray icon to connect to the &quot;default&quot; network (like D-Link, the router manufacturer, told me to), and it took awhile like it was connecting. </s>
<s> Then, the balloon &quot;you have wireless network(s) available&quot; came up again. </s>
<s> Same process. </s>
<s> I could do this all day and get the same result. </s>
<s> Today, I plugged my cable modem into my PC to see if my hub would find a new driver online or whatever it needs to do to work. </s>
<s> I still have the same problem. </s>
<s> Why did a simple restart (that I initiated because IE was going slowly) cause this, and how can I fix it? </s>
<s> FCCid=mq4wub1k5 Thanks </s>
<s> Such things can fail. </s>
<s> Did you try another one? </s>
<s> The details are much too thin in your post to tell if you have driver or parasite problems, but just for completeness and education I supply this link and assure you that these pests do muck up the Layered Service Provider (hint: find LSPFIX). </s>
