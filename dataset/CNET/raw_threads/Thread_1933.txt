What, this means to you other than trying to find out what it means, it is used as required w/o any outside(user) intervention. When it comes to processors, the best details are found at the makers support website, though it maybe techie in nature, if that's what you want then go there. Otherwise use the: http://www.whatis.com for just about anything computer or other areas. tada -----Willy
