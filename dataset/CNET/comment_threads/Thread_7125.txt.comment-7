You can't change the multiplier on an Intel.
No motherboard that supports Intel cpus gives you the option to change it because it's locked on most Intels.
I have heard of a few motherboards giving you the option *and even then you can only change it if it's one of the rare unlocked Intels* but I don't remember what they were.
