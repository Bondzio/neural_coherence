1.1.1	Over the past few days , My computer has started running sluggishly .	St
1.1.2	I had installed a few games , and then uninstalled them after the problem began , thinking they were the cause , and that they may have installed spyware or something else , but now that they 're gone ( I uninstalled them using & quot ; Add and Remove Programs & quot ; ) , the problem remains : When I run either Norton Disk Doctor , or Windows XP 's Error Checking , and the error checking gets to the & quot ; Index Status & quot ; area , I receive varying forms of the following messages : The 'Fix errors ' checkbox was not checked .	St
1.1.3	Corrective actions indicated below were not written to the disk .	St
1.1.4	Deleting index entry 00065051.MAP in index $ I30 of file 12073 .	St
1.1.5	Deleting index entry 00065052.MAP in index $ I30 of file 12073 .	St
1.1.6	Deleting index entry INDEX.MAP in index $ I30 of file 26689 .	St
1.1.7	Deleting index entry OBJECTS.MAP in index $ I30 of file 26689 .	St
1.1.8	When I elect to & quot ; Fix Errors & quot ; , and it supposedly does so upon restarting the computer ( the chkdsk /f program apparently runs when the computer restarts ) , the errors remain , althought the & quot ; index entries & quot ; , vary each time .	St
1.1.9	I am at a loss as to what to do to fix these errors -- is my hard disk failing ?	Ques
1.1.10	I would n't think so , aside from being a little sluggish at times , the computer and all programs seem to be running fine , and the HD is not making any unusual noise , as some HDs have done in the past in my experience when failing , or about to fail .	St
1.1.11	Any help would be greatly appreciated !	Polite
1.2.1	Norton antivirus ca n't protect the machines against the MSBlaster and Nachi worms .	St
1.2.2	Use http : //housecall.trendmicro.com/housecall/start_corp.asp and make sure your machine is free from these worms .	Sug
1.2.3	As to Norton 's tools , you have to ask Symantec why they do n't fix the errors , but chkdsk will correct many non-fatal file system errors .	St
1.2.4	Fix them and then watch .	St
1.2.5	If you are looking for a perfect OS , this is n't it .	St
1.2.6	I can find a nice reference about Security Descriptors always needing fixing by chksdsk and why this is so , but let 's focus on : 1 .	St
1.2.7	Get the worm/virus scan done .	St
1.2.8	2 .	St
1.2.9	Run the CHKDSK and get those errors out of the file system .	St
1.2.10	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks Bob -- I 'll give the worm scan a try .	St
1.3.2	I 've already used chkdsk quite a few times , and although I think it works initially , the problem always seems to come back , or it 's not being fixed at all by chkdsk .	St
1.3.3	I even tried re-installing XP , and uninstalling , then re-installing my firewall software ( ZoneAlarm Pro ) .	St
1.3.4	That 's what made me think of a failing hard disk .	St
1.3.5	Do you think that may be possible ?	Ques
1.3.6	Thanx , Scott	St
1.4.1	http : //www.jsiinc.com/SUBE/tip2200/rh2217.htm writes : & quot ; When you remove a file or folder that had 'custom ' permissions , the ACL is not deleted , it is cached .	St
1.4.2	Chkdsk /f removes ACLs that are no longer used. & quot ; Seems like this is & quot ; by design & quot ; and it disturbs people .	St
1.4.3	Wish you the best in understand the ways of Microsoft .	St
1.4.4	Your issue may be quite similar or you are mixing tools like Symantec which thinks one thing and CHKDSK which thinks another way .	St
1.4.5	So far , I do n't see a failing hard disk issue .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	Hi Bob , Well , I tried the online virus/worm scan , and my system came up clean .	St
1.5.2	I also ran chkdsk a few more times , and although it runs and supposedly fixes the errors ( although there 's no indication from chkdsk that the errors were indeed repaired ) , the errors remain to varying degrees -- each time I check for errors using Norton Utilities , the & quot ; Deleting index entry & quot ; line changes .	St
1.5.3	I even went so far as to install Spybot Search & Destroy , thinking it might be spyware or adware screwing things up , and that did n't work either .	St
1.5.4	& lt ; sigh & gt ; .	St
1.5.5	I guess I 'll live with it for now .	St
1.5.6	I appreciate your suggestions , though , and I would welcome any others you might have THANKS AGAIN !	Polite
1.5.7	Scott	St
1.6.1	& quot ; -each time I check for errors using Norton Utilities , the & quot ; Deleting index entry & quot ; line changes. & quot ; I 've noted that Symantec has had issues in the past and you may be covering the same grounds .	St
1.6.2	Just my advice ... Stop using the Symantec item , use CHKDSK to fix it ( again ) and see if the problem vanishes .	St
1.6.3	If it does , put in a web report to Symantec about it .	St
1.6.4	Ask for a free update when it comes out .	St
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	AAAaauuugghhh ! ! !	St
1.7.2	I just read your post and I am having the SAME proble ... Did you ever get it resolved ?	Ques
1.7.3	Please say yes and please tell me how !	Sug
1.8.1	I have just getting the same thing at start up with WinXp ... .and cant think of a good reason for it .	St
1.9.1	Did you read it ?	Ques
