...because your CPU has few links to &quot;the future&quot;.
In your case you'd need a motherboard which supports a single core CPU, which could well allow you a path to an X2 dual core, but that's not the lasting future either.
AM2 is AMD's future path, but this a completely different socket from that used by single core Athlon 64's and X2's, so you're out of luck there.
Have a look at the motherboards (www.newegg.com) which support X2's and you'll see many options and the fastest most powerful chips you could use in the future.....if they're not totally gone by then.
As far as cooling, the bottom of a case does not heat up, so it's of little importance that it's sitting on a carpet, adding anything to the feet to gain some height (twist caps from sauce bottles, lego bricks, stacks of coins, aluminium speaker spikes....whatever) to lift it up from the carpet pile is not a great engineering feat.
However, if the grime from smokers is collecting in heatsinks, you might do well to get a case filter installed (google : antec case filter), and use good CPU heatsink and fan that is easy to clean, especially as the 64's are not a hot running chip.
Good luck, GeeBee.
