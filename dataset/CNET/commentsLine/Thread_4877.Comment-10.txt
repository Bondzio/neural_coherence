i opened my second box of the second hp1905b, and yet to discover again another quality issue.
there is a large of what seems to be a dust particle stuck behind the lcd membrane and it is in the middle of the screen.
baiscally whenever there is white, you see a gray dot of dust that cannot be removed.
needless to say, the two monitors i have are returning to the store.
i will get two hp f1905b though, just to give them a last chance.
i like the clarity of the image, and it is a shame that i had qa issues 2/2.
i will keep you posted.
