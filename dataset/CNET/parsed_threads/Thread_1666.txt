<s> I'm in possession of a MacColby which i'm going to sell, but before i sell it i would like to know more about it. </s>
<s> I tried looking around the internet for any information at all but there wasn't much to find about it, so i was wondering if any one here might know anything about it. </s>
<s> http://www.mactalk.com.au/19/95134-rare-maccolby-ebay.html for example. </s>
<s> If you want to keep it but safe why not a computer museum? </s>
<s> I've seen the better ones let you put it on display but keep ownership. </s>

<s> I sold one of these on eBay a couple of years ago. </s>
<s> At that time I did an extensive search. </s>
<s> I did find a little information, but there just isn't much available. </s>
<s> If you are interested, I may be able to help with the sale. </s>
<s> Not sure how to pm on this forum, but if you reply with interest we can figure something out. </s>
<s> Is it still fully functioning? </s>
