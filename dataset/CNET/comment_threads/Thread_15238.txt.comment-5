i cant seem to find the edit post option.. i forgot to mention before that the function i used is called &quot;Check File System&quot; and that it also told me there is a large number of hidden filed and folders.. when i look at the properties for the drive it shows ~7gigs of used storage, but the photos folder is only about 1 gig, could these hidden folders account for the missing 5-6 gigs and how can i see what is in them/get rid of them?
any help is appreciated..
