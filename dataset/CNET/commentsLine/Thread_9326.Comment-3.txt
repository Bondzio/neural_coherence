i scanned all my photos, videos, music, paperwork onto external hard drives.
i only use my pc hard drive for software.
i keep 3 external hard drives attached to the pc (photos/music, videos, paperwork).
every couple of months i make complete copies of the three external hard drives, then swap the backup with the originals that now become the backups to be stored elsewhere.
a sneaky way of having a backup elsewhere for my photos is that once a year i copy all my photos onto a portable external hard drive and give it as a christmas present to a family member.
i have saved all my old internal hard drives and have used them as backups, too.
in 10 years of using internal and/or external hard drives as backups i have never had a hard drive corrupt.
