good suggestion, i'll swap the monitors around see if the problem follows with the monitor.
it's probably not heat related, since it starts happening from a cold system.
i have four 120mm case fans, and the graphic card has its own enclosed cooling fan.
cpu is water cooled and i think it could make ice cubes if asked to do so.
this is a totally new system less than 6 months old.
it has a 850 watt psu, so it's probably getting enough power.
i'll swap the monitors around, and check for new display drivers, and see what happens.
if i had a spare graphics card i would give that a try, but that darn firegl 7350 broke the bank, so far, all ati has offered, was to send me links to their trouble shooting pages.
thanks for your help
