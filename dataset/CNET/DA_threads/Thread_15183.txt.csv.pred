1.1.1	My HP PSC 2410 is on it 's last legs .	St
1.1.2	It makes grinding noises at startup .	St
1.1.3	I 've been to the HP website , chatted with the tech on-line and I refuse to send it in for servicing .	St
1.1.4	Not worth the money .	St
1.1.5	The bottom line is I 'm looking for a reliable printer .	St
1.1.6	I do n't want an HP .	St
1.1.7	I no longer need the scan or fax capability .	St
1.1.8	Color or just B & W would be fine .	St
1.1.9	Suggestions welcomed ... .	St
1.2.1	If you only need B & W output , then seriously consider a laser printer and yeah HP does good in this area .	St
1.2.2	There are other makes out there and just about all basic laser printers do fine .	St
1.2.3	If you still need color and an inkjet , then look at Canon models .	St
1.2.4	I would not recommend Epson or Lexmark as they 're expensive to operate and when an Epson pukes , it does so expensively .	St
1.2.5	HP still makes a good printer look at other simpler models , maybe one that accepts similar ink carts .	St
1.2.6	As for a true reliable printer then also look into Okidata , more expensive but real workhorses .	St
1.2.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	With printers often being cheaper than replacement ink cartridges it really makes you wonder ... .. Ive used Lexmark , Brother , Hp and Canon .	St
1.3.2	I think the canon is the most reliable .	St
