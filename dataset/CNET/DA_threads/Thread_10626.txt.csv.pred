1.1.1	hey guys, I'm just about to buy a computer system that consists of the following components and was having trouble deciding on which video card to choose.	St
1.1.2	The basic specs of the computer are: Asus A8N-SLi Motherboard AMD Dual Core 3800+ CPU 1024mb DDR-533 Memory 200 gig Western Digital Hard Drive 19&quot; Widescreen LCD Monitor 16x Liteon Dual Layer DVD-RW I was originally going to go for the nVidia GeForce 6600GT 256mb PCI-Express Graphics Card.	St
1.1.3	However I can upgrade to the GeForce 6800 XT 256mb PCI-Express video card very cheaply.	St
1.1.4	I was just wondering whether it was worth going to the 6800XT and whether it is a good card?	St
1.1.5	Or am I better off sticking with the good old 6600GT?	St
1.1.6	I may also be able to stretch my budget to afford the GeForce 6800GS 256mb PCI-Express Card, but would laying out the extra money for the 6800GS be worth it considering I am on a budget, or am i better off going the budget route and sticking with the 6600GT?	St
1.1.7	I am doing a computing and multimedia degree at university (college) so I will mainly be using the computer for internet, typing documents, browsing the web, burning CD''s/DVD's, Java programming etc.	St
1.1.8	I do play games occasionally but not all the time.	St
1.1.9	Any help is much appreciated as I am leaning towards the 6600GT but was wondering if there was a better option.	St
1.1.10	Cheers Benny	St
1.2.1	as it is better to stay in budget, you might want to buy an overclocked version for a speed boost.	St
1.2.2	And then maybe later on throw in another one.	St
1.2.3	I wouldn't choose the XT because the GS can be had for a little more, and the clocks are different.	St
1.2.4	If you can save up the cash, go for the GS, if not the GT is fine.	St
1.2.5	~Ibrahim~ P.S.	St
1.2.6	Remember: You can always OC the cards, unlock pipelines, and even throw in another.	St
1.3.1	Take a look at the X1600pro and XT cards.	St
1.3.2	Very appealing and comparable to Nvidia 6600GT and 6800XT.	St
1.3.3	Good price too.	St
1.4.1	6800gs good to lay out money but no greater than $175	St
1.5.1	hello, well I think I have finally decided on what combination I am going to go with.	St
1.5.2	I have decided to just go with the GeForce 6600GT 256mb graphics card.	St
1.5.3	I had a look at the Asus motherboard that is the next model down from mine the A8N-E, which costs AUD$167.	St
1.5.4	THis has no firewire and if I was to buy an add in card which would probably cost AUD$30, this would put it above the price of the Asus A8N-SLi (AUD$189) which has firewire onboard.	St
1.5.5	However people keep on telling me SLi is not worth having so the DFi Lanparty UT Ultra D is only AUD$222 which is only an extra $33 on top of the A8N-SLi.	St
1.5.6	I have heard good things about the Lanparty series of boards so I think the base specs of my pc will be: DFi Lanparty UT Ultra D AMD Dual Core 3800+ CPU 1024mb DDR-533 Memory 200 gig Western Digital Hard Drive 19'' Widescreen LCD Monitor 16x Liteon Dual Layer DVD-RW GeForce 6600GT 256mb What do you guys reckon of this, Cheers Benny	St
1.6.1	not unless u have an am2 mobo and processor?	St
