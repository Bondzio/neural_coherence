backup is all about strategy and discipline.
bad strategy: storing files/data on hard drives, either internal or external is not a good backup strategy.
it is only a storage strategy.
why?
hard drives fail too easily (hardware and software causes).
one particular strategy: burn data to cd/dvd for backup.
make at least 3 copies.
store one that is easily accessible for on site recovery.
store another in a fireproof cabinet.
store the third off site.
(cd/dvd media is incredibly inexpensive--pennies per disc if purchased the right way.)
discipline: make all 3 copies regularly.
do not neglect any one!!!
software optoins: backup particular files/folders manually or automate it with something like acronis true image or a batch file.
backup complete images of hard drives with acronis true image or norton ghost.
