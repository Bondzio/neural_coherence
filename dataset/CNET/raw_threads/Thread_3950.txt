Here is my situation, I receive my internet connection from the local ISP using LAN without any cable modems. The LAN pin is plugged into one of the 2 D-Link Ethernet 10/100 cards in my Desktop PC. The local ISP along with the internet connection provides a Windows Login Client Application. Unless I do not login into that client (which works only on my desktop) the internet will not work. In such a scenario where I just HAVE TO login to the desktop PC, how can I set up home wifi? To get a better picture I have made a mockup of the scenario which can be found at http://hiren.kayako.org/scenario.gif Here are mt details: Desktop PC: Windows SP2 with 2 D-Link Ethernet 10/100 Adapter Cards of which 1 is currently being used to access internet Laptop: Windows SP2 with D-Link DWL-650 802.11b Wireless Card Router: D-link AirPlus G 802.11g and 4-P Lan Wireless Router Any help provided shall be highly appreciated.

Unless...... you set the router to act as a router and not a gateway (same function as a WAP). Should be in the manual. ICS would appear to still be needed on the Internet connected PC.

The manual provided with the router does not cover the option to setup a router as a router and not as a gateway. The manual infact points me to set up the router by opening IE as http://192.168.0.1 Can you please help me as to how do I setup as router as a router and not as a gateway on Win XP? ICS is enabled on the Desktop PC. I am not a networking guy so I am not sure how it completely works. Thank You again for your help so far. Regards, Hiren Mehta

The initial part of the manual suggest, I have to configure the router by running the URL http://192.168.0.1 in the browser. Which does not seem to be working. Without being able to access the config panel how can I setup DHCP? This is what I did, please point me out if I did anything wrong: - Internet Ethernet Cable is plugged into a 10/100 Ethernet Adapter card on the desktop PC: Internet Protocal for this card are: IP: 172.16.100.7 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 Gateway: 172.16.100.1 Preferred DNS: 202.63.164.17 - ICS is enabled from this adapter. - I plugged a ethernet cable from the 2nd 10/100 Ethernet Adapter card from the PC to the routers WAN port. - The Intenet Protocal for this (2nd) card are: IP: 192.168.0.1 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 Gateway: blank Preferred DNS: 202.63.164.17 I hope this information is enough for my issue to be resolved. I sincerely appreciate your help so far, thanks again! Regards, Hiren Mehta

This explains why you cannot reach the routers setup page. Take this cable out of the WAN port and put it in one of the LAN ports. Then cycle the power of the router and reboot the PC. See what IP you now get on the 2nd NIC. It should be 192.168.0.100 or so. If this is the IP, you can now enter the routers setup page by typing 192.168.0.1.

I have managed to get the access point up as you suggested and LAN works like a charm. The problem now is with the internet connection. As soon as I plug in the router, the internet connection on the desktop PC stops working (the main line). As soon as I disable the second ethernet 10/100 connection (which is connected) to the laptop, the internet connection starts working again: My internet connection 10/100 Adapter IP settings are: IP Address: 172.16.100.7 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 Gateway: 172.16.100.1 Preferred DNS: 202.63.164.17 One more thing, when I enable WEP security for Wireless connection, my laptop fails to connect to the browser. On requesting a connection to the router, it does ask for the network key. When I insert and try to connect to the router, it does not connect. Last 2 issues and I should be good to go. Thank You again for your help so far. Regards, Hiren Mehta

Now I have a new computer - AMD Athlon 2400+ with Windows XP Media Edition installed on it. When I now try connecting from AMD to the D-Link Wireless Router (I used the same PC Network Adapter from the old pc), Win XP Media Edition crashes as soon as plug Network cable into the Router. Router is using the latest firmware. What can be the reason? I am totally confused. Regards, Hiren Mehta
