hi all, i have been trying to get wallwatcher to work.
i have one of the supported routers, airlink101 ar525w, and i have logging enabled and i put in the static ip of my computer.
i then fire up wallwatcher and pick my router from its list and make sure my routers ip is correct.
anyway it just keeps saying &quot;starting&quot; but never actually connects or displays any info.
does anyone have any other software solutions or recommendations for me?
