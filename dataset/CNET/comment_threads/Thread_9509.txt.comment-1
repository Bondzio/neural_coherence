I have a non-branded PC that my brother-in-law put together for himself and the passed it over to me.
It has a AMD x52 chip and runs on XP Pro.
I have a constant problem of where it boot's up everyday mysteriously.
I always shut it down completely in the evening.
Without fail in the morning it is running.
I have the Mcafee virus and spyware scan but doesn't seem to pick up anything.
If I shut the main switch behind, then it does not start up on it's own.
Any ideas?
