1.1.1	Hi, I want to buy a external hard drive, but I have 1 question I am buying the external hard drive for the gameplay video's I make.	St
1.1.2	I use a notebook, and a notebook doesn't have a big hard drive.	St
1.1.3	So i want to save the movies directly on my external hard drive.	St
1.1.4	For a fast transfer I will buy a external hard drive with USB 3.0 Now i want to know if more RPM makes a faster transfer from PC to external hard drive?	St
1.1.5	Makes 7200 RPM a faster transfer then 5400 RPM?	St
1.1.6	Greetings, Noobie ^^	St
1.2.1	I don't think that matters much, if at all, even with USB 3.	St
1.2.2	May I give you a warning?	St
1.2.3	Experience has proven that external hard disks are quite unreliable and error prone.	St
1.2.4	Too many members here thought they could be used as storage, forgot about a backup (a copy on one or two other media) and lost everything.	St
1.2.5	So better buy 2 disks and copy to both.	St
1.2.6	Three would be even better, especially if you keep the third one on a safe place outside of your home or office (or where-ever those 3 other disks are).	St
1.2.7	Kees	St
1.3.1	While there would be some improvement, it's not going to rock your world sorta thing.	St
1.3.2	You'll be better off using a desktop and having an int.	St
1.3.3	HD that accessing a 10,000RPM HD.	St
1.3.4	That would be better but again, that's a hard major investment.	St
1.3.5	Under your circumstances, you might be better served having a NAS setup, not only for work but immediate storage and minor back-up.	St
1.3.6	You may want to look into SSD setups as well, speed here is greater overall but that's only an idea I'll throw out there.	St
1.3.7	Back-up should be an important consideration on top of any initial movie storage.	St
1.3.8	tada -----Willy	St
1.4.1	I am thinking you are right Kees, using USB3 on a notebook, the notebook would have to be USB3 compliant, speed increase negligible.	St
1.4.2	IF however a firewire or ESATA drive were used, there should be an increase in transfer rate, but the notebook would have to have the hook ups.	St
