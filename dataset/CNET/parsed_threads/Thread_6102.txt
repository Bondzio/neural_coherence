<s> I have built quite afew systems but my latest has me baffled. </s>
<s> Gigabyte AM2+ 770 UD3 Athlon x2 2gbs 800mhz DDR2 Maxtor 160 ATA drive Optiarc/Sony DVDRW All hardware present in BIOS and seems normal except... ...after build powered up went into BIOS changed BOOT order to CD 1st then HDD, inserted Win 7 disc, restarted and OS began to load. </s>
<s> Got to expanding files screen and got the message &quot;Some files are missing Windows cannot continue&quot; or words to that affect. </s>
<s> Have used this DVD before with no problem. </s>
<s> Tried again to install. </s>
<s> Got the BOOTMGR is missing. </s>
<s> Strange I thought, I am booting off the disc. </s>
<s> Tried several restarts and got same message. </s>
<s> Tried Vista Ultimate disc. </s>
<s> Same error. </s>
<s> Desperation turned me to XP disc...same error BOOTMGR is missing. </s>
<s> How is this posible? </s>
<s> I could understand having this error after changing or swapping out drives but this is a clean install on a new HDD and how can all the OS discs have BOOTMGR missing? </s>
<s> I don't have a floppy installed or a USB device with enough capacity to boot from but I am guessing that even if I did the same error would come up. </s>
<s> Into my 2nd hour now of trying different BIOS settings, Fail Safe etc. </s>
<s> still same problem. </s>
<s> What went wrong? </s>
<s> How can I get my new machine to bot of a DVD and install? </s>
<s> Realy frustrated...please help! </s>
<s> Get Ultimate Boot CD from here: http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/ If you can't boot from that, I would suspect the Sony DVD drive has a problem. </s>
<s> You do not mention whether it is new or not but try it in another computer to see if it will allow a boot up in the other computer, if you can get that far. </s>
