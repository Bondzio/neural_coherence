11999	0	399256	3329079	NR	Seredipity	6/27/10 6:27 AM	1.27762002E12	strange computer on network	Good morning, Hope someone can help me this morning...i have been recovering medically for the last 2 months and not on my home network &lt;xbox has been a godsend&gt; Anyways, my niece has been living at the house helping around and i gave her permission to use my home network. This morning, I get online only to find my encryption is down on my wireless network and i see a few new computers on the network...right now i am seeing nothing but red on this whole subject. I've installed network view and have their ipaddresses but cannot get into them. other than throwing up my encyption and firewalls and everyother bloody thing i can imagine, is there anything i can do to either put the fear of me into my niece on their computer &lt;she has a friend over&gt; or any other idea. Am petrified to find out what else i might have on my computer/network - at least my virus protection is up to date and running. Will be running thta in 10 seconds. Any one else have any other things i should be on the look out for or scanning for? - have avg and avira for the virus protection. will probably need to get a million other d/l for bugs and stuff.. and i don't even wannna think about p2p &lt;her older sister put limewire and AIM onto one of my crappy computers 3 years ago and i still find weird links in it since i didn't format the harddrive&gt; Sigh. Am frankly just livid right now and not living up to my name...no so Serenity

WEP is cracked in about 120 seconds or less so for WIFI we move to WPA. Try that. Since there are unknown machines on YOUR wifi, change to WPA now and the unauthorized machines will be tossed out.
