your links are to the same monitor, but generally an &quot;HD&quot; LCD monitor can properly display a 720p HDTV signal.
if you ever plan to hook your monitor up to a cable box or dvd player, then get the HD monitor.
if it's only going to hooked up to your PC, then HD support shouldn't influence your purchase decision.
