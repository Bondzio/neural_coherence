install and run the intel processor id utility,it will tell you if you what flavor celeron you have.
your motherboard will run the 800 mhz but you need to see if it will support prescott (celeron d is a prescott) and if it will handle hyperthreading technology.
you also want to make sure that your psu has enough juice to run the p4 prescott as it takes nearly 100w whereas the celeron eats only ~75w.
hope this is some help.
