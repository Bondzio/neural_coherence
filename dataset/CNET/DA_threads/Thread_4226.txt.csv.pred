1.4.1	& quot ; my computer still freezes if the LaCIE is on at restart & quot ; If this was my machine , I 'd search for the maker of the motherboard 's web site and install their latest MOTHERBOARD DRIVER PACKAGE .	St
1.4.2	Windows XP does not know or supply drivers for AMD based motherboards .	St
1.4.3	They have a basic package , but not something I would use too long .	St
1.4.4	At http : //www.asus.com.tw/support/download/item.aspx ? ModelName=A7V600-X I see USB 2.0 drivers and the motherboard driver packages .	St
