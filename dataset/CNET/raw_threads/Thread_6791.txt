Although that is not an Intel motherboard, here is what Intel says about it: http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/cs-011965.htm If you have a 256MB module in each of the slots that makes up channel A, you would then need to install a 512MB module in channel B to match the total in Channel A (if adding just one module). Of course, as shown in the above Intel.com link, dual channel mode may be achieved with other configurations. Dual channel module purchase preferences: 1. Purchase matched pairs tested to work together. 2. Purchase exact same model numbers. 3. Purchase exact same density, frequency, and timings.

I will not explain further why this is so. There may be some that wish such a mismatched pair would work but that's all in the computer's design and not subject to our wishes. http://www.google.com/search?q=m2npv confirms you need pairs. Get the second 8HTF6464AY-53ED7 from Crucial and you're done. Bob
