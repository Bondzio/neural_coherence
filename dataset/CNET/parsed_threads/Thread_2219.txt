<s> Hi i'm planning to build a new gaming/work desktop and I have my mind set on having 8 Gigs of ram on it. </s>
<s> Now I know that 32-bit OS's will not recognize more than 4 Gigs, so I will install Vista 64-bit. </s>
<s> My mobo and Processor will be: EVGA 122-CK-NF68-T1 and Intel Core 2 extreme QX6800. </s>
<s> Note that I've done extensive research on the mobo and could not find anything relevant to this issue. </s>
<s> The mobo's spec does not mention it supporting (or not supporting) a 64-bit architecture or Intel's EM64T technology. </s>
<s> Does this mean that I cannot have 8 gigs of RAM on this Mobo even with Vista 64-bit ? </s>
<s> So my question is: WHAT ARE ALL THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR A 64-BIT SYSTEM THAT HAS 8 GIGS OF RAM ? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance </s>
<s> So you get your 64-bit OS and all is good. </s>
<s> Now where is your 64-bit game? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> and all core2 processors are 64bit so you're all set. </s>
<s> newer games can run on vista/64 with a bit of coaxing. </s>
<s> older games are more problematic and some won't run/install at all. </s>
<s> games certified as &quot;games for windows&quot; are designed to run on both 64bit and 32bit windows. </s>
<s> here are some gaming benchmarks on vista ultimate 64bit. </s>

<s> Well, I would just settle for the &quot;meager&quot; 4GB of RAM and then upgrade in a few years when I actually need it. </s>
<s> But that's just me. </s>
