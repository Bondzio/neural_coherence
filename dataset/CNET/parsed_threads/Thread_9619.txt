<s> hi, my laptop is Toshiba Satellite basic model M55 S135, I want to watch video in my laptop on the tv screen, I am not sure what is wrong, but when I connected the S-video Cable to the TV and my laptop, the TV screen only shows blank Dark with absolutely no sound or image, although I can watch video on my laptop with no problem, but I want it connect to TV and watch in a big screen , can anyone tell me what the peoblem is? </s>
<s> do I need to purchase a external device such as graphic card or video card or something to make it work??? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> All computers need a graphic card to work. </s>
<s> Your laptop, of course, has one. </s>
<s> Now you say your S-Video cable doesn't work. </s>
<s> Here is the thing. </s>
<s> S-Video is not good for Computer-to-TV. </s>
<s> Tell me, what is the make/model of your TV? </s>
<s> Better yet, what inputs (holes) does it have on the back. </s>
<s> Does it have a Blue monitor plug? </s>
<s> Or DVI? </s>
<s> HDMI? </s>
<s> Component? </s>
<s> A work-around: This may or may not work. </s>
<s> Right-click your desktop, click properties. </s>
<s> Click the Settings tab. </s>
<s> Look at the slide bar on the right hand side. </s>
<s> Drag it all the way to the left. </s>
<s> Then plug the cable in again. </s>
<s> S-Video is primarily used for TV to DVD player or TV to VCR. </s>
<s> S-Video cannot display the amount of pixels that your monitor has. </s>
<s> Your laptop is doing good, you just may need a cable or two to connect it to your TV. </s>

<s> I have a Toshiba Satellite also. </s>
<s> Any type of copy-protected content (such as a commercial DVD) will only display on your laptop's screen. </s>
<s> If it displayed it on your TV, then it could be recorded. </s>
<s> (I know, it's a pain in the butt. </s>
<s> When I travel I'd much rather carry a few DVDs and watch them on the hotel's TV rather than pay $6 for a movie.) </s>
<s> There are some hacks for WinDVD that will turn off this feature. </s>
<s> You could also rip the DVD to disk and remove the copy protection. </s>
<s> But I don't think we discuss stuff like that in this forum. </s>
<s> (google) </s>
<s> I always thought if you'd mirror it as a copy in the settings it'd have to be a copy of it. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info! </s>
