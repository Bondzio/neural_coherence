any transmitting antenna can provide gain on a transmitted signal over a standard groundplane antenna.
gain antennas such as a yagi beam most certainly will offer the advantage of increasing the strength of a transmission.
this is the reason why tv and radio stations use a variety of antennas to increase the effective radiaion power of their stations.
it's not a thermodynamic principle it's a basic principle of radio transmissions.
if you study radio theory, i think you'll find that what i'm saying is true.
