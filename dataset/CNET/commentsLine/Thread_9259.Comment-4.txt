the existing microphone has to go to some type of mixer or mixer/amp, and then out of the amp to the speakers in the room.
you could place a mixer with more than one output before the amp.
use one output for the speakers in the room, and use the other to connect to the audio input (line-in) in the laptop.
if your laptop doesn't have one, you can get an external usb box or a pc-card model.
i don't know how your odd and old hardware will behave with these devices, though.
usb box:  creative makes a pc-card model:  look at the ''typical sound system'' diagram on p.8 of this link:  (shure makes great microphones) you could have a parallel sound system.
you could just tape a cheap usb mic to your existing mic and run the line to your laptop that will record right behind the podium.
looking for something more elegant like wireless, huh?
i don't know of any wireless usb microphones (other than telephone headsets), but there are good wireless microphones that will transmit to a receiver.
you, then, could run a line out of the wireless receiver to your a mic port on your computer's external audio box.
or make it easy: 1. visit a local electronics store that caters to musicians or a musical instrument showroom.
ask how they would do it.
2. visit radioshack and ask them what they would do.
