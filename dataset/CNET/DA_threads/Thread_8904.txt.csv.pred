1.1.1	I have an industrial application ( measurement instrument ) which has a SCSI-2 connector ( HD-50 male ) which is used to connect to an external SCSI drive .	St
1.1.2	Since the external SCSI drive we used is no longer available , I need to find either : ( a ) An external drive that has a SCSI-2 interface ( or one which I can adapt to ) , or ( b ) A SCSI-2 to USB converter to allow the use of a USB drive or stick .	St
1.1.3	For ( a ) , I have not been able to find anything other than SCSI drives which have VHDCI connectors , which I 'm told can not be adapted to a 50-pin SCSI-2 interface .	St
1.1.4	Is this correct ?	Ques
1.1.5	For ( b ) , all I can find are adapters which treat SCSI as the peripheral , not the host ( i.e .	St
1.1.6	the host is our instrument with the SCSI interface , and the peripheral would be a USB device ) .	St
1.1.7	Any suggestions for either solution ?	Ques
1.1.8	No , we can not re-design our product to use a different bus architecture ( too costly , and the product is going EOL shortly ) .	St
1.1.9	Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated !	Polite
1.2.1	I still have some scsi drives in the closet and see numerous scsi drives on ebay .	St
1.2.2	Some companies insist on new parts but as such fall out of production you have to get the used parts .	Sug
1.2.3	You are right about the lack of new hardware or adapter .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	as profitt said , ebay is the best place to get legacy equipment .	St
1.3.2	i think have a couple of scsi-2 drives , a 4gb and something else that are in working order .	St
1.3.3	pay for shipping and i 'll give them to you ... my wife is pleased when i reduce my inventory	St
1.4.1	Thanks guys , if it were for my personal use I 'd take your offers , but this is for a customer who would expect a brand new product , not used .	St
1.4.2	I did find an internal SCSI drive from Adtron which uses Compact Flash media ( http : //www.adtron.com/products/Sdds.html ) , but I need an external drive .	St
1.4.3	I looked for a drive enclosure for SCSI , but all are either IDE , USB or SATA .	St
1.4.4	The SCSI drive enclosures I saw were not the right form factor ... bummer .	St
1.5.1	No more emails , hitting their websites , etc .	St
1.5.2	Most have some reserve for situations like this .	St
1.5.3	They may have refurbs too .	St
1.5.4	I know we had to do this for SUN machines .	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
1.6.1	I know the scsi train pretty well .	St
1.6.2	Try this .	St
1.6.3	http : //www.bitmicro.com/products_edisk_25_scsin.php ( solid state drives ) http : //www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp ? EdpNo=1418305 & CatId=135 Your average 80 pin scsi drive .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	adaptec just discontinued their scsi/usb adapter .	St
1.7.2	if adaptec ( whose name is synonomous with scsi ) is dropping these type of products , it means that external scsi is about dead .	St
1.7.3	http : //www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx ? article=33354	Ques
1.8.1	I forgot to mention that to replace that 25 pin boxed SCSI drive you 'll likely have to piecemeal a solution from a few makers .	St
1.8.2	I 'd look to GRANITE for their adapters from 50 or 68 pin SCSI drives I see for sale all over ( Newegg.com has those drives ) to the 25 pin outlet .	St
1.8.3	You 'll either find a new drive housing or modify one to get over your last run .	St
1.8.4	You can finish this but I doubt you will find NIB ready to use 25 pin SCSI drive in a box like we did 10 years ago .	St
1.8.5	This is going to be not so much fun but is par for the course as old technology exits .	St
