alrighty, parts are starting to arrive so the build process has begun.
i'm still awaiting the mobo, ram, and antec psu so while i'm waiting i've installed the dvd and floppy drives.
the case has a nice feature on the cd/dvd drives where you have a faceplate that will open with the drive door so there's no problem with color coding.
at least with the plextor model i cant use that due to the size of the drive.
the one for the floppy works just fine.
it was a hassle trying to get the back side of the case off, but i got it off and now the back plate for the mobo is off and ready to receive the board when it arrives.
already i've found that the inside of a case is very sharp.
lol... i've alredy given myself a v shaped gash on my index finger that's about 1/16-1/8 deep and about 3/8&quot; long.
lol... i've also found out that the drives go in a heck of a lot easier from the front than from the back.
ok call it a no-duh statement but i had no clue... also i've added a fan controller too so i've got it in but not completely hooked up.
the case looks great and i cant wait to get the blue cathode tubes in there that came with the fan controller.
shoudl be cool.
i've got 2 case fans plus one for the hd which is also en-route.
if i need more i'll know where to get them.
let's see cant think of anything else thats new so that's it for now... oh but i will note how surprised i was at the difference between sata and ide cables.
holy cow is there a difference.
with the exception of the floppy drive, and maybe old old cdrom drive i'm all sata.
hd and dvd are sata.
sata cables are going to be so much easier to work with.
i also like the room to work inside the case too.
i dont feel cramped in there.
cool... more to come later...
