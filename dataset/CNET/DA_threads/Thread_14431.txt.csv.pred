1.1.1	I just bought a CD RW external drive to back up my files .	St
1.1.2	It also comes with an audio cable to plug into my computer ( a left-right plug for the external drive 's output that converges to a single jack for inputting into the PC 's sound card ) .	St
1.1.3	My dumb question is which of the 3 slots on the sound card does the single plug go into ?	Ques
1.1.4	There is a speaker plug , a mic plug and a line out plug .	St
1.1.5	I doubt it goes into the Mic plug but I can see either of the others being appropriate .	St
1.1.6	This is not a big deal as my pc has a read-only drive that works just fine and I do n't currently need to use the external drive for playing anything , but I 'd still like to know ( and the direction book fails to tell me ) .	St
1.2.1	Seems odd .	St
1.2.2	Normally sound cards on Desktops will have a Mic in , Line in and Line out .	St
1.2.3	It may also have a Speaker out in addition .	St
1.2.4	Laptops may not have a Line IN .	St
1.2.5	In your case , it must be LINE IN and not LINE OUT .	St
1.2.6	Please confirm .	St
1.2.7	The CDRW audio cable goes in to the Line IN socket .	St
1.2.8	Please post a feedback .	Sug
1.3.1	Yes this for audio playback .	St
1.3.2	If you have a newer PC the line input is the blue one .	St
1.3.3	If you have an older PC you will have to look at the book that came with the PC .	St
