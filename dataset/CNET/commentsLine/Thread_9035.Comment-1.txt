system: dual monitors (before, 2 crt, now 1 lcd, 1 crt) windows xp before i took my pc to shop, system monitors were going to sleep 10 minutes after boot up.
at shop, both screens working without going to sleep.
when i brought back home, unpacked new lcd monitor, cabled both monitors to machine, booted up, both went to sleep at first within a few minutes, now they're both going to sleep at boot up.
graphics card was replaced, so this is not the problem.
please help, this is my business and i am losing money.
