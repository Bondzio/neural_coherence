why not try a mac for mom?
if all she's doing is e-mail, web surf, etc, why not a macbook, macbook air, or macbook pro?
there is also the new 21.5&quot; imac that came out the other day.
they certainly have much more ease of use and are great looking and long lasting.
in my experience i've given hp and dell 1 or 2 star rating, mainly because they quit too soon.
i switched to mac and have never regretted it.
you say mom may have a hard time transitioning from win xp to 7?
i did, and i'm a computer wizz, win 7 just didn't click for me.
switching to mac os would be just as easy if not easier for her i think.
just show her how to open the browser, hit the web, and it's all the same from there.
the way it's laid out is very easy to understand.
