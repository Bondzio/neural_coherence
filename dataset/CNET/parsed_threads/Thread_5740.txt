<s> I'm sure that this has already been covered, but I am curious whether or not i should purchase a DVI video card for my PC. </s>
<s> I have an LCD monitor with a DVI input, but my PC does not have the DVI output. </s>
<s> I dont play games on my computer, but I do watch videos and DVD's. </s>
<s> Is it worth it for me to purchase a video card and if so, can anyone recommend the DVI card to buy. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I am assuming you are currently using the 15-pin Blue D-Sub for your monitor. </s>
<s> I have used both DVI and D-Sub and have seen NO differences. </s>
<s> I actually like D-Sub better because you can make adjustments, like contrast, move the &quot;picture&quot; around. </s>
<s> DVI is set at whatever. </s>
<s> My call: No need to buy a new card. </s>

<s> With A DVI video card the picture will be much clearer. </s>
<s> Much higher definition. </s>
<s> As for wich card to buy; Do you have an AGP or PCI express? </s>
<s> What's your budget? </s>
