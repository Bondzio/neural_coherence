<s> I am adding a second hard drive to keep some records on. </s>
<s> The one I am adding has xp pro on it already and I want to wipe it clean. </s>
<s> My main hd that I am using now also has xp pro on it. </s>
<s> Here is the problem I am having. </s>
<s> I connected my main drive to the end of the cable and my slave drive to the middle part. </s>
<s> When I boot up it ask which operating system I want to use and then begins to load the slave drive. </s>
<s> I want it to load my main drive so I can get into the slave to reformat it. </s>
<s> I have my jumpers set correct as for as I can tell. </s>
<s> Any ideas what I am doing wrong? </s>
<s> Connect the drive you want to erase only. </s>
<s> Boot from a floppy or CD with a utility to wipe it clean of all data and partitions. </s>
<s> Personally, I prefer the drive manufacturer's utility that does so as part of a destructive testing procedure. </s>
<s> These also test the drive hardware and the integrity of the media. </s>
<s> Every manufacturer has their own name. </s>
<s> Seagate's is &quot;Seatools&quot;. </s>
<s> WD, Hitachi and others offer such. </s>
<s> Steve's suggestion ... connect only the drive you want to wipe or clear. </s>
<s> That eliminates the risk of inadvertently wiping the wrong drive and once it's wiped, it won't have an OS to boot from. </s>
<s> If you have an old IDE 40 wire cable vs. an 80 wire cable, the Master or bootable drive is usually placed on the middle connector. </s>

<s> I got it going. </s>
<s> In my bios it was booting from hd1 instead of hd0. </s>
<s> Once I figured that out all went perfectly. </s>
<s> I did try using the utility that came with the hd but for some reason my A drive only reads some of the disk but not all. </s>
<s> It would not read this one. </s>
<s> It says the disk needed to be reformatted. </s>
<s> I have bunches of floppies with pictures on them but when I went from 98 to xp I have not been able to view them. </s>
<s> I even changed the A dive thinking it was bad but I get the same thing. </s>
<s> But that is another story. </s>
<s> I did get it wiped clean and reformatted. </s>
<s> I have been moving my stuff to it already and all seems to be working well. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> back up what you don't want (or can't afford) to lose. </s>
