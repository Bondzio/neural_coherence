<s> i have a lite on cdrw 52x24x52. </s>
<s> when i burn cdr i can only burn at 32x and cdrw i can only burn at 8x. </s>
<s> why is this happing? </s>
<s> my system specs are: 1800 amdxp processer 256 mb ram 80gig hd </s>
<s> Just because you have a x-rated burn factor, doesn't mean it will achieve that at every burn. </s>
<s> Depending on the media being burnt can be a limiting factor, even if the disk being burnt is rated for such use, varying brands can make a big difference so shop around for the best suited from actual experience. </s>
<s> On top of that as the burner gets older it will deteriate from its top levels. </s>
<s> Add to that the system overall performance as well for copying from source. </s>
<s> Next, a cleaning now and then may help in overall lasting performance. </s>
<s> Also, the burner may need an update from the manufacturer as the OS or pgms. </s>
<s> involved could be hitting a wall, thus check for your model if one is available. </s>
<s> If you haven't already check the setting for the burning s/w and see what the defaults are, but expect some falling back if the burning process encounters a problem as its &quot;burn-proof&quot; scheme may allow *best* operation so you don't create coasters. </s>
<s> Check this website for possible clues as well: http://www.cdrfaq.org/ There maybe others better to answer your question, but alot of this comes from my experience and just covers the basics. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> 32 x burning is actually too fast to be burning most items that may require low error rates. </s>
<s> It has been written in a number of columns that the maximum you should be burning at is 24-32x as beyond that will cause increased errors as well you should be burning in disc at once for music. </s>
<s> Now the other thing that will affect your burning rates are the software you are using if your using a demo version of say nero or roxio they will after the trial limit the burning speed that can be attained. </s>
<s> If youa re using an older version of burning software you may need to upgrade the software. </s>
<s> One other thing to make sure of is that the discs that you purchase are capable of handling and recommended for the speed of your burner. </s>
<s> I personally burn nothing over 24-32x depending on what I am burning and if I am really mission critical I will burn at 4x for some things. </s>
<s> I can wait the extra minute it may take, If it means one less coffee coaster. </s>
<s> Always remember fast is not always good. </s>
<s> Ron </s>
<s> Take Ron's advice and slow that burner down a little. </s>
<s> If you're burning at 32x with 256 mb ram, you should be getting buffer underruns. </s>
<s> You can burn a full cd in about 4 minutes at 24x, how fast is fast? </s>
<s> Why do you think the manufacturers stopped with the 52x burners? </s>
<s> It's because most computers aren't capable of running the drive that fast anyway. </s>
<s> The technology is ahead of it's time. </s>
<s> You also should be seeing the led on the front of the burner going out from time to time during a burn. </s>
<s> That's so the computer can catch up to the burner, because the burner is running too fast. </s>
<s> So unless you just happen to need more coasters, slow it down to 24x or even 12x or 16x. </s>
<s> Some discount, bulk media is labeled... &quot;52X Compatible.&quot; It didn't write the media was 52X capable, just that it would work in a 52X drive... As to the CDRW speed, I think I see most CDRW media is still 4X and if you look around you find some 8, 10 and 12X CDRW disks. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thanks eveyone for your help. </s>
<s> it seems the media i was using is rated at 4X i didnt think the media mattered and it was the burner that determend the speed. </s>
