For me I'd do my research on google.com To let you know how my install played out, I had to edit the BIOS (not trivial) and find drivers from another laptop model by the same maker. While it worked out, there was NO INCREASE IN RANGE. But I did get 802.11g capability. The old card was 802.11b only. I don't think such changes are for just anyone. For example, if they complain they are not getting helped, then they should go try a PC-Card. Bob
