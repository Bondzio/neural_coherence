sometimes the installed card is enough.but,sometimes you need more.what you need to know,does the new computer have any empty expansion slots.
if so, then you can add a new graphics card later,when your money lets you.but shop around before buying.
i've found,if you look around,you can get some really good deals.geeks,tiger direct,are just a few places you can look for good and sometimes cheap cards.
