does anyone have this monitor?
i just got it last week.
the user manual (and i use that term very lightly!)
says that it adjusts from -5 to +15.
i can't for the life of me figure out how to do it.
it doesn't tell you, just to be careful not to hurt your fingers.
i emailed acer support three days ago and didn't get an answer.
it is hard to find contact info for their support--not a good sign.
can anyone help?
thanks!
