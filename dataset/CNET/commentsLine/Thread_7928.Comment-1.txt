i have tried to get into my computer, however when i switch it on, the microsoft windows xp professional comes up and i press enter, but, an error screen flashes on and then it goes back to the microsoft windows xp professional menu again.
so, i created another partition on my computer with the basics and it works fine.
trying to access my disk drive and it comes up &quot;access is denied&quot;tried to restoring, but, that failed.
any suggestions, thanks?
