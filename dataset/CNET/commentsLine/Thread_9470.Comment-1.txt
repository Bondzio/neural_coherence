hello, everybody i bought a used d-link di-514 wireless router on ebay a couple days ago.
here's the problem.
when i plug the power supply in the light indicator for power lights up and the one for wifi starts to blink.
however, when i connect my modem to it nothing happens and the light remains off.
the same happens when i try to connect my computer to the router.
moreover, i don't see the router in the wireless networks list.
i'm sure i'm doing everything according to the manual and plugging all the cords right.
i already tried to reset the router a dozen times.
do you think something can be done or is it a hopeless case and the router is simply dead?
