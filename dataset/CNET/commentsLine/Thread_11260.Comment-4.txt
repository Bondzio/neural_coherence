there are various different flavours of record players, but most will need a phono box.
there are some budget modern decks which have this built in to output a line out suitable for jacking into a computer (amp, etc) but the vast majority of record decks require pre-amplification and equalisation.
and we aren't talking about 'to get it to work best' or 'for best sound' - we are talking about just getting the connection to work in the first place.
there are phono boxes and there are phono boxes, but the cheapest way is to use your integrated amplifier, i.e.
most likely the amp you had the record player plugged into originally.
using the tape out of the integrated amp connected to the pc, you can record the preamplified signal of the record deck.
if you want to get fancier / easier, this one for example has a usb output, so you can plug it directly into a usb socket of the pc.
this saves you having to mess around with volumes too much, and will offer the best conversion since the signal is already digital when it enters your computer.
