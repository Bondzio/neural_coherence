1.1.1	Hey all , I recently got a good deal on 4GB ( 2 modules ) of Corsair ram which runs at a timing of 5-5-5-18 I believe .	St
1.1.2	The current memory in my PC is Crucial Ballistix , 4GB ( 4x1GB sticks ) and runs at 7-7-7-24 .	St
1.1.3	From what I 've heard , I could run the two sticks of Corsair with two extra sticks of Crucial as long as I underclocked the faster memory to match the Crucial ... but my real questions is , is this worth it ?	Ques
1.1.4	Or would 4GB of the lower timing memory perform better than an underclocked 6gb ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	For sticks on the same memory bus , the speed is set to the lowest speed stick .	St
1.2.2	HOWEVER I 've seen people fret endlessly about this .	St
1.2.3	Then we run some benchmarks and only there do we see the 0.1 % difference .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	So ... are you saying it would be best to run the 4gb of faster ram , rather than 6gb of slower ?	Ques
1.3.2	Thanks	Polite
1.4.1	On my kid 's machine with just 2GB it runs games superbly .	St
1.4.2	Why going more than this is mostly a discussion about consumers being oversold .	St
1.4.3	Take the faster 4GB .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
