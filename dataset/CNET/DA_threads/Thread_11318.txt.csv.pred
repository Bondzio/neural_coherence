1.1.1	Hey guys , I 'm new to this forum ; but even I know that there have been many gaming keyboard threads , and I can easily find some information on the internet regarding this subject .	St
1.1.2	But , taking in all of this info and even going through countless keyboards after 2 months , I 'm still unable to make a decision .	St
1.1.3	This is kinda long , sorry about having you read through all of this .	St
1.1.4	But it 's needed because my decision is very complex .	St
1.1.5	Let 's start at the beginning : I decided I needed a new keyboard , and after I got my new rig , I figured getting a gaming keyboard would n't hurt as I game quite a bit .	St
1.1.6	So the first one that my dad bought home for me was a $ 50 Microsoft Reclusa .	St
1.1.7	The minute I tried typing on it I hated the overly excessive & quot ; mushiness & quot ; and softness of the key press .	St
1.1.8	The backlighting was nothing spectacular ( a bit dim ) and the extra features were not anything special like the G15 .	St
1.1.9	So he returned it and we went on .	St
1.1.10	The Saitek Eclipse II really caught my eye , as I 'm very prone to getting sucked into these little gimmicks and cool things that companies stick in there to make people like me want to buy them .	St
1.1.11	Yes .	St
1.1.12	I 'm that type of person ; so I picked up an Eclipse II ( $ 75 ) .	St
1.1.13	On the way to the cashier , we went past a 2nd Gen Logitech G15 ( at that time , I 'd no idea that there was a 1st gen version ) .	St
1.1.14	My dad let me pick one of those up also for me to try out ( $ 80 .	Sug
1.1.15	the store has a good return policy ) .	St
1.1.16	So I did .	St
1.1.17	I went home and broke open the packaging on the G15 and plugged it in .	St
1.1.18	By far , of all of the keyboards I tried , I loved the G15 key press .	St
1.1.19	The overall feel of the keys and the right amount of depth to the press felt really good .	St
1.1.20	The backlighting is a little dim , and I 'm very disappointed that it is orange .	St
1.1.21	My rig is blue ; but I 'm going to pick up a G9 for my mouse pretty soon , so I guess I could change the LED color to orange to match it .	St
1.1.22	Next I opened the Eclipse II .	St
1.1.23	The backlighting on this thing is phenomenal .	St
1.1.24	It 's super bright and really catches the eye .	St
1.1.25	However for $ 75 , I 'm paying for the luxury of having 3 colors .	St
1.1.26	This keyboard lacks so many features of the G15 .	St
1.1.27	The key press is not anything great ; the keys are slippery and the keyboard clacks alot when typing .	St
1.1.28	It was a hard decision to make .	St
1.1.29	And then I went onto the Saitek website .	St
1.1.30	I saw their new & quot ; Cyborg & quot ; keyboard , and I was immediately sucked in .	St
1.1.31	I told my dad to return BOTH the keyboards and I 'd wait for the cyborg to ship .	St
1.1.32	Something like 3 days later , CNET released a cyborg keyboard video preview from CES .	St
1.1.33	It was disappointing to say the least .	St
1.1.34	And when he said & quot ; there 's no blue & quot ; that really turned me away .	St
1.1.35	And having to wait till March was something that I 'm not keen on doing ( I 'm really impatient ) .	St
1.1.36	So here we are again .	St
1.1.37	Back to square one , trying to decide which keyboard to get .	St
1.1.38	I loved the G15 , so I looked up some more info .	St
1.1.39	I discovered the first generation batches , and I decided that it would be the keyboard I wanted .	St
1.1.40	The ultra customizability , the blue backlighting , it was the keyboard that I wanted .	St
1.1.41	But the problem was ; it 's no where to be found in my city of Calgary !	St
1.1.42	The BestBuy website claims they have them in stock , but when I traveled there to check it out , they were long gone .	St
1.1.43	I searched online and the cheapest place to buy it was for $ 100 , including GST and air shipping .	St
1.1.44	The ultimate problem solver ?	Ques
1.1.45	The Saitek Eclipse 1 .	St
1.1.46	For $ 40 , it gives me the most bang for buck .	St
1.1.47	With the G9 in my possession , I already have alot of macros at my fingertips .	St
1.1.48	The G15 macros seem like they are hard to reach .	St
1.1.49	I do n't think I 'd use them much for FPS .	St
1.1.50	So the lack of macros is not something that I miss THAT much .	St
1.1.51	So here is the full breakdown : -G15 2nd Gen - $ 80 -G15 1st Gen - $ 100 -Saitek Eclipse 1 - $ 40 I 've narrowed it down to these 3 choices .	St
1.1.52	Keep in mind the games I play .	St
1.1.53	Occasionally I will have an RTS here and there but very occasionally .	St
1.1.54	I 'm wondering whether or not the macros and the LCD screen are useful to me .	St
1.1.55	The Eclipse 1 is the most eye catching and most simplistic .	St
1.1.56	I ca n't go wrong with it .	St
1.1.57	I 've never tried typing on an Eclipse 1 , though .	St
1.1.58	I do n't know how I 'll like it ; but I 'm assuming it will be about the same as the II .	St
1.1.59	The 2nd Gen G15 is my favorite key press , and I GUESS I can live with the orange backlighting .	St
1.1.60	If I really wanted to .	St
1.1.61	So that 's my dilemma .	St
1.1.62	I hope you can help !	St
1.1.63	Thanks in advance .	St
1.1.64	-Jesse	St
1.2.1	well im not sure if they still have it but i got my first gen g15 at buy.com fer like 60 $ on sale i think original price was 80 $ and i love the g15 i dont use the macros to much but ive set them up to open programs or use in games which has been helpfull .	St
1.2.2	so id look online its really easy to find great deals on stuff like this	St
1.3.1	about the screen ... i love it its extreamly helpfull in bf2 and bf2142 it took me awhile to find the app for css but im glad i did becuase it sucks when i have to open that score screen in the middle of a game and get shot all i have to do is look down for half a second if i had to make the choise again id pay 150 $ jus for the screen and being able to adjust the screen helps alot so i wouldent get the 2nd model g15	St
