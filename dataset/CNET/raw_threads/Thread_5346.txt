This was my experiment with Linux, and it was successful. This old computer is an Acer Aspire (1997). Because this computer runs 24X7, I want to estimate its power consumption, to calculate how much I pay for the electricity it consumes. The specs are: - Intel pentium MMX 166 MHz (Consumes 2.9 Watts, source: http://www.intel.com/design/intarch/prodbref/273209.htm ) - 72 MB SIMM RAM (two modules) - 1GB Fujitsu HDD 5200 RPM - Unknown motherboard (presume 1997 build) - No graphics accelerator - Network card: D-Link DFE 530TX+ - Startech 2-port PCI USB card (Never in use) - 8X CDROM drive (never in use) - 1.44 inch Floppy drive (never in use) - One processor fan - One Power supply fan - Monitor: 15 inch CRT monitor permanently turned off - One power indicator LED (green/orange) Can someone help me in getting a trustworthy estimate of power consumption of individual components? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

The big consumers will be the motherboard and HDD. The 80 watts given earlier for the box is probably a good estimate. The monitor will not consume any power if turned completely off and not just in standby.
