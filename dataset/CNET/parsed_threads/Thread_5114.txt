<s> i'm getting an asus essentio CG5275-AR003 that i will be using for gaming. </s>
<s> but i want to get a video card for it seen as it only has an integrated card. </s>
<s> i'm already shellin out 700 bucks for the computer so i cant spend to much on the card only 100-150. i dont know much about the subject so please help. </s>
<s> Choose your pick from http://www.tomshardware.com/charts/gaming-graphics-charts-q3-2008/benchmarks,30.html . </s>
<s> It's up to you to decide between high-quality or mainstream. </s>

<s> i just need some advice. </s>
<s> i dont even know where to start. </s>
<s> the site you gave me doesn't help because i know nothing about any video cards. </s>
<s> maybe a link to a video card buying guide would be more helpful </s>
<s> http://reviews.cnet.com/graphics-cards/?tag=leftColumnArea.0 is our own review section. </s>
<s> That might be somewhat more intelligeable. </s>
<s> And I would say, first have a look at the system requirements of the games you want to play. </s>
<s> It could be they play well enough using the integrated graphics. </s>
<s> If not, you'll learn the minimum requirements you need. </s>
<s> Even if the motherboard comes with integrated graphics, you can add a videocard of your choice later. </s>
<s> So there's no need to decide now. </s>
<s> Why not postpone your decision? </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> thanks for the advice. </s>
<s> i'd planned on trying the onboard one first. </s>
<s> but just thought id figure out which one i would get if the performance isn't up to my standards. </s>
