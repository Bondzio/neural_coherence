In that case I have to pass.
I was under the impression the printer connection to the router was fine; &quot; I have managed to set up my printer's wifi just fine.
It appears connected on the printer's screen &quot;.
May be Bob's observation is right.
His surfboard didn't have wifi.
He asked if you had a different model.
