1.1.1	I would like to set up a computer in a public area , and I 'd like to attach a printer .	St
1.1.2	However , it would have to be one which was coin-operated , as otherwise it will be impossible to fund , and without the need to pay , it would be taken advantage of .	St
1.1.3	Is there any printer that could handle the hardware and software aspects of a pay-per-page system ?	Ques
1.1.4	As it would be in the UK , it would ( ideally ) need to recognize English currency .	St
1.1.5	Obviously , the lower maintenance and running cost , the better .	St
1.1.6	Black and white would be fine .	St
1.1.7	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thank you	St
1.2.1	They do that all the time .	St
1.2.2	It 's in a store and you pay by the page .	St
1.2.3	A hardware solution like those self service photo printers may be a nice idea but do you have the near million bucks needed to create such ?	Ques

1.3.1	The idea was to have in the library at our college a computer hooked up to a HD with 40,000 books , with free access 24/7 , so that any time someone is doing research etc. , they can use this amazing software .	St
1.3.2	The problem is , left to their own devices , students would print out whole sections , a hundred pages or more , without a second thought .	St
1.3.3	Next time they need something , they 'll reprint that whole section ... As you can imagine , that would use up tons of ink , paper etc .	St
1.3.4	However , if they need to pay lets say 5p a page , they will be more careful with these things ... Any advice ?	Ques
1.4.1	Set up a web page for the PDF file and for printing , cut a deal with Kinko 's .	St
1.5.1	You need a & quot ; coin box & quot ; that generally has some control on printer 's own frt .	St
1.5.2	panel or similar .	St
1.5.3	You must have seen such on devices for whatever but you need to talk to a service provider of such services if they can do this work .	St
1.5.4	more than likely its already done , I 'm sure some copier center has provided such services .	St
1.5.5	Of course , ones not humanly handled .	St
1.5.6	As often the case here ( USA ) , some decal/sticker is present for service if such a device falters .	St
1.5.7	You look in your local telco pages or google for same .	St
1.5.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	http : //www.printeron.com/ No indication of costs but it would save you the development work .	St
