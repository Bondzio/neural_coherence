well, i didn't directly answer your question in my earlier post ~ a switch does not have the intelligence and safeguards built into it to enhance security.
if you had purchased another router (same brand and model), generally speaking, it would not enhance security either.
a different brand/model of router might enhance security (generally speaking) because it might use a different set of algorithms for the security functions, and hacker attacks would have to crack the first router security firewall, then discover and crack the second security firewall.
honestly, with only one router you are pretty safe, but i recommend viewing the articles on cnet.com regarding securing your home network, ok?
