Also, is it better to buy a pogoplug to convert an external drive I already have, or to buy a network drive? I have two computers, one running Vista and another running Windows XP that I want to have the ability to store files on the external drive via my home network.

And since we can share this drive on the network, I don't have to put it on some network and suffer the slow speed on my machine. Bob

You say you can share the USB drive on the network, but you don't have to put it on some network and suffer the slow speed. What do you do? Connect it via a USB port to whichever computer you are using? Sounds rather awkward? Dwight

The difference between the networked drive and the USB external drive is that the networked drive is &quot;shared&quot; over the LAN network and the external is a HDD on the end of a serial bus. I prefer to use networked drives, it's much easier than having to pull out hardware all the time when I move it from machine to machine.
