When you go to print, the little printer icon flashes on very briefly on the taskbar and then it disappears-and printer doesn't print. In the device manager, the message indicates that the printer is working properly (but it isn't). Anybody have this problem and what have you done to solve problem? Thanks. PS OS is Win 98.

The owner paid dearly as I charged them for the priviledge of a lesson in electronics, schematics, parallel interfaces and the use of an oscilloscope as well as the loopback parallel port tester. Not that I didn't mind, but they wanted &quot;proof&quot; the parallel port was dead. It was only 100 for the hour, but they were not so upset but that the laptop parallel port is only repaired by changing the motherboard... That's one possibility. You would also install printer drivers, try other printer cables, try another printer and if you have a LAN, try to print over a network to avoid the cost of a new motherboard. Best of luck, Bob

I picked up one for 20 bucks at a store to solve this issue. Here's a Froogle: http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=usb+printer+cable 2. A PC-Card printer port. Another Froogle: http://froogle.google.com/froogle?&q=PCMCIA+%22PRINTER+PORT%22 (Not cheap...) 3. USB DOCKING PORT (has parallel port.) http://froogle.google.com/froogle?&q=USB+DOCKING+PORT
