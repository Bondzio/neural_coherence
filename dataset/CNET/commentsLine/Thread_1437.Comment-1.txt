hi all, i'm hoping i can explain what we are trying to do without sounding like a complete idiot.
doubtful.
we have a wireless signal in our house that comes through a service provided router.
the troubles come when we try to get internet to our shop which is separate from the house and a couple hundred feet away.
we have tried a wireless repeater with no success.
my husband ran cat5 such that you can have a wired connection in the shop, but we cannot seem to get a wireless network to work through this connection.
at my disposal i have the service provided router, a linksys wireless-g wrt54g v8, and a uspeed wireless-n wi-fi repeater access point range extender .
any help would be most appreciated.
thanks!
