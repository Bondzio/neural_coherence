1.1.1	I just put my system together with an ASUS MA3790T-Deluxe MB and an AMD Phenom 9950 ( 125 watt ) .	St
1.1.2	I thought I could get by with an older ATX power supply and was just using a 4 pin input on the 8 pin socket and my CPU fan is not running .	St
1.1.3	I can get into the bios and such but do not want to run the machine for long because I can see the CPU temp rising in the Hardware monitor .	St
1.1.4	I tried plugging in two 4-pin ATX jacks to the socket but they did not fit cleanly and the concept made me queasy to begin with ( is this something to avoid ? )	Ques
1.1.5	I 'm guessing/hoping that this is due to the lack of an 8 pin ATX input on that socket ( documentation does specifically note that this should be used ) .	St
1.1.6	I have a new ATX 12 V v2 power supply coming in two days but want to be sure I have a backup plan if that is not the case .	St
1.1.7	My question is whether it is reasonable to assume that the power supply is the reason the CPU fan is not working .	St
1.1.8	Is is possible that the CPU fan power jack has a problem ( MB was an open box item on Newegg ... ) ?	Ques
1.1.9	Is it an issue with the heat sink , perhaps ( and can I swap out my heat sink for my AMD 2 to check ) ?	Ques
1.1.10	Further , if the new power supply does not resolve the problem , is there an alternate CPU heat sink that would run off of a 4 pin ATX connector ?	Ques
1.1.11	This would seem like a reasonable workaround .	St
1.2.1	Open box from NewEgg , you take your chances and must be aware of correction based on your knowledge .	St
1.2.2	It could already be damaged when you received it or simply not having all the goodies that came in the box , like CD , or cables , etc..	St
1.2.3	If it fails after all is said and done , return it ? ? ?	Ques
1.2.4	if possible .	St
1.2.5	As for connections , they are not a mystery .	St
1.2.6	if you have to force or somehow guess , then either you lack the proper connections due to an old psu or too old period .	St
1.2.7	WAIT , until the new psu comes , you may cause damage and become clueless or few options to recover .	St
1.2.8	Yes , newer psu have various connections and some & quot ; do n't get used & quot ; as they are for Intel type or multiple similar connects like for video power .	St
1.2.9	You have to be sure .	St
1.2.10	When you get new psu , come back with results .	St
1.2.11	If no manual , get one form the mtrbd .	St
1.2.12	support website and d/l it for that model # .	St
1.2.13	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	Well , I got another tip to plug the CPU fan into the power fan connector on the motherboard to test if it was the heat sink unit .	St
1.3.2	This powers the fan and lets me run the box .	St
1.3.3	I 'm still curious if the 8 pin connector will resolve the issue with the proper connector and will post an update on that .	St
1.3.4	If it does not ( which would mean the CPU fan connector is defective ) , I can live without the fan speed throttling that the cpu fan connector would enable .	St
1.3.5	I would like to invest in more exotic cooling mechanisms down the line anyhow .	St
1.3.6	I 'm curious though , currently I get a warning on bootup & quot ; CPU fan error ! & quot ; Not having clean boots could get annoying .	St
1.3.7	How do other CPU cooling devices ( like water or oil immersion ) work ?	Ques
1.3.8	Would they plug into the CPU fan connector to resolve this ?	Ques
1.3.9	There may also be a bios setting that I can change to fix this .	St
1.3.10	I 'll update this thread with the 8-pin connector results .	St
1.3.11	Thanks to Willy for the advice !	St
