I have a dog kennel located about 110' from my house. I am using a Logitech Security camera to monitor the kennel. As the camera uses the electrical system as the antenna, I have run an extension cord from the house to the kennel, which has its own electrical system, as an interim option. However, I would like ro find a way that I can plug the camera and soon to be multiple cameras inti the kennel electric. However they need to be plugged into the same electrical system that the router is on, which is the house. How can I overcome this obstacle without needing a second IP for the kennel?
