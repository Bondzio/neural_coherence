12908	0	4619	54632	NR	judyneric	12/2/03 6:02 AM	1.07034492E12	Two Hard Drives, Now What?	I started with a 20GB hard drive, and just added a 120GB hard drive. Everything is still on the 20GB. I use XP. Where should I put files? Should I keep XP on the 20GB and move all my data and programs to the 120GB? Or vice versa? Any ideas on this? One thing I will be doing is putting old Hi8 tapes through my camcorder (via firewire) so I can convert them to DVD. I would assume I am best off transferring these to the 120GB as it is faster and larger. But should I move anything off my old slower 20GB HD; would my system performance increase by moving EVERYTHING over to the new drive? Oh, and how would I do any of this? THANK YOU!!!

Or vice versa? Any ideas on this?&quot; I just did something similar. I used Ghost2002 to copy a system from one drive to another, removed the older slower drive as a backup and made the newer faster drive as the master and wher the OS is and files are. Much nicer and no big questions. &quot;One thing I will be doing is putting old Hi8 tapes through my camcorder (via firewire) so I can convert them to DVD.

This question will sort itself out as you will soon realise. &quot;But should I move anything off my old slower 20GB HD; would my system performance increase by moving EVERYTHING over to the new drive?&quot; Your choice. But what I did. &quot;Oh, and how would I do any of this? &quot; I used Ghost 2002. But the drive may have come with software and instructions to do this move. Try that. Bob

I will move everything over to the new drive, and then make it the Master. Is there a need to change anything in BIOS, or do I just switch the jumpers around and let the system boot up? As far as transferring data, the new drive is a Western Digital and came with Data Lifeguard Tools, which should do the trick, I believe. I will then use the old drive as my back-up drive. Is it okay to just leave the old drive in as a Slave, and back-up to that on occasion? Or is there a chance that if the system crashes, both drives could be obliterated? And thanks for the tip about preferably limiting movie files to 1 hour. Sorry to ask more questions on top of my questions! Much appreciated!

Is there a need to change anything in BIOS, or do I just switch the jumpers around and let the system boot up?&quot; Too dependent on the machine in question. The last time I did this, the BIOS settings were on AUTO and not even a jumper was moved because 80 conductor IDE cables use the drives in CABLE SELECT mode. &quot;As far as transferring data, the new drive is a Western Digital and came with Data Lifeguard Tools, which should do the trick, I believe.&quot; I've used that. Seems to work for most. &quot;I will then use the old drive as my back-up drive. Is it okay to just leave the old drive in as a Slave, and back-up to that on occasion? Or is there a chance that if the system crashes, both drives could be obliterated?&quot; I removed the drive for various reasons. - The drive was smaller and slower and created too many questions about where to store files. - I didn't want to upgrade the power supply or worry about cooling issues. - Yes. Data on writeable devices is at risk during any disaster. Bob And thanks for the tip about preferably limiting movie files to 1 hour.&quot;
