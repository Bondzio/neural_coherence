I cant ge to the BIOS to change any options. My problem was that when I started my computer it would start (everything ran) then seconds afterwards it would shut off..so I know the problem so now I need ya'll to tell me the solution..I dont want to take it in to the shop b/c of the high costs and Im sure I can fix it so please help!

I could be wrong but if starting the computer and then shutting down like that it sound like you make need to buy a power supply with more watts. The other thing that i noticed was that the temp. was high but according to you, the right amount of thermal paste was applied and the fan was installed correctly, if all that was correct consider this the system needs power like you need food to make ATP for ur cells' activities, but anyways consider more wattts. And also MAYBE something was damaged by static shock just something to think about.

I hope you meant a pea sized dot of paste instead of an amount of paste the size of a pea. Once you spread it out it should be thin enough that none squirts out the side when you mount the heatsink. Did you visually verify that the cpu fan was spinning? Personally I would be very suspicious of the power supply. I would not go for more watts I would use a better company. Seasonic, Fortran, Silverstone, Antec, Enermax all make pretty good power supplies.

P5WD2 Premium BIOS 0606: Fix CrashFree fail issue with ECC DRAM Fix WinXP can't be installed from a PX-716SA SATA DVD-RW drive in AHCI mode. Fix ECC initial incorrect Adjust low threshold of CPU fan. Support ATI CrossFire technology. I'm wondering if you fan never kicks on. Have you observed your CPU fan with your case open?
