i was a little hasty in my `prognosis'.
however; i have had nothing but problems with this `bird'.
over 4 mos.
in the shop.
emails galore.
one tech says mobo, another say not.
i have switched the gpus, (at the prompt from the tech).
one of the fans, southbridge or north.
i`m not sure, keeps falling off.
i`m supposed to get a new one delivered but i still wait.
i`m going to get a digital pyrometer and check the temps again.
ps.
after shut down, the usb ports on the `bird' are allways `live'.
is this normal?
every pc i own, have owned and including friends pcs.
none of them have power to the usb ports when the rig is off.
i got this rig last nov. this is not right.
thanks.
