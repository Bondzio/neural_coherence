if i'm reading your post correctly both of these seem to be sata drives the 40gb is a sata 1 with a 1.5gb/s transfer and the 80gb is sata 2 with a 3.0gb/s tranfer.
if you pc has the sata connection i would suggest going with the 80gb drive since most sata 2 drives are backwards compatible.
as for the drive format ntfs is traditionally more stable then fat32.
