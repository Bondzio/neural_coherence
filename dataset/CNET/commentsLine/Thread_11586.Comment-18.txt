reasons why this dvd player is not working, i guess it is time to try something else.
at this point i would go with an archive and install and see if that fixes the problem.
i note that the poster has considered this but turned it down because of the updates.
not a really good excuse not to do it as the os updates are automatic and don't require baby sitting.
most of what has been written about this does seem to point toward a software problem.
it's worth a try, only takes 20 minutes or so and all your data remains intact.
