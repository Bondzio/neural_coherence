i recently spoke with someone with experience in computers who told me that installing a new cpu is a &quot; piece of cake.&quot; she said i should buy a kit that includes a fan and not just the cpu itself.
she also said that many cpu kits come with the heatsink already attached and with the thermal paste already applied, and that all i would have to do is to peel off a sticker on the bottom of the cpu and install it.
i would not necessarily need to remove the mobo in order to do this if the cpu could be gently inserted into the socket.
if true, this does sound easy.
by the way, i am thinking of upgrading to a 64x2 amd socket 939. true or false?
