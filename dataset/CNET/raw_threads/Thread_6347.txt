12352	0	588422	5436171	NR	abrahamondoma	3/13/13 6:20 AM	1.3631556E12	Nanostation M5	Hi Colleagues, I just procured and installed Nanostation M5 wireless AP, but noticed that introducing this device into my network (LAN) brings it down, thereby denying users of internet services. Could there be a compatibility problem here? Please help me out.
