<s> Hello guys, I have an LG external hard disk portable 2.5, its light is working but the disk is not working and not being recognized by windows. </s>
<s> First I tried it on windows 7 and it didn't work and I thought that the problem is from win 7. </s>
<s> Then I tried it on win XP =&gt; SAME Problem. </s>
<s> I will answer some common Qs: What kind of computer are you attaching it to? </s>
<s> Desktop What OS is this computer running? </s>
<s> win7/ win xp How is the external drive formatted? </s>
<s> N/A Did it work recently? </s>
<s> yes When was the last time it worked? </s>
<s> N/A Did anything change? </s>
<s> N/A Does it show up on another computer? </s>
<s> no How are you connecting it - USB? </s>
<s> USB If you go to disk management (start, run, compmgmt.msc, disk management), what does it show? </s>
<s> Does it show in the device manager (same section, but device manager instead of disk management)? </s>
<s> it doesn't show the disk anything at all. </s>
<s> Kindly Advice. </s>

<s> Sounds like the usual failures. </s>
<s> These are usually USB powered so I carry in my kit bag a USB &quot;Y&quot; cable to get more power to such drives. </s>
<s> AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT ON LAPTOPS to be on AC POWER when using such things. </s>
<s> For DESKTOPS be sure to try the REAR USB PORTS (which have more power and something else I will skip discussing.) </s>
<s> If that fails don't panic yet. </s>
<s> Order a new USB enclosure and move the drive to the new enclosure if you must save your files. </s>
<s> If you fret about the warranty then exercise that but your files won't be coming back! </s>

<s> My USB cable has on port not dual. </s>
<s> I tried to connect it to the rear ports but no luck. </s>
<s> I think I'll have to replace the cable or try another enclosure. </s>
<s> Thank u so much for the fast response. </s>
<s> I really appreciate it. </s>
