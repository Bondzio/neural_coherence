It actually comes out about the same.
the rebate on the the RAM originally listed was good on only one of the sets.
so I wasn't getting both sets for ~$30 for a total of $60 Also the RAM I'm getting is listed for more than I what I paid for it.
I think an offer expired.
Either way it was going to be ~$120.
Also, a big factor in switching was that the corsair message boards were saying the MOBO I got didn't do well with all the slots filled up with the RAM i originally listed.
