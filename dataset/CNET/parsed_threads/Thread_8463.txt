<s> Hi, - My wireless connection on my laptop gets lost whenever I receive phone call. </s>
<s> Do you know the reason? </s>
<s> - Also how do you use &quot;PC card&quot; on a desktop computer? </s>
<s> Is it just for laptops? </s>
<s> I'm planning to add a wirelles adapter to my Desktop PC, specifically &quot;Microsoft MN-730&quot;. </s>
<s> Which one do you recommend USB adapter or PCI adapter? </s>
<s> I'll bet you $500 that you have a 2.4GHz cordless phone! </s>
<s> Move the base and/or handset as far from the router and PC cards as practical, or get a 900MHz, or 5.8GHz model instead. </s>
<s> The wi-Fi operates at 2.4GHz. </s>
<s> I agree captaincraig, as a 2.4 GHz very definitely interfere with a 802.11b (most common) wireless network, as they both work in the same frequency range. </s>
<s> As for the PC Card, it can be used on a desktop, but it requires a special PCI card be installed inside the desktop. </s>
<s> As for the Microsoft adapters, either should work equally well. </s>
<s> The USB adapter is easier as it's external. </s>
<s> Wi-Fi networks work on 2.4 ghz range so if you have a 2.4 ghz phone you will lose the connection because the network and phone will conflict with one another. </s>
<s> As for the other things I don't know enough to give you sound advice. </s>
