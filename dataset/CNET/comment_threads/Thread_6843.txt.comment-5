GSkill probably would have worked but when a MB has been out as long as the 680i has and that memory, GSkill, is not listed...best to stick with something listed as compatible.
GSKill is good RAM in fact I have 4GB of the PC1066 in a GigaByte MB.
Re the MB...I'd recommend looking for something with a newer chipset.
If I recall correctly at one time there were problems with the 680i and the Q6600.
Maybe the 780i Re the HDD...take a look at the WD6400AAKS...640GB Re the PCP PSU....you'll like that !
