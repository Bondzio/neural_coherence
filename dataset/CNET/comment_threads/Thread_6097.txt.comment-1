I'm in need of a portable drive to use when on the road with only my laptop, but want to avoid the fuss of the bulkier My Book plus the power adapter.
However, I can't seem to figure out what the difference between these two lines is.
Since they are both 2.5&quot; FF USB-powered drives, I'm stumped --- anything between these two that should sway my decision?
