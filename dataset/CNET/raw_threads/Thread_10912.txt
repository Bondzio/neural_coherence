I know for a fact that the laptop I'm about to purchase 1)takes a desktop processor and 2)says it can only take a Wolfdale Intel Core 2 Duo only up to 2.66ghz. Right now, I could either spend on Newegg $164.99 for the Wolfdale Core 2 Duo 2.66ghz E8200 or spend five bucks more $169.99 for an E8400 which is 3.0ghz. Just as for as pricing goes, it makes a lot more sense to spend the extra five bucks for the faster one. Also, I could very well use it in a different computer in the future in which case its full potential would be used. Can I use the 3.0ghz cpu without damaging anything even though the specs for the laptop/motherboard say it only goes up to 2.66? Thanks as always!

If so, those desktop Core 2 Duos do quite well with overclocking, at least in desktops In a laptop, you'll want to be VERY careful - use one of those laptop cooling pads with the fans in it, increase the front-side bus speed very gradually, and only have it overclocked when you've got the machine plugged into the mains. And do whatever you can to keep the air going into the laptop cool as well, i.e. no direct sunlight, and air-con.
