hmm maybe try going to the control panel and opening the add remove programs and removing the update cuz im running a 733mhz with windows xp from a pc thats probably as old as your and has parts that are just mixed and matched.
Those windows updates dont do anything good they just slow everything down.
When i would update from the site i would restart and slower than ever.
But im not to familiar with the Me vers of windows but its worth a shot.
