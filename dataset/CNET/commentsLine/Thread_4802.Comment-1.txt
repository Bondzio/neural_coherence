win xp sp3; intel 8400 dual core; 2 gig ram; have 4 hdd plus put sil image 3124 raid controller in pci slot.
three 2 tb wd green drives connected to the raid controller, plus 4 more hdd to motherboard sata connections.
i first formatted each 2tb drive, then connected to sil image raid controller and told it to set up a raid 5 parity array (3 ea 2tb drives should give 4tb raid 5 available).
that took 4 days.
finally says it completed the task.
i boot win expecting to see it - nothing.
doesn't show up in explore, not in disk management.
sil image software says it's good to go, it just isn't there.
check bios - does not show up as a drive, but interesting the raid controller card is listed as a possible boot drive???
check system - hardware - device manager.
it's listed under scsi and raid controllers and says it's working and driver is fine.
it is also listed under disk drives, but volumes is blank, when i populate it says status unknown, disk unreadable, 0 available.
using 3 each 2tb drives in a raid 5 should give me 4 tb available???
going back to software under program, it shows up, shows is raid 5, but under raid group tab there's an option bring raid group online, but it is grayed out.
any help?
bios, software, windows, disk management - can't find anything to make it active or bring it online.
