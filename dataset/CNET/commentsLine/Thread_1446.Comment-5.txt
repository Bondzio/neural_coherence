i purchased this moniter on may 26 of last year (2004), and this issue didn't get worse until the beginning of this week... my monitor only stays on for 2 seconds, and then blacks out.
i called up hp yesterday, and they said that they have been having alot of problems with these monitors lately, so therefore, they extended the warrenty, but then he also said only 4 out of 10 people are capable of receiveing a new moniter (and i was one), so they're sending me a new one of these crap things withing 3 weeks or so, and i have to mail my broken one back.
i am expecting the new one to breakdown as well, but until then since it's free i'm just going to &quot;enjoy&quot; using it, and then buy a dell or something .. never buy hp!!!!!!!!
