<s> I know how stupid this sounds, but I need help with my Epson WorkForce 600. </s>
<s> I got a paper jam, which I cleared. </s>
<s> I also canceled the printing job. </s>
<s> The printer tells me to turn it off after I cleared it. </s>
<s> But there is no power button, just a button to stop/clear settings. </s>
<s> I pressed that, I pressed the start button, but all I get is flashing green lights. </s>
<s> I've look carefully at the booklet, but there is no diagram showing all the parts of the printer. </s>
<s> There has to be a power button somewhere. </s>
<s> I checked the Epson troubleshooting page, but it's no help. </s>
<s> I think I'm going crazy!!! </s>
<s> Please help me. </s>
<s> But let's talk about clearing those print jobs. </s>
<s> It's slightly technical but it is one of the annoying things that I deal with every month. </s>
<s> Here's a few articles about it. </s>

<s> Interesting note via the specs as its ENERGY complaint and that means it goes to &quot;sleep&quot; thus it may not have a switch. </s>
<s> Honestly, you have to look over the unit and go from that. </s>
<s> Otherwise, place on a power strip and shutdown 100% that way AFTER you allow it to go to sleep(idle). </s>
<s> Basically, the ptr. </s>
<s> is using a logic circuit to keep it ON/OFF as I suspect very much like a PC. </s>
<s> If that's the case, check for any s/w feature to control that action. </s>
<s> That's my best guess as so many printers out there. </s>
<s> AND yes, IMHO that's not a good thing. </s>
<s> Of course, you can pull the AC plug. </s>

<s> The power ON/OFF is that button on the frt. </s>
<s> top of printer. </s>
<s> Press it once to power OFF. </s>
<s> If it blinks, etc. </s>
<s> for some time allow it to do so, it should finally go OFF. </s>
<s> However going OFF maybe more of going to sleep. </s>
<s> The manual I quickly reviewed offers that up-to 5min. </s>
<s> may pass before it shuts down or sleeps. </s>
<s> That could also be related to any error condition as the blinking could refer to an error status(verify). </s>
<s> FYI - Power button/switch have the universal symbol of a arched circle with a line and dot in it. </s>
<s> Make notice of that on other PC devices, maybe the PC. </s>
