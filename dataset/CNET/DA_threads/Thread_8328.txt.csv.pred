1.1.1	I was wondering if something like this exists: I use Google Talk to talk to people around the US and overseas, using a USB headset which I absolutely love.	St
1.1.2	I would like to be able to go wireless with it.	St
1.1.3	I know I could do something with Bluetooth, but the range is pretty limited (30 feet max, under great, line-of-sight conditions).	St
1.1.4	I would prefer to go further (a couple of hundred feet would be nice) and for the signal to be able to pass through walls, just like a regular cordless phone.	St
1.1.5	I was wondering if I could carry a small transmitter/receiver that I plug the headset into, and also have a transmitter/receiver (not necessarily small) plugged into a USB port on my computer.	St
1.1.6	Please let me know if there's a solution to this.	Sug
1.1.7	Thank you very much, Colin	St
1.2.1	I bought the CIT200 by Linksys and find it acceptable for family use.	St
1.2.2	It has about the range of a normal cordless phone.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
