mixed up between mobo and case.
if the mobo has the firewire pins on the mobo surface, it will certainly support firewire in the chipset or a separate chip.
and you have a case that supports it, so then you will simply enable it in the bios fire wire is slowly becoming a standard along with usb.
remember it is a mac development and ms still doesn't acknowledge it.
they call it i[something].
mfrs don't like offending ms. lol
