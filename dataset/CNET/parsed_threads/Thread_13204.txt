<s> Not sure if my power supply just over heated. </s>
<s> I was on world of warcraft and all of a sudden my computer immediately shut down. </s>
<s> I tried turning it back on but when I hit the power button, only the fans would turn on for half a second. </s>
<s> I tried blowing the dust out with an air compresser but that did nothing. </s>
<s> I have tried a new power cord and a different outlet but nothing seemed to make a difference. </s>
<s> The fans will turn on for .5-2 seconds then shut down again. </s>
<s> Later I the computer turned itself on and the fans were running for a few seconds then I heard a pop and I could smell something burning. </s>
<s> So I pulled the power out and haven't touched it since. </s>
<s> My specs are as follows: 420 watt ps msi k8n neo2 platinum mobo geforce 6800gt 512x2 mushkin black pc 3200 ram AMD 64 3000+ 200 gb hard drive I'm worried that my powersupply may have over heated, I only have 2 case fans that were stock with the case. </s>
<s> Anyone have any ideas on whats happening? </s>
<s> Oh and Hello All! </s>
<s> If you're comfortable doing so, get a flashlight and take a look. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Took the power supply apart and on the circuit board I found a burnt dyote (sp?). </s>
<s> I turned the power supply on and it started smoking in that area. </s>
<s> That piece on the circiut I guess directions current into one direction only. </s>
<s> So hopefully it didn't damage other pieces. </s>
<s> There is only one other part that seemed like it got burnt a little from the dyote, but it seems to be fine. </s>
<s> This part will probably only cost me 2 dollars at radio shack, so hopefully it will solve the problem. </s>
<s> I'd play it safe and just get a new and BIGGER PSU. </s>
<s> Consider that your current PSU was likely overtaxed and this will happen again...or worse. </s>
<s> I'm thinking of 550W or larger. </s>
<s> In power supplies all too often more than one componet can be at fault. </s>
<s> Thus a whole circuit is comprised even if the obivous is found. </s>
<s> Alot can happen as you found a bad &quot;diode&quot;, that's not always good to fix and return as the psu is &quot;weaken&quot; and could easily blow again. </s>
<s> I suggest, just replace the psu and make it a higher wattage one. </s>
<s> This is the best advise I can pass on as a decent psu of at least 500W+ even if generic or a known namebrand of 400W+(more than 420W) is goint to be needed. </s>
<s> Unless you stress test the psu, then repair for best results, but rememeber when you return it to the system all those componets/devices dempendant upon it have already suffered one blow-out, can they another? </s>
<s> Plus, keep an eye on it if problem crop-up soon enough(30-days or less). </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Why risk everything to save 70$ for new one that will last for ever? </s>
<s> Might be a zener that provides one of the regulated voltages. </s>
<s> Either way the diode is likey a secondary failure due to the origina failure causing too much current or voltage to or through the diode. </s>
<s> A popping noise fairly loud is usually a Capacitor. </s>
<s> Have you looked to see if there are any blown caps? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Remember your own advice and next time your car motor conks out, buy a new one. </s>
<s> This is logical t/s'ing at least swap out the psu. </s>
<s> Of course if you can afford it buy a new system. </s>
<s> I think alot of users can't do that. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> In most cars when the motor conks out and needs replacement, it is cheaper to buy a new car than to replace the motor. </s>
<s> If you can jerry rig it to work for a while, when it breaks down again the car most likely won't explode. </s>
<s> It will simply need more motor repair. </s>
<s> In a computer everything is very sensitive to incorrect voltages and amperage. </s>
<s> An incorrect soldering in the PSU can cuase a short. </s>
<s> I have seen a fualty psu kill a mobo, proc, videocard and all the HDDs at once. </s>
<s> In this case, a new PSU is usually 1/10th the cast of the rest or less. </s>
<s> Put it in prospective. </s>
<s> That is a tiny cost. </s>
<s> In my orginal post, I did mention &quot;stress test&quot; in order to prove the psu is working and in order. </s>
<s> This is done by a capable person in order to lessen any failure with the real system. </s>
<s> If a person is willing to repair, then hopefully they're capable of following what's needed. </s>
<s> if not they pay the conseqences, good or bad. </s>
<s> I still stand by my &quot;motor&quot; example. </s>
<s> If a person is willing to repair a diode then I'm sure they're willing to replace some broken motor part or replace(in theory) to get things going. </s>
<s> But heck, if I have a fat wallet I'll let others do it. </s>
<s> Better yet, why visit this forum or any other for advice when &quot;buying new&quot; will pretty much fix the problem. </s>
<s> Not everyone has unlimited funds. </s>
<s> ayyy! </s>
<s> -----Willy </s>
<s> I dont have unlimited funds. </s>
<s> But if it blew in the first place was it really adequate for his needs? </s>
