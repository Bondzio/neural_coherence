The computer says, very good signal strength, and you are connected to wireless network. It says no problems with connection. When I open Internet Explorer, it defaults to (runonce.msn.com) Then I type in google, and it opens Google with just a little info in it, then after about 3 minutes, it open fully. What can I do to fix this problem ? It shows it is receiving at 11 mps. My router is supplying my other hardwired computer at 100 mps.
