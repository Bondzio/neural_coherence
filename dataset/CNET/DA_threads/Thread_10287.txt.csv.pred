1.1.1	I need to get an external hard drive ( my 3rd ) .	St
1.1.2	The first 2 were from OWC , and incorporated a Hitachi drive mechanism .	St
1.1.3	But now I see that OWC has switched to using Seagage Barracuda ( probably for price reasons ) .	St
1.1.4	The Hitachi is truly high-end , and super-reliable .	St

1.2.1	Bytecc case and Maxtor drive .	St

1.3.1	I recommend the Western Digital Caviar SE16 hard drive .	St
1.3.2	It is 7200RPM and has 16MB cache .	St
1.3.3	I recommend the Addonic AE5SACSUF enclosure .	St
1.3.4	It supports SATA I , SATA II , and IDE .	St
1.3.5	This enclosure connects to your computer either by firewire or USB 2.0 .	St
1.3.6	This enclosure is very sturdy and the aluminum material is thick .	St
1.3.7	It also uses the Cypress chipset for USB .	St
1.3.8	Cypress are supposed to be good chipsets .	St
1.3.9	However , that fan is loud .	St
1.3.10	If you do n't want to make your own , Western Digital has the My Book external hard drive .	St
