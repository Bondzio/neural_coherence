<s> I'm looking to build a multi purpose PC for gaming, internet browsing, multimedia etc. </s>
<s> This will be the first time I have built a computer so I don't have much knowledge on what components to get. </s>
<s> I've done a bit of research (reading reviews) but have found it difficult to find information on mid-range PCs. </s>
<s> I have a budget of approximately $1200. </s>
<s> I am keen on an AMD Athlon 64 CPU and a GeForce graphics card but I was hoping for some help on what components to get. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Many thanks...James. </s>
<s> Do you want to go SLI? </s>
<s> If so do you want to use 2 cheap cards (6600 gt) or get one better card 7800GT and upgrade later? </s>
<s> EVGA periodically runs Nforce 4 SLI motherboard + 7800GT packages at a discount. </s>
<s> I've seen these at Newegg.com . </s>
<s> How large a hard drive would you like? </s>
<s> How much ram? </s>
<s> Do you care more about silence or about performance? </s>
<s> Do you want a multicore system or a single core system? </s>
<s> Do you plan to over clock? </s>
<s> Thanks for the quick reply. </s>
<s> I was probably just looking at a single card at the moment and was seriously looking at the 6600 GT. </s>
<s> I'm in New Zealand so prices are a little higher than in the US. </s>
<s> I was hoping for at least 200GB hard drive and at least 1GB RAM - what brand do you recommend for RAM? </s>
<s> will I need DDR2? </s>
<s> I was hoping for a quiet system and I think single core will be fine. </s>
<s> I do not plan to overclock. </s>
<s> What do you recommend? </s>
<s> Many thanks...James </s>

<s> Thanks for the info Marty, I've had a look through and it looks good. </s>
<s> I'm in New Zealand, so prices are a bit higher here, meaning I might have to downgrade some of the components. </s>
<s> I was looking at Gigabyte GA-K8NXP-9 mobo - is Gigabyte a good brand? </s>
<s> Thanks again and any more more suggestions would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> James. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> too expensive mobo. </s>
<s> crucial memory? </s>
<s> whats with the raptors? </s>
<s> not worth it. </s>
<s> the 6600gt u gave is agp. </s>
<s> Thanks nerdyby, which thread were you referring to? </s>
<s> The prices in New Zealand are more expensive so I will have to downgrade a lot of the stuff mentioned to stay within approx. </s>
<s> US$1200. </s>
<s> Were you referring to the ASUS mobo or the Gigabye mobo as being to expensive? </s>
<s> I may get a raptor for the OS only and corsair HDDs for storage. </s>
<s> I'll definately want a PCI-e 6600 GT. </s>
<s> Any more suggestins appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Just built this (1st build) couple of months ago. </s>
<s> It is Intel based and most gamers seem to prefer the AMD and Nvidia combo. </s>
<s> Antec SLK2650-BQE mid tower w/350W PSU- you'll want more power for gaming. </s>
<s> $79 ASUS P5GD1 socket T Intel 915P ATX mobo. </s>
<s> $115 Intel P4 630 Prescott CPU $176 Corsair XMS 512MB 184 pin memory $70 Western Digital Caviar SE WD1200JDRTL 120 GB HDD $112 NEC IDE DVD burner ND 3540A $42 Teac IDE CD/DVD ROM $31 Used an ATI X300 video card from another computer. </s>
<s> This was for a lady friend who just plays low end games and office work. </s>
<s> So throw in Windows Office 2003 and Windows XP Pro for another $600 and she was happy. </s>
<s> Of course you won&quot;t need the Office. </s>
<s> Just an example her. </s>
<s> Good luck and you'll have fun building it! </s>
<s> less costly MoBo and CPU but Asus boards are a firm recommendation. </s>
<s> Is there anyone in the USA that you would trust running shipping detail with? </s>
<s> You could buy at the listed vendors and use their address. </s>
<s> They could, then, ship your items to you. </s>
<s> You would be able to get those items at the listed cost. </s>
<s> 10,000 rpm drives in a RAID 0 config. </s>
<s> Super fast. </s>
<s> I actually prefer Crucial memory to Corsair. </s>
<s> The system I have Corsair in seems to run slower than with Crucial. </s>
<s> Nontheless, those were my recommendations to the poster. </s>
<s> I stand by them. </s>
<s> you better: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=322696 </s>
<s> Thanks for all the great info, would it be worth getting the 256MB version of that card? </s>
<s> also I am unable to find a supplier for eVGA here, would the corresponding Gigabyte card be suitable? </s>
<s> Many thanks, James. </s>
<s> Thanks, I may be able to get it shipped to my uncle which would save money. </s>
<s> Thanks for the specs on the build, all good info. </s>
<s> As you said, I prefer the AMD and NVidia combo, but it's interesting to see what other people are putting together. </s>
<s> Thanks again and any more suggestions are appreciated. </s>
<s> would be a much better choice for gaming. </s>
<s> I've heard good things about Gigabyte. </s>
<s> Here's my recommendation for video card brands starting with the best: Asus EVGA BFG Leadtek Gigabyte XFX Any of these I believe would make a great card. </s>
<s> It is believed by some that Asus gets first pick of nVidia chips. </s>
<s> I don't buy Asus video cards but only because of the added cost for the best. </s>
<s> I believe, personally, that EVGA or any of these other brands would be more than satisfactory for me and my budget. </s>
<s> I do have an Asus video card, a 6200 TurboCache, and it runs great but I got it for no other reason than to get my new build up and running and this was the lowest priced, best brand I could find. </s>
<s> I paid $47 for it. </s>
<s> You can certainly find a less costly card, and other components but, I listed what I would buy for myself. </s>
<s> In fact, Gigabyte has a 6600GT at Newegg for $119. </s>
<s> Hey thanks again for all the info. </s>
<s> Are you sure the only make a 128MB 6600GT as I've found a 256MB card made by Gigabyte: http://www.ascent.co.nz/ProductSpecification.aspx?ItemID=342258 Is this right? </s>
<s> with nothing. </s>
<s> I, then, did a Google on the model number of that card you found and came up with a number of New Zealand web sites. </s>
<s> So, apparently, it is a NZ card and not available here in USA. </s>
<s> If it serves your purpose, go for it. </s>
<s> The more memory the better. </s>
<s> But I noticed those prices and was shocked. </s>
<s> I don't think that, for the cost, 256MB of memory is worth it. </s>
<s> here's a link to a USA available 256MB 6600GT: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=322300 </s>
<s> Assuming you have a monitor/keyboard/mouse/speakers/printer and don't need a floppy or media-card reader. </s>
<s> I suggest the following Case-$100? </s>
<s> PSU-$50 Windows XP Home-90 Arctic Silver Thermal Compound-$8 AMD Athlon 64 3200+-$142 1GB DDR PC3200RAM (CorsairValue)-$90 250GB Hard Drive SATA-$110 Evga 6800GS-$210 Sound Blaster Xi-Fi Extreme Music-$122 MSI or Gigabyte Motherboard Nforce4 Non-SLI-90 NEC 3550-A DL DVD+_RW Burner-40 TOtal= ~1000. </s>
<s> sUGGESTED UPGRADES WOULD BE maybe dual-core X2 3800+, 7800GT, Sli motherboard 2GB ram, and maybe an additonal dvd-rom. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> &quot;I was probably just looking at a single card at the moment and was seriously looking at the 6600 GT. </s>
<s> I'm in New Zealand so prices are a little higher than in the US.&quot; I see. </s>
<s> If it is anything like Bermuda or the Bahamas, I'm sure that you would pay rather nasty tarrifs in exchange for your view. </s>
<s> Do you have to buy from a NZ company, or can your purcahse from an American one and pay import duties? </s>
<s> &quot; was hoping for at least 200GB hard drive and at least 1GB RAM - what brand do you recommend for RAM? </s>
<s> will I need DDR2? </s>
<s> &quot; The Maxtor Maxline III 200 GB and Seagate 7200.8 are good drives. </s>
<s> Samsung drives are a bit slower, but are quieter. </s>
<s> The current AMD processors do not support DDR-2 memory. </s>
<s> Besides the combined access speed of these tend to be higher (ie worse) than with DDR memory. </s>
<s> Any decent RAM with a CAS of 3-3-3-6 or better is fine. </s>
<s> Damastar55r had a pretty good list of components. </s>
<s> &quot;Case-$100? </s>
<s> PSU-$50 Windows XP Home-90 Arctic Silver Thermal Compound-$8 AMD Athlon 64 3200+-$142 1GB DDR PC3200RAM (CorsairValue)-$90 250GB Hard Drive SATA-$110 Evga 6800GS-$210 Sound Blaster Xi-Fi Extreme Music-$122 MSI or Gigabyte Motherboard Nforce4 Non-SLI-90 NEC 3550-A DL DVD+_RW Burner-40&quot; However, since you want a quiet system, I suggest the Antec Sonata II as a case. </s>
<s> In the states you can get one with a 480 watt PSU for about $110. </s>
<s> Unless you are mixing music, I see no reason to have a sound card. </s>
<s> NForce 4 motherboards have 7.1 sound. </s>
<s> EVGA, Foxconn, and Asus are also good motherboard manufacturers. </s>
<s> I would suggest that you get an AMD Athlon 64 4000, which runs for about $330 in the US. </s>
<s> It is the fastest non FX chip. </s>
<s> Thanks for all the info. </s>
