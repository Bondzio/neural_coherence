Hi - When I first bought my 100gb maxtor external hard drive for my desktop dell, I plugged it in, set it up correctly, but couldn't locate it.
After researching I found on this site, a link I followed that I think (I can't really remember) I downloaded something wich located this new drive.
I just moved my room around, unplugging everything, and now I again, can't locate my drive.
I don't want to reformat it b/c I have everything saved on it.
Can anyone help me locate it again?
Thanks - Al
