1.1.4	I insert a blank CD-R into the DVD/CD writable drive on my Dell desktop computer .	St
1.1.5	I have XP on my desktop .	St
1.1.6	I format the blank CD-R and , using Windows Explorer , I drag files on to the CD .	St
1.1.7	Computer spends several minutes 'burning ' the CD .	St
1.1.8	Before ejecting the CD , I right-click on it in Explorer and select & quot ; Make Compatible. & quot ; It spends a minute or so doing this and then ejects the CD .	St
1.1.9	I take the CD to my notebook computer , which has Vista on it .	St
1.1.10	I insert it and a Windows box pops-up which shows the CD , but says that there are no files on it .	St
1.1.11	I 've taken the CD back to my desktop computer and opened it on both of my CD drives with no problem .	St
1.1.12	The files are visible and they open just fine with no errors .	St
1.1.13	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.2.1	I decline to write why but share that if you did n't bother with the format , drag , make compatible and used most CD recording software such as CDBURNERXP it would work fine .	St
1.2.2	Your method is known to fail .	St

1.5.2	What step ( s ) of my process are contributing to the issues I 'm experience ?	Ques

1.8.1	& quot ; CD recording software such as CDBURNERXP it would work fine. & quot ; Sorry you feel slighted .	St
1.8.2	But in my first reply is the software ( free even ) that could get this job done .	St
1.8.3	Again , I feel if you do n't read the replies what good will it do to repeat the answer ?	Ques
