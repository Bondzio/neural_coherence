<s> Hi all, A guy I work with asked me to help him out. </s>
<s> His hard drive seems to have some bad sectors and he has lost some of his data. </s>
<s> He has since bought a new machine, and I have the HDD to see if I can retrieve anything. </s>
<s> What he told me was that at the point of failure, his data was lost, but his wife's data was still accessible on the same drive. </s>
<s> The drive has not been partitioned. </s>
<s> Is there anyway to retrieve the data? </s>
<s> I have not yet plugged it into my machine to check but thought I would submit a post in the meantime. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated!! </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Look up PC FILE INSPECTOR on google.com. </s>
<s> DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE REPAIR TOOLS on that drive. </s>
<s> You don't want to boot it or write to it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ...for the help with this problem as well Bob! </s>
<s> Cheers! </s>
