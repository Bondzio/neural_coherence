Ever so often the pointer onscreen locks up and will not move. The keyboard work and I am able to restart the computer, which resets the pointer, but after a few hour and in the middle of a game or program, the pointer will lock up again. I've downloaded the updated software from the Microsoft web site and the problem remains. Anyone know what the problem is and how to fix it or do I need to buy a new mouse?

Maybe a simple cleaning of compents(blow it out) will help. A possible system case fan may have failed unknown to you, so inspect *all* fans and such. You can also, just walk away from the system and see if the mouse unfreezes. If it unfreezes, then its doing something in the bkgrd. and temporary sucks the resources at that time, use you anti-virus scanner and/or trojan scanner to best handle any malware at work. Understand also overtime, things get clogged system wise, thus abit of house cleaning maybe in order, review all pgms, to keep or remove. Look into the above or get back with your results. good luck -----Willy
