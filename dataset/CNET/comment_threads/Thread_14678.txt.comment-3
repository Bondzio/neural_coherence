Some print servers just don't work with certain printers.
I was trying to find the HL-5140 on a list of printers known to be comaptible (or incompatible) with particular print servers.
I haven't done a comprehensive search, but I didn't see it on any list one way or the other.
SUGGESTION FOR coolanticool: you might want to contact the major mfgs.
(Linksys, Belkin, D-link, Netgear, etc.)
and ask them which of their print servers will support the HL-5140.
