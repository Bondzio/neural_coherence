Are you using a hub? Lexmark warns that sometimes that will cause problems, and you should go directly into the computer. Do you have any other USB devices connected? If so, try it with them all disconnected. Have you searched the knowledbebase for &quot;no connection&quot; at the Lexmark site ? Hope this helps. Frank
