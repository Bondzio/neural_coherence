OK, question is video cards. I don't remember seeing this as a discussion. My current card is a ATI Radeon HD 4300/4500 Series. Computer is a Dell 546 with AMD Athlon II 4x 620 Processor with 4 gigs ram. I run Win 7. This is for the people who like details. So I play WOW and Skyrim and all was fine till a few weeks ago. It plays fine on my laptop and on an old XP I have but I get these great pie shaped slices throughout the screen on the Dell. AMD Catalyst did download a new OS 12.3 and if memory serves me right is was about then the problems started. I don't know how to roll back to the previous version and the other thing is this only happens on this computer. I pulled the card and put it into my XP and it seemed to run fine. No pies or patches on the faces of the characters. I put it back into this machine and it happens again. So my thoughts are: 1. The Dell machine puts too much into the card and it starts to not work, overheats or something 2. The OS from Catalyst is the problem. Responses I think would help is how to roll back Catalyst or can I dump that video software and run something else? If so, how to dump it? Any other suggestions appreciated. I am thinking of building a gaming computer, if so, what graphic card is coming up with good marks nowadays? Thanks

After over a decade, you still see issues like this. Sorry, it's an area that the consumer may have to vote by returning products that don't work or require ARCANE steps and driver hunts. Bob

Went to Youtube and did a search on uninstall all ATI programs Did that and my video worked again. I don't know the fault ATI and Catalyst had but now I have great 1280 x 800 video and all games look good again, Happy camper,
