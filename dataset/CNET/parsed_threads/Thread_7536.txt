<s> I decided to upgrade my ancient dual Pentium Pro 200mhz Socket 8 system to a faster speed. </s>
<s> The way I chose to do it was by acquiring two Pentium II Overdrive Processors(PODP66X333 SL2KE). </s>
<s> These Overdrive Processors will effectively raise the speed of my system from 200mhz to 333mhz. </s>
<s> The problem I'm having is that the Processors did not come with Heatsinks and Fans. </s>
<s> I've searched ebay, spoken to a rep from Sanyo-Denki, and Googled till I'm about to Girgle. </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> I'm including the following link which shows a really good image of the Heatsink & Fan attached to the Processor. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> Because, you're dealing with a dated product, you have to hunt the dickens to find anything. </s>
<s> Won't the 200Mhz fans work? </s>
<s> Find some typical fans than have 3-ear mounting brackets. </s>
<s> Aren't there any used outlets in your area? </s>
<s> Here's a outlet center than may help or not: http://www.allelectronics.com/ -OR- similar websites, used, off-lease returns, etc. </s>
<s> Also, check with modding websites that custom fit all sorts of items. </s>
<s> Query there and maybe follow-up on some links they provides. </s>
<s> Here's a quick modder link: http://www.overclockers.com tada -----Willy </s>
<s> The fans are attached and ready to use from Intel. </s>
<s> You didn't need to find fans. </s>
<s> But do try 1coolpc.com if you do happen to get such without the nice Intel fan. </s>
