My computer is an HP Pavillion 7950 and the system board is M6TBA but I cannot find drivers to fix my problem. I have uninstalled the device but it cannot find on my PC, internet what it is looking for. I have a fiberoptic DSL connection. Can someone help?

This is a Slot 1 board made 1999 or prior so support may be non-existant and frankly the owner should have become familiar with it and collected drivers over the past 4 years. http://www.biostar.com.tw/support/manual/archives.php3 and fetching the manual shows that no onboard LAN was supplied. You'll have to identify your network card and fetch drivers, but if it's fried, GO SHOPPING. Last week found these cards new for five dollars. Bob
