Frank, FYI, I have a Perly's Road Map CD which normally requires the CD to be in the CD-ROM drive when searching for the road maps.
I didn't have to create another partition to do what you did.
I simply copy the contents to the Perly's Folder on the C Drive and there after it works without the need for the CD.
Cheers.
