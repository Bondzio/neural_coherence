There are lots of printers out there, Hewlitt Packard, Canon, Epson and more.
Go to a box store and check them out most have card slots for the camera cards and pic bridge capability so that you can just plug the camera link cable in and print from that.
The all in ones are neat also, print, scan and copy and are not that expensive comparitively.
As I said go to a box store and take your pick, good luck!
