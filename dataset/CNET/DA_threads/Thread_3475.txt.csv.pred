1.1.1	Can I put 667 Mhz memory cards with 533 Mhz or do they all have to have the samebus width?	St
1.2.1	Memory should all be the same speed and if possible same size, make and model.	St
1.2.2	Put the fastest you can in.	St
1.2.3	But 667 may not work correctly or cause errors in a 533 motherboard.	St
1.2.4	It might &quot;underclock&quot;.	St
1.2.5	I know memory will lower the clock of the fastest cards to the lowest.	St
1.2.6	For example, if you put in a 512 of 533 and a 512 of 667, the 667 will clock itself down to 533, making the extra few bucks getting 667 spent gone.	St
1.2.7	I may be confusing myself, are you talking about Memory and FSB?	St
1.2.8	Don't think so, but making sure.	St
