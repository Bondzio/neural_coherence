This is a regular complaint -- but the upside is that their user forum at www.netgear.com has to be pretty good and one of the moderators uses Macs.
Incidentally I've had problems connecting a friend's Mac laptop and desktop to two different routers (Zoom 802.11B, D-Link 802.11G).
The laptop would connect to the Zoom but not the DLink and the Desktop would only connect to the DLink.
Maybe something to do with WEP vs WPA -- we spent a week on this and gave up on the laptop.
I suspect Apple want you to buy their router.
