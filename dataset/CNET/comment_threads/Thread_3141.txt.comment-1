Hi everyone!
I'm having a problem with my speakers, which are Altec Lansing ACS295 speakers with 2 satellites and one big subwoofer.
The problem is that they are making strange sounds -- not like static, because if that were the case I would know the speakers are blown, it's happened to me before.
The noise is more like someone blowing into a microphone or tapping a microphone that's plugged in to a speaker so you can hear it, and it happens repeatedly.
Also, I don't need to be sending any sound to the speakers and they will still do it if they have power -- I can even remove the input cable from the cable, and as long as they are plugged in, they make these noises.
I've noticed that the subwoofer makes more of a &quot;tapping on a microphone&quot; kind of a sound, and the left satellite makes louder sounds like blowing into a microphone.
Actually, the subwoofer kind of sounds like when you are adjusting the cable to a speaker, but I checked all the cables and they're all in good condition and plugged in fine.
I haven't played music on these speakers too loudly, and they're good quality speakers anyway.
Any way to fix this?
