<s> Suddenly, for no apparent reason, neither the wired or wireless ethernet cards in my XP PC will acquire a network address. </s>
<s> It will go through the motions of acquiring an address forever, without actually doing so. </s>
<s> If I try ipconfig /release at a command prompt I get the message that the media is disconnected and consequently cannot release or renew the ip address. </s>
<s> I cannot repair the network connection either. </s>
<s> The Windows Firewall is turned off, and virus scans turned up nothing. </s>
<s> I find it hard to believe that both ethernet cards have gone bad at the same time. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any ideas as to the cause of this problem? </s>

<s> ...I managed to fix the problem. </s>
<s> The Event Viewer listed the error as the DHCP client not starting, hence the PC could not receive an IP address from the DHCP server. </s>
<s> The DHCP client service would not start manually, giving me another error message that it was dependent on the SYMTDI service which failed to start as well. </s>
<s> Checking the list of services, there was no SYMTDI service listed! </s>
<s> Further investigation revealed that this service was a leftover from un-installing Norton Anti-Virus! </s>
<s> What a pain! </s>
<s> NAV is so insidious! </s>
<s> Thanks for your suggestion. </s>
<s> All is well now... </s>
<s> Hi. </s>
<s> I'm having similar problems to what you were having in terms of acquiring network address. </s>
<s> What is EventViewer and how would I access this? </s>
<s> Any more details on what you did to resolve this problem would be GREATLY appreciated! </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
