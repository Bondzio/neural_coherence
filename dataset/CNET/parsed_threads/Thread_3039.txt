<s> Router questions If I were to purchase a wireless router, (those I've seen have several Lan ports), could I connect my DSL modem via the Wan port and my PC via 1 of these ports to utilise the router as a another security measure? </s>
<s> Also if that is feasible am I putting data RF out? </s>
<s> Do you see what I am asking? </s>
<s> Wireless routers are prevelant, but I would still use the router as a wired PC. </s>

<s> How do I determine if a certain wireless model has options to block the wireless broadcast of my in & out internet communications? </s>

<s> but then you need to configure it to use the security, such as: Wpa, Wpa2 or WEP and change the default SSID, then you need to use MAC Address filtering to make your network secure. </s>
<s> In Short, eventhough you don't need the wireless, you still have to configure it anyway. </s>
<s> ...firmware versions that allow the network administrator to disable the wireless ability of the router (more than just turning off the SSID broadcast). </s>
