1.1.1	I needed this question answered and I did n't really know any where else to ask .	St
1.1.2	I know that most of you probably do n't have more than one wireless N router , but based on range alone , which router , the Linksys WRT150N or the TP-LINK TL-WR951ND is better ?	Ques
1.1.3	I would tend to lean toward the Linksys just because of the band but in the review there was no mention of range and in the TP-LINK 's review it said it had pretty good range .	St
1.1.4	Thanks for your time .	St
1.2.1	http : //reviews.cnet.com/routers/tp-link-tl-wr941nd/4505-3319_7-33178398.html Sorry but I did n't find the newer model so I 'll just write I 'll stick with Linksys , Netgear and Dlink any day .	St
