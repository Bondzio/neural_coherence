Here are the facts: 1. My DSL modem is ALSO a router, with only 1 Ethernet port. It's this one: http://www.qwest.com/dslhelp/modems/index.html 2 My main computer is a PC with Windows 98SE, and I installed a PCI card + cable to be able to hook it up to the modem. 3. My other computer is a notebook Windows XP. The internert wireless connection works great. So how do I go about setting up a home network? Get a small router with 4 ports, and hook it up to the modem, scanner, printer? Any advice is HIGHLY appreciated !! Aude-Noelle

The rest is: 1) Workgroup name the same 2) File and Print sharing enabled 3) Firewalls disabled until the network is established 4) Some folders are set to be shared. 5) Additional PCs can be added wirelessly or wired with a switch. Scanners do not usually share.

XP will walk you through most of it. It will then give you directions on how to do the same for your pc because you are running 98se you will need to follow the direction from XP (because of different file formats)so the machines can share information. Once that is done it will let you set up each device to share with the each other. You can always decide what you want to share by right clicking the device and select Sharing(after you set the network up)

Since I'll be switching my old PC desktop to a Mac soon (I'm a graphic designer, that's why !), I can figure it out then. Best, Aude

Just because your desktop is next to your router doesn't make it the main unit. While our network now is 3 computers running XP, a short time ago we had Windows 98SE, Windows ME and Windows XP computers all connected. On your laptop, when you run the XP disk to setup your network, it will offer you a chance to create a network setup disk to run on your &quot;main&quot; unit running Windows 98. I think it even offers you a choice of using your XP CD to setup your network software on your other computer(s).
