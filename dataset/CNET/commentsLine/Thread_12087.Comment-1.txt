i am running an hp jetdirect 170x with a hp designjet 500 connected to it via parallel port.
i am running a windows server 2003 server and active directory with over 100 computers running windows xp pro sp2.
only one computer is able to print to this printer.
i have installed this printer on other computers with seemingly the same configuration; however i cannot get any of the other computers on the network to print to this printer.
from any computer on the network, i am able to ping this device and get a postive reply.
i am also able to telnet and access the web-based manager from any computer.
i have done everything i could think of to get this to work.
i even tried to install the dlc protocol on a computer, and nothing works.
i appreciate any ideas and help provided.
