ok, let me see if i understand.
you are saying that if i use the wifiranger, since it is a router it will act as a firewall even though it does not have nat.
if i am right nat is what is usually what a router has when they say it has a built in firewall, i can not remember what it stands for but it seems i remember it checks incoming packets or something like that.
so if i use the wifiranger, i should not worry, right?
what about only using the hotspot, are you saying it is also like a router and gives protection?
sorry just learning about all this, if it seems i am not picking this up quick.
thanks for your reply sly
