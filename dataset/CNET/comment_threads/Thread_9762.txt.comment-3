Thnx for ur reply I think u r asking me to refer to the open source WEP cracking stuff.
Is there a direct vbscript or any other program sources available for listing the STA's under an SSID like a vbscript that i've got for listing the AP's.
I mean to ask is there any official and diplomatic way in knowing the STA's without using the hacking and cracking stuff....
Hoping for ur reply.... Baskaran
