Hi.
What kind of P5LP-LE motherboard are you running a core 2 on?
I have a P5LP-LE (Lithium) HP name Lithium-UL8E.
http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00379616&lc=en&cc=se&product=1155970&dlc=sv&lang=sv According to specification, it does not support core 2.
But the latest bios update adds cpu support - but hp doesn't tell which cpu:s. http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=pv-34940-4&lc=en&cc=se&dlc=sv&product=1155970&os=228&lang=sv I want to upgrade my old P4 650 Prescott 3.4 Ghz, but can't find out which cpus that are actually supported.
Help would be appriciated.
