<s> I've got a couple of related questions. </s>
<s> Right now I'm using an unpartitioned hard drive in my PC. </s>
<s> I'd like to add a second drive and turn them into a RAID1 array (I hope I'm phrasing that correctly) and I'd also like to partition the drive (using Partition Magic), but I don't want to lose any data. </s>
<s> Do I need to partition the original drive before I set up the RAID array? </s>
<s> Do I need to set up a matching partition on the second drive, or will that be taken care of automatically? </s>
<s> Does it matter? </s>
<s> Also, do I need to reformat the original drive in order to set up the RAID array? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Mirroring. </s>
<s> See http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/perf/raid/levels/singleLevel1-c.html You may be lost from the beginning since you mention Partition Magic which would NEVER be used in a RAID 1 setup. </s>
<s> You didn't supply what RAID hardware you have or what OS you have that supports RAID 1 so I'm left to guess that we are working with the most common setup. </s>
<s> Here's a link about XP Pro's RAID 1 with IDE drives. </s>

<s> Not good. </s>
<s> After 2 decades of watching people with various RAID systems, RAID 1 never paid off. </s>
<s> The most common damage to the system was the DELETE KEY. </s>
<s> The damage was mirrored to the other drive and that was that. </s>
<s> Same story for corrupted files, virus, trojan and malware. </s>
<s> -&gt; Never in 20 years did RAID 1 save anyone I know. </s>
<s> RAID 0 paid off for those that wanted speed, and RAID 5 for those that wanted better hardware reliability. </s>
<s> Many attempt RAID because they are under the impression it will save them from performing a backup. </s>
<s> The lesson about backup appears to be one that many will learn firsthand. </s>
