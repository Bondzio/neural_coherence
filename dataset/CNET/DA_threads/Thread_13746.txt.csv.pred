1.1.1	Greetings, I am having two issues: 1) When I power on....the system repeatedly goes off then back on (maybe even 6-9 x's) then it stays on with no problem.	St
1.1.2	I am using a rather large 1000 watt power supply.	St
1.1.3	Could this be a possible BIOS power issue?	St
1.1.4	Single rail PSU adjusting voltage?	St
1.1.5	MOBO protecting itself due to to much power?	St
1.1.6	What is strange is that I had the exact same problem so I returned all the products thinking something was defective....now the exact same problem.....something possibly is not compatible.	St
1.1.7	Symptoms appear to be a short but I dont think it is.	St
1.1.8	I carefully put all motherboard off sets from the case and did not overtighten any screws.	St
1.1.9	When the power goes off and on....everything lights up....fans kick on....led's light up.....then bam off for about 1 second on for like 4 then off for 1 .....happens again and again...... 2) Graphics card is receiving power because I see the lights.....but monitor remains black.	St
1.1.10	Mointor will not detect the card whatsoever.	St
1.1.11	I checked the obvious power to the monitor..etc...etc... Im a one desperate frustrated NOOB!	St
1.1.12	I want to diagnose this power issue first.	St
1.1.13	I listed my Hardware below.	St

1.2.1	just kill you if you took the bunch of stuff to a computer shop and have it professionally troubleshot?	St
1.2.2	And you gain something out of it?	St
1.2.3	It can't be a money issue and what better way is there to learn?	St
1.3.1	disconnect everything.	St
1.3.2	connect the power supply to the mobo.	St
1.3.3	connect the cpu cooler to the mobo.	St
1.3.4	connect the optical drive only.	St
1.3.5	install 1 stick of ram.	St
1.3.6	if you have access to a pci-based video card, use it instead of the gx2.	St
1.3.7	if you must use the gx2, make sure you're using an 8pin and a 6pin power connector since two 6pin connectors won't work.	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	You tried it in 32-bit Vista or 32-bit XP?	St
1.5.2	You used just one stick of RAM?	St
1.5.3	You have the latest BIOS, firmwares, drivers or asked each maker which version they suggest?	St
1.5.4	You have an install procedure such as http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7587_102-0.html?forumID=69&threadID=271360&messageID=2699006#2699006 where we have our dozen drivers and follow the install to the t. Bob	St
1.6.1	RAM -- CORSAIR DOMINATOR 4GB (2 x 2GB) 240-Pin DDR2 SDRAM DDR2 1066 (PC2 8500) Dual Channel MOBO -- ASUS M3N-HT DELUXE/MEMPIPE AM2+/AM2 NVIDIA nForce 780a SLI HDMI ATX AMD Motherboard CPU -- AMD Phenom 9850 BLACK EDITION 2.5GHz Socket AM2+ 125W Quad-Core Does this sound like a compatability issue between RAM/MOBO/CPU?	St
1.6.2	Im not experienced enought to know whether the three components above will jive.	St
1.6.3	Could this be incompatible RAM with MOBO?	St
1.6.4	RedTail	St
1.7.1	Sorry I see my advice is not usable here.	St
1.7.2	I'd ask the makers, suppliers to tell you what to try or do next.	Sug
1.7.3	Bob	St
1.8.1	Im at work presently and do have access to the forum but not the computer....hmmmm....just wandering if anybody knew before I get home and continue to diagnose?	St
1.8.2	Red	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
1.10.1	Those 4 items are what I do when I see a cranky machine.	St
1.10.2	I forgot one item and that is to leave the case cover off however some will rail against that and write &quot;the temperatures are ok.&quot; Again, you may be passing up the usuals.	St
1.10.3	Bob	St
1.11.1	If the &quot;screen remains black&quot; then we're apparently not getting past POST.	St
1.11.2	Doesn't sound like PSU problem (brand new and plenty of headroom).	St
1.11.3	RAM that doesn't work with the mobo would be consistent with the symptoms, but ramarc is saying the RAM is compatible.	St
1.11.4	So go thru the rest of the list: CPU, mobo, or RAM is faulty, or things aren't plugged in correctly.	Sug
1.11.5	I'll reinforce the suggestion of taking it to a local shop.	St
1.11.6	There they'll be able to quickly test the components, and verify the assembly.	St
1.11.7	One of the smaller shops in my town I know would let you hover and learn while they work, particularly if you came during a slower time (mid-day weekday).	St
1.12.1	Aint this some &quot;YOU KNOW WHAT&quot; This is directly off of ASUS website --- apparently a bios issue between my board and the amd 9850: 0901 2008/05/29 update Description 0901 BIOS 1.Fix the problem that CrashFree function is abnormal sometimes.	St
1.12.2	2.Fix the problem that it may takes 4 to 8 times of cold boot to enter OS with Phenom 9850 and 9950 CPUs.	St
1.12.3	3.Fix the problem that the chassis fan will suddenly stop.	St
1.12.4	File Size 745.33 (KBytes) So.....I call and get a extremely rude tech from ASUS....he said there is no way that I can update that bios myself.	St
1.12.5	I will have to call tommorow to order a updated cmos chip.	St
1.12.6	What a drag.	St
1.12.7	Dont even know if I believe him cuz he was such a jerk.	St
1.12.8	System will stay on after about 9 off an on's....I feel like im gonna blow something at the number of offs and ons im going through.	St
1.12.9	Computer is not posting, no beeps, no video.	St
1.12.10	WOW........tempted to just return the board and cpu again.	St
1.12.11	Hate to do that though but jeezamoley.	St
1.12.12	No way its a short now......A bios that would not even allow the system to boot was the last thing on my mind.	St
1.12.13	I kept thinking that this was a component that was not installed right.	St
1.12.14	Just dang sick.	St
1.12.15	Hopefully if someone out there happens to run in this issue...maybe our post would help them.	St
1.12.16	RedTail	St
1.13.1	Greetings, After some long hard work and help from the forums.....I have the box up and running.	St
1.13.2	The board was not compatible with the cpu until a bios update was performed.	St
1.13.3	I found a old am2 sempron, threw it in....then updated the bios....then all power issues were resolved with the 9850.	St
1.13.4	Also, the ram was a problem, would not boot with that Corsair.	St
1.13.5	So....bottom line is that I had two issue going on.	St
1.13.6	Tons of work was done thinking that this was a short or connection...etc..etc...for all the newbs out there wanting to build....DONT GIVE UP....KEEP DIGING.	St
1.13.7	The payoff of building your own system compared to buying .... is infinite...money and performance wise.	St
1.13.8	The only issue that im having now is the board sees one type of hdd but not another....another post is inevitable but im certainly getting there with everyones help.	St
1.13.9	thanks, RedTail	St
1.14.1	I GOT IT ....	St
1.14.2	Here is what I did.... 1.	St
1.14.3	Download the 901 bios from asus and put it on a flash drive from another pc, to be safe I had the zip file, the unzipped directory, and the 901.bin file all on the root since I didnt know which one it would recognize.	St
1.14.4	2.	St
1.14.5	Remove the 2 sticks of ram in the black slots, leaving only the 2 in the yellow slots.	St
1.14.6	3.	St
1.14.7	Start the machine, it should post and let you enter the bios.	Sug
1.14.8	4.	St
1.14.9	Go to the ez-Flash utility in the bios, and flash it to 901 from the USB drive.	St
1.14.10	5.	St
1.14.11	Restart, enter the bios, and under chipset uptions change the voltage of the ram to 2.1, and the speed to 800mhz.	St
1.14.12	6.Shut down, install the 2 sticks of ram that you removed, It should now boot and allow you to install the O.S.	St
1.14.13	7.	St
1.14.14	After you have the O.S.	St
1.14.15	(xp64 for me) installed, and all of the service packs installed, you can now go back and increase the ram speed to 1066mhz....	St
1.14.16	This is step by step how I got it to work...	St
1.14.17	I will check back to see if anyone hase any questions.	St
1.14.18	Good luck,	St
