my husband and i recently purchased an hp j3680 all-in-one.
shortly thereafter, we both purchased laptops.
obviously, if we would have known we were buying laptops, we would have purchased a printer with a wireless card.
a rep on the live chat with hp tells me that the j3680 is not bluetooth compatible, but i'm not sure i trust him/her - they seemed to have a poor grasp on what i was asking.
my question is two-fold: a) is the j3680 bluetooth enabled?
and if not, b) is there an wireless printer adapter out there that we can get to be able to print to the j3680 without physically connecting the usb cord to our laptops?
