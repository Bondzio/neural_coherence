Also, the BIOS has the option to change the voltage. Right now it is on AUTO, but i have heard that you also need to up the voltage if you overclock...will AUTO take care of that or not? Thanks in advance. -Zak- ----- Intel Core 2 Duo 6300 @2.14 GHz 2 GB DDR2 Western Digital SATA 250GB Hard Drive NVidia Geforce 7600 GT 256MB GDDR Windows XP 19&quot; LCD Display Battlefield 2

You can easily overclock this processor merely by raising the FSB and adding a tenth of a volt to the core to aid stability (you'll need to switch out of AUTO). Make sure the RAM and FSB are unlinked so you don't overclock the RAM when upping the FSB. Best to overclock in small increments, run something like Prime95 to check for stability, and keep an eye on the temps.

One thing they say about Bios, it does not lie. I reboot and go to Bios to check my temp. Motherboard Monitor is a good software to check your system. http://www.download.com/Motherboard-Monitor/3000-2086_4-10518385.html?tag=lst-0-1 Make upgrade your cooling system, That is why I never overclocked I like to stay on the safe side. If you fry your CPU Intel may not cover it under the Warranty. Good Luck: Wendell H
