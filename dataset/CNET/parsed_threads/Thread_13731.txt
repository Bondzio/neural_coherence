<s> I hope this is the right forum for this question & please forgive the fact that I KNOW NOT of what I post..... Sys Info In Profile. </s>
<s> Internet via Cable modem with d-link hard wired router. </s>
<s> Basically I have a 2 computer set-up at home. </s>
<s> 1)XPPRO SP1/ Intel p4 Desktop with Intel Pro 100 VE network connection. </s>
<s> This is Master machine and is working fine, normal behavior in all aspects. </s>
<s> When I connect to my LAN connection to go on net, it takes less than 10 seconds and says enabled at 10 MBps. </s>
<s> This is what it's always said. </s>
<s> It shares router with only 2) HP Laptop DV 110ca Celeron 1.6 which recently has has software problems (conflicts between AVG AV & Spybot & AdawareSE protectors. </s>
<s> I finally have that straightened out & have got working. </s>
<s> Ended up with sys restore back 1 month & new install of AAW. </s>
<s> Conflict appears to have involved latest engine update to #446. </s>
<s> Have gone back to #441 and all seems well except.... </s>
<s> Normally when I connect to LAN with laptop, to go on net, connection takes about 10 seconds and (if I'm not mistaken) also was connected @ 10MBps. </s>
<s> Worked just fine. </s>
<s> I have used the right click &quot;repair connect&quot; function several times to solve this but it reports OK as at that point I am connected. </s>
<s> It says repair successful and contact Admin (me) for further help! </s>
<s> Normally, if I click the repair, it just says repair completed but NOW it pops up a box showing the steps it is taking :4 or 5 items. </s>
<s> Don't know if this is a hint for you. </s>
<s> NOW when I connect, it takes up to a minute + and shows connected @100.0 MBps!!! </s>
<s> I often think it's &quot;hung&quot; and right click to &quot;enable&quot; and get reply &quot;connection attempt is already in progress&quot; and when I click OK the connection opens instantly (at 100.0MBps). </s>
<s> I believe this to be problem source. </s>
<s> When I go to CP&gt;Network connections on Laptop, it has 3 connections (but I have disabled all but LAN). </s>
<s> This shows Realtek as source of connection & When I look further properties&gt;advanced&gt;config for link speed/duplex, I see the enabled is auto negotiate (apparently @ 100.0 MBps) I also see offered various half-duplex/full duplex at 10.0 MBps and suspect one of those is the formerly correct one. </s>
<s> The router is set up as Duplex mode if I recall d-links support comment from 1 year ago. </s>
<s> When I try to check on Desktop Computer what it would show (as a hint), when I click Configure on the Intel VE 100, I get message: &quot;You have made changes to this connection, I you proceed these changes will be lost! </s>
<s> Do you wish to proceed? </s>
<s> Having no idea what should be there, I of course click NO since it's working normally and don't want to compound what is now only the laptops problem. </s>
<s> It doesn't say what or WHEN the &quot;changes&quot; were done (certainly not by me. </s>
<s> I haven't changed anything there since initial set-up by pro's at install). </s>
<s> I guess the final question becomes: Given this set-up, what would seem to be the normal setting in the laptop for 10.0MBps that I should be seeing/using?? </s>
<s> Is there another route to take for this? </s>
<s> NOTE: When in same room as Desktop machine, Laptop's on battery as power supply is in living room and power bar is full already with main machine. </s>
<s> Sorry for length of post but tried to include as much as I thought helpful. </s>
<s> Ask for what else you need. </s>
<s> Thanks for patience & ideas! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> All laptops have a power saving mode that drops power on most peripherals when on battery power. </s>
<s> Lower power means slower speed. </s>
<s> What does it do when plugged into the power supply? </s>
<s> Normal setting should be &quot;Automatic&quot; or &quot;Autodetect.&quot; If that doesn't work, then select &quot;100Mbps.&quot; Make sure your router has the latest firmware version. </s>
<s> always been connected in the computer room for net use and always on battery power. </s>
<s> I have all the power saving features disabled as net work only takes max of 10-15 minutes (strictly updating protectors) all other times when active it's on power supply where ever. </s>
<s> I don't know if this is of interest as far as half/full duplex goes, but other than to share router to cable to net, the two machines do not inter-react with each other. </s>
<s> I don't transfer files or share printer etc. </s>
<s> In fact most of those abilities are disabled as best as I can for security reasons. </s>
<s> Any transfer is done via USB storage drives. </s>
<s> AV/AS scanned before transfer of course. </s>
<s> The funny part, I think, is that 'tho I sys restored back 1 month, one or 10 months ago the matter of the LAN net connection would have been the same (&lt;10 seconds at(?) </s>
<s> 10 mbps). </s>
<s> Perhaps it was 100 mbps & I never noticed but I certainly would have noticed this kind of slowness. </s>
<s> Laptop other functions seem at normal speeds and scans (perpetually) as clean of all malware. </s>
<s> I did do a &quot;compress old files&quot; via disk clean up about 2 weeks ago to gain back some HD space (gained about 8% to 63% free) along with defrag & checkdisk/ R for good measure. </s>
<s> Could the compress have included the LAN file since it hadn't changed in year? </s>
<s> Could this create slow down in enabling? </s>
<s> I appreciate your thoughts ! </s>
<s> Sandy </s>
<s> &quot;Auto Negotiate&quot; is the same as auto detect/ Automatic then I guess that setting is not likely the problem. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> when, on EITHER computer I click CP&gt;Network Connections&gt;My Network Places or View Work group, I have nothing in the responding screen. </s>
<s> To best of my knowledge, this has always been the case. </s>
<s> Thought it might make or clear some possible question. </s>
<s> to computer room, booted up on battery, plugged in the cable to the router and decided to update AVG,Spybot & AdawareSE and the connection started up PERFECTLY NORMALLY!!! </s>
<s> Now seems to be working exactly as it always has including &lt; 10 sec connection (@ 100.0 mbps thanks)! </s>
<s> Dam_ Wayne, your telepathic skills are amazing!!LOL! </s>
<s> Thanks to all for viewing & considering my plight! </s>
<s> Guess it's time to create a few more restore points! </s>
<s> Sandy </s>
<s> STEP ONE: Before you do anything else, make sure that you are using the latest network adapter driver and the router's firmware is the latest version. </s>
<s> STEP TWO: Did you take care of the driver and firmware yet? </s>
<s> HERE'S THE REST: If your router is capable of 100Mbps connections, then that's the connection speed you want to use. </s>
<s> Specifically, you want 100Mbps/full duplex. </s>
<s> I Googled your Intel network adapter on your desktop, and it comes up as a 10/100 model. </s>
<s> That means that it is capable of 10Mbps mode and also 100Mbps mode. </s>
<s> I will assume that your notebook also has a 10/100 network adapter (I couldn't find your model at HP.com). </s>
<s> In the properties for the network adapter, you can set the &quot;link speed&quot; to Autodetect. </s>
<s> That means that it will detect the router's max speed and try to match it. </s>
<s> If Autodetect doesn't get you the 100Mbps/full duplex connection that is desired, then you can try to force that connection speed by setting the link speed to &quot;100Mbps/full duplex&quot; instead of Autodetect. </s>
<s> Autonegotiate (different from Autodetect) may work, but it can be troublesome if the router also set to Autonegotiate, (and if it even supports it). </s>
<s> I'd avoid Autonegotiate for now. </s>
<s> Note that a poor quality or damaged network cable can cause a 100Mbps connection to downgrade to 10Mbps. </s>
<s> Try a different network cable--one that is known to be good. </s>
<s> Other issues can cause problems, but I think that you now have enough settings play with at this point. </s>
<s> Lots of useful information. </s>
<s> Since problem seemed to have solved itself (I can't believe I've had anything to do with it), I'm going to save your post to a text file in my Fix & Clean Computer file for future reference. </s>
<s> Very good to have. </s>
<s> Strangely(? </s>
<s> ), I don't have an &quot;auto detect&quot; or &quot;Automatic&quot; offered in the drop down list of options ONLY &quot;auto-negotiate&quot; (probably a cheap import from Compaq used by HP since the take over). </s>
<s> Sorry about that: The HP is Model &quot;DV1010CA&quot;. </s>
<s> Canadian specific model. </s>
<s> Guess my eyes were overly tired or I'm just going blind (either is equally likely!). </s>
<s> Thanks again for the help! </s>
