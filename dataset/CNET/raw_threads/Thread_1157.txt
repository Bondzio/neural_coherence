I was wondering if anyone can tell me about the Internet services/connections in Europe, especifically in France. I want to get a laptop with a wireless card and ethernet/internet connection, but I don't know how their services and connections are. Can anyone help me? Thanks.

No. It's only good within a hundred feet of some access point. Just like where you are, it will be spotty. Bob

6	9	96692	1160729	1099032	Dick White	4/29/05 8:06 AM	1.11476196E12	the next question is a technical one...	which I don't know the answer to, having not been there or done that myself. Is USA wifi technical spec for radio channels, etc. (which are subject to U.S. FCC requirements) the same as in France (subject to their sovreign governmental regulations). In other words, will a wifi card in a laptop purchased in the USA connect successfully to an EU hotspot? Or will it be like FM radio where US stations are on the odd numbered decimals of the frequecy while EU (or is it UK) stations are on the even numbered decimals, so our &quot;standard&quot; radios don't work over there. One thing I've noticed when downloading firmware and drivers for wireless stuff is that some of it is region-specific. I guess, in the worst case, you'd have to buy a new PCCard wifi adapter that conforms to the local radio requirements when you get there. But it would be so much more convenient if US and EU radio specs were the same so the equipment would work on both sides of the big pond. dw

6	12	96692	1160792	1160764	Melati Hitam	4/29/05 8:34 AM	1.11476364E12	Precaution... on the power line voltage	USA using 110v... while many other use 220v. AND the powerline jack differences. So you still need to buy a power and jack converter..
6	13	96692	1160806	1160729	Melati Hitam	4/29/05 8:40 AM	1.114764E12	As for the file download region...	It because many product are sold only to specific country/region.. so its depends on your product Serial number.. it might also make you download locally,(supposedly) more faster. i.e some HP desktop that sold in Asia Pasific have something like 'AP' in the end of the product name...
