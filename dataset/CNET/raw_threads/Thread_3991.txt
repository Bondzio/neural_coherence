The fans along with the power supply are not working anymore. I just want to know if I need to worry about something like compatibility when it comes to buying a power supply for that computer or not.

If you search for power supply either on line or in a store, the model design for a standard desktop will be an AXT. Here is a link for newegg.com: http://www.newegg.com/Store/Category.aspx?Category=32&name=Power-Supplies In other words, they all have the same size dimensions and mounting holes. They will fit in almost any PC case. Yours is included. Here is a good one for your machine http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817371006

And again I have to hit it a bit to get it to work.

Besides, hitting it means there is a loose connection which causes extra resistance which causes heat which causes fire. Don't mess with it, replace it.
