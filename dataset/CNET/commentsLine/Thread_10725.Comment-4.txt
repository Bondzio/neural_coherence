sorry to take so long getting back to you, it took me a while to realise i had a reply/response, then another while to actually get around to reading it .
anyhow, my apologies for the long windedness of my post, i do tend to get carried away with my typing.
thank you very much for your answer/reply, i had been to that site allready, verified that i had done what it suggested, it did not help.
this evening i have only just a little while found the answer to my issue, and have posted it.
thanks again.
