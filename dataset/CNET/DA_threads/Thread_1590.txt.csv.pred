1.1.1	Another question for those in the know .	St
1.1.2	I presently have a new desktop PC which is connected to basic dial-up .	St
1.1.3	My father has now decided he wants a new computer .	St
1.1.4	My ISP is Bell South and Bell South tells me to have 2 PC 's in the same house using basic dial-up for internet service would require 2 separate phone lines in the house ; each phone line having it 's own basic dial-up account .	St
1.1.5	Bell South did tell me another choice that I would have is to keep just one phone line and I could connect both computers to that one phone line and use Bell South 's DSL high speed internet service .	St
1.1.6	Since there would be two computers on one phone line sharing the DSL Bell South recommended that I go with their mid level DSL service at $ 34.95 a month .	St
1.1.7	Now here 's where things start to get confusing ; Bell South says I 'd benefit from joining their home networking plan for an additional $ 5.00 a month but if I did I 'd also have to purchase a DSL modem ; a router ; and either a router adapter or a DSL adapter which would be connected to the second computer in the house .	St
1.1.8	My question is this .	St
1.1.9	Would it be more feasable for me to go with 2 separate phone lines having basic dial-up service on each phone line or to go as Bell South has recommended ; stay with one phone line ; go with their mid-level DSL plan which both computers could share after purchasing all of the required DSL equipment from Bell South to make everything work ?	Ques
1.1.10	Which way should I consider going ?	Ques
1.1.11	Feedback would certainly be appreciated on this one .	St
