1.1.1	I currently have the following: DSL modem connected to Netgear WGR614 g router with 2 computers on wired lan and 2 wireless computers connecting to the Netgear.	St
1.1.2	The Westell is in bridged/passthru mode and not routing.	St
1.1.3	I recently had to move the DSL and wired computers to a closed off room and now the wireless is horribly slow - I guess because of the interference from conduit, distance, etc.	St
1.1.4	The 2.4 phones an microwave also don't help any (who came up with 2.4 on all this stuff!!?).	St
1.1.5	Soooo, I would like to separate the wireless router from the DSL somehow.	St
1.1.6	I also require the wireless and wired computers to go thru a router.	St
1.1.7	I have a extra Buffalo G router and a simple 4-port hub.	St
1.1.8	The Buffalo has a Access Point capability.	St
1.1.9	Can I merely connect the Buffalo as Wireless access Point via a Cat5 cable and connect wirelessly either thru the Buffalo or the Netgear?	St
1.1.10	Or is it more complex than this.	St
1.1.11	Thanx, Jim	St

1.3.1	The Westell Modem/router(probably a 6100) uses the same ip address as the Netgear router.	St
1.3.2	Please read the Forum Sticky .	Sug
1.3.3	It will tell you how to change the Netgear router so everything works.	St
1.3.4	As for the 2.4gh cordless phones, yes they use the same frequencies as the wireless routers.	St
1.3.5	Rick	St
1.4.1	My Linksys WRT350-N died within warranty.	St
1.4.2	Since withdrawl is not in my things to tolerate I bought a D-link DIR-655 while waiting for the Linksys to be replaced.	St
1.4.3	Now I have two Gigabit/wireless N routers.	St
1.4.4	Was wondering how to do that.	Ques
1.4.5	Since I seem to collect PCs (I have five now) I may need extra ports.	St
1.4.6	Thanks Bob.	St
1.5.1	Stacking routers, hubs is a national pastime.	St
1.5.2	Bob	St
1.6.1	I might be better off with a switch.	St
1.7.1	The lights went out.	St
1.7.2	It's amazing how confabulated we must be.	Polite
1.8.1	I just bought this http://www.amazon.com/D-Link-DGS-2205-5-port-Desktop-Switch/dp/B000FIVDIA to go with my Gigabit router.	St
