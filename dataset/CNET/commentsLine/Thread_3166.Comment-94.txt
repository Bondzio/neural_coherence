hi everyone ok, so how many times should i backup?
one, three, ten?
this is a question i have often thought about.
what if the backup fails?
could this be armageddon?
the more times i backup,the longer it takes me, the more chances i have of losing the data and the hard drives.
realistically, what is reasonable?
how many copies of my hd should i have?
bemusedly yours, dave :os
