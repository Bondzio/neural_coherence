you should be ok with a 120gb hard drive or smaller.
the issue of hard drives larger than 137gb:   * * * * * your motherboard may not support newer ultra ata hard drives (ata/66/100/133), so you may have to add an ata/100/133 hard disk controller card to a pci slot.
something like one of these:  also, make sure you use an 80-wire (not 40 wire) ultra ata data cable.
see the pictures here:  * * * * * the maker of your new hd has a free utility to transfer the image of the old hd directly to the new one.
this is much quicker than reinstalling the os, drivers, os patches, software, and personal files.
however, if i haven't performed a fresh installation of everything in years, i like to take the opportunity of a new hd to do just that.
it eliminates a lot of junk and fixes corrupt system files.
remember to implement your plan to backup all important file to cd or dvd before you try any of these solutions.
