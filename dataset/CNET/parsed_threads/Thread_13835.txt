<s> I have an IDE HDD with an SATA DVD/RW and it takes about 5 mins to boot. </s>
<s> Once it finally boots everything runs as smooth as a baby's bottom. </s>
<s> But it just takes forever to boot up. </s>
<s> But when I unplug the SATA DVD rom and plug in a regular ide cd rom drive to the same cable as the HDD and set its jumper to slave it boots in seconds. </s>
<s> Is there maybe some setting I'm missing in my bios? </s>
<s> http://jackiesbar.com/GForce%20Bios.html GeForce 6100PM-M2 v2.0 Megatrends Bios v02.67 Thanks for any advice Beau </s>
<s> I've seen that for years. </s>
<s> And since the makers don't seem interested in issuing a BIOS or fix I use the drive that works best. </s>

<s> Well that's a bummer, I have all kinds of DVD burners that are SATA and all kinds of hard drives that are IDE. </s>
<s> I guess I'm going to have to invest in some IDE burners and/or some SATA hard drives. </s>
<s> Thanks Bob, Beau </s>
