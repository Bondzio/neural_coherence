i know this probably gets asked all the time, but i would really like some help with this... i'm looking to hopefully get a new desktop pc sometime soon, and i've just heard a few things that lead me to question just how much i really know about picking the right pc parts, so i thought i would ask around and get people's opinions on just what to look for.
i would like this new pc to be a great gaming rig, preferrably for the least amount of money.
i'm a fan of intel and nvidia, and i would really like this next pc to be able to run games in 3d and in 7.1 surround sound.
if possible, it should play games like witcher 2 (new, really awesome looking games) on max graphics, but i would also like to use it for star wars: the old republic (whenever it comes out).
it should be easily upgradable (should the need arise), and last as is for a while (i hesitate to use the term &quot;futureproof&quot;).
any ideas?
also, any recommendations on where to find a 3d monitor, and any recommendations on what customization site to go through?
or should i build it myself?
keep in mind, i am a beginner at all this.
thanks in advance, everyone!
!
