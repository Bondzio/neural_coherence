1.1.1	This is a bit confusing for me, but I'd like to use my iPhone 4s which has a 3g Verizon personal hotspot option on an iPad [wifi only] tablet for those times when I'm without wifi.	St
1.1.2	I've determined so far that the iPad would have to be a 3rd.	St
1.1.3	generation device for this to work, but would the iPhone and iPad then have to usb'd together, or on Bluetooth, or how exactly would this work?	St

1.5.3	Maybe they're just trying to upsell me?	St
1.5.4	Thanks	Polite
