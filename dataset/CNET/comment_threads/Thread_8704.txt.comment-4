You do need a good antenna,The ATI comes with a UHF antenna.
Since most HDTV stations are in the UHF band, a good UHF antenna.
How good depends on how far you are from the transmitters.
I live about 15 miles away and use an antenna that is good for 50 miles on regular tv and get good results most of the time.
At this point in time The ATI card drivers are still a work in progress, Works with XP ok, XPMCE however still leaves a lot to be desired.
The Hauupauge drivers are more stable.
