<s> So I have decided to buy my parents a new desktop for Christmas because they are in dire need of one, and cannot really afford it. </s>
<s> I am having trouble deciding on what brand to go with. </s>
<s> I used to think Dells were great. </s>
<s> I have owned Dells all my life and have had no problems with them. </s>
<s> Now I hear that Dells are horrible. </s>
<s> So I thought about HP or Gateway, and I hear conflicting reviews on those brands too. </s>
<s> Here are a couple systems I am considering: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=999998900050006&type=product&id=pcmprd99000050006 http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=999998900050011&type=product&id=pcmprd99000050011 Any advice? </s>
<s> I am considering waiting until Black Friday to make my purchase. </s>
<s> Do you think I could get a good deal then? </s>
<s> re option 2....really don't like slim line....limited upgrades and tend to run a little warmrer. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS.....Take a look at http://www.techbargains.com ...lots of PC deals every week. </s>
