1.1.1	My computer : Gateway GT5648E AMD 64x2 6000+ 3GB DDR2 GeForce 6150SE 300 watt power supply I know this is not much of a gaming computer , which is fine because I am not a hard core gamer .	St
1.1.2	I just like to play the occasional flight sim and am wondering if I can upgrade this computer slightly .	St
1.1.3	As it is , IL-2 still plays a little choppy .	St
1.1.4	I do n't need to run the sims at their maximum settings - just above average settings would be fine for me .	St
1.1.5	Am I right that I can still install an external card along with the 6150SE ?	Ques
1.1.6	I would rather not bother with a stronger power supply if I do n't have to , but I will consider it .	St
1.1.7	I do n't want to spend more than $ 200 total .	St
1.1.8	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	on this same subject ?	Ques
1.2.2	Have you read you product docs to identify what your options are for installing a GPU card internally ?	Ques
1.2.3	VAPCMD PS ... Looks like a recent purchase ... did you overlook this requirement when you bought this ?	Ques
1.3.1	I did look through the others , but I could n't find one that applied to my situation .	St
1.3.2	Have n't been able to find anything in my documentation either .	St
1.3.3	I bought this computer knowing that the 6150SE is not intended for high-end gaming .	St
1.3.4	That 's fine , because I do n't play many games and when I do , they are usually not the graphic-intensive variety .	St
1.3.5	It 's just that occasionally I like to fire up a flight sim and am wondering if I can get a little bit better performance out of this computer .	St
1.3.6	I assume that means a graphics card , but if there are other ways to do it , I 'm all ears .	St
1.4.1	You might try shutting down some of your background task before running your game ... .test .	Sug
1.4.2	Int vid works well for non-gamers and light gaming .	St
1.4.3	If you try to push this ... things can get a little slow and choppy .	St
1.4.4	The int vid does not have the horse-power to process all that data .	St
1.4.5	Your machine seems to have a pci-e vid slot .	St
1.4.6	If you decide to use this you might open a can of worms ... .power+cooling .	St

1.6.1	specs in & lt ; 30 seconds on the web ... you have the product docs , access to the WEB , access to Gateway Tech Support and access to all the similar posts here .	St
1.6.2	Re the PSU ... you need to pick a GPU before you can decide if a larger PSU is required .	St
1.6.3	I 'm still at a loss to understand why you recently bought a new PC with a decent processor , 3GBs RAM and onboard video and want to run Flight Simulator or any other GPU intensive software .	St
1.6.4	VAPCMD	St
1.7.1	radeon 2600xt , $ 85 : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814103038 geforce 8600gt , $ 104 ( before $ 20 rebate ) : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814127293 either will work with your existing power supply .	Ques
1.8.1	Hello Rob .	St
1.8.2	I recently bought two of the same PC that you have , and let me say I love it .	St
1.8.3	Just to answer the question of the video card , yes you can install in internal video card .	St
1.8.4	I bought the 8800 GT for both of my systems ( $ 279 ) , and upgraded the power supply as well , but that was just for safe measure .	St
1.8.5	I just tracked down a card that would work perfectly for you .	St
1.8.6	Since the onboard graphics are nvidia , I would stay with a nvidia card as well .	St
1.8.7	Here 's the link for the card http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814143112 You might want to toss in a power supply as well .	Ques
1.8.8	The card does n't need one , buy a 400W supply would make your system more stable .	St
1.8.9	And here 's a link for the supply I would recommend .	St
1.8.10	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817153060 Like I said , do n't need the power supply , but it would definatly help .	St
1.8.11	I hope this helps .	Polite
1.9.1	yah I just built an system with EVGA 8600 GTS and its good .	St
1.9.2	but on the card I would go EVGA or XFX .	St
