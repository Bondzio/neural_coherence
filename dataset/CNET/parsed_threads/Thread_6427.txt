<s> I'm working with a self built PC from about 8 years ago. </s>
<s> It has a 3.2 gHz P4 HT processor that, according to the internal sensor is running at about 70-80 degrees C normally. </s>
<s> The sensors may be a bit off i suppose, but the heatsink is hot to the touch and I have been having problems with random restarts for years. </s>
<s> Building this PC was the last thing I did with hardware other than routine maintanance on it, so I'm a bit rusty. </s>
<s> The PC has been degrading in performance steadily for the past 3 or 4 years, even when used on software of its era, so I think overheating may be the problem. </s>
<s> Diagnostic software such as everest and Hirens find no problems in anything of my comp much to my dismay of not having an easy fix. </s>
<s> Is there a way to reduce the CPU temp or is damage from running at high temp for so long permenant. </s>
<s> My heatsink fan is stuck at 5000 + RPMs, which I previously thought would discourage overheat so I didn't attempt to fix it, but is this causing a problem itself? </s>
<s> I could try and reseat the heatsink, but wanted to get some opinions before I do anything that could make the situation worse, as I definitely cannot afford to buy another processor right now. </s>
<s> It has been about 7 years since this particular heatsink was added so could I need to take it off and apply more thermal paste perhaps? </s>
<s> Any input would be much appriciated. </s>
<s> It means the heat from the CPU is getting to the heat sink. </s>
<s> At 8 years that's clearly when we started to see BAD CAPS. </s>
<s> Google bad caps to learn about and how to inspect for that. </s>

<s> I agree that a hot heat sink is good thing in as far as it's clearly dissipating heat from the CPU but personally I would be more than a little concered running an eight year old processor at those kind of temperatures for prolonged periods of time. </s>
<s> If you manage to repair your mainboard I would seriously consider spending a little cash on some better cooling solutions. </s>

<s> Since the last time applied was 7yrs. </s>
<s> ago, it wouldn't hurt to remove and clean cpu itself and reapply thermo paste. </s>
<s> Now, only a little bit goes a long way. </s>
<s> Inspect the fan be sure it 100% clean and dust free itself or replace with similar fan. </s>
<s> Then assure proper remount of fan(HSF) onto the cpu. </s>
<s> While you're at it, clean out the entire PC case. </s>
<s> Check!!! </s>
<s> the frt. </s>
<s> cover vents, as many users don't remove it and clean that out. </s>
<s> Its usually the air inlet to the case. </s>
<s> I find that alone can an undisclosed area to check. </s>
<s> Check also all the replies you had here as they all make sense. </s>
<s> Excluding any damage to cpu, it should work better than before, if not, then maybe another is at fault or the cpu is cooked. </s>
<s> Intel cpus will run at lower speeds if too hot and then start shutdown when hi-temp reached. </s>
<s> There are other cpu monitoring s/w, freebie that work great and can report the status as well, like CPUID and my favorite, PCWizard 2010(entire system report), but google for others. </s>
<s> To check for proper thermo paste application, google &quot;Artic Silver&quot; and follow instructions. </s>
