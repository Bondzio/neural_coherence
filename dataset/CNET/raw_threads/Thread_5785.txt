Looking to network within the house and have backups go automatically. I have one wired PC which is on its last leg and a Mac connected wirelessly. We are mostly photos and a bit of video on a 14MP DSLR (14K - not sure on total size) and music (40 GB) at this point. I am considering directly wiring my TV and/or Playstation into the network as well. Thoughts on a good solution? I am having a hard time looking forward to see what my needs will be.
