Find an online a &quot;wattage calculator&quot; enter the specs of your PC build, then add 100W to the total.
Understand under heat stress or prolonged usage, heat will deter the uptime as wattage levels become unstable on the upper end.
Also, look for 80+% rating that suggest the PSU will deliver for long periods of use reliability.
