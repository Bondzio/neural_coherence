1.1.1	Systems locks up during boot , when CDRW only is installed or when installed with dvd drive in either the master or slave mode .	St
1.1.2	In cable select CDRW is n't recognized .	St
1.1.3	I have tried diferent IDE cables , Different CDRW drives , The drive installed works on another computer .	St
1.1.4	I have determined the lockup occurs when it tries to load turbovcd.vxd ( This is listed as a virtual device driver for windows 95 .	St
1.1.5	Pacific Comware 1991-96 ) My computer is a Gateway , Intel Cereron a , 333 mhz .	St
1.1.6	66mhz external bus .	St
1.1.7	BIOS American Megatrends OAAKW040 64MB Memory , FAT32 6137MB C drive 2642MB free .	St
1.1.8	Your thought would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	I do n't understand the first sentence of your message .	St
1.3.2	( NT ) Remark out turbovcd .	St
1.3.3	Further explaination would be helpfull .	St
1.3.4	Do n't want to do a major screw up .	St
1.3.5	Thanks for the response	St
1.4.1	You 've used this old OS for years so I offered the simplest steps .	St
1.4.2	1 .	St
1.4.3	Boot SAFE MODE .	St
1.4.4	2 .	St
1.4.5	Run MSCONFIG .	St
1.4.6	3 .	St
1.4.7	Uncheck the turbovcd .	St
1.4.8	Try again .	St
1.4.9	If MSCONFIG does n't offer it , then find the .VXD in the C : \windows\system.ini and insert the semicolon in the line that notes turbovcd .	St
1.4.10	Bob	St
1.5.1	OK. did what you suggested .	St
1.5.2	With CDRW drive connected , system locked up at prompt prior to the one I removed .	St
1.5.3	msmouse.vxd ( locked up ) with turbovcd.vxd unchecked .	St
1.5.4	Previously would lock up at turbovcd.vxd which comes directly after the msmouse.vxd .	St
1.5.5	I rebooted with the CDRW unhooked and without fixing the turbovcd.vxd , system booted correctly .	St
1.5.6	Just following the msmouse.vxd is the windows screen .	St
1.5.7	I would assume the CDRW problem conflicts with the opening of windows .	St
1.5.8	I 'm not sure where to look from here as the step by step mode ends and the system boots .	St
1.5.9	Your thoughts would be appreciated .	Polite
1.5.10	Thanks	Polite
1.6.1	I would uninstall everything associated with the CDRW and start over .	St
1.6.2	That means the hardware in Manager and software , first from the Programs list , then Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel .	St
1.6.3	Even check My Computer-Find .	Sug
1.6.4	Then reboot .	St
1.6.5	I found I have less problems installing hardware if I leave the OS disc in a drive ( in case it needs a file ) till it installs successfully .	St
1.6.6	But thats just me .	St
1.6.7	DO NOT put the deck software in till Windows installs the basic CD drive on first boot .	St
1.6.8	Till it does that , you got nothing .	St
1.6.9	Good luck .	Polite
1.6.10	chuck	St
1.7.1	http : //computercops.biz/postp90589.html also notes what turbovcd is as well as what other turbomodem drivers might be at play .	St
1.7.2	My & quot ; guess & quot ; is the motherboard drivers are out of date or never installed .	St
1.7.3	I do n't remember you posting the make/model of machine or motherboard so I have to wait for more information before I can comment further .	St
1.7.4	The forum tip does ask for such so you can get speedy resolutions .	St
1.7.5	Bob	St
1.8.1	The system at this point does n't see the CDRW drive .	St
1.8.2	If I try and start the system with only the CDRW drive installed ( I have removed the DVD drive and have cleared the Device Manager of the DVD drive ) the system will lockup at the above mentioned location .	St
1.8.3	This is consistant .	St
1.8.4	I have n't tryed the other things you have suggested and will do this later this evening .	St
1.8.5	I have been at this on and off for about three months .	St
1.8.6	I have tryed two different drive manufacturers and have replaced the existing drive three times .	St
1.8.7	IDE cable as well .	St
1.8.8	Tryed the drive and combinations with DVD drive in all comfigurations .	St
1.8.9	( locked up when ever CDRW was installed ) Even tested the CDRW drive in a different computer .	St
1.8.10	It worked .	St
1.8.11	The drive is an IOMagic 52x24x52 internal CD-RW .	St
1.8.12	Thanks for your response .	St
1.9.1	The system is a Gateway Model obs g6-333c .	St
1.9.2	the motherboard is a Anigma Pentium II Motherboard w/ Integrated AGP/Audio/DVD ( part number 4000274 ) Hope this helps .	St
1.9.3	Thanks again !	St
1.10.1	I re-read the first post and I indeed missed that info .	St
1.10.2	http : //members.driverguide.com/driver/detail.php ? driverid=154086 only listed a 2001 BIOS and some other drivers I would PASS UP .	St
1.10.3	I 'd review your choice of cable and JUMPERS on the new CDRW drive since having it incorrect will cause a hang .	St
1.10.4	http : //downloads.guru3d.com/download.php ? id=17 however finds the INTEL .INF motherboard package that could be needed , but let us file that for later .	St
1.10.5	FOR NOW , just tell what the old drive jumper was and what the new drive jumper is .	St
1.10.6	Bob	St
1.11.1	The origional drive is a DVD .	St
1.11.2	This drive is hooked to the secondary IDE and is set to master .	St
1.11.3	The system works fine with only this drive connected .	St
1.11.4	( Origionally when I started this process , months ago , my Hard drive was hooked to the secondary IDE .	St
1.11.5	I switched it to the Primary . )	St
1.11.6	If I remove the DVD drive and install only the CDrw drive it locks the system .	St
1.11.7	Set as a Master on the secondary IDE .	St
1.11.8	I have tried installing both drives in all combinations of master or slave and I get the same results .	St
1.11.9	If both drives are connected and both are set to cable select the system will boot , but it only recognizes the DVD drvie in device manager .	St
1.11.10	I have tried the CDRW , installed alone , in both Slave and Master positions wo n't boot .	St
1.11.11	I also have tried two different IDE cables .	St
1.11.12	I started this process with a drive distributed by Mad Dog .	St
1.11.13	Two different drives from them .	St
1.11.14	This is the third IO magic drive I have had .	St
1.11.15	This drive also operated in a different computer .	St
1.11.16	I did have a computer tech come over and he upgraded the bios off the gateway web site .	St
1.11.17	I have talked to Gateway and am told this drive should work in my system .	St
1.11.18	IO magic says the problem has to be in my computer , however , they did exchange the drive .	St
1.11.19	I 'm beginning to think I have a compatability issue .	St
1.11.20	Thanks again	St
1.12.1	I 'd have to try it in another machine .	St
1.12.2	Bob	St
1.13.1	Boot with the working DVD or such drive .	St
1.13.2	Find your way to the device manager and change the IDE Secondary channel to PIO or DMA DISABLED .	St
1.13.3	Then shut down and try it again .	Sug
1.13.4	bob	St
1.14.1	Sorry I do n't understand what you want me to try .	St
1.14.2	PIO or DMA Disable ?	Ques
1.14.3	I find the line in device manager , but how do I disable ?	Ques
1.14.4	YOur information would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.14.5	I will try the drive again in another computer .	St
1.14.6	For your information I have an IDE cable and the CDRW drive calls for an EIDE cable .	St
1.14.7	Could this be the problem ?	Ques
1.14.8	Thanks Again Petter	St
1.15.1	PIO is the same as DMA DISABLE or even DISABLE DMA .	St
1.15.2	The naming of whatever setting that does n't use DMA changes with the OS .	St
1.15.3	Bob	St
1.16.1	Thanks for the update .	St
1.16.2	I have some work to do on testing the drive etc .	St
1.16.3	Will lwt you know what I find out .	St
1.16.4	Thanks Petter	St
1.17.1	I had the CR/RW drive checked .	St
1.17.2	It was detected in the computer stores system , but would burn a cd .	St
1.17.3	I 'm sending the drive back again .	St
1.17.4	Could it be I need to go with a slower drive ?	Ques
1.17.5	I 'm not sure in the detection process how the drive is detected .	St
1.17.6	Maybe you could walk me through how the drive is detected .	St
1.17.7	Petter	St
1.18.1	Is far beyond what I 'm willing to type into any web page .	St
1.18.2	Since all this and more is on MSDN ( the Microsoft site ) , you can digest it there .	St
1.18.3	I 'm unsure how such information will help you since what would you do with it ?	Ques
1.18.4	Good CDRW drives work fine on 98 if the machine is not & quot ; broken & quot ; and if the machine has motherboard drivers if such are needed .	St
1.18.5	I 've never had to dive much deeper than this .	St
1.18.6	But there are a few that ca n't accept that CDRW ( or other ) drives fail and spend months with & quot ; it ca n't be the drive & quot ; .	St
1.18.7	I 've learned over the years to swap in a new drive earlier than later and to do simple tests such as trying to boot for said drives .	St
1.18.8	bob	St
1.19.1	Back to the very first post .	St
1.19.2	Something I just ran into .	St
1.19.3	New optical and hard drives are SUPPOSED to run as cable-select .	St
1.19.4	Not all do .	St
1.19.5	I had to change my new drives back to Master and Slave for them to work .	St
1.19.6	Second point , also ran into a different problem when I got my new DVDRW and it was n't recognized .	St
1.19.7	It would only run as Master and DVDrom as slave , not the other way around like I wanted .	St
1.19.8	Gave away a perfectly good CDRW for the same reason , thinking it was bad .	St
1.19.9	Wanted the DVDRW anyway .	St
1.19.10	Experiment a little , it might help to figure out the problem .	St
