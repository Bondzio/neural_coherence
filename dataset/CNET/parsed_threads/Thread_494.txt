<s> I booted nad used my PC this morning with no problems what so ever. </s>
<s> I had to leave and shut it down the way I always do, properly. </s>
<s> When I attempt to reboot now I enter my password, my desktop background image appears and then it immediately says &quot;saving settings&quot; and returns to my password screen. </s>
<s> I have atempted to reboot in safe mode &quot;Last known good starting point&quot;, regular safemode and I get the same thing. </s>
<s> PC will not complete boot process or let me go any farther to diagnose problem. </s>
<s> I am running a: SONY VAIO PCV-RX650 WinXP_SP2 Nvidia TNT 2 64/Pro GPU with 32mb's of on board ram 512MB's of system ram 80GB HD with 68 GB free space. </s>
<s> Just wondering if anyone could help me out with this dilemna? </s>
<s> Would greatly appreciate it! </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> For example, the hidden 'administrator' account (default: no password) you only see on the Safe Mode welcome screen. </s>
<s> Things like this are exactly the reason why it's recommended to have 2 admin accounts available (and reachable) on a machine. </s>
<s> If one is corrupted (that could be the case here) you can use the other to make a new one, transfer files and continue as if (practically) nothing had happened. </s>
<s> Of course, if the corruption is on a 'deeper' level, this won't help. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Only one Administrator account . </s>
<s> But problems occurs with all accounts created on machine. </s>
<s> Never read anything on that. </s>
<s> Thanks for input, will remember for future reference. </s>
