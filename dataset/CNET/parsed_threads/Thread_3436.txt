<s> Im building a new computer from all new parts. </s>
<s> When I plug in my power supply, the system starts without pushing the switch. </s>
<s> The front switch doesnt work either. </s>
<s> Even with the switch disconected from the board the system still starts up when the ATX Power supply is plugged in. </s>
<s> No OS has been installed...is this a hardware problem like a jumper or a software issue (will it be fine after the OS is installed) or can the be configured in the BIOS. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help The board is a Biostar P4VTB with a Power Magic 550W power supply </s>
<s> The name may change slightly. </s>
<s> In my Asus it is in the Power Mgt section and called &quot;AC PWR Loss Restart&quot; does what you say when &quot;enabled&quot; I use that mode to turn everything on by hitting the switch on my surge protector. </s>
<s> After shutting down and turning off the switch on the surge protector the system thinks that there was a power loss. </s>
<s> When the power is restored the system will boot up. </s>
<s> Of course it could be something else. </s>
<s> Or flawed even. </s>
<s> Imagine new system builders ire as they notice that boards had a documentation flaw. </s>
<s> A recent flub had people connecting an IDE LED to the reset. </s>
<s> Over 1/2 those boards were RMA'd over such. </s>
<s> The motherboard marking was correct, but this error has been seen on many boards. </s>
<s> You should examine the markings on the motherboard for the power on switch and consider that many can't test said push button with an Ohmmeter. </s>
