in an atx system.
it is a momentary contact switch, at first contact it initiates a logic circuit on the mobo that turns the supply on.
the supply has a built in delay of 100 to 500 ms to allow the voltage to get up to spec before it issues the power ok signal.
the various delays would make the second contact to be missed by the logic circuitry unless it was a few seconds later.
the problem that you had with the prior computer was likely with an at type system, where the power switch was an alternate action switch and could be activated off and on rapidly [this still should not bother a good supply [back in the old vacuum tube days it definitely caused problems.
