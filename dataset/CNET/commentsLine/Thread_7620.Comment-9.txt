linkit: i took your suggestion and updated the firmware for my linksys router.
that did the trick, although i still wonder why this was necessary.
now each computer that is turned on is assigned an ip address, starting at the bottom of the list (x.x.x.100) and going up sequentially from there.
this is as it should be, how it used to be, and is once again.
many thanks for your concern, your assistance and your tenacity.
