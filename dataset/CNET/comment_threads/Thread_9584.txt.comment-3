You must connect switches to routers thus: Modem -&gt; Router -&gt; Switch -&gt; devices.
Switches do not assign IP addresses.
(Well, you can reverse it but you need to be a CCNA.)
Second, DMZ means open to the world.
Any device in a DMZ is not protected by a router's firewall.
Are you sure you want this?
Why not just connect the devices to the router and switch normally, and either enable or disable sharing on specific devices?
Like Bob says, you can make it work by your description, but you will get to learn addressing and sub-nets.
