Not sure what the problem is, but one of three things happen when I power up the comp: 1. The drive is not detected or there is some sort of error before XP begins to load; 2. XP will act like it's loading and take an extremely long time; or 3. I'll get to the XP desktop, but my wallpaper is gone and XP is frozen -and I am going to purchase a USB hard drive (something I should have done a while ago) Is it possible to get the data from my old drive to the USB drive using only the above items and the necessary cables, etc? I don't have another computer with SATA support, so absent some solution that I can conjure up here at home, I'm going to have to take it in somewhere.

What can work is to put the old drive as slave or in the external drive and copy your files out. XP does not boot or run when we move it... Bob

But what I have right now is a brick with data on it, and I was hoping I could power up that drive, connect it to the USB drive (maybe while it's connected to my laptop), and then transfer from my old drive to the USB drive.

Fortunately I just realized that I know someone who probably has SATA support, so I'll have to give him a ring.

How did &quot;Thick as a brick&quot;. I'll be back in a minute.......... seems it was &quot;Jethro Tull&quot;: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toHlMD50eYY

So there is a way that I can turn my 250gb desktop SATA drive into a USB back up drive, with some sort of enclosure? That way I could theoretically transfer my important data from that drive to my laptop, reformat the SATA drive, and use it just like an off-the-shelf USB back up drive?

Connect the combination to any computer with USB 2.0 ports to get the info off of the old drive and save to the host computer or CD or DVD for later use.

This adapter is far more flexible than a simple USB enclosure, but check it out if it fits yours needs. Goto: http://www.geeks.com look for ADA-2020 or google for a picture/example. I've already used in cases like yours and the other way around too, getting laptop HD data. Plus, as a quick way to test CD drives as well. tada -----Willy
