i have been following this thread as i have the exact same requirements for my own invite biz - i love all the stardream papers and would love to find a printer that can print on the cardstock (285 gsm) - i wanted a color laser but i am willing to consider inkjet..... has anyone tried the metallic stardream cardstock on the epson stylus c120?
thanks!
