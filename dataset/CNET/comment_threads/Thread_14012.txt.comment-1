http://reviews.cnet.com/eMachines_T6212/4505-3118_7-31341178.html?tag=tab I am posting this in response to the new eMachines T6212 review by Cnet.
They write... &quot;Compared to the T5026 released last quarter, the T6212 trades some performance for upgradability.
We're not thrilled with the T6212 taking a step back in both application and 3D graphics performance, but we welcome the addition of a PCI Express slot for future graphics upgrades.&quot; Cnet's numbers in Application and 3D gaming performance support this claim.
The T5026 was marginally better in both catagories, amazingly.
I am surprised at these results.
They also comment on the T6212 using faster 512MB of 400MHz memory but droping the Serial ATA hard drive from the T5026.
Overall, Cnet gave the T6212 a 7.3 which is low compared to the T3256 and T5026.
Will it be an Editor's Choice?
We will see.
