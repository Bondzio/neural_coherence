Can anyone help me shed some light on this please,thanks-John

What I did in the end was to transfer everything on that drive to another then format the drive in question and now it seems to hold whatever I put in(up to its capacity of course) It really puzzles me that this should happen so thanks for any input--John

Even though NTFS sidesteps that number, some applications can't handle too many files in the root or top directory. But it looks like it was corrupted somehow. Did you try CHDKSK on it? Bob
