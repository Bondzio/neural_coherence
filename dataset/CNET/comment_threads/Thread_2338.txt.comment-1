I recently bought the Netgear WG 511v2 wifi card for my Dell Latitude lap top with Win Xp pro operating system.
Prior to this card I have used belkins and linksys cards with no problems at all.
Ever since I have installed this card I continue to face problems when i try to put the laptop on stand by or shut down nothing happens, I have to hold down the power button for a few seconds to shut off the machine which is of course not the best way to work the computer.
I have tried removing the wifi card restarting the machine and trying to put the laptop on stand by and all of it works just perfect.
I have a feeling its got to do with the new card.
ANy help will be appreciated..
