Hey Hey, &lt;div&gt;I just want to get quick advise.
I have an old computer with the following: &lt;div&gt;Gigabyte GA P35 DS3 something like that 2,6 GHz Core 2 Duo Intel XFX Geforce 8800 GTS 2GB Memory &lt;/div&gt; to me it looks like the video card is the slowest part, so I thought I could replace the video card by maybe a GTX 260 or a GTX 460 or something like that.
What do you think?
Ah, my goal is to have a few more fps in games and I don't want to spend the money on a complete new computer.
Thanks already Tobi &lt;/div&gt;
