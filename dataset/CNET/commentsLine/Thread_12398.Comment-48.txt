i'm tempted to take your recommendation on the photosmart!
i'm having problems printing on cardstock that is 80# (216 g/m2).
i have a hp color laserjet 2605dn and i can only print on 80# if i do manual feed or pray...but praying only works 'sometimes'.
i can't babysit the thing to make sure it doesn't jam.
does the photosmart do 80# in the regular paper tray or do you have to do manual feed?
is the print quality equivalent to a laserjet?
tried any transparency fades on your graphics?
thanks for any additional info you have to ease my concerns!
