goto  go in there graphics/display section and look in vga charts iii the geforce fx 5900xt is the geforce fx 5900se...they same thing, but they are actually the lowest 5900 card, it goes like this geforce fx 5950 ultra ^ ^ geforce fx 5900 ultra ^ ^ geforce fx 5900 ^ ^ geforce fx 5900xt/se the xt is a good card, not great but for $178 you should go for a $195 msi rx9800 (radeon 9800 128mb) it's going to be faster and turn back better performance in aa/af...otherwise the 5900xt/se can keep up rather fine to the 9700pro or 9800np (non-pro) if you don't want aa/af go for the 5900xt for $178 if you want aa/af goto newegg and pick up the 9800pro...imo that would be best deal, if aa/af isn't an issue with you than by all means go for the slightly less expensive and still very fast 5900xt...
