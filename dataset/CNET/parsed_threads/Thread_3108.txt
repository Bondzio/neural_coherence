<s> Is it better to buy a really fast computer vs. these 1.6 ghz dual cores? </s>
<s> Is Vista or any other program (Photoshop, Nero, etc) out there making using of the dual core? </s>
<s> there are hardly any 'fast' single core computers nowadays and intel will end single core production in 2008. vista and photoshop definitely takes advantage of dual cores. </s>
<s> and even if the specific program you're using doesn't, most PC's are always running 5-10 programs in the background at any point in time. </s>
<s> you don't shutdown email to surf the web, or close your browser to play music do you? </s>
<s> Dual cores, Quad cores, win over single cores in speed and multi tasking benchmarks. </s>
