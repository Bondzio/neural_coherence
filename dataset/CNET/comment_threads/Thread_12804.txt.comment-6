I don't think I can help you.
It appears there is more information or a bigger question than you lead with.
It's pretty clear that you can't DMZ an entire network.
That is, a machine in the DMZ would receive all incoming connections.
So the usual network is behind a router and while a pool of IPs would let you take an IP and send incoming to that IP to a particular computer, that still fails to &quot;DMZ&quot; the entire network.
At least that's clear to your beginning first year networker.
With that out of the way, I can only suggest you chat with the folk you work with about your network.
I must bow out since I think your goal is unclear.
