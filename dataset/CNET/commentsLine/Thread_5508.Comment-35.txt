and your hd is now in pieces.
i, also, have a wd external hd about 18 months old (is this the expiration date?)
that disappeared.
it said that i didn't have the correct drivers.
i got another external hd (seagate this time).
the old drive could be read on my son't computer (newer and vista - mine older and xp).
so i got him to copy everything from one to the other.
well, he didn't get everything.
i found one thing that seemed to work (it could be i just held my tongue just right) and that was to turn on the computer without the hd.
after the computer had been on for a while, i connected the old hd and it showed up (sometimes - at least enough for me to finish copying old to new).
couldn't guarantee this will work.
next time i will try the freezer fix.
couldn't hurt.
