Well I just got another ram stick and the problem still persists, could it be the CPU or the Motherboard?
I am leaning towards the cpu but when I take off the CPU fan and run the PC when it gets hot it shuts down and it does not restart, unlike when I try to boot windows it restarts.
Can the motherboard be responsible for the PC to restart.
I have also tried installing Linux and I also ran a Windows XP cd that is loaded directly from the cd and does not use the HD and the thing restarts anyway.
