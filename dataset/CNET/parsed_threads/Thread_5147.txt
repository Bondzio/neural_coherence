<s> My note book battery recently has taken a turn for the worse. </s>
<s> It fully charges in about 15 minutes and discharges in 5 minutes. </s>
<s> The battery has been handled properly and charged/fully discharged a few times a week (the battery is only 6 months old). </s>
<s> I think the problem may be w/ the power management portion of the software. </s>
<s> Any ideas I can try besides buying an expensive new battery? </s>
<s> Most laptops have a one year warranty. </s>
<s> Use it. </s>
<s> The expense of a new motherboard will just upset you. </s>

<s> I'm having the exact same problems with my notebook battery. </s>
<s> I'm very sure that is isn't a software problem, because i've swapped the hard drive and performed a fresh Windows installation. </s>
<s> I've also updated the BIOS of my notebook (PB E3255), but even that wasn't the solution. </s>
<s> So if it isn't the software, it's the hardware. </s>
<s> With this in mind, I began to brainstorm and i figured out this: The battery isn't dead of weak, but &quot;he thinks&quot; he is. </s>
<s> The solution to this problem is do completely discharge the battery, so that's what I'm doing now. </s>
<s> First Windows shutdown my notebook because the silly OS thought that the battery was running low (4% to go..). </s>
<s> After being shutdown, my notebook didn't want to start again because he still &quot;thought&quot; that the battery was empty. </s>
<s> So I took the battery out, and I've put it back in after 10 seconds. </s>
<s> After pressing the On button, the notebook boots up and keeps beeping that his battery is empty. </s>
<s> He's doing that now for the last 45 minuits until he's REALLY empty. </s>
<s> I'll post my results tonight, when I'm sertan that this is the sollution. </s>
<s> With kind regards, Le Chuck </s>
