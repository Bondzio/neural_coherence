this is probably a BIOS setting.
I don't know of a way to get around this.
Most of the new graphics cards have 2 connectors on the back.
The information I am finding on the Radeon X600 SE is saying it is a mobile chipset for laptops.
You sure you have the right info?
You can check in the device manager to see if you see 2 ATI Radeon video cards too.
If there are 2 listed there, you can use both connectors on the card.
There should be an adapter with the stuff that came with your card.
Give us an update.
