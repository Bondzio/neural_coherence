yes, you can set it as a slave.
you also could put it on the other ide channel (other cable) as a master or slave.
the current installation of xp on the old hd is expecting the old motherboard and its bios.
that causes major problems.
boot to the xp cd and perform a repair installation of windows.
hopefully you have a backup of your important files in cast there is a problem with the repair installation.
