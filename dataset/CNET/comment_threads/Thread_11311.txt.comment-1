Hello everyone!!
I have a P4 system with an Ausus P4P800-VM motherboard based on the Intel 865 Chipset.
It came with a sound card onboard.
Now I would like to add an additional sound card (any one) to my system.
My Questions are 1) Is it Possible to have both the cards working simultaneously 2) Would it cause any performance losses to the motherboard ?
I would really appreciate your help in this regard!!
Thanks!
