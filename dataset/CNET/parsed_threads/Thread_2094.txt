<s> I have an ip camera that i want to place 400ft from the house in a building and I want to connect via Access point or wireless router. </s>
<s> I have a motorola/netopia 3347-02 wireless router in the house currently as well as a Belkin f5d9231-4. </s>
<s> Is this possible or am i dreaming? </s>
<s> any guidence would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Have you researched wireless cam websites? </s>
<s> It is possible, though you may have to upgrade your equipment a bit. </s>
<s> It also depends on impediments (things in the way of signal) but it is possible. </s>
<s> You could always buy a small netbook, plug the webcam to it. </s>
<s> Place the webcam connected to the netbook connected to the router in a house near a window. </s>
<s> Start up the webcam. </s>
<s> When you want to view the webcam do a Remote Desktop Connection/Protocol (RDP) to the netbook and view it from there. </s>
<s> This is if it's wireless-N. (Check specs to make sure you can connect wirelessly 400ft with wifi-n. </s>
<s> I'm not 100% sure you can.) </s>
