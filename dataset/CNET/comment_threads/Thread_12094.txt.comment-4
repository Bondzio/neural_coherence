As to why it cannot be done, I don't write it cannot be done but that such moves are unsupportable.
Here's why.
USB enclosures have a little firmware and chip to connect it all together.
One mis step and the external may not be readable in the OS if the drive was moved from some other machine but could work fine if one partitions and formats the drive in the new enclosure.
Many will scream and shout it should not be like this.
