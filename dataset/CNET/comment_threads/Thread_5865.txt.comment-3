Your emachines 5212 has a pci-express slot allowing 1 video card to be added.
(The pci-express video card will override your built-in video.)
The main contstraint is your power supply.
Its power rating is not listed in the PC's specifications but it's probably 300W.
Without upgrading your power supply you could add a geForce 8500 based card.
here's a msi 8500gt/256mb for $100 .
if you're willing to add a 400W (or better) power supply ($30-$40 or so) you could move up to a 8600gt for about $150 or a 8600gts for $170-$190.
