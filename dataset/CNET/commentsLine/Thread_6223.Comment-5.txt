i've never read or heard of such.
there is an issue that is not a big deal is that your usb hub must share the bandwidth, but if i add a pc-card usb 2.0, then i see full speed from those ports (as fast as pc-card can go.)
and the usb 2.0 hub is a good idea since i use one like a dock.
makes for fast getaways.
