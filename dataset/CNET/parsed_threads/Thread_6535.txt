<s> Hello, I have a small web desing agency. </s>
<s> We work mostly with files 1 to 10mb and sometimes with larger files (up to 300 - 400mb). </s>
<s> We are moving files over the network from workstations to server and backwards (we have a file check out system on the server). </s>
<s> At this time we are 4 desingers, but I need a solution that works up to 8 / 10 peole. </s>
<s> We are moving from our office to a new location, and I'm thinking to install only a WLAN network but I don't know if the speed would be good for me. </s>
<s> At this time we are working ok on a 100mbps wired network. </s>
<s> I heard that 802.11n have speeds up to 300mbps (that's 3 times faster), but I don't know if that's only in theory or if in practice it will work at that speed. </s>
<s> So I have the next questions: 1) The 300mbps of 802.11n are true on practice or only on theory on &quot;ideal&quot; situations? </s>
<s> 2) If we connect 3 users at the same time, what will happen with the speed? </s>
<s> we have to split the total speed between all the users connected? </s>
<s> 3) Is there any problem right now with security and availability for WLANs? </s>
<s> 4) I'm considering Linksys WRVS4400N router. </s>
<s> It's good or there are better routers for this? </s>
<s> 5) What would be a nice configuration for me? </s>
<s> (router, access point, switch... </s>
<s> I don't know what I need) Thanks a lot! </s>

<s> wired is the fastest route. </s>
<s> If you get a n router and don't replace the wireless cards in the computers, then they can only use the g parft of the router, which in case connect at 54.0 Mbps LAN would be the fastest. </s>

<s> A couple of notes on the 4400n, first I have found that the speed is certainly adequate, but I tend to get quite a few dropped connections. </s>
<s> I'm not 100% positive whether it is the router or the WPC4400n cards. </s>
<s> You will have to get N cards or as a previous respondent indicated, you will only connect at g speeds. </s>
<s> One security note, since you are using this in a business environment, I presume you will be using WPA-Enterprise. </s>
<s> If so, you will want to use WZC and not Linksys Network Monitor to configure the cards. </s>
<s> The reason for this is that LNM does not give you the option of validating the server certificate, and this would leave you vulnerable to a type of man in the middle attack referred to as a validation failure attack. </s>
<s> While this attack rather sophisticated, and is quite hard to mount, it is a concern nonetheless. </s>
<s> I hpe this helps. </s>
