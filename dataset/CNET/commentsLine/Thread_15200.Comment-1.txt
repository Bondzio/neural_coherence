i have two computers,1 is a compaq presario using xp home edition the other is a e machine using home xp edition.
i used the wizzard to set up a network and can get connectivity but the slave wants to use the modem to dial up instead of seeing the network?
i get the icon network connected.
do i need to disable the modem on the slave?
what am i doing wrong here?
jerry thanks
