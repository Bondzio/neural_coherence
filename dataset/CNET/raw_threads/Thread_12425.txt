I've looked all over the thing, looked up serial numbers, etc., and haven't found anything. I think it is just generic. But is there software that can determine the rating? Thanks!

1183	3	100633	1156687	1156568	Willy	4/27/05 7:10 AM	1.1145858E12	Check, please	There are no stickers/decals/model numbers on the power supply? Were you able to hold it in your hand and turn it around? If not, the decal may not be seen on some models while mounted. If none is found, that doesn't pass the UL provided rating it requires for use in the USA. Please inform... tada -----Willy

Gee Bob, I was interested, and for the life of me could not get the reference link to come up for some time and wondering how Lambo got it to come up. Could get these: http://www6.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/images/aerocool420_full.jpg http://www6.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/images/aerocool420_switch.jpg But not your indicated link: http://www6.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/images/aerocool_packing.jpg I finally eliminated the 6 in www and walla: http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/images/aerocool_packing.jpg The image goes with this article: http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/power_supplies-01.html

1183	7	100633	1158866	1157546	Willy	4/28/05 10:31 AM	1.11468426E12	Iffy, if anything else	Practically any p/s unit should have some decal/sticker on it or several. What they all mean in the long term is the p/s is suppose to be able to do what it rated to do and in a safe matter. Fonding one w/o any sticker/decal or one so simple, should be thought of as either dang cheap or a &quot;dump&quot; of parts from whatever source. Any maker not willing to ID themselves or seemily so, shouldn't be trusted as well as thier devices/items. Users have enough problems w/o starting from the git, with less than std. parts. tada -----Willy
