I'm not looking for speed.
I'm looking for power and heat.
65mm intel is generally better than 90mm prescott I've heard.
I can keep my computer running cooler and quieter.
But I can't decide between a Pentium D915 and a P4 631.
Forget about speed and cache, etc.
But the 915 is 95W and the other I found is 65w.
I found a 65w version.
Is the 30 watt difference enough to make my pc hotter.
Or 65mm is better in general and watts don't matter.
thanks, confusimo
