I was having this problem, setting the resolution to 1920x1080 60 hertz, and I just found the solution.
You have to (on the monitor itself) hit the MENU button, and scroll down to the second from the bottom.
Hit SOURCE to select it, the hit the down button until the options become AV mode and HDMI Black Level.
Go to AV mode and hit Source to select it.
Now press up or down to change the setting to OFF.
Exit the menu.
As long as AV mode is off, the monitor will display perfectly.
If the color looks strange, change HDMI Black Level to Normal instead of the default LOW as well.
