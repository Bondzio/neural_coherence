Currently this is what I know: ASUS A8N-E Mobo AMD Athlon 64 Processor 3500+ 2.21GHz 2.0 RAM GeForce 7800 GT video card 1 Brand new 1TB HD Wireless netgear internal card I would really enjoy gaming on this computer and would be interested in knowing what I would have to do to this computer in order to be able to play most current games (diablo 3, BF3, etc). I'm completely new to custom computers and am very interested in learning about it. I look forward to your replies! Derek.

Since this machine is what it is, and changing anything won't noticeable boost the machine try to get by with no changes until you can change to a current machine with multiple cores and what you see in today's machines.
