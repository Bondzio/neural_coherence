Reset my heatsink today and added an extra 60mm fan so now it has an 8cm and a 6cm fan and now it seems to have done the trick.
It's now running at 42C.
Dont know if it should be cooler than that or if that is ok. Heres a link to the arocool dp-102 website http://www.aerocool.us/p-cooler/dp-102/dp102.htm Thanks Ramarc for your help it was greatly appreciated Thanks Paul
