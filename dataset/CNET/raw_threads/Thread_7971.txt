Some more expensive printers have a &quot;sleep mode&quot; which turns them &quot;off&quot; if left &quot;inactive&quot; for a long period of time. I have been told it is a big NO-NO to leave a printer turned on for too long &quot;inactive&quot; because it dries the ink up. I can leave my printer on for days, completely forgetting that it is turned on. What sort of harm or damage am I doing? I really would appreciate some good constructive advice. Thanking you in anticipation of a reply.

This action allows it to &quot;cap&quot; the printhead in order to lessen any drying of the printhead. If your printer doesn't do this then it exposes the prthd. and starts to dry out. When turned-OFF it will park and come to rest on the capping mechanism preventing drying. Again, if it can't do this it wull cause problems fo especially inkjets, less so for any other typical home printer. I exclude power and electrical issues. tada -----Willy
