<s> I have just got a new HP Pavilion 1130n computer and i have a linksys WUSB11 wireless bridge and it keeps disconnecting but i need one for Games.... -Guild Wars -Battlefeild 2 I keep getting problems with you connection any recommendations.....? </s>
<s> and is the WET11 any good? </s>
<s> (Linksys) </s>
<s> I might hardwire the PC to the router. </s>
<s> Wireless, especially 802.11b devices, does not provide enough throughput that gamers crave. </s>
<s> You seem to be going from the Pavilion, which has a 100BaseT NIC, to a wireless bridge. </s>
<s> But then to what -- another system, a router/modem, or whatever -- and what is its potential speed? </s>
<s> As Michael said, gaming requires fast throughput, and the speed is limited to the slowest device. </s>
<s> Your computer is capable of 100 Mbps. </s>
<s> Your current bridge, and the WET11 you asked about, are both 802.11b devices and are limited to 11Mbps maximum. </s>
<s> If the device on the other end of the wireless is also 802.11b, no change is apt to help much. </s>
<s> The newer 802.11g standard provides up to 54 Mbps transmission, and the forthcoming 802.11n standard will provide for up to 108 Mbps rates. </s>
<s> In the interim, manufacturers are offering &quot;Super G&quot; or &quot;Pre N&quot; devices supporting the faster speed. </s>
<s> However there is no guarantee they will meet the 802.11n standard when it is finalized. </s>
<s> Wireless throughput is also a function of distance. </s>
<s> If you want to be assured of the highest speed, and if it is possible, use a Cat5 cable, as Michael suggested, rather than wireless. </s>
<s> If wireless is required, upgrade your bridge and whatever other devices are involved to at least the 802.11g standard. </s>
<s> Hope this helps frank </s>
<s> In real world testing. </s>
<s> Consumer base wireless is a lot less than its spec. </s>
<s> I've tested some Linksys and Netgear wireless routers. </s>
<s> 802.11B mode goes anywhere between 3-6Mbps and 802.11g mode goes anywhere between 7-9Mbps. </s>
<s> The &quot;rest&quot; of the bandwidth are overhead for wireless transmission. </s>
<s> 100Mbps switch goes around 80Mbps with overhead. </s>
