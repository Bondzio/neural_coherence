your motherboard has an ati xpress 200 chipset, which means there is onboard video.
from what the msi website says, there is a pci express x16 slot available for a video card.
here is the ms-7145-020 motherboard:  open your case to confirm that you have that long white expansion slot as indicated in the picture.
that's where the pci express x16 video may be inserted.
note: if you get a powerful video card, you will need to have a good power supply unit (psu).
