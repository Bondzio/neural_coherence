you're new 9800 is far more demanding than your old 8500 model.
i would crtainly consider a new power supply in the 400w+ range.
don't settle for a cheap one either, but at least get a 350w unit, but strongly suggest that 400w+.
pricing isn't that bad, but better ones do cost, so be prepapred.
on top of that, since you mentioned it worked again after returning the old video card, don't try the new until the new p/s is installed.
you can further test by unhooking the cd drive(s) and verify under bios that they're gone for a temp.
fix and quick check.
if it boots up w/o a glitch, then p/s unit.
good luck -----willy
