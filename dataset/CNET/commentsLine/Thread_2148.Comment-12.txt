could be the downfall for copying dvd movies as well.
newer dvd burners, dvd players, audio players, and television sets are all being manufactured that will be able to detect burned illegal copies and won't play them.
you either will get nada, zip, zero on screen or silence in an audio player or you will get a screen saying to put in a new disc because the disc can't be read.
before you waste money and time burning dvd's, try one and play it immediately to see what results you get on screen or in an audio player.
you may be able to play them on your pc, but nothing else.
making copies of anything copyrighted is illegal in the usa...even backup copies.
the reason being is that if you can make one copy as a backup you can just as easily make many for pirating.
when you consider that even hardware, such as a video or sound card, is copyrighted, there is nothing to stop a hardware maker from charging for newer drivers rather than make them available for free as a download...i think some of these copyright laws make no sense at all and they covered too large a canvas with that sweeping brush they used to paint the law in their haste to protect music and movies.
