afer some thought, here's what i'm looking at now... cost includes shipping case: rosewill r114a case w/ 400 wt psu; $57 motherboard: msi neo2 platnium nforce4 ultra $163(assuming newegg gets any more in stock) cpu: amd 64 3500+ $269 ram: 1 gig wintek ddr-400 $181 (2x 512mb) sound card: audigy 2 zs gamer limited $123(may be left off to cut cost) cd drive: dvd-rw w/ dual layer $110 video card: asus eax700-pro $250 monitor: ctx 19&quot; crt $159 os: xp pro sp2 $146 hd: seagate sata 160gb 7200rpm $135 modem, mouse, keyboard: $45 or so.
total cost... roughly $1510 without audigy 2; $1633 with... i'd add in a floppy drive that i already have and maybe a quad speed cd-rom i've got sitting around here.
good, bad, decent?
