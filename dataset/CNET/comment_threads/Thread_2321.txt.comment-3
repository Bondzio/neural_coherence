laymens term means i dont know much about computers as such.
WPA2 i think is something to do with security but i could be mistaken.
If i hover the curser over the connection the it does not say WPA2 but WPA-PSK.
As afar as the signal goes then the other laptops can connect to this signal so i would doubt that it would be this.
I cannot connect to the signal with this laptop but when i go to my sister's house i can connect to her signal and that is why i am puzzled.
There does not seem to be anything wrong with it HELP!!
!
