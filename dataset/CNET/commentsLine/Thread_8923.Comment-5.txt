yeah i will have to get true image.
and as far as the driver disk goes...um thats in the garbage.
i got this tower from my moms boss, which was originally configured for raid 0 and they wanted to wipe the drives so i had put an 3.5 in it until they gave me the drives back.
then i used crummy easus disk copy to get it on one of the original disks, then i decided to shoot for raid.
i know i painted myself into a corner.
lol.
these two drives were originally manufactured for raid.
yeah i do alot of that.....&quot;cross your fingers and restart.&quot; thanks dude.
you cleared a lot up for me.
