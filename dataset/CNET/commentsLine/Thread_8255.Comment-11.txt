&quot;the win2k machine i reformatted the disk and installed win 2k.
the winxp machine is new from dell, dell did the install.
i used the micrsoft drivers that windows suggested to pull down from the web.
was that a mistake?&quot; could be.
microsoft helps by getting the os on it's feet.
we finish it off.
given so little information about the non-working machine, i can't help yet.
i wonder if it has usb 2.0 ports or if windows 2000 has all it's patches.
