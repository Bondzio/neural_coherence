Is it ok to go ahead and clone this HD onto another? Or could that cause any problems with a new HD?

If the clone is not successful....then you wing it...like maybe try to copy out YOUR STUFF. If the clone is successful and all your data is nice and safe then you can play with the orig HD......maker's fitness test?
