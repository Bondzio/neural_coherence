I have purchased a separate ADSL ethernet modem (D-Link DSL-300T) and a wireless router (Linksys Wireless G).
I would like to be able to access the internet from my laptop (which is wifi enabled)anywhere in the house.
All the manuals indicate that once the modem is connected to the router, I need to connect the router to my laptop using an ethernet cable.
My laptop therefore has to be connected to the wireless router with an ethernet cable, which doesn't seem very wireless to me!
Could someone please let me know how I can have the modem and router in one room, and access the internet from my laptop in another room?
A friend of mine can do this with his Mac Setup (a Mac laptop and Airport Extreme modem/router).
