Network Ready usually means that it has a LAN connection device, such as an HP Jetdirect card in it already. This lets you connect a cat5 cable to it, connect to a hub or switch and print to an IP address. No PC is required to be on for this to work. Some printers may say &quot;ready&quot; or &quot;capable&quot;. Make sure if you want the LAN connection it does in fact have the LAN (ethernet) connection already installed.
