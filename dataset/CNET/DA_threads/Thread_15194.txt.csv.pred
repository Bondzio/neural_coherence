1.1.1	Two years ago I had purchased an HP Pavillion dv6736nr Entertainment PC.	St
1.1.2	It had a Samsung HM250JI 250GB HD.	St
1.1.3	This June, that laptop died.	St
1.1.4	I purchased a Samsung R580 two weeks ago.	St
1.1.5	However, I wanted to take the old Samsung HD and put into a hard drive enclosure kit (there's data on it I need).	St
1.1.6	However, the connector that is on that HD does not match any of the connectors of any of the last 4 kits I purchased.	St
1.1.7	I even tried a HD dock, but to no avail.	St
1.1.8	Is there anything else I could do?	St
1.1.9	Are there any models of enclosure kits that would work w/ my drive?	St
1.1.10	Thank you..	St
1.2.1	what kits did you try ?	Ques
1.2.2	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	...	St
1.4.1	So look closely of the mating connections and see what is wrong.	St
1.4.2	If it doesn't look right, then tell why (with some description).	St
1.5.1	should have worked.	Sug
1.5.2	Are you sure there isn't an adapter of some sort still attached to the hard drive from when you removed it from the laptop?	St
1.5.3	If you still have problem....might be best to post a PIC of the hard drive ... esp the part showing the interface connectors.	St
1.5.4	VAPCMD Here's a link to PICs of a laptop drive http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.asp?driveid=815 http://www.newegg.com/Product/ImageGallery.aspx?CurImage=22-136-546-Z04&SpinSet=22-136-546-RS&ISList=22-136-546-Z01%2c22-136-546-Z02%2c22-136-546-Z03%2c22-136-546-Z04&S7ImageFlag=1&Item=N82E16822136546&Depa=0&WaterMark=1&Description=Western%20Digital%20Scorpio%20Blue%20WD7500BPVT%20750GB%205400%20RPM%202.5%22%20SATA%203.0Gb%2fs%20Internal%20Notebook%20Hard%20Drive%20-Bare%20Drive	St
1.6.1	of the drive.	St
1.6.2	As you can see, this connector is not compatible with any of the kits I have purchased or come across.	St
1.6.3	http://img99.imageshack.us/img99/780/snapshot201011141.jpg It uses the SATA 150 - 7 pin Serial ATA interface.	St
1.7.1	to the drive which could be removed to make the drive 'standard SATA'.	St
1.7.2	Do you see anything that looks like that ?	Ques
1.7.3	VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	NIL	St
1.9.1	...thought of that.	St
1.9.2	It appeared to me that it was a permanent connector.	St
1.9.3	Tomorrow, I'll check to see if what you're saying could be the case.	Sug
1.9.4	Robert	St
1.10.1	bare SATA drive looks like at the interface end.	St
1.10.2	VAPCMD	St
1.11.1	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_attached_SCSI	St
1.12.1	..and sure enough.	St
1.12.2	Thank you very much for your help.	St
1.12.3	Robert	St
1.13.1	assuming that's what is was ?	Ques
