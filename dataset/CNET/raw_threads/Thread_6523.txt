11652	0	20586	221263	NR	bdepike	4/22/04 6:42 PM	1.08265932E12	Problem seeing other computers on network	I have a desktop running XP Home connected via ethernet cable to a Microsoft MN-700 router/access point. I also have a notebook running XP Home with a wireless connection to the network. Both computers can connect to the network just fine. File and print sharing is enabled on both and the workgroup name is the same on both computers, yet when I'm on one computer and both are on the network I can't see the other computer. Any ideas on what the problem might be?

It's the firewalls -- as mentioned you have to disable the built-in XP firewall HOWEVER you must ALSO disable the Firewall in Norton Internet Security (which comes preloaded in most XP's). Once I disabled Norton's firewall the whole network was ready. Good luck. ~c
