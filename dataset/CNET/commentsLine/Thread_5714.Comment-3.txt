bob, that fixed most of the problem.
i still can't connect to the internet.
i tried rebooting the modem/router and pc several times and that didn't work.
i then tryed running the easylink connect from the linksys web site and it said the network device was disabled.
i went into device manager and it is enabled.
what do you think?
