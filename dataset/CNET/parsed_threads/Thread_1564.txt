<s> I bought a MAXTOR 250GB SATA-150 as a second drive for video editing. </s>
<s> My system currently has a 160GB PATA-100 hard drive. </s>
<s> My motherboard is a MS-7093. </s>
<s> The instructions say I need to make sure the SATA port is enabled. </s>
<s> I was in the BIOS and saw nothing about SATA. </s>
<s> Integrated periferals says a lot about IDE. </s>
<s> Any ideas on how I can enable my SATA port. </s>

<s> They may customise the BIOS to keep owners from setting items they can't support or other. </s>
<s> So the list is short. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> See if there is a newer BIOS. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Install a PCI SATA card (they are cheap on newegg.com and geeks.com) Bob </s>
<s> ...when upgrading eMachines computers: http://www.emachines.com/support/product_support.html (Pretty sparse with respect to upgrade info and downloads; nevertheless, I'd look here first.) </s>

<s> The second link were very helpful. </s>
<s> I found this &quot;The mainboard BIOS provides &quot;Plug & Play&quot; BIOS which detects the peripheral devices and expansion cards of the board automatically.&quot; and &quot;No bios upgrade was needed to detect the SATA HDD&quot; So I should be set. </s>
<s> that some companies do that. </s>
<s> In the BIOS, I did see some stuff set to &quot;Auto&quot; so we'll see. </s>
<s> The Maxblast Program that came with it did the rest. </s>
<s> it changed something in the registry to enable drives greater than 137 GB. </s>
<s> I un installed Studio9 and tried to reinstall it on the new drive. </s>
<s> &quot;DRV1_VOL1(K:)&quot; It told me I could not install in that drive so I had to reinstall in drive C:. </s>
<s> I had some video on K: and tried to defragment it. </s>
<s> I clicked &quot;Defragment&quot; and the drive started clicking. </s>
<s> After about 15 min it was still at 3% complete so I tried to stop the defrag and my computer froze. </s>
<s> Anyone have an idea as to why I can't put Pinnacle Studio9 on the new drive and why the defragment doesn't work on the new drive? </s>
<s> I have a feeling the defrag doesn't work because the capturing program is on a different drive. </s>
