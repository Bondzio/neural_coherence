i have a 17&quot; flat screen that came with my new(er) system and i kept the 17&quot; bulky monitor from my old system to create a dual-monitor system.
i put my google desktop panels on my older monitor so that i can easily keep track of new messages, news stories (i am a tv producer).
i also keep my aim and yahoo im windows on my secondary monitor.
when i need to compare documents (such as the excel example) i open two instances of the program and put one on the secondary monitor.
i could never go back to a single monitor.
this setup is great for multitasking!
i'd love to hear how other people use their dual monitors.
i also have a question: my newer system came with a tv tuner card, but it only has one monitor output.
is there any way to use the tuner card with my dual-monitor video card?
