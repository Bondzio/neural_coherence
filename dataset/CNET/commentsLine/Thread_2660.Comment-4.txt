perhaps they mean a higher psu.
although once again, i did that and it didn't matter.
lol@ the live chat and yes, they seem to be more like sales people.
more and more i am disliking emachines.
i used to be a fan of emachines line but maybe it's getting worse as i was hoping they improved.
their loss i guess.
but you may need better ventilation also, i don't know if it will help but my opinion is this, no card worked in my emachines, and if at all like mine, doubtful it will in yours either, but good luck.
as stated, a higher psu, more ventilation, if nothing works then its' an emachines thing.
