my 4-5 year old build's power supply finally crapped out last week, and i have replaced with a corsair tx650.
receive new psu, plug it all in, power up and everything seems fine.
the leds on the mouse and keyboard turned on with the computer, so i assume everythings perfect.
however i get no response from either mouse or keyboard when trying to log in/access bios.
i switch usb ports, with no success.
infact, the leds on mouse+keyboard would only be on if you boot the computer up with them plugged into the usb port.
if i try to switch ports when the computer's on, the leds will go off and stay off, but they would flash on briefly when i pull them out of the ports after the first swap.
very weird.
i figure worst case scenario i scoop a ps2 mouse/keyboard but i certainly dont want to if i dont have to.
ayudame!
