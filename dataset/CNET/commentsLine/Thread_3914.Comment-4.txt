i know to check the bios first since too many diddle and end up disabling the ide channels.
next?
1. check the bios ide settings.
(defaults are nice) 2. move the drive and cable to the secondary ide channel.
does it detect it?
do not boot that!
3. if detected, try primary channel again and a new 80 conductor cable.
4. check drive jumper settings.
few get them right.
rules are simple, opinions many.
5. move the drive and new cable to a test machine.
6. does the drive spin?
do tell!
best of luck.
