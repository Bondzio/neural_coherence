<s> I need to add some extra IDE discs to my server but already have 3 and a CD drive in it. </s>
<s> If I buy a seperate PCI IDE controller, will it work alongside the existing one in the motherboard allowing me another 4 drives or will there be a conflict? </s>
<s> I've had a look around various web sites but can't find anything that answers this question. </s>
<s> Thanks, </s>
<s> &quot;I've had a look around various web sites but can't find anything that answers this question.&quot; The question is a little unclear to me. </s>
<s> Maybe you want some controller that will &quot;just work&quot; without all the hoopla of drivers and more. </s>
<s> The short answer is that there was no standard in the basic design for this so you step off into drivers and more. </s>
<s> You also may have skipped the usual suspect of Promise Technology which has the cards, and you can read the manuals. </s>
<s> Here's their web site http://www.promise.com http://www.promise.com/support/file/manual/FT66_Manual_En.pdf for example is a manual for one of the products. </s>
<s> As you can tell, you can't put CDROM type devices on it. </s>
<s> But that's not a big deal since the hard disks (4) can go on the Promise and the CDROM (4) units can be on your motherboard. </s>
<s> When allocating Watts for each drive, use about 30 Watts per drive. </s>

<s> You need to give a lot more info to get this right. </s>
<s> What brand/model server do you have? </s>
<s> Is it a brand name or a clone? </s>
<s> Is there even room inside for more drives? </s>
<s> Are the existing drives SCSI or IDE (many servers use SCSI drives). </s>
<s> You might consider adding a Snap Server to the network to add disk space instead of adding more drives to the system. </s>
