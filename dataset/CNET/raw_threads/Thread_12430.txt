But today I tend to just pick up units like http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=CDIMM00131-PB&cat=MDM which are under 20 bucks. The modem market is littered with such bargains and support is non-existent. While you are asking for all options, I can't help since that would be too much work on my part plus what you can obtain may be limited to what country you live in. Bob

The brands that seem to pop-up alot are USR(3Com) and Zoom. Both supply docs and s/w if needed, while many off brands tend to skip on alot of support or offer basic needs. Plus, the chipset to look for is Lucent or Rockwell, but there are Conxent, Cirrus, and Motorola, maybe others. Check to be sure any cabling is supplied as that's an extra cost otherwise. You can google or websearch and see what the vendors offer but if you know you have a problematic telco link, make sure to correct that as well. good luck -----Willy
