I just go to Staples and hand them back in for their bucks.
As to fade proof.
Isn't that fade &quot;resistant&quot;?
I'm seen claims of fade proof but after putting such in the Arizona desert sun for 5 years it did fade.
Also, the paper matters too.
But you can research more about low acid or acid free/neutralized papers.
