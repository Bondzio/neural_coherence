I'm looking to build a computer and would like recommendations on an AMD chip and motherboard to use with my ati X800 XT I will use with it.
I plan on having about 1gb of RAM and wonder what kind of ram I should get.
I also want to be carefull about buying something that will be limited in performance because of a bottleneck somewhere.
Maybe that's impossible to completely avoid, I just don't want to buy something that will work at half it's potential or something.
I just want a computer that will be able to run The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivian well, and any help would be appreciated, thanks
