I recently bought a digital camera and after loading the drivers for it I plugged it in to the usb port and a window popped up saying new harware found, and windows then proceeded to reinstall the driver for the camera.
Try uninstalling you phone drivers and then plug in your phone and have windows seach for new harware.
