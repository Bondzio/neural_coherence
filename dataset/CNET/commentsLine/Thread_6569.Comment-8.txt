you all have been amazing... thanks especially to darton fury for the long, specific walkthrough.
seems like everything is working, the netgear router did reset after being powered on and the reset button held down for a while.
pc is hooked up to primary router and the netgear seems to be working.
once i bring my pc or psp back here, i'll be able to test the wifi.
(i am not living in my own house for the time being...) thanks everyone for the help... you all are gods and give great, fast responses.
thanks!!!!!!!!!!
!
