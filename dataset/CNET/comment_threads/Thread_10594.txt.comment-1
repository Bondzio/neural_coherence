I have new laptop (HP pavillion dv6-1355dx) running windows 7.
I have a HP Photosmart c309a multifunction printer.
Unable to connect wifi (ad hoc) from laptop to printer for wireless printing.
I created SSID and still can not print anything.
Printer LCD display shows symbal that it is doing something but in the end it does nothing but eventially say there is no connection.
HP service reps are no help and appear to not really know much about basic stuff.
Could some one please help me.
I am pulling my hair out.
Oh yeah, software is loaded too.
