All below are assumptions/generics . . . 1. Wireless N runs at about 100 Mb/s, in perfect laboratory conditions, on an odd Tuesday every third month. 2. Your ISP (still unknown) delivers a speed of 10 Mb/s (or less, or more, still unknown). When you connect to your ISP on this wireless N network you may get 2 Mb/s, also regulated to item number 1. Due to overhead, wireless conditions, bits vs. Bytes, don't hold your breath. In other words, wireless N may be faster than your Internet connection. Wireless N is faster than wireless G. Device to device, as in file transfer between machines, or file sharing on a home network, wireless N is faster than wireless G. Usually.
