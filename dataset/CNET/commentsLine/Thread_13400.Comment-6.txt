try puting back the old card, booting up, go to system properties and uninstall the old card.
turn off your computer and take out the old card and put in the new.
on bootup the system should recognize the new and ask for the drivers.
your problem is a common one if you do not uninstall the old card first and then put the new one in.
hope this works for you
