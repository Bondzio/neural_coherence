Here is some information about my current PC configuration: Windows XP SP2 Pentium D Processor 1GB RAM GeForce 6600 Video Card ATI TV Tuner Card SoundBlaster XFI Sound Card Qty. 2 250GB Seagate Hard Drives (one as PVR and other a main drive) Qty. 1 160GB Seagate Hard Drive (used for backups) Linksys Wireless Card From what I can see, the power supply is 350W. Any other information that would be helpful? Are there symptoms to look for that indicate the power supply is not sufficiently powering the system components? If an upgrade is recommended, what is a good brand....easy to install and won't drain the bank? Also, I have an LCD TV connected to the video card (GeForce 6600) via DVI to HDMI. I have not been able to get the image to fit the screen precisely - the resolution is either too high and the whole image cannot be viewed or it's too low, leaving empty space around the edges. There's a place in the card driver that allows for a custom resolution but it won't allow the resolution of the TV (1366x768). Is anyone aware of a card that will allow such a resolution? I've been looking at both ATI and NVIDIA cards but I don't see anywhere stating anything specific about this resolution.

However, if you get a cheap PSU consider one that's at least 500W or better, even a 600W one that suitable plus fits as it should in your system physically. Visit this website to gauge your power needs, http://www.pcpowerandcooling.com and if you buy one from them consider money well spent, they provide a stable and dependable PSU of highest quality. A good stable PSU is the foundation of a good system. tada -----Willy

They have small enough batteries for them to be almost as big as a regular surge protector. But with the added bonus of monitoring how much power your computer needs. They have this so that they can calculate how long the battery will last before shutting down your computer. Some of them will even shut down your computer automatically. And with that software you can see for yourself what wattage your computer uses. I guess theres those &quot;quality watts&quot; verses those &quot;cheap watts&quot;. Unless your computer is crashing, I'd leave it be.

They have complete instructions on how to modify their drivers/software? to handle the wide screen resolutions. Very likely that ATI also can provide such info. I have the link on my computer at home but won't be back to that computer for about a week. As far as a power supply upgrade, if you are not currently having a know power supply, I say if it ain't broke don't fix it. Yep as Willy says, if you get one go up another 100 watts over your 350.

6746	6	226317	2367561	2364265	zbawic	1/6/07 1:57 PM	1.16809182E12	I picked up a Kill-A-Watt......	and found that the system is only drawing about 200 watts, even when I pushed the system to utilize as many resources as possible simultaneously. I tried a couple different of the PSU calculators and they indicated that I would need one over 400 watts.
