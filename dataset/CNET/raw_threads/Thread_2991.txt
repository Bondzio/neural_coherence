Seems as powerful as anything I'd ever imagine anyone would need...The only think I can add to your debate would be...&quot;why pentium D.&quot; Frankly speaking that processor sucks. If you are going Pentium Dual Core spending this much money you shouldnt have a hiccough in you processor. The P-D is 2 P4 pasted together and frankly doesnt show much improvement over HT which is bad enough. I would never go for a Pentium if I was going dual core. I know Dell stays away from AMD but HP doesnt. Their systems can be configured with this and you can get yourself a beautiful X2 4600+ or 4800+ instead. If you HAVE to go for Intel, the Extreme Edition (800 series) with HT gives a little competition to the AMDs... P.S : Check out Dual Core Duel...PDs get whipped by X2 4400+ forget 4800+
