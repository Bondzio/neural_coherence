1.2.1	You probably have a & quot ; stuck/jammed & quot ; key on the kybd.. With no power present , run your fingers across the keys back and forth on all keys several times , hopefully this will unjam the stuck one .	St
1.2.2	Again , with no power , turn laptop over and rap the back side a few times to see if anything falls out or unjams .	St
1.2.3	Now , retry to boot and check results .	St
1.2.4	If this does n't work , then full access to dissemble the laptop maybe required , post back details on what your laptop is .	St
1.2.5	tada -- -- -Willy	St
