1.1.1	i have 2 desktops running xp home.	St
1.1.2	computer(A)has a 80gb with operating system, and personal files on it.	St
1.1.3	i just installed a new 400gb drive and did a fresh install of windows xp home.	St
1.1.4	i was gonna put it aside and save it for an emergency backup.	St
1.1.5	i decided i'd rather have that 80gb harddrive as a secondary drive in computer(B).	St
1.1.6	can i just install it as though it were a new (slave)drive and be able to access the files that are already on it?	St
1.1.7	or will having the windows operating system on it mess up the master drive?	St
1.1.8	i'd appreciate all advice on this.	Polite
1.2.1	Yup....assuming it isn't encrypted.	St
1.2.2	You should just be able to plug in the second drive as a 'slave' (you probably will not actually need to change the jumpers on the drive, just leave both the drives on the cable select setting).	St
1.2.3	When you boot up Windows it should see it as E: or F: drive.	St
1.3.1	thanks.	St
1.3.2	does it need to be connected to the middle connector of the cable?	St
