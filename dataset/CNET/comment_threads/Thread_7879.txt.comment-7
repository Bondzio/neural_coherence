Since the moderators on these forums think all fixes relating to modem/routers are the same.
I feel I should share the cause and actual quickest possible fix for this issue.
After a bit of searching I found that this issue is not caused because something is wrong with the router, but the issue is caused from a default setting in the computers registry.
The issue can be fixed from Microsoft's Help and Support site from the following link, ( http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928233 ).
