Here is what I have WindowsXP PRO 2 gig memory MSI motherboard Intell pentium 4 1.) hard drive 200 gig with 2 partitions Master (IDE CABLE) (Lets say C and D for lack of any other way to explain.) and not counting the cd drive as a &quot;Partition&quot; but it is E on the &quot;cable&quot;(IDE CABLE) select. I didnt know if the cd would be counted as a Partition, So if you count the cd as a partition would be 3 partitions. 2.) Hard drive 320 gig with 4 partions Master (IDE CABLE) F,G,H,I and not counting a cd drive as a &quot;Partition&quot; but is the J on the cable (IDE CABLE) Select. I didnt know if the cd would be counted as a Partition So if you count the cd as a partition would be 5 partitions. The reason I did this.. wanted to take everything off the 200 gig and wipe fresh. wanted to have the 320 gig like F for operating system G for Zipped and unzipped stuff H for Music and I for swap (memory?) and after cleaning the 200 gig completely format/partition for extra storage or maybe dual boot (different operating system) This is what I am wanting.. 1 hard drive 200 gig with 2 partitions(master) and cd drive as slave 2 hard drive 320 gig with 4 partitions(Master) and cd drive as slave When I boot up with the Partition table boot disk.. I get the message.. Partition 1 and partition 2 on hard disk 1 overlapping. I have searched everywhere only to find Nothing. I need a Soloution to this error. Only answer I can find is to wipe the drive. How do I fix this without loosing my stuff? Hope I explained this so someone can understand. thanks in advance!

You may get lucky and be able to access most, if not all, of your data afterwards. (Be sure to indicate you want to restore all partitions.) Before you do, though, it's advisable to clone the hard drive so that if something goes wrong you're not up a creek without a paddle. Best of luck. John P.S. In response to your PM, Cnet doesn't enable the editing of your own posts due to the potential for abuse of the feature.
