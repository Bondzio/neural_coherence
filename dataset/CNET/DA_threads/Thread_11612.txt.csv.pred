1.1.1	Hi There!	St
1.1.2	I am in Canada and buying a new PC.	St
1.1.3	This is the quote I got from a local PC Builder.	St
1.1.4	Since I am new to all this, I thought i'd ask all you experts if it was a good deal or not.	St
1.1.5	Background info first.	St
1.1.6	I have always had a pentium, Dell because I got the EPP Dell discount throught work.	St
1.1.7	I use my PC every day for work functions, (word, excel) as well and the internet, download DVD's, music, photos.	St
1.1.8	My Hubby wants a decent system to play some games but nothing too fancy.	St
1.1.9	I am looking for upgradability as well as speed.	St
1.1.10	Right now if I have word and internet up at the same time, system crashes.	St
1.1.11	Not sure if I should go for Dual core AMD or Pentium (definitely want dual core).	St
1.1.12	Here is the quote (in Cdn Dollars): System Configuration: Processor - Intel Pentium D930 3.0GHz - 800MHz FSB 4MB Mainboard - Asus P5LD2 S775 i945P Chipset 1066Mhz PCI-Ex16/3+1PCI/4DDR2, w/Sound GB-Lan SATA Raid USB 2.0 Memory - Corsair VS1GBKIT533D2 1GB Kit 2x512MB DDR2 533Mhz Floppy - Peri Power 32-In-1 Memory Card Reader w/2xUSB,1x1394 Black CDRW drive - LG GSA-4167BB/BK 16x16 DL DVDRW w/Software Hard drive - WD WD2500KS 250GB 16MB SATA II Video card - eVGA E-GEFORCE 7600GT 256M DDR PCI-E (256-P2-N553-AX) Sound card - Sound Blaster Audigy 2 ZS 7.1 (OEM) Network card - Marvell 88E8053 PCI-E Gb LAN controller Modem card - Acer Rockwell 56k v92 PCI Modem Casing - Sonata II 17'' Black ATX w/450W PS (8xbays) Monitor - LG 19'' L1932TX-BF 1280x1024 1400:1 4MS BK DVI LCD Keyboard/Mouse - Logitech Cordless Desktop S510 Media Remote KB & Mouse Combo Speakers - Creative Inspire 5.1 P5800 5 Speakers w/subwoofer Software - Windows XP Media Center 2005 Edition OEM (cd,manual & license) Printer - Lexmark X3350 - Multifunction ( color ) - ink-jet - copying (up to): 15 ppm (mono) / 9 ppm (color) - printing (up to): 22 ppm (mono) / 15 ppm (color) - 100 sheets - USB Other - MS Office 2003 Basic Edition (Word, Excel Outlook) Other - AP System Installation Service and AP Standard System Manufacture Warranty (1 Yr Parts & 3 Yrs Service) $2321 plus tax.

1.1.13	Is this good, bad, overkill for our needs?	St
1.1.14	Any components you'd swap for others?	St
1.1.15	Thanks so much for all who chose to reply.	St
1.1.16	I am very grateful!	St
1.1.17	Carina	St
1.2.1	Forgot to add that I can replace the CPU with: $339 Athlon 64 X2 3800+ Dual Core 1000HT 512KBx2 (take $50 off the price) or Athlon 64 X2 4200+ Dual Core 1000HT 512KBx2 (add $26 to the price).	St
1.2.2	Thanks again!	St
1.2.3	Carina	St
1.3.1	Only suggesttion I have is adding a second hard disk drive for fast system backup and restores (should that become necessary).	St
1.3.2	Just assures you can get back up and running quicker if the primary hard disk dies or becomes corrupt.	St
1.3.3	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	...and change the RAM to DDR; AMD's don't support DDR2 yet.	St
1.4.2	You'll also need to change the motherboard to an AMD board.	St
1.4.3	Other than that, it looks good, and it's a good price for a complete computer with Windows, a monitor, and even a printer.	St
1.5.1	That price looks pretty standard for the configuration that you are running.	St
1.5.2	In regards to AMD vs. Intel, the way the 3 processors that you are looking at would be rated overall, imo, would be the X2 4200 then X2 3800 and then the D930.	St
1.5.3	However, if you plan on getting this system upgraded, I would suggest going with intel dispite it being the slower processor because the current AMD chips are reachign the end of their lifespan.	St
1.6.1	but if you're willing/able to wait a few months...you could have more choices .. the new AMD CPUs based on the socket AM2 and DDR2 plus a slightly longer upgrade window.	Sug
1.6.2	Good Luck on your choice.	St
1.6.3	VAPCMD	St
