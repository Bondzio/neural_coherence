Would like to make the right upgrade decision for my system (COPU is AMD Athlon 64 3400+ at 2.2 Ghz on MSI K8T Neo Motherboard (model MS-6702 ATX mainboard) Kevin Byrnes

Why? 400MHz is faster than 333MHz and not very many Windows XP users ever use more than 2GB. Make sure you check with the motherboard specs or Crucial.com to make sure you are selecting the right RAM (the PC2700 looks like ECC ram and that's not necessary).

Adding one more gig of ram may help very specific graphics software if you are editing large photos or videos especially. Other than that save up for 2 more of the faster chips

I don't think you will se difference between 2 and 3GB or RAM in windows if you are not working with large real-time video or smth like that. If i had to choose, a take 2GB of faster RAM.
