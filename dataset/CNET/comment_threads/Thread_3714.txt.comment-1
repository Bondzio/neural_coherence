I am wanting to buy a TV tuner card for my bedroom.
I have an external LCD TV that I watch TV and play my 360 on.
What I am wondering is which TV Tuner cards will allow me to use my monitor for my computer and to hook up the TV Tuner Card to the TV.
The way I would like to do is to have my TV hooked to the tuner card and use my computer as a PVR.
