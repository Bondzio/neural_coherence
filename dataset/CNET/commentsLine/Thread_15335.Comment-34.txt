chaslosh, i was not a techie and still could not qualify, but i have taken as many 'puter mags each month as i could and read them word for word each month for years.
i have learned a few things.
the warnings you speak of are built-in microsoft warnings that amount mainly to b-s!
but your last article is right on.
man, these companies think they can get me to spend my hard earned $$$ for their junk so they can play me with the other biggies they are in bed with!
no more.
when norton came on with the 3 installations for norton systemworks and then its dead and will not run again, i dropped them and will never, never use them again.
for less money i got eset nod32 av that is updated constantly, ahead of the trash curves, and a 2 year 2 user license.
i am saying &quot;bye-bye&quot; to the companies who are playing these games -- and microsoft is my next target for the vista mess and the &quot;genuine advantage&quot; tools they are forcing on us.
if you are not a techie, start taking maximumpc and pc world mags.
it is amazing what you can learn from their clear and concise writing of all kinds of problems and new product comparisons.
again, thanks for starting the thread and for your concise summary of your intent.
i agree wholeheartedly.
keep it up.
