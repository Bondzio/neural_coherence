<s> hello, i just built a new system with an AMD Athlon 64 X2 cpu. </s>
<s> however under my computer it says AMD hammer family processor - model unknow. </s>
<s> Could someone please tell me how i make it so the computer recognizes the processor for what it is? </s>
<s> thanks! </s>
<s> Or does your mobo even support X2s?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> no i haven't tried updating the bios and it's an nvidia nforce 4 ultra mobo... </s>
<s> Microsoft's CPU detection can be 'poor'. </s>
<s> Look up CPUID on google.com and see what it tells you. </s>

<s> well the cpuid says the same thing...does that mean it's my mobo? </s>
<s> i've tried playing bf2 and it worked fine. </s>
<s> since it's not detecting it right, could mean that im getting less preformance? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> CPUID from http://www.cpuid.org/cpuz.php ? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The bios is the latest offered by your motherboard's maker? </s>
