<s> Now, I want to try and re-install the network services. </s>
<s> I was able to re-install the msiexec.com file successfully with the following method.... start-&gt;run&gt; msiexec.exe /unregister start-&gt;run-&gt;msiexec.exe /regserver What I would like to know is, what would the essential filenames for the essential network services are so this approach could be taken to restart the network connection(s) servers and possibly get the network up and running again? </s>
<s> Is this a valid approach? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
