Go to a box store and check them out most have card slots for the camera cards and pic bridge capability so that you can just plug the camera link cable in and print from that. The all in ones are neat also, print, scan and copy and are not that expensive comparitively. As I said go to a box store and take your pick, good luck!

Oh yeah btw, all the very best to you and yours for the holidays!!

Another moderator gave a nod to the Canon MX870 and what a beast. The really good thing about it is their software really works nicely with Windows 7 64 bit where the new HP all-in-ones failed to connect. I was surprised that HP had missed but with a recent HP laptop support failure I think HP has lost me. Bob
