<s> Budget: around USD 850 (total) Looking for: A PC with a Full HD monitor (around 22-inches) and if possible, a discrete graphics card (256MB VRAM is enough but optional) with a total budget of around USD 850. </s>
<s> Needs to have at least: Windows 7 Home Premium OS, 2GB-4GB RAM, 250GB-500GB (or more) HDD storage, Intel or AMD processors will be fine with me - just as long they can run Windows 7 and HD videos with no problem. </s>
<s> Additional details: This PC will be used primarily for surfing the web, playing facebook games, watching videos on the full HD monitor and streaming video from the PC to a 42-inches HD LCD monitor. </s>
<s> Inquiry: Are discrete cards really necessary if I want to play 720p or 1080p video without any lag with media players like VLC? </s>
<s> or will an integrated graphics card do the job just fine? </s>
<s> I will be buying a PC by mid or late April so I'm asking for opinions now. </s>

<s> I'm buying my PC from Singapore, and the cheapest Dell XPS 8100 costs around USD 1000 (from www.dell.com.sg), and it doesn't even include a monitor. </s>
<s> Currently the best deal I found is a Dell Inspiron 545s, which includes the following specs for a price of around USD 870: Intel(R) Core(TM) 2 Duo Processor E8500 (3.16GHz, 1333MHz, 6MB) Genuine Windows(R) 7 Home Premium 64bit (English) Dell(TM) ST2210 21.5 Full HD Widescreen Monitor 4GB (4X1GB) DDR2 SDRAM 800MHz Memory 16X DVD+/-RW with Dual Layer Write Capabilities NVIDIA GeForce G310 512MB DDR3 1 Yr Ltd Hardware Warranty, InHome Service after Remote Diagnosis Integrated 10/100 Fast Ethernet 750GB Serial ATA Hard Drive (7200RPM) w/DataBurst Cache(TM) which is quite reasonable but I'm still looking for options from Acer or Gateway. </s>
<s> I'll try to consult the local retailers if they can provide me with a quotation for other PCs. </s>
<s> The Gateway Desktop for CNET's Editor Choice Feb 2010 looks great, but it lacks a discrete GPU (so my question, does a discrete GPU make much difference when playing HD video compared to an integrated GPU?) </s>
