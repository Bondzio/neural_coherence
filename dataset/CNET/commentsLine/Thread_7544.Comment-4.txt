if you can't get into the bios and you don't know the make/model of your machine or board, usbman won't help much.
as to the bios, check the manual or tell the make/model of machine or board.
generic boards use the del key, and usbman notes that usb should be &quot;enabled.&quot; the error messages in windows are often mis-programmed and &quot;denied&quot; could be because your account is not capable of installing drivers (administrator capable?)
or the usb ports are disabled.
