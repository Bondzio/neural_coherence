1.1.1	I have a VCR/DVD with a hard drive built in.	St
1.1.2	I would like to clone the original to a larger hard drive and don't think this can be done from a computer.	St
1.1.3	Is there cloning devices that will work outside the computer such as a power source with the cables for transfering info?	St
1.1.4	Thanks, Steve	St
1.2.1	Most systems like that use a hard disk &quot;saint&quot; procedure that is specific to the make/model of the HD based recorder.	St
1.2.2	Since you didn't name the make/model you disabled us from looking to see if such a procedure was known.	St

1.3.1	The machine I have (VHS/DVD/Hard Drive)is a JVC DR-MX1, I have not opened it yet to find out what kind of hard drive it has.	St
1.3.2	If need be, I will open the case.	St
1.3.3	Just let me know.	Sug
1.4.1	You'll have to decide if you want to take a chance.	St
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	Until I open the case, is there any inexpensive ways to clone a hard drive outside the computer??	St
1.5.2	Steve	St
1.6.1	But remember that my definition of inexpensive is a PC and google.com information.	St
1.6.2	Expensive is paying someone to do all that.	St
