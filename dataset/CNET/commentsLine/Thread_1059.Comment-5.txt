hi all i don't suppose it is possible to do this via a wireless connection?
i have a similar issue where i have my modem downstairs which is connected to the internet and also to the sky box via ethernet.
my laptop and phone are connected via wireless.
i also have a modem with an external hard drive plugged into the usb port upstairs which may also connect to my bluray player via ethernet.
basically i want to be able to connect my wireless devices to the modem upstairs which in turn speaks to the modem downstairs so i can access the internet.
is this possible?
if someone could point me towards a tutorial that would be amazing, as you can see, my terminology isn't up to spec enough to know what to search for!
