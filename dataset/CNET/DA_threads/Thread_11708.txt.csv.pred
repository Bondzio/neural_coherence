1.1.1	Hi I'm setting up a pc specifically to play games, this is what I came up with: E6850 3.0 4MB/1333MHZ vs E6700 2.66 4MB/1066MHZ 768 MB GF 8800GTX 600M DUAL DVI/TV/HDTV XFX DDR3 vs 640 MB GF 8800GTS 500m Dual dvi/tv xfx ddr3 MEM DDR2 1GB x 2 1066MHZ PC8500 CORSAIR DOMINATOR vs MEM DDR3 2GB 1066MHZ KINGSTON KIT C/2 PCS DE 1GB or MEM DDR3 1GB x 2 1333MHZ KINGSTON ASUS P5K Premiun (I heard this board has problems with the raid0) vs ASUS P5K3 DELUXE or ASUS P5-STRIKER EXTREME(GREEN) well that it up to now and for my monitor a LCD 32 SOYO HDTV3227NB I open for suggestions	St
1.2.1	without knowing what you can afford, it's hard to make good suggestions.	St
1.2.2	for your cpu, the 6850 is a no-brainer... cheaper and faster than the 6700. forget the 8800gtx/768mb and 8800gts/640mb.	St
1.2.3	the only cards you should be looking at are the 8800gts/512mb and 8800gt/512mb.	St
1.2.4	The 8800gts/512 ($370) is almost as fast as an 8800gtx and $100 cheaper while the 8800gt/512 ($280) is faster than an 8800gts/640.	St
1.2.5	if the soyo hdtv is 1366x768, then an 8800gt/512 would be able to handle it.	St
1.2.6	8800gts/512: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130312 8800gt/512: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127311 reviews: http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=3175&p=8 http://www.hothardware.com/articles/NVIDIA_GeForce_8800_GTS_Refresh_Asus_and_XFX/?page=8 http://enthusiast.hardocp.com/article.html?art=MTQzMSw4LCxoZW50aHVzaWFzdA== as for the mobo, are you a serious overclocker planning to hit 4ghz?	St
1.2.7	if not, just get the p5k deluxe.	St
1.2.8	don't pay for features you won't use (firewire, wifi, dual gigabit ethernet, etc).	St
1.2.9	there's no difference between ddr2/ddr3 at the same speed.	St
1.2.10	ddr3 won't make a real performance difference (10%) until speeds greater ddr3-1500 come about and ddr3's price drops by 50%.	St
1.2.11	(is another 4fps really worth $250?).	St
1.2.12	so stick with low latency (cl3) ddr2-800 or a good ddr2-1066 kit.	St
1.2.13	both will OC to ddr2-1333 levels if you want.	St
1.3.1	Hi, Thanks for the info it's been very helpful and about my budget, I could probably spend around $2300 So what do you think about this setup than: E6850 3.0 4MB/1333MHZ (ah what about Q6600 2.4 8MB/1066MHZ does this make a big difference) P5K DELUXE, P5K3 DELUXE, P5K PREMIUM AND THE P5K3 DELUXE I got them at more or less the same price around $235 (I'm planing to make a slight overclock nothing extreme) 8800gtx/768mb where I am buying my stuff they dont have the 512mb only 8800gtx and 8800gts 640mb so it's between this two.	St
1.3.2	MEM DDR2 1GB X 2 1066MHZ PC8500 CORSAIR DOMINATOR (4GB $396) MEM DDR2 2GB X 2 800MHZ CORSAIR (4GB $282) THE SOYO HAS 1366X768 THANKS....	St
1.4.1	the 512mb versions of the 8800gt/gts are nvidia's latest cards.	St
1.4.2	if your vendor doesn't have them, why not get another vendor?	St
1.4.3	i can see paying less, but why would you pay more for older/slower hardware?	St
1.4.4	the p5k-e comes in about 8 different flavors.	St
1.4.5	here's a p5k-e for $140.	St
1.4.6	it probably has all the features you'll use.	St
1.4.7	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131225 your memory prices for 4gb are way too high (if that's US dollars).	St
1.4.8	ddr2-800: g.skill 2x2gb ddr2-800, cl4, $130, http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231148 patriot viper 2x2gb ddr2-800, cl4, $160, http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220293 ddr2-1066: crucial ballistix 2x1gb ddr2-1066, cl5, $99 ($200 for 4gb) http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148069 corsair dominator 2x1gb ddr2-1066, cl5, $155 before $40 rebate ($230 for 4gb) http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820145043 crucial ballistix, 1x2gb ddr2-1066, cl5, $101 ($202 for 4gb) http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=10006489	St
1.5.1	you'll be happier with the 3.0Ghz Dual Core than the 2.4 Q6600.	St
1.5.2	Because of the higher clock speed, it will perform better on games that only utilize 2 cores, like older games.	St
1.5.3	Newer games utilize 4 cores (Crysis) and therefore, you'll most likely get better performance with the Q6600.	St
