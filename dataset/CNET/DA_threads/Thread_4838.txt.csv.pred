1.1.1	I bought my monitor 2 years ago and really liked it until about 2 weeks ago it started to black out.	St
1.1.2	I searched online to see if anyone else was experiencing a similar problem and was surprised to find so many people with the same problem.	St
1.1.3	I went to Hewlett Packard's website and sure enough my monitor met all the requirements to be replaced or fixed.	St
1.1.4	I called the HP Support number and was told that the extended warranty had expired September 30th,(I was 15 days too late) I find this totaly unfair!	St
1.1.5	I believe that Hewlett Packard should be responsible for replacing all f1703 monitors that black out regardless.	St
1.1.6	Mine didn't go bad until after the extended warranty expired, so how was I supposed to know about it.	St
1.1.7	I too won't be buying anything else from Hewlett Packard.	St
1.1.8	They obviously don't know how to fix their mistakes and make things right with customers.	St
1.2.1	Some found out how to fix theirs.	St
1.2.2	Seems easy once you know.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
