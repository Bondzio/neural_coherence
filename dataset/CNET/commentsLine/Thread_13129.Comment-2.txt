when i looked here:  i would say check to see if you installed the drivers and also check the connection where the power supply connects to the card.
the last picture on the right shows where that extra power connection is:  if that is all ok, then i would try talking to the place you purchsed the card.
it could be that your psu is not adequate, but i would think you would be having other problems also if the psu is overloaded.
