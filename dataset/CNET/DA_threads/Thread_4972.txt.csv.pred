1.1.1	I have a HP Pavilion p6110y Desktop PC .	St
1.1.2	Recently my power supply died on me .	St
1.1.3	I bought a power supply which is 430W and installed into my PC which still works fine .	St
1.1.4	I just found out that my old ( original ) power supply was 250W .	St
1.1.5	Will this increase in wattage be something bad for my PC or good ?	Ques
1.1.6	I have n't upgraded anything else .	St
1.1.7	My old power supply fan was facing to the vent on the Desk top tower but the new one which I installed , is facing inside the PC and not to the vent .	St
1.1.8	Is it something that I should be concerned about ?	Ques
1.1.9	Your expert advice is much appreciated	Polite
1.2.1	Let 's break it down to wattage and your fan question .	St
1.2.2	1 .	St
1.2.3	Wattage .	St
1.2.4	A wall outlet here can deliver about 15 Amperes at 110 Volts or about 1600 Watts .	St
1.2.5	It does not blow out a 10 Watt LED lamp because the lamp draws what it needs .	St
1.2.6	2 .	St
1.2.7	Fan .	St
1.2.8	There is no carved in stone mandate that the fan be in a particular place on the PSU .	St
1.2.9	Since you upsized the PSU and it 's working I 'd say it 's fine .	St

1.3.1	It sounds to me as if he 's somehow mounted the unit wrong , I 've done quite a few PSU change outs in Hp towers and have yet to see one venting in , that is one for the books .	St
1.4.1	I 've seen the fans move from the rear to the bottom of the PSU on these designs .	St
1.4.2	It 's not something I think about much but if folk do n't do this a lot , I see why they are concerned .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Fan placement , is a concern only if it is n't working .	St
1.5.2	I ca n't offer why in recent yrs .	St
1.5.3	that placement of the fan is now changed but overall I have n't seen it being a negative result .	St
1.5.4	Airflow in a PC case still has to followed , in that the frt .	St
1.5.5	of PC case is & quot ; IN & quot ; and the rear of PC is & quot ; OUT & quot ; flow .	St
1.5.6	For your benefit , place a thin strip of cloth or paper that flows and locate near rear of PC case by fan .	St
1.5.7	Is it blowing away from PC , then it 's OK .	St
1.5.8	If not and is thrown in , then suspect that the airflow is there to circulate inside and then be thrown out by yet another fan .	St
1.5.9	As long as there is airflow & quot ; in & lt ; - & gt ; out & quot ; then allow it to do its job .	St

1.6.1	Thanks everyone for your advice .	Polite
1.6.2	I think now I am a mini PSU expert I have mounted the power supply correctly as there is only one possible position where it can mounted .	St
1.6.3	On the tower PC , the vent is in the rear near below power plug-in , but the power supply fan is on the side .	St
1.6.4	I did place a piece of paper on the rear of the vent and it blows it away .	St
1.6.5	So it shows air movement and I am all satisfied that my mobo wo n't be fried	St
