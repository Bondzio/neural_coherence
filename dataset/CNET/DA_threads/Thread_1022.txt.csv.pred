1.1.1	Okay, So i picked up the DX-WGRTR at best buy.	St
1.1.2	and i set it up and that bit was easy.	St
1.1.3	Now its a second router on my network, the cord plugged into it comes from the main router at the other end of the house.	St
1.1.4	Now in my room theres two computers one desktop (running XP) which is wired to the router and one laptop (OSX 10.5) and for the most part it works that is if im using the wireless on the laptop an d the wired on the desktop.	St
1.1.5	but if i plug the laptop into the router via ethernet the internet on both computers ceases to function.	St
1.1.6	it just sits there saying loading and never loads.	St
1.1.7	does this sound like a bandwith issue or a router issue.	St
1.1.8	and if so what would you suggest to do.	St
