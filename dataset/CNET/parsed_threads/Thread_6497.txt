<s> Could somebody please help me. </s>
<s> I've got a Mega 100WR wireless adsl modem which I'm using to connect to the internet. </s>
<s> Linked wireless to the modem are 1 Desktop (incl printer,scanner,2x ext hard drives and ext DVD writer) and 1 laptop. </s>
<s> The problem I've got is that I need to connect another desktop however the distance between the current network and the new pc is too big. </s>
<s> I've got another modem (Netgear - dg834gt) which I could use to link into the exsisting network. </s>
<s> My problem is that I cannot get these two modems to talk to each other. </s>
<s> Could someone please help in telling me what settings I need to do in order to get these modems to talk to each other. </s>

<s> Time for plan b. I decline to explain why you can't use these. </s>
<s> Let's move to solutions rather than waste time on this. </s>
<s> Any sugestions on how I may get the other pc on the network? </s>
<s> But none would use that modem you noted. </s>
<s> Sorry but it's up to you to narrow down what solutions you can use. </s>
<s> Are you refering to the netgear or mega modem? </s>
<s> a wireless Network card to the new PC. </s>
<s> But we covered this. </s>
<s> Help us narrow down what solutions you want to entertain from a long Ethernet cable to adding wifi. </s>

<s> I would like to go wireless but as said the distance is too big. </s>
<s> I'm not getting a good anough signal. </s>
<s> In our forum sticky I note how to use a wifi router as a WAP. </s>
<s> You could use that as a second WAP that you place closer to your final destination. </s>

<s> I have a suggestion for you. </s>
<s> I also have ADSL Motorola Surfboard and I use Comcast service which is hooked up thru my desktop (Dell Dimension). </s>
<s> I also have a wireless laptop, and it works ok,(Dell Latitude)but I wanted to hang out in another part of the room, naturually, so I got a cheap wireless modem (Belkin for the laptop, and purchased a very long Lan line,(about 20 to 30 feet) & hooked it up from the Motorolla Surfboard Modem (about 20 feet across the room) to the wireless Belkins modem, with the lan line (network cable) and a short one as well, to hook up one of 3 other connections. </s>
<s> (I removed the lan line from the desktop tower, and hooked it from modem to modem, then the short one from wireless modem to laptop! </s>
<s> I wish I could draw u a diagram. </s>
<s> Anyway, somehow it is working. </s>
<s> If not, get a stick and just put it in your desktop, let it set up a connection, then use it for a wireless connection in your laptop, and be sure you write down the information it gives you on the connections, or save it on notepad or wordpad. </s>
<s> I hope this helps, and by the way, I do not have a phone line, got rid of it years ago! </s>
