During the beginning installation of XP for my newly built computer... i see that i do not have all the components of XP (such as a calculator or windows media player).
I'm suspecting that the error i saw during the installation (Windows needs some files from the windows xp cd please insert into D: D:\i368) well it is in... and everytime i click on OK doesn't do anything... so i'm suspecting that not sure.
Anyone know of any ways to resolve this issue of missing XP components ?
