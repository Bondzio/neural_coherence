i had to format my c:drive several days ago, actually, i didnt want to do this.
my dell pc have been affected due to the virus, and after formatted the disk, my important word files have gone too.
i never aware that the lost files can be recovered by a data recovery software until a friend of mine said it to me.
i googled with data recovery, so many softwares were found: easeus data recovery wizard, easy recovery , active, undeleted.
i dont know which is the best one to buy, i dont have too much money.
somebody recommend easeus, i have gone to his website, maybe it is a cost-effective one.
is there any more suggestion before i purchase easeuss.
