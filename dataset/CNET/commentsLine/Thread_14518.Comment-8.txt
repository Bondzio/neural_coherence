plate.
you are totally misunderstanding the purpose of the insulating washersa.
they are for the sole purpose od preventing the screwheads of the mounting screws from ruining the printed circuitry around the mounting holes.
each of these holes are plated through holes and contact the inner ground plane of the mobo [a mobo has four layers, some new ones have six].
this plane is connected to the mounting plate via the intimate contact between the bottom side of the mobo mounting holes and the hex standoffs which contact the mounting plate.
all of the mounting holes with plating around them are tied to each other in the mobo.
the monting screws do not carry the ground currents, they simply apply the constant pressure needed to insure a good quality low rf noise contact between the grounding rings and the mounting plate.
