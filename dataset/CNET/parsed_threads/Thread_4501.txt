<s> Hi I have an old PC - p3 lying at home - really slow right now. </s>
<s> have been thinking of upgrading it - since i have installed a cd-rw and bought a new monitor. </s>
<s> i have been trying to figure out a way of upgrading the processor and changing the motherboard - but being absolutely non-techie - i am totally clueless on how to go about buying a motherboard? </s>
<s> some basic questions: - does buying a motherboard only help - i presume not: but just trying to confirm? </s>
<s> - what all should i buy if i would like to upgrade from my current p3 system to a p4 system? </s>
<s> any brand recommendations for each item? </s>
<s> any inputs would be helpful! </s>
<s> It's not practical. </s>

<s> You could build a new computer using a few of the parts from you old one, like CD drive, monitor, mouse,keyboard and maybe the case, but new PS. </s>
<s> Everything else would have to be new. </s>
<s> Your choice. </s>
