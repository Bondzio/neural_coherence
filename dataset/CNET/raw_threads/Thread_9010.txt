It gets about 98% done and I get a write error. I'm thinkin' it's just crud buildup since no one uses a floppy very often. Maybe I should just pay $4 for a new drive? Cleaning would be cool though. Is it possible?

The cleaning diskettes were much more common back when the drives were much more expensive.

Dip the Q-Tip in Isopropal Alcohol and insert the Q-Tip between the read heads and gently scrub in a back and forth motion. While you are in a cleaning mode, spray a shot of WD-40 on the two micro switches on the lower right and left of the insert slot. This degunks the plastic fingers of the micro switches that tells your machine what type of media 720/1.44 (right switch looking in), and if it is write protected (left switch).
