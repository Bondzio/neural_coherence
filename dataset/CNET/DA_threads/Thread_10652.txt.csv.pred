1.1.1	I have a hard drive enclosure with FireWire ports on it..	St
1.1.2	I know I can cascade, BUT: Can I hook up this drive to two computers (running WinXP and Win 2003) at the same time with FireWire?	St
1.1.3	Will both Windows recognize them (will it handle priorities etc)?	St
1.2.1	Make firewire connected hard disks reliable.	St
1.2.2	Some will write it works but given how many I see each year (almost equal to USB drives) and that we had firsthand experience of total wipeouts for no good reason I'll write &quot;don't.&quot; Feel free to try but don't store anything that you can't lose on them.	St
1.2.3	Then again, when I connect to an Apple, we'll go firewire everytime.	St
1.2.4	&quot;Can I hook up this drive to two computers (running WinXP and Win 2003) at the same time with FireWire?	St
1.2.5	Will both Windows recognize them (will it handle priorities etc)?&quot; Absolutely not.	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	I'm going to try this out, but yes definetly no vital data will be stored I know Linux handles this: [Setting Up Linux with FireWire-Based Shared Storage for Oracle9i RAC] http://www.oracle.com/technology/oramag/webcolumns/2003/techarticles/coekaertsfirewiresetup.html You can actually have more than two servers connected to the storage via FireWire at the same time..	St
1.3.2	It would be kind of cool to have a shared hard drive at home with all the MP3s.. Not much writing, mostly reading..	St
1.3.3	So they wouldn't have to struggle for access rights that much..	St
1.4.1	&quot;Neither Oracle nor any other vendor currently supports the patch; it is intended for testing and demonstration only.&quot; It's not something native to most if not all Linux setups.	St
1.4.2	Microsoft is even moreso unlikely to work proper since it's OS will never expect the filesystem to be shared.	St
1.4.3	Just like a trainwreck, this may be fun to watch.	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	COMPLETE FAILURE I connected an external hard drive to two computers (WinXP and Win 2003) via FireWire..	St
1.5.2	Both PCs would not even detect the hard drive.	St
1.5.3	One at a time they would and when you hook up the second cable, the first computer would disconnect (and second one wouldn't find the drive)..	St
1.5.4	So I didn't even get in the fun stuff of testing simult.	St
1.5.5	writing etc Too bad.	St
1.5.6	By the way, Windows 2003 is not too good with plug-and-play FireWire..	St
1.5.7	It would ocassionally not detect it and I had to 'Add New HardWare'.. Plus is you boot it with hard drive attached it would often just freeze.. No problems with WinXP though.	St
1.5.8	Proves yet again that 2003 and XP are very different OSs and they just look similar.	St
