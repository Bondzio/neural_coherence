<s> Hi, I want to know that the difference between Hp ink cartridges and Epson ink cartridges? </s>
<s> HP uses thermal and Epson piezo electric to excel the ink from the ink cart. </s>
<s> Most ink carts use the thermal method. </s>
<s> The use of piezo, typically allows for more ink &quot;jets&quot; to be available. </s>
<s> In simple terms or effect: thermal = heat ink until it squirts out piezo = electrical charge to squeeze ink out tada -----Willy </s>
