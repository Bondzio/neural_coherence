actually, it turns out that it is just a problem in the hdd, it must have received some damage.
this problem now happens regardless of the amout of drives that i have connected, as i bsoded on my last boot without the dvd drives connected, and the situation is degrading with each reboot.
i'm just gonna backup the data and get a new hdd.
it seems to be the only solution.
thanks for the help everyone, it was much appreciated.
