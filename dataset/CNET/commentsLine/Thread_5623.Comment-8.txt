i agree with bob.
you need to have something which signals to the player.
which can be an external drive case.
i use a thumb reader & slide an sdhc card in.
the stereo says that it can read fat or fat32 & up to 1000 files per directory.
what does the owner's manual say about your player?
just to note, i did try plugging in an external drive for shi* & giggles, i got my 2.5&quot; (former laptop) drive to play.
it was in a case i got from geeks for cheap.
it worked fine.
it was/is only 8 gigs in size & i didn't care if the data on there was erased.
my concern would be if there is enough power from your player to properly feed the drive, & where you are going to put the drive so it's protected (not just from thieves).
that is, bumps, over extreme internal car heat, & freezing etc.
the drives aren't made for that useage, laptop drives are ;}).
good luck & i hope you come out of your car before the last song on a tb plays...
whew!!
