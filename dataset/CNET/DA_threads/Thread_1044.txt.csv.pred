1.1.7	Does anyone know what the problem is or how to fix it.	Ques
1.1.8	Im thinking of trying some Data Recovery software.	St

1.2.1	Check this forum to discover that FAT32 on USB is not to be trusted.	St
1.2.2	Next time a NTFS for the PC, and native for the MAC.	St
1.2.3	Don't count on FAT32 volumes to stick around so never store anything you need to keep there.	St
1.2.4	Look at data recovery software such as Zero Assumption Recovery.	St
