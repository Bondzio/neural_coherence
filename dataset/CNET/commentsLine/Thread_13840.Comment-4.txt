type thumbs.db on google.com remember it does not matter it worked before.
microsoft and who else updates software on your pc and without notice you may find stuff stop working.
i don't duplicate web content about thumbs.db but point out that's where the thumbnails are cached.
there is a setting in explorer to turn that off and maybe, just maybe it will help.
to find that setting (remember you are in a hardware forum) i'd google this -&gt; windows explorer thumbnail cache setting there's another fun issue that happens in windows where the temporary internet files cache gets so many entries.
what some don't know is the interaction of ie and explorer.
but let's skip to that cure.
clear the tif.
