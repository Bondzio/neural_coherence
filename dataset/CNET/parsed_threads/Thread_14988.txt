<s> I have a 4 year old Compaq Presario, speed is only 960Mh Pentium. </s>
<s> Motherboard went out and I already bought new PC. </s>
<s> I want to replace MB myself for a backup box. </s>
<s> Where can I order one and are they easy to replace? </s>
<s> I'm handy with tools and have added memory and removed my power supply before. </s>
<s> Very few of the presario's used a standard size motherboard. </s>
<s> As this is the case, let me share I picked up a Compaq Deskpro EN 1Ghz with 128MB RAM, 20GB HD, CDROM and onboard sound, 4MB Video, ethernet, serial, USB times 2, parallel port for under 199. </s>
<s> I did it only because it included a Windows 2000 license which is worth about that much. </s>
<s> What my post is abour is that you want to shop with extreme care if you want to recycle what you think is still good in that box. </s>
