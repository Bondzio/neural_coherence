How do I check if something else is wrong?
My first burner was on my old computer - that one was fairly cheap.
The other one automatically came on my Alienware computer, so I don't know how much that one cost.
I've seen searching on the internet on drives for the burner but that hasn't worked.
Thanks for replying so quick !
