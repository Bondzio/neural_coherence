<s> I am researching equipment to set up my home network so that I can stream HD video and play PS3 games unline without lag. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any recommendations on wireless routers? </s>
<s> I want to get the best of the best. </s>
<s> So far I am looking at Buffalo AirStation AC1300/N900 Gigabit Dual Band WZR-D1800H. </s>
<s> Also, I have been reading up on the USB 2.0 to 3.0 change. </s>
<s> Is this transition worth it? </s>
<s> For storage I use two Western Digital 1 Terabyte external hardrives. </s>
<s> with setting up this new network Im also trying to see what other external hardrives might be better in terms up uploading speed,to support streaming. </s>
<s> Basically I am looking to redo my entire network which consist of two WD external Hardrive Terabytes/ 2.0 USB and a Linksys wireless N router from 2006. any recommendations would be great! </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I've yet to see anything short of being at Google HQ to be without lag. </s>
<s> It's more of a matter of your location and internet connection lag (speed is nice, but lag is not directly related to speed!) </s>
<s> But about your USB 3.0 question. </s>
<s> USB 3.0 is nice when it works but if you've followed the screams you know to not count on that. </s>
<s> Here we use USB 2.0 since for the usual work it's fine. </s>
<s> And more than fast enough to play HD content. </s>
<s> -&gt; I read you are setting up a NAS so be sure you don't over invest in NAS boxes. </s>
<s> All the reviews you read seem to dis such on speed. </s>
<s> Here we dedicated a netbook as a server and it handily bests most NAS boxes and routers. </s>

<s> Location and internet connection even when dealing with internal network streaming? </s>
<s> I should probably note that this is an area in which I am still learning, so could you elaborate on this because would have assumed that location and speed should only affect dowloading content. </s>
<s> I see your point on the 2.0 to 3.0 transition. </s>
<s> from what i have read so far you need 3.0 to 3.0 to work correctly in addition to a 3.0 usb cord to connect the two. </s>
<s> I would think that therotically this should help as my network is setup with two external hardrives connecting into my computer. </s>
<s> My fix to this would be getting a 2 terabyte 3.0 external hardrive and connecting it with a 3.0 cord into a 3.0 slot on my desktop. </s>
<s> I bring all this up as I have a ton of movies in which I hope to stream to my tv via PS3 or Western Digital Live TV box. </s>
<s> However, with my corrent set up it lags throughout the movie. </s>
<s> This is expected as much of my equipment is outdated and needs updated. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> Location still matters for streaming as what if your ISP has a small pipe to get all it's subscribers access to Netflix? </s>
<s> But it sounds as if SPEED is the issue an not lag. </s>
<s> Lag in video games upsets the player as they click the button and the delay means they may not get the shot. </s>
<s> SPEED helps when streaming as it keeps the video player's buffer full. </s>
<s> However if you have a member running some torrent then we have to wait for you to realize what cures that one. </s>
<s> There's also better streamers and apps. </s>
<s> I'm beginning to see the makers &quot;get a clue&quot; today as my Kindle Fire HD can download a movie in advance of the time I want to play it. </s>
<s> This means I am not as subject to speed issues as its buffer is huge. </s>
<s> Let's hope more streaming players are increasing those buffers. </s>
