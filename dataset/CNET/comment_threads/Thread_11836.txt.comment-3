the qx9650 debuted Nov 12. it's the first desktop penryn chip and clocks in at 3ghz (same clock speed as qx6850).
they'll be hard to find for about a month or so since the big system builders usually snatch up the initial allotments.
the rest of the penryn quad core lineup will start showing up in late Dec to early Jan. all new quad core chips will be in the q9000 series and the q6000 series will be completely superseded.
