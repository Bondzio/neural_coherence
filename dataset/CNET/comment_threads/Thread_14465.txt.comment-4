Annoying.

For bragging rights.

Great if you run a 64-bit OS (most of us will use 32-bit Windows) 4.
Results in calls to the maker asking why all the RAM doesn't show.
There is so little payoff past 2GB that unless it's free I stop at 2GB.
The basic machine I'd like to see is any Core 2 Duo (GHz is what you want to pay for or not), 2GB RAM, some 3D card, etc.
HP should have a very nice QUAD CORE at your price.
That would be the no-brainer selection.
Just do that.
