1.1.1	Hello, I want to erase my hard drive.	St
1.1.2	I used Shred Disk and used the Algorithm with 7 passes.	St
1.1.3	I selected clean my C: drive.	St
1.1.4	My question is, is shred disk enough to prevent hackers to gain access to my information such as CC numbers, visited websites, passwords etc.. From my understanding shred disk cleans data on free disks.	St
1.1.5	is there any where else this data could be getting stored?	St
1.1.6	Also I heard using encyption software can help protect me.	St
1.1.7	Is there any software you can recommend, preferably free?	Ques
1.1.8	im not really sure how encyption works so a how to or a explanation would be great as well!	St
1.1.9	thanks for all the help!!	Polite
1.1.10	!	St
1.2.1	SHRED as noted at http://www.digitalissues.co.uk/html/os/misc/shred.html#Shred does not work on &quot;C:&quot; but on entire drives or a partition.	St
1.2.2	If you ran this on C:, then the machine would be nonoperational for most users.	St
1.2.3	If you didn't wipe out the entire machine, there are places Windows stores information that few would know about.	St
1.2.4	For example http://forums.cnet.com/7723-6132_102-119247.html OK, that's one of how many places Windows keeps information you want gone.	St
1.2.5	So there it is, there is no way known today to wipe out all the nooks and crannies without a drive wipe and starting over.	St
