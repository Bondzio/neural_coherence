I was wondering If i can make my external hard drive use the same drive every time I plug it in, For example drive G: or anything like that, every time I unplug it and plug it back in, it turns into I different drive, and then i have to delete all my music off of Itunes, and reinstall them, for them to play, since I have all my music on my external hard drive, Thanks in advance.
