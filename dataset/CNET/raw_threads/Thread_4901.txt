I just went to access the one with Vista on it and it says NTLDR file is missing. But if I access it with out the other hard drives connected I can get through. Could some one help me out please.

For instance my main drive is a WD 74 gig 10,000 rpm HD XP. So I have &gt; 1st boot set as SCSI Snd boot set as CDrom 3rd boot set as Floopy and then I have it set on Sata To get to my other HD XP. I just change the 1st boot to HDD and leave all the rest the same. To get to my HD with Vista on it I Change 1st boot to SCSI 2nd boot to CDrom 3rd boot to Floopy and put it on Raid And I have one hard drive with know operating system on it for storage. The other night I unlocked all my hard drives from my main drive which has XP on it and did a through maintenance and ran Avast and I deleted a trojan from my Vist hard drive and I wondered if that was my problem wiht my Vista hard drive. I was not having problems with it before. Wendell H

Either issue has you looking at XP/otherOS repair procedures. Just look at google.com and links about NTLDR and your error message. I won't repeat prior discussions about this but wonder how you get around the item I've run into. Bob

The only tip I did not take until last was the one about changing hardware the easiest one. I took out my storage drive to put in a larger HD, and to do that I had to remove two raid cables. 1)One to the HD I was replacing with a larger HD 2) One That had Vista RC1 on it. I got the cables switched up, and that what was causing me to get that error message. Well I did not have to do what I usualy do is to reinstall the operating system. Which it would not made a difference. I Thank You For Your Help Wendell H

I am working on that now to see exactly how I am going to do that and what software I am going to use. Having a partion recovery would save me a lot off time when I do not have to install software and updates. Trying to make a decision on which software to use to help me make a partion or have another HD to install my operating system and software from. I have read this article bellow. http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2014359,00.asp Thank You: Wendell H

Even with partition and drive backup software let's take the scenario of moving a partition from one machine to another. One machine had the XP partition (working) on a second drive. The new machine will have it as the boot drive. No tool today can move the partition and have the OS boot. The activation issue is not the issue here and you'll likely see the NTLDR message. Keep at this and you'll discover this is one of those areas. Maybe a better plan is to backup our stuff but install the OS and programs? In closing, one word. ACRONIS. Bob

I went to Acronis site and read some more there besides reading the article on Cnet. It said it could make an exact copy off your HD. I will purchase this software.
