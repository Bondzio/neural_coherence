hey all, i'm thinking of purchasing the motorola xoom but i am a bit tentative so i need advice.
the last motorola device i owned was the motorola dext/cliq.
motorola just ignored this phone and left it with bugs and on like android 0.0.0.1 will they keep a decent support for the motorola xoom?
especially as the xoom 2 must be coming soon... also, i'm mainly going to be using it for browsing the internet and maybe doing some college work, will it be good at both those things?
are there better alternatives in the same price range?
thanks for taking the time to read this
