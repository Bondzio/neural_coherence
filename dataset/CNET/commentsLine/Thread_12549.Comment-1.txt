hey guys first post and it'd be awesome if i got some help.
i'll try explaining in steps what the problem is.
-playstation 3 got the yellow light of death(seems to be an overheating issues) -i called sony and they would send me a box but i need to get all my save files off my hard drive as i have some games with upto 80 hours on there.
(yes i know i'm an idiot for not backing up recently i already beat myself up for that) -i bought a usb to ide/sata adapter to try and get the data off -to get the drive to recognize i had to partition and format(really stupid of me i think) -nothing was on the drive when it finally did get recognized -i used easeus data recovery wizard professional 4.3.6 to try and get the data off but all i got was .gzip(17.5 gigs) files.
-also, if you're wondering why i didn't just keep the drive and send the ps3 to sony.
sony would send me a refurb unit and with the ps3 it asks you to reformat once you put a drive into the console that it wasn't originally on(same problem if i just took the hdd and put it into a friends ps3 to get data off) is there anything at all i can do to try and get my files off that hard drive?
thank you so much for your help =(
