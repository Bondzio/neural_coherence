Now they have chosen the Athlon X2 TK-53. I cant find much info on this processor other than the clock speed of 1.7Ghz. Can someone point me to unbiased reviews or possibly some benchmarks? I also posted in Laptop section, because I was unsure which forum would cover this. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks Mike
