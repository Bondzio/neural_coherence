<s> I just upgraded from Win98SE to XP Pro and I can't find a driver for my Gateway keyboard (model # 7001211). </s>
<s> Gateway's website has a driver for newer keyboards and I downloaded one which I thought would work but no such luck. </s>
<s> I visited Microsoft's website and they didn't have anything of any use either. </s>
<s> Suggestions? </s>
<s> Microsoft will supply basic keyboard functionality so no keyboard driver is required. </s>
<s> Looking to Microsoft for Gateway support would a frustrating waste of time. </s>
<s> Maybe you didn't write what said driver would do? </s>
<s> Drivers get things working. </s>
<s> In the case of a keyboard, not so much a ''driver'' but a keyboard enhancer (not a driver!) </s>
<s> is what some are looking for. </s>
<s> The difference is there and be sure you are looking for the right software. </s>

<s> Your thoughts are greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I didn't think about the difference between a driver or some enhancements. </s>
<s> The keyboard does work but the internet/multimedia keys won't work since upgrading to XP-Pro. </s>
<s> I'm going to visit Gateway again. </s>
<s> thanks Denny </s>
