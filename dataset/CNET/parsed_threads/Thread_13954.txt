<s> I bought a refurbished Dell P3 1 Gig a few years ago. </s>
<s> I think it was about 2000 or 1999. </s>
<s> I'm still using it. </s>
<s> It still works fairly well. </s>
<s> I added 256 meg of memory for 512 total and now use Windows XP. </s>
<s> I think I can use it for at least another 3 or 4 years which may be 10 at that point in time. </s>
<s> It had just about everything on it that was recommended at that point in time, DVDROM, 1394 IEEE Firewire, USB,and memory. </s>
<s> I'd say if you get somrthing with a similar configuration today withenough memory, a nearly new processor chip, DVD & burner, HD, warranty, etc., you could get 10 years out of a Dell refurb. </s>
<s> They usually are new computers that were returned and not used much if at all and then get checked out to meet new specs. </s>
<s> Generally, it's been a good experience with this pc and I think I've gotten a little more usefulness out of it than I thought I would. </s>
<s> It all depends on your needs. </s>
<s> For running basic 32 bit apps., a 1 Ghz system is still adequate. </s>
<s> However with the newer 64 bit technology now on the scene, many new apps. </s>
<s> are sure to follow. </s>
<s> It will be over a period of years, but most will have to upgrade. </s>
<s> Like you, I have an older 1.1 Ghz Dell Dimension 2100, that's in use at my office. </s>
<s> I received notice today, from the software software supplier (that I use for business), that they will be upgrading the program. </s>
<s> I will receive the newer release at no extra charge. </s>
<s> It's faster, with many more tools and options. </s>
<s> The only problem is that my trusty old Dell is already at minimum requirements. </s>
<s> That means if I want to use the new program, I'll have to upgrade to a faster machine. </s>
<s> It's been very reliable for over six years, but it looks like retirement for the old boy. </s>
<s> Unfortunally, the 64-bit blockade will prevent you from using your computer for no more than 2 years unless cpu is 64-bit. </s>
<s> Also, Windows Vista is hardware demanding. </s>
<s> Then there's the stupid DRM issue. </s>
<s> So it may not work at all, but who knows? </s>
<s> Now when you say &quot;use a computer for 10 years&quot;, how do you use it? </s>
<s> I have a 10 year old PC that runs fine for Word, but it won't run any of the latest software or games. </s>
<s> But refurbs are a great buy. </s>
