<s> I'm looking for info on what is the best motherboard to buy for athlon processors, if anyone could help please do. </s>
<s> what size cpu you are going to use, and what you need. </s>
<s> I have always used boards made by Biostar before but just did an XP 3200+ with this board http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=13-131-478&catalog=22&manufactory=BROWSE&depa=1 and love it. </s>
<s> Thay are all good anymore, you may get a DOA from any Company. </s>
<s> I just built a system and used a Shuttle AN 35N-400 with an AMD 2400+ XP. </s>
<s> Six USB-2 ports, onboard sound, NIC, and other goodies. </s>
<s> Very happy with it. </s>
<s> http://us.shuttle.com/specs.asp?pro_id=280 </s>
<s> WWW.tomshardware.com and / or www.anandtech.com and read the tests and reports on all of the choices there. </s>
<s> I have a Shuttle Spacewalker Apollo Board with VIA chipset and onboard sound and I've got smokin' benchmarks. </s>
<s> From PC PitStop my lowest score was 82 percentile, several scores were 100 percentile and up to 3 times the average score for the same processor, video card & memory configuration. </s>
<s> I highly recommend Shuttle for it's quality to cost ratio, but if you want to check out tests on boards with all the bells and whistles go to Tom'sHardware.com or throw a mobo number like A7V8X into Google search with the words Benchmark and Review. </s>
<s> The testing sites usually compare about 4 mobos at a time. </s>
<s> If you are going all the way up to a 64-bit processor, rather than a regular Athlon XP, just remember the NForce3 chipset chokes out at 600MHZ memory bandwidth, while the VIA goes all the way up to 800MHz. </s>
<s> That is a noticable difference for the paired ECC hyperthreaded memory. </s>
<s> For the regular Athlon XP that tops out at 400MHZ bandwidth, They say the performance between the 333MHz & 400MHZ chipsets end up nearly identical. </s>
<s> If you are going really inexpensive but not cheapo on performance, the old Athlon Thunderbird 1.4 GHZ is almost comparable to the Athlon XP 2700+. </s>
<s> You can probably pick that up already mounted on a board for not much over a hundred bucks. </s>
