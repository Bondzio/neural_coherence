yes i've heard the argument that the fixes are masks and not fixes.
the sad truth is that the real fix is to fix the hardware and driver.
but most companies will not do that so we are left with the disable and then the usb port comes back to some usable state.
why play the don quixote part here?
that is, i know your stance and wish you well.
