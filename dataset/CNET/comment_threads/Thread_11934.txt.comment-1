Hey guys..
I have an Acer AL1916fbd , and I was wondering how I would go about connecting a videogame console with component outputs to my LCD.
The recommended resolution on my monitor is 1280x1024.
I have heard that I should get a VGA Box, Scan Converter, Transcoder...
I dunno , I believe these are different names for the same type of product.
Can anyone help me??
Thanks!
