My wife faced the same thing: many VCR tapes of instructional videos that she wanted to convert to digital format.
We went to Best Buy and bought a DVD recorder that also had a VCR deck.
Dubbing tapes to DVD is a cinch, though you do have to do that in real time.
Once you have the DVDs burned, you can use software (I use a DVD ripper from Xilisoft) to rip those DVDs into smaller MPEGs if you want.
But I suspect you just want DVDs of the tapes, so the dual deck is the way to go.
Not expensive either.
