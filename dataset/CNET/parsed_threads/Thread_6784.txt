<s> I'm running a wireless network for 3 computers (2 XP and one Me) and all 3 computers are able to access the internet via the wireless router. </s>
<s> However, I haven't been able to setup a working home network for sharing files, etc. </s>
<s> I've made several attempts to use the MS XP software (Setup home or office network) to setup a network without success. </s>
<s> I wondering if anyone can recommend a reasonable software package that would support XP and ME in setting up a home network. </s>
<s> I DON'T want to upgrade the ME computer to XP because of hardware issues. </s>
<s> Nearly 100% of the time I find a firewall in place. </s>
<s> It's working and the disable in ZoneAlarm doesn't turn it off. </s>
<s> Then you have IFC to contend with as well. </s>
<s> http://www.practicallynetworked.com/qa/qa20040212.shtml notes some other points. </s>
<s> Best of luck, and I can network just fine with Windows 98/ME/2000/XP and Linux, so it's not these OSes that are the issue. </s>
