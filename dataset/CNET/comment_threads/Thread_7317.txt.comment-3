What do you by chance mean?
You shifted the computer to a new location?
If so, sounds like loose cable somewhere internally, either on your harddisk side or motherboard size.
Check all cables internally are connected securely which could have came off while moving, else, it seems quite bad news to me regarding your harddisk.
In your bios, is your motherboard able to detect the harddisk?
If no, your harddisk may have it's cable loose, or worst, damaged.
If yes, your partition may have crashed big.
If you can remove the harddisk, test it on another system as an external or something to see you can save off important files before doing anything else.
