1.1.1	I have about 5 computers throughout the house and is all hooked up to my router through cat5 cables or wireless .	St
1.1.2	How do i setup so I can share a folder through my LAN ?	Ques
1.2.1	Turn off any firewalls on all PCs for the local network .	St
1.2.2	Make sure printer and file sharing for MS networks is enabled in your network device settings .	Sug
1.2.3	Decide on what you want to share or create a share on each PC .	St
1.2.4	Generally this will be a folder or other folders with or without subfolders .	St
1.2.5	Turn sharing on for these .	St
1.2.6	Make sure each user that will have access to the shares has an account defined on each PC .	St
1.2.7	Give that account the same username/password on each .	St
1.2.8	These steps will get you started but I ca n't guarantee more tweaking wo n't be needed .	St
1.2.9	You did n't provide the OS and version .	St
1.2.10	XP Pro and Home will have some differences that could cause connection issues but these can be worked out .	St
1.2.11	Start here and post back with progress if you need more help .	St
1.3.1	Okay .	St
1.3.2	im using windows Xp home .	St
1.3.3	I got all the shared stuff done so im okay .	St
1.3.4	Im wondering if under the my network .	St
1.3.5	Is the shared folder suppose to be under internet or local network ?	Ques
1.3.6	Mine is under internet .	St
1.3.7	And whats the dealie with teh username and password ?	Ques
1.4.1	It should show under My Network Places/Entire Network/Microsoft Windows Network .	St
1.4.2	I believe the default name is & quot ; Home & quot ; but you can change that .	St
1.4.3	I did forget to mention that each PC needs to have a unique name to identify it on the network .	St
1.4.4	When XP is installed , if you do n't give it a name , it generates a nonsense one .	St
1.4.5	Anyway , give each PC a name you will recognize .	St
1.4.6	Then , when you click on the local network name , all the PCs should appear .	St
1.4.7	I 'll also recommend that drag the local network icon to your desktop to save a couple of steps each time you access it .	St
1.4.8	As for username/password , authentication works better if all PCs have a common user .	St
1.4.9	This does n't mean other users need to be defined on all but XP .	St
1.4.10	Often & quot ; access denied & quot ; messages are traceable to authentication issues .	St
1.4.11	Much is determined by how permissions are set up .	St
1.4.12	I must admit to being more familiar with Pro than Home .	St
1.4.13	Home might be less restrictive in its default settings .	St
1.4.14	I 'd suggest you first work on getting the entire network to present itself on all PCs and have the shares visible .	St
1.4.15	Other details can be worked out after you get to that point .	St
1.5.1	Okay now I have a laptop but take it to my dorm and at home .	St
1.5.2	When im at home I want the sharing but when Im at the dorms I dont want to share .	St
1.5.3	Im using vista premium .	St
1.5.4	Am I able to make it share only when it connects to a certain network ... For example my network is called guard ( its private ) .	St
1.5.5	Am I able to have it only enable when it connect to guard ?	Ques
1.6.1	so Vista will add a new twist .	St
1.6.2	Sorry but do n't know Vista myself but this should n't be too difficult .	St
1.6.3	The first thing I would do is run this by your college help desk folks .	St
1.6.4	It should be their job to control network traffic on that system .	St
1.6.5	Secondly , you need to set up permissions anyway .	St
1.6.6	Just do n't set them up to allow everyone full access .	St
1.6.7	Use defined users that require a password for access .	St
1.6.8	It 's also possible to set up different user profiles for the home and away .	St
1.6.9	While you can not eliminate hacking attempts , you can make it not worth the effort .	St
