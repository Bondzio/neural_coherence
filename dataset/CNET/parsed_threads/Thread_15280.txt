<s> But many versions of Windows, including Windows XP has System Restore to go back to when it was OK. Bob </s>
<s> iv restored but it hasnt done the job thankyou anyway T </s>
<s> There are dozen of realtek drivers and some require MSUAA. </s>
<s> To save time supply the details of make, model, OS and which Service Pack is installed. </s>

<s> can you tell me what OS means &amp; how do i find out what it is &amp; does (service pack) mean xp, windows? </s>
<s> Thankyou for your help T </s>
<s> Not to be belittle you, but to ask about OS and service pack, suggest you're a novice. </s>
<s> So, take into account that answers may seem aloft, they're not. </s>
<s> OS = operating system service pack = OS updates issued by bundle or large releases If you use XP, then the most latest service pack is #, thus SP3. </s>
<s> Check the control panel under device manager and under the typical 1st display will show the version you're running. </s>
<s> As for finding out anything else about your PC, I suggest you get the pgm., called PCWizard 2010 or 2011 and download it and use. </s>
<s> Its free and reports alot about your PC. </s>
<s> As already stated to you the realtek audio comes in various versions, so it makes sense tyo get the right one. </s>
<s> Thus, using PCWizard and/or similar pgm. </s>
<s> will help in that regard. </s>
<s> Follow its basic advise and proceed accordingly. </s>
<s> If you have one, use your original PC install disc that supplies drivers and/or mtrbd. </s>
<s> chipset drivers. </s>
<s> This is NOT the OS restore/recovery though it maybe part of it. </s>
<s> IN XP, find info: click start-&gt;control panel-&gt;system-&gt;system properties-&gt;review display tada -----Willy </s>
