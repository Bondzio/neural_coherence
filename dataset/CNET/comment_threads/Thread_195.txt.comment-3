Almost anything is possible.
How much money do you have?
Rough math.
Mid tower case............................80 bucks Mid range vid card........................100 bucks Psu to support the new vid card...........80 bucks I would suggest that you test the new machine as is.
If it does everything you need it to do and the only problem is that you don't like the looks of the case......put something in front of it so you can't see it......be frugal!
