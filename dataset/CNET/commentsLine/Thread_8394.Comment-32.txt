i had to repair a hp pavilion 6835 system.
its an older system and it would just shutdown and reboot.
upon inspection, i found the psu fan was seized.
this is a mini-psu with a fan exposed to the outside of the psu box but within the system case.
this in turn blows directly onto the cpu hsf.
i cleaned the hsf as good as new.
i had a used psu to install to replace the old psu as the caps were also bad, thus i wouldn't trust old psu.
installed and still the system would repeat failure.
i then noticed the psu fan was reverse of the what the old psu had as mounted.
i then reverse the new psu fan to be correct.
the system now runs well and doesn't falter.
i has also refreshed the cpu paste as the thermal tape had dried-up and wasn't as effective.
so, it all depends on how a system is build to handle its &quot;airflow&quot; and just what works in one system won't necessary in another.
in this cases the cpu hsf needed the extra cooling provided by the psu fan.
fyi- the old replacement psu came from an emachine system.
