1.1.1	I have a iMac hand me down from my dear brother .	St
1.1.2	It has never failed me .	St
1.1.3	I love it and I love Mac .	St
1.1.4	However it is time for me to move on to a laptop so I can be more productive in my business .	St
1.1.5	I have been out of the computer shopping game for a while ... in fact I do n't think I have ever bought a computer in a store , just second hand or hand me down .	St
1.1.6	So I am coveting the MacBook because the size and the dual platform capabilities so I can finally use some of the business software that is only made for Windows .	St
1.1.7	I do n't think I have ever done as much research as I am doing before I lay down it seems almost $ 3,000 after you add in all the necessary stuff ( memory , ram , parallel , applecare ) and the bells and whistles ( airport express , speakers ) .	St
1.1.8	It 's a lot of money .	St
1.1.9	Anyway to this point I have a couple of options as where to make my purchase and could use some other consumer feedback .	St
1.1.10	My options are : - of course the Apple Store - macmall.com - are bundles more affordable ?	Ques
1.1.11	if so which should I get ?	Ques
1.1.12	- Tek Serve ( in Manhattan ) - a one-stop shop , very knowledgeable and helpful - a professor friend at a University - gets a mac discount - or your recommendation of a legitimate online or store source Thanks in advance for your help .	St
1.1.13	I need to get this thing in the next couple of weeks .	St
1.2.1	you will find that any of your mentioned sources will be fine .	St
1.2.2	I have experience with all of them apart from Tek Serve .	St
1.2.3	Oh yes , my professor was not the same one as yours .	St
1.2.4	There never seem to be that many & quot ; bundles & quot ; on MacBooks but if you see one , and the machine meets your requirements in all other respects , you should go for it .	St
1.2.5	Oh yes , get the AppleCare on this product .	St
1.2.6	One cracked screen and you will have paid for it over and over .	St
1.2.7	Just my 10c Good Luck P	St
1.3.1	Thank you for your initial help .	St
1.3.2	Here are the macmall.com bundles : http : //www.macmall.com/macmall/families/macbook/ are any of them really a deal though ?	Ques
1.3.3	And while I have you do you have any recommendations on how to save a little money ?	Ques
1.3.4	Also , should I be waiting for the next generation of the macbook ?	Ques
1.3.5	could you tell me the most optimal configuration for small business ( business plan writing , creating brochures , web design and management ) and personal use ( lots of pictures , tons of music , web surfing , file sharing ) .	St
1.3.6	You will be the final piece of my research .	St
1.3.7	Thanks again .	St
1.4.1	On the link you supplied , I would not bother with a bundle unless you plan to run Windows .	St
1.4.2	Try the other Mail order places like CDW , MacWarehouse .	St
1.4.3	( I think that is still in business ) A bundle with extra memory and/or a printer would be reasonable .	St
1.4.4	You will always benefit from extra memory .	St
1.4.5	& quot ; Recommendations on how to save a little money & quot ; ... .Do n't buy a computer , I just saved you a thousand bucks ! .	St
1.4.6	The next generation of MacBook is already here , it arrived about a month or so ago .	St
1.4.7	You are looking at buying the optimal configuration for everything you mentioned .	St
1.4.8	Unlike Windows , OS X only comes in one flavor , there are no special OS types , they are all the same , right across the board .	St
1.4.9	Good luck .	Polite
1.4.10	Only you can make the final choice .	St
1.4.11	Let us know what you decide and how you get on P	St
