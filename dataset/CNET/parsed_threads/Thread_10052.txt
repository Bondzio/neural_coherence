<s> I have two computers side by side. </s>
<s> one I do not on the internet at all. </s>
<s> Is there like a USB device to physically connet these two computers to make a quick drag and drop file transfer? </s>
<s> Thanks ceyesuma </s>
<s> Besides a jump drive. </s>
<s> You're still way ahead to use Ethernet cable and network them. </s>
<s> You don't have to have internet access to do so. </s>
<s> If you've got XP, it's still even possible to install NetBeui protocol and transfer files without even having TCP/IP on the one that doesn't go on the internet. </s>
<s> It's not installed by default but is on the XP CD ROM. </s>
<s> Yes there are USB transfer cables. </s>
<s> You can get one here. </s>

<s> If you only link to your own store, you find someone will notice and start cleaning up your posts. </s>
<s> ceyesuma asked about a product that I just happen to sell. </s>
<s> But I see what you mean I'll post a few more location where you can get the product next time. </s>
<s> I only mention it so you'll be in the know and not surprised. </s>
<s> You got the idea on the first try so thank you for that! </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> That's great I will have to explore that one. </s>
<s> How does this work as far as other computers connecting to the internet computer and somehow accessing the networked computer? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> will that work on any OS. </s>
<s> that is exactly what I had in mind. </s>
<s> Thanks again -Steve </s>
<s> It's designed to work on windows XP and Vista. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if it will work on other OSs. </s>
<s> If you need a universal solution. </s>
<s> I would recommend a second Ethernet card. </s>
<s> XP allows you to easily create a home network using a crossover cable between the two, or using a straightthrough cable from a swich to each computer. </s>
<s> This option would give you a much faster transfer speed, you could also share the internet connection this way. </s>
<s> Once the connection is made going throught the creat a new home network wizzard is easy. </s>
<s> From there I would create shared folders, or purhaps share the desktop folder. </s>
