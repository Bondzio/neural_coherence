Here is what I have: Compaq Presario SR1703WM Name AMD Sempron 3200+ Codename Palermo Specification AMD Sempron(tm) Processor 3200+ Package Socket 939 Chip set: Northbridge ATI Xpress 200 (RS480) rev. 10 Southbridge ATI SB400 rev. 00 Motherboard: Mainboard Model Amberine M (0x390 - 0x1DB08328) Can any point me in the right direction for a tool to help or recommend some AMD processors that I can use? Thanks, Ken

I did find one processor AMD-Athlon 64 Single Core 3500+ Processor-2.2GHz-34p1044 from a vendor. It is a step up but if I can get a faster one that is compatible I'm open to that too. This is a hand-me-down computer that I thought might make a good DVR but I do need at least 2.2 GHz to do the job from what Hauppage says. Ken

Sorry if I was unclear. As to DVR, my old 1.0GHz Via C3 based computer does that work. Why would I need more horsepower than that? Bob

As to the DVR I was looking at the Hauppauge HVR 1250 card to process the cable signal and the tech said this: &quot;If that is a single core system then it is recommended to have a 2.2 GHz or higher anything lower can cause issues such as stuttering video. If you have a good video card to pull some of the strain off the CPU then it could possibly work in that system but if not you will most likely experience some issues.&quot; This is digital and analog capable, but I could go down to just analog since I will be recording off my cable. Compaq has integrated video processor which is crap. I'm all ears if you have a better plan. Thanks again, Ken

AMD Athlon 64 3800+ 2.40GHz Processor $30 AMD Athlon 64 4000+ 2.6GHz 512KB L2 Cache Socket AM2 62W Single-Core Processor AMD Athlon LE-1600 (ADH1600DHBOX) 2.2GHz AMD Athlon LE-1620 (ADH1620DHBOX) 2.4GHz $53 AMD Sempron LE-1300 (SDH1300DPBOX)2.3GHz $39 AMD Sempron LE-1250 (SDH1250DPBOX)2.2GHZ $29 AMD Athlon LE-1640 (ADH1640DPBOX) 2.6GHz $38 I think these are all 939 sockets but they also call them AMD2 sockets? I hope you all have some answers for me. Thanks, Ken

11234	8	338636	3023061	3023010	R. Proffitt	4/12/09 3:24 AM	1.23950664E12	That's a good way to approach this.	I agree. TRY the 1250 before you decide a new CPU is required. Most of my DVR speed is all about the hard disk and not the CPU. Bob
11234	9	338636	3023152	3023061	ksgale49	4/12/09 7:18 AM	1.23952068E12	re: That's a good way to approach this.	Good point. That is what I most likely will do, try the HVR 1250 first but at least I have some idea of what processor upgrade I can use if needed and they don't seem to be expensive. The options are not a big jump in speed either 2.2 or 2.4 GHz. What is confusing is socket 939 vs what the AMD site lists sockets AM, AM2 and another one. I wish terms were consistant across the board. Thanks again for the advice. I've bookmarked the wiki links you provided and I will read more. Ken
