hey guys, was hoping i could get soem advice on the parts i picked up and why i should or shouldn't get what i've chosen.
my main gripe is to not get something that is incompatible and have to deal with sending it back out.
i also wanted to buy a soundcard under $100 but to stay under $1600 total.
aaaand i'm looking for a nice sound system with at least 5.1 surround for around $200.
