1.2.1	If a firewall is installed , that 's a common complaint .	St
1.2.2	And to pre-emptively note such , even when disabled , Zone Alarm still interferes with this .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I 've run into similiar problems , particularly with my Pro system ( have 1 98 , 1 XP Home laptop , and my main system with Pro ) .	St
1.3.2	Bob mentioned ZoneAlarm , which I use .	St
1.3.3	In the firewall configuration , I added the ip addresses of all the computers , AND the full range of addresses , e.g , 192.168.2.1-192.168.2.40 .	St
1.3.4	In addition , and this seems to have caused me the most problem , XP 's firewall often automagically turns itself on , so in in the Local Area Connection Properties & gt ; Advanced , I disable the XP firewall .	St
1.3.5	I have the most problems with my Pro system .	St
1.3.6	The 98 system NEVER has a problem , lol .	St
1.3.7	So much for 'upgrades ' .	St
1.3.8	Hope this was of some help .	St
1.4.1	Also , I 've turned off all power management and screensavers , as I 've read this can be an issue with a network .	St
