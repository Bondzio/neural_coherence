i have recently encountred a very weird problem.
i turned off my computer, and came back the next day to find out it didn't work.
the weird thing is, the fans will work and power supply and motherboard fan all turn on when i push the switch, but normally when i push the switch, there's a green light at the front that will light up.
it no longer lights up and my monitor remains completely idle.
can anyone advise me as to what could be the problem.
i've already checdk to make sure the video card is pushed in solidly and i'm really confused.
thanks for your time and my specs are below.
asus p4s8x-x motherboard geforce 4 fx 5600 1 gb of ram 80gb harddrive
