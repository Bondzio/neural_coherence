back to stock clocks, same stuff.
but i just realised something weird.
as i'm watching the fans in the asus program fans sensor both chassis fans just turn off.
i've been so concentrated on the cpu problems i didn't realise.
also the power fan is running at a very low rpm.
if i restart it the chassis fans start up for a bit then turn off.
and as i said before the cpu is fine then all of a sudden starts climbing crazy quick.
does this sound like a problem with the mobo or the power supply unit?
i'm at a loss, this is just becoming harder and harder to find the route of the problem
