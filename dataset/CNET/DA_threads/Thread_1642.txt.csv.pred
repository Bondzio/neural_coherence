1.1.1	I have had my HP computer for a while now and have decided it is undoubtedly time to upgrade .	St
1.1.2	I know I ca n't get much for a price range of strictly $ 500- $ 700 , but can someone help me out ?	Ques
1.1.3	I need to know what is the best computer I can get in terms of HD memory , RAM , Video , and basically just overall stats .	St
1.1.4	Thanks in Advance	St
1.2.1	A budget of ''strictly $ 500- $ 700 . ''	St
1.2.2	Is that just for the computer box , or do you want that to include a new keyboard , mouse , monitor , and speakers ?	Ques
1.2.3	Are you interested in building it yourself ?	Ques
1.3.1	Well , I 'm not exactly computer illiterate but I 'm not up to the task of building one myself .	St
1.3.2	Of course I 'd love it to come with a mouse , keyboard , etc but that 's just asking too much .	St
1.3.3	I just want the best -- computer -- I can get for my price range .	St
1.4.1	If you were happy with your HP , go to their site and you can build your own .	St
1.4.2	I had my wife 's PC within 6 days of ordering , and that was 4 days before they anticipated shipping it .	St
1.4.3	They usually have a rebate and several free upgrades going on .	St
1.4.4	I got her a free HD and CD-RW drive upgrade by procrastinating a day or two .	St
1.5.1	Well , I do like HP but I know theer are some pretty sweet deals on the internet .	St
1.5.2	I 've searched but I ' m just reluctant to buy from seemingly unknown & quot ; companies & quot ; that 's why I 'm here .	St
1.5.3	I do n't need my computer to be brand name ... I just need it to have what I need .	St
1.5.4	Basically my question is , and this may depend on different opinions , what is the best all-around I can get for $ 700 ?	Ques
1.5.5	Thanks foir the suggestions though	St
1.6.1	Buy the components online , from newegg.com , and get a local shop or geek to put it together .	St
1.6.2	Yes , you 'll have to pay them , but you 'll get the best bang for your buck .	St
1.7.1	In order to determine what the best computer would be for your money , we have to know what types of things you do with your computer .	St
1.7.2	Are you a gamer , or like to edit photos or videos , or do you just run home office type apps ?	Ques
1.7.3	A good local system builder could help you determine exactly what your needs are and design a system to meet your needs .	St
1.7.4	i.e. , if you do n't need high end graphics , and an on-board video chip would suffice , you could spend the extra money on memory , hard drive or faster CPU .	St
1.7.5	Spending extra on memory is better than pinching your budget on memory for a faster CPU .	St
1.7.6	Just a few thoughts , hope this helps .	Polite
1.8.1	Well I 'm not a gamer but I play a few games like Knight of the Old Republic which thi computer no longer allows me to use .	St
1.8.2	I need memory because I 'm a frequent downloader , although I do take care of my computer .	St
1.8.3	I would n't mind a better-than-average video card but not somehing top of the line .	St
1.8.4	I 'd also like at least 512-1 GIG RAM since that seems to be the standard now .	St
1.8.5	Someone please help me in choosing a model .	Sug
1.8.6	I 'll answer any other questions if you 'll help me , I just do n't know what to do .	St

1.23.1	I just went to that and reconfigured the PC to my standards , which are n't THAT high , nad the final price was just $ 2 dollars or less off of the Compaq one .	St
1.23.2	And the Compaq price is already including a new video card and power supply .	St
1.23.3	I 'm not going to buy it just yet though , there 's no possible way .	St
1.23.4	Like I said before , I need 371 more dollars so there 's plenty of time for something better to pop up .	St
1.23.5	Until then though , my sights will be set on the Compaq but please , keep suggesting people .	St
1.23.6	I 'm afraid I may have failed to mention a few things I want on the computer : Floppy Drive CD/DVD Burner 1 GB RAM At least 100GB HD I do n't care if it comes with a monitor or speakers .	St
1.23.7	In any case , I 'll just buy one later when I have money , I mean , this monitor and speakers will still work .	St
1.24.1	Any other suggestions for a good computer like the Compaq I picked out ?	Ques
1.24.2	I 'm buying it today or tomorrow so this is my last chance to change my plans .	St
1.24.3	I 'd also like some more opinions on my selections .	St

1.25.1	... It will be good .	Polite
