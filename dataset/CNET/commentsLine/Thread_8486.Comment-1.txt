i recently upgraded from 2k to xp pro and all was well, for awhile.
the system started getting slower and slower and would lock up at times.
i would have to hit reset to get back up.
i ran all the necessary scans on the system and found nothing.
after a few more lockups, i took it to my shop thinking i had bad memory.
changed to new memory and no change.
when turned on one time, i heard a &quot;pop&quot; in the area of the ps.
installed new ps and no change in system performance.
ran the windows task mgr and under performance saw that cpu usage would spike to 95% most of the time and i had nothing running.
i disconnected the network cbl and the usage dropped to 5% max.
everything worked fast again.
put cbl back in and i was back to the same bad performance with 95%+ cpu usage when nothing was running.
i have reinstalled the xp upgrade several times with no change.
thinking it might be the 10/100 adapter on the mobo, i put in a pci card and disabled all the other adapters.
same problem.
i am at a total loss here.
any help would be great!
thanks in advance.
