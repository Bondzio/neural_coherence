I have a Netgear N router in addition to the ATT FIOS box with a Mac and several PC's on the network.
I want to stream movies through my Samsung Blu Ray from Costco which does not have a wireless adapter but can plug hardwire but I can't get cable to the TV area.
Everybody tells me to buy a Roku, but I hate to do it if networking will solve my problem.
Which would you recommend: - Netgear Powerline AV200 adapter XAV2001-bridge or - Netgear Powerline AV 200 Wireless-N Extender Kit XAVNB2001 or is there something else I should be looking at?
