<s> Hey all, I want to know if it is possible, and how is so, to run a server OS or any hosting software from a hard drive that is networked and attached to my router and not to a computer? </s>
<s> I currently have a mixed home network of OSes, Mac OS X SL, 2 Windows 7 machines, and various tablets and smartphones. </s>
<s> I have a 2TB hard drive attached to an Apple Airport Extreme Base Station (current generation.) </s>
<s> The main thing I want the server for is to host for media, iTunes. </s>
<s> The Home Sharing function is kosher for in home network use, but I would like to be able to access my media on from outside as well. </s>
<s> Optimally I would love to have OS X server on just the drive, but if it's possible to do that without having a computer attached I am up for any suggestions that will solve this. </s>
<s> THanks in advance, Jake M </s>
<s> Said server software and in fact &quot;software today&quot; needs a computer or CPU to run on. </s>
<s> I'm unsure where the concept of no-computer but software only ideas come from. </s>
<s> It's quite strange to see this being asked for so no offense but where did this idea come from? </s>
<s> If you are thinking about a NAS, even a NAS has a small computer in the box. </s>
