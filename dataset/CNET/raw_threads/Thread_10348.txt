Some guys have 25 of the same monitor. I know this is not a technical help question but I wonder how they do it. Guess my main question still is whether it is safe and will Dell honor the warranty? Thanks so much for any light on this question. Roy

Just like shopping anywhere, read the customer ratings and make your choice, I have no idea if Dell will honor a warranty, I expect not if refurbs.

Of course, monitors are mass produced and some models aren't always needed, thus dumped in order to generate revenue. If Dell does this and &quot;an agreement&quot; is made between seller and vendor to honor a warranty, its usually posted. Also, don't expect a generous warrnty. Many a monitor gets returned for repair/problem and can't be used as new, thus sold to 3rd party sellers. Read the fine print and any eBay seller history. The choice is yours. enjoy -----Willy

It arrived in perfect condition. After a week, the hard drive stopped working. So, I called Dell and they sent out a tech person to replace the hard drive and it all was covered under their warranty. The person I bought it from had purchased it under some discount program available only to educational institutions and then used all of the rebates to get the puter for a price that isn't available to the general public. I got a great deal, he made a little money and everyone is happy. It is just frustrating to see someone abuse the educational discount system that Dell so generously makes available. The computer and monitor were packaged in the original Dell packaging and arrived in great condition. Boxes weren't damaged nor was the monitor.
