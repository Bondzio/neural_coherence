in reply to: poll: when did you first start using a personal computer?
by lee koo (admin) moderator my first computer was an apple clone in 1983: franklyn computer, with 64kbytes memory power, no harddisk yet.
i was able to write some business applications and made some money.
i do remember playing with a comadore 32 kbytes memory power.
ibm pcs showed up a little later, with 640 kbytes memory power, and one very small harddisk, which cost around $700 i remember using cpm as operating system, far much better and powerful than the clumsy ms dos that ibm brought with its pcs.
i was living in panama city, panama at that time harmarma
