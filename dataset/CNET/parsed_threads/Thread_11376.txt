<s> How do I figure out if my mobo is PCI express? </s>
<s> It says it has 5 PCI ports is this the same as PCI express? </s>
<s> This is what I have... http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/mainboard/mbd/pro_mbd_detail.php?UID=607 This is stressing me out. </s>
<s> I need a new GPU and don't know if I can get PCI-E cards. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help or suggestions. </s>
<s> about half way down under &quot;Slots&quot;. </s>
<s> One AGP 4X/8X. </s>
<s> So that would be an AGP graphics card slot. </s>
<s> That means its not PCI-E? </s>
<s> help me out please </s>
<s> Can't be both AGP and PCI express. </s>
<s> No PCI express slots on this board. </s>
<s> You need an AGP slot graphics card. </s>
<s> There are three different options these days for adding a video card: 1. </s>
<s> PCI Express X16 2. </s>
<s> AGP 3. </s>
<s> PCI PCI Express X16 is the slot of choice these days for video cards. </s>
<s> AGP is the older video card slot and is the next best option (still very good) if you don't have a PCI Express X16 slot. </s>
<s> Regular PCI slots can be used for a variety of add-in cards for different purposes. </s>
<s> There are some video cards made for PCI slots, but they are on the lower end in terms of performance. </s>
<s> You want to choose a PCI video card only if you don't have a PCI Express X16 slot or an AGP slot. </s>
<s> Side note: There are many varieties of PCI Express and they are designated by bandwidth (X1, X4, X8, x16, et al.). </s>
<s> Almost all PCI Express video cards are of the X16 variety. </s>
