1.1.7	I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could please help me.	Sug

1.2.1	Since it's a SAMBA share, you may have better luck researching http://www.samba.org/ and the book at http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/samba/chapter/book/ I offer no clear answer to your issue but filesharing should be enabled and you might have to either enable the GUEST or Clear Passwords.	St
1.2.2	I will not tell you how to do this since it's in the Samba web site.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	you may want to try a crossover ethernet cable.	St
