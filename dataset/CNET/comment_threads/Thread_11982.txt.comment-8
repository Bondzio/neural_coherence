Some Virus do port scans looking for a new target to infect.
This can have the same effect as P2P software opening many TCP connections and crashing the router.
When in doubt, download the free Ethereal scanner and capture everything in/out of your PC ethernet card.
Shut down all browsers and mail and just scann your ethernet and see what traffic generates on its own.
This will give you a hint of what is going on.
I seriously doubt the problem is Comcast.
