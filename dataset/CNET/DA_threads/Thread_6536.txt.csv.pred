1.1.1	I have a Dell Dimension 2400 and I was board one day so I opened up the case ( not the first time ) .	St
1.1.2	While I was doing so I decided to move a PCI card over one slot to give my video card a bit more room to breath when I noticed that there was something that seems to be a layout for putting an AGP slot in .	St
1.1.3	It is slighty farther back then the PCI slots ( like all the AGP slots I have seen on motherboards ) and it is the top slot ( if there was a slot ) .	St
1.1.4	To get to the point , is it possible to buy an AGP slot so I can use AGP video cards ?	Ques
1.2.1	Look for mrbios.com or other BIOS suppliers if you need to try overclocking .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	printed circuit and soldered through holes that would be used for installing an AGP socket ? ?	Ques
1.3.2	An expert micro miniature soldering person could solder it in , however the firs thing would be to deteremine if there is actually the proper artwork connected to the solder spots .	St
1.3.3	Twould take a little deft work with a DVM , and a likely schematic/wiring daigram .	St
1.4.1	The AGP has a special power circuit and more .	St
1.4.2	If I wanted to cut the costs for a special lowball PC , I 'd not put those parts on or ... recycle a goofed AGP board into such a machine rather than scrap the run .	St
1.4.3	No one I 've met in 30 years of PC design ( and I 'm around my engineering friends ) has ever done this .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	that it is unlikely to work .	St
1.5.2	I think that I have only seen one such mobo and never checked any of the plated thru vias to see if they went anywhere .	St
1.5.3	Probably just filled to protect the mobo inner layers .	St
1.6.1	Do n't tell a solder to put on a AGP slot on your AGP-less motherboard cause it will screw up big time !	St
1.6.2	I tried it once 2 years ago with my old motherboard and the slot fried right on the moment of when I turned on the PC ( hecka pissed me off ) , so I recommend you to get a motherboard with AGP 8X instead ( they 're pretty cheap these days )	St
