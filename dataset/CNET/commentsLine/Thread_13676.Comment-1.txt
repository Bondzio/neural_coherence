when i play video games, the game will speed up and become really jerky.
i've only experienced this with san andreas.
i've tried turning the settings down and the jerkiness still happens.
is it an overheating problem with my cpu or ram or hdd???
i've been monitoring my video card temps with ati tool and it doesn't get past 45 degrees c with my ati silencer cooler.
just to let you know, my rig is: -athlon x2 4200+ -radeon x850xt -1 gb ram -80gb 7200 rpm it's really annoying and i can't play san andreas.
i'll try out some other games and let you know what happens.
thanks for any help in advance.
