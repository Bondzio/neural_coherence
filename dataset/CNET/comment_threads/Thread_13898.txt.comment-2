documents, applications or both?
It would be better to do a clean install of the OS and applications if you do that... documents are documents and are transportable across whatever machimes...
If you are talking about doing a back-up and restore, I would not trust doing that with the OS and aplications, though I suppose it is technically possible...
I wouldn't do it...
