<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Vista 32 bits only works with 4 Gb RAM. </s>
<s> So 2x2Gb is the max you need. </s>
<s> Vista 64 bits can use more, but you should be sure that the games you want to play (and the drivers for the hardware) are Vista 64 compatible. </s>
<s> Moreover, http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,2845,2328804,00.asp shows that the current generation of games is quite happy with 2Gb. </s>
<s> So 4Gb should be more than sufficient seen from that point of view also. </s>
<s> As yet, I think it's unlikely mass consumer games will need Vista 64 bit in the near future. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> That Kingwin is way over what you need and so are the two listed below...only thing is they're 1/2 the price, have excellent tech and buyer review and 5 years warrantys. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817703009 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139006 Your $$, your call. </s>
<s> The other thing is the RAM...not sure I'd be anxious to buy RAM where there are no buyer reviews indicating compatability, failure/DOA info, etc. </s>
<s> Is that RAM indicated on the MB mfg's QVL ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> the power supply is way over-the-top. </s>
<s> here's a quality antec 850w alternative for $140 (saving $153): http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817371009 why 2 relatively small hard drives? </s>
<s> a single 500gb 7200.11 will be bigger, faster, and cheaper ($75 vs $118). </s>
<s> western digital's 640gb ($85) and hitachi's 750gb ($120) are also better choices. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148288 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136218 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822145166 lastly, why amd? </s>
<s> a core2quad q6600 is $10 more and can be automatically overclocked to 3ghz by selecting a 1333mhz fsb. </s>
<s> it will be 20% faster than the phenom 9950 which has little oc headroom. </s>
<s> msi p45 platinum is $15 so an extra $25 gives you a faster PC. </s>
<s> if you're shy of overclocking, you can shift the savings from the power supply to move up to core2quad q9550 ($329) or a q9400 ($275) which are both faster than at stock speeds than the phenom. </s>
<s> The reason i went AMD was due to the fact I could almost get the same system for half the cost, the mobo and the cpu were both dirt cheap, im a die hard intel fan, I just couldnt find a good quality cpu and motherboard at the same price as the amd. </s>
<s> Also, going to MSI's website I was not able to find the mobo in the memory compatibility section and also the ones I did find were 1666, when AMD can only go to 1066. </s>
<s> If there is a way I can get a nice Intel processor that can last me awhile with a DDR3 rdy mobo I'd be all ears and thanks for the input so far. </s>
<s> Also, I am not really sure how to overclock since im new to the whole building business. </s>
<s> What would you suggest and I have heard a lot of people saying that its smart to heatsink the northbridge since it runs almost as hot as the CPU, would this be something to look into and for the CPU or should the fans in my case be ample? </s>
<s> Again thanks for the output I am making the correct changes, and will prolly go to the E6666 </s>
<s> using the prices from your own post, you can see that a q6600 is only $25 more. </s>
<s> the phenom is slightly faster but as i said, OC'ing a q6600 to 3ghz (with the mobo i suggested) is as simple as changing a couple of jumpers to select 1333mhz fsb. </s>
<s> no cpu voltage or memory tweaking is necessary. </s>
<s> you can even use the stock cooler (but something along the lines of a artic freezer pro 7 or coolermaster hyper tx2 would be a good $30 upgrade). </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835186134 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835103031 i too prefer upgrading cooling on gaming PC chipsets. </s>
<s> the msi p45 platinum has heatpipe cooling for the northbridge and cpu mosfets. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130179 note that i suggested msi since a) i own their board, and b) you spec'd msi in your original post. </s>
<s> for budget conscious customers, i suggest biostar's tforce line. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813138118 if you're worried about overclocking, going with a more reasonable power supply lets you get a q9400 or q9550 and stay within your budget. </s>
<s> but OCing a q6600 would give almost enough budget room for dual hd4870 cards. </s>
<s> don't get a board that has both ddr2 and ddr3 since they rarely perform as well as a pure ddr3 board and they have half the memory capacity with ddr3 (usually 4gb vs. 8gb). </s>
<s> so if you plan to upgrade from ddr2 to ddr3 a year down the road, you'd wind up throwing away your ddr2 ram and not being able to expand the capacity. </s>
<s> i had no problems with gigabyte's p45 ddr3 board for $175: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128348 paired with 2x2gb of mushkin's 4gb ddr3-1600 for $260: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820146828 but you'll only notice the performance difference in benchmarks or if you have long running cpu/memory intensive tasks (like video encoding). </s>
<s> and the ram is twice as expensive as ddr2-1066 so you could afford 6/8gb of ddr2-1066. </s>
<s> So would you recommend the DDR3 mobo right now, or is it not a big factor right now and spend the money with 6-8gb of DDR2? </s>
<s> Also, the Video card I selected would they be alright to crossfire and still preform very nicely or is there a video card out there for the price of both of them that out preforms them? </s>
<s> I cant ever seem to find this mobo memory compatibility on their website, so what would you use for DDR2 that would be good for 4GB? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> so long as you're willing to set the timings yourself and use two 2gb dimms. </s>
<s> msi boards are tweaker friendly and can be configured to handle up to ddr2-1200. </s>
<s> i prefer the ocz reaper: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227289 but the patriot viper is fine also. </s>
<s> just remember to do the initial boot with 1 stick (it'll run at ddr2-800). </s>
<s> then manually set the specified timings and reboot. </s>
<s> if everything's fine, add the other stick and reboot. </s>
<s> The MSI P45 Platinum http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130179 </s>
<s> ddr3 won't become mainstream until intel's new core i7 (nehalem) processors hit full stride in mid-2009. </s>
<s> dual 4850s perform well for the price as does a single 4870 and 4870x2. </s>
<s> any of them is a good high-end alternative. </s>
<s> I think I'll stick to the 4850's for the time being for the budget I am at. </s>
<s> After tweaking the things you mentioned I have the following different: Processor - Q6600 (I dont know how to O.C. </s>
<s> if its something easy to do im all for it) Mobo - P45 Platinum by MSI Memory - OCZ Reaper PSU - Antec 850W HDD - Western Digital 640Gb That hits me right at 1500 with the mail in rebates, sound good to you, and I will probably have questions on the tweaking and O.C. </s>
<s> for the system since this the first time I am doing anything of this sort. </s>
<s> So any more help would be greatly apprectiated and thanks for all the advice you have already given me. </s>
<s> http://www.msicomputer.com/product/p_spec.asp?model=P45_Platinum&class=mb See left hand side of web page...it's hiding in very plain sight. </s>
<s> I've had good luck with the GSkill the kit with 2 - 2GB DIMMs DDR2 - PC1066 but didn't see GSkill listed for this MB. </s>
<s> Good Luck VAPCMD </s>
<s> and look at page 2-20. set jb1,jb2 to 266-333Mhz and the q6600 will run at 3ghz. </s>
<s> RAM is slow. </s>
<s> Shot for a latency/CAS of 2. </s>
<s> Motherboard only uses DDR2 800/1066 memory, 1066 is required for one of processors. </s>
<s> See specifications. </s>
<s> Graphics card requires DirectX 10 this means the OS must be Vista. </s>
<s> Unless your running two graphics cards that power supply is over kill. </s>
<s> Somewhere around 550-600 watts should do for one card. </s>
<s> If you go with two graphics cards heat will be a problem. </s>
<s> How about your CPU cooler? </s>
<s> Nice first attempt. </s>
<s> More home work required. </s>
<s> It's all in the specifications. </s>
<s> Do some searches on those items directly from there manufactures web pages. </s>
<s> Newegg does a pretty good job with specifications but they sometimes miss some important information. </s>
<s> I think you could get more for your money. </s>
<s> I'd suggest you keep shopping. </s>
<s> This thread untracked. </s>
<s> Everything about your system looks great except for the bigger hard drive you're using. </s>
<s> You should get a bigger hard drive than the 320GB one you have. </s>
<s> You can try replacing that with at least a 500GB or more hard drive(preferable with 10,000 rpm). </s>
<s> You did not mention what OS you have. </s>
<s> If it is a 32-bit OS, then you won't be taking full advantage of all of those 4 gigs of RAM that you have. </s>
<s> If you really want to improve on your system, you can get two 500GB hard drives to replace the 320GB drive, and then set up the two drives to work together in a RAID 0 array for faster access time. </s>
<s> I agree with you that the RAM is too slow.But his motherboard may not be able to handle latency as low as 2. </s>
<s> A latency of 3 or 4 might be better for him. </s>
<s> I don't think that 1066 memory is necessarily required for the processor he's using. </s>
<s> I think he can get by with 800 memory. </s>
<s> Just because he is using a Directx10 card does'nt mean he has to use Vista. </s>
<s> A Directx10 card will work with any OS, the programs will just not operate on the x10 level. </s>
<s> And I disagree that the power supply he's using is overkill. </s>
<s> With any system today, the bigger the power supply, the better. </s>
<s> If he decides to install better video cards in the future, he will always have a power supply that can handle the upgrade. </s>
<s> And keeping the CPU cool really has nothing to do with the video cards, unless the CPU has been overclocked. </s>
<s> I went to a friend of mine who has done this for awhile and this is what we mastered up as a final copy for the 1500. </s>
<s> Let me know what you think, and the OS I believe will be XP, Vista is still to shaky for me but who knows I might change my mind later. </s>
<s> Give me some input but here is what I have. </s>
