<s> u should go for retail parts processor: amd athlon 64 3000+ hard drive: western digital or seagate memory- corsair value ram is good psu- thermaltake psu (the $30-$40) one will do fine gfx card: since not much gaming i would go for nvidia 6600 optical drives- get a dvd burner around $50 whichever brand u like case- ur choice win. </s>
<s> xp home u can get oem but i would go for the retail, u can see it on sale during weekend ads sometimes, easier to get than online media card reader/floppy- if necessary u should go newegg for all ur parts. </s>
<s> great price and service keyboard/mouse, speakers, monitor of ur choice y would u want to go through all this trouble to build ur computer when u can pick up a computer around $800 and stick in a low-end gfx card for less than $1100 and less time </s>

<s> When you settle on a CPU and motherboard (a good place to start), see what cables, adapters, and hubs that come with the motherboard. </s>
<s> This will allow you to purchase some OEM parts. </s>
<s> For example, the retail versions of hard drives and DVD drives come with cables and usually some software. </s>
<s> The OEM versions do not not come with cables or software (usually), but you can use the cables that come with the motherboard. </s>
<s> yea but will i need software </s>
<s> You don't need software for the HD. </s>
<s> Any utility software that comes with the HD can be downloaded free from the mfg website. </s>
<s> If you need CD/DVD burning software, go ahead and get the retail version of the DVD drive. </s>
<s> I think it's worth it if you don't have any on the computer. </s>
<s> Some folks end up using free burning software anyway (CDBurnerXP). </s>
<s> You can find some retail DVD burner drives for about the same price as OEM. </s>
<s> One of my favorites is the NEC 3540A (retail or OEM, check NewEgg.com). </s>
<s> Buy OEM Windows XP when you make the qualifying hardware purchase. </s>
<s> The best deals that I find are the weekly rebate specials from brick-n-mortar stores (CompUSA, CircuitCity, Staples, etc.) </s>
<s> The retail price after rebate often beats online OEM; however, you have to get lucky with rebates being offered when you need the part. </s>
<s> In general, though, most of the hardware and software for my builds is OEM and comes from NewEgg.com, Geeks.com, ChiefValue.com, et al. </s>
<s> Price comparision sites like PriceGrabber.com and Shopping.com come in handy. </s>
