Hey all, I have to send my HP laptop in to HP for repair because of a hardware fault anyway they told me to back up my data before I send it in because I won't be able to keep it when I send it in.
The laptop is an HP Pavilion dv2315nr, and I'm using a Thermaltake Black Widow to extract the data, but I can't get the HDD to fit.
I tried getting it to work with a discount enclosure from frys before, but I had the same problem and ended up snapping one of the brackets that holds the HDD into place.
So now I can't get it to fit in this much nicer one and I'm clueless.
Please I need your help badly, this HDD has important data to me!
Joe
