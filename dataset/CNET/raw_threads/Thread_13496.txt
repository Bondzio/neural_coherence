Be sure to hold down the CONTROL KEY while dragging files to tell Explorer (that's the shell software that Windows is using for the drag and drop) to COPY rather than move. Again, you have revealed how the drives are different but for now, Windows has annoyances like this. Bob

This means something terrible is wrong with your machine or OS. Maybe it got a bug, virus or worse, cleaned with one of those Tune up utilities. Bob
