3575	0	322232	2937429	NR	tqz	12/27/08 10:15 AM	1.2303729E12	Advice on PC speakers	Hello All Just wondering whether anyone could recommend a decent 2.1 speaker system or even a REAL good 2.0 system for my computer - not an expert in this field so any advice would be well appreciated! Some other info: * I use my pc (MS Vista O/S) for watching films as well as listening to music - no games! * It will be in a small-medium sized room so don't want too many wires, and don't want a huge system as have enough clutter as it is! * Budget - less than 100. * I did like the Harman Kardon Soundsticks, and was originally going to go with them (from the great reviews I have read, as well as a great design) but decided against it as I read it does not have a switch to turn it off (waste of electricity - lol) and dont want it to glow whilst I am trying to sleep - need darkness!!! * A speaker system which is great value and will hopefully last a few years!!! And advice/recs/help of any sort will be very well appreciated! Thanks in advance! T.

Am now looking into the Logitech range - something half decent and maybe even half the price of the soundsticks. Does anyone have any reccs? What are people experiences of the Z-4s? Thanks in advance!
