1.1.1	I 'm trying to instal a new IDE drive in my computer .	St
1.1.2	The idea was to replace an 80GB drive with a 320GB Maxtor Diamond Max 21 drive ( both IDE ) .	St
1.1.3	On installation the computer failed to see either drive and now will see one or the other but only as a slave drive .	St
1.1.4	Seeing only one drive is not a problem , I 'm quite happy to just have the one HDD , I just thought I might as well use the old one as I had it .	St
1.1.5	I 've set the jumpers on the drives to CS and used the correct connector on the IDE cable ( both as one drive and also with both connected up ) .	St
1.1.6	I 've tried connecting using a different cable .	St
1.1.7	I 've then tried installing a single drive setting the jumpers to the Master position and tried both connectors on the cable .	St
1.1.8	Whatever I 've tried , the computer either sees no drive or a slave drive .	St
1.1.9	This is using the primary IDE connection .	St
1.1.10	The secondary is set up with a DVD/ROM and a DVD/RW which have been working ok .	St
1.1.11	They show as one master and one slave .	St
1.1.12	Motherboard : Asus K8V SE Deluxe Any help getting this sorted will be greatly appreciated .	St

1.2.1	Did you try loading the BIOS defaults ?	Ques
1.2.2	And let 's be clear that we do n't bother with Windows until the BIOS sees it .	Sug
1.3.1	I loaded the BIOS default settings but it did n't fix the problem - still showing the drive as primary slave .	St
1.3.2	jandss	St
1.4.1	http : //www.asus.com/products.aspx ? modelmenu=2 & model=235 & l1=3 & l2=14 & l3=0 It is possible that one SATA port has something on it and the bios is set to EMULATE IDE which means we lose one IDE device .	St
1.4.2	Reading page 89 of http : //dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/sock754/k8v_se_dx/e1491_k8v_se_deluxe.pdf I 'd want the SATA boot rom disabled , the IDE raid too .	St
1.4.3	Do not use the PRI_RAID connection you see on Page 2-23 and page	St
1.5.1	OnChip SATA Bootrom and Onboard Promise Controller after having reset to default settings .	St
1.5.2	The cable is connected to the drive using the end connector ( black ) and the jumpers are set to CS in accordance with the picture on the drive and the Maxtor website .	St
1.5.3	The computer is still registering the drive as Primary IDE Slave .	St
1.6.1	Are you using the 80 conductor cables ?	Ques
1.6.2	Since you are not using SATA devices I 'd disable that and the RAID in the bios to avoid that issue about IDE emulation or where some of these boards ( badly documented ! )	St
1.6.3	reserve the Primary IDE Master to the IDE or SATA RAID port .	St
1.6.4	Why it does that is a very long explanation which I 'll not be doing in this small space .	St
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	Also I 've just tried a different cable again to be on the safe side .	St
1.7.2	However , I 've just found that the system time has zeroed .	St
1.7.3	If the CMOS battery needs changing would that cause this problem ?	Ques
1.8.1	It wo n't help having it fail during this .	St
1.9.1	I rebooted , reset the BIOS as per above postings and drive still shows as Pri Slave .	St
1.10.1	The board has failed or we still got the cable and jumpers wrong .	St
1.10.2	Here 's how I test .	St
1.10.3	I put the cable on the second IDE port and see if it goes master .	St
1.10.4	If so , bad board .	St
1.10.5	If not , I did the cable , jumper or drive wrong .	St
1.10.6	Bob	St
1.11.1	I followed your suggestion for checking that the problem did n't lie with the board so after that I went back to square one .	St
1.11.2	Redid all the jumpers on both the old and new drives and it now sees both correctly .	St
1.11.3	Many thanks for your help .	Polite
1.11.4	It may have been a stupid mistake on my part , but at least it showed up the failing CMOS battery when the computer was opened up .	St
1.11.5	Sue	St
1.12.1	Sometimes we have to step back and make another run at these things .	St
