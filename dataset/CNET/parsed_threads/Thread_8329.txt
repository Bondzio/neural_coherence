<s> This is a silly question but I am all confused so I am posting this for help... </s>
<s> I have a dvd of an event I did a few weeks ago and I wanted to reproduce them to send to my sponsors. </s>
<s> How do I do that using my Mac computer (intel based)? </s>
<s> I'll appreciate an immediate feedback. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> The usual way to copy a DVD is to use Roxio Toast and choose copy. </s>
<s> You should also be able to use the Disk Utility to make an image of the original DVD, provided that it is not a commercial encrypted DVD. </s>
<s> Once you have made the image, you can reproduce as many copies as you want using the Finder as the burning software. </s>
<s> If you need further help, just holler. </s>
