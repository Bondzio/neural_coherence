[osha will hate you.
lol] you can probe the rear of the power connector on the mobo.
the black leads are all common [ground in most peoples terms].
the main 5 volts is on pins 4 , 6, 19, and 20. the main [once] 12 volts is on pin 10 [now there is also a separate 4 pin 12 volt connector, 2 pins 12 v and 2 gnd, it is now spec'd to be provided by a separate set of rails in the supply].
the 3.3v is on pins 1,2, and 11. the pins run from 1 thru 10 down one side and 11 [next to 1] thru 20 down the other side.
the 11 thru 20 side has 4 black wires the other row only 3 black wires.
5 volts are virtually always red.
minus 12 and minus 5 volts are virtually no longer used.
testing an atx standalone means you have to learn how to turn the supply outputs on.
robert's link probably shows that.
