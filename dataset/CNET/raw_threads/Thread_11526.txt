4246	0	394033	3304934	NR	tfarney	5/15/10 11:17 AM	1.27392222E12	lost bluetooth driver	Machine Dell XPS 720 running Win XP MCE 2005, all updates current (recent reinstal) I cannot find driver for my bluetoth dongle. It is a Bluetooth USB Adaptor Dongle, BTA01 from Kaito. They sent Bluesoliel, but only online I have to rebuy @ $20, last time I looked. The whole dongle was less than that. Kaito site is not helpful Any ideas?

Some get upset with that but let them as I look at devices from newegg and geeks. Examples under 10 at http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=PD-BD10&cat=NET Bob
