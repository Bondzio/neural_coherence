1.1.1	Inspiron 1521 AMD Turion , 1.80 GHz 1918 mb ram Vista , Home Premium Zyxel P-330-W Router Cannon ip4300 Printer ( on network ) Yo !	St
1.1.2	Back again with my continuing saga of networking woes - some days good , some days not so good !	St
1.1.3	Newest issue is that if I want to print something on the laptop ( using the networked Canon ip4300 ) , it will only do so if I have recently rebooted or powered up the laptop .	St
1.1.4	If the laptop has been on for more than a few hours , the print command just does n't seem to take - most of the time , if I open the active printer , the command has n't even registered with the printer yet .	St
1.1.5	But if I restart Vista on the laptop , by the time my settings have loaded , the document I was trying unsuccessfully to print will have finished printing !	St
1.1.6	There 's obviously some conflict at work here , or some setting I 've overlooked - any suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.7	I 'm getting closer to having this thing working properly - I can feel it !	St
1.1.8	Thanks for your response , john	St
1.2.1	There are a number of things that could be causing your problem it 's really a matter of trouble shooting .	St
1.2.2	Here are two painless solutions you can try if you have n't already done so : # 1 -Download and install Vista SP1 ( Highly Recommended ) # 2 -Right click on your Network Icon in the systray .	St
1.2.3	-Left click on Network and Sharing Center & quot ; or -Click & quot ; Start & quot ; & gt ; Control Panel & gt ; Network & Internet & gt ; Network & Sharing Center -Under & quot ; Sharing and Discovery & quot ; make sure that & quot ; Network Discovery & quot ; is turned & quot ; On & quot ; If the above do n't solve your problem ( or you 've already done them ) we can look at other options .	St
1.3.1	Network Discovery is & quot ; On & quot ; , and I remember going through a long download of Vista SP1 recently , but I also remember that d/l had some problems - how do you know that V. SP1 installed properly ?	Ques
1.3.2	Thanks ajtrek , john	St
1.4.1	To verify installation of Vista SP1 do the following ; Click Start & gt ; Programs & gt ; Accessories & gt ; Systems Tools & gt ; System Information You will see the following information with the version indicating installation of SP1 right after your OS .	St
1.4.2	OS Name	St
1.5.1	Used your suggested route , and it tells me that my system has , Version 6.0.6001 Service Pack 1 Build 6001 So , I guess we 're OK there .	St
1.5.2	Here 's my network hookup info : Desktop is cabled to LAN port on Router Modem ( Fujitsu Speedport DSL ) is cabled to WAN port on Router Printer is USB cabled to Desktop Laptop is using a Dell Wireless 1490 Dual Band WLAN Mini-Card There are never any problems with internet connections .	St
1.5.3	In the interest of giving you what may/or may not be good info up front , I need to let you know that I have two printers installed on my laptop ( same printer - Canon ip4300 , but installed on two different ports ; both as local ports - one titled & quot ; usb002 & quot ; , and the other titled with the address of the resident printer on the desktop ) .	St
1.5.4	Both were installed per kaufmanmoore : http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html ? forumID=62 & threadID=264135 & messageID=2612091 # 2612091 .	St
1.5.5	I did not intentionally install the two printers , but this was the result of many attempts to get Printer Sharing & quot ; on & quot ; in Network and Sharing Center .	St
1.5.6	I worked on this for a long time and one day I looked and surprise , Printer Sharing was & quot ; on & quot ; !	St
1.5.7	I then noticed the two printers being installed , but I thought maybe that was the reason why Printer Sharing had gone ON .	St
1.5.8	So I left them there .	St
1.5.9	Sorry about the long story , but I thought it may be meaningful , and if so , you should know asap .	St
1.5.10	Thanks for your assistance , ajtrek .	St

1.6.2	Canon ip4300 connected to Desktop via USB cable .	St
1.6.3	Update the firmware in your wireless router .	St
1.6.4	Broadcast SSID Use WPA PSK ( TKIP ) Security ( Most wireless devices work best with this type of security ) Mixed b and g mode ( n if available ) Use channels 1 , 6 or 11 .	St
1.6.5	Most wireless devices work best on these channels .	St
1.6.6	While you 're in your wireless router , see what your LAN ip range is .	St
1.6.7	If you can , set the ip address of the printer around the upper part of the range so a computer does n't try to get the ip address of the printer .	St
1.6.8	You need to have a network .	St
1.6.9	Identical accounts on both computer with identical passwords .	St
1.6.10	Example : you need to have a drfugawe account on both computers .	St
1.6.11	On the computer the printer is connected to , try this .	St
1.6.12	Disconnect the printer .	St
1.6.13	Un-install the printer .	St
1.6.14	Restart your computer .	St
1.6.15	Download and install the latest drivers from here .	St
1.6.16	Post back what your results are .	St

1.7.1	Before we start to dig into your router and it 's settings let 's try one more check ... . On your Desktop Go to Control Panel & gt ; Hardware and Sound & gt ; Printers & gt ; Right Click on Canon iP4300 & gt ; Left Click Properties & gt ; Click & quot ; Ports & quot ; tab and verify : -Printer is connected to correct USB Port Click & quot ; Advanced & quot ; tab and verify the following is selected : -Always Available -Priority = 1 -Driver = Canon iP4300 -Spool print documents so program finishes printing faster -Start printing immediately -Print spooled documents first -Enable advanced printing features Click & quot ; Security & quot ; tab Under & quot ; Group or User Names -Printer is available to everyone should be highlighted Under Permissions for Everyone -Print = Allow Click & quot ; Share & quot ; Here I 'm going to make a few assumptions ... # 1 Share This Printer box is already checked # 2 You have a name entered to identify the printer for sharing .	St
1.7.2	Now here 's the tricky part .	St
1.7.3	I know that you are running Vista on your laptop .	St
1.7.4	However , I do n't know what OS you are running on the desktop I 'll assume it 's not Vista ?	Ques
1.7.5	You 'll notice that there is a & quot ; Drivers & quot ; box located in this tab ( Share ) as well .	St
1.7.6	Read the explanation in the box and you 'll get my meaning .	St
1.7.7	I 'm gon na go out on a limb here an make an assumption that your laptop in downloading the Vista compatible drivers each time it prints to the shared printer .	St
1.7.8	That 's why you continually see the drivers being installed .	St
1.7.9	So , the data is being sent to the printer cue , the drivers are being installed and by the time you reboot ( your laptop ) the document has printed .	St
1.7.10	The following link better explains my point .	St
1.7.11	In effect your desktop is acting as a & quot ; Server & quot ; and your laptop is the & quot ; Client & quot ; .	St
1.7.12	The article is a little dated but the principle is the same .	St
1.7.13	http : //www.ss64.com/ntsyntax/printing.html Click OK after downloading the correct print drivers .	St
1.7.14	On your Laptop open the iP4300 properties & gt ; click Port Tab & gt ; make sure it points to the & quot ; Shared printer name and its location & quot ; .	St
1.7.15	Verify what I 've just given you and if you agree let me know and I can provide a network print solution that ignores the OS of the computer for faster printing .	St
1.8.1	( I 'm going to copy/paste your questions below , and answer in parentheses , ie .	St
1.8.2	( *** ) - do n't see any other way to do this . )	St
1.8.3	Before we start to dig into your router and it 's settings let 's try one more check ... . On your Desktop Go to Control Panel & gt ; Hardware and Sound & gt ; Printers & gt ; Right Click on Canon iP4300 & gt ; Left Click Properties & gt ; Click & quot ; Ports & quot ; tab and verify : -Printer is connected to correct USB Port ( yes ) Click & quot ; Advanced & quot ; tab and verify the following is selected : -Always Available ( yes ) -Priority = 1 ( yes ) -Driver = Canon iP4300 ( yes ) -Spool print documents so program finishes printing faster ( yes ) -Start printing immediately ( yes ) -Print spooled documents first ( yes ) -Enable advanced printing features ( yes ) Click & quot ; Security & quot ; tab ( No Security Tab !	St
1.8.4	- using XP-SP2 on desktop ) Under & quot ; Group or User Names -Printer is available to everyone should be highlighted ( not seeing this here ) Under Permissions for Everyone -Print = Allow ( not seeing this here ) Click & quot ; Share & quot ; Here I 'm going to make a few assumptions ... # 1 Share This Printer box is already checked ( yes ) # 2 You have a name entered to identify the printer for sharing .	St
1.8.5	( yes ) Now here 's the tricky part .	St
1.8.6	I know that you are running Vista on your laptop .	St
1.8.7	However , I do n't know what OS you are running on the desktop I 'll assume it 's not Vista ?	Ques
1.8.8	( correct- I 'm using XP-SP2 ) You 'll notice that there is a & quot ; Drivers & quot ; box located in this tab ( Share ) as well .	St
1.8.9	Read the explanation in the box and you 'll get my meaning .	St

1.8.16	http : //www.ss64.com/ntsyntax/printing.html ( You 'll have to forgive me at this point , but I simply do n't understand this article !	St
1.8.17	There are too many terms being used in it that are foreign to me , and I ca n't get its intended points - Sorry .	St
1.8.18	But notwithstanding , I 'll continue answering your questions and we 'll see where that takes us - OK ? )	Ques
1.8.19	I think I remember installing the newest Canon iP4300 Vista drivers on the desktop , however , I think I simply went to Canon 's site , downloaded the drivers , and installed them on the desktop .	St
1.8.20	I did not use any wizard , nor did I install them using any XP assistance linkage .	St
1.8.21	So , I 'm not sure that they are available when needed - and as I inferred , I 'm really not sure that I dl'ed them onto the desktop when I dl'ed them for the laptop ! )	St
1.8.22	Click OK after downloading the correct print drivers .	St
1.8.23	( ? ? ?	Ques
1.8.24	- say what ?	Ques
1.8.25	... ) On your Laptop open the iP4300 properties & gt ; click Port Tab & gt ; make sure it points to the & quot ; Shared printer name and its location & quot ; .	St
1.8.26	( I 'm not sure about your question here - when I go to Control Panal/Printers/ the listed name of the default printer is & quot ; ip4300 ( this is the share name ) on Melanie & quot ; ( the name of the desktop ) , under iP4300 Properties/Ports , the checked box is , & quot ; usb002 - Virtual printer port for usb & quot ; . )	St
1.8.27	Verify what I 've just given you and if you agree let me know and I can provide a network print solution that ignores the OS of the computer for faster printing .	St
1.8.28	( I hope I 've answered your questions adaquately - now if I may , I 've got a couple of additional questions/observations for you - I ca n't understand why on my laptop when I go into CP/Printers/ip4300 on Melanie/Properties , the data is grayed-out - but this is the default printer !	St
1.8.29	However , if I go the other installed printer ( see my explanation in message # 5 above ) , it is NOT grayed-out , but there is a & quot ; group & quot ; designation noted for this printer , while the default printer has no & quot ; group & quot ; designation !	St
1.8.30	Is this part of the problem ?	Ques
1.8.31	What am I missing here ?	Ques
1.8.32	Thanks ajtrek for your help - I hope I 've answered your questions . )	Polite
1.8.33	john	St
1.9.1	But please allow me to follow along with ajtrek 's recs , etc. , and then I 'll get back to your suggestions .	Sug
1.9.2	I 'm afeared that if I try to make changes from both of you at the same time , we risk getting messed up even more than I am right now .	St
1.9.3	So , thank you very much , and I 'll soon be answering your message .	Polite
1.9.4	Talk at you soon , john	St
1.10.1	The benefits of this setup are : - iP4300 resides on your network - iP4300 is available to any computer connected to your network ( wired/wireless ) - No need to have multiple drivers loaded on each computer -- -- - Laptop = Vista drivers for the iP4300 -- -- - Desktop ( Melanie ) = XP drivers for the iP4300 Long story shortI could bring a laptop running Windows 2000 to your home , download compatible drivers for the iP4300 , setup a Standard TCP/IP port for the iP4300 , connect to your network ( with your permission ) and print !	St
1.10.2	Heres a real world example : My girlfriend connects to my network with her laptop running XP and prints to my HP Officejet Pro L7680 .	St
1.10.3	I connect to her network with my laptop running Vista Ultimate and print to her Cannon MP730 ( which by the way is an older model than your iP4300 ) .	St
1.10.4	This solution will require you to invest in a print server and Ethernet cable .	Sug
1.10.5	I recommend the TrendNet TE100-P1U printer server because its inexpensive and easy to install .	St
1.10.6	It may be ordered on-line from ... . Trendnet http : //trendnet.com/products/proddetail.asp ? prod=130_TE100-P1U & cat=46 for $ 55.99 Dell http : //accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx ? sku=A0968623 & cs=19 & c=us & l=en & dgc=SS & cid=30322 & lid=680414 for $ 49.99 Office Depot http : //www.officedepot.com/ddSKU.do ? level=SK & id=485015 & cm_mmc=TLShopping-_-Shopzilla-_-Networking-_-485015 % 20TRENDnet % 201PORT % 20PRINT % 20SERVER % 20USB % 2010 % 2F100 % 20WPERP for $ 47.95 I found one locally at MicroCenter for a friend .	St
1.10.7	Youll need an Ethernet cable long enough to run from the print server to a LAN port on your router ( you do have an open port ? )	Ques
1.10.8	Connection sequence would be : iP4300 & gt ; USB & gt ; Print Server & gt ; Ethernet Cable & gt ; Router .	St
1.10.9	Things you want to do first : - Install XP SP3 on desktop computer ( HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ) - Download appropriate iP4300 drivers for the OS installed on the specific computer store them on the desktop of each computer for easy access ( * see note ) - Access your router 's online admin and enable DHCP .	St
1.10.10	DHCP enablement is usually under the Basic Setup tab in router admin .	St
1.10.11	You should select Automatic Configuration for DHCP .	St
1.10.12	Enabling DHCP will automatically assign an IP address for the print server/iP4300 or any other device you connect to your router .	St
1.10.13	Be sure to save the settings and exit router admin .	St
1.10.14	After you make the above connections youll want to obtain the IP address of the print server/iP4300 by going online again to your routers admin and look for the DHCP Client Table which will list the IP address for your print server/iP4300 write it down youll need it later .	St
1.10.15	I have a Linksys router and my DHCP Client Table is located under : - Status tab & gt ; DHCP Server & gt ; DHCP Client Table Assuming everything thus far has gone without a hitch youre now ready to setup the iP4300 on your computersone at a time .	St
1.10.16	Heres how : Control Panel & gt ; Priners & gt ; Add a Printer & gt ; Add Local Printer & gt ; Create New Port & gt ; Standard TCP/IP Port Click Next & gt ; Select Auto Detect ( if available ) & gt ; Host Name/IP Address ( type the IP Address you wrote down youll notice that the Port Name field populates automatically as you type ) Click Next & gt ; Install Printer Driver here you can select Canon on the left and iP4300 on the right ( * see note ) Click Next & gt ; Follow instructions from this point on its simple when you are asked if you want to set the iP4300 as default select yes When asked to print a test page select yes .	St
1.10.17	If everything went as planned , you can click O.K .	St
1.10.18	after the test page prints and start printing normally .	St
1.10.19	If everything works as it should you can delete the icons for the previous iP4300 installations via Control Panel & gt ; Printers on each computer .	St
1.10.20	Keep me informed as to your decision .	St
1.10.21	* Note : If your iP4300 is not listed when you are asked to Install Print Drivers - Select & quot ; Have Disk & quot ; ( Browse to location where the drivers are located , Select the file , click & quot ; OK & quot ; - follow instructions from this point .	St
1.11.1	Yes , I 'm sure this is a more immediate fix than the route I 'm currently following - But , it discounts the fact that I am an old , obstinent , bull-headed codger with an intense desire to work out the bugs from my current buggy setup .	St
1.11.2	If the current setup just flatout did nothing , then I 'd sure look for an alternate solution such as a print server , or even Network Magic ( which I also know will solve this as well ) , but each of those would require an investment which I simply do n't have - $ 50 may be inexpensive from your perspective , but from mine , it 'd require a budget adjustment I 'd be hard pressed to make !	St
1.11.3	It 's as simple as that .	St
1.11.4	So , I am very thankful for your willingness to assist in my quest , and if you have any additional insight into how we might tweek it a bit more , I 'd love to hear your ideas - In the meantime , I 'm going to continue looking for answers to my frustration .	St
1.11.5	Much appreciation , ajtrek .	St
1.11.6	john	St
1.12.1	I still believe the problem may be caused by driver installation .	St
1.12.2	So here 's a link to Canon to get the latest drivers for your iP4300 .	St
1.12.3	Guess what ... these drivers support Windows/XP/Vista/2000 ! ! !	St
1.12.4	There 's no need to do a separate download specific to the OS installed on each computer ... just download and install on both .	St
1.12.5	You may have to setup the iP4300 again on both systems with the new drivers .	St
1.12.6	The instructions will ask you to select an OS .	St
1.12.7	It does n't matter if you select XP or Vista , as the download is the same .	St
1.12.8	http : //www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller ? act=ModelInfoAct & tabact=DownloadDetailTabAct & fcategoryid=357 & modelid=13528 However , before you download drivers or do anything ... update the XP system with SP3 ... disregard that it says for IT Professionals and Developers .	St
1.12.9	Here 's the link : http : //www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx ? FamilyId=5B33B5A8-5E76-401F-BE08-1E1555D4F3D4 & displaylang=en Let me know your results .	St
1.12.10	Good luck !	Polite
1.13.1	I used these guys to help resolve a fax issue with my HP Officejet Pro L7680 .	St
1.13.2	I spent over 3 hours with various levels of HP tech support only to have them tell me that faxing was not capable with my Internet phone service .	St
1.13.3	Live Chat with FixYa resolved my issue in 1-1/2 hours , which includes the time it took to move back and forth between my laptop and the HP to try suggested solutions , type my response , and perform two-way test faxing .	St
1.13.4	There are 3 levels of support : - Live Chat @ $ 14.95 ( My choice ) - Premium @ $ 9.95 ( Email response ) - Post on Forum Of course , a credit card is required for the first two , but according to their policy , you dont pay unless you are satisfied with the results .	St
1.13.5	Heres the link if you are interested : http : //www.fixya.com/ I did some research on your router the ZyXel Prestige 330W ( assuming its the one listed in your CNET profile ) .	St
1.13.6	It has several configurations depending upon how you intend to use it .	St
1.13.7	The configuration used may cause it to generate rotating IP Addresses , which can be a problem for clients on the network , and their attached peripherals ( i.e .	St
1.13.8	networked printer sharing ) .	St
1.13.9	Its not a flaw with the router and Im not saying thats the cause , but its a thought .	St
1.13.10	In addition , Id recommend updating the firmware to v1.8 .	St
1.13.11	Heres the link : http : //us.zyxel.com/web/support_download_list.php ? indexflag=20040906164737 As a sidebar , FixYa has specific solutions regarding issues others have had with the ZyXel Prestige 330W .	St
1.13.12	This only means that FixYa is familiar with the product , which is a good thing .	St
1.13.13	They may be your best bet to resolve your issue , if none of what has been suggested works .	St
1.13.14	I still recommend updating your XP with SP3 , as it makes the OS more network friendly .	Sug
1.13.15	Good luck and keep me posted .	Polite
