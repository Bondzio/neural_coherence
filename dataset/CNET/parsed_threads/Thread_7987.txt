<s> Alright so I tried installing a new sound card on my custom built machine. </s>
<s> when I went to turn it on and install the new drivers, when it wouldn't boot. </s>
<s> nothing! </s>
<s> I hit the power and the LED lights come on fans kick in but no video signal is sent and the monitor just goes into stand-by. </s>
<s> What could be my problem here? </s>
<s> I am thinking mobo, but hoping maybe just the RAM. </s>
<s> How to I check before buying all new? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Spooky or what? </s>
<s> I turned my machine on this morning and have exactly the same problems. </s>
<s> Power supply fan and CPU fan both start,again no beeps from the memory, Monitor LED doesn't change from amber to green. </s>
<s> Tried pressing reset button but nothing happens, pressed power button again nothing, only way to turn off is to disconnect from mains power supply. </s>
<s> Wondered if there may have ben a power surge overnight? </s>
<s> Anybody got any ideas? </s>
<s> otherwise it's going to be case of swapping each componant into another machine one at a time to find the fault. </s>
<s> Regards Mike </s>
<s> Hi mediafreakgodicon, since reading your post and posting my first reply, i have spoken to my mate who suggested a way to solve my problem and it has worked, so i thought you may want to try it. </s>
<s> Look on your mobo for the jumper to clear your CMOS and short it out. </s>
<s> If there isn't a jumper to short remove the battery for a short time whilst disconnected from the mains. </s>
<s> this will restore CMOS to default settings. </s>
<s> It has worked for me so give it a try! </s>
<s> Regards Mike </s>
<s> Hey mike, I tried that out today but it didn't work as well for me as it did you, in fact it didn't work at all. </s>
<s> I pulled out the lithium battery to clear the CMOS. </s>
<s> when I put it back in and restarted my PC I was still in the same boat as where I started. </s>
<s> Any other ideas? </s>
<s> I'm about ready to just give it up. </s>
<s> sound card ? </s>
<s> I always unplug my PC before I ever open the case. </s>
<s> I had more or less the same problem yesterday. </s>
<s> Computer froze, I rebooted and...nothing. </s>
<s> The power comes on, the hard drive light is on (constantly) the cd rom light comes on briefly and then that's it. </s>
<s> I tried clearing the cmos but no joy I don't care about tha data...it's my kids PC, but I don't want to throw it away. </s>
<s> Bit of a bugger really Richard </s>
<s> i just and i mean just went thru same thing! </s>
<s> turned out mother board was fried </s>
<s> Is there anyway to test that the motherboard is indeed fried, without going out and buying all new components? </s>
<s> Uhuh. </s>
<s> Watching too many movies again. </s>
<s> I mean the 4 parts to get a beep. </s>
<s> Notice a case is not in the list. </s>
<s> THE LIST: 1. </s>
<s> Motherboard. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> CPU (with heatsink/fan.) </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Power supply. </s>
<s> (Yup, you need the AC cord.) </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> The speaker (connected to the motherboard...) When I find a dead dead unit I strip it down to these 4 pieces. </s>
<s> If it powers up and beeps I start adding parts. </s>
<s> If it doesn't power up I'm looking at 4 possibly bad parts. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I bought a new motherboard and cpu and my comp still wont start up. </s>
<s> Power is getting to it but there is no sound, beep or screen. </s>
