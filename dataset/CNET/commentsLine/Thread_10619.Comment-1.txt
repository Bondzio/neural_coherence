hi.
i'm going to be a college freshman next year and want to haul off my big media collection (around 200 gigs) to school with me.
i want an external hard drive, and currently i am looking at the maxtor one touch ii 300 gig model.
before i buy it though i am curious as to whether there is a better, more afordable, and large storage solution.
perhaps involving coupling a usb 2.0 hard drive kit and a cheap desktop ide or ata hardrive.
my price range can go as high as $300 dollars.
more than anything i want storage and affordibility, not speed.
any suggestions?
