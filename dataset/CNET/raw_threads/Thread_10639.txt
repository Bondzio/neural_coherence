New controller card. Bios upgrades on motherboard and controller card. WD has replaced drive three times and the result is always the same. Controller card has also been replaced as have the eSATA cables. Drive only acts up when using eSATA. Delayed write error appears when computer is sitting idle and it locks up the machine requiring a re-boot. Running Windows XP SP2; 3GB memory; 3.2 GHz Processor. Any ideas would be appreciated. Chris

And owners are asked to find the 10 or more drivers for their machines. Example 10 at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7587_102-0.html?forumID=69&threadID=271360&messageID=2699006#2699006 They forget one I get for the AMD which is a CPU driver. Bob

Started with a new SIIG and applied the latest firmware and drivers when it produced the Delayed Write Failure to K:\$Mft error. Then with guidance from SIIG tech support, returned the controller card and purchased a new LaCie controller and upgraded it. Same result. I am assuming it is a simple setting on my machine that is escaping me. Chris

I have to check each and every one of them with each maker. It's possible it's some power or other issue. Did you try a plain old SATA drive, power connection from the desktop? Bob

I'm having that error message within the BartPE 3.1.10a operating environment while connected via eSATA (BartPE is like XP 32-bit, only it is a self-contained OS booted from a USB thumb drive as a troubleshooting tool when the HDD-installed OS on a given machine won't boot ... for whatever reason). I'd be interested to know if you ever resolved your eSATA DWF issue(s). I suspect a f/w upgrade (REV_1034 [from REV_1028]) I did on my drives (I own 4 My Book Home HDDs) in MAR of this year may have precipitated this same DWF issue, but seemingly only in the BartPE environment. Thanks, Kevin

Put the drive into a desktop and let windows chkdsk it on startup. 3. Replaced the HDD. 4. Deleted the partitions, created new partition and formatted it in a suitable format for the host OS. Hope this helps, bob

As to your list Bob ... thanks for helping out ... 1. f/w upgrade ... done that (REV_1034) ... am now wondering if I can roll-back to REV_1028 2. chkdsk ... was able to do that up in a normal OS (Win XP Pro 32-bit SP3) with the WD as an externally-connected non-system drive from: Properties &gt; Tools &gt; Error-checking - Check Now (plus, if connected [externally] on a normal XP boot and errors are present, chkdsk will run on that drive anyways) 3. replacement ... not an option (due out-of-warranty, NLA & not really neccessary as the drive is only acting up in the BartPE environment with large file Writes) 4. reformatting ... not an option ... I have nowhere I can immediately move the existing 400~GB of data already on this single partition NTFS drive (my other 3 1TB WD's are all full of good stuff), plus, as for final comment in 3. I'm focusing on the possibility that BartPE is loading an inappropriate driver for my eSATA controller - even though the appropriate driver (Si3112.sys - v1.3.65.2, 23-Aug-06) is configured properly in my BartPE build, is the latest from the controller vendor (Vantec UGT-ST350CB, seen by XP devmgmt.msc as 'Silicon Image SiI 3512 SATALink Controller') and is presumably matched to the BIOS of the controller. The trick is to be able to bring an appropriate tool to bear within the BartPE environment to examine the actual driver being loaded. Thanks, Kevin

I can't answer if Chris found an answer but you asked me so I gave a quick list of the things I've run into over the past few months. Interesting comment however about not being able to move the files out to start over. Are you telling us that there is no backup copy? Bob
