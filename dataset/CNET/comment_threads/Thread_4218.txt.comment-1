Well back to the drawing board here.I got a new Geforce 6600 AGP,mother board is a pchip board witch is also ECS main boards.
(ECSM825VXX)witch is the same board as K7-M825VXX.I have a power supply that has been discontinued by Raidmax,model number RD-350.My video card needs more power to work right.Size is 5.9x3.4x5.5 I have been looking for one now for 3 days.But i can not find one.Price is very importation.
I would like about 500 to 600watts so i will not get in this problem again for some time.It would be nice to if it had some cool colors,but it does not matter.
Thank again!
