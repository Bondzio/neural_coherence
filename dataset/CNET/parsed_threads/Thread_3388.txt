<s> I have a Cisco/Linksys EA4500 that supports Wireless-N with simultaneous dual-band 2.4 + 5 GHz as my main router. </s>
<s> I would like to add an additional router to extend the range of my network using this article as a guide: http://www.labnol.org/software/add-router-to-wireless-network/19716/ How sophisticated of a second router do I need? </s>
<s> Do I need one with Wireless-N with simultaneous dual-band 2.4 + 5 GHz? </s>
<s> My main router in use now covers the whole house effectively. </s>
<s> I am just installing the second router in order to have wired ethernet ports in another location. </s>
<s> I figured if I am doing this, I might as well improve the wireless signal around this second location (the basement). </s>
<s> Any recommendations for this second router? </s>
<s> Good article and it noted exactly what the advice you see in this forum. </s>

<s> my question remains unanswered. </s>
<s> Should I invest in a fancy router? </s>
<s> Also, the article says to use the same channel on both routers. </s>
<s> Most other sources are saying to use different channels. </s>
<s> Which is correct? </s>
<s> New to the forum and did not notice the subject line that answers my question. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Here I use a different channel. </s>
<s> But there are folk that claim same channel works. </s>
<s> I don't argue with what works. </s>
