<s> My company is going to buy a computer. </s>
<s> This computer needs to have at least Win XP Professional OS, and will be installed with MS SQL 2000. </s>
<s> It will be mainly used for: 1. </s>
<s> Transferring files to the web hosting company's shared web server 2. </s>
<s> Transferring data from the internal server (intranet) to this PC 3. </s>
<s> Transferring data from this PC to the shared database server of the web hosting company 4. </s>
<s> Performing scheduled jobs (that will involved executing distributed SQL statements, some stored procedures) between our own SQL server and the shared database server using MS SQL 3 times a day 5. </s>
<s> Running the Distributed Transaction Coordinator, SQL Server, and SQL Server Agent of MS SQL 2000 whenever the PC is on 6. </s>
<s> Backing-up data from the shared web server and database server daily 7. </s>
<s> Sending e-mail when the scheduled jobs failed I think speed and security will be the most important. </s>
<s> I'm not sure because I have no experience in buying PC at all. </s>
<s> What technical specs would you recommend for the PC? </s>
<s> Which processor? </s>
<s> How much memory? </s>
<s> What hard drive? </s>
<s> How much power? </s>
<s> Which brand? </s>
<s> ... </s>
<s> Please help... </s>
<s> Thank you in advance. </s>
<s> Btw I just want a normal PC (not a server). </s>
<s> This PC acts actually like a middleman that transfers data from our company to the web hosting company's server using MS SQL which will also process the data. </s>
<s> The data is very small, less than 2-3 MB. </s>
<s> But it's going to perform this job 3 times a day. </s>
