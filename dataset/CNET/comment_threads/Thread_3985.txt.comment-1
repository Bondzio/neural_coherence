On a deadline for a documentary project, backup is far away, drive enclosure failed.
Mac OS 10.4 I had a 1TB FantomDrive external hard drive that burnt something on the board, but the drives (two 500GB SATA drives) are fine, so I bought a new enclosure and installed them.
All files (from both drives) appear in the one drive that does mount, the other one asks to be initialized, but only half of the files really exist (or point to the right files).
As far as I can tell it's a RAID issue, that I broke the set (probably a Concatenated Disk Set).
How can I reconnect these two drives without erasing the files, so that it reads as one drive again?
Can't figure out how to do this in Disk Utility.
thank you.
