you can either set the current system drive as &quot;master&quot; and the 300 drive to &quot;slave&quot;.
or you can make both drives &quot;cable select&quot; (cs) and tell the bios (setup) which one to point to for bootup.
in order for the maxtor software to &quot;clone&quot; the old to the new, the old drive must remain as the &quot;c:&quot; drive.
good luck and let us know.
and life goes on... jack
