first you should know what an integrated graphics card is.
it's simply a graphics &quot;card&quot; or chip(s), really, that are permanently part of the motherboard.
so it's a bunch of chips that are part of your pc's motherboard, including video memory and video display chips.
the bios by default will tell the computer to use the built-in, internal graphics microchips (&quot;card&quot;); without these chips you'd have no display.
the problem with the integrated graphics card is that you cannot add hardware, and thus features like more ram, to it.
to escape from this tyranny (of having no choice in your card's features)you can buy a true &quot;graphics card,&quot; i.e., a card that fits into the card slots (a daughter board) in the computer.
you will then be able to buy the improved features you desire.
this card becomes part of the pc system by the software that comes with the card which tells the pc to use it, how to use it, etc., and not to use the integrated card (and you'll probably have to change the setup bios, it depends on your bios).
there are much more powerful graphic cards than the integrated chip ones, which are usually just adequate in a standard pc.
you can get a card with four times the memory or even more than the integrated card, three times the clock speed (speed), and so on.
but it will cost you $100, $200 or more dollars to buy an &quot;external&quot; daughter board based graphics card with stunning features great for games/graphics.
and be sure its returnable in case it's not compatible with your pc, which can happen.
256mb is not so hefty as far as graphic card (video card) memory goes, btw.
so if you're a gamer, buy a card, install it and game away fast and furiously.
