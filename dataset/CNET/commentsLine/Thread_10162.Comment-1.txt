i recently reformated my xp machine, and re-installed windows xp.
since then i have not been able to connect to the internet through my router, there are several other machines on the network which dont have a problem connecting.
it seems to be nothing to do with the router as i plugged my cable into the back of another pc and the internet ran fine.
my tcp/ip settings are such that it obtains an ip adress automatically, but the ip adress it is getting i think is wrong.
the other pc's get ip addresses starting 192.168.xx.xx, however mine gets something completely different, in device manager my network card says it is working fine.
please help phucbv
