Lot of talk about a simple issue.
Lets condense it: Did you use heat compound or the tape version?
No-then do so.
Yes-move on.
Joseph pointed out something I noticed right away.
Power Supply.
Even a GOOD 300w PS is probably too small for what you have in your box.
I have roughly the same setup and run a 400w PS.
Good luck.
