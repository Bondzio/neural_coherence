1.1.1	Currently I'm running a Intel Pentium D 820 processor on a Compaq sr2050nx PC with a	St
1.2.1	That's a CPU I used in my kids gamer box.	St
1.2.2	What makes you think it's for a server only?	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	btw, it's not a server cpu (those are xeons).	St
1.3.2	p4d 9xx is just a later revision to the p4d 8xx series using 65nm process and twice the l2 cache.	St
1.3.3	9xx runs cooler than the 8xx series.	St
1.3.4	before you buy it, realize that it's only going to be a smidge faster than your existing 820 with the only performance increase coming from the larger cache.	St
1.3.5	p4d 930, 3.0ghz, $100: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116252 p4d 940, 3.2ghz, $190: http://www.upgradebay.com/c1_itemdetail.asp?rid=pricegrabber&itemid=168714989	St
1.4.1	nearly always have references to servers associated with them.	St
1.4.2	That's why the confusion.	St
1.4.3	Do server CPUs run standard Windows OSs like Vista or is server software needed/required to run them?	St
1.4.4	Will a Xeon processor run Vista Business for instance.	St
1.4.5	Would Vista run on a board with dual CPU sockets like this one: http://www.nextag.com/Asus-DSBF-DE-Socket-542041814/prices-html Do stand PC OSs run with server equipment?	St
1.4.6	This is a very basic question but I know very little about servers, that's why I ask.	St
1.5.1	But I skipped the Xeon.	St
1.5.2	The price was way out there.	St
1.5.3	If I were to do that I'd get the one Apple made.	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116258 I have additional information about this board this is as &quot;high end&quot; as it will go.	St
1.6.2	Seams it will not run anything over 2.80 GHZ.	St
1.6.3	The 920 has virtualization that I don't need.	St
1.6.4	My price break was at $100.00.	St
1.6.5	It has dropped below this amount now and seams to less available then a few months ago, so I'm moving on it before it is unavailable/obsolete.	St
1.6.6	My CPU performance number is 4.7 in the Vista performance monitor.	St
1.6.7	I would like to exceed 5.	St
1.6.8	The upper limit is 6.0.	St
1.6.9	I'll be moving the RAM up in the next few months to this: http://www.crucial.com/store/mpartspecs.aspx?mtbpoid=97014715A5CA7304 My current RAM is rated a 4.9 but I think I have more time on this so I'll wait on the RAMs.	St
1.6.10	With these two additions I will have nearly maxed this PC out.	St
1.6.11	Sometime in the future I would like to add a physics card but may need a new power supply to accommodate it first.	St
1.6.12	My current PS is rated at 300 watts and I'm running at it's upper limit, more then likely crossing it's limit at times.	St
1.7.1	I realize these are generally server boards but will they also run a standard PC OS?	St
1.8.1	last shipment date will be on August 8, 2008 for the Pentium D. May 25, 2005 was the original shipping date, that's only three years for God's sakes.	St
1.8.2	From here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_D	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
1.10.1	but one answer will do.	St
1.10.2	Someday I want to be just like you, Bob.	St
1.10.3	A Bob clone.	St
1.10.4	Just kidding Bob, just kidding.	St
1.10.5	By-the-way, I see your only have 2,000 to go before you reach the 100,000 submissions mark.	St
1.10.6	Good work Bob.	St
1.11.1	The usual PC OS's can use the new dual core systems or dual CPUs...	St
1.12.1	Two CPUs .	St
1.12.2	Two separate CPUs running on the same board.	St
1.12.3	See this link: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131550 click on the image of the board for a better look.	St
1.12.4	This particular board does not have the PCI, PCIe slots needed to run as a PC but many of these two CPU boards do.	St
1.12.5	The question is can a standard PC OS handle them?	St
1.12.6	They really aren't much more expensive then a high end PC board but my have many more abilities, like twice the computing power at or below the cost of many PC boards.	St
1.13.1	That's a PC OS?	St
1.14.1	I contacted HP/Compaq today and they said that I can run the entire 900 series of Pentium D processors on this PC.	St
1.14.2	Tom's hardware says this about the 820 and 920 Pentium Ds: http://www23.tomshardware.com/cpu_2007.html?modelx=33&model1=899&model2=891&chart=442 For the cost I think the 915 is the best buy for our multi media needs.	St
1.14.3	Multi media is our primary want/need for this PC.	St
1.14.4	At some time in the future we hope to build a PC.	St
1.14.5	For now this one will do but we want to get as much out of it as we can.	St
1.14.6	Why settle for less?	St
1.15.1	i've never seen any board that supports the p4d 9xxx be fussy about the speed of the cpu.	St
1.15.2	the cpu speed is determined by multipliers in the chip, not something on the board.	St
1.15.3	if it can run a p4d 915, it will be able to run anything up to a p4d 950 because they are all electrically identical.	St
1.15.4	too bad you didn't buy a year ago when a p4d 945 (3.4ghz) was only $125.	St
1.16.1	The Intel Pentium D 915 has been discontinued and is only available at one source for a price above what I want to pay for an &quot;open box&quot; item, $117.00 US.	St
1.16.2	For now I'm switching to a RAM memory up grade instead till I find a better price on the CPU.	St
1.16.3	http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?Item=N82E16820146567 There is a risk that I will not be able to find the chip at all if I wait, a risk I'm willing to take.	St
1.16.4	I'm not expecting a big performance boost from this processor anyway so the price &quot;must&quot; be right, cheap.	St
1.17.1	new, and instock: http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=PD3200F775&cat=CPU and your ballistix ram may not operate at full speed (cl3) with your motherboard if its bios can't be configured for 2.2V memory (the ddr2 standard is 1.8V).	St
1.17.2	save your money and get this 1.8v cl4 kit: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220095	Sug
1.18.1	Crucial confirms it will operate on motherboard.	St
1.18.2	940 CPU may run to hot...820 runs hot now, 915 could replace it but at 2.80 GHz anything higher will over heat and crash it.	St
1.18.3	More power (GHZ) = more heat (C).	St
1.18.4	This is a Firebird all ready.	St
1.18.5	Liquid cooling will not be considered at $250.00-$450.00 to install.	St
1.19.1	the 945 just replaced the 830 in my win2k3 box.	St
1.19.2	the 945 runs cooler because it's a 65nm chip.	St
1.19.3	with a $30 arctic cooler on it the 945 idles in the low 50s and peaks around 62c.	St
1.19.4	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835186134 that ballistix (like any ddr2 stick) will run at stock cl5 settings unless your mobo can give it 2.2V and you set the timings manually.	St
1.20.1	total &quot;real time&quot; Volts both cores 2.52, using SpeedFan as a monitor.	St
1.20.2	C = 57C.	St
1.20.3	This is after heat reductions of &gt;14C that I've been able to achieve using my own methods.	St
1.20.4	Your lowered temperatures may have come from the &quot;enhanced speed step&quot; feature.	St
1.20.5	An improvement I was hoping to get with the 915.	St
1.20.6	In shot, improve performance and at the same time reduce operating temperature.	St
1.20.7	Moving up from 90-nm to 65-nm will increase CPU operating temperature not decrease the operating temperature of the CPU.	St
1.20.8	It does more work at the lower nms processing information more quickly.	St
1.20.9	Increasing The GHZ pushes the information through more quickly.	St
1.20.10	Like a water hose.......larger opening = lower nms, more pressure = more GHZ.	St
1.21.1	just like 45nm core2duos run cooler than their 65nm counterparts.	St
1.21.2	this is due to lower power consumption (lower power = lower heat) and the reason why smaller process is a magic bullet (lower temps and faster potential frequency).	St
1.21.3	in the benchmarks below, notice that a 3.4ghz cedar mill draws less power than a 2.8mhz smithfield.	St
1.21.4	http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/intel/showdoc.aspx?i=2578&p=4 add EIST and the pd 9xxx are very cool chips in comparison to p2 800. http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/intel/showdoc.aspx?i=2578&p=4 http://www.tomshardware.com/2006/01/05/the_65_nm_pentium_d_900s_coming_out_party/page5.html http://www.hothardware.com/Articles/Wolfdale/?page=2 and i'm talking ram voltage, not cpu voltage.	St
1.21.5	those ballistix require 2.2V to achieve their CL3 timings.	St
1.21.6	overall, it's your money, but a 400mhz bump and double the L2 cache is definitely worth $100.	St
1.22.1	http://www.tomshardware.com/2006/01/05/the_65_nm_pentium_d_900s_coming_out_party/page5.html 950 130 W 68.6 C 820 95 W 64.1 C (this one is 4.5C cooler due to the lower Ghz.)	St
1.22.2	Scroll down to the second set of specifications Dual Core Thermal Design Power (900 Series) TDP Tcase 950 130 W 68.6 C 940 130 W 68.6 C 930 95 W 63.4 C 920 95 W 63.4 C (note the 2.8 GHZ 920 is nearly the same temperature maximum as the 820.	St
1.22.3	The 920 is 65-nm technology.	St
1.22.4	The 820 90-nm technology.	St
1.22.5	It's the GHZ not the nm.	St
1.22.6	That's why I wanted the 915.	St
1.22.7	The difference between the 915 and 920 is that the 920 has a virtualization feature.	St
1.22.8	I don't need the virtualization.	St
1.22.9	I want the increased speed of the 65-nm technology without the heat.	St
1.22.10	Increase the GHZ and the temperature of the CPU goes up.)	St
1.22.11	(I don't think were going to agree. )	St
1.22.12	(800 Series) TDP Tcase 840 130 W 69.8 C 830 130 W 69.8 C 820 95 W 64.1 C Yes I did list the wrong voltage for the cores instead of the RAM.	St
1.22.13	I'll look at it again tomorrow.	Sug
1.23.1	those are the figures that the processor is rated to run within (tdp = thermal design power, tcase = max internal case temp), not the actual operating temps.	St
1.23.2	see this: http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/intel/showdoc.aspx?i=2578&p=4 a 3.4ghz 65nm dual core (equiv to pd 940) *actual* power draw under full load is identical to a 2.8ghz 90nm pd 820. here are direct benchmarks of the pd 930 vs the pd 820. http://www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Hardware/Reviews/intel930d/ excerpt: Why is 65nm important?	St
1.23.3	* 65nm allows more cores per wafer, reducing production costs * 65nm runs cooler; the smaller transistors consume less power * smaller transistors that generate less heat can theoretically run faster and why are you concerned over virtualization?	St
1.23.4	it's only used by software like vm-ware or virtual pc and it's not affecting performance in a regular pc at all.	St
1.24.1	so let's go too the horses mouth First a definition: Thermal Design Power http://processorfinder.intel.com/glossary.aspx You'll need to scroll down a bit to find the definition.	St
1.24.2	Now to the Intel specifications: http://processorfinder.intel.com/list.aspx?ProcFam=2112 Click on any you like as GHZ increase the higher the operating temperature allowed.	St
1.24.3	Ummmm, wonder why this is?	St
1.24.4	Could it be they get hotter?	St
1.24.5	Once these maximum operating temperatures are reached many PC will literally stop/crash till the CPU cools down.	St
1.24.6	What's not said or implied is that most PCs run poorly as they approach this maximum, think within 5C or so of maximum.	St
1.24.7	Having experienced this myself I'd say this is true.	Polite
1.24.8	Past the 920 processor little chances.	St
1.24.9	At 920 and above the processors are simply factory overclocked.	St
1.24.10	Frankly, I like your approach.	St
1.24.11	This way is how we learn by getting to the root of things by doing this we strip away the opinion and get to the truth.	St
1.24.12	Thanks for your time on this unfortunately, I can't do the same right now and give this the time, Yet, in large part I already have.	St
1.24.13	Like I said I don't need the virtualization feature.	St
1.24.14	My RAM has been shipped in a few days we'll see if your right about it not working on my PC.	St
1.24.15	I bet it does.	St
1.24.16	I think we've reached an impasse.	St
1.24.17	We're in a loop.	St
1.25.1	i'm only 'arguing' with you because you're denying yourself an effective and inexpensive upgrade.	St
1.25.2	you mistook the pentium 900 series as a 'server' chip and you mistaken in assuming there's no performance benefit beyond 3ghz.	St
1.25.3	TDP = &quot;The maximum amount of heat which a thermal solution must be able to dissipate from the processor *so that the processor will operate under normal operating conditions.	St
1.25.4	*&quot; in other words, TDP is how much heat the cpu cooler has to be able to dissipate to ensure the cpu will function properly... it is not a temperature that the cpu runs at.	St
1.25.5	page 82, table 26 of this document explains it plainly: http://download.intel.com/design/PentiumXE/datashts/31030607.pdf quote: 1.	St
1.25.6	Thermal Design Power (TDP) should be used for processor thermal solution *design targets*.	St
1.25.7	The TDP is not the maximum power that the processor can dissipate.	St
1.25.8	2.	St
1.25.9	This table shows the maximum TDP for a given frequency range.	St
1.25.10	*Individual processors may have a lower TDP*.	St
1.25.11	There's an overlap for the 3.2-3.6ghz range because the later D0 stepping of the 900 series (which includes all 9x5 processors) runs cooler than the original B1 stepping.	St
1.25.12	Thus any pentium d 900 series you purchase now will have a TDP of only 95W which is the same as the TDP of the lower speed 800 series.	St
1.25.13	This is proven in your link: http://processorfinder.intel.com/list.aspx?ProcFam=2112 here's the 3.4ghz 950 D0 stepping, tdp=95W, tspec=63.4C: http://processorfinder.intel.com/details.aspx?sSpec=SL9K8, and the 2.8ghz 820, tdp=95W, tpec=64.1C: http://processorfinder.intel.com/details.aspx?sSpec=SL88T .	St
1.25.14	By design, the 900 series is no hotter than the 800 series and in real world use a 3.4ghz 900 series runs cooler than the 820. all pentium Ds will throttle back if they overheat (about 71c).	St
1.25.15	as you said, the faster a processor is the more heat it generates.	St
1.25.16	but the cpu cooler removes (dissipates) that heat.	St
1.25.17	so, a faster processor will make a heatsink/fan work harder but if the cooler is designed properly and can meet the tdp spec, the cpu will not overheat and will not slow down.	St
1.25.18	my 945 with an arctic freezer pro never goes above 61C, *never* throttles, and *never* sounds like the jet engine that spun up when the 820 got busy.	St
1.25.19	throttling is seperate from eist (enhanced intel speedstep).	St
1.25.20	eist slows down a cpu based on load to *avoid heat buildup*.	St
1.25.21	so if the cpu load is low, the cpu may slow down by 30% or more.	St
1.25.22	eist is adjustable and can be disabled; throttling cannot.	St
1.25.23	no intel processors are 'factory overclocked'.	St
1.25.24	intel has a strict 'no overclocking' policy and will not warrant any processor that is run outside its stated operating frequencies.	St
1.25.25	intel tests each cpu to determine what speed it can reliably run at.	St
1.25.26	once that speed is identified, the speed is then programmed into a multiplier on the cpu package (the mini-chips on the bottom of the processor: http://images.anandtech.com/reviews/cpu/cheapdualcore/pentium_d.jpg ).	St
1.25.27	so a 3.4ghz pd 945 is running within spec and is fully warranteed by intel to last just as a long as 2.8ghz cpu.	St
1.25.28	one last link: http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?articleid=1988&page=20 quote: Intel's second generation of dual core processors is much better than its first.	St
1.25.29	The 65 nanometer Presler core is still quite an energy hog, but it doesn't produce as much heat and thanks to the larger L2 cache, is clock for clock faster than the Intel Pentium D 800 series processors.	St
1.25.30	The Intel Pentium D 940 is the ideal processor for a Socket 775 user who's looking to upgrade.	St
1.25.31	The 2MB L2 cache gives it a performance boost over the Pentium D 800-series, and the smaller 65nm manufacturing process means less noise and heat to deal with.	St
1.26.1	From your post: &quot;all pentium Ds will throttle back if they overheat (about 71c).	St
1.26.2	as you said, the faster a processor is the more heat it generates.	St
1.26.3	but the cpu cooler removes (dissipates) that heat.	St
1.26.4	so, a faster processor will make a heatsink/fan work harder but if the cooler is designed properly and can meet the tdp spec, the cpu will not overheat and will not slow down.	St
1.26.5	my 945 with an arctic freezer pro never goes above 61C, *never* throttles, and *never* sounds like the jet engine that spun up when the 820 got busy.&quot; What I haven't said is that in the upper ranges of the CPUs operating temperatures they run poorly.	St
1.26.6	Within 5C or so of maximum.	St
1.26.7	Mine shuts down at around 64C.	St
1.26.8	Thank you for your elaborate argument but I'm not convinced.	St
1.26.9	I might be Dah but I wouldn't count on it.	St
1.26.10	Again, really good information!	Polite
1.26.11	Your time is appreciated.	St
1.26.12	If you don't volunteer on Cnet; please do.	Ques
1.26.13	There are many that could use your help.	St
1.26.14	It's a thankless job, basically we just keep them happy so there computing experience is a good one.	St

1.26.16	I suppose I simple might be delusional, thinking that way but that's why I do it.	St
1.26.17	Sounds good anyway.	Polite
1.27.1	This is a good site for the thermal dynamics of CPU cooler: http://www.dansdata.com/coolercomp.htm I like this brand: Scythe: http://www.scythe-usa.com/product/cpu_top.html I like these fans: http://www.acousticpc.com/noctua_fans.html For the price this is a best Arctic Silver product: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835100007 Currently I am not using these.	St
1.27.2	I have other priorities at the moment, like RAM.	St
1.28.1	then you have inadequate cooling and you're basing your opinion on a configuration with a cooling problem.	St
1.28.2	that's like judging a car model's performance based on the performance of one car that has a bad head gasket.	St
1.28.3	when intel first introduced the p4d they emphasized that it requires specific processor and case cooling requirements (that's what in all the design documents) and it ran too hot for the run-of-the-mill socket 478/socket a/socket 754 coolers and cluttered pc internals that were commonplace at the time.	St
1.28.4	i'm not making an 'elaborate argument.'	St
1.28.5	i'm only stating facts that you can verify for yourself with the links provided.	St
1.28.6	p4d 940's tdp and tcase are identical to p4d 820. that's a fact, plain and simple.	St
1.28.7	intel sells a 3.6ghz p4d and it warrants that it run day and night for 3 years at that frequency with proper cooling/ventilation.	St
1.28.8	if you want to second-guess intel, that's your perogative but I trust intel and my 3.4ghz p4d has been humming along for nearly two years without issue.	St
1.29.1	The first factory equipped unit was inadequate so we up graded it.	St
1.29.2	From your post: &quot;they emphasized that it requires specific processor and case cooling requirements.&quot; I am familiar with these specifications and have in fact brought this PC into compliance with them.	St
1.29.3	The CPU cooler did work, two additional fans worked but the duct they recommend did nothing.	St
1.29.4	We had added one of the fans prior to becoming aware of there recommendation, to assist in the cooling of our graphics card and Ethernet Adapter.	St
1.29.5	In my opinion they could review these again.	St
1.29.6	The sum total gain of there over all recommendation was in actually maybe &gt;2C.	St
1.29.7	The combined total peak/dust free gain was 8C including the improvements I made; the CPU cooler and the additional fan.	St
1.29.8	Neither fan is standard PC box fan.	St
1.29.9	This might be of interest to you.	St
1.29.10	I need someone to do an independent test to confirm my observations.	St
1.29.11	It would cost you $30.00&lt;.	St
