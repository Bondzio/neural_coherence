<s> hello everyone. </s>
<s> I have an old Hp pavilion a730n desktop and I want to install windows 7 rc1 on it. </s>
<s> now, when I ran the win7 upgrade advisor it told me to upgrade the graphics card (so I can enjoy the aero graphics! </s>
<s> I was wondering what good but not expensive graphics card you recommend for my system? </s>
<s> (preferably PCI Express x16 compatible, My MB has one) thnx in advance Overview of specs: CPU: Intel Pentium 4 3.0 GHZ (800MHZ FSB) RAM: 2.50 GB of DDR1-400 SDRAM MotherBoard: ASUS PTGD1-LA If u need more details: here is the complete details of my system: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&docname=c00233082#N307 </s>

<s> I Found this video card at Newegg : EVGA 256-P2-N753-TR GeForce 8600 GT : http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130297 it's 39.99 after 10$ MiR. </s>
<s> (which is great! </s>
<s> )would this card be compatible with my system? </s>
<s> here is my system specs: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&docname=c00233082 (except RAM = 2.50 GB) </s>
<s> the 8600GT, is really outdated. </s>
<s> Here's something newer that does not require a separate power source and is fanless ... translates into less noise. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102828 VAPCMD </s>
<s> I might actually get this one (I'll try waiting for free shipping). </s>
<s> while taking a look at my pc's inner parts I found out that my power supply doesn't have a pci express power cord (weird given the fact that I have a pci e slot) anyway thnx a lot. </s>
<s> VAPCMD, this card is the strongest candidate to buy so far.... </s>
<s> which nvidia card is comparable to the ati hd4350? </s>
<s> A comparable nvidia card would be the 9400GT I'd go with this one http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121267 (more bang for the buck) XXXXXX T PS. </s>
<s> I have an old 128meg 6600GT (similar performance as the 9400GT) in my old box (A64 3700+ SanDiego/1GBRAM) and get constant 60fps on Doom 3 @1280x1024/medium detail. </s>
<s> what will be using the PC for ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I just Wanna Install Win 7 RC 1 on it and be able to turn windows aero on. </s>
<s> thats all, and maybe some not so demanding games here and there. </s>
<s> (so my siblings can be entertained). </s>
<s> I'm actually gonna build a gaming rig later on (as soon as I can save enough $$$$$)so I'll probably be posting a lot of questions about that... </s>
<s> thnx for the taking the time to search for that deal.. </s>
<s> I'll consider it. </s>
<s> I have another question thou for anyone who knows. </s>
<s> Will that PCIe x16 2.0 card work with a MB that only has PCIe x16? </s>
<s> PCIe 2.0 is backwards compatible. </s>
<s> I had my HD4830 card in the old box while I waited for my new MoBo to arrive (took almost a month around x-mas) XXXXXX T </s>
<s> Thnx </s>
<s> this is the video card I bought: nvidia geforce 9400 gt. </s>
