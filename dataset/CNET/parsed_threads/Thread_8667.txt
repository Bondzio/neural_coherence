<s> Good Day, I know laugh at the newbiee.. however I have the following system on order and am waiting for it to arrive. </s>
<s> eMachines T6524 AMD Athlon 64 3500+ 2.2GHz / 1GB DDR / 200GB HDD / Dual Layer DVDRW/ Integrated ATI Radeon Xpress 200 / Flash Media Reader / Windows XP Media Center 2005 /. </s>
<s> Now all that looks real pretty to me being a novice and upgrading from an HP pavilion v70s running the Windows XP Home edtion. </s>
<s> I also have an XBOX 360 and am wating to see how the two inter-react with each other. </s>
<s> I have discovered CNET and am looking for a breakdown of the specs as to what it is, what it does and and how to upgrade if possible. </s>
<s> I have been bouncing around seeking information. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Ok, so let's break down what you are getting into a few different pieces here: Model #: eMachines T6524 CPU: AMD Athlon 64 3500+ 2.2GHz RAM: 1GB DDR HD: 200GB capicity Optical drive: Dual Layer DVDRW Graphics Card: Integrated ATI Radeon Xpress 200 Flash Media Reader (Not sure on this) O/S: Windows XP Media Center 2005. </s>
<s> So, let's go through this bit by bit: CPU: AMD is Advanced Micro Devices and are a very well known CPU maker, Intel is the other big kahuna here. </s>
<s> The &quot;Athlon 64&quot; is a model number so that you have a 64 bit processor using the Athlon line as opposed to their budget one. </s>
<s> The 3500+ is a performance index, some of the other ones go up to 5000+ in the newest 64 X2 which is a dual core ones. </s>
<s> The 2.2 GHz is the CPU speed. </s>
<s> RAM: This is the Random Access Memory and is where things are stored in memory when your computer is running usually. </s>
<s> Bigger is better and 1 GB is a little above the common minimum of 512 MB in most new systems. </s>
<s> My current laptop for example has 2 GB of RAM but then part of that is I wanted extra RAM in my machine since I tend to have some applications that use quite a bit like Microsoft's Visual Studio. </s>
<s> HD: Hard drive is where you store various files. </s>
<s> 200 GB is a decent sized HD though some go for the big stuff like 500 GB or that new one from Seagate that has 750 GB for the upper threshold. </s>
<s> My laptop has a mere 75 GB so your new one beats that. </s>
<s> Dual Layer DVDRW: This indicates that it can read and write DVDs which is a feature on my laptop though my previous desktop didn't have a DVD drive. </s>
<s> Graphics Card: Some will call this a video card and it is the same thing, it is what translates the computer code into a display and the more memory the better on these and depending on what games you'd play you may need some of the top of the line ones. </s>
<s> Flash Media Reader: I have no clue on this, sorry. </s>
<s> O/S: Windows XP Media Center 2005. </s>
<s> Microsoft puts out a few different flavors of XP and generally there are 3 kinds for most folks: Home, Media Center and Pro. </s>
<s> Home is the simplest and doesn't have many bells and whistles. </s>
<s> Pro is what most companies have and does have a few special add-ons since this is commonly used on networks. </s>
<s> Then there is the Media Center edition which I'm still researching a bit but seems to have some special things for audio and video and most systems have a built in TV tuner and other features to make their computer into an all-in-one entertainment center. </s>
<s> Hopefully that helps decode things somewhat. </s>
<s> If you want further answers just ask as this was a general stab at things. </s>
<s> Regards, JB </s>
<s> Thanks JB, I'm getting the system for a fair price..from Tigerdirect. </s>
<s> I'm looking forward to the challenge of trying to understand all this &quot;TECH&quot; I've seen both good & bad comments on this system CNET seems to have given it a 7 of 10. </s>
<s> Looking forward to getting the biggest bag for my buck with further research. </s>
<s> Once again thanks for your kind & knowledgeable reply. </s>
<s> Movin </s>
<s> That ''ATI Radeon Xpress 200'' is not a dedicated video card. </s>
<s> It is video circuitry integrated into the motherboard that uses some of the slower system memory (RAM). </s>
<s> To make the system a good gaming computer, many have added a dedicated video card (one that has its own very fast memory) to the empty PCI Express X16 slot in the motherboard and disabled the onboard video. </s>
<s> This also means that they install a higher Wattage power supply unit (PSU) to handle the video card. </s>
<s> Thanks for the explanation and advice. </s>
<s> I'm looking forward to playing with the system and with a little help from CNET forums getting the big bang for my $$ thanks again Movin </s>
