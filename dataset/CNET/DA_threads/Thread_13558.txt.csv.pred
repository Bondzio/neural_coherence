Ques
1.1.3	and my monitor is pretty dark no matter how high brightness is	St
1.2.1	I recommend trying it on another monitor to see if the problem follows .	St
1.2.2	You did not say how your monitor worked b4 the new card .	St
1.2.3	If you swap parts to isolate the problem you can often narrow down the problem area to find a solution .	St
1.2.4	If the same prob shows on another monitor that would indicate not a monitor specific prob .	St
1.2.5	The same for video card , cables and drivers .	St
1.3.1	If you use extra video cable , reduce it to the only the orginal VGA cable , check results .	St
1.3.2	If the problem persists , then use that warranty NOW !	St
1.3.3	Of course try to adjust the monitor for best results , otherwise you have a bad monitor , maybe caused by shipping , etc .	St
1.3.4	Cjeck also for any bent , pushed , otherwise odd looking pins on all the VGA cable ( s ) .	St
1.3.5	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.4.1	i already RMA'ed my video card and they sent me a brand new one againa nd its still doing it	St
1.5.1	You 've already gotten some good suggestions , like swapping things around .	St
1.5.2	FWIW , I 'll add the following .	St
1.5.3	What size monitor is it ?	Ques
1.5.4	Is the video cable built-in or does it plug into the monitor ?	Ques
1.5.5	When I got this 19 inch monitor I found that text was kind of blurry .	St
1.5.6	There was a sort of ghost effect .	St
1.5.7	This may be similar to what you 've been seeing .	St
1.5.8	I ca n't tell .	St
1.5.9	The cable on this monitor is not built-in and the cable I was using was pretty lightweight and not well shielded .	St
1.5.10	When I replaced it with a & quot ; heavy duty & quot ; , shielded , video cable , the problem cleared right up .	St
1.5.11	If your problem started when you changed video cards , maybe the signal on the new video card is n't quite as strong as the old card or something , so you need a better cable .	St
1.5.12	If your video cable plugs into your monitor , you might try a new , & quot ; heavy duty & quot ; and shielded , video cable .	St
1.5.13	Especially if you have a large monitor , since they apparently require a better video signal .	St
1.5.14	Cables like this can be had fairly cheap .	St
1.5.15	I got this one on eBay for around $ 12 as I recall .	St
