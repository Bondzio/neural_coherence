<s> My Thumb Drive out of no where can't be read by any system, from PC to Laptop. </s>
<s> All my hard work lost, is there any possible way to get my data back. </s>
<s> when my thumb drive can't be detach at all? </s>
<s> A thumb drive is a nice way to transport data between PC's and also as a medium for backup (siince it's only one of your backup media it's not a problem if the data on it is lost then). </s>
<s> But it definitely is a bad place to store your only copy of data, especially if it contains the result of 'hard work'. </s>
<s> Although it's better than an external hard disk, your experience proves that it isn't fail-safe. </s>
<s> Nothing is fail-safe, by the way. </s>
<s> If your work is worth more than, say, USD 1000, you can consider to contact drivesavers.com or some other trusted data recovery company. </s>

<s> While I always put it under a microscope I'm encountering a lot of folk that demand details beyond what can be written here. </s>
<s> For example solder can crack and under the high power microscope we look for that and touch up the solder work. </s>
<s> But nobody that doesn't do this today should attempt this when this is the last copy. </s>
<s> For the uninitiated you tell them to contact drivesavers and repeat these are great ways to transport but never a place for the last copy. </s>

<s> Any errors or some display of why it can't do what it did before. </s>
<s> Google for rescue/recovery s/w and check the results. </s>
<s> However, if it can't even see that a device is really there, you're hosed. </s>
<s> ALWAYS have multiple sources stored of your precious data, now you know why. </s>
<s> adios -----Willy </s>
<s> files are accessible. </s>
<s> I don't know why this works, but sometimes it does. </s>
<s> Keep the chill times short, no more than 20 minutes, and check. </s>
<s> If no, then set it aside for an hour or so and try again. </s>
<s> Don't give up. </s>
<s> I managed to get data back after 6 weeks of multiple tries. </s>
<s> A drive like this may become usable after a period of time of non-use, but that's not a certain thing. </s>
<s> It happened with one of mine. </s>
