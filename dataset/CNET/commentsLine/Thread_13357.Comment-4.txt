right out of the box there was a bug/defect.
at 3 months i had the time to call it in.
8 hours on the phone and they take it back.
what's not good about what happened next is that they returned it in far worse shape than they got it.
before it had a bug.
after their repair it would lock up in minutes.
to make matters worse the support calls were answers with &quot;we've done all we could.&quot; at 9 months i called it my last hp.
