1.1.1	Ok here is my question.	St
1.1.2	I have an Emachiene T5212 ( http://reviews.cnet.com/eMachines_T5212/4507-3118_7-32085027.html?tag=sub ) and the specs say it has a max Video RAM of 128MB.	St
1.1.3	I was hoping to put in a direct x10 video card, but now it doesnt seam to be possiable.	St
1.1.4	My question is, can I add 2 video cards each having 128MB or can my computer only handle a total od 128MB, and does anyone have any suggestions on a good card.	St
1.1.5	Thanks!!!!!	St
1.1.6	!	St
1.2.1	Dual video board is not possible as far as I can see.	St
1.2.2	but dx10 is possible; look at some of the pci-express board above $300.	St
1.2.3	I think some of them have dx10 support.	St
1.2.4	http://www.mwave.com/mwave/viewspec.hmx?scriteria=3000752	St
1.3.1	Your emachines 5212 has a pci-express slot allowing 1 video card to be added.	St
1.3.2	(The pci-express video card will override your built-in video.)	St
1.3.3	The main contstraint is your power supply.	St
1.3.4	Its power rating is not listed in the PC's specifications but it's probably 300W.	St
1.3.5	Without upgrading your power supply you could add a geForce 8500 based card.	St
1.3.6	here's a msi 8500gt/256mb for $100 .	St
1.3.7	if you're willing to add a 400W (or better) power supply ($30-$40 or so) you could move up to a 8600gt for about $150 or a 8600gts for $170-$190.	St
1.4.1	8600GT- 300W recommended minimum PS.	St
1.4.2	I have one in my Dell E521 which is 305W.	St
1.4.3	Big improvement over what I had (X1300 Pro).	St
1.4.4	BTW ati recommended minimum is 350W even though Dell offers it on the E521.	St
1.4.5	Dell underrates their PSU's a bit though.	St
