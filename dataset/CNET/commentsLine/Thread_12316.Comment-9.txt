smc 7004awbr with firmware 1.41.004 was noted as not passing the ip address in 2003. here again the details are causing me pause.
maybe they fixed that in later firmware?
there is also a chance that many routers will never pass the ip address even if a http proxy setting is enabled or disabled.
you haven't told how you set yours or the firmware version.
i now have a complete picture of the issue and grasp what you want to do, but details are important to see whether you are able to flip a setting or it's a new router for you.
