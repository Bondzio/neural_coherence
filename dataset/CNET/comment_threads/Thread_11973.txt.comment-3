I was instructed by both game companies to do that, still doesn't work.
Tehy also suggested doing some kind of RAM check, so i just didn't bother and bought 2 new 1 gigabyte sticks of RAM, still did it.
I can't afford a new video card, and Im sure there's some kind of fix for this, as I am sure that Im not the only one hwo has had this happen.
