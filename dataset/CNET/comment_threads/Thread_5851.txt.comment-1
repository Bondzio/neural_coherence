I have previously burned a DVD-RW (Verbatin) with all of my downloaded software installation programs.
The DVD was previously UDF formatted using InCD Version 4.3.23.2.
I have previously used the DVD-RW to write to and retrieve files.
This time, I loaded the DVD in my drive to extract one of the files and the computer rebooted every time that I tried.
Ultimately, I got an error message telling me that there was a critical error on the disk and the disk would be marked as read only to protect the data.
However, there appears to be nothing on the DVD now.
When I insert it in the DVD drive, it seems to be labeled &quot;InCD Auto-Formattable&quot; I've tried to read the DVD on 2 computers with the same results.
Does anyone know how I can retrieve the lost data?
