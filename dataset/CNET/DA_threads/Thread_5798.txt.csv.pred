1.1.1	Hello folks , I am in need of a portable scanner .	St
1.1.2	The one that perfectly fits the bill is , VuPoint Magic Wand but its not in the market yet .	St
1.1.3	According to the customer service , it will be available by November this year , so I guess , they are prepping for holiday season .	St
1.1.4	I wonder if there is any other product similar to this .	St
1.1.5	There was one from PanDigital but I doubt they make it anymore ( and their customer service is close to pathetic so I am not interested in their product ) .	St
1.1.6	Will be glad to know .	St
1.1.7	Many thanks in advance .	Polite
1.2.1	Just one link google found for PORTABLE SCANNER : http : //www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2363822,00.asp Also have a look at http : //www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_11 ? url=search-alias % 3Daps & field-keywords=portable+scanner & sprefix=portable+sc % 2Caps % 2C363 I even see a VuPoint Magic Wand with the note : & quot ; Only 5 left in stock .	St
1.2.2	Order soon. & quot ; It 's 900 dpi in stead of the 1200 dpi that is n't available yet .	St
1.2.3	Since you do n't tell WHY the 1200 dpi would be perfect , it could be a 900 dpi is good enough .	St
1.2.4	Personally I never scan with more that 400 dpi , I think .	St
1.2.5	Kees	St
1.3.1	If you look at the link I posted , that scanner acts as a wand as well as a dock and I exactly need these 2 features .	St
1.3.2	Otherwise there are literally tons of scanners with feeder only option like Fujitsu S1100 or Neat Receipts on cheaper side .	St
1.3.3	In my use , sometimes I will have to feed the documents ( little crumpled ) and sometimes I will have to scan them with wand ( book or magazine , edges taken into account ) .	St
1.3.4	Hence the one mentioned in original post .	St
1.3.5	The link you posted does n't have any of the type I need but are wand only or feeder only .	St
1.3.6	I tried wand only but did not work for crumpled but neat worked pretty well .	St
1.3.7	So preferring 2-in-1 type scanner .	St
