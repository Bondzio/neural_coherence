The manual and asus screen after post tells you to press delete. I have held delete down, tapped it repeatedly and only got into Bios once after updating the it. Any ideas?

I can then go in and put some overclocking settings. I want to do this in small increments but it's not much good id I have to change the jumpers for cmos every time I want into the Bios! Sorry for the delay, I couldn't get into CNET.COM all weekend!

I've encountered boards that you have to reset the BIOS if the overclock fails. Nothing busted about that. I wish you would have revealed that nugget early so we could have saved a few exchanges. Bob

I found the real delete key and it works and I am delighted but so sorry for wasting your time. I am now reading my keyboard like never before. Thank you and sorry again!
