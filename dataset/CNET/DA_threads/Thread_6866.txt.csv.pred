1.1.1	I have a Maxtor One Touch 200gb external hard drive that has given me some issues.	St
1.1.2	I use it primarily on my laptop, a Dell Latitude d610.	St
1.1.3	Now, I started having problems when I tried to access certain folders in the drive.	St
1.1.4	I would double-click them, and My Computer (I sound like an idiot, but whatever you call the thing you browse your hard drive with) froze up.	St
1.1.5	This happened repeatedly and consistently.	St
1.1.6	I was told to run a disk check (chkdsk or whatever), and many sections were found to be 'unreadable.'	St
1.1.7	Finally, I formatted the entire hard drive, since I couldn't access anything on there anyway.	St
1.1.8	Now, at least from some initial testing, it seems to work fine.	St
1.1.9	However, I barely have anything on it at the moment, so the problem could still be there.	St
1.1.10	Anyone know what is going on?	St
1.1.11	I'm kind of a newb, so feel free to remind me if I've forgotten to include anything.	St
1.2.1	If so it's known to corrupt at times.	St
1.2.2	Here's a search about how to convert to a safer NTFS volume.	St
1.2.3	http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=CONVERT+TO+NTFS bOB	St
1.3.1	Alas, no, it is NTFS.	St
1.3.2	=/	St
1.4.1	Sorry but with so little clues I have to write the drive is dying or you don't backup your files.	St
1.4.2	External hard disks are fine copies but not a backup!	Polite
1.4.3	Read this recent reply about free tools.	St
