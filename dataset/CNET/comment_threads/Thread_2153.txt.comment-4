There are buckets of discussions about broken PCs and here's the bottom line.
There is no exact process to fix a dead PC.
Sure we could take the old swap it piece by piece approach but let's upgrade that a little.
1.
Some parts are not needed to boot.
A keyboard, CD/DVD drive, and then one stick of ram.
2.
When swapping parts and no one knows which is bad, I have advice for our techs.
Ready?
It's a wowser.
-&gt; Change the cheapest part first.
