let's assume that your computer has a 250 watt power supply and your monitor runs at 100 watts.
for a 24 hour period the energy consumption for just these two items is 8400 watt-hours or 8.4 kwhs.
if these items are on for 30 days each month - you are using 252 kwatthours per month.
if we assume a conservative estimate of $0.10 per kwh from your electric company, then you are spending $25 per month by leaving your computer running 24 hours each day.
