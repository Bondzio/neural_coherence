<s> I have an WD 80 GB hd and only 74 GB IDE is useable. </s>
<s> When reformatting and partitioning, can the 6 GB be reclaimed? </s>
<s> Thanks Ben </s>
<s> Keep in mind that the drive is 80 billion bytes and not 80 gigabytes. </s>
<s> Let's convert that 74 GB to billions and see what we get? </s>
<s> 1 GB = 1,073,741,824 so 74 time 1,073,741,824 is... 79,456,894,976 bytes or very close to the drives capacity. </s>
<s> The remaining &quot;loss&quot; could be some fraction you didn't note or space consumed by the format which is correct. </s>
<s> There. </s>
<s> We've reclaimed the missing space. </s>

<s> Are you sure that you aren't getting 6 GB lost by converting from bytes to Gigabytes? </s>
<s> If 1024 Bytes = 1 Kilobyte, 1024 Kilobytes = 1 Megabyte, and 1024 Megabytes = 1 Gigabyte, then 1,073,741,824 bytes = 1 Gigabyte and so, 80,000,000,000 bytes = 74.50580596923828125 GB which is where you are getting 74 GB from as I have a couple machines with similar drives. </s>

<s> CP / Disk Management shows &quot;C&quot; with 34.18 GB NTFS, and &quot;D&quot; with 40.34 GB NTFS (both show healthy) Note, this is in GB, referring to an 80 GB drive. </s>
<s> I think I found the answer on Google. </s>
<s> Following taken from Google hit... &quot;Because your system reserves 5% for root. </s>
<s> Even when the filesystem is full there is some space to root fix the things. </s>
<s> This extra space can be used only by root.&quot; Thanks Ben p.s. </s>
<s> Just curious... could the 5% space be recovered if wanted? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> It's an 80 billion byte drive. </s>
<s> Tell me the make and model number of the drive so we can confirm that. </s>

<s> Only in computers is there a discrepency. </s>
