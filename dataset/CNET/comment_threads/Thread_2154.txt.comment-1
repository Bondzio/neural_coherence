I have a VPR Matrix Series 210, Model FT-6100 running XP home edition with SP 2, 2.53 ghz P4 with 512 MB ram.
Ok here's the problem, while running it will shut itself off and restart out of the blue... no warning, no blue screen of death nothing, just boom restart.
After restarting it does a normal load and comes up to say that it has recovered from a serious error and links to Mircosofts utility.
The Utility says to upgrade my bios.
My question how do I know that this is problem?
Second if it is the problems how do I go about upgrading my bios...
I have always been under the impression that it was hardwired into the motherboard.
And third will this fubar the rest of the components in my box?
Any and all help will be greatly appreciated.
