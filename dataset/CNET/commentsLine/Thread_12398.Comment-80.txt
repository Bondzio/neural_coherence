hi all, i went to look at printers today and all the solid ink ones i tried did the flaking/rubbing/scratching off thing we all have seen.
even some of the lower end laser printers rubbed off on the metallic card stocks.
i found the more expensive the machine, the toner did not come off.
unfortunately, running a small home-based studio like most of us do, the size/expense of these larger machines just won't work.
i have one dealer looking into the phaser 6360 as of now, i'll let you know if that one works.
i demoed the xerox work centre 7328 and the docu-color 242 (which is amazing, but also the price of a mid-size car)...the 7328 is a good lease option or maybe to get a refurbished machine.
it handled the card stock very well and had settings that handled textured stocks as well.
i do like xerox because they easily take small sizes which is a must for invitation design.
anyways i am keeping my fingers crossed for the 6360...
