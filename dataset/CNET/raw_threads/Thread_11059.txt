I have one computer with a Linksys Wireless G PCI Adapter in it. I have it wirelessly connected to my 2wire modem in another room. In the same room as my PC, I have another PC that I would like to get the internet connection shared onto. Now, I have a netgear wireless router with 4 Ethernet ports on it, the WGR614 v6 router. I was thinking I could simply plug both computers into this router, and set up a shared internet connection that way, but everytime I plug in this router it seems to disrupt my wireless internet connection, however then the two PCs are networked fine. Only no internet! Can anything be done about this short of buying a wired-only router?

Did you follow the installation instructions for the Netgear router? Typical setup: Internet --- modem --- wireless router --- computers The connection between the wireless router and the computers may be wired or wireless.

However, in this case I only have one wireless modem, one wireless router, and one wireless network card. I can only connect to the modem with the wireless card. So my question is is it more worth it to get the two computers networked or to just buy another wireless card for it?

You wouldn't need another wireless router. Am I missing something?

Steps to disable the netgear's routing features: + get the ip address of a PC connected to the linksys. (in winxp, open a dos box, and ipconfig.) + plug 1 pc into the netgear but leave the netgear disconnected from the linksys + log in to the netgear's web interface (you'll need to know the IP address of the netgear; usually its 192.168.0.1) + open the wireless section, select disabled and click apply + open the WAN section, choose dynamic IP address and click apply + open the dhcp section, select disabled and click apply + open the LAN section, and enter the ip address of the PC replacing the last digits with 255 (e.g.: 192.168.0.13 becomes 192.168.0.255); save this address since you'll need to use it access the netgear's admin interface + let the netgear restart then turn it off + plug the netgear into the linksys using a regular (downlink) port (not the netgear's uplink port) + turn on the netgear + plug the other pc(s) into the netgear the netgear should be acting as a switch now. you'll only have 3 available port since 1 will be used to connect it to the linksys.
