Then you need to go to techbargains.com and search the Dell section for their online coupon codes.
I'm not wild about Dell's customer service (long wait times, mostly under educated), but their systems are not the worst you will find (their customization options are quite extensive).
If you are at all space conscious you could also get a notebook with an external monitor connector; for $1000 dollars you get a lot of notebook these days.
