i'm looking for a brand/model of a network media player to use at our company building.
essentially, the functionality we need is as follows: connects to hdtv and ethernet can be used to display pictures, documents, presentations, and videos can be controlled remotely from other areas of the building through the network.
preferably, i'd like someone to be able to upload a file to the device (or possibly a network share that the device has access to), and have their file display on the screen, all from within their office without having to actually be in front of the tv with a remote in their hand.
previously, we had this functionality with a device known as minibox hd from agn pro, but the company has since gone out of business, and the devices no longer work.
we tried using wd tv, but it was impossible to control these remotely without looking at the screen.
does anyone know of a comparable device?
