I'm sure you read the following. &quot;Our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 LGA 1155 Core i5-2500K and a $1000 LGA 2011 Core i7-3960X, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved. It turns out that memory bandwidth and PCIe throughput don't hold back the performance of existing Sandy Bridge-based machines. &quot; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-cpu-review-overclock,3106-4.html That answers the CPU question fast enough. 2. The current GPU list today link follows. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html 3. RAM. 4GB to start, 8GB is nice, for bragging rights, get more. Bob
