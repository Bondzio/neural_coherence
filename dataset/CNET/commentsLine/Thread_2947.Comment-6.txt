agp is an acronym for advanced graphics port and was specifically designed for video hardware accelerators (ie; video cards).
pci stands for peripheral component interface(or interconnect) and was an industry upgrade from isa.
in terms of raw speed at which each one performs, in order from highest to lowest it's: agp, pci, isa.
much of what is developed today in terms of video (either games or applications) is geared to the faster ports (agp).
a new standard, which is pci-x ( or pci express) is faster than agp, but is only available with the newest generation of hardware.
