i am looking for a good quality printer, good sharp text and colored graphics once in a while.
i am plan to use this for school/work processes in the home and am deciding which one would be best for me.
why is laser so much more expensive when i see that the ppm is even less on, for example, hp laserjet 2600n compared to other hp injets?
i will be printing text often and i don't want to have to run out of ink very quick.
good speed would be nice too but it doesn't have to be lightning quick or anything.
thanks in advance.
how is the hp laserjet 2600n compared to mainstream, a lot chepaer, hp injets?
i think the inkjets' ink will need to be replaced a lot sooner but quality/speed wise?
affordibility/sheet ect.
thanks
