<s> i read it in an archived post. </s>
<s> is it true that the 64 cpu can run as hot as that before any problems occur? </s>
<s> my setup is an amd 64 3200, 600 watt psu, radeon x700, 2.5 gig ram ( the ram was on sale so i got it cheap). </s>
<s> running the new madden and the cpu temp got up to a balmy 67c. </s>
<s> ventilation is good. </s>
<s> dont know about fans. </s>
<s> 2 inside case, one on video card. </s>
<s> am i travelling into the danger zone, and writing checks my machine cant cash? </s>
<s> thanks in advance. </s>

<s> as i looked more closely that reading was for GPU, not CPU. </s>
<s> 55 year old eyes. </s>
<s> so a GPU temp of 67c. </s>
<s> not sure what that means. </s>
<s> But I've seen GPUs in that range. </s>
<s> looks as if some gpu run even hotter than that. </s>
<s> im just not sure as to what is acceptable. </s>
<s> it seems to depend on the card. </s>

<s> sapphire says it will run with 300 watts. </s>
<s> That running power supplies at full load is never a good idea. </s>
<s> I have a few truckloads of failed supplies to show for it (various repair shops). </s>
<s> Keep an eye out for random reboots and don't ignore the signs. </s>
<s> Also it can strain the motherboard capacitors since they have to work harder. </s>

<s> i have to say, the screen is beautiful, and the speed of the card is great. </s>
<s> i'm spoiled now by how nicely it runs. </s>
<s> i'm waiting to get the official word on temps from sapphire support. </s>
<s> will post when i find out. </s>
<s> i could go back to the x550, but its just not quite as effective a card. </s>
<s> thanks for your input bob regards richard </s>
<s> Are you sure the GPU fan cooler is running/working ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Did you try to overclock it? </s>
<s> 80-90c is the danger zone on this card. </s>
<s> up to 70c is fine. </s>
<s> gives me some degrees of freedom. </s>
<s> whew. </s>
<s> i just hope that i don't go into overtime too many times on madden 07! </s>
<s> p.s. </s>
<s> i'm happy with the card as it is - no overclocking necessary for me with this baby. </s>
<s> happy and healthy computing to all! </s>
