1.1.2	I have a switch that transfers 200mbps , and a cat6 cable that can transfer 200mbps also .	St
1.1.3	Does that mean i just need to find an ethernet port to connect up to 200mbps ?	Ques
1.2.1	100 up and 100 down = 200 total .	St
1.2.2	Go faster ?	Ques
1.2.3	Get 1gbit networking parts .	St

1.4.1	All this will not help your internet gameplay but would help in copying files and such to/from machines in your LAN .	St
1.4.2	For gamers , they want a wired connection to the DSL/Cable modem and even they they 'll complain on just about any laptop made .	St

1.5.1	Going to a gigabit switch which is 10/100/1000 will NOT help your internet gameplay .	St
1.5.2	You connection from your ISP doesnt even come close to maxing out the 10/100 card your using .	St
1.5.3	At the most your ISP is likely putting out 10mbps , and your ethernet card can handle 100mbps .	St
1.5.4	Going to a gigabit switch will only help transfering files from PC to PC , not the internet speeds .	St
1.5.5	Hope this helps .	St
