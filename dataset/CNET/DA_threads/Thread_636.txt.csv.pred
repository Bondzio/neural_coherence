1.1.1	Hi everyone : I 'm from a small town in Argentina and have a problem with a processor.I own a cybercafe and have an Asrock N68-VS3 UCC , 2 GB DDR3 , NVIDIA GeForce 7025 integrated , with an AMD Sempron 140 2.7 Ghz .	St
1.1.2	I need to have installed Counter Strike 1.6 and CS 1.5 , and lots of other games as well , but this two are priority .	St
1.1.3	The games run slowly with lag ( all of them ) , but their are not played on Internet ( we do n't have enough connectivity for that , only LAN ) .On another PC I have the same processor but a different MB and RAM ( ASUS M2N-VM HDMI , 1 GB DDR2 , NVIDIA GeForce 7050 integrated ) , the performance is almost identical ( gets a little better with this last one ) .The rest of the PCs are ASUS M2N-VM HDMI , 1 GB DDR2 , NVIDIA GeForce 7050 , AMD Athlon 64 X2 4200+ , on this other machines I have absolutely no problem.I think the processor is the culprit .	St
1.1.4	I know there 's a hidden core on AMD Sempron 140 to easely unhide with the Asrock N68-VS3 UCC , but do n't want to do that , I MUST be able to play CS 1.5 and CS 1.6 with that configuration ! I thoutht Windows were the problem , but made a clean installation , update NVIDIA drivers , update to june 2010 Directx 9.0c , and the results : identicals.My system : Windows XP Pro Colossus Edition ( SP2 native , later I installed SP3 ) , .NET version 4.I bought the processors as PIB ( Processor In a Box ) , they contained a mini CD , when I try to install it says that it 's only for Windows 7.Any clue about this one folks ?	Ques
1.2.1	It results in an immediate lock .	St
