I cannot find a picture at the ATI site for the ATI Radeon X1600 PRO (512 MB) video card.
In the spec, it says &quot;Dual-link DVI&quot;, but on page http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1830017&Sku=A177-3094&SRCCODE=PRICEGRABBER&CMP=OTC-PRICEGRABBER it certainly does not look as if there are two DVI-I output connectors on the card.
However, on page http://reviews.cnet.com/ATI_Radeon_X1600_Pro_256_MB/4505-8902_7-31530065.html where model 256 MB was reviewed, it clearly shows two DVI-I output connectors (no picture where cnet reviews the 512 MB model; further, it does not seem as if the 256 MB model is sold anymore).
Does anyone know if there are two or only one DVI-I outlet connector on the 5212 MB mocel?
Thanks for reply.
