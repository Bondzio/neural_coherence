<s> Some days ago I turned on my computer after a year. </s>
<s> It was working fine. </s>
<s> But it has not started again after I moved it to a new place. </s>
<s> When I turn on the computer, its fans start to work even a small lamp in the mother board turns on. </s>
<s> And I noticed that the PCI devices have power. </s>
<s> But nothing appears on the screen. </s>
<s> The monitor is healthy and I even tested another graphic card. </s>
<s> Its hard drive don't work (the HDD LED notifier remains off) and it actually does not boot. </s>
<s> The system does nothing, even no POST beep I hear. </s>
<s> I tried removing the RAM and it normally started beeping. </s>
<s> So I think it is not a problem with motherboard. </s>
<s> Any help is appreciated. </s>
<s> Is it a problem with CPU (it's a P4)? </s>
<s> If so how can I troubleshoot it? </s>
<s> I have another P4, but I do not know how I can replace CPUs, I even do not know how to remove CPU fan. </s>

<s> I pulled the ram,cpu, and tested monitor on a laptop. </s>
<s> When I put the pc together turned it on I got static on the monitor instead of a blank screen. </s>
<s> Still unable to use pc. </s>
<s> any help? </s>
<s> Something not plugged in proper. </s>
<s> One of the laments about the PC design is that it takes good parts to swap in to find the bad part. </s>
<s> What spares do you have? </s>
<s> Have you tried just the bare minimum parts? </s>
