my son has a 512mb sandisk flash drive.
device mgr.
sees it in the usb port, but the computer window doesn't see it with the other drives.
he can't save anything 'cause it can't be found!
my system is a compaq with 2.00 intel with 768 ram.
i've tried other usb ports, but it doesn't see it there either!
the green light in the flash drive lights up, so it is getting power!??
he has used it before w/o problems.
thanks!
