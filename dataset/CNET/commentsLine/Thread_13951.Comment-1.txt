i recently did a fresh install of windows xp pro and threw in sp3.
when i go to update drivers for my 8800gtx, my resolution and color drops from 1400x1050 - 32 bit down to 800x600 - 4 bit.
i tried to increase the settings but it drops the setting back down on its own.
i had to do a rollback to the previous drivers to fix the problem.
is it the sp3 thats causing the issue or something else?
the previous drivers that i'm on right now came with the gfx card, which is 2+ years old and cant play any games with outdated drivers.
i'm thinking about just going back to sp2.
thanks in advance.
