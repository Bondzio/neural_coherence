Hey VAPCMD, I did contact PC Power and Cooling as you suggested.
Unfortunatley, they did not have a model for my Gateway PC.
I did contat Gateway who sell a series of Startech PSUs ranging from about 300 to 550 watts.
If I remember right the 550w startech was about 68-69$ (seems kinda of budget/low end to me).
The tech at gateway assures me that these PSUs will work with the PC I got.
But I thought I would try to enlist some help before I buy.
So far I have not found any pages to find a review of startech although I am still looking.
If you need to see the specs, this is the link to the PSUs that gateway sells/reccomends: http://accessories.gateway.com/AccessoryStore/PC+Accessories_316441/PC+Components_316805/Power+Supplies_316811/Default.htm Thanks for any help you can give...James
