The fan that you want to replace is pretty good for the card, but keep in mind that graphic cards these days demand huge amounts of power, thus creating huge amounts of heat.
If you want to keep your video card stable and keep it cool, then I suggest getting a water cooling system for your PC, and a water block cooler for your graphics card.
You can find some good deals at www.tigerdirect.com or www.newegg.com Good Luck!
