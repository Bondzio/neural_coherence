So far there are not enough clues to see if this would work.
How about this.
Head over to www.pcpowerandcooling and get the dimensions and connections for your average ATX supply.
No measure your old supply and see if it physically fits.
Next check if the power connections are all there.
Sorry, but there must be a few hundred HP models out there.
