I is probably sensing a voltage problem and shuts down before any more damage is done. They are cheap so replace and see what happens. A few more specs on your machine might help also . and life goes on... Jack

Vacuum first and then blow with the other end of the vacuum or use compressed air. Pay particular attention to the fan & heat sink on the CPU; the vents in the power supply; and the cooling fans. Look for anything which might have come loose, (like the heat sink which should be on the CPU). Second; with the case open, turn on the power and observe the system. Look and listen for anything which seems amiss. If the problem still occurs and all the fans are operating properly, replacing the power supply is the next step. Good Luck.
