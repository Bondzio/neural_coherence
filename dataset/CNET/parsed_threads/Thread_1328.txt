<s> I tried to install FlashPlayer and got message the installer i was using was corrupted I don't know what to do? </s>
<s> Also on FB it is suggesting to update to IE 8. </s>
<s> The last time I update IE it messed up my HP Printing the Photo Director/Imaging program. </s>
<s> IT Wouldn't scan. </s>
<s> I don't know whether to update to this browser or not. </s>
<s> In my opinion, I would not install the current IE8, I find it is still way too buggy. </s>
<s> You would be better off installing another browser (ie: Firefox, Chrome, or Safari), as they all support the latest flash player (unless you're running with a 64 bit browser, Adobe Flash Player doesn't yet support 64 bit versions of any browser). </s>
