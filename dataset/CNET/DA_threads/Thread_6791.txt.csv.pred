1.1.1	Hi My system is: Main Board:Asus m2npv-mx graphic:onboard Geforce 6150 cpu:Amd Athlon64 3000+ Am2 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Ram:one DDR2(533) 512MB PC2-4300 Crucial , Micron Technology part number:8HTF6464AY-53ED7 serial number: 754523C5 Frequency:266Mh,257.7 CAS#Latency=4.0 RAS# to CAS#=4 RAS#Precharge=4 Tras=12 Trc=16,17 Command Rate=2T &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Info from CPU-Z&quot; Ok now I want to buy one 256MB DDR2 Ram and add it to system But I want to use dual channel mode , could I use 512MB Ram With 256MB Ram in dual channel mode (sounds it could happen) And If yes what kind of 256mb ram could i use in this Situation?	St
1.1.2	for example if I buy 256MB DDR2 kingmax PC2-4300 and add it to my board , then it work on dual channel or not.	St
1.2.1	Check your motherboard manual for what is written about dual channel configurations on that particular board.	St
1.2.2	Although that is not an Intel motherboard, here is what Intel says about it: http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/cs-011965.htm If you have a 256MB module in each of the slots that makes up channel A, you would then need to install a 512MB module in channel B to match the total in Channel A (if adding just one module).	St
1.2.3	Of course, as shown in the above Intel.com link, dual channel mode may be achieved with other configurations.	St
1.2.4	Dual channel module purchase preferences: 1.	St
1.2.5	Purchase matched pairs tested to work together.	St
1.2.6	2.	St
1.2.7	Purchase exact same model numbers.	St
1.2.8	3.	St
1.2.9	Purchase exact same density, frequency, and timings.	St
1.3.1	&quot;could I use 512MB Ram With 256MB Ram in dual channel mode (sounds it could happen) And If yes what kind of 256mb ram could i use in this Situation?	St
1.3.2	&quot; No.	St
1.3.3	Then memory must be in pairs.	St
1.3.4	I will not explain further why this is so.	St
1.3.5	There may be some that wish such a mismatched pair would work but that's all in the computer's design and not subject to our wishes.	St
1.3.6	http://www.google.com/search?q=m2npv confirms you need pairs.	St
1.3.7	Get the second 8HTF6464AY-53ED7 from Crucial and you're done.	St
