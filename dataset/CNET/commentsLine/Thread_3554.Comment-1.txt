hello, i have a linksys wrt150n router.
i've had it for well over a year now and uptill now i did not have any problems.
recently i tried opening a website that i frequently visit but it said &quot;network timed out&quot; i had afeeling that it could be a problem with my router, so i connected the modem directly to my computer without the router and the site loads up perfectly.
this has happened to multiple sites i visit.
does anyone know how to fix this?
thanks in advance.
