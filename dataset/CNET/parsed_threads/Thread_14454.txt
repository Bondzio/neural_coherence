<s> Hi, I'm wondering if there is a solution to get the status of catridge, I mean, before I used XP Pro, I got a view of Cartridge-satus everytime I was printing, I could check if it was still enough , or not, and since I installed vista, I get no feedback, the cartridge are staying grey, without any utility...grgrgrgrg Thks for your help! </s>

<s> for updated software for Vista? </s>
<s> of course I did...like I'm now also having problem with my old scanner HP scanjet 3300,I can instal, but it wont work... hmhmhmh Vista vista.. </s>
<s> Vista is going to be the &quot;Me&quot; of 2007. </s>
<s> yeah, with your comment, you save my print!?!!! </s>
<s> Anyway, if everybody stay conservative with windows 98,won't be any progress in the future!it's the price to pay when you want improvment,and there is always a small (I hope) phase where the chaos is taking place...but in 6 Month,everythings will run smooth, I'm pretty sure! </s>
<s> By the way I found a thread by epson, the drivers will be released,during march fpr the R800,for some other products should be now already on download-site...yeah I have to wait a little bit...but that's life... viva vista! </s>
