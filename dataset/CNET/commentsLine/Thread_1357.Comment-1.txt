i am running an amd 2600+ on epox 3rda+ nforce2 board.
every time during installation finalising stage of windows xp professional the computer will shut down automatically during the finalizing installation stage.
and it won't be able to power on unless i take out the processor and put it back again.
i suspect it is either mb problem or processor problem.
(tried installing server 2003 and same problem occurs) anyone have experienced this problem before can confirm which one is to blame?
thanks!
