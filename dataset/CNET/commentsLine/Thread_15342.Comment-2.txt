the funny irony is, when i first installed wireless using a $50 router, it was awful, but once i replaced the router with a refurbished $20 router sometime later, it worked like magic.
so, if you've already tried changing the broadcast settings (like channels), and if you can tolerate lower speed, try setting everything on wireless mode-b, but if that doesn't work, i would say just get a new wireless router.
