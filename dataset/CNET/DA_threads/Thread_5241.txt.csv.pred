1.1.1	I have a Belkin Wireless N router in my house and would like to put a repeater on my 30 ' tv tower to extend the signal to my shop and barns .	St
1.1.2	I do not want to have to run a CAT5 cable from my router to the repeater .	St
1.1.3	I want the repeater to receive the signal from my router and amplify it and send it back out stronger and in all directions .	St
1.1.4	I have 120V at the tower so I will have power for the repeater- I guess it would take a wall wart ?	Ques
1.1.5	If so I would have to weatherproof it .	St
1.1.6	If I had a 600mW repeater and an omni whip , what kind of range could I expect ?	Ques
1.1.7	The wireless cameras and USB NICs would have the standard rubber duckie on them .	St
1.1.8	Since wireless N requires two antennas , I guess I need a repeater with two omni whips on it ?	Ques
1.1.9	How long would the whips be ?	Ques
1.1.10	Any advice on equipment ?	Ques
1.1.11	Think that 800 ' is possible with a clear line of sight ?	Ques
1.1.12	That would be my longest distance .	St
1.1.13	The rest are from 50 ' to about 200 ' .	St
1.2.1	Range will mostly be related to passing though the walls of the buildings .	St
1.2.2	800 ' might be workable but if not just use directional antenna on both ends or at least on the end at the remote side of the 800 feet .	St
1.2.3	You can get 14db gain panels for about $ 30 .	St
1.2.4	I assume you are looking at the outdoor repeaters ?	Ques
1.2.5	These are nice and waterproof already and get their power PoE so you do n't have to worry about safety issues of running 120V up a tower just a cat5e cable .	St
1.2.6	The power injector is a wall wart and that you would need to place in a dry area but I would hope your power is already dry .	St
1.2.7	There are a ton of options on this .	St
1.2.8	I would look at hawkins and alfa product lines .	St
1.2.9	There are other methods like putting indoor devices in weather proof boxes.. you still want ones that can do PoE.. and mounting those on the top of the tower with antenna .	St
1.2.10	Not sure how much you will save if you live in a area that the sun can cook your device since waterproof generally mean they do n't ventilate well .	St
