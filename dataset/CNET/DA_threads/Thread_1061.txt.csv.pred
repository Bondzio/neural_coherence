1.1.2	I have a D-link 655 wireless N router and a Dell Vostro laptop with a wireless N card.	St

1.1.4	I spent many hours with technical support and still no change.	St
1.1.5	One person suggested that windows cannot show speeds higher than 130mbps Does anyone out there have any insights into this issue?	St
1.1.6	can windows xp connect and show 300mbps?	St

1.2.3	By the same token, the advertised wired speed will never happen either.	St
