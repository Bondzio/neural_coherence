<s> I have a linksys wrt120n connected to my cable modem at one end of the house, I have run a cat5 cable to the other end of the house, where I need to connect multiple devices, so I have a netgear wgr614 router that I will be connecting to that end of the cable, to be fed by the linksys router, question is do I configure the cat5 cable as a straight through or as a crossover cable to enable internet access from the linksys to the netgear? </s>
<s> I know how to config the routers, but need to know whether to use a crossover or straight through? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> What you need is an ethernet switch. </s>
<s> Most routers contain a few ethernet ports so they do have something of a built-in switch. </s>
<s> Modern switches tend to be &quot;auto-sensing&quot; so you can use either type of cable. </s>
<s> The simple thing is just use the straight through that you mentioned rather than a crossover cable. </s>
<s> You need a switch, not a router. </s>
<s> Yeah I know a switch would have been the better to use, but we are talking about devices I already have as opposed to devices I don't have. </s>
<s> Anyway it is up and running perfectly and all of my devices are sharing internet connectivity now.. </s>
<s> Thanks for your quick responses. </s>
<s> DHCP in the router you are using as a switch. </s>
<s> Odd things can happen if you don't. </s>
