you dug up an old post and don't have any network issue to discuss?
if so, please tell the forum that so folk know what your discussion is about.
about me hyperlinking.
unlike some forums some moderators tend to teach how to find things.
that can upset those that want tech support.
this is all volunteer so the sooner you learn to use the forum and do the basic searches the less you need support.
