Periodically, both &quot;Enter&quot; keys on my stock Dell keyboard stop working (both the standard enter key & the enter key on the numeric kepad on the right).
I have swapped in a known good keyboard, but the enter key continues not to work.
The system is a stock Dell desktop (1.8 GHz Centrino, Windows XP) with Dell keyboard, Dell monitor (motherboard graphics), Dell mouse, Dell 802.11b USB wireless ethernet adapter.
Sometimes, a reboot fixes the problem... and then it reappears.
In an attempt to fix this problem, I have uninstalled the keyboard driver & allowed the system to reboot so that Windows &quot;finds the new hardware&quot; and then installs a new driver, and reboots... this solves the problem for a while, but then it returns.
I'm at my wits end!
Any ideas on what I might do to fix this issue?
Thanks
