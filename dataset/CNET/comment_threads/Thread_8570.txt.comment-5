I dont get what manual are you talking about.
I know that if i buy a router then i can easily connect multiple pcs and so on, but i dont want to use a router.
What i am trying to do is, I want to connect my laptop by using the motherboards wifi signal and i have already set it up perfectly and my laptop is also able to pickup the wifi signal, but soon after it is telling me to troubleshoot network.
So do you have a solution for this.
Thank you in advance.
