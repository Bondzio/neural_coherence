<s> What all things are needed to be considered before buying a Nvidia Geforce 7 series Graphics Card for the complete compatibility of it with the PC. </s>
<s> My PC came with pre-installed Nvidia Geforce 6200 128 MB TurboCache. </s>
<s> And i'm planning to upgrade to Nvidia Geforce 7 series. </s>
<s> My PC Config : Pc:- Lenovo 3000 series Q100 8822 11Q Intel Pentium 4 3.06 Ghz HT Intel 945G Chipset 2 GB DDR2-533 RAM 80 Gb Hard Disk Nvidia Geforce 6200 128 MB TurboCache (Currently installed Graphic Card) installed in PCI Express x16 Windows XP Home </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The PCIe x16 slot (which you have) 2. </s>
<s> A suitably sized power supply. </s>
<s> Which you didn't state. </s>
<s> That's about it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> How do i get to know about the details of the power supply. </s>
<s> Since the Motherboard manufacturer and model is showing as :&quot;To be filled by OEM&quot;. </s>
<s> Can u tell me any way to find the size or voltage of the power supply in my PC. </s>
<s> But at the back of my CPU ,a sticker states &quot;DC +12V/4A&quot; Is that the size of the power supply ? </s>
<s> So that's not it. </s>
<s> There should be other numbers on the power supply. </s>
<s> Make/model usually helps. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You need to open the case and check the decal/sticker mounted on the power supply(psu) inside. </s>
<s> Hopefully, its visible and states what it is and specs. </s>
<s> If not, its on the other side, do what you have to to inspect. </s>
<s> If this is an OEM(Dell, Gateway, etc) then look-up that model# on the respective support website and check for specs there, but even so, the decal should be present. </s>
<s> Most graphic card makers supply what the basic requirements are for its usage, again visit the support website for the model# in question. </s>
<s> Don't assume anything, check. </s>
<s> For the most part, a decent 350W is required but system demands should be well served by at least a 400W psu of a brandname or better. </s>
