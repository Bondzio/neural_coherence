My folder says I have : Broadband WAN miniport, PPPoE, disconnected, Broadband (dialup) connected, 1394 1 adapter, and 1394 2 adapter, local area connection 3 (nVidia nForce Networking Controller) local area connection 4 (3com 3C920B-EMB Intergrated Fast Ethernet Controller, 1 gigabyte LAN). Which of these A) is most practical for Wi-fi connection to a Notebook, and B) would best serve as a physical connection to another desktop? Probably naive question, but I've been slow to get into this side of computing. Thanks in advance, phantazy.

I'm assuming you have at least dsl, or else its not worth sharing internet. As for the range of the notebook &quot;in the garden&quot;, i don't know it depends on the router. This should be in the networking and wireless forum. Roger
