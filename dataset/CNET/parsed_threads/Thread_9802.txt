<s> I have a Win2000 and Win98 Pc connected via Netgear router. </s>
<s> I also connect to Work network (from WIN2000 PC) via VPN. </s>
<s> It seems that I can only access the WIN98 PC (from WIN2000 PC) once I have made the VPN connection to Work. </s>
<s> Otherwise , no go. </s>
<s> And even after disconnecting from VPN , I can still access the WIN98. </s>
<s> TIA for any suggestions allowing me to skip the VPN step. </s>
<s> The problem I see here is that your setup may not 'normal.' </s>
<s> Your IT staff at work has it set just so and as such, I will not be privy to their setup variations. </s>
<s> What I may suggest may break the VPN so my best advice is to talk to your work's IT staff about this. </s>

<s> Thanks for your reply Bob. </s>
<s> While your suggestion makes sense, our IT department's policy is not to get involved where it doesn't involve a connection to the company. </s>
<s> Currently, I can successfully connect through VPN so there ends the extent of their responsibility. </s>
<s> My problem is making my home network work without VPN involvement. </s>
<s> If you do have any suggestions re. </s>
<s> settings, I would treat them with care, carefully noting any previous settings that I may have had to change. </s>
<s> allowing me to be able to reinstate settings if neccessary . </s>
<s> thx. </s>

<s> Trying to ping by address each which way, then use... Command line tools to figure out what's up. </s>
<s> Here's the commands I use when faced with such anomalies. </s>
<s> PING (put addresses in) TRACERT (to other address) IPCONFIG /ALL Collect all that in the working and non-working modes and ponder what it reveals. </s>
<s> There is no click-here solution I know of and learning TCP/IP may be required. </s>
<s> Web sites such as http://www.practicallynetworked.com http://www.wown.com may be useful. </s>
