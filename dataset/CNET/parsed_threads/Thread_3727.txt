<s> I'm buying a new laptop for general school use and maybe some casual gaming like tekkit and stuff. </s>
<s> im comparing mainly dell and hp, and i had some questions about their specs 1.Dell with an i5 processor and AMD Radeon 7730m, with 6 GB RAM or HP with i7 and intel HD 4000, with 8 GB RAM 2.How good is Intel HD 4000, NVIDIA Geforce GT 630m, and AMD Radeon 7730m compared to each other? </s>
<s> 3.How much RAM is good for high end gaming, just so I can get a perspective? </s>
<s> 4.What is your recommended hard drive space for a laptop? </s>
<s> 4 </s>
<s> A Yugo. </s>
<s> Sorry, but that question has been tossed out too many times. </s>
<s> As to item 2, google like this. </s>
<s> NOTEBOOKCHECK GT 630M and you find that chips benchmark. </s>
<s> Alter it to the 7730m and compare. </s>
<s> Just a little work for you. </s>
<s> About RAM. </s>
<s> 4 to 16GB is fine for most things. </s>
<s> Disk space is rather an odd question. </s>
<s> My work machine has 120GB, the travel laptop is only 500GB and is half or more empty so it appears that space is what you make of it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I don't recommend HP PCs as they tend to fall down too often, no matter if buikld right, they just do. </s>
<s> Next, you want gaming, laptops aren't gaming platforms. </s>
<s> If you do want that more than you think then look for one that actually says, its a gaming platform or system. </s>
<s> Anything just won't do or can't be build-up later because it's a laptop. </s>
<s> So, decide what the primary usage of the laptop is and go from there. </s>
<s> Gaming is a killer of any PC, unless care if given in build or intense usage, no shortcuts. </s>
<s> If cost becomes too much of an factor then spend more to get more in the end. </s>
<s> It's just better that way. </s>
<s> tada ------Willy </s>
<s> I'm just looking for an opinion for #1 on what compromises I should make for processor, video card, and RAM. </s>
<s> As for #2 I've checked the benchmarks but I'd like to know from some who has used them </s>
<s> While I get to use many laptops, none exactly match what you noted. </s>
<s> Close, but no match. </s>
<s> The benchmarks are also close to my experiences so if you want to wait for someone that owns exactly those models, that's fine but you may be waiting a very long time. </s>
<s> I can only guess you are new at this since you listed that Intel solution. </s>
<s> Why is that here if you want to game? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I can do some basic coding like java and know a decent amount about the system, but i have no idea how the actual hardware corresponds with each other. </s>
<s> So far the specs on the laptop I'm looking at is 3rd generation intel i7-3610QM (2.3 ghz 6mb L3 cache), windows 7 home premium, 8 gb DDR3 (2 DIMM), and NVIDIA geforce gt 650m with 1gb GDDR5 memory. </s>
<s> Any opinions? </s>
<s> Last year I picked up a Samsung rc512 with the i7 and a nice enough GPU. </s>
<s> Your choice is very nice. </s>
