USB HD tuners on the market and more mfrs are coming out with HD versions of their PCI and USB2 tuners.
Just google USB HD.
Be aware that HD is a performance hog.
Make sure you can return it if not satisfied.
Wonder if you had great success with your SD tuner.
The delay in channel switching always bothered me.
Also look into Slingbox Pro.
Many, many reviewers are very happy with it.
