we had this problem at the office.
after changing fax machine make, model and running new wires, calling the telco we finally kept a log of the phone numbers of who claimed they couldn't fax us.
the list showed only 2 numbers.
we then tried to fax them and couldn't.
we went to the copy shoppe and tried to fax them and failed there.
you can guess that after spending a thousand bucks we were very p.d when one of them told us that they have had problems faxing other companies.
they couldn't believe the issue was on their end.
