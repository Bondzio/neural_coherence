you really didn't give the lady much help.
mostly critical statements.
actually, her installing nero and roxio will never work.
nero works most of the time but has it's moments.
roxio works a little better but also has it's moments.
but, with both installed, neither likes to work much.
i think her best solution would be to uninstall each drives drivers and then reinstall them (after she uninstalls both nero and roxio).
which by the way, neither unstalls completely which will also cause a problem.
this takes register editing which is another story but not really hard.
