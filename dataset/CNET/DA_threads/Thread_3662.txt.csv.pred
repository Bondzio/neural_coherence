1.1.1	Hey ive had my Logitech mx518 for a bit and its never shown problems until now.	St
1.1.2	The problem ive been having is that it will randomly disconnect while im browsing and gaming and such.	St
1.1.3	I am pretty sure its disconnecting because my computer does the disconnect/reconnect &quot;ring&quot; when it freezes.	St
1.1.4	Incase this is important, right before it started happening i uninstalled the Logitech Setpoint program from my computer, but even after reinstalling this i still get the problem, Ive also tried using different usb ports to no luck.	St
1.1.5	If anyone has any idea what the fix is, how to test for it, or possibly even just finding out specifically what the problem is, i would appreciate it.	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks PS: Here are some of my comp specs Computer Brand: HP CPU Speed/Type: AMD Athlon 64 x2 2.6 ghz RAM: 2 GB DDR2 Video Card: Radeon ATI X1950 Pro Sound Card: OnBoard Mouse: Logitech MX518	St
1.2.1	I think the mouse is probably defective.	St
1.2.2	I had an issue like that with my MX1000 as well.	St
1.2.3	However you are in luck!	St
1.2.4	Logitech has a wonderful warranty service.	St
1.2.5	Just give them a call at +1 702-269-3457 and they will be glad to replace it for you.	St
1.2.6	They will probably even upgrade your mouse to the latest corded gaming mouse, whatever that may be at this time.	St
