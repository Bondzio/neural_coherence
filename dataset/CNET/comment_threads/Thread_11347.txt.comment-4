I'll skip the discussion about port 80 blocks by ISPs.
You could try 8080 or other ports for the web server in that product.
As to port 20, it's part of FTP so need I write more?
Also worth noting is some ISPs block FTP.
I don't need to write why but this and other common server ports are too often blocked.
This area is slamming a few out there.
