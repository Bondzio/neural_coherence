Printed on the Board itself is QT-4SDM2+ on one of the PCI slots there is a barcode and printed on it is 4SDM2+ -021113000363 the Bios is Phoenix D686 073659761 Dated 1998 this information is from a sticker on the same PCI slot as the barcode. There is also a smaller barcode stuck to the motherboard with a No.2B003700181. On top of the LAN socket is another sticker P29-112-11A9 The Chips on the motherboard are SIS961, Winbond W83697HF, RTL8100B. I have tried to search for QT-4SDM2+ on the internet which I assumed was the Motherboard model and I find nothing. I then search for 4SDM2+ and it comes up with an Epox board. EP-4SDM2+ I have downloaded the manual and the board looks like the one I have but it talks about Pentium 4 processors and I think that this board might be older than that. All slots and connections seem identical to the EP-4SDM2+ even the connections coming out the back of the MB are the same and in the same order. Can you tell me if I have the correct motherboard manual can my MB take a Pentium 4 processor or is there a motherboard that links to the QT that is printed on my MB. Many Thanks for any help you can give me.

Well, I did a search on google and this is what I came up with: ls=GGGL,GGGL:2005-09,GGGL:en&q=mpga478b+motherboard" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&ie=UTF-8&r ls=GGGL,GGGL:2005-09,GGGL:en&q=mpga478b+motherboard It looks like a Socket 478. It will handle a P4. Also, it looks to be from a PC manufactured by Dell or some other PC maker. Hope this helps. and life goes on... Jack
