i would like to build a dual processor computer but i don't know what motherboards can support this and what processors work best.
i like to multi task and my computer now is just slow when i'm doing anything that's processor intensive such as encoding a dvd.
i read about multi-core processors and if they work the same as dual processor then i suppose i could use that.
thanks
