i have a tiny piii 55o mhz,256 sdram (100 mhz)running win98se.i need to replace the motherboard and would like to upgrade to a socket 478 with a 2.4 p4 cpu.i have already replaced the cd,cd/rw on this system and would like to use as much of it as possible.i have been looking at several motherboards.
some support my sdram and some support ddr.my question is , in order to use my existing ram, do i have to buy a motherboard that supports only sdram/100mhz or can i get one that supports sdram and ddr both including sdram/133?
i am not sure exactly what specs i should look for in order to use as much of my old system as possible.
