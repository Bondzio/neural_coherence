sadly, if cleaning doesn't clear that up (you have to try some dozen times, then you have to decide if its worth it for a new printhead.
the &quot;chip&quot; on the inkcarts was visible on all the epson models i've seen.
it's a little green/blue circuit board.
refilling might be possible, but i never have.
