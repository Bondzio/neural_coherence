I have a new Samsung T409 cell phone and for three weeks I have tried everything to try and get it to connect to my MI424WR Actiontec Router from Verizon FIOS.
I keep getting messages like: Can't connect error W002, W003, W004, etc.
I upgraded the router firmware today, still no luck.
Can anyone out there help?
Any ideas of what to try next?
