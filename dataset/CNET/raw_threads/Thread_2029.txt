XP Home Edition.IE-8.Dell XPS Gen 2 Desktop.Bios AO3 .ATI Radeon 9800 Pro Graphics Card.2001F Digital Flat 20&quot; Monitor. *Problem-After all the computer passwords signed in I receive Pixel spots all over screen and when I open a web page the TEXT is just about unreadable-very faint and looks distorted.Screen set as 1600x1200 @ 32 Bit Colour @ 60 HZ and have tried several other settings.Refrehing continously helps for a while BUT when my mouse clicks and mostly when I scroll down a page orclick on a line in any document or web page-even in Services.I hope someone has a solution.

So far the other test I use if they won't swap the card is to try Linux. A Linux LiveCD lets us use the machine without installing Linux.
