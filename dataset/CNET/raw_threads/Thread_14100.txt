7234	0	316209	2906423	NR	Sgreen	11/13/08 2:17 PM	1.22658582E12	Solution Center Dialog Box	I have an HP D2430 printer that I use with my Compaq V6444US notebook when I'm away from home. Yesterday, a Dialog Box appeared with &quot;Solution Center The feature you are trying to use is on a CD-ROM or other removeable disk that is not available. Insert the &quot;Solution Center&quot; disk and click OK.&quot; Since I was not trying to &quot;use anything&quot;, I don't know why this Dialog Box appeared. This printer is just that ... a printer only which works great. How do I keep this message from reappearing? Thank you.

Thank you.
