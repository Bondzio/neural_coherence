I don't have the sound card for a 5.1 system, plus, I would also like to be able to connect these speakers to my iPod.I'd like a sub. All under $100 Here are some of my original choices: -JBL Creature II -Logitech Z-2300 (only $60 on Amazon ) -Logitech X-230 I would get the X-530, but it's a 5.1 system -Logitech Z-3e I looked on Klipsch, Bose, Creative and there were many speakers to choose from. I was somewhat overwhelmed. So, I know that there are more brands than the ones I listed and I'm willing to consider. Please help. Thanks!

I have 2 Platinum JBL Series, Compaq speakers. I also have the older version to replace the crappy emachines speakers. That's all i use, as i use a headset most of the time. Roger
