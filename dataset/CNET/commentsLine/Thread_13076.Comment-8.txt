as i posted earlier, the problem was fixed by downloading and running adaware from download.com.
thanks for the suggestions and trying to help, but problem is fixed.
i had some sort of virus or trackin bug and adaware cleared it up.
if you ever have any problems like mine or just want to see what kind of junk you have picked up, i strongly recommend running it.
anyway, thanks again and again i truly appreciate the help and suggestions.
have a great one.
later.
