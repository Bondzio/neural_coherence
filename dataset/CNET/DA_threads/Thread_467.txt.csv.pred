1.1.1	I got a SimpleTech SimpleDrive Hi-Speed USB 2.0 Portable 80GB Hard Drive ( product number SP-U25/80 designed by pininfarina ) for Christmas .	St
1.1.2	I know the thing works , as I hooked it up to my dad 's computer to grab some of my files off of it .	St
1.1.3	Once I got it home though , I tried hooking it up to my computer and it wo n't recognize it .	St
1.1.4	All I can do it unplug it in the USB menu , I ca n't access it from My Computer .	St
1.1.5	It came with a little disc for a StorageSync program and everytime I try to install it I get the following error before it finishes installing- Access violation address 0040267 in module 'SETUP.EXE ' .	St
1.1.6	Read of address FFFFFFF .	St
1.1.7	I have no idea what that means or why I ca n't get the thing to work .	St
1.1.8	It may have something to do with that fact that my computer is WAY old and runs Windows ME ( though the hard drive claims to be able to work with that system ) .	St
1.1.9	Any advice ?	Ques
1.1.10	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	Any idea how the external drive is formatted ..FAT32 or NTFS ?	Ques
1.2.2	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Look up SYNCBACK on google.com I think it supports Windows ME .	St
1.3.2	Sorry if it does n't .	St
1.3.3	But the price is right .	St
1.3.4	Bob	St
1.4.1	It claims that it does work with WinMe ... Also , it 's formatted as NTFS .	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	recognize an NTFS formatted HDD ... ergo the reason I asked the question about formatting .	St
1.6.2	Solution 1 : format the external FAT32 ... it should work on both PCs and OSs ' .	St
1.6.3	Solution 2 : upgrade the Me to XP before you encounter more SW issues .	St
1.6.4	VAPCMD	St
1.7.1	How would I go about doing that ?	Ques
1.7.2	I do n't think I 've ever had to reformate something before ... And I would LOVE to upgrade to XP , but I think my computer is too old to handle it .	St
1.7.3	It 's sort of a hand-me-down computer and the only reason I got it is because my dad got a new computer that could run a newer version of windows .	St
1.7.4	I think I 'm stuck .	St
1.7.5	Thanks so much for all the help , by the way .	St
1.7.6	-ender	St
1.8.1	it as FAT32 on your PC ... you could probably do it on your Dad 's PC .	St
1.8.2	And then it should work on either PC .	St
1.8.3	Have you checked MS to see if your PC is XP compatible ?	Ques
1.8.4	VAPCMD	St
1.9.1	I was going to have to do .	St
1.9.2	Thanks for the advice !	St
1.9.3	Um , no ...	St
1.9.4	I have n't .	St
1.9.5	I 'll have to do that , haha .	St
1.9.6	I have a feeling it 's not though .	St

1.11.1	I think that upgrading to XP is a good idea .	Polite
1.11.2	I do n't know if this helps at all , but rather than run a compatibility check which I agree is also a good idea at times , I have reservations as to Microsofts ability to diagnose computers remotely .	St
1.11.3	Here are the specs that I suggest for a computer .	St
1.11.4	800 mhz CPU 256mb Ram 40 GB Hard Drive .	St
1.11.5	These are my recommended specs for someone who would like it to run and operate in a fashion which is not trying to your senses and it leaves space on the drive for a couple other things .	St
1.11.6	Here are the lowest specs that I know XP to run on and operate halfway decent , but mind you these specs leave minimal room on a hard drive , but it will function .	St
1.11.7	400 mhz 64mb RAM 4.7gb HD This particular model I bought in early 2000 .	St
1.11.8	This should give you a rough estimate as to how old a computer can be .	St
1.11.9	As for hand me downs , you can get a reasonable compuer nowadays for under 200 dollars .	St
1.11.10	I do not promote companies on other websites so I ca n't tell you where , but if you ever do want to know you can conact me at michaelfeather @ aol.com .	St
1.11.11	My computer now is a Emachine 1.2 Ghz CPU 512mb Ram , 150 GB HD and a bunch of other goodies that I have installed from here and there and so far I have about 160 bucks in it .	St
1.11.12	That 's with the lightscribe DVD burner and the DVD/CDRW drive , so it is very possible to get or piece together a very good system for minimal money .	St
1.11.13	Hope the specs help	St
1.12.1	I recently bought the 100G Simpletech Pininfarina and formatted it to FAT 32 so I could use it with both my mac and PC .	St
1.12.2	This was working fine for a bit however now I ca n't get the drive to show up on either my PC at work or at home .	St
1.12.3	I checked it with my Mac last night and it worked fine .	St
1.12.4	Both PCs are running XP .	St
1.12.5	Can anyone advise me what steps I need to take to get my drive to read on the PCs ?	Ques
1.12.6	Thank in advance , lapeachies	St
1.13.1	Save your files that you ca n't lose .	St
1.13.2	I 'm seeing FAT32 volumes on USB fail on Windows but work on other OSes ( Mac , Linux ) .	St
1.13.3	To fix this we back off the files and delete , create the partition and give it a fresh format .	St
1.13.4	Sadly FAT32 is not damage resistant and eventually goes wonky again .	St
1.13.5	- & gt ; Let me be blunt .	St
1.13.6	Do not use FAT32 volumes on USB for storage .	St
1.13.7	Only use such to transfer files .	St
1.13.8	Bob	St
1.14.1	Thanks for the tip .	St
1.14.2	I thought I was going crazy for a moment .	St
