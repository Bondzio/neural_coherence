<s> Windows 98SE recognizes my Kensington serial trackball as a generic serial mouse, and it works OK when I first plug it in. </s>
<s> The problem occurs later, when I reboot, and no mouse is recognized at all. </s>
<s> There does not appear to be anything wrong with the connector. </s>
<s> Should I get an adaptor and try it on the PS/2 port. </s>
<s> Is it any better than the serial port, or is there no difference at all? </s>
<s> Although I have another USB mouse that works fine,I like the Kensington because the size of the trackball makes it easy to move around. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Go to Start&gt;Settings&gt;Control Panel. </s>
<s> Double-click System and go to the Device Manager tab. </s>
<s> If there is an yellow exclamation point next to the mouse, then you may have to install the mouse drivers. </s>
<s> Did you ever get your trackball working properly? </s>
<s> I have one (use Win XP) that has become problematic; working 50% of the time and vice-versa. </s>
<s> I have no idea what is wrong with it. </s>
<s> I love the big OLD thing and have no idea what I should replace it with. </s>
<s> Are there any other die hard trackball users out there with advice about current models? </s>
