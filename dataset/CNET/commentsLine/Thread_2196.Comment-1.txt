hoping someone can help.
i've got a kv8-max3, it had been hanging intermittently and finally wouldn't boot the other day.
i popped open the case and found that the northbridge fan had burnt out.
i replaced the fan and am still having the same issue.
the computer comes on, displays the abit splash screen and just sits there.
the board displays code 52 which i believe is a memory check.
after close to five minutes it proceeds to a 7f and displays a screen that says cmos checksum error, defaults loaded.
asks you to push f1 or delete.
the system doesn't repsond to any key presses.
i have tried clearing the cmos, replacing the battery and pulling memory modules.
i'm out of ideas here!
thanks in advance!
