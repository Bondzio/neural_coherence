1.1.1	Just the other day I had to restart my computer after a crash while watching a movie .	St
1.1.2	I had to use the power button , since ctrl-alt-del did n't work .	St
1.1.3	When the computer booted up again , strange noises came from the harddrive , almost sounded like some sort of sci-fi raygun .	St
1.1.4	I 've never encountered that one before , so I was wondering if anyone had any advise for me on what to do ?	Ques
1.1.5	Send it for repairs , hum along with the noise , or ignore it ?	Ques
1.1.6	Or something ?	Ques
1.1.7	-Icaros-	St
1.2.1	As long as there are no files you ca n't lose , then I 'd ignore it , then replace the drive when it fails .	St

1.3.1	The real question is , where is the problem .	St
1.3.2	I constantly hear people referring to their computer as their & quot ; hard drive & quot ; when the hard drive is just one small thing inside a computer .	St
1.3.3	Is the problem actually coming from the hard drive , did you open up the case and see if the noise still happens if you unplug the power from the hard drive .	St
1.3.4	Usually you hear a noise from a Fan in a system , not the drive , when a hard drive starts making a lot of noise it is almost always already toast , due to a head crash , and damage to the platters .	St
1.3.5	When is the last time you backed up your system 's data ?	Ques
1.4.1	Any noice noticable coming from the HD is n't good but there 's the outside chance it was trying to access a pgm/file that maybe corrupted or fragmented and doing alot more work to do so .	St
1.4.2	Regardless , do a backup ASAP just to be safe .	St
1.4.3	Goto the HD makers support website and get thier diags as that is the required process in order to proceed with any & quot ; warranty & quot ; returns provided you 're still covered .	St
1.4.4	Even so , the diags themselves will readily check the HD .	St
1.4.5	if a problems exists , use warranty or open wallet .	St
1.4.6	If the problem seems to be a pgm/file ( s ) , reload them but a good HD defrag seems to be in order anyways , just get that backup done as well .	St
