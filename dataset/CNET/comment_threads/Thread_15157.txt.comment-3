865 and 875 Intel series?
I recall something about the 875 including what is called PAT technology which is supposed to provide a small performance gain.
Some MB manufacturers such as ASUS, are said to have unlocked it in some of their 865s.
I believe Intel calls the 875 their &quot;Canterwood&quot; and the 865 the &quot;Springdale&quot;.
I've read there is little performance difference, however.
Some say the 865s are a better value.
Most will now support the Intel Prescott CPUs.
