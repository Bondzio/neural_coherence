<s> 2) If yes, how do we delete the SKYPE, SignupShield and Avast? </s>
<s> 3) If we want to use SyncToy, can we just get rid of the RelaySync? </s>
<s> Or should we keep and use the RelaySync? </s>
<s> 4) If we delete all of the above software, do we need to do anything like reformat the flashdrive? </s>
<s> 5) If yes, how does one format a flashdrive? </s>
<s> (Actually, even if the answer to #4 is no, I'd like to know how one formats a flashdrive. </s>
<s> 6) If the package says that the flashdrive is compatible with Win98SE, ME, 200, XP and says that is it not compatible with any other Windows platform, does that mean what I thikit means? </s>
<s> That this flashdrive would not be compatible with our other laptop which has Windows Vista? </s>

<s> I bought a two Gig Sandisk and it came with all that junk on it. </s>
<s> A visit to the Sandisk site found the directions to remove the crap and format it. </s>
<s> Now it's just like a two Gig external drive. </s>
<s> When you plug it in it'll show up like any other drive. </s>
<s> Just right click and choose format. </s>
<s> Vista compatable? </s>
<s> Don't know. </s>
<s> Vista is still broken. </s>
