<s> Hi, I am not able to come into one conclusion about the terms Provisioning and configuration&quot; in networking/telecom. </s>
<s> Can you please anyone can help me to understand about the differences with some clear explanation. </s>
<s> My understanding: Configuration means: Setting systems or devices with some parameters Provisioning means: Giving/Getting the configuration information Please make me clear. </s>
<s> Regards, VenkatG </s>
<s> The reason you are having issues is it depends on the size of the project and the size of company. </s>
<s> When you have a single person doing both functions it is very blurry which function falls under which title. </s>
<s> When you have large complex project different people do different parts of the work so it is a little more clearly defined. </s>
<s> When you deal with a huge company say ATT you get whole organizations with those titles so they break this up even more. </s>
<s> So your definitions are correct for larger projects/companies. </s>
