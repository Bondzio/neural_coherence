thanks for taking the time to find/type that link for me, bob.
i entered the settings from that url, and found that i am using the newest firmware and using wpa.
i changed it to wpa2 because it said something about stronger connection with it.
so.. i guess everything looks good now.
i hope so anyways.
thanks again for your help.
