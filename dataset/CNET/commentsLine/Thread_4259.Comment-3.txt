don't be afraid, there is not gost in your pc.. i agree that hd never speaks but some motherboard does (like asus p4..).
they have a system that speak (instead of beeping) when something is wrong.. this systen could be enabled and disabled trught the bios configuration and it is very useful to diagnostic problems.
you must check your motherboard manual.
the important isue here is: what the voice told you?
it is the error report... according to that error you can identify the failure component, hdd, video card, etc...
