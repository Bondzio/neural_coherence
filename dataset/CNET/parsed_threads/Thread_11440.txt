<s> My experience is not Wholely with The Manufacturer but also with the Retailer. </s>
<s> After purchasing a Packard Bell I Extreme 6091 from a Big....... retailer I was assured of all the usual things, but when my Computer arrived from the Big....... retailer there was no operators manual and also when I log onto the Packard Bell Website to upgrade any drivers the Website tells me that the Serial number it finds is not recognisable and will not upgrade my Drivers. </s>
<s> I contacted Packard Bell and the Big....... retailer and the one passed the Buck to the other and neither would help me out. </s>
<s> So I will just have to treat this as a Lesson Learned and NEVER WILL I BUY ANOTHER PACKARD BELL AND MORESO NEVER WILL I deal with the Big....... retailer I hope a lot of you people out there recognise which Big....... retailer I am talking about. </s>

<s> I would be grateful for an operators Manual and I would pay or could someone lend me their serial number so I can update my Drivers </s>

<s> Return the PC. </s>
<s> If you paid with a credit card protest the charge in writing and the credit card will withdraw the payment to the big company. </s>
<s> FYI it's ok to use initials like BB,CC etc. </s>

<s> I don't know where you're at, but if within the billing period of a creditr card and you feel slighted, you can use the recourse and return the system. </s>
<s> After all, they give no support and how can you use it for the long term if you can't get vendor/OEM updates. </s>
<s> Do this NOW! </s>
<s> If you had this for a while, then google for PB support websites that are more friendly in providing some details on support and thier own files/pgms. </s>
<s> etc.. Further, make sure that some info isn't provided on a resource CD of some kind, but you have to print it out. </s>
<s> Check that. </s>
<s> enjoy -----Willy </s>
