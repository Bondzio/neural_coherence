1.1.1	Hi , I have Roadrunner and voip with Nuvio , and a router with three network locations , when I add a Linksys wrt160n wireless router it does 130mbs but when I use the phone it drops to 54mbs .	St
1.1.2	Is this normal ?	Ques
1.1.3	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	I assume you are using a wireless voip phone ?	Ques
1.2.2	It is not so much the voip as how wireless works when running a mix of devices .	St
1.2.3	I suspect your phone is 802.11g 130m is using a wide band 802.11N and 54 is using 802.11G .	St
1.2.4	First a router will always slow down to talk to a slower device .	St
1.2.5	It will attempt to switch back and forth but many times it will just run slower for all devices .	St
1.2.6	If you use a old 802.11b device you many times in effect force all your newer devices to run slower .	St
1.2.7	The other thing that 802.11n with wide channels does it will go to narrow channels ie 65/72m if it detect another device trying to use a adjacent channel .	St
1.2.8	So if it detects your neighbor it will change .	St
1.2.9	Many people disable this feature .	St
1.2.10	In your case I suspect since you say it is 54m which is 802.11g you have a device active at that speed .	St
1.3.1	Hey thanks , I guess that makes some sense , I have an old 2.4GHz Uniden portable that I use , and I have my house hard-wired with cat6 cable and just stuck the wireless router at a wall terminal .	St
1.3.2	I guess that I need to incorporate it into my system but I think I 'm getting rid of Roadrunner soon , so just did n't want to hassle with it .	St
1.3.3	It works fine if I just stay off of the phone ... ... ..	St
