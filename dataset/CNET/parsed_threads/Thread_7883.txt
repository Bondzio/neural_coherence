<s> Hi there, I have 4 brand new hard drives that that i would like to thoroughly check before putting them into use. </s>
<s> What are some things i can do or use, besides checkdisk, to stress test a new hard drive, seek out bad sectors, and to sniff out future problems? </s>
<s> NIL </s>

<s> I don't need that kind of reliability so have never done burn-in on my harddrive. </s>
<s> Do a full format on the drive(s). </s>
<s> Not a 'fast' format. </s>
<s> If they survive without any errors your good to go. </s>
<s> Electronics usually fail within the first hour of useage. </s>
<s> Keep the drive(s) cool and you won't have any problems. </s>
<s> WD blacks are the best with samsung running a close second. </s>
