i'm not sure what other info i can give you.
the power, connection, and wirless lights are all on the router.
it works fine for connecting and getting on the internet with my ipod touch so i know the router is working and sending out a signal.
but for some reason when i go to view the wireless network connections on my laptop the router does not show up.
is their anyway to turn on the wireless on my laptop
