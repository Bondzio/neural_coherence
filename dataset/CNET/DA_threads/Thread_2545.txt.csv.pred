1.1.1	My computer turns on but the monitor will NOT turn on.	St
1.1.2	The keyboard flashes randomly and the harddrive does NOT turn on.	St
1.1.3	But if i unplug it from the MB it will turn on with just power from the power supply.	St
1.1.4	The green light is lite on the mother board and the fans are working.	St
1.1.5	I Im thinking its the motherboard or its a virus.	St
1.1.6	I tried taking out the video card and puting it directly to the MB, still didnt work.	St
1.1.7	My computer is a 1.8 p4 cpu with a intel desktop board, 512 ddr, and 256 gforge video card, and 160 gig harddrive	St
1.2.1	cause the problems you describe.	St
1.3.1	Well I was playing a game when the computer shut off earlier that day.	St
1.3.2	when it shut off the power would turn on and off really quick so i decided to unplug it.	St
1.3.3	The fan from the power supply was making a real loud noise for the past few days proior to it crashing.	St
1.3.4	So I thought it was the power supply, so I ship a new tower with a 450 wat power supply, and had it tested before it got shiped.	St
1.3.5	I put the computer together correctly (checked at least 20 times to make sure).	St
1.3.6	The computer turned on but the monitor didnt and keyboard flashes, like before.	St
1.4.1	Here's the rub, if your PSU failed or is weak and starting to fail, it may take other componets with it.	St
1.4.2	-OR- in the same vein degrade so much that when the PSU is replaced, its too late, the other componets are weak and probably fall down.	St
1.4.3	In your case, the unplugging of the AC cord, allows the start ckt.	St
1.4.4	to de-energize and makes relays truly turn OFF, thus then power is applied and power-ON started it energizes and system starts a boot-up, however, those same relays are weak, and won't work properly when restarted unless repeated attempts or NOT.	St
1.4.5	The logic ckt.	St
1.4.6	that applies here has failed.	St
1.4.7	You replaced the primary fault(PSU) but secondary problems arise and in some may cause the new PSU to fail as well, its a domino effect at times.	St
1.4.8	sorry... tada -----Willy	St
