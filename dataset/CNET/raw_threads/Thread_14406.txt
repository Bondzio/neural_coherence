My desktop computer (PC - windows xp) is not wireless. I just bought a laptop (Mac - OSX/leopard), so I bought the netgear WPN824 v3 router so that I could make it wireless. and it is! I installed it correctly, it works and gets ok speed on the wireless laptop. One big issue though: Whenever I try to send someone a file over trillian or skype, it works OK. However, when someone tries to send me files, it never sends. Skype sends but it says that it's using some redirection thing, so it goes at like 100 bytes/second. This has never happened before I got the router. I called netgear and they were absolutely NO help at all. I turned off the netgear firewall and tried to port forward things but that didn't seem to help? Does anyone have any ideas? I have clients sending me files and I can't force them to have to email me everything all the time! That's ridiculous! Thanks.

13856	2	297018	2786918	2786910	crashfirephoenix	6/4/08 4:20 PM	1.2125964E12	yes	yes, I have already set it up like it says in the sticky
13856	3	297018	2786922	2786918	R. Proffitt	6/4/08 4:23 PM	1.21259658E12	Then exchange it for another router.	All the routers work for me when I follow our forum note or else they have a defect. Bob
13856	4	297018	2786923	2786922	crashfirephoenix	6/4/08 4:33 PM	1.21259718E12	so you dont think...	so it doesn't have anything to do with port forwarding? should i not have to forward the ports at all if i turn off the firewall and stuff? and...should I buy another netgear router or is there a better router out there? thank you for your suggestion
13856	5	297018	2787001	2786923	R. Proffitt	6/4/08 6:40 PM	1.2126048E12	Sorry.	But those apps work fine here without port forwarding. I use our forum sticky (you could tell me your setup if you want me to verify it) without any forwarded ports just dandy on many wifi routers. This is why I must call it DOA. Bob
13856	6	297018	2787003	2787001	crashfirephoenix	6/4/08 6:46 PM	1.21260516E12	sorry to bug you one last time lol	sorry lol. I have kind of fixed the issue..but not totally: I had 3 friends send me files, but only 1/3 could actually get the file to go through over AIM (trillian). the one who could send me the file is on a mac, the other two on PCs. does this change anything or do you still suggest swapping it?

Yes there are valid reasons to forward ports but for me I don't need it and it works fine across dozens of routers. Your PC could be the issue but I'm unconvinced your router is setup exactly per our forum sticky so that's still a possible issue. I can't count how many times we see the member come back with hidded SSIDs, WEP and MAC filtering. Bob
