Close any other application that is using the device and try again&quot;, but there is no other application using it. what should i do?

When I called HP, they told me that they only support tv capture with Media Center. I've tried every application. Made sure I disabled all the services that may be running that are associated with Media Center. Still it seems that Media Center is taking control of the device and is not allowing any other applications to use it. Can somebody find a registry setting or command to disable Media Center entirely?

There is a microsoft tech note that says to disable the Microsoft Media Center Receiver service via the control panel and then reboot. But even that didn't help. I'm so pissed off at Microsoft right now I better not continue this message any further... Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr

You need to right click on My Computer &gt; Click Manage &gt; then expand Services and Applications on the left &gt; click Services &gt; find 'Media Center Reciever Service' and 'Media Center Scheduler Service' and right click them and click stop for both. You must start them again when your done to make sure Media Center runs properly. DO NOT DISABLE THESE SERVICES, just stop them.

Yes, I stopped them first and attpemted the other applications and still get the same error. It is not a Windows issue. I called Adaptec. They told me that HP is responsible for support and HP still insists that it is a setting or configuration error. I spoke to them again today for about 2 hours before the battery ran out on my cordless. It has to be a driver issue, because the device gives me the exact same error on a different PC, running plain Windows XP. The driver is version 1.0 and is apparently designed to only work with Windows XP. I am still trying to get this escalated through HP support. The only way that there ever will be a different driver created is if enough people call there and complain. HP has to order it through Adaptec (if they haven't already, because when I called Adaptec they would not provide any information on it) CALL HP and complain!!! It's toll free and 24-7. Having a PVR that the driver cannot handle s-video, composite or audio capture is absurd!

First off, I'm sick and flippin tired of speaking to someone in Bangalore, India who barely speaks english,and insists on reading prompts from a computer screen. Second off, I'm tired of hearing that EVERYTHING is a third party software support issue. I just spent 1hr on the phone with HP Tech (NON) Support only to have Raja tell me he couldn't help me. If anyone can solve this problem, please please please post the solution here! ARRGGHHHH!!!!!!!! M
