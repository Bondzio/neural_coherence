<s> does anyone experience this kind of situation thank you i'm running AMD Athlon 64 2800+ socket 754 Asus K8V-X Socket 754 motherboard OCZ 1GB DDR400 Dual Channel Ram Premier Series ATI Radeon X700pro 256mb GDDR 8X AGP Creative Soundblaster Audigy 2 Value 5.1 Western Digital 160gb 8mb buffer hd Western Digital 350gb 8mb buffer hd LG cd-rw LG dvd-rw Thermaltake Tsunami W/Window Case </s>
<s> most likely the Id10T$ who did the case change work for you. </s>
<s> I can't tell you exactly what your problem is, but the possibilities are: 1. </s>
<s> Cables, connectors and jumpers are not the same as they once were; 2. </s>
<s> They damaged one or more of the components during the change-over. </s>
<s> ie, did they work in on a static-free bench? </s>
<s> Did they forget to plug in the CPU HSF fan and the CPU overheated? </s>
<s> Are the components in your PC the very same ones you had when you brought it in (like, RAM?)? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Your Windows installation has become corrupted for any one of a number of reasons, some of which could have occurred during the upgrade at the shop. </s>
<s> Have you called the shop and told them what you're experiencing? </s>
<s> Did they indicate to you that they had any problems doing the upgrade? </s>
<s> Are they willing to take a look at it free of charge to see what the problem might be (although I would be very skeptical of taking my PC back to the same place)? </s>
<s> If you don't mind spending a little extra money, I would recommend having a second experienced and certified PC Technician look at your system. </s>
<s> Get his analysis and take that back to the shop where you had the original work done. </s>
<s> Ask to speak to the owner or the manager. </s>
<s> Was the tech who did the work a new guy who they gave what they thought was an easy job to? </s>
<s> One thing is for sure: SOMETHING happened to your PC while it was in their care and custody. </s>
<s> It's like you took your car in to have the tires rotated and now it suddenly doesn't run very well and has trouble starting in the morning. </s>
<s> Simply changing the case shouldn't have made any difference at all to the operation of your PC... bottom line. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
<s> It sounds to me like they may have installed some software which runs in the background taking up cpu time. </s>
<s> Is it your parents' computer? </s>
<s> You should sit down and have a discussion with them about the problem and let them know the shop really messed up the computer. </s>
<s> It could be one of those eBlaster programs which is very hard to disable which keeps taking records of what you do with your computer. </s>
<s> In any event I'd get Webroot spysweeper from http://www.webroot.com/ for $30 and Ad-Aware Se from http://www.download.com/ the pay upgrade and run those and then all and get a good antivirus and firewall like McAfee at http://www.mcafee.com/ and install it. </s>
<s> If it is your computer maybe a good reformat of the hard drive is in order as well, that might help to eliminate the problem. </s>
<s> I wouldn't use that shop again. </s>
<s> There have been several posts through these forums about shops that offered repairs, and when the customer got his/her PC back, s/he experienced the EXACT symptoms that you've described: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7591-0.html?forumID=26&threadID=188147&messageID=2042214 As can be seen, this problem is slowly becoming more common - Nick </s>
<s> How 'bout this for a horror story: Lady has a brand-new Apple G4 laptop, and paid for a 4yr extended warranty. </s>
<s> CD gets stuck in the slot-load CD tray. </s>
<s> Has a homegrown xerox'd flyer that was stuck in her door advertising PC repairs and furniture for sale. </s>
<s> Guy comes and picks up the laptop, brings it back a couple days later telling her the charge would be $85 (no invoice or service ticket). </s>
<s> She writes him a check and as he's going out the door, says something like &quot;Umm, the CD doesn't always go in right, so you have to push it in all the way.&quot; (Note: The Apple G4 slot-loading mechanism should grab the disk and pull it the rest of the way in after only inserting it gently about an inch or less) She gets suspicious (about time!) </s>
<s> and puts a CD in. </s>
<s> Not only does she have to insert it ALL the way in, once it's in, it doesn't play. </s>
<s> Confronted with this information, the PC guy says something lame like &quot;Well it worked fine for me&quot;. </s>
<s> She tries it again... same thing. </s>
<s> At which point she says, &quot;Give me my check back&quot; (she's getting smarter). </s>
<s> He leaves (sans check) and says he'll call her later. </s>
<s> Now she brings the laptop to one of my techs, who she knows personally (and knew that he was a computer tech) and says, &quot;Can you take a look at this?&quot; My tech looks at the laptop and immediately notices that there are screwdriver/knife blade gouges and scratches ALL AROUND the perimeter of the once nice white pristine Apple case. </s>
<s> Furthermore, the lid is warped and will not close without a slight bowing. </s>
<s> Next we discover that the battery locking latch is busted and the battery cover will not seat flush with the case anymore. </s>
<s> For those not familiar with laptop cases in general and Apple cases in particular, there are several screws that hold the two halves of the case together. </s>
<s> Some are visible and some are frequently hidden underneath the (easily removable) rubber feet. </s>
<s> In the case of the Apple, these are star screws and you need a star bit or star screwdriver to remove or insert them. </s>
<s> One of the screws showed a couple of light scratches where someone might have tried to use a phillips or flat-tip screwdriver (and failed), but there were no indications that the rubber feet had been removed. </s>
<s> So... scratch (literally) one brand new laptop AND the extended warranty. </s>
<s> Two points to make here: 1. </s>
<s> There are a lot of fly-by-night so-called &quot;techs&quot; out there who don't have a clue what they're doing, have no certifications or formal training, no bond, no insurance, and often, not even a legal business. </s>
<s> Sure, they're cheap but you know what they say about getting what you pay for. </s>
<s> Shame on them. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The lady should have known better than to answer a cheap yard flyer advertising PC repair and furniture for sale in the first place. </s>
<s> Shame on her. </s>
<s> An afterthought: Even going to some PC shops and stores is no automatic guarantee, but at least you know they're a legitimate business, and therefore have a lot more to lose if they do shoddy work. </s>
<s> And don't even talk to me about the Geek Squad. </s>
<s> No, I don't have this problem. </s>
<s> I will give a solution. </s>
<s> Install SuSE 10.x or Fedora or Debian . </s>
<s> (These are linux flavors.) </s>
<s> Install whatever versions of media players and graphics are available. </s>
<s> Listen to this next part. </s>
<s> go to http://xensource.com/ and look for the xen virtual kernel. </s>
<s> Follow the directions. </s>
<s> You can create a virtual machine which shares hardware permissions along with the 0- base kernel system. </s>
<s> No, It is not difficult. </s>
<s> And, yes, you will be able to monitor performance and processes. </s>
<s> Open source uses swap space http://www.bellevuelinux.org/swap_space.html You'll have to do some hacking- or because you use windows &quot;tweaking&quot;. </s>
<s> Use the windows only for absoluteely necessary programs. </s>
<s> flash/macromedia, certain java machines, mp3 and wma files. </s>
<s> That's about all you'll need it for. </s>
<s> And the open source will crash less. </s>
<s> Just be sure to follow the installation instructions. </s>
<s> If you don't, that's your fault. </s>
<s> This is like telling a guy who has a problem with his furnace repairman screwing up his heating and A/C system that he should move to Montana and live in a Yurt. </s>
<s> While not knocking Montana or the virtues of living in a Yurt, it doesn't solve his problem. </s>
