I have been looking at the set up for the Gateways and Hp's. I have heard inthe past that Gateways are very difficult to upgrade anything with out it being a Gateway product. Has this changed ? I have also heard that the Hp has some problems with dependability. Just wanting to get the most bang for the buck. Gateway or Hp.

My next one will be my own build, you get what you want that way and you can make sure it will be upgradeable. Just some thoughts, good luck on whatever you decide.
