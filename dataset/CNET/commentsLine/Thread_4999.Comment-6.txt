your description indicates that you have a 1999 model powerbook, otherwise known as a ''lombard.''
given that fact, the best os possible without outside interference is os x 10.3 panther.
panther's default install requires 2.1 gb of free space.
a full install needs about 3.2 gb, and my best guess is that you can't make enough free space to satisfy this requirement no matter what you do.
as others have suggested, you could move your current macos installation to a larger drive.
an easy way out, for sure, but it could cost you time and money.
you could also try disabling the default ''archive and install'' option when setting up panther as an upgrade.
your system folders and core applications should be updated; and your user settings should be left intact.
the best solution, however, may be this: back up your users folder and any downloaded applications that you may have, and then format and install panther.
you can then copy the data you retrieved back to your hard disk.
good luck, redmage0326
