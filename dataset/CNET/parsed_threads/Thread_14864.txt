<s> I have a MO disk written UNIX 2.6. </s>
<s> I have a MO drive SMO F561 installed in my PC under Windows XP. </s>
<s> How I get data from MO disk written in UNIX? </s>
<s> I'd boot up Linux LIVECD such as INSERT LINUX which has NTFS write capability. </s>
<s> Now I have an OS with similar capabilities as the UNIX box. </s>
<s> I can also boot up Solaris on another PC (free to install today I here) and FTP the file from the Solaris or Linux machine to the Windows machine. </s>
<s> All I offer are possible solutions. </s>
<s> Given the vagueness of the MO media and it's file system that's all I can offer. </s>
