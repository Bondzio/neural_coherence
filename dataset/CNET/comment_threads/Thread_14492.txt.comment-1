I was wondering if it is possible to see DISH Network channels on a PC.
i know that it is possible with the regular cable (like comcast) with a TV Tuner card, but i am not sure whether it would be possible to do it via a DISH receiver.
can any1 help me?
cause i was about to buy a TV tuner card and this just struck me.
-thanks
