1.
Cable is going (eventually) to a new protocol called DOCSIS 3.0 (much faster speed).
2.
The Internet is changing to IPv6.
Get a modem that supports both.
I just purchased a Cisco DCP3000 that supports the new DOCSIS and IPv6, and is Gigabit output.
For a router I have the D-link DIR-655 Gigabit wired/wireless N. These two together will serve you well into the future.
And I hate to brag, but here is a screenshot of my Roadrunner cable speed after I installed the modem.
