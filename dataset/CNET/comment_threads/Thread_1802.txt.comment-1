A few weeks ago, I picked up a music CD I wanted to rip to my iTunes library.
At the time I was not connected to the internet, so the artist/album/song titles were not automatically added.
I manually renamed the songs from &quot;Track 1&quot; etc.
to their real names, and created a folder with the artist's name as its title (all from within iTunes).
Upon renaming the folder, the entire CD simply disppeared and I have not been able to recover it.
Is this an issue with iTunes' DRM?
Does anyone know what really happened?
