thank you willy.
i did not know the first bit you pointed out.
i.e.
both are different entities.
you in essence i knew but i followed the pathway as suggested by the supplier.
however i know the difference but still i failed to fix the problem.
in the device manager,under &quot;other devices.&quot; there are three items.1.
pci modem.
2. video controller.
3. video controller(vga compatable.)
i have gone through the procedure you described once again.
now i am sure the disc i thought had the (ati ver.
3.5) which came with the video card rad... 1300/1550 series )driver is not the right one.
all these have yellow question marks.
lower down in the usb list there are eight entries.
4 sis7001 pci to usb open host controller and four usb root hub.
in the middle there is n &quot;unknown device&quot;.
since i have six usbs 4 in the back and two in front.
it is the two in front (i believe) damaged.
i tried a restore system, it looked ok but soon got the the fault situation.
now the problem seems to be the two front ones.
my key board and the mouse is on the usb, i assume it is the back four that are working fine.
the solution you suggested re.
taking all the usb attached devices off leaves me up the creek without a paddle, so to speak.
how do i use the computer without the key board??
where to find the drivers?
i do not believe i have usb driver discs.
i fear i used to be able to recall all, but with advancing years it is a touch dicy.
no i am not quite altogether gone yet.
please forgive me if i am posing questions you have already answered.i thank you for your generosity of spirit.
