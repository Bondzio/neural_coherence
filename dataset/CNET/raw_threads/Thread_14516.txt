A while back my son-in-law, who is a wonderful fellow but works on a computer from the dark side (PC), was clued into a way to add wireless access to his computer without having an internal card. It was a little thing that looked like a stick, and I believe it was just inserted into a place on the back of the computer. It worked just fine. In some ads for places selling computer supplies, I saw just such a thing (I think), but I (1) don't know whether such a thing exists for Macs and (2) whether my computer--Sawtooth G4 desktop--is compatible with anything now being sold for that purpose. The computer never had an Airport Card, and if I wanted one, I'd have to search for an old one (probably 11b). I think I'd need the older versions of other equipment that goes with such an old card, too, so I was wondering whether that would pertain also to the kind of external wireless device I started talking about here. If I could buy something current, and if it was easy to install, what a blessing that would be! Forgive my ignorance. I don't even know what the thing is called, and I am aware that what I'm asking for may be totally out of reach, but hope springs eternal. . . . jenny

I read some of the articles from &quot;MacOSX Hints&quot; with a lot of caveats and &quot;buts,&quot; but maybe those problems have been solved now. I also looked at one site offering a variety of dongles. Not sure what characterizes the more expensive ones from the modestly priced ones, and I can't say I really understand all the terms, but when I get a chance, I'll read descriptions and try to decipher it all. Maybe I'll take the plunge, maybe not. It's something to consider when I have some more time. I do thank you very much, especially, for leading me to what to Google. Now I can return, at a less pressured time, to read more and make a decision. Best, though in haste, jenny
