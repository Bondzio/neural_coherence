zzjones, maybe not, in new drive create a folder named &quot;old drive&quot; then &gt;slave your old drive to the new one.
&gt;go to windows explorer &gt;if you can see your old drive &gt;copy my documents and program files to &quot;old drive folder&quot; do not attempt to find your files until after they are on the new drive.
after you have retrived the files you need old drive folder can be deleted.
you may only get one shot at this.
and it may not work but worth a try.
bill comments welcomed
