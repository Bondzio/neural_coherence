<s> I also cant decide which LCD Moniter would be good. </s>
<s> Any you would recommend? </s>
<s> Also, I would like it if the total cost of the computer stayed under $2000. </s>
<s> And, do you think the Powersupply(420W) could support the above items. </s>

<s> The reason I want SLI is so that later I can buy a 2nd 256mb video card(when the upgrade would be pratical). </s>
<s> I thought getting 2x 1 gig rams sticks would be good because then, if I ever wanted to upgrade to 4 gigs, I could just buy 2 more, instead of having to replace any ram, and having to buy 4x 1 gig ram sticks. </s>
<s> Do you think that 420W will be enough to run all the stuff? </s>
<s> Oh, I should buy some more fans and stuff, shouldnt I? </s>
<s> Do you recommend getting the San Diego or the Veince chip? </s>

<s> but software has yet to catch up with 64-bit processing. </s>
<s> Unless you are configuring for the future (2-3 yrs), you aren't going to see much of an increase in speed. </s>
<s> Microsoft has announced XP64 and if you have XP you can download the 64 free. </s>
<s> All your drivers have to be rewritten for 64 bit. </s>
<s> Until all this happens, everything will run as 32-bit. </s>
<s> BTW..I just traded my 64 for a P4C800-E (ASUS) w/3.4ghz. </s>

<s> I just bought a Planar. </s>
<s> They have a 3 year 2 day replacement policy. </s>
<s> I bought a new machine in April and have since upgraded with 3 of the items you've upgraded with. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Logitech MX510 931162-0403 Blue 8 Buttons 1x Wheel USB + PS/2 Optical Mouse - Retail 2. </s>
<s> CREATIVE Sound Blaster Audigy 2 Value SB0400 8 (7.1) Channels PCI Interface Sound Card - OEM 3. </s>
<s> Logitech X-530 70 Watts 5.1 Speaker - Retail I really like all the products, but here's a few tips; 1. </s>
<s> On the Logitech mouse, set a RESTORE POINT before installing it. </s>
<s> It mucked with my keyboard driver and I ended up uninstalling it and then reinstalling the drivers ONLY. </s>
<s> (Logitech has gotten into the bad habit of including advertisements and self-promotions in their software). </s>
<s> ONLY INSTALL WHAT YOU NEED. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The Creative Sound Blaster Audigy 2 OEM - compare prices at (A) newegg (B) ChiefValue and (C) UpgradeSource. </s>
<s> They're all 3 always running specials. </s>
<s> I ended up buying from UpgradeSource for $45 with free FedEx. </s>
<s> Creative also has some funky extra stuff. </s>
<s> Also, set a restore point prior to installation. </s>
<s> Also, remove ALL remnants of ANY previously installed sound card, including disabling onboard sound from the BIOS. </s>
<s> Once done, the Creative Sounds Sweet and their ''Creative MediaSource'' player sounds far superior to Windows Media Player 10 3. </s>
<s> The Logitech X-530 70 Watts 5.1 Speakers sound GREAT out of the box! </s>
<s> The extra thick cable on the right front speaker is a little awkward as far as limiting where you can place the speaker. </s>
<s> The cord is SO thick that it topples the speaker. </s>
<s> I had to wrap mine around a desk support to hold it in place. </s>
<s> Also, the rear speaker conections are short - 8 feet I think. </s>
<s> Plan on getting some RCA extensions if you have a large room. </s>
<s> I picked up a 17'' LCD from SVA (Korean company) and it works fine. </s>
<s> The refresh rate is only 75 Hz though. </s>
<s> Just shop around and by the way, the 420W power supply should be sufficient. </s>
<s> Good luck and keep us posted on how it all comes together! </s>
<s> I think the power supply is suspect. </s>
<s> I guess it would do for now, However with you wanting to go Sli in the future a better Psu would be high on my priority list, No sense in spending over a grand on a system and chance having a lower quality PSU take out some components. </s>
<s> Frankly Aspire is not noted for making quality Psu's. </s>
<s> With today's power chips, power graphics cards, power USB2.0 ports, SATA, etc..etc.. , power supplies no less than 500w should be used. </s>
<s> The Athlon64 alone will use over 100w. </s>
<s> You can buy now or double buy later. </s>
<s> Up to you. </s>
