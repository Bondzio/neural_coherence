I have it hooked up as a slave right now and am attempting to format the drive with Partition Magic. I can read from and write to the drive just fine in WinXP Pro, though Windows says it only has about 36 GB (I previously had a partition on the drive splitting it in half, so I'm guessing that is where this is coming from, but it no longer shows any partitions, just the one small drive). Partition Magic shows the drive as &quot;BAD&quot; and produces an error when attempting to format (bad parameter/argument). PM also reports that the drive has a bad MBR (Master Boot Record). In Windows I can format to NTFS just fine, but nothing changes in PM. I want my other 40Gigs back and to partition the drive again. Is there any software or special jumper setting that can get it right?

I suspect you format the drive into FAT32 earlier which may be why it only shows 32GB as XP cannot format a volume larger than 32GB into FAT32. If you use NTFS then it can format all the 80GB in one partition. Tell us what Disk Management reveals. It should show the balance of the HDD as unallocated space?
