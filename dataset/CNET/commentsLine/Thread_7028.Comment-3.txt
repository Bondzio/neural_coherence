thanks to a response from simpledrive, i figured it out (but thanks for the macfuse tip).
here was the fix - seems i had to return to the mac to fix it.
here you go for other mac & windows users: to format the drive on your mac, follow the steps below.
notes: all data on external will be destroyed during formatting process!
1. connect and power the drive.
2. open machd on your desktop 3. open applications 4. open utilities 5. open disk utility 6. on the left you should see the hard drive listed.
it should show the size with a second indented line beneath that says simpledrive or untitled.
highlight the line with the size.
7. click erase at the top of the screen 8. select the format you want in the volume format box.
ms-dos if you want to use the drive between mac and windows.
9. change the name of the drive if desired.
10. click erase at the bottom of the screen, you will get a warning where you will click erase again.
when the partitioning is completed then the drive will be ready for use.
