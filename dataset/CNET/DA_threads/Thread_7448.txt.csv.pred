1.1.1	Hi , I have an old HP laptop that is running Win98 that I would like to hook up to my home theater system .	St
1.1.2	What I would like to do is xfer my mp3 files from my XP Home ( SP2 ) desktop to my laptop , but I 'm not sure how to do it .	St
1.1.3	The desktop only has CD/DVD R/W drives , the laptop only has a floppy drive , and it does not have a network card .	St
1.1.4	It 's a real basic laptop with serial , parallel and ps2 ports on it .	St
1.1.5	I just remembered that I had the laptop and thought I could use it to store all my music files and easily hook up to my stereo system .	St
1.1.6	I 'm a novice at this but am able to follow clear instructions .	St
1.1.7	If anyone can tell me if this is possible without having to spend a lot of money in parts and software , I would really appreciate it .	St
1.1.8	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	If it doesnt it looks like you are completely out of luck .	St
