Troughout the past week my computer kept freezing every once in a while when playing World of Warcraft. I would have to restart my computer after the picture froze. Just today I was playing when suddenly the computer just turned off. I went to turn it on again and it will not power up. No lights, no fans, nothing. I figured maybe the power supply was dead, which would have explained the strange freezes I was getting throughout the week. I switched power supplies with an older computer and found the same results. The power supply that I thought was dead was working fine on the older computer, and my newer computer still had nothing. I tried switching the graphics cards with the same results, the graphics card works fine on the other computer. I don't think its the memory because the computer isnt even starting up. Seems like its a power problem, yet the power supply appears to be working fine on other computers. Could my motherboard have died out on me? I'm using an ASUS P5B-E motherboard and have had it for 6 months before these problems started. CPU is a Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz. Anyone have any ideas on how I should go about troubleshooting this? Any help would be great. Thanks!
