Had my custom machine since Summer 2003.
I'm thinking about keeping some parts while upgrading other core parts.
Here's a breakdown.
Keeping: Maxtor 120 Gb HDD Samsung 1 Tb HDD WD 500 Gb External HD 4x 512 Mb RAM Sticks (Might upgrade to 4x 1 Gb Ram Sticks) nVidia 6800 GT 256 Mb SoundBlaster Audigy 2 Gamer Case (its light aluminum, with swinging side doors for easy access) Need: New Motherboard New Processor (Thinking Pentium Quadcore) Gonna buy a Blu-ray Drive and DVD-RW Drive I never attempted anything like this, what are the potential problems I will run into?
Software, installation etc.
Also, I'm not that familiar with mobos, whats a good high end product?
Thanks.
