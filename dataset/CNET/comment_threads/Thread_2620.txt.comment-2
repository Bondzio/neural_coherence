Mike--don't know why your connection is dropping.
Have you called Linksys support yet?
I have to say that they are extremely helpful over the phone and very willing--no sighs or disdain, just good help.
The phone number should be at the back of your booklet or else go to their web site to tech support (if web access is available nearby, ie.
town library)
