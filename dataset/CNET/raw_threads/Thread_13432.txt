Anyway, I'm upgrading from an Athlon XP 1900 to an Athlon 64 3000. I've bought a MB/CPU/RAM combo and it will be arriving Wednesday. My question is this, when I go to install this new MB setup, can I just plug in my existing HDD's and keep going? Or will doing so cause many many many many headaches that will make me go bananas? If so, how do I circumvent this? Also, if there is a webpage out there on the 'net that shows a step-by-step upgrade procedure such as this, would you mind pointing me in that direction? Thanks in advance. Pedo...
