http://business.fsu.edu/tech/printermanuals/laserprinters/HP2100.pdf I could not find USB as an interface on this model.
You mention the 2100M model but that didn't have networking but the 2100TN did.
Sorry but maybe a computer guru can visit this setup and try with their laptop?
This way you know if it's your PC.
