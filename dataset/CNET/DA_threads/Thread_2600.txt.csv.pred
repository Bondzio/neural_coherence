1.1.1	hello all , this time around I 'm , or should i say my roomate , is having a problem with his internet connection .	St
1.1.2	Well the problem is that after a while his computer being on , the internet stops working .	St
1.1.3	It states that it is connected and fully functional but we ca n't surf the net .	St
1.1.4	Its really annoying especially since when i need it and try to use his comp to quickly check my mail instead of taking out of my laptop from my backpack .	St
1.1.5	To get it to work we simply just restart the comp and its good to go .	St
1.1.6	I do n't know if this is important but many times the computer is constantly on maybe days at a time .	St
1.1.7	No settings have been change that i know of and is scanned with AV and antispyware on a weekly basis .	St
1.1.8	Also the comp is connected to a wireless router ( D-Link DI-514 ) The setup is : Hp a1600n Windows XP Media Center Edition 1gb Ram 200gb HDD ISP : Time warner Thanks in advance for any help MarsDTA	St
1.2.1	right click on the computer icon in the toolbar ( bottom right down near the clock and calendar ) choose diagnose connection , let it run .	St
1.2.2	How about now ?	Ques
1.3.1	Well the first couple of times i tried your method it worked , but this morning it did its thing and i & quot ; repaired & quot ; the connection but still a no go .	St

1.4.1	and check the D-Link web site for any new ones after reinstalling the original .	St
1.5.1	I 've never installed a router driver .	St

1.6.1	http : //support.dlink.com/products/revision.asp This page will .	St
1.6.2	after you provide the needed information , take you to the newest driver for the adapter .	St
1.6.3	Drivers are available for both cards and chipset adapters .	St
1.6.4	This includes wired and wireless versions .	St
1.6.5	If you buy a card a disk usually comes with it to provide immediate support .	St
1.6.6	Kees sound like you need to look into a new driver .	St
1.6.7	Also , by the way , video drivers , audio drivers and ethernet adapter driver need to be sought out , auto up dating them is n't very reliable so you have to do it yourself to stay current .	St
1.6.8	I check every four months for new ones and they do change frequently .	St
1.7.1	I 've been really busy this week with school ( finals are coming up ) , but i finally had time this weekend .	St
