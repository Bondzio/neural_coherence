<s> I already own the 4 matching monitors, all are acer x243w - 24inch widescreens, I currently have 2 hooked up thru my computer off the video card, but would love to have all four *if not for maybe 3?) </s>
<s> hooked up for a reallly extended desktop. </s>
<s> What I am looking for is advice on what will work to make this happen or if this is even possible given my current equipment and setup. </s>
<s> I own an HP M7760n Multimedia computer 2.13 GHz Core 2, 2 Gig Ram, Vista Home Premium, the only upgraded item is the video card, I put in an msi 8600 Geforce GT card in it so I could run dual dvi monitors. </s>
<s> I checked out the HP page and it says I have one pci express 16, and 3 pci slots, I am using that geforce gt card in the pci express 16 slot, so available i have 2 pci's and the onboard video. </s>
<s> Is it possible at all to use the onboard video to add at least a 3rd monitor? </s>
<s> I hooked one up and rebooted but it didn't seem to recognize there was a 3rd monitor... Is there anything in the bios I need to adjust to allow onboard video to work with a pci express card or is this just not going to work? </s>
<s> I saw an option of a pci card by ati that supported upto 4 monitors, would that work in my pci slot? </s>
<s> (there is also a pci express 1 version) but I dont have a pci express 1 slot. </s>
<s> Just trying to learn what I could do (if anything) to add a 3rd or 4th monitor to this system and make it all &quot;work&quot;. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help on this. </s>

<s> The easiest thing would be to change the motherboard, it would allow you to add an additional PCI-E card and would help to future proof your PC a little. </s>
<s> 2 video cards in SLI (in your case 8600GTx2) would allow you to have 4 displays. </s>
<s> Keep in mind you would need a SLI ready Powersupply with the correct voltage and amps along with a SLI ready motherboard. </s>
<s> $50 geforce 6200 pci: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130289 btw, the onboard video is disabled when you add pci-express card. </s>
<s> If you plan to stay with your current system, then anything installable must be supported. </s>
<s> Your options are limited because you already have pushed the normal video limits. </s>
<s> No matter what direction you take, its going to cost. </s>
<s> Either replace the system to better handle this due to more slots or get a ext. </s>
<s> video box that splits amongest the LCDs. </s>
<s> Matrox makes such and I'm sure others at least duo display maybe more. </s>
<s> You need to google for vendors and/or solutions currently out there. </s>
<s> If you find a video card with more than 2 ports, then its a very special card, and probably is the most installable for your HP. </s>
<s> Under HP bios once you install another video port/card, on-board becomes disabled but again that depends on the video maker, in what they may offer via the s/w side. </s>
<s> Verify what the bios will do or check the manual/support website. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I was wondering if it could be that simple, just adding in a cheap pci card, but wasn't sure if it would work alongside the pci express 16 geforce 8600 GT card I currently have in there or if Vista would freak out over it or something. </s>
<s> Worth a try tho i guess... Bill </s>
<s> it will work just fine. </s>

<s> Actually, the easiest thing to do, would be to get a &quot;USB to VGA&quot; or &quot;USB to DVI adapter&quot;. </s>
<s> Then you can just add an extra monitor through a USB port, and you don't even have to open the computer. </s>
<s> You can even use multiple adapters to add extra monitors. </s>
