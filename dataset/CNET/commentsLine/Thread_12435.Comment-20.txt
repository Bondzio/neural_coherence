the clicking is normal - resulting from head/arm movements during seek.
all hd's make noises - but the maxtors seem to be particularly loud.
i installed one in a tivo recently, and can hear it from across the room when i fast forward through a recorded show.
if it bothers you, return the drives and try another brand.
if you are just nervous about it signifying impending trouble - don't worry.
