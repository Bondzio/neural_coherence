1.1.1	SO I have a 16gm sandisk jump drive , it has maybe 3 gbs on it .	St
1.1.2	I tried saving a picture off my face book to it and it says that the disc is full .	St
1.1.3	I had 12 gbs of music on it - and pulled that off , onto an external , restarted the system so now its back down to only 3 gbs of pictures on the drive , but i 'm still getting the error , The folder I 'm saving it into has 38 , xxx files on it , could that be the issue ?	Ques
1.1.4	Oh and using windows 7 , same issue on firefox and chrome , I can open word and save a doc into the folder as well no issues	St
1.2.1	You can see this happen if all the files are in the top folder .	St
1.2.2	Solution ?	Ques
1.2.3	Use a folder .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I ca n't even create a new sub folder i get error 0x80070052 , The folder structure is that i have the jump drive , then the folder & quot ; pictures & quot ; then my jpg files , I can create another folder on the main directory but not in the sub folder .	St
1.3.2	Can the folder itself become & quot ; full & quot ; ?	Ques
1.3.3	the other oddity is that I can pull the folder off the jump drive and save it onto my external ( click and drag ) and then still save files to it .	St
1.4.1	And because the long file names can take up multiple entries , there is no set number I can give you on what the top folder can hold .	St
1.4.2	Try to keep it low to under 100 .	St
1.4.3	And before you do anything else .	St
1.4.4	Back up this stick so you can start fresh .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Since most flash drives come in FAT32 format , some glitches apply .	St
1.5.2	How big is the file being tried to save ?	Ques
1.5.3	Even , if the file is smaller than 4Gb , it may allocate a larger size in order to fulfill the final total of needs .	St
1.5.4	Save , all your data and try this .	St
1.5.5	once that is done , reformat the flash drive to NTFS format and that should help greatly handle large files or data transfers to storage .	St
1.5.6	I found even 3gb+ sizes can cause problems .	St
1.5.7	tada -- -- -- Willy	St
1.6.1	Things you can do/try : - Copy the existing pictures off to your hard disk , delete them on the USB-stick , chkdsk it , then make some subfolders and copy the files back to them .	St
1.6.2	Try to keep each subfolder less than 5000 pictures .	St
1.6.3	- Do n't save from your browser to the jump drive .	St
1.6.4	First save to a temp folder on your hard disk .	St
1.6.5	Then copy to the jump drive using your favorite file manager ( like Windows Explorer ) Probably one of these alternatives is enough to solve your issue .	St
1.6.6	But it wo n't harm at all to do both .	St
1.6.7	Kees	St
