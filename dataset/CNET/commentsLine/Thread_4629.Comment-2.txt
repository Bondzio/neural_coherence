the hard drive is what model number?
what is the make and model of the computer?
with a proper installation of windows xp, there is no extra driver installation required.
the exception is sometimes when you need to install a serial ata (sata) driver to use an sata hard drive, but that driver would come from your pc or motherboard maker.
there are some maxtor hard drive tools (maxblast, powermax, et al.)
that may be helpful, but they are not drivers and are not required.
* * * * * once the hard drive is installed, you can partition and format it in disk management.
also, there are some maxtor hard drive models that require a firmware upgrade to work properly in some computers.
