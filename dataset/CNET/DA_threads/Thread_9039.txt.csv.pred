1.1.1	Plea from a digital artist .	St
1.1.2	Is there anyway you could please , please , make it a point to include in the specs of new tablets if they have pressure sensitive pens .	Ques
1.1.3	Sometimes its very hard to figure out what new tablets have this and what ones do n't .	St
1.1.4	Often it is buried in a review and given little acknowledgement.Most times it does n't show up in the & quot ; spec & quot ; sheets that are with reviews .	St
1.1.5	Even better if you could tell us levels of pressure sensitivity , and who makes the tech for it ( like Samsung using Wacom ) .	Sug
1.1.6	This info is VERY important for a digital artist looking into getting a tablet .	St
1.1.7	Even a simple & quot ; this tablet has a stylus , with 1024 levels of pressure , uses Wacom technology and tablet has enough power for serious Photoshop users & quot ; You cant imagine how hard it is to find some of this info at times .	St
1.2.1	There are less than a handful of pen equipped Android tablets so this one is very easy .	St
1.2.2	The answer is no .	St
1.2.3	It appears what you want is not made .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I know the Samsung Series 7 has the S pen , that uses Wacom tech .	St
1.3.2	But it was not easy to find that info .	St
1.4.1	1800SAMSUNG and they still answer questions .	St
1.4.2	But I looked and it failed other requirements you made so it looks to still be no .	St
1.4.3	Are you trying to find a replacement for the usual Wacom device that follows ?	Ques
1.4.4	http : //www.amazon.com/Wacom-DTK2100-21-Inch-Pen-Display/dp/B0038PQCQK Bob	St
1.5.1	I already have a Cintiq .	St
1.5.2	I want a digital sketchpad .	St
1.5.3	My only requirement was to ask Cnet to include this kind of info in their reviews .	St
1.5.4	As for the Series 7 Slate , last years model ran Photoshop fine , has Wacom tech , and was pressure sensitive ( I believe only 256 levels ) The new Series 7 Slate http : //www.samsung.com/us/computer/tablet-pcs/XE700T1C-A03US-features pretty much fits the bill ... .but its hard to find the info in reviews ... .that is what I am saying .	St
1.6.1	Clover Trail tablet PCs with digitizers : Samsung Ativ Smart PC ( Wacom ) Asus Vivo Tab ( Wacom ) Thinkpad Tablet 2 ( Wacom ) Dell Latitude 10 ( Wacom ) HP ElitePad ( not sure which type of stylus ) HP Envy X2 ( possibly ... not sure which type ) Ivy Bridge tablet PCs with digitizers : Samsung Ativ Smart PC Pro ( Wacom ) Sony Vaio Duo 11 ( N-Trig ) Microsoft Surface Pro ( unknown , but it will definitely have some sort of digitizer stylus )	St
1.7.1	And the answer is always been the market is n't there .	St
1.7.2	I see you listed a few digitizer equipped PC tablets but a quick check shows some do n't meet your specs .	St
1.7.3	- & gt ; I 'm unsure where you are going with this .	St
1.7.4	That is , let 's say your list met your criteria .	St
1.7.5	Why did n't you buy them ?	Ques
1.7.6	Bob	St
1.8.1	I think you are missing the point somewhat .	St
1.8.2	My original post was not an inquiry into what tablets to buy .	St
1.8.3	I have done the research and know some I am interested in .	St
1.8.4	The post was a plea to cnet to help people like me by including information about a tablets stylus , pressure , etc into their reviews and spec sheets .	St
1.8.5	Often this info is not included or glossed over in most reviews and is almost never on spec sheets .	St
1.9.1	These are the discussion boards for CNET members .	St
1.9.2	If you want to feed back to the CNET writes , find an article and look for the email links .	St
1.9.3	But my question is still , if you found an unit from your list that met your spec , why did n't you buy it ?	Ques
1.9.4	I have run into many of these & quot ; artists & quot ; and they want the iPad with that 1024 level digitizer for 99 bucks .	St
1.9.5	They always tell me & quot ; they 'd sell millions. & quot ; Sorry but as it turns out , the market is not there and it 's a lot more money because of the volumes .	St
1.9.6	Bob	St
1.10.1	I figured maybe some people from CNET might read these forums ... .and yes I did e-mail a few editors .	Sug
1.10.2	I have n't bought one yet , because I an saving the $ $ for one , and I want to see what is coming out in the near future .	St
1.10.3	Perhaps I am reading it wrong but the way you wrote & quot ; artists & quot ; in quotes like that , comes off as rather condescending .	St
1.10.4	I am an artist with 20 years of freelance , and 14 years of video game experience .	St
1.10.5	Most of us artists that want a digital sketch book know its a niche market , and are willing to spend a good amount for the right product.I have never met a digital artist that expects prices for a tablet to be $ 99 .	St
1.10.6	Almost all the artists I have worked with would pay a premium price for a tablet that meets our needs , and yes those needs are that of a niche market .	St
1.10.7	There is a market there , its just a smaller market , but that does n't mean it cant be profitable for a company .	St
1.10.8	Wacom does quite well selling most of its products to the niche of digital artists , and has only recently gotten into more mass market products .	St
1.10.9	Anyhow this is pointless and getting way off track .	St
1.10.10	This post was about addressing reviews .	St
1.11.1	I added that since artists are where this usually comes from .	St
1.11.2	I 'm sure you 've heard many of them blame the tools or the cost of the tools .	St
1.11.3	After hearing this for many years but no big market I have to agree that what you see is the result of market forces .	St
1.11.4	Wacom has been around for decades .	St
1.11.5	I 've only been at this a little longer ( see a GE-210 ?	Ques
1.11.6	I wrote my first program on that . )	St
1.11.7	And yes , I have met the 99 buck artist request .	St
1.11.8	It 's on the more extreme but the usual artist is well , a little short on change most of the time .	St
1.11.9	Maybe they have to produce with what they can make or afford ?	Ques
1.11.10	Bob	St
1.12.1	Perhaps a hobby , part time artist is short on cash most of the time .	St
1.12.2	But digital artists working in movies , TV , video games , advertising , web design can earn quite a nice chunk of change .	St
1.12.3	We artists are all not moody , dark , depressing , broke and wear black all the time .	St
1.12.4	Good artists do n't blame tools , because tools are just that ... tools , talent and hard work make something exceptional .	St
1.12.5	The computer is just a very , very fancy pencil , its what you can do with it , not what it is that matters .	St
1.13.1	The artists that I know that do well , get that screen I linked above and they 're pretty happy .	St
1.13.2	There is a bunch however that want an iPad with the Wacon 1024 pressure point system and more .	St
1.13.3	For you guessed it 99 bucks .	St
1.13.4	Keep writing the reviewers and hope .	St
1.13.5	Bob	St
1.14.1	All I can write in my defense is I 've been hit with that a few too many times .	St
1.14.2	With & quot ; the Arts & quot ; ( sorry if using quotes seems to upset folk ) changing media over the years maybe what is needed is some National Endowment for The Arts to promote the development and subsidy of the things that these artists want .	St
1.14.3	And again , keep writing the folk that do those reviews .	St
1.14.4	Here it 's a discussion forum and I do n't see the reviewers to chime in .	St
1.14.5	Bob	St
1.15.1	Ill keep on the editors .	St
1.15.2	You would think it would be easy to mention if a tablet has a stylus , and how many levels of pressure it has , maybe a little more difficult who makes the tech ... but even that cant be too hard to find out .	St
1.15.3	This little bit of info like this in a review would greatly help artist with me in looking at what tablet to get .	St
1.15.4	I am sure there are artists that want everything for nothing .	St
1.15.5	My experience , as I mentioned , is just different from yours .	St
1.15.6	Myself , and the other digital artists I know have talked about this for a long time , and most of us would be willing to pay $ 2000 and up if a tablet really met our needs .	St
1.15.7	$ 1200 and up if a tablet is mostly there ( I think I mentioned , the 2 things that seem to be missing for us artists types is more that 4gig of RAM and a dedicated video card ) To be honest , most of us keep hoping ( but in no way expecting ) that Wacom would team up with a manufacture , for a Wacom branded high end tablet ... ..but none of us are really expecting that .	St
1.15.8	Wacom already has the attention and devotion of the niche of digital artists , and many of us have willingly paid a high price for the Cintiq , that 's why we think they would be a good company to market to this niche .	St
1.15.9	I am excited to see what Win8 ( non RT ) tablets are coming in the next months ... .who knows maybe something will really stick out .	St
