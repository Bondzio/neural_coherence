I am running on windows xp which I have recently re-installed using a windows xp install disc not supplied with PC.
windows installed ok but my video card in not detected.
Directdraw and direct 3d are disabled but have no option to enable.
Cannot play any video type games.
Any advice please?
My PC is 'tiny' no disk and did not set any dates to restore to so cannot restore to factory settings.
HELP!
