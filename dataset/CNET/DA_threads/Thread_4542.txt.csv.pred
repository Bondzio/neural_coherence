1.1.1	Good Day I hope someone can assist by adding some light to this subject ?	Ques
1.1.2	I have an office with 7 Windows XP Desktops , all running Duel LG Monitors except for 1 desktop .	St
1.1.3	Some monitors are wide and some square but all with the same issue .	St
1.1.4	Also , about 3 out of 7 desktops has PCI-E Radeon Cards in them .	St
1.1.5	The problem I am facing is that they were running this setup for the last 3 years until they had their tables changed to ones that can elevate up and down .	St
1.1.6	With this in place , having to get longer VGA cables were needed and a simple 3Meter VGA DB-15 cable * 13 would do the trick .	St
1.1.7	Fitting the cables are n't any problem but as soon as I had them connected and then switched on the desktops .	St
1.1.8	I realized that there is a bad blur on every single monitor , even the desktop with one monitor .	St
1.1.9	I later went and got a 5 Meter VGA cable to test with and the blur goes better , but it is still there .	St
1.1.10	I even went and tried updateing graphics driver for 3 machines , 2 were Radeon HD cards and 1 Intel Express Chip .	St
1.1.11	Updated both with drivers and control centres but still no difference .	St
1.1.12	having to plug back the original cables coming with the Lg Monitors works like a charm , but then have the problem where I ca n't use the elevated tables .	St
1.1.13	My question would be , Is there any quality differences between these cables you can buy or is it about the length that it looses signal strength .	St
1.1.14	Just keep in mind that the 5 meter worked better than the 3meter cable .	St
1.1.15	Could it be a compatibility issue that I am getting here or is it ust my luck that anything above 1.8meters will be more blurry than the original cable .	St
1.1.16	Any assistance will be appreciated .	St
1.1.17	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	The signals from a video card or any from a PC ports are limited to the quality of cable and length .	St
1.2.2	Your problem if you use ext .	St
1.2.3	cables to std .	St
1.2.4	cable you degrade the signal .	St
1.2.5	If single longer cable , the same result .	St
1.2.6	You have reached the limits of video signal strength ( degradation ) and you see the results .	St
1.2.7	Either get & quot ; high quality & quot ; cables or a signal repeater that maintains signal strength .	St
1.2.8	Google for video boosters or similar , here 's one .	St
1.2.9	http : //www.google.com/products ? rlz=1C1_____enUS373US374 & q=extend+VGA+signals & um=1 & ie=UTF-8 & ei=dUW_S7rYAoyj_AaV5ZnWBg & sa=X & oi=product_result_group & ct=title & resnum=3 & ved=0CCIQrQQwAg Alas , this is n't going to be that cheap .	St

1.3.1	Hi and thank you for the reply .	Polite
1.3.2	It makes a whole lot sense when you say that the signal is the part that gets weaker as the cable length becomes longer or attached to more cables as extensions .	St
1.3.3	The way I am trying this is all with single cables , nothing attached to extend or anything .	St
1.3.4	just standard single cables , but having to use the 3 meter cables made it very blurry and using the 5 meter cable was slightly better but still blurry .	St
1.3.5	the 5 meter cable is a thicker insulated cable than the 3meter .	St
1.3.6	That would be a better quality then ? ?	Ques
1.3.7	the best quality I am getting is from the original 1.8 meter cable which I ca n't use because of the length , but I will check out those video boosters as well as every option will be tried and tested .	St
1.3.8	Otherwise having to buy proper quality VGA cables might be my only option .	St
1.3.9	How do I tell the difference in good or bad cables .	St
1.3.10	I Googled this question and found that they mention these signal blockers at the end of every side of the VGA cable .	St
1.3.11	also thicker sleeved cables are better quality .	St
1.3.12	Is this al true or should I know more than this ?	Ques
1.3.13	Many thanks	Polite
1.4.1	Honestly when it comes to quality , price is pretty much the factor of what you get .	St
1.4.2	Also , it should state its & quot ; shielded properties & quot ; .	St
1.4.3	Further , even with a single cable of hi-quality build and since you seem able to de-attach it , makes that an issue as well , because the fact you have a build-in break at the monitor .	St
1.4.4	Impedance is more introduced at all breaks in the cable length .	St
1.4.5	In other words , all connections imply a break , though complete with proper setup , depends on that being sound .	St
1.4.6	You will notice the monitor 's video cable is roughly 3-4ft ( 1M ) long .	St
1.4.7	If you find another single cable , I think the most it will be is 3M ( 8-9ft ) long and its a hit-or-miss it will work , thus try only on 1 PC setup for now .	St
1.4.8	You can google away for ideas but I suggest contact the monitor makers and see if they offer an optional cable .	Ques
1.4.9	Also , try this website for some clues or parts : http : //www.monitorworld.com tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	I am having the same problems with a 23 & quot ; LG LED monitor .	St
1.5.2	The only cable that works properly is the cable that is supplied with the monitor .	St
1.5.3	I need an 8-10 ' cable .	St
1.5.4	If you have found a solution I would greatly appreciate it if you would let me know about it .	St
1.5.5	Many thanks ... .	Polite
1.6.1	Skip VGA and go with a digital HDMI or digital DVI connection .	St
1.7.1	hi nelsonrh , i just bought a cheap cable & quot ; 5M VGA HD SVGA Extension Cable For PC Monitor Projector & quot ; from ebay for 3.90 it work for my computer but when i turn the computer off and the LG monitor on , it will show & quot ; check signal cable & quot ; .	St
1.7.2	i think is about the pins , some only have 14 pins connected ( not 15 pins ) but i am not sure .	St
