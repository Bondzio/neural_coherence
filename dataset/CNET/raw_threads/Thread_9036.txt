I was sure it was the solution but i still have the same issue. thanks for trying to help.

Your machine moved to another IP address and those other PCs that had found the printer can't find it because it moved to another address. If you give it time the other machines might work but I found most don't want to wait for that. Just get on the client after you settle on how you will be connecting that laptop and re-setup the printer share. Bob

In your case this is not a good idea as you flipped from wifi to wired. And it is hard on most owners. The lesson here is simple. Put your print server on a machine that won't be moving around. Bob

Sorry but that's me reading your post and it wasn't clear the printer was on a desktop. Ok, if it still prints over wifi then the most likely is the old firewall issues. I don't help with firewall configurations with step by steps since there are dozens out there but look at allowing all your LAN access to the server. I don't see the router IP as the issue here. Bob
