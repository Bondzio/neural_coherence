1.3.1	Hi , I think she 's referring to something I wanted to ask about myself .	St
1.3.2	Currently I have a linksys befws4 router , and when I 'm connected to the internet wirelessly , the connection stops working , so that the computer that is connected wirelessly can not reach the internet ( wired computers are not affected ; and it happens to the 2 laptops we have using the wireless connection , even if only one laptop is connected at the moment , and all laptops have different wi-fi cards ) .	St
1.3.3	I solve it by clicking the repair wireless connection option , which disables my wi-fi card , enables it again and the comp is again connected to the wireless networks .	St
1.3.4	But it 's very incovenient , especially bc it might take several times of hitting repair to get onto the internet again , and bc it means I ca n't really download anything , the connection might drop at any moment , sometimes every 5 minutes .	St
1.3.5	linksys support has told me to do lots of stuff but nothing has worked ( new firmware , changing mtu ) .	St
1.3.6	I was reading on the web that this is huge problem with my router 's model , so I 'm gon na get another model .	St
1.3.7	But reading reviews on amazon and other places , it seems that this is a problem with many routers .	St
1.3.8	Is there any brand or model you could recommend that suffers less from this problem than other routers ?	Ques
1.3.9	thank you so much for help !	Polite

1.4.1	Sorry to hear your tale of woe , but ca n't write I 've seen that .	St
