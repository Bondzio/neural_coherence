When I setup my new fast,option loaded HP dv8210us with built in B/G wireless....I was shocked to find that they do not support Netgear products....I have been to hell and back going round and round with tech service at Netgear as well as HP..... No help there!!! I have tried all the known configuration routines.....I also own a Newgear A/B/G pcmcia card....it won't work either......Disgusting. I have an old Dlink B band router that I daisy chained with the Netgear and that works but it is slow B band.....I have spent several hundred dollars on the Netgear and like using the A band security and other reasons.....not to mention not wanting to spend more money just to please those two guys that work out of their garage...Hewlett/Packard...Anyone here got ideas.... One more thing, I was in a coffee shop and my wireless would not work....asked the coffee person what kind of router....You guessed it Netgear... Absolutly Disgusting.....

890	3	188014	2041933	2041649	R. Proffitt	7/1/06 1:31 PM	1.15176066E12	WIsh I had a solid cure but here's what I would try...	1. Disable QOS in the router. Some do, some don't. I'm having some luck with that one. 2. Update the router's firmware. Actually the more common cure that I've run into. I'd call Netgear's support and (be nice) ask them about this. Bob
890	4	188014	2042939	2041933	jacky25491	7/2/06 6:57 AM	1.15182342E12	contact Netgear	Bob, I have been talking with them for over a week now, they won't talk on phone because my router is about a year old out of their coverage time..... I recently have been elevated to L2 tech services....Bob, all I get is the standard responses...They tried to get me to upgrade firmware also.....On the router you can do an auto check for upgrades....This said no upgrades avail....I then went to the specified firmware....the tech said it would be a zip file and to unzip...yadda,yadda......I looked at the file and it is a .bin.....one that is set for auto updates....no help, I still followed their suggestions.....didn't install, I do not think the problem is with my router...I have tried to use the HP at other locations, ie coffee shops....I have been to 5 or 6 and the hp works with every one....except one....When I asked the lady what brand router they had...You quessed it Netgear..... This is a company wide problem with netgear and all their routers and the fact that they are incompatable with the dv8210us.....I wish someone at CNET could get one on a loan basis and I feel confidant that they will experience the same problem....If they don't then I have a warranty issue for sure. One thing you left out is that HP has told me they don't support netgear......I think the implied thing is they don't support for my model.. I sure wish I could talk with someone who has a reputation and respect of the comunnity.....Everyone just thinks I am a ignorant user with a axe to grind.....I assure you I am not and I really like the Netgear products....When I first got the router and pcmcia card it was great to have 3 bands of transmission..... Regardless of what happens the next router I get will be A/B/G and it might be the latest (nimo, I think is the designation). I thank you for your interest and responses. I have emailed the CEO at HP.....well not to him but to his agents....I have not had response yet..... I am going to try the same thing with Netgear.

Outside of warranty there is (as you find) little support. When we talk of the firmware, please name names. That is tell what version is in the router and what version you downloaded. I agree that it's overwhelming to have to learn about .ZIP files, and what to do with the .BIN file inside, but unless you are will to pay for support (outside warranty) this is what you have to learn about. -&gt; I think it may be a mistake to get an A/B/G router. I've yet to find any 802.11A gear in 5 years. Why do that and force your selection to routers that are not mainstream? Here's my thinking. The router firmware may be out of date. Bob
890	6	188014	2043249	2042992	jacky25491	7/2/06 10:19 AM	1.15183554E12	Firmware	I had thought that also might be the problem...at least suspect.....The latest firmware 2.something has been around for a year or so.....I checked with netgear shortly after the release and was advised by the tech (netgear) that the firmware I have is current and active. I also have a auto update function on my WGU624...... I have used that to see if I am current, the auto update confirmed that there are no new firmware updates....OH, almost forgot when I talked with the tech, he mailed me a firmware and I installed it.... 1.something.9EM .....Concerning A/B/G..... This Netgear router is one.....and I also purchased a pcmcia card to compliment the router....I love it....and you would be suprised at the amount of A band stuff....Nowhere near G etc..but more than I thought..... It really works good and the range/power ratio is much better than b/g at least in my experience.... Hence I am taking much to much time trying to get this router to work...... If it were not for that I would tell Netgear to fly a kite and go buy a Buffalo, or DLink.....etc... I travel a lot so am always looking for networks to use and the A band has gotten me out of trouble more than once. When there are no others avail. I don't look at it as forcing or limiting my choices but expanding the number of places and connections I have to choose from, remember the router WGU624 is A/B/G/Super G. and the WG511 pcmcia card is the same. I can assign a download stream to the A band, while using the G,Super G to do any utility usage....I deal with GIS mapping and surveying....Big, I mean BIG files. Several gig is average.... It is like Newsgroups....little used but a world of information if you take the time to use it correctly. I wanted to comment about zip files....I have been using and creating those type of files for years and understand uses as well as limitations, generally....I repeat I am not what I would consider a Tech.... But I am a computerfile....and have been one for 25 years...I had my first network in the early 80's..Windows for workgroups....I concieved purchased and deployed in the company that I owned at that time.... My question to you now is what would you use to deploy a .BIN file? It is unrelated to the real issue but something that I don't know how to do unless it is bundled or part of a zip...I have seen them on platform discs.....Are they like .CAB type files? I know this is long winded but I am really interested in resolving this issue.... I want to be able to interface with any major manufacturer of routers. I don't want to have to ask every WIFI location &quot;what kind of router do you have?&quot; Most of them would look at me like I was from another planet. Think about it! Here is the issue as I see it.... Is it the responsibility for the manufacturer of the computer to ensure compatability with major manufacturers of peripherals or Is it the responsibility for the manufacturer of the peripherals to ensure compatability with major manufacturers of computers.. That is the question that no one has addressed, and you seem to be one of the few that even show any interest in the big picture....I really appreciate your interest and appoligize for bending your ear so long.... I owe you a beer.....Howard
890	7	188014	2043280	2043249	R. Proffitt	7/2/06 10:46 AM	1.15183716E12	Here and there...	Let me quote and comment... &quot;But I am a computerfile....and have been one for 25 years...I had my first network in the early 80's..Windows for workgroups....I concieved purchased and deployed in the company that I owned at that time.... My question to you now is what would you use to deploy a .BIN file?&quot; In the case of these routers I put the BIN in a ZIP and up on the web site. But many users can't handle that so automatic updaters in the routers &quot;should&quot; fetch and install. However I'm from the old school and know to rip open the boxes, compare version numbers and get the latest in spite of autoupdaters that often don't work. For example, my Dlink has an update firmware menu item and I point that to the .BIN file on my PC. It then gets it from there and performs the update. This procedure is the usual. &quot; It is unrelated to the real issue but something that I don't know how to do unless it is bundled or part of a zip...I have seen them on platform discs.....Are they like .CAB type files?&quot; Yes. &quot;I know this is long winded but I am really interested in resolving this issue.... I want to be able to interface with any major manufacturer of routers. I don't want to have to ask every WIFI location &quot;what kind of router do you have?&quot; Most of them would look at me like I was from another planet. Think about it!&quot; I've been traveling for years and at first all wifi hotspots were 802.11b. Now we see b/g. No where have I found 802.11A except in a rare business setting where some IT staffer chose it. It seems to be a fading standard. &quot;Here is the issue as I see it.... Is it the responsibility for the manufacturer of the computer to ensure compatability with major manufacturers of peripherals or Is it the responsibility for the manufacturer of the peripherals to ensure compatability with major manufacturers of computers..&quot; Neither. If you read the warranties and more they walk on that one and we are left to make it all work. Fine examples abound in the early days of WIFI where one maker's devices didn't work with anothers in spite of 802.11a/b/g standards. I'm finding bluetooth to be just as bad. Bob
890	8	188014	2043577	2043280	jacky25491	7/2/06 1:50 PM	1.1518482E12	Your pointed response	I agree with you on most points..... concerning a .BIN what does one use to activate and install...is there an app to use? I too thought A band was not long for the WiFi world but it seems all the new higher end 'puters are incorperating A/B/G capabilities.....I was suprised at the number of laptops(new) that had built in cards that were shall we say tri-band. I believe that it is like Bluetooth, which I have little or no knowledge of......never used.....I do know that it came on the scene and then died out and now is seemingly making a comeback....now it is a lot of places, I think the Telephony market liked it and made it their standard.... As far as travelling, I think you are of the impression that I am looking for A band only....This is not the case, I don't expect to find the local coffee shop to have a Super G, much less a tri-band card..... All of the non compatability issue revolve around general use...ie B/G/Super G.....The A band is for me mainly to use at my primary location. I hope you understand that my expectations are reasonable. I certainly don't think the Computer industry should comply with my wishes. I have used the term major on several occasions.... I understand business and that everyone can't comply with products made in someones &quot;garage&quot;...... I appreciate your interest and see that you have a depth of knowledge....That is good. I get one response from Netgear per day so let us see what they have to say tomorrow.... I also have taken several surveys from HP.....Maybe they will finally look and respond.... I am just to sit and wait I guess... I know they have other things to do, I just think this is a larger issue. Sometimes it is hard to get people to see the big picture...... Happy fourth....Are you a vet? Not an animal doctor!! ha ha ha ....Good day....Take care Howard
890	9	188014	2043660	2043577	R. Proffitt	7/2/06 2:49 PM	1.15185174E12	How I use the BIN file.	I point my web browser at my router. It has a system menu then I click on the update router button. From there a file browser button is clicked and the usual Windows file open dialogue shows up. Find the bin file, click OK and then back to the web browser. One more click on an OK and the router updates. I hear you as far as the computer industry goes. Wish they would do a lot better job. Bob

Now that the holidays are over I am spending time on my occupation.....funniest thing....about having to make money...... Again I appreciate your responses....I just am going to have to box this up and use the old b band Dlink router until I can save up and buy another brand of router to replace the Netgear products. Needless to say I am not impressed by either HP or Netgear.....They won't be at the top of my list on replacement of anything.. I finally got to a unhappy customer representative. His response was I should have bought a business HP laptop....What a jerk...... I am suprised at the way these people want to spend my money..... Really takes the cake. If I find anything else out I will let you know....
