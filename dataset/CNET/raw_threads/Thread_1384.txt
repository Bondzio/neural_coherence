At seemingly random intervals, the power will just die. Then it won't come back on. I have to unplug the power cord from the outlet end and then plug it back in before the PC will turn on again. Any ideas on what would cause such a bizarre problem? The sudden power loss isn't as baffling as the fact that I have to unplug and plug it back in again. Could a flaky power cord be the culprit? (It's never that simple, I know...)

Since it will power up, the kid has learned to do this and we'll wait for the day it dies altogether. Cost to repair? From 25 to 99 bucks for the replacement motherboard. Another machine had a too small power supply. For under 30 bucks I found the 680 watt PSU at newegg or geeks.com. That fixed that. I never skimp on the PSU size. While it can be an issue, you can sniff out if it's a cooling issure by leaving the case cover off. Thest machines do need a yearly dusting but no one tells everyone. Bob
