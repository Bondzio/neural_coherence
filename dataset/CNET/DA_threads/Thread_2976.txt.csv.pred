1.1.1	So.. long story short.. last night I burned a fresh DVD.	St
1.1.2	On the main directory there are 4 folders.	St
1.1.3	3 of them are movies and the 4th folder contains about 7,000 other documents (.txt, .php, .tpl, .gif, etc.)	St
1.1.4	amongst several sub-folders.	St
1.1.5	When I put the DVD into any computer (I've tried my laptop and desktop, and my brothers' computers) it stops reading after a minute or so.	St
1.1.6	I can still open up the 3 folders with the movies in them and even watch the movies, but the 4th folder just doesn't open at all.	St
1.1.7	I can't open it, copy it from the DVD to my hard drive, nor even right click it to see the properties.	St
1.1.8	I know the files were burned successfully because I checked the size of the space used on the DVD and it all adds up right.	St
1.1.9	I assume the drive stops reading the DVD because there's just too many files to read/index.	St
1.1.10	Is there anyway I can get around this?	St
1.1.11	Is there anyway to force the drive to not stop reading?	St
1.1.12	Or does anyone know any way I can retrieve those files?	Ques
1.1.13	I really need them.	St
1.1.14	Edit: Here is a screenshot.. http://vgcache.com/datas/images/3431-ruhroh.jpg	St
1.2.1	Sorry but your picture triggered an autolock.	St
