I have a Toshiba Satellite M115-S3094 with the below specs.
I want to upgrade to a larger drive.
How much more performance am i likely to get from a 7200RPM drive vs. another 5400?
How much will it effect the heat and the battery of the system?
Cost is not a significant factor and i will probably get a Seagate.
I am going to post this in the storage, peripherals, and BOL, please if you answer only answer once not in all three unless you have something different to say.
I value ya'lls i9mput, thanx, Bill 1.6GHz, due, Intel T2050 1GB RAM 533MHz FSB 80GB 5400RPM internal SATA
