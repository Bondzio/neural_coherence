<s> Dial up and broadband ? </s>
<s> Not sure what kind of dialup you can get since the lines are limited to about 64k. </s>
<s> Although tends to be a little tricky to configure internet connection sharing (ICS) is the feature microsoft designed to do this. </s>
<s> It tends to be unreliable when you use it to share high speed connections but works ok for dialup. </s>
<s> If you have a wireless router then you can have your PC share it with the router which will then allow other machines to attach. </s>
<s> If you do not have a router you will have to do direct machine to machine wireless. </s>
<s> You will need to configure your PC wireless to be AD HOC They use to make routers that had ports for modems so you could share that way I have not used dialup in many years. </s>
<s> On a second reading. </s>
<s> If you actually have a VPN client running like people use to get into their corporate network then the answer is you can't Most IT departments intentionally configure the VPN software to prevent it. </s>
<s> It can be done on vpn solutions that allow what is called split tunnel but this is considered poor security design. </s>

<s> My best guess is that that instead up using central hardware to limit users they are using software on the user PC to do this... and this is what they call a dialer. </s>
<s> Although they deliver optical to the house they appear to use a different system than other ISP that use.... almost like they use simple fiber optic lan switches. </s>
<s> Since they clearly have a warning about using a router I suspect when you get multiple users to work you also would remove any restrictions on the bandwidth. </s>
<s> I suspect you would get Someone would have to hack the client software. </s>
<s> If they are using PPP you more than likely could move the PPP settings including the userid and password to the router. </s>
<s> They do have a warning they will cancel your account if you mess up their network so not sure its worth the risk. </s>
<s> When they run software on your PC it all depends how it is implemented. </s>
<s> Some you can use the PC as a router and some you cannot. </s>
<s> ICS is your best bet but the ISP software must appear as a fairly standard network device to allow you to use this. </s>
<s> If ICS cannot see the adapter or it stops working when you activate it there is little you can do. </s>
