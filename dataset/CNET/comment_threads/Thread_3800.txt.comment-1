Im planning to load linux on to an external hard drive (around 100-150 GB), not really planning to use the OS for work or anything i just want to fiddle around with it because we are studying it in school.
So here are my 2 questions.
- Is a USB external HDD okay?
( many people say it will be slow because of the bit rate.
But the way im using it i think it should be fine.
- What brands should i look into?
Cheers Zack
