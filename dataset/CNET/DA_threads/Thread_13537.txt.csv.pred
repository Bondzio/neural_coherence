1.1.9	More than one of the above selections ( Tell us more . )	St
1.1.10	Other ( What is it ? )	Ques
1.2.1	Lee : It depends on WHAT it is for , have used pretty much all of the methods mentioned but generally use an external HDD { portable for L/T ) .	St
1.2.2	Also have several flash drives and sometimes burn data to hard copy , DVD/CD .	St
1.2.3	I have a stack of formatted floppies around here somewhere ca n't think of a good reason to keep them so they will likely disappear in the near future .	St
1.2.4	Best regards .	St
1.3.1	Other machines on the LAN .	St
1.3.2	Use scheduled , selective B/U .	St
1.4.1	I use a Seagate 500gb external drive , and put some content on CD 's or DVD 's as well .	St
1.5.1	I have my Drobo setup as a NAS off my Airport Extreme that I backup all my important stuff to plus I use Jungle Disk offsite for my really important stuff .	St
1.6.1	resides on a networked file server that is scanned nightly for virus and then backed up 2 generations to mirrored disks .	St
1.6.2	Also keep a weekly full data backup on mirrored hard disk stored remotely .	St
1.6.3	OS , programs and profiles never backed up since they can be re-installed .	St
1.7.1	I 'm a fairly active amateur potographer , and lover of old-style contemporary jazz , and wanted a means of storing both photos and music files off of my hard-drive and have immediate access to the data , plus a a fairly easy means of accomplishing backups .	St
1.7.2	Following what I considered extensive research on the avilable means of storing backups I settled on the HP Media Vault MV-210 .	St
1.7.3	It is connected through my Verizon FIOS router , provides scheduled backups of My Documents , Photos , and Music files .	St
1.7.4	The NV-2120 comes with one 500GB hard drive with the ability to double that capacity with the addition of a second 500GB hard drive .	St
1.7.5	I 've had the device for approximately six months , have approximately 250GB of data ( both music and phptos ) stored on it , and have become quite comfortable with its features .	St
1.7.6	It just sits on the corner of my work area and automatically takes care of backups .	St
1.7.7	Then it tells me when it is performing a backup and then goes back to sleep .	St
1.7.8	Occasionally , just for peace of mind , I check the stored data by actually listening to music stored on the drive or viewing and edditing pictures that are out there .	St
1.7.9	I hope that helps .	St
1.8.1	For everyday backups I use an external hard drive .	St
1.8.2	Every week or two , though , I select some of my older data and back it up to CD or DVD .	St
1.8.3	I make two copies of each disk .	St
1.8.4	Only then will I allow the data to be removed from my hard drive .	St
1.8.5	I do not consider an external drive to be a permanent solution .	St
1.8.6	I also insist that I have at least 2 completely separate copies of the data before I consider it backed up .	St
1.8.7	I like my system .	St
1.8.8	It allows me to make a copy of my data quickly and easily .	St
1.8.9	I just have enough sense to know that the quick copy is not entirely secure , so I have another method I use regularly .	St
1.8.10	Denise	St
1.9.1	I have learned some lessons over time and I 've progressed so far .	St
1.9.2	It 's ironic that this post came up too because I just had an external hard drive go on me !	St
1.9.3	I had purchased a Maxtor OneTouch III 320GB external hard drive to backup to and it was good until about a month ago ( 14 months of occasional and not being plugged in ) .	St
1.9.4	The enclosure first had a short then the PCB ( printed circuit board ) fried .	St
1.9.5	By the way if anybody has a Seagate ST3320620A with firmware 3.AAD , help please !	St
1.9.6	Learn from me , as enticing a retail buy may be , build your own external hard drive .	St
1.9.7	If you know how to install RAM and reformat a drive , you have the right skills to do it .	St
1.9.8	Do your research on types of hard drives if you 're not sure about terms and types of hard drives are on the market .	St
1.9.9	My best advise would be to find a pair of identical hard drives and an enclosure with RAID1 ( array of hard discs ) with mirror support .	St
1.9.10	Depending on what you want in terms of capacity , it 'll probably cost a couple hundred .	St
1.9.11	In most cases , your choices may cost less than buying retail .	St
1.9.12	Do n't forget to look for an enclosure which can dissipate heat and maybe have a fan .	Sug
1.9.13	A RAID1 is my next action in saving my data .	St
1.9.14	I hope this time it works to my advantage !	St
1.10.1	I have two external hard drives to which I regularly back up my files .	St
1.10.2	On the smaller ( 100 GB WD ) drive I store my Windows OneCare Backup information ( Music , Financial , and other data files ) .	St
1.10.3	On the larger drive ( 500 GB Seagate Free Agent ) I backed up my entire C Drive .	St
1.10.4	This extra bit of caution came in handy this past week when I got the urge to upgrade my trusty XP Professional to Vista ( what was I thinking ? )	Ques
1.10.5	After experiencing multiple problems with Vista , I simply formatted and wiped my C Drive , reinstalled Windows XP and restored my C Drive .	St
1.10.6	had a C Drive crash .	St
1.10.7	Since there 's no easy way to & quot ; downgrade & quot ; from Vista back to XP , I simply formatted my C Drive , wiped it clean , and then reinstalled Windows XP .	St
1.10.8	Then I restored my C Drive without a single problem .	St
1.10.9	Every computer owner should have at least two external hard drives on which you schedule regular ( at least weekly ) backups .	St
1.10.10	This is fairly easy if you just back up you C drive and then schedule incremental backups for any changes .	St
1.11.1	with my really important data I back up onto an external drive .	St
1.11.2	I back up also onto my laptop and also to another family owned computor away from my home .	St
1.11.3	every month or so i also back up to a dvd .	St
1.11.4	My photos of which there are millions i have backed up on two copies of dvds.ad have most of the recent ones on PC and external drive .	St
1.11.5	a lot of my best photos are on pbase.com but i dont count that as a back up just as a sharing medium .	St
1.11.6	I know that murphys law states anything that can go wrong will go wrong but as long as my databases are secure and my photos reasonably secure i am happy .	St
1.12.1	Lee , I 'm going to chime in my 2~cents worth -- I have used DVD-RAM for more than 14 years .	St
1.12.2	( b4 it was a ram like disc..more to the point , was a PD disc and was not 4.7Gb ) I used PowerQuest then dump the image to the ram disc .	St
1.12.3	( if it was a full image of the & quot ; c & quot ; drive for example . )	St
1.12.4	I now use Ghost..it is just like PQ .	St
1.12.5	PowerQuest was & quot ; THE & quot ; program that many computer companies used for the & quot ; quick restore & quot ; feature that they promoted .	St
1.12.6	Symantec ( formally Norton 's ) purchased PowerQuest and named it & quot ; Ghost & quot ; .	St
1.12.7	The Ram disc record just like a hard drive..they are not linear ( spiral ) recorders like DVD .	St
1.12.8	They access the disc faster than any DVD .	St
1.12.9	The disc is made differently than a DVD , there are no dye refection problem ( i.e : -R ) .	St
1.12.10	these discs are extremely stable in most environments .	St
1.12.11	can be recorded more than a 1000 times !	St
1.12.12	and have a shelf life of a 100 years !	St
1.12.13	the medical industry has , and still uses them as a primary archival medium .	St
1.12.14	they are stored & quot ; off site & quot ; meaning they are not in the computer at all times .	St
1.12.15	i myself have NEVER had an issue with one at all .	St
1.12.16	i have stored them in a basement , on a shelf for over 8 years..the disc work fine .	St
1.12.17	just for S # % ts and giggles..i have even tested them in water for 6 months..not a problem .	St
1.12.18	A hardisk has to be exercised every so often or they will seize .	St
1.12.19	( interpeter failure , motor bearing grease harding , etc . )	St
1.12.20	Storing the drive is important too , the magnetic coating that is placed on the aluminum platters expands and contracts at a different rate than that of the platters , this has been taken into account during the design of the product .	St
1.12.21	however , to many fluctuations in tempature and humidity can cause the magnetic layer to lift..and destroy the drive .	St
1.12.22	The movie industry is grappling with this problem as we speak .	St
1.12.23	they are now taking digital movie information ( from parts of the film that were like.. digital effects , sound , outakes cut-ins etc.. ) and either moving it from a HDD and putting it on film , like Kodak 's Vision 2 or the new Vision 3 film .	St
1.12.24	( can last over 100 years ! )	St
1.12.25	and storing it and using DVD-RAM as another media for long term storage .	St
1.12.26	They have found that the hardisk has a life of non use of about 2~4 years .	St
1.12.27	DVD about 15 years .	St
1.12.28	before the data ca n't be read .	St
1.12.29	the RAM disc does not have these kinds of problems .	St
1.12.30	but has two others that i am aware of ... 1 , the disc only holds about 4.7 Gb of info , 2 , will there be recorders around that will read the disc in a 100 years ? ? ?	Ques
1.12.31	same holds true for USB devices such as hardrives and the like ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.12.32	but right now the RAM-DISC is fine for me , it is robust and safe and darn near bullet proof .	St
1.12.33	Forget Blue-Ray , way too much info on a disc that is easly damaged .	St
1.12.34	Sony 's way of making it desposable B4 it is usable .	St
1.12.35	( the information layer is only .01mm away from the surface of the disc in respect to the RAM-DISC about .5mm away from the surface.. ) Now that is a BIG difference !	St
1.12.36	That 's my 2 cents worth .	St
1.13.1	using a mounted drive .	St
1.13.2	We create very little material to backup so this method works for us .	St
1.13.3	We started doing this after repeated failures using CDs/DVDs and Acronis .	St
1.13.4	Takes about 10 minutes and can backup everything but settings and programs , Emails are a little more complicated but everything else is very simple and quick to backup .	St
1.13.5	This thread is untracked .	St
1.13.6	Bang !	St
1.14.1	I do use DOS scripts with Robocopy to synchronize my data to a D-Link DNS-323 NAS , this have two seagates 500Gig in raid 1 and when this is done i also synchronize it with another low cost ADSTech 320Gig NAS .	St
1.14.2	This last one is small and portable so i can carry it with me .	St
1.14.3	Having a NAS on network is more interesting than having a USB drive because it can be accessed from any computer on the network at the same time .	St
1.14.4	Differents share can be done for every user and they can do their own backup to their shares .	St
1.15.1	I 've only quickly scanned these discussions but I can believe that I have n't yet seen any mention of Apple 's Time Capsule .	St
1.15.2	It 's a wireless NAS solution that 's platform neutral .	St
1.15.3	And if you happen to have a mac with leopard , backups are automatic with Time Machine .	St
1.15.4	My house has both Macs and PCs so this was the only thing that I could find where we could access files- with any relative ease - from both platforms ... love it .	St
1.15.5	It 's another great product from Apple .	St
1.16.1	I used an external drive until last year when the drive was hit by a power surge and I lost everything including up to 12,000 photos .	St
1.16.2	Hence I do not recommend this type of backup .	St
1.16.3	I now use DVD .	St
1.17.1	Hi , I have been using and subcribing to an online backup company called Carbonite .	St
1.17.2	It simply works exactly as it says and is so unobtrusive and seamless in its operation .	St
1.17.3	I seldom if ever recommend many products but this one is by far one of the best I 've seen or indeed tried .	St
1.17.4	I used BT DigitalVault before but that was so user unfriemdly if you needed to restore , whereas Carbonite is as easy as reading your own drives in explorer .	St
1.17.5	Added to which I do not think there is any limit to the amount of storage and I 'm over 20GB now .	St
1.17.6	The one big drawback i see with carbonite is that it , as yet , does not support removable storage I have a 500GB USB hardrive which it can not see or recognise and so i have to be careful what i store on this drive , but I do understand that this may be resolved in the future realese .	St
1.17.7	The cost of a years subscription to Carbonite is really so cheap it far outweighs buying another hard drive for backup purposes and as I have aready mentioned in the subject line .	St
1.17.8	If its critical stuff then simply burn copies to CD or DVD disc 's .	St
1.17.9	Cheers	Polite
1.18.1	I do use an old external Iomega 160GB hard drive as one .	St
1.18.2	But why do n't people , especially those who can go inside the case of a PC , add a 2nd hard drive and also back up there .	St
1.18.3	That is what I do as well .	St
1.19.1	My backup system : VXA tabe backup ; 2external hard drives ; additional computer ; network server ; BluRay 50gb RW disks .	St
1.19.2	One of the external hard drives is kept offsite .	St
1.19.3	This may seem to be a lot , but , if you 've ever lost 85GB of ripped MP3/FLAC CDs , and had to rip them again , it adds a great measure of comfort .	St
1.19.4	I use a synchronization program to keep the music files current on all devices .	St
1.19.5	I backup the music when there is a change .	St
1.19.6	Ordinary data files are backed up weekly ; less often when I 'm not home .	St
1.20.1	( Sorry , this is a duplicate post to the first poll message , did n't know about the 'how ' poll til later ) .	St
1.20.2	I use/make at least two CDs ( using a different manufacturer 's CD for each , to lessen any potential writing problems ) .	St
1.20.3	Then I read each ( in another CD reader ) , and get copy of its contents ( using CMD ( or , COMMAND ) DIR /s /s & gt ; filenameDateETC.xxx ) .	St
1.20.4	The contents file provides a neat way to search for a specific file , when I need to find it ) .	St
1.21.1	We also use Carbonite to keep data backed up .	St
1.21.2	I especially like that it just works in the background .	St
1.21.3	Similar to having a network file server backed up each night .	St
1.21.4	I 've also been known to backup stuff to DVDs to keep copies of our important files , pictures , etc .	St
1.21.5	I 've never thought of external HD as being a & quot ; Backup & quot ; method for me .	St
1.22.1	I use an external hard drive and also use Mozy , an online backup .	St
1.22.2	I do not need a huge amount of backing up , so Mozy has worked great for me .	St
1.22.3	I have always had at least two ways of backing up .	St
1.23.1	External : 250gb Fantom Drive via Firewire , Time Machine , automatically hourly .	St
1.23.2	Nothing better..	St
1.23.3	Highly sensitive data , etc .	St
1.23.4	are also dragged to a 500gb SATA drive .	St
1.23.5	Need to create Time Machine for the PC	St
1.24.1	I do a full backup of my data to DVD , every week .	St
1.24.2	My backup program , is Genie Backup Manager Pro v7.0 ( www.genie-soft.com ) .	St
1.24.3	I love GBMP , because it it also copies a Restore Executable along with the data , onto the DVD .	St
1.24.4	This lets me restore data directly from the archive DVD ... mick2222	St
1.25.1	I save a drive image to external hard drives once a week with daily incrementals .	St
1.25.2	I also save all of my data to dual layer DVD once a month with weekly incrmentals .	St
1.25.3	The DVDs contain ZIP files so no special software is required to recover the data .	St
1.25.4	I have restored my system from a drive image one time , and it took a couple of hours .	St
1.25.5	I have also recovered old data from the DVDs .	St
1.25.6	The DVDs are the best , because I can go back to any time in the last four years .	St
1.25.7	I have tapes from before that , but I no longer have the software or the drive so they are worthless .	St
1.26.1	I have a 2nd hard drive in my computer that I use to back up with the program Acronis , once a month .	St
1.26.2	I also have an external hard drive ( 250 g ) to back up certain data and photos , plus certain things I back up onto smaller usb drives .	St
1.26.3	I do all this because I have a very slow internet connection due to living in the country , and had problems with my computer with me ending up reformating the computer about every 3 months and then the awful updating of windows , etc online .	St
1.26.4	The problem ended up being a power supply that just was n't powerful enough for the computer .	St
1.26.5	Most of those problems ended once I got a better power supply .	St
1.26.6	Now it 's just when I do something stupid .	St
1.27.1	I wish this had come up for you when it did for me , 2 weeks ago .	St
1.27.2	I am a DJ with tons of music and HAD it all backed up on a WD external..	St
1.27.3	I have used this process for years , but just a couple weeks ago , ( 1 year and 1 month after it 's purchase , it stopped .	St
1.27.4	I hook up , it & quot ; clicks & quot ; 3 times , and that 's it .	St
1.27.5	No & quot ; running & quot ; or & quot ; spinning & quot ; sounds at all , and obviously my Hp/ompaq presario , with Vista , does n't recognize THAT activity .	St
1.27.6	Ironically , this external has NEVER , had a jolt , ( drop , slap , punch , bump , spill , etc ) ... . but the Iomega I had for about six years , had been Dropped hard , from at least waist high , on concrete , at least 4-5 times ... .and I never had a problem with it .	St
1.27.7	as a matter of fact I just recently gave it away because it was still going after all this time , but it was too small .	St
1.27.8	Now , I believe I have decided to put all the music on DVD 's .	St
1.27.9	Not as convenient , but it is when you consider the loss of ALL your data .	St
1.27.10	If you ca n't tell , I am not sure I have made the right choice yet , so please chime in , and let me know , What is the best method .	St
1.27.11	By the way , so that i am not bashing WD ... . they did offer a $ 15.00 coupon ... LOL I WAS 30 DAYS PASSED THE WARRANTY ! ! ! ! ! !	St
1.27.12	!	St
1.28.1	when you say & quot ; ... HAD it all backed up on a WD external.. & quot ; do you mean you had it all **stored** on a WD external with no copy remaining on your PC 's main drive ?	Ques
1.28.2	I raise the point because I am finding more people confusing & quot ; storing & quot ; versus & quot ; backup & quot ; .	St
1.28.3	If the WD held just the backup copy , so what if it crashed ?	Ques
1.28.4	You are justified to be po 'd at WD and you have to buy a replacement , but you have n't lost any files .	St
1.29.1	I use several methods to back up my files , which includes data , tons of pictures and a limited amount of music .	St
1.29.2	I originally was backing up to a Desktop that I set up to function as file server so that my data was in two places .	St
1.29.3	Then I purchased a WD 250 gig portable hard drive a while back and was primarily backing up to it but then realized that the back up was only as safe as the place that it was kept .	St
1.29.4	The portable harddrive is connected to the file serve and is in the same office where I land after coming in from working in the field .	St
1.29.5	The threat of fire or theft made me realize that if either happened I was up you know what creek and it did n't matter about the paddle .	St
1.29.6	So I 've signed up for Carbonite and now back up everything to the hard drive on the file server which that folder is backed up consistentaly to CArbonite .	St
1.29.7	I then do a monthly or biweekly back up to the portable hard drive .	St
1.29.8	Recently I 've seen a device which is similar to the partable hard drive that comes in 1 , 1 1/2 , and 2 terabite sizes that acts both as a back up but can also be accessed directly from the internet with proper protections in place from anywhere you have internet access .	St
1.29.9	The networkable device may be my next purchase .	St
1.29.10	The increased size and the ability to go online from anywhere and get what I need if I forget it at the office sounds like a great deal fro less than $ 300.00 .	St
1.29.11	Would love to know if anybody has any experience with a device like this .	St
1.29.12	Thanks Walter in Louisiana	St
1.30.1	I use Windows Home Server .	St
1.30.2	It clones all my computers , 3 Laptops , as well as duplicates the backup .	St
1.30.3	It does this Daily .	St
1.30.4	I had a hard drive go out on one of the Computers and it took me around 45 minutes to restore it completely .	St
1.30.5	It was like there never was a problem .	St
1.30.6	It also allows add ins for additional services as well as a built in remote access for family and friend to access pictures and other files if given permission .	St
1.31.1	I back my PC 's up with the a HP MediaSmart EX470 Server build around the new Microsoft Home Server architecture .	St
1.31.2	The HP MediaSmart Server ( EX470/EX475 ) takes the worry out of data protection by automatically backing up all of your important media and other files .	St
1.31.3	Designate folders are copied automatically onto multiple hard drives for an additional layer of redundant protection .	St
1.31.4	It utilizes file/disk mirroring rather then RAID .	St
1.31.5	Restore individual files or an entire PC hard drive in the event of a hardware or software failure .	St
1.31.6	Four internal hard-drive bays , four USB 2.0 ports and one eSATA port for storage expandability ( over 9 TB ) .	St
1.31.7	Easily expand capacity with off-the-shelf SATA drives installation doesnt require tools or cables .	St
1.31.8	The HP MediaSmart Server EX470 provides a central location to keep all your files for easy access and provides the capability : 1 ) Centralize and share your files and media across your home network .	St
1.31.9	2 ) Remotely access files on your server and run applications on your home PCs from any internet-connected computer .	St
1.31.10	3 ) Stream photos , music and videos to PCs on your network or to your TV or stereo system .	St
1.31.11	4 ) Automatically copy iTunes music libraries from family members ' PCs to the server for streaming .	St
1.31.12	TIP : Purchase the EX470 and add your own additional 500GB SATA2 drive ( s ) .	St
1.31.13	It remains the more cost effective purchase .	St
1.32.1	As I mentioned in my Reply to the Storage Forum topic & quot ; Poll : Be Honest : ... & quot ; I do several levels of backup , including : 1 .	St
1.32.2	& quot ; Archived & quot ; photos and music - on site and out of home sets of DVDs 2 .	St
1.32.3	Yearly back ups onto DVDs of essentially all user files , including new photos and music , mostly at home but a current one at a friend 's house .	St
1.32.4	3 .	St
1.32.5	All current user files saved on a Seagate Free agent Pro , which also gets weekly Nero backups .	St
1.32.6	4 .	St
1.32.7	Most user files saved on-line at Mozy .	St
1.32.8	Having had two HDD failures , I 'm glad I had backups .	St
1.33.1	I read your reply to Lee .	Polite
1.33.2	What brand is your external hard drive , and why not two for different types of backups -- music , photos , and important files .	St
1.33.3	My wife had her Money file on my laptop that fried , and while I did a backup of all files and folders , they became corrupt and I lost everything -- photos , important files , and music -- many that can not be replaced .	St
1.33.4	Q1 .	St
1.33.5	What software do you use to back up your music to a DVD , and what kind of a DVD burner do you use ?	Ques
1.33.6	Q2 .	St
1.33.7	What is pbase.com ?	Ques
1.33.8	Many thanks for the reply .	Polite
1.33.9	Thomboy	St
1.34.1	What synchronization program do you use ?	Ques
1.34.2	I wish I could sit and watch you do a few of these backups ! !	St
1.34.3	Thomboy	St
1.35.1	In probably 10 % of the posts in forums about backing up files and folders , I see Seagate Free agent Pro mentioned .	St
1.35.2	Is it a hard drive , or an external website to store data .	St
1.35.3	Does it come with software to enable both backups and restores ?	Ques
1.35.4	Thanks , Thomboy	St
1.36.1	Hi Thombo65 , Seagate Freeagent Go is a small , portable , USB hard drive .	St
1.36.2	I have the 320 GB size and it measures a very compact 4.75 & quot ; x 3.75 & quot ; x 0.50 & quot ; ( approximately ) .	St
1.36.3	The two things I like about it , as opposed to the similar ( and similarly recommended ) Western Digital drive are : - it has a 5 year warranty - it has useful software , especially the tool to let me define which directories need files in them backed up as soon as they change , without waiting for a time interval , specific backup time , or manual request to do a backup .	St
1.37.1	Thanks , Geekguy : I just got back from Mexico where a friend is also looking for an external hard drive for backups .	St
1.37.2	Unlike me , his hard drive has not needed to be formatted , but he has thousands of .jpg photos to backup that can not be replaced .	St
1.37.3	We will both look at the Seagate Freeagent Go as a preferred option .	St
1.37.4	Thanks again .	St
1.37.5	Thomboy	St
1.38.1	I back up to Maxtor 250 gb external hard drive ( my desktop is 250 gb also ) using ViceVersa Pro software ( purchased online separately ) .	St
1.38.2	Critical file backup is done in real time automatically and encrypted .	St
1.38.3	Non critical file backup is performed once a day automatically .	St
1.38.4	Also have a smaller SimpleTech portable drive that I remove from bank safe deposit box , update , and return to bank prior to travel .	St
1.38.5	If we are home and a hurricane hits , just take the laptop and backup drive connected to desktop and go .	St
1.38.6	If we are away and catastrophe takes place , we have the drive in bank vault .	St
1.38.7	Have already scanned all important legal docs , medical records , etc .	St
1.38.8	Still in the process of scanning balance of historical family photos and articles , etc .	St
1.38.9	so that we do n't lose any documentation and have all the scanned receipts of household purchases for insurance and replacement issues .	St
1.38.10	Hope this info helps someone else .	St
1.38.11	Thanks for the forum .	St
