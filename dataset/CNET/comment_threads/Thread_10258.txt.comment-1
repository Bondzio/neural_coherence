My Daughter Download a Background picture to my desktop which replaced my original picture.
After changing the image back to the original all seemed ok till I closed down my computer.
As it was going through the process of closing down,The image was flashed on the screen instead of the blue screen i normally see.
Now as i start up my computer the image shows up as background for the start up process and shut down process, how do i remove this image from my system??
The Image does not show up as a background pic in my control panel for the display.
I'm using Win2000 pro
