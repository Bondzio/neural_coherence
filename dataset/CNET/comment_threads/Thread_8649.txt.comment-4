What would you suggest for good, long term storage?
10 years is a long time, enough time for another storage device/system to come out and transfer my data to.
To further explain, If I get one, I'll be using it for site bookmark's, a bit of music, text files, ETC.
I'll use it often but not everyday.
How soon would it wear out, when used often?
PS: Yes, I know a physical, non-electronic method would be best.
