on my web server.
i back up my site regularly to dvd and external hd.
and every month or so i clone the entire drive to another external drive.
bummer that it failed, but inserting the cloned drive put the system back on line in minutes, and adding the backups was easy.
i don't go for the backup software.
i also clone my main pc drive to yet another external drive.
recovery is ten times faster and simpler than restoring a backup.
