thanks for clearing all that up.
i do know a bit about high end ati cards, because i want to buy i new computer sometime soon.
i am also fairly knowedgable about crossfire and stuff.
i was wondering, if i was to upgrade my agp fx 5700 le video card to something less than $200 tat plays oblivion and other such games fairly well.
would the x800, x1300, or the x1600 fit into that criteria well?
thanks for the help!
