<s> Is there any problem using PC 133 ECC SDRAM with PC 133 Non-ECC if my BIOS is set to non-ECC memory settings? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Shouldn't be, but you'll know if its compatible very soon. </s>
<s> You neglected to share the make/model numbers of the items. </s>
<s> For instance, the 256 MB memory stick issues on BX based boards is legendary. </s>
<s> And such would use SDRAM. </s>

<s> For example, we have some P4 1.9 GHz machines that perform like P3 800 Mhz machines all due to a mistake by me to recycle some sticks of SDRAM. </s>
<s> Since the deed is done and the machines are used for email, Open Office and have no payback if I was to fix this issue, I haven't changed the motherboards and RAM, but I still kick myself over that one. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> Oh, if your board does SDRAM, you won't see the BX issue I noted. </s>
<s> until more $$$$. </s>
<s> Thanks as always. </s>
