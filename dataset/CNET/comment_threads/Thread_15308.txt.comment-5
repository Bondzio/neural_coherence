When you look at the specs for an LCD monitor, you will see one for &quot;native resolution&quot;.
This will have something to do with the relative density of the pixels and tends to be the best setting for image quality.
You can change the resolution but the image quality can visibly degrade much more than with a CRT type.
There is quite a difference in price as they move up in size you really need to buy one that has a native resolution that offers the amount of screen content you wish rather than get a smaller one for less money and think you can just adjust the resolution to compensate.
You may not be so happy with the image quality when you do this.
