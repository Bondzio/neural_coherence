<s> Hi, A couple of days ago my computer was working happily, then I left it for a few hours, came home and it had died! </s>
<s> If i unplug and plug it in again the orange LED on the mobo lights up for a few seconds, the lights on the keyboard flash and the case fan twitches and thats it. </s>
<s> Although the psu would be my first suspect its a $$ 550w thats only a few months old. </s>
<s> The mobo and processor are both 2.5 yrs old and are the only original components I have kept in there since i built it - everything else has been upgraded. </s>
<s> Could one of them have blown/died? </s>
<s> I have inspected the mobo & all components and there is no smells, damage etc. </s>
<s> Is it possible that if the mobo goes it could blow the psu? </s>
<s> System: mobo: Gigabite GA7-VAXP, 756DDR, XP1800. </s>
<s> Thanks very much. </s>

<s> Loads of people warn me about NOT getting cheap ones as when they go they take ALL your tresured hardware too..... </s>
<s> I rekon you're using a cheap-takky PSU? </s>
<s> I'm not too sure but that might be your problem. </s>
<s> I'd look at the inside of your PSU and see if they're is something wrong. </s>
<s> Hi, I got a mid range psu originaly, today after i wrote my original post i opened it up and it smelt of burnt electronics. </s>
<s> 'Theres my problem' - or so i thought. </s>
<s> I have since been to the store and bought a new psu of a different make (still mid range), i have hooked it up to the mobo, cpu & ram and i still have the same problem. </s>
<s> The ram LED is lighting up on the mobo, so power must be getting through to it. </s>
<s> Is it possible for the mobo to die and kill the original power supply on its way out? </s>
<s> Is there a way for me to test the mobo? </s>
<s> I have also inspected the other components and there is no smell/damage. </s>
<s> Thanks Cat </s>
<s> Check the MB closely for bulging, leaking, domed top (rounded) capacitors. </s>
<s> One is too many. </s>
<s> This is a common problem with older equipment and may create all sorts of symptoms with your system. </s>
<s> If found, the easy and most practical fix is to replace the MB. </s>
<s> Best of Luck </s>
<s> I have this model mtrbd., but regardless you need to closely inspect the mtrbd.. </s>
<s> The usual suspects are the capacitors or possible bad memory. </s>
<s> If you notice a bugling, burst, blown or leaky caps, this is a very likely culprit. </s>
<s> Follow your nose for the burnt smell to its componets. </s>
<s> YES, a blown p/s unit can take out the mtbr. </s>
<s> plus even after replacing the p/s the secondary problem can backfire and take out the new p/s. </s>
<s> Thus, you need to inspect. </s>
<s> Try reducing the system, you need ONLY the 1 ram, mtrbd. </s>
<s> and p/s with kybd. </s>
<s> and video. </s>
<s> If it beeps like crazy or actually boots up, then some drive(s) is bad or even ram if multiple installs, swap around. </s>
<s> You can even remove the cpu and fan, and see if it beeps. </s>
<s> If it *doesn't* beep then(it should beep), you have a serious mtrbd. </s>
<s> problem, replace is the best bet. </s>
<s> Check those caps. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Hi, Ive gone down to the minimum that willy said to test with and theres no beeps, i enen rotated my ram sticks, so im going to have to get another mobo. </s>
<s> Thanks for you help willy & stan. </s>
