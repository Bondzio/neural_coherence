I am very confused.
I have an old ATX power supply.
I would like it to become the replacement for a worn out Emachines AT power supply.
I can't seem to find the right cable or adapter I need.
I did find an ATX to AT converter but it looked like the ATX side was male and I need it to be female.
plz help.
This plans to be my Linux learning tool
