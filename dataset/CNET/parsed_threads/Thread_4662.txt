<s> Hy, i need help. </s>
<s> My pc is 7 years old =) And now I want to create a new PC. </s>
<s> But I dont know what is important. </s>
<s> I need high quality propsitions (to playing games) for a new pc. </s>
<s> Thx for the help. </s>
<s> After I read http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-core-i5,2410.html my thoughts are you may want to find an i5 based system and then pick a video card from this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2404.html It would be hard to do better than that. </s>
