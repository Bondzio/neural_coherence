1.1.1	Here is the short of it 1) My PC froze.	St
1.1.2	2) I rebooted because it would not respond.	St
1.1.3	3) I received &quot;Boot disk failure load system disk&quot;.	St
1.1.4	4) I selected Repair in the windows xp home edition setup menu.	St
1.1.5	5) I received the message &quot;Setup did not find any hard disk drives&quot; I moved the hard disk drive to another pc and it booted from the drive in question just fine so this problem is not my hard drive.	St
1.1.6	I attempted to reload windows xp using a new SATA cable and a new hard disk and I received the same messages described above.	St
1.1.7	I tried this install using all 4 SATA ports and had the same errors.	St
1.1.8	I am thinking maybe a bad SATA controller on my MSI AMD motherboard?	St
1.1.9	Any ideas?	St
1.2.1	Installing XP to a SATA hard drive is not simple enough.	St
1.2.2	Not to duplicate all the thousands of posts I'll keep it short.	St
1.2.3	1.	St
1.2.4	You must have a XP SP2 CD or newer PLUS (read 2, 3) 2.	St
1.2.5	Try the BIOS setting to enable IDE emulation or disable AHCI.	St
1.2.6	No, I didn't read your motheboard manual.	St
1.2.7	Just sharing what I try.	St
1.2.8	3.	St
1.2.9	If your motherboard doesn't do that, use the drivers from the machine's maker they gave you on the F6 FLOPPY DISKETTE to give XP SATA support.	St
1.2.10	Good luck, Bob	St
1.3.1	1) I am using XP SP2 CD 2) IDE emulation is enabled Any other ideas?	St
1.3.2	Thanks!	St
1.4.1	Take it back to its maker for correction or fixes.	St
1.5.1	As described in first post, this was a working pc until a few weeks ago.	St
1.5.2	When you say &quot;it's&quot; defective, what are you referring to?	St
1.5.3	As far as the setup, it was working fine until this message appeared.	St
1.5.4	I have tested the following: 1) Both hard drives are recognized in another pc and Windows XP boots correctly.	St
1.5.5	2) I tried reconnecting the hard drives using a new SATA cable and that didn't make a difference.	St
1.5.6	I am thinking that maybe the SATA controller went bad?	St
1.5.7	At this point I am following up on the warranty for the mother board.	St
1.5.8	Thanks!	St
1.6.1	My bet is the motherboard.	St
1.6.2	It could be settings but if they don't reveal how to set it then it's just a bad board.	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
