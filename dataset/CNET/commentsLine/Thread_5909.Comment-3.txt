i think netbooks are better and faster than most of the laptops i've seen more than 5 years old.
once you get an external dvd rom or network share your dvd rom on your home network, then you'll pretty much be set.
most netbooks are pretty easy to mod and add more memory, max it to two 2 gb, it's cheap and makes a difference.
