the top of this very forum in the lost and found post notes many titles.
but the one i want to give the first nod to is in &quot;the lacie miracle.&quot; by booting that cd and without any knowledge of linux or installing any new software i can look at such drives and often see what is hidden from windows.
but that does not mean i would delete such.
many times these are recovery systems.
