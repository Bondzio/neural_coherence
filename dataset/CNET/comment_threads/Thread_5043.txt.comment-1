DO NOT ORDER PRODUCTS DIRECTLY FROM THE EPSON ONLINE STORE!
Buy it at a store and you can most likely take it back, buy it at the Epson Online Store and it is yours forever regardless of the issue.
You can however exchange it for the same product if it is a failure of the item you ordered.
I have used Epson products (printers) for many years and have never had a problem and I have always been happy with print quality.
However, I recently bought their Bluetooth Printer Adapter 2 (because it has to be an Epson Bluetooth to work with an Epson printer) to find out you can ONLY PRINT PICTURES, no text, no PDF, nada... Can't return it though and you really are not made aware of this UNTIL you receive the product and look at the back of the receipt!
