I am going on vacation in 2 weeks and there is only 1 place on the island that offers wireless internet access. I have heard that it is possible to buy a wireless card that I can plug into my laptop in order to receive wireless access w/o having to go to the wifi hotspot. (Would love to be able to catch up on work e-mails and participate in my fantasy draft without leaving the pool!) Is this true? If so any suggestions on the best product? Thanks

At best those services provide dial-up type speed, not worth the cost if you ask me. Enjoy your vacation and take a break away from the Internet, that's what I'm gonna try to do in two weeks.
