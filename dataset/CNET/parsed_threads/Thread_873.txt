<s> I bought a gateway FPD2275W monitor and am using it with Windows VISTA and NVIDIA 8800 video card. </s>
<s> The problem I'm having is that when I turn on the monitor it takes about 5 minutes to come on to the desktop. </s>
<s> It shows a black screen with a faint Gateway word and logo then it will finally come on. </s>
<s> I do not have the monitor driver loaded because when I did that the picture was all full of lines even with the VISTA updated monitor driver from gateway. </s>
<s> So I went back to the generic monitor driver in VISTA. </s>
<s> I have all the power saving options turned off. </s>
<s> I do not have the monitor software installed as it has problems with VISTA. </s>
<s> It also had the same problem with my other video card. </s>
<s> Is there a setting within the monitor itself that would keep it from coming on? </s>
<s> I noticed that the same thing happens with the same monitor in the store displays. </s>
<s> The salespeople don't have a clue. </s>
<s> Thanks for any and all help. </s>
<s> Who would let them keep money for this? </s>
<s> Heck, if the store display didn't work, then don't wait return it! </s>
<s> The time in *now* to return it as store policies are far more friendlier within 15days or less. </s>
<s> I'm sure you touched on all the issues that effect the setup, but Nvidia have been a sore issue with Vista. </s>
<s> OEM's are waiting still for such, plus if the monitor is not stated as Vista capable it too can fall through the cracks until a later time its 100% fixed or accepted in the fold, let them fix it. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> This just happened to me after one week of use. </s>
<s> See the forum posting description below for the exact symptom. </s>
<s> I had to unplug the power cord as mentioned in another forum answer to &quot;reset&quot; the monitor (the monitor menu's reset option has no effect). </s>
<s> This same thing also happened to a personal friend of mine who bought the same FPD2275W monitor around 9 months ago from Circuit City. </s>
<s> Just thought you should know. </s>
<s> Maybe there is a firmware update from the manufacturer to permanently fix this? </s>
<s> The monitor is always plugged in and even when you &quot;turn it off&quot; with the button or by Vista &quot;power plan&quot; options, the power button is lit purple (the off color) so it still has external power applied to it. </s>
<s> Just surprised this happened after one week! </s>
<s> I didn't install the Vista EzTune software yet because of reported issues with Nvidia 8800 cards. </s>
<s> My friend has EzTune installed on his XP system and the same freeze happens so that can't be the cause. </s>
<s> Its something with the monitor hardware onboard processor itself. </s>

<s> When the monitor goes into power-saving mode, or I turn it off while the computer is on, it takes a loooong time to turn back on. </s>
<s> When I turn it back on the gateway logo pops up on a black screen and just stays there for a minute. </s>
<s> Then it shows the desktop but the little blue window that shows it's connected via DVI is on the screen for another 30 seconds. </s>
<s> So it takes a good minute and a half to actually see the desktop. </s>
<s> It's almost like it freezes for a minute and a half. </s>
<s> Anybody else have this problem or heard of it and know how to fix it?&quot; Answer (by another user): Try unplugging the power then plugging it back in ... this should reset the monitor. </s>
<s> my menu buttons dont lite or work anymore. </s>
<s> they flickered and stoped working. </s>
<s> as a result i get the menu screen on my display and it dont go away!! </s>
<s> does anybody have any idea?? </s>
<s> please help? </s>
<s> ? </s>
