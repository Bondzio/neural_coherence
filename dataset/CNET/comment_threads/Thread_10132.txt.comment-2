Link about -&gt; http://winhlp.com/WxDMA.htm Then again I've lost count on how many times I see shop installed Windows that are &quot;not done yet.&quot; Most will just use what CDs came with the motherboard.
Some won't bother with even that.
Also noteworthy is a recurring speed issue on CDR media.
The bulk back of CDR is marked 52X but if you examine the media with tools you find it's only 16X media.
When you confront the seller they note it's &quot;compatible with 52X recorders.&quot; If you have Alcohol 120% you can record at full speed then get a graph of the speed achieved during the burn.
