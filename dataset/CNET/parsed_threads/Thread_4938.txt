<s> I have two (2) sticks of 512 MB DDR Ram.. One is PC3200 Apacer the other is PC2700 Crucial. </s>
<s> When I put the two together, it said Running at DDR 333 in DUAL CHANNEL MODE as I booted up. </s>
<s> The problem I have is when playing vice city, if I play for about 5 - 10 mins (it varys), then it will pop up with an error and say Unhandled Exception. </s>
<s> Also other things started to crash like MSN Messenger, and I wasnt even using it. </s>
<s> I removed the PC7200 ram and I played Vice City for 3 hours lol and it didn't have the error any more. </s>
<s> I just want to know why this is happening and if I get another stick of Apacer 512 PC3200 if the problem will go away or not :-| I have an AMD Athlon XP 2500 + and I know thats not where the instatability is at because its not overclocked and not overheating. </s>
<s> I have an NF7-S Abit Motherboard. </s>
<s> Thanks for any replys </s>
<s> &quot;I just want to know why this is happening and if I get another stick of Apacer 512 PC3200 if the problem will go away or not :-|&quot; The usual issue can be the OS. </s>
<s> Windows 3, 95, 98 and ME have issues past 512MB. </s>
<s> Even NT, 2000 and XP may run fine on 256 or 512MB. </s>
<s> In fact, you may have found a flaw in your machine and since its very new, make it a warranty issue with your machine supplier. </s>
<s> Ask for it to be fixed or your money back. </s>

<s> thanks for the reply I have music folders that are huge..like 500 songs per folder and win xp pro locked up some. </s>
<s> so i added 512 mb..problem solved but then i had crashes. </s>
<s> its a custom built machine and i have read reviews about the mother board and people having up to 2 gigs in it without any problems. </s>
<s> what i was wondering is if it might just be some suck ram I have in it. </s>
<s> would you recommend getting that ram thats sold that comes in pairs thats made for dual channel? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> &quot;would you recommend getting that ram thats sold that comes in pairs thats made for dual channel?&quot; Again, NO ONE will tell you with any warranty that this will fix that. </s>
<s> But I think you just answered your question. </s>
<s> I will share that I see a lot of those type machines. </s>
<s> I have to set the FSB from 266 to 200 or 133 to 100 MHz and often the machine stabilizes. </s>
<s> Many cry out saying it will run slower, but random reboots or lockups seem pretty slow to me. </s>
<s> In short, why isn't there a warranty on this machine or its parts? </s>
<s> Call the suppliers. </s>

<s> Ran Prime95 which showed errors... Called around and found that the PC2700 Ram was causing statability issue... </s>
<s> Took it out and ran prime95 again with no errors... hmmm i guess the abit nf7-s doesnt like pc2700 or crucial ram anyways thanks for your help bob </s>
