<s> Hey, I was just recently browsing through tigerdirect when i came across this motherboard. </s>
<s> http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2473506&CatId=1533 I looked at the specs and the picture and it seems to be everything i was looking for, for a new motherboard. </s>
<s> It is SLI certified, has 4 SATA ports, 3 pci slots, socket 775 (compatible with my pentium D), Core 2 duo ready, Gigabit lan support and 4 DIMM sockets that support up to a decent 667mHZ DDR2 240 pin memory modules. </s>
<s> What is the downside to this mobo? </s>
<s> What am i overlooking? </s>
<s> Is this a reliable brand? </s>
<s> What seperates this mobo from the $600 ones? </s>
<s> Is the chipset any good? </s>
<s> If not will it effect graphics performance greatly? </s>
<s> Could you send me a link to some other mobos that are better, sli ready and a reasonable price? </s>
<s> the site is tigerdirect.ca so the price is in CAN dollers. </s>
<s> Anandtech.com, Tomshardware.com, PCPer.com, HotHardware.com, Xbitlabs.com, etc., You could also go to Newegg.com to read 'actual buyer' reviews/comments of the product. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> i never trust ECS, Jetway, Epox, MACH SPEED , PCCHIPS etc mobos these mobos have no nice tech support and can't be used more than 2-3years because of the weak capicator. </s>
<s> these mobo are expensive but really good even good at overclocking 1-EVGA 680i (16x16) 2-Asus p5n32-sli (16x16) 3-Asus p5n-sli (8x8) better choose a mobo which works sli in 16x mode. </s>
<s> there are many other mobos in SLI http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.asp?Category=20&N=2010200280+1070509908+107171927&Submit=ENE&SubCategory=280 http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.asp?Category=20&N=2010200280+1070509908+107171871&Submit=ENE&SubCategory=280 </s>
<s> The chipset on that mobo failed to meet the high expectations for an nForce chipset. </s>
<s> The 610 was the first to be considered to be as good as or slightly better than the Intel chipsets. </s>
<s> Look closely though, some of the Intel chipsets have ZERO support for PATA drives. </s>
<s> Although on a given mobo the mobo mfr may add a chip to provide one PATA IDE port [2 drives]. </s>
<s> I think the $600 motherboards you see are actually combo deals. </s>
<s> Motherboard + cpu, motherboard + video card, etc. </s>
<s> Thanks that little bit of info helped me understand the pricing of motherboards. </s>
<s> Just one other question, what exactly is the purpose of the little 1&quot; slot next to the PCI Express slot, i know that its a part of the PCI-E slot but that is its purpose? </s>
<s> I cant seem to find anything on a video card that would plug into the slot. </s>
<s> Not even the big monster video cards that take up two expansion slots. </s>
