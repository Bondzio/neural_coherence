I'd love to get some thoughts on these components.
I like the total price point I'm at, though I could deviate if I can get a nice performance boost if I spent a little more(meaning ~$100 more) - Intel Core 2 Duo E8400 3.0GHz 6MB L2 Cache LGA 775 65W Dual-Core Processor http://www.newegg.com/Product/Produc...82E16819115046 $189.99 -Corsair Dual Channel TWINX 2048MB PC6400 DDR2 800MHz E.P.P.

This will be for gaming and general purpose(Web Browsing, MS Office, etc).
I do have one specific question... Is my RAM matched up well with my CPU?
Or will the RAM speed be a major bottle neck?
All other suggestions are appreciated.
