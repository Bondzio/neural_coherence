i recently had to send my laptop into dell for repairs.
well, dell decided that my laptop was damaged beyond repair and sent me a completely different one, along with the harddrive from my old laptop.
i've tried putting the old harddrive into the new laptop, but i just keep getting error messages.
can anyone tell me if it is possible to retrieve my files from the old harddrive and if so how.
also, please don't refer me to dell.
they have already made it clear that it's my problem , not theirs.
thanks.
