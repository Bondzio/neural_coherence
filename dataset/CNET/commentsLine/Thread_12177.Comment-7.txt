hi: just cruising through and noticed your posting: don't forget about the educational discount that apple gives if you're a student.
i wasn't sure that amazaon offers this, but it's worth the check.
you've probably already done this, but just in case.
i just bought a macbook pro, and am waiting for case-mate to release their signature suit for the 17&quot;.
it covers the macbook completely and is left on while you use your laptop.
they have these for the 13&quot; & 15&quot;macbooks and they have them in great colors.
just a thought because it protects your mb from scratches and light thumps.
