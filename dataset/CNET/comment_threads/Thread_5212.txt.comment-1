I've watched half of my new &quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot; on my home computer, which sports a Pioneer BDC-202 Blu-Ray player.
Now, however, I can read and write other disks, but the 202 has stopped recognizing Blu-Ray disks altogether!
The only updates I've made are Microsoft's -- updates I've grown increasingly wary of -- and I'm wondering if it could be the updates that are creating this problem!
Not only will my PowerDVD 8 not see it, neither can I get my system to see any content.
Indeed, it thinks there is no disk there.
Does anyone have any ideas why this might be happening?
I can't believe it's a hardware problem, but who knows?
Thanks!
John
