well i kinda seen that myself i believe it narrows down to the only 2 i see that is matx refurbished: asrock p4vm800 socket 478 via p4m800 micro atx intel motherboard - oem refurbished: biostar p4vma-m socket 478 via pm800 micro atx intel motherboard - oem td25x said to go with the biostar but why do that?
i am asking because to me i think the asrock looks better for one thing it has more usb ports on that one.
