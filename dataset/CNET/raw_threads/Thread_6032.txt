421	0	130886	1477099	NR	Cluchetti	10/15/05 6:05 AM	1.1293563E12	Graphics card question......	Hi, Can you use a SLI video card in a motherboard with only one pci express slot? The motherboard is an ASUS A8N-E (NON SLI) And if a motherboard has sli support, can you use only one card instead of the SLI?
