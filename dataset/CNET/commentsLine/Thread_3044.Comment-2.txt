what kind of errors are being noted?
if it's just crosslinked files and such, the os (what is it?)
may have a built in utility.
if it's actual bad sectors, the remedy is different or not available.
in worst cases, you can erase the drive with a utility from the manufacturer that will do a sector by sector surface analysis.
some can &quot;move&quot; unrecoverable sectors to spare ones.
this process marks bad spots so they will not be made available when you partition and format the drive.
one small program that's supposed to do miracles is called &quot;spin rite&quot;, as i recall, but it's not free and will cost as much as today's 80 gig drives.
