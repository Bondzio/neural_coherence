True single 1Tb HDs are not that plentiful yet but available.
The brand that seems to pop-up is that from Hitachi and WD while others really offer dual-500Gb setups in ready made ext.
cases and/or if you DIY.
It rally doesn't matter what HDs are out there, as all are prone to damage for whatever reason, being 1Tb isn't going to isolate it from similar damage.
I tend to lean towards WD and Seagate for typical installs, Seagate more as they have a better warranty period compared to anyone else.
Samsung is another to look for when 1Tb is made by them.
IMHO, wait for Seagate offerings if at all possible.
So far, I haven't heard any horror stories, but I don't fix a zillion HD problems neither.
