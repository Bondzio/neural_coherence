when i search through the web i always see ddr memory with some numbers assigned to them.
for instance, 256mb ddr memory pc3200 400mhz or pc2700 333mhz.
as far as i know even the motherboards supporting 333mhz can work with 400mhz memory but in this case the memories will function at 333mhz thus, buying memories at a higher-than-supported speed becomes useless.
how can i understand whether my motherboard supports 400mhz ddr memory?
