i'm betting most people wouldn't use it, because front row is somewhat of a joke when it comes to genuine htpc-style use... so it's perhaps used as a 'look how cool this is' feature for the first two months and then cast aside by most.
there is also a design issue as well, in that it's almost shaped like an expresscard remote but isn't.
(you can now get apple remote clones which fit into the expresscard slot) the remotes of my xps m's click into the card slot so it's just the thing to take away along with the notebook so i can enjoy vista media center on the move.
so with the apple remotes, you kind of have to find a place to put it which isn't on the notebook and that's kind of inelegant.
the remote is not what i thought was janky.
it is kind of superfluous, although given apple's mumblings towards 'digital hub' i guess a media remote wouldn't be too much to ask.
however since their htpc attempt isn't a serious offering, i guess it *is* too much to ask.
but i digress.
the omission of the remote isn't janky.
the ethernet dongle for the air?
now that's janky.
