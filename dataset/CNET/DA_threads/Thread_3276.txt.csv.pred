1.1.1	I have been considering to buy a netbook for basic applications like -web browsing -downloading stuff ( download a lot of movies ) -watching movies and listening to music -typing and editing documents I am considering Dell Mini , Sony Vaoi VPCM126AG/P and HP Mini 210series My prime concerns are : -Would a netbook be able to pull maximum internet speeds ?	Ques
1.1.2	I am currently using a broadband internet connection of 1Mbps .	St
1.1.3	-How much of multitasking can it handle ?	Ques
1.1.4	For instance how comfortably can it pull web browsing ( with multiple tabs on ) , editing documents , a download in progress while a movie is running simultaneously ?	Ques
1.1.5	-Could you name a few softwares that are likely to bringdown its performance , the ones I better steer clear of..	St
1.1.6	Please help me decide if netbook is a good choice at all Thanks a ton !	St

1.2.1	Netbooks are fine but you describe using one just like a full sized laptop .	St
1.2.2	Given a full sized laptop is the same or not much more price why would you sacrifice your hands and eyes to a netbook ?	Ques

1.3.1	I am looking for something very light and portable ...	St
1.4.1	Something like the old Gateway ex1440u .	St
1.4.2	It 's one step up and away from a netbook and what I use on travel when I do n't have to do much .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	NETBOOKS HAVE THEIR PLACE ... .THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO 'REPLACE ' AN UPSCALE LAPTOP ... .I HAVE ONE I USE WHEN TRAVELLING , THEY ARE EASILY CARRIED AT AIRPORTS , CAN ACCESS WIFI WHILE WAITING ... .ALSO USE IN HOTEL ROOM TO CHECK EMAIL , LOOK UP STUFF ON WEB , ETC .	St
1.5.2	... A NETBOOK IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE FOR LONG CORRESPONDENCE , LENGTHY EMAILS , ETC ...	St
1.5.3	The thing to look for in a Netbook is to be sure it is upgradeable to 2 GB !	St
1.5.4	! , thats the first thing I did .	St
1.5.5	Makes 100 % difference in performance .	St
1.5.6	The other thing is the KEYBOARD , there are differences in how far the keys are apart/spaced ... which helps in input .	St
1.5.7	Other wise , Dell , H.P. , ACER , whatever , are all about the same ... You could say its a difference between a loaded larger laptop , and a PDA or an email/net capable Cellphone ... .Bottom Line again is , what are you going to use it for ? ? ?	Ques

1.6.1	I 'm with Bob on this one , you can pick up a full function notebook that is n't dramatically heavier or much more expensive than a netbook and get a better screen for watching Movies and a more capable multi-threading processor ( Intel Core , rather than Atom ) .	St
1.6.2	Your specific questions : Will a netbook handle maximum internet sppeds ?	Ques
1.6.3	Probably not but it will have no problem at all with your 1 Mbps .	St
1.6.4	How much multitasking can it handle ?	Ques
1.6.5	Your list looks too heavy to me - you 'd be much better off with an Intel Core processor than an Atom that sacrifices performance for lighter weight ( of the whole unit ) and battery life .	St
1.7.1	I am trying out an Acer Aspire with 1G RAM & 250G memory .	St
1.7.2	It is very , very slow ; the touchpad is very skittish no matter how I adjust it ; and it simple is not powerful enough to have multiple screens open .	St
1.7.3	I 'm extremely disappointed and am returning it ( I purchased on a TV shopping channel that gives me that ability to return with no restocking fee ) .	St
1.7.4	But , I do like the portability and long battery life .	St
1.7.5	There is an HP Pavilion DM1Z that has an 11.6 & quot ; screen , 3G RAM , 320G hard drive , and you can select a Turion dual core processor for about $ 525 .	St
1.7.6	It only weighs in at 3.25 lbs .	St
1.7.7	according to specs .	St
1.7.8	I 'm seriously considering this purchase since I would be able to multi-task , not be so frustrated by slowness , and still have portability .	St
