hi, i was thinking of buying a good mouse.
i would usually use it for portable use with macbook.
any mouse is okay, as long as you don't need a power socket.
i have big hands so ergonomics counts alot.
i also care about the features of the mouse too!
my choices so far: microsoft arc mouse microsoft explorer/ explorer mini logitech vx nano you guys are welcome to give more suggestions.
i mainly want to see the other people's opinions about these mice and any problems that may have arisen after usage, since i don't want to encounter the problems with a mouse after i buy it.
thanks alot
