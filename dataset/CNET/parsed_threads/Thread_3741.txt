<s> There are 3 display options for my monitor: 1:1, Aspect and Full. </s>
<s> I have a 24 inch BenQ monitor with a 1920 x 1200 native resolution. </s>
<s> When using my monitor for my computer, nothing changes when I switch between these 3 options and I'm not too concerned about when I use my computer on the monitor anyway. </s>
<s> I have Xbox 360 and PS3 consoles hooked up to the monitor via HDMI cables and these 3 options result in 3 different results and I'm not sure which to use: 1) 1:1 makes the image a small but crisp box inside the monitor (about half of the total monitor screen is used). </s>
<s> 2) Aspect creates small horizontal black bars at the top and bottom of the screen (i.e. </s>
<s> letterbox / widescreen look) 3) Full fills the whole screen up I don't car for 1:1 mode because it only uses half the monitor real estate. </s>
<s> My guess is that Aspect (with the bars on the top and bottom) is the nature regular look and Full stretches the picture up and down a bit to get rid of the bars to fill the screen. </s>
<s> I can't notice any distortion in Full mode (but this is probably just because the bars in Aspect aren't to big so there isn't much distortion to stretch the screen to Full). </s>
<s> If this is correct, I think I will stick with Aspect mode as I don't want any distortion/stretching. </s>
<s> Is this correct and what mode should I use? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> You've already answered your own question in raw results. </s>
<s> You understand what these options ply to your current setup. </s>
<s> Now, pick one that makes you happy. </s>
<s> Then understand should your needs change or setup differ later you have the flexibility/capability to adapt to that. </s>
<s> enjoy tada -----Willy </s>
<s> the reason it's half the size is because the video resolution of what you saw was 1/2 of the natural screen resolution. </s>
<s> But if you were to watch a 1080P video, then it would've been full screen (or very close to it). </s>
<s> Yes I think aspect is a good choice. </s>
