<s> picked up a new motherboard 4 20$ yay for me lol. </s>
<s> I wanted it because it works, was cheap, but mainly because it can hold up to 4GB of RAM. </s>
<s> I'm not a pro at this but I love my games. </s>
<s> The only problem is that it has 5 PCI slot 1 AGU and No PCI-E slots. </s>
<s> Can any one name a few of the best card I can fit in a PCI slot? </s>
<s> And or AGU. </s>
<s> PS. </s>
<s> Under 200$ would help this poor boy </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Newegg.com to see what AGP cards may be had for under 200 bucks. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Armed with that list I head to tomshardware.com and see how each card fares on the VGAcharts. </s>
<s> Just so you know, I won't do this for you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ''AGU'' slot? </s>
<s> I think you mean ''AGP.'' </s>
<s> What is the manufacturer name and model name of your motherboard? </s>
<s> What are the rest of the components in your computer build? </s>
<s> You won't use more than 2GB of RAM for gaming, so getting a 4GB motherboard is not an issue. </s>
<s> If you pay more for a motherboard with a PCI Express X16 expansion slot, you likely can get a more powerful PCI Express X16 video card for a price less than a comparable AGP video card. </s>
<s> thanks for the links very helpful </s>
