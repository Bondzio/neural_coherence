and raid requires two matching drives.
i maybe wrong but i think your trying to copy the small drive to the large.
nope.
you'll need to back up your data to cd, dvd or usb from the small drive then reinstall the os to the new drive then reformat the small drive ntfs and use it as a slave to the larger drive.
making sure you get the jumpers/shunts right.
you could try this but i found it wanting.
