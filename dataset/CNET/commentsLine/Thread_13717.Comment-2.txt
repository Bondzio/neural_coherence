it is one long paragraph so while it would be nice to know the make and model i may have missed it because of that long paragraph.
let me share a laptop i own had a similar issue.
i cured it by using a powered usb 2.0 hub inbetween the pc and the drive.
now it boots up fine.
if you get a random reboot, check your laptop's maker for &quot;motherboard&quot; drivers.
