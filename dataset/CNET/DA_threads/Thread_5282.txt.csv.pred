1.1.1	I have a desktop connected to the router via cable and a laptop connected wireless, both connect to Internet without a problem, but there is no way to get any of the computers to see each other.	St
1.1.2	Desktop runs XP PRO SP2, laptop XP Home SP2, both run Zonealarm, Windows Firewall is disabled in both.	St
1.1.3	Router was updated to the last Firmware.	St
1.1.4	Both are defined as Workgroup MSHOME, with different names.	St
1.1.5	Any help, please?	St
1.1.6	Raul.	St
1.2.1	knock down a network when file and print sharing is not checked on the Exceptions tab.	St
1.2.2	Take a look.	St
1.3.1	I had to call them a few times on issues with the same router and they were most helpful on set up; not so quick on dropped conenction, but they eventually got that resolved.	St
1.3.2	I am currently running about the same thing except 2 desktops and 1 laptop.	St
1.4.1	He has XP firewall disabled.	St
1.4.2	In fact, I can enable it and Zone Alarm will disable it.	St
1.5.1	Hears how to solve the problem: 1) Double Click on the Zonealarm icon on the system tray in the lower right corner of your screen 2)In the zonealarm window, click the Firewall tab on the left hand side 3)Under trusted zone security, ensure that the slider is set to medium 4)Click on the zones tab near the top right hand corner 5) You will see information on your network adapter, what ip address the router assigned the entry type, and the zone 6)Click once on what the zone is listed on for your network card and click trusted.	St
1.5.2	Then you can share and see both the computers.	St
1.5.3	By setting the network type to trusted, this will protect your computer from malicious attacks, but allow you to see the computer and share files, printers, etc.	St
1.5.4	Like you, I have a linksys wrt54g and the firewall included in the router does an excellent job so setting your zonealarm setting to trusted does not compromise your data at all.	St
1.5.5	Hopefully this will work T. Ward	St
1.6.1	I checked my settings and they had defaukted to your recommendation.	St
1.6.2	I did notice that the ip address Zone Alarm shows is slightly different than what Linksys shows.	St
1.6.3	Linksys shows XXX.XXX.X.1, but ZA shows XXX.XXX.X.0.	St
1.6.4	I cannot edit or delete the settings.	St
1.6.5	I appear to be OK, but should I do more to change the settings?	St
1.7.1	Thank you very much for the information, it works great.	St
1.7.2	After setting the card zone to Trusted, I'm able to connect the two computers together.	St
1.7.3	Thank you again.	Polite
1.7.4	Raul.	St
1.8.1	NIL	St
