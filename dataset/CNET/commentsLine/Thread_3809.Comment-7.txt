that's why the extra 100w comes into play plus anything left over is the room to grow.
as i stated, if the rated value of the psu is 550w, then the real dependable amount is 82% of that.

i tend to buy antec and if generic go into the large wattage units.
thermolake has some offerings too.
newegg is a good source and if they offer it, i tend to feel comfortable buying from them.
