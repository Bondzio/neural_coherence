<s> Right, so I'm attempting to make a profit on a budget gaming PC build. </s>
<s> I buy the parts, put it together and then sell it. </s>
<s> I'm going to post the specifications, and how much I paid for the parts, and I'm wondering how much you would be willing to pay for said computer. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> AMD Athlon II x3 450 Triple Core CPU 2. </s>
<s> 450W Power Supply (Triple Rail) 3. </s>
<s> Ultra Mid Tower Chassis 4. </s>
<s> Gigabyte 760g mATX Motherboard 5. </s>
<s> 500GB 7200RPM SATA HDD 6. </s>
<s> AMD Radeon HD 6750 1GB 7. </s>
<s> 2x4GB DDR3 1333MHz RAM Dual Channel - Optical Drive - Extra Case Fan This is just an idea. </s>
<s> Please don't be too harsh. </s>
<s> Instead of telling me about the mistakes and leaving, give me constructive criticism and tell me what I should replace it with. </s>
<s> This build will cost around $320, and I would like to sell it for more. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help! </s>

<s> It's a little light and no OS so you are unlikely to get a good price above the part costs. </s>
<s> The OS alone is worth a bit as a great install with recovery media is worth hundreds on its own. </s>
<s> But I have encountered those that build PCs that can't wrap their head around this area. </s>
<s> That is, they think nothing of installing Windows but we are solidly into the consumer age. </s>
<s> If they machine is not ready to use and can not be recovered without a guru or hundreds at a service counter it's just another clone. </s>
<s> Clones are plentiful and cheap. </s>
<s> How will you make this unit stand out and not be yet another Ebay clone? </s>

<s> The best I can do is include a trial operating system such as Windows 7 Home Premium. </s>
<s> I can't afford to spend $100 on an operating system. </s>
<s> I also include all of the warranties that come with the parts. </s>
<s> Other than that, I can't imagine doing anything to make it stand out and be more worthy. </s>
<s> Do you have any suggestions? </s>
<s> It's not ready to put to work so where's the value added beyond you bolting together parts? </s>
<s> -&gt; Let me tip my hand a little. </s>
<s> I have friends in this industry and those the didn't exit the desktop marker were deeply hurt later. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> When outfits.....think Dell etc....are buying their parts by the train load.....think 20/30/40% less than your cost and can't make any money building desktops.......how did you plan on doing it? </s>
<s> Build one......test it.......float it out on the market for 400 bucks. </s>
<s> Should not take very long to see if there is any demand. </s>
<s> You could not sell that machine to me but I doubt I fit your target audience. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
