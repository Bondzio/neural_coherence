<s> I installed an Asus A7V8X motherboard, with Via KT400 chipset, about a year ago and have just realised that I only have USB 1.1 and it should be USB 2. </s>
<s> The Via CD provided with the motherboard won't allow me to download the USB 2 driver. </s>
<s> Their website says they cannot provide a download because of licence agreements with Microsoft. </s>
<s> Microsoft say the download is on service pack 1, but as I have service pack 2 installed, it won't allow me to download SP1. </s>
<s> I can't seem to find a USB 2 download on SP 2. </s>
<s> The Asus website doesn't seem to mention USB 2. </s>
<s> Where on earth can I get a driver to allow me to upgrade to USB 2? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The place that supplied the board will make good. </s>
<s> 2. Review http://www.usbman.com bob </s>
<s> Thanks, R. Proffitt. </s>
<s> www.usbman.com is great. </s>
<s> I've got USB 2 on one of my connectors for my camera (the most important). </s>
<s> Just need to figure out how to get it on the others connectors. </s>
