...but what i'm getting from other sources is that the issue may be more the psu than it is the card.
the mobo has also been denigrated to a lesser extent, but based on what i am able to do with the comp without the nvidia drivers loaded, i'm inclined to think the mobo will do--for now, at least the seller says the card worked perfectly when he sent the computer, and i have no reason to disbelieve him.
he has been unhesitating in his willingness to refund the cost of the card so i can order one locally; i'd rather not send the entire computer back.
i fully expect that he would have not problem replacing the psu if that turns out to be the real issue.
my inclination at this point is to replace the psu first and go from there.
at this point, i am not looking for anything insanely fancy.
that can come later.
after all the comments from various sources, all i want right now is a psu that is better than the one that currently is in the box.
if it turns out that the video card is still an issue, then i would like to get a replacement that is a bit better than the one supplied, since it is, i am discovering, is somewhat old, manufacture-date-wise.
any suggestions, fairly specific, would be greatly appreciated.
