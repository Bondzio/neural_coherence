To get your 2 routers to talk they either both need a feature called bridging or the non internet router need to have a feature that lets you run in client mode. In either case the non internet router will not be running in AP mode so you don't have to worry about your PC. Even if were to run both routers in the default AP mode and hook them together with a cable you could always use SSID to control which you PC attached to.
