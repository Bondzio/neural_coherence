The first thing I did was call for help and got to an Indian call center.
I ended up getting someone who claimed to be the supervisor, she wasn't much help and ended up hanging up on me....it needs to be said though that it wasn't me raising my voice, I can only assume that she had no other answers.
Her final answer before hanging up was to upgrade to vista, your computer is old.
I have connected using the ethernet connection now, it will do until I can update my wireless drivers, that is what seems to be wrong
