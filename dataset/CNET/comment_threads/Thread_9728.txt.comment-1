yes i know that the macbookpro is cool and everything.
but the powerbooks are awesome and i dont want to see them get replaced.
Maybe if they were to make a macbookpro 17in for the same price as the 17inch powerbook then it'd be okay but if they cant do that then they should just put the intel into the powerbook and call it even, although having a camera and frontrow would be nice, wouldnt it?
