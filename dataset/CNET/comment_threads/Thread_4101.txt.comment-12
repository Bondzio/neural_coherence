At http://www.asus.com/999/download/products/1163/1163_10.pdf I can't find the ram you purchased.
This means we have to manually make sure the settings are spot on.
Go get CPUID from http://www.softpedia.com/reviews/windows/Cpu-Z-Review-38137.shtml Share the screen shot like this one -&gt; http://news.softpedia.com/images/reviews/large/CPU-Z_04large.png and http://news.softpedia.com/images/reviews/large/CPU-Z_05large.png on photobucket.
Supply all if possible.
Your board?

I see a simple choice here.
Use RAM from the QVL or dive in and ask them for the settings.
I see the settings but don't post them here since I want you to tell.
