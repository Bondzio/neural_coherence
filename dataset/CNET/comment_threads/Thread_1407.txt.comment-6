The machine has the Apache web server running and more than usual.
I asked about the nameserver entry since it's an odd entry.
-&gt; Take time to understand each line of your long post and if you don't, consider why it's running or installed.
As to the indexing service, it must be one of the first services that many disable in a quest to quiet a busy machine.
As to the DMA issue, it's a simple procedure that doesn't require a reboot.
Just my impression is that the machine looks like some developer loaded it up with everything and needs to curb the activity a little.
