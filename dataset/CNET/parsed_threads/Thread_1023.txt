<s> Hello all, I currently have a dilemma. </s>
<s> I currently have an HP Pavilion a6700f Desktop PC that I use for recording music. </s>
<s> I use the computer program Pro tools 8, but I am trying to make my machine efficient enough to handle the newest version of Protools. </s>
<s> Now it doesn't do badly, but for the amount of music I am currently doing I need it to function at an optimal level hence I am interested in doing some upgrades. </s>
<s> I am new at trying to upgrade computers because usually when they become obsolete I scrap them to get another model, but my music partner told me it may be more cost efficient simply to upgrade my machine. </s>
<s> So my questions are what component can I upgrade without having to buy a new computer case. </s>
<s> Would I be able to change the motherboard so I can have a faster processor and store more memory? </s>
<s> What kind of power supply can fit in my model of HP? </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be very helpful. </s>
<s> Below are my computer specs, thank you ahead of time. </s>
<s> HP Pavilion a6700f Desktop PC Motherboard: MCP61PM-HM (Nettle3) Processor: Phenom X4 9150e Memory: 4gb Hard drive: 500 gb Power Supply 300W Windows Vista </s>
<s> Right now you are rapidly reaching that point of upgrading would be more cost effective. </s>
<s> Specifically your CPU is 1.8GHz so to upgrade your CPU you are looking at a couple hundred $$. </s>
<s> RAM is almost always, more is better if you have a 64bit OS, if your OS is 32bit you have reached your limit. </s>
<s> You might get a SSD drive those are fast but the price is still pretty high. </s>
<s> Looking on New Egg I found machines that would be an upgrade for the sub 500 range. </s>
<s> Of course you could pay a bit more and get something more. </s>
<s> Hope this helped. </s>
<s> Unless a member who is using the app comes on the boards the rest of us are left guessing. </s>
<s> HP says your machine has vista/64. </s>
<s> I could tell you to add ram.....won't hurt anything.....but if your not using all the 4GB won't be of much value. </s>
<s> Ram&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2x2GB.......50 bucks. </s>
<s> Your machine has integrate video. </s>
<s> Avid suggest a dedicated video card. </s>
<s> Gpu &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;HD4550/5450.......50 bucks. </s>
<s> You might want to spend a little time with Task Manager and Perf Monitor......Windows tools. </s>
<s> You don't have to become a wizard with these tools just a basic understanding will let you spot where the machine needs a little help. </s>
