ok, this has been a lingering problem.
i have wireless on my computer.
the problem is that everytime i open ie, i get that its not connecting to internet message.
it gives me an option of running the windows diagnostic, which i do.
it usually works, then i can get online.
sometimes i have to run it a few times before i can get online.
any suggestions?
