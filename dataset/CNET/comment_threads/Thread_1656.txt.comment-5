Considering the number of computers needed and the nature of how they will be used, your best bet is to get them built by a large maker where you will be able to have Tech Support and get broken machines replaced quickly.
I would call Dell and HP and tell them what you need and ask for a quote.
If you want, you can do the same with a local computer store and compare what they offer.
