Sorry! Anyways.....I have some basic questions concerning the WGR614v6. Thanks. On the Netgear router, is the internet symbol supposed to be on all the time and not flashing? Im not really having any issues getting online, but I noticed that this symbol blinks rapidly all the time and does not stay constantly on. Also, I just noticed my wireless logo is going in and out but Im still connected and have not been dropped. It stays on when Im not online, but when I open a web page it flickers as well. Also another annoyance which the support people could not figure out is that Im constantly at a Good 60% connection. When I move around or switch rooms my signal does not move up or down the 60% connection. I can be inches away or yards away and it stays at the 60% mark. I have no cordless phones but I do have a baby monitor. However, I turned that off and Im still at 60%. Again I dont have any drop issues but would like to have the best possible connection. Any ideas? I use Comcast and a D-Link modem. Lenovo 3000 N Series Notebook with Intel Centrino Duo Mobile Technology Vista Business Thanks. Mark

Second thing, the wireless router you have, go to their website and download and install the latest firmware. Most routers come with out dated firmware. The latest firmware helps to keep you connected. Third thing, set up WPA security for your wireless router. This also helps to keep you connected and keeps leaches off your internet connection. Rick

Read http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6132_102-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=242736&messageID=2457489 Or you can skip to the end and read my advice. 1. Use WPA 2. NEVER disable SSID broadcast. About 100% links. So far there is no technology that does that except wired connections. It is normal to get less than 100%. Bob
