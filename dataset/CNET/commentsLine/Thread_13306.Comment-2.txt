for personal computers, mostly they are for future use.
off the top of my head: x1 = video cards; network adapters; hdd/raid controllers; usb, firewire and serial cards.
x4, x8 = hdd/raid controllers.
i just googled for pci express sound cards and tv tuners and came up with a few hits.
hmm...i didn't know about those!
