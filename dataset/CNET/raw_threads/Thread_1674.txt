Machine is Packard Bell Ixtreme 6050 with original Maxtor Falcon - Diamond Max 16 80GB HDD. problem is that I get 3 or 4 reboots on startup every time, with a stop code of 24 (Invalid/Corrupt NTFS.sys). and I can't boot to the windows recovery console (Read Error has occurred on Drive C.) Packard Bell's HDD Diagnostic software (re-branded SEAGATE) says the drive is fine. The problems first appeared when the Motherboard (Gigabyte GA-8SIML-NF6 Ver 2.0) failed and was replaced under warranty. I've already done one reinstall of Windows (XP Home/SP2 pathed up to date. I run AVG Free/AVG Anti-Spyware and Anti-rootkit plus Spybot S&D) without fixing the problem. What diagnostic software would you recommend that may shed more light on the problem. I'm tempted to just replace the hard drive, but as the machine is still under warranty, I'd like to prove exactly where the fault is and get it fixed under the warranty.
