it was hit and miss for me.
worked sometimes, not others.
xp or vista didn't seem to matter.
sound quality was hit and miss, too.
a few months into service, the voicemail stopped working.
if i didn't answer, the caller would get a voice that said &quot;goodbye&quot;... click!
they never did get it working.
when it came time to re-up for another year, i trashed it.
