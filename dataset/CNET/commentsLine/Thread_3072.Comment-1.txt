i have recently moved to a new apartment, prior to moving i could run the video game i play primarily at all very high settings and get a static 75fps.
now i get 30 or less than that and i'm on low settings.
the conditions of the transport of my pc were as follows: wedged between back seat on ground, stable, my ac was on full blast and the windows were foggy upon leaving vehicle, was around a 30 minute drive.
could the moisture of the ac have potentially shorted something?
i've ran chkdsk, no bad sectors.
ran prime95 for processor and memtest for ram.
any suggestions?
i'm very frustrated.
any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
thank you.
