i recently purchased a dell 9100 notebook computer and this baby is hot.
i'm talking about the temperature.
i was looking around for a notebook cooling system but the computer seems to be too wide to fit any of them.
know of any cooling platforms that would fit under this dell or any other solution to keeping the thing from melting the veneer off my desk?
