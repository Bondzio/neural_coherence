1.1.1	Anyone know if it is possible to run your computer into your stereo similar to a CD player , etc .	St
1.1.2	I would like to be able to run my computer through it so I could listen to my audio files out of my stereo throughout the house .	St
1.1.3	Thanks for all the great insight on this board .	Polite
1.2.1	Ca n't remember the name of the cable , has a headphone jack on one end , red and white RCA jacks on the other .	St
1.2.2	Connect the headphone jack into the speaker out from your PC and the red and white RCA jacks into one of the AUX inputs on your stereo .	St
1.3.1	You would use the & quot ; line out & quot ; connection .	St
1.3.2	As mentioned , you will need one that splits the signal into the two channels .	St
1.3.3	Radio Shack probably has such .	St
1.3.4	However , you will have some problems if the cable is of much length .	St
1.3.5	The longer it needs to run , the more likely it will pick up noise and especially 60 cycle hum .	St
1.3.6	Impedance match is important so check to be sure your line out and auxillary ports match in this category .	St
1.3.7	Get high quality ( cost more ) cables if you go further than 6 to 10 feet .	St
1.4.1	If your stereo has input in the form of typical audio input ( The red and white holes ) you can go to radio shack and pick up a cable that has the headphone size plug on one end and the red and white ends on the other .	St
1.4.2	I think this would be the most basic of all the solutions .	St
1.5.1	Good of you to repeat what has already been said .	St
