<s> I have a p4 processor running @ 2.8 ghz and I want to overclock it to atleast 3ghz. </s>
<s> I looked in my bios and it does not give an option for multiplying the speed. </s>
<s> I was wondering if there is any software or a way I could overclock the processor. </s>
<s> I have an intel mobo. </s>
<s> Thanks Billy </s>
<s> With an intel mobo, very likely...no chance. </s>

<s> if its like an hp computer or dell, well duh u cant overclock. </s>
<s> NO there are no utilitys out there. </s>
<s> if you bought a new mobo yah, you could overclock an intel cpu. </s>
<s> you just have to find the right one. </s>
