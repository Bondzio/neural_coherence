John, I just lubed the whining fan in my GeForce FX5200.
That may take care of it for a while but I'd like to know what fan you purchased to replace the one on your card.
My fan is located in a rectangular aluminum heat sink with a circular opening in the middle for the 1.5'' (38mm) fan.
I know it's been quite some time since your post but any assistance would be appreciated.
David
