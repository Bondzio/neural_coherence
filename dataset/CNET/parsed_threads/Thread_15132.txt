<s> I have recently bought a Western Digital 40Gig drive and I need to have it ghosted from a smaller drive which is 9Gig. </s>
<s> Would it b possible to ghost the contents of a smaller drive onto a bigger drive, will it mess up because of partitions or what. </s>
<s> I need to know if this will work ASAP. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> That's the best way to do it, usually a smaller HD to larger HD or of same size for less hassles. </s>
<s> YOu can slso ghost to partitions once to point them out and agin, the partition size should be equal or larger than the source. </s>
<s> Using the simplst defaults, ghosting once the HDs/partitions are ready just point out out source and destination and let it fly. </s>
<s> I hope this helps... good luck -----Willy </s>
