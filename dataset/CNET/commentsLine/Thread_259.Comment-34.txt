the problem as i see it is that your machines cd/dvd drives are nonfunctional.
the reply with the try this!!!
is what should do the trick.
it's a common problem with that fix and then to restore cd/dvd recording we uninstall reinstall the cd/dvd recording software.
unless you didn't want to fix the problem i can't see where you are going.
