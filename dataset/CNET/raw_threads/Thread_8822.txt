LTD......MS-6577 Proccesor: celeron 2.4ghz RAM DIMM1: Elpida EBD52UC8AAFA-7B 512 MB PC2100 DDR SDRAM (2.5-3-3-6 @ 133 MHz) (2.0-2-2-5 @ 100 MHz) DIMM2: Micron Tech. 8VDDT3264AG-335C4 256 MB PC2700 DDR SDRAM (2.5-3-3-7 @ 166 MHz) (2.0-3-3-6 @ 133 MHz) Graphics card: NVIDIA GeForce FX 5500 (256 MB) ok so i got 768mb of ram running at the speeds above, i recently brought a 1gb pc2700 stick to upgrade and put along side the 512mb pc2100 stick i allready have. now i added the 1gb stick and i got the beeping noise that lasts for 5 seconds(2 second interval) now to my knowledge this is a memory error but on the msi website(the maker of my moterboard) it says that pc2700 is compatible! the only other thing i could think of is the high and low density compatibility issue?????? IS MY MOTHERBOARD HIGH DENSITY RAM COMPATIBLE??? the new ram i brought is high density, could this be the problem??? also the 1gb ram boots up along side the 512mb ram in the 1 slot (BUT NOT THE OTHER WAY ROUND) and shows up as 7968MB!!!!! BUT THEN NONE OF THE RAM WORKS AND USES THE MOTHER BOARD RAM OF 32MB

PROPER!	http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&docname=c00100539 I see this and crucial noting you can installl 2 (two) 512MB sticks for a total of 1GB. This is no offer to detail why 1GB sticks show up as 1/4 or 1/2 size. They should and do. -&gt; But about the stick order. That would take a too long discussion about chip selects and circuit design. It's a common issue and why we stick with supported sticks on the list. Bob

Your stick could have the wrong ORGANIZATION of memory (there is a LONG discussion about high, low density as well as double sided versus single sided). It's very simple. What you have is not compatible. I've seen people sit and fuss over this for years. All I can hope for is they get past it and go get the right part. Just because it fits or your motherboard notes 1GB sticks does not mean all 1GB sticks work. Some will, some don't. Your move, Bob

No0t so with just the MB. http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product?product=3264373&lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us Adding RAM to an older PC...I'd recommend going to Crucial.com VAPCMD
10521	9	350073	3082972	3081859	VAPCMD	7/16/09 6:20 PM	1.2477684E12	Most often it's best to identify a PC by mfg name, series	and model number. When you give only the MB model number and revision and that MB is used in more than one model, then you're never sure which system docs to look at for reference. This was the clue to finding the complete product docs ....'hp pavilion a309.uk' If the PC is a clone...then the MB mfg name, model number and revision is the reference information needed. You can also use this info at Crucial.com to find compatible RAM for your system. VAPCMD
