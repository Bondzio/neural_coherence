Perhaps this will make your choice a little clearer - I am in the exact same situation as you (though waiting for Nehalem to come out) and bought the 3850 AGP.
Big mistake.
Ati/AMD DOES NOT offer driver support for these AGP cards.
It took me about a week to get the card to work (I still have no sound b/c of some driver incompatibility).
If I were you I would save your money (and a giant migrane) and wait until next gen CPUs come out.
If you really must upgrade, do yourself a favor and get a 7XXX nVidia card.
STAY AWAY from 3850 AGP.
