Well, I currently have a broken COMPAQ Presario from '04 that is broken, and HP is making very little progress in helping me, so if worse comes to worse, I was thinking of what computer I should get.
I am on a budget of about $650.
I would like a good built in GFX card, that would be able to play games like StarCraft II, Team Fortress 2, and Mirror's Edge well.
I'd also like it to be able to run Phot editing software well.
(GIMP, PSE7, etc) I'll post more detail, but I think thats about it.
Oh.
I'm Canadian, so keep that in mind for Companies and Prices.
