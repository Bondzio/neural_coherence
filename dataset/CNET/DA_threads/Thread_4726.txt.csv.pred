1.1.1	I 'm getting ready to buy a new video card .	St
1.1.2	In the specs it states the resolutions and the refresh rates ( i.e .	St
1.1.3	800x600 70Hz - 1028x720 75Hz etc .	St
1.1.4	) for the card .	St
1.1.5	While looking at my monitors manual I also noticed that it included these same numbers ( resolutions-refresh rates ) and that the refresh rates for the same settings were different .	St
1.1.6	My question is - which of the two ( video card or monitor ) determines the refresh rate you see on the screen ?	Ques
1.1.7	or how does this work ?	Ques
1.2.1	It 's very simple .	St
1.2.2	Whichever is slower and smallest is what you get to use of the two devices .	St
1.2.3	Example .	St
1.2.4	At 800x600 , your card says it will do 100 Hz refresh .	St
1.2.5	Your monitor says 75 Hz .	St
1.2.6	You 'll use 75 or less Hz .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	Does the operating system have any effect on this ?	Ques
1.3.2	Because I was using win98 and the refresh rate was 56 Hz .	St
1.3.3	I swapped out the hard drive to one with XP on it and the refresh rate jumped up to 75 Hz .	St
1.3.4	Is this normal ?	Ques
1.4.1	OS ?	Ques
1.4.2	No .	St
1.4.3	It 's all about the drivers .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	My video card is set to 800x600 and my monitor shows that the refresh rate is 35 Khz/ 56 Hz .	St
1.5.2	Is there any way that I can get a higher refresh rate ?	Ques
1.5.3	Is n't this better for the eyes ( less strain ) ?	Ques
1.6.1	Just a thought .	St
1.6.2	If I r/c a blank area of the desktop and select properties it brings me to a screen that applies to my vid card .	St
1.6.3	If I go through the tabs on that screen I get to a screen that allows me to select refresh rate .	St
1.6.4	In my case it is set to default which gives me a rate slightly higher than yours .	St
1.6.5	I have tested higher rates and for my use I do not see a diff , perhaps gamers play with this stuff .	St
