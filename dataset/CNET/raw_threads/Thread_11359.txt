Here is the spec: Inter core I5 CPU 650 @ 3.2 GHz Ram: 6.00 GB system: 64-bit op. sys Display adapter: Intel HD drivers And I believe this link shows the spec that is provided by HP: http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?objectID=c02532954&lang=en&cc=us&taskId=101&contentType=SupportFAQ&prodSeriesId=4269976&prodTypeId=12454 I hope to get some recommendations on video cards I should get in order to play a game like Tera or WoW with a good graphic quality. If I have to change the power supply, please recommend me the power as well. Thank you!
