I am not an attorney so this is just one users opinion; consider the facts. Large corporations enter into business agreements which exclude competition by agreeing to supply product 'as needed' i.e., you get yours' first. Sounds good, however, these 'agreements' can lead to very unsavory business practices. For instance: Go out and obtain the retail price a 'single' Intel processor. The cost exceeds the sale PRICE of a widely advertised computer. How can this be possible?? Certainly not a volume thing. How about the following scenario: Supplier to manufacturer &quot;How would you like to get 'x' thousand of these processors at this VERY low price&quot;? &quot;You could really sell a lot of product and make it very hard on your competition&quot; I believe that this is called 'dumping' and is frowned upon universally. Who do I support?? AMD; they have a better product and are being squashed by a bigger company. Sound familiar -- how about Apple and that little company up north??
