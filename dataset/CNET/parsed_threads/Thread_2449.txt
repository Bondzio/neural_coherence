<s> Hi, This started last night. </s>
<s> I wanted to copy some files to a CD, but the program told me I had none. </s>
<s> After checking my computer, I saw that my drive was not listed under &quot;My Computer&quot;, and it was not working. </s>
<s> It is listed in the Device Manager with an exclamation beside it. </s>
<s> In the Properties for the drive, it said the drivers were either missing or corrupt. </s>
<s> I have tried installing them, but it says the ones I have are the most recent. </s>
<s> I tried uninstalling and reinstalling. </s>
<s> No change. </s>
<s> I checked my BIOS, but saw nothing unusual there. </s>
<s> The drive is listed. </s>
<s> When I put a CD in, the light starts flashing, and it does sound like it is turning. </s>
<s> But I cannot access anything on it. </s>
<s> What could I try next? </s>
<s> Or is the drive damaged? </s>
<s> Take care! </s>

<s> Check device manager&gt;properties&gt;resources&gt; change memory resources to an empty one. </s>
<s> Sorry, but I can't find any &quot;resource&quot; in my device manager-properties. </s>

<s> I'm guessing that this PC is a couple of years old. </s>
<s> You DVD has died it's time for a new one. </s>
<s> A new DVD burner is $50 at newegg.com John </s>
<s> Thanks for replying. </s>
<s> I'd be really mad if it's burned out. </s>
<s> This is on a completely new computer that I got at Christmas. </s>
<s> Like I said, the drive still spins and stuff. </s>
<s> It just seems the computer won't recognize it. </s>
<s> Well, at worst, it's still under guarantee! </s>
<s> Take care. </s>

<s> If this was my machine, I'd delete the UPPERFILTERS and LOWERFILTERS registry keys. </s>
<s> I can't find the exact article you may need (some use Roxio, some don't) but the procedure is the same regardless of the software cause. </s>
<s> Read http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=314060 </s>
<s> Call HP and get them involved. </s>
<s> That's what a warranty is for. </s>
<s> That did the trick. </s>
<s> Now I know why it happened in the first place too. </s>

<s> This is a common issue which I've witnessed people reload the OS, buy hardware and more. </s>
<s> As a favor to the forum, when you see this issue, share your experience. </s>
