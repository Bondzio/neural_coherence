<s> My Accer P4 PC abruptly quit after approx. </s>
<s> 6 months. </s>
<s> I determined that the motherboard had failed so,I purchased a new motherboard and installed it with a spare HD as the new master drive and installed the old HD in order to recover the thousands of important files and applications. </s>
<s> Problem is that Window sXP does see the &quot;old&quot; drive after it has been successfully installed on the &quot;new&quot; Hard Drive. </s>
<s> How do get my new system to see the old drive? </s>

<s> Your post is too light on details so I'll note the usual. </s>

<s> Is the hard drive containing the OS set as Master on the IDE Primary drive interface? </s>
<s> Also, you might have a problem with XP with a new motherboard. </s>
<s> If the configuration of the PC hardware is &quot;significantly different&quot; from the original setup (when XP was activated), you will have to re-activate XP. </s>
