I ran Disk Utility to verify and got the message: &quot;Volume Header needs minor repair. The volume &quot;My Mac&quot; needs to be repaired. Error: Filesystem verify or repair failed&quot; This problem started yesterday when I ran Onyx and Onyx asked me where Firefox.bin was. I then ran Disk Utility and at that time there was a problem with one file missing so I restarted with the install dvd and repaired the volume. Now when I use Disk Utility from the install dvd or TechTool, I get the message that the volume is okay but when I use Disk Utility when the startup volume is the hard drive or OnyXthe the verify fails. I have run Disk Utility when the user was &quot;Test&quot; and get the same message that the Volume Header needs minor repair. I have zapped the PRAM. At this point, I don't know what do next.Please help. Thanks Barb MacBookPro OS 10.5.8 Processor 2.33.GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Memory 2 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM

I used the 10.4 install dvd and that is what caused the problem. When I used the 10.5 install dvd, the problem was repaired and I didn't get any error messages after that.
