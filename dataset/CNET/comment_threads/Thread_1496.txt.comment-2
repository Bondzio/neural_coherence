Changing out the video cards on any Mac, with the exception of the Mac Pro, is next to impossible.
You can configure one of the new iMacs with a better video card but cannot buy one separately.
If your proposed system meets the game requirements, you should be OK.
I have no idea what the system requirements are for this game.
You could always keep the PC for playing games on and use a KVM switch with your Mac Mini and PC.
