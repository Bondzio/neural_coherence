adding ram is easy.
push back the latches where the ram chip is going.
line up notch in memory chip (ram) and push down.
sometimes it does seem tight.
pushing on one end and then the other helps get it started.
hard drive: most computers with one drive are set, telling the computer it has only one drive.
be prepared to take out your original hard drive to change the jumper telling the computer this is the main hard drive and there is a second hard drive also.
the same thing needs to be done on the second hard drive.
jumper needs to be set telling the computer that this drive is a second drive.
after changing the jumpers and plugging everything in, before putting the computer back together plug you mouse etc and turn your computer on to see if you have done everything correctly.
nothing chaps my rear end more then getting everthing put back together only to find you missed a step.
depending on who's hard drive you buy, i like to use the utility that comes with it to format the drive.
this way i can control what happens to my hard drive.
this is fun stuff.
