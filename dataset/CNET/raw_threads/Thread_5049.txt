I personally have a Geforce 9800 512 MB and it runs great, I play CODWAW, Simcity Socitites, Age of Empires III, and many other graphic heavy games and i can run all my games on max quality with no lag. (Mind you that I custom build my machine and i run 64 bit windows 7 rc) However i think that the Geforce 9500 1 GB card might be better because it has more dedicated graphics memory, and it should be able to play games for many more years to come.

Just a thought. Also, he is right on the power supply, it will probably need to be upgraded also but their not that expensive.

12487	5	357633	3120103	3119675	justin9640	9/5/09 7:50 AM	1.252137E12	Did some research	Both cards are pretty good however from the info on tigerdirect.com the 9800 card is much better. However with that said it is about 50 bucks (US) more. Read the info below.
