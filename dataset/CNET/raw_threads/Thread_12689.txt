It seems that they will not function very well when both of them are in operation, with frequent signal drops. When I use only one of them, there are no problems. What could be the problem?

I'm writing about the firmware in the router. -&gt; When posting, name names, makes, models, versions so others can chime in about such. You may be shortchanging yourself of someone that's been there with your make/models/versions. Bob
