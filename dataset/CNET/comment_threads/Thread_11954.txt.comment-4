You haven't mentioned much about the actual problem you're having.
All you say is you've plugged it in and &quot;It does not work.&quot; What is the specific problem when you try to join the Toshiba to your network's domain?
Have you even tried to tried joining it to the domain?
The government domains I've worked with require a fixed IP, meaning you'll need to turn off DHCP and maunally configure IP/DNS settings on the Toshiba.
