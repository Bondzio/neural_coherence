hi phil thanks for your reply.
i connected the pc to port 1 on a netlink 5 port ethernet switch, and connected the uplink port to the only port on the siemens gigaset se572 wlan dsl.
the wlan cannot detect the netlink.
i can get the printer networked via the netlink, no problem, but as the siemens unit has only 1 port i have to connect it directly to the pc to enable me to access the internet.
i assumed i would be able to connect as in para 1, then connect the printer to port 2 on the netlink and all would be well!!!
the software for the siemens unit is installed and working ok. again thanks for your time.
