<s> I have just recently tried to add a Netgear MR814v2 router to my system. </s>
<s> I am on a cable modem. </s>
<s> My operating system is Windows XP. </s>
<s> I have a 1.3 GZ Athalon (sp?) </s>
<s> system. </s>
<s> Everything works fine while I am hooked directly to the cable modem. </s>
<s> When I add the Router to the mix, the internet connection slows to a crawl. </s>
<s> I am connected by an ethernet cable - not wireless. </s>
<s> I have talked with the router tech people and have tried all their suggestions but nothing seems to work. </s>
<s> We can ping the sites and all seems fine but to load a page takes forever. </s>
<s> I know very little about networking or anything so any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks, Billie </s>
<s> My suggestions are: 1) Look for a firmware update 2) Try another router. </s>
