<s> Not sure if this should really be in hardware or not? </s>
<s> I was thinking about overclocking my Nvidia Geforce 5200, it has no &quot;Detect Optimal Frequinces&quot; on it so i will have to do it manuel. </s>
<s> Does anyone no a safe limit to set the core clock and memory clock frequencies to? </s>
<s> And is there anyway to check the temp of the GPU? </s>
<s> Thx </s>

<s> an easier way of doing it may be simply downloading &quot;powerstrip&quot; if you dont know what it is, it is a program used specifically for overclocking video cards. </s>
<s> it will overclock about any newer card. </s>
<s> also from personal experience i would find out what both clocks were at stock, and unless you have good gpu cooling not overclocking it over 100mhz above stock for the two diffrent clock. </s>
<s> hope this is helpful </s>
<s> Since you have a nvidia card, just google coolbits, a add-on to forceware, which lets you overclock your video card, and it also has a feature where it detects the maximum overclockability for your card, which offers you best performance and stability. </s>
<s> Give it a try! </s>
