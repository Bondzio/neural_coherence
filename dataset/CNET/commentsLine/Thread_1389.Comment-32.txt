you do not absolutely have to get a new computer.
if you are not overly worried about speed, then in order to save money, i would reccomend you just buy an internal harddrive and set up it up as a slave drive.
you should see the documentation with the new hard drive on how to do this.
anyways it is realativly simple it's just a matter of setting a jumper.
so try that instead of getting a new system.
