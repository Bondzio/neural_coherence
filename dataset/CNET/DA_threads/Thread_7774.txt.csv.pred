1.1.1	I would like to build my own PC soon and I have a few questions.	St
1.1.2	1.	St
1.1.3	Is it easier to buy a PC with the processor, I want, then upgrade from there (graphics card, RAM, etc) or is it easier to just start from the ground up.	St
1.1.4	I have some computer experience, and have changed RAM, graphics card, sound card, drives, HDD's, etc.	St
1.1.5	I don't have any experience though with fans, mother boards, processors, etc.	St
1.1.6	I thinking of buying an HP with an Intel processor, at least 2GB of RAM, and upgrading the graphics card, etc on my own.	St
1.1.7	Also, is there one company that is better than another for buying PC's from and being most upgradable.	St
1.1.8	Finally, are there any books out there that can tell me how to build one.	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks alot!	St
1.2.1	upgrading the graphics in a pc from a mainstream manufacturer can be more difficult since hp/dell/compaq/emachines etc.	St
1.2.2	typically only size their power supplies for the graphics card that came with the system.	St
1.2.3	this usually means 300w power supplies that can't handle cards like a geforce 8800gt or radeon hd3850.	St
1.2.4	gateway's bought directly from their website ship with 400/450w power supplies so they're more upgrade friendly in that respect.	St
1.2.5	however, unless the pc only has integrated graphics, you're still paying for a graphics card that you're (effectively) going to throw away.	St
1.2.6	as for memory, most manufacturers use slower memory than what you'd probably upgrade to.	St
1.2.7	that and the fact that they sometimes fill all available slots may mean you're throwing away some or all of the existing ram.	St
1.2.8	if you're willing to build and can budget about $800, you can probably build a better pc than you can buy, but you've got to be willing to deal with the possible headaches of a self-build.	St
1.2.9	if you want to buy and upgrade immediately, then check the specs on the pc you're buying (make sure its has pci-express x16) and look for minimal ram and integrated graphics.	Sug
