The new case has the screw holes raised away from the case. Does this mean I do not need standoffs? If you need to see a pic to be sure let me know.

But just double check to be sure none of them touch the board where they shouldn't. If so happen that it does touch then I probably use electrical tape or plastic washer to insulated it. Good luck.

But, if this doesn't match what is required for the mtrbd. as in the mounting areas are off, though these standoffs are there only to prevent moving of the mtrbd. and proper grounding. If other stand-offs are required then the h/w is either missing or wasn't include. There is nothing to keep you from returning the case as its incomplete. usually some plastic stand=offs are needed to keep the mtrbd. flexing to touch the metal casing. Though, when short of some items like this or seemingly lacking a good fit or match, I use foam to help separate metal and mtrbd.. You have to use your judgment of this as the picture while helpful isn't showing just how the mtrbd. would fit. A local source of a computer should have h/w kits or spare posts to buy. also, online vendors offer such items, google for them if you want to keep the case and standoffs are needed for best install. tada -----Willy
