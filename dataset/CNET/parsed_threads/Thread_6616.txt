<s> I need to take a portable self contained scanner into the field to capture archival photographs. </s>
<s> It would have to be a flat bed type as these photographs would not survive a journey through the sheet fed variety. </s>
<s> I would need on-board storage (as much as possible) and portable power supply. </s>
<s> Output to a MAC would be preferable but not a necessity. </s>
<s> I couldn't find any product in previous threads on this subject, but wonder if there are any new products on the market. </s>
<s> I gather a high resolution (&gt;10 megs) digital camera might be the answer, but I need the highest resolution I can get. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> But I have used laptops and scanners before. </s>
<s> A favorite (I bought 2!) </s>

<s> I decline duplicating specs or how it works but suffice it to say it's been grand to carry along to capture photos that fit on it. </s>

<s> If I can find one, does it work on a stand alone basis (i.e. </s>
<s> not attached to the laptop)? </s>
<s> The more I read your post the more I see some omission. </s>
<s> Why isn't a laptop acceptable? </s>
<s> I'll be in India - museums, palaces, archives, etc. </s>
<s> Just want to keep my baggage to a minimum. </s>
<s> Don't really want to carry a laptop as well as a scanner. </s>
<s> There are fine web articles about using a camera as a scanner. </s>
<s> I won't duplicate such. </s>
<s> But if you must ask then do so in our camera forum. </s>
<s> Again, there is no such device. </s>
