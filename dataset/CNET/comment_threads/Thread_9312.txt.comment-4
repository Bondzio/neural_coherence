Thanks, I tried that briefly the other night when it was happening, and it may have helped a bit - it's not a permanent problem, and when it does happen it's often very subtle and barely noticeable... At least, until I notice it, after which I can't stop noticing it :P Will fiddle with the cables properly and see if it helps.
If no luck with that, will look into it further as suggested by Willy and try to isolate the problem.
Thanks!
