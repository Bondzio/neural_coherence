Then I bought a Linksys. All my computers experience the same problem. The wireless connection is not continuous. Every 10-12 minutes I lose connection for about 2 minutes. What could the problem be? It is not in the routers, or computers. I am also on my second modem from Comcast. Any help would be greatly appreciated. (I lost connection as I type this and waiting to come back online.)
