<s> Ok, so I'm really blond today. </s>
<s> I'm sitting here looking at two speakers and a subwoofer and am clueless what connects to what. </s>
<s> Any help appreciated. </s>
<s> The subwoofer has 4 inputs. </s>
<s> Line 1 (In/Out) Line 2 (L/R) The main speaker has 5 inputs. </s>
<s> Input 1 Input 2 To Left Speaker Output DC The remaining speaker has 1 input. </s>
<s> To right speaker. </s>
<s> I'm assuming one of these plugs will go to the sound input on the back of my PC. </s>
<s> Any help appreciated. </s>
<s> I understand the DC on the back of the one speaker and the power plug on the back of the subwoofer. </s>
<s> This is a Yamaha YST MSW10 set, and my PC is a Dell Dimension with Windows XP. </s>
<s> ...shows diagrams, plugs, and all connections. </s>
<s> Make sure you have Adobe Acrobat Reader ( http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html )installed before using this link : http://www2.yamaha.co.jp/manual/pdf/av/english/pcS/YST-MSW10.pdf Seems easier to understand with pictures! </s>
<s> Good luck, GeeBee. </s>
<s> Thank you much! </s>
<s> And most definately...pictures are great! </s>
<s> :-)I searched google on the model number and I went to the yamaha page...but came up with nuthin'. </s>
<s> Appreciate the help. </s>
<s> Maybe I'll be jamming shortly. </s>
<s> Really want to try to hook up this Altec 250 watts surround sound, but tired right now of splicing speaker wire that I needed. </s>
<s> Will get to it another night. </s>
<s> But need sound NOW for a project. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
