<s> I bought a Gateway laptop and I am wondering how to get wireless. </s>
<s> I already have a few computers hooked up to a cable modem and and Linskeys wired router. </s>
<s> I have a wii and that runs wireless off of the Linskeys router. </s>
<s> Is this all I need for the laptop? </s>
<s> If your toys can connect wirelessly to the router your new computer should -- most new laptops come with wireless as standard. </s>
<s> Suggest you read the router manual and have a look at the networking setup in Windows on the laptop and make sure the laptop's wireless switch (usually on the side of the case) is in the ON position. </s>
<s> If Vista it should be pretty simple to connect. </s>
<s> If so we have a note about this in our forum sticky. </s>
<s> built in wireless? </s>
<s> The yes or no answer will determine the solution. </s>
<s> Yes it is Vista. </s>
<s> (my first time using Vista) Yes the laptop does have built in wireless as far as I know. </s>
<s> This is a link to the laptop. </s>
