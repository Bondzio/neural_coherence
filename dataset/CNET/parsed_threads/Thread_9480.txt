<s> Hey Im planning to buy a new pc.Not spending too much but i want to get the most out of my money . </s>
<s> I just need help with choosing the motherboard and Im thinking of have a dual channel for the ram because i heard that its pretty good. </s>
<s> here's the website that im going to buy it from: http://www.pricespy.co.nz/cat_6.html?s=1&g=175 and here are the components that i've chosen so far: Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600, 2.4GHz, LGA775, quad core $386.35 Seagate 250GB 7200rpm 8MB Cache 3Gb/s SATAII hard drive </s>
<s> you start over. </s>
<s> Your doing this backwards start with the motherboard and then add from there. </s>
<s> Choose a mother board with the most universal socket that you can get then make sure it can run the most advanced CPU that is available the day you buy it. </s>
<s> Motherboard first then CPU then RAM and Graphics card, then all the rest. </s>
<s> Much of this will depend on your personal needs and wants choose components that fit them. </s>
<s> definitely go with a mobo based on the intel p31 or p35 chipset. </s>
<s> these mobos will support intel's latest 45nm (penryn) cpus so you'll have an upgrade path in the near future. </s>
<s> the abit ip35, gigabyte ga-p35, msi p35 neo2 families of mobos are good choices, but from your list gigabyte seems to have the best price and availabilty. </s>
<s> i suggest you consider these three: Gigabyte GA-P31-S3L Gigabyte GA-P35-DS3 Gigabyte GA-P35-S3L Gigabyte's naming suffixes can be confusing, so here's a comparison chart . </s>
<s> the mobo price goes up as features are added, so determine what features you'll use and buy the mobo that delivers. </s>
<s> (no reason to pay for a 2nd pci-express slot, 8gb ram support, 2 extra sata ports, extra overclocking support, and 4 extra usb ports if you're not going to use them.) </s>
<s> p.s. </s>
<s> : you're going about your build properly. </s>
<s> but if you plan on overclocking, you should get a p35 based mobo (not p31) and go with better ram (cl4 or faster from ocz, corsair, crucial, mushkin, etc. </s>
<s> ). </s>
<s> wow thanks for your reply guys. </s>
<s> What do you mean go by a better ram? </s>
<s> as in brand wise or the capacity or what? </s>
<s> And I wanted to ask you, does it matter if the ram is eec or not eec or dont they have that anymore? </s>
<s> So gigabyte is a good mobo? </s>
<s> I heard asus makes the best mobos? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> better ram = lower cas latency. </s>
<s> your original post mentioned kingston value ram, cl 5. i suggest you go with cl 4 ram instead... ddr2-800 cl4 can be picked up for $40USD/gb so there's no reason to use cl5 unless $5-$10 will break your budget. </s>
<s> for desktop boards, you don't need error correcting memory. </s>
<s> asus, msi, gigabyte, and abit are the 'name' brands for mobo using intel chipset. </s>
<s> asus is very popular (largest oem mfg, much like hertz vs. avis and budget) and thus they can charge a bit more, however any of these brands will get you a top-notch mobo. </s>

<s> Hey thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> Ok can I ask you guys for a big favour? </s>
<s> Can you help me construct a pc from this site: www.pricespy.co.nz All needed parts would be there and my budget would be inside $1000. </s>
