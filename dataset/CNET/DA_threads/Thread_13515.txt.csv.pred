1.1.1	My boss has a Dell Inspiron Notebook , less than a year old , OS Windows XP .	St
1.1.2	It was purchased with two other notebooks of the same .	St
1.1.3	His is the only one where the fan will almost continually run , and when it does the computer slows down to a crawl .	St
1.1.4	We had a tech in a few days ago for something else and she agreed to look at this computer , but only had a few moments .	St
1.1.5	She said there is interference from a wireless network somewhere else in the office park we are in .	St
1.1.6	We are not set up for wireless - our internet access is through a dialup LAN , which 4 of us share .	St
1.1.7	None of us are familiar with wireless at all .	St
1.1.8	What can be done to check if this is the problem and how do we stop this ?	Ques
1.1.9	Could someone be piggybacking onto our antique connection ?	Ques
1.1.10	We do n't have a firewall ( yes I know !	St
1.1.11	) , and I do n't think the XP firewall is in active status .	St
1.1.12	I 've never used a firewall either , so do n't know much about them .	St
1.1.13	One of the other laptops says that the internet is already being used when we go online .	St
1.1.14	Both computers have Norton AV & internet protection , Spybot , & Spyware Blaster installed with definitions up to date and no infections showing .	St
1.1.15	I 'm a rank amateur so please try to explain what to check or do as simply as possible .	Sug
1.1.16	Thank you !	St
1.2.1	You take this back to Dell until its solved .	St
1.2.2	Since you are not using wireless , that is not the issue .	St
1.2.3	Cheers , Bob	St
