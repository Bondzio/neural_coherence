1.1.1	For a short class I recently finished, I built a new pc.	St
1.1.2	The pc is AMD, and the current ram is 256 ddr pc2700 333mhz.	St
1.1.3	Can I get any pc2700 ram at 333mhz, or could there be any exceptions that wouldn't work with my motherboard?	St
1.1.4	(I don't really know that much about pc hardware... not sure what my motherboard is but my processor is a sempron).	St
1.2.1	Just checked, it's a syntax motherboard.	St
1.3.1	Sorry, also the Syntax mb is a SV400.	St
1.4.1	ddr pc2700 333mhz \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ You mentioned this ram installed, you need more of the same.	St
1.4.2	I suggest you visit http://www.kingston.com for a match to your mtrbd.	St
1.4.3	model and order it.	St
1.4.4	BUT, offhand just about any PC2700 should work, just be sure if you can return it if it doesn't as some systems do get picky, epseically if you tweek it too much.	St
1.4.5	Vendors offering PNY, Specter, or SimpleTechnology ram will also work.	St
1.4.6	good luck -----Willy	Polite
1.5.1	Since you now know what MB you have you can check thier web site.	St
1.5.2	But most of the time just get the same kind that you have and it should work.	St
1.5.3	John	St
1.6.1	That should work then hopefully.	Sug
1.6.2	Kingston doesnt have syntax mother boards by the way.	St
