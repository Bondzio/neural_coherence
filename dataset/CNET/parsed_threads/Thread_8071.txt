<s> for printing colour photos,images from Illustrator which printer do you think is better: Canon PIXMA iP4300 or Hp Photosmart D7160 ? </s>
<s> and also which of both printers will be less expensive to get ink cartridges </s>
<s> Okay, as for what is cheaper to keep, go with the Canon. </s>
<s> The cartridges have a larger volume of ink (about double what the HP has) for only $4 more per color, and is cheaper on the black. </s>
<s> Now if you are doing more graphical work, I would actually recommend the Canon Pixma iP6700. </s>
<s> The 4300 is okay, but the 6700 gives you the two photo or light colors, and get's rid of the text (pigment) black. </s>
