I was trying anything...
I just added the USB and for some reason the &quot;Link&quot; or internet cable light stayed on.....Before that, when I followed the disk with the NETGEAR router it would cut off....I live in a small Louisiana town but I was able to find 3 computer fixer companies that will come out and take a look.
Since COX cable do not tech support NETGEAR...
