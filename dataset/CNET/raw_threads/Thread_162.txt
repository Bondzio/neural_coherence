12367	0	4254	50829	NR	redmaggott	11/28/03 6:20 AM	1.0700004E12	Something set wrong , or is something faulty?	I have built a new PC - P4 2.6 (800),Asus P4P800 Mobo , Asus 128Mb Fx5600 , 512Mb DDR400 , Maxtor 120Gb 7200 HD , Sony 16x DVD , Asus 5224 CDRW. It runs a lot slower than expected.Norton Speed Disc (defrag) has been running for nearly 24 hours and has still not completed - a task that usually takes several hours.When i try to install a game it is extremely slow to install when using the CDRW ( although the drive works fine when burning etc ) but is fine when installed from the DVD.The whole PC just seems far slower than it should be - its works but just so slow.The motherboard accepts dual channel RAM but normal DDR is installed.Would upgrading the RAM to dual channel help - could anything be set wrong in the bios that is slowing it down? - could the hard drive be the cause?Any advice - really appreciated

Is DMA enabled? Try Bob Proffitt's security suite at: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6132-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=1313&start=0 Try running the tests at: http://www.pcpitstop.com/default.asp Ken

O/s is Xp Pro Sp1 - all up to date, DMA is enabled.Just remembered this - after installing a game the other day the auto detect in the config said that the CPU was not fast enough - 2.6 p4?

PERFORM the procedure at http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/hwdev/tech/storage/IDE-DMA.mspx and don't come back until you've done this. It's safe, easy and has cured a few. Bob

Sometimes the HS will get clogged with dust and and cause the cpu to overheat. Look in Task manager to see what cpu usage you have with no apps running. Could be something using up all your cpu cycles. Ken

12367	6	4254	51986	51939	R. Proffitt	11/29/03 12:15 PM	1.0701081E12	The usual.	Faulty boards, outdated BIOS, too much diddling with settings, trying old IDE 40 conductor cables, failing drives, drives fdisked on another machine, drives with odd custom partitions, tunafish in the power supply, WORMS, Nachi Worms, MS-Blaster Worms, Kazaa, iMesh, P2P programs in general, trojans, spyware, malware, badware and the list goes on for a very long time. The clues you supply can narrow it down. Bob

My Mistake - DMA is not enabled - i have followed the procedure but i cannot get it to change from PIO - i have checked for problems at various forums and it appears that the Asus P4P800 does have problems with DMA - unfortunatley i have not found a soultion - Is there any other way i can enable DMA?
12367	8	4254	52068	52046	R. Proffitt	11/29/03 1:21 PM	1.07011206E12	AHA. You've found it.	It's time to pester the board supplier about this. But let me share that in your post, far too many details were left out. No long dissertations are required, but any number of items like using some odd 40 conductor cable, an odd driver here or there could do it in. Or some outdated BIOS or missing driver. The supplier should be contacted since I don't have any list of what you built or if you did something oddball like move a drive with an OS from another machine. But at least you've found the cause.
