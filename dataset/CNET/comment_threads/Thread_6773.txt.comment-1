Hello everybody.
My computer is a compaq 5bw220, win xp, intel celeron 633mhz.
384 mb ram.
I want to upgrade my computer.
I want to add a new video and sound card.
But the computer came with video and sound built into the mother board.
Can I still add these items.
I also want to add a second hard drive.
The system came with a 15gb one.
How do I know if I buy a bigger hard drive then 15gb the computer will recognize it.
Thank you.
