You would find similar results in comparing regular gas for your car.
Outside of cosmetic appearances, write protect switch and maybe some bundled software there isn't much to compare here.
I will write that I own a pair of 1G USB drives and they are nice to have about.
By year end I'll see about getting a 4GB model but until then I picked up a 60GB small drive for same price as the 4GB flash unit.
