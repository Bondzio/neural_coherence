<s> i have a netgear dgnd 3700 router and wish to add an external hard drive and was about to purchase a seagate goflex 3tb external but have read that these two are incompatible ? </s>
<s> i thought this ready share enabled feature allowed you to connect any usb/ethernet storage device ? </s>
<s> That won't work, sadly. </s>
<s> A USB hard drive is not an OS and doesn't have the software installed to talk to the router or manage networking. </s>
<s> You will need some kind of NAS (Network Attached Storage) system where you can, if you wish, connect the hdd to if you want to use it as a network drive. </s>
<s> There's more here; http://www.techsupportforum.com/forums/f31/connecting-usb-external-drive-to-router-137701.html That said, I wonder if &quot;Mapping the hdd&quot; would work? </s>
<s> That USB drive connected to one computer on a network. </s>
<s> The other computers on the network 'map' that drive so it behaves like a drive on them and they have access to it. </s>
<s> But I am not sure about that. </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> I visited the Netgear support website and found this: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What can I do with ReadyShare USB Storage Access? </s>
<s> In your home today, you connect multiple PCs and other devices to the network. </s>
<s> Many of the same files now need to be routinely accessed by multiple PCs, gaming consoles and other devices connected to the network. </s>
<s> Most consumers buy external hard drives to store the content besides the desktop hard drives. </s>
<s> But now you can simply plug in your USB external hard drive to the USB port of the router instead of connecting to each and every computer when required. </s>
<s> Any device in the network can now read/write simultaneously from the USB hard drive connected to the DGND3700 at a much higher speed than any competing router in its category. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yet, it doesn't explain the degree of size that the router can handle and/or the small details that maybe needed for a good fit. </s>
<s> Thus, you will need to inquire them to see where it all leads. </s>
<s> I'm sure the router install should have direct setting(I assume) for any reference for the ext. </s>
<s> USB port usage. </s>
<s> Check the manual. </s>
<s> I did find that is also supports a printer from those USB port(s). </s>
<s> Also, you do realize a 3Tb HD is a large HD and that alone maybe an issue. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> been doing a lot of research online regarding this matter and from what i have found along with contacting both companies i have decided to just opt for a nas drive instead. </s>
<s> seems to be the only solution for my needs so i have just ordered the seagate nas110 seeing as the kids have two xboxs they can now watch all there movies. </s>
