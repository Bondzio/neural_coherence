in a notebook, it matters that the os is known (you didn't tell) and who installed the os (unknown.)
i'll share one possible fix and not dive into driver discussions until you tell more.
-&gt; look up winsockxpfix on google.com to repair the usual spyware induced damaged networking that causes a lot of posts like yours.
cheers, bob
