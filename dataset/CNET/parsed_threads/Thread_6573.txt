<s> I'm looking to set up a wireless network at our neighborhood swimming pool. </s>
<s> The internet access would be a DSL line on the phone. </s>
<s> Because of the size of the pool area, range would be very important. </s>
<s> Therefore I'm assuming an N wireless router would be best. </s>
<s> In looking at reviews I keep seeing the Trendnet N-Draft Router TEW-631BRP topping the charts in the 200 foot range tests. </s>
<s> Anyone with experience with this wireless router that could comment? </s>
<s> Or recommend a wireless router with good range and reliability? </s>
<s> While the various new draft N routers are coming on the market, it looks like the old Belkin pre-N router is beating the new ones in the reviews. </s>
<s> Would that be a good one for range if I can find it? </s>
<s> If the antenna of the wifi can be seen I see well over 500 feet. </s>
<s> Not at 54+ megabit but for a public node that's ok. Bob </s>
