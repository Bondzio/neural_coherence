dont wait til yours is dead to replace it its 5 years old and past its prime it may die any day and the data on it could potentialy be lost to magnetics of the earth.
you dont have to have as the say bleeding edge technology if you have a machine 5 years old 6-9 month old technology is going to blow you away and save you some cash as well.
i like amd it kicks intels butt all over the place especially in value something with a 1600mghz fsb and ddr or ddr2 will sufice think about pci express but on a budget you might stick with agp 8x it still thrills me most of the time.
im in a similar place mines 3 year old tech, i bought 2.5 years ago.
im torn between the upgrade ability of 939 vs. value of 754 sockets.
performance on both will smoke my xp2500 .
what ever you buy itll be obsolete in 18 months or 24 months.
so enjoy it today
