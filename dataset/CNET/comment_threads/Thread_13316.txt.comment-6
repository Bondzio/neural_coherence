I wish there was, but there isn't...
I've been told I have a crap case!
I guess it's true... before, I could have a household fan blowing into it and that would stop the blue screen from appearing, but just now it seems to have happened again even with this fan blowing in.
It appears the problem is getting worse and worryingly more frequent Now I'm concerned this isn't even an overheating problem since my previous temporary solution doesn't even work now!
I've replaced the PSU, and a friend of mine will lend me a processor and graphics card so that I can work out if it's anything to do with those.
This same friend suggested it could be a problem with the motherboard, and I'm not looking fwd to replacing that!
Any tips on replacing a motherboard?
