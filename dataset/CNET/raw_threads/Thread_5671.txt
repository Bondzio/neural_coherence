It has been working fine, until recently, when it refuses to boot up upon pressing the power button. Initially i thought it may be a power problem, and indeed it still may be but i'm not sure. Basically when i press the power button nothing happens except for a single green light comes on (a light on the motherboard) which i believe is the DIMM led. So power does reach the board, but it doesn't boot up, any ideas? Thanks Adrian

No beeps means dead CPU, power supply or motherboard most of the time, but you have to strip it down to ... Motherboard, CPU+HSF, power supply and the speaker. No cards, IDE cables, no video card, no RAM, nothing but four parts. If it beeps, good. If not, you are looking at the four possible bad parts. Bob

But at an average 120 dollar bill, you might beat them on that price even if you had to buy a new power supply, motherboard and CPU. Since it's an AMD CPU and those do fry in under 1 second if the heatsink is not on proper, it's my first guess. Next is the power supply which you can test on another machine (spare parts?), but at 20-30 dollars for a 450 Watt PSU, that may be your first choice. Bob

I purchased a new power supply and connected it all together, and it seem to be booting fine into windows, however something started to smell like it was burning so i switched it off. Now when i switch it on, i get a repeated beep noise (about 3-4 seconds) I've had a quick look around, and since my bios is a award bios, most sites tend to say that the beeping either means its a memory or a graphics card problem.... Which one is it more likely to be because i don't have spare parts to check etc and could that be what i smelt burning. I can't smell anything burning anymore when i switch comp on... Thanks Adrian

One of the problems at the office is we often buy 6 or more of the same board or such. A batch of motherboards began to have issues, but not before we lost a few power supplies. Finally I looked deeper and sure enough the motherboard had the BAD CAP problem. These bad capacitors not only cause booting issues that subside with bigger power supplies but can cause smoke and board scorch marks as the bad capacitors degrade and fail. Some short out and do other bad behaviours. Out of that batch of boards (6), only 2 are still running and we were able to find replacement motherboards so we'll swap those out if (and when) they glitch. Here's a site and pictures about this issue -&gt; http://www.badcaps.net/ Bob

Now, that you've replaced the power supply, the mtrbd. fault was finally finished and it may have taken the new p/s with it. OR the p/s was bad to begin with and took the final stage of the mtrbd. along with it. What happens to you is common, especially with power problems. If it is a bad cap, then unless you're willing to repair and hope for the best, I suggest to move on and get a mtrbd. replacement. The 1ghz AMD cpu was very demanding and to keep it may not be cost effective in the long run. Sorry, but that's IMHO more trouble than its worth, because now you ned to fix the mtrbd.(caps?) and buy yet another p/s to continue on. good luck -----Willy
