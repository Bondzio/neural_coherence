1.1.1	I had a few files (several GB) on my 1TB external HDD when it had virus; i.e when I opened the HDD on Windows Explorer, it showed I had no files, but when I clicked on &quot;Properties&quot;, the GB used were still there; or when I opened it with Winrar, the files were also there.	St
1.1.2	As those files were not important, I chose to format the HDD.	St
1.1.3	After either &quot;Quick format&quot; or Normal format, the HDD now shows there's no files, but still a 128MB used on the HDD.	St
1.1.4	What is this 128MB used, and how can I get rid of it?	St
1.1.5	I thought if they're some system files, it'll be just a few MB used?	St
1.1.6	Thanks, Ctmap	St
1.2.1	Creating a file system takes up space for the allocation table, recycle bin and other things even when empty.	St
1.2.2	Sort of like an empty file cabinet takes up space.	St
