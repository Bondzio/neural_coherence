<s> So I'm looking to upgrade my RAM in my HP a6157c. </s>
<s> I'm running Vista 32. </s>
<s> I've learned that means that I can't have more than 3 gb ram. </s>
<s> Right now I have 2X 1gb PC2 5300 DDR2 RAM and I'm obsessed with having the best I can possibly have. </s>
<s> My question is do I have to buy 2gb more of RAM so that it's paired up? </s>
<s> Meaning, do I have to have 4gb of ram in the computer even though i'm only using 3gb of it? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> While you can use the /3GB switch to tell XP or Vista to let applications use more than 2GB RAM the brutal truth is there is so little payback that I'd not do this. </s>
<s> And yes you get to (in most machines) buy a pair of 2GB sticks and live with 2.9 to 3.5GB being reported or usable with the Windows you have. </s>
<s> I wouldn't. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thanks for the input bob....so I really won't see much of a difference if I upgrade huh? </s>
<s> Yes I tried BIOSHOCK on 2GB and it ran fine. </s>
<s> I'm thinking this is one of the piggiest games yet. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You dont have to buy a 2nd 2gb if youllonly be running 3, as thats as much as the 32bit OS recognizes. </s>
<s> There are windows boot commands I believe as /maxmem you can use to manage ram size, but truthfully you dont need more then 2 gb. </s>
<s> Your just bored looking for something to spend money on! </s>
<s> Dont get more ram unless your desktop is a workstation, heavy on photoshop or 3d design, in which case youll probably want to upgrade your proc or GPU first. </s>
