15231	0	361170	3136806	NR	congakeystone	9/27/09 3:36 PM	1.25406576E12	Router Dilemma	We have 2 home PCs, one Dell Dimension 2400 with Windows XP, Service Pack 2, 2.2 Ghz Intel Pentium 4, 40 GB hard drive, 1022 Mb memory, Broadcom 440x 10/100 Integrated Controller and one Dell Dimension E510 with Windows XP, Service Pack 2, 2.8 Ghz Intel Pentium 4, 160 Gb hard drive, 512 Mb memory, Integrated 10/100 Network card Via our ISP, we have DSL, with a Linksys SPA 2102 phone adapter with cable from its Internet port going to Ethernet port of Westell 6100, the Ethernet port of SPA goes to network adapter port of computer, the SPA phone1 port connnects by phone wire to baseboard jack. The Westell 6100 router has its Ethernet port conected to the SPA 2102 as mentioned, and a small diameter cable running from Westell's DSL port to a jack in baseboard (both from ISP, and installed via the Dimension 2400, which I'd like to continue using as host computer). I checked online and the Linksys Phone Adapter configuration is set to DHCP http://192.168.0.1/advanced I also got online information on the Westell 6100 http://192.168.1.1/index.htm I bought a Linksys WRT54G router, cause I eventually want to set up for wireless, if possible. To my chagrin, setting up the WRT54G is not as easy as putting in its installation CD and setting up.I will wait to try setup until I get some advice. I need help from here. I am reading things about upgrading firmware on the WRT54G ( I did find the firmware download page on Linksys site, but do not want to download yet, until I get an overview of advice). Then I am reading that I may have to &quot;bridge&quot; the Westell 6100 to get the WRT54G to work. Any advice how to set up my home network with this hardware would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Power off all devices, and power up in this order. DSL modem (wait for the lights), router, (wait for the lights), PC(s). Leave the WRT-54G at defaults (forget the install CD, it's plug and play), and plug in one of the wired computers. On line? Yep. Plug in the other PC. Ready for wireless? In the router setup, turn on the WLAN (wireless LAN = radio). The WRT-54G is an older but reliable wired/wireless router. Downloading and installing the latest firmware will help performance and bring it up to date.
