thanks guys i was a little worried as i didnt actually have a look at my CPU Temps befor...its maxed out now at 2319Ghz and to be honest its vastly improved the performance of the machine, feels like a new computer!
and i just bought some 1GB RAM sticks for it to take it from 1GB upto 2GB as i also let the GPU steel 128MB from the MOBO aswell as clock the CPU....
