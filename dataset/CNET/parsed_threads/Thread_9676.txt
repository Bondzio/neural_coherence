<s> Hello, I am looking to upgrade my brother's pc with a PCIE-16x video card. </s>
<s> But he only has a PCIE-1x slot available as well as a regular PCI slot. </s>
<s> Is there any way to install the PCIE-16x card with an adapter or something? </s>
<s> If not, what would be a good cheap PCI or PCIE-1x card to install? </s>
<s> I'm mostly looking to play games released in the past few years like Doom 3, Half Life 2, and BF 2142 with good performance. </s>
<s> Preferably a card with at least 256mb. </s>
<s> He has a Dell E310 with 2.8 ghz, 1gb RAM, Win XP. </s>
<s> And his psu is only 230w. </s>
<s> He has an integraded Intel(R) 82915G/GV/910GL video card. </s>
<s> The PCIE-16x cards that I have considered are the Ati X800XL 256 mb or the Ati X1950 Pro 256. </s>
<s> I know he would need a higher wattage psu for the X1950, if not both. </s>
<s> Anyway, thanks for any help. </s>

<s> Thanks for the link. </s>
<s> Does anyone know how well the Radeon X1550 PCI 256mb would perform on some recent games like BF 2142? </s>
<s> The PCI version, not the PCIE version. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Read reviews at http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814103031 It's not much faster than a fx5200 so keep shopping. </s>
<s> The card I noted should done much better. </s>
<s> Why isn't that an option. </s>
<s> If you can find a fx5700 in PCI form I'll write it's nice for games prior to 2006. </s>

<s> I can't find the x1 card you recommended anywhere for sale. </s>
<s> But there's an x1550 512 x1 card on Newegg that I found: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814161079 Any thoughts on that one? </s>
<s> I'll check out the fx5700. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot. </s>

<s> &quot;Pros: works great. </s>
<s> runs battlefield 2142 on high settings on my Dell E310.&quot; Try that one. </s>
<s> Note that some had to do some metal work to get it to fit on some machines. </s>
