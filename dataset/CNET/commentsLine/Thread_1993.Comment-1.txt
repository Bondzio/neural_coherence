hello.
my pc has a problem with pc.
it works well with removable media, like usb flash drives but when i connect input devices, for example usb keyboard or joystick, problems start.
when typing with keyboard for few secnds it is fine until it goes nuts, like aaaaaaaaaaaaa....... continuesly.
and playing games with joystick is frustrating cause it freeses for some time, especially afte i pause the game or switch different views.
i dont think its associted with drivers because it happens with freshly installed os ass well.
motherboard: asus m2n4 sli pcu: amd athlon 4400+ os: win xp
