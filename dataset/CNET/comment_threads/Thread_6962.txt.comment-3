I changed them to WPA2 Wireless Security enhanced on the router and WPA2 Personal on the laptop.
We'll see if I have to unplug everything tomorrow morning.
Even though I restarted and everything worked, it's always the next day that is the problem.
As far as TKIP, AES, I have always had it as TKIP.
I thought someone told me at one time to always use TKIP.
Does anyone else have any additional comment on TKIP or AES?
