<s> All of a sudden, my USB drives are running super slow. </s>
<s> I made no changes or additions to what is plugged in the drives. </s>
<s> Whenever I plug in the drive I get &quot;this drive could perform faster&quot; (which never happened before) When I go to load a new large file onto my usb drive/portable hd, ect. </s>
<s> i get 1 mb/sec (at most). </s>
<s> Any port I try it in, I get the same speed. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Solutions? </s>
<s> The owner had updated drivers with Windows Update or that Driver Update button. </s>
<s> As there is no make or model we can't discuss ideas on where the right drivers might be. </s>
<s> This leaves the advice to use System Restore to the time before &quot;sudden.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> hp m9350fsuch as this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883107705 however i do have win7 ultimate on it (but the drives were fine after i installed 7 about a year ago) </s>
<s> My advice is to use system restore to when it worked. </s>
<s> As to the cause, the cause continues to be that Windows Update and accepting drivers most of the time. </s>
<s> If that's some HP, check HP for motherboard drivers to install and hope. </s>

<s> Scan your system for worm that may have caused degradation in the performance of the USB drive.. </s>
