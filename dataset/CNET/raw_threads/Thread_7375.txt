Isn't HDTV already digital? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television writes about an analog high def but that was in 1936. Since this is a world wide forum, what's available here may not be in your country. Here's my suggestion. Look at the Apple store and ask them then check your usual Apple web sites such as macally and more. Then share your findings here for comment. If you are trying to capture HDTV then you also know the makers are not too keen on giving that capability to the public. Bob
