My Dad's PC is driving me (and him) absolutey mad.It's a Gigabyte GA71XE-4 with a Atlon Thunderbird (850) and 576MB RAM.
It also has a Hercules Prophet 8500LE, A 20GB Maxtor and it's in A modded case.
Basically everytime the PC is booted up, it crashes on the XP splash screen, I think it's at the Hardware detection part (Where the optical mouse and keyboard flash).
It used to require turn off from the plug, and after restart would load windows normally, but now it does it twice, allways following the Same pattern, I have tried re-installing windows many times but to no avail, what shall I do, Most parts of the PC are 5+ Years old so I would not be suprised if something is not working, But what?
