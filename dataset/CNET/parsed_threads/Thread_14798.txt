<s> I have a Dlink 524 router which has become unsecured. </s>
<s> I've been trying to secure it following various oline instructions but i'm finding it very difficult.I've reset the router and renewed my IP address (this was lost at one point!) </s>
<s> but now on the DHCP page it's showing up my mac address (which i didn't put in) and is the preshare key where i put the password? </s>
<s> I created a password but when i tried to access the internet clicking on my newly renamed router, nothing happened, it was just trying to load!!!! </s>
<s> I also want to be able to access my wireless on my laptop but how do i do this (when i eventually secure the network) My pc is windows xp My laptop is a Dell Inspiron 15 windows vista Please help! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> I'd swap in another router to test to see if the ole 524 has passed. </s>
