But take notes about the cards and find the maker's web pages on them.
If you find a card then post a link about it in the forum and maybe some member will look it up, hunt it down or comment they own it and put a Watt meter on it.
For example I used some PCI Nvidia 9500 512MB video card and in the machine with the Watt meter it tops out at 120 Watts.
The PSU is 350 Watts so at less than half the PSU's rating I don't fret about it.
