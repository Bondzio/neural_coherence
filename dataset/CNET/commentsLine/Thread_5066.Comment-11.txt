i have total of 384 mb.
on average, i have about 100 to 190 mb available.
running zone alarm brings it down considerably, especially the top package i have.
plus, it brings down memory greatly when running photoshop 7.0. playing games online is a factor too.
it does get down to 50 to 80 mb frequently.
occasionally, it gets down much lower than that.
i uses freeram xp pro and it helps alot on maintaining the memory.
right now, at the time of writing this, it is at 105 mb.
i only have aol 9.0 security edition software opened, which is always, because i like accessing emails so quickly and not having to login frequently.
i go to webpages on aol more faster then opening explorer.
yes, i'm on cable.
yes, i still use explorer.
yim is on right now with two conversation boxes opened.
zone alarm is off.
just these running and my memory is at 105 mb.
