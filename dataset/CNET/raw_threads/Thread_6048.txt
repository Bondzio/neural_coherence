Since I have a recent broadband connection the PC is on for at least 15-18 hrs/day. I noticed that whenever I try to play a video clip on MediaPlayer the whole thing used to slow down to a crawl. Otherwise the machine was ok for other tasks only slows while playing video. Then when i started PCALert I noticed that the window for 3.3V was in the red and showed voltages ranging from 2.91 to 2.96 V and there was the alert sound. here is a screenshot- http://server2.uploadit.org/files/cbh5150-pcalert.jpg It has happened only twice this last week. What could be trouble? Is it big trouble needing immediate intervention? Thanks

While your system isn't fully stuffed, the wear&tear on the unit can degrade it and now it starting to show it age. A 400W+ unit is a good start, unless you get a namebrand 350W, otherwise a cheapie should be as big as you afford, otherwise you will pay later. 3.3V has to be stable. The WMP is now using the audio segment of your system which is &quot;real time&quot; so anything running in the backgrd. will reflect on its operation as WMP is a real resource hog, so clean-up if possible. Even, the monitoring pgm. is a burden as it really doing &quot;real time&quot; action as well, plus any other s/w you load at startup. enjoy -----Willy
