Also have several flash drives and sometimes burn data to hard copy, DVD/CD. I have a stack of formatted floppies around here somewhere can't think of a good reason to keep them so they will likely disappear in the near future. Best regards.

Also keep a weekly full data backup on mirrored hard disk stored remotely. OS, programs and profiles never backed up since they can be re-installed.

Following what I considered extensive research on the avilable means of storing backups I settled on the HP Media Vault MV-210. It is connected through my Verizon FIOS router, provides scheduled backups of My Documents, Photos, and Music files. The NV-2120 comes with one 500GB hard drive with the ability to double that capacity with the addition of a second 500GB hard drive. I've had the device for approximately six months, have approximately 250GB of data (both music and phptos) stored on it, and have become quite comfortable with its features. It just sits on the corner of my work area and automatically takes care of backups. Then it tells me when it is performing a backup and then goes back to sleep. Occasionally, just for peace of mind, I check the stored data by actually listening to music stored on the drive or viewing and edditing pictures that are out there. I hope that helps.
3351	7	303193	2824519	2824202	4Denise	8/1/08 8:25 PM	1.2176223E12	Combination	For everyday backups I use an external hard drive. Every week or two, though, I select some of my older data and back it up to CD or DVD. I make two copies of each disk. Only then will I allow the data to be removed from my hard drive. I do not consider an external drive to be a permanent solution. I also insist that I have at least 2 completely separate copies of the data before I consider it backed up. I like my system. It allows me to make a copy of my data quickly and easily. I just have enough sense to know that the quick copy is not entirely secure, so I have another method I use regularly. Denise

It's ironic that this post came up too because I just had an external hard drive go on me! I had purchased a Maxtor OneTouch III 320GB external hard drive to backup to and it was good until about a month ago (14 months of occasional and not being plugged in). The enclosure first had a short then the PCB (printed circuit board) fried. By the way if anybody has a Seagate ST3320620A with firmware 3.AAD, help please! Learn from me, as enticing a retail buy may be, build your own external hard drive. If you know how to install RAM and reformat a drive, you have the right skills to do it. Do your research on types of hard drives if you're not sure about terms and types of hard drives are on the market. My best advise would be to find a pair of identical hard drives and an enclosure with RAID1 (array of hard discs) with mirror support. Depending on what you want in terms of capacity, it'll probably cost a couple hundred. In most cases, your choices may cost less than buying retail. Don't forget to look for an enclosure which can dissipate heat and maybe have a fan. A RAID1 is my next action in saving my data. I hope this time it works to my advantage!
3351	9	303193	2824541	2824202	hugokc	8/1/08 8:41 PM	1.21762326E12	Backup Choices	I have two external hard drives to which I regularly back up my files. On the smaller (100 GB WD)drive I store my Windows OneCare Backup information (Music, Financial, and other data files). On the larger drive (500 GB Seagate Free Agent) I backed up my entire C Drive. This extra bit of caution came in handy this past week when I got the urge to upgrade my trusty XP Professional to Vista (what was I thinking?) After experiencing multiple problems with Vista, I simply formatted and wiped my C Drive, reinstalled Windows XP and restored my C Drive. had a C Drive crash. Since there's no easy way to &quot;downgrade&quot; from Vista back to XP, I simply formatted my C Drive, wiped it clean, and then reinstalled Windows XP. Then I restored my C Drive without a single problem. Every computer owner should have at least two external hard drives on which you schedule regular (at least weekly) backups. This is fairly easy if you just back up you C drive and then schedule incremental backups for any changes.

I back up also onto my laptop and also to another family owned computor away from my home. every month or so i also back up to a dvd. My photos of which there are millions i have backed up on two copies of dvds.ad have most of the recent ones on PC and external drive. a lot of my best photos are on pbase.com but i dont count that as a back up just as a sharing medium. I know that murphys law states anything that can go wrong will go wrong but as long as my databases are secure and my photos reasonably secure i am happy.

(b4 it was a ram like disc..more to the point, was a PD disc and was not 4.7Gb) I used PowerQuest then dump the image to the ram disc.(if it was a full image of the &quot;c&quot; drive for example.) I now use Ghost..it is just like PQ. PowerQuest was &quot;THE&quot; program that many computer companies used for the &quot;quick restore&quot; feature that they promoted. Symantec (formally Norton's) purchased PowerQuest and named it &quot;Ghost&quot;. The Ram disc record just like a hard drive..they are not linear (spiral) recorders like DVD. They access the disc faster than any DVD. The disc is made differently than a DVD, there are no dye refection problem (i.e:-R). these discs are extremely stable in most environments. can be recorded more than a 1000 times! and have a shelf life of a 100 years! the medical industry has, and still uses them as a primary archival medium. they are stored &quot;off site&quot; meaning they are not in the computer at all times. i myself have NEVER had an issue with one at all. i have stored them in a basement, on a shelf for over 8 years..the disc work fine. just for S#%ts and giggles..i have even tested them in water for 6 months..not a problem. A hardisk has to be exercised every so often or they will seize.(interpeter failure, motor bearing grease harding, etc.) Storing the drive is important too, the magnetic coating that is placed on the aluminum platters expands and contracts at a different rate than that of the platters, this has been taken into account during the design of the product. however, to many fluctuations in tempature and humidity can cause the magnetic layer to lift..and destroy the drive. The movie industry is grappling with this problem as we speak. they are now taking digital movie information ( from parts of the film that were like.. digital effects, sound, outakes cut-ins etc..) and either moving it from a HDD and putting it on film, like Kodak's Vision 2 or the new Vision 3 film.(can last over 100 years!) and storing it and using DVD-RAM as another media for long term storage. They have found that the hardisk has a life of non use of about 2~4 years. DVD about 15 years. before the data can't be read. the RAM disc does not have these kinds of problems. but has two others that i am aware of... 1, the disc only holds about 4.7 Gb of info, 2, will there be recorders around that will read the disc in a 100 years??? same holds true for USB devices such as hardrives and the like???? but right now the RAM-DISC is fine for me, it is robust and safe and darn near bullet proof. Forget Blue-Ray, way too much info on a disc that is easly damaged. Sony's way of making it desposable B4 it is usable. (the information layer is only .01mm away from the surface of the disc in respect to the RAM-DISC about .5mm away from the surface..) Now that is a BIG difference! That's my 2 cents worth.

We create very little material to backup so this method works for us. We started doing this after repeated failures using CDs/DVDs and Acronis. Takes about 10 minutes and can backup everything but settings and programs, Emails are a little more complicated but everything else is very simple and quick to backup. This thread is untracked. Bang!

This last one is small and portable so i can carry it with me. Having a NAS on network is more interesting than having a USB drive because it can be accessed from any computer on the network at the same time. Differents share can be done for every user and they can do their own backup to their shares.

It's a wireless NAS solution that's platform neutral. And if you happen to have a mac with leopard, backups are automatic with Time Machine. My house has both Macs and PCs so this was the only thing that I could find where we could access files- with any relative ease - from both platforms... love it. It's another great product from Apple.

It simply works exactly as it says and is so unobtrusive and seamless in its operation. I seldom if ever recommend many products but this one is by far one of the best I've seen or indeed tried. I used BT DigitalVault before but that was so user unfriemdly if you needed to restore, whereas Carbonite is as easy as reading your own drives in explorer. Added to which I do not think there is any limit to the amount of storage and I'm over 20GB now. The one big drawback i see with carbonite is that it, as yet, does not support removable storage I have a 500GB USB hardrive which it cannot see or recognise and so i have to be careful what i store on this drive, but I do understand that this may be resolved in the future realese. The cost of a years subscription to Carbonite is really so cheap it far outweighs buying another hard drive for backup purposes and as I have aready mentioned in the subject line. If its critical stuff then simply burn copies to CD or DVD disc's. Cheers

One of the external hard drives is kept offsite. This may seem to be a lot, but, if you've ever lost 85GB of ripped MP3/FLAC CDs, and had to rip them again, it adds a great measure of comfort. I use a synchronization program to keep the music files current on all devices. I backup the music when there is a change. Ordinary data files are backed up weekly; less often when I'm not home.

I use/make at least two CDs (using a different manufacturer's CD for each, to lessen any potential writing problems). Then I read each (in another CD reader), and get copy of its contents (using CMD (or, COMMAND ) DIR /s /s &gt; filenameDateETC.xxx). The contents file provides a neat way to search for a specific file, when I need to find it).

Similar to having a network file server backed up each night. I've also been known to backup stuff to DVDs to keep copies of our important files, pictures, etc. I've never thought of external HD as being a &quot;Backup&quot; method for me.

I also save all of my data to dual layer DVD once a month with weekly incrmentals. The DVDs contain ZIP files so no special software is required to recover the data. I have restored my system from a drive image one time, and it took a couple of hours. I have also recovered old data from the DVDs. The DVDs are the best, because I can go back to any time in the last four years. I have tapes from before that, but I no longer have the software or the drive so they are worthless.

I also have an external hard drive (250 g) to back up certain data and photos , plus certain things I back up onto smaller usb drives. I do all this because I have a very slow internet connection due to living in the country, and had problems with my computer with me ending up reformating the computer about every 3 months and then the awful updating of windows, etc online. The problem ended up being a power supply that just wasn't powerful enough for the computer. Most of those problems ended once I got a better power supply. Now it's just when I do something stupid.

I am a DJ with tons of music and HAD it all backed up on a WD external.. I have used this process for years, but just a couple weeks ago, (1 year and 1 month after it's purchase, it stopped. I hook up, it &quot;clicks&quot; 3 times, and that's it. No &quot;running&quot; or &quot;spinning&quot; sounds at all, and obviously my Hp/ompaq presario, with Vista, doesn't recognize THAT activity. Ironically, this external has NEVER, had a jolt, (drop, slap, punch, bump, spill, etc).... but the Iomega I had for about six years, had been Dropped hard, from at least waist high, on concrete, at least 4-5 times....and I never had a problem with it. as a matter of fact I just recently gave it away because it was still going after all this time, but it was too small. Now, I believe I have decided to put all the music on DVD's. Not as convenient, but it is when you consider the loss of ALL your data. If you can't tell, I am not sure I have made the right choice yet, so please chime in, and let me know, What is the best method. By the way, so that i am not bashing WD.... they did offer a $15.00 coupon... LOL I WAS 30 DAYS PASSED THE WARRANTY!!!!!!!

I raise the point because I am finding more people confusing &quot;storing&quot; versus &quot;backup&quot;. If the WD held just the backup copy, so what if it crashed? You are justified to be po'd at WD and you have to buy a replacement, but you haven't lost any files.
3351	28	303193	2825836	2824202	WalterinLouisiana	8/3/08 1:21 PM	1.21776966E12	Back up Storage	I use several methods to back up my files, which includes data, tons of pictures and a limited amount of music. I originally was backing up to a Desktop that I set up to function as file server so that my data was in two places. Then I purchased a WD 250 gig portable hard drive a while back and was primarily backing up to it but then realized that the back up was only as safe as the place that it was kept. The portable harddrive is connected to the file serve and is in the same office where I land after coming in from working in the field. The threat of fire or theft made me realize that if either happened I was up you know what creek and it didn't matter about the paddle. So I've signed up for Carbonite and now back up everything to the hard drive on the file server which that folder is backed up consistentaly to CArbonite. I then do a monthly or biweekly back up to the portable hard drive. Recently I've seen a device which is similar to the partable hard drive that comes in 1, 1 1/2, and 2 terabite sizes that acts both as a back up but can also be accessed directly from the internet with proper protections in place from anywhere you have internet access. The networkable device may be my next purchase. The increased size and the ability to go online from anywhere and get what I need if I forget it at the office sounds like a great deal fro less than $300.00. Would love to know if anybody has any experience with a device like this. Thanks Walter in Louisiana

I had a hard drive go out on one of the Computers and it took me around 45 minutes to restore it completely. It was like there never was a problem. It also allows add ins for additional services as well as a built in remote access for family and friend to access pictures and other files if given permission.

The HP MediaSmart Server (EX470/EX475) takes the worry out of data protection by automatically backing up all of your important media and other files. Designate folders are copied automatically onto multiple hard drives for an additional layer of redundant protection. It utilizes file/disk mirroring rather then RAID. Restore individual files or an entire PC hard drive in the event of a hardware or software failure. Four internal hard-drive bays, four USB 2.0 ports and one eSATA port for storage expandability (over 9 TB). Easily expand capacity with off-the-shelf SATA drives installation doesnt require tools or cables. The HP MediaSmart Server EX470 provides a central location to keep all your files for easy access and provides the capability: 1) Centralize and share your files and media across your home network. 2) Remotely access files on your server and run applications on your home PCs from any internet-connected computer. 3) Stream photos, music and videos to PCs on your network or to your TV or stereo system. 4) Automatically copy iTunes music libraries from family members' PCs to the server for streaming. TIP: Purchase the EX470 and add your own additional 500GB SATA2 drive(s). It remains the more cost effective purchase.

Yearly back ups onto DVDs of essentially all user files, including new photos and music, mostly at home but a current one at a friend's house. 3. All current user files saved on a Seagate Free agent Pro, which also gets weekly Nero backups. 4. Most user files saved on-line at Mozy. Having had two HDD failures, I'm glad I had backups.

What brand is your external hard drive, and why not two for different types of backups--music, photos, and important files. My wife had her Money file on my laptop that fried, and while I did a backup of all files and folders, they became corrupt and I lost everything--photos, important files, and music--many that cannot be replaced. Q1. What software do you use to back up your music to a DVD, and what kind of a DVD burner do you use? Q2. What is pbase.com? Many thanks for the reply. Thomboy

I have the 320 GB size and it measures a very compact 4.75&quot; x 3.75&quot; x 0.50&quot; (approximately). The two things I like about it, as opposed to the similar (and similarly recommended) Western Digital drive are: - it has a 5 year warranty - it has useful software, especially the tool to let me define which directories need files in them backed up as soon as they change, without waiting for a time interval, specific backup time, or manual request to do a backup.

Unlike me, his hard drive has not needed to be formatted, but he has thousands of .jpg photos to backup that cannot be replaced. We will both look at the Seagate Freeagent Go as a preferred option. Thanks again. Thomboy

Also have a smaller SimpleTech portable drive that I remove from bank safe deposit box, update, and return to bank prior to travel. If we are home and a hurricane hits, just take the laptop and backup drive connected to desktop and go. If we are away and catastrophe takes place, we have the drive in bank vault. Have already scanned all important legal docs, medical records, etc. Still in the process of scanning balance of historical family photos and articles, etc. so that we don't lose any documentation and have all the scanned receipts of household purchases for insurance and replacement issues. Hope this info helps someone else. Thanks for the forum.
