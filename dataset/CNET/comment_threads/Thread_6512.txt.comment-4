Fans provide two important functions, disapate heat and air circultation.
Without fans, heat build-up will in short order destory or stress-out the system until failure of some sort.
Basic fan(s) provide suitable work, but having an extra or installing to an open fan placement hole or slot is just added insurance.
These are the case fans, to not include the already present(if so done) video, power supply, and cpu fans.
Thus fans provide simple yet effective low-cost solution to handle heat.
