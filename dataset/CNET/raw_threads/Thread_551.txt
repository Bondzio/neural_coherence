My only issue is occationally I need the land line to dial up a modem at work to connect to a computer that is not on any type of network. Is it possible to use my DSL internet connection to connect with this modem and still leave the modem connected for dial up functionality?

We placed another machine (a PC) at a location with dial up connections. We then would run VNC (see google!) to that machine and do the dial up from that machine with our machine controlling the remote PC. As you can imagine the setup is fairly technical but proved it could be done. Bob
