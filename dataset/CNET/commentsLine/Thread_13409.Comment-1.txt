i went to fry's electronics today and bought a gateway fx6801-01 desktop computer.
i got it home and it would not boot up.
i took it back to fry's and they opened it up and looked inside.
this is what that found.
no cpu!
and the 9 megs of memory had been exchanged for 3 megs of memory.
fry's would not exchange it.
arrrgghh!
!
