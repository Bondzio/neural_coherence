<s> I am a graphic designer for a small organisation running a windows network. </s>
<s> I am using a pretty old computer at the moment and they would like to update me. </s>
<s> I usually use a Mac, and am not sure how to go about finding an appropriate PC for my functions. </s>
<s> I will generally be running Photoshop, Illustrator and indesign all at once as well as the other standard office applications to run email and word processing. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I need in a PC, Monitor and or laptop. </s>
<s> I do pretty much the same thing as you and the i7 processor is excellent. </s>
<s> I use Adobe CS5 with no slow downs no matter what I throw at it. </s>
<s> Also get at least 6 gig of Ram. </s>
<s> Mine has 12 gig, but I think that is a little overkill. </s>
<s> Mine is Tri Channel Ram. </s>
<s> I know there is a debate about tri channel being no faster or better than the duel channel, But I disagree with that. </s>
<s> As for the monitor, get a 22' or bigger LED monitor. </s>
<s> They throw off very little heat and have a better picture than the LCDs. </s>
<s> Also get a good graphics card in the computer. </s>
<s> For the little added expense, you won't be sorry. </s>
<s> Thanks for that advice! </s>
<s> Trinmo </s>
<s> Hope it helps. </s>
