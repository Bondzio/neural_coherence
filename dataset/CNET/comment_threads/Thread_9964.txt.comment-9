I brought my &quot;Samsung SP0802N 80GB&quot; hard disk in july 2004.
Thats about 4 years back.
What is the approx warranty of this hard disk, do you know?
I went to the samsung site but there they are asking for some PIN or Serial No.
along with the model name &quot;SP0802N 80GB&quot; which I don't know as I threw away the box a long time back.
