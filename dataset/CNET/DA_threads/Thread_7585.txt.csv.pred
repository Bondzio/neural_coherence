1.1.1	I'm breathing some life into an old computer we have.	St
1.1.2	It's a no name brand put together by a local computer store no longer in business.	St
1.1.3	I took off the cover and saw 1 Samsumg 128mb chip w/ 2 empty slots next to it.	St
1.1.4	The number on the chip is M368L1713CT1-CBO.	St
1.1.5	Is it possible to increase the memory to something like 4gb?	St
1.1.6	What are my options?	St
1.1.7	Thanks.	St
1.1.8	Ed.	St
1.2.1	The chip # is M368L1713CTL-CBO.	St
1.2.2	Here's the description Description = M368L1713CTL 16Mx64 DDR Sdram 184pin Dimm Based on 16Mx8 ;; Density(MB) = 128 ;; Organization = 16Mx64 ;; Bank/ Interface = 4B/SSTL2 ;; Refresh = 4K/64ms ;; Speed = A0,A2,B0 ;; #of Pin = 184 ;; Power = C,l ;; Component Composition = (16Mx8)x8 ;; Production Status = Eol ;; Comments = - Hopefully this helps.	St
1.2.3	Thanks.	St
1.2.4	Ed.	St
1.3.1	So now I realize that I have to identify the motherboard to know how much ram it will accept.	St
1.3.2	To be continued.....	St
1.4.1	So I found out what the motherboard is and located the manual online.	St
1.4.2	There are 3 memory slots which can take up to 1GB per slot.	St
1.5.1	These folks have a ram find it tool........might be worth a shot.	St
1.5.2	http://www.crucial.com/index.aspx	St
1.6.1	revision # if indicated.	Sug
1.6.2	What you provided sounds like the chipset name vice the MB brand series and mfg.	St
1.6.3	If the PC runs ...there are system utilities that can give you most if not all the info.	St
1.6.4	If the system runs and you can get to the internet, then the Crucial.com with the system test may work too.	St
1.6.5	VAPCMD	St
1.7.1	I ran a program that identified the motherboard, so now I'm confident about what ram I need to get.	St
1.7.2	Unfortunately from everything I've read, Win98 doesn't run very well with more than 512mb, but 768 can be used with a MS workaround.	St
1.7.3	Can I mix a 512 stick with a 256 stick, or do I need three 256's to make the 768??	St
1.7.4	Thanks.	St
1.7.5	Ed	St
1.8.1	options might be ?	Ques
1.8.2	Here's a forum on CNET that addresses questions on Win95/98.	St
1.8.3	Might be worthwhile reading before buying more RAM.	St
1.8.4	VAPCMD	St
1.9.1	Thanks VAPCMD, I appreciate the crucial suggestion.	Polite
1.9.2	I went to the site and they didn't list my motherboard.	St
1.9.3	I ran this utility http://www.majorgeeks.com/Evonsoft_System_Info_d4871.html and it told me what my motherboard is.	St
1.9.4	I also looked at the motherboard and saw what chipset was installed.	St
1.9.5	I went to the VIA site and located the manual for the board and it confirmed what I was looking at.	St
1.9.6	Mainly the 3 ram slots.	St
1.9.7	I'm only increasing the ram to 768, which is what Win98 is comfortable with, even though the motherboard will take up to 3GB.	St
1.9.8	When I get the computer online, I will go to the crucial site and run the test anyway to see what it says.	St
1.9.9	Thanks.	St
1.9.10	Ed.	St
1.10.1	If you get on the Internet with Windows 98, you're going to be highly exposed to viruses and other malware because it's been unsupported for years and thus is lacking a ton of needed updates to patch vulnerabilities.	St
1.10.2	You're also going to find it very difficult to find software that runs on it.	St
1.10.3	If you have some old games you want to play on this dinosaur, that would be OK, but I sure wouldn't want to try going online with something that outdated.	St
1.10.4	Save your money and get a new computer or tablet.	St
1.10.5	Good luck.	St
1.11.1	wpgwpg, Thanks.	St
1.11.2	I hear what you are saying.	St
1.11.3	Clamwin supports Win98, but I realize it's only for scanning, not real-time.	St
1.11.4	This is my wife's old computer from when her first 2 kids were young and yes, she has alot of games on it that won't run on anything later than Win98.	St
1.11.5	We are resurrecting this computer for our 5 year old as a first computer.	St
1.11.6	So we might go online a little, but it's mostly for the games she wants to use.	St
1.11.7	No skin off my back.	St
1.11.8	Only spent $4 for an ethernet card, $2.36 for a cable, and $4.95 for a memory upgrade.	St
1.11.9	It's been fun messin' with it.	St
1.11.10	Like you say, if I want to spend any real $ on it I might as well get a new computer.	St
1.12.1	NIL	St
1.13.1	with an updated OS, more RAM, more disk space, etc.	St
1.13.2	is often a good way to go.	St
1.13.3	VAPCMD	St
