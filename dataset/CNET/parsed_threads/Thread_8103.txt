<s> I have a compaq evo with a 40 gig drive and a dvd rw drive. </s>
<s> Recently I reformatted the drive. </s>
<s> It has one primary partition and the fat 32 file system. </s>
<s> The machine will boot to the c drive, but will not recognize the dvd drive. </s>
<s> I get an invalid drive spec message. </s>
<s> I need that drive to install windows from the cd. </s>
<s> When I boot from the hard drive, I get a message asking whether I want to boot from the HD or the DVD. </s>
<s> Is there something else I need to do to get the machine to recognize the DVD? </s>
<s> I'm looking at your posts and can't tell if this is the same machine or if you tried what the former responders offered. </s>
<s> It's not good to start new thread/discussions without telling it all. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
<s> This is a different machine, one of 10 compaq evos I bought in a lot. </s>
<s> The first machine had a problem recognizing the hard drive. </s>
<s> This machine will not recognize the dvd drive. </s>
<s> When I boot to the hard drive and try to switch to the dvd, I get an invalid drive spec message. </s>
<s> Not telling the full story. </s>
<s> I reread a few posts and nowhere did you reveal that you had 10 units. </s>
<s> Best of luck and try to make better posts. </s>
