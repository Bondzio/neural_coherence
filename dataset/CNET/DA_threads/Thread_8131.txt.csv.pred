1.1.1	actually , I can change the resolution , but the monitor is not displaying it properly .	St
1.1.2	For example , I try to increase resolution from the default 1280x1024 ( it 's a Dell 20 inch widescreen lcd ) instead of the image on screen getting smaller , the size of the display gets larger ... it expands beyond the physical boundaries of the screen .	St
1.1.3	That is to say , the functional area of the desktop increases in pixel width and height while all the elements on the screen stay the same size .	St
1.1.4	So when I move my mouse to the edge of the screen , instead of a hard stop , the display scrolls .	St
1.1.5	This behavior is really bugging me .	St
1.1.6	I do n't want the screen to scroll around , I want the objects on the screen to get smaller so I can see more stuff at the same time .	St
1.1.7	Does anybody have any idea why this is happening and how to resolve it ?	Ques
1.1.8	The display is attached via dvi-d to my IBM laptop ...	St
1.1.9	I do n't have any other connection available .	St
1.1.10	TIA .	St
1.2.1	The native resolution of a Dell 20 & quot ; E207WFP is 1680x1050 and that 's the highest res it will display .	St
1.2.2	Sounds like you 've got a desktop panning feature turned on either via your graphics card or some 3rd party add-on .	St
1.3.1	to find out how to set the resolution required by the wide screen monitors .	St
1.3.2	Usually its not in the standard lineup , however they provide a procedure on how to revise the driver setting .	St
