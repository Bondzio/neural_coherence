They would like to have wireless internet for their customers in the dining room so i ran a cat 5e line from the modem to the first Belkin router and everything works fine. Its an open connection so anyone can come in and connect with their laptop. From there i ran from port one jack to another Belkin router also in the ceiling for the owner. She wants this one to be secure so no one can access her files or laptop. I put this one as &quot;access point&quot; and secured it with a 128 bit wep key. Now for some reason as an acces point i can connect with my laptop using the network key, (i'm using xp) but we can not get her laptop (vista) to connect. It sees the signal when you &quot;veiw availble wireless connections&quot; but it won't connect. Strange thing is, when i use that router (#2) as a regular router instead of an access point we can all see it as available but no one can connect, not even me. This lady is very nervous about her signal and wants her part to be secure, she even had me hook up her all in one to the secured router so she could print/fax wirelessly over her secured router. Any ideas why i can connect to the secured &quot;access point&quot; with my laptop but we can't connect with hers?

Read about POST 17 in our forum sticky about how to configure a router as a WAP. 3. Think about the firewall in the router and try setting it to only allow PORT 80 traffic. That locks these connections to WEB content only. It also cures an issue with freeloaders using it for TORRENT connections. And please consider that the forum sticky is the top post in this forum. We put it there so you can find out the most asked questions without having to ask. Bob
