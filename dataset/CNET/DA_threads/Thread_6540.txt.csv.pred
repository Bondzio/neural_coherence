1.2.1	Is your goal to learn how to build a PC or to run a web page ?	Ques
1.2.2	Example .	St
1.2.3	Our web server for close to 10 years was some Pentium 100MHz with 64MB RAM running an older NT Windows .	St
1.2.4	It had an 8.4GB hard disk and served up the web pages just fine .	St

1.2.7	Read http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_ ( software_bundle ) Bob	St
1.3.1	Nah , I 've built several pc 's I just thought that servers had to be more powerful to keep a site up .	St
1.3.2	OBVIOUSLY NOT ! ! !	St
1.3.3	I am hoping to learn to run a web page though .	St
1.3.4	Is LAMP totally free ?	Ques
1.4.1	I did n't see where you said & quot ; I want a LAMP based distro & quot ; .	St
1.4.2	I guess if it was free you 'd already have it !	St
1.4.3	Do you know of any setup that is totally free ?	Ques
1.5.1	Yes , I have a few LAMP servers .	St
1.5.2	But since web serving takes so little oomph we look for low watt systems .	St

1.7.1	# 1 Trick Question ?	Ques
1.7.2	A PC can be a server , as R. Proffit stated , but dedicated servers have multiple , powerful processors , lots of RAM , numerous fast hard disks often in a RAID 5 array , and very fast NICs .	St
1.7.3	# 2 See Above .	St
1.7.4	# 3 Apache is a free web server .	St
1.8.1	Ok , thanks .	Polite
