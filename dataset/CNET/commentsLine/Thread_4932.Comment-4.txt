hi, there is nothing much i can tell.. my computer has been working for a while.
of course, i have donwload some utilities softare like advance window care,avg & other small utilities to help up my work or to make my computer work better.
however, during the process, the computer is getting slower instead.. this is typical experience of working under window xp.
window 98 has less of this problem.
moving from one screen to another is getting very slow.. i am working on ibm thinkpad x60 with window xp professional sp2.
peng tea
