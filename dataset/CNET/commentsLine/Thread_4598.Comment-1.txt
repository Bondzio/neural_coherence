we have a wep-secured wireless router, connecting a desktop running windows xp via a wireless usb adapter (netgear) and a laptop running vista also connecting via wireless.
both systems connected to the internet without difficulty.
attempted to connect an additional desktop also running windows xp and tried to connect via wireless usb adapter (belkin).
both desktops crashed and now have bsod and will not re-boot.
laptop is fine.
has anyone else had this problem?
any help regarding possible causes and solutions will be greatly appreciated.
thanks much jmny
