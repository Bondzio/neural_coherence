<s> Hi I plan to replace my Comqaq 5 year old computer soon.I have a fairly new video card (nvidia)and DVD/CD-ROM (Sony)that I have installed. </s>
<s> I would like to save them for future use.Is it OK to save them in a plastic zip bag? </s>
<s> If not, what else? </s>

<s> Go to your local pc fix-it shop and request a couple of esd/anti-static bags. </s>
<s> They have a trash can full of those things, so if they want more than a couple of bucks.....leave. </s>
<s> You could probably store them in a cardboard box, just ground yourself before you touch the things. </s>
<s> Thanks Will do. </s>
<s> I plan to buy the computer at combination new systems and repairs store Good idea Thanks Joe </s>
