Hi I'm looking at getting a QX6700 which I want to overclock to about 3.25Ghz.
Does anyone know which is the best CPU Cooler for the job as there's a big choice!
http://www.quietpc.com/gb-en-gbp/products/intelcooling gives a list of possible options including the Noctua NH-U12F, Thermalright 120 Ultra and Zalman CNPS9700NT but there are also others such as the cheap as chips Arctic Cooling Freezer 7 Pro.
Any help would be great!
Cheers
