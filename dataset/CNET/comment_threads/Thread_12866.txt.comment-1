I already know it makes it more accurate, but before I blow a hundred dollars on a mouse I want to know if it actually makes the game look smoother.
I just bought a new graphics card (GTX 560 TI) and couldn't help but notice that it looks a little jumpy when I slide the mouse.
When I run or aim I can tell that the games actually running a lot smoother than when I turn.
It also looks a lot smoother with a controller.
So can somebody vouch that their games got smoother looking after buying a higher DPI mouse... or is it just one of those things people like to brag about but it reality there's no difference?
