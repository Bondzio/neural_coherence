1.1.1	Right now I have two sticks of ddr3 1333 4GB.	St
1.1.2	I am thinking of getting two more sticks of ddr3 1600 4GB.	St
1.1.3	What I want to know is if I mix the two RAM speeds will my computer use both speeds equally, use the faster speed RAM first, or will it underclock the faster sticks to match the slower ones?	St
1.2.1	The bus speed drops to the lowest speed on the CPU bus.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Does that mean that the ddr3 1600 underclocks to ddr1333?	St
1.4.1	Im not on the geek squad..yet,but from wat i've seen,it defaults to the lowest MHZ....yes.	St
1.5.1	so would it be faster to have just the 8GB of 1600 or 16GB of 1333?	St
1.6.1	If I were to guess that GAMES or PHOTOSHOP then the 8GB wins.	St
1.6.2	If I were to guess some DATABASE in 16GB RAM then the 16GB wins.	St
1.6.3	The winner depends on the question.	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	file sizes you're running.	St
1.7.2	If the file sizes are small... the RAM over 4GB may never get used.	St
1.7.3	VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	I would go with the 16GB's...definitely.	Sug
1.8.2	Your doubling your memory,and only losing 1267mhz...i wouldn't think twice dmobbjr.	St
1.8.3	...but then again,i'm the guy who posted &quot;can i run two power supplies?&quot;.lol	St
1.9.1	I can't subtract apparently...your losing 267mhz.	St
1.9.2	My advice doesn't exactly instill confidence.lol	Ques
1.10.1	I am using this compute for gaming so it sounds like I should go with 8GB	St
