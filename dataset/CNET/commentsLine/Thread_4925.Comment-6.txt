to make any new system future proof you really need to go with a dual core.
with dual cores already becoming main stream and quad cores just around the corner, you can be assured that programs utilizing multiple cores will be flooding the market in the next year.
i just finished building a core 2 duo e6600 system and couldn't be happier.
i was originally going to go with and amd, but once core 2 duo's hit the market there was really no competition.
if you are looking to compare cpu's, look no further than tom hardware's cpu charts, they are incredibly helpful in determining how much bang you will get for your buck.
good luck!!
