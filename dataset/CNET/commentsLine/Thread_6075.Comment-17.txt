sometimes when computer boots up, it shows: &quot;harware monitor found a error, enter power setup menu for details&quot;.
what is wrong with this one since you are kind knowledgable about this.
one thing about this computer is sometimes it will just don't show nothing at all.
i mean first when i turn on the power, the monitor shows blank.
and then, i disabled the power cord, next time when i turn it on, it shows the above message.
i tried to fix it by reinstall the windows xp os, but it freezes when it was copying from the cd-rom.
if there is any guessing about this without the complete system specification (i don't have the computer any more), i would be appreciated if i could learn from this.
thanks
