<s> My Nook Tablet shuts down on me while playing word games. </s>
<s> Has anyone else had this problem. </s>
<s> Do you know if this problem is inherent in the tablet? </s>
<s> But yes, when it gets about 2 years old and with folk that use it daily I expect these to need a battery but I can't tell from the information whether this applies or not. </s>

<s> My tablet will be 2 yrs. </s>
<s> old around Feb or Mar of 2014. </s>
<s> This problem started a few months ago. </s>
<s> Since I have B&N insurance, I have turned in my original tablet two times for the same tablet with a later manufacturing date. </s>
<s> Still have the same problem. </s>
<s> I do use my tablet on a daily basis. </s>
<s> Would you suggest going to the newer model of Nook or try another manufacturer. </s>
<s> I think B&N is leaning toward blaming me with doing something wrong. </s>
<s> Model #BNTV250A, software version 1.4.3. </s>
<s> I know, inconvenient but it's just a test run. </s>
<s> Then report this to the app's author. </s>
<s> Android is the new Windows. </s>
<s> Lots of issues still. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I can say it might be because of the battery !!! </s>
<s> replace you're batter .... </s>
