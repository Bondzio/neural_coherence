<s> I have a Dell Dimension E510 with the original 160GB hard drive. </s>
<s> I would like to replace it with a 1TB Seagate hard drive. </s>
<s> Is this possible or will I need to replace the processor, etc to handle this size? </s>
<s> Any help will be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Just tell if it's a SATA or IDE drive. </s>
<s> Many discover this after the change. </s>
<s> Visit the Dell support website and under support enter your s/n or order# and whatever they suggest to enter and proceed to find out the day it was build what was put in. </s>
<s> If unable to determine, then be sure to at least open case, look at the physical HD to see what it is, IDE or SATA type. </s>
<s> Then as already suggested by Robert order the new replacement that of similar type. </s>
<s> Most HD vendor provide thier own support for their products and they will provide some details of adding the new 1tb HD problems that may arise, so review the Q&A/help files on the topic. </s>
<s> I strongly suggest you make a working backup of your current HD. </s>
<s> On this matter, typical vendor HD s/w provided will transfer(mirror image) just like the old HD was setup as, then remove old HD and use new HD alone. </s>
<s> As for 1tb replacement, I see no issue here, it should work. </s>
<s> I do suggest you look-up(review) for any bios updates from Dell and what they do update or address, they *maybe* needed to proceed. </s>
