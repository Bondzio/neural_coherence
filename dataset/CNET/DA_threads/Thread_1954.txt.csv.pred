1.1.1	I have a Packard Bell computer that is running on Windows 98 and has Lite-On CD-ROM LTN301, 64 MB RAM, IDE HDD, NEC Floppy.	St
1.1.2	It was given to me as a gift because the former owner just bought a much newer PC.	St
1.1.3	I have been trying to figure out what is wrong with the CD-ROM drive.	St
1.1.4	Everything works fine except for this drive.	St
1.1.5	Whenever I put any type of disc into the drive it will not run automatically, so I go into My Computer and double click the D: drive.	St
1.1.6	It will not load this way either.	St
1.1.7	It just displays the error message: &quot;D: Not Accessible; Device is not ready.&quot; Does anyone know how to fix this.	St
1.1.8	Is it software or hardware related etc.?	St
1.1.9	Thanks in advance for any replies.	St
1.2.1	and driver is installed?	St
1.2.2	then if in there then check connection physically, check inside the case and connection is established correctly.	St
1.2.3	if not then just buy a cd-rom drive.	St
1.2.4	they r relatively inexpensive	St
1.3.1	Your computer will usually give you that message because it cannot read the CD usually it is because the disk is dirty or scratch if not it is probably because the laser lens is dirty to clean the lens insert a lens cleaning disk and follow the instructions it gives you	St
