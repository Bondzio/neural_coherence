The p4m800 is many years old so for now my advice is a good cleaning, replace all heatsink compound, check fans and if the PSU is over 4 years old, replace that with same rating but add 100 more Watts. The reason why is well discussed but given the lack of detail in this discussion I have to move to the usual answer for an old PC. Bob
