i don't really like hp's, mainly because of their high ink prices, and because they don't have individual ink cartridges on any of their models.
my last hp printer constantly kept on running out of just one of the 3 colors, and i had to replace the whole thing.
i personally like the rx600 from what i've seen at the store, its good image quality makes up for its slow printing speed, but it has many bad reviews, and it seems to me that a lot of other people find many problems with it... that has stopped me from buying it
