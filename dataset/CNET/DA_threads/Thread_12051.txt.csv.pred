1.1.1	Sorry thats a pun ... my query is about memory , i currently have 1 stick of memory in my machine - Kingston 256mb 333Mhz DDR PC2700 - What i 'm confused about is the 333mnz and the PC2700 parts , i 'm looking for more memory but i 'm not sure if i need to buy the same i.e PC2700 and 333mhz , can i mix and match ?	Ques
1.1.2	for instance the one i 'm looking at is 512mb 400Mhz PC3200 , will this have any effect .	St
1.1.3	Rnning : P4 2.4Gb and XP Pro .	St
1.1.4	Thanks Goofs	St
1.2.1	Well the answer is yes and know If you do indeed get different memory they might play together and they might not .	St
1.2.2	Through past experience this is the case .	St
1.2.3	If they do they will run at the slower of the two speeds , if they do n't you have spent $ for just the 512 which should run ok on your machine , maybe .	St
1.2.4	I hope this helps and I do n't seem like an idiot but this is just the way it works with memory .	St
1.2.5	SO for my $ I would match the memory .	St
1.3.1	The easy answer is there is no easy answer to your question .	St
1.3.2	Your best bet is to match what you have now but you can always refer to your mainboad specs for a better answer .	St
1.3.3	If your computer did n't come with a mainboard manual it 's usally possible to look up the manual on-line .	St
1.3.4	Simply open up your computer and scan the motherboard for a manufaturer name and model number then do a google search or visit the manufacturers website .	St
1.3.5	If there does n't appear to be a manufacturer name or model number look instead for an FCC ID number and go to the FCC ID website and type in the ID numbers for your mainboard .	St
1.3.6	You should be able to figure out who made your board and where their website is located from such a search .	St
1.3.7	I can tell you from experience that most newer mainboards require matched memory in banks .	St
1.3.8	For instance if you have 4 memory slots slots 1 and 3 must be a matched pair while slots 2 and 4 must be a pair also .	St
1.3.9	Though this varies from one manufacturer to another .	St
1.3.10	My current Asus A8N-Sli mainboard is really picky and not only requires matched pairs but only seems to work with certain brands of higher end memory .	St
1.3.11	The Asus website has a list of all the memory that is known to work with my board so I try to stick to that list .	St
1.4.1	I should probably mention that just because a computer came from Dell or Gateway or whoever that does n't mean it 's mainboard was manufactured by them .	St
1.4.2	In fact I do n't think any major computer retailer makes their own mainboards .	St
1.4.3	They usually buy them in bulk from companies such as gigabyte or soyo .	St
1.4.4	Most decent mainboards will be marked with a manufaturer name and model number or FCC-ID .	St
1.4.5	I have run across a few mainboards without any identifying marks at all , not even an FCC-ID .	St
1.4.6	In this case you 'll have to contact the system builder to ask them for specs on the mainboard .	St
