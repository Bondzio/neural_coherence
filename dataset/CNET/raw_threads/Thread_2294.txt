I would say share the folder and then access the computer by typing ''\\&lt;computername&gt;'' in the run dialogue. Personally for security reasons I would say go buy a cat5 link cable (my mind went blank can't think of the name of this cabling specifically) but its a slight increase in price and it allows you to directly connect two computers for the transferring of files etc, connects through an ethernet port btw. Hope this helps..
