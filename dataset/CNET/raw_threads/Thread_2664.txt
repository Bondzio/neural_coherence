As you can imagine it is precious stuff we don't want to lose! Looking through various sites on the internet, I am not clear on what the most robust and reliable storage mechanism is. Some considerations: 1. Internal vs. External: I know Internal is cheaper, but which is likely to last longer? 2. Docking Station for Internal Hard Drive: a friend recommended this, but my concern is won't the Internal Drive degrade if you either: (i) leave it sticking out of a docking station; or (ii) continually insert it and remove it. 3. External Drive with Enclosure: is this worth considering, and how would it compare with (2) for longevity and reliability? 4. RAID solutions: have read a bit about data redundant solutions, but have no real idea how to set this up. What would I need and how would I set it up? Thanks in advance for advice!

A single copy on one drive or even two copies on the same drive no matter how reliable fails folk all the time. RAID is interesting with the DROBO (see google) but is no cure for having no backup. If you can't lose them, get two drives and keep them synced. Here I have 3 drives that I sync but then I really don't want to lose my stuff. Bob
