1.1.1	I recently got Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 : Platinum , and sometimes ( especially at night , with the fireworks ) , it keeps freezing .	St
1.1.2	This happens regardless of how large the park is or how much activity is going on , whether it 's 100 customers or 1000 customers in the park moving .	St
1.1.3	I 'm thinking it 's because of my graphics card , and I 've considered upgrading it .	St
1.1.4	Windows Vista says it 's because of the MJPEG codec , which apparently is the audio and video content .	St
1.1.5	I have a Dell Dimension E521 with AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 3800+ 2.00 GHz , 2GB RAM , NVIDIA GeForce 6150 LE .	St
1.1.6	Is it because of the graphics card that is causing the problem ?	Ques
1.1.7	Around how much and how difficult would it be to upgrade it ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	While it 's a fine choice in the value PCs it 's not your best 3D solution .	St
1.2.2	Try it with the case cover off to sniff out if it 's heat and consider finding a real 3D card .	St
1.3.1	is your pc freezing ( non responsive , you have to restart ) or crashing ( blue screen and/or restarts on it 's own ) ?	Ques
1.3.2	quote : & quot ; vista says & lt ; i & gt ; it 's & lt ; /i & gt ; because of the mjpeg codec & quot ; .	St
1.3.3	what & quot ; it & quot ; are you referring to ... the freeze/crash ?	Ques
1.3.4	codecs ( COmpressor DECompressor ) are not directly related to the video card unless they support hardware-assisted video acceleration .	St
1.3.5	regardless , here 's what i suggest you do : 1 ) install the latest nvidia drivers using the scan feature of this site : http : //www.nvidia.com/Download/ScannForce.aspx ? lang=en-us .	Ques
1.3.6	if that fixes the issue skip step 2 .	St
1.3.7	2 ) roller coaster tycoon 3 was released long before vista and is not designed for vista .	St
1.3.8	you can either install this codc package for vista : http : //www.afreecodec.com/2059/advanced-vista-codec-package/ or configure roller coaster tycoon to run in XP compatibility mode : http : //www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-compatibility-mode/ .	St
1.3.9	one or the other may fix the problem or both may be necessary .	St
1.4.1	Only the program crashes , not the actual computer , and there has never been a blue screen of death .	St
1.4.2	Vista says the MJPEG codec is the reason for the crash .	St
1.4.3	I 'll try to download the codec package to see if it might work , otherwise I 'll consider upgrading my graphics card .	St
1.4.4	Will all graphics cards work on my computer or can I only buy a select few that are compatible ?	Ques
1.4.5	Thanks in advance .	St
1.5.1	so you can upgrade to new card .	St
1.5.2	but a codec provoked crash will probably not be cured by a new video card .	St
1.5.3	it 's a software problem , not hardware .	St
