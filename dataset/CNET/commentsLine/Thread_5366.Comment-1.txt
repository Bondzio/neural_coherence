ok, so it is not starting up, i think my problem lies in the front panel connectors, i think i am connecting them wrong.
the name of the connector that turns on the computer is called 'm/b sw' which is something i havent seen before, no matter where i plug it, it wont work.
it will not give a sign of life.
if you really need to know my specs here they are: intel core 2 duo 2.8ghz 2gigs ram 1 stick 500gb green power hard drive.
9800gt 1gb.
300w psu.
i am pretty sure i connected everything right.
this is very frustrating as it is my first build and i thought it was going to be simpler than that, anyways this is why i am posting here.
any help is appreciated.
