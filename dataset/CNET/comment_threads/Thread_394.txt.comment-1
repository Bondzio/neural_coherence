hi there-- I have two machines with SOYO 6BA+ motherboards in them, I am finally done with various projects I needed them for and can do maintenance on them.
Both motherboards seem to be working fine, but I have the original non-updated BIOS's in both.
Should I flash them or leave them alone?
thanks - fj
