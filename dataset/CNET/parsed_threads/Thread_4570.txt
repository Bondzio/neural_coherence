<s> &quot;Today, ATI has some really great cards. </s>
<s> You would be hard pressed to outstrip their 1GB video cards in SLI mode.&quot; Two corrections: 1) ATI doesn't make Radeons with 1GB VRAM. </s>
<s> I think one of the FireGL models has 1GB, but no Radeons. </s>
<s> nVidia has one card with 1GB RAM, the 7950GX2. </s>
<s> However, it's actually two PCBs, each with their own GPU and memory. </s>
<s> 2) ATI's dual-GPU solution is called CrossFire. </s>
<s> It IS possible to have CrossFire on an nForce SLI board, through driver hacks, though. </s>
<s> Right now, the best SINGLE grahpics card you can buy is the Radeon X1950XTX. </s>
<s> It's already been reviewed by the hardware sites, and it's coming out later in the month. </s>
<s> Look for it on newegg in the coming weeks. </s>
