1.1.1	WinXP Pro 2002 SP3 .	St
1.1.2	I installed new SAMSUNG 502IJ HD two partitions .	St
1.1.3	BIOS recognizes as 502Mb but WINDOWS as 912Mb , second partition as unformatted even if it was formatted and some data poured in.Please help	St
1.2.1	but you said BIOS shows 502Mb and Windows as 912Mb .	St
1.2.2	Is this just a typo or what you see ?	Ques
1.2.3	If you created 2 partitions , you should see 2 different drive letters .	St
1.2.4	Is that the case ?	Ques
1.2.5	If you have more than one partition , your BIOS is still only going to report the HD full size and not that of the partitions Windows sees .	St
1.2.6	Perhaps you did create a 912Mb partition on the 502Gb drive .	St
1.3.1	BIOS shows 502Gb but WinXP Disk Manager shows four partitions H:155Gb ( works OK ) G:421Gb ( I transferred about 120Gb but now shows unformatted by My Computer - and here lays the problem ) and two more partitions without letters the first 310Gb ( free space adnotated by Windows ) and a last partition no letter 1.99 Gb .	St
1.3.2	The issue I cna't format G : because I shall loose the data .	St
1.3.3	THANK YOU so much for your answer ! !	St
1.3.4	!	St
1.4.1	But you know that .	St
1.4.2	It comes to almost 700GB on a drive with a model # that shows it as 500Gb .	St
1.4.3	Instead of using explorer , look at what disk management says .	St
1.4.4	It will list by partition with drive letter and also show a crude map of your physical drives .	St
1.4.5	That map will contain partition information for each drive and will also show any unallocated space .	St
1.5.1	Hi Steve , the disk I bought was a used one and badly formatted ( I was n't told ) .	St
1.5.2	I recovered all my files ( I found a lot of others not mine either ) and got free a new HD who works fine .	St
1.5.3	Thank you for your help ! !	St
1.5.4	!	St
