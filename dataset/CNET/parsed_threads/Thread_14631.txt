<s> Just bought a new EVGA e-GeForce 7900 gs video card. </s>
<s> The card requires a minimun 450w with +12 volt current rating of 22 amps. </s>
<s> I currently have only a 400w with 16 amps. </s>
<s> My system is a Gateway DX430X. </s>
<s> Core2 DUO 2.13GHz 3GB DDR2 SDRAM 500GB 7200rpm SATA DVD/RW 52x CD ROM PCI sound card PCI modem 1 to 2 devices running on USB ports Keyboard/mouse Tower fan CPU fan Will a 500w be sufficient? </s>
<s> Or should I go with a 550w or even higher? </s>
<s> I dont want to go to high, but I dont want to go to low either. </s>
<s> or a proprietary PSU...one made for a GATEWAY ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Practically all psus posted for sale show their specs to review. </s>
<s> Check those out and then pick besides cost you can live with. </s>
<s> If you decide to pick cheap, then expect cheap results over time. </s>
<s> I tend to buy a good brandname and offering dual fan cooling along with wattage and rail volts(depends) required. </s>
<s> Also, a good rule of thumb is the stable and dependable output on a constant basis is 75% of rating, others may quote higher than that, but 75% is a safe bet. </s>
<s> A decent 500W+ psu should suffice for your needs provided a generic psu fits in your Gateway. </s>
<s> Check out http://www.geeks.com and others, FYI, got the Logisys(575W) psu for $39, recently and does well. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> it lasts. </s>
<s> By the way, what's your criteria for a 'good brand name'? </s>
<s> $39 for a 575W PSU sounds too cheap to be something I'd want to put into more than a minimum system. </s>
<s> Looking at the web below makes we wonder why you 'recommend' the Logisys http://www.overclockers.com.au/wiki/Power_Supply_Unit#Trusted_Power_Supply_Makers VAPCMD </s>
<s> the video card's power supply rating is a rule of thumb and is based on peak draw in a fully loaded system (which few people have). </s>
<s> i have a friend with the same model gateway and the same video card. </s>
<s> just keep your current power supply and only replace it if you have problems. </s>
<s> p.s. </s>
<s> here's a chart on actual power draw of a pc with a core2 x6800 (3ghz) and various video cards: http://techreport.com/articles.x/10715/9 </s>
<s> Many of the PSU makers listed(at supplied link) didn't even exist as psu providers a few yrs. </s>
<s> ago. </s>
<s> Even those that were a few yrs. </s>
<s> no longer are or don't provide what has become a leader. </s>
<s> Coolmaster as an example didn't make psu or at least under thier own bage, but rather fans and heatsinks. </s>
<s> They grew and now offer psu but even so, may not be of their own manufacturing factories but rebadged psu from another provider. </s>
<s> That is very much what has become of some psu suppliers. </s>
<s> Thermalke as another example wasn't around suppling psu but is a big player now. </s>
<s> Also, some brandnames may fail when pushed too, but they seem to provide a tolerance far above true cheap units and that's to include real(dependable) build-in safety features. </s>
<s> As for my recommending Logisys, it has proven so far to deliver the goods. </s>
<s> At the same time, I don't make a point of testing batches of psus but can certainly recommend what has worked for me. </s>
<s> Sounding cheap and finding a good bargain at the time and when previous offering were higher priced of the same model. </s>
<s> I did mentioned, to look at the specs and find other vendors. </s>
<s> You can look at http://www.pcpowerandcooling.com and see if many jump to pay those prices, even though they're very very good. </s>
<s> I don't have a minimal system and the Logisys is doing well. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> the better quality PSUs and then recommending a total NO NAME that turns up on someone else's NOT RECOMMENDED list. </s>
<s> Except for some PSUs that came with cases many many years ago, I always use Enermax, Antec, Fortron-Source, Seasonic or most recently Corsair. </s>
<s> Leaving my main system on 24-7, I want something very very reliable. </s>
<s> Whether it's luck or just better quality stuff I've never had a PSU failure in over 20 years of building, upgrading and repairing PCs. </s>
<s> Knock on wood and keeping my fingers crossed too. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I don't want a pissing contest, but it seems I provide/pass info as best experienced knowledge in &quot;good faith&quot;, take or leave it as the forum provides. </s>
<s> The FYI on Logisys was just that. </s>
