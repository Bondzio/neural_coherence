hi, i have a hp photosmart c5180 printer, and a few weeks ago it started having issues.
it wouldn't print at first, so we would turn it off and then back on, and then it would print.
then after a few days, that quick fix didn't work and it wouldn't print at all.
i tried the suggestions from the troubleshooting manual - disconnect from pc, power, etc., then reconnect again, and that didn't work.
i removed it from the pc and just plugged it in separately to a different outlet to see if it would work on it's own, and it doesn't.
i have to remove the power cord entirely to turn it off.
when i leave it plugged in, the printer just continuously tries to restart itself without success, then shuts down for a couple seconds, then tries to turn on again.
i would try a different power adapter/cord, but it's not a traditional cord that i can just use a spare one to connect to the printer.
it would cost more to service this printer than it's worth, so i just wanted to check here and see if anyone had similar issues or know of a fix.
thanks for any feedback!
