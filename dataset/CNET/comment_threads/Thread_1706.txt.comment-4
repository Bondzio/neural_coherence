It is a T2642, and I was away from home for about a week.
We had a power outage at some point during that time.
When you push the power button, there are no signs of life.
The guy I brought it to works from his house.
I may spend the $60.00 and bring it to Geeksquad.
If it's the motherboard I can probably get a good price on newegg.com.
