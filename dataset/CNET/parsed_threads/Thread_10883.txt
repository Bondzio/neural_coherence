<s> I am a Graphic designer and need a new computer. </s>
<s> I currently have a G4 Power PC with version 10.3.9 installed and i tried to upgrade it again because i cannot afford a new computer. </s>
<s> Doing some research I found out that i cannot upgrade to leopard or use the new CS3 programs as they are not compatible to 10.3.9 . </s>
<s> I create Graphics for print ,web and 3D .What does someone recommend since Price is the issue . </s>
<s> i was looking at the Apple Power Mac G5 - PPC G5 1.6 GHz ,Apple Power Mac G5 (1.8GHz, 256MB RAM, 80GB HDD),Apple Power Mac G5 - PPC G5 2 GHz,Apple Mac Pro Dual-Core Xeon 5150 2.66 GHz. </s>
<s> The others look used and won't run the latest for the same reason. </s>
<s> So that gives the Xeon as the only one to choose from. </s>
<s> so you dont think that i can buy a G5 and add leopard to it. </s>
<s> The xeon is almost $2500. </s>
<s> Do you recommend something else? </s>
<s> ?What do you think i can get for $1500 or less that will be powerful enough for 10.4 or more and for the latest adobe software Thanks. </s>
<s> I was going to buy an iMac so I did plenty of research on it. </s>
<s> It comes pre-installed with Leopard so that shouldn't be a problem. </s>
<s> Every review I read on the iMac raved about its features and ease of use. </s>
<s> If I were to buy any Mac at all it would be the iMac. </s>
<s> What's your budget? </s>
<s> The iMac is essentially a mainstream system unless you configure it with all top of the line components. </s>
<s> Here that fetches me a very nice and new Intel based iMac. </s>
<s> Can you share why you are looking at old machines? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I called apple store and they told me that i should look at the Imacs or i can do leasing on the new 8 core workstation. </s>
<s> Not sure . </s>
<s> I know the imacs come with leopard. </s>
<s> I have a new keyboard and monitor so i was looking for just for a tower. </s>
<s> but that may be the way to go </s>
<s> The listing of those G5's is confusing. </s>
<s> Those haven't been made for a very long time. </s>
<s> The new intel iMacs are not 1500 and are very fast. </s>
<s> Why not a nice fast machine? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I went to the Mac store today and the sales guy told me that i should base my decision on what i can afford . </s>
<s> I decided i am going to get an Imac for now and then in a year or two when i have more $$ i will invest in the Mac Pro.I am going to research and see if i can sell my G4 and get something for it. </s>
<s> Plus i just applied for a Mac Visa credit card and well see if i am approved. </s>
