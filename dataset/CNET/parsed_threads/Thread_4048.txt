<s> I recently bought a new external hard drive (Seagate) with a NexStar case. </s>
<s> It shows up in &quot;Device Manager&quot; but not in &quot;My Computer&quot; or &quot;Disk Management&quot; which means i can't partition it or anything. </s>
<s> I've tried using the installation CD, but that didnt do anythin. </s>
<s> I tried a program Discwizard but that kept telling me to reboot over and over. </s>
<s> If you could help me, It'd be greatly appreciated, thanks! </s>
<s> Im trying to run this on my Windows XP Laptop. </s>
<s> ...and format with NTFS (not FAT32). </s>
<s> Could you please tell me how to format? </s>
<s> A few people have pushed me in that direction but i never knew what to do. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> You did state that you couldn't see it in Disk Management. </s>
<s> Try Disk Management one more time and INITIALIZE it: http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000588.htm If that doesn't work, I'd install the hard drive as a secondary drive in my desktop. </s>
<s> Then, try initializing it in Disk Management again. </s>
<s> If that fails, try SeaTools from Seagate.com. </s>
<s> This is where you need to have RAM.. </s>
<s> I would hope you have at least 512 MB's of RAM.. .. </s>
<s> When you do your START-UP..do not connect the HDD/ Just start the LAPTOP..let it reach its Desktop/ RUN DSKCLEANUP..and Defragmentor../ .. Now Plug the USB in.. .. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work..I would check my PIN-assignments.. be sure the HDD is useing CABLE-Select[CS].. which means you need to OPEN the External Enclosure.. and view the rear of the DRIVE for the PIN-assignments.. .. You may want to visit the SEAGATE website..... and read some INFO on your Drive. </s>
