i have a 160gb and an 80gb maxtor in my system both making a loud fast clicking sound much like a geiger counter.
i had a frend tell me that maxtor drives were loud so i put this down to being the price you pay for a cheap drive, however having thought about it after reading this post i think you may be onto something with the drives being deffective.
in my home there are 3 other systems using maxtor drives 2 only use 40gb drives so i put the lack of noise down to them being so small, but the other uses an 80gb and there is never any noise coming from it.
however i would not worry to much about it if i were you i've had my pc for 2 years and the the 80gb the whole time, its never failed me (except when i murdered my mbr with linux but thats another story and wasn't too difficult to fix, thank god for fdisk) anyway the 160gb is only 6 months old and still covered under warranty so it it fails i'll get my money back.
i would recommend getting another manufacturers drive and maybe pay a little more, it'll be worth it in the end.
maxtor is to sony as gola is to nike (dont worry if you dont know what gola is thats the point)
