aftet u get the fan/heatsinks, i would overclock it to a steady oc, maybe 375 core and 500 memory and leave it at that.
thats a big increase already and i dont think the card will last very long even (1-2 years) maybe with fan and heatsinks.
and then u can purchase a new computer as everything will be outdated already.
