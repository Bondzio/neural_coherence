i researched machines with an eye towards reliability, cost and customer service.
after reading countless reviews on cnet adn seeing comparisons, i chose the e machine.
it fit within my very spartan budget, does what i need it to do and so far as a wannabe mr. wizard on computerese, no problems.
however, the customer service bragged about in reviews is less than the stellar in mho: my issues with my cd burner and drive door with an, &quot;oh well.
whatever you want to do&quot;, attitude.
seems that companies still don't get that consumers have a choice.
and they talk.
lee, maybe a discussion on customer service needs a new airing?
blessings, dina
