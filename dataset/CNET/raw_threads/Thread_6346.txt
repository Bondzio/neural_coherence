I'm not sure if that's what they are called but basically I am looking to hook up a couple of external hard drives to a wireless network. I also plan on attaching a printer as well. I have found dedicated printer servers, but haven't been able to find just a usb one. I know of a couple wireless routers that have usb ports built in but that will be a last resort. Thanks for your help.
