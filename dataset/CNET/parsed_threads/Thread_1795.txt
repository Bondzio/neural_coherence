<s> I am looking through this list of the best wireless routers http://reviews.cnet.com/best-wireless-routers/ ... and I am wondering if there is any real difference in the performance of the router itself, or, if the difference in price is a function of the ease of setup/configuration, &quot;smart&quot; features, etc. </s>
<s> So, what is it? </s>
<s> Will all n routers perform the same? </s>
<s> If you mean do they all pretty much have the same signal levels and such yes they are pretty much the same. </s>
<s> There are only a limited number of chips used for the radios mostly because it is a government regulated thing and few companies want to deal with the all the governments around the world. </s>
<s> About the only thing that is different is the antenna placement in the units, many times which is a trade off in the appearance of the unit compared to the performance. </s>
<s> It mostly does not matter since difference between people houses mean much more than the difference between the routers. </s>
<s> In controlled lab conditions these reviews can show some differences. </s>
<s> They tend to make it seem like a big deal but fail to explain why these differences may or may not be significant in a real world installation. </s>
<s> Since 802.11n has been around for a long time (at least tech wise) most major manufactures have optimized their equipment so there is little difference. </s>
<s> Some of the unknown brand though may not be as good quality. </s>
<s> The router I saw for $5 at the dollar store I have been tempted to buy just to see how bad it was. </s>
<s> As a prior poster stated for most practical purposes...not a ton of difference, as stated N series routers have been the standard for a while. </s>
<s> Wirelessly most laptops incorporate an N antenna as opposed to the older b/g variant, is there a difference? </s>
<s> Wellllllll it depends and for the most part for the average user, I'd say no. </s>
<s> Wireless is one thing, hardwire is another, wireless operation can vary from here to howdy for a bunch of reasons (so can hardwire) but wireless, more. </s>
<s> Signa for wireless, is pretty critical and can vary considerably depending on proximity, impediments, such as walls, metal, etc. </s>
<s> Hardwire hook ups can vary too for a few reasons but bandwidth drain, basically too many users in service/server area, is probably the most common cause. </s>
<s> For hardwire hook ups some use 10/100/1000 net cards (gigabit) against an N(gigabit) series router backed by a high end Docsis-2 or 3 modem and run Cat6 cable(s) instead of Cat 5. </s>
<s> But is it really worth it? </s>
<s> Welllllllll that depends, and here we go again. </s>
<s> it is almost like a revolving door. </s>
<s> Geez, I have to run down to the local Dollar store to see if they have a 5 dollar router, I would definitely get one just for giggles to give it a shot, might be interesting and sort of fun..uh maybe...but I am gonna look... </s>
<s> If you really just want a cheap router, you can find then for close to nothing online or when you ask around, post a note at the supermarket, etc. </s>
<s> People get new routers when they move or get a new internet connection, or when they change providers, etc. </s>
<s> I used a wireless router that I rescued from the dumpster when my grandma died and the (rented) house had to be cleared out. </s>
<s> I used it as a 'bridged' router for some time, so I had WiFi in the garage and garden. </s>
