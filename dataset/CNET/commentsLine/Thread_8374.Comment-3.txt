ok, so about 2 days ago i was using the computer and it was taking ages to load pages so i grabbed my windows 7 home premium 64bit and restored it, before this the adapter was working, i think the reason it stopped was becuase i didnt unplug it, anyways, when i got done restoring i installed my graphics card drivers and restarted and then tried installing the adapters drivers and it finished, i plugged the adpater in and nothing.
so i tried once or twice again to install the drivers and still nothing.
and i went into device managers to check if it was showing up, which it was but with the yellow sign beside it and 3 other universal serial bus things.
the motherboard in the pc is a asus f2 a85 series amd a85x chipset the graphics card if that matters is a evga gtx 650ti and the processor also if that matters ia an amd quad core
