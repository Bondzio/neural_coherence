<s> I got a used desktop, and have a number of upgrades I would like to make to it. </s>
<s> But first I have to get it running. </s>
<s> When you push the power button, the power button comes on but the hard drives are not spinning and the display does not change, not even to show the BIOS. </s>
<s> I think this may be either the motherboard or the graphics card. </s>
<s> Does anybody know which? </s>
<s> Sorry, but you gave no clue of the system details and all that. </s>
<s> Its best to provide as much as possible otherwise, expect more questions just to get at a starting point. </s>
<s> Remove all connections to drives. </s>
<s> Now power-ON, what are the results? </s>
<s> Is there now a display of any system respose NOT the display's own lost signal message or similar? </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I didn't think the specs would be relevant, so could you tell me what you need? </s>
<s> I tried the hard drive thing before I posted this. </s>
<s> but there is no bios. </s>
<s> Specs: MS XP Home, computer is a Gateway, It says the model no. </s>
<s> is Atxaeg, graphics card is a nVidia 8860. </s>
<s> Let me know what else you need. </s>
<s> Since you think the specs are irrelevant then the answers may be irrelevant to this machine. </s>
<s> To save volunteers from asking this question and having a post 20 entries long before we can get down to work, why not help others help you. </s>
<s> Remember these are member to member forums, no paid staff so make it easy. </s>
<s> Thing of the person who wants to help you change your flat tire. </s>
<s> They ask you to point to where the flat is and you tell them it's not important. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I don't think that is an accurate analogy. </s>
<s> I don't need to know how to fix it. </s>
<s> I was just asking for a second opinion of what was broken. </s>
<s> There is no need to chew my head off for being mistaken. </s>
<s> I wanted to share that these forums are all volunteer, all member to member. </s>
<s> Which means you get to try a little harder. </s>
<s> No paid staff also means that a few members get upset over &quot;tech support.&quot; I apologize for my analogy but I have many more to choose from. </s>
<s> But let's get back to YOUR discussion. </s>
<s> All that I wanted to share I have, now it's time for you to decide if it's worth helping others help you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> But let's cover a common no boot spins drives issue. </s>
<s> Many forget about that little battery on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Some motherboards will not boot when that the battery voltage is too low. </s>
<s> This is why details matter. </s>
<s> I can't tell if this machine is known to have that issue. </s>
<s> Make it easy on others with machine details otherwise you get guesses and maybe bad ones. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm not looking for free tech support. </s>
<s> You seem to think this is the first time i've looked at a computer. </s>
<s> The make of my motherboard is an Intel Desktop board D850mv </s>
<s> But when we want to talk about a machine, it's best to know what it is. </s>
<s> Leading off with the above can send folk away from helping out with ideas. </s>
<s> While you seem to want to debate this, why not go with the forum flow? </s>
<s> Just put in the details so others won't run away. </s>
<s> http://pixel01.cps.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/cs-009007.htm gives a second idea. </s>
<s> This board may also exhibit this issue with a not-so-good power supply or that adapter Intel writes about. </s>
<s> Details are needed, a Volt Meter on that battery is a good idea. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The light on the motherboard is green, so I don;t think it is the power supply. </s>
<s> Voltage test got the promised three volts </s>
<s> http://pixel01.cps.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/cs-009007.htm gives us more about what or why the PSU can cause a failed boot. </s>
<s> Let's say you want to troubleshoot a dead PC. </s>
<s> The tried and true method is to remove all but the PSU, motherboard, CPU+HSF and the Speaker. </s>
<s> If those parts are good then the speaker sounds in protest of all the missing other parts. </s>
<s> If not, we are staring at the last 4 possible parts. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I posted to remove all connections to all drives. </s>
<s> This way it releases the power burden for that and if those devices actually hold back the boot in h/w manner. </s>
<s> Plus, if the display changes, it gives a clue. </s>
<s> Since you have a Gateway system which is OEM but no model#. </s>
<s> The model# is on a decal or sticker somewhere on the system along side the serial#. </s>
<s> I don't recall a Atxeag model, sorry. </s>
<s> Certain models may have proprietary PSUs or give a clue to the age of the system. </s>
<s> In no uncertain terms, it maybe too old/unique to find replacements or deal with as costs may factor in. </s>
<s> Regardless, that is very important to me to ask as now I know to search for specs and such at support websites. </s>
<s> Upon visiting the Gateway support website, enter the serial#, should give clue to day1, when it was build what it consisted of. </s>
<s> In most cases where a system won't power-ON, then simply replace PSU with a similar or greater wattage unit. </s>
<s> If it still doesn't work, then deal with the mtrbd.. At this time reduce the system to bare minimum to help progress. </s>
<s> An old system as Robert stated, replace the bios battery as they don't last forever. </s>
<s> Also, the LED that's on the mtrbd. </s>
<s> is NOT a real clue solver other than to say, yeah there's SOME power, but a PSU supplies various voltages and amps, etc. </s>
<s> if one fails it all fails. </s>
<s> Sorry, if seemly I ask dumb questions, but from my prospective, there are no dumb question when getting to the nitty-gritty. </s>
<s> I did a quick google of atxaeg and found some users don't know the support website has any info. </s>
<s> Which makes me think this maybe a foreign model or somehow, unique system. </s>
<s> Further, the atxeag also may have additional numbers to narrow down the system model#. </s>
<s> ie: http://www.fixya.com/support/t2402546-need_set_up_ram_gateway_atxaeg_lx3_700s ie: http://forum.servomagazine.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=14858 BTW, if the mtrbd. </s>
<s> is at fault, then do you want to even try to fix it. </s>
<s> Far too often replacing the mtrbd. </s>
<s> is best due to cost and/or time involvement, FYI. </s>
<s> I hope this all helps, come back with results. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
