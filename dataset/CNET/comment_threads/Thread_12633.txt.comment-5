I have also found reports of this (and other problems) with iTunes 5.
I have searched for version 4.9 but the couple of links I have found to this version have been &quot;disabled&quot; with the message that posting the earlier version violates Apple's software terms and conditions or some such &quot;anti user&quot; tripe.
I appreciate your reply and information but I think I (and others) may need to ride this out until Apple releases a new version correcting such problems without admitting they exist.
