<s> I have a Laptop 'Toshiba M45 S331' that came with xp home. </s>
<s> I had to install win 2000 for job purpose. </s>
<s> Now I cannot find the driver for the Ethernet controller (Marvell Yukon 88E8036 PCE-E fast Ethernet Controller) anywhere. </s>
<s> Called Toshiba and they don't support it for win2k. </s>
<s> Checked on Marvell website and they don't seem to have it either. </s>
<s> Laptop also has 1394 Net Adapter which is also without driver. </s>
<s> Could anyone pleas direct me to the right path...Thank you.. </s>
<s> Install a PC-Card adapter. </s>
<s> I've found such for as little as 5 bucks so you can buy your way out of this one. </s>
<s> Ignore the 1394 entry as it's not ethernet. </s>

<s> there is no Win2k driver for your NIC if the manufacturer does not list one. </s>
<s> TWhen a new device is developed, they do not always write drivers for older OSs. </s>
<s> You should be able to find a PCMCIA ethernet adapter for which there is a Win2k driver -- if you have that slot available. </s>
<s> I would expect, however, that a driver could be found for your firewire. </s>
<s> After all, that was around when Win2k was a pup. </s>
<s> Hope this helps Frank </s>
<s> I have the same problem with a Toshiba M55-S329. </s>
<s> I put an old 3COM card in the PCMCIA slot and the network came up correctly the first time still using the xp home edition. </s>
<s> It took me about 3 hours of searching the net for the driver before finding this formun entry. </s>
<s> Now if I can only get Ghost to work using the 3COM card in the PCMCIA slot (different problem), I will be happy and can migrate back to W2K. </s>
<s> Even if I do lose a couple of ports... Al </s>
<s> So I got myself a PCMCIA card and I am in bussiness. </s>
<s> great, thats all i needed and thanks for your help...but am very disappointed with Toshiba.. </s>
