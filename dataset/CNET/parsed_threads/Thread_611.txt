<s> I have a Dell Dimension 4700 minitower in which I would like to upgrade the video card and add a DVD burner. </s>
<s> The existing p/supply is 305 watts and my reading leads me to believe I need a new p/supply of 350w or larger. </s>
<s> I am using Windows XP SP3 and use the pc for email, general office work, and web surfing (no gaming). </s>
<s> I have maxed out the RAM to 4GB and the drives include a floppy drive, a 500gb SATA hard drive and a DVD-rom drive and CD-burner. </s>
<s> The only p/supplies I have seen specifically for the 4700 are from KDM. </s>
<s> Can anyone give me any info on this company or recommend any other power supply units I should take a look at? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I have a Dim. </s>
<s> 4700 & have installed an Antec 500 watt PS in it. </s>
<s> Some good brands are Antec, PC power & colling, Corsair. </s>
<s> Just make sure it is ATX type an it will fit in your case without a hitch. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory.aspx?SubCategory=58&name=Power-Supplies </s>
<s> Should say PC power & cooling </s>
<s> SeaSonic is also good. </s>
<s> When you find one you want click on the specification tab & it will say if it's ATX type or not. </s>
<s> here's a high quality PSU by Corsair that will serve you well. </s>

<s> fingerlid, Do you know the model you installed? </s>
<s> Most of the PSU's I'm seeing online have the fan on top of the psu and that won't work with the 4700 minitower case I have. </s>
<s> Fan would have to be at the back or front to be able to pull air thru the psu. </s>
<s> I have the ANTEC EARTHWATTS 500 ATX 12V v2.2 Couldn't say if they are still producing that model or not? </s>
<s> Here's my PSU. </s>

<s> The one that VMAC posted will also work. </s>
<s> The fan intake would be on the bottom next to your green cpu shroud & would exaust out the back of your case. </s>
<s> fan is on the bottom when installed ... not the top. </s>
<s> Plus the Corsair has a 5 year warranty vs the Antec 3 year warranty. </s>

<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Actually IMO the Corsair would be the better choice. </s>
<s> If you buy a high quality PSU you will be able to pull it & install it on your next new computer as long as it has an ATX case. </s>
<s> A top quality PSU is always a good investment. </s>
<s> It should last for years. </s>
<s> After reading reviews for both I would buy the Corsair. </s>
<s> The reason I bought the Antec was I needed one quick & bought it at Best Buy. </s>
<s> The Antec is good but not as good as Corsair. </s>
<s> All good to know. </s>
<s> What about PC Power and Cooling? </s>
<s> I found a Dell replacement p/supply they build at 500w meant for the 4700 (PPCS500D). </s>
<s> I like the idea of it being set up for Dell, but also like the idea of taking out the other mentioned p/supply(s) later. </s>
<s> However, I probably won't be replacing this machine for at least 3 years, so don't know if the portability is a big deal. </s>
<s> One thing - can I buy direct from PCC? </s>
<s> Anybody know? </s>
<s> The list of vendors on their site who supposedly carry their products is long, but every site I tried doesn't even mention PPC as someone they carry. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> and the Corsair ($65 after MIR), PSU quality and that the PCP is not available 'til Feb 01 at Newegg or elsewhere.... makes the Corsair look even more attractive. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> The Corsair has 30 amps on a single 12 volt rail whereas the PC power and cooling one only has 26 amps on it's single 12 volt rail. </s>
<s> The Corsair has 33 amps on the +12volt rail. </s>
<s> I am going to check the measurements on my existing p/supply and go with the Corsair if it fits. </s>
<s> Thanks to the posters for all info and insight provided. </s>
<s> I'll be back to let you know how things go. </s>
