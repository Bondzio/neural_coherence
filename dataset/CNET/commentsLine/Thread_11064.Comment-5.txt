that means that my sole defense is the software firewalls in each device connected to the internet, then, right, and the extra benefit of the router's firewall is simply gone?
well, at least i know.
still, i'll dig into the configuration details on the 4500 when i get it up and running.
right now, i'm waiting on my cat6a cable to arrive.
i'll probably go ahead and run the coax this weekend so that everything is almost ready to plug and play when the ethernet cable arrives.
thanks again, bob.
