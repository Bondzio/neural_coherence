recently i purchased this lcd monitor from bestbuy due to some sale going on.
i was wondering if this has hdcp support since the website says nothing and neither does google (i can only assume for now that either it doesn't or this brand is bad).
as mentioned in my previous topic, i plan to hook my ps3 slim to a lcd monitor, either this or my acer x203w but i have to confirm that either one of these has hdcp support for ps3 slim.
thanks in advance for the anticipated help.
