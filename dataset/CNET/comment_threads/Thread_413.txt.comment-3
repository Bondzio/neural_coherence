Using theirs would be fine.
They don't make one.
We are talking about something that plugs into a parallel port and connects a printer to an ethernet network.
I had one that connected through the Appletalk port, but no longer works because of Snow Leopard.
if you know for a fact that Apple makes one, I will be as delighted as surprised.
