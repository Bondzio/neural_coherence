this morning i booted up my pc and the keyboard, mouse, wi-fi and sound card do not work.
i have checked the bios and all usb functioning is correct.
when i load my windows recovery disk both my keyboard and mouse work.
so there is no hardware problem.
i have run start up repair many times with no success.
win7 will boot to desktop, but all devices fail.
i have renamed my c:/windows/info to ink bak, and replaced it with an info folder from my wife's working pc.
this did not work.
please help me
