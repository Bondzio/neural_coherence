1.1.1	I recently reinstalled Windows XP on my Dell Dimension C521 using a Windows XP installation disk .	St
1.1.2	I did not have any of the Dell installation CD 's .	St
1.1.3	I installed the drivers I downloaded from Dell before reading I was supposed to install them in a specific order , ( DSS Deskto System Software , followed by Chipset drivers , then other drivers ) .	St
1.1.4	I currently do not have any audio in the system , which I believe is a result of not having installed the DSS and chip-set prior to audio drivers .	St
1.1.5	I need to know how I undo what I have done .	St
1.1.6	Do I need to delete the audio drivers and then install the DSS and Chip set before reinstalling the audio drivers , or what ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thank you .	St
1.2.1	But I thought beyond drivers you also need apps like Dell 's Quickset to turn some items off/on .	St
1.2.2	Some folk forget that one .	Sug
1.2.3	Also , some machines need the MSUAA which is not always noted at dell.com Bob	St
