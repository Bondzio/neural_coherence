1.1.1	My PC's CD/DVD player has twice over the last couple of months made a noise like there's something loose inside the player when a CD or DVD is playing, and when I ejected it, a flat donut-shaped, gray foam/felt object that's exactly 1-3/8&quot; wide came out.	St
1.1.2	The 1st one looked like it had a lot of radial marks in it on one side, but the 2nd one was smooth on both sides.	St
1.1.3	The unit kept working after the 1st one came out, so I forgot about it, and now a couple of months later, the 2nd one has come out, but it's still working.	St
1.1.4	I have a 2002 Dell Dimension 4550 PC and the CD/DVD drive is a Memorex 16-X player.	St
1.1.5	Did these objects come from the player or did somebody put them there when I wasn't looking?	St
1.1.6	If they came from the player, is this a minor or major issue to leave them out, and if I need to put them back in, is there a link to a tutorial to guide me thru it?	St
1.2.1	If the drive is from 2002 too, then consider you got your moneys worth.	St
1.2.2	I would replace, ASAP.	St
1.2.3	The cost isn't that much and it may take out a precious CD you may like.	St
1.2.4	Anything coming/falling from a drive is bad news.	St
1.2.5	-OR- you could use it until it really poops out.	St
1.2.6	Its your choice, but again, I would replace it.	St
1.2.7	Also, if you have kids, are they into mischief?	St
1.2.8	If possible post a link with some pics of the items in question.	St
1.2.9	tada -----Willy	St
1.3.1	someone is pulling your legs, hehe.	St
1.3.2	But good luck, dvd drive are cheap.	Polite
