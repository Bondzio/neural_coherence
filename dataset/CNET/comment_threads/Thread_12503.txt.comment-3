sometimes it just happens.
Even on a machine that is set up correctly and has no problems.
Happened to me yesterday.
My explanation is &quot;Gremlins&quot;.
Have never found a good reason, and have learned to not tear my computer apart looking for one.
After closing Nero and rebooting, same exact settings make a good burn.
If it is more than a occasional thing, then look for a reason.
