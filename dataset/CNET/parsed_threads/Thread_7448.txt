<s> Hi, I have an old HP laptop that is running Win98 that I would like to hook up to my home theater system. </s>
<s> What I would like to do is xfer my mp3 files from my XP Home (SP2) desktop to my laptop, but I'm not sure how to do it. </s>
<s> The desktop only has CD/DVD R/W drives, the laptop only has a floppy drive,and it does not have a network card. </s>
<s> It's a real basic laptop with serial, parallel and ps2 ports on it. </s>
<s> I just remembered that I had the laptop and thought I could use it to store all my music files and easily hook up to my stereo system. </s>
<s> I'm a novice at this but am able to follow clear instructions. </s>
<s> If anyone can tell me if this is possible without having to spend a lot of money in parts and software, I would really appreciate it. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> If it doesnt it looks like you are completely out of luck. </s>
