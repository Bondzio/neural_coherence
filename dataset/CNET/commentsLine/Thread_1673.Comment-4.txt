&quot;when we setup any other vpn's from the main office the additional connection will connect but you cannot access anything on the remote lan..&quot; the entire concept of the vpn is to build a virtual private network.
those items on the remote lan are not in the vpn so they don't exist.
this is all proper and to break it so &quot;it works&quot; means the security of the vpn has been lost.
