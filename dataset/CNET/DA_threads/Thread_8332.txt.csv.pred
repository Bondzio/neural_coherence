1.1.1	I am thinking about buying an external hard drive to save mainly my music , pictures , and word documents .	St
1.1.2	I really do n't have anything else that important to back up or worry about .	St
1.1.3	But I have a few questions I ca n't seem to find an answer for .	St
1.1.4	1 .	St
1.1.5	If I buy a new external is it as simple as plugging in the USB and begin copying and pasting files to that drive ?	Ques
1.1.6	2 .	St
1.1.7	I have noted from other threads the external would not be safe from being infected with viruses and such and being completely wiped out .	St
1.1.8	Would simply unplugging the external drive when not in use protect it from the bugs ?	Ques
1.1.9	3 .	St
1.1.10	I can use the external to shuffle information between two computers right ?	Ques
1.1.11	( ie .	St
1.1.12	desktop in my dorm room and desktop at home ) I know this is a very basic and simple question , but I 'm a computer newbie and just overwhelmed with all the different ways of storing info .	St
1.1.13	Thanks for any help I can get .	St
1.2.1	1 ) Depends on the drive .	St
1.2.2	For some thumb drives it is that simple whereas I think for the external I have on my desktop I did do a few other things as this required its own power plug for an extra step .	St
1.2.3	2 ) For some yes , though others I 'd doubt it .	St
1.2.4	Part of this depends on when the virus or pest does try to wipe out the drive .	St
1.2.5	If it attacks when it is saved to a drive for example then it would be kind of hard to protect against that .	St
1.2.6	3 ) Yes .	St
1.2.7	I have done that with my external to move things between my computers .	St
1.2.8	Regards , JB	St
1.3.1	I have today purchased a Seagate 160GB USB 2.0 drive and it was as simple as pie to install .	St
1.3.2	Plug in the power lead , plug in the USB lead , switch on and Windows XP ( SP2 ) recognised the drive , assigned a letter , and I am good to go .	St
1.3.3	I am currently researching using it as my primary data drive ( I will continue to backup to CD / DVD of course ) and transferring the My Documents folder to it .	St
1.4.1	I use FOUR external Drives and TWO-USB Flash Drives.. .. What I have done was to upgrade my SYSTEM DRIVE ( C : ) and use that for my first External HD useing a External Enclosure KIT.. ..	St
1.4.2	I did purchase a 120GB MAXTOR for a System Drive and then went to a 40GB..then an 80-GB.. ..	St
1.4.3	Since I find the HDD not that expensive it was createing Externals that offered more PC experiance.. ..	St
1.4.4	I FORMAT my EXTERNAL Drive at a DEFAULT Allocation.. ..	St
1.4.5	I use NTFS File System always..	St
1.4.6	I have a 1-GB HDD that 's FAT32.. ..	St
1.4.7	I have wondered about the Purchase of a HDD that 's like ... ..300GB 's ... and wonder about RUNNING the Defragmentor Program..	St
1.4.8	Since mine are : 80-GB.. 120GB.. 40GB.. 1GB.. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .	Res
1.4.9	I figure I 'm getting faster results in Defragmentor.. and I can Isolate FILES/type..by useing just one Drive.. .. MAXTOR DiamondMAX-120 GB is for DV-files..WMV..DV-avi Files only/.. the 1 GB is a Quantom HD I found..its an MP3 File for WMP-11/.. the 80 GB is a SEAGATE Barracuda..its holding major AUDIO FILES..that are part of my VIDEO Movies.. ..	St
1.4.10	The 40 GB Western Digital WD400JB..is empty..and will also hold VIDEO Files.. ..	St
1.4.11	I have found no differance in accessing the FILES to a Digital Video Authoring and Editing Software Program..as compared to the SYSTEM Drive ( C : ) .	St
1.5.1	A few days ago a purchased a Seagate 160 Gb external USB 2.0 hard drive .	St
1.5.2	I did some speed and access time tests ( SiSoft Sandra ) which showed the drive was at least as fast as my internal drive .	St
1.5.3	I converted the drive to NTFS ( it comes as FAT 32 ) and then moved My Documents across from my C : drive ( about 80 Gb ) .	St
1.5.4	I have been using it for several days and have not noticed any degradation in performance at all .	St
1.5.5	The big advantage I see is that not only have a freed up a lot of space on my C : drive , I have all my data on an external drive which can be easily ported around if needed .	St
1.5.6	Obviously , I still carry out regular backups to CD / DVD as I have always done .	St
1.6.1	I recently purchased a USB external hard drive , my first .	St
1.6.2	I am running Windows XP with SP2 .	St
1.6.3	The HD is not a recognised Seagate or anything like that , it is a product called Freecom .	St
1.6.4	It came with full instructions for connecting to , formatting and partitioning , and assigning drive letters , so I followed those carefully , and everything went well .	St
1.6.5	1 ) Once set up correctly it is really easy to cut/copy and paste to the new drive .	St
1.6.6	You can use any of the explorers , eg My Computer , Windows Explorer , etc , and even File & gt ; Open to save files in any application .	St
1.6.7	2 ) As with any storage device connected to a computer , you need full protection from hackers , viruses , spyware and trojans .	St
1.6.8	Simply unplugging will protect the drive from an infection or attack , but if your computer is infected , the infection may spread when you next connect .	St
1.6.9	Beware , if you are using Windows XP or similar , it is not advisable to & quot ; just unplug/switch off & quot ; .	St
1.6.10	You should use the & quot ; Add/Remove Hardware & quot ; icon in the system tray near the clock to disconnect the drive before unplugging or switching off .	St
1.6.11	Otherwise you could damage the software connection between the HD and Windows .	St
1.6.12	3 ] As long as each computer has the same USB type , ( either 1.0 or 2.0 ) , you should have no problems .	St
1.6.13	Most newer systems now have USB 2.0 connections .	St
1.6.14	You should note that hard drives fail , whether they are internal or external .	St
1.6.15	When they do , it is usually catastrophic .	St
1.6.16	So do n't depend on your external HD as your only backup .	Ques
1.6.17	Use CD/DVD 's as well .	St
1.6.18	Mark	St
1.7.1	I run two identical desktops [ XP SP2 ] and have four external drives : One Maxor One-Touch II and three Seagate IDEs in $ 30 CompUSA cases .	St
1.7.2	In deference to what I have read elsewhere , I agree completely with castingRod47 : I have found no difference in the speed with which I can move , access , or edit data .	St
1.7.3	I 'm a photographer and work extensively in Photoshop CS2 .	St
1.7.4	Whether the image I am working on is on the C drive or one of the USB2 externals makes no difference whatsoever .	St
1.7.5	Regarding what MarkFlax said about disconnecting , I have never used Add/Remove Hardware when swapping a drive from one system to the other .	St
1.7.6	Most externals ARE plug and play and are designed to function in that manner , like a digital camera or card reader .	St
1.7.7	I just power down the drive on machine A , disconnect the power and USB connections and move to machine B -- with the Seagate/CompUSA drives I 've never had an instance where either system did not immediately recognize the drive .	St
1.7.8	The One Touch II is actually the most finicky and sometimes is not recognized immediately , which is why I use it exclusively for Retrospect backups on machine A. dg	St
1.8.1	Regarding externals being more vulnerable to attacks [ viruses , spyware , etc .	St
1.8.2	] , I have no idea what the concern is here : as long as your antivirus and other protection software is configured to actively scan all drives , there is no concern whatsoever .	St
1.8.3	I run AVG Antivirus plus Firewall , AdAware SE Plus , Spybot Search & Destroy , and Pest Patrol .	St
1.8.4	All of them scan and protect all of my drives because I configured them that way -- if you monitor a scan in any of these programs you will see the program access these drives and they will all alert you if something nasty is present .	St
1.8.5	dg	St
1.9.1	I just ordered a WDigital 250 S-ATA HD with an enclosure .	St
1.9.2	They enclosure supports usb 1.1 and 2.0 .	St
1.9.3	I will be trying to connect it to my Dell Laptop that is running windows2000 USB 1.1 ( I have a USB2 card . )	St
1.9.4	Will I have problems ?	Ques
1.9.5	I went to S-ata since I might upgrading a desktop that tend to you S-ata hardware .	St
1.9.6	I wanted to transfer some large programs from the LT to the external drive along with backing up documents and pictures I am not not technically savy .	St
1.9.7	I can do OK .	St
1.9.8	Thanks	Polite
1.10.1	I 've used external hard drives for a while , and they 're a great way to add extra storage without 'opening the box ' .	St
1.10.2	I originally bought my enclosure because it contained an HDD that was cheaper ( ! )	St
1.10.3	in the enclosure than it was by itself .	St
1.10.4	Since then , the price of drives have come way down , but having one in an external enclosure sure makes things easy .	St
1.10.5	About your first question : It really is as simple as plugging in the external power supply , powering up the drive , then the USB cable into an available port .	St
1.10.6	This can be done when the machine is already booted up and running , but you lose some functions .	St
1.10.7	I 've noticed that if I 'hot-swap ' the drive ( PC already running ) , I ca n't 'cut ' a file from the drive , only copy .	St
1.10.8	Also , your disk utilities will be disabled , like defragmenting and such .	St
1.10.9	If you plan on doing any maintainence to your external hard drive , make sure it is plugged in and powered up before you boot your machine .	St
1.10.10	As to your second question : A virus can and will most likely spread to ALL drives on your machine , unless you have a very sophisticated program that strictly limits access to that drive .	St
1.10.11	Your best bet is to use a highly recommended anti-virus program , as well as a firewall that is not set to the bare minimums .	St
1.10.12	Your anti-virus must be updated DAILY to make sure that you 're getting the best protection .	St
1.10.13	Also , as you 've read on other posts , having more than one program is a great idea , as one program may not have all the latest virus definitions .	St
1.10.14	It 's like having a second and third opinion .	St
1.10.15	The answer to your third question is 'yes ' .	St
1.10.16	This may be the # 2 reason why external hard drives are so popular ( # 1 being ease of installation ) .	St
1.10.17	You can transfer any number of files from one PC to the next , from laptop to PC , and just about any imagineable scenario , except from Mac to PC , or PC to Mac .	St
1.10.18	If you find that you are working on computers with different operating systems ( OS ) , you 're going to need some special software and a little expertise .	St
1.10.19	Just remember , you can 'hot-swap ' your external drive , but you will lose some functionality .	St
1.10.20	To have complete access to the drive , make sure it is powered up and plugged in before you boot .	St
1.11.1	& gt ; & gt ; & gt ; I 've noticed that if I 'hot-swap ' the drive ( PC already running ) , I ca n't 'cut ' a file from the drive , only copy .	St
1.11.2	Also , your disk utilities will be disabled , like defragmenting and such .	St
1.11.3	If you plan on doing any maintainence to your external hard drive , make sure it is plugged in and powered up before you boot your machine .	St
1.11.4	This is inconsistent with my experience working with any of my external drives .	St
1.11.5	I often hot swap with both machines running and am able to & quot ; cut & quot ; files all the time .	St
1.11.6	I also defrag all of the externals regularly , particularly because I move large amounts of data bewteen machines regualrly , w/no issues whatsoever .	St
1.11.7	I installed a new Seagate in a CompUSA case this morning .	St
1.11.8	Machine was already booted up when I plugged in and once I formatted the drive I was up and running .	St
1.12.1	What OS , PC model , and basic specs do you have ?	Ques
1.12.2	That info will allow us to provide the best answer .	St
1.12.3	1 ) For the most part , yes .	St
1.12.4	WinXP and Win2000 should already have the drivers available , so just plug , play , and transfer files over .	St
1.12.5	Win98 requires you to install drivers ( either provided from the retail box via CD or available online ) .	St
1.12.6	WinME , ditto , except since it 's not all that 's cracked up to be ( i.e .	St
1.12.7	in the end , it 's one of the poorest of M $ Windows OSes ) , it may not actually be compatible as I 've heard some stories go .	St
1.12.8	Just be sure to check the box or requirements for OS compatibility and what ports are used ( e.g .	St
1.12.9	firewire port ONLY ) .	St
1.12.10	AFAIK , some ext hd like Western Digital MyBook Premium edition requires extra utitility drivers for optional features like the external capacity guage light to work property .	St
1.12.11	2 ) Just make sure your AV app is up to date and up to snuff , and have it scan your external HDDs like you would with any internal HDD .	Sug
1.12.12	Common sense and caution concerning viruses , malware , and safe computing practices apply with ext HDDs as well , so doing that will keep you safer too 3 ) Make sure the following pan out : -both PCs have available connections to access the ext hd ( e.g .	St
1.12.13	one PC with USB1.1 , still works but slower transfer rates and another with USB2.0 .	St
1.12.14	Or , ext hd takes both firewire and USB , which is what each PC has ) -OSes used by each PC are compatible with ext hd -any required drivers can be put onto both PCs ( pendrives help with this ) -mind the hardrive file systems formats , mainly NTFS and FAT32 .	St
1.12.15	IIRC , NFTS is only used on winXP ( and perhaps win2000 as well ? )	Ques
1.12.16	as far as Win OSes go .	St
1.12.17	Since FAT32 can be formatted to NFTS on the fly , w/o requiring a clean reformatting ( and thus wiping all data ) of the drive , but not the other way around , you may not be able to copy files stored in NTFS onto a hardrive that 's FAT32 formatted .	St
1.12.18	To view how a drive is formatted , click on the drive in My Computer	St
1.13.1	1 .	St
1.13.2	Some , yes , some , no .	Res
1.13.3	When I got my 160GB HDD I formatted it to NTFS first just to be sure that it was in NTFS .	St
1.13.4	It will take a while ( that took me about 2 hours ) and more for larger drives .	St
1.13.5	2 .	St
1.13.6	If you do n't plug it in when the attack takes place , it is safe .	St
1.13.7	But the next time you connect it , some trojans or viruses may attept to enter the hard drive .	St
1.13.8	The best solution is to back up your data at least weekly , if not daily .	St
1.13.9	3 .	St
1.13.10	Yep , you can use the HDDs on both Windows and Mac to exchange data .	St
1.14.1	From what I know , if you connect a USB2.0 HDD to a USB1.1 port , it downgrades without a problem .	St
1.14.2	By that I mean it is still usuable , just that the data transfer rate will be reduced greatly .	St
1.15.1	The last point regarding transfers between Mac and Windows concerns me a bit .	St
1.15.2	In my earlier reply to the original question I said that you can use the drives on both Mac and Windows no problem and I have tried it on my school Macs .	St
1.15.3	Does that functionality depend on the drive ?	Ques
1.16.1	You can set the drive for either 'hot swapping ' so that you can unplug and plug in without having to go through the removing hardware option , but this slows the drive as no data is cached .	St
1.16.2	Or , you can set the drive for optimum performance .	St
1.16.3	I have done this as I never plan on removing the drive except in exceptional circs .	St
1.16.4	Hope this helps .	St
1.17.1	That 's another way to use the external .	St
1.17.2	I leave it as plug and play and power it on when I need to .	St
1.17.3	Unrelated question though , would keeping the hard drive spinning all the time prolong its life , instead of turning it on for 20 minutes weekly to do updates ?	Ques
1.18.1	It 's the # of miles you go with it , not the time .	St
1.18.2	However , I 've also heard it 's not good to powerup and down a hd in succession .	St
1.18.3	Let it wait 30s to 3min betw turning it or off .	St
1.18.4	I personally wait 2min	Sug
1.19.1	Ah the eternal question ! !	St
1.19.2	I personally subscribe to the view that it is better to leave a drive running ( most stress on bearings , motors etc when running up and down ) unless you are using it only once or twice a day , eg .	St
1.19.3	as backup , in which case I would power up / down as required ( also a much 'greener ' method of working ) .	St
1.19.4	There is also the thermal issue to consider - a constantly running drive will maintain a fairly constant temperature - aiding in prolonged life .	St
1.19.5	Hope this helps ... ... .	St
1.20.1	For example , the Western Digital MyBook Essential edition powers down automatically after 10min of inactivity .	St
1.20.2	There 's a utility to disable/tweak that feature , but IIRC , it 's only for the Premium edition of that product .	St
1.21.1	This is probably a very simple question but .	St
1.21.2	what is the difference between FAT 32 and NFTS ?	Ques
1.21.3	and why do you need to convert the external into to a NTFS format ?	Ques
1.22.1	http : //www.ntfs.com/ntfs_vs_fat.htm http : //cquirke.mvps.org/ntfs.htm for even more resources , just google NTFS vs FAT32 In more layman 's terms ... .	St
1.22.2	In most cases , you 'll want to have NTFS over FAT32 .	St
1.22.3	The former allows for smaller file sizes due to the way space is allocated , encryption , better security , compression , and larger hd sizes .	St
1.22.4	The only time a hd needs to be FAT32 is if you 're using an older OS that does n't allow NTFS ( listed on that link ) .	St
1.22.5	In other words , for example , win98 can NOT be installed on a hd with NTFS .	St
1.22.6	It just wo n't work .	St
1.22.7	Due to NTFS ' better security , you can change from FAT32 to NTFS on the fly w/o having to wipe clean your hd .	St
1.22.8	If it 's vice versa , then u got ta back up yur data first .	St
1.22.9	I have plugged in ext hd and flash memory pen drives which were formatted for FAT or FAT32 into my int NTFS hd just fine and data/files were read and written just fine , so it 's not a technical requirement .	St
1.22.10	Dunno if the flipside is true ( NTFS ext hd plugged into a FAT32 int hd ) .	St
1.22.11	However , I have experimented on my 4GB micro drive that when copying large numbers of smaller files , say & lt ; 30MB in combined total size , it takes 5min when the microdrive was FAT32 , while my int hd was NTFS .	St
1.22.12	When both were formatted for NTFS , those 30MB of 80+ photos took less than 30s to transfer over , so this is nice from a performance perspective .	St
1.23.1	Thanks everybody for the tips .	St
1.23.2	I think I 'll stick to running it once a week - it makes more sense to me that way , I suppose .	St
1.24.1	Hi , I hope you can help .	St
1.24.2	I am trying to help out a friend with XP .	St
1.24.3	He has 2 external hard drives on is a 500 GB Western Digital the other is a 1.5 GB Solo External Hard Drive Fireproof and Waterproof ... yeh a little over kill !	St
1.24.4	His computer is about 8 year old Dell ... it even has a floppy drive .	St
1.24.5	He saves everything !	St
1.24.6	His hard drive has almost no free space .	St
1.24.7	What I would love to do is set up his computer to save all his files directly to the 500 GB hard drive .	St
1.24.8	Not on his computers hard drive !	St
1.24.9	I was going to partition the 1.5 GB hard drive so there is a complete back up of his computer hard drive on the first partiion .	St
1.24.10	Also , I would love to sync his 1.5 GB second partition to his 500 GB hard drive ( which is actually saving all his files ?	Ques
1.24.11	Do you have any suggestions ?	Ques
1.24.12	I have figured out how to assign dirve letters .	St
1.24.13	I know how to partition .	St
1.24.14	I do n't know how to sync one hard drive to the other or automatically save files directly to the 500GB .	St
1.24.15	Note : I have backed up his hard drive right now to the 500GB .	St
1.24.16	Using windows back up .	St
1.24.17	He deleted the WD software of the 500GB !	St
