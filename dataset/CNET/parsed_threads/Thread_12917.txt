<s> Dear Fellow customers, I brought my mother a kindle for Christmas and I love it. </s>
<s> I took it out the box to check it out and it was great, I actually started to feel a little jealous. </s>
<s> She is a huge reader and lover of books which she passed down to me. </s>
<s> Her eye sight is starting to go a bit and I thought a kindle would be a great gift. </s>
<s> Now for myself, I have a Samsung Galaxy 7&quot; Tablet which I love. </s>
<s> It is the perfect size for me. </s>
<s> I know a lot of people like 10&quot; but 7&quot; is the perfect size to carry around and hold in my hand. </s>
<s> It fits in my smallest purse and since I got it in April this year, I have never left home with it. </s>
<s> And while I do read all my ebooks on my tablet or netbook , I do really like that e ink for the eyes. </s>
<s> But I do other stuff on my tablet besides read. </s>
<s> Checking emails, reading news, listening to music, watching videos, playing games, wed surfing video chatting. </s>
<s> I don't do any hard work on my tablet, it just for media use. </s>
<s> If I have to work, I rather use my laptop. </s>
<s> So after that long winded first paragraph( this why I don't post to boards to much, I am rambler and type like I am really talking to somebody, sorry but I am getting close to the end) So my request is a dual sided media tablet. </s>
<s> It does not have to done right know but maybe sometime in the future. </s>
<s> I can be very patient. </s>
<s> A lot of things are in existence now that 10 or 15 years ago, I would have never imagined being possible. </s>
<s> Now I know people are going to jump down my throat about it can't happen or it has been done already by the enTourage Pocket eDGe Dualbook Android Tablet and e-Ink Reader but that is not what I want. </s>
<s> I had my Samsung and the kindle laying side by side on my bed, and all I could think was how perfect it would if you could just combine the two together. </s>
<s> I know people are going to say just buy a basic model kindle and use that with tablet or if I am already using the tablet as a reader just stick with the tablet. </s>
<s> But I have really falling in love with e ink screens. </s>
<s> It would be so nice to have to best of both worlds. </s>
<s> Plus I am lazy; I don't want to carry any more than I have to. </s>
<s> On to the third paragraph ( I lied about being close to the end), my idea for a perfect media tablet. </s>
<s> I am not going to quote any prices for the device or service plans because whatever I say people will found fault with it. </s>
<s> So the enTourage Pocket eDGe Dualbook had a screen on each side, but I think the screens should be back to back. </s>
<s> So basically you would have something like the Samsung galaxy tablet or even the kindle fire on one side and when you flip it over on the other side you have a basic touch type e ink screen. </s>
<s> It would came with a very basic case, you could always upgrade to better one. </s>
<s> The case would open from right side or left side depending which side you wanted to use. </s>
<s> It would be able easily flip back either side. </s>
<s> The tablet side would be the latest android system (I am being greedy, I know) and be 8&quot; while the reader would be 7&quot;. </s>
<s> The reader would a touch screen that would still have page turning buttons on the sides. </s>
<s> 16 GB of internal storage, with room for another 16 GB to added though a media card slot. </s>
<s> Everything can also be saved in the cloud. </s>
<s> Add a camera, a microphone, stereo audio jack, and volume buttons. </s>
<s> It would have Wi-Fi and 3g. </s>
<s> Now before people start about the 3g, I don't expect it to be free. </s>
<s> Amazon first and fore most is a business. </s>
<s> It would have to lose their minds to offer 3g free for the type of tablet I am talking about. </s>
<s> Maybe amazon could find a way to be able sync to your current phone plan, or offer separate date plans from other third party companies. </s>
<s> My favorite idea would be to somehow link a 3g option with the amazon prime membership, and yes I know the price would go up and you would not be able to pay yearly. </s>
<s> People who want to add 3g to their amazon prime membership would have to switch to a monthly plan. </s>
<s> Now before I sign off, I want to say that I am not a techie or business person at all. </s>
<s> This is just the ramblings of one person. </s>
<s> I was making it up as I was typing. </s>
<s> I even have a name for it- &quot;Amazon now presents The Kindle Phoenix , an all in one media tablet&quot; So now after that long winded letter, I am finally done. </s>
<s> I told you I was a rambler, sorry. </s>
<s> I would like to see if anybody had any thoughts, comments or helpful criticism about my dream dual sided tablet. </s>
<s> It was missing too many things to be a serious Android tablet. </s>
<s> No multi-touch, no G sensor and the list goes on. </s>
<s> My died after a few months and the company is no more. </s>
<s> No doubt in my mind why. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
