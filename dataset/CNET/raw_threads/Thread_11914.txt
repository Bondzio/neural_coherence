5841	0	110729	1258167	NR	jeffrey p	6/22/05 7:25 PM	1.1194683E12	Scan Disk Question	I have a scan disk cruzer flash drive, and sometimes I can save to it and sometimes not. Sometimes I can move from my hard drive to it and sometimes not. I generally get the message that the directory of file cannot be created. I've got room on the disk, any idea what's up? Thanks.

The host machine may be NTFS which allows some name that isn't allowed on the SANDISK drive. Too bad you didn't share the gritty detail of the names. It's also possible to overflow the ROOT DIRECTORY of a filesystem. How many files and directories are in the ROOT? Bob

One name for a word document was &quot;discussion questions for films&quot; another was &quot;movie ministry.the incredibles.&quot; Do this help?
5841	3	110729	1258883	1258871	R. Proffitt	6/23/05 7:21 AM	1.11951126E12	Yes, those names could be illegal on said drive.	Try old short 8.3 names such as discussion questions for films becomes DISCFILM.DOC (if it's a document.) and &quot;movie ministry.the incredibles.&quot; MOVIEINC.DOC Bob

I have data stored on a ScanDisk cruzer mini 256MB, I can see it there and it will not let me transfer it to a file. Ugh!

Maybe it was fuller than it indicated. I have had that problem w/CD roms, however. Never been able to solve it.

5841	7	110729	1424210	1258167	fpj10	9/16/05 8:45 AM	1.1268603E12	Cruzer Scan Disk	Jeff, Were you ever able to resolve the &quot; cannot create file&quot; issue. I have the same situation, and unfortunately Cruzer Scan Disk offers NO, NONE, completely void, Help. If they have a tech site, I'll be damned if I can access it.
5841	8	110729	1424245	1424203	R. Proffitt	9/16/05 9:05 AM	1.1268615E12	Yup.	Did you read what I did?

My flash disk is 1 GB, ~~ Properties show 650 MB used, 350 MB free. In attempting to add ANY file, I recieve the error &quot; the directory or file cannot be created&quot; I have Win XP. Obviously I was able to. initally write on the disk and can read the existing files I created on it. Could I have accidently changed the file sysyem ? File System properties shows my &quot;C&quot; drive NTFS but the &quot;F&quot; Drive (flash disk) is FAT.

Create a new folder (if necessary delete a file to allow you to do this), then use this folder for you extra files. Chrs Nik
