yeah i know it wasnt the best choice for a mobo with the bugdet and other gear i have listed.
the graphics card isnt necessarily temporary as im hoping this comp will last me these next 3 years of college.
i need it for cs:s n stuff.
im majoring in pre-engineering physics since ee was impacted so i might need it for any kind of programs we will use but at the same time i dont ant to go over a grand.
if you have any suggestions for a mobo that isnt sli and a vid card that isnt as quick but plays what i need decently let me know..and work with the parts i already have.
thanks
