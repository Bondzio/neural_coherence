1.1.1	I have recently moved to a new apartment , prior to moving I could run the video game I play primarily at all very high settings and get a static 75FPS .	St
1.1.2	Now I get 30 or less than that and I 'm on low settings .	St
1.1.3	The conditions of the transport of my PC were as follows : Wedged between back seat on ground , stable , my AC was on full blast and the windows were foggy upon leaving vehicle , was around a 30 minute drive .	St
1.1.4	Could the moisture of the AC have potentially shorted something ?	Ques
1.1.5	I 've ran CHKDSK , no bad sectors .	St
1.1.6	Ran prime95 for processor and memtest for RAM .	St
1.1.7	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.8	I 'm very frustrated .	Polite
1.1.9	Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.1.10	Thank you .	St
1.2.1	You need to take nothing for granted .	St
1.2.2	I thought that any car A/C will cause damage and if it did just would n't work if that severe .	St
1.2.3	You/re going to have to check it out top to bottom and verify all is well .	St
1.2.4	Clean it out , reseat components , etc. , fan ( s ) operation and same type of location as before .	St
1.2.5	Doing all that helps eliminate or resolve your problem .	St
1.2.6	It 's not the same anymore , no matter how you want to view this , you moved it and relocated to different area .	St
1.2.7	Sorry , no easy , replace or do this or that .	St
1.2.8	Once all of the above is done , then look at possible damage .	St
1.2.9	Overall , I do n't see that for now .	St
1.2.10	You may need to do a total teardown and rebuild to best ideal conditions .	St
1.2.11	FYI , I 've seen PCs moved but did n't work at yours .	St
1.2.12	One case involved that the user sat the PC next to the door for over a week .	St
1.2.13	Moved and then issues .	St
1.2.14	Upon teardown , found a mouse had visited the PC and chewed some harness and peed inside ( stains ) thought the PC booted and all , it never was the same .	St
1.2.15	Another had roaches move in .	St
1.2.16	So , do n't take things for granted whatever your cause is .	St
1.2.17	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	Thanks alot for your input .	St
