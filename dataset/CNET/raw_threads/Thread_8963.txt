I am a genealogist and I frequently go to libraries and other locations in search of documents. These documents can be single sheets, photos, or even pages in books. Is there a scanner that anyone knows of that is &quot;portable&quot; that I could take with my laptop to use when I'm in these environments?

There is no issue about enough pixels for the &quot;scan&quot;. 8x11 = 88 square inches. 8,000,000 divided by 88 = 90,909 pixels per square inch or 301 pixels per inch. It's the HTC EVO 4G and you can find 8 Megapixel cameras today at many stores. Bob
