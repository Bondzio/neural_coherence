Well, after 7 years my Dell Dimension 4300 HD finally up and died on me.
Even though this computer was old and slow, it was perfect for some functions I needed to conduct.
I have several laptops for serious processing power.
I want to resurrect this box and I was wondering what I could buy to replace the dead HD.
It was a 40G IDE drive.
Any suggestions are appreciated.
