one of those driver issues you run into when switching from xp to vista.
even reputable companies like hp don't support older printers under vista, so people have to replace a perfectly functioning one by a new one.
i'd say the outlook for generic devices like this is not too well.
maybe somebody knows.
otherwise, back to the shop to ask about it.
