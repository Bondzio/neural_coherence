I just picked up 12gb of Corsair Vengeance ram only to find out that it won't work with what I have. The other problem is that I've found a few items that do work with my ASUS but are all out of stock at Tigerdirect, Newegg, etc.

Did you happen to get some 3gb ram or some spares that you want to use. The prices are so reasonable, I probably would not want to mix them. Take a look at Mwave or Fry's.
