<s> 2 machines, new one running XP Pro SP2, Asus 8V mobo with Asus wireless card and 10/100/1000 std card built in. </s>
<s> Old machine on XP SP1 with new D-Link DWL-G520+ wireless card. </s>
<s> Both are running on chanel 1 and the same workgroup. </s>
<s> Each machine can see itself and shows its own shareable files. </s>
<s> Neither can see the other. </s>
<s> The asus wireless card is running as a &quot;Soft AP&quot; old is running as ad-hoc.I have tried to set them up using the manu's software and also manually with every setting I can think of as far as a relative novice can. </s>
<s> In network connections, properties, the only difference I can see is the new machine has a protocol called Aegis protocol(IEEE 802.1x), the old one doesnt. </s>
<s> Can anyone help please?. </s>
<s> Can anyone tell me what the properties should show for the tcp/ip properties and the address settings?. </s>
<s> Neither the windows or the Manu's wizards help at all, in fact both seem to make the problem worse. </s>
<s> Additional info. </s>
<s> Firewall is sygate and set to allow network traffic. </s>
<s> Win firewall is disabled. </s>
<s> Set to allow sharing of some folders and both 'C' drives. </s>
<s> The old machine does not show the hand under shared drives and files though but the propertes show that they are set for shareing. </s>
<s> Also tried with both firewalls switched off. </s>
<s> There are no routers etc, I just want to be able to transfer files from one machine to the other. </s>
<s> I gave up trying to connect to the internet via networking a long time ago!! </s>
<s> Denis. </s>
<s> in Ad-Hoc mode, on the same workgroup and file and print sharing enabled on XPs firewall Exceptions tab. </s>
<s> Tried that Michael, the machines couldn't even see themselves!!. </s>
<s> I forgot to note, I get the same response from a crossover cable that has worked for ages, first on 98&lt;&gt;ME then from ME&lt;&gt;XP Sp1 then XP&lt;&gt;XP. </s>
<s> That now won't work on the XP SP2&lt;&gt;XP SP1. </s>
<s> Maybe no connection of course!. </s>
<s> None of the previous setups would allow an internet sharing system to work, but that's next, if I can get the wireless system to work that is...... Denis. </s>
