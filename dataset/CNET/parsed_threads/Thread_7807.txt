<s> Here are my system specs: Intel Q9450 DX48BT2 Motherboard (BIOS at 1782) 2 x 2GB of Kingston RAM (1.5v each) (DDR3 1333Mhz) MSI RX3870-T2D512E OC Video card v120 (Driver at 8.43) 700 Watt Thermaltake Power supply Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeGamer Sound card Nothing has been touched from factory settings and I have no intention of doing so. </s>
<s> (I originally had 4x 1GB sticks of OCZ Ram - DDR3 1333 Mhz. </s>
<s> I these sticks operating at 1.82v) My computer trouble is that when I boot the computer for the first time after a long period of being off, the computer hangs. </s>
<s> It seems to happen a minute after the computer fully boots. </s>
<s> This necessitates a press of the reset button. </s>
<s> After I press the reset button, the computer reboots and everything is OK; No more freezing issue. </s>
<s> I went through OCZ's site and I checked their memory configurator. </s>
<s> The DX48BT2 motherboard isn't listed at all on their site so I ordered the Kingston RAM. </s>
<s> Even after ordering the Kingston RAM I still get the hang on the cold boot issue. </s>
<s> I have also posted this issue on the OCZ boards before I ordered the RAM. </s>
<s> It was suggested that I don't have a large enough power supply. </s>
<s> Here is a link to that thread: http://www.ocztechnologyforum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=42190 Could this hanging on a cold boot be due to the fact that I don't have a large enough capacity on my power supply? </s>
<s> If not, what might the other possibilities be? </s>
<s> Thanks for your assistance </s>

<s> I decided to look through the boxes an labeling of the above computer I had built and I noticed on the box of the ThermalTake power supply &quot;Dual Core Support.&quot; No mention of Quad Cores. </s>
<s> I know this may sound like an odd question, but do some power supplies work with Dual Cores but not Quads? </s>
<s> Is where you RMA boards and change make, models till you get a good one. </s>
<s> Today those that pick boards may find things that don't work, arrive with out of date BIOS or other issues. </s>
<s> The &quot;sellers&quot; are often just dispensers for the boxes and not support. </s>
<s> I do not have your hardware to play with but share the comment fix. </s>

<s> Check the ram placement for DDR3 setting. </s>
<s> Verify what slots they go into, it maybe for &quot;pairs&quot; like in A or B slots or similar color slots, That could aslo be like in slots 1&3, the manual should explain this. </s>
<s> You wouldn't have seen this problem if all slots were used in your old setup. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> enough to be ready during POST. </s>
<s> But when you do the restart...it's already spinning, seen as ready and the system starts normally. </s>
<s> Try changing the BIOS for the long or full memory test (vs quick memory test) and see if that solves the hang on boot at cold start. </s>
