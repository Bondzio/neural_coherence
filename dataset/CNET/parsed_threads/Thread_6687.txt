<s> I plan to purchase a G4 Powerbook, but I can't decide if I should get the 12-inch or 15-inch model. </s>
<s> Please respond to this post with any relevant guidance on the purchase decision. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> If you are doing more graphics intensive apps, or using photoshop, go with the 15 inch. </s>
<s> However, if you need a computer for travel or for mostly business applications, go with the 12. </s>
<s> the 12 is a nice friendly size for coach class. </s>
<s> The 15 is just a little big for coach, but all of the people around you will be impressed by the screen size and brightness, and you will get away with it. </s>
<s> A 17 in coach will get you a 2 drink penalty for encroachment. </s>
<s> you will have to buy a drink for the person on each side of you to make up for not being able to maintain your lane. </s>
<s> The worst part of this is that you then have to worry about their drinks spilling on your lap top. </s>
<s> You also have to bring extra earphones and an audio spliter. </s>
<s> Porn movies are a risky choice. </s>
<s> I have a 15, because I need the screen space for tool bars and tool tabs, and option windows. </s>
<s> My buddy used to have a 15, but now has a 12 and likes it better because of coach, because of weight, and because of computer bag options. </s>
<s> If it sits on a desk for 90% of it's life, get a big screen. </s>
