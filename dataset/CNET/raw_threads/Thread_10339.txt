I want to not only connect it to my computer (DVI) but also play console games (using composite video, maybe component in the future). I have a few options: get a hardware video converter get a usb input device get a new display Getting a new display is my preferred choice, so I am asking for recommendations. I'd like a display that is widescreen, has dvi+component+composite or s-video, can display 4:3 without stretching, and is about $300 to $400. I like my current Samsung, but am not a brand *****, so I don't care who makes it. I have researched like a mofo and found these displays: Samsung 2280HD Samsung 215TW Samsung 225MS Dell 2007FP (4:3 ratio ) Now, some of these are old/discontinued. Others are too expensive, but I'm just posting these to describe what kind of display I am looking for. The 215TW looks the best, but has a lag issue, I guess. Thanks for any advice or recommendations.
