i have 2 female cats who must be on my large table i use as my command central.
they shed, of course.
the grates on my dell tower catch a lot of the hair--but--it mats in there, and is not all that visible.
i use those rollers that use sticky masking tape as lint pickup vehicles.
i use these first--and often.
if your fan seems to run faster--this is a clue to blocked grates (vents?).
if i do this...both front and back...the inside seems to stay pretty clean.
using something sticky to grab the dust boogers avoids the horror of using a blast of anything that can mean disaster!
