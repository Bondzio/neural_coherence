it used to be dell, but they've lost my confidence.
too many bs deals they have going on.
no more amd, their ubuntu systems cost more than windows (dell.ca, i don't know if it's the same in the rest of the world).
open source is taking over.
anything you can pay for, you can pretty much get for free.
why pay more?
office suite, security, music and video players or burners, web browsing.
if i were to choose a brand maybe shuttle, for the novice try their new kpc k45.
i see dell is at the top of the list, as long as it is, it'll continue to overcharge.
build your own next time (with the components of your choosing not theirs) and see what their prices will look like in 5 years...
