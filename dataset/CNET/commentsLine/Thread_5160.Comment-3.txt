&quot;ps2 logitech wheel mouse&quot; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ that's your problem, a logitech mouse.
goto the logitech support website or if you got it, cd/floppy install disk, use it.
normally, you don't need drivers as native w2k will do fine.
however, in some systems for whatever reason, logitech mice are problematic.
i find using a plain 2-button non-wheeled mouse or a real ms wheel mouse problems go away.
you can tweek the mouse setting(hardware) if you like and see if it settles down, but i have no fix to speak of other than above.
sorry... tada -----willy
