1.1.1	I am considering buying a LCD Wide Screen Monitor but I don't want a circle to look oblong.	St
1.1.2	Will the computer compensate for the wider screen and keep the same aspect ratio as I had with the standard monitor?	St
1.2.1	The software you use will have to do that.	St
1.2.2	For example, I don't have an issue with browsers or IRFANVIEW.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	on your video card.	St
1.3.2	My main PC's video card has a lot of resolution options and I was able to find one that worked.	St
1.3.3	My other PC's video card did not have the proper resolution and the screen was stretched.	St
1.3.4	A wide screen monitor will need something like 1440 X 900 resolution (wide screen).	St
1.3.5	If your video card does not have this available, you'll get a stretched picture.	St
1.4.1	Thank you, coryphaeus!	St
1.4.2	I've been suffering with elongated images since I &quot;inherited&quot; an HPw19 from my son.	St
1.4.3	(It came with his new computer.	St
1.4.4	He couldn't stand the stretched image, so kept his old standard aspect ratio 19&quot; monitor when he sold me his old computer.)	St
1.4.5	I switched to 1440x900, as you suggested, and now I have incredibly sharp, standard ration windows inside my 16:9 display.	St
1.4.6	Beautiful.	St
1.4.7	Should I tell my son?	St
1.4.8	Thanks again, Ron	St
1.5.1	Thanks !	St
1.5.2	You solved my problem with a 22.5&quot; wide screen monitor.	St
