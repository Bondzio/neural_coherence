Sounds good, but can you explain how I rename - would you give me a example what I'm would be doing, were to go etc.
If I can do this with Windows movie play that would be great.
To use the audio track of a WMV file as the audio for a WLMM project, simply rename the file so the extension is WMA.
WLMM will accept and use it.
Rename a DV-AVI file so it has a .WAV extension and it also works as the audio track of a WLMM project.
Rename the same DV-AVI file so it has a .WMA extension and works too.
The bottom line seems to be... take any video file you want to use as the audio track and rename the extension to any of them that WLMM likes, and it might work fine.
If it can, WLMM uses the audio stream from the video file.
