Which is better value for money?
?
http://www.comet.co.uk/shopcomet/product/499331/EPSON-SX100-MULTIFUNCTION-PHOTOPRINTER/tab/specification http://www.ebuyer.com/product/152149 I need the scanner to scan childhood photo's in.
But if I'm buying a scanner, might as well get a 3 in 1?
BUT I want my scans to be good quality.
For enlargemnts.
(Not huge, but book size- I don't want to lose quality) What would you recommend?
I don't want to spend much more than 60.
I know - the dpi is better on the stand alone scanner - but how much is visible to the eye?
