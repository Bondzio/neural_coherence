1.1.1	I bought a 160 GB external hard drive that is currently formatted as a fat32 hard drive.	St
1.1.2	However, that only supports file transfers of 4 gb at once, and thus I wanted to see if it was possible to reformat the hard drive to another file system that would support larger file transfers.	St
1.2.1	You should see some improvement.	St
1.2.2	You can even convert from fat32 to ntfs without formatting or file lose.	St
1.2.3	But you can only go from fat32 to ntfs nondestructively not the other way around.	St
