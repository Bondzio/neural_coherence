<s> For the last 12 months I have had up to 5 units connected to my High Speed Cable InterNet via a LinkSys BEFW11S4 (802.11b router with 4 ports). </s>
<s> I have two desktops (Compaq Presario 1Ghz processor with Windows ME on both) connected via cat5 cable with various Laptops and PDA's connected via wireless. </s>
<s> It was simple to set up and I loved the functionally that it allowed me. </s>
<s> So now I get greedy - 11Mbps is nice - but 54Mbps would be nicer. </s>
<s> So I go down to the local retailer and invest in a WRT55AG - Go home - unhook the old - Go thru the setup CD and get everything going. </s>
<s> All seems to be well till I go over to the second desktop that is connected via cat5 and find out that I can not connect to the InterNet or Retrieve my EMail. </s>
<s> I can go thru the &quot;Start&quot; &quot;Run&quot; &quot;Command&quot; and &quot;Ping&quot; sites like yahoo.com / linksys.com / etc - but Page not found on the InterNet Explorer. </s>
<s> I even tried disconnecting everything and going thru the setup CD with the secondary computer - still no luck. </s>
<s> This computer will access the InterNet/EMail when it is connected directly to the Modem so I am confident that my InterNet Explorer / Outlook 2000 is working OK. Any suggections as to what I need to do and please do not say contact OEM. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, </s>
<s> But the usual issue that plagues this industry is the firmware on your new unit is usually out of date. </s>
<s> I find it rather incredible that the last 10 units I helped with were... out of date firmware. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> Everyone shouts &quot;it's new, how can this be?&quot; </s>
<s> Try powering down all components on the LAN (Modem/router/PCs), then restart the modem/router/PCs in that order. </s>
<s> Sometimes a reset of MAC addresses is necessary. </s>
