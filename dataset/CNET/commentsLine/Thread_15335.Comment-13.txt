&quot;i've had dell's for years and have been generally happy, but after 3 or 4 years it gets verrrrrrry slooooooow.
knowledeable friends tell me it's because the computer came with so much junk - trial softwares, ads, etc&quot; this statement is illogical.
if the &quot;junk&quot; were a problem, why would it take three to four years for the problemsto araise?
i the &quot;junk&quot; were the problem, then the problems would start on day zero.
i have no idea what your problem is since you posted no useful information about it.
