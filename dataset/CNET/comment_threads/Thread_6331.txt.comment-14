My friend has the exact same system as you and is looking to make the same 7600GT video upgrade as you.
He is having some trouble finding a compatible psu.
I have not been able to determine whether the psu has proprietary wiring/form factor or standard mATX wiring/form factor.
I searched online and have not been able to find a psu that is explicitly designated as a suitable replacement or upgrade.
This leads me to believe that the psu may be proprietary.
Typically, there are many replacements available online (explicitly designating a compatibility list) if the wiring and form factor are standard.
Can you give an update on whether you found a suitable power supply for your Netvista 8307?
