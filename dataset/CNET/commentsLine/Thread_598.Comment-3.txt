your sempron is freq locked to the bus and you can't oc it w/o cutting traces & resoldering (messy, stay away).
it is a 754 pin cpu running at 1800 mhz and in that package the family freq tops out at 2000 mhz so that is an indicator you won't get much gain even if you go down the messy route.
you may be able to replace the cpu with an athlon64 but don't waste your money if the bios doesn't support athlons.
besides, athlon64 isn't real cheap.
stick with your pc until you have the money to buy a fancier one.
