If no, then toss it in the recycle bin. What hard drive model number? Hard drive data cable is 80 wire (40 pin) Ultra ATA? Hard drive is attached to motherboard or PCI HDD controller? What is on the hard drive? Try booting to a Windows or some Linux live CD (Knoppix is good).

AFTER INSTALL THE SYSTEM BOOTED ONCE OR TWICE AND THEN STOPPED RECOGNIZING MY HARD DRIVE, SO I TRIED A DIFFERENT HARD DRIVE FROM ANOTHER COMPUTER, SAME RESULT. I'M ABLE TO GET INTO SETUP. SOMETIMES I SEE THE HARD DRIVE IN SETUP BUT ONCE I SAVE AND LEAVE SETUP THE BOARD DOESN'T DETECT ANY OF MY DRIVES, INCLUDING THE HARD DRIVE. Any lights on the motherboard? THE LED LIGHT COMES ON WHEN I TURN ON THE COMPUTER. Any signs of life? i'M ABLE TO USE THE FLOPPY AND THE CD ROM. BUT NEITHER IS RECOGNIZED. If no, then toss it in the recycle bin. What hard drive model number? AC26400-00RN Hard drive data cable is 80 wire (40 pin) Ultra ATA? I DON'T KNOW, REGULAR HARD DRIVE CABLE. Hard drive is attached to motherboard or PCI HDD controller? ATTACHED TO MOTHERBOARD What is on the hard drive? WINDOWS XP MEDIA CENTER EDITION

If you found it in the garbage any number of components and items could be bad--motherboard circuitry, bad capacitors, loose/missing soldering, RAM, PSU, hard drive, video card, bad power and data cables, heat/water damage. You name it. A full system inspection is in order. This usually means taking all components out of the case, including the motherboard. Any computer is not expected to run any version of Windows without a fresh installation of the OS and the drivers that the system needs. Windows is not intended to be installed on the HD of one computer, and then have the HD moved to another computer. At this point, I strongly suggest running a Linux operating system to see if the system can run stable for a long time. Download and burn Knoppix or Damn Small Linux. The live CD versions of these distributions run off the CD and not hard disk. If the system can't do that, then I'd return it to the garbage. BTW, how much RAM is present?
