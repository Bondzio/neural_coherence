Everyone has their opinion about a gaming rig.
This cpu/that cpu......this gpu/that gpu......etc/etc.
I think that a top of the line I5 is all the cpu you will need for gaming.
I think that 16GB of ram is a bit of overkill....8GB might be a better fit.
You might want to spend some time and price the combo parts one at a time.
Cpu.
Combo price.......240.
Newegg price......220.
