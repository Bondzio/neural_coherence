<s> Use a can of compressed air or direct brush cleaning for best results. </s>
<s> if the problem persists after a cleaning, then replace fan as likely cause of noise. </s>
<s> Those systems build as extreme of OC'ed will need better cooling if only &quot;stock cooled&quot; to better cool the heat build-up. </s>
<s> If cleaning all areas should be addressed. </s>
