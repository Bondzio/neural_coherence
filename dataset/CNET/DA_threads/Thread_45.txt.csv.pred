1.1.4	thanks	Polite
1.2.1	You will need a much larger power supply and plenty of cooling .	St
1.2.2	I 'll guess the MB , processor and RAM will cost you close to $ 500 alone .	St
1.2.3	You might through in another 100 for a halfway decent case with some breathing room and PS over 400w .	St
1.2.4	If you want to do more than spreadsheets , web browsing and such , you might want more RAM but XP will run ok with 512 megs .	St
1.2.5	Your Dell box might not fit the MB anyway .	St
1.2.6	Have you checked into this ?	Ques
1.3.1	i figured the power supply would be an issue ( the current one is 300-350 i think ) an suggestions as far a brand ? ?	Ques
1.3.2	i assumed that as long as they were the same form factor that it should fit ... i 'll have to look into this ... thanks	St
1.4.1	If it was really a 350 , but after a year or two , the power supply capacity is a mere shadow of when it was new .	St
1.4.2	There are many articles about this so do not dismiss that its enough .	St
