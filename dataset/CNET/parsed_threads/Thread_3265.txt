<s> Recently my laptop stopped charging. </s>
<s> I believe it has to do with the dc jack having s bad connection since before it completely stopped working it would get really hot. </s>
<s> I've opened the back panel of my laptop and can see that the dc jack wiggles a little in its socket. </s>
<s> Do you guys think resoldering it to the motherboard would fix the issue? </s>
<s> If you don't do solder work, then your choice for this to be your first. </s>
<s> If you do such work, then why not? </s>
<s> Frankly at a few dollars, I suggest you replace the jack. </s>
<s> Google this -&gt; Laptop jack repair &lt;- Bob </s>
<s> Inside that little plastic connector for the external adapter, is a small switch that selects the power source. </s>
<s> Either adapter of battery. </s>
<s> This jack gets jammed, yanked and pulled six ways at once. </s>
<s> It's not uncommon for the connector to work loose, pull up traces, create cold solder joints and burn things up. </s>
<s> After repeated repairs from repeated abuse, I just put the connector on a pig tail that hangs through the hole. </s>
<s> This keeps that connector area free from stress and can patch around a damaged PCB to salvage an otherwise junked unit. </s>
<s> An inspection is certainly called for. </s>
<s> Since you can look at the DC connection, internally be sure what' s what. </s>
<s> Solder being loose or contacts are wiggle able should be soldered. </s>
<s> However, many times, a minor crack is present on the pcb(board) so be sure all is well. </s>
<s> You can even re-enforce it abit by placing a short piece of wire to hold more solder and thus brace it up provided that can be done at all. </s>
