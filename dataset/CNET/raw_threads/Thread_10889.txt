I am able to get a &quot;discount&quot; on Lenovo computers but would like to know if it worth it. Lenovo will charge me $1000 for this computer. They SAY it is worth $1700 which I think is untrue. What are your thoughts? * Harvard ThinkCentre M57 Tower Form Factor (no ext. speakers) * Genuine Windows XP Professional * Intel Core2 Duo 3.0GHz * Tower * 4GB RAM * 250GB Hard Drive * DVD R/W drive * Integrated Gigabit Ethernet * Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 * TPM 1.2 Computer #2 from Velocity Micro Vector Z20 for $1250 ordered from the company: MX2-W Black 400 Watt Velocity Micro Power Supply EVGA nForce 630i Socket 775 PCI-E, DDR2 Intel Core 2 Duo E6850, dual 3 GHz cores 1333MHz FSB, 4MB L2 Cache 4096 Corsair XMS2 DDR2-800 Low Latency Memory w/heat spreader (2x2048) 512 eVGA NVIDIA GeForce 8500GT, 320 GB Hitachi 7200 rpm Cache SATA 300 w/NCQ 20x Line On DVD +/- Dual later Burner Any input would be appreciated...

The machines are apples n oranges. Curious what the OP's purpose is. Heads up: Every Velocity Micro I've seen I'd be embarrassed to put in an office. Not as tacky as alienware kinds of stuff, but the glowing blue LEDs scream out gamer-geek, true chick/client repellant.

Comparable towers can be had under $1000. The price on Velocity Micro is typical for them. They use good components. I wish it had better than 8500GT, but that really depends on the needs -- it's a workable gcard for sure.

I am very happy with my computer with runs Vista Ulitmate very well. After further research the Lenovo wasn't worth the discount and Velocity was overkill. Thank you for all of your input. And thank you Joonil Park who really customized my computer to my needs. It was nice to have an intelligent human touch.
