However, I can't get my xbox live to work. I input the DNS server values that my isp gave me. Every time I try to connect it comes up with an error that says &quot;network services (DHCP or PPoE) were not found&quot; i know that i do not have a PPoE dsl connection. Help me please.

Thanks so much for your help.
