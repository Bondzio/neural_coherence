<s> Hi, I'm wondering if the ATI Radeon HD7750 would be okay to use in an HP Pavillion 6610f system with a 250w psu. </s>
<s> I know a 400w supply is recommended for it, but I've read a few others' opinions that say 250w would be fine because of the card's low power draw. </s>
<s> I just want to make sure if it'll work or not before I consider buying a new psu. </s>
<s> My system specs: AMD Athlon II x4 635(2.90Ghz) 4GB DDR3 750GB SATAII 7200RPM DVD-RW ATI Radeon HD 4200 graphics Windows 7 64-bit 250w Lite-On PS-5251 08, 12V@14A </s>
<s> power supply, here's the one I installed http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814131338&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwords&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-_-pla-_-NA-_-NA&gclid=COq7nIqYwLQCFYZaMgoddm8AAA it works just fine with light gaming....Digger </s>
<s> If the manufacturer recommends a 400W PSU, then get a 400W or better PSU. </s>
<s> Don't find out the hard way you needed it. </s>
<s> What you will find also, users that have success with it installed as is. </s>
<s> But, they rarely tell you it failed at some given period. </s>
<s> Do as the maker recommends to be problem free on that issue. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> thanks y'all, I decided to go with a Corsair 500w, and an HD7770, should be decent upgrade for now. </s>
