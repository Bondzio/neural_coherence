there are two ways that might get your computer going.
1. disconect your bios battery.
your bios batter is a nickle size &quot;silver&quot; battery located near your bios chip.
take the battery out and after 5- seconds place it back in.
2. check your motherboard manual for a jumper connection by your bios chip.
the jumper has three terminals.
move the jumper over to the bare terminal.
that wil turn your bios off, clearing your bios.
after a few seconds, move the jumper back.
just be sure to ground yourself to the chassis before you touch anything.
static electricity can kill your motherboard.
hope this works.
good luck!
