i'd go with with a new kit with 2 dimms at 4gb....like the one recommended....same speed, same timing, same voltage, etc.
as the existing ram.
you'd put the 2-4gb dimms in the first channel say &quot;a&quot; and the leave the existing ram in channel &quot;b&quot; for a total of 10gb.
if you still want more ram....then get another 8gb kit to match the first one for a total of 16gb.
keep in mind your system operates most efficiently/optimally with matching dimms in pairs....3 dimms x 4gb doesn't meet the dual channel pair rule recommended by the system mfg.
by the way..... newegg appears to have a canadian subsidiary.....  let us know how it works.
