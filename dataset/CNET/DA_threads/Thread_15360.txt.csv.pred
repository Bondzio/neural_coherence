1.1.1	I currently run two towers each with Ornico 2500 Ap 's and Proxim Gold Cards .	St
1.1.2	the first runs 3 x 120 degree antennas with 1watt amps and the 2nd runs 2X 180 degree antennas with 1 watt amps .	St
1.1.3	I run on the 2.4frequency at 802.11b To expand with I have 4 other AP ( 2500 's ) and 8 gold cards .	St
1.1.4	I have many good tower ( silo ) location ( s ) and a clear LOS for a double bounce into a town with limited Internet speeds .	St
1.1.5	Also high number of customers within range of the first tower .	St
1.1.6	My main Questions are : - What would be the best method of transmitting signal from one of my current two towers to a second location , allowing me to rebroadcast there .	St
1.1.7	?	Ques
1.1.8	( I have DBL 2300 's , smartbridges , Dlink dsa 3100 and 24dBi dishes ) .	St
1.1.9	- Once I get the back-haul setup I 'm wondering the best method to transmit - I like the 180 degree we seem to get good coverage and two blades only take one AP .	St
1.1.10	Will an Omni serve the same customer base with a single AP and only one card ?	Ques
1.1.11	- We like the distance we get with the 120 degree blades but we have our channels all used - how would you coordinate a bounce in this case . ?	Ques
1.1.12	Would changing the frequency ( for the bounce ) be a way to avoid channel clashing ?	Ques
1.1.13	- I 'd love some info on splitters or filters or whatever allows you to run two or three blades on one channel - That would save me a lot of problems .	St
1.1.14	Thanks In advance for the help anyone can give me - Really !	St

1.2.1	Pls check my sugegstions - What would be the best method of transmitting signal from one of my current two towers to a second location , allowing me to rebroadcast there .	Sug
1.2.2	?	Ques
1.2.3	( I have DBL 2300 's , smartbridges , Dlink dsa 3100 and 24dBi dishes NC & gt ; In order to avoide interference , use 5 GHz backhaul .	St
1.2.4	You might like to consider smartBridges multiband airHaul solution .	St
1.2.5	Once I get the back-haul setup I 'm wondering the best method to transmit - I like the 180 degree we seem to get good coverage and two blades only take one AP .	St
1.2.6	Will an Omni serve the same customer base with a single AP and only one card ?	Ques
1.2.7	NC & gt ; Sector antenna is always prefered over Omni .	St
