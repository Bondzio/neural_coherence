if you decide not to go to data recovery hoses and knoppix and other freebie recovery fails, try these common plays: -&gt; put the drive in an antistatic bag and airtight into the fridge over night.
see if it comes back long enough to drag data off it.
-&gt; unscrew the back pcb and gently wiggle all connections.
put it back together and try again.
-&gt; find the exact drive and swap the pcb.
sometimes you pay the price of a new working drive, but data is worth more than that.
the new working drive may fail so it's the price of this exercise.
-&gt; rare, but worth it... try the drive on each of its side sides... -&gt; only 80 conductor cables, cable select and place it on the second ide channel, boot the knoppix cd and try again.
