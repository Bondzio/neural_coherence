This is pretty stupid that it's set up this way by default, but most Windows defaults are stupid, IMO.
Go to the advanced graphics settings (Control Panel|Display|Advanced) and click on the Monitor tab.
Uncheck the option to &quot;Hide display types the monitor cannot display&quot; and then you can set your display to most any resolution you like.
Of course, the actual screen resolution doesn't change, but you get a virtual desktop the size of the setting you choose and software that requires 1024x768 or whatever, will work.
The virtual desktop automatically scrolls when you move the mouse to the edge of the screen.
Good luck!
