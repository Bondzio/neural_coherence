hi stephen, i apologize to bother you again but do not know what a ssid is and where to find it?
i went to my linksys wireless setup page and found where it says &quot;wireless network name (ssid)&quot;.
is this what you are talking about?
i'm getting ready to leave now and go take my laptop to see if 1)i can connect and/or 2)see other wireless networks.
i&quot;ll let you know what happens later.
again, thank you for your time and patience in helping me.
renee
