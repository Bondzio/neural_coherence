<s> I have a Dell Inspiron that, when I attempted to start it yesterday, gave me the message, &quot;Internal Hard Disk Drive Not Found&quot;. </s>
<s> Not having experienced this before, I'm assuming that my hard disk crashed. </s>
<s> I'm guessing I can replace the hard disk with another. </s>
<s> Is there a way to recover the data that was on the disk? </s>
<s> I hadn't used the laptop for a few months, so the only backups I have that are current are from my desktop. </s>
<s> However, there are some things that I only did on the laptop and I'd like to get those back if possible. </s>
<s> Also, can I put a larger capacity hard disk in as a replacement and, is it something I can do myself or do I need a tech? </s>
<s> Obviously, I've never had this happen before, so I really don't know what to do at this point. </s>
<s> The logic behind not having a backup of things you did more than a few months ago eludes me. </s>
<s> But that's not very relevant. </s>
<s> You can try to get the disk out and connect to another machine using a USB2 to SATA/IDE-cable. </s>
<s> You might be able to copy data, but just as likely (even more likely) it won't show at all, because it has gone south. </s>
<s> Then you would need a professional data recovery company to do it for you. </s>
<s> Or it might show up, but say it's unformatted. </s>
<s> Then some DIY data recovery tool might work. </s>
<s> Just try and see. </s>
<s> It depends on your laptop what you can put into it. </s>
<s> And it happens on the disks you have available (system recovery, windows + drivers/utilities, none) how to reinstall the OS on a new empty hard disk. </s>
