actually from what i have read at intel.. tempature flucuations are more dangerous than some warmer than normal temp.
reading.. i would go with a steady as she goes tempature reading.. and not create a pc-environment that caused cold air to suddenly hit the machine surfaces.. i have had had high heat flags run on my machine and nothing ever happened..this was with a celeron d[331]2.66ghz cpu..i replaced that cpu w/p4[531]3.0ghz..and of course things run exactly so.. .. video rendering is cpu intensive..w/p4 i have no issues.
