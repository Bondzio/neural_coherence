He bought it through the phone company and it came with an internal dsl modem installed. His kid recently bought a new Dell desktop using Win XP and they would like to share the dsl connection using a cable/dsl router. Here's my question: Is there a way to do this using the internal modem or will he need to buy an external modem? He's been a customer of SBC for several years so maybe he can talk them into a free modem update. Thanks for taking a look at this post and for any feedback. -Ironjaw-
