<s> Hi I'm trying to find any facts on how many UK businesses have PC's (not online necessarily). </s>
<s> And how many office PC's have sound cards as standard. </s>
<s> Was there a year eg 1999 fromwhen every PC came with a sound card as standard? </s>
<s> There are some businesses that don't have a PC. </s>
<s> They may have a Macintosh. </s>
<s> Such information is readily available from research firms. </s>
<s> But people lament you have to pay for such research. </s>
<s> If you don't need exact figures, then you can do your own STATISTICS. </s>
<s> You can randomly pick 10 shops and see if they have the computer visible and derive with some certainty that for the area you did your survey what the percentage. </s>
<s> STATISTICS being what it is states that for a given sample size, the margin of error decreases with increasing samples. </s>
<s> Since it would be prohibitive to be EXACT or without error, any number you ever see will not be exact and with the ongong changes (new purchases, old machines dying), the number is always in flux. </s>
<s> Sound cards in business use were quite a rarity. </s>
<s> We, at our office had them because it's part of our business. </s>
<s> We have security (CCTV) software so it's a given we want sound capability. </s>
<s> For some factory bean counting PC, sound may have no use and even if it had a sound card, then isn't much reason for the speakers. </s>
<s> You can answer your question with a little STATISTICS. </s>
