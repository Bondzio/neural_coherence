i have 2 120gb usb2 externals and a 120gb internal which i connect when i want to transfer large batches of files, a few gb.
the externals are normally disconnected.
i connect only with the internet off and after i've run trend internet security 2005, adaware, spybot and giant ( ms's new acquisition ), all updated daily.
i have 3 backups for all the personal stuff, just to make sure i don't lose anything else ( big virus attack 2 years ago ).
after i connect the externals, i do another set of scans and i have never had any pests resident in the externals, or the sometimes connected internal either.
looks like they prefer the straight line approach, the c drive.
normally, i delete\quarantine anywhere from 10 to 80 malwares per day, depending on where i surf.
i go where i damn well please but have to spend up to a couple of hours occasionally to clean the pc.
either that or hide in the closet - not my style.
