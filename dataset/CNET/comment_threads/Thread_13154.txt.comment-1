The on/off push button on my mom's computer doesn't seem to work anymore.
I was wondering what the possible culprits could be.
The computer is about two years old and barely gets any use from her.
She wants to already buy a new one, but I am hoping it just needs a battery or a new power supply.
Thanks for the help
