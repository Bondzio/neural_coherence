<s> I have a Dlink (Di-624) router. </s>
<s> I have been using it for one year and have not upgraded the firmware. </s>
<s> Should I attempt it or just leave well enough alone. </s>
<s> Security? </s>
<s> Should I disable the SSID broadcast? </s>
<s> I have the WEP enabled. </s>
<s> I then enabled the WPA-PSK. </s>
<s> Do they both work together or am I just using one of them? </s>
<s> My system works fine as it is. </s>
<s> I have an old P2-Dell PC running Win 98 wired to the router as well as an HP laptop with Win XP home. </s>
<s> The laptop is used for the most part wired but is used occasionally for wireless access. </s>
<s> until there is a problem... Security: SSID broadcast.. up to you... its not a security matter anyway.. its only show that your wireless is available. </s>
<s> WEP + WPA-PSK .. again if its work then use both.. As for security, add MAC Filtering.. </s>
<s> Router updates for firmware may include improvements in security, speed, reliability, functionality, and bug fixes. </s>
<s> I always keep it up to date. </s>
<s> WEP and WPA simultaneously? </s>
<s> You just get one. </s>
<s> Some good wireless security practices: - enable WEP or WPA - disable SSID broadcast - use strong passwords/keys - change wireless password regularly - enable MAC filtering - don't use default SSID, router name, admin password - don't let range of broadcast go too far outside home. </s>
