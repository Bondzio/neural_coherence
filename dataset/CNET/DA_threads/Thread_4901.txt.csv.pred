1.2.1	XP has been known to look at other drives after boot and mark them & quot ; non-bootable. & quot ; How did you stop XP from doing that and breaking your boot method ?	Ques
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	I access all my hard drives with operating system on them through Bios .	St
1.3.2	I go to Advanced Bios Features .	St
1.3.3	For instance my main drive is a WD 74 gig 10,000 rpm HD XP .	St
1.3.4	So I have & gt ; 1st boot set as SCSI Snd boot set as CDrom 3rd boot set as Floopy and then I have it set on Sata To get to my other HD XP .	St
1.3.5	I just change the 1st boot to HDD and leave all the rest the same .	St
1.3.6	To get to my HD with Vista on it I Change 1st boot to SCSI 2nd boot to CDrom 3rd boot to Floopy and put it on Raid And I have one hard drive with know operating system on it for storage .	St
1.3.7	The other night I unlocked all my hard drives from my main drive which has XP on it and did a through maintenance and ran Avast and I deleted a trojan from my Vist hard drive and I wondered if that was my problem wiht my Vista hard drive .	St
1.3.8	I was not having problems with it before .	St
1.3.9	Wendell H	St
1.4.1	I do n't see how you fix that XP issue and now we find out there is a trojan .	St
1.4.2	Either issue has you looking at XP/otherOS repair procedures .	St
1.4.3	Just look at google.com and links about NTLDR and your error message .	St
1.4.4	I wo n't repeat prior discussions about this but wonder how you get around the item I 've run into .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	I am still trying to find out what is wrong with all hard drive hooked up and not being able to get on just one drive that has Vista on it .	St
1.5.2	How can I get that file NTLDR and install it .	St
1.5.3	Thank You Very Much Wendell H	St
1.6.1	http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & q=VISTA+NTLDR+REPAIR & btnG=Google+Search Remember I do n't duplicate web content .	St
1.6.2	Bob	St
1.7.1	Thank You for your help , I searched around on the site that you gave me and I tried a few tips .	St
1.7.2	The only tip I did not take until last was the one about changing hardware the easiest one .	St
1.7.3	I took out my storage drive to put in a larger HD , and to do that I had to remove two raid cables .	St
1.7.4	1 ) One to the HD I was replacing with a larger HD 2 ) One That had Vista RC1 on it .	St
1.7.5	I got the cables switched up , and that what was causing me to get that error message .	St
1.7.6	Well I did not have to do what I usualy do is to reinstall the operating system .	St
1.7.7	Which it would not made a difference .	St
1.7.8	I Thank You For Your Help Wendell H	St
1.8.1	All of the OSes I know of do n't like moving the hard disks around .	St
1.8.2	Most lose their OS , some lose their files .	St
1.8.3	The more seasoned owners have backups .	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
1.9.1	All my programs are backed up , the big issue is I do not have a partion recovery with the back ups on it yet .	St
1.9.2	I am working on that now to see exactly how I am going to do that and what software I am going to use .	St
1.9.3	Having a partion recovery would save me a lot off time when I do not have to install software and updates .	St
1.9.4	Trying to make a decision on which software to use to help me make a partion or have another HD to install my operating system and software from .	St
1.9.5	I have read this article bellow .	St
1.9.6	http : //www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2014359,00.asp Thank You : Wendell H	St
1.10.1	Even with partition and drive backup software let 's take the scenario of moving a partition from one machine to another .	St
1.10.2	One machine had the XP partition ( working ) on a second drive .	St
1.10.3	The new machine will have it as the boot drive .	St
1.10.4	No tool today can move the partition and have the OS boot .	Sug
1.10.5	The activation issue is not the issue here and you 'll likely see the NTLDR message .	St
1.10.6	Keep at this and you 'll discover this is one of those areas .	St
1.10.7	Maybe a better plan is to backup our stuff but install the OS and programs ?	Ques
1.10.8	In closing , one word .	St
1.10.9	ACRONIS .	St
1.10.10	Bob	St
1.11.1	I misunderstood what I read on the article Recovery Partition .	St
1.11.2	I went to Acronis site and read some more there besides reading the article on Cnet .	St
1.11.3	It said it could make an exact copy off your HD .	St
1.11.4	I will purchase this software .	St
1.11.5	Thank You for your help : Wendell H	Polite
