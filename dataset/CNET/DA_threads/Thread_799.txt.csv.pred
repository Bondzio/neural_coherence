1.1.1	i have 2 hard drives , one of which is thw boot drive .	St
1.1.2	is it possible to make the other one the boot drive ?	Ques
1.2.1	If so , you should be able to switch between drives through the BIOS .	St
1.2.2	But , by default , most will look for the master drive on the first IDE channel .	St
1.2.3	So , you can also change drive jumpers to accomplish this or , if using cable select , switch positions on the IDE cable .	St
1.2.4	Since you did not mention anything about hardware , I am presuming you are using IDE HDs .	St
1.2.5	If you are using SATA drives , BIOS or cable selection is still how it 's done .	St
1.3.1	Open up the computer and make de master as slave and the second make-it master .	St
