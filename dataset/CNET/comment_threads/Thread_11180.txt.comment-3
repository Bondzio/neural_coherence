Too bad I don't have another motherboard.
A new MB from HP is like $799, or one from Ebay for maybe $300, plus the time and hassle to change it (not my favorite chore).
I don't think the owner is willing to spend that much at this point, but if a new MB was the only way, then we'd be able to make a decision on it.
But I can't buy one just to try it.
I asked the question hoping somebody had a similar experience, or as &quot;is there any possible solution that I'm not aware of&quot;- short of a new MB.
I have a feeling I may be owning this laptop if it comes cheaply enough.
