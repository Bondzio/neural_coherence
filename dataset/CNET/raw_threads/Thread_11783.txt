Looking to spend the minimum for a system useable for a couple of years - under $500 total. I don't have the specs on the win98 right now, but it was a top of the line system in 1998(K5or6? AMD chip), designed for scientific research/big number crunching, and has a monitor that works, network card, etc. My 4 year old twins are using computers at pre-school already and keep wanting to use my Dell Inspiron E1705 laptop - no way! They have an older brother in another household with a playstation - so they want to play games too (as does he when he visits). If it was just the little ones, I think I might be able to make my old windows 98 machine do, but I don't know if it could handle Power Rangers Super Legends (what they are begging for). ADVICE?

Since that game is on the PS2, just put it there -&gt; http://www.us.playstation.com/PS2/Games/Power_Rangers_Super_Legends As to the 299 desktops, I'm unsure what you mean by bait and switch. I walk into these stores put the box in the cart, wheel it up to the cash register and check out. Isn't that how it works? Bob

I'm very doubtful that you would find much software on the market today that will run on a Windows 98 computer. I personally am not familiar with &quot;Power Rangers Super Legends&quot; but if it's a recent game it almost certainly will require more computer than an old Win98 machine. You would probably be restricted to whatever software you already have for it, or any you could locate. As far as the &quot;$299&quot; computers, in my experience their upgrade -ability is usually limited or non-existent, so if you can't get what you want up-front with one, you're probably not going to be doing many improvements in the future.

The PS2 is at the older brother's house, not mine - he just visits. I'm not a total grinch - I will let the boys have a few games since they want them so bad, but only on a computer where I have more control. Besides, I bought a nice TV for the family room because I want to watch a movie or the news in the evening - not level 5 of Dragonslayer XV. I'm asking about the &quot;realistic&quot; system requirements because I don't play games or know anyone else that does. I need help with what is a useable low level system these days, because I haven't used something less than a powerhouse for the past decade. What I need for GIS applications is extreme overkill for surfing the web or word processing. My problem with $299 computers? - probably nothing for a knowledgable user like on this board, but they are advertised towards the first time buyer/novice user, who often gets taken advantage of when they go to the store to get it. I've heard the same story too many times from my freshman students, and especially elderly friends and family members. Bait and Switch - advertise a very low price machine and sell an expensive one. If it is a useable out of the box system they only have extremely limited numbers in stock with no rainchecks, or if in stock, it is most often a stripped down machine that requires an additional $500+ to be min. functional. If you understand what comes (or doesn't come) with a $299 system they can be great deals for the knowledgeable. I'm upset that salesmen pounce on the gulliable first time buyer who comes in thinking they are going to walk out the door with a brand new $300 computer fully loaded and ready to go and either steer them to a much more expensive system (usually put on a store branded credit card at 24.9% interest)which is what happens to my students, or sell them expensive monitors, keyboards, printers, etc and unneeded peripherals and software . Last spring salesmen at one of the big elecronics stores convinced my widowed neighbor that she had to have an expensive monitor, joysticks and gamepads, wireless everything, wireless networking, etc - OH -and of course the $299 system couldn't take the network,video, and sound cards she &quot;had to&quot; have, so she ended up with an upgraded system suitable for a serious gamer - all because she mentioned her grandkids visit at the holidays. Basically they sold her the system they wanted. Thousands of wasted dollars for a little 69 y.o. grandmother, first time user, who wanted to be able to receive email from her family,print photographs, and look up medical information on the web. The real kicker - when she got concerned about the escalating price - they threw in a &quot;free&quot; printer - which is absolutely lousy at both text and color printing. Yes, probably one of her kids (500 miles away) should have gone with her, but I resent the fact that novice computer users, who often have the least money to waste, are misled by ads in newspaper flyers and fall prey to these shady practices. Some of these guys give used car salesmen a run for their money.

Not that there are that many programs left that run on 2000 either probably. We just kept it around at win98 to run some old programs, and it is the trusty back-up everytime the new ones crash and burn - it always works! One of the two hard drives had to be replaced when it was 18 months old - no other problems since then. It is the indestructable beast - built in a local computer shop in Tucson, it has outlasted 3 newer workstations (2 Dells and a HP) - that is why I thought it could withstand 4 year olds. If I knew a good computer repair place around here I'd buy a used XP, but I'm in a small town and have not been impressed with the one I know in town - their used computers are really overpriced. That is why if I don't use the win98, I'm looking for something new but cheap for the kids- I'm probably going to have to buy on-line.

For games I have to write that today you want a Core 2 Duo, 2GB RAM and the Nvidia 8800 or better display card. At 99 bucks for a PS2 I think this is the better solution and it has that game they want. As to the bait and switch I must be not going to the right stores. Bob

To use it as a TV, would require dropping new coax - not easy in a old house and get a second sat. receiver and monthly fee. No cost savings at all. The game station won't enable them to use the internet, educational software, or do their homework assignments -yes, preschoolers have homework now!- that even the old win98 computer will. The game use is really the least important reason I'm getting them their own computer. BUT, if I do have a system which can play some games, then it might cut down on the whining from their brother when he visits, since it seems he can't go a weekend without constant TV and video games.

So I can see 99 bucks for the PS2, 10 bucks for that and whatever for the game. Far cheaper than what a &quot;gamer PC&quot; will cost. Bob
