Apparently, it comes pre-loaded with a few different performance specs to make overclocking easier, or at least that's my take on it. The only company I know of that manufactures SLI RAM is Corsair, and that's due to the partnership they created with Nvidia to use the SLI moniker. It isn't going to enhance SLI performance, it's just using the same 3 letters. It should work just as well as any other RAM on the market.
