I have just put together a PC with an AMD 2800+Athlon processor, an Abit NF7-S2 motherboard, a GeForce MX 4000 Display Card,512 MB Crucial PC 3200 RAM. When I switch on the power, the CPU and Case fans start up, the led lights come on but the computer doesn't boot. The monitor shows a &quot;no signal&quot; message. I have cleared the cmos several times, taken out the battery and replaced it after about twenty minutes and I have insulated the motherboard from the case so I know it's not grounding. Does anyone have any ideas. Thanks, Bert

A MB is suppose to be grounded to that case, BUT only where the standoffs for the mounting screws go. Try a min post. MB,PSU, 1 stick of memory, CPU/heatsink/fan,video card,keyboard and speaker.
