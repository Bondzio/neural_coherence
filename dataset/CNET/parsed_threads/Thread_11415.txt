<s> My ISP is Telus.. we have the Speedtouch ST516v6 modem the modem is rated up to 10Mbps and my ISP can provide up to 15Mbps the setup: ISP &gt; DLink (DIR815) wireless router &gt; 2 Netgear Gigabit GS108 switches. </s>
<s> first switch is for the house computers (4-5 computers, all wired connection) second switch has 2 routers connected, they are on different floors. </s>
<s> router2 is a linksys router3 is a netgear. </s>
<s> what settings should be changed in order for people to connect too.. Im expecting anywhere from 30-60 users on at any given time. </s>
<s> there are people telling me that they sometimes arent connecting or connected but have no internet. </s>
<s> Ok.. so I take it that people on the second switch are losing connection. </s>
<s> I'm also think that anyone who is directly connect is not reporting the issues or having any connection problem. </s>
<s> Are the only people reporting the issues are the linksys and netgear? </s>
<s> If this is the case what model type of router's are these and do they have a bridge setting so you can create one wireless network bridge. </s>
<s> One thing is to put the wireless route on different channels so they cancel each other signal. </s>
<s> try it. </s>
<s> let me know. </s>
<s> Always here to help. </s>
<s> If this was in the NYC, I would recommend calling Point to Point Solution, young guys that know alot of networking and fix problems like this one. </s>
<s> this is there link http://www.ptps.us/ -chris </s>
<s> right now, i have done a 30/30/30 reset on the linksys and netgear routers so they are on default settings.. it seems a lot better but could be even better... maybe i should try to flash the tomato or DDWRT firmware.. might work better. </s>
<s> Hi, Using the network cable that came with your wireless router temporarily connect your computer to one of the open network ports on your wireless router. </s>
<s> You must turn on your computer, then it will automatically connect to your router. </s>
<s> The next step is going to Internet explorer and type in the address to configure your router. </s>
<s> Then you might be prompted for a password. </s>
<s> The address and password depend on what type of router you have. </s>
<s> You have to refer the instructions included with your router. </s>
<s> The last step is connecting your computer to the wireless network. </s>
