Here's why.
Most P4's and specifically the 3.0GHz unit draws 70 to 90 Watts just for the CPU alone.
The Micro-ATX case is not suitable for most P4s since the case can't exhaust that much heat.
-&gt; May I suggest you abandon this upgrade and focus on optimising what you have now.
-&gt; Yes there are a few 300 Watt Micro-ATX power supplies, but in light of the case is not designed for this much heat removal, you would be foolish to do this.
