<s> I'm trying to find information on what printers are the most environmentally friendly. </s>
<s> I bought an Epson inkjet several years ago, and they say the cartridges aren't recyclable, but HP cartridges are. </s>
<s> I'm also considering a laser printer, and want to know what the environmental issues are there too. </s>
<s> But so far I haven't found any info on this on cnet. </s>
<s> Can someone help? </s>
<s> HP may have the edge here. </s>
<s> Their program of laser cartridge return have been around for years. </s>
<s> Now they have implemented more avenues to return spent cartridges, printers and PCs back to HP for them to deal with. </s>
<s> Your discussion is not about ink refills. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If you're in the USA, many a shop may have a &quot;return envelope&quot; w/free shipping to return *ANY* ink cart of any brand, provided it fits of course. </s>
<s> As for laser toner empties, HP and others provide a return box or service for same to again return to HP or namebrand source. </s>
<s> Many office supply outlets accept ink or toner carts and may even provide an item in exchange. </s>
<s> offcie Max, give a ream of paper for orginal ink cart empty. </s>
<s> Also, Ofiice or Offic eDeport accept computer items as thier drop-off points. </s>
<s> IBM and HP I believe accept these as well when you buy a new system. </s>
<s> So look around and/or go online and check for it. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> something else must get dirty. </s>
<s> Yours is a good question and deserves a lot of thought IMHO. </s>
<s> But, one must keep things in perspective. </s>
<s> When you recycle, it might just mean that you don't have to see the item in your own trash. </s>
<s> As was mentioned in the other posts, there are recycling avenues. </s>
<s> Some schools and non-profit organizations have cartridge recycling programs which provide cash or goods for such items. </s>
<s> You can research this. </s>
<s> Office supply centers allow you to drop off cartridges and then they sell their own brand of compatibles. </s>
<s> Hmmm, could your cartridge deposit be refilled and resold to you eventually? </s>
<s> A bigger problem may be the printer itself. </s>
<s> A cheap printer may have nearly as much bulk as a better one but last a shorter time. </s>
<s> Hence, more waste may be generated by these over time. </s>
<s> Again, some manufacturers have recycling programs for hardware and some of these are fee based. </s>
<s> Find out what happens to the printer once it's returned as sometimes these can be exchange &quot;come ons&quot; that allow you a discount on a new piece of hardware produced by that manufacturer. </s>
<s> Beware of one that offers a competitive trade in as these will take another manufacturers item as well. </s>
<s> These may not get recycled but just dumped to get it out of circulation. </s>
<s> Now, to emphasize my opening remark...you can get injet refill kits. </s>
<s> These might or might not work for you. </s>
<s> You may be happy to get multiple uses from a cartridge before you toss it. </s>
<s> Some recyclers don't want refilled ones, however, and you still have the plastic refill kit to dispose of eventually. </s>
<s> I'm not trying to talk you out of your &quot;earth friendly&quot; intentions. </s>
<s> I applaud and we attempt such in our home. </s>
<s> Study and do it wisely as manufacturers have their businesses in mind first and, for some of them, waste improves their bottom line. </s>
<s> Great question! </s>
