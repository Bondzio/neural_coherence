1.1.1	So it has finally come time to replace our 6 year old PC, and after some looking, I've decided to get a custom PC.	St
1.1.2	Lacking the knowledge/desire to build it myself, I've decided to use Georgia Computer Workshop (www.gcworkshop.com) I am trying to keep the computer under $650, not including the monitor, and I have a couple of questions: First, has anyone ever used or heard of Georgia Computer Workshop?	St
1.1.3	I can only find precious little information about it.	St
1.1.4	What I have found has been good, but lacking in quantity.	St
1.1.5	Second, the computer itself.	St
1.1.6	I am planning on using an Athlon 64 x2 4200+ processor, 2 gigabytes of RAM, about 200 gigabytes of hard drive space, and a GeForce 7600GS.	St
1.1.7	I am fairly stumped when it comes to the motherboard.	St
1.1.8	What exactly would constitute as a good motherboard?	St
1.1.9	Most every other component I can research and understand what they are talking about, but I am clueless when it comes to the main component of the computer.	St
1.1.10	Also, what type of power supply would I need?	St
1.1.11	The case I am using comes with a 450W power supply.	St
1.1.12	I assume this would be fine, but it is always nice to know.	St
1.1.13	Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated Thanks	Ques
1.2.1	Antec Nine Hundred is a good choice for case.	St
1.3.1	motherboards are becoming like hard drives.	St
1.3.2	there's little difference in performance of the latest generation and almost all are good.	St
1.3.3	for the amd platform, there are two primary chipsets: nvidia 500 series and amd's 580 & 690. since you didn't mention using dual graphics cards, either chipset will be fine.	St
1.3.4	then you just need to decide what features you want on the mobo.	St
1.3.5	here are two good inexpensive mobos.	St
1.3.6	biostar nforce 520, $50: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813138077 msi amd 690v, $55: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130092	St
