$150 is a very practical range esp if u shop at newegg.com (great service.
a lot of free shipping.
no hassle awesome return policy.
they sell oems tho).
anyway i know apricorn and seagate are good companies.
i heard about lacie being good but i never see one first hand.
just dont get maxtor.
but my real suggestion is... use of an external encloser.
get an aluminum enclosure with a fan from mapower and a good seagate internal harddrive and ur ready to go.
think it'd be a bigger bang for the buck too and not as much bucks lol.
hope this helps.
