6023	0	341603	3037935	NR	crunchynut93	5/4/09 1:42 PM	1.24144452E12	Another hard drive problem.	My Lacie D2 Quadra is lying on a flat surface, and has been working for a year or so. It has begun to click repeatedly for about two clicks a second. Along with the clicking, though, I can hear the disk whirring up and then slowing, and trying again and again. It won't mount to OS X. Now obviously this is quite a problem, but how can I solve it? I will take it to a repair shop if I have to, but the shops around my area cost megamoney. Please help.
