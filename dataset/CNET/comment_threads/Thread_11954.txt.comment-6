When the laptop was connected to the tosh-drop, were you able to ping the laptop and can you ping another device from it?
You said the that it picked up an ip address from a dhcp, that's dynamic.
If you have the dhcp set up to give it a number, make sure the tosh-printer is set do take an ip dynamically (or automatically).
Don't try to give it a static address.
If you're required to give it a static address, then make sure you have the right subnet and gateway.
