i too, bought this screen as soon as it got out even before samsung advertised it.
funny thing is, i was calling them (samsung product support) from bestbuy to learn more because no one knew about it, and strangely enough, even samsung reps couldn't tell me anything.
i had also the gateway fpd2185w, and let me tell you, it is crap compared to this samsung!!
cnet's reviewers gave it close to 8 points, i thought it was exaggerated.
this samsung supports high definition input through its component with resolutions of 480p 720p and 1080i.
very crisp and vivid picture.
i compared the gateway side by side, and the samsung takes the gateway out easily.
i have tried it with the xbox 360 and boy i tell you it is wonderful.
its 8ms refresh rate and 1000:1 contrast give you a superb quality.
really, if you are looking to spend nearly $600, this is your monitor.
it gives you 3 years (!)
of warranty compared to lousy 1 year with gateway.
oh yes also their sales and support suck and shameful.
go for the samsung!
