thanks for the reply.
the computer is brand new, out of the box so spyware shouldn't be an issue, and i can't believe the bios would be outdated already.
i think dell is just pushing machines that aren't compatible with wireless adapter cards.
anyway, i decided to compromise and use a usb adapter.
not as fast but so much easier!
