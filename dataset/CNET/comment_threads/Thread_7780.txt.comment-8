I fixed two earlier Dells by replacing the PS since it was having trouble recognizing the drives.
Be very careful with the new Dell systems as they have a Dell proprietary (non-standard) ATX design.
This means that pin 1 and 3 have ground on them where the standard ATX has +5 volts and a couple other pin mismatches.
