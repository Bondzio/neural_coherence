3916	0	110403	1254660	NR	JohnS1377	6/21/05 12:21 AM	1.11931326E12	Help needed	Alright...I have recentely built a computer and am having early trouble. I have a p4 3.0e, 1024 of ram, 6600gt vcard, asus P4800SE, a harddrive from a dell( ATA IV seagate barracuda), and a cd/rw drive from the dell, and a floppy from the dell. My computer recognizes the p4, ram, vcard...but i keep getting an error message &quot;Primary Slave Drive - ATAPI Incompatible&quot; My harddrive was quick formated, and I have not installed windows, due to the fact that I can not. Any help would be greatly appreciated... thanks in advance
