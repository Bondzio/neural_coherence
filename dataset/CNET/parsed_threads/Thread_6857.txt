<s> I have an IBM thinkcenter. </s>
<s> It is a windows XP os. </s>
<s> I used Avast anti virus and kept it up to date. </s>
<s> Computer will turn on and then after going thru the opening of MS Windows XP the desktop will show up. </s>
<s> After a minute of start up (Avast tells you virus definitions are up to date) the hard drive stops making its usual sounds and the screen freezes. </s>
<s> NO mouse movement, no chance to use ctrl, alt, delete to begin using any system problem solutions or nothing. </s>
<s> I bought it from amazon dot com as a refurbished item. </s>
<s> It is a 3 gig processor with 2 gigs of ram, 160 hard drive with a DVD rom drive. </s>
<s> It worked great since purchasing it in Feb of this year. </s>
<s> Always ran system scans of AVast, disk clean up and disc frag done two weeks prior to this problem. </s>
<s> I always use the shutdown feature for turning off the computer. </s>
<s> Don't visit porn sites or open attachments I don't know who sent them. </s>
<s> Any help will be great. </s>
<s> Boot to safe mode and see if it still freezes. </s>
<s> If not, you may be looking at faulty hardware or a corrupt driver. </s>
<s> It's a pain but, if it works in safe mode, you use selective startup until you find the culprit. </s>
