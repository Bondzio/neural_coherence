<s> I am looking to set up a wireless connection to an existing wired network for an attorneys office that I am working with, we want to start with one computer connected to the wireless network to start off but we also want that computer to be able to print from the shared printer currently connected to the wired network, is that possible? </s>
<s> Also we want to create a separate guest account within that same network in order to allow clients that may come into the office to be able to log into the network using their laptops, but not have the same access or capability as the rest of the staff. </s>
<s> Please let me know what would be the best way to set this up. </s>
