it seem to me you lack some experience I did have problem with Dlls.
but that was becouse I did deleted it when I got my first pc also make sure you get an ativirus ans a firewall there are some good free software around if you google it .playing games online will infest your pc with trojans .
faronics.ca sells a program named ( deep freeze)to freeze up the hard drive ,once the hard drive is frozen you can delete whatever you like and as soon you reboot the pc everything will be there ,I bought it and cost only $40.00 canadian .you can try it for 30 day free this is the site for, deep freeze http://www.faronics.com/canada/
