<s> Some how I wound up with a small square in the middle of the monitor display. </s>
<s> Its a samsung monitor on a windows media center (older model) computer running xp. </s>
<s> Need to know how to get rid of it </s>
<s> Hit the &quot;start&quot; button of the windows and then type, DXDIAG. </s>
<s> Allow it to run its tests, if they report or still show that square area is present with no error to report, then you have either a true h/w fault. </s>
<s> The quick test is to unplug the monitor from PC and then the OSD(reset) testing or simply access it. </s>
<s> Once there check the setting or review them. </s>
<s> If the small square still appears then some fault is present with the display itself. </s>
<s> If it goes away once you unplug, then returns after you reconnect to PC, then maybe some driver or s/w issue. </s>
<s> If there was some recent video upgrade or display issue and you tried to correct, then the problem appeared, undo that work. </s>
<s> You may try using the system restore feature in such a case. </s>
