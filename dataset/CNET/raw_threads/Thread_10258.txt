After changing the image back to the original all seemed ok till I closed down my computer. As it was going through the process of closing down,The image was flashed on the screen instead of the blue screen i normally see. Now as i start up my computer the image shows up as background for the start up process and shut down process, how do i remove this image from my system?? The Image does not show up as a background pic in my control panel for the display. I'm using Win2000 pro
