okay, so you're saying that the usb hardware was fine, it was just the data that got zapped?
i see your point.
now, i do know there are some flash drives that have a read only switch, similar to how old floppies worked.
i assume there is no way to make a hdd read-only however?
in that case, it seems that for a safer backup method, flash drive wins in that respect.
