<s> Hello, Animations and rendered stills - which is a great desktop? </s>
<s> I am a 3rd year achitecture student that is keen in rendering. </s>
<s> Right now my college has some pretty bad desktops, low performance and reliability issues, and I am using my macbook pro: (2.53gh core 2 duo, 512mb nvidia 9600GTM, 4gb 1067mhz ddr3 RAM) to do the renders. </s>
<s> I find it really is more reliable than the school computers, but is still slow and running windows on bootcamp is so risky, so I am intersted in buying a desktop and was wondering which you would recommend. </s>
<s> If you are an architecture student out there you will know that next year is my year of placement (work) so will not be needing it as much then, so it may not be worth it seeming as in 2 years there will be another awesome machine. </s>
<s> Please architecture or non-architecture student help is all welcome. </s>
<s> You have the school machines, your machine and only need to get by till then. </s>
<s> Also there is a big change brewing in the PC/Mac world so my advice today is to put more rubberbands around your wallet. </s>
