since the windows vista rig i am using has two 128gb ssd's in raid 0 format.
nothing like chancing fate huh?
ssd in raid 0, it's been going since july 2009, but i had to reinstall vista at the new year.
it's not turned on continuously, when i don't use it i shut down, but it's on several hours a day.
