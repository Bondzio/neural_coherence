<s> I'm trying to connect a SMC7004VBR Router to a D-Link DI-704P Router. </s>
<s> First of all can this be done? </s>
<s> The D-Link has the actual ISP line connected to it. </s>
<s> It then has four other connections off that, which one leads to my system. </s>
<s> I'm trying to take this connection and use it as the uplink to my SMC Router and use the router for two other systems in my office. </s>
<s> I was running of a hub at first but found it was way too slow. </s>
<s> My problem is not getting a connection, cause as soon as I plugged in the SMC Router it worked right away and had a connection to the internet. </s>
<s> What I'm trying to do is login to the SMC which will not allow me. </s>
<s> Also tried running the SMC setup wizard CD choosing both the Cable Connection and Static IP options and getting the same error message which says: &quot;Adapter gateway IP address does not match the router, reset the router(sometimes it says reset router for 30 secs). </s>
<s> I tried doing both and running the setup again. </s>
<s> Still doesn't work. </s>
<s> This is not a major concern because I am connected. </s>
<s> I would just like to have the option to adjust settings/preferences like forwarding ports and such whenever I need to. </s>
<s> Anyone have any advice. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, Andy </s>
<s> Here's a guy who got a similar scenario working&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.homecomputerrepaironline.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=80 I would opt for a switch off the router to simplify the setup. </s>
