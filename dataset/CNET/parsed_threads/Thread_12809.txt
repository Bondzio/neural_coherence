<s> I returned home today to find a burning smell coming out of my computer room. </s>
<s> When I went in there I noticed my GE Optical Mouse had melted itself into a mess and was proceeding to burn a hole in my mouse pad. </s>
<s> I ended up having to turn off the computer and wait till the mouse was cool enough to remove it. </s>
<s> But not my PC won't come back on. </s>
<s> Has anyone else had their mouse melt on them? </s>
<s> While unusual, such things do happen when power supplies fail. </s>
<s> I was witness to a total machine wipeout when the power supply failed. </s>
<s> Not much survived. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> You mean since it melted? </s>
<s> Yeah it's unplugged. </s>
<s> I can understand how a faulty power supply could fry my motherboard, but how would it cause the laser in my mouse to start burning things? </s>
<s> I know that laser devices use thermal cooling chips to regulate the temprature of the laser so that something like this would never happen. </s>
<s> But I've never heard of one going out. </s>
<s> My thoughts are GE just bought cheap parts. </s>
<s> - How about the 5V power supply rail went to 10V. </s>
<s> What would all the parts think about about that? </s>
<s> - You wouldn't believe how many machines I've removed the cover to find loose screws floating inside the case. </s>
<s> Let's ask what happens if this conductive material lands in the right spot. </s>
<s> What would happen? </s>
<s> - Many homemade PCs get built with an extra mounting post in the area of the back of the motherboard. </s>
<s> It's fatal about 50% of the time. </s>
<s> Your story is a bit rare, but not unbelievable. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well when I left the computer it was off. </s>
<s> Also it is a factory build eMachine and I haven't been inside the case so I really shouldn't have loose screws. </s>
<s> And the power supply going from 5V to 10V would be bad but wouldn't the motherboard already have the components inplace to keep that from affecting the mouse? </s>
<s> I'm not saying it's impossible for the PS/2 port to receive more power than normal, but while the computer is off, and there's nothing shorting it out? </s>
<s> Such failures do occur and now it's your choice to open it up to see if you can sniff out what's dead or ??? </s>
<s> What direction are you going here? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm just trying to see if anyone else has ever had such a problem. </s>
<s> And what might be similar to my situation. </s>
<s> I know there's a good number of things that could cause this to happen but a google search on this subject hasn't returned any other instances of this problem. </s>
<s> So what better than to ping the world for other people with the same problem. </s>
<s> Not that the mouse melted, but nice smoke as anything on the 5 Volt rail fried. </s>
<s> The causes for the dead machines I've seen are all over the map (I listed a few.) </s>
