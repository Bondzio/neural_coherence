i am looking at this same model and as the previous poster pointed out i am in fact looking for a desktop replacement.
much of the time this laptop will be docked to a 22 inch monitor, keyboard and mouse but i want the flexibility to pick up my office and take it with me and not sacrifice on performance.
that office needs to support a host of typical office products, heavy multi-tasking, as well as supporting cpu and intensive image and video editing.
for the price tag it better be an office on the go.
if like me you do intend to make this an office on the go you probably need to look into a storage network while docked, the paltry hd drives here are enough to keep the essential apps and travel data loaded but you will need to make alternate arrangements when docked.
