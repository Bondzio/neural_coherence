10746	0	255400	2533508	NR	matthailey	7/7/07 4:06 AM	1.18378116E12	Graphics card - DVI to VGA	Hi, I have just ordered new parts for a computer, which has not yet arrived, including a Sapphire Radeon X1950PRO 512MB DDR3 and two monitors with only VGA input. The graphics card has dual DVI output and i was hoping to just use two converters (DVI - VGA) to connect the screens. I have now, however, just read that some DVI outputs called DVI-D do not support these adapters and cannot be used on VGA monitors. Please tell me if this graphics card will work with them or not! I can't seem to find if it does or not on the aria.co.uk website. It only says: Digital video standard: Digital Visual Interface (DVI) Many thanks.

Additionally, if the card is including adapters, likely an indicator of the adapters working (Sapphire wouldn't sell you extras that won't work with the main product, wastes their money). One thing on using DVI to VGA adapters, ensure they are attached firmly before you attach the monitor, if they wiggle around it can actually bend their plugs (and cause various distortion on the screen). Also, as it sounds like you wanna do multi-monitor with this X1950, remember to download HydraVision from ATI (www.ati.com) if it isn't included on the CD, it'll give you better driver-side support for multiple displays.

If your card has DVI-I (or DVI-D) outputs, a single DVI-D-&gt;VGA (Or DVI-I-&gt;VGA) adapter is usually included in the box (unless it is &quot;White box&quot;, in which case, only the last driver the card manufacturer released will be included in the package, along with no adapters (or cables) other than the card itself.) ATI has always been good about supplying all necessary cables and adapters in their retail packages. &quot;White Box&quot; editions are horses of a different color. You might get lucky, tho, if you went &quot;White box&quot; to save money. Sometimes, all necessary adapters and cables are included with the card in a &quot;White Box&quot;. Donald McDaniel
