Bob do you know if these chip resetters really work?
Looking on line and they run about $70.
Read in a few blogs that people bought them and they worked but they are not available here in the USA.
Have to buy from ebay seller in Germany.
A little apprehensive about that but it would certainly solve my problem with the Canon.
