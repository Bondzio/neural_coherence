my only concern with the &quot;lazy&quot; way is: won't i lose the benefit of the 801.11n transfer rates because it will bottle neck at the d-link router?
because of that, i'm thinking that setting it up with the dual nat config would be the better of the two options.
don't think i would need to map anything to the security system - but won't know until i set it up i guess.
