<s> Hi all, I have just installed a Windows Vista upgrade onto one of my machines, upgrading from Home Premium to Ultimate. </s>
<s> Now, it seems that the CD/DVD drive doesn't work anymore. </s>
<s> You can't see it on 'My computer' and when you put a disk or a DVD in, nothing happens. </s>
<s> Everything else seems to be ok, all other drives are present, and all USB devices are recognised and work fine. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any experience of this happening, or have any ideas on how to fix it? </s>
<s> Cheers, Ray </s>
