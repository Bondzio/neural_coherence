That CPU was not known to survive much...
But you should go for beeps.
Just four parts.
PSU, CPU/HSF, motherboard and speaker.
No beeps= you are looking at the bad parts.
Another issue is that the boards with SDRAM or DDRAM support required a lot of configuration.
If one did unplug one type of RAM and instll the other type without changing the jumpers, my bet is that you could fry something on the motherboard.
I hope you configured it proper.
