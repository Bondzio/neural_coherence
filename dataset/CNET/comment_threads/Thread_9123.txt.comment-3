you have flashed latest SSD firmware and Mobo BIOS.
If you can get your hands on a hard drive, try with it instead of the SSD.
Assuming you are using W7 or 8.
If it turns out that you do have to shop for another SSD, look at Crucial's m4 - has a good range of compatibility with mobos and CPUs.
And of course you must flash its latest FW.
Good luck.
