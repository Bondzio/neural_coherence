my dell aio 964 scanning and copying facility just packed in and i'm on the lookout for a new one.
i purchased a dell wireless adapter to enable wireless capabilities and it worked well.
my question is, will this adapter work with any other make of printer and if so, will it work with any printer that has usb connection.
thanks.
