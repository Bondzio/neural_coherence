<s> 01) Can anyone recommend a good monthly cell provider coverage for a built-in 4GWiMax cellular chip that is in a laptop I am thinking of purchasing? </s>
<s> 02) I was told that with a built-in 4GWiMax cellular chip that if I am not a light user that there will be bandwidth caps. </s>
<s> What are bandwidth caps and how do I get around them? </s>
<s> 03) If the laptop I decide to purchase has a 4GWiMax cellular chip already installed and I have a monthly contract with a provider, will I be able to connect to the internet anywhere/anytime? </s>
<s> The reason is the location, location and location determines coverage. </s>
<s> I'm unsure if I can make this clearer than this. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The reasons for the caps are well discussed. </s>
<s> I can't add much but if there are ways around it my bet the only legal one is to use some local wifi connection. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> No. </s>
<s> As we know from answer #1 that some places have no service. </s>
<s> But today you find new folk that have to be told this many times. </s>
<s> Sometimes that answer is taken badly and they complain the answer is mean or harsh but look at how cell phones work today. </s>
<s> Everyone I know has a dropped call. </s>
<s> Same for this anywhere, anytime answer. </s>
<s> The answer is no. </s>

<s> I would avoid any built in chips. </s>
<s> It is much simpler to get a different adapter if your requirements change compared to getting a new laptop. </s>
<s> Not sure who told you that about WiMax. </s>
<s> This is the technology used in the sprint/clear network. </s>
<s> It is the same network but if you buy it from sprint and you run only 4g they have a uncapped plan. </s>
<s> This is the only uncapped data plan I know of. </s>
<s> The fine print is if you do not get enough 4G signal and switch to 3G there is a cap. </s>
<s> Will see the future of WiMax, there are rumors sprint/clear may change to LTE. </s>
<s> Your other choice is mostly verizon using LTE for 4G. </s>
<s> Att is suppose to roll out some LTE 4G this summer. </s>
<s> All these have caps of various forms. </s>
<s> A few other smaller providers have LTE but most only allow usage on smart phone, no PC. </s>
<s> Everything else that is called 4G that is not LTE or WiMAX is quite a bit slower. </s>
<s> The bad news is coverage is very limited, this is new technology. </s>
<s> Verizon if they do what they say they are should be the first to offer 4G coverage in a large area. </s>
<s> Still it is a long way off to expect good coverage outside of major cities. </s>
<s> Of course ATT promises lots but they are just starting to turn up their first towers. </s>
<s> But today, the tech as it stands and the companies behind it all is &quot;all about maximizing the return on investment.&quot; You may find the wired solutions to compete well with wireless. </s>
