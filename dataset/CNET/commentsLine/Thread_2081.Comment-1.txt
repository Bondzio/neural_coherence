hi all, i have a very pesky network printing problem on my home network.
i have two vista home computers, one xp computer and a printer in my home network.
printer is connected to the network through a wirless switch together with one of the vista computers that it is connected to.
the network is connected to internet through a wireless router (although two vista computers are connected to it through wire).
everythig in the network is working fine except for one thing.
i cannot print from one of the non-admin accounts on the vista computer that does not have the printer connected to it.
printing works from the admin account on that computer.
i use norton security on all 3 computers in the network and and have setup a full trust in norton to all devices in the network.
the printer sharing is setup such that everybody can share and use the printer.
when i send the document to print from this non-admin user account it sends the document but printer never reacts.
the document status in print queue displays &quot;printing&quot;.
would anybody know what else i need to do?
thanks, milorad
