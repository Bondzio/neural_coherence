sadly these are a little advanced.
the items are registry ownership and permissions in the keys that control this.
also, any cd emulation software can cause this to fail (example cd daemon.)
sorry but for this one the issue can run fairly deep so i don't have a do this cure for this one.
however once i eject cd emulation software and remove the drives in device manager (i see that in this discussion) a reboot and usually this works.
one last item... the account we use must be one of the admin capable ones.
