i have been looking into nas for this situation as well.
i cannot seem to find a reliable, reasonably priced nas that will suite their needs.
i have been reading a lot of reviews on different nas devices and some people love them and some hate them.
wasting an xp license isn't really a problem.
i have extra one at the moment and also have a licensed copy of windows 2000 that i no longer use.
i'm still researching all possibilities and haven't ruled the nas out yet.
i also need the system easy for them to switch to a backup incase the nas or pc dies.
thanks michael
