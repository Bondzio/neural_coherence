My goal is to replace my current 500 GB external hard drive because it is getting full.
I feel that 2 TB will be sufficient and I would like any connection type faster than USB 2.0.
I need this external storage to do 2 things (2 partitions): store time machine backups, and store my large files that would clog up my laptop's hard drive.
I would like to have RAID 1 so that I have a backup for the large files which are only saved on the external storage, in case one external drive failed.
Like I said, I have no experience with RAID.
If you know of another way to accomplish these goals please let me know.
