Here is my scenario: I have an office LAN with few computers with an internet connection via a radio, in which the radio (antenna) serves as a DHCP server. Now I have incorporated a prosafe dual-band wireless VPN firewall (FWAG114) to serve as an access point to some system within the network. The wireless connection works quite well, only that I can not access my network resources through the wireless connection. Thanks in advance.

Are the wireless computers given permissions to access the network resources? Before you installed the firewall, was every computer available to access the network resources? Just a few questions...
