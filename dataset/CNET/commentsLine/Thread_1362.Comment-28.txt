you're not lucky.
you're just smart but perhaps you didn't realise it yet.
herer's my story.
1.5 years ago my notebook hd of 20gb was as full as possible.
and my external hd of 70gb was acting weird.
so i thought i'd buy a wd250gb.
some people warned me not to buy a maxtor (now=seagate fyi).
so the wd was a good buy.
it kept running almost 24/7 for several months.
after a while i thought i might buy a second external hd as a backup for my wd.
the wd was sold out, so i thought why not buy a lacie that looked real cool.
it was also a 250gb.
however when i plugged it in my pc i saw it had a maxtor in it.
being warned b4 i hoped it would last.
however it didn't last longer than 3 months and gave bad cluster warnings.
i don't think this was coincidence: the lacie with the maxtor drive in it was always very warm (no metal case but a plastic case barely bigger than a 2.5&quot; hd) while the wd had an alu case that was very cool (the case was also some 80% bigger) so if you're gonna buy an external hd watch out what's in it.
also some do it yourself hd cases do not have a fan in the kit !!!
even if they gave me a maxtor (seagate) for free i wouldn't want it.
oh !
and btw my western digital is still running almost 20h a day !
