okay that makes sense for things i'll be updating regularly.
of course, in the unlikely event that stuff gets zapped on writeable media i'd be out of luck.
i've heard disabling auto-play in windows prevents viruses that attack usb drives from destroying your data.
of course, that's not going to help if you aren't even aware you have the virus in the first place but i have avast pro and spybot search & destroy installed, so i'm pretty safe unless i get nailed by a zero-day virus, but i highly doubt that.
i don't open suspicious email attachments and only download things from reliable sources.
but my question is, taken from the poster above, a pc he was working with corrupted the data on the usb devices.
would disabling auto-play work in that instance?
of course, we might need specifics of what exactly was going on with that computer to figure that one out.
just trying to cover all my bases.
