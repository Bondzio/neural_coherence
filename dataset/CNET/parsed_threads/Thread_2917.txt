<s> I know the steps of trfansfering VHS tapes to my computer. </s>
<s> However, there are a few individuals in my life that don't have a clue or really want to get that involved and need something simplier. </s>
<s> I know there was a device a few years ago that allowed someone to copy a VHS tape to DVD that was not a regular DVD/VHS Recorder. </s>
<s> This was portable and not much bigger than the actual VHS cassette. </s>
<s> Has anyone heard of this or have info on it? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> or maybe I don't understand the whole story. </s>
<s> Just another DVD recorder in the small form factor. </s>
<s> Big claims about ease of use so I bet many PAID DEARLY for the lesson. </s>
<s> http://www.howtodothings.com/electronics/a4015-how-to-convert-vhs-to-dvd.html covers the 5 most common methods. </s>
<s> Thanks for the article - I guess the best option might be getting them an external DVD burner. </s>
<s> But now my question would be - what type of file would be created doing this? </s>
<s> MPEG 4? </s>
<s> The easiest ones create &quot;bog standard video DVDs.&quot; Which are mostly MPEG 2. </s>
<s> Anything else would create compatibility headaches. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Pinnacle makes a device for that purpose, it is called a &quot;DAZZLE&quot;, look into that.. </s>
<s> This is for an end-user that really didn't want to get a PC involved in doing transfers. </s>
<s> Originally I was asking about something portable that could do this function - I saw it on a shopping channel a few years ago but I couldn't find it so I guess I will either have to talk them into Dazzle or tell them to forget it </s>
<s> there are devices that can do that. </s>
<s> See here, for one that is fairly modern: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016GCI84/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_3?pf_rd_p=486539851&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=B000ASGFRE&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=1TEW0T1WYA7SBAP0PV90 Here is a Cnet article but they are all old devices now: http://reviews.cnet.com/1990-6463_7-5605370-1.html Of course, one could always pay someone else to do the conversions. </s>
<s> Depending on where you live, the local drug store may provide that service on a &quot;per tape&quot; basis. </s>
<s> And, if you are not allergic to using EBay, you might find a device that someone bought to do VHS tapes and got theirs all done and now offer the device for sale. </s>
<s> I actually found what I'm looking for I think - on ebay - it's an older version of a Sony product - they have more up to date versions available but this one will work for now: Please wait Image not available Sony DVDirect VRD-MC5 </s>
<s> the description you originally stated. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
