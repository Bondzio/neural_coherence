by the way, being an owner of toast and other great roxio products, i can tell you that toast will not copy a commercial dvd.
toast may recognize it and load it for playback, but it won't copy it...unless you can tell me different.
you need to use a dvd rip program first before using toast, but that's a whole other post discussion.
when you go to system preferences as you say you did, what option did you choose for when you insert a dvd?
is &quot;launch dvd player&quot; chosen?
