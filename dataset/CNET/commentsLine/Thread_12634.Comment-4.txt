it is possible that your software firewall on each of the laptops is limiting your speed.
i used computer associates firewall with my roadrunner and it slowed my speed down to a crawl [700 k].
when i turned off that firewall and used windows firewall my speed was okay [at least 5mb].
you could probably do without a software firewall simply because the router has it's own firewall built-in but i personally use window's version anyway in addition the the router's.
