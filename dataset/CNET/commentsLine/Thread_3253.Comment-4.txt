you guys won't believe this but just today i put a dvd into the drive and it worked!!!
i fell of my seat almost literally.
i think i have solved the problem of why it did not work when i first mentioned this on monday.
the drive has drive belts inside that spin the disk.
i am not sure what the belts are made of but they seem to be a bit greasy to the touch and sometimes the drive won't spin properly when the disk is inside it.. dvd disks spin at a higher speed then normal cd or cd rom and i suspect that all this fuss might be due to the crap quality of the drive belts and this &quot;greasy&quot; substance that builds up on them......
