The Via CD provided with the motherboard won't allow me to download the USB 2 driver. Their website says they cannot provide a download because of licence agreements with Microsoft. Microsoft say the download is on service pack 1, but as I have service pack 2 installed, it won't allow me to download SP1. I can't seem to find a USB 2 download on SP 2. The Asus website doesn't seem to mention USB 2. Where on earth can I get a driver to allow me to upgrade to USB 2?
