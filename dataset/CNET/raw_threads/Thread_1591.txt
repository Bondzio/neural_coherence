NOT a combo drive. Any suggestions? Also, unrelated, does anybody have any experience with the Sony Viao desktop RZ502P? Comments? Thx, Sue

Proffitt	8/24/04 3:27 PM	1.09336122E12	Re: Dual Bay Laptops	Just me sharing that I'm leaning to a DVD/CDRW in the laptop and an USB 2.0 or Firewire DVD all format dual layer recorder. Here's why. First I haven't seen a dual layer recorder in the laptops yet. Most are all of 2X speed and if you've done any DVD recording, you may find this much too slow. The heat I see coming out of the 4X recorder I have would make me nervous to have in a laptop. Besides, if the recorder fails, the external is cheap to fix. Bob
