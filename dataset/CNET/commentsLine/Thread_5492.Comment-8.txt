use xp's disk management (see start, help...) and then remove the partition on said drive, create it fresh and let it quick format it.
if the drive is suspect i'll later test it.
to manually start the disk scanner if your computer is formatted with the ntfs file system, run chkdsk /f /r on the new drive letter (start, run, cmd and enter the command there.
you must restart your computer before the disk scan begins.
be sure to have a spare hour for it to work.
