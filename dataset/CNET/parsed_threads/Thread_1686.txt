<s> hi guys... we have an up to date comp which was purchased in the last 6 months... and i'v got an older laptop coming from ebay... i would like to network the 2 so i can share files and share a adsl internet connection (connected to the comp).. i'v seen these little sticks called a wireless usb network i have 2 links to ones on ebay (sorry i wasnt sure where else to link to for examples) i'm guessing my laptop hasnt got a network card in it... but has a usb... will any of these items work? </s>

<s> u cannot connect pc and wireless with one wireless adapter . </s>
<s> u can when u have inbuilt wireless or one more wireless adapter. </s>
<s> If so, how is it connected to your computer and with what hardware/s? </s>
<s> so if i purchase 2 of those dogle things it will work? </s>
<s> its connect to my pc via adsl modem...into ethernet i think...might be usb... </s>
<s> i found this one too and was told it would work by the seller but i asked round half say yes half say no (asked other sellers of the same type of item) http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&sspagename=ADME%3AB%3ARTQ%3AAU%3A1&viewitem=&item=150021957469&rd=1 </s>
<s> As Bob pointed out, networking with a router would simplify thing alot. </s>
<s> I have just subscirbe to verizon dsl and here is what they sent me; a wireless dsl modem/router (it's actiontec model GT704-WG). </s>
<s> So far I haven't got it connected yet. </s>
<s> I am still learning, hehe. </s>
<s> If I were you, I problaly would stay away from the bluetooth thing. </s>
<s> Sounds like a different animal to me. </s>
