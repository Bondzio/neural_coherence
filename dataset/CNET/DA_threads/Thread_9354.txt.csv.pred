1.1.1	Hi , I use UT 300R2U Modem from BSNL for broadband .	St
1.1.2	I take lot of phone calls through Internet , primarily via Skype .	St
1.1.3	One problem I have is that whenever there is powercut I get disconnected from the calls even though I have inverter at home , because the half minute or so delay that it takes for the inverter to restore power is enough for disconnecting me from the internet and the call and I need to call back once the modem gets power back from inverter .	St
1.1.4	A friend advised me that instead of using the ethernet cable if I use the USB port of the UT 300R2U modem , the modem can draw power from the laptop for that brief half-minute of interruption and I would not get disconnected .	St
1.1.5	Unfortunately when I tried that it is NOT working and the UT 300R2U modem still gets disconnected during power cut despite remaining connected to the USB port of my laptop !	St
1.1.6	Is it because the power requirement of this external modem UT 300R2U is more than what USB ports of laptop can provide ?	Ques
1.1.7	Any advise anybody can provide me on this problem ?	Ques

1.2.2	I have yet to find any broadband modem that is under the 2.5 to possibly 5 Watt capability of 1 or 2 USB ports .	St
