i'll assume that you have retrieved any data you still wanted from these drives.
given that there was malware on those drives, you want to ensure that any retrieved files are clean - use a virus protected system to check the copies.
then, if you remove the partition(s) and repartition the drive all that's needed is a thorough full format.
except: you may still have a boot sector virus on the drive.
and if you do you probably have the same virus on all drives on all systems that you have connected your old drives to.
so you do want to treat those old drives as suspect until you have checked them with a virus scanner.
once they are reformatted the virus scanner will run much faster and the only possible place where it could still find a virus would be the boot sector area.
