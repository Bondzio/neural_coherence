<s> I'm working on an effects heavy project using giant images. </s>
<s> This workload is killing my machine even though it is a 8 core with 14GB of RAM. </s>
<s> My co-editor is working on a Dual Core with 10GB of RAM. </s>
<s> I would like to 'slave' these machines to maximise my processing speed for Final Cut Pro and After Effects. </s>
<s> However I have absolutely no idea how to do this or if this is the best option. </s>
<s> Could someone please explain to me firstly what I would need to do in a step by step to hook up the machines and secondly if this is worth it. </s>
<s> Or is there perhaps another techinique. </s>
<s> Thanks Andy </s>
<s> Is something along the lines of XGrid. </s>
<s> This is built into OS X and allows you to share the workload across a network. </s>
<s> You will find further details Here </s>
