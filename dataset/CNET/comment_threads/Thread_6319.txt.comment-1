I live in a 3 story townhouse and my pc is set up on the first floor.
My cable company provides my internet and phone services.
I am on bedrest and am restricted to the 3rd floor so I have purchased a laptop.
I want to be able to use it from the 3rd floor so I need to set up some type of network.
I called the cable company and was told all I need to do is get a splitter and wireless router and hook it up to my cable connection on the third floor.
I believe it entails more than that and wanted to check.
I thought the router needed to be connected to my cable modem but that wouldn't work for me since it is on the 1st floor.
any advice would be helpful.
