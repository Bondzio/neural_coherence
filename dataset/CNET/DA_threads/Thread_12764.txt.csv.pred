1.1.1	Hi -- I 'm having some real problems with my Soundblaster PCI128 - I had problems installing it initially , and it was all down to the PCI Legacy Device that it was trying to install .	St
1.1.2	Eventually , it just did n't install the device , and , since I do n't use it , it was n't missed .	St
1.1.3	I rejigged the guts of my PC yesterday , and moved the soundcard to a different PCI slot .	St
1.1.4	It redetected on Windows load , and it locks up -mouse , keyboard - everything - as soon as it detects the 'Soundblaster PCI128 Legact device ' - I 've removed all references in Device manager and rebooted - same problem .	St
1.1.5	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.2.1	Try booting up into safemode and go back to Device Mgr .	St
1.2.2	Go to the Sound category , click the plus mark if it 's not already opened up , right click the Legacy Device , and choose Properties .	St
1.2.3	Once there , look for the box that says Disable In All Hardware Profiles and put a check mark in it .	St
1.2.4	Click OK , and then reboot to see if the problem persists or if it fixes it .	St
1.2.5	TONI	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the advice , but I already removed the legacy device in Safe Mode , so it no longer exists .	St
1.3.2	I did however disable the soundblaster 's main driver in Safe Mode , then rebooted , and attempted to enable it .	St
1.3.3	It detected the legacy device again , and hung the system .	St
1.3.4	Any other ideas ?	Ques
1.3.5	Thanks again .	St
1.4.1	I 've seen that hangup when the motherboard drivers were not installed .	St
1.4.2	When you dive into such issues , the make/model of the motherboard is important .	St
