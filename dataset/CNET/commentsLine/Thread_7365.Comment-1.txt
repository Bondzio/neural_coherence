my thinkcentre s50 is displaying an error message &quot;1962 no operating system found&quot; i brought it on ebay and it did not have an rescue and recovery disk.
i've been trying to find an iso file but no luck.
i tried their r&r disk but i can't create the disk because the software is lenovo enabled and i can't run the software anywhere else.
any thoughts??????
thanks
