i think you misunderstand me.
my computer is not sluggish nor does it have a virus.
what i have is a hardware issue that i can't seem to pinpoint and i was wondering if there is a software out there that can assist with locating the hardware problem ( so that it can test the sound card, graphics card, memory, hd, cd rom, floppy, and anything else).
thanks.
