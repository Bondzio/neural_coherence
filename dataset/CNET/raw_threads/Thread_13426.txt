Since I had to change my motherboard I can't get anything to work when I plug it into the usb ports. Everytime I plug something in it it comes up with the &quot;This is new hardware lets search for drivers&quot; and even if it finds some drivers on the system it still doesn't work. Have tried going into devices and uninstalling usb ports but when it reboots it asks for drivers for the ports then doesn't work again. This is even with things like simple usb flash drives. I looked on the bios and everything seems to be enabled. I don't know about IRQ setting they could be wrong. Could someone help please? Thanks

Scroll down to the Universal Serial Bus controllers and click the plus sign. If the drivers are installed all the USB ports will be listed. If USB-2 is installed there will be an entry for Enhanced Host Controller.

If you had supplied the make/model of the machine or maybe the make/model of the motherboard I would have supplied a link to the drivers but your posts are ignoring the forum note. Bob

When I tried to install it it said that I had the latest SiS USB Driver and to rescan for hardware changes in device manager. Thanks for your help

Overclocking advances the PCI bus beyond 33Mhz. The resulting increased (odd) values can adversely effect the operation of the Universal Serial Bus. Return the FSB (Front Side Bus) to default values before you do anything else. &quot; Frome http://www.usbman.com/Guides/SiS%20USB%20Tips%20and%20Tricks.htm http://www.sis.com/support/index.htm has the latest drivers but at this point it's probably &quot;something else&quot; or you skipped a step on the OS install (motherboard driver, BIOS enable the USB or miswired ports.) &quot; Product Identification The SiS Online Chipset Identification System helps you to identify the chipset model of your SiS-based system. By using this tool, it will direct you to download the correct driver for your needs. &quot; After you identify your chipset, then you grab the latest MOTHERBOARD DRIVER PACKAGE (not the USB), install that then the USB. One day we hope Microsoft stops pushing these drivers as the responsibility of the owner. -&gt; Final thought. Why isn't this a warranty issue? Bob
