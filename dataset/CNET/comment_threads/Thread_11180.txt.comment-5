I gave the computer back to the owner with the warning to not let it install a video driver.
I'll wait & see what happens.
I do have a Ubuntu CD if I get it back.
Like most others, I'm much more conservative when working on other people's computers, but if it were mine, let it rip!
That's how I learn.
