verizon has already strung fiber on the poles on my street and dug up my yard to drill it under the roadway to the other corner; when the rest of the county is done, their sales staff will beat my door down to install fios... which they say will soon include tv... meanwhile, cox cable, the longtime tv provider here, has cox hsi internet and deals for some voip, and surely won't pass on the chance to one-up the comcast tivo deal... and most new houses around here are being pre-wired for coax cable, cat6 ethernet, and fiber to every room in addition to the standard phone wire... all of which will soon be irrelevant to 802.11(something or 'nother) wireless... and when that happens, nbc/abc/cbs will install new transmitters on their tv towers, and we'll all get motorized antennas strapped to the chimney that rotate by remote control... lol.
