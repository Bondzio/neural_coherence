<s> Just to let everyone know, I've yet to find one. </s>
<s> Unless you count the s/w bundle you may get with a new drive or system, don't expect to a freebie out there. </s>
<s> I looked high and low with negative results. </s>
<s> I wanted to head-off so-called complaints of PowerDVD players install for new blu-ray players just wasn't good enough or reliable(upgrades). </s>
<s> While my new player will have PowerDVD it seems others just didn't like it and made bad reviews for it, I hope mine is OK. </s>
<s> Please advise if you locate one. </s>
<s> Thanks -----Willy </s>
<s> There has been a chilling effect on a free software BR or BD player because of the DMCA and more. </s>
<s> If you want to play BD content, I suggest you use the PowerDVD or other software and PLEASE get it with your hardware to save the cost of the standalone software. </s>

<s> Robert, one reason I posted was to no show results of &quot;no freebie&quot; out there. </s>
<s> Further, since PowerDVD seems to be the typical player packaged with new drives, reviews have been heavily negative. </s>
<s> So far, my exposure to PC type drives is small only because many users just haven't gotten aboard with it yet. </s>
<s> Now, that the pricing seems to be lower than before, the questions are starting to pop-up for my techie response. </s>
<s> the good news is that other players(paid for) seem to do a better job than PowerDVD or at least seems that way. </s>
<s> Not to push any s/w or point to what is good, but since the typical freebies have done such a great job, I wondered why they aren't available. </s>
<s> Already, there's clambering for VLC to get it done, but &quot;no go&quot; for now. </s>
<s> I think that will change but not soon enough for most of us new BD owners. </s>
<s> -----Willy </s>
<s> Of the DMCA and the BR/BD software consortium is the primary reason why. </s>
<s> Since almost all BR/BD content is protected and the software to play it requires the decoder and there is no open source decoder and the DMCA chills the developers you may be waiting a very long time. </s>
<s> There's also no reason to stick to BR/BD. </s>

<s> is getting bum raps. </s>
<s> The hw bundled v7 plays BD fine and like later versions, only decodes stereo, not multichannel. </s>
<s> For latter you have to pay. </s>
<s> Also trial versions cannot be patched with released fixes so evaluators are left wanting. </s>
<s> v10 Mark 2 has played new discs for me so far without hiccup. </s>
<s> And don't forget to update reader firmware from mfr if you expect it to work for new discs. </s>
