<s> Transform and Lighting (T& L) - T &L is a type of video technology that takes all the 3D information that used to be handled by the computer processor gives it to the GPU. </s>
<s> This allows a more complex 3D environment by adding a higher polygon count and improving the lighting at the same time that it allows the computer processor to handle other tasks. </s>
<s> Some computer games may require that users have a T&L compatible chipset. </s>
<s> If you are unsure if your video card or motherboard video chipset is T&L compatible, or what generation of T&L your computer has, check the documentation for your video card. </s>
<s> Trichomatic - A method of mixing red, green, and blue to render the entire color spectrum. </s>
<s> This method of mixing colors is commonly used in inkjet printers and computer monitors to create multiple variations of colors. </s>
<s> Trinitron - The Trinitron technology was invented by Sony in 1968 and later released in a computer monitor in 1982. </s>
<s> Trinitron is a display method that uses an Aperture Grill to help create a true, life-like image. </s>
<s> True Color - The use of at least 24-bits to represent each pixel in a graphic. </s>
<s> 16.7 million colors can be shown when 24-bit color is enabled. </s>
<s> U UXGA - Short for Ultra XGA, UXGA is a video resolution that supports a maximum resolution of 1600 horizontal pixels by 1200 vertical pixels. </s>
<s> V VDU - Short for Visual Display Unit, VDU is a term used to describe a visual display device for a computer. </s>
<s> For example, a flat panel display, monitor and a projector are all examples of a VDU. </s>
<s> VDU is most commonly used to describe a standard CRT monitor. </s>
<s> Vertical retrace - Also known as a vertical blanking interval or the vertical sync signal, vertical retrace describes the action performed within the computer that turns the monitor beam off when moving it from the lower-right corner of a monitor to the upper-left of the monitor. </s>
<s> This action takes place each time the beam has completed tracing the entire screen to create an image. </s>
<s> VESA - Short for Video Electronics Standard Association, VESA is a group of monitor and video card manufactures that set various display standards. </s>
<s> VGA - Short for Video Graphics Array, VGA is a popular display standard developed by IBM. </s>
<s> VGA provides 640 x 480 resolution color display screens with a refresh rate of 60Hz and 16 colors displayed at a time. </s>
<s> If the resolution is lowered to 320 x 200, 256 colors can be displayed. </s>
<s> VGA capability is built into plug -in video cards, VGA chips, and monitors that can work with the VGA cards. </s>
<s> Today VGA has been supplanted by SVGA. </s>
<s> Video - Electronic signal of moving graphics, pictures and/or text used to combine a fluent source of images used for entertainment, education or other uses. </s>
<s> Video accelerator - Video card with integrated processor and memory to increase the overall capabilities of video graphics. </s>
<s> Today most video accelerators are used for computer gaming. </s>
<s> Video adapter - Also known as a graphics card, video card, video board, or a video controller. </s>
<s> A video adapter is an internal circuit board that allows a display device such as a monitor to display images from the computer. </s>
<s> Video buffer - A storage location in a system or video cards memory that holds information before it is sent to the display device. </s>
<s> Video digitizer - Software that takes an analog video still frame and coverts it to a digital still image. </s>
<s> This is generally accomplished with the aid of computer hardware. </s>
<s> Video display page - A video screen image stored in the video buffer. </s>
<s> Video conferencing - Computer software, hardware, or other device capable of transmitting a video signal to another computer software program or hardware device allowing other individuals to see a picture of the participants in a conference. </s>
<s> Video memory - Memory on the video card, in some cases located on the motherboard, which is accessible by the video and computer processor. </s>
<s> With more video memory, the video card and computer is capable of handling more complex graphics at a faster rate. </s>
<s> Video card memory may be between 8 and 512MB of memory. </s>
<s> Videotex - Technology developed in the U.S. that allowed users to read text news on a television by using a receiver and a dedicated line. </s>
<s> Because of the interface, cost, and other factors the videotex system never became popular and is no longer in service or used. </s>
<s> Vertical sync line - Also known as vertical retrace or vertical blanking, vertical sync line describes the action performed within the computer that turns the monitor beam off when moving it from the lower-right corner of a monitor to the upper-left of the monitor. </s>
<s> This action takes place each time the beam has completed tracing the entire screen to create an image. </s>
<s> VLF - Short for Very Low Frequency, VLF describes the electrical radiation emitted by computer monitors, televisions, and other cathode ray tubes (CRTs). </s>
<s> W Windows-based acceleration - Super Video Graphics Array adapter specially created to run Microsoft Windows programs faster. </s>
<s> This should not be confused with standard SVGA cards. </s>
<s> Wireframe - The simplest type of data representation for 3-D models. </s>
<s> Wireframe modeling is a natural outgrowth of 2-D CAD in that such models only contain information on edges and vertices. </s>
<s> With a wireframe modeler, there is no implicit information on the boundary between inside and outside the model volume. </s>
<s> Wireframe can also refer to a rendering technique in which only the edges and vertices are represented in the image. </s>
<s> WSXGA - Short for Wide SXGA, WSXGA is a resolution that supports 1600 by 900 pixels or 1600 x 1024 pixels. </s>
<s> WUXGA - Short for Wide Ultra Extended Graphics Array, WUXGA has a resolution of 1920 horizontal pixels by 1200 vertical pixels. </s>
<s> WXGA - Short for Wide XGA, WXGA is a video resolution that supports a maximum resolution of 1366 horizontal pixels by 768 vertical pixels. </s>
<s> X XGA - Short for Extended Graphics Array, XGA was introduced in 1990 and is IBMs upgrade to the VGA video standard. </s>
<s> XGA supports a maximum resolution of 1024 horizontal &gt; pixels by 768 vertical pixels and 256 colors. </s>
