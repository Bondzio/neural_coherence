<s> I recently had a problem with my Kodak printer. </s>
<s> To make a long story short, I called them and got it fixed after 2 hours on the phone. </s>
<s> I noticed afterwards that I had no sound. </s>
<s> I did a system restore and got my sound back but I had to redo the Kodak software. </s>
<s> Now I noticed that I have no DVD drive, CD-Rom Drive and no Memorex external drive. </s>
<s> When I go into device manager they all have a yellow circle with a black exclamation point in it. </s>
<s> When I try to update the driver it says it cannot find the drive. </s>
<s> When I try to rollback it says they is no backup for this drive. </s>
<s> I am at my wits end. </s>
<s> Can someone please, please help me. </s>
<s> Do I need to call in a computer repair man or is this something I can fix myself with some help. </s>
<s> I have a Dell Dimension Desktop 3000 running Windows XP. </s>
<s> The drivers I am missings are as follows: Memorex DVD t Ram 530L v1 USB Device HL-DT-ST DVD Rom GDR 8163B Sony CD-Rom CRX217E Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I always get good help from my CNET friends. </s>
<s> Thank you, Maryann </s>
