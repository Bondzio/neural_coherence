What is the difference, I do not have a space limitation but I am curious if a microtower limits upgrade capabilties. Thanks,dz

I was fixing a CPU fan for a HP one and took me a bloody our to remove the accursed power supply because it was so cramped. And forget about adding memory. You'd have to unscrew the motherboard to get to those. Not worth it. ~Ibrahim~
