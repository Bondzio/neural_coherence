<s> Hello, I have a emachine with windows vista, I have keeped it clean and running since i bought it in 2003. </s>
<s> My problem is one day my wife told me that she couldnt get the screen to show up, I look at it, and find that my moniter is fine, it shows that its connected but theres no video input. </s>
<s> I took a crack at it last night, cleaned the dust out of it( not the 1st time) and I hoped that might have caused the problem, but cleaning it did nothing. </s>
<s> I have a aftermarket video card, Geforce. </s>
<s> I figured that If i cleared the CMOS it would reset it to the original onboard graphics, but after I atemped that, no cigar. </s>
<s> I originaly thought that the A.M. card pooped out but Im not sure anymore. </s>
<s> I do not have another video card to test. </s>
<s> If theres an idea you may have to, please share. </s>
<s> I am currently not at my computer so I dont have the specs off the top of my head but as requested I will get them. </s>
<s> Worse Case scenario my motherboard is messed up. </s>
<s> Does it beep like it usually did before? </s>
<s> What is this about a video card? </s>
<s> If you added an aftermarket card and didn't put in a bigger power supply that is my prime suspect. </s>
<s> Use a Volt meter to test it. </s>
<s> Here's a link how. </s>
