It's definitely off the bottom rung of those Intel GMA solutions and the other Nvidia 6150 but you will read less than glowing reports about speed on this DX10 capable chip.
However it's going to run games at &quot;reasonable&quot; settings and the drivers are not done yet so stay tuned for updates.
I'd take that one.
Sorry, to compare to the other cards find benchmarks and compare.
