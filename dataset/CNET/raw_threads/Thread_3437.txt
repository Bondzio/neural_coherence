14406	0	242984	2459277	NR	jconner	4/13/07 7:47 PM	1.17649362E12	does anyone make a 3 pin to 2 pin adapter	My new antec case has a 3 pin power LED female connector (middle not wired). The motherboard I'm using (ASUS) has a 2 pin connector for the power LED. Its on the end so I might be able to move a pin to the middle and still use the case connector, or I could solder in a two pin; but I was wondering if anyone actually makes a jumper eg. 3 pin male to 2 pin female or two single females? Does it have a name if someone does make it? Thanks

I wasn't able to confirm the configuration of the cable form the Antec 160B (I couldn't find the manual online). Frontx.com sells different sizes of terminals, header connectors, and tools if you decide you need them: http://www.frontx.com/order_c.html How to: http://www.frontx.com/head_con.html

Hadn't done it before so I was a little nervous about damaging the pin insert, but it worked out OK. If the pins had not been on the end, they do make single male on one end and female on the other so I could have gone that route. Anyway thank you for responding. Back to building. Its a great case by the way.
