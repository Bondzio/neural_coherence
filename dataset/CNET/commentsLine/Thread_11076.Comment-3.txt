what operating system you are using.
did the two partitons ever work correctly and then start having the problem??
is the full 160 gb of the drive recognized in the bios.
wonder if you've run into the 137 gb limit and a bios/operatingf system that does not properly support drives larger than that.
search the forums for the 137 gb limit.
robert proffitt has posted info on the problem a number of times.
