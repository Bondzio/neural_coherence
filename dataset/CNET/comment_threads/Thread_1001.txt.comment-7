and you know differently then say so.
i've got no problem saying i'm pretty much clueless when to comes to the inner workings of a computer.
my logic was based on what i would think of as a fairly balenced build then comparing that to other options.
in this case the 3 ghz may or may not be capable of processing all the information coming from a 7800gt running at full speed plus run all the other apps in the background without some lag time; albeit very little.
my thinking is that a good balence would be a 3.2 or higher for the 7800gt if you're going to run at top ability with taht card.
until something requires all that though the amount of info coming from the card through the cpu would probably be lesser than when operating at full capability.
i guess in short i'll just put it this way.
if i was going to get a 7800gt, i'd scrap my AMD 3200+ and go to at least a 3800+ if not the FX-55 if financially possible
