<s> Hi there I bought two 1Tb Western Digital &quot;My Book&quot; drives. </s>
<s> I have plugged them into my MacMini, but no matter what I do only one of them will mount at a time. </s>
<s> I'm wanting to mount both so that I can create a RAID with them. </s>
<s> Is there any reason why I can't mount both of them? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance Luke </s>
<s> power supplies? </s>
<s> If no, then that may be the problem. </s>
<s> There should be no reason why those two drives do not mount at the same time. </s>
<s> Are you going through a hub or directly into the back of your MacMini? </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> They both have power supplies and they both work if independently plugged in. </s>
<s> It's just when plugged in together that they don't. </s>
<s> Very strange. </s>
<s> Anyone who has any ideas - I'd appreciate the help Ade </s>
<s> I'll stop there. </s>
<s> Next time go get models that have firewire as I bet that would work. </s>
<s> Also, try inserting some USB 2.0 Hub into the mix. </s>
<s> I've seen that correct the odd USB id issue. </s>
<s> Sorry I won't duplicate that discussion again. </s>
<s> Just try it and move to firewire. </s>
<s> In case you wonder why I don't want to discuss it again, the discussion will not cure it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I've tried a couple of different brands of Firewire external drives, hooked in daisy-chain mode (one plugged into the other) and they both show up. </s>
<s> I've never tried USB drives so I can't comment on that configuration. </s>
<s> I currently have two Firewire LaCie drives, and when daisy-chained, they both show up. </s>
