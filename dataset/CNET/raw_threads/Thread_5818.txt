Some windows media files won't open and I get the following message: Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file. I also have similar problems with some power point and word documents. The USB memory stick is unbranded and is fomated as FAT32. My operating system is Windows Vista Ultimate
