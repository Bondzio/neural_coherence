some webpages, including free webmail sites, have objects in them (javascript, activex, etc.)
that have the potential to install/behave like malware.
there are software routines in your computer that can be blocking these (antispyware, firewalls, etc.).
routers often contain firewalls and filters, too.
r. proffit was wise in recommending a firmware upgrade.
at least you can eliminate the router's firmware in your troubleshooting.
