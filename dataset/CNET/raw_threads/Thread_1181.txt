Whenever I connect it to my computer, it makes my computer really slow and i cant do anything untill i turn it off. I tried to run a disk check when it occasionally poped up on My Computer, but it failed to complete it halfway through, now it doesnt even register with the computer when i turned it on. I'm using Windows XP SP2, and if what i need to do requires changing a setting during startup, include a detailed description, because im lost when it comes to that.
