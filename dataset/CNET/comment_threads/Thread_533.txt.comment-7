As ideas come and go, it's like that super duper device you had back on CP/M and you fast forward to now and no one knows what to do with it or how it worked.
Since 3 radios would be more cost as well as the heat, it probably fell out of favor as higher rate 802.11n came along that was more a standard than a 3 radio solution.
Maybe it's time to move to today's solutions or when high speed is needed, get wired.
I know I get wired when I want to move big files (the laptops here have 1000BT ports.)
