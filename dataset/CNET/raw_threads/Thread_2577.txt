13590	3	198683	2134867	2134755	kirkpat2	8/15/06 4:37 PM	1.15565982E12	ill give it a try...	im pretty sure its a hardware issue, but ill give it a try...i have a knoppix cd somewhere but i gotta find it, meanwhile keep posting suggestions. personally i think there might be something up with the motherboard, since its not the power supply and the videocard is obviously working because occasionally the asus screen comes up, but possibly a faulty compacitor?

13590	5	198683	2134940	2134923	kirkpat2	8/15/06 5:09 PM	1.15566174E12	maybe...but	this weird thing is, its happened to me atleast 4 times before. ill leave it off for more than 2 weeks or so, usually when i go on vacation during christmas and summer, ill come back and ill get this black screen startup stuff. usually i just mess around and do the stuff i said and she'd fix herself and start workin again. only when i leave her off for a long period of time does it happen, and the same thing situation every time, the only difference is that this time nothings working...and i cant see how leaving a computer off could totally fry an OS

13590	8	198683	2138556	2134943	kirkpat2	8/16/06 1:18 PM	1.15573428E12	nope...	still isnt workin, i bought a new asus motherboard and hooked everything up, comps still doin the same thing. black screen on startup with an occasional asus screen as soon as the monitor comes on but thats about it. im starting to think it might be my 550 dollar videocard....
13590	9	198683	2138603	2138556	R. Proffitt	8/16/06 1:41 PM	1.15573566E12	That's a new clue. Tell about that power supply and if...	The old video card works. Here's why. Most systems will be fitted with just big enough supplies. Then people add drives, power hungry cards and things like this happen. The power supply should be north of 400 Watts but I can't tell since the list of what's in the PC is rather short. Bob

When this happens to me	I have this piece of cardboard which I put just the basic parts on such as motherboard, PSU, video card, 1 stick RAM, CPU/HSF and not much else to see if it beeps an behaves. If not I downsize and try other parts. Bob PS. Why cardboard? Sometimes it's a case mounting or short issue.
13590	12	198683	2139015	2138648	kirkpat2	8/16/06 5:05 PM	1.1557479E12	made some progress...kind of	alright so here it goes i moved my videocard into my friends comp and to my surprise it worked fine. i put it back into my comp and finally took an old monitor and hooked it up to my comp, and i finally got it to work, apparently somehow it was my damn monitor the entire time..... but then i get to the whole &quot;windows did not shut down properly&quot; screen so i choose &quot;startwindows normally,&quot; the screen goes black and the comp restarts and the whole thing starts over again... so i decided id rather just reformat the entire thing then waste anymore time trying to fix it, i went into the bios and changed the primary boot device to my cd rom so i could put in the windows disk when i restarted. i checked around the bios a little more and changed the &quot;primary video device&quot; from pci to agp and im pretty sure i also changed the &quot;aperture size&quot; from 128 to 256. i dont know why i did this but i did....so i restarted and now i dont have a picture at all, monitor light doesnt even turn green and i checked inside the case and my video card fans arent even on now, so i guess im back where i started, with a real problem this time
