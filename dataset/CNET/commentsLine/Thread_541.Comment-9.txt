hi barney_r!
i couldn't find a solution.. there was only a lacie nas that had a specific partition for direct usb access and other (partition) for the nas storage itself.
in the end i decided to put my nas (iomega ix2-200) somewhere else in the house, connect it to the lan and access it via ethernet using a very affordable wd live tv (media player, no storage, hdmi connection to tv), which plays every video/audio format i need, adds subtitle on the go, reads dts sound (my led doesn't) and has no problem with 1080p video on a 10/100 lan or a 802.11n wlan.
very nice ps3-style base interface too (and it's even customizable).
it's an additional cost i know.. i simply gave up on what i was searching for but i'm very happy with the player i bought.
today i wouldn't buy a samsung xxb7000.. i'd go with the &quot;xxb6000 + wd tv live&quot; combo.. (if samsung solves the never-ending-dlna-issues i'll put the wdplayer in another tv/room and use the led to browse and play my files over the lan.)
thanks for everything.
