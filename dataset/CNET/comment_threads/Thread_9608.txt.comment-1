I've been researching this for awhile now.
I'm building a system for photo editing and gaming, but I'm not a hardcore gamer.
Thus I didn't feel the need to build at the cutting edge.
Here is my current configuration: MSI K8N Neo4/SLI AMD Athlon 64 3200+ Venice CORSAIR ValueSelect 2x1GB Leadtek 6800GT Seagate Barracuda 7200.8 250GB BenQ DW1640 BK Fortron Blue Storm 500W Power Supply Lian-Li PC-7B Plus Black Does anyone know of any compatability issues?
Improvements?
Other considerations?
Thanks, Jeff
