because they hold more data per disc... 4.7gbs or 8.4gbs for dual layer dvds.
just keep in mind the issue for hdds is susceptability to media damage, electronic component failure, mechanical failure, malware damage or even operator error.
whatever you have on an hdd that you don't want to lose should be backed up to something else ... the less susceptible the media is to damage or overwriting, the safer you are.
