<s> I'm a musician and recently purchased a Roland Juno-G Workstation. </s>
<s> As indicated on the following diagram: http://www.keyboardmag.com/pop-up.aspx?content_id=29104&section_code=1 This piece of equipment has a slot for a flash adaptor. </s>
<s> I am unsure of what exactly I need to purchase, or what I SHOULD purchase. </s>
<s> I was wondering if someone could point me to a website that sells exactly what I need and that ships to the US. </s>
<s> Check the slot and see if it's about a 1/2&quot; X 1/8&quot; rectangle. </s>
<s> Look and see if there are 4 gold electrical connectors inside. </s>
<s> If so, it's a flash drive adapter that would allow you to upload/download to and from it. </s>
<s> What you'd be transferring I can't say...your own creations or someone else's probably, pre-sets, etc. </s>
<s> This should be somewhere in the instruction manual. </s>
<s> Old is right as they're using a laptop type PMCIA type slot. </s>
<s> In that vein you can then find that adapter and then use the more common &quot;flash memory&quot; you like and as flash memory varies maybe multiple kinds. </s>
<s> It would have better if Roland settled on a USB port which far more generic. </s>
<s> Maybe, it was intended for a &quot;ethernet&quot; connection via the PMCIA slot to dump data(music), etc. </s>
<s> to a PC/laptop. </s>
<s> I would think that the manual offers suggestions or details on that port use. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> There isn't anything useful that I can find in the manual. </s>
<s> The only say &quot;PC card slot&quot; that can use CompactFlash or SmartMedia using a &quot;Commerically available adaptor.&quot; pg 178 is the only section that has information I can see about it. </s>
<s> You're all welcome to take a look. </s>
<s> http://www.roland.com/products/en/_support/om.cfm?iCncd=1069&ln=EN&SearchBy=RcId&dst=P&iRcId=0000008921&dsp=1 I haven't bought the flash card yet, so it doesn't matter which adaptor I get. </s>
<s> I'd like to use the dominate format, but at this point I just want to get the stupid adaptor. </s>
<s> Looking at the specs page which repeats the same info but appears to offers that the PMCMIA slot will accept the adapter. </s>
<s> That means, it will accept the same cards found for laptops(older PCMIA), further you get one that accepts flash data cards on the adpater. </s>
<s> That way you dump your music files/chords, etc. </s>
<s> to be saved. </s>
<s> In all likelihood don't get a flash card bigger than 2gb(guessing), but if you get an adapter any similar smaller Mb/Gb data capacity will work to test it. </s>
<s> So look at laptop PCMIA adapters that provide flash ports on the adapter. </s>
<s> Just visit any decent online laptop website to get an idea of adapters out there. </s>
<s> try here: http://www.newegg.com tada -----Willy http://www.roland.com/products/en/JUNO-G/specs.html </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812150014 </s>
<s> Yes, that's the type of adapter you need. </s>
<s> Its noteworthy the comments, buyers made of that adapter. </s>
<s> It probably a cheap unit, so take that into account. </s>
<s> Remember, you still need the flash card for data storage. </s>
<s> enjoy -----Willy </s>
