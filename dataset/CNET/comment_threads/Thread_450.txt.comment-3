the intel cpus will run just fine with their boxed cpu fans and heatsinks.
so no, you wouldnt have to water cool, unless you wanted to overclock, but even then, people use the original hs/fan combo.
ddr2 doesnt improve performance that much btw.
i would go amd dual core or just a plain 939 cpu.
of course you could wait for ddr3 in amds next socket.
