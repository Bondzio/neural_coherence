1.1.1	hello , I have a Dell Inspiron 6000 , its about 5 years old .	St
1.1.2	It has an integrated Wireless Adapter Intel Pro/Wireless 2915ABG .	St
1.1.3	I have noticed that its been acting up sometimes , finds signlas , drops them , the status bar going up and down all the time .	St
1.1.4	Im not sure if this is a software issue r hardware .	St
1.1.5	what I want to know is if an NCI or Cardbus wireless adaptor is better than the integrated one , range and stabitily wise .	St
1.1.6	thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Stability = SAME when both are working proper .	St
1.2.2	Distance = SAME OLD STORY of & quot ; it depends on the situation. & quot ; But the reason I fit those cards is that while sometimes replacing the internal card fixes it , it usually fails again so I never bother anymore .	St
1.2.3	This is not a design bug .	St
1.2.4	Laptops have a life span and it 's from 3 to 5 years so again , not a bug or omission in the design .	St
1.2.5	You have the right idea to fix this common issue .	St
1.2.6	It 's how I deal with it .	St
