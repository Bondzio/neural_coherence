<s> I have two CD/DVD burners on my pavilion xv998. </s>
<s> Every time I try to add data/music to a CD that has something on it, I get an message that says to &quot;insert a blank disk&quot;. </s>
<s> This happens no matter how much space is left on the CD. </s>
<s> I just can not write anything to a CD/DVD that has anything on it. </s>
<s> This applies to RW's as well as R's. </s>
<s> With the RW's it will allow me to erase whatever is on the disk and then it will record but if I try to put anything else on the disk it will tell me that there isn't room even though it has 600GBs left. </s>
<s> And occurs no matter what software I am using to write with. </s>
<s> I have several CD/DVD burning applications and it happens on all of them. </s>
<s> Has anyone else experienced this? </s>
<s> Can anyone explain what to do about it? </s>
<s> Can it be a hardware or software problem? </s>
<s> http://www.cdrfaq.org/ tells you more than you need to know. </s>
<s> Read about multi-session and be aware that CD AUDIO disks are not going to allow this if on CD-R and only if you erase the disk if on CD-R/W. </s>
<s> In short, nothing seems wrong. </s>

<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
<s> But I can add to a partially completed CD on my other computer if there is sufficient space. </s>
<s> It asks me if I wish to erase on an RW and when I reply &quot;no&quot; it allows adding data or music. </s>
<s> The computer that won't allow adding to a partially filled disk has lots of DVD/CD burning software on it so there may be a conflict somewhere. </s>
<s> That's a mult-session CD. </s>
<s> Just so you know, CD-Audio has NO such method. </s>
<s> Be clear on your terminology and use the CDR FAQ to get up to speed on what is what. </s>
<s> I don't see any issue yet. </s>
<s> Things seem to be working just fine. </s>
