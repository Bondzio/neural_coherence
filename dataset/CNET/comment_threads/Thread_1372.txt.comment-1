Ordered a Desk top from Dell (dimension E310) and would like to upgrade the video card (to play battlefield 2).
Does anyone know how I would find out what type of card I need or how to find out what type this PC needs?
AGP or PCI?
Short of opening the back and looking inside.
The game requires as a minimum a NVIDIA GeForce FX 5700 or ATI Radeon 8500 or greater.
My PC more than meets all the minimum requirements for the game, but not the video card
