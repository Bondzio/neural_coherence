i would be cautious about buying systems with integrated grpahics.
i recently bought an hp p6310f and was unable to get the system bios to correctly recognize an ati radeon 5670 pci express video card that i installed.
i eventually gave up on installing the card and reverted to the system integrated grahics which look fine but have no hdmi output for my tv.
my advice would be to buy a system that has a low-end pci express graphics card installed that you can upgrade when you have the money.
there seem to be plenty of reasonable machines with radeon 4350 cards in them.
