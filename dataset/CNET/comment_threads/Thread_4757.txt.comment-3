Thank you for your reply...
When I first had the second line installed I had both 2 wires connected to a netgear dual band router, guessing that is where I made my mistake...
Both 2 wires are completely separate now, but still having the dropped connection problem.
Just had the second line installed about 2 months ago and all wiring was fine then, but guess things could have changed in that time period.
