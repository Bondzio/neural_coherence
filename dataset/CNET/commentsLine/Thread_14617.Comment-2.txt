four pieces plus a beep.
but first, imagine if everyone used your subject title.
take a moment to craft something more like... changed the power supply and it still doesn't (something.)
in fact, i can't tell if it turns on or not.
my definition of &quot;on&quot; here is fans spinning.
not that windows works (or linux.)
so given so little words, you could try just the psu, motherboard, speaker and the cpu+heatsinkfan and see if it will power up and beep.
if not, you are looking at the four possible bad parts.
