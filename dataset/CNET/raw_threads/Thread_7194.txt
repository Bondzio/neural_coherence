8547	0	161373	1789748	NR	the_real_martian	3/5/06 3:20 PM	1.141572E12	Conner Technology?	I recently bought a used computer at a yard sale. It came with a hard drive by &quot;Conner Technology&quot;. The drive has problems, so I was going to look at their website to see the conditions of any warranties. The drive says that the website is http://www.connertech.com , but as you can see, it's just an advertisement site. Has another company acquired Conner, or did they just go out of business?

But I could be wrong. Unless you need data off the drive, let's be honest here and write that such drives are fine door stops. Bob

Your drive should work just fine for it's new purpose. Read http://www.resellerratings.com/forum/t59085.html This is a very old drive, no warranty and is a great device to look at. Bob

I'm seriously considering scrapping this computer and trying to salvage anything useful (not much!), but I actually didn't buy it, it was given to me for free, and I know why. I can, however, use the hard drive, which will be the most useful part of the whole computer!
8547	6	161373	1804837	1803892	ramarc	3/13/06 6:55 AM	1.1422329E12	that's a great hobby pc	as for the conner drive, here's my suggestions. 1) disassemble it... HDs are really cool devices their innards make really interesting paperweights/conversation pieces. 2) get Sunday's circulars and find a nice new HD for your main PC. $60 should get you 160GB or more. 3) put the old drive from your main PC in your hobby PC and start tinkering with stuff you'd never do with your main PC. install linux. make a backup device. make a firewall. geek out!
