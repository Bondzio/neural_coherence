You can't use a multimeter to do more than check that pin 1 gets to pin 1 and so on. Past that is a rather expensive piece of gear to measure signal crosstalk. Here the cable is 2 bucks so the test is 2 bucks. Bob

Swap cable(light bulb) if it works, then the cable is at fault. If not, then you can expand the search for the cause. Int real world its far cheaper to use a new/tested cable than testing the cable itself. As to finding the cause, at least you know the cable isn't at fault once checked. tada -----Willy
