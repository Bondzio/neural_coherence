oh, not nearly that many prints.
i would guess between maybe 500-1000 prints, 1000 being generous.
this is a business i am just starting so i need to get the clients first i forgot about the leasing option....but would it be worth it for the amount of prints i would be making?
i will check out the lower end printer link that you sent.
thanks
