<s> You could try it with the existing but at some point suspect you'll have to replace. </s>
<s> If the budget permits...I'd replace now while you're doing the GPU. </s>
<s> Re replacement options...I wouldn't consider either of those you've listed. </s>
<s> I would however recommend something with a better warranty, longer MTBF, better buyer ratings, greater efficiency (uses less electricity), better tech site reviews like the one below. </s>

<s> right now I just have enough for the 5770 at 154.99 and 30 to 45 for the PSU. </s>
<s> SO if there is another one at that price range let me know </s>
<s> coolermaster extreme 500w http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817171031 it's a bit loud, but it'll get the job done and last a couple of years. </s>
<s> the hd5770 doesn't need a lot of power... much less than an hd4850 in fact. </s>
<s> a 450w power supply is fine for it. </s>
<s> Might just try the one I have if not I'll get the one you mentioned. </s>
<s> THank You </s>
<s> especially this one...it says http://www.newegg.com/ProductProductReview.aspx?Item=N82E16817171031 &quot;Pros: None, if your looking for a 360w then buy this one, nice for the price, but doesn't run my 9800 gtx+ Cons: The power supply is really only a 360w not a 500w, check the label on side of the power supply..... </s>
<s> Manufacturer Response:Dear Valued Customer, We apologize for the inconvenience. </s>
<s> The power supply is in total 500W. </s>
<s> Power supplies have multiple rails because computers need multiple rails or types of power to run. </s>
<s> For the 12V rail, it dedicates 360W, for the 3.3V and 5V it dedicates 165W, for the -12v 6W and for the +5VSB 12.5W when all added together equals 500w. </s>
<s> The spec sheet is available via the link below. </s>
<s> Your video card requires two six pin pci express connectors which the power supply provides. </s>
<s> Should the power supply be faulty, you can rma the power supply via the link below. </s>

<s> I've looked a lot and can't really find one that is worth getting. </s>
<s> Antec TruePower New TP-550 550W is suit to you. </s>

<s> i've got a couple of these in service and they hold up well. </s>
<s> and coolermaster gets good reviews on sites that do reviews using proper test equipment. </s>
<s> the power supply label clearly shows that it has 2 18A 12V rails totalling 360W. </s>
<s> the rest of the 500w is devoted to 5V/3.3V... that's normal for any power supply. </s>
<s> a typical pc with an hd 5770 under full load drew less than 300W from the outlet. </s>
<s> http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=3658&p=13 the coolermaster will be fine. </s>
<s> just because it's a chevy and not a bmw doesn't mean it won't give 100K miles of transportation. </s>
<s> well for you. </s>
<s> Nonetheless I wouldn't buy the CM RS-500 for a PC unless it was used strictly as a bench spare. </s>
<s> Accordingly I couldn't recommend one for use in a gaming system for someone asking recommendation here. </s>
<s> Looking at the GPU specs for the Sapphire HD5770, it clearly states 400W as a min PSU .. another HD5770 shows 500W as min. </s>
<s> The combined wattage of that PSU is only 430W despite the fact it advertises as a 500W. </s>
<s> Even the Corsair 450W PSU beats it in 12V wattage, efficiency warranty,12V AMPS (33 vs 30), review ratings and buyer ratings. </s>
<s> http://www.sapphiretech.com/presentation/product/?psn=000101&pid=296 http://www.sapphiretech.com/presentation/product/?psn=000101&pid=305 But buyer reviews/comments for the CM RS500 reflect DOAs, short use deaths ... there isn't much subjective about those events. </s>
<s> For what it's worth, I'm not recommending BMWs but products I've read reviews about, I've read buyer ratings on and ultimately products by mfgs I personally own . </s>
