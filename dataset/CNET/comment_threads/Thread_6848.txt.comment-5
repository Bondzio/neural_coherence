For a last chance shot, I put back a PCI NIC that is finicky and has troubles connecting, anyways, I made a cross-over cable and used that to connect to the network and it appears to be working, but most home routers are auto sensing, including the ones I was working with, but not working.
Don't know what is different about this, the only thing I can think of is that the current motherboard has a built in cable tester when plugged into the onboard NIC that said the 1-2 pair was okay, 3-4 & 5-6 pairs were open at 0.0-0.4 meters and pair 7-8 failed at 10-11 meters and when using crossover, data travels the same pairs each direction proof of this would be one of the times I got lucky and it connected once, I could get connected to network, but wouldn't connect to a webpage.
Anyways, before you think the cable is bad, I have tried known good cables with the same problem.
