several photographer friends use external drives to store their photography.
once a drive is filled, it is placed upon a shelf for future retrieval.
unused except for that moment of need.
they are convinced that this procedure is safer than using cd / dvd media as backup.
i am not educated in this field, however, it would seem reasonable that an item designed to spin, would actually fail in a much shorter run time after sitting idle for lengths of time.
this therefore would actually mean that your external drive security would basically extend to the current drive being used.
perhaps this is too far off topic.
in real life i know 2 people whose total of 3 external drives have failed by simply sitting on the shelf, and definitely not due to hours run.
any thoughts?
