Hello, I recently purchased a Toshiba Satellite A215-S5818 Laptop (specs can be found at http://www.toshibadirect.com/td/b2c/rdet.jsp?poid=405001&seg=HHO ) and it comes with Atheros Wireless LAN 802.11a/g/n. I want to get a wireless router for my home, but which router should I get, 802.11a, 802.11g, or 802.11n? Thanks a lot!
