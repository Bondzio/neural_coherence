my sister has a seagate drive in her computer and they're fine.
they are supposed to be very good.
the only thing with the external seagate drives is that some of them have special electronics which means when they fail you can't just take them out of the box and put them into a new box.
best thing to do is get an external 3.5&quot; sata hdd enclosure and build your own with an internal sata hdd rather than getting these manufactured external drives, that way if the enclosure fails you know how you built it and you just need to pull a few screws out pull the hard drive out and put it in a new enclosure (of course this doesn't fully protect from full hard disk failure, but it at least gives you a little bit more protection from just the enclosure failing).
i had one person call me up recently asking if i could rescue his data, it was one a seagate external drive and he'd damaged the usb port, unfortunately as it was a sealed unit there was no way into it to get the hard drive out (and it was highly likely that inside it was a non-standard hard drive), so nothing he could do but send it back to seagate and see if they could help him.
if it had been a diy unit it would have been so much more easier, just unscrew screws, disconnect hard drive, discard broken case and put in a new case.
