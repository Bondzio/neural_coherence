why bob?
i'm not sure i understand the reasons.
isn't fat32 a bit quicker?
i have ntfs on my laptop and use fat32 on my desktop.
both amd processors about the same clock speed and memory and my desktop is a lot faster.
i keep em both clean and run the least resources possible.
i use ntfs on my storage drives because they are large.
they are on my desktop and they seem slower also.
