i am building a computer for the first time and i have a few questions.
will an antec 350w case with ps be enough to power an amd 64 3000+, dvdrw drive, geforce fx 5200?
which would be easier to set up ide or sata hd.
if i had just the dvdrw on its own channel would i set it to slave or master and if i decided to go with an ide hd would i put the two on the same channel or on different ones and if they were on the same which would be slave and master?
