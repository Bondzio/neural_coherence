1.1.1	I have an HP All-in-one laserjet 3030 which is around one year old.	St
1.1.2	Lately when using the Automatic Document Feeder (ADF), the pages are coming out with one single thin vertical black line.	St
1.1.3	If I am using the flatbed, the copy comes up perfectly normal.	St
1.1.4	Also printed pages are coming up normal.	St
1.1.5	I have asked Hewlett Packard for an answer but they did not bother to answer.	St
1.1.6	Any suggestion would be appreciated.	St
1.1.7	Jon	St
1.2.1	Sadly, support, parts, repair costs can exceed what a new AIO unit will cost.	St
1.2.2	But it's a well known failure.	St
1.2.3	What will drive you nuts is that with all these low costs, spare parts are usually non-existent.	St
