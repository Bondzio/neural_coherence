<s> I am looking for a good, but simple, external hard drive with an installed back up system. </s>
<s> I have seen some that back up new files each time the computer is turned on. </s>
<s> I have also seen those that must be run daily. </s>
<s> I'd like advice as to the easiest to use, please. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Let's say you have your PC (with files) and the external that has a copy of the files. </s>
<s> This fails old school IT ideals about backup since backup means you have more than one copy. </s>
<s> Wait! </s>
<s> You say you have a copy? </s>
<s> No, when your PC fails you only have one copy left so there is no backup copy. </s>
<s> This simply means you need no less than 3 copies of the files you intend to safeguard. </s>
<s> Back to your external hard disk. </s>
<s> For me, the program SYNCBACK found with google does all I need and I just moved to a new machine with its help. </s>
<s> And I have no less than 2 external hard disks, a few USB memory keys and some DVDRW media with files for good measure. </s>
<s> I find most owners don't become serious about backup till they suffer loss. </s>
<s> In other words, backup might not be a teachable area but one that is learned. </s>
<s> All I can do is share what I do and how it works for me. </s>
