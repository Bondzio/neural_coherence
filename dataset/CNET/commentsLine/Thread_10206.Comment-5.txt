try going to start&gt;connect to&gt;... or control panel and then network connections and view your wireless adapter, right click on it and go to properties.
on the tab at the top, click the ine that says &quot;wireless networks&quot; and check the box that says &quot;use windows...&quot; if there is a native router on it click on it to select and this should at least help you connect.
if that doesnt work then using a thumb drive you can copy the network settings from the wireless laptop that works and then using it on your laptop.
hope this helps
