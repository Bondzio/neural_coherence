if you can find a video card that supports pivoting, i'd go with the dual.
i use a 15.4&quot; laptop + 17&quot; dell ultrashap and it's nice to rotate the 17&quot; to portrait mode--since most code is taller than it is wide.
i'm &quot;borrowing&quot; a 20&quot; dell ultrashap, and running that in portrait mode is so cool.
