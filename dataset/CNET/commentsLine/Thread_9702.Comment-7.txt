well, to my experience true image is excellent for making a backup image of os.
i always use it, and i think it'll completely satisfy your requirements.
you could create a small hidden partition (called secure zone - because of its inaccessibility to any other software) for strongly compressed drive image and further incremental backups.
after fully installing and optimizing windows, drivers create a full-system image.
you'll be able to access the image upon boot, whenever you want to resort to a full system restore.
but i think the best way to make sure in it to read review about most popular backup software.
