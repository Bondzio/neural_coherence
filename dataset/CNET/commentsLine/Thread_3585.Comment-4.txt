i didn't mention ubuntu.
i was thinking programs like getdataback, zero assumption recovery, recuva, pandora.
it's unlikely a standard os (like linux) will find that data.
warranty doesn't include recovery.
if they can't repair it you'll get another empty one.
if they repair it there's a good chance they delete your data in the process.
so don't count on that.
so if all you lost is your backup, you still have the originals.
i'd start with buying another hard disk to copy them to have another backup.
and from that external drive to another pc, of course, so you have 2 copies besides the original.
then keep the external on a safe place outside your office and you'll have an acceptable backup for professional environment.
but webbased storage might even be better and easier.
