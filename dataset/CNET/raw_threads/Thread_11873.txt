It was from an 700 mhz celeron Comp USA Home Series Computer --- Everything works fine except, I keep getting these dialog boxes stating that, this program has preformed an illegal operation and will be shut down -- If the problem persist contact the program vendo. Do you think this error is in association with the power supply or could it be the computer has another conflict-- It almost impossible to find a compatable supply because its a mini atx supply and the Comp Usa replacement is 109 dollars. Any technical input would be helpful --- Thanks
