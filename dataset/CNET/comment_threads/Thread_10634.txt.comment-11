We have tried everything to get our Samsung Katalyst phones to work in our house which is equipped with Verizon Fios wi-fi.
After - LITERALLY - HOURS on the land-line phone with BOTH Verizon and T-Mobile, our wi-fi has NEVER WORKED with these phones.
And that's the only reason we bought them in the first place.
GR-R-R-R-R-RRRRRRRR!!!!
Can anyone help?
