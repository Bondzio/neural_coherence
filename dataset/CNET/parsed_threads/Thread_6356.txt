<s> Hey All, Please help me on this issue. </s>
<s> My Computer Spec's are: AMD xp 1900 Maxtor 40gig ATI 9000 128mb ASUS A7N8X-X MOBO 1 year ago my computer was rebooting everytime I was using a Software like Norton, or games like Call of Duty or anything that seemed to be using more memory. </s>
<s> I've did a Memcheck ... never seen any error on my Ram. </s>
<s> We've brought the Computer to a Computer store, they came back and told us it would be 200$ to fix or 300$ and it was the MOBO,Ram was fine, graphic card was fine and also the processor so I've bought the ASUS A7N8X-X MOBO .. installed it and apparently when transfering a file from two partition, my computer rebooted again. </s>
<s> I checked the Event Viewer and it tells me there was an error on harddisk0 .. so now I think its the hard drive. </s>
<s> I've downloaded a Maxtor Diagnostic and as I was rebooting the computer the screen turned off ... and I can't get the screen back up, I've removed the port for my graphic card and reinserted it and its still black but shows connected, my monitor is fine, I can use another computer box and boot up. </s>
<s> so here is my issue. </s>
<s> 1. my computer reboots whenever, or gives blue screen of death 2. </s>
<s> I've reinstalled a new motherboard 3. </s>
<s> I've did diagnosed memcheck for my ram - suceeded 4. </s>
<s> I tried booting up floppy for harddrive diagnostic and now I can't get my screen on, it just stays black. </s>
<s> is there any good diagnostic for memory,Processor,MOBO, fan, whatever you can find so I can fix this ******* issue (sorry for language) PLEASE help me try to figure this out, its money and time wasting. </s>

<s> It sounds to me like the most likely causes are in order of probability 1) A defective or low quality/underpowered power supply (An Athlon XP needs a high quality power supply) 2) Overheating 3) A defective stick of ram The easiest thing to do is try a different stick of ram and see if the problem ends. </s>
<s> You didn't mention the power supply. </s>
<s> Especially if it is not a high quality one, I would replace it with a high quality one of at least 300 watts. </s>
<s> (My choice would be Antec) What cpu temperatures is your system showing? </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply 250 Watts Power Supply is whats in the box. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> No spyware, I run the scan each reboots 2.the cover is not on cause I just replaced the MOBO so I haven't had time to put the cover. </s>
<s> There is no heat, I don't smell anything, both fan are running. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> I flashed my Bios 30 minutes before this happened however I was able to boot up to windows after,that's where I moved a file to another partition and the computer rebooted I got back to windows and checked the event viewer to find out the harddisk0 crashed now I can't do anything, I am stuck with a flashing orange light Monitor. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> I've installed all Drivers for that MOBO the day before. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> I've installed service pack 2 on it also. </s>
<s> and to let you guys know I tried another Graphic Card in the board and my Monitor still doesn't detect that one. </s>
<s> but it works with my Dell computer. </s>
<s> thanks, computer is not heating up however the powersupply is not a Manufactor I've seen before, its 255 watts i've changed the stick of ram .. and it didn't help I wish I knew my CPU temp but I can't get it to bios to check or windows my computer can be 24hrs off, and it still won't turn on, so it couldn't be heat related if its cold. </s>
<s> If its the ******* motherboard again, kill me </s>
<s> It certainly leaning towards a bad power supply. </s>
<s> The beware factor is, if the p/s is actually bad and you install new devices or componets it may bring them down, not just not work but break them. </s>
<s> Its the cheapest solution for now to replace the p/s unit and then worry about the mtrbd as the next possible cause. </s>
<s> The repair shop should have mentioned that, but a flaky p/s is problematic to resolve. </s>
<s> A 350W unit is a good start but 400W+ units or better and you count on quality, as cheap is cheap. </s>
<s> On top of all this, you should at least try a &quot;minium system&quot; setup, the basic stuff, just do it. </s>
<s> Don't take anything for granted, all you need is FD, video, 1-ram stick or bank and mouse, kybd. </s>
<s> NO HDs, or CDs drives active and reflect that at bios if possible. </s>
<s> If you can't even get a screen then, you have a serious problem, try swapping parts out to replace in the minium system setup. </s>
<s> If you have any warranty with repair shop return it for such as a new mtrbd. </s>
<s> should last longer. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> You've found your issue. </s>
<s> Why such a small supply? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thanks, at the time the box it was build, bad credits goes to FutureShop.com. </s>
<s> so even if theres light on the machine when you turn it on and the graphic card doesn't work .. it's still the Powersupply ? </s>

<s> im kinda jumping into a convo that i odnt know about cuase i havent read any of the replies, but i had a computer kinda like that and it would reboot autotmatcally when would try to load a level in call of duty. </s>
<s> I never found out what the problem was, becase i bought a new computer. </s>
<s> But, i have had the problem where you reboot, and you can see the bios menu and stuff but but when the login to windows starts, your monitor turns off. </s>
<s> If this is your problem, boot in safe mode. </s>
<s> Then reinstall your graphics card's Driver. </s>
<s> Then reboot not in safe mode (normal mode?) </s>
<s> then you will get back into windows. </s>
<s> lol and if your problem has already been solved by these peoples replies then sorry for butting in, and if this has nothing to do with your problem, sorry </s>
<s> He doesn't need a 400 watt power supply, just a high quality 300 watt one, unless he wants to add a few more peripherals or a higher end video card, then a 350 watt one would be a good idea. </s>
<s> I suggest going with the brand Antec, although there are some other brands that are high quality. </s>
<s> An off brand 255 watt power supply is quite likely to be a problem in an Athlon XP system. </s>
<s> Hey man, its cool. </s>
<s> I've done all of those you meantion .. however you don't need to be sorry at least your trying to help ... but right now I am looking into thinking its the power supply. </s>
<s> I changed the Power Supply to 430watt bought two Kingston 256MB ram (might of been bad ram before) changed the Mobo to ASUS A7N8X-X reformatted, dad started playing and now after 2-3 weeks its giving him blue screen and freezing his pc just like it did before I started this thread. </s>
<s> only thing we didn't do is change the CPU but this is starting to get cost effective, we bought a new mobo, powersupply and new ram tell me what you think </s>
<s> You need to pressure the supplier to stand up to the system parts. </s>
<s> Of course you'll remove the case cover, have a current BIOS, BIOS defaults and not think that a new board would have the latest BIOS. </s>
<s> No SPYWARE either. </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> While a high quality p/s units are available, they're just as good to get a hi-wattage unit. </s>
<s> The prices being that they are, most users would rather go that route until they realize it made more sense to actually get not only a quality unit but a hi-wattage one. </s>
<s> I recommend 350W too, but there are so many 400W+ and the typical user will be happy. </s>
<s> 500W units are readily available and come with dual fans, etc. </s>
<s> to help keep the p/s unit stable, to include 400W units in the model line. </s>
<s> Excluding any quality issues, most 400W units do alright. </s>
<s> -----Willy </s>
<s> my advise is to get away fro AMD.... Intel is much more stable sounds like to me that your processor is not supporting the other hardware </s>
<s> This might be worth looking into. </s>
<s> Had same problems with a similar setup. </s>
<s> Does that have shared video? </s>
<s> Like on-board? </s>
<s> If so, try adding a different video card. </s>
<s> That's what I found for the solution in my problem. </s>
<s> I would be copying files, etc, and it with blue screen and restart. </s>
<s> The minute I added a different video card, problems went away. </s>
<s> Was with an ASUS MOBO and Kinsgton RAM as well. </s>
<s> Let me know. </s>
