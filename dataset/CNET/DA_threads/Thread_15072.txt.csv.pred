1.1.1	I want to install software onto a portable external storage device so that I can run the software ( database or server for example ) from any laptop by just plugging it in through the USB port ?	Ques
1.1.2	The storage device would be like a netbook ( with its own OS like XP ) but without a display or keyboard .	St
1.1.3	Just wondering if anything like this exits .	St
1.2.1	Those that do n't need to install files in Windows or add themselves to the registry might do so .	St
1.2.2	It will depend on the program itself and how it 's written .	St
1.2.3	I recently installed a piece of DVD burning software that would do such but you are n't going to be able to run something from one OS that 's been installed in another in the manner you desire .	St
1.3.1	PORTABLE APPLICATIONS	St
1.4.1	download Prayaya V3 .	St
1.5.1	I ca n't recommend this program enough .	St
1.5.2	It is the ultimate portable PC software .	St
1.5.3	You can save anything you want on the USB and it will never leave a trace anywhere else .	St
1.5.4	I know its not free , but its completely worth it !	St
1.5.5	I tried this program out after learning about MojoPac and I have to say that it is way better .	St
1.5.6	I think that it is faster and you can do a lot more with it , especially because it is not limited to just Windows XP .	St
1.5.7	It can run on XP/Vista/7 flawlessly .	St
1.5.8	Because I travel a lot , I am constantly on the go and because pretty much every place that I 've been uses Windows , I am always concerned about security , especially because I usually cant restart public computers and boot my own Linux distro .	St
1.5.9	With Prayaya , this eliminates most of the problems .	St
1.5.10	Not only is it secure , its super easy.Check it out at http : //en.prayaya.com/index.html and let me know what you think .	St
