i have a bit of a unique problem that i am not sure if it is coming entirely from my graphics card or from various other sources as well.
whenever i tell my computer to shut down it always will try and restart (i have to use the &quot;on&quot; button for the off purpose) and in some games i notice decreased performance from a decent graphics card.
my system is as follows: amd athlon xp 2600+ creative sb audigy 2 zs plat.
nvidia geforce fx 5200 w/256 mb of ram 80 gb maxtor ultraata 133 hard-disk dfi kt400a socket a motherboard 1.50 gb ddr pc2700 ram and the games i find trouble with are indiana jones: emporers tomb and halo the reason i say decreased performance is because my older system with geforce4 mx 440, 512 mb pc133 sdram and an ancient intel pentium 4 at 2 ghz runs halo about 95% as good as an xbox while my geforce fx can't keep up, yet it has more ram and is newer.
any suggestions?
