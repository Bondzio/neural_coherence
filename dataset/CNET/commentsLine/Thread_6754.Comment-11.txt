i have broadcast ssid enabled.
is there another ssid that i need to change and if so where would i find it?
i do have switch and can see other networks when i go to refresh network connection list.
i can not connect to the website that you gave me to try from laptop.
just came home from work for lunch and then back to work.
feel free to email me anymore suggestions if you have any so i can try them when i get back.
i'm really hope i can get my laptop working this router so i don't have to return it for a new laptop which will have vista.
i have heard nothing but negatives about vista.
thanks so much for the help, renee
