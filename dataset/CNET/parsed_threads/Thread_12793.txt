<s> Very interesting article. </s>
<s> I have just obtained and returned a D-LINK 624 G router because the new firmware would not allow me to select a channel. </s>
<s> The article implies that, when operating in the 108 mode, you lose the ability to select channels. </s>
<s> What was frustrating was that no one in tech support at D-LINK had a clue as to why I was locked in on channel 6. </s>
<s> It appears that this simply is the way the implementation is suppose to work. </s>
<s> I also found posts about the Netgear 108 product where people are complaining about being locked into only one channel. </s>
<s> Is this truly the way the implementation is suppose to work? </s>
<s> If so, would you not think that the vendor's own tech support would know this? </s>

<s> In the outsourced support, they are usually spoonfed what someone thinks they need. </s>
<s> I find today's outsourced support to not have a ready path back to the developers or someone who can look into the issue. </s>
<s> As you rightly discerned, that mode spills over the channels so there is no way they should allow you to flip channels in that proprietary mode. </s>

<s> Out of curiosity, I went back to the D-LINK site and brought up the 108G documentation. </s>
<s> Under the FAQ, an answer to &quot;enabling the SUPER G mode&quot; also stated that only channel 6 can be used. </s>
<s> I obviously missed this when I originally checked out the site. </s>
<s> Amazing that tech support did not know this. </s>
<s> As a result I returned a functioning router and D-LINK lost a sale. </s>
<s> FWIW, I was trying this router because of a perceived issue with a BELKIN wireless G router with which I was intermittently losing the Internet connection from my Motorola SB4200 cable modem ( I have posted about this on this group a few weeks ago). </s>
<s> After returning the D-LINK, I went out and purchased (with the right to return) an RCA cable modem since the SB4200 was also a suspect (Comcast would not allow me to have a new modem since it &quot;worked O.K.&quot; directly connected). </s>
<s> Anyway, it now appears that the SB4200 was the problem. </s>
<s> It's been almost 4.5 days and I've not had a disconnect (4-6 times daily with the SB4200). </s>
<s> Furthermore, my upload speeds have increased by about 20%. </s>
<s> I'm tempted to try the D-LINK again except for their poor tech support and the very good support I received from BELKIN (sent me out a brand new, field tested router - also very easy to get to their tech support people). </s>
<s> Harvey </s>
<s> The issue was their router that on some number of browses would direct the user to an advertisement. </s>
<s> The recoil was such that Belkin was ... beat up on the web. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> My problem, of course, was not related to the &quot;spying&quot; issue. </s>
<s> My issue started before the advertisement flap. </s>
<s> However, BELKIN did appear to respond (apologize) quickly. </s>
<s> In fact, their is a new firmware update on their site (put there a few days ago) that removes the advertising code. </s>
