<s> I'm not in the repair or resale business, rather the school of WHY. </s>
<s> This was part of the Compaq Presario 4550 given to me last year. </s>
<s> It also contained CD-Rom, Floppy, and Zip drives. </s>
<s> I only used the ethernet nic to backup data from my XP and then disconnected the power connection. </s>
<s> (SYNCBACK 5 STARS!) </s>
<s> I have a guess why the 4550 was changed this way but not sure. </s>
<s> Anyhow, this year I was given an HP Pavilion 6746C. </s>
<s> I had to replace the PSU, Floppy, and Hdd. </s>
<s> So, I traded the AT PSU(4550) for an ATX, and the old Floppy(4550) for another at my computer club. </s>
<s> Then, I put the above hardware into the 6746c. </s>
<s> (Celeron 733MHz) The more I read about ATA the confusier I get. </s>
<s> I'm guessing this setup in the 6746C maybe should just be connected to the motherboard and remove the Promise IDE controller. </s>
<s> I still use the 6746C for backup to the XP system with an ethernet connection and SYNCBACK. </s>
<s> The Promise add in cards had several possible uses. </s>
<s> They could increase the number of IDE devices one could put in older PCs whose motherboards only allowed for 4. </s>
<s> As well, some older motherboards couldn't take advantage of the size or speed of newer drives. </s>
<s> By now, this is all past. </s>
<s> If your motherboard specs say they support ATA-133 which your drive can handle, you can yank the Promise card. </s>
<s> There isn't much use for these anymore. </s>
<s> drives larger than 137GBs ...even if the MB BIOS won't. </s>

<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> I now understand how to ask a better question. </s>
<s> The Pavilion 6746C Trigem Cognac board supports PIO Mode 3 and 4. </s>
<s> So, does the 40GB HDD run at the 133 speed, or revert to the lower speed of the mother board ? </s>
<s> The history is interesting to me since I started clicking in the PC world in 2004 with a Dell 2400. </s>
<s> Promise no longer sells the 133TX2. </s>
<s> The 6746C sold for $800 real money in Y2K. </s>
