14963	0	49255	586011	NR	CharlesF	12/4/04 5:19 AM	1.10213754E12	HP Photosmart Printers	I am looking to upgrade my printer, specifically to improve photo printing. Can someone explain the different between HP's Photosmart and Photoret IV printing. Thanks

With photoret 4 you get improved print quality with your pictures lasting up to 65 years. If you find one with photoret pro, it has the option to use 8 ink printing (ret4 only uses a 6 ink). The extra two inks dramatically increase quality of colour if your doing black and white printing. They are greyscale printing. With pro photos last up to 73 years. The drops of ink are smaller with photoret 4 than previous versions, so you get better quality and colour. I work for HP, so any other questions you have fell free to ask, and I can answer them

Could you describe the key differences i would notice and whether the $50 price difference is worth it for the 8450? Any thoughts would be great! Thanks!
