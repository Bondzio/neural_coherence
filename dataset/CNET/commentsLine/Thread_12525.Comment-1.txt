hello, i am running a computer with windows 7 service pack 1 64 bit os and i'm trying to install a wireless canon mx420 printer.
my computer is connected to my router through an ethernet cord and i have managed to set up my printer's wifi just fine.
it appears connected on the printer's screen and i have disabled all firewalls on my computer yet it still won't detect it... please any help and insight would be appreciated.
