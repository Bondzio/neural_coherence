1.1.1	I have a second pc that I rarely use anymore.	St
1.1.2	but recently while running it really loud noises started in the tower and then the screen froze up.	St
1.1.3	I ended up shutting it down by pulling the plug, was the only way.	St
1.1.4	When I plugged it back up I got a message saying no c drive detected.........and the noise came back....ok my question is what happened and should I try to fix it?	St
1.1.5	if so what could it be?	St
1.1.6	and / or should I just throw it out?	St
1.2.1	The best part of noise, you follow your ear and find what's making the noise.	St
1.2.2	Thus, you take it from there.	St
1.2.3	If you haven't open your case, this is a good time to do so.	St
1.2.4	Repeated power-UPs may seal the fate of whatever is making the noise or the whole system.	St
1.2.5	Come back with what you've found.	St
1.2.6	tada -----Willy	St
1.3.1	the cover is off and right now it is running normal so Im waiting on the noise again ........stand by	St
1.4.1	I was running it scanning for disk errors and it made the noise but only a brief moment then stopped......also after that there was ticking like a clock then a thud?...now it is just locked up and will not do anything!	St
1.5.1	You should definitely check to see that any existing fans are running okay, but it sounds to me at first glance you have a demo'ed hard drive.	Sug
1.5.2	Ticking like a clock and then a thud is a pretty good indication the read arm is defective, and most likely broken all together.	St
1.5.3	If it's still accessing c: drive, it may not be too late to get your stuff off of there.	St
1.5.4	This doesn't mean the rest of the unit is garbage, just the hard drive needs replacing.	St
1.5.5	If it's particularly old, it may not be worth it to you to replace the hard drive if in fact that's the problem.	St
1.5.6	There's a remote possibility it's a fan and an overheat is wht's causing the lock-up but I really doubt it.	St
