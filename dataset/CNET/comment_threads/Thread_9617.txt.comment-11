Shop around and look for rebates and you'll save more.
You could drop down to a Athlon 64 3500+ and get the AMD price down to $1000.
If you never plan on OC'ing, you could drop the Arctic coolers and save that bit.
The x1800xt is still a high-end card, but you could save about $100 by downgrading to a geforce 7600gt.
However, I always recommend setting a budget and spending every last penny of it.
