<s> My cd-burner is currently showing the message D:/ not accessible - Incorrect Function whenever i put in a cd-rw and attempt to open the drive. </s>
<s> After I reinstalled the OS (XP), it worked fine. </s>
<s> However, I was so stupid that i uninstalled the Roxio software that came along with the OS. </s>
<s> That's when it showed the message. </s>
<s> When I bought the computer, it came along with a Roxio EasyCd Creator 5. </s>
<s> This was optional since you could already burn CD's. </s>
<s> I have tried installing/uninstalling that several times but it was no use. </s>
<s> I have also installed/ reinstalled the hardware too but it was no use either. </s>
<s> The drive can read burned CD-R's and can install programs. </s>
<s> Is there any way to solve this? </s>
<s> Thanks a lot! </s>
<s> I type DELETE UPPERFILTERS on google.com to find a few registry keys that may need removal. </s>
<s> In closing, was that Roxio noted as crashing XP? </s>

<s> In My Computer, right-click on the CD drive icon. </s>
<s> Click properties. </s>
<s> Select 'Recording' tab. </s>
<s> Ensure that 'Enable CD recording on this drive' is checked. </s>
<s> Geoff (windows is a bug) </s>
<s> Don't believe Roxio 5 is compatible with XP Check their website to confirm....I'm sure there's an FAQ on this. </s>
<s> Good Luck </s>
<s> thx guys for all your help, i was able to fix it by removing the upperfilters and lowerfilters </s>

<s> I am a novice and appreciate any help out there. </s>
<s> I use windows xp and have Roxio Easy CD Creator 5 basic. </s>
<s> It was working fine but I recently did some clean up and now I get a msg that says &quot;no spt CD recorder available&quot;. </s>
<s> I looked in control panel and it still shows Roxio Easy CD Creator loaded. </s>
<s> Thanks, </s>
<s> Uninstall and reinstall your Roxio software. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the info.... PC came with it loaded so I do not have software. </s>
<s> I may just go an buy it and reload.... </s>
<s> Thanks again, </s>
<s> In the meantime the UPPER/LOWERFILTERS and the uninstall of such is a common cure. </s>
<s> CDBURNERXP can do most of what people need to do with CDRW disks and it's free. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the info... </s>
<s> I will try that. </s>
<s> You folks are really helpful! </s>
