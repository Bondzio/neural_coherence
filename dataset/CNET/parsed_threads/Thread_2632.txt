<s> Hello all I have a Snow Leopard iMac with Virtualbox installed. </s>
<s> On my Virtualbox i am running windows 7. </s>
<s> My job has two different networks. </s>
<s> I need my Mac on Network 1 and I need to have my windows 7 in Virtualbox on network 2. </s>
<s> If i install a USB Ethernet port on the iMac and plug network 2 into it, how can i make it work just for Virtualbox? </s>
<s> I then want to make the built in Ethernet port work on network one and be just for the iMac? </s>
<s> Can it be done or am i just crazy? </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> But I've seen such requests before so given how this works, I'm going with not going to work out for you as you planned. </s>
<s> Why not connect both networks and then tell Windows to use that LAN? </s>

<s> The problem is the two subnets. </s>
<s> One should not be connected to the other.How do i make the mac ignore one of them? </s>
<s> The route table, netmask and more details but I only see the tip of the iceberg of information here. </s>
<s> While I did write router code back in the early 1990s it appears you are trying something for reasons I can only guess at. </s>
<s> At the office I have something like this but I use 3 laptops to do the work. </s>

<s> I work at a school. </s>
<s> I need to be connected to the instructional network sot fix computers, monitor student usage and all around support. </s>
<s> I also need to be on the administration network for the same reasons. </s>
<s> I currently have two computers to do this. </s>
<s> I would like to have one computer and put my other one out for student use. </s>
<s> I want my Mac on the instructional and my virtual windows on the administration. </s>
<s> One cannot be connected to the other. </s>
<s> We have networks of hardware controls so we emulate this on our test rigs. </s>
<s> Given how perilous setting up a single laptop would be and that it would be an emulation of the real thing we don't do what you propose. </s>
<s> But if I was to do this I would be looking at route tables, masks and such. </s>
<s> And there's the rub. </s>
<s> Most folk can't alter a route table. </s>
<s> I know it took me years to learn this. </s>
<s> I mean I could issue the command but until I was on that router software dev team I didn't understand it because I didn't have to. </s>
<s> Fast forward to your setup. </s>
<s> It may take time for you to pound out what your Apple's route table looks like for this one. </s>
