hi, i am building my own custom rig, and at this point i am trying to pick out parts.
right now i am looking at trying to find a cpu.
i want to use this rig for mainly gaming (battlefield bad company 2, battlefield 3), however i also want to use it for some photo editing and video editing as well.
so my question is what do i want to look for in the cpu?
what speed do i want?
how many cores?
things like that
