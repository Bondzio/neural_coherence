1.1.1	Somewhere I think I heard it is just a software update ?	Ques
1.1.2	Thank you , Billy	St
1.2.1	If there is a sofware update , you 'll find it noted at http : //www.usbman.com but the only reason I think the urban legend lives on is that we all wish it was a pure software update .	St
1.2.2	If you have a desktop , USB 2.0 cards start at under 10 bucks at newegg.com and compgeeks.com Best of luck with that !	St

1.3.4	While I do n't imagine you 're in it for the recognition , I think you deserve a & quot ; thanks & quot ; for services rendered .	St

1.5.1	Could anyone tell me what is involved in the upgrade .	Ques
1.5.2	USB1 TO USB2 The reason for upgrade is to allow me to transfer my old camcorder films to CD or DVD via & quot ; dazzle digital video creator & quot ; software which is still to be purchased .	St
1.5.3	THANK YOU IAN	St
1.6.1	You need to open your computer 's case to find out if you have an empty PCI slot .	St
1.6.2	Your USB 2.0 card will come in the form of a PCI card that you insert into an unused PCI slot in your computer 's motherboard .	St
1.6.3	After you insert the card , start up your computer .	St
1.6.4	You need to install the software driver that came with the card .	St
1.6.5	If the card came with no driver , Windows will find your card and may try to install a software driver for you .	St
1.6.6	If you need a driver , go to the card manufacturer 's website and download a driver to install .	St
1.6.7	The best thing to do is follow the instructions that come with your PCI USB 2.0 card .	St
1.7.1	Even if you do n't have an empty PCI slot , you can get a USB 2.0 COMBO card .	St
1.7.2	I think your computer has 3 PCI slots .	St
1.7.3	If they are all filled and one of them has , say , a PCI Network Interface Card in it , you can replace your PCI Network Interface Card with a combo card that has USB 2.0 ports and a network cable port .	St
1.7.4	Also , if you like to plug devices into the front of your computer instead of the back , get a card with an internal USB 2.0 port on it .	St
1.7.5	This will allow you to run a USB 2.0 connection to the front of your computer with ease .	St
1.7.6	I see you use a camcorder .	St
1.7.7	If you purchase a new camcorder , it will likely have use a Firewire ( IEEE 1394 ) output to make a direct connection to your computer .	St
1.7.8	So you might want to consider a ''PCI USB 2.0 and IEEE 1394 combo card '' with internal USB and Firewire ports .	St
1.7.9	As an example , the following card has three external USB 2.0 and one internal .	St
1.7.10	It also has two external IEEE 1394 and one internal : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16815106004	Ques
