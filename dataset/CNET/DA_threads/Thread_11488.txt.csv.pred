1.1.1	I am running an ASUS P4P800S-X Motherboard with a P4 3.0GHz CPU , 1GB of DDR Ram consisting of two 512 chips , and an ASUS Radeon 9550SE VGA card .	St
1.1.2	Recently I started having problems on boot-up where during the boot sequence the computer would freeze when it reached the NVRAM check .	St
1.1.3	The screen will say : DDR Frequency 400 Mhz Checking NVRAM.. And then it stops booting up .	St
1.1.4	If I turn off the power and reboot it then gets past that part on the second boot sequence and shows the following message instead : Overclocking Failed !	St
1.1.5	Please enter Setup to re-configure your system .	St
1.1.6	Then I press F1 to enter the Bios Setup , exit the BIOS without changing anything , and the computer boots up fine thereafter .	St
1.1.7	This problem now happens every time I boot my PC from having been in a powered off state .	St
1.1.8	At first I thought maybe the Ram chips were loose so I took them out and swapped the RAM slots just in case , but that didnt help to get rid of the problem .	St
1.1.9	Now I am thinking it may be a BIOS setting , but I am not sure what I would need to reset in the BIOS to fix the problem .	St
1.1.10	Any ideas would be kindly appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	did you accidentally set the jumpers for the CPU to settings that would overclock it ?	Ques
1.2.2	or did you try overclocking accidentally ( chaning a setting thinking it was something else ? )	Ques
1.2.3	another idea would be to contact Asus or just download the newest BIOS from Asus for your board	Sug
1.3.1	Thank you Ozos .	St
1.3.2	I have not changed any jumper or any other settings on the BIOS as far as I know .	St
1.3.3	& lt ; P & gt ; The only recent change to the PC was the addition of one of those optical mouses with all kinds of lights inside .	St
1.3.4	Maybe the extra power demand is causing a problem ?	Ques
1.3.5	& lt ; P & gt ; Flashing the BIOS is a good sugesstion though .	St
1.3.6	I will start there by checking to see if there is an update available from ASUS .	St
