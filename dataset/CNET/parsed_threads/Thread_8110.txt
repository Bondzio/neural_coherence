<s> Hi, just purchased an Hp 1030nr mini laptop and the CPU fan stays on constantly. </s>
<s> I have downloaded all updates from Hp/SUPPORT even the Bios, also all Windows updates have been installed. </s>
<s> I am just browsing websites and Ebay with no intense typing or programs running. </s>
<s> This issue drains my battery down very quickly,any suggestions will be appreciated. </s>
<s> In Bios, there does not seem to a funcion to alter CPU usage. </s>
<s> Ask for a fix or your money back. </s>
<s> to reduce CPU power when max CPU performance not required or to run the fan 100% of the time versus only when the CPU reaches a minimum temp. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
