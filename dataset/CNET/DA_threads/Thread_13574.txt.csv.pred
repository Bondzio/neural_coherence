1.1.1	Firstly , I 'm not a network engineer just a volunteer but I 've done the majority of the hardware installation at this school .	St
1.1.2	The current and growing need is for school parents , guests , presenters , etc .	St
1.1.3	to have access to the wireless network but without access to the LAN .	St
1.1.4	The network not a domain but simple peer-to-peer with device access controlled via firewalls and/or user/passwords .	St
1.1.5	The best I can find on the web is the use of some VLAN capability and think we might already have most of , if not all , the needed hardware .	St
1.1.6	Here 's what we have : Eight 3Com model # CRWE7760/75 APs connected to a 3Com model # 3CDSG10PWR managed switch .	St
1.1.7	I have access to all these devices .	St
1.1.8	This POE switch connects to one of 5 ( it has 24 ) active ports on a Cisco layer 3 switch .	St
1.1.9	That router is managed remotely and I 've no way to get to it .	St
1.1.10	The APs can handle 4 SSIDs and have the ability to individually assign VLAN ports to each .	St
1.1.11	The POE switch has the ability to configure VLANs for all ports .	St
1.1.12	All that is desired is enable select APs in certain parts of the school to allow guest access to the internet only .	St
1.1.13	If possible we 'd like to do this without purchasing new hardware at this time .	St
1.1.14	I can tinker with it but , for now , I 'd like to know if this can be done without involving the Cisco router .	St
1.1.15	If the router is definitely ... and I suspect it might be ... a party to the plan , we can contact the person who handles that end .	St
1.1.16	Thanks in advance	St
1.2.1	Since 3Com is no more and HP rarely answered the question just forget it .	St
1.2.2	If folk want the internet they 'll bring their smart phone or personal wifi hot spot .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	and probably a better idea to wait until the current hardware ( and lack of trained IT staff ) is no longer serving well .	St
1.3.2	Of course , $ $ $ $ is always the barrier .	St
1.4.1	I ca n't share the full details but the school would be blasted if they were able to get pron over the guest network .	St
1.4.2	Not a fun way to get de-funded .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	All schools in the diocesan system route through a school which is home to a tightly managed firewall .	St
1.5.2	Teachers complain it 's too tight as you ca n't even access youtube within the building .	St
1.5.3	I 'm guessing that a proxy server is part of the control .	St
1.5.4	IT people at the server location also manage the router that 's in the local school and they do n't hand out admin passwords .	St
1.5.5	As for allowing guest access , I 'd be more concerned about losing bandwidth during times of peak need by students .	St
1.5.6	Leaching from the system after hours is n't a problem as , because the APs are POE , we can just flip a toggle to the switch dedicated to the wireless side .	St
1.5.7	No one can sit in the parking lot and surf once the tech coordinator locks up and goes home .	St
1.5.8	Eventually , as needs grow and a more complex system is needed , they 'll need a way to find money to hire or contract real IT services but I 'm sure some jaws would drop at such a sales presentation .	St
