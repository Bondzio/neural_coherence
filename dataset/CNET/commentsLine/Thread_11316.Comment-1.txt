i live in a large two story house with an upstairs office at one end of the house and a downstairs office at the opposite end.
the cable enters the house on the second floor and i have used a di d-link connected to the cable modem to transmit a signal to the downstairs office for a second computer.
when i started frequent dropped signals downstairs i installed a netgear in the wall plugs near the cable modem connecting to the downstairs.
that seemed to help but i later added a much longer aerial extender to the d-link wireless router.
i have decided to get an up to date wireless router to see if i can stop the dropped connections.
i need advice on which one to buy for consistency of connection over a large area of the house.
