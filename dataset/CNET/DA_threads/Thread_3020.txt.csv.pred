1.1.1	I have a wired home network between 2 desktops using NetGear router.	St
1.1.2	Replaced the client desktop with new.	St
1.1.3	Now I continue to get this &quot;unplugged&quot; message and have done absolutely everything I can think of to make this work.	St
1.1.4	I have no internet on new computer while the host computer is fine.	St
1.1.5	Yes, I have checked the connections and everything is hooked up properly.	St
1.1.6	The connection wizard does not help.	St
1.2.1	1) switching the working PC to the non-working port with the non-working cable.	St
1.2.2	2) Try another port on the router for the non-working PC.	St
1.3.1	I switched cables and still have a &quot;network cable unplugged&quot; message.	St
1.3.2	The port connected to new computer does work when connected to the original computer so the port does not seem to be the problem.	St
1.3.3	This connection has worked perfectly with my old Dell.	St
1.3.4	I only replaced towers, no cables or other items.	St
1.3.5	I just can't find a cure.	St
1.4.1	by cycling the power off and on.	St
1.4.2	This may update a stuck DHCP client list.	St
1.5.1	If the network works fine in spite of the notification, read http://www.windowsnetworking.com/articles_tutorials/Disable-Media-Sense-TCPIP-Windows-XP.html to turn it off.	St
1.5.2	I've fixed it dozens of times myself and it's always been the motherboard and lan drivers.	St
1.5.3	Remember that if you ever accepted a Microsoft Windows Update Driver, then I think your only exit is a total OS install or the above off setting.	St
