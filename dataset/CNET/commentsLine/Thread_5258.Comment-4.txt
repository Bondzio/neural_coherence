i beleive i have tracked it down to one of two services that itunes installs.
these are ipahelper and applemobiledeviceservice.
it is one of these two causing it.
i have suspended both and the mouse movement is smooth again.
i just have not taken the time to figure out which of the two it is (since i do not need either to run, i just suspend both).
i do have a microsoft wireless laser desktop 6000 with the latest driver versions off the ms site (ver 6.2), so it is not the ms drivers.
