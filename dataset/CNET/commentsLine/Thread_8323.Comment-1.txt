my computer currently has two hard drives; 8mb (master) & 2mb (slave).
i removed the 2mb drive and tried to install a new 13.6mb drive.
i plugged the ide cable labeled &quot;slave&quot; and the power cable into my new hard drive, and when i turned on my computer it failed to boot.
it says it cannot detect a master drive.
what happened?
i never even touched the master hard drive!
p.s.
i'm running windows xp.
