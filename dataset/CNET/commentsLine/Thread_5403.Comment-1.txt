i know wow will play fine on a macbook pro, but i am curious how well it plays on a lower level macbook.
has anyone had any experience with this?
i know veronica the adoreable on the buzz out loud podcast was going to look into it, but i haven't heard anything solid about the gaming performance of the macbook.
obviously i know the macbook pro is the better way to go, i just dont want to shell out the $2500 for one if i dont need to.
thanx:)
