&quot; they all play well on the computer dvd, but when I put them on my sony dvd player in the living room, I get some still screens and some skips.
&quot; I had this APEX DVD player that I gave away.
Why?
It did that on DVD+R and DVD-R from any machine/drive.
You need to try another DVD player.
In closing, I am thinking the 4X media should be burned at 2X, 8X at 4X and so on.
Just a nagging feeling it works better.
No websites to back me up, just me.
