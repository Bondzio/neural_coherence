<s> I've tried to find out certain things about the N-7. </s>
<s> But came up short. </s>
<s> Even on the N-7 site itself. </s>
<s> What I'd like to know is: Is there a Micro SD slot in the N-7?. </s>
<s> What kind of Music Formats will it play? </s>
<s> What kind of Video Formats will it play? </s>
<s> If I plug in a Device into the Micro USB will it recognize a Device? </s>
<s> Such as a OTG Cable with a Ext-HDD,or a Mini/Micro SD Card Reader with card plugged in? </s>
<s> If not,is there a similar sized tablet I should be looking at? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Formats. </s>
<s> Since we can add players like VLC Player it would be more than I can type here for what will play. </s>
<s> It's like you asking me what formats a Windows PC can play! </s>
