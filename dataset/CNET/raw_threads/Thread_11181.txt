Oh well, I always want to ask: Can two different video card can work together? I want to play Crysis, I just have 512mb video card. Crysis require 640mb to get smooth gameplay. I just have one Video card PCI-Express 16x Bus. I wonder I can buy other one video card and put nVidia video card in PCI not PCI-Express 16x with other nVidia video card? They will can work together? Hope so! ~Thanks!

Again, the PCI slot is so slow this is not an option anyone offers. My favorite list is at http://www.tomshardware.com/2008/01/03/the_best_gaming_graphics/ You'll also want a dual core CPU, on XP 1GB RAM and for Vista 2GB main memory. Bob
