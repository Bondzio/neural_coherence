thanks, i'll go talk to my brother about the cd's because i bought it from his old boss a while back and like i said earlier, i'm not to tech savvy when it comes to computers.
i'm sure the guy i bought it from will have the cd's somewhere.
if not i'll get him to maybe try reinstalling xp on ym computer.
thanks again, b. hoffman
