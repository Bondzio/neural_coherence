1.1.1	Hi People , I just bought a HP d4100y desktop from hpshopping.com .	St
1.1.2	I set it up on Saturday night , configured my DSL , Outlook Express , installed my printer and scanner software and downloaded and installed Mozilla Firefox .	St
1.1.3	Everything was working fine .	St
1.1.4	I pressed the sleep button for the monitor , left the pc on and went to bed .	St
1.1.5	The next morning when I got up it was frozen and the fan was on making quite a bit of noise .	St
1.1.6	I turned it off , went out for a few hours and tried rebooting when I came back but got nothing but a black screen .	St
1.1.7	So , I called customer support .	St
1.1.8	I did n't realize HP had outsourced their support just like Dell .	St
1.1.9	I was on hold for over 20 minutes before someone answered ( no surprise there ) .	St
1.1.10	After a half an hour of disconnecting , reconnecting , shutting down and turning things off and on , it was finally determined that my motherboard had gone bad .	St
1.1.11	So I 'm expecting HP to have a simple solution at no cost to me but to my surprise the tech tells me she needs to send me a new motherboard and a technician along with it to ensure it does n't get damaged during the shipping process and this was gon na cost me $ 29.99 for the technician .	St
1.1.12	Of course I told her this was ridiculous as it was a brand new computer and it should be covered under warranty .	St
1.1.13	She again tried to explain how the motherboard was very delicate and if she mailed it without the technician that it might get damaged .	St
1.1.14	My HP warranty covers the actual part but not the cost of sending the technician .	St
1.1.15	( I was envisioning a huge box being delivered and when I open it up , an actual live technician would pop out cradling the motherboard in his arms like a baby .	St
1.1.16	Would I get to keep this technician for my own personal use ?	Ques
1.1.17	What do you feed them anyway ? )	Ques
1.1.18	I did n't understand this as my warranty says 1 year parts AND labor .	St
1.1.19	I again told her that this was unacceptable for me to have to pay for anything at this point since the mb was obviously defective .	St
1.1.20	I told her I 'd just as soon return the computer and be done with it .	St
1.1.21	She then told me there was another option ( as if it slipped her mind ) where she would send me a box for the pc , then Fed Ex would come pick it up , deliver it to a HP repair center and then deliver it back to me within 9 days at no charge .	St
1.1.22	I said that would be fine .	Polite
1.1.23	Then I had to wait for about five minutes on hold while she placed the order .	St
1.1.24	I was still a bit unsure of what was happening so I asked her why she was sending me a box because I just opened my pc last night and of course I still have the box .	St
1.1.25	& quot ; Oh , & quot ; she said , & quot ; I guess I should have asked you that before I placed the order .	St
1.1.26	Do n't worry though , it will only take a day or two for the new box to arrive and I ca n't change the order now since it 's already been entered in our system. & quot ; Aghhh ! ! !	St
1.1.27	Anyway , now I 'm thinking I might want to just return the computer to HP rather than have them replace the motherboard .	St
1.1.28	After all , I paid top dollar for a new computer , not a refurbished one .	St
1.1.29	I 'm also worried that there might be other problems caused by the motherboard going .	St
1.1.30	I also just saw virtually the same computer , except in a Gateway box , advertised at Circuit City .	St
1.1.31	It came with Media Center ( mine has XP Home ) a printer and an extra DVD drive and cost about $ 400 less .	St
1.1.32	What woud you guys do ?	Ques
1.2.1	I 've been using HP products for over a decade now , but never had that much bad luck with them .	St
1.2.2	In fact , I 've only had a few problems , and always received excellent support .	St
1.2.3	On one occasion when my computer started acting up and troubleshooting did n't solve it , they offered to pay for shipping and guarenteed repair by the end of the week .	St
1.2.4	( They never offered to ship me an inflatable repairman , which , by the way , eats crisp 20-dollar bills .	St
1.2.5	; ) ) I decided to check some other things first , and found out it was due to a corrupted BIOS update a few days earlier .	St
1.2.6	Glad to know they were so willing to help , but glad I did n't lose my computer for a week .	St
1.2.7	However , in your case , it sounds like you 're getting the royal flush ... along with your pocketbook and technological security .	St
1.2.8	They sent you a lemon , do n't want to fully admit it , and tried to avoid paying for shipping expenses as well as the replacement part by ''forgetting '' to mention it .	St
1.2.9	I love HP , but even I would n't go along with all that .	St
1.2.10	Since the motherboard was faulty , I 'd immediately question ( as you did ) what else might be wrong , and reqest a new PC , not just a replacement part .	St
1.2.11	There is a reason ''remanufactured '' PCs only come with a 90-day warrenty , even though all damaged parts have been replaced .	St
1.2.12	Since Circuit City 's sale on the Gateway is better than what you got , and for less money , I 'd definately send it back with a note attached ... ''I would like to return your faulty product , and request that you forward my check to Gateway , c/o Circuit City . ''	St
1.2.13	Just explain that you 've had a bad experience with them , do n't want to chance having another damaged computer sent , and that you 've found a better deal elsewhere .	St
1.2.14	Hopefully they 'll understand and refund your money .	St
1.2.15	If not , do n't settle for less than a new computer , and do n't pay a penny for shipping , repairs , or pet repairmen .	St
1.2.16	Hope this helps , John	St
1.3.1	I have the sa4000T and been encountering beeps everyonce in a while and the computer will not post .	St
1.3.2	First it started as 3 or 4 short beeps , now recently like today , i 've received one short beep and 8 additional fast short beeps .	St
1.3.3	R.Profitt said to use my warranty , but i 've had my machine for 7 months and do n't want them to reformat my hard drive .	St
1.3.4	SInce , i have a temporary solution , that will allow the pc to startup , i will just leave it alone and not let the nusiance to get to me .	Sug
1.3.5	Besides , i went to hp 's site for it and it shows for the motherboard , it only cost $ 18 and i would have to send back the defective one .	St
1.3.6	Sounds good to me ...	Polite
1.3.7	I can not believe that hp/compaq will have motherboard problems with that model especially since every single one is customized directly from hp/compaq .	St
1.3.8	I will never buy another hp/compaq .	St
1.3.9	BUt go for emachines/gateway for my next computer , or rather build my own .	St
1.3.10	ROger	St
1.4.1	Roger , are you saying they told you the motherboard costs $ 18 or did I misunderstand .	St
1.4.2	The tech support lady I spoke with says the motherboards cost about $ 350 .	St
1.4.3	Both prices seem out of whack to me but then again , I do n't know that much about computers .	St
1.4.4	John : Thanks for your input .	St
1.4.5	The more and more I think about it the more I want to just return the pc and get a new one , this time from a local vendor so if there 's a problem I can just bring it back .	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	Yes RETURN it .	St
1.6.2	Only accept repair after the return policy time period in over .	St
1.6.3	( They never offered to ship me an inflatable repairman , which , by the way , eats crisp 20-dollar bills .	St
1.6.4	Note : If they are not crisp , demands $ 50 bills instead .	St
1.6.5	John	St
1.7.1	My motherboard costs $ 18 as its the 8 month predecessor to yours that looks exactly the same , yet was manufacturered by compaq .	St
1.7.2	Your motherboard only costs $ 190 .	St
