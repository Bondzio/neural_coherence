I'm looking at getting one of Velocity Micro's SX-V desktops after reading great reviews about them all over the internet...but am confused at what their &quot;VideoCool Positive Pressure Airflow System - Speed adjustable, with light&quot; specifically is...they don't offer any mention of it anywhere on their website but it appears to be standard on their higher-end gaming PC's...wondering if it'll be worth the $39.00???
?
