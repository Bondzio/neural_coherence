once in awhile we get fixated on &quot;what's next?&quot; in this industry there is always a what's next so be careful to not get too engaged in waiting for the next big thing.
there's always a new cpu or card to show up in weeks or months.
today, ati has some really great cards.
you would be hard pressed to outstrip their 1gb video cards in sli mode.
