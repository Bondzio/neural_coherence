I wired the Mac to the router with an ethernet cable to see if it would change things.
No luck.
should it have made a difference?
Can I use some different configuration to let them communicate via ethernet?
BTW, I get the above error when trying to access the WORKGROUP.
When I access that workgroup on the PC, it does see the Mac as one of its members, but I get a similar error when trying to access it (the Mac from the PC - &quot;the network path was not found&quot;).
Anyone know how I can solve this??
?
