<s> Ok I have a VIVO Nvidia agp 8X Card I dont want to Toss. </s>
<s> And I want to Upgrade to the Good Stuff and I want to use my VIVO for tv as well and Recording TV wile I work. </s>
<s> But I want to Play the new games and the power of this card is outdated Hell it barely lets me play wow at near max. </s>
<s> I want to build a System with both PCIE and AGP slots and use my old card instead of tossing it. </s>
<s> So is this a Possibility. </s>
<s> Please Assist if U can </s>
<s> get a motherboard that can take both an agp & a pcie card? </s>
<s> you can choose to do more research on this if you like. </s>
<s> The first thing might be to see if such board/s exist. </s>
<s> you'd have to check whether you can use both at the same time. </s>
<s> Check out the ASRock Motherboards. </s>
<s> http://www.asrock.com/index.asp Let us know. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> All produced boards with both AGP and PCI Express, they are almost all exclusively based on the VIA PT880 series of chipsets, and usually offer a PCIe x16 mechanical slot, which is only wired for x4 transfers. </s>
<s> I would suggest considering a TV tuner board in addition to your new PCI Express board, instead of spending a great deal of time and money looking for a fairly proprietary motherboard design, especially as the PT880 is no longer a new chipset, which causes some problems for future upgrades. </s>
<s> ASRock at a time produced an AMD motherboard which offered PCI Express x16 (full x16 transfers) and AGP 8x (full speed as well), based on a ULi solution, however this board is notoriously hard to find, especially now that ULi is part of nVidia. </s>
<s> Additionally, this board was designed for Socket 939, Socket AM2 could be ammended to it through means of a proprietary add-in board, which is usually even harder to find. </s>
<s> The setup actually work fairly well, it was just very hard to find available for purchase. </s>
<s> I know that at one time Newegg sold the board, however I'm doubting if they still do. </s>
<s> Well All I want to do is use agp and pcie cards thats it not anything Fancy Just dont want to toss my old card since it works fine... </s>
<s> I could care less about a MB with bult in Crap I wouldnt buy anyway cause Bult in meens Not upgradable. </s>
<s> Not that you cant hook a newer tv tuner into that mb. </s>
<s> And who knows maybe the mb will be dumb and fight the new card. </s>
<s> All I wanted to know was plainly This Do the new Generation MB still Fight for Video Dominece between Ports. </s>
<s> Example back int he day if you had Onboard Video and a new vid card if you didnt disable the On board the PC tried to feed bits of into to both Video sources. </s>
<s> So you were Forced to Disable Onboard Video. </s>
<s> BUT will 2 video cards nowadays do the same Retardation or have we leaped forward from this glitch and I dont know steped forward in PC Intelegence... Me am just want use 2 vid cards agp/tvtuner and pcie new purdy stuff can u am answer me rationaly internet world people. </s>
<s> Motherboards with an AGP and PCIe slots are not available. </s>
