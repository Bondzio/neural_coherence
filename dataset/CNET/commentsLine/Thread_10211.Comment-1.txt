i'm about to buy a tablet and need some help deciding between these wide aspect choices:  (2000 dpi., affordable) not sure if it will work well with sketchbook pro... anyone know?
(only 1000dpi., this one is affordable also)  (a little more than i want to spend.
2000lpi.)
wacom is too expensive for the size i want.
looking to spend about $100(+,-).
i'm mostly unsure about how all of these will work with sketchbook.
i think i like the adesso but i'm just not sure yet.
anyone have any other suggestions/advice?
thanks for any help.
