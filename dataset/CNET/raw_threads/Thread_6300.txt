Plus if he does video editing or works with Photoshop. You can never have enough RAM. Plus, when my mate went from just 512Mb to 1Gb, it stopped any stuttering in Half-Life 2 and Doom3. These are my various experiences with a few PCs. I've played F.E.A.R. with 1Gb and there are parts in the game when the screen gets busy and it slows down very briefly, but not too often, if you get the drift Dual RAM would help me & others in this case but I've got stuck with single-channel and my max RAM amount is a reasonable 2Gb. What's the difference anyway people with having dual-channel over single-channel? If it's anything like AGP x8 versus PCI-E x16 debate then my current GPU can match the eqivilant to Geforce 6800Ultra for 3DMark points of 5842 despite PCI-E having more lanes.

If not, check your system DOCs or alternatively go to Belarc.com and download Belarc Advisor. Once you've run Belarc, you'll know more than you ever wanted to know about your PC. Among other things, it will tell you how many memory slots you have, which slots the DIMMs are in, and the DIMM desnsity. Armed with your system info . . then go to Crucial.com. Enter the information requested and you will end up choices of DIMMs guaranteed to work with your system. You can do same with Kingston too but I beleive Crucial has better info about various mfg systems and whether or not you need or should use DIMMs in pairs or not. Let us know how it works out.
