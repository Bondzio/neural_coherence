1.1.1	I have 3 Western Digital hard drives .	St
1.1.2	Two WD-2500KS ( 250 gigs ) and a WD-2000JD ( 200 gig ) , all SATA .	St
1.1.3	I use one of the 250 's for my OS and the other two for additional storage .	St
1.1.4	I also have a 250 gig MyBook for backups .	St
1.1.5	I have two problems .	St
1.1.6	I 'm going to reinstall Windows XP next week , and I know that as soon as I plug in the MyBook it will recognize it .	St
1.1.7	How do I get it that my internal storage drives can be recognized without having to format them and clear off all the data ?	Ques
1.1.8	I do n't mind formatting the 200 because there 's nothing on it that 's not backed up .	St
1.1.9	But the 250 has all my Tivo 's videos in it and it wo n't fit in my almost full MyBook , so I 'd really like to keep it the way it is .	St
1.1.10	My other is that Windows is n't recognizing all the space .	St
1.1.11	It takes 12 gigs off .	St
1.1.12	It says the 250 's are 232 and the 200 is 186 .	St
1.1.13	Is this normal for Service Pack 2 ?	Ques
1.1.14	Also , the 200 gig is an older one that I have n't used much and the 250 's are only about 6 months old .	St
1.1.15	Is there any freeware out there that can tell me which drive is healthier so I can install the OS on the healthier drive ?	Ques
1.1.16	And	St
1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	There are two kinds of Gb .	St
1.2.3	One is 1 billion bytes , the other is 2**30 bytes .	St
1.2.4	The last one is bigger , so there fit less on a disk .	St
1.2.5	The maker advertizes the smaller version ( of which there are more ) , Windows reports the larger version ( of which there are less ) .	St
1.2.6	Take your calculator and you 'll see you 've got no problem at all .	St
1.2.7	2 .	St
1.2.8	Windows XP setup has the option - in principle - to only delete the windows folder and the program files folder and leave the rest as it is .	St
1.2.9	Still , if I were you , I 'd buy a second external hard disk to backup the 200 Gb to .	St
1.2.10	It 's a good idea to have a backup of everything , including your Tivo 's you do n't want to lose .	St
1.2.11	And you might need the driver diskette ( press f6 when asked if you 've got such ) or setup wo n't recognize the SATA disk at all ( unless it 's a recent version of XP Media Center , I 'm being told ) .	St
1.2.12	If you 've got more question on the setup , the XP forum is a better place .	St
1.2.13	Hope this helps , Kees	St
1.3.1	Yeah , I should probably buy another MyBook , they 're always on sale at my local Best Buy .	St
1.3.2	The weird thing that I do n't understand is that Windows wo n't recognize a new or blank hard drive until it 's formated by Western Digital 's Data Lifeguard , but it will if Windows is on the drive .	St
1.3.3	The 2nd 250 used to have my OS , but I installed Windows on the other one and stopped using the old one for a while .	St
1.3.4	When I plugged it back in a few days ago it was recognized by Windows without any formatting .	St
1.3.5	Was it because Windows was still on the drive ?	Ques
1.3.6	In that case , would it be a good idea for now to install Windows on the other 250 , leaving the files intact , then installing Windows on the 200 and formatting the one I 'm using right now .	St
1.3.7	Then copy all the files from the OS 250 to the blank one , then reformat the OS one , so I 'd have the OS on the 200 , and both 250 's would be additional storage .	St
1.3.8	I hope that 's not too confusing .	St
1.3.9	Oh and another question , is it better to have my OS on the smaller drive and the bigger ones as storage ?	Ques
1.3.10	Thanks for all the help with this .	St
1.4.1	It does n't matter at all what 's on a disk .	St
1.4.2	It 's recognized by My Computer or Windows Explorer as soon as it is has a properly formatted partition .	St
1.4.3	It 's recognized by Disk management even if not partitioned at all ( it will report unallocated space ) .	St
1.4.4	Saying that Windows does n't recognize the disk is senseless , as long as you do n't tell what PART of Windows ( either My Computer/Windows Explorer or Disk Management ) .	St
1.4.5	The partition has to be formatted to have Windows on it , of course .	St
1.4.6	That 's the only relation that 's reasonable .	St
1.4.7	The best drive for the OS is the fastest one .	St
1.4.8	Size is unimportant as long as it 's more than 10 Gb ( which allows for Windows , Program Files , swap space , spool space and other minor uses ) .	St
1.4.9	Kees	St
1.5.1	**What I meant was Windows Explorer/My Computer .	St
1.5.2	When I re-instll the OS , will it recognize my other drives that are currently partitioned with data on them ?	Ques
1.6.1	Windows XP will have difficulty with any drive over 127GB until you install SP1 .	St
1.6.2	Windows XP SP2 will be fine as soon as the motherboard drivers are installed on most machines .	St
1.6.3	Minor differences like that mean the answer changes with what you have .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
