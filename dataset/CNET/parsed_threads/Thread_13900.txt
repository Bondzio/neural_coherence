<s> Here is the deal. </s>
<s> I have a 750gb hard drive running windows XP Pro that seems to have cratered. </s>
<s> I attempted a restart after removing a program and it gave me a BSOD. </s>
<s> When I attempted to restart in safe mode, it locked up on the mup.sys. </s>
<s> I had this happen once before and was able to resolve it by booting from the recovery discs. </s>
<s> However, this time, when I went to boot from the recovery discs, it would not even do that. </s>
<s> I removed the disc and was going to retrieve the important files I had created since my last backup by placing it in a hdd enclosure and attaching to another computer, but when I do, the primary partition asks to be formatted before use and shows 0 bytes used. </s>
<s> Does anybody have a good idea of how to proceed? </s>
<s> Thanks Brian </s>
<s> Give this approach a chance: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer/ That approach will work with any version of Windows. </s>
<s> If the information is available, it will help you to get it retrieved. </s>
<s> I would then expect to get a new hard drive and use the recovery discs to return the PC to operating condition. </s>
<s> I do not see a mention of what PC this is in other than Windows XP Pro but since there are recovery discs, I have to assume it is from a major manufacturer like Dell, HP, Gateway? </s>
<s> There may be a way to do a repair install, if more info is provided. </s>
<s> It echoes something I helped create years ago at http://tips.oncomputers.info/archives2004/0401/2004-Jan-11.htm Today it is even better and EASIER than ever. </s>
<s> If that fails, try ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY and GETDATABACK. </s>
<s> Use google to find those titles. </s>
<s> If these fail, the next stop is http://www.drivesavers.com Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the replies. </s>
<s> I tried the Ubuntu disc solution from the first reply, but it did not seem to work. </s>
<s> The error message that I got when I first tried to mount the disk was: &quot;Unable to mount location DBus error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply: Did not receive a reply. </s>
<s> Possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken.&quot; When I went through the steps and tried to force a mount anyway, I got an error message to the tone of: &quot;DBus error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply: Did not receive a reply. </s>
<s> Possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken.&quot; I did some digging around and found another similar idea from howtogeek http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/15761/recover-data-like-a-forensics-expert-using-an-ubuntu-live-cd/ that uses the testdisk utility. </s>
<s> I will give that a shot. </s>
<s> Further thoughts? </s>
<s> Brian </s>
<s> Try ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY GETDATABACK And you discovered TESTDISK. </s>
<s> If those fail, it's off to http://www.drivesavers.com Bob </s>
<s> Hello Brain, I hope you have managed the recovery from your disk for your important files. </s>
<s> If not,is it still detected in the bios? </s>
<s> If detected, many software or tools can do that. </s>
