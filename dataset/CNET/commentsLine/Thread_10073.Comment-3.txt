increasing your processing speed while using pc100, is like buying a ferrari and using regular unleaded.
your performance will suffer.
if you are going the upgrade route, consider adding new ddr compatible with your new board.
between a new p4 2.4(533mhz?
), new board and new ddr(at least 256mb) you will greatly increase performance.
if you can splurg for a sata hard drive that wouldn't hurt either.
optical drives, floppy, sound and video can be recycled (for gaming you might want to upgrade the vid) but that's another story.
