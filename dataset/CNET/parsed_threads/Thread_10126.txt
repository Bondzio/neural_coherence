<s> I'm trying to connect my new Dell Dimension 8400 (3.0Ghz/512Mb/XPsp1) to my home wireless network. </s>
<s> I installed two diiferent PCI adapter cards in my one available PCI slot -- an older D-Link (11b) and a brand new Netgear (11g) (which Dell Sales assured me is compatible). </s>
<s> Both cards detected my Netgear wireless router and provided an excellent internet connection, so I'm assuming they were seated properly. </s>
<s> The problem is that every time I shut down the system I get the blue screen of death with the following message: Hardware Malfunction NMI: Parity Check/Memory Parity Error The System has halted The system runs and shuts down perfectly when the PCI cards are removed. </s>
<s> D-Link and Netgear Support technicians told me I have to contact Dell, but Dell Support doesn't seem to have an answer for me. </s>
<s> Has anyone else had this problem, or better yet a solution? </s>
<s> Anyone know which wireless PCI adapter cards are truly compatible with Dell hardware? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> In short, 1. http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6122-0.html?forumID=44&threadID=36495&messageID=425819&tag=srch You need to dive into the Event Viewer and find what's up. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Many owners don't have current BIOS, drivers and more. </s>
<s> They rely on Microsoft's Windows Update or Driver Update buttons. </s>
<s> What do you do about this? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Spyware. </s>
<s> My bet is that your machine has some. </s>
<s> What do you do about it? </s>
<s> I'm sure you'll fix it, but the list has to be worked since the cause is somewhere in items 1, 2 or 3 and why Dell has no clue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> The computer is brand new, out of the box so spyware shouldn't be an issue, and I can't believe the BIOS would be outdated already. </s>
<s> I think Dell is just pushing machines that aren't compatible with wireless adapter cards. </s>
<s> Anyway, I decided to compromise and use a USB adapter. </s>
<s> Not as fast but so much easier! </s>
<s> Hi, I just bought a Dell dimension 8400. </s>
<s> I installed a wireless PCI card (D-Link G520+) in it, and receive the same blue screen when the machine shuts down. </s>
<s> D-link points to Dell. </s>
<s> First line support of Dell has no clue. </s>
<s> I am awaiting results of escalation within Dell. </s>
<s> Any feedback of users having same problem would be welcome. </s>
<s> Hedi </s>
<s> The same issues can apply and looking in the Event Viewer reveals the cause about 1/2 the time. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi Bob, 2 and 3 are likely not applicable: the problem happened just after unpacking the machine, without having time to get spyware from internet. </s>
<s> For what concerns bios/drivers, the support of both Dell and D-Link checked this up, I have all latest releases (new machine, new card). </s>
<s> So I go for 1) searching in the event - but no sure what I am suppose to look for. </s>
<s> Kind regards Hedi </s>

<s> Hi Bob, I went back to the store and changed the DLW520+ for the DLW520 extreme(they have 2 different chipsets). </s>
<s> This one is working fine - no blue screen anymore when shutdowning. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> Kind regards Hedi </s>
