i will use it to compose docs,spreadsheets etc for work, check email, share pictures, surf web and use some basic apps at first.
it will be my first tablet but i also want it to be worthy of time from a techno point of view.
don't want to be buying or wanting to buy another one in -6- months.
prime is priced the same as the ipad2.
i did not mention the ipad.
