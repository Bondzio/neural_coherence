My issue started roughly a week ago, my pc would randomly go into a full freeze, mouse would not move, sound would not play, but the pc would remain the same I.E fans would still spin and no noticable changes to the components theirself. There is no pattern to the lock ups, I have monitored the temps for my cpu/gpu and there is no overheating (example, the max my gpu has got was 55C, and my cpu was 50C.) My pc fully starts up and get to desktop without issue, sometimes it will freeze on desktop, with nothing else running. While other times it will let me play for 10-15 min then lock up. Other times it has let me play for a few hours the lock up. I have tried almost everything I know. This is a custom PC I built back in November, it has ran without issue until last week. Here is my setup: GPU: EVGA 01G-P3-1556-KR GeForce GTX 550 Ti (Fermi) FPB 1GB I have two cards in my pc, they are SLI'd - I have taken one out to try to eliminate the problem, no change SSD: OCZ Agility 3 AGT3-25SAT3-120G CPU: AMD FX-6300 Vishera 3.5GHz (4.1GHz Turbo) Socket AM3+ 95W Six-Core Desktop Processor FD6300WMHKBOX Ram: AMD Performance Edition 8GB (2 x 4GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1333 Desktop Memory Model AP38G1338U2K Case: APEVIA X-JUPITER-JR S-Type X-JPJST-MG Metallic Grey SECC Steel ATX Mid Tower Computer Case Motherboard: ASRock 970 EXTREME3 AM3+ AMD 970 SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX AMD Motherboard PSU: RAIDMAX HYBRID 2 RX-630SS 630W ATX12V V2.2/ EPS12V SLI Ready CrossFire Ready Modular Power Supply Any suggestions would be awesome, Thanks in advance Dewey

I see a lot of those rigs with similar choices and the owners usually have to return parts and change motherboards or SSDD. Ask the designer of the system to make it right with you. There's a lot of suspect choices in this setup. Ask the designer for help. Bob

If you can get your hands on a hard drive, try with it instead of the SSD. Assuming you are using W7 or 8. If it turns out that you do have to shop for another SSD, look at Crucial's m4 - has a good range of compatibility with mobos and CPUs. And of course you must flash its latest FW. Good luck.
