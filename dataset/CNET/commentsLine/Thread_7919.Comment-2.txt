recheck your work.
even if this a pita, you need to do it.
no amount or hemming and hawing is going to work for you, if the wiring was soldered on more firmly attached, solder all back on and be sure, that +, is positive and -, is negative.
don't take anything for granted and check the surrounding area for any damage.
it appears while you got power the cmos or bios really isn't active.
also, be sure to inspect thew wiring as in where it goes beyond the battery is ok. tada -----willy
