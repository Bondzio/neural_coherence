1.1.1	I live in the apartment building with over 100 routers around me .	St
1.1.2	2 years ago I got Netgear WGR614 v7 router .	St
1.1.3	The range was not good at all .	St
1.1.4	My internet connection was getting lost thru 2 walls , 2 doors and 40 feet away from the router .	St
1.1.5	Last week , I have upgraded to N-router Netgear WNR2000 .	St
1.1.6	Same problem .	St
1.1.7	The Netgear people told me that I need to buy more equipment ( access point WG602 or powerline adaptor WGX102 ) .	St
1.1.8	Can someone please tell me what is my best wireless solution ?	Ques
1.1.9	What equipment do I need to make my wireless reach thru 2 walls , 2 doors and 40 feet distance ?	Ques
1.1.10	Please keep in mind that living in the apartment is completely different than in your own house where you only have one router and no interference from others .	Sug
1.1.11	Thank you .	St
1.2.1	What they are recommending you do is put a device between to amplify the signal .	St
1.2.2	Depends if that realistic .	St
1.2.3	Can you place a device between your router and PC that can receive and then retransmit the signal .	St
1.2.4	If your router used external antennas I would recommend using a directional antenna .	St
1.2.5	I do n't think you have that option ?	Ques
1.2.6	You could buy a router that took direction antenna but it helps to have a direction antenna on the PC also .	Sug
1.2.7	You can get a very tight beam that nobody can interfere with .	St
1.2.8	So I would first see if you can find a channel that is not in use .	St
1.2.9	It will take a while just observing the tools that come with either your router or your pc wireless nic .	St
1.2.10	There are freeware packages available also that will monitor signal strength on channels but they do not work with all pc nic cards .	St
1.2.11	If they are all heavy used then I would see if you could just & quot ; borrow & quot ; one of these lol .	St
1.2.12	Before you buy a lot of equipment I would see if using 802.1 & quot ; a & quot ; .	St
1.2.13	Since this is not real popular you stand a better chance to not have interference on it .	St
1.2.14	Of course it not being popular will limit your selection and cost a bit more .	St
1.3.1	I am only 40 feet away from my cable with Netgear WNR2000 router .	St
1.3.2	Can I just connect my notebook to my old Netgear WGR614 v7 router and have 2 routers talk to each other ?	Ques
1.3.3	How can I find out what channel I am on , if it is in use then how do I change it ?	Ques
1.3.4	What is the name of software that checks the signal and where can I get it ?	Ques
1.3.5	Thanks .	Polite
1.4.1	Not sure if you can or ca n't that is a special feature that allow a router to pretend its a pc .	St
1.4.2	Still your old router is a G router and your new one has N but also supports G. If you paid for N you should be using it .	St
1.4.3	I assume you have a N based card in your laptop ?	Ques
1.4.4	If not that may be the easiest solution since better coverage is the key advantage to N There are screens in the router config that will tell you what channel you are using .	St
1.4.5	Even thought the book says to use auto when you have issues like you do you need to just randomly pick until it works .	St
1.4.6	I had assumed you had already done that .	St
1.4.7	When that method does not work is when you have to measure the signal strength .	St
1.4.8	I have a old router that I use to measure signal strength .	St
1.4.9	It been a while since I used a pc program but there are many if you search .	St
1.4.10	The problem is they do not all work on all machine/os/cards .	St
1.4.11	Still that is the hard way just start changing the channel , you are most likely compete for the same channel everyone else is that did not bother to select one manually .	St
