3895	0	12792	145581	NR	Catamount Panther	2/21/04 2:11 PM	1.07737266E12	Need Help With My Wireless Network	I'm trying to establish a wireless network that does more than just allow broadband internet access, which I've achieved thru cable modem to Linksys BEFW-11S4-v.2 4-Port Wireless Router cabled to my main HP Pavillion Desktop. My other 3 desktop PC's use Linksys Access Points to communicate with the router to gain flawless internet broadband access. My notebook PC, Toshiba A-35 uses an Atheros AR500-1X plus a wireless Network Adaptor. All of these PC's are on XP-Home and all have excellent internet access. But, I'm having trouble setting up a LAN that allows greater access from PC-to-PC to enable file sharing and printer/peripheral sharing. My main desktop (HP Pavillion), which is connected to the Router does not show a wireless connection (in tray at bottom), but instead shows Local Area Network. However, my other PC's & Notebook all show a Wireless Connection. I've disabled my McAfee Firewall. I just don't know how to accomplish the rest. Can anyone offer suggestions?
