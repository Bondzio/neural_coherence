My videos are stored on my wired system and I access the shared folders on my wireless computer connected to my TV. I have trouble watching large hd movies. I open my shared network folder, then open the video like I would if it was a local file. Is there a way I can force the file to open with UDP instead of TCP?

And before I go any further UDP is for when you want to build your own system of transfer as you design the error checking. So absolutely yes but are you up to the task? That is, it is rare a setting. Bob
