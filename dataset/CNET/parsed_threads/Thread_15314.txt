<s> So my powermac g4 was making a buzz noise and having trouble booting up. </s>
<s> I proceeded to repair the disk permissions under disk utilities and it helped the booting problem. </s>
<s> But I still hear the buzzing, is there anything I can do to figure out what it is? </s>
<s> Hard disks and fans are common bad buzzing noises. </s>
<s> I hope you have what you can't lose on backup. </s>
<s> Hard disks are cheap to replace before they go south. </s>
