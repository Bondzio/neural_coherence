My dvd-rom drive(samsung-616E) has been giving me problems for a while now, and I finally decided to do something about it. Not too long ago, when I inserted dvd's they would play then freeze up. The problem progressively got worse, and now it wont even recognize dvd's, but it still will play cds. I have tried cleaning the lense, reinstalling the drivers, reinstalling my dvd player program, and i have searched through other posts and tried changing the settings for the ide contollers, deleting the upper and lowers in the registry and still no avail.....any professional help out there would be greatly appreciated.

Next, you seem to cover what should be done to try to recover, but if you have a truly used DVD drive or one of the cheaper drives installed, they simply don't last that long, a 1yrs worth of use, expect some problems. About the only real test of assurance of a bad drive is to swap it out and install a new one. Here's a link that may help: http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/Reviews/Specific.aspx?ArticleId=13934 I also use a simple free player called, VLC, found at: http://www.videolan.org congrats 'or -----Willy

After dissection & troubleshooting, the cause was a bad drive, period. These things are so cheap they have to be cutting corners somewhere. If you put a DVD in and don't see it in &quot;My computer&quot; it's probably a bad drive. New ones are $30.
