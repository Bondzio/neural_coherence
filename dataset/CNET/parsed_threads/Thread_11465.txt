<s> I have a Thompson wireless router which has been firmware upgraded. </s>
<s> I can successfully access the Internet with my Intel iMac and my PC laptop. </s>
<s> When I try to connect to the router using Airport on my GG Powerbook 867Mhz OS X 10.5.8. </s>
<s> I get a connection timeout message. </s>
<s> I have successfully connected by airport/wifi to my old router in London and even to a MacDonalds free wifi. </s>
<s> No luck here and ISP unable to help despite sending me a new router and recommending the software upgrade. </s>
<s> Any assistance greatly welcome. </s>

<s> is sending out 802.11B and not just G and N. This could be the problem. </s>
<s> Access the router, see the manual, and make sure that it is broadcasting on all three channels B, G& N P </s>
<s> Many thanks for the tip ~ I'll check straightaway. </s>

<s> Sadly not the root of the problem - Interface Type: </s>
<s> Now that we have established that, there is a next step. </s>
<s> I assume that you are not spreading the wealth around the neighborhood by running a wireless network that does not have encryption. </s>
<s> The next step is to turn OFF the encryption and see if you can now connect to the router with the PowerBook. </s>
<s> Let us know P </s>
<s> Ok, I'll give it a go in the a.m. and come back to you. </s>
<s> Many thanks again - I've been working with Macs since 1992 and do Mac support myself but this one has me stumped. </s>
<s> Yes that works. </s>
<s> Can log into wifi from PowerBook G4 when encryption is turned off. </s>
<s> Unfortunately have had to re-enable encrytion as have a lot of data on other machines logged in to wifi. </s>
<s> I guess we're a little closer to an answer though; you are top man. </s>
<s> Maximum thanks for all the help. </s>

<s> I have found that my older machines will only work with WEP. </s>
<s> The newer stuff leaves them out in the cold P </s>
<s> Ah, could be it - encryption type is WPA+WPA2. </s>
<s> Many more thanks. </s>
<s> I'll get on to the ISP. </s>

<s> It is up to you to set what type of encryption you use on that router. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Many, many thanks for all your help. </s>
<s> Edited the security preference in the Router Gateway to WEP and Lo the Powerbook now logs in fine. </s>
<s> Plusnet - who only came up with the correct solution after I had fed the info on the basis of your information - said i would have no problem logging on with my iMac which was not the case. </s>
<s> Aren't they supposed to know this stuff?! </s>
<s> Fortunately I managed to remedy the iMac login and now wait to see if I can get my wife's PC (spit) to connect. </s>
<s> HeyHo Best wishes I </s>
<s> WEP is no protection today. </s>
<s> That is, in less than 120 seconds with kid friendly software other folk can hijack your connection and use your internet connection as they wish. </s>
<s> BUT IN THIS DISCUSSION it looks like you are stuck with it. </s>
<s> When you can, and when the machines allow it, move off WEP ASAP. </s>
<s> And let's be clear. </s>
<s> MAC address filtering does not work and hiding the SSID only results in more complaints and no added security. </s>
<s> --&gt; Use what works but be aware of the downsides. </s>

<s> Many thanks for this info Bob. </s>
<s> Hope this thread has been useful for some other people too. </s>
