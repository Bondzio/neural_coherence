i'm wondering with my setup if buying a 8800gts is ok to do.
i'm not worried about power i have a nice antec 500w power supply, but based on the rest of my system specs give me some advice on video card upgrades... socket 939 amd 3700 san diego... 1 gig pc3200 ram... and thats really all that matters lol.... will this bottleneck my 8800gts performance badly?
i'd like to play oblivion on 1280x1024 on high... which the 8800gts should do.. but i dont if it will with my ram and processor... any help is appreciated, thx
