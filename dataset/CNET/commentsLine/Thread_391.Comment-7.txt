if you go to hp.com click on support and enter your computer model it will take you to the support page for that model.
if you go to specifications it will tell you what socket is used for the cpu.
hp is notorious for using of sizes that are not standard.
for instant my hp pavilion 750 uses a mobile processor but it does say that it is a 775 socket so i should be able to purchase any processor that will run on that socket.
most online computer stores such as newegg and pc connection allow you to search for parts by specifications such as the socket type.
also if it is an intel socket you can only use intel processors.
