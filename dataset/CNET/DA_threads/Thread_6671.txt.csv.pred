1.1.1	Before connecting a new desktop PC to the internet for the first time using either cable modem or DSL; besides having a very good anti-virus software program installed; what other software should I also have installed before I connect to the internet using a high speed connection for the first time?

1.2.1	If your OS is XP, you will want service pack 2 installed prior to your first time connection if possible.	St
1.2.2	Your broadband connection should also connect through a router which has a NAT (hardware) firewall.	Sug
1.2.3	This is a deterent and not totally secure, however.	St
1.2.4	You will want a decent browser and e-mail handler and the two that come from MS with XP are not on the &quot;good&quot; list.	St
1.2.5	You can also install a software firewall but these may take some tweaking to make them work as you wish.	St
1.2.6	I use the free Sygate product.	St
1.2.7	I don't know if it's ever blocked an attack but that's not what's most important.	St
1.2.8	Lastly, an overlooked defense is ones personal care while surfing.	St
1.2.9	Some would say never jump off a building without a parachute.	St
1.2.10	I say, never jump off a building.	St
1.2.11	Hope that helps.	St
1.3.1	Hi Big Steve, I see you are concerned about your new computer's security especially since you recently posted the other day: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html?forumID=68&threadID=62148&messageID=736563 Steven Haninger is an excellent computer tech and has given good advice along with others, but since you have made two different threads showing your concern, may I suggest you post in the Virus & Security Alerts forum.	St
1.3.2	There are many experts there just waiting for someone concerned like you to post.	St
1.3.3	http://reviews.cnet.com/5204-6132-0.html?forumID=32&start=0 As for myself, on my best desktop (WinXP SP2), I have Nortons Systems Works (it has the AntiVirus included along with other great stuff), and two free Spyware detection programs (AdAware & SpyBot), and the new BETA Microsoft Anti-Spyware (currently free until around July).	St
1.3.4	I have the Firewall in WinXP SP2 disabled to use the free Zone Alarm Firewall as it gives coverage on the IN and OUT.	St
1.3.5	On my other computers I use the free Avast antiVirus program instead of the free AVG, free Spyware (AdAware & SpyBot) and the free Zone Alarm Firewall.	St
1.3.6	Regards,	Polite
