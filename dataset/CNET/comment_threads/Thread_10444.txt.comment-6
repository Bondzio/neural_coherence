My Compaq bought 5 years ago also came with diskettes, but my 2 week old HP did not.
HP has a system resore partiton which contains all you need to repair or restore.
It's a good preview to the DVD/CD burner to make the requisite restore disks.
As far as SP2 is concerned, I installed it on my Compaq running XP Pro and had no problems whatsoever; the same is true of all the other Microsoft updates I installed.
This HP came with XP Home/SP2 and so far it has been fine.
I bought a copy of XP Pro which I am going to install soon.
