I made my router into a WAP (Idk why but it took me longer than I thought), now it works, no interruptions, but I feel that now the internet is much slower than with my old router.... My only indication of this is that videos take a lot longer to load (almost double the length of the video itself).
The speed seemed to be fine just after I turned the router into a WAP.
It was a few hours later that it got slow...
I think I have an aura that ruins electronics...
