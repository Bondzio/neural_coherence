i have a netgear wireless router model wgr614v4.
recently i signed up for sbc dsl service, the modem that comes with the plan has 1 lan port, quite ridiculous was my first thought.
anyway, i want to connect my wireless router (which also has 4 lan ports) to the dsl modem, and make the wireless router a dhcp server (as a desktop has to connect somewhere, right?).
my current planned setup (which has not worked) is telephone cable from wall to dsl modem - cat5 cable from dsl modem to netgear wan port - cat5 cable from netgear port 4 (main configuration port) to desktop computer.
any ideas on what settings i need to change would be much appreciated.
