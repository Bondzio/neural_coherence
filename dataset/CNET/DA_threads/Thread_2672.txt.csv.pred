1.1.1	Hi guys , Have one question .	St
1.1.2	I do n't know much about motherboards .	St
1.1.3	I have 2 of them and I 'd like to know which one is newer to keep .	St
1.1.4	Here they are : Intel D945GNT Asus P4P800-E ( Rev 1.02 ) Thanks for your help .	St
1.1.5	Rapheek	St
1.2.1	is the ASUS board is socket 478 and the Intel is LGA775 .	St
1.2.2	LGA775 is the newer design for the P4 processors and I still see a few such processors available .	St
1.2.3	This does n't mean I 'm recommending it over the ASUS .	St
1.2.4	Both are beyond the days of manufacturer support and there wo n't be a way to determine which will outlast the other .	St
1.2.5	But , the Intel is probably newer .	St
1.2.6	Hope that helps .	St
