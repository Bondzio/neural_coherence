my computer has 2 optical drives (dvd burner and dvd rom drive along with 2 sata drives.
when i upgraded my video card to a nvidia 8800, the computer started shutting down intermittently.
my power supply was around 350w at the time.
so i hustled down to fry's and picked up a no-name 500w ps that seem to handle the operation most of the time.
to be truthful, i did get a couple of shut-downs over a period of 6 months or so.
i almost never use the burner, but yesterday i tried to use it and shortly after starting the burn, the computer shut down.
today i tried it again with the same results.
once again, i'm thinking ps and perhaps trying one of the 600w-700w units out there.
my first question is &quot;do you think a bigger ps will correct this problem?&quot; my second question is &quot;what model number should i get?&quot; while i would like to keep the cost down to under $50-$75, i would rather spend more money for a dependable ps.
i don't think my no-name 500w really pulls that much power.
any input on this matter would be appreciated.
thanks
