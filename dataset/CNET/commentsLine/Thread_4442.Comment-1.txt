it's my dad's laptop and his hard drive failed so i wanted to upgrade to a ssd, upgrade the motherboard, and upgrade the memory.
i have about $500 to spend can anyone help me decide what brand to buy?
i want to make it as fast as possible and possibly play a few games and download movies and music etc...
