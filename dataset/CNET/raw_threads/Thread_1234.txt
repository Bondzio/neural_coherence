It's just some program (you didn't tell what program) that gives an error message. - Did you try to close other programs that might be using your webcam? - Is there an error or warning in Device manager for the webcam? - Did you happen to run a registry cleaner or disable some services for better performance? - Does the user manual tell something about prerequisites for using the webcam? - Does that program work if you boot into Safe mode?
