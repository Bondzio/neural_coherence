hi there, i have an acer aspire 5610 laptop.
windows died recently and if i use the acer recovery program i will lose the contents of my hard drives - something i am very keen to avoid.
so i got my hands on a windows xp pro cd and have installed windows.
the problem is now i cannot for the life of me get it to recognize my maxtor usb external hard drive.
i've installed every little thing i can find on the acer/intel/microsoft/maxtor websites etc but still nothing.
i've tried uninstalling the usb ports and reinstalling them - still nothing.
i've checked device manager to see if it's recognized but not mapping correctly - it's not in device manager.
i went into my bios to ensure that usb was enabled and it's not an option in the menu (i have phoenixbios).
i have tested the external hard drive on other pc's and it works fine.
when i plug it into my notebook it plays the sound to say it's recognized a usb input and then the usb symbol displays in the task bar with the message &quot;device not recognized&quot; - what can i do to get this to work - i've spent 26 hours so far and nothing has worked and it would take me forever to back 120gb onto dvds!
any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
