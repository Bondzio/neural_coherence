does anyone know how to replace the dvd-drive in the original xbox with a pc dvd-drive, because the xbox dvd-drive is only 5x, which results in slow loading times for me.
i want something like a 16x drive so i don't have to wait that long.... also, does anyone know if i can also replace the internal xbox hard drive with a pc hard drive, cause i want to rip some games onto the hard drive..... if anyone can give me a feedback, i'll deeply appreciate it.....
