1.1.1	So I was playing with my Bios Rom and adding a custom pic of Jonna Dark leaning on a Perfect dark logo with some program called my pic .	St
1.1.2	After I flashed the new bios , it was dead .	St
1.1.3	I thought , oh yeah , got ta reset the jp1 jumper to clear the bios settings so it will boot .	St
1.1.4	Well I did that and it still will not boot .	St
1.1.5	Then I though ooo yeah , I got that top hat thingy , so I can just pop that over my old bios and good as old .	St
1.1.6	I can redo my bios after that and everything will be ok !	St
1.1.7	Well when I put the top hat chip on , I got long beeps over and over and since its award bios .	St
1.1.8	THAT MEANS NOTHING !	St
1.1.9	So wtf is a fella to do ?	Ques
1.1.10	FYI , its a $ 150 mobo .	St
1.1.11	Replacement not really an option .	St
1.2.1	www.mrbios.com sells bios and will cross-ship .	St
1.2.2	your motherboard manufacturer may sell BIOS 's also .	St
1.2.3	if you have a friend with the same motherboard , check the electronics parts supply stores in your area .	St
1.2.4	they may be able to reprogram your chip from your friend 's .	St
1.2.5	last ditch , very dangerous , not recommended option : if you 've got a spare motherboard , you can boot it to DOS , pull that BIOS chip and replace it with yours while the PC is on , and try running the BIOS upgrade for your motherboard .	St
1.3.1	I 've used this service from http : //www.badflash.com http : //www.badflash.com/ and have done OK .	St
1.3.2	Check it out and pricing is explained and alot less than new mtrbd .	St
1.3.3	Also , I suggest and see if your system has a & quot ; boot strap & quot ; feature to possibility recover , check your mtrbd .	St
1.3.4	CD and look for it or that topic .	St
1.3.5	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	can do .	Res
1.4.2	I am also looking into the possiblilty of flashing my top hat with an old component that it would fit over ... hmmm ... buy buy buy huh ?	Ques
1.4.3	Well some people dint have money to waste .	St
1.4.4	j/k	St
1.5.1	Ok this top hat thing is interesting .	Polite
1.5.2	Can I put this on another device that has one and do a flash of it ?	Ques
1.6.1	If & quot ; top hat & quot ; means & quot ; hot flashing & quot ; placing one IC over another , then you 're on your own .	St
1.6.2	It may work it may not on its own merits .	St
1.6.3	Further , having successfully done it , you still need *very similar* mtrbd .	St
1.6.4	bios otherwise , features will get hosed or simply place a corrupted bios ( to org .	St
1.6.5	mtrbd . )	St
1.6.6	from new source and get flaky even if boots-up which alone is good but not 100 % as you may find out .	St
1.6.7	If it gets this far , you can then try reflashing again to the corrupted bios from org .	St
1.6.8	bios file to rebuild it to its & quot ; proper bios level & quot ; or any working revision now current .	St
1.6.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.7.1	What I meant was , to boot up a working motherboard .	St
1.7.2	Then while the power was still on , add the tophat and use a program called winflash which flashes the rom while xp is running , to reflash the tophat .	St
1.7.3	Once that is completed I would then add the updated top hat to my broken bios mobo and try to boot .	St
1.7.4	But I dont have another mobo in the house with the tophat and XP ...	St
1.7.5	So I was thinking of trying this with a component such as a LAN card or maybe a video card .	St
1.7.6	Unforunatly this doesnt work since firmware updates are much simpler on thoose and only require a program to be run .	St
1.7.7	On the other hand it should be able to be done .	St
1.7.8	I think a great project would be to try to figure out how to make one of these devices .	St
1.7.9	Later Willy .	St
1.8.1	Had a 20 $ off cupon , if they fail then I will just RMA .	St
