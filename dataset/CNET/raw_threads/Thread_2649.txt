I've cloned all the data etc with Acronis to the new drive and hope to just swap out the old and install the new. Will the PC recognise the single drive or will I have to go into the BIOS and disable the raid set-up?

XP REPAIR INSTALL Vista REPAIR INSTALL Sadly with all the variations of raid chips and more the only answer is to try it and be ready to try the repair installs. Bob
