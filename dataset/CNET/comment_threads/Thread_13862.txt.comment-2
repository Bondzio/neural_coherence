You can run a program such as this to help delete all the temporary and junk files from the system.
They hide in many different places.
http://www.ccleaner.com/ You can back up any data, photos, music, etc.
to cdr., then delete it from your drive.
If you have a number of audio files in .wav format, convert them to mp3.
This will free up space on the drive.
The next option is to install a larger hard drive.
I saw a 80 gb at Best Buy last week for $39.99 after rebate.
