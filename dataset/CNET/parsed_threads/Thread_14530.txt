<s> I recently bought an eMachines T6410, and I'm quite impressed with the power, especially for the price, but I'm planning on adding a new video card ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814131420 ), and adding 1 gig of extra RAM. </s>
<s> Is the video card compatible (I'm pretty sure I have the PCI express x16 slot), and what kind of RAM should I look for? </s>
<s> Do I have to worry about static-electricity? </s>
<s> and people dont follow antistatic discharge basics neways...i would just suggest grounding urself by touching metal part of the case b4 installin the ram </s>
<s> Newegg.com good site for cheap memory. </s>
