I have a PNY Technologies Verto nVidia GeForce FX 5200 AGP 128mb DDR Graphics Card (which I got off a clearance table) Which I've installed into my IBM Intellistation 6866-40U with the latest Bios PFJT48AUS running Windows 2000 Pro The configuration program, (which has little documentation available) for CMOS setup on the Intellistation for video, asks about &quot;Active Video Memory&quot; and another question about &quot;Video Aperture&quot; I don't know what is meant by Video Aperture and can find no reference to it that makes sense on either IBMs or PNY's support websites.
I've tried a couple of configurations but CMOS recognizes the card as 4X instead of 8X (Close but not correct) as PNY Technologies has discontinued this card - I'm having difficulty locating the most current set of drivers for the graphics card - They do have a driver archive but that archive goes by version numbers - I'm unable to locate what the proper version I need for the most current driver set for this particular card beyond the disc that came with the card.
nVidia makes the chip set for the AGP card, but defers all support questions back to the card manufacturer.
