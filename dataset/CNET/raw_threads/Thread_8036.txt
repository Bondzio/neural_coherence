Just looking through the manual it repeatedly says you should not use both at the same time, but I have been using both so I can get two machines on the net, i.e 1 has the ethernet cable and the other has the USB, why is this not supposed to be allowed, both connections wor fine or will it cause a strain on the hardware?

The design doesn't include a NAT ROUTER that would be required to use more than one such interface. In closing, I'm sure you could plug it in, but it will not work. Let me share I will not detail why. Bob

Your DSL Modem does not have such a feature. If you want to share the internet connection, you learn about ICS at various web sites like www.wown.com or just go get a router. Bob

Proffitt	8/25/04 4:42 AM	1.09340892E12	Re: Modem	From an electrical standpoint the modem maker can't warrant the device because they can't control proper grounding of both PCs. If the electrical design isn't done to plug both in at the same time, then and if the PCs are not on the same ground then the modem will be damaged. This is unlikely, but when I write manuals I have to error on the side of caution. Is that what you needed to know? Bob
