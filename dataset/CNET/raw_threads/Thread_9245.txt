My desktop and PS3, surround sound etc is located in the home office. Here is my question... I have a cable modem and want to connect the PS3 online for updates, online gaming etc. Apparently I need a router. Any suggestions on which router to purchase? The desktop is close to where the tv and PS3 are located and the ethernet cable supplied with the PS3 is definitly long enough. I just dont know which one to purchase..there are so many different types. Any advise would be appreciated!!!

There are so many different types that Linksys offers. I was trying to narrow it down. Yes, I did check the Playstation 3 site and they do not have any recommendations as far as routers, just hooking up the system.
