While you maybe copying, you're really printing.
Too often the output can easily outstrip the basic makeup of anything in the $1000 range.
You're going to be working this to death.
Visit any copier/m-f printer and check the lifecycle specs or similar.
Further, if you do buy, that you seriously consider a &quot;service contract&quot; to be beyond any warranty period.
In fact, it maybe better to have double the devices in order not to overwork any one device.
Otherwise, expect to replace such in short period to be rid of persistant problems and/or carry &quot;maintenance kits&quot; to have on-hand for x-number(usage) periods to lessen typical problems.
Heaven forbid, you get into &quot;duplex&quot; demands.
