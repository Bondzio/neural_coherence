let's say i'm unsure what part it is.
and by unsure i mean close to 50-50, 60-40 chances.
how do i decide which part?
-&gt; i go by cost.
if i suspect the psu or the motherboard and am not at the shop with my oscilloscope then the psu is the choice hands down because it usually is half the price of the motherboard.
