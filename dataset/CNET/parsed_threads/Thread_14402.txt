<s> Im thinking of buying a new PC for myself. </s>
<s> The current one is a couple years old and not up to date. </s>
<s> I run alot of Multimedia programs on it that are fairly memory intensive. </s>
<s> For example; 3ds Max Flash Photoshop After Effects Director And other programs of web creation, animation, coding, and creative natures. </s>
<s> Im looking to spend...well nearly as much as it takes. </s>
<s> Up to around 2000$. </s>
<s> And there are some parts I already have like a monitor and speakers. </s>
<s> Id be willing to purchase a package if it was a good deal however. </s>
<s> There isnt going to be much gaming done on this, I have a 360 and Ive always been a console type of guy. </s>
<s> But there are inevitably going to be games on it. </s>
<s> Ive heard Macs are much more stable in terms of OS and other things. </s>
<s> Which would be better to run those types of programs? </s>
<s> Arent Macs also much more expensive? </s>
<s> Are there comprehensive warranties that cover these things that arent insanely expensive? </s>
<s> Sorry for the lengthy post but Im looking for a lot of information before I make a purchase this big. </s>
<s> Links to sites with information, cut and pasted material, links to sales. </s>
<s> Information on how much these programs need to be able to flex their relative muscles(3ds max)would be helpful too from anyone using them. </s>
<s> Should I or do I even need to spend that much money to get the most out of those programs? </s>
<s> Also, seeing the post under me, I could probably wait until X-Mas or a little after if the deals are going to save me THAT MUCH. </s>
<s> General resources.......I do not recommend these sites, there just places you might start your search. </s>
