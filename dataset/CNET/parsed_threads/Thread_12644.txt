<s> I have a WD external hard drive and when I went to plug in the USB cable into the device, the plug in slot pushed directly into the device. </s>
<s> I am not very literate when it comes to computers so could someone explain to me (in very simple terms) how I can get my photos off this device. </s>
<s> I am desperate to save my photos of my son and I don't want to do anything that may put them at risk. </s>
<s> PLEASE HELP. </s>
<s> THANK YOU! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> If not, take it to a shop and have them put the hard disk into a new case. </s>
<s> DIY type? </s>
<s> Open the case of the external drive, see if it's IDE or SATA connections and order a replacement case from newegg.com or other places. </s>

<s> Examples: http://www.google.com/products?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1T4ADBR_enUS258US258&q=USB+port+cards&um=1 By-the-way, usually there are ports for USBs in the front of the PC tower and the back of the tower on desktop PCs. </s>
<s> Sorry, this doesn't apply to laptops. </s>
<s> There are also USB extensions cords: http://www.google.com/products?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1T4ADBR_enUS258US258&q=USB+extension+cord&um=1 hummmmm, second of these in just a few days. </s>
<s> The broken port appears to be in the WD external hard drive. </s>
<s> If the USB was being plugged into the computer then a new USB port is needed. </s>
<s> I believe there is a cable that runs from the external drive to a USB port so if the port is screwed up then it must be on the computer. </s>
<s> This card will provide a new port without replacing the motherboard, for around $10.00. </s>
<s> Comprehend? </s>
<s> One of those days, Bob? </s>
<s> It's the other end at fault. </s>
<s> &quot;I have a WD external hard drive and when I went to plug in the USB cable into the device, the plug in slot pushed directly into the device.&quot; Your fix at the system end would work, but apparently it's at the device end, thus a new box. </s>
<s> Of course, if I could take it apart and check the innards, maybe the fix if not &quot;broken&quot; and slipped off or minor epoxy application to keep port at bay, all at the owners risk. </s>
<s> What? </s>
