Have you gone to http://www.newegg.com and looked at their monitors??
Your link said that they were out of stock.
I also make certain that the one that I buy has a three year warranty.
Here's a link to four pages of monitors.

Don't get confused when you note that the X inch Wide screen monitors are lower priced than the regular X inch monitors.
The wide Screens have considerably less viewing area, thus the basic screens are lower price.
