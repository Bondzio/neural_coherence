I've added a dvd+/- rw drive but the second drive is not shown on &lt;my computer&gt; or on the &lt;control panel&gt;. The drive powers up and the light comes on, the disk spins when I put it in the drive but it does not actually work. I've connected it as the primary drive and as the slave but with no difference. The Toshiba drive that came with the unit continues to function, even when connected as the slave drive. On bootup, if I set the slave as active, I get an error saying that it has not been found (pata error is drive is not recoginised - is this a software thing, or a time to boot up for the drive?), even though there is power running through the second drive. Searches with the new hardware wizard do nothing. Any ideas? regards mahogan2000@yahoo.com

A DVD or other? The lack of detail here hampers any meaningful dialogue. Bob
