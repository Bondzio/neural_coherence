You have to define what a firewall is first.
Your basic NAT ROUTER is a firewall if you write that unsolicited packets don't make it to the machines behind the stock configured NAT ROUTER.
Others will only call it a firewall if it has &quot;stateful inspection&quot;.
But for all the worms that we've seen, all the routers in their stock configuration would have kept the machine safe.
