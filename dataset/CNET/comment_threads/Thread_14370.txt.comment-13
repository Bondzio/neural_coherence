I know very little about computers, but a friend of mine does and he installed another stick of memory on my now old computer (Win98se)and it wasn't recognizing it.
He found that the mother board was warped and the memory wasn't making good contact.
A rubber band was a temp fix for the problem till we got a new mother board 2 days later.
Problem solved with the new motherboard that wasn't warped.
