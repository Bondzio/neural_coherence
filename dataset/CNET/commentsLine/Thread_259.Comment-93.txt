ann, for your information [fyi], i just spent the past hour or so reading this entire thread and felt impelled to write after just the first few posts.
however, i knew i would have to read the entire thread as not to repeat anything or cause any more grief because i was already &quot;behind the times.&quot; i have been behind in my e-mails and have recently been trying to catch up and, in my attempts to catch up, have come across this thread.
i see it has been about ten (10) days since the last post, which wasn't even yours, so i wonder if maybe you have resolved the issue.

fyi, i have never followed a complete thread on any cnet forum but i am far from being considered a &quot;newbie.&quot; i have my experiences in the computer field and have an associates degree to prove it.
i'll try to keep this short and finish by saying i have tracked this thread and will attempt to offer any insights i have if you should resume posting about your issue.
best of luck!
