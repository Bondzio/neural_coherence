hello everyone, i'm going to buy a tablet soon but i just don't know wich one to choose.
my budget is around 500 dollars.
things that are important to me are a large memory (expendable via micro sd works for me too), a fast device, absolutely zero lag, a great screen and great looks.
at first i was thinking to buy the apple ipad mini 64 gb or the ipad 4 32 gb.
please help me out, thanks
