<s> I have a 1st gen iMac with an Airport Express. </s>
<s> When I am downloading or streaming, everything is fine. </s>
<s> However lately, I have been experiencing a major lag for a web page to come up. </s>
<s> If I click on a link or type in a URL, it take more than 10 seconds before the page even changes. </s>
<s> Sometimes it takes much longer. </s>
<s> It's as if the server is taking forever to respond but it happens with every site and it doesn't happen on my network at the office. </s>
<s> Anyone have any clues? </s>
<s> And the first question you'll get is to identify the Mac, how much ram and what OS. </s>
<s> Be sure to post that there. </s>
<s> It's a 2 GHz Intel Core Duo with 1.5 GB RAM running OS 10.5.5. </s>
