If I have wireless broadband internet by using a PC card (Sony Ericsson GC83 or Sierra Wireless AirCard 775, etc.
)in my desktop, can I set up a home network so that I can use the internet wirelessly on my laptop?
The laptop has a built-in network card already.
How can I set up the network?
Windows XP is on both computers.
Thanks for your help.
