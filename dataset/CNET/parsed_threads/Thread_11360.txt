<s> I'm putting together my first pc pretty soon, and am trying to figure out which type of processor to go for. </s>
<s> I'm not looking for top of the line gaming monster, but I am trying to build a solid machine that will keep me playing new games (Fallout 3, Prince of Persia, Left 4 Dead, etc) for a couple years. </s>
<s> So I'm trying to decide, should I go with a tried and true dual core processor such as the Intel core 2 duo 3.16 ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115036 ) or perhaps one of the newer quad cores with a lower clock speed? </s>
<s> I'm a little hesitant since recommended gaming specs are already hitting 2.6ghz, which will be my starting speed if not less if I go with a quad core. </s>
<s> But will the extra cores make the difference? </s>
<s> Also, I'm going with Intel on this one just because it's familiar and I'd prefer to stay on fairly stable ground for my first build. </s>
<s> Just saying. </s>
<s> Advice appreciated. </s>
<s> If anyone has any more comments on my box as a whole (also debating graphics card) you're more than welcome to check over the tentative parts list: http://secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx?WishListNumber=9427232 . </s>
<s> But the area that gamer machines need the most work is the video card. </s>
<s> Without reservation I'd get any 2+GHz Core 2 Duo or higher, 2 or 4GB RAM and then pour the rest of the bugdet to get the best video card for the money from this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2064.html Having more cores does help, but that is not where you find your gaming machine to need the most help. </s>

<s> Hi Aegis, I would go for quad core as it may be happen that the future game would not be compatible for dual core but compatible for quad core. </s>
<s> Gaming will eventually move to multicore optimization. </s>
<s> As of now we are going to witness a shift from the LGA 775 platform to the LGA 1366 platform from Intel. </s>
<s> So for a system that is futureproof for 2-3 years a quad core will be good but too expensive (the QX series 9650&9770 are very fast but still do not justify their prices which are around $700-1000). </s>
<s> A fast Core2Duo is a good option for about a year or 2. </s>
<s> The RAM should be 4GB then gaming under Vista will not be an issue. </s>
<s> Similarly the Graphics card is equally important, your choice of the GTX 260 is good. </s>
<s> If you're thinking of SLI I'd suggest you go for a higher PSU say 800W. </s>
<s> DDR3 system memory is still too costly to be an option </s>
<s> Thanks, that's pretty much the lines upon which I'm thinking now. </s>
<s> I'm going to pick up an e8500, which should last me a while, especially if I decide to overclock. </s>
<s> In a year or two when quad cores are cheaper and have higher clock speed, I'll switch over to one of those. </s>
<s> As far as i7 / non LGA775 goes, well, that'll have to wait until my next build. </s>
<s> Especially since I'm definitely not messing with that DDR3 ram yet. </s>
