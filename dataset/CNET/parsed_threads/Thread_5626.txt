<s> Presario 5000 Desktop, purchased in late 2000. </s>
<s> 1 GB processor, 128 mb ram,40 GB hard drive running Windows 2000 professional. </s>
<s> Floppy/CD/CD-DVD drives. </s>
<s> It came from Compaq with Windows ME which was unstable at best - I had assumed most of my locking issues were tied to ME, so I upgraded to Windows 2000. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The computer will randomly not boot properly - it will ping the CD and DVD, miss the floppy, start the hard drive and then stall leaving a blank screen even though the hard drive LED is illuminates green, starts, then goes out. </s>
<s> If I start it repeatedly by turning the power button on, it will eventually boot up, or stall in the process. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Once operating after a succesful boot, the computer will lock randomly even when sitting idle at the desktop screen with no programs open. </s>
<s> It also locks randomly with open programs. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> I notice that sometimes when it locks, the fan whine seems to slow and then come back up to speed. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> I have to manually power it down by holding power button in, and restart with power button, only to experience problem number 1, intermittent boot success. </s>
<s> Is there a known issue out there with the Presario desktops - could it be the power supply or CMOS battery, or is it likely software related? </s>
<s> Help! </s>

<s> In loading W2K, did you also go to Compaq (ne. </s>
<s> HP) and download the latest drivers, especially BIOS for W2K. </s>
<s> If the W2K was not supplied by COMPAQ, you cannot rely on Microsoft alone to support your system. </s>
<s> Just loading W2K and driver updates will not always do the trick. </s>
<s> My experience with Compaq Workstations, Armad laptops and a Presario or two. </s>
<s> I use W2K and have almost always had to get something from the Compaq/HP driver/software downloads. </s>
<s> Remove the case cover and see if the cooler air helps. </s>
<s> What they didn't tell you is that FANs blow air onto the heatsink and not unlike the LINT BASKET on a clothes dryer, it can build up an insulating blanket which causes the CPU to overheat. </s>
<s> Or the CPU FAN has failed? </s>
<s> You need to look. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Fans are operating. </s>
<s> Case cover on or off - no difference in performance. </s>
<s> Processor, fan and heat sink are clean - removed lint and cleaned when the problem started. </s>
<s> It can change the response to ask to look in another direction. </s>
<s> For instance, tell what you do about PARASITES. </s>
<s> Light reading at http://www.doxdesk.com/parasite/ Bob </s>
<s> Thanks Bob - Parasites are certainly a possibility and I did read the info you provided to another post. </s>
<s> I was experiencing hijacks on the web, etc. </s>
<s> but thought I had cleaned them well enough and protected my machine. </s>
<s> I now use Stopzilla as a pop up blocker which seems to work very well. </s>
<s> Could a parasite be causing random locks and improper boots repeatedly - and why would the machine boot properly one time and not the next on power up? </s>
<s> Could it be that simple - blasted parasites and hijack code? </s>
<s> Great idea - where do I find the updated BIOS on the site? </s>
<s> I have been to compaq.com and the download files are very limited. </s>
<s> Can you point me in the right direction? </s>
<s> It's a common issue, but many don't like that we have to scan and remove the pests with some 5 tools. </s>
<s> Some want a single piece of software to fix it. </s>
<s> Sorry, we don't have that technology yet (unless it's Linux?) </s>
<s> The short list is: Adaware, Spybot, Cwshredder, Housecall and BHODEMON. </s>
<s> BHODEMON appeared a short while ago and I've found it usefull to list the BHOs and to remove the ones I don't want. </s>
<s> Another issue is Internet Explorer. </s>
<s> Doxdesk explains it's danger. </s>
<s> It's such an issue that I advise to use any other non-IE browser when possible. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks again - I will clean the machine again using the suggested tools and see if it makes a difference. </s>
<s> Any direct known issues with AOL Instant Messenger and spyware/corrupting files? </s>
<s> To avoid the AIM issues, look up GAIM. </s>
<s> Open source, free and without the ads. </s>

<s> It should list by category, including bios updates. </s>
<s> Good luck </s>
