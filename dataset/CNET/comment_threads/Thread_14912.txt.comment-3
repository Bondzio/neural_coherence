Thanks, I'll go talk to my brother about the CD's because I bought it from his old boss a while back and like I said earlier, I'm not to Tech savvy when it comes to computers.
I'm sure the guy I bought it from will have the CD's somewhere.
If not I'll get him to maybe try reinstalling XP on ym computer.
Thanks again, B. Hoffman
