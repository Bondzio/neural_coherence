Frankly why make their network your problem. I've done this before and supply a complimentary internet access but never solve their network issues. If those companies want their own LANs then tell them to make their own. Bob

I have an additional 9 offices to manage and I definitely think it will be in my best interest to let them run their own inner-office cabling and wiring. Seems like a bit of a headache to tackle this on the tenants behalf. THanks R Proffitt
