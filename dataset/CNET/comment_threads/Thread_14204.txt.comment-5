It's very good that you keep programs in one place, but it's not enough.
For sure you need to make system partition backup .
This file will contain OS and all your apps configurations with roads to them.
You'll get an exact image of your C drive, keep it on F, also copy to CD (due to compression it takes not much space).
And if your OS suddenly crash, you could immediately restore it.
As for me, I always use this method to keep and protect data.
