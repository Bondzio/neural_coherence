1.1.1	after i upgraded my inspiron 1100 mem from 256 to 640 i noticed when i ran a defrag.that my free space on my hard drive went down 2 % . , any reason and is this normal	St
1.2.1	Windows will tend to adjust the size of the swap file using it 's own formula ... which does not make much sense to me .	St
1.2.2	I believe it makes the file 1 1/2 times larger than physical RAM .	St
1.2.3	It would seem that more physical RAM should reduce the size needed for virtual memory use .	St
1.2.4	Maybe someone here knows why this happens .	St
1.3.1	i am using winxp home ie 6.0	St
1.4.1	Set your Tools/Folder options/View to display hidden and system files if you have not already done so .	St
1.4.2	Look in the root folder of your boot drive ( usually C : but not always with XP ) .	St
1.4.3	Look for a file called & quot ; Pagefile.sys & quot ; and not its size .	St
1.4.4	Now shut down and remove one stick of RAM .	St
1.4.5	Reboot and see if the pagefile gets smaller .	St
1.4.6	If so , that 's probably where your space went .	St
1.5.1	Displaying hidden/system files will allow you to see how much space your system restore folder occupies as well .	St
1.5.2	Setting restore points decreases disk size but if you do n't have your system set to display & quot ; System Volume Information & quot ; , it will show no space used .	St
1.6.1	step by step please , how is this done	St
1.7.1	step by step please	Sug
1.8.1	You say you upgraded your RAM .	St
1.8.2	Did you do this yourself ?	Ques
1.8.3	If not , and you are not comfortable with opening your case and removing a module , the step by step instruction will not help you .	St
1.8.4	But , you can do this .	St
1.8.5	As I said , allow display of system and hidden files .	St
1.8.6	Here 's how .	St
1.8.7	From the desktop , click on & quot ; My Computer & quot ; .	St
1.8.8	Go to Tools/Folder Options/View .	St
1.8.9	Check the option to show hidden files and folders and uncheck one that says t to hide protected operating system files .	St
1.8.10	Click OK and exit .	St
1.8.11	Now , go to your boot drive which is usually C : and click on that .	St
1.8.12	You should see a file called & quot ; pagefile.sys & quot ; .	St
1.8.13	It will display the size in kilobytes .	St
1.8.14	Write down that number and note if it 's approximately 1 1/2 time the amount of RAM you have .	St
1.8.15	I 'll guess about 115000kb but it wo n't be exact .	St
1.8.16	Now , if you remove one of your RAM modules ( power off of course ) and recheck the size of the pagefile , you may find it to be smaller by a similar ratio to the math you just performed .	St
1.8.17	What this means is that , when you added RAM , Windows expanded the size of this file .	St
1.8.18	I 'll guess it to be about 3/4 of a gig smaller now .	St
1.8.19	Hope this makes some sense .	St
1.9.1	i have a dell inspiron 1100 upgraded ram from 256 to 640 only two slots so removed 128 installed 512 .	St
1.10.1	It means you 're not that much of a newbie .	St
1.10.2	I tried to offer a reason why adding memory would lessen your available hard drive space .	St
1.10.3	You 're free to validate or invalidate that as a reason so the rest is up to you .	St
1.10.4	Good luck .	Polite
