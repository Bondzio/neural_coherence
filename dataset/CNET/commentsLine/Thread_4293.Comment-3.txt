if the systems have only soot or smoke damage, the hds themselves are pretty robust as they're sealed against the outside world.
get a working system with some type of back-up, install the hds as a 2nd hd.
the working system should contain the same os for ease of use and retrieve the data that way.
however, extreme heat is a bad thing is so found, you have slim chance on your own, decide on a professional service or not.
to clean the system themselves to need to blow them out &quot;easily&quot; not a super charged blower as that can cause ionized charge to develope.
use a hand blower like those found at camera shops.
with disassembled system, immerse the mtrbd.
with any removable chips(ram, cpu, and bios, use esd care), and wash in denatured alcohol or 90% rubbing alcohol.
do not use a true solvent for cleaning.
blow dry abit and allow to air dry.
pitch the power supply unless you want to take a chance.
the fd should be pitched as well.
the kybd, monitor, etc.
is an eyeball thing, check but if in thought, pitch them.
a short or something along those lines will be more costly than a simple replacement.
i repeat take the hds out and use a known good system to retrieve data to back-up that data.
once data is safe, you can then rebuild the old systems.
if this is too much to do, then what is your data worth???
no short cuts... tada -----willy
