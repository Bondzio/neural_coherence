i have just bought a ricoh africo ap4510.
it will not print.
it is online.
the cables are correctly plugged in.
the power supply is on.
i send a page to print and nothing happens and it comes up printer error.
even a test page will not print from my computer.
i have connected it through the lpt1 port.
does anyone know what i am doing wrong.
do i need to clear out some registers or other stuff on my computer.
the computer tells me the lpt1 port is working and ok. please help i've spent hours on this.
