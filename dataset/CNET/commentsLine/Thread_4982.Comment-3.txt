the chances it was damaged are probably very small.
i don't know if there is any place that would test it for you.
if you know someone with a pc that can use the memory willing to let you borrow the pc for a few hours to test the ram, you could do it that way.
to test ram, get a program called memtest86.
available at  i believe.
it is free, and you put it on a cd or floppy and the system boots directly into it and begins testing your ram.
leave it running for at least a couple passes, and a full pass might take awhile depending on the speed of the pc.
if there are errors, memtest86 will find them.
