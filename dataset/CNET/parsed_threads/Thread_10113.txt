<s> Put the recorder on your router into the router's DMZ. </s>
<s> This is not going to be explained much further because networking is a rather deep subject. </s>
<s> If you can't find the DMZ, please obtain on site support. </s>

<s> Hi. </s>
<s> Please provide the following details: 1 Routers model number 2 Cameras model number - you have provided the recorders model number, which is enough under certain circumstances. </s>
<s> 3 I require these so that I can let you set up the router for port forwarding which will allow you to access the camera from a remote location. </s>
