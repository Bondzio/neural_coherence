Hi: I just joined this forum but like to think I have helped out on others.
It seems that your drivers are incorrect and/or the hardware is not compatible with your OS.
What OS are you using?
Have you tried to update the driver directly from Device Manager?
If you bought the modem new it should have come with a driver disk.
