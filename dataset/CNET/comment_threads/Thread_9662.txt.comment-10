For the upgrade you can put up to 4gb in a machine with a 32 bit op/sys.
You will only get to use about 3.5gb as you will lose the .5 gig for the video and other hardware cards and cache .
But possibly more importantly you will probably lose Vista as it will fail to reboot as it will consider itself in a new machine and demand you buy it again.
So now you can buy the 64 bit version.
Then you will find it does not work as half your hardware will be unsupported by Vista and the other half will not have a working manufacturer's driver available.
So you see its now a race.
Will Vista 32 bit become so big with all the shambolic code errors that it will not run even within its own maximum address space or will 64 bit collapse in a useless heap as a result of no drivers.
My guess is dead heat and Vista will be canned altogether, As was Millennium
