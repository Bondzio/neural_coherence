hi jose, integrated graphics have come a long way in recent years and for general pc work, they are just fine.
for the modern generation of games with very realistic graphics, they won't do the job, requiring you either to reduce the resolution or slow the frame rate, neither of which is acceptable really.
all is not lost, though, providing the motherboard has at least one and maybe two pcie x16 slots available, you can upgrade your graphics with a dedicated card when your budget allows.
you didn't say which system you have in mind, so check whether the expansion slots i mentioned are available.
you might also want to bear in mind that many of the current crop of more advanced ganes have been written to take advantage of multicore processor chips now available - intel have some very impressive demonstrations comparing rendering speeds of his res graphics with 1, 2 and 4 processors.
how many cores does your proposed system have?
what this amounts to is that modern gaming is a rather specialized use of a pc and a general purpose pc will be unlikely to deliver that specialized performance.
if you are (or want to be) a heavy gamer, you might be better off going for a machine built for the purpose (or build your own).
the downside is that they don't come cheap!
good luck!
