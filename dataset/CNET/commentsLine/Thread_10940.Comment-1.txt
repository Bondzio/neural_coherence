recently i bought a new syste which i asembled myself and after the reboot from installing the video card drivers, the screen remains blank and the monitor loses its signal from the computer.
i thinbk that this might be some sort of driver conflict but am not sure.
can anyone offer some advice as how to fix is problem?
p.s.
i am currently running the defult vga drivers.
thanx, cameron
