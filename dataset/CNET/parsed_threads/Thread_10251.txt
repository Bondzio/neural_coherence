<s> A generic one will not work. </s>

<s> All They have is generic ones. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Some 1,000 fans there. </s>
<s> In closing, you might never find the exact fan. </s>
<s> I mount close enough all the time with custom mounting plates. </s>

<s> Thanks for your time and help. </s>
<s> I am going to get the generic fan and try to install it. </s>
<s> You would think that Nvidia would have a way to buy a replacement fan for there cards. </s>

<s> http://www.technologyvault.co.uk/geforce/faq.php?display=faq&nr=21&catnr=2&prog=gef&lang=en There are replacement coolers out there for some of the GeForce cards. </s>
<s> My mind didn't think to look beyond the sources I use to solve this issue. </s>
<s> For the people I deal with will not part with the money for a tennmax cooler so I just use generic fans. </s>
<s> However I always get a ball bearing fan if I think the card/system will need to be used for more than a few months. </s>
<s> Hint: Exacto blade knives, tin snips, plastic nuts, bolts and even plastic cable ties all make for great source material and tools to fashion a new fan mount. </s>
<s> Sometimes I have to take up space that blocks the adjacent PCI slot, but what other choice do we have? </s>
<s> At least at this price... Bob </s>
