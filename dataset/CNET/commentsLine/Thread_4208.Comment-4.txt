that would no doubt cost less than a new mobo.
and i apologize to everyone -- i had forgotten i posted this question earlier this month, and posted it again a couple of days ago (they say the memory -- mine, not the pc's -- is the first to go!).
in the meantime, i've found out my bios are uptodate, as well as all my drivers.
