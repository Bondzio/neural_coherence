Hey, I had got a Meritline RIST watch sometime around march'05 with 256MB of data storage on its inbuilt USB drive.
I've formatted it with a secure (password-protected) partition and a non-password-protected partition.
It had been working fine since yesterday.
I was transferring some files from the watch to my PC, deleting those files from the watch, adding files to the secure partition...Suddenly, when I tried to delete or copy anything on the watch, it showed the message that &quot;The disk is write-protected.
Remove the write protection or use another disk.&quot; I can still copy data from the watch to my PC, but cannot modify the contents on the watch.
For the reason of being write-protected, I'm not even able to format the USB drive.
Please Help!!
