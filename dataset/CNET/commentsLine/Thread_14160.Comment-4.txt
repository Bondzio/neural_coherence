while you're at it take a look inside the box and see what brand of hard drive you have.
if you have a custom built computer with a good hard drive it may have a 3 year warranty on it and manufacturers such as western digital will have the warranty expiration date for the drive you have on file.
all you have to do is go online and tell them the serial number.
if you have a el-cheapo pc like the ones they sell at large retail stores you will probably be out of luck.
good luck
