the reason i ask is you want to make sure it's not an unresponsive pc and not just the keyboard.
if just the keyboard, you replace it...plain and simple.
sticky keys on membrane types can do all sorts of weird things.
but, if the mouse still works, the pc is probably not hung and a replacement keyboard is the obvious choice.
