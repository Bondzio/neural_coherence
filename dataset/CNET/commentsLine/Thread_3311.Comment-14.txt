be aware that a number of motherboeard no longer come with a game port.
if you have a large investment in game controllers that use the gameport and does not work with usb-to-gameport adapters (some microsoft sidewinder products) you will need extra hardware (soundcard with gameport).
msi does not support the game port on their motherboards, while a number other brands do have support.
few have the actual connector (db-15) on the backplane, most have a header so you easily can add the db-15 connector.
as for processor i would go for socket 939 and 1-2 gb of ram - and buy the fastest amd processor i could get for the remaining dollars after adding the other components like video card (probably go for pci express).
the reason for putting most money in the other components except the processor is that the falling prices for processors make it more attractive to upgrade in a year or two compared to other components (possibly exepting the video card - therefore i would choose a board with pci express) jeff
