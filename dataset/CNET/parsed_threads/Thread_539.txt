<s> I have a typcal cable modem with a Belkin pre N wireless router, a main desktop, another desktop, both wired, two laptops linked wirelessly, and two identical desktops linked wirelessley. </s>
<s> I cannot get one of the wireless desktops to pick up an IP address. </s>
<s> I get the default address and the limitied connectivity warning when trying to connect. </s>
<s> I have switched everything between the two pcs with the same result (endlessly). </s>
<s> I have the MAC address specified in the router, auto IP config and WPA set. </s>
<s> There is no firewall on the pc atthe moment. </s>
<s> Out of patience!! </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> My router's firmware was old and my new laptop would not connect. </s>
<s> It appears that having other working laptops is not a valid test that the firmware is good. </s>
<s> Also I'm running into the SSID disabled issue too much now. </s>
<s> I leave it to others to figure out why SSID must be enabled for some laptops to connect. </s>
