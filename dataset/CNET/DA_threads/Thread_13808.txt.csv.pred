1.1.1	I recently installed an Apple AirPort Express wireless base station to use with my Apple iBook G3 .	St
1.1.2	I hooked the AirPort station to my RoadRunner cable modem , and it works great .	St
1.1.3	But I ca n't keep my Dell desktop connected to the modem simultaneously .	St
1.1.4	It 's either the AirPort or the Dell .	St
1.1.5	The one suggestion that was offered was to purchase a wireless card for the Dell and thus access the AirPort station with both my Apple laptop and my Dell Dimension 2100 .	St
1.1.6	Can anyone ( 1 ) verify this proposed solution , and ( 2 ) tell me what kind of wireless card I need to purchase ?	Ques
1.1.7	The Dell in question is a Dell Dimension 2100 desktop PC with an Intel Celeron running Windows ME .	St

1.2.1	maybe you want to say either Ibook or dell ... try to configured the airport express and the router ... check your IP address and IP address range.. ( maybe it only allowed for 1 IP address ) try to disabled dhcp on the Airport Express or try to use manual configuration on the airport express assistant .	Sug
1.2.2	I assumed that you also have ethernet ...	St
1.2.3	Try to bridge your wireless and the ethernet ... on Dell .	St
1.3.1	The Airport Express has only one ethernet jack on it for input from a source ; it is an access point only .	St
1.3.2	Thus , the ethernet cable from his cable modem can be connected to his desktop system - which means no wireless to the iBook via the Airport Express ; or that same cable can be connected to the Airport Express - which leaves the wired Dell desktop system out in the cold .	St
1.3.3	Although the Airport Express is a very robust little device in terms of feature set , there is n't much physical connectivity to it .	St
1.3.4	My recommendation : Get a simple broadband router w/4-port switch .	St
1.3.5	They can be had for $ 20-30 these days .	St
1.3.6	Put it first after the cable modem .	St
1.3.7	Set it to do the necessary DHCP .	St
1.3.8	Connect your Dell to the broadband router through one of its LAN ports .	St
1.3.9	Connect the Airport Express to another of the LAN ports on the router .	St
1.3.10	Turn off DHCP in the Airport Express and make it a & quot ; dumb & quot ; access point only - your iBook will receive its LAN IP address from the router , but passed through the wireless link of the Airport .	St
1.3.11	Be sure to secure the Airport so no other passers-by can log into your network .	St
1.3.12	If you want to install a PCI WiFi card or a USB WiFi device in your Dell desktop , that would be my distant second choice .	St
1.3.13	I 'm partial to the Buffalo line of equipment , but others may have different preferences .	St
1.3.14	However , when you have a wireless network and something funky happens , it is nice to have a wired system that you can use to troubleshoot and reconfigure ; if all client systems are wireless , nothing will be able to reach the access point to troubleshoot it .	St
1.3.15	IMO , if a particular system , such as your Dell , is not mobile and being moved around alot , the only reason to go wireless with it is because you ca n't run a physical wire between your cable modem and the system or are offended by the sight/thought of visible wires in the room .	St
1.3.16	You already have a wire from the cable modem to your system , so presumably you 've gotten over the putative ugliness .	St
