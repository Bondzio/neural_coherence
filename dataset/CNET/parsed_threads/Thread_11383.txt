<s> Hi guys, Need advice on whether or not I should upgrade my rig. </s>
<s> It has served me well for the past 3.5 years. </s>
<s> I plan to upgrade the following components as my 670 gtx is perfectly fine: i7 920 ===&gt; i5 3570k ASUS P6T ===&gt; ASUS P8Z77-V PRO Windows 7 premium 64 ===&gt; Windows 8 Do you think there is a need right now if my primary purpose is gaming (Planetside 2 for example)? </s>
<s> My i7 920 is stock and overclocking on air is not an option where I live especially during summer. </s>
<s> I think your going to spend a bunch of bucks and not get much. </s>
<s> 920&gt;3570......there will be a bump in cpu perf....as to how that will xlate to some game.....unknown. </s>
<s> I doubt it will much. </s>
<s> W7&gt;W8......No......Let the dust settle with W8. </s>
<s> Get enough ram that the swap file stays quiet while your gaming. </s>
<s> If your games are hammering your HD for data......think about a SSD or a hybrid. </s>
<s> &quot;Our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 LGA 1155 Core i5-2500K and a $1000 LGA 2011 Core i7-3960X, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved. </s>
<s> It turns out that memory bandwidth and PCIe throughput don't hold back the performance of existing Sandy Bridge-based machines. </s>
<s> &quot; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-cpu-review-overclock,3106-4.html A long time ago tests changing motherboards yielded single digit performance changes. </s>
<s> Rarely pays off. </s>
<s> The same thing with OS changes but 7 does have an edge on compatibility for now. </s>
