I did not get what you said on your last posting, lol.
Care to explain?
So I got a new 200HD and having it installed and loaded up and running for $211 plus it cost me $24 to get HP's recovery cd - not bad, right?
Another thing - how do you back up your files, pictures, etc?
Just like burning it on to a cd?
Thanks!
