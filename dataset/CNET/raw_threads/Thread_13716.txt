I would like to be able to access the internet from my laptop (which is wifi enabled)anywhere in the house. All the manuals indicate that once the modem is connected to the router, I need to connect the router to my laptop using an ethernet cable. My laptop therefore has to be connected to the wireless router with an ethernet cable, which doesn't seem very wireless to me! Could someone please let me know how I can have the modem and router in one room, and access the internet from my laptop in another room? A friend of mine can do this with his Mac Setup (a Mac laptop and Airport Extreme modem/router).

Once that's done it will run fine without the connection. I wonder how you would get the internet without a network since the internet is a network. Bob

Mine works perfectly. Did the router come with any instructions? Have you installed it properly? Have you contacted Linksys? But do not attempt any router maintenance wireless, use the cord. Set everything up wired, then unplug and go wireless.

If you would read your instructions... You connect your computer {via ethernet} to the router to perform the setup. Then you disconnect the computer (laptop) and connect the router to your modem. Enable your wireless adapter on your laptop, and you are good to go. Note: If it still doesn't work correctly, try a complete power cycle. 1)power off computer, power off router, power off modem. ---Leave off for at least 30 sec.--- 2) power on modem, power on router, power on computer. Just so you know: That is a network.

Sound like you have a problem. He's asking a question ''expert'' and really doesn't need your -1cent. Do you know what a phone is? Answer that.
