i was just hoping there might be a cheap and simple piece of kit which might achieve what i'm after.
i've done some research and haven't found anything - hence my question.
i realise that if it ends up costing the same as a media streaming box then it would be pointless!
has anyone found a set-up which does this simply and cheaply?
