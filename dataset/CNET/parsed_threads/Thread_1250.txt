<s> Hi I have a very strange problem and cannot work out what is causing it. </s>
<s> So I really need some help. </s>
<s> We have a wifi network @ our school where 7 wifi access points are via CAT5 cable connected to a 8 port switch and then to a wifi ADSL modem. </s>
<s> Every now and then we loose all connections for no reason at all. </s>
<s> 3to4 times a week. </s>
<s> All other times it works perfectly. </s>
<s> Each wifi AP has its own fixed IP addr and I have no problem connecting to the AP but the AP cannot ping the Modem. </s>
<s> Nor can I ping the modem if I connect directly to the wifi modem. </s>
<s> I have to reboot the adsl modem and all the wifi AP from the switch, turn of all AP's and wait for the modem to reboot. </s>
<s> Now I have to connect each cable one by one back into the switch and one by one turn the AP back on. </s>
<s> Then all is fine again. </s>
<s> I have replaced the switch but no difference. </s>
<s> PLEASE PLEASE HELP </s>
<s> What is the make and model of the modem? </s>
<s> This sounds like a periodic failure of the modem. </s>
<s> Does it have a built-in router? </s>
<s> Have you tried replacing it? </s>
<s> It is a TP-link wireless 4 port ADSL modem. </s>
<s> Its only 3 month old and is protected by a UPS. </s>
<s> Without the model number, I can only guess that it has a router built in since you describe it as having 4 ports. </s>
<s> This still sounds like a possible problem with this modem/router. </s>
<s> Have you checked for firmware updates for the modem? </s>
<s> Are the AP addresses outside of the range of DHCP? </s>
<s> Do you get any specific network errors on client PCs? </s>
<s> If the network IP addresses are configured properly and firmware is updated with no resolution, you may want to pursue a replacement modem of a different make and model. </s>
