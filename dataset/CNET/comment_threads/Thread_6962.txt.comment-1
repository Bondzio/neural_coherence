I have a dlink WBR1310 and HP Laptop with Windows Vista.
The available options on the WBR1310 are: WEP WPA-Personal Wireless Security (enhanced) WPA2-Wireless Security (enhanced) WPA-Auto Wireless Security(enhanced) The available options on my laptop are: WPA Personal WPA2 Personal WPA Enterprise WPA2 Enterprise As you can see, not everything is the same.
What combination should be used.
Also, should enable hidden wireless be checked on the router.
I have had my laptop and router for several years.
But lately I am having to unplug everyday to get connected.
That's why I'm seeking help.
