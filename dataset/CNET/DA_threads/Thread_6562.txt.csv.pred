1.1.1	Hey everyone , I 've just purchased a new Inspiron E1705 with the Intel PRO/Wireless 3945a/g card , and I 'm going to have Comcast as my provider .	St
1.1.2	I 've read through the CNET and user reviews for both extensively , as well as a few other reviews on the web .	St
1.1.3	I 've done as much research as my brain can handle , and I think I 've narrowed my router choices down to these two .	St
1.1.4	Range is no issue right now , but I 'll probably be moving to a larger house next year .	St
1.1.5	I do plan on downloading files which can run several gigs .	St
1.1.6	I 'll probably do some online gaming , although I 'm not really a hardcore gamer .	St
1.1.7	I 'd like to eventually upgrade to n wireless once the technology stabilizes .	St
1.1.8	Also , for now , just the laptop will be on the network , although I might add devices to it later .	St
1.1.9	My only other concern right now is price , but if the Pre-N is worth the extra , I have no problem making that investment .	St
1.1.10	Does anyone have any recommendations about the pros and cons of each of these routers ?	Ques
1.1.11	Thanks in advance for your time !	St
1.2.1	Based on your current needs I would go with the G model with MIMO .	St
1.2.2	Here 's why : 1 . )	St
1.2.3	Your current laptop can not use the pre-N capabilities .	Sug
1.2.4	2 . )	St
1.2.5	Since this is Pre-N ( in other words the standard has not yet been established ) why not wait for the Real N to debut and know that you have the standard , not just someones interpretation of the standard ?	Ques
1.2.6	Of course that 's just my opinion , I could be wrong .	St
1.3.1	I think I need some clarification then .	St
1.3.2	In the review , it was stated that the Pre-N router is compatible with b and g : & quot ; Belkin 's router is compatible with standard 802.11g and 802.11b gear for now , but in order for you to reap the router 's full performance benefits , you 'll need to use it in combination with Belkin 's Pre-N PC Card adapter. & quot ; Am I misinterpreting this ?	Ques
1.4.1	you can not take advantage of the Pre N Standard without having a compatible Pre N card for the laptop , as such you are purchasing a standard , Pre N , that is useless .	St
1.4.2	So , why not wait till the & quot ; real N & quot ; debuts and get the proper standard , not just someones interpretation of the standard ?	Sug
1.4.3	You can buy a cheap G class router for about 30 bucks and use it with the notebook .	St
1.4.4	Then , when real N debuts and you get your & quot ; other & quot ; system you can upgrade knowing that you have a defined standard that can be used by almost any card/router combination .	St
1.4.5	As it stands now , you will have to use all of one manufacturer 's card/router combination , forcing you to lock in with one company .	St
1.4.6	What happens if the card or router go bad say eighteen months down the road ?	Ques
1.4.7	You may not be able to find that exact make/model that you have locked yourself into forcing a complete new setup .	St
1.4.8	There are just too many unknowns to lock yourself in this way in my opinion .	St
1.4.9	Gosh I hope all this makes sense .	St
1.5.1	It does make sense .	St
1.5.2	I see what you 're saying about waiting on a true standard .	St
1.5.3	Thanks for you help !	St
