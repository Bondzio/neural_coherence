Brandon: Did you ever get an answer to this question.
I have searched high and low for the same capability, but all the cell phone makers and specialty stores give you a blank look.
Surely, you and I are not the only geniuses on the planet?!
Even with a blue-tooth enabled phone (mine a Motorola V551) and blue-tooth pcoket-PC, I still need to go through an external modem to connect to an ISP.
I would be interested in an update (dropbox999 at hotmail dot com) thanks.
