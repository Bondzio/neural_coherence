sound like you are doing the right things with your research.
i am a grandma with 2 sons who work at microsoft.
they build their home computers themselves, and can often request the specs for computers they use at work.
they use amd processors at home...athlon, currently...and advise me to do the same.
my impression from talking to them is that pentiums are fine, but certainly not worth any extra cost vs. the athlon.
i have a 3-yr-old athlon xp 2500 and a 5-yr-old pentium iii.
the athlon is fine for photo editing and working with dvds.
just make sure you have enough memory.
looking for a new computer, i would look at athlons first, but consider price in the final determination.
