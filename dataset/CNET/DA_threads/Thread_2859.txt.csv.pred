1.1.1	I desperately need a new computer , and it should be suited for AutoCAD , 3D MAx , Photoshop and other graphics software .	St
1.1.2	Does anyone have any advice ?	Ques
1.1.3	I have not decided wheter to buy a finished computer , or build one .	St
1.1.4	I am grateful to any advice .	Polite
1.1.5	Thanks !	St
1.1.6	!	St
1.2.1	can you afford $ 1400 or only $ 600 ?	Ques
1.2.2	does your budget include monitor ?	Ques
1.2.3	do you need multiple monitors ?	Ques
1.2.4	you need to set a budget and specify the monitor setup you want to use before you can get any good advice .	Sug
1.3.1	Well , the main thing is to get a great computer , but of course I would like it as inexpensive as possible I know , however , that I probably have to pay a bit , and I guess more like $ 1400 than $ 600 .	St
1.3.2	I do not need anything else than the machine ( no monitors or anything ) .	St
1.3.3	I am thinking of using Intel Core 2 Quad ... , a MB that fits it and a Graphic card compatible with Open GL and Active X-9 or more ( if I decide to build it myself ) .	St
1.3.4	I know that different components not always go together , and if any of you have some experience with parts that go well together , it would be great to hear about it .	St
1.4.1	Determine the primary s/w pkg .	St
1.4.2	you want and then find its requirements .	St
1.4.3	Using AutoCAD , google for it for results .	St
1.4.4	I like to refrain from terms like & quot ; powerful & quot ; it should be more like & quot ; capable & quot ; .	St
1.4.5	You do n't really need a fast cpu but rather stuffed ram and decent video .	St
1.4.6	If the s/w takes advantage of & quot ; multiple core cpus & quot ; then again , it need n't be the fastest but get one that your mtrbd .	St
1.4.7	fully supports , easily .	St
1.4.8	As for a mtrbd. , pick top-end brands as anything cheap will certainly hurt once the crunching starts .	St
1.4.9	Of course , be sure the case is well cooled .	St
1.4.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	all you need to decide is whether or not you want a & quot ; professional & quot ; graphics card .	St
1.5.2	consumer cards will work with most cad/rendering apps , but may have minor incompatilities -- the professional card has been tested and has better drivers to ensure higher precision and compatibility .	St
1.5.3	you need not worry about & quot ; parts that go well together & quot ; since all pci-express x16 cards will work in any pc equipped with an x16 slot .	St
1.5.4	personally , i suggest you start with a mid-range quad core like this $ 800 gateway lx-6200 , phenom x4 9500 , 8gb ram , 750gb drive , vista 64bit and add a $ 100 geforce 9600gt .	St
1.5.5	the 9600gt will exceed the raw performance of a $ 450 quadro fx1700 .	St
1.6.1	Call a custom build shop in your area , hopefully you have more than one so you can comparison shop .	St
1.6.2	Give them your requirements and budget and go from there .	St
1.6.3	A custom build is usually the preferred way to get your computer for the things your going to do , but hey , give dell a looksee and compare price with the custom shops ... ( xps series )	St
1.7.1	Thank you all for advice .	St
1.7.2	I have had a lot of computers , custom made , ready made and some I have built myself , and the ones I have been most satisfied with are the ones I have built myself .	St
1.7.3	That can be plain luck , but it can also be because the ones one can buy in the shop if one have a budget , are often not the latest , but maybe 6 month old machines .	St
1.7.4	If one will have the latest in parts , the machines will be very expensive ( Norway is one of the most expensive country to buy stuff in , thanks to horribly high taxes ) .	St
1.7.5	And that is why I am considering building a new computer myself .	St
1.7.6	I appreciate all the tips and advices I have got so far , and will start looking for parts Thanks .	St
