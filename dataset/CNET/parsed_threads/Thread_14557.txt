<s> Anyone know where I can find a transformer for a set of Logitech X540 speakers? </s>
<s> Logitech says they don't sell them. </s>
<s> Tiger Direct and Newegg are also no gos. </s>
<s> http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Logitech+X-540 and many other pictures do not show this component. </s>
<s> My bet is you'll have to buy a second x540 off ebay. </s>
<s> That's not a bad deal since power bricks could run that much! </s>

<s> Try going to Radio Shack see if there is a universal adapter kit that MIGHT work. </s>
<s> The critical points are the input fitting (size) and DC voltage, best to take them with if you decide to try this. </s>
<s> Oddly enough I had an OLD scanner laying around a while back and the inverter had gone south, went to radio shack, did a match up and it worked. </s>
<s> Just a thought. </s>
<s> Again, the fitting and voltage (DC) are the critical issues. </s>
