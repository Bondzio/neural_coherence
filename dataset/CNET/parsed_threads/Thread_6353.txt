<s> Hello, I just burned a DVD (with a bunch of pictures) on my PC, then put the DVD into my Mac G4. </s>
<s> Mac won't open it. </s>
<s> It won't recognize it. </s>
<s> Then I put another DVD with some files on it, also burned on my PC. </s>
<s> Same thing. </s>
<s> When I put a picture CD (from Ritz Camera) it opens it just fine. </s>
<s> When I put a DVD movie it opens it fine. </s>
<s> Is it possible that this problem comes from the fact that these DVDs were burned on the PC? </s>
<s> Thanks a lot! </s>

<s> You'll want to stick with MAC's preferred (I hope I remember this correctly) DVD-R or you may see this instant issue. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=mac+dvd+recording+format Many PCs came with only DVD+R/W recorders and you get instant headaches. </s>
<s> Next, the format of the data on the drive matters. </s>

<s> Hi Bob, My PC's DVD is 16X DL DVDRW, while my Mac's is just a regular CD-ROM/DVD-ROM. </s>
<s> The data is a bunch of .JPG pictures, nothing more. </s>
<s> And the media I used is actually DVD+R, so that may be the problem. </s>
<s> I'll get some DVD-R media and try it again. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Cheers, Exp. </s>
