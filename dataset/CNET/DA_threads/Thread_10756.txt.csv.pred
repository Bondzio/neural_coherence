1.1.1	I'm considering buying a laptop or desktop computer that will be exclusively for the internet but it must to produce a high quality web cam image.	St
1.1.2	For example, the web cam must have no less than 2 megapixels.	St
1.1.3	So, I plan on buying an external webcam.	St
1.1.4	I'm very familiar with Macs but I don't want to spend any more than necessary (less than $600), so I won't buy a Mac.	St
1.1.5	I have XP SP3 through bootcamp, but I'm still learning the basics.	St
1.1.6	I want a setup that will give me the least amount of complications or trouble down the road.	St
1.1.7	I know that I'll need a high speed internet connection, more than 3Mbps.	St
1.1.8	Does anyone have any suggestions or any information to help me narrow down the choices?	Ques
1.1.9	Also, are there other quality brands of webcams besides Logitech?	St
1.2.1	I would try HP/Compaq, both are made by the same company- HP, compaq being the budget part of hp, they have some really good desktops, and laptops, and some of their laptops do come with a really good webcam, and Hps are very reliable, ive owned several compaqs thru the years, none gave me any issues.	St
1.2.2	I would look on newegg.com for webcams, the customer reviews do help.	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	they are not the most reliable, since a friend of mine has a acer laptop with vista and has had nothing but major issues, so he bought a hp nettop, and another of my friends has a acer desktop and hes had nothing but major issues with it as well, considering acer scrimped on the ram by giving him only 1GB of ram and a single core athlon 64 for windows vista basic, and they also gave him aero on basic, so that further magnified his issues, so i would look at hp or dell, and nothing else, since other companies don't have the reliablity of dells and hps.

1.6.1	Why anyone would choose a single core CPU, 1GB ram and Vista?	Ques
1.6.2	Maybe they didn't do the research but I saw such a thing on black friday sales and still wouldn't buy it.	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	my friend bought it from the store like that, he didn't know much about computers then, but acer should of not did that, and his orginal computer, a 03 dell desktop, doesn't want to update to sp2 or sp3 of xp, so he got his own.	St
1.8.1	If people won't do the homework then they may feel 'entitled' that companies would only supply the best solutions.	St
1.8.2	Bob	St
1.9.1	Thanks everybody for your input.	St
1.9.2	I appreciate it.	Polite
