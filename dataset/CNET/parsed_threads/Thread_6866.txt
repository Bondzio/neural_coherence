<s> I have a Maxtor One Touch 200gb external hard drive that has given me some issues. </s>
<s> I use it primarily on my laptop, a Dell Latitude d610. </s>
<s> Now, I started having problems when I tried to access certain folders in the drive. </s>
<s> I would double-click them, and My Computer (I sound like an idiot, but whatever you call the thing you browse your hard drive with) froze up. </s>
<s> This happened repeatedly and consistently. </s>
<s> I was told to run a disk check (chkdsk or whatever), and many sections were found to be 'unreadable.' </s>
<s> Finally, I formatted the entire hard drive, since I couldn't access anything on there anyway. </s>
<s> Now, at least from some initial testing, it seems to work fine. </s>
<s> However, I barely have anything on it at the moment, so the problem could still be there. </s>
<s> Anyone know what is going on? </s>
<s> I'm kind of a newb, so feel free to remind me if I've forgotten to include anything. </s>
<s> If so it's known to corrupt at times. </s>
<s> Here's a search about how to convert to a safer NTFS volume. </s>

<s> Alas, no, it is NTFS. </s>
<s> =/ </s>
<s> Sorry but with so little clues I have to write the drive is dying or you don't backup your files. </s>
<s> External hard disks are fine copies but not a backup! </s>
<s> Read this recent reply about free tools. </s>
