1.1.1	I recently built a new system using the subject mobo with 8GB of PC6400 Crucial RAM ( matched sets ) .	St
1.1.2	When I loaded Win 7RC 64 bit it got to the & quot ; starting windows & quot ; screen and hung .	St
1.1.3	After several attempted fixes I removed 1 of the 2GB sticks and all worked great .	St
1.1.4	Thinking it might be a need a BIOS update ( even tho all 8GB showed when installed ) I downloaded the latest version and installed it and a window said all worked .	St
1.1.5	However , the BIOS still shows the prior version .	St
1.1.6	Tried it twice with same results .	St
1.1.7	This is not a huge problem as 6GB is certainly adequate for my needs but I guess I 'm stuborn .	St
1.1.8	I want all 8 ! ! !	St
1.1.9	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.10	TIA	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	compared the downloaded bios version with the original bios version you had on the mobo before flashing it ?	Ques
1.3.2	As you have mentioned that despite flashing it , the version still remains , thus , that bios version has not included the update YET of maximising the whole 8GB capability , but rather the full 4 slots with at most 6-7GB currently , with future updates taking advantage of 4x2GB ram .	St
1.3.3	But hang in there , for which once windows 7 comes in , new bios will be available for your full 8GB .	St
