<s> Hey guys, I wasn't exactly sure where to put this. </s>
<s> So I thought the general section would be a good bet. </s>
<s> Anyways, here is my dilemma. </s>
<s> Currently I'm looking to upgrade the RAM on my PC. </s>
<s> I have an Acer Aspire M1100 desktop and my processor is a AMD Athlon 64 processor 4000+ 2.60 ghz The main issue(I believe?) </s>
<s> Is that my RAM is horrific. </s>
<s> I only have 1 GB. </s>
<s> So essentially, any PC game made after 2008 doesn't run, at all. </s>
<s> Even League of Legends, which I feel isn't too bad resource wise. </s>
<s> I have to play on &quot;very low&quot; graphics, no shadows and sound off to even get to 35 FPS, and I even have to kill processes to do so. </s>
<s> This isn't counting games like DOTA2 which don't even load, or Minecraft which lags unless I turn everything down. </s>
<s> So my question is this, how big of an improvement would I see if I upgraded to say, 2 GB of RAM? </s>
<s> Or say I decided to jump up to 4GB or 8GB of RAM. </s>
<s> My PC would not explode, correct? </s>
<s> Or at the very least, would it even be compatible to run 4 or 8 GB of RAM? </s>
<s> And would the performance be stellar? </s>
<s> Thank you so much for your time, and reading through all that stuff! </s>
<s> http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=Aspire%20M1100&Cat=RAM No it won't blow up. </s>
<s> The perf should get a nice bump. </s>
<s> If you have a 32 bit OS don't go over 4GB. </s>
<s> give you more bang for the buck. </s>
<s> Only problem is you only have a 250W PSU....you'll probably need more to run a higher performance video card. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I'd try the usual 1GB ATI 5450 card. </s>
<s> Found around for 20 to 30ish bucks on newegg. </s>
