Purchased a DVI cable from Newegg back in August 2006 for my NEC Multisync flat panel monitor, which worked fine. Recently, I had to disassemble everything as we were having some work done around the house. Now, I go to put everything back together and, low and behold, the DVI cable is missing. As best as I can recall, my monitor has a female port (in case that matters in terms of what kind of cable I purchase). I'd buy the same one, but it's been so long, Newegg doesn't carry it anymore. Does it matter which DVI cable I purchase? What should I be looking for? Any suggestions on where/what to look at? I'm looking to resolve this ASAP as I have no computer access while this issue lingers. -Jason
