yea i will try it first , but i think it will satisfy my need.
But i do want to change my tower , i have $50 that i can spend like right now .But i can stretch up to $100 can you suggest me any good tower ?
also i have never changed towers or made my own pcs so i have no idea.
Will it be easy or is it going to be a hard job ?
is it like opening the screw and put it back in next or or pretty hard ?
thanks for help
