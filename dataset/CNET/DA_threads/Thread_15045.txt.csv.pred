1.1.1	Hey, I was hoping someone could help me out on this.	St
1.1.2	I have a PC that has a gigabyte motherboard, with on board SATA raid.	St
1.1.3	It also has IDE slots to plug in CD drives and any IDE hard drives.	St
1.1.4	I have 2 SATA hard drives plugged in but I hadn't set them up as raid.	St
1.1.5	My OS is windows XP.	St
1.1.6	Anyway, recently, I tried plugging in an IDE hard drive into one of the IDE Slots, (to transfer some files from my friends hard drive to my computer)... and when i started the comp after plugging in the the drive, it gave me a CMOS-Checksum error.	St
1.1.7	So I removed the IDE drive, and switched it on again.	St
1.1.8	It then said CMOS-Defaults loaded.	St
1.1.9	Then it tried to detect IDE drives, found none.	St
1.1.10	(this never used to happen before) Then it went on to detect 2 Sata drives.	St
1.1.11	(this is normal... used to happen before) Then it gave me an option to start windows normally, or in safe mode, last known good config, blah blah...	St
1.1.12	The problem is, whatever option i choose, my comp just restarts...	St
1.1.13	I dun even get the Windows XP splash screen.	St
1.1.14	Then the whole process is repeated again, till I reach the screen with the windows start up options and again whatever i choose, the computer restarts.	St
1.1.15	If i try choosing safe mode, it does its usually stuff in loading some files, it reaches up to some point, and the screen goes blank and it restarts.	Sug
1.1.16	There was nothing wrong with this computer before.	St
1.1.17	I mean it was in tip top shape.	St
1.1.18	Viruses in check, no addware, spyware.	St
1.1.19	Nothing of the sort.	St
1.1.20	Just plugging in my friends IDE hard drive, caused all this mess.	St
1.1.21	I'm sure nothing serious happened.	St
1.1.22	Probably some sort of setting somewhere messsed up.	St
1.1.23	I just dunno what, and how to change it.	St
1.1.24	Can anyone help me out with this?	Ques
1.1.25	thanks.	St
1.2.1	Go into the system BIOS and tell the computer where to look for the primary boot partition/primary startup drive.	St
1.3.1	Hopefully when you used that EIDE drive it didn't overwrite your &quot;regular&quot; Master Boot Record.	St
1.3.2	Usually by default the first IDE HD becomes the boot drive (at least on all SATA PC's I have worked on.)	St
1.3.3	Regarding CMOS checksum error..if it isn't fixed by removing that IDE drive, try resetting the CMOS/BIOS to defaults by either using the special jumpers...or removing the battery.	St
1.3.4	Consult your specific MOBO tech references.	St
