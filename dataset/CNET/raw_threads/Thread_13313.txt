EHD currently formatted NTFS... realize i must format to FAT32 in order to play directly though PS3. i don't need more than 4G per file space. i don't need security/privacy features. it seems logical to format to FAT32....BUT i COULD leave it NTFS and add a step of putting a video back on my camcorder in order to play it directly on PS3. i will do that IF the benefits of NTFS are BIG ENOUGH. i understand NTFS allows better/more usage of storage space...is less likely to crash...and is more of an overall efficient system. BUT, i also understand that NTFS formats are NOT meant to be used in removable storage??? So, FAT32 would be EASIER for me when viewing video...but i don't want to use it if there is any considerable risk to the media. I need help weighing this out...PLEASE!!!

Around the office and in the forums you see reports of the content vanishing due to power loss or a disconnect at the wrong time. While it's rare it's enough for me to add this question. Which is.. Are you OK with the drive contents vanishing without notice? Bob
