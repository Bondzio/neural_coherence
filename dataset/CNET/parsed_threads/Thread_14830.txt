<s> Hello, I have 2 windows XP computers I am tryingto set up with a Linksys router. </s>
<s> On my main computer, I have msn dsl and Norton AV and AVG antispyware and Spy Bot And Ad Aware. </s>
<s> On the other computer I have AVG free antivirus and spy bot and adaware. </s>
<s> Now the installation disc runs fine untill you get to the part of putting your password in. </s>
<s> Then it will not take your password or go any further. </s>
<s> Now strange as it seems at this point. </s>
<s> The other computer in the spare room is connected to the internet. </s>
<s> But my main computer where my dsl and the router are connected will not connect to the internet. </s>
<s> I have installed and uninstalled the linksys many times and the installation stops at password. </s>
<s> So don't know why other computer is connected to net and main one isn't. </s>
<s> Defective disc??? </s>
<s> But why won't my computer connect to net? </s>
<s> Thanks for any answer. </s>

<s> I have played with, use the acronym &quot;admin&quot; as the default password with nothing entered in the User field. </s>
<s> Is this what your manual states? </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> But we just couldn't get it set up. </s>
<s> So had the Geek Squad from Best Buy set it up with all the security and things. </s>
<s> Seems when the QWest DSL set up my dsl account they put a static ISP address instead of automatic and that was causing a problem. </s>
<s> It was worth the $89 I paid the Geek Squad to set it up for me. </s>
<s> Working great now. </s>
