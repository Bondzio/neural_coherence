<s> Hello I am trying to get devices on 2 different routers connected and networked together. </s>
<s> I'll describe the setup... Internet comes into the home via an ActionTec 2000 Wireless/Broadband router located in basement. </s>
<s> Connected to the ActionTec 2000 are: TV Set-top Box /PVR - wired connection Desktop PC running Win 7 - wired connection Wireless Devices that are brought into the basement ie. </s>
<s> Laptops or smartphones etc would be connected to the Actiontec as well. </s>
<s> DLINK xtreme N Wireless Router - Wired Connection from Actiontec is plugged into the Internet plugin on back of DLINK. </s>
<s> To the DLINK I have connected: XBOX 360 - Wired connection Laptop Win XP - Wireless Connection Laptop Win 7 - Wireless 2 Blackberries - Wireless Connection The IP address for the ActionTec is 192.168.1.254. </s>
<s> IPs it gives out to the devices connected to it are 192.168.1.xx. </s>
<s> The IP address of the DLINK is 192.168.0.1 and the range it gives out to devices are 192.168.0.xxx Is there a way to configure the routers and/or the devices to all exist on the same network? </s>
<s> I have access to both of the routers admin settings, as well can adjust the IP settings of the devices as well. </s>
<s> If more information is needed I can provide, thanks so much for reading and for any help! </s>
<s> Thanks David </s>
<s> I would not have used the WAN port of the second router but you can google how by the following phrase. </s>
<s> &quot;How to use a router as a WAP?&quot; Bob </s>
<s> Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> I actually fixed it by doing what you said. </s>
<s> I unplugged the WAN port connection on the Dlink and put it in one of the LAN ports. </s>
<s> Now everything is talking together and on the same IP address range. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> It's a common network setup (some call it a trick.) </s>
<s> But it's something you keep on hand for those special setups. </s>

<s> Hi all I don't suppose it is possible to do this via a wireless connection? </s>
<s> I have a similar issue where I have my modem downstairs which is connected to the internet and also to the sky box via ethernet. </s>
<s> My laptop and phone are connected via wireless. </s>
<s> I also have a modem with an external hard drive plugged into the usb port upstairs which may also connect to my bluray player via ethernet. </s>
<s> Basically I want to be able to connect my wireless devices to the modem upstairs which in turn speaks to the modem downstairs so I can access the internet. </s>
<s> Is this possible? </s>
<s> If someone could point me towards a tutorial that would be amazing, as you can see, my terminology isn't up to spec enough to know what to search for! </s>
<s> I would start a new post. </s>
<s> And how I solved that was to add a powerline network bridge and setup the other router as a WAP. </s>
<s> No new tech involved. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ok, I'll start it in a new thread, thanks for the advice </s>
