i am trying to stream mostly from the internet sites like &quot;watchseries&quot; on the boxee box.
it is a constant problem, not time of day related.. when you say &quot;that 615&quot; is that a bad thing??
ps thanks for the fast replys!!!
if you were buying a switch, what would you choose for this application?
