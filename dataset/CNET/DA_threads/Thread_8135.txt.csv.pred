1.1.1	I am putting together an old computer from parts and have an old ISA SB 16 sound card .	St
1.1.2	Running under Win ME it works BUT in SYSTEM in the control panel there is an unknown device and under that is an unsupported device .	St
1.1.3	When I delete the unsupported device and reboot the computer finds the SB 16 and unsupported device and installs them .	St
1.1.4	I 've tried drivers and deleting the sound card but it always comes back .	St
1.1.5	If I leave the sound card out , it is fine , so I know it is the SB 16 .	St
1.1.6	The problem is that when this happens my Linksys USB100TX responds during the Windows start up screen and shuts off before it gets to my desktop .	St
1.1.7	Thus no network log on and I have to re-install the USB100TX causing me to have to reboot and start the cycle again .	St
1.1.8	Any suggestions ?	Ques
