<s> Well, I have a wireless 2Wire DSL modem and SBC Yahoo internet service. </s>
<s> I have a computer wirelessly connected with a wireless card to it. </s>
<s> Now, everything was fine for a few weeks of downloading and whatnot. </s>
<s> Yet around last week, the broadband link light would start flashing amber for several seconds, then go back to green for several seconds, then go back to flashing amber. </s>
<s> It didn't seem to effect anything, so I ignored it. </s>
<s> Yet several days later, I noticed it was doing it again, and that time the internet stopped working until I turned off the wirelessly connected computer. </s>
<s> Does anyone know exactly what that flashing amber light signifies? </s>
<s> And how I get it to stop flashing so? </s>
<s> Is there possibly a download or upload limit imposed on SBC Yahoo service, and if so how can I find out? </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> a device with capabilities of 10 Mbps is accessing the modem/router. </s>
<s> Green is usually 100 Mbps. </s>
<s> Have you locked down your wireless network so others can not hop on? </s>
<s> An 802.11b device will drag down a &quot;G&quot; router. </s>
<s> I'm pretty sure other people aren't hopping on the network, it's just my other computer that's conencting wirelessly. </s>
<s> I know this because when I turn that other computer off, the blinking amber goes away. </s>
<s> So if this wireless card is the source of this blinking, how do I correct it? </s>
<s> It wasn't doing it for the longest time.. </s>
