<s> I just bought a 19&quot; LCD monitor. </s>
<s> Text, especially black text, is not clear. </s>
<s> My existing video card (NVIDIA GeForce 4 MX 440SE with AGP8X) doesn't have a DVI input. </s>
<s> Would it make a big difference in clarity if I upgraded my video card to something that does have DVI? </s>
<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
<s> Whilst DVI oes give a superior display (especially for game-play), there's is a setting within Windows for user's of LCD screens to improve text appearance. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Right-click empty part of Desktop and choose 'properties'. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Click the 'Appearance' tab. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Click the 'Effects' button. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Tick the second item which says &quot;use the following method to smooth the edges of screen fonts&quot;. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Now in the drop-down selector for that item, select &quot;ClearType&quot;. </s>
<s> Click 'OK' to save new setting. </s>
<s> Hopefully you will find the text is now clearer, since Microsoft developed ClearType especially for laptops and other LCD/TFT displays. </s>
