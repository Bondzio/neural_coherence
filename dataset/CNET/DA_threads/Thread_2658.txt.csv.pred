1.1.1	My question : Is there such a thing as a DSL signal booster ?	Ques
1.1.2	If so , can you read my & quot ; blurb & quot ; below to see if you would recommend one ?	Ques
1.1.3	Thanks in advance !	St
1.1.4	I am a teacher in a small Christian elementary school .	St
1.1.5	We have a computer lab with 19 desktop computers .	St
1.1.6	They are all networked ( wired ) to a router going into the only DSL outlet in the room .	St
1.1.7	At times , the computers on the other side of the room have low connectivity .	St
1.1.8	( Those 9 are hooked to a hub , and that one cord goes across the ceiling to the main router . )	St
1.1.9	Besides that one hub Ethernet cord , there are 10 other individual computer cords plugged into the router .	St
1.1.10	We are a new school in a fairly large , older church .	St
1.1.11	I am certain that when the DSL lines were run for the church that they did not anticipate there being over 35 new school computers hooking into the signal .	St
1.1.12	It seems overloaded to me , but that 's just my opinion .	St
1.1.13	Is there anything like a DSL signal booster that I can put between my wall jack and router ?	Ques
1.1.14	If so , where would I find such a thing ?	Ques
1.1.15	I appreciate any advice you can give !	Polite
1.2.1	for a switch .	St
1.2.2	It 's more efficient and may solve some speed problems ( although you did not note where the speed hit occured , Internet or Intranet ) .	St
1.2.3	Some reading : http : //www.stanford.edu/group/networking/lnaguide/docs/hubs-vs-switches.html	Sug
1.3.1	Thanks for the suggestion .	St
1.3.2	I actually have 2 Linksys 16 port workgroup switches in the lab .	St
1.3.3	One is at the only DSL wall jack in the room .	St
1.3.4	There are 7 computers hooked to that switch and one long cord coming from the switch on the other side of the room .	St
1.3.5	On that side of the room there are 12 computers hooked into that switch .	St
1.3.6	It is this side of the room that seems to have a slower connection at times .	St
1.3.7	I spoke with our building maintenance last night , and they told me that they can run another DSL line to my classroom .	St
1.3.8	That way I could split the number of computers on one jack .	St
1.3.9	This would create another split at one of the main DSL boxes , but it would keep no more than 10 computers plugged into one switch in my lab .	St
1.3.10	I guess it would also get rid of the & quot ; daisy chain & quot ; effect with a switch wired into another switch .	St
1.3.11	It will probably be just a trial and error setup .	St
1.3.12	Thanks again for the suggestion .	St
1.3.13	I welcome anyone else 's thoughts as well .	Polite
