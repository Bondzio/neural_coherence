I've seen this many times.
Especially with external drives that have lost power while connected to windows.
EasyRecovery DataRecovery can recover the data.
It's $200, but it will do it.
You can download a trial from the ontrack website that will let you see what files are recoverable before purchasing.
This is the only solution that works that I have experience with.
