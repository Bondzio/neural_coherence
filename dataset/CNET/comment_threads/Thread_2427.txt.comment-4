I have had a wireless router and a Logitech Wireless Keyboard as well as a logitec wireless optical trackball for over a year and have yet to have a single problem...
The only thing is when I have my feet on the desk or I have the receiver hidden behind something, I tend to lose connection (about 3-4 feet of clutttered deskspace).
So I rake everything into the garbage can and then it works like a charm...
