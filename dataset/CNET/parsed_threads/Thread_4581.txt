<s> Hello, I have two computers, a host and a client. </s>
<s> Both are running Windows XP Pro. </s>
<s> The host is not connected to the Internet or a network, but simply has it's NIC connected to a webcam via a crossover cable. </s>
<s> This is the first &quot;network.&quot; The host also has a modem which is setup to accept incoming calls (PPP) to allow access to the host. </s>
<s> This is the second network, when there is a connected incoming phone call. </s>
<s> The client (the computer dialing into the host) is not connected to the Internet. </s>
<s> The client connects to the host via its modem (28.8). </s>
<s> Essentially, the host is in an isolated area where no Internet access is available. </s>
<s> I want to dial into this computer and access the webcam to &quot;keep an eye on things.&quot; I can dial into the host just fine, and access Remote Desktop. </s>
<s> I can view the webcam on the remote desktop, but its very slow as you can imagine. </s>
<s> I cannot go to my command prompt on the client computer and ping the webcam, or access it with the viewer application. </s>
<s> It appears that the webcam and my dialup computer are on two different networks. </s>
<s> The host can see both networks, but the current configuration will not enable the dialup computer / client to access the webcam. </s>
<s> This is my problem. </s>
<s> If I can connect the client directly to the webcam via IP, the image downloads will be much more efficient because I won't have to use Remote Desktop. </s>
<s> I ran ipconfig on both the host and the client during the dialup session. </s>

<s> : 192.168.1.3 The IP address of the webcam is 192.168.1.115 and its subnet is 255.255.255.0. </s>
<s> I can access this IP address only from the host, not the dialup client. </s>
<s> I am hoping there is a simple answer to this. </s>
<s> I'm a certified Netware Administrator, which means I know a little bit about Netware file systems but thats about it. </s>
<s> The reason I'm using a dial-in method is that the host computer is in a remote location in the mid-west U.S. where broadband is not available. </s>
<s> Also, the webcam does not have a usb interface, only ethernet. </s>
<s> Thanks for any insight you can provide. </s>
<s> Robert </s>
<s> the problem is not networking but dial-up speed. </s>
<s> The higher the resolution on the camera equates to larger files (pictures and frame rate), which will be much slower uploading from the camera. </s>
<s> You might try lowering the camera resolution to bare minimum. </s>
<s> I'm on 10 Meg cable and a friend is on the same. </s>
<s> When we use our cams the voice is perfect but the pictures are very slow. </s>
<s> I can just imagine what it would be like on dial-up speeds. </s>
<s> Just a thought. </s>
<s> You say the dial-up speed is 28.8? </s>
<s> That's standard &quot;download&quot; speed. </s>
<s> Upload speed from the camera will be a fraction of that. </s>
<s> Guys, my plan is to set the camera to the absolute lowest setting. </s>
<s> In the range of 10,000 bytes per photo or less if possible. </s>
<s> Remote Desktop actually works reasonably well with the resolution and colors turned down. </s>
<s> I havent had a chance to try the camera, yet. </s>
<s> Once I get this networking problem solved. </s>
<s> Any ideas on that? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
