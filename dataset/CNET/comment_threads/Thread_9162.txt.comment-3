You made a mistake going from Me to XP, as the OS itself needs more resource support and you can feel it.
Your best bet is to increase the ram as much as possible or what the HP can tolerate.
256mb is nice, but 512mb is the most desirable ram amount to have.
Check the HP specs as to what each ram slot supports.
If you're lucky, you can swap cpu and install a faster one.
Alot depends on the HP model, so check those specs, HP does provide this either for the model or model line and/or generic info to do so.
