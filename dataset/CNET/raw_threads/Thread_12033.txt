6437	4	599891	5490241	5490153	OneVoltTen	8/23/13 10:42 PM	1.37729772E12	This is for personal video rendering mostly	I am planning on using this mainly for video rendering (20 720p 20min videos a day) and looking to use it for gaming and 3d modeling (autocad). With the OS I have an old cd drive, although I am going to plug my new hd into my old pc and clone windows 7 onto it.

6437	6	599891	5490380	5490241	VAPCMD	8/24/13 8:45 AM	1.3773339E12	Ok....if for autocad and video editing I'd go to the i7 and	16GBs RAM. The i5 is fine for gaming but not optimal for the other more CPU intensive uses. VAPCMD
