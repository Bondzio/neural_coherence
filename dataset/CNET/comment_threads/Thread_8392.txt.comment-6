I was wondering about this.
I tried to install XP after formatting the drive (via XP cd) and...low and behold...all of the old user files were still there.
What I am used to.... With the OX install CD you have the option for 3 levels of erasing: quick, zero, zero then write random.
I assumed this was standard.
