<s> I'm Currently thinking about getting the Macbook Black.Is Mac Capatible with everything that Windows is compatible with? </s>
<s> Is it hard to switch from windows to mac. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> that's about as &quot;compatible&quot; as it gets. </s>
<s> Keep in mind that when you run Windows on Apple Macintosh hardware you will also be &quot;compatible&quot; all the viruses, hacks, trojans, worms and malware that the Windows Operating Systems and associated applications (including Internet Explorer and Office, among others) that environment contends with. </s>
<s> It is a Windows environment, just like running Windows and Office and IE on a Dell, HP, Acer, Toshiba, Sony or home-grown brand or other Windows-only machines. </s>
<s> If you don't want to deal with all that baggage that Windows and Windows apps bring to the table then stay in the Macintosh Operating System (OSX) Unix-based, superior GUI, environment - Where Microsoft Office OSX has more features than its Windows counterpart... where Safari and FireFox (browsers) don't get infected... where buying a third party antivirus application is unnecessary and the built-in firewall actually provides protection. </s>
<s> BUT, if you must run Windows on a Mac, you can. </s>
<s> Very nicely and quickly and natively in an Intel CoreDuo hardware environment... Is it hard to switch? </s>
<s> It depends what you use the machine for. </s>
<s> Nearly all mainstream applications have equivalents or counterparts. </s>
<s> Microsoft Office is available in Windows and Mac OSX versions. </s>
<s> The iLife bundle of applications (iMovie, iDVD, iTune, iPhoto and Garageband) is FUN to work with and they all work together seamlessly - personally, WinDV is a very distant &quot;also ran&quot; in my opinion. </s>
<s> Connecting to various preipherals has always been easy - I use an HP laser printer and Canon inkjet printer on my home network of a G4 Tower and G5 flatpanel and HP/Compaq laptop... 100baseT ethernet and 802.11g (Belkin router) and TCP/IP and file sharing... and a host of other services and applications... </s>
<s> Since you have a Windows machine now, do you have to get rid of it? </s>
<s> Why not keep it and get the Mac and do both? </s>
<s> Boya, I believe he is asking does OS X work with as much software/hardware as Windows. </s>
<s> Now to answer his question, yes. </s>
<s> Actually OS X & Macintosh computers are probably more compatible with hardware than Windows. </s>
<s> Most of the devices that I have with Mac, are fully functional without software install. </s>
<s> Example, syncing my Nokia cell phone, attaching a USB Hard Drive. </s>
<s> However both those devices required software for use on my PC. </s>
<s> Now that doesn't apply to all devices but from my personal experience I have found that Mac's are way better at handling hardware. </s>
<s> On the software side you can pretty much find all the mainstream popular software on OS X, as you would on Windows. </s>
<s> Microsoft FULLY supports OS X, and actually, Office is more up-to-date on Mac, than it is on Windows. </s>
<s> I have had no problem sending files to PC users, sharing folders across networks with PC Users, and connecting to wireless access points. </s>
<s> You must remember that Mac is also a computer, just like Dell, HP, and Lenovo. </s>
<s> It's operating system is the same &quot;thing&quot; as Windows, just a different type. </s>
<s> With out getting into details, this is just some generic information that you can use. </s>
<s> If you have any other questions, drop them here. </s>
<s> I'll be happy to answer your Mac Compatibility questions! </s>
<s> Thanks, -M </s>
<s> I forgot to include this nifty little link: http://www.apple.com/getamac/ </s>
<s> Three people read the same post and arrive at a different view of what the poster is actually asking. </s>
<s> Here's my take: I think he is asking whether his existing Windows software will be compatible with his new MacBook. </s>
<s> Disregarding the fact that he could run Windows on his new machine, the answer has to be NO, it is not. </s>
<s> The Windows software will not run under OS X. </s>
<s> However, as pointed out, it will run when the MacBook boots into Windows. </s>
<s> Hardly making the switch from windows to mac. </s>
<s> If he is asking whether his Mac will be able to do the same things as his Winbox, then the answer is a resounding YES, but with different software and better! </s>
<s> And More!. </s>
<s> Web surfing, email, Instant Messaging and the like, happens on a Mac as well. </s>
<s> We all surf the same internet, it does not belong to Microsoft, no matter how hard they try. </s>
<s> So, just another take on the same question. </s>
<s> Hopefully jchau will find whatever he is looking for in the different answers P </s>
<s> Yes that was what i was talking about if Mac was compatible with all the programs that windows is capatible with. </s>
<s> Apple makes Macintosh hardware - the computers... and software - OSX Operating System and a bunch of applications. </s>
<s> Microsoft makes Windows - the operating system - and a bunch of applications, but does not manufacture hardware on which Windows Operating System runs (that is, you cannot buy a Microsoft branded computer - you buy Dell or HP or Acer or some other manufacturer's hardware on which to run Windows. </s>
<s> Will Windows - the Operating System - run on current Apple Macintosh hardware? </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> Does this mean existing Windows applications will run on Windows Operating System running on Apple Macintosh hardware? </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> Will Apple Macintosh OSX - the Operating System - run on Apple Macintosh hardware? </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> Does this mean existing Apple applications will run on Apple Macintosh OSX running on Apple Macintosh hardware? </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> Will Windows applications run on Apple Macintosh OSX Operating System? </s>
<s> No. </s>
<s> The basis of Apple's OSX Operating systen is Unix. </s>
<s> The basis of Microsoft's Windows Operating system is not Unix. </s>
<s> The application needs to be written to run on an operating system - and many times ported - sometimes totally re-written - to the other operating system. </s>
<s> I have been told that I cannot connect to my office server (which is Windows) even if I was running Windows on my Mac because of a 'hardware compatability issue&quot;. </s>
<s> Is this true and if so is there a way to get around it? </s>
<s> there are many company's that run a mixed platform shop. </s>
<s> There may be &quot;software&quot; issues but there should not be hardware problems, unless your company is using some form of hardware authentication (smart card) to authenticate to your server. </s>
<s> Mac's connect to Windows servers and desktops quite easily, it's part of the OS. </s>
<s> If your office is running Active Directory, there is a piece of software called ADmit Mac, by Thursby, that will allow the Mac to interact with Active Directory. </s>
<s> You need whoever told you that you cannot connect, to be more specific about what they perceive to be the problem. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Beyond Active Directory such as remote screen viewing. </s>
<s> We use a version of VNC and there is NO HARDWARE ISSUE here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sometimes there are hardware issues - like if your IT department makes you use some sort of odd dongle to get into an application. </s>
<s> There are other hard ware specific things. </s>
<s> Sometimes, though, it is the ignorance of the IT staff. </s>
<s> I am no longer in IT - I have a lot more fun in sales... but our IT department does not support Macs. </s>
<s> I am able to connect my Mac to our Exchange Server using the tools the IT folks provided for the Windows people to get their email and calendar information using a browser. </s>
<s> I have helped several other employees do the same thing. </s>
<s> Sometimes (not always), IT will say something is not supported because (1) &quot;It has not been tested&quot;, and (2) they don't want to (or can't) take support calls from people who have problems with non-standard stuff. </s>
<s> So... </s>
<s> If you are willing to be self supporting, then you really cannot break anything by trying. </s>
<s> But keep in mind that it means you cannot call IT when you have an issue - you are on your own. </s>
<s> Also, keep in mind that you may be in violation of your company's IT rules - so you should be familiar with them before you start doing &quot;different&quot; stuff. </s>
