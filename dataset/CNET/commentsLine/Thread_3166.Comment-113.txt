i have been using external ide and of late esata flavors for some years.
i have also gone the diy by putting drives in aftermarket enclosures (usually after using acronis true image to migrate the os and other info to a larger hd).
i put the old drive in the aftermarket enclosure.
currently, i'm spinning about 2.75 gb on my primary ws, with only 400gb in the case, the rest external.
my observations: 1. purpose built externals have much longer life than diy externals.
2.
3.5&quot; at any rpm lasts longer than 2.5&quot; laptop style hd's 3. speed, in order of decreasing performance: esata, firewire (1600, 800, 400), usb 2.0, usb 1.1 4. brand / initial quality-warranty / price make a difference.
5. use your favorite search engine to check the quality technical sites (e.g.
cnet.com) *before* buying new, or when it gets &quot;sick&quot;.
6. handling - the drive you cart around from place to place doesn't last as long as one that just sits with the system.
7. ventilation and heating matter.
hotter = less.
built in fan in case generally equals larger.
(btw, a small fan blowing across enclosures without fans does keep the temp lower...) 8. a good reference & utility site like speedfan  is invaluable.
they also have an extended s.m.a.r.t comparison diagnostics feature.
just my $0.02 worth.
