Besides the programs Robert mentioned you may want to consider what is going on when you do this.
If your system has been idle for a while the Hard drive may spin down and have to spin up to speed.
If you click on file once and it is slow, what happens the next time, is it still slow, if not that may be the reason.
You have more than one system and have mapped a networked drive from another and that system is not turned on, the file view window can be very slow coming up.
If you are using Norton Anti virus 2002 this is a common problem.
(fixed in 2003).
