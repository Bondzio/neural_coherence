You'll need to know what coolant is needed at the very least. A visit too there site is needed if not required. Cleaning it could lead to leaks do this very sparingly. &quot;DANGER....WATER AND ELECTRICITY DO NOT MIX&quot; .
3660	2	279268	2675411	2675006	Willy	1/10/08 6:36 AM	1.19994696E12	After install	Once installed most coolers don't need attention especially if using the supplied vendor coolant. Once the air is burped out of the system, it is closed to any outside influence of bacteria, etc., and using the supplied vendor coolant which contains antiseptic properties. You biggest worry is possible leaks but again, inspection within the 1st days tells that. All this should be explained at the makers support website. For far greater details on real in-depth insight check with &quot;modders websites&quot;, I like http://www.overclockers.com and look over some links provided. FYI - Firefox wasn't a problem to view your supplied link. tada -----Willy
