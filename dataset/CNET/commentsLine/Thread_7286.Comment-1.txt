man.
sony sucks.
everything that i bought from them don't work properly.
i bought a digital cam from sony.
and sometimes the screen will go blank.
and the only way to solve the problem is to hit on it like a bixxx that it is.
anyway, this dvd rom is not acting properly either.
it has some sticky things in the center circle.
so if i leave the cd inside for too long, the cd will stick to the center.
it is so strong that i can't even eject the cd.
i had to open up the whole case in order to do that.
ok. here is my real question.
this thing won't read any dvds at all!
nothing at all.
what is happening?
i installed the latested driver for it.
but it won't recognize it.
