<s> Hello - I have a Epson R800 photo printer which I bought about a year ago. </s>
<s> I am having many problems getting the right coloring on my photos. </s>
<s> I have photos that I have taken with my Nikon D70 that look BEAUTIFUL when I look at them on my screen. </s>
<s> However, when I go to print them, they look awful - especially if the picture is in low light. </s>
<s> All of my B&W photos have a bluish tint to them and the reds and lighter tones on people's skin are WAY too bright - these are just a couple of the problems I am having. </s>
<s> I have played around endlessly with the settings on the printer to change the coloring to no avail. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this? </s>
<s> This has been said to be an excellent printer, so I realize that I may be doing something wrong. </s>
<s> One person has said that I always need to use actual Epson ink cartridges and not some other brand. </s>
<s> Could this be the issue? </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks, Matt </s>
<s> no savings down the road with off-brand ink. </s>
<s> Did you ever get good pictures (with the Epson ink)? </s>
<s> I did not have the original Epson ink when I got the printer, so I am not sure how it performed. </s>
<s> Maybe I should just purchase some and see what happens? </s>
<s> I have been very happy with the color prints produced on the R800, until recently. </s>
<s> I'm getting a blue/green tint to all black and white prints, regardless of whether or not I &quot;remove color&quot;, take saturation to &quot;0&quot;, or do both. </s>
<s> I've always used the Epson ink. </s>
<s> At this point, I've exhausted the traditional options to correct the probelm (ran all the utility clean-up prodcedures). </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> You should do test prints and several cleaning cycles to assure that the printer is up to task. </s>
<s> As all Epson printers are picky of the quality ink they use, stick with Epson ink until good quality outputs are achieved, thus if you change to different vendort, you can blame the ink. </s>
<s> You need to start from scratch. </s>
<s> Here's a link that gives a review on Epson R800: http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/printers/epson-r800.shtml It appears that a new different ink was used this model notknown before. </s>
<s> In that alone, stick with Epson ink. </s>
<s> To better clean the printer, directly swipe the printhead with a damp clean cloth to remove all crud/gunk build-up, then do a cleaning cycle. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
