1.1.1	Hi all , I 've transplanted a few CPUs and motherboards in my day ... but now I 've bought all the components to build my own system from scratch .	St
1.1.2	I 've got and Athlon 64 3700+ , a quality heatsink and some leftover Artic Silver 5 .	St
1.1.3	I 've noticed that the Artic Silver site ( http : //www.arcticsilver.com/arctic_silver_instructions.htm ) when referring to the AMD 64 's , it says that it 's ''more important '' to cover the CPU core rather than the whole heat spreader from corner to corner .	St
1.1.4	I 've always had very good luck spreading a super thin layer on a processors core in the past ... should I really not apply a thin layer to the entire heat spreader ?	Ques
1.1.5	Is it a bad idea in general , or simply a waste of compound ?	Ques
1.1.6	If I follow the instructions and simply apply a drop ( 3/4 size of a bb ) to the center of the heat spreader , I 'll never see exactly how well the compund was spread when I applied the heatsink , which makes me uncomfortable .	St
1.1.7	Am I being silly ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks .	Polite

1.2.1	that they did NOT say to not cover the entire heat spreader .	St
1.2.2	Seems that they want you to know that the CPU chip itself is only about 1 sq inch and thus is only a small portion of the heat spreader .	St
1.2.3	Seems that they simply want you to know that you MUST get the compound on the specific area where the CPU die contacts the heat spreader .	St
1.2.4	If I remember correctly the CPU chip is not exactly in the center of the heat spreader .	St
1.2.5	Thus if you get a nice uniform spread of the compound on most of the spreader you will include the most critical area .	St
1.3.1	I think the logic is that with Artic Silver 5 , they do n't want you to & quot ; pre-spread & quot ; the stuff at all .	St
1.3.2	This seemed surprising to me at the time .	St
1.3.3	It 's consistency dictates that you add the rice-sized drop and allow the application of the heatsink to do the work for you .	St
1.3.4	I e-mailed Artic Silver and they said that using this method eliminates & quot ; air gaps & quot ; ... and that if you & quot ; pre-spread & quot ; the compound before appyling you would most likely have air gaps .	St
1.3.5	Off I go !	St
1.3.6	Cheers .	Polite
