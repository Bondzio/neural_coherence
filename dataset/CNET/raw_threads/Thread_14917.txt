Left4Dead2 Demo did not play that well either. I have a 300 watt power supply, and some claim that the Radeon 4650 , and 4670 will work? I have had others claim that I need to get a (uhm.. crappy) 8500 GT nVidia ? Then there are others that say I need to upgrade my power supply before I even think about getting any upgrades? Any more ideas?

I know that sounds confusing since some may hit the wrong button and read 120VAC but I know the diff. The 9400 is not a screamer but the 8400 PCI card in a machine that had no PSU upgrade is running fine. Bob
