<s> Which routers currently have good content filtering? </s>
<s> I am looking at possibly replacing my NetGear 7230 since it seems to &quot;choke&quot; after too much use. </s>
<s> I like the &quot;content filtering&quot; subscription the router allows since I can keep my family from stumbling on certain sites. </s>
<s> I did purchase another router that claimed it supported content filtering, but that required entry of each site. </s>
<s> I am definitely NOT doing that. </s>
<s> Do any other consumer-grade routers support this? </s>
<s> I have used a SonicWall SOHO for a several years, but their annual fee for content filtering was much too high for my usage. </s>

<s> See if the WRT54G with the upgrade addresses this. </s>
<s> http://lifehacker.com/software/router/hack-attack-turn-your-60-router-into-a-600-router-178132.php As to the 'choke', if I see a router do that I update the firmware and make sure it's not buried under a pile of trash (heat kills). </s>
<s> If that doesn't do it, it goes back. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The cfs subscription is more expensive on a SOHO unit because the SOHO is postioned more as a business class appliance (businesses are more apt to spend higher dollars than consumers). </s>
<s> Consider purchasing a SonicWALL TZ150. </s>
<s> You should be able to purchase the firewall and the cfs for about the same cost as the SOHO for the first year. </s>
<s> The follow-on years should run you about $120 per year. </s>
<s> Let me know if you need additional details. </s>
<s> $120 per year is still 3x to 4x what I want to pay. </s>
<s> I don't love my NetGear, but it works for about $30 per year for CFS. </s>
<s> Does the TZ150 limit the number of users? </s>
<s> That was a real annoyance with my SOHO unit. </s>
<s> Brad </s>
<s> When I check for a firmware update I am told it is &quot;up to date&quot;. </s>
<s> The unit is also outside the warranty period. </s>
<s> I did purchase a NETGEAR WPNT834 RangeMax 4-Port Switch 240 Mbps MIMO 802.11g/b Wireless Router, since I found it for around $75 (which may have been an error). </s>
<s> I will see if that works any better, though having a spare is not a bad idea either. </s>
<s> Brad </s>
<s> Take a look at the Zyxel Zywall 2. </s>
<s> I've had one for 2 years and have been very happy with it. </s>
<s> The content filtering subscription can be purchased for about $ 65. per year. </s>
