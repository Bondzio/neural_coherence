It should be no problem.
What is have done in the past is bring the new OS up and make sure that all is working ok. Power down, pull the new drive and make sure that it is set to MASTER, not to single drive.
Now set the older drive to SLAVE.
Re-install both drives and power up tyou system.
When the system comes up it will see the other drive and set it up for you.
That's it.
Good luck
