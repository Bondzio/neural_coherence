1.1.1	Does anyone have any idea how a Jaton Geforce 5700 pci (not pci-e) would compare to an ATI Radeon 9250?	St
1.1.2	I have a Radeon 9250 256 Mb card installed, but am wondering if the Jaton Geforce 5700 pci might be better...anyone have any clue what might be better?	St
1.2.1	a geforce 5700 more/less comparable to a radeon 9500.	St
1.3.1	If you can't afford a bigger jump, like a 6600GT, I personally wouldn't bother.	St
1.3.2	But that's me and it's your money.	St
1.3.3	Check Tom's Hardware for comparisons.	St
1.3.4	chuck	St
1.4.1	There was a 5700Ultra, 5700, and 5700LE.	St
1.4.2	The latter is still in production in light numbers.	St
1.4.3	I picked up a BFG 5700LE and OC'ed it to 450/550 with stock cooling.	St
1.4.4	It played Call of Duty, Metal of Honor, and in the upper settings.	St
1.4.5	Now its sitting in my junk box until I install it in my older Dell.	St
1.4.6	The 9250 is much slower.	St
1.4.7	It doesn't even have a fan.	St
1.4.8	Stick with the 5700LE, which is much better.	St
1.5.1	I have a 9250 and dispite its age, I think its still one of the better PCI cards left.	St
1.5.2	I play World of Warcraft with most display setting on the max and it preforms fine.	St
