When i try to scan or copy all I hear is loud clicking from the cables that move the scanner, and a message that says &quot;scanner error.&quot; The cable that is hooked to the scanner seems to be plugged in-I took off the right side of the printer where the motherboard is. I need this to fax and scan docs, so any help would be much appreciated.

Did you try uninstalling and reinstalling the software? That would be the FIRST thing to try, assuming that nothing has been changed, hdwe, software or operating system.
