depends.....but new systems do not require less power.
all factory type computers like dell, gateway, hp, compaq, sony, emachine, etc...will install the lowest (usually the cheapest) power supply that will adequately support all the components that come with their particular model and priced computer.
like dell would put a very low power supply in their 2400/3000 models and a much higher power supply in their xps mode.
what usually happens is that after a particular low priced computer is purchased, joe blow decides to up the video graphic, add a dvd or cdr, bigger hard drive, or something that puts a strain on the power supply, which can cause freeze ups, other problems, even like one of mine.... smoke coming out of the power supply.
builders (people buying components and putting them together)or having some company configure their pc to build are always encouraged to put in at least a 350 to 500 watt power supply.
the thing is....buy a higher priced 'factory' computer...or consider changing out your power supply when you start adding stuff that may be more powerful than the original equipment.
