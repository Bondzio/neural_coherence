1.1.1	I have a Lacie d2 Quadra hard-drive that I've been using on a Mac computer for several years.	St
1.1.2	The Mac computer that the drive was connected to is pretty much dead (Held out for 8 years though!)	St
1.1.3	and I need to transfer the files from the hard drive to a PC computer.	St
1.1.4	I can plug the drive into a Mac and it just mounts on its own, but nothing happens when I plug it into a PC.	St
1.1.5	I read the manual and it says to format the drive as NTFS and it will appear in my Computer folder.	St
1.1.6	However, I am worried that formatting the drive will erase everything on it and I will loose all my data.	St
1.1.7	Does anyone have any experience with this?	Ques
1.1.8	I've formatting smaller things like flash drives etc and I know that always erases the data, so I'd rather be sure about this before I do something stupid and erase every song and media file I've ever owned... Any input would be great	St
1.2.1	Copy your stuff out before formatting.	St
1.2.2	And to share a little more, I found booting a LiveCD (no install!)	St
1.2.3	called UBUNTU (no learning linux!)	St
1.2.4	let me access such drives and copy content out.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Glad I asked!	St
1.3.2	So is there no way to use my drive on a Mac and PC without erasing everything?	St
1.3.3	My sister has a Mac and I have a PC (not for long hopefully...)	St
1.4.1	In my opinion, too unreliable.	St
1.4.2	Today's Apples can use NTFS.	St
1.4.3	So when you get your files safe, try NTFS next time.	St
1.4.4	Be safe!	St
