I have a Dell Dimension L700CXE.
It only has a CD-ROM and I would like to buy a CD-RW/DVD burner for it.
It only has the one opening for the CD-ROM.
I don't know what I should purchase, an internal, or external.
I don't even know if I can get an internal.
I also don't know if I have to purchase the burner from Dell or if I can use another brand.
Can someone please help this complete novice with these dilemmas?
