1.1.1	I had to reimage my computer due to a virus .	St
1.1.2	Prior to doing so , I transferred ( or believed I had transferred ) all of my files to our Maxtor external hard drive .	St
1.1.3	I can not locate my files on the hard drive , however , nor did they transfer back to my laptop completely .	St
1.1.4	The only files that transferred back were my backups from June .	St
1.1.5	Is there any other way of locating the last 6 months of data and pictures that I have now lost ?	Ques
1.1.6	My laptop is a Toshiba satellite L355-S7812 and I run Windows Vista .	St
1.2.1	You did n't reveal what you used to backup .	St
1.2.2	Here I use the simple copy to the external with Explorer .	St
1.2.3	Not hard and never encrypted or in some proprietary format or worse & quot ; NTBACKUP & quot ; .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I do n't have another backup- the Maxtor is an external hard drive to which I manually transferred my documents before I reimaged my laptop .	St
1.3.2	Normally , the maxtor will automatically offer to transfer documents ( One-touch , I believe ) , but when connected to my laptop it did not offer me that option , so I copied and pasted to the Maxtor .	St
1.4.1	The same question and more .	St
1.4.2	1 .	St
1.4.3	Do other machines read those files ?	Ques
1.4.4	( or show them . )	St
1.4.5	2 .	St
1.4.6	It 's interesting that you opted for automatic or software that you are unsure of how it works or how to recover when it fails .	St
1.4.7	Your copy and paste is one method I use all the time with great success .	St
1.4.8	However a new user might think that such files would automatically copy themselves back .	St
1.4.9	ALL TYPES OF USERS SHOW UP HERE so I ca n't guess what you are seeing in Explorer on this drive or if you expected the Maxtor to do something automatically .	St
1.4.10	Try looking at the drive with Explorer for your files .	St
1.4.11	Try another machine too .	St
1.4.12	3 .	St
1.4.13	That one click option was usually a feature of an application we installed from Maxtor .	St
1.4.14	Since you reinstalled the OS , you would need to reinstall the Maxtor one click app .	St
