I have a Pressario SR5410F and it will only start evry 20 or 30 times I press the start button.
When it does not start I do not get a post beep, or get into the bios...just nothing, then every once and a while it will just start up.
When it does I get the resume windows screen, it reboots and then won't start again.
I have checked the following: -power supply (checked on a tester and swapped out for different one) -ram (ran memory test - AOK) -ran HDD test - everyting AOK -removed and replaced CPU with new thermal grease Could it be the motherboard, if so how do I check?
Also if I do replace the motherboard will any uATX 775 board work as the Compaq one, if I can find it is about 250.00...not worth repairing.
Any ideas on my next step would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks Sean
