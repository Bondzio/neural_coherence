Everyone has been advising me to buy mac because the features are great (plus it includes the new iSight), but the problem is...apple laptops are not that user friendly. Dell on the other hand is very user friendly but it's bigger and heavier than apple. Both have intel core duo as processors, Please advise me on what laptop should i buy. thanks!

If its not 1 thing its another. The way they organize & simply operate just doesnt work well for my taste. I do everything on a computer, from Word to music, to web design, surfing, downloading, etc, & Dells just seem to get in my way. Go w/ the Apple.
