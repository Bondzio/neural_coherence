may be the solution if you have straight line-of-sight layout.
this is because the gain is at the cost of antenna being unidirectional -- so alignment and lack of obstruction is critical.
i'd look at e-bay or a large network equipment dealer for dish with correct connector.
you need to keep the connecting wires between wireless devices and antennas as short as pos, incidentally.
