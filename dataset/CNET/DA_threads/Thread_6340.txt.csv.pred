1.1.1	ok, I just set up 2 new computers in a small office setting.	St
1.1.2	One of them (which I want to use as my server) is running Vista.	St
1.1.3	The other is running xp.	St
1.1.4	I plugged everything in and to my suprise they were all talking and things were great.	St
1.1.5	After I installed a few things: -Avast free version -Microsoft office -All the windows updates for both computers -And I changed the users on both to one admin with a password and one restricted guest with a password.	St
1.1.6	Now I cannot log onto the vista machine from the xp machine.	St
1.1.7	It sees the computer in the workgroup list but the box just blinks when I type in the user and pass and press ok On the other end, the Vista machine sees the xp, but when I click on the icon it says that windows cannot access..., check the spelling etc.	St
1.1.8	Any help would be much appreciated.	St
1.1.9	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	That's where it looks to have failed.	St
1.2.2	Work back to where it worked.	St
