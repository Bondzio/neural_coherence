are you running the nozzle check?
if so, does it show anything now that you have replaced the cartridges again.
be aware, that pulling out a cartridge and putting it back in is a no no with an epson, it can leave a bubble in the nozzle that will not clear up easily.
you really need to clean until you get a complete nozzle check pattern.
at this point, about all you can do is try repeatedly, printing a nozzle check each time.
it should improve with each cleaning.
you can buy cartridges that have cleaning fluid in them, that may fix it.
