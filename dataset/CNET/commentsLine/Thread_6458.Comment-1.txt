whenever i connect my 80gb ipod classic to my computer a box pops up that is titled &quot;devicemsglistenerwnd: ipod service.exe application error&quot;.
in the box it says &quot;the instruction at 0x00427259 referenced memory at 0x00000044.
the memory could not be read&quot;.
the ipod shows up in windows explorer but doesn't show up in my itunes so i cant sync my music to it.
i have connected it to my other computer and that works but it does not have my music on it.
what should i do?
