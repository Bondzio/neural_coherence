Hi Current configuration of my PC core 2 duo E6600 @ 2.40GHz MSI MS7350 Chipset- Nvidia nforce650i sli stp 4GB DDR2 Nvidia 8600 GT 256MB I am looking to upgrade my Mobo and Processor.
I have the following option in mind Intel i7-860 Motherboard Intel DP55WG Ram= 4GB Corsair DDR3 ( 2*2GB kit) My query * Is the above combination perfectly compatible?
*Is there better combo for similar price range?
*Will this combo be in mid-high performing range atleast for next 2-3 years?
[is there any other better processors announced??]
PS.
I will be upgrading my graphics card to HD5850 1GB in few months- so the board should be compatible with this card too.
I will be using my PC to watch movies and play games like Modern warfare 2/ GTA 4 etc at the Highest settings.
Thanks
