Just to try it the last tablet was the G tablet http://reviews.cnet.com/tablets/viewsonic-g-tablet/4505-3126_7-34431221.html I also have a BN Color Nook with the Cyranogen installed. But maybe there's more to this than Ustream. It's just an app. Link follows. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tv.ustream.ustream&hl=en You can find better tablets than this thing I happen to have today. Our office works on apps so I never know exactly which tablets are free at the time. Bob
