i would be guessing if this is just another pc power supply.
i had hope you could tell more.
i know, i know that some folk want to replace with the exact models but in your common pcs we have some standards.
if you would share a bit more then i could see if a stock supply will do.
there are some hundreds on newegg.com that would do but if you would tell more such as the dimensions and connections it would go a long way.
