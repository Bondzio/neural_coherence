It came with a cable which splits it to two VGA outs. So I comfortably run two monitirs at a decent relolution. One goes to a projector, the other to my monitor. Cool beans. Now I have a need for an additional s-video out (carrying the same signal as the projector), which goes to a video switcher, and ultimately to a DVD recorder. What is the simplest way to accomplish this? I have an older ALL-IN-Wonder card that could be installed at no cost, but will XP allow that?
