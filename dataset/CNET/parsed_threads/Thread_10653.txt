<s> I recently updated my 64 GB Wifi/3G iPad to iOS 4.2.1 and now my iPad Mail app cannot get my mail from the Yahoo! </s>
<s> Server. </s>
<s> It tells me I need to enter the password. </s>
<s> After I enter the password it takes forever &quot;verifying&quot; then tells me &quot;The IMAP server &quot;apple.imap.mail.yahoo.com&quot; is not responding. </s>
<s> Check your network connection and that you entered the correct information in the &quot;incoming Mail Server&quot; field.&quot; I cannot find any &quot;incoming Mail Server&quot; field and the outgoing mail server fields are grayed out so I cannot make changes. </s>
<s> I can still get the mail when I go to the Yahoo! </s>
<s> Web site using Safari. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what the problem is or have suggestions? </s>
<s> I didn't have any problem getting the mail prior to my software upgrade. </s>
<s> Deleting the account, using wifi, then re add the problem account. </s>
<s> Make sure it is connected I have been having problems now connecting to WiFi w/ O/S 4.2 even though the icon shows 100% contacted, once I get a page too load it is fine. </s>
<s> Same thing happened to me. </s>
<s> I deleted the account that I made at home and redid it when I was on another wifi network at work. </s>
<s> It worked ever since. </s>
<s> However when I go home it won't update. </s>
<s> I deleted the account again and tried to rejoin but it does the same thing it did before. </s>
<s> I will redo the account t work again on Monday. </s>
<s> This tells me the issue is with my cable router (motorola sbg900). </s>
<s> Perhaps a port or something. </s>
