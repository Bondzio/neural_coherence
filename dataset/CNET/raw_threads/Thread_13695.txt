Thanks

Run a high GPU usage software program (game). Watch for video breakdown, strange dots or artifacts appearing on screen during game play. If no problems occur try another 5% step. Do until you get problems then back off a step. Just keep in mind that more speed means more heat to dissipate and power usage. The way I look at it is when over-clocking you are slowly taking a component to higher rate of operation than its specs at point of sale. You are betting that the component is better than the specs it was rated for by the manufacturer. Sometimes you win and sometimes, you get the idea.

Is there any &quot;guidelines&quot; as to what is &quot;safe&quot; and what is not?What i'm asking is how high of a temperature can i hit before i have to implement more cooling? Can i det the clock too high? i currently have the clock set at 570.38MHz and memory @418.5MHz and nothing negative has happened?The tempoerature is currently at 44C with the fan speed on the card at 70% (i modified the fan speed as well just to be safe).

See if documentation states if you overclock the warranty is still good. I would think that with all ATI's knowledge that if they release overclock tools/program you should be all right. If the programs from ATI don't seems to make it happen than go looking, but if you have a warranty still in effect stay with ATI programs and drivers.

Graphical anomalies - when they show up (missing textures and that feeling of - oh dear, it's going to crash!) That is when you've pushed too far. This 'too much' limit is going to be different for every single card. That means every single factory made ATI 1600pro 512mb DDR2 AGP like mine is uniquely different regarding overclocking. One 1600pro will fail at default clock speed + 60mhz while another won't. Also to correct an earlier post - ATI (along with NVIDIA) do not provide their own overclocking tools. Just because a mate has downloaded an utility called ATI Tools don't mean it came from ATI. Either you get a 3D card overclocked at factory level or you void the warranty and do it yourself by using a free 3rd party program like ATI Tools or RivaTuner if you have nvidia. For some good advice try Guru3.com btw - your cellar is the reason for your ability to overclock due to the low temperature. and why do you own a high end pc with a mid range card?
