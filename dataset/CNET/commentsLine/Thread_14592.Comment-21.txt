if you don't want to wipe your drives and reformat using the small drive for your os, then let's get started: 512mb is the maximum amount of memory that win me will properly recognize.
if you can find a stick so you can boost your memory to 512mb total somehow and do it cheaply (pny), then go ahead.
go to these sites and tweak win me the way they say:    set your virtual memory settings to these amounts: first box:512x2= 1024 in 1st box second box:1024x2=2048 - 1 = 2047 in 2nd box, close window download tweakui and use the tweak settings in it for further performance gains.
empty temp, temp internet and cookies folders......... make sure hdds are set for dma type msconfig.sys in the run window on the menu and turn off apps that start up and are not needed do complete system maintenance and make sure all unused programs/apps are removed first.
you might just be better off to save all your data files, your address book (.pst files), your pics, etc.
and burn(copy) them to a cd and just reinstall me clean.
if you do get all the updates now and save them to your hard drive as they're not going to be available much longer and install up to the latest you can get, update all your hardware drivers to the latest for me, then do the tweaks, copy your docs/pics/etc, back onto your drive re-enable your antivirus, make sure that your firewall (zone alarm, free), spyware/adware detector/removers are updated (adaware, spybot, hijack this , all free), your popup stopper (panicware, free)is installed and check things out.
while your at it, pull the side covers off the tower, take a can of compressed air and blow the insides out so there is no dirt chunks, hairballs, etc inside the case.
there is more but too much to go into on this thread..the basics have been covered..........
