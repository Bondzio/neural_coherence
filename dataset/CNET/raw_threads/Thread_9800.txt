They already laid the OFC cables and terminated using one tejas mux and nemd it as the OFC room . so we had started our setup from the point where they have terminated their OFC in each stations using the Microtech media converter , which converts OFC to copper link. From there we laid OFC to one of the Booking counter in one station. Each Station has two booking counter one is nearer to the OFC room, i.e, where they have terminated their OFC link . From there we have connected one of the booking counter with the OFC and again we are using one Media converter to connect the switch ( DAX DX-5026MGV-AC) then from this switch another OFC is running to the other switch placed in the other booking counter.the OFC link between the two stations are connected using the transceiver. this is the setup in all the 23 stations. each booking counter has two switch they are interconnected by Patch cord each station is one VLAN. MY problem is that , Some times the OFC link goes down between two booking counters.after all the basic level troubleshooting i have removed the transceiver and found that its very heat and then i have placed the transceiver in the same port by connectin the OFC link. then I manually restart the switch. After that the link goes up and there is no issue .

I am guessing you think your problem resided in the SFP modules you insert into the switches. These modules seldom fail. I suspect it is a software issue with the negotiation between the switches. I would first when you get a failure log into your switches and see if you have error messages of any kind in the log. A actual failed module should produce a different error than you would see if it detected a issue with the light coming from the remote device. I would then disable and re-enable the port on each end. This will in effect reboot just that one port. If this resolves it I would look at things like speed/duplex/ flow control settings. Sometimes the AUTO option do not work correctly. To rule out a hardware failure you could of course swap out the module with a spare, you want to try this without rebooting the switch. These modules are hot swappable in most equipment. It is unlikely these devices themselves would get hot. You could in theory put too much light into one but that mostly just breaks it not overheats it. Just be sure you are using the correct modules for the distance you are going. You do not want to use the extended range ones on short fiber runs.
