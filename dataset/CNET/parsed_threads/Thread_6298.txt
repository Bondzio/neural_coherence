<s> just got a wireless notebook,acer5044,windows xp. </s>
<s> can sense and connect to wireless networks ok,,but then how do i find files on the other pc, also windows xp with a usb dongle wireless 802.11g. </s>
<s> and i am sensing a friends lap top 10 miles away from it?the laptops were a few feet away from eachother earlier in the day.is this some weird memory glitch? </s>
<s> The simplest thing to do is to get a WIRELESS-G ROUTER. </s>
<s> The router is an efficient way to connect computers to form a network. </s>
<s> After connecting with a network cable or wirelessly, you need set up FILE AND PRINTER SHARING to transfer files and share printers over your new network. </s>
<s> It's in HELP AND SUPPORT in your Start Menu. </s>
<s> Also, that network can, in turn, be connected to some type of Internet service through a broadband modem. </s>
<s> This enables all computers to share the Internet service. </s>
<s> Internet --- broadband modem --- wireless-g router &gt; &gt; &gt; computers KEY: --- wired &gt; &gt; &gt; wired and/or wireless * * * * * Another option is to connect the computers directly to one another via their wireless network adapters. </s>
<s> Google: AD HOC WIRELESS NETWORK. </s>
<s> You can also form an AD HOC NETWORK by connecting them with a ''crossover'' network cable. </s>
<s> Both of thes ad hoc network options are more complicated than just getting a wireless-g router. </s>
<s> * * * * * You don't sense the laptop that is 10 miles away. </s>
<s> You just see the connection profile that is stored in your computer because the computer sensed it or connected to it earlier. </s>
