it was late last night and i didn't think to look over forum rules.
i think my router setup is per the forum sticky, if i'm interpreting it correctly.
regardless, i did it exactly as d-link's setup cd instructed me to.
here it is: coaxial cable from wall to cable modem.
ethernet cable from desktop pc to lan port 1 on the router.
another ethernet cable from &quot;internet&quot; port on router back to cable modem.
i would show you a diagram but i can't find one on d-link's support site.
to answer your other questions: - i don't think anyone is pirating the connection.
i've checked this numerous times.
- i have reset the router many times so the settings are back to default, but i had set it to wpa-2 and secured the connection and it did not help.
- i have the most current firmware for the router.
- as for speed, normally my download speed runs between 5,000-6,000 kb/s but once the router is connected, that drops to around 1,200 kb/s on both the wired desktop pc and the wireless notebook.
i've measured it through the speed tests at broadbandreports.com.
i think that covers everything from the sticky...let me know if i can provide more information.
thanks.
