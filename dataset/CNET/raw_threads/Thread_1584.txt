Does anyone know what's wrong and how to fix this?

The power light stays on and even though DM sees it, it doesn't appear visible anywhere else on my notebook. A tech at WD told me it may need replacing, but with over 200GB of music data that will undoubtedly take a monumental effort to reaquire and organize again, I need an alternative desparately!

I realized that the drives worked just fine on the laptops, but when plugged into the desktop they would not even get recognized by the program. I discovered that the USB version on the laptops is 2.0 and that the desktop version was 1.0, the version of USB drives on the WD passport are 2.0. at the point WD will not work on the USB 1.0 versions and as far as I know there is no way to change the version of the software on the WD passports, if you find out anything else let me know.
