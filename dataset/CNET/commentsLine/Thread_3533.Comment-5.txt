i bought my pc new from an e-bay shop late last year and it has suddenly developed the same problem, only hissing noise heard from speakers and no other sounds at all, even when running sound test program all i hear is the same hissing noise!!
i am using an asus m2n-sli motherboard and connected to the onboard audio.
have done all the usual stuff (uninstalling and reinstalling the usb audio device, updated drivers, tried reinstalling from asus installation disc) even though there is no problem with the device showing in device manager.
can i add a new sound card to the motherboard or do i have to buy and fit a replacement motherboard as i am using the onboard audio??
all help appreciated.
