is one that fits on your computer.
for windows a usb-interface is fine, for apple a firewire-interface.
for a laptop, it's advisable it has it's own power supply (that's somewhat clumsy in use if you really want to use it at different places) or connect it via a powered usb-hub.
even a 2&quot; disk inside could be too power-hungry for a laptop usb-slot (but, just as well, it might work flawlessly).
you might consider to buy the enclosure and the disk separately and put it in yourself.
or you could buy an already assembled set.
for shops and prices: look around, either for a trusted local shop or a trusted internet shop.
whatever you prefer.
hope this helps.
