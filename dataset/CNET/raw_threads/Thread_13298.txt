Several times a day it loses DSL connection. AT&T Claims that everything outside the home is fine, and I live in an apartment and they claim everything inside the home is fine. Here are portions of logs I get. INF

Uncancelled Echo: 6.7 dB Suspicious - check phone filters and alarm Your post doesn't tell much about your knowledge of filters and that alarm system. 2. Any TORRENT use? 3. What happens if you turn off the wifi and get wired? Bob

No torrent use 3. I need to use wifi and don't have a ethernet cable to test this out at the moment. I read somewhere that sometimes it can mess up if it is maxing out bandwidth. How can I limit the bandwidth for downloads to test this out?

But my last idea is to get the ethernet for a test as well as secure your connection to WPA as well as change the RF channel. The Uncanceled Echo is still an nagging item. Since it can't hurt, plug two filters into nearby phone jacks. This will change the line impedance and let's see what happens. Bob
