I am looking to build a new desktop PC and looking to upgrade to an internal SATA drive. However, I am confused about the data transfer rate. Take a look at this ad from bestbuy.com; Hitachi - DeskStar 1TB Internal Hard Drive OA34915 Serial ATA interface; data transfer rates up to 3GB/sec.; 32MB cache buffer This is a cover page. When I click on the item detail; 1TB maximum storage capacity Serial ATA interface Data transfer rates up to 300MB/sec. 32MB cache buffer 7200 rpm for fast read/write times 8.5 ms average seek time PC compatible So, what is the data transfer rate of this drive - 3.0GB/sec or 300MB/sec? Can someone shed some light on this? Thank you.

So toss that out the window and go find BENCHMARKS on that hard disk. It's 3 gigabit per second or 300 megabyte per second. Sadly you'll find many typos all over so do a little research such as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA where they take the trouble of writing 3 Gbit per second and the upper/lower case typo won't strike them down.
