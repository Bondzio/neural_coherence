However, I am unable to play many games and I just noticed that most of the games I have bought say it needs Pentium III or faster processor. I can't figure out any of the information that I have looked at for the Turion processor but maybe it's not fast enough to play games? How can I solve this problem? Thanks for your help--Pups
