hey, i recently purchased shuttle xpc sd36gsm barebone system.
it only comes with a 250watt powersupply and shuttle only offers a 300watt psu to purchase.
i want to b able to run some decent hardware in this small system because i plan it to be my new main pc for gaming and everything else.
so my question for you is: is there any third party/other company that offers power supplys at least 400watts that can fit this system?
i hope to run a pentium d presler 3.4ghz, xfx 7900gt 520/1.5ghz, 2gb ddr2 ram, and the norm like dvd burner etc.
so does anyone know any third parties that offer psu's that fit this case?
or is there such thing as external powersupplies for these shuttle pc's?
if you can answer one or all of these questions please do and thankyou very much in advance!
