Hey all, I'm by no means a computer expert at all but would really appreciate the help if anyone can help me. I have a Compaq V 5305 WM, bought in late 2006. About a month ago, the computer was shutting down on its own after the fan would wheeze out of control. I took it to Circuit City and they told me the motherboard heats up and it's not supposed to and the computer shuts down for this reason. I wouldn't mind buying a new computer so I bought a hard drive enclosure to take the hard drive that contains my life around with me. But it just so happens that the computer is encrypted and the drive doesn't show up on any other computer, XP or otherwise. So I'm overseas now in Saudi Arabia. I can visit the states in October or take it to a tech here, but just from someone who is more experienced than I am, what exactly can I do, trying to fix a motherboard? He told me I would just have to replace it and I know everyone will say it is easier to just replace the computer, but I have so many programs and files and several of the older versions of the programs aren't in use anymore and can't be downloaded. And the rest of the computer is in premium shape, I took really good care of it while I had it. Is it very difficult to replace a motherboard? Will I risk losing functional ability of the computer trying to replace it? Obviously I will back up the hard drive to the best of my ability, moving files to external hard drive, using Recuva was one technique he mentioned, etc before attempting to fix it. But does it have any chance of being fixed? It is an AMD Sempron 3300+. Thanks a lot for your time and effort.

Might be a case where the CPU heatsink fan isn't functioning properly or has come loose in which case it isn't cooling properly. Which fan is wheezing out of control ? VAPCMD

There is only one fan I think, it's a laptop. Thanks for the help VAPCMD.

Thankfully they caught it soon enough. Here's what we did. We stripped it down to where we could pull off the CPU heatsink, cleaned off the compound, used new Artic Silver compound and buttoned it all back up cleaning off all vents and heatsinks as we went. It's much better now. Sadly, finding a good shop to do this may not be possible. Bob

But he said the fan/heatsink was fine, the motherboard itself is bad? I'm just wondering, when replacing a motherboard, can things go wrong? I don't mind purchasing a new one and finding a good technician to do it for me but I just want to know of the possible things that might go wrong... Thanks Bob for your input.

It's a trivial thing with lots of web pages showing pictures and more but the bottom line is it's a bit scary to those that can't afford to lose a machine. We've only lost a few but they were 5 year old laptops with brown areas on the board.
