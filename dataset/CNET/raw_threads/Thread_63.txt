Prior to this I would save any documents on floppies but now with digitial photos and program disks missing (not lost just temporarily misplaced), I wanted to be able to do a full backup. When I used the XP Backup Wizard I received an error stating that I could not create a file lager than 4GB due to FAT32 formatting on the external drive. My question is there someway around this in Backup; do I have to reformat the external drive in NTFS or do I have to buy 3rd party software? Thanks, Rick

I assume that if a virus struck my computer, that I could just reformat the hard drive, drag and drop back from my external drive and everything would work OK. I thought that MSBACKUP would compress everything and simplify the restore process. Rick
