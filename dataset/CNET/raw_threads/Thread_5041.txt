4066	0	197036	2119781	NR	Ermitao	8/8/06 12:00 PM	1.1550384E12	Freezing DVD's	I have a combo DVD read/writer: SAMSUNG DVD +-R/RW which was installed new in my PC just over 1 year ago. I have burnt many CD's and DVD's without any problems. Recently, most of the DVD's I burn, although they still play OK in my PC, they keep freezing when playing them in DVD machines, even in different machines. No problems with music CD's, only DVD's, regardless if + or -. Can this be due to wearing of the DVD writer? I have used CD/DVD lens cleaning kits but doesn't help. Can't be software related, as the DVD's play OK in the PC. Help / suggestions would be much appreciated.
