1.4.1	Actually I see many grievances with over 127GB drives and that many can't partition or format the drive.	St
1.4.2	More at http://www.48bitlba.com With the PC user base becoming more &quot;users&quot; than owners I'm seeing that most will have a basic issue and call the products bad.	St
1.4.3	They are right in one respect.	St
1.4.4	The product in its quest to lower costs does not include tutorials or basic troubleshooting.	St
1.4.5	Also some machines will not support such size drives.	St
1.4.6	The fallout is a top post like this.	St

1.5.1	i maybe the only who's gonna use the computer... atmost will be two users... the other one being a guest account..	St
1.6.1	Such devices do come with a warranty and the only pitfall I find today is that people expect hard disks to never fail or try to use them as backup.	St
1.6.2	As long as you can partition, format and keep your backups going, you'll do fine.	St

1.7.1	of buying either the 250 or the 500 is the same?	St
1.7.2	thanks for all the help... ill probbly get the 500gb...	Polite
1.8.1	Let's say I had 2 250GB or a single 500GB.	St
1.8.2	At first glance the risk of the 500GB looks to be twice as large since any small mistake by me or the OS or a power outage at the wrong moment will wipe out 500GB vs the chances with 2 250GB units might lose only 250GB.	St
1.8.3	Then again, having twice as many parts raises the possibility that problems may occur twice as often.	St
1.8.4	You can see where this is going.	St
1.8.5	-&gt; Here's the bottom line.	St
1.8.6	Hard disks are still temporary and fast storage.	St
1.8.7	If you can't lose something then you find backup medium such as DVDRW or other to have spare copies ready.	St

1.9.1	i guess ill get the 250gb and just get an external one.. i cant lose 500gb in a flash.... i got too many photos, videos, etc... but then again, i might change my decision again.. hehe thanks for all the info.. if theres still anything relevant thing i need to know bout, not necessarily just on hard drives, but in general about the imac intel core duo, i would appreciate it if u could let me know.	St
1.9.2	thanks...	St
