<s> Hi there, I wanto to upgrade my RAM memory in my laptop. </s>
<s> I own SONY VAIO EB. </s>
<s> Now I am running on 2x 2 GB DDR3 1066 MHz and want to upgrade to 2x4 GB [8 gb ram]. </s>
<s> Laptop model number: SONY VAIO VPCEB3S1E/BQ black Processor: Intel Core i5 460mm, 2,53 GHz 3 MB L3 Cache 2 cores, 4 threads Intel Turbo Boost 2,8 GHz Max TDP: 35 W I run WIN 7 Can you give my advices about brands or models of RAM MEMORYs which I should consider to buy? </s>
<s> Can you give me some tips for good online shops? </s>
<s> [I am from europe - shipping*] thanks. </s>
<s> Be sure you're laptop supports that sticks and that amount of RAM. </s>
<s> I didn't check. </s>
<s> So first visit www.crucial.com and enter the data of your laptop for advice about what it can have and what type you need. </s>
<s> I didn't do it for you. </s>
<s> Of course, 8 GB only makes sense if you have a 64-bit OS. </s>
<s> With a 32-bit OS the top 4 GB won't be used at all. </s>
<s> I can't give advice about makers and shops. </s>
<s> I've bought extra memory 2 times. </s>
<s> The first time at our local variant of craigslist, the second time in a local computer shop. </s>
<s> But that's not what you're looking for, I assume. </s>

<s> I expect little payback on this upgrade. </s>
<s> It certainly won't cure any complaints about GAMING or VIDEO SPEED. </s>
<s> Let's hope this laptop has the 64 bit OS. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you Kees for your advice. </s>
<s> I checked out crucial.com . </s>
<s> Great site for these kind of things. </s>
<s> I am already deciding about two types of memory. </s>
<s> They are prety the same but they differ with &quot;speed&quot; [first one PC3-8500 ; second one PC3-1060] and in frequency [first one 1066 and second one 1333]. </s>
<s> Does these parameters matter a lot? </s>
<s> Can I say, higher the better? </s>
<s> The price si same to the last cent. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Oh BTW, my OS is win 7, 64bit </s>
<s> I am going to use that extra RAM in CG aplications [Computer Graphic]. </s>
<s> I want to speed up my manipulating and rotation in viewport. </s>
<s> Number of polygons in my projects really increased since last semester, and it lags in big scenes. </s>
<s> Do you think that extra memory I want to buy can help me in this kind of issue? </s>
<s> I think it will do some better performence, but if it is worth of 100 euros. </s>
<s> What do you think? </s>
<s> My OS is 64bit. </s>
<s> The functions you noted are, in my experience governed by the speed of the GPU. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You should install the memory with maximum speed you can get for you laptop. </s>
<s> That will make a big difference in your computer speed. </s>
<s> Make sure you install identical pairs, which means same brand with same frequency. </s>
<s> Ram does not affect graphics that much but it makes difference. </s>
<s> Thanks MacWin Technology </s>
