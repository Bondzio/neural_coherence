i would like something reliable and that lasts, preferrably longer than 3 years.
my first pc from evesham lasted 5-6 years, but the one i bought from novatech only lasted 3 yrs when i paid about &#163;500 for it.
i want something more reliable than that and prefer to spend a little more to get something that works well.
i would like the internet to run reasonbly fast aswell, i don't like waiting
