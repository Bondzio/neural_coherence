In-built webcam is working, but mic is not. While installing software (drivers) from &quot;Webcam Resource CD&quot; it aborts after about 70% completion showing the following error: &quot;Cannot Install this Hardware there was a problem installing this hardware: (Logo) Monitor Webcam (SP2208WFP) An error occurred during installation of the device A service installation section in this INF is invalid Click Finish to close the wizard [Finish]&quot; I have searched Dell site but could not find any suitable driver. It may please be noted that my OS is Windows XP Pro SP2. Anybody in the know please help me in finding proper driver and activate mic. I can do with headphone, but I want to use in-built mic.

Keep in mind that some members confuse a monitor driver for the need of a display card driver. I'm sharing the poor soul that spent 6 months looking for a Dell display driver and we solved the issue in 5 minutes by installing the card driver. Bob
