<s> I have a home wireless network that works great in some areas and not so great in others, (slow or drops connection) I added a wireless access point which improved but would like to add another to expand.I have no problems connecting until I reach a certain point in my property line. </s>
<s> Will access points connect to each other or does an access point have to connect to a router? </s>
<s> I have a Belkin router and Access Point with DSL. </s>
<s> but to be used in a school with two floors, a long hallway and cinder block walls. </s>
<s> Look into clustering or WDS. </s>
<s> From what I'm reading you might be better off with access points of the same brand and model that can operate in these modes. </s>
<s> With WDS, only one device needs to be wired and the others can act as repeaters. </s>
<s> There are limitations and pitfalls, however. </s>
<s> repeaters, do so. </s>
<s> Read up about signal degradation, simplex, etc before committing. </s>
<s> RF don't travel well through dense walls and floors. </s>
<s> You are better off bouncing signals off hard surfaces. </s>
<s> However that can create dead zones, so look into MIMO. </s>
<s> Practically any brand's MIMO point can handle a 2000+ sq. </s>
<s> ft. home with ease. </s>
<s> For your school, can't you pull cable to other end of hallway and use a POE point? </s>
<s> I posted a question about that a while back. </s>
<s> We'd need a midspan or switch capable of providing the power. </s>
<s> Our short list of hardware includes a few 3Com 7760 PoE capable APs and either a 3Com or US Robotics PoE switch in the lower price ranges. </s>
<s> Pulling more Cat 5 isn't a problem but finding AC outlets at the best locations for the APs is. </s>
<s> That's why PoE is being considered. </s>
<s> Only recently did funds turn up to plan in earnest. </s>
<s> I appreciate your mentioning problems with repeaters. </s>
<s> I'm not an IT guy and, as a volunteer, I want stuff that works without a lot of care and feeding. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the current batch of laptops at the school that would benefit from a wireless hot spot feature a bunch of 802.11 &quot;a&quot;s which travel in a cart that carries it's own AP with it that needs to be plugged into the classroom ports for use. </s>
<s> What we implement will need to be as compatible as possible with what we already have to live with unless a money tree appears in the school yard. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> I don't want to hijack this thread and I hope such discussion will be useful to originator. </s>
<s> There's plenty to read on this common issue. </s>
<s> Reading http://kbserver.netgear.com/kb_web_files/n101236.asp and similar from the other makers this is easy once you know how. </s>
<s> In closing did you put your router in the basement? </s>
<s> or the money tree hasn't sprouted yet due to a never ending winter (Phil did say 6 more weeks, which should be ending this Saturday! </s>
<s> ), here is a device you might consider http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps6973/ps8382/product_data_sheet0900aecd806b7c5c.html </s>
<s> This cost of this device, however, would fetch 5 of the 3Com units. </s>
<s> It doesn't list the PoE standard either but I do think Cisco makes their own power injectors for some models. </s>
<s> No doubt it has features and management capabilities that wouldn't be used in this school....partially because no one there would know how. </s>
<s> It's nice to think big but we need to live with reality. </s>
<s> It's not a big school...K-8 with a capacity of about 250 kids plus the staff. </s>
<s> I'm hoping to get by with 3 or 4 APs and a small capacity but rack mountable switch that can power them. </s>
<s> I'm hoping to propose we can do the project for under $1500. </s>
<s> I can get a spool of Cat-5 donated so that will help. </s>
<s> but make sure you evaluate the effectiveness of one before committing to more. </s>
<s> XR is an improvement for a/b/g but it isn't as good as MIMO. </s>
<s> There are some MIMO-XR units in the market but they are from small companies. </s>
<s> If you choose it, again make sure their firmware supports features that you need. </s>
<s> Good luck in your project. </s>
