... but you're probably correct, ahtoi, but please note that, IMHO, &quot;people&quot; are noted for buying (and doing) what makes no sense at all.
This world needs Firewire about as much as a teenager needs pimples.
But... a fancy title has sold an awful pile of garbage (books, music groups, vaporware, software... you name it.)
Most people have not been taught the skills necessary to critically analyze what they see, hear or read.
Which is likely the MAIN reason for the global ECONOMIC catastrophe we all face today.
More FIREWIRE!!!!
