1.1.1	Hi, I need your help...	St
1.1.2	I have a SATA raid card from sunix.	St
1.1.3	I made (2008!)	St
1.1.4	a RAID1.	St
1.1.5	But today I accidentally delete the RAID1 from the card's BIOS utillity configuration!!!	St
1.1.6	The PC does not boot!!!!!!!!!	St
1.1.7	HELP.	St
1.1.8	I have all my data inside the disks...	St
1.1.9	I made new raid 1 configuration but nothing.	St
1.1.10	It shows that RAID1 is GOOD and after that nothing...	St
1.2.1	Unless SUNIX supplies a recovery method I strongly suggest you goto http://www.drivesavers.com next.	St
1.2.2	That is, unless you have all you need on backup.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I search for a disk recovery in internet and was ok... (unfortunately I have to make a new windows installation)	St
1.4.1	Because RAID 1 recovery is very unsure and unsafe to the files on the RAID 1 set.	St
1.4.2	If you had not mentioned RAID I would have linked to the CNET Storage Forum &quot;Lost and Found&quot; sticky top post where there are many recovery titles for free and free to try.	St
1.4.3	But your post had RAID so I have to defer to the safest methods.	St
1.4.4	I can't help people destroy their last copy of their files.	St
1.4.5	Hope you understand, Bob	St
1.5.1	Because yours is RAID 1 (mirror) you could get lucky as long as the BIOS removal did not state all data would be lost.	St
1.5.2	What you might try is to remove one drive (they'd both be identical), and change the the BIOS to allow standard drive use rather than RAID.	St
1.5.3	If it would not boot, you could try to fix the MBR.	Sug
1.5.4	I can say I've had better luck with RAID on SATA than IDE ports when it comes to fixing broken RAID arrays.	St
1.5.5	I stopped using these a while back and never used RAID 0 as it's an accident waiting to happen.	St
1.5.6	RAID 1 is slightly more forgiving.	St
1.5.7	Good luck.	St
