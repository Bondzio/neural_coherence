<s> Good afternoon, everyone. </s>
<s> I'm having some issues with my USB ports not functioning. </s>
<s> The issue began after I turned off my desktop in order to install a new memory card. </s>
<s> After I installed the memory card and reconnected everything I went ahead and turned on my desktop as usual this is when I noticed my mouse and keyboard weren't functioning. </s>
<s> I've turned off my PC for several minutes, left it on for several minutes and tried all 12 USB ports and not a single one is working. </s>
<s> At this point I'm not sure what else I could do as every other remedy I've found online involves actually being able to use my keyboard and mouse. </s>
<s> If anybody has any suggestions I'd really appreciate it. </s>
<s> Try a generic reset. </s>
<s> Unplug everything from the PC desktop. </s>
<s> EVERYTHING. </s>
<s> Press and hold the power button for one minute, release and then plug in ONLY what's needed. </s>
<s> See if it comes back. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply Bob. </s>
<s> Yeah I tried that as well I unplugged everything from my PC and reset it, I've actually reset it a few times. </s>
<s> When I plug in my optical mouse for example the red light on the bottom of the mouse will blink very quickly and turn back off. </s>
<s> However, if I plug it into the USB port about half way the light fully turns on and then flashes on and off every three seconds or so. </s>
<s> It just seems to strange that every USB port was working perfectly fine and all of a sudden all 12 aren't working. </s>
<s> Again, remove all external things and power then try the usual open the case and gently but firmly unplug and plug all cables and cards back in. </s>
<s> I you find a dust convention, it may be time to get outside and use a few shots of canned air. </s>
<s> The dust control will not fix this but I've reseated far too many cables and cards to write more than I always try that. </s>
<s> Again, so little is told about the machine that I can't comment about power supply ratings, bad caps or much else. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yeah I've done that as well, opened the case dusted it gently with pressurized air can etc the machine itself is running Windows 7 on an i7 core 16gigs ram it has a 550 PSU. </s>
<s> Anything else that I could provide you with? </s>
<s> At the moment I have it turned on with just the keyboard and mouse plugged in. </s>
<s> I've also hear that it could be that the computer isnt recognizing the USB devices plugged in and so it's not feeding them power is that correct? </s>
<s> But given such slim details I can't make any good guesses. </s>
<s> 550 Watts may be very slim for a gamer computer, that is if it has one of those video cards. </s>
<s> But look at the details. </s>
<s> No make, model, etc. </s>
<s> But let's try something. </s>
<s> Did you install a new PCI USB 2.0 card and see if that works? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Let me look up the details and I'll get back to you on that one. </s>
<s> I was thinking the same thing in regards to the power unit, I'll probably be replacing it sooner than later as I do use it for gaming. </s>
<s> I also unplugged the front facing USB ports from within the PC itself and that didn't work either. </s>
<s> I was also thinking of simply replacing the front facing ports those do connect via a PCI bus as opposed to the back ones which are connected directly to the MB correct? </s>
<s> device manager to see if there's any evidence of USB port issues there. </s>
<s> I've had USB port failures related to the southbridge component. </s>
<s> What I was able to note physically was that it got uncomfortably hot to the touch. </s>
<s> That shouldn't happen. </s>
<s> It did seem to occur while either inserting or withdrawing a USB device. </s>
<s> I decided to blame it on ESD for lack of a better reason. </s>
<s> I was able to buy an add in card to gain USB function but the MB failed entirely within the next couple of months. </s>
<s> Check device manager for USB problems. </s>
<s> Well that's the problem since I can't use the keyboard and mouse there's really no way for me to do anything else other than what I've already done. </s>
<s> Tried again this morning and it's still not working. </s>
<s> I think I'm going to have to pay my local tiger direct a visit. </s>
<s> When I see this issue I usually boot up a live CD called UBUNTU to test the machine. </s>
<s> That lets me know if this is a hardware issue without installing any OS. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You could borrow PS2 kb and try that. </s>
<s> The single PS2 port which it has is also fried. </s>
<s> I ended up replacing the front facing USB ports and they're now working, however now the DVI connectors aren't working which leads me to either the graphics card or the MB. </s>
<s> I'm trying to find a mother board online so I could replace it however I'm unable to find the exact one my PC has. </s>
<s> It's equipped with an MSI MS 7673 MB. </s>
<s> I'm also trying to find another compatible MB in any case however I'm not having any luck on that front either. </s>
<s> Maybe this is some HP and you are worried about the &quot;tattoo&quot; but I don't see anything special about this motherboard. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I think I've found a motherboard that would work through the MSI website. </s>
<s> Still not 100% sure since this is the first time I'm attempting to do this. </s>
<s> All that usually happens is the OS will need to be reloaded along with drivers. </s>
<s> REMEMBER that I never found the make/model of this PC. </s>
<s> It would be a shame to find how this is a HP or other machine because we could head off a common headache. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Here's the specifics on the computer. </s>
<s> Model # SYX P67A C43 Serial # 107478106. </s>
<s> I'm left to guess this is some home/shop made PC. </s>
<s> The only possible gotcha is the OS. </s>
<s> OEM versions may fail when the motherboard is replaced. </s>
<s> Worst case is you buy another copy. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> http://www.systemaxpc.com/ Should I try and find the exact same MB as the current one or simply find one that is compatible? </s>
<s> This is actually the exact PC I have. </s>
<s> http://www.productshippingcenter.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1277082&Sku=SYX-1113 </s>
<s> I just found the exact same MB that my PC has through Tiger Direct for $120. </s>
<s> http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=7325818&CatId=6978 </s>
<s> So I replaced the mother board and everything is working now. </s>
<s> However, when I'm trying to reinstall the OS I'm getting an error that the HDD isn't installed. </s>
<s> The computer has a 1TB Seagate Barracuda, it has three different plus however only one of cables fits, the other 2 ports I don't have a cable for. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> I've seen that when the SATA ports are set to RAID in the BIOS. </s>
<s> It's a custom install where we feed drivers and maybe more. </s>
<s> I strongly suggest folk not do this if they are not deeply familiar with PCs and Windows. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Win7 should work but I'll presume you have XP and it doesn't recognize SATA drives with BIOS set to &quot;Enhanced&quot; or &quot;ACHI&quot; modes. </s>
<s> You either set the BIOS to IDE mode (which might be called PATA or &quot;Legacy&quot;) or you have the motherboard's 3rd party driver handy while pressing F6 when asked during the installation. </s>
<s> XP installs only accept floppy disks for these drivers. </s>
<s> You'd have to rely on your motherboard driver package to have this disk or for the CD ROM to have the &quot;makedisk&quot; utility which can create a floppy for the enhanced mode drivers. </s>
