<s> Hello, I have a Netgear WPN824 router with two PCs hardwired and a laptop (all xp home) and pocket PC on wireless. </s>
<s> I own a web design company, and I am online all day every day. </s>
<s> All other websites that I have browsed work fine. </s>
<s> (travel sites included) My problem is that I can get to the Expedia.com website, but cannot actually perform a search for a flight or a hotel or anything. </s>
<s> I could before I installed the router. </s>
<s> This is frustrating, because I use Expedia a lot, and I need to see the site. </s>
<s> The site just hangs in my browser, or I get Page Cannot Be Displayed.... </s>
<s> I called Netgear customer support three times, and each time they had me reduce the MTU size on the router settings. </s>
<s> I have done as they asked. </s>
<s> The current setting for the MTU is 1250. </s>
<s> I still cannot get Expedia to work. </s>
<s> Does anyone know how I can adjust this to make it work? </s>
<s> OR If not, please do not recommend LinkSys, but what else? </s>
<s> Is there a brand that anyone would suggest I try? </s>
<s> This is frustrating. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> But then again I would scan the machine with EWIDO and post what BHOs are installed. </s>
<s> What's a BHO? </s>
<s> Please ask google.com Bob PS. </s>
<s> Just funning you about Linksys. </s>
<s> Netgear has a problem with Microsoft sites. </s>
<s> Had the same problem with MSN.Game.Zone with same useless Netgear suggestions. </s>
<s> You may get it to work but it will intermitantly drop your connection, not good for playing games with others. </s>
<s> Finally gave up and got a D-Link which works fine. </s>
<s> That is a sign of the GOds. </s>
<s> they might really like you. </s>
<s> EXPEDIA can ruin your trip , even if they didnt before. </s>
<s> EXPEDIA is in listed the top ripoff link at the bad business bureau ( http://www.ripoffreport.com ) and has two &quot;dedicated&quot; websites due to poor customer support and lies: http://www.victimsofexpedia.com and http://www.shameonexpedia.com kind regards </s>
<s> What do you mean by Microsoft site? </s>
<s> Do you mean ASP pages and such? </s>
<s> D-Link...ok might give it a try. </s>
<s> Hope it has a better range than this Netgear too. </s>
<s> This one boasts 500 feet. </s>
<s> Baloney. </s>
<s> Not even 50. </s>
<s> Crap all the way around. </s>
<s> BUT, I can see all of MY websites, which my LinkSys would not, depending on the day of the week and the weather outside, and what I had for dinner last night. </s>
<s> One step forward...two steps back. </s>
<s> Thanks for the input, both of you. </s>
<s> I will just keep buying routers until I find one with no behavior issues. </s>
<s> Cheers! </s>
<s> But, Expedia's horrible service has kindly provided me with a $200 coupon for our next flight purchase. </s>
<s> This to make up for *&(#*#*&ing our last trip up. </s>
<s> So I have to use them to get my $200. </s>
<s> Otherwise, I would be buying DIRECT from ICELAND AIR. </s>
<s> Great people, decent food, nice little stop-over to strech the legs and grab a cig then off to destination. </s>
<s> Thanks for posting! </s>
