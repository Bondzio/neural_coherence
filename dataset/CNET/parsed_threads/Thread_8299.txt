<s> My computer is very loud and noisey.. </s>
<s> It make a humming sound most of the time, but then other times it can be so noisy you can hear it from downstairs. </s>
<s> How can I make it silent, or at least close to. </s>
<s> I have an Asus P5GD1 motherboard (intel P4 HT with 3.2GHz), 1GB of DDR RAM, 200 GB S-ATA 7200rpm 8MB Hard Drive,ATX Med Tower Case with 400W power, LiteOn 16X Double Layer DVD +/- RW, Asus PCI Exp Powered by ATI X300 w/126MB, and im running Windows XP Home Edition. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Most likely all that noise is coming from the case fan I just build a sempron based system with the help from my cousin. </s>
<s> The cpu fan is really quiet, so I'm assuming it is coming from the case. </s>
<s> Lets say it is the cpu fan or the case fan or both you do have the option of using watercooling devices this site has a good how to about purchasing and installing a watercooling device if that is not your cup of tea then i would get something in between an internal liquid fan. </s>
<s> You might want to check the section about watercooling and check it out. </s>
<s> I was thinking about doing it myself but I don't have the guts to do it myself. </s>
<s> In all liklyhood, a fan or two maybe getting old. </s>
<s> Its either worn down or so dust cluttered its become unblanced. </s>
<s> That alone willl wear a fan down and cause the bearing and blades to be too noisy. </s>
<s> The only true cure is to replace. </s>
<s> Open side cover or system casea and find any fans causing problems and replace. </s>
<s> -OR- find tyhe noise source and proceed from there. </s>
<s> Buy a &quot;quality&quot; fan and install them. </s>
<s> Google for fan sources, plus make sure your power supply hasn't goner bonkers as well, it's not readily seen so check it too. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> three words: Zalman! </s>
<s> Zalman! </s>
<s> Zalman! </s>
<s> replace all of your case fans and cpu fan with Zalman heatsinks and fans. </s>
<s> They specialize in silent air cooling for your PC. </s>
<s> If you felt comfortable doing so you could also go the watercooling route, but that would be much more expensive and require a pretty high comfort level on your part, tinkering with the insides of your computer. </s>
<s> So in short: for the novice to intermediate computer builder I'd suggest Zalman air cooling, for advanced users with more cash to spend then go watercooling </s>
<s> Thanks everyone for your help! </s>
<s> Yes Zalman is teh win and is full of sexy. </s>
<s> ooh all copper heat sinks. </s>
<s> Powersupplies make a bit of noise as well. </s>
<s> i dont know about anyone else but i like RoseWill for power supply units </s>
