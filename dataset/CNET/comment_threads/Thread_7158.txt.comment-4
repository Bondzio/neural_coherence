my computer/properties/system restore and select &quot;settings&quot;.
You can't do that?
I'm not sure if it makes a difference.
I know that if I unplug a drive and use another USB port for it, Windows sees it as a new drive and gives it a different drive letter.
It also turns on system restore for that drive by default.
I can't figure why it thinks its a new drive.
Does your BIOS ID the drive?
If not, I would wonder if Windows forgets it saw it once and shuts off sharing.
