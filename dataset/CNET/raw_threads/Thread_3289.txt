My video card is 3 yrs old but works very well with my current monitor. What card would you recommend I upgrade to or is it necessary. The monitor will probably run around 400 so I don't want to spend too much or I might as well just buy a new computer. thank in advance.Roy

I'll go ahead and say that when getting a 19&quot; LCD screen, be very careful. Make sure to buy one with a response time of under 16ms, or else you'll get major ghosting in-game, as most 19&quot; LCD monitors do. I'm assuming you have a mid-range to weak computer, so I'll suggest a 9600XT
