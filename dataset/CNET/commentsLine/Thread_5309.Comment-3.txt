first of all find an air compressor and clean that out.
it will make it much easier to look at.
on the motherboard there should be one or two pieces of metal that look like radiators.
the larger one next to the ram at the top of the case near the power supply is the the cpu fan.
check to make sure that it is plugged in.
it is a little three prong plug on the motherboard that the fan plugs into.
if the fan plugs into a molex connecter (like the kind that power your hard drives) you can bypass the cpu sensor by bending the pins on cpu fan plug on the motherboard together.
if the fan does not spin during the boot then just replace the fan itself with any fan you want.
the fan should measure 40 mm across.
you can put any fan you want in there.
