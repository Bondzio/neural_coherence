<s> I had a computer that died a few years ago (motherboard). </s>
<s> I have kept the HDD (has XP sp1 installed) around because there is some data on it that I want to keep. </s>
<s> I built a new computer with Vista installed, and I threw this old HDD into it to recover the stuff I wanted off it. </s>
<s> I'm able to access the HDD, but I can't open any files or copy any files out of the &quot;owner&quot; folder because I don't have admin permissions on the drive. </s>
<s> I'm assuming this is because the admin name/password on my new computer are different than on the one this HDD was in. </s>
<s> I don't remember the password or admin name of that old computer either...I might be able to guess it, but when I go into the security properties it only gives me the options to select my current user acct or my current admin acct. </s>
<s> I was wondering if there is a way to trick it into just letting me copy the files off and accessing them on the HDD with Vista on it, cause right now I can't even copy them. </s>
<s> Use these. </s>
<s> XP TAKE OWNERSHIP </s>
<s> I appreciate it. </s>
<s> That's such a simple process. </s>
<s> I actually got it off with no problems using Zero Assumption Recovery. </s>
<s> I previously bought this program to recover data off a WD Worldbook that died. </s>
