<s> I have a relatively old but to date smooth running PC. </s>
<s> OS XP SP3 2GB DDR400 ram, AMD sempron 3000 processor, Gigabyte K8 Triton motherboard. </s>
<s> The system was hand made from all new parts with exeption of the tower & power supply. </s>
<s> I have 2 issues with hard drives. </s>
<s> 1. internal WD 1TB sata drive displayed in disk management list as online (errors) Healthy (at risk). </s>
<s> Occasionally when I start up, once at desktop I get the message sata disk failed so I restart and watch as the machine runs through the list of hardware devices and general info only to find that it does not find my drive in question so I restart and restart until the drive is recognised and from there it works fine. </s>
<s> Does this mean that the drive is about to crash or that there is a way I can fix these problems. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I plugged a brand new WD elements 1TB external drive to my pc installed as per instructions and all was fine until the next time i started my machine. </s>
<s> It would not boot to desktop no matter how many times I restarted even after changing USB ports. </s>
<s> So I disconnected it altogether and restarted again starting in safe mode not really sure where the issue lay and did a system restore to earlier date and got the message that any changes I made to the drive would not be save as it was not managed by system restore. </s>
<s> I have since plugged this drive to my laptop with no issues whatsoever. </s>
<s> Soory fo the longwinded explanation but I thought that as much info as possible would be relevant. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance </s>
<s> I suspect that 1TB disk is newer SATA and maybe even your older MB is having problems with its size. </s>
<s> You might see if your drive has jumpers to scale back to &quot;legacy&quot; SATA speeds or you might just try using a small drive. </s>
<s> Of course basic PC maintenance such as cleaning out the dust and reseating connections won't hurt. </s>
<s> Make sure you PS is up to the task as well. </s>
<s> I've never had much luck with giant HDs in old machines. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Type XP SATA at google and some thousands are having issues. </s>
<s> This old OS is not up to speed on SATA. </s>
<s> The problems are many and it is best you keep it fed with parts and interfaces that were around back then. </s>
<s> The most common workaround is setting the BIOS to IDE emulation but there was no standard there so no one knows if your machine can do that. </s>
<s> To add more trouble, if your original XP install was &quot;XP&quot;, &quot;XP SP1&quot; then troubles are too common as the base OS was pre-127GB or pre-SATA days. </s>
<s> Some have a problem with an OS's passing. </s>
