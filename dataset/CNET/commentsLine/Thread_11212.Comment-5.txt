i don't know those brands/models but what i've done is use two aps in bridge mode.
as i recall, i needed to enter their mac addresses from each to the other.
in bridge mode, however, clients cannot connect so you'd need another ap to broadcast the signal.
my i've only needed to do this once and the remote bridge went to a switch and the that end of the network was wired.
in any event...and from the drawing...you're connecting two network legs via a wireless bridge so i'm presuming that copper is not an option.
