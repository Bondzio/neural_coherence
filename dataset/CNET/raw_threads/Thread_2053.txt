Is there a way to turn on drive letters for external devices? The cd-rom shows as d: but the usb doesn't automatically turn up as any letter. I can see the flash drive in the device manager but I don't see the letter.

Change the drive letter of your CD drive to something else. Right click on My Computer--&gt;Manage Click on Disk Management under Storage Right click on your CD Drive--&gt; Change Drive letter and Path. Click on Change and change the letter to somthing else (E).
