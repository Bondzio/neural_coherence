Does anyone know what the problem could be the laptop that I have a wireless connection is doing the same thing. Before I bought the wireless router I had a hard wired router and I thought maybe it would work if I put it back on and it does the same exact thing. Maybe its my computer or I dont know. If anyone can help me out I would appreciate it. I connected my cable modem directly to my computer without the router and it works fine no problems. It only happens when I have the router connected. Just to let you know I have a D-Link DI-604 and DI-524(wireless) routers. Thanks. Ray

I don't know if I mentioned it but the power in our house went out and after that it started giving me problems. Do you think replacing the ethernet cables would work? Thanks
