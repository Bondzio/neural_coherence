If by chance the files were transfered to the 80 gig by a Take two back up cd made with a program such as Take Two the back up program would partition and format the drive to be exactly the size of the originating drive. I've seen this happen many times. An easy check is to run fdisk on the 80 gig and choose show partitions. You'll see usage thats not 100%. If that turns out to be the case, hook up the 80 gig as slave with the 40 gig as master and use a program like Ghost to transfer over only the contents drive to drive. Make sure you run fdisk and then format the 80 first to be absolutly sure you have the whole 80 gig back. Thought this might be the cause also. Bill

Most hdd's come with an Instal disk and instructions, then some don't. Some times the Bios will only see a hdd of a say 40 gig. to get it to recognise the other 40 gig you will have to put a hdd overlay on it. That (tricks) this bios into seeing the intire hdd. Even then you will still lose 1-3 gigs from the new hdd as they always do. Then do the FILE copy. If you copy the hdd it will show up as 40 again. You can go to the manufaturer's web site and go to support,then down load's, and look up your hdd to get the install 3.5 disk. That will have the overlay with it. GOOD LUCK
