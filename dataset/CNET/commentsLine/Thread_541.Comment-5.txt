my tv is a samsung led 40b7000 that plays (via usb) every format i use from avi to mkv, from sd to 1080p.
everything is perfect via usb... it also plays those same formats via ethernet (dlna) but with minor glitches (depending on the network load) and 2 huge limitations on the media player itself: 1) the tv doesn't allow to use a folder-based-view, it ignores the folder structure and presents every file as if they were all in the root dir.
...bye bye &quot;tvshows/lost/season6/hd/*&quot; 2) the tv doesn't allow to ff/rw or even pause in some cases which is a huge pain... that's why i started looking for a nas with both connections.. for all the benefits of a nas but also to use it as a usb device for the limited-network-capability-tv...
