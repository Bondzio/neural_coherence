Hi, I bought a Sony DVD(burner) drive and I hook up to my workstation.
Some times my XP pro recognizing the drive and most of the times it is not recognzing.
I can't see the drive in File explorer.
When I go to the Safe mode I was able to see.
Right now it is not working and I was frustrated why it is not recognizing.
Pls help me out with this.
Thanks
