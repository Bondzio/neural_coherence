1.1.1	my nephew here was playing with kitchen magnets.	St
1.1.2	found it funny on the 'puter screen (viewsonic p95f+, excellent).	St
1.1.3	now there are like shadowsat certain points and i've degaussed sev.	St
1.1.4	times and theyre still there.	St
1.1.5	look like smoke.	St
1.1.6	any cheap and easy way of fixing this?	St
1.1.7	wouldn't wanna lose this excel.	St
1.1.8	screen even if five years have past.	St
1.1.9	ty.	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	But outside of a more power degausser and time there is no real cure.	St
1.3.2	Bob	St
1.4.1	Visit a few local tv repair shops.	St
1.4.2	When you find one with an old gray headed tech explain your problem.	St
1.4.3	He'll know what your talking about.	St
1.4.4	It may take a little time for him to locate his vintage degauss coil but that should work.	St
1.4.5	He got a lot of practice with it back in the 60's.	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	Had it happen here with one of those high strength neodynium magnets and a 27 inch tv set.	St
1.6.2	I had a tape head demagnetiser which managed to knock most of the magnetic field out of the mask after quite a few passes.	St
1.6.3	They're pretty weak when it comes to degaussing something like this, but after a month, the built in degaussing coil finally cleared the residual magnetism.	St
1.7.1	Since I no longer do TV repairs, I don't have my trusty deguassing coil.	St
1.7.2	Instead I (carefully) use my soldering gun.	St
1.7.3	The transformer part makes a good geguassing coil.	St
1.7.4	Just don't burn anything with the tip!	St
1.8.1	I know both my crt's including a 10 year old princeton have an automatic demagnetizing function that can be activated from it's control menu.	St
1.8.2	Or my newer samsung I think does it automatically every power on.	St
1.8.3	Don't know if yours can but might be easier than taking apart and degaussing.	St
