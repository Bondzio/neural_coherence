<s> I have an ActionTec Router (56mbps USB) connected to my PC for my Internet connection. </s>
<s> Then I use a Cat5 cable from the router to my Mac in another room. </s>
<s> That gets me Internet and Network to the PC. </s>
<s> I can't seem to get the printer in the other room working from the Mac. </s>
<s> I have a Dell PC(OS- XP)and Mac G5 (OSX 3.9) </s>
<s> I've lost count how troublesome USB to router connections can be. </s>
<s> Why repeat that lesson? </s>
<s> Do I need to find the address for the printer? </s>
<s> It seems like so many choices on the Mac. </s>
<s> It will cost about how much to switch over to wireless? </s>
<s> I don't think I can afford right now. </s>

<s> installed on the Mac? </s>
<s> Bob was suggesting that you get rid of the USB connection from your PC to the Router and use Ethernet cable instead. </s>

<s> I have the drivers. </s>
<s> If I run the ethernet cable from the modem to the PC, where do I plug the ethernet cable to go to my Mac? </s>
<s> The modem only has 1 ethernet connection. </s>
<s> Let's take your word that you have a router with a single Ethernet port. </s>
<s> In that case any Ethernet Hub will do. </s>
<s> Connect it like this: Internet -&gt; ActionTec Router -&gt; Hub -&gt; PC+Macs. </s>

<s> and plug the modem into it and then plug both the computers, via ethernet, into the router. </s>
<s> Makes for a much more stable network and allows both machines to operate independently of each other and without the requirement to have the PC always on. </s>
