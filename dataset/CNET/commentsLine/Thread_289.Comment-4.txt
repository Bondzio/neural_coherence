thanks for the help guys but i actually got it.
i had to install the nwlink ipxspxnetbios compatible transport protocol on the laptop.
as soon as i did that, they all found each other and they were all able to &quot;talk&quot; to each other.
once i found that, it took me 10 seconds to fix it.
pretty frustrating when it is something that simple and i was looking for the answer for a week, but at least it's fixed and so far it seems to be working well.
thanks again, tracy
