Thanks for the info.
I live in the USA.
Are you saying that any socket 939 will work on that Motherboard?
I did find one processor AMD-Athlon 64 Single Core 3500+ Processor-2.2GHz-34p1044 from a vendor.
It is a step up but if I can get a faster one that is compatible I'm open to that too.
This is a hand-me-down computer that I thought might make a good DVR but I do need at least 2.2 GHz to do the job from what Hauppage says.
