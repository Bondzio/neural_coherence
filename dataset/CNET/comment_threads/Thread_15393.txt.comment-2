You should have 4 slots.
For dual channel support, you populate in pairs....same spec RAM in each color coded slot.
It would probably be best to have all the same and these are generally offered in matched pairs.
As such, you would need 2 matched 2 gig pairs (which is the same as saying 4 1 gig modules.
That would max your PC and make your wallet much lighter as well.
