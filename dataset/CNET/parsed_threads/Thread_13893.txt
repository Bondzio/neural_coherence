<s> Hello, I have a computer with a graphics card which allows for hdmi and DVI outputs, there is no vga port on it. </s>
<s> However, on my motherboard there is a VGA port which has a cover blocking it (placed by the Manufacturer, HP). </s>
<s> I have tried simply connecting a monitor to this port but it is not recognized. </s>
<s> I cant find any settings on the computer to use this on board port. </s>
<s> is there something I am missing, or is it simply not possible. </s>
<s> I am trying to be able to have dual screen monitors, without having to use the HDMI port. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Check settings in the BIOS Setup. </s>
<s> On-board VGA may have been disabled. </s>
<s> I looked at all the settings in the bios, and there is no option to enable or disable it. </s>
<s> there is an option to select the primary output...if i select this, will it disable my graphics card (which i would prefer be my primary)? </s>
