Thanks Bob--I'll give the worm scan a try.
I've already used chkdsk quite a few times, and although I think it works initially, the problem always seems to come back, or it's not being fixed at all by chkdsk.
I even tried re-installing XP, and uninstalling, then re-installing my firewall software (ZoneAlarm Pro).
That's what made me think of a failing hard disk.
Do you think that may be possible?
Thanx, Scott
