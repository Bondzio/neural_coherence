I have searched high and low for a straight answer but I can't seem to work out how to create a home wireless network in my house. I don't know whether it's so easy it's not published anywhere or whether I'm missing something or what but I can't find what I think I'm looking for and it's so common I feel embarassed. So I turn to you guys. Apologies if you think I'm an idiot but please help me out, I am for real. I have a PC running Windows XP upstairs with a wireless adapter. If a machine is to act as like a server then this is the one I'd want it to be. Downstairs I have a Netgear wireless router which is plugged into my DSL line, acting as the modem my crappy ISP gave me for free. With an ethernet cable I have my Xbox plugged in to this. Then I also roam the house with a laptop running Windows Vista. Oh and my flat mate also has a laptop running Windows XP. All I want to do is set up a home network, wireless of course, that enables me to see all devices (PC, laptop, and Xbox) on the network, from each machine. I want to be able to transfer files between machines over the network and be able to communicate with my Xbox from my PC or laptop. I would also like my flat mate to be able to tap into the network when he likes so we can transfer files between our computers. I plan on hooking up a printer to the router at a later stage for shared printing too. That's it. That's all I want to do. Is that so hard? So what I'm after is a step-by-step guide on configuring this. If someone could point me in the right direction I would be eternally grateful. Thanks for your time

I hope this explains that issue well enough for you. As to your issue today, you omitted the part names, models, makes, how it's connected so there is little more I can offer except to note that the usual cause of not seeing file and printer shares are FIREWALL settings.

If you look to the top of this forum http://forums.cnet.com/5204-7589_102-0.html?forumID=62 Networking & wireless we have a forum sticky about suggested settings. Your router maker's web site will have the manuals and more guides. Bob
