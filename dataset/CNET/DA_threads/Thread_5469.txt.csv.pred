1.2.1	Does the BIOS list your drives ?	Ques
1.2.2	If not , then Windows wo n't either .	St
1.2.3	CODE 41 is also noted by http : //support.microsoft.com/default.aspx ? scid=kb ; en-us ; 314060 Ignore what the KB says and delete the keys to retest .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I do n't know if will be helpful or not but I had the same problem with ALL 3 of my optical drives .	St
1.3.2	The culprit was slysoft 's anydvd .	St
1.3.3	I would suggest that you check to see if this particular piece of software is on your machine .	St
1.3.4	After going into the registry and deleting all references to slysoft and anydvd and rebooting all 3 optical drives reappeared .	St
1.3.5	Good luck	Polite
