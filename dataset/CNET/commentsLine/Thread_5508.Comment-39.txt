i had the same issue with different brand of 500 gb external drive.
solution, after a year of fretting and being told it would cost $1700 to send it back to manufacturers data recovery service.
hubby connected it to his work system running windows 2000 and realized the program had &quot;hid&quot; the files.
using new usb cables (as a precaution) transferred the files via his system directly to my laptop.
hope this helps.
