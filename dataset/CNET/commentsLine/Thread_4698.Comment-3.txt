ok good to know my drive is ok. i've checked into those links and most seem to suggest a repair install of xp.
however, here's what's happening now.... i boot off of the xp cd, ignore the first option to repair, it detects my previous install which i then tell it to repair.
once i do this, it copies all the files and reboots my machine but when the machine comes up nothing happens.
nothing boots, setup does not continue.
ideas?
