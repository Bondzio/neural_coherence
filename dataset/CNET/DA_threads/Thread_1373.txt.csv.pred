1.2.1	make sure you have the service install (not installed by default) and in terms of networking side, you'll need to open port TCP 3389 and point it to the server.	Sug
1.2.2	without purchasing TS license, you are only allow to have max of 2 connections at the same time.	St
1.2.3	I will never use it for more than 1 connection since it disconnect and kick you out sometime if you connection is not good and you'll need the 2nd logon to clear it out.	St

1.3.2	how do should I open the ports in the computer itself?	Ques
1.4.1	First, check and see if you are able to connect from the local network.	St
1.4.2	If so, the problems is on your router or the IP address you use to connect from home.	St
1.4.3	If you are not able to connect from the local network, check and see if both Terminal Service and TS licensing are running.	St
1.4.4	(You should be running in Remote Administration Mode if you dont plan to purchase any licenses).	St
1.4.5	Unless you have install 3rd party firwall on the server, otherwise, you don't need to open any port on the server to allow this connection.	St
