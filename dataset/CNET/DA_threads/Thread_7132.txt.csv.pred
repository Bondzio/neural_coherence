1.1.3	It is now July 2005 my problems began in April 2005 so we are taking about a period of 4 months ! ! !	St
1.1.4	Problem 1 : Computer will not turn on ( it is less than 2 months old ) .	St
1.1.5	They say owe well well send you a box pack it up and ship it to us .	St
1.1.6	So I did .	St
1.1.7	They send it back , claiming that they tested it , and I get a computer back that is missing the memory card ( therefore , it will not boot at all ) .	St
1.1.8	So I call and of course they cant just send me my memory chip they have to have me send the computer back to them again .	St
1.1.9	So I do .	St
1.1.10	And they send it back ( supposedly testing it first ) and I again get a non-working computer .	St
1.1.11	So I send it back again , and they send it back again , and you guessed it , it still doesnt work .	St
1.1.12	So then I get to talk to the Sr. Quality Manager , HP Executive Customer Relations Management who guarantees me that I will get a working computer .	St
1.1.13	So again I send it and finally they send me a working computer .	St
1.1.14	But now they had the computer as long as I did .	St
1.1.15	So I continue to use the products as I have already paid for them and one of the other computers dies.it has a CPU fan that failed and will not boot up because of it .	St
1.1.16	So I calland again I am told that they cant send me the part ( even though I told them I could easily install a CPU fan myself ) .	St
1.1.17	So I wait for the box , send the computer back.AND GET THE WRONG COMPUTER BACK ! ! ! ! !	Sug
1.1.18	Then when I call I am told they have no idea where my computer is but they will have someone call me back .	St
1.1.19	When they never called back I called them .	St
1.1.20	They then claim my computer was at their service center the entire time ( BULL ) and that they havent fixed it yet ( BULL ) and that I need to send the computer I got back before they can send mine to me .	St
1.1.21	Then the Service Manager tells me he cant guarantee my computer is coming back to meWHAT THE F*** ! ! ! !	St
1.1.22	He refused to give me anything in writing stating I will even get any computer at all back ! ! ! !	St
1.1.23	Since I am doing the right thing and sending the wrong computer back I guess I can only hope and pray that I get something in returnBUT NO GUARENTEE AS THE SERVICE MANAGER told me THERE IS NO GUARENTEES IN LIFE ! !	St
