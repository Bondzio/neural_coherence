it's 4gb and i have tested it with only one photo on it, so it's not like there is a huge amount of data on it.
it has slots for 6 different types of card and i have previously used it with a memory duo pro (or whatever that long sony one is called) successfully.
the printer is only a couple of years old.
it is an epson stylus photo rx520 (which is similar to the rx500:  )
