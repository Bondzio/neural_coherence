Thanks for your reply and example.
But are DVD creation and video editing equitable functions?
I've been told that video editing will require massive amounts of ram.
I'm trying to ascertain if this is true or not.
If I buy a computer and 2g of ram means I can only edit a video 30 minutes in length or less than I will regret spending $2,000 on such a purchase.
The operating system is going to leech a certain amount of that ram already, so I am concerned if ram size is important that 2gs may be too little.
