hi bob: i bought the gigabit d-link dir-655 from costco, but saw them advertised at cnet from other places for over $170.
i bought the bdfsr41 from best buy as it was the only wired router they had in stock.
maybe the buffalo you bought would work for me?
since i don't need the wi-fi function of the dir-655 now, maybe using it is overkill??
the think all the n, and pre-n routers are pricey with lots of problems--setup, and even firmware downloads.
even d-link's technical support is lacking if trouble comes along with sub-net mask, dhcp or ip addresses.
