What it comes down to is how much $$$ you have to spend. I never buy the lastest greatest but wait for price to comes down then buy a &quot;newer&quot; video card. So now you can get that card for a good price. John

Your new game will certainly be better for it. Is it worth the money, well I never spent that much for a video card as I'm a &quot;trailing edge&quot; sorta user not a bleeding edge and wait for costs to be more reasonable. You can check the http://www.tomsharware.com for a review and/or check pricelists for comments made by buyers. good luck -----Willy
