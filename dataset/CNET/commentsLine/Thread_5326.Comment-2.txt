if not today, it will be soon.
here's why.
the power supply is rated for that many watts new.
in a year it may lose from 10 to 50% of that rating depending on too many factors.
to keep out of trouble i add it all up and toss 100 more watts into the supply rating.
those machines never show up due to an overtaxed power supply.
