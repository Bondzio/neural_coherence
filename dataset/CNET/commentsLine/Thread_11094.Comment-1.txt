alright, i have 2 questions but i thought it better, being as how they are sort of related.
the first is about dual monitors, more specifically would they work on my machine and how.
my graphics card is a nvidia geforce 560 ti, i can't see anywhere else where i could connect the second monitor though, is there any other information you need to know or is that it?
second is another connectivity quesiton: i want to upgrade my headphones and really like the look of (being a gamer and a musician/enthusiast) the razer tiamat 7.1, i just want to know if they will also work on my computer, what sort of connection do i need?
how many input jacks?
any help on either of these is greatly appreciated...
