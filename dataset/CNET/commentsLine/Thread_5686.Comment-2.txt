i bought a couple hdds for my first computer and had the same thing happen to me with my seagate but not my western digital.
the problem turned out to be that the seagate simply didn't format itself on its own like the western digital.
it's been such a long time since i found where it was hiding when i booted the computer up that i've forgotten how to find it again.
this site though has step-by-step instructions on how to do it, and it looks about the same as what i did.
