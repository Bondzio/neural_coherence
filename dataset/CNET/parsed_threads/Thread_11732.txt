<s> I have an internal DSL modem that has internet connection sharing enabled and a network switch connecting it to the other computers in the house, and my xbox. </s>
<s> However, I can't get my xbox live to work. </s>
<s> I input the DNS server values that my isp gave me. </s>
<s> Every time I try to connect it comes up with an error that says &quot;network services (DHCP or PPoE) were not found&quot; i know that i do not have a PPoE dsl connection. </s>
<s> Help me please. </s>
<s> Tell the make/model of the router. </s>

<s> It is actually not a router it is a network switch, here is the info: it is a Belkin 5 port switch </s>
<s> A switch will not work unless you pay up for a second IP address from your ISP. </s>
<s> It's about 30 to 50 bucks a month so most go get the router. </s>

<s> Why can I access the internet from the other computers connected to the switch without paying for the extra ip's? </s>
<s> also How would I use a router if I have an internal DSL modem that cannot be connected directly to a router? </s>
<s> Thanks so much for your help. </s>
<s> You are likely pilfering some addresses and they will shut you down if they find out. </s>
<s> Best of luck figuring it out. </s>
