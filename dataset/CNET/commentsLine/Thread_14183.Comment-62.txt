...or maybe 1976. it's hard to remember way back then.
anyway, it was one of the first radio shack trs-80's, complete with tape recorder i/o and 4k of ram.
we thought we were really uptown when we upgraded it to 16k.
i don't believe when we bought ours that there were any prewritten programs available, but the machine was equipped with a very basic version of basic, and we amused ourselves by writing our own.
or at least we did when the computer was in working condition, which wasn't very often.
i think ours was the original reason the machines got the nickname &quot;trash-80.&quot; it spent more time in the repair shop than it did on our desk, and eventually we were able, by dint of excellent record-keeping and threats of legal action, to return the thing and get our money back.
about a year later we got an apple ii+ and found out what a real computer was.
a few months later we got a second one and computerized our business.
we'd have been apple users for life except for the fact that when they came out with hardware upgrades (the apple iie and subsequent models) they weren't backward compatible.
all of our custom programming would have had to be rewritten, and there was no guarantee that the rewrites would work with the next version of the apples.
so we continued to use the ii+es for as long as we could, then switched to ibm compatibles which had the advantage of backward compatibility.
i was also one of the first windows users, as my business became heavily dependent on the use of adobe pagemaker with its run-time version of windows.
