Is it 80 conductor and is anything else connected?
You should be using an 80 conductor cable.
The default for these is the blue end goes to the MB, the black to the master and gray to the slave device.
But, what you do is set all connected devices to &quot;cable select&quot; or CS.
You don't set master/slave when using these.
Change to CS and, if you're using an 80 conductor cable, it should work with either black or gray.
