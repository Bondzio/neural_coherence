Even while Partition Magic might work if power was lost or a disk error happened we don't have a way to get back to XP. Fix that issue first before risking it all. Bob

2439	3	242277	2454835	2454834	R. Proffitt	4/9/07 10:31 AM	1.17611466E12	That's fairly safe.	But it doesn't fix the underlying problem. It's very expensive to pay up for a full version of XP. I'd get my XP CD from the maker ASAP before you discover how expensive this lesson is. Bob
2439	4	242277	2454836	2454835	mrpopper	4/9/07 10:37 AM	1.17611502E12	what is the problem?	I don't understand what the problem is? iam not messing around with the main partiton with the windows operating system installed on it
2439	5	242277	2454837	2454836	R. Proffitt	4/9/07 10:42 AM	1.17611532E12	The problem is simple.	Playing around with the file system could leave XP in some need of repair. Without your CD you can't fix it. A simple issue balloons into one big problem and could be costly if you can't get your restore CDs made or supplied. For example a call from the Geeksquad puts in into the 200PLUSPLUS range to get the machine working again. Bob
2439	6	242277	2454838	2454837	mrpopper	4/9/07 10:44 AM	1.17611544E12	so its best to leave it?	Ok so its best to just leave it? I wish i had more space to store files on.
2439	7	242277	2454839	2454838	R. Proffitt	4/9/07 10:51 AM	1.17611586E12	Here's how I see it.	Changing partition sizes is somewhat dangerous. Partition Magic usually does fine but we have no XP CD to recover the system with. Formatting that second partition is about as safe as it gets but still leaves the original issue unresolved. Hard disks die all the time so we need to get our plan together for that day. Hope this lays it all out for you. Why not ask for your restore CDs? Bob
2439	8	242277	2454871	2454839	mrpopper	4/9/07 10:58 AM	1.17611628E12	ask who for the restore cds?	Who would i ask for the restore cd's?
2439	9	242277	2454945	2454871	R. Proffitt	4/9/07 12:43 PM	1.17612258E12	I might be able to tell if...	More was told about the PC. If Dell we ask Dell, if HP then HP. If it's some PIRATE XP, then you'll eventually have to pay up. Bob
2439	10	242277	2454974	2454945	mrpopper	4/9/07 1:32 PM	1.17612552E12	Dell	My computer is a Dell.
2439	11	242277	2454959	2454974	R. Proffitt	4/9/07 1:41 PM	1.17612606E12	Dell. Now it depends on the year but.	They ship restore CDs for about 35 bucks (mostly). The full XP will run from 99 to 299 bucks not including someone helping you to install it if you can't. Geeksquad hit a neighbor for over 100 &quot;due to difficulties with finding drivers&quot; and so their tab for XP Pro came to over 400 bucks. (299 is the retail XP Pro price plus 100 to install) Yikes. This is something that might not cost much today but as time passes could cost dearly. -&gt; Also noteworthy is some Dells have you make your own restore CDs. I can't guess why some pass up on that. Bob
2439	12	242277	2455022	2454959	mrpopper	4/9/07 2:10 PM	1.1761278E12	Ok thanks for all fo your help	Ok ill just leave ths issue for a while and later i might do somthing about it. But thanks for all fo your help Bob I am sorry i caused so much trouble.
2439	13	242277	2455011	2454959	R. Proffitt	4/9/07 2:15 PM	1.1761281E12	No trouble at all.	I was trying to steer clear of a potential issue for you. Your choice on how to proceed depends on how much risk you can tolerate. It's fairly low to prepare the remaining disk space but any move without your XP CD is going to have risk so my thoughts are to get that out of the way first. Bob
