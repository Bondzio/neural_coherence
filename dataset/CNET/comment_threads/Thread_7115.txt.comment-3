actually the AMD system is saying its IP is somthing like 4.227.22x.xxx Should I go and assign the IP addresses these machines had before they crashed (I believe the other desktop retains its old IP, it just has a .1 or .2 and so on up to 4) I could just make each computer have the address it would have been given right?
