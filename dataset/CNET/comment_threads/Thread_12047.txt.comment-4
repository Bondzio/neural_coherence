because you didn't tell us which printer.
Two things I would do.
1.
Go to the Brother site and look for updated drivers.
2.
Look for a device conflict.
Control Panel, System, Hardware, Device Manager.
With the printer turned on, click the mouse and other point devices + sign and double click the mouse.
Click the resources tab.
If there's a conflict, options to correct this will be displayed.
