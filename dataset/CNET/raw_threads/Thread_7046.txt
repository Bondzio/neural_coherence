I want to do this so i wouldnt have to buy a full version of xp. Will this work? Will my old computer be left unharmed?

A full REATIL XP license allows you to install XP on a different computer, but it must be removed from the old one. ASIDE: Copying files or a disk image from an old computer doesn't damage the old computer.
