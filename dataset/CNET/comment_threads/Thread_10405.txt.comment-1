I am running Windows MCE 2005.Recently I bought a U.S Robotics Wireless MAXg Router + U.S Robotics MAXg PCMCIA card for my pc and laptop.
I have a DSL modem.
The scenario is.
The DSL modem is connected to my PC through USB .
I have conneted the USR Wireless Router to my PC through a network cable to my NIC card.
Now in the WAN status of the router,I am not able to get any indication of internet although I am conneted to the net via the USB DSL modem.
My laptop is connected wireless to the USR router.The USR does have a WAN port but when I connect the LAN cable to this port,I am not able to get the web interface i.e configuring the router information etc...but when I connect the LAN cable to the one of the 4 ports of the USR Router,I am able to get the web interface for the router.
Is there something that I am doing wrong or is there some information I need to know.Also I am able to share files and see my laptop on the network.Thanks in advance
