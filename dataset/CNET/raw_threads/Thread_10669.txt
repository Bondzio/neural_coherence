I have two DirecTV HD DRV HR24's. I have a DSL Modem, a Wireless Router, Desktop, laptops, etc. I have one of the HR24's hardwired to the Wireless Router. The other HR-24 is in a different location and cannot be hardwired. How can I make it part of a home network/DirecTV home network? I have a second older Wireless Router not currently used. Can I use that...maybe configure it as a wireless access point? I configured it per the Belkin Router website and connected the second router via Ethernet to the second HR-24. This HR-24 said it was connected via ethernet to the Router but that I had no internet access.Anyone know if I configure this second Wireless Router as an Access Point, can I plug something like an HR24 into it and get internet access to the HR24 so I can do &quot;on-demand&quot; and also DirecTV home connect? Last, I also have a game console that I would like to have access the internet. Another possible reason for wanting to get a set-up that works. Suggestions appreciated. Thanks!
