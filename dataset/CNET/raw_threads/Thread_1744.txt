I'm wondering if my PSU and motherboard will support a new GPU and CPU upgrade. http://www.sevenforums.com/hardware-devices/98358-can-i-upgrade.html#post850576 My original post is there please read it and give me your opinion. Maybe someone here can straighten it out I have two people saying I can upgrade the CPU and another saying I can't.

The Phenom II x4 955 BE requires 125 watts of power...so if your current PSU is 450 watts, with no 6 pin GPU connectors, I'd have to say that you're SOL for the PSU. http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_geforce_9800gt_us.html (see thermal and power specs) I would have to concur with posters from the other forum; your current motherboard only supports AMD Phenom CPU's up to (and including) the 9600 Agena series, and is limited to 65 watts max. http://www.msi.com/index.php?func=prodcpu2&prod_no=1472&maincat_no=1
