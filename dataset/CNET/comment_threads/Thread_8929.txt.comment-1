Hi.
I have a Dell Inspiron 5100 notebook with Dell Truemobile 1450 a/b/g MiniPCI card.
I'm thinking of buying another wireless card, and &quot;join&quot; the 2 wireless cards together, so that when combined, they can provide a better throughput.
I remember in the past, during the days of Windows 98, there is such a feature in Windows 98.
Is there such a feature in Windows XP too?
And is this practice recommended?
Thank you very much.
