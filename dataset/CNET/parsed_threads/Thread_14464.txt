<s> Hi: I have a Compaq Presario 5700T desktop computer, with 450MHz. </s>
<s> I would like to upgrade to a faster MHz. </s>
<s> Can I upgrade to at least a 550MHz??? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> I don't think they make 550 Mhz processors anymore. </s>
<s> If you're planning to upgrade the CPU, you better upgrade the motherboard also. </s>
<s> Technology is moving so fast, upgrading just doesn't worth the price anymore. </s>
<s> What kind of cpu and motherboard do you have? </s>
<s> PII goes up to 450mhz, if you have that, then you'll have to get a new PIII or P4 compatible motherboard. </s>
<s> Motherboard + cpu make up most of the cost in a computer anyway. </s>
<s> Just get a new machine, it would be easier, and probably even cheaper. </s>
<s> actually you can find Pentium III's on ebay and pricegrabber for a good price if it's a Slot 1 Pentium II box, you can run Slot I Pentium III's in there (if their sub 900MHZ ones, as Pentium II and Pentium III are VERY VERY close to each other in design (less difference than Northwood to Prescott) i would still agree with them on this though, just get a new machine </s>
