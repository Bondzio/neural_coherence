What other people and can't you ask them for help? Kees

The EMC Navisphere Express is a NAS-device from EMC2. That's quite something else and your link isn't applicable to that at all. I assume such a professional device came with a manual and a support contract. So all I can say at the moment: read the manual and call your support company. Kees
