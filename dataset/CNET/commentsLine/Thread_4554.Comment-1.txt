i have a compaq presario sr1151nx: i changed the hd and in doing so reloaded win xp plus all the drivers which i downloaded from hp web site as i did not have the original disk with drivers.
everything works fine except no audio i went to the support site for compaq and followed all their instructions and even removed and reinstalled the audio drivers and cannot get sound from the speakers.
the speakers will give off a clicking sound when i plug into the mic connector.
i have the model with digital audio it has 6 audio connectors plus the 2 digital audio connectors.
any help would be appreciated.
