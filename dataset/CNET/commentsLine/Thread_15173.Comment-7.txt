i have a tablet.
it's one of the android things and does not replace my laptop.
i don't attach a keyboard but set down the tablet when i go to use my laptop.
those that try to merge the 2 will be very upset.
as to the win8 tablet if it's one of the arm based units, again, no word for you unless microsoft issues it.
it appears you may be learning about these new devices.
that is, i've encountered folk that thought they would be a small &quot;windows pc&quot; and they are not.
