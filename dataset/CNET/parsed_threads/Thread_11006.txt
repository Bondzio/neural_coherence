<s> Can someone tell me what's involved in replacing a currupted bios chip on a motherboard? </s>
<s> Is there any special tools that are needed. </s>
<s> I have a SOYO KT333 Dragon Plus motherboard that I tried to update the bios on, and it has appeared to have failed. </s>
<s> I can't get my system to boot up. </s>
<s> I even tried resetting the bios using the reset jumper on the motherboard, but this did not work. </s>
<s> I have ordered a new bios chip from Soyo. </s>
<s> I'm just wondering if this is something that I could probably do myself or if I'm going to need to take it to a professional to do. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> If so, all you need is that chip from the motherboard maker. </s>
<s> My bet is it will cost about the same price as the entire board. </s>

<s> I had a look at the manual for your board, and it is a zif socket. </s>
<s> This design is intended to make the bios &quot;switcheable&quot; Whether you decide to make a go of this yourself is entirely up to you. </s>
<s> If you feel you have the expertise to do it, then I say try, but be careful, the pins on a bios chip are delicate. </s>
<s> Make for absolutely sure you're grounded. </s>
<s> ESD build up can turn your new chip into a really expensive little ornament. </s>
<s> I can only assume as was stated in a previous reply, that you opted to replace the chip as a less expensive alternative to replacing the board? </s>
<s> If you have a socketed BIOS chip, its pretty straight-forward in its replacement. </s>
<s> Just, remove with care and then ordinate new BIOS in its place. </s>
<s> Your manual or online gotted manual for your mtrbd. </s>
<s> should explain the BIOS location. </s>
<s> If you're unlucky, you may have a &quot;soldered in&quot; BIOS chip and should be sent in to be replaced/fixed, not for the uncustomed. </s>
<s> If Soyo is senting a replacement, it should be a socketed BIOS. </s>
<s> You should check if the old BIOS supported &quot;boot strapping&quot; a very basic boot-up routine to help recover(via reflash) the old BIOS or similar notation on the topic, dig for it. </s>

<s> You say it's a zif socket. </s>
<s> It sounds like it shouldn't be any harder than installing a processor. </s>
<s> I opted to buy the bios replacement chip because I figured it would be cheaper and less of a hassle than replacing the whole motherboard. </s>
<s> The BIOS chip cost me $20 plus shipping. </s>
<s> With it being a zif socket I feel like this is something I can do myself. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Where did you find that it said it was a zif socket? </s>
