<s> my computer has a year old cd/dvd drive and a blu-ray drive that can do cd/dvd as well, but both see to be having troubles playing audio cds. </s>
<s> it will find the cd, but will only play part of tracks 1 and 9. and in the computer selection it says the audio cd has 0 bytes free of 0 bytes. </s>
<s> my OS is 32 bit vista ultimate. </s>
<s> does anyone know a solution? </s>
<s> Yes, audio CD always show 0 Bytes. </s>
<s> you have to download audio songs in your computer then try to play, i also make sure you that audio songs only download through windows media player. </s>
<s> if you download through copy and paste they donot play. </s>
<s> so, download through WMP. </s>
<s> the tracks will read as 44 bytes and it will come up with an error when i try to rip it. </s>
