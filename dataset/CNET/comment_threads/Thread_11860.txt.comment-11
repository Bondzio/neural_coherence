Although you wont notice any difference if you choose a USB 2.0 Adapter, it will stick out of the usb port an may get in the way on a notebook which increases the risk of it getting bent or being snapped off completely.
Also Usb adapters require drivers normally for them to work.
I believe PCMCIA cards don't.
Just my opinion anyway.
