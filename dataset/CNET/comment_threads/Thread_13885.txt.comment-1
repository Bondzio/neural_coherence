I have an intel p4 processesor, 512mb ram and i am using asrock 775vm800 motherboard.
i want to implement raid-1 on my computer.
the motherboard manual says this motherboard has built in support for raid-0 and raid-1.
what does this mean?
Does it mean that i do not have to buy a seperate raid controller card to implement raid-1 on my computer?
if so how do i go about it.
