I've wanted to build my own PC for some time now, but I have no real knowledge.
I would like some patient guidance on some of the general knowledge such as which is best to get, or compatibility and maybe some advanced tips.
I want to build is a gaming PC that can run the current games smoothly without having to lower the graphic settings to blocky blurs.
I would also like to be able to do this with out spending a fortune, but I realize the limitations of that aspiration.
