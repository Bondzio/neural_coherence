<s> I am trying to install the third internal hard drive inside my Sony Vaio computer case. </s>
<s> There are only two bays for the hard drives. </s>
<s> There is enough space for the third one, though. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what kind of brackets I could use to install the third drive? </s>
<s> Is there a site I can purchase a bay for one drive or some kind of hardware which will hold the drive in place? </s>
<s> Thanks a lot. </s>

<s> bay down to a 3 1/2?? </s>
<s> If so go to: http://www.cyberguys.com search for item 161 0410 that's it. </s>
<s> I am looking for additional bay for the third drive. </s>
<s> Are you aware that a Hard drive can be mounted in any orientation?? </s>
<s> On its side, upside down. </s>
<s> Seems that if you have space, mounting should just take some kind of a kludge. </s>
<s> Of course getting the ribbon cable to it with another drive on the cable may be a real challenge. </s>
<s> Just tape the thing under the lowest harddrive bay. </s>
<s> It'll work fine... ^_^ </s>
<s> of Kluge [variation of spelling] LOL But you posted it as a reply to me. </s>
