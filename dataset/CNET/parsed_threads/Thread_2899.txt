<s> Everyone here seems to be well versed in the online persuit of computer hardware, so here is my question: Where is the best place to buy a complete system online? </s>
<s> My concerns in order of importance are price, customization, and customer service. </s>
<s> I'm a casual gamer, at least moderate performance is a must. </s>
<s> I have shopped around at various places, but I want to make sure I'm getting the best deal I can. </s>
<s> Thank you in advance for any info/ideas. </s>
<s> Casual gaming leads to more gaming, leads to more money for better computer and/or graphics. </s>
<s> Yeah, the casual gaming is mostly World of Warcraft- It eats up some time, but I'm definitely not too hardcore. </s>
<s> Thankfully Blizzard had the insight to make WOW playable on some lower-end machines. </s>
<s> If I could get a machine- no moniter, I have a 17&quot; LCD which I love- for 800 bucks or less, that would be super. </s>
<s> (Don't laugh- I know its possible.) </s>
<s> Any ideas here? </s>
<s> The cheaper the better- I just don't want garbage, either. </s>
<s> you make price first priority that is exactly why when you buy a case with a power supply, the supply is usually crap. </s>
<s> it's known as low bidding. </s>
<s> Try http://www.monarchcomputer.com at least you are dealing with competent people and know how to build a gaming system. </s>
<s> The power supply w/ most boxes i have seen is 420w (sometimes 350w). </s>
<s> I would rather spend the extra 50-80 bucks to go to a 500w from a decent manufacturer. </s>
<s> You are right, though, &quot;price first&quot; is a dangerous mindframe. </s>
<s> Where would you think I could cut my cost a little bit? </s>
<s> I don't need dual DVD/CD drives, media card readers, zip drives, blah blah blah, so thats a start. </s>
<s> But where else can I save money? </s>
<s> own, I gave you one good link. </s>
<s> They will put in only those items that you want and check it out completely. </s>
<s> You are doing the design. </s>
<s> There are more that will do that. </s>
<s> I personally don't buy from Tiger Direct because so much of their stuff is bought from mfrs unsold/overstock stuff. </s>
<s> I once bought a bunch of Creative Labs CD-ROM's from them. </s>
<s> Little did I know that those drives were crap and Creative unloaded them. </s>
<s> Threw them all away. </s>
<s> But if you know the specific items you can get some good deals from Tiger. </s>
<s> I buy virtually exclusively from newegg, they and their shipping is great. </s>
<s> Just don't buy little stuff from them, the way they price shipping on each item can really hurt if you want to buy like 10 ribbon cables or such. </s>
<s> [$1.80 per cable, 3.70 each to ship, maybe tapers to 3.00 per cable for 10 LOL] </s>
<s> Just realized I'm talking to the same person over in the Desktop forum with almost the same buying question. </s>
<s> Check over here for some of my comments. </s>
<s> http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html?forumID=68&threadID=93261&messageID=1053637 </s>
<s> I wasn't sure which forum would be best so I figured I would save myself the trouble and use both! </s>
<s> I'd suggestyou build your own. </s>
<s> Right now there's a free course forming on CNET that covers building your own computer. </s>
<s> It's for a high powered gaming system, but the principles are all the same; only the components would be different for a slower system. </s>
<s> You can get MOBO and processor combinations pretty cheap. </s>
<s> If you have a Micro Center near by, you can go look at the MOBO and decide what you want; need. </s>
<s> Shop online for the operating system. </s>
<s> That's been my only complaint with Newegg. </s>
<s> I buy 98% of my online stuff there and the shipping can be irritating. </s>
<s> I needed multiple items once but cancelled the order because they wanted to charge shipping for each little item and not on the whole order like most suppliers. </s>
<s> Just venting!!!! </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> for that other stuff. </s>
<s> I had a big order [lots of small stuff] with cyber and had to call about a credit card question sending to a different address. </s>
<s> While checking to correct the problem the girl noticed the shipping cost and said &quot;we can do a lot better than that&quot; and reduced it substantially. </s>
<s> I appreciated that. </s>
