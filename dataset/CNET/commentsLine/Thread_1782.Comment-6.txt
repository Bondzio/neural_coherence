my sister has a 17&quot; toshiba satalite for collage and wishes she didn't have such a large computer.
that computer i think is a bit heaveier and thicker than a macbook pro, but the shear largness of 17&quot; screen is too much for collage.
i have not had a lot of experience with 15&quot; macbook pro, but it seems like a good middle ground inbetween to large and not large enough.
i have an old ibook with a 12&quot; inch screen and it is really easy to carry around and doesn't have a terrible battery life (which i heard the macbook air has).
so, if $700 dollars isn't a problem to spend extra, i would go for teh 15&quot; inch macbook pro, the baseline 13&quot; macbook would do more than enough for basic computer usage (which you described).
and don't forget that installing and running windows on a mac is a breeze.
(if you absolutly needed to run it for some reason).
