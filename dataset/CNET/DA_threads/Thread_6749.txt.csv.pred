1.1.1	I could really do with a clear set of definitions of ... - Router - Switch - Bridge - Gateway - Subnet - Subnet Mask It would be great if anybody is prepared to provide any help .	St
1.1.2	Cheers , Doug .	St
1.2.1	But let me comment on & quot ; router. & quot ; This one has changed in definition over the years .	St
1.2.2	My first router back in 1990 did exactly what the name implied .	St
1.2.3	Today , 2009 the & quot ; router & quot ; is that consumer piece of gear that comes with wifi , router with NAT , switched hub and more .	St
1.2.4	Without nailing down the year you want to define this in and a context the exact definition can be fluid .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for your reply Bob .	Polite
1.3.2	It was actually the fact that the definition of router *is* so dynamic , that caused me to post in a forum rather than Google .	St
1.3.3	There 's various different conflicting factual sets of & quot ; definitions & quot ; out there so I wanted an expert opinion not a set of conflicting facts ( as you get bogged down with if you use Google to compile a glossary - which I 'm doing ) .	St
1.3.4	The year I want to define this in is 2009 , and the context is that I 'm putting together a generic glossary ( hoping to encompass definitions in the consumer , enterprise , industry , etc contexts ) .	St
1.3.5	Does anyone know of any good networking glossary sites ... ?	Ques
1.3.6	Doug .	St
1.4.1	I 've had to go with the flow about what a router is .	St
1.4.2	If I were to take my 1970 's networking ( yes we had networks back then ) I would not be able to talk to today 's owners as I would be constantly correcting them that a Linksys Wifi router is not a & quot ; router & quot ; but has many networking components inside that enclosure .	St
1.4.3	You 've found the right 2009 definition and I think you should go with that and finish your definitions today .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
