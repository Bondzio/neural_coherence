This is probably a function of your old version of Toast.
You really should be moving away from anything &quot;Classic&quot;.
The OS X version of Toast will burn just about anything, including PC compatible disks, DVD, D/L DVD, CD and all the other neat stuff.
Toast 6 Titanium OS X version, is the earliest version you should be looking for but Toast 7 would be nice.
Happy burning P
