&quot;Tip: If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; No OS mentioned, so I leave you to read the manuals at: http://www.smc.com/index.cfm?prod=318&submit.x=5&submit.y=12&sec=Support&pg=Support-Center-Downloads&site=c Bob
