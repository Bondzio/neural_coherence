Hi I've just taken delivery today of a Fujitsu Siemens Amilo D1845 laptop with a Conexant PRISM 802.11g (3886) network adapter.
OS is XP Home.
Am able to connect to open network in my building but cannot get IE or Outlook Express to connect - error messages inc &quot;Cannot find server&quot;.
Signal strength is generally good and have Internet options configured to &quot;Automatically detect settings&quot;.
It is not running through a client at all, Windows is controlling the Wireless Network settings.
A friend could connect with their HP laptop running an Intel PRO 2200BG wireless card no problem.
What might I be doing wrong?
All suggestions greatly appreciated!
