<s> I have been looking at the Dell Inspiron XPS Gen 2 since about March as a replacement for my desktop since I'm going to college in the fall. </s>
<s> The price of the xps has hovered around 2300 ever since it came out and has not changed. </s>
<s> I've noticed that this week, Dell's promotion was 15% off the system, well not only was the system itself marked up 15% to compensate for the promotion (which has been typical of them ever since the system came out)Dell aslo marked up the upgrade components 15%. </s>
<s> So when i saw this i got a little upset that they were pulling that kind of crap, so i decided to go on an online service chat with a Dell sales rep to ask him why they were pricing the xps gen 2 that way. </s>
<s> Heres how the conversation went in summary, i asked why the system has not gone down in price since march *response took about 6 minutes* the sales rep then completely dodged my question and just said, well it looks like the price hasnt changed. </s>
<s> so he suggested a preferred account, and i told him i would not qualify since i was 18, and i didnt of course. </s>
<s> So i asked what kind of deals i could get from a preferred account and he told me a $25 rebate and 0% interest for a year. </s>
<s> Since the Inspiron XPS Gen 2 is such an expensive system, i responded with, &quot;thats not even worth my time, thats a terrible deal considering how much one is spending on that system&quot; *no response* I appologized for being rude then i went on and said, &quot;but thats my perception on it, especially when i've probably spent over $2500 on stuff from dell in the past&quot; *no response* i finally figured out he no longer was talking to me after 15 minutes of waiting for a response. </s>
<s> This made me mad that I was being completely ignored because i asked a few questions and told them what i thought of how their sales dept. </s>
<s> works. </s>
<s> So I told them in a post session survey that i was very disappointed that they would treat a customer like this and i would sound off about it on boards like this. </s>
<s> I used to like Dell, heck i've bought two computers from them in the past and have been extremely happy with them havent had a problem yet, but they by far have some of the worst customer service in the nation and with this recent experience i have had with them, i doubt i will return to them for anything. </s>
<s> The old adage, &quot;buyer beware&quot; still matters. </s>
<s> Just remember this experience and don't let it slide as you know the same policies and marketing will be used in the future. </s>
<s> I've seen a marked difference in Dell's support and how they treat those with problems. </s>
<s> But, lets say, great, I'll get that pived user's business. </s>
<s> However, if they're too pived they expect too much at times, because they're on guard now. </s>
<s> I just wish they paid attention when they were buying the stuff. </s>
<s> -----Willy </s>
<s> I recommended them to a co-worker who called and tried to order an advertised PC. </s>
<s> The girl kept trying to switch him to a higher priced model that hew did not need. </s>
<s> He called back the next day (last day of the promo) and was placed on hold repeatedly. </s>
<s> He complained that he was at work and needed to get the order placed ASAP. </s>
<s> The guy told him he could call back the next day and he had noted that the sale price would be honored. </s>
<s> Naturally the next day they refused to honor the price, and tried to tell him that the RAM was not upgradable because it was soldered in and not plug in. </s>
<s> I told him to call Compaq and the guy suddenly found out the RAM was upgradable. </s>
<s> Joe thanked them, hung up and caleld Compaq, and had his system in two days. </s>
<s> I had not been a Compaq or HP PC fan, but I have had good support from both and am extremely happy with my new HP. </s>
<s> Read my profile, I'm using a Dimension 4100, which is 4 1/2 years old. </s>
<s> Back then, they were a good company. </s>
<s> Now they only seem interested in taking your money. </s>
<s> If you are still looking for a PC, try http://www.ibuypower.com Good prices for it. </s>
<s> I received a better offer in the mail so I had my offer in color print. </s>
<s> When I called it in, they knew nothing about it. </s>
<s> -&gt; Your complaint is not just a Dell phenom. </s>
<s> Corporations are not doing a good job in relaying the deals out to those that need to interface with you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> actually saved me money and upgraded my DSL last month. </s>
<s> I am basically getting DSL for free with the price reduction. </s>
<s> You are right though, sometimes the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing. </s>
