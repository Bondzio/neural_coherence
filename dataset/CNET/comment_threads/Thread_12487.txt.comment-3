The 12v rail is where the action is.
Your psu has 18a........that assumes it can really put out that much.
That will xlate to about 215w.
Your cpu and new gpu will want about 135w.
That's tight........factor in misc and your headroom has gone to zip.
Your mobo has a pcie x16 slot.......the new gpu should fit.
Your call.
