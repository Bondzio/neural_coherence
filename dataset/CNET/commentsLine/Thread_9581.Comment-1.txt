i have decided i would like an external hd to back up mainly my music and digital pictures on my main drive.
i really don't have anything else that important to back up or worry about.
if i buy a new external is it as simple as plugging in the usb and begin transferring files to that drive?
i just want it for storage only.
also, i have noted that it would be best to unplug this new drive when not in use so it does not get a bug or corrupted is that good advise?
thanks for the help.
