1.5.2	I am going to try booting it to safe mode and instialling my friends program which if I remember correctly is Avast .	St
1.5.3	Hope it works .	St
1.6.1	( I hope , I 'm using it myself ) , but for this XP Antivirus program MBAM is recommended somehow .	St
1.6.2	See for yourself in the 300+ post discussion I linked to .	St
1.6.3	Once you get your machine up and running again , keep using Avast .	St
1.6.4	It needs registering to start with , and reregistering every year , but they do n't spam your email-address .	St
