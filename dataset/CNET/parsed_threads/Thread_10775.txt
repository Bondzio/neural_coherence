<s> first of all i have a Pentium Intel Celeron processor running at 400MHz and a 66FSB speed. </s>
<s> i havent installed anything new recently except a 10/100 MB/s networking card and a new CD-RW drive. </s>
<s> the problem is that i go through the normal process of going to Start and clicking on shut down. </s>
<s> Everything runs normal and everything shuts off, but i just leave it alone and VOILA it just reboots all by itself. </s>
<s> I have gone through the Bios allready and have tweaked the power management options to my liking, but none of the options it gives me relates to the problem i am receiving. </s>
<s> PLEASE HELP!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> You mentioned installing a new network card. </s>
<s> If it has a WOL (Wake on LAN) feature, disable it. </s>
<s> Some have a cable that goes to the MB and the MB BIOS may have a setting for this. </s>
<s> It should only trigger with a special command but who knows what else might. </s>
<s> You can also try uninstalling the NIC or other recent hardware to see if the problem goes away...just to narrow things down. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
