After somewhat complicated setup, both desktop (wired) and laptop (wireless) have working internet access. I then went through the wireless network wizard on the desktop in hopes of sharing desktop hard drive with laptop, and all went smoothly. But, when I tried to find the shared desktop HDD while on the laptop, I couldn't find it under &quot;My Computer&quot; or &quot;my network places.&quot; Is it possible that the router is not capable of sharing the drive, or have I set-up the network poorly? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Read http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6122-0.html?forumID=44&threadID=198031&messageID=2129068 and follow the story. It's a fine example of where details matter and when asked, the answers never seen to be answered. Clues abound in this discussion. Bob
