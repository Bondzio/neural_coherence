it actually comes out about the same.
the rebate on the the ram originally listed was good on only one of the sets.
so i wasn't getting both sets for ~$30 for a total of $60 also the ram i'm getting is listed for more than i what i paid for it.
i think an offer expired.
either way it was going to be ~$120.
also, a big factor in switching was that the corsair message boards were saying the mobo i got didn't do well with all the slots filled up with the ram i originally listed.
