Hello, I'm Mark, I'm wondering what PC should I get between theese two?
The price doesn't matter, here are the specifications: Number 1: Intel Core i7-950 3.06 GHz MB Foxconn X58 8 GB DDR3 RAM 1000 GB (1TB) HDD nVidia GTX560 1GB GDDR5 DVDRW Number 2: Intel Core i7-2600K 3.4GHz MB Foxconn-H67M-S 2.0 8 GB DDR3 RAM 1000 GB (1TB) HDD nVIdia GTX 550 Ti - 1GB GDDR5 DVDRW So, as you can see, Number 1 has weaker cpu than number 2, but A LOT faster gpu than number 2.
But, I'm not entirely sure in that, so that is what I'm asking you!
If Number 1, has weaker cpu, what should I get???
Faster CPU, or Faster GPU???
I need this pc for video making (Sony Vegas, After Effects) and fast rendering!
I also need it for gaming (Battlefield 3, Crysis 3, GTA 5 and other high-end games)!
Please, HELP!!!
Thank you!
