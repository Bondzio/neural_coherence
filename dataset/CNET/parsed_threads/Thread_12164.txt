<s> I think it'd be great if AMD would catch up and pass, as we all benefit from the results of competition. </s>
<s> But for now doing main HQ in Dresden's euros vs Intel's devalued US$ and the sizable lead Intel has, I think it'll be after we get a new CPU slot (so new mobo) before a person would feel like they'd get categorically better performance from AMD than they can from Intel. </s>
<s> I agree the Intel would be much faster at playing games and I also fully agree that you should try and save some money and get a fast dual core rather then a quad core as there are not a whole lot of programs that can take advantage of 4 cores at the moment, or even in the foreseeable future, and not a single game is on the list, although a lot of posters claim that Crysis uses all four (NOT). </s>
