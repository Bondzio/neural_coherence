It was used as a slave drive in a Gateway running Win XP Pro for about a year. Now it no longer is recognized in the donor machine as a slave. I need the name of a data recovery company that can recover the data from this HD. Any recommendations?

I have heard good things about both (though never used them), and they both charge you only upon successful recovery of your data. Their pricing is on a per-case basis, but expect to pay $500-$4,000 depending on what the problem is. In the future, only one word should be going through your mind every weekend...BACKUP. Hope this helps, John
