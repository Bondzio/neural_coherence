is that true even if the router and switches we are using are 1000 mb (gig switches) capability?
the routers and switches we are using are from foundry (bigiron 8000 and big iron 4000) and hp procurves.
i think the procurves are only 10/100 mb capable if i'm not mistaken.
thanks for any info you can provide.
