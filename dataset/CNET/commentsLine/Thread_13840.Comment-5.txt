&quot;thinking perhaps the cd/dvd rom was defective i installed another device&quot; there is a possible connection with this and that.
let's think over how the thumbs.db, icon caching in explorer works and files on a cdr or cdrw could work.
let's say our old cdrw drive supported and we use drag and drop capability.
the thumbs.db file could be updated and the view of the cdr/w would behave just like on the hard disk.
change the cdrw drive and we could break the drag and drop or &quot;cdr/w media behaves like a drive&quot; and the thumbs.db can't be written on the fly and you see your issue again.
it's a shame that no one writes a good article about how this all works but nothing in your post would lead me to suspect bad drives.
