If working before but not after, I'd take it back.
I'm sure the long wait the last time would make you hesitant but you should at least call it to their attention and mention it came back to you with a problem it didn't have before.
See what they say.
Good service should always include a thorough test before returning something to a customer.
You don't just fix what's broken and hand it back.
You look for other problems and advise the customer of these while the product is in your hands.
