<s> So I just set up my Alcatel Speedtouch USB adsl modem, which is is connected to my laptop. </s>
<s> But, I also have a SMC 7004VWBR 4 port wireless router and would like to get all our laptops in my house connected to wireless. </s>
<s> Is this wireless router compatible with my Speedtouch UCB adsl modem? </s>
<s> Will I be able to set up a wireless system in my house, so that all the laptops w/wireless cards can access the internet? </s>
<s> What do I do next? </s>
<s> I'm clueless! </s>
<s> Or, do I have to resort to buying a combo adsl wireless router/modem? </s>
<s> Many thanks, Jenny </s>
<s> &quot;Is this wireless router compatible with my Speedtouch UCB adsl modem?&quot; No. </s>
<s> Your ADSL modem must have an Ethernet port. </s>
<s> No. </s>
<s> I haven't seen a wireless router that will use an USB ADSL Modem. </s>

<s> If I buy one of those new adsl wirless router/modem combo will I have to have one of our laptops turned on and running the whole time? </s>
<s> And will this be a fairly easy set up, as in I just have to plug this wireless router/modem into the phone line correct? </s>
<s> thanks so much! </s>

<s> I would not buy such a device. </s>
<s> I do buy the occasional DSL or Cable modem and use the router to share such. </s>
<s> Stories abound about the wonder boxes and firmware issues so I just don't buy such. </s>
