1.1.1	I am running Windows XP SP2.	St
1.1.2	Two years ago I had a Deskjet 900 series which at one point required a driver update.	St
1.1.3	I had to call HP because the updated driver would not install.	St
1.1.4	I was told the printer was obsolete and HP sold me an upgrade which happened to be the Photosmart 2610 all in one, which I was thrilled with, especially since it only cost me $100.00 and some change.	St
1.1.5	I've owned this machine for a little over a year and all of a sudden the thing starts spitting out paper and gives a paper jam error when there is no paper jam.	St
1.1.6	I called HP and was told (after going through many steps to correct the issue), that the machine was bad and I had to buy a new one.	St
1.1.7	The options given were all $300+ so I told the tech it was too rich for my blood.	St
1.1.8	Now I'm left with no printer, no fax machine, no copier, and no flatbed scanner.	St
1.1.9	I'm not happy.	St
1.1.10	One other note to those who purchase the Photosmart 2610 all in one or 2610 printer.	St
1.1.11	The new printers have small print cartridges therefore you are forced to pay a small fortune for the ink much more often than with the older models.	St
1.1.12	I have no alternative except to purchase an all in one for about $120.00 at the local Sam's Club.	St
1.1.13	Should anyone know a fix for this problem, please respond to this post.	Ques
1.2.1	About 2 years for the 0 to 200 buck printers.	St
1.2.2	I think the HP k550 may be an exception but do read what I replied to at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7590_102-0.html?forumID=67&threadID=92780&messageID=1083371#1083371 Can you imagine someone having to perform that high wire act?	St
