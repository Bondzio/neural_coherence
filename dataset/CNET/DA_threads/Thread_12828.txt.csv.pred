1.1.1	Hi , I have a Netgear Wireless Router MR814AU connected to a Westell DSL Router/Modem ( Model C90-610015-06 ) provided to me by Verizon Online .	St
1.1.2	I 'm connecting these to my Windows XP SP2 computer .	St
1.1.3	I am able to access the web from my local PC , and am also able to access the web from my Pocket PC via wireless connection using the Netgear router .	St
1.1.4	The problem I 'm having is that I am unable to access my personal computer via VPN over the web .	St
1.1.5	I get to the point where it finds my computer and tries to validate the username/password , but no matter what I do I get the error ''The username and/or password is not valid on the domain '' .	St
1.1.6	I have never set up a domain , and checked , double-checked , triple-checked , and even reset my username and password on my PC , but ca n't get around this .	St
1.1.7	Here 's some info about my setup : WESTELL ROUTER SETUP IP = 192.168.1.1 The Westell is set up basically with the factory defaults .	St
1.1.8	The only changes I made to connect to Verizon Online was I changed VCI 35 to ''PPPoE '' ( was ''Bridge '' ) .	St
1.1.9	I also added PPTP as a service , pointing to my local PC ( 192.168.0.2 ) .	St
1.1.10	Once I had the Westell Router set up and running , I installed the Netgear Wireless Router .	St
1.1.11	NETGEAR WIRELESS ROUTER IP = 192.168.0.1 I used the provided setup CD to add the Netgear router to the mix .	St
1.1.12	The only changes I made to the setup are ( 1 ) I added wireless Security Encryption ( WEP ) ; ( 2 ) I added Port Forwarding for PPTP to my local PC ( 192.168.0.2 ) ; ( 3 ) I disabled the SPI Firewall .	St
1.1.13	LOCAL PC SETUP ( WINDOWS XP ) I added an Incoming connection for VPN 's .	St
1.1.14	My computer is assigned to a workgroup , not a Domain .	St
1.1.15	I am also using the No-IP web service to be able to VPN into my PC over the internet without having to worry about the dynamic IP of my PC .	St
1.1.16	I was able to establish a successful VPN connection over the web prior to introducing the Netgear router .	St
1.1.17	Any other info you might need , please let me know .	Sug
1.1.18	I am completely stuck , and would really like to get this figured out .	St
1.1.19	Thanks !	St
1.1.20	Brian	St
1.2.1	The problem obviously lies in the use of the second , Wireless router .	St
1.2.2	Therefore why not install a Wi-Fi card in the desktop , bridge the Wi-Fi and Ethernet connections to do away with the second router .	St
1.2.3	Then enable Internet Connection Sharing on the desktop and create a VPN .	St
1.3.1	Darton , Thank you for the reply .	St
1.3.2	I suppose as a last resort I may do that , but if there 's any way to get it working with my current setup , I 'd like to .	St
1.3.3	I feel like I 'm so darn close , like I 'm missing just one little step .	St
1.3.4	Brian	St
1.4.1	Try turning off DHCP server in the netgear and let the Westell assign addresses to the computers for you .	St
1.4.2	The wireless will still work , as long as it is enabled .	St
1.4.3	It will just get it 's IP from the Westell .	St
1.4.4	As long as you have port fowarding , and PPTP configured correctly , this should work .	St
