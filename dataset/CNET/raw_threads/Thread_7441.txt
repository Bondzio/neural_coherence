I have 3 hard drives. C: drive is always fine. the D: drive failed a diagnostic test, so I removed it. the e drive (device &quot;1&quot; on the secondary IDE channel), keeps slipping out of ultra DMA into slower PIO mode. I replaced this drive too just to be sure, but the problem is not fixed. it keep slipping into PIO mode. I can work around this by uninstalling (under IDE controllers in device manager) the secondary IDE channel. the driver / device reinstalls on startup, it goes back to ultra DMA mode for a while. But this only holds up for a few days then it slips back to PIO mode. any advice on how to fix this?? is it software or hardware related? is it a prob with my mobo? I'm really stumped. thanks - fj

Other areas are substandard power supplies and heat. Many will fit &quot;just big enough&quot; supplies and will experience issues like this. Can I ask why such detail is not in your post? Bob

I'm fairly sure it's up to snuff now. I have not done anything with mobo drivers. not sure what mobo this is any more, I will figure that out and do an update. do i need to do drivers or flash bios too maybe? thanks --fj

When I start on a new machine, I want the latest so I sidestep what problems it fixed. 2. Motherboard drivers. Yes. I always get the latest. 3. Power supply. What's on my desktop P4-3.0GHz HT? A cheapo but it's 680Watts. Overkill but I don't want trouble. Hope it helps you out. Bob

Had the same problem and after much hair pulling ended up trying another power supply in place of my 6 month old Antec problem solved. BTW Antec handled the warranty repair very quickly. Excellent service.

(I should think if it was the PS tho, wouldn't all the all the drives affected? the c drive never goes PIO.) thanks for all the help -- fj

Each device may have a different tolerance to low voltage or short dips in supply voltages. -&gt; The lesson I learned years ago was to never skimp on power and cooling. Bob

8782	10	110383	1259968	1259962	frankzxcv	6/23/05 5:14 PM	1.11954684E12	no luck so far	well i swapped out the PS i had another 425 PS supply (not as fancy as the enermax) but practically new from another box. still I get DMA, not ultra DMA, in the ST3120026A seagate drive. next, i can disable one case fan that's running off the mobo and pull cables out of the 3rd drive and DVD drive, will what that gets me! doe this ST3120026A drive in fact run at ultra dma mode?? is there a way to enable DMA mode besides device manager ata/atapi control? vexed but appreciative of the help, fj

8782	12	110383	1260015	1259980	frankzxcv	6/23/05 5:40 PM	1.1195484E12	interim results	well i pulled the extraneous fan and all extra drives, no help. ran the basic seagate online test, no errors. will try their bigger diagnostic-- have to shut down and plug in floppy drive for that! later - fj
8782	13	110383	1260109	1260015	frankzxcv	6/23/05 6:51 PM	1.11955266E12	boy am i dumb	well after all this fuss and feathers, turns out i had switched off the primary slave in cmos in earlier attempts to isolate the problem, (which i now think was both a bad drive and/or mobo drivers). so i switched it back on (CMOS wasn't recognizing the problem drive altho windows WAS, only it went to plain dma due to that, which is how it kept fooling me) everything working now, thanks to all. okay well i think I will put the better power supply back cheers and good night --fj

8782	15	110383	1320479	1260134	frankzxcv	7/25/05 2:17 PM	1.12230102E12	it was the pwoer supply	just wanted to post the conclusion, yep, all the other remedies did not work but a new antec PS and no problems since. hooray- fj
8782	16	110383	1338873	1320479	frankzxcv	8/3/05 3:11 PM	1.12308186E12	not the pS. back to square one	okay, it was NOT the power supply, at least, the new PS did not solve the problem. I am wondering if this is being caused by some sort of problem with the Liteon DVD drive. guess i will see if there is some driver patch or something to try - fj

You can check this list. 1. No bad caps. 2. Latest drive firmware and BIOS. 3. Latest motherboard drivers. 4. No CD/DVD emulators. Bob
