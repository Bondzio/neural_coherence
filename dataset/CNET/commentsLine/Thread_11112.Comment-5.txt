hello.
i installed this cdburnerxp.
but it didn't work after i selected all the files, and click on burn.
it will pop up a window, and in a few seconds.
the entire program will disappear from the screen as if i didn't open it at all.
i did it last night, i thought that i did something wrong.
so i did it again today, it is doing it again.
