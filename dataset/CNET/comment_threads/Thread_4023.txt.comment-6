We managed to catch the neighbor's broadband signal.
Had to install the software.
We are able to get on the net, but the signal is pretty low.
Right now, I'm at 11 Mbps.
My husband says the closer he gets to the neighbor's house, the better it gets (of course.)
Keep in mind, we're in a metal house.
Is it possible to amplify this signal, in an affordable way?
