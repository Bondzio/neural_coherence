last week my sony pc started re-booting itself every 10-15 minutes.
very annoying.it is about 4 years old and i've never had it apart.
knew it needed to be done but was procrastinating.
so, i bit the bullet and pulled it apart and boy, was it nasty.
cleaned it out with vacuum cleaner (dustbuster) and compressed air.
be careful, if you aim the air can downwards, water may come out.
not nice for your electronics.
i used an old toothbrush and flicked the dust out where the vacuum could grab it.
while apart i powered it up just long enough to verify that both the rear fan and the processor fan were running up to speed.the fins between the fan and processor were really clogged up and was probably the cause of my problem.
no problems since!
