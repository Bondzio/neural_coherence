to answer you question about cluster sizes, technically it is a performance vs. disk space issue.
files on any file system are placed into clusters.
if a file is larger than the cluster, it must put the rest of the data into another cluster.
however, if the file is smaller than the size of the cluster, the remaining space inside the cluster is wasted.
this is called slack.
take these examples: 16k cluster size: - file is 30k in size.
this would take 2 clusters and leave 2k of slack.
- file is 1k in size (cookies for example).
this would take 1 cluster, but have 15k of slack.
32k cluster size: - file is 30k in size.
this would take only 1 cluster and leave 2k of slack.
- file is 1k in size.
this would take only 1 cluster, but have 31k of slack.
64k cluster size: - file is 30k in size.
this would take only 1 cluster and leave 34k of slack.
- file is 1k in size.
this would take only 1 cluster, but have 63k of slack.
in conclusion - the larger the cluster size the fewer the number of clusters there are.
therefore the performance is faster.
however, as you can see, the larger the cluster size, the greater the loss of space available because only one file is allowed to occupy a single cluster at a time.
i hope this answers your question.
