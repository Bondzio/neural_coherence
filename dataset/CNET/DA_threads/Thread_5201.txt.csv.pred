1.1.1	Ok.	St
1.1.2	I download movie torrents and the cinavia is having a big impact on my streaming to my ps3.	St
1.1.3	Should I buy a set top box with streaming capabilities?	St
1.1.4	Or a video card with HDMI out and buy a really long HDMI cable?	St
1.1.5	I like the ability to control what i watch from the couch.	St
1.1.6	The set top box would let me do that.	Sug
1.1.7	If i go the video card route, is there a way to control my pc from the couch?	St
1.2.1	Your PS3 has DLNA-built into it, which means that a DLNA-server software installed on your PC can stream video, music and photos to your PS3 (which you then can watch/listen to on your TV).	St
1.2.2	So, all you need to do is connect your PC and PS3 to your home network using Ethernet cable or wireless (Ethernet cable is best, but it you go wireless, choose wireless N if you want to stream HD video).	St
1.2.3	Once all connected to your home network and you have installed a DLNA server on your PC, you will see the DLNA server's icon appear on your PS3.	St
1.2.4	On your PS3, you will be able to browse your folders/files and play them as you want.	St
1.2.5	For DLNA-servers, I'd suggest Mezzmo as it is my favorite after playing with all the others but there are free ones as well.	St
1.3.1	Thank you for your response and I apologize for how long it has taken me to respond to you.	St
1.3.2	I currently use Tversity, free version.	St
1.3.3	So, if I get a DLNA server, then if I try to stream something that is protected by Cinavia, it will still stream?	St
1.3.4	And an unrelated question.	St
1.3.5	Do you know how to turn off the windows media center streaming because I don't like two icons appearing on my PS3.	St
1.3.6	I know it's petty and picky but I'm picky.	St
1.4.1	I don't have direct experience using audio/video files with Cinavia DRM (...I try to avoid DRM as much as possible) but I think PS3s support Cinavia DRM, so if your DLNA server streams the file to your PS3, it may just work.	St
1.4.2	I'd try it and see how you go.	St
1.4.3	If no success, I'd ask the developers of your DLNA server for their help.	St
1.4.4	To turn off Windows Media Center, google is your friend - http://www.google.com/search?q=turn+off+windows+media+center+streaming	St
