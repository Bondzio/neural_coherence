<s> I have an issue with my motherboard. </s>
<s> If I install any new RAM other than what I used when I built my computer I can't use sleep mode. </s>
<s> The reason why, is that when I try waking my computer up, my processor idles at 50% and windows becomes EXTREMELY unstable and I have to shut down. </s>
<s> I have none of these issues when I boot up and my computer passes all stability tests. </s>
<s> So there is something wrong with the motherboard somewhere. </s>
<s> So my question is, should I install the new RAM and never use sleep mode, or keep my current RAM and be able to use sleep mode? </s>
<s> And I don't want to rma the motherboard because if I am going to go through that hassle I will just buy a new, better motherboard. </s>
<s> It's just one of many bugs with lots of ram and various versions of Windows. </s>
<s> You didn't supply any detail so here's just one of the dozen or so articles about this -&gt; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929734 Remember I have no details to work with. </s>
<s> But it is a known problem with many versions of Windows. </s>

<s> I have an Asus M3A motherboard, the memory that works is G.Skill DDR2 800 mhz 2x1GB and I am trying to install Crucial Ballistix DDR2 800mhz 2x2GB. </s>
<s> And I have Vista Home Premium 64bit. </s>
<s> Microsoft seems to leave us with such bugs. </s>
<s> They tend to fix them when a computer maker like Dell wants to sell a box with Windows and the engineers get to work to find and patch the bug. </s>
<s> Sorry but did you go looking in the KB (knowledge base) for your issue? </s>
<s> I did it once just as an example and now it's your turn. </s>
