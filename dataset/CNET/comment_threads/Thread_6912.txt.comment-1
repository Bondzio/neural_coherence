I have a Gateway laptop (Windows Vista) with a built-in wireless receiver.
I like to work outside (mall food court, park, sidewalk cafe, etc.)
and cannot always get a good signal from the nearby free wi-fi transmitters.
Could someone recommend an external antenna/receiver, that is plug and play via a USB connection, to help receive the weak signals?
Thanks, AC
