My system reported a degraded RAID array and one hard drive became inaccessible.
The motherboard and hard drive were replaced, but the same problem recurred in 4 weeks.
Hard drive was then replaced again, but the problem repeated immediately.
HP proposes trying the hard drive replacement again.
Machine is running Windows 7 64 bit, and I have made no hardware modifications.
It was purchased in January, 2011.
Has anyone experienced this problem?
Can anything else be done to solve this problem?
