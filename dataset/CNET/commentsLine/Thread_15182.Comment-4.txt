cmos is reset by removing the button battery, yes?
if so, then i have done that, both before and after replacing the drive.
the discs are from the manufacturer.
so, according to you guys, i can trust them.
as far as changing any settings in bios, i can't even get to it.
the computer gets as far as the hp screen, then freezes there.
i've tried repeatedly pressing the button that would cause it to go to the options shown on the hp screen - not sure which one leads to bios, but i think it's the one that you press esc for.
doesn't do anything - either i can't get in before it freezes, or the new drive lacks anything on it for it to go to.
the computer does start to run the recovery disc and gets as far as the recovery homepage, so it knows it's there and is able to access it.
but i can't get it to do anything from the disc.
any chance replacing the sata cable would fix this?
or is this for sure something like the motherboard?
(computer is about three years old and out of warranty.)
