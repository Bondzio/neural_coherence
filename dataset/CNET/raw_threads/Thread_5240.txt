I just bought a new Macbook, and was told to bring my old CPu from my Dell desktop to the Apple store and they would transfer my stuff. So, I unplugged, &amp; disconnected the entire desk top mess of screen, speakers, wireless stuff, printer and assorted cords, etc. and brought the big 'box' into Apple. Originally I was told they could 'clean' the old unit out for me. Now they say I have to do this. a couple of things, - am not very computer literate/ don't have all my original disks from Dell - it is easily 6 years old.... I want to give it away, but do I really have to hook it all back up and then buy a disk to clean it out???. I will never remember what cord went where.... any ideas???
