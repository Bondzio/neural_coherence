1.1.1	Hello , I have a small 3 comp .	St
1.1.2	home network ( Win XP pro ) .	St
1.1.3	All machines have fixed IP adresses .	St
1.1.4	I have a switch and through it the comp .	St
1.1.5	connect to ADSL .	St
1.1.6	It works fine , but as soon as I add my laptop to the LAN ( connect it to the switch ) , the LAN looses internet connectivity .	St
1.1.7	As soon as I disconnect the laptop , the internet is back , why ?	Ques
1.1.8	The switch has 5 ports + uplink to the ADSL modem .	St
1.1.9	Regards , Mirza	St
1.2.1	If the laptop has Windows Internet Connection Sharing option enabled , its fixed IP address will cause problems .	St
1.3.1	Why the static ipaddresses ?	Ques
1.3.2	Did your ISP provide you with those numbers ?	Ques
1.3.3	If they provide you only one ipaddress , then you better have a router after your modem .	St
1.3.4	Your switch is not going to help you .	St
1.3.5	If you have one ipaddress from your ISP , does your modem have router function ?	Ques
1.3.6	You do n't really need a switch unless you do n't have enough ports on the router for all your computers which possibly is your case .	St
1.3.7	More info please .	Sug
1.4.1	Do n't have ports in ADSL modem , that 's why I use a switch ... Do n't know why I use static ip adresses , my switch has 5 ports + uplink ...	St
1.4.2	Regards , Mirza	St
1.5.1	You need a router , unless your modem has router functionality .	St
1.5.2	You could set up an ICS , but it just complicates the setup .	St
1.5.3	If you want a wired router , find one that will have enough ports to accommodate all your computers .	St
1.5.4	If you want a wireless router , you should be able to find one with at least 3 or 4 ports to accommodate your wired computers .	St
1.5.5	You can also connect your switch to the router make room for more computers .	St
1.6.1	Since you mentioned you only have one port on your modem , I 'm pretty sure it does not have router function .	St
1.6.2	You need the router to give you more than one local ipaddress on your multiple computers .	St
1.6.3	The router serves as a NAT/DHCP and knows which of your many computer made the request for a certain internet page .	St
