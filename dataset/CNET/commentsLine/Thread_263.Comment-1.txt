i'm planning a trip to asia in the near future and am looking for a tablet to use only for reading.
i need something that has a back light for low-light reading and i need something that has minimal glare for high-light environments.
i've considered the kindle paperwhite, but i have no hands-on experience with it.
i have an ipad that i use for other activities... this new device is only intended for reading.
aside from the visibility factor, weight is also a concern.
anyone have recommendations?
thanks!
