1.1.1	I have Super OS 10.10 ( Ubuntu ) I was wondering if it will work on a netbook ?	Ques
1.1.2	Thanks in advance ... Muldarfbi ,	St
1.2.1	Be sure to check all the features .	St
1.2.2	If it fails there are at least a dozen other versions to look at .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	SuperOS is , most likely , too heavy for a netbook .	St
1.3.2	Leenux is a good one , but there are many others -- Please see some of the distros developed for netbooks here http : //linux.softpedia.com/get/System/Operating-Systems/Linux-Distributions/Ubuntu-Netbook-Remix-Maverick-Meerkat-57326.shtml not just the one the link points to .	St
1.3.3	Best wishes !	St
