i should have re-read your first post where you stated the drive worked internally.
has this drive ever worked externally?
if not, then it has to be the drivers for the external case.
have you tried it without closing up the case?
i..e.. just laying the drive flat while connected to the case?
could be this drive is defective in that it won't work with the usb interface for some reason.
frankly, i've never come across this problem.
you may still have to migrate your files to a different drive and go that route.
good luck and let us know what you end up doing.
and life goes on... jack
