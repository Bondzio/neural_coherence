<s> I have installed a new SATA card and get &quot;Plug&Play configuration error press F1 to continue or F2 to enter startup&quot; What settings need to be changed? </s>
<s> Win XP home edition SP2, Demsion 8200 Thanks Ron </s>
<s> I don't know who made the &quot;Demsion 8200&quot; but it's time to talk to them about the BIOS. </s>

<s> I found a BIOS upgrade and installed it, it didn't solve the problem. </s>

<s> See if the BIOS has a clear CMOS configuration or move the card to another slot. </s>

<s> I had the same error on my Dell Optiplex 240, 1.5mhz, 256MB, 80gig, win2000 pro system, when I tried to install the pinnacle studio av/dv card on my system. </s>
<s> I talked with dell support as well as pinnacle support, basically had already tried what they told me to try, different PCI slots and taking all cards out that I could except that one and configuration setup to no avail. </s>
<s> Ended up taking it back to Best Buy for a refund! </s>
<s> So much for those tech support people reading it from a manual. </s>
<s> They were no help. </s>
<s> I'am finding out that here on Cnet and myself are the best tech support. </s>

<s> If there have been usage/installation problems they usually try to post solutions on their web sites. </s>
<s> I gave up and returned the card to Fry's, Thanks for all the good suggestions. </s>
