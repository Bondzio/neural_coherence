Finally I solved my problem, it was after all the Power Supply problem.
I bought a new power supply and my computer is alive again.
Even though no burnt smell and the fuse is still intact the power supply is not working as it should be.
I wonder what could have caused it to break down.
I also bought an AVR (automatic voltage regulator) for protection.
Actually this is the 3rd power supply I have installed on my computer.
These are of Swithcing Mode type.
I don't know if that kind of power supply could have caused it to break down or the electrical spikes in our house since I don't use a good surge protector or an AVR.
Anyway thanks for all those who responded to my problem.
