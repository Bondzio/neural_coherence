1.1.1	Hello, I am looking to buy a new desktop and I was wondering if I should buy a Area-51 7500 or Dell 710 H2C.	St
1.1.2	I am an extreme gamer and is looking for performance, so if any one could tell me which one I should get and why please tell me because I am on the fence with this because I like the fact the the Dell is over clocked, but the alienware has a newer motherboard and faster ram and I don't know which one to chose.thx	Sug
1.2.1	I personally prefer the Dell 710 H2C.	St
1.2.2	But I thought i might recommend this website.	St
1.2.3	Its brilliant and not too expensive for custom built computers.	St
1.2.4	http://www.cyberpowerpc.com/Default.asp http://www.ibuypower.com/mall/lobby.htm	St
1.3.1	Why if you don't mind me asking?	St
1.4.1	They are pretty well matched and both pretty much offer the same but I prefer the look of the Dell more.	St
1.4.2	The dell is more expensive but the Area-51 is more customizable.	St
