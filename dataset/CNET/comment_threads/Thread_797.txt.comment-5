Ok..I see what your saying.
I think I will just at the Wireless point.
I know this sounds crazy but the network is already sensitive enough, lol, i would rather add downstream.
I am on my 2nd router in 3 years and about every 3 or 4 days it seems I have to reboot the router for unknow reasons.
I starting to wonder if its my ISP doing that somehow.
I know they would rather me pay an extra 10 bucks a month per IP address..
ThANKS AGAIN
