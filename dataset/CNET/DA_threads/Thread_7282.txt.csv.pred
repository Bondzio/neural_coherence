1.1.1	I recently purchased a 1 gig stick of PQI Turbo low latency ddr400 ram, part number PQI3200-1024SBL.	St
1.1.2	I mistakenly believed it was 2x512 mb.	St
1.1.3	I'm thinking of trying to match this stick with another 1 gig stick for dual channel mode on a nforce4 939 motherboard (JetWay 939GT4SLI-G-VC).	St
1.1.4	Can anyone tell me if there's another brand that will do dual channel with it?	Ques
1.1.5	Finding the exact same ram stick for an acceptable price is problematic.	St
1.1.6	Specifications Part Number: PQI3200-1024SBL Package: 1024MB single pack Organization: 128M x 64-bit CAS Latency: 2-3-2-5 Test Voltage: 2.6 V PCB Board: 8 Layers PCB Speed: DDR 400 MHz (PC3200) Type: 184-pin DDR SDRAM Error Checking: Non-ECC Registered/Unbuffered: Unbuffered Thanks in advance!

1.2.1	the mobo will use the slower of the two sticks' timings.	St
1.3.1	What RAM is in it now ...1-512MB, 2-512MBs, 1GB now ?	Ques
1.3.2	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	wintec ampo ram there now, but hoping the 1 gig pqi ram stick can be paired with a similar stick for dual channel.	St
1.4.2	i just don't want to buy another stick and have them not work together.	St
1.5.1	Looks like there are matching DIMMs available ....what MB or system do you have now ?	Ques
1.5.2	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	dual channel is based on bank size, not stick size.	St
1.6.2	move the 2 512mb sticks into the first bank and put the 1gb sticks in the second bank.	Sug
1.6.3	you'll wind up with 2gb in dual channel mode.	St
