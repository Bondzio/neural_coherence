<s> I have an iPAQ RZ1710, and need to get a portable printer, chances are: Canoni80 or HP 450cbi. </s>
<s> Will I be able to send data from tha iPAQ to any of those printers? </s>
<s> Is it possible via infrared ? </s>
<s> (both printers have the same IR type?) </s>
<s> Is any problem that the Canon i80 doesn't recognize the OS that iPAQ has?.... </s>
<s> I am quiet confused by now. </s>
<s> I'll appreciate your help. </s>

<s> If you research this, you find HP did support their own. </s>
<s> There are drivers for other printers but will cost you in the 30 to 200 dollar range. </s>
<s> Go lookup PRINTBOY for example. </s>
