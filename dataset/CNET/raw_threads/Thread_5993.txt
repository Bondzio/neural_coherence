They are as follows: 2x2 sticks of Patriot Sector5 Ram (4 Gigs in total DDR3) Running dual channel with two slots open. PC3-12800 MHZ The motherboard is Biostar A770E3 AM2+ Compatible. Processor is AMD 6-Core 2.86 GHZ Phenom II. (1055T) Video Card is a GeForce GT 430 (1024 MB of DDR3 RAM.) 1 Terabyte Sata-II 7200 RPM Hard drive. (Old IDE DVD drive as temp-Ordering new one soon) So, the problem is: On boot up it won't boot from any discs or usb drives. I haven't installed anything to this computer, I've never built a computer from scratch, but I have put them together hundreds of times before. The only thing that the computer displays after boot is this &quot;Hardware Monitor&quot; It tells me the specs of the system. Anything that might help is appreciated. And if I find the answer, I'll be sure to post it.

Is your cd drive IDE ? Is it cbl select or set as master or slave ? Usually set the cd as master alone with 1 hdd sata connected. Or if hdd and cd are IDE , use the same cable with hdd as master and cd as slave.

Yes, I've gone into the bios and changed the boot order, I've also pressed F9 and selected which device to boot from. The drives are set properly~I'm not really a novice at this. I've actually never asked a forum for help before.
10760	3	523198	5113839	5113777	my-tech	4/8/11 9:29 AM	1.30225494E12	So then....	Your sure the cd IDE is master by itself on end of chain ? Some cdroms only like cbl select with some mbs. Did u enable sata in bios too ?
10760	4	523198	5113920	5113839	MorbidMuffin	4/8/11 11:14 AM	1.30226124E12	IDE	The IDE cable is definitely a master, with the end of the cable used. The hard drive isn't the problem, as I've never installed anything onto it before. In order to install something on it~I need a disc drive that reads discs. Right? I've tried a USB memory stick and it didn't boot either. I've got someone to lend me a Sata DVD burner. As the motherboard is naturally SATA-II anyway. Thinking on it, I've come to the conclusion that it must be the ancient technology that the motherboard simply doesn't recognize without the drivers. If there is anything in between that might help~ Like, I haven't installed the BIOS drivers yet, because it can't read the discs to get the drivers.

Maybe &quot;cable select &quot; if not noticed when on master. Did u enable sata in the bios. Bring it here I'll fix it or tell u what broke in 10 minutes !! Now your forcing my hand lol I have to ask what this exactly means &quot;I've never built a computer from scratch, but I have put them together hundreds of times before.&quot;

10760	7	523198	5113983	5113941	MorbidMuffin	4/8/11 1:15 PM	1.3022685E12	kay.	Uh, I believe that the motherboard is SATA-II and therefore as I've said, the SATA ports work just fine :P I think you wouldn't be able to fix it in ten minutes xD Yes, again, I said the CD drive is set to master. As well It means, I've taken apart and rebuilt already built computers hundreds of times. But I've never purchased a mobo and all the parts and put them together and installed everything. I think you're starting to sound arrogant. It's not appreciated.
10760	8	523198	5114007	5113983	my-tech	4/8/11 2:01 PM	1.30227126E12	Hey I'm just trying to help	But youve missed what I suggested, Try this .... Make sure you remove the power cord from the back first. Unplug all hdd and CDROM Unscrew the CDROM and take it out, now check where it says the lil jumper should b to make it master. Now put the CDROM back in and make sure it's on the end of the IDE cable. Now see if u can boot the cd, if not, remove the CDROM again and put the lil jumper on cable select. Put it back in and see if u can boot. If the it does boot either as master or cbl select then try another IDE cable and/or CDROM If you get the CDROM working reconnect the hdd , go into the bios and find where it enables sata and make sure it's enabled. If neither the Ide or the sata don't work I would think bad mobo or maybe although less likely the psu or try switching ram I would also check the temperatures inside the bios Last hope reseat the CPU Computers eh

10760	11	523198	5114093	5114053	MorbidMuffin	4/8/11 5:10 PM	1.3022826E12	Well;	It doesn't make any beeps. I know that the mobo isn't updated~No discs or memory sticks work on this computer.
