well have tried youir method and found the same results.
give this a try right click on the desktop, and then click properties.
this should bring up display properties, and from there you need to need to click on the settings tab.
now in the setting folder look for and click on the advance tab.
once this opens a new window, look for adaptor tab, and click it.
now you will need to look for some thing listed as the display adaptor and there should be a properties button for said.
click on this and look for drivers tab, when you find this look for update driver click there and point it in the direction of your drivers.
let us know if htis helps.
