hi, i saw the editorial review of ximeta ndas drive which has received high points.
it looks impressive,however; i have a few doubts - 1. the review said that it does not have media server capabilities : i would like to know what this exactly means because one of the test details provided was read/write and access time for media.
2. would i be able to remote-access the drive using a vpn (hamachi) thank you
