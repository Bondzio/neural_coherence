1.1.1	Alright this is my situation .	St
1.1.2	I had a Win XP Compaq laptop but it 's screen broke and it was old anyways so i bought a new HP Pavilion dv2000 .	St
1.1.3	This one has vista installed .	St
1.1.4	Next i thought I 'd get my old data on the new laptop and then keep my old Seagate 2.5 ' 120GB hard drive as an external one .	St
1.1.5	It seemed simple but it 's been driving me crazy for 3 days .	St
1.1.6	I searched many topics but nobody has this problem .	St
1.1.7	Anyways , i bought a Coolpodz IDE enclosure and hooked it up and everything .	St
1.1.8	The laptop recognizes that a disk drive has been plugged http : //img215.imageshack.us/my.php ? image=safeix5.jpg but i ca n't see it on My Computer .	St
1.1.9	Disk management says this : http : //img184.imageshack.us/img184/355/unreadak1.jpg I am starting to get really pissed off with this thing , although i am pretty sure it 's something simple ( maybe a faulty enclosure ) .	St
1.1.10	By the way i have tried setting it as master , as slave and even tried a brand new Western Digital 120Gb hdd but still same results .	St
1.1.11	Same thing on my desktop which runs WinXp , so i 'm guessing it 's not vista 's fault .	St
1.1.12	Any help appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	2 .	St
1.2.2	No , you 're the first to have this issue here .	St
1.2.3	No you 're not .	St
1.2.4	Try the usuals .	St
1.2.5	a ) GETDATABACK b ) ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY 3 .	St
1.2.6	Use the USB cable that came with the case .	St
1.3.1	i have already tried all of those .	St
1.3.2	and btw data recovery software do n't work because i don'thave a drive letter for it .	St
1.4.1	As such you make me cast doubt you have tried them .	St
1.5.1	well i have n't tried those exact programs but it 's the same thing with all of them .	St
1.5.2	this is what ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY gives http : //img230.imageshack.us/my.php ? image=zarxv2.jpg	Ques
1.6.1	GETDATABACK does n't even list my drive .	St
1.7.1	And please do n't hold back such great clues .	Sug
1.7.2	There is another method where we use a DESKTOP and a laptop drive adapter along with these titles .	St
1.7.3	If those fail in the desktop the next stop is to ask http : //www.drivesavers.com Bob	St
1.8.1	This means we have to move to the desktop attempts and if that fails we are hitting the end of DIY repairs .	St
1.9.1	I 'm starting to think it 's the enclosure 's fault .	St
1.9.2	what do u think ?	Ques
1.10.1	We get off USB since it limits what can be done .	St
1.10.2	Bob	St
1.11.1	i have no idea what that is	Res
1.12.1	Link - & gt ; http : //www.geeks.com/details.asp ? invtid=HD-108 & cat=HDD Then I can use these tools on a desktop to get back drives that we ca n't in the USB enclosures .	St
1.12.2	Some consumers wo n't be able to do this so they 'll have to deal with http : //www.drivesavers.com or similar .	St
1.12.3	Bob PS .	St
1.12.4	Do n't fret it if we are hitting the limits of home data recovery .	St
1.12.5	It happens and is how most learn that they need to address their backup plans .	St
1.13.1	i do n't wan na go through anymore trouble .	St
1.13.2	thank you so much for your efforts though .	Polite
