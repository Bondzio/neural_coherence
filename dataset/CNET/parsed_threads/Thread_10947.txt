<s> Seems Ultra has what I'm looking for in a power supply: At least 25 amps on the +12V. </s>
<s> Modular design - use only the cables needed. </s>
<s> Powerful enough for a powerful rig. </s>
<s> Not too expensive. </s>
<s> I don't know anything about Ultra, though, but did read a somewhat favorable review at PCStats. </s>
<s> Thanks for any comments </s>
<s> except i'm not sure whether ultra is a reputable brand </s>

<s> The two reviews I've found so far say they're good also. </s>
