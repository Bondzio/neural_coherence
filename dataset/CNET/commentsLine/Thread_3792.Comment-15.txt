most often you cannot partition a hard drive that is one big partition in xp, simply because you will damage files needed to operate it.
througout the hard drive and os, it is configured as one large drive, if you change this, it throws the system out of whack and can destroy your os to where you need to install it again.
the whole drive is considered operating \running which you cannot change a partition that is in use by the os.
when you install your os you have to create a smaller primary partition, enough for the os to operate.
then you can partition the hard drive from disk management since whole drive will not be in use.
most partition softwares will warn of even trying this due to the above mentioned.
most partition softwares will simply not even attempt it or give you an error message.
much like my xp, 80 gig, i had to install xp on a 20 gig portion, then partition from there after xp was installed.
i could not accomplish this prior.
i don't think your restoration cd is not working due to updated version so much as a problem with the update itself.
((however your system has to support booting from external devices or it won't either way.))
