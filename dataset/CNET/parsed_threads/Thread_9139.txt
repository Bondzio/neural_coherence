<s> What is the best way I can monitor the browsing on my home network. </s>
<s> For example: I would like to see what sites other people in my family are going to. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> And some routers can forward such to a certain PC then that PC runs a logging program. </s>
<s> This is not something easy to setup and those that can't find such logging software usually can't set it up. </s>
<s> Sorry if it seems hard but it is. </s>
<s> Again, look for SYSLOG http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog Now that you have SYSLOG on your PC, your router can forward messages to that and you have your monitoring. </s>

<s> You can check the DNS Resolver cache to see what sites have been visited. </s>
<s> Simply open a command prompt and enter, ipconfig /displaydns. </s>
<s> Some browsers also leave a list of Typed URLs in the registry. </s>
