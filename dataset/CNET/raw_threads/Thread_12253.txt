I know the low-end Netgear routers have a very limited logging system. I've never used any of the Netgear Prosafe models. But I don't know how they compare to the Linksys models, for example Linksys BEFSX41. I'd love to get some advice on this withouth me going out and buying each brand and having to try each one out.
