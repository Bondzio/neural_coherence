$245 is outrageous for a motherboard.
I'm not a gamer but I am curious.
Maybe in the future I'll try an SLI setup.
I have always wanted to build a super high-end system for some reason, but I am going to wait until prices drop and newer boards come out with the dual x16 slots.
I read a customer review of the board where the guy had to tweak stuff in the bios to get it working properly; the customer specially mentioned it is not a novice board.
I going to wait and let the competiton fight each other.
