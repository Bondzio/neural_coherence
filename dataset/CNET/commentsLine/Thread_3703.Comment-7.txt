yeah it works fine wired, but check this out.
my work space is not (not) next to my modem.
so in order to do this, i would have to haul all my stuff to my modem to work.
this is not feasable, therefore i require either wifi or 150 ft of cat 5 for my wife to trip over or complain about.
as it turns out, i don't have an extra computer to use as a router, and buying one to do that seems counterintuitive.
is that more clear?
