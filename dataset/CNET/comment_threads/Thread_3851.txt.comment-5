Thank you for the reply, so from what I gather you are saying a 2.0 drive will work with my computer I will just not be taking advantage of the fast speeds I could be if I had a 2.0 usb correct?
Quick answer...&quot;YES&quot; But keep in mind mind...&quot;USB&quot; is the interface standard between the external HDD enclosure and the PC.... it has nothing to do with the drive itself.
Even faster is the eSATA interface and for future use...it's faster than USB 2.0.
If possible ...get an external with USB 2.0 and eSATA.
