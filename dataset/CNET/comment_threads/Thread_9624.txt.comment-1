I am looking for a sleek external bluray drive, it must be able to write dvd &amp; cd's as well.
I bought a laptop without an optical drive and I want to be able to throw an external drive in my laptop case and have it for trips (watching blurays, burning cds, etc).
I have 2 questions: 1) I have USB 3.0 capabilities, should I take advantage of that on this purchase?
2) What should I buy?
