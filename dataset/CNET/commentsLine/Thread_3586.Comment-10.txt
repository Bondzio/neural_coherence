i am not sure if you still need this help, but someone might.
i had a simular problem, but i fixed it with a setting change on the router.
i just reduced the speed of the router to something more resonable, like 11mbps.
this shouldn't affect any speed across the internet since most dsl speeds don't go over 11mbps.
