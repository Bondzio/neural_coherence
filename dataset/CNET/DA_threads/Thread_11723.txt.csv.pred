1.3.1	for reading purposes you have many apps which let you get a perfect reading experience..also the display and the resolution of the screen boost the quality.. for games nexus 7 is definitely the best..and by connecting a keyboard and mouse or a gamepad to the nexus using an otg cable you will have great fun as processor is very fast..no issues of hanging or crashing just go with this brief comparison : http : //www.tabletcurry.com/compare-tablets.php ? ctablet [ ] =Asus+Google+Nexus+7+ % 282013 % 29+16GB & ctablet [ ] =Amazon+Kindle+Fire+HD+7+16GB the website is for india so dont think about price or date of release..
