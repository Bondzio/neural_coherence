ok, i know this sounds wierd, but it has really happened and i'm bummed.
i have an amd athlon xp 2200+ (1.8 ghz).
everything was going smoothly until--as usual-- i had to format my hd and reinstall xp prp sp2.
after installation, for some reason my cpu is recognized as amd athlon xp 1500+ (1.3 ghz).
it is really killing me.
i would really appreciate it if someone could tell what in the world is wrong!
