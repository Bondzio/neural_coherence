you just about get the hang of the http and java stuff and now you've got to learn about w.t.f 128bit encription and have to spend hours pressing the reset button on your router for 5 seconds to reset it cos uve buggered up the port forwarding and your virtual server behind your nat firewall is getting all menstrual and is using the wrong port so your torrents wont download.... yeah i recon its nothing to do with your internet connection its all about configuring your wireless bits.
i eventually sorted mine out by assigning my own ip's gateways etc and then it would still connect and disconnect every 5 mins until in my local area connection properties under authenticaton uncheck the enable ieee 802blablabla box.
now (touch wood) it seems to be working perfectly.
best of luck though buddy.
