<s> My PC is suddenly not automatically playing CD's or DVD discs when I insert it in the drive. </s>
<s> It use to come up (AutoPlay) whenever I inserted a disc. </s>
<s> The only way it will AutoPlay now is if I boot up the PC with a disc already in the DVD drive. </s>
<s> I have already tried to update the driver in Windows XP (Home Edition) and I even checked the Registry to see if the drive is set to AutoPlay. </s>
<s> The drive itself is a Pioneer DVD 16X slot drive. </s>
<s> My DVD drive is set to Secondary Slave, and I have a CD burner (TDK 40X) is set to Secondary Master. </s>
<s> If I am forgetting any information, just let me know, and I will post it. </s>
<s> Thanks for any info you can provide. </s>
<s> Same here. </s>
<s> Almost identical situation. </s>
<s> Did you upgrade the driver for your AMD motherboard recently? </s>
<s> That's the only thing I've done, and I wonder if I screwed something up there. </s>
<s> I hope someone can help us out. </s>
<s> I just remembered, I just upgraded the AGP driver for the motherboard, and I'm pretty sure that wouldn't cause the problem you and I are having. </s>
<s> Someone help us! </s>
<s> I have since resolved the DVD and CD burner drives not Autoplaying, but I probably did it the hard way no thanks to this forum. </s>
<s> I finally ended up reformating my hard drive and reinstalling Windows XP. </s>
<s> I noticed in my Windows XP, in the Device Manager under IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers that the primary and secondary channels under my properties that XP was missing the Advance Settings tab which has DMA settings for the drives. </s>
<s> I have a Asus P4PE motherboard which is a Intel based. </s>
<s> If I were you, I would try uninstalling the motherboard drivers and reinstalling them first. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work, you may have to do it like I did. </s>
<s> Hope this helps you out. </s>
<s> Oh, another possible solution for you might be to try System Restore if you have XP like I do. </s>
<s> It didn't work for me because my Windows XP was totally shot! </s>
<s> Fresh Windows XP install seemed to be my only option. </s>
<s> My Autoplay problem is solved. </s>
<s> http://www.kellys-korner-xp.com/xp_tweaks.htm Download &quot;Enable CD AutoPlay for Pro&quot; (tweak # 10). </s>
<s> I had to disable my anti-virus software to do it. </s>
<s> (I didn't have any security issues resulting from this.) </s>
<s> That fixed it! </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
