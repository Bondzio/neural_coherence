I recently defragged all my hard drives, and i am doing some editing with premiere 6.5. now any video I play from the d or e drive is VERY choppy and slow, but anything played from the c drive is fine. also, in xferring a big mgb file to the c drive, the xfer is slow and computer function is all herky jerky. dma is enabled on all drives, i restarted, no help. any ideas on how to trouble shoot? thanks - fj

I did install some new programs recently. how do i get out of slow pio mode for these 2 drives? i had pio mode once before but it was a faulty drive, how can I have 2 at once fail? sounds like a driver/ resource conflict maybe? help thanks fj
