i have an hp pavilion a4310f , 3ghz, 4gb ram, 640gb hd.
i have been unable to find this specific information online.
the motherboard photo shows 4 sata sockets.
i already have a 750gb storage drive installed, but am finding i need more storage space.
i am considering an additional 1-2 tb storage drive.
i presume in my case there are two more internal sata drives available, and the appropriate drive cages available for internal drives??
i am also assuming windows 7 will have no problem in handling data from this larger internal drive.
i cannot forsee any, it must only recognize the drive.
any comments would be appreciated.
grats.
