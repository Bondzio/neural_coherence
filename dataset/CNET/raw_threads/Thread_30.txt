However, before I did the fix, I went in another direction. I had thought the video card failed, but it appeared OK. The monitor itself shown a &quot;green LED&quot; saying it had a signal but no display. After a few minutes, I got the whiff of a burnt component, which then appeared to be the PSU as I usually suspect. But, the system was up and running and the smell did suggest that, but it seems the monitor itself had blown. I swapped it and all is OK. FYI - The Compaq 17in. monitor was made in 1995, so i got my money's worth. It was a used monitor and I had it for at least 5yrs. or slightly more. Strange to me, the monitor was made in Finland, I never noticed that. tada -----Willy

You will notice just about all system cases, PSUes, CDs, etc. are metal or metal lined besides the Faraday effect. The metal box retards the flames ability, but still is a threat if it really unnoticed or unattended. FYI - I have seen fires within production lines of some devices during rebuilds(refurbs) during final testing, it happens. tada -----Willy
