I'm looking at buying a APC UPS for my desktop.
(APC Back UPS RS 1300VA LCD 120V was recommended for my system by APC's website).
Every afternoon we have short bursts of thunderstorms.
Usually I power down my computer until the thunderstorms pass.
This avoids the hassle of blips of losing power (power goes off for 10 to 15 seconds) and having to reboot, see if data was lost, etc.
Also, I don't trust my surge protector to prevent my PC from getting fried.
Having to power down every day is really affecting my work production.
I work from home, so my single unit is my only worry.
Will a UPS allow me to continue working thru thunderstorms without losing power or lightning frying my PC?
