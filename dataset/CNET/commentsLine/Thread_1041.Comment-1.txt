i have comcast digital cable, and i don't have a network card.
i recently bought a network adapter for my playstation 2, and i don't have a correct plug for the network adapter.
if anyone has a network adapter, they know that you are supposed to plug in what looks like a phone jack.
what do i need to buy in able to use my network adapter?
someone has told me these: a router, a network card (which we tried and it didn't work), and a cat5 cable... please help!
