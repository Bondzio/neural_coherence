Lately, I've had a problem with my display when scrolling pages (on and off-line) and when dragging windows around. It'll go black and my monitor seems to reset and displace text and images when it reappears. I use Windows XP. I don't know if this is a hardware problem, but it really annoys me. Has anyone seen this before?

Before that, have your XP CD handy and run... SFC /SCANNOW If it still fails after a reboot, then research your video card make/model, go download and install the latest drivers, install, reboot and retest. Best of luck, Bob
