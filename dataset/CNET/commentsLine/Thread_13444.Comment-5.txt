i just recently got the thrive as a birthday gift.
it was something i have been researching for a long time!
i love it!
the functionality is great, i dont have to haul my laptop around and i can use it for all of my school work... i can put my sd card from my camera in it to look at pictures and email them, the usb is a big plus in my opinion and i use it constantly and the battery lasts really well... the only issue i have had is finding the right silverlight download for it... kim
