can take a tethered connection and share it to the wifi or ethernet to something else.
i can't teach you all it can do but it can do that.
armed with this title you can research other titles that do similar.
but i find some folk want more.
as this is a somewhat complicated setup you either dig in and learn networking or have it done for you.
i can offer titles that i've used but you must be comfortable with the tech since you get to own it.
to be hassle free is a tall order since you are dealing with vista and can't use the free virtual router.
