The pc is hard wired however I want to use the wireless for macbook. Only was able to get into the wireless using the admin password. Question #1 how do I change from using a default (admin) password to get into router ? Question#2 how do I set up a WPA Personal on the router?

I would just be copying the answer from the manual. If you are having a problem understanding the manual just supply the link to the manual, the page number, paragraph and members might rewrite it in English. Bob
