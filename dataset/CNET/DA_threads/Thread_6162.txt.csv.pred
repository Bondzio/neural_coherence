1.2.1	Over at www.pcpowerandcooling.com you can find PDF documents with exact dimensions of what I will call & quot ; standard size & quot ; ATX power supplies .	St
1.2.2	While I 've grown familiar with these to the point I can just look at the PSU then check the connections a new technician will need such a document and learn what the ATX , ATX12V and other power connections are as well as determine if the replacement supply has enough of each connection .	St
1.2.3	One owner spent a year seeking out a PSU because they could n't find & quot ; the right one. & quot ; They were looking for one with exactly the right number of power connections but imagine them passing up unit after unit because it has & quot ; too many & quot ; power connections .	St

1.3.1	Because you have a HP Pavilion system , you need a true fit or match .	St
1.3.2	While you can find replacement psu of larger wattage , it will be expensive for the reason mentioned .	St

1.3.4	Just be sure whatever replacement psu you do get is HP compatible and what the return policy is if a mistake is made .	St
