<s> My Linksys BEFSR41 router recently stopped working. </s>
<s> I cannot log into it, it cannot be pinged, the &quot;Diagnostic&quot; led is constantly on and no matter how many times I reset it I get nothing. </s>
<s> Before I send it to the scrapyard and buy a new one, has anyone else had this issue and is it fixable? </s>
<s> and sent it back to Linksys. </s>
<s> They repaired it and returned it (or a reasonable facsimile), of course I was still under warranty. </s>
<s> My Dad's unit died and since I had moved on the a &quot;G&quot; based router (20 bucks...) I shipped him my unit and he's back online. </s>

<s> You need to reset your router.on the back of the router there is a pinhole you stick a tack and hold fore about 10 seconds witht eh power on then everything will be back to normal </s>

<s> Some folks think turning it off and back on is a reset and are unaware of the pinhole in the back for restoring the factory settings. </s>

<s> Then let go of the pin/paperclip. </s>
<s> It takes two hands and some coordination...) Or it could have routed its last packet and now needs to be put out of its misery... dw </s>
<s> they do make good product with good price. </s>
<s> however, they don't seem to last too long. </s>
<s> I had the same model 3 years ago that fail on me after a year of service and recently, the G model that replace the old one failed on me too (after 1.5 years). </s>
<s> I guess that explain why the warranty only last for one year. </s>
