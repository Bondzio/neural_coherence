1.1.1	Dear Fellow customers , I brought my mother a kindle for Christmas and I love it .	St
1.1.2	I took it out the box to check it out and it was great , I actually started to feel a little jealous .	St
1.1.3	She is a huge reader and lover of books which she passed down to me .	St
1.1.4	Her eye sight is starting to go a bit and I thought a kindle would be a great gift .	St
1.1.5	Now for myself , I have a Samsung Galaxy 7 & quot ; Tablet which I love .	St
1.1.6	It is the perfect size for me .	St
1.1.7	I know a lot of people like 10 & quot ; but 7 & quot ; is the perfect size to carry around and hold in my hand .	St
1.1.8	It fits in my smallest purse and since I got it in April this year , I have never left home with it .	St
1.1.9	And while I do read all my ebooks on my tablet or netbook , I do really like that e ink for the eyes .	St
1.1.10	But I do other stuff on my tablet besides read .	St
1.1.11	Checking emails , reading news , listening to music , watching videos , playing games , wed surfing video chatting .	St
1.1.12	I do n't do any hard work on my tablet , it just for media use .	St
1.1.13	If I have to work , I rather use my laptop .	St
1.1.14	So after that long winded first paragraph ( this why I do n't post to boards to much , I am rambler and type like I am really talking to somebody , sorry but I am getting close to the end ) So my request is a dual sided media tablet .	St
1.1.15	It does not have to done right know but maybe sometime in the future .	St
1.1.16	I can be very patient .	St
1.1.17	A lot of things are in existence now that 10 or 15 years ago , I would have never imagined being possible .	St
1.1.18	Now I know people are going to jump down my throat about it ca n't happen or it has been done already by the enTourage Pocket eDGe Dualbook Android Tablet and e-Ink Reader but that is not what I want .	St
1.1.19	I had my Samsung and the kindle laying side by side on my bed , and all I could think was how perfect it would if you could just combine the two together .	St
1.1.20	I know people are going to say just buy a basic model kindle and use that with tablet or if I am already using the tablet as a reader just stick with the tablet .	St
1.1.21	But I have really falling in love with e ink screens .	St
1.1.22	It would be so nice to have to best of both worlds .	St
1.1.23	Plus I am lazy ; I do n't want to carry any more than I have to .	St
1.1.24	On to the third paragraph ( I lied about being close to the end ) , my idea for a perfect media tablet .	St
1.1.25	I am not going to quote any prices for the device or service plans because whatever I say people will found fault with it .	St
1.1.26	So the enTourage Pocket eDGe Dualbook had a screen on each side , but I think the screens should be back to back .	St
1.1.27	So basically you would have something like the Samsung galaxy tablet or even the kindle fire on one side and when you flip it over on the other side you have a basic touch type e ink screen .	St
1.1.28	It would came with a very basic case , you could always upgrade to better one .	St
1.1.29	The case would open from right side or left side depending which side you wanted to use .	St
1.1.30	It would be able easily flip back either side .	St
1.1.31	The tablet side would be the latest android system ( I am being greedy , I know ) and be 8 & quot ; while the reader would be 7 & quot ; .	St
1.1.32	The reader would a touch screen that would still have page turning buttons on the sides .	St
1.1.33	16 GB of internal storage , with room for another 16 GB to added though a media card slot .	St
1.1.34	Everything can also be saved in the cloud .	St
1.1.35	Add a camera , a microphone , stereo audio jack , and volume buttons .	St
1.1.36	It would have Wi-Fi and 3g .	St
1.1.37	Now before people start about the 3g , I do n't expect it to be free .	St
1.1.38	Amazon first and fore most is a business .	St
1.1.39	It would have to lose their minds to offer 3g free for the type of tablet I am talking about .	St
1.1.40	Maybe amazon could find a way to be able sync to your current phone plan , or offer separate date plans from other third party companies .	St
1.1.41	My favorite idea would be to somehow link a 3g option with the amazon prime membership , and yes I know the price would go up and you would not be able to pay yearly .	St
1.1.42	People who want to add 3g to their amazon prime membership would have to switch to a monthly plan .	St
1.1.43	Now before I sign off , I want to say that I am not a techie or business person at all .	St
1.1.44	This is just the ramblings of one person .	St
1.1.45	I was making it up as I was typing .	St
1.1.46	I even have a name for it- & quot ; Amazon now presents The Kindle Phoenix , an all in one media tablet & quot ; So now after that long winded letter , I am finally done .	St
1.1.47	I told you I was a rambler , sorry .	Polite
1.1.48	I would like to see if anybody had any thoughts , comments or helpful criticism about my dream dual sided tablet .	St
1.2.1	It was missing too many things to be a serious Android tablet .	St
1.2.2	No multi-touch , no G sensor and the list goes on .	St
1.2.3	My died after a few months and the company is no more .	St
1.2.4	No doubt in my mind why .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
