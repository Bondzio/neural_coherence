<s> Hi, I have a cisco linksys WAG320N router at the moment and I am wondering what would be a suitable range extender to use. </s>
<s> I really want the best one not too particular about the brand. </s>
<s> I just can't really find many reviews of range extenders online. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I find them to not always work with every router. </s>
<s> Because of that I use the old ROUTER AS A WAP solution. </s>

<s> Hi Vignesh, I have used the Linksys WRE54G in the past with clients and it has helped in all cases. </s>
<s> It is best to use an extender that is of the same make. </s>
<s> I hope this helps. </s>
<s> The most popular one is the WRE54G but not everyone prefers that model. </s>
<s> If you take a look at the reviews on http://www.wifirepeaterreviews.com you will get tonnes of reviews on it. </s>
<s> Some people appear to prefer it just because its easy to use and you don't really have to be concerned about it being the &quot;best&quot;. </s>
<s> But then there's a bunch of people who are interested in their latest releases which are just picking up steam. </s>
<s> Take a look either way and you'll find something on there. </s>
