<s> I moved from Europe to the US a couple of months ago, and none of my Wireless network devices was working as well as before. </s>
<s> I blamed the building materials or other equipment in our appartment, but now we moved to a new house and have the same problem. </s>
<s> I have been trying with 5 different routers/AP's, and all have the same problem: If there is a wall between the device and laptop there is hardly any reception, and the connection drops completely or get extremely slow every 15 minutes or so. </s>
<s> If there is nothing between the device and laptop, I still have to limit the distance to 5 ft to get more than 50% signal strength. </s>
<s> In Europe I always got more than 80%, even through concrete and brick. </s>
<s> Here it's only drywall and wood. </s>
<s> The same problem exists when bridging between two Netgear AP's/bridges (so the problem is not the laptops...) Does anyone know if there is anything different in the US that can cause this problem? </s>
<s> Interference from other household appliances, other building materials, or simply being on another part of the earth? </s>
<s> Details: Used routers and AP's: - Netgear WNHDE111 (3 different ones) - TRENDnet TEW-639GR - Zyxel NBG4614 Used laptops: 3 different Dell laptops - running Windows 7 (prof 64 bit; home 64 bit; ultimate 32 bit) all with Intel wireless adapter </s>
<s> Since we KNOW that there is a difference in bands, a router with auto-setting channel would always pick the Euro WiFi channels since here in the USA those channels are often vacant. </s>
<s> If you were unlucky to leave all the gear in a mix and match Euro and USA/NA settings all your troubles could have you pointing fingers at every maker over this. </s>
<s> More at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels Notice how channels 12, 13 and 14 could cause trouble for some? </s>

<s> I have tried more channels than I already did, now guided by your link (thanks), and it is a little better. </s>
<s> Not there yet, but at least the connection is now stable most of the time... </s>
