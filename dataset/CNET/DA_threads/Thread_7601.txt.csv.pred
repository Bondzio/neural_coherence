1.1.1	Some possible questions ; A laptop running on AC power [ XP } gets normal shutdown .	St
1.1.2	It 's modem is connected to a satllite modem .	St
1.1.3	It still has a charged battery in it .	St
1.1.4	I know nothing about laptops , but I know how ATX power works .	St
1.1.5	The question is whether or not the laptop power is like an ATX computer and the Standby power line from the power supply stays on .	St
1.1.6	If it does stay on , then it seems that to protect more surely one should disconnect from the satellite modem .	St
1.1.7	I do n't come back here too often , but I never fail to get the correct answers from these great posters .	St
1.1.8	Thanx Ray Harinec	St
1.2.1	Power surge ?	Ques
1.2.2	Energy drain by modem ?	Ques
1.2.3	How is a laptop intruded when it 's not booted up ?	Ques
1.3.1	Only when the OS is running is there a possibility of compromise .	St
1.3.2	An ATX PS does keep a control voltage on the PC that can be used for wake-on-lan , wake-on-ring devices .	St
1.3.3	So , theoretically , someone could send a wake up signal ( magic packet ) to a network card to wake the laptop if the laptop was hard wired to the network .	St
1.3.4	As well , if the laptop had a telephone type modem that supported wake-on-ring , it could be started remotely .	St
1.3.5	Once the OS was running , the laptop could be hijacked but not beforehand .	St
1.4.1	At some point Norton [ no idea what version ] reported an intrusion attempt .	St
1.4.2	It is not clear to me exactly when the report occurred .	St
1.4.3	I ca n't discuss it directly with the person whose computer had the report , as to what was being done at the time .	St
1.4.4	He apparently has something going on in his life that causes him to suspect that omeone may e trying to hak into his omputer .	St
1.4.5	My real inrest is whether such things as wake on LAN etc can work in a laptop , thus the ATX type power question .	St
1.4.6	Also thus I would advise him to unplug his satellite modem whenever he is not using the computer .	St
1.4.7	I think that Steven Haninger answered me .	St
1.5.1	to see if any & quot ; wake on & quot ; is enabled .	St
1.5.2	If one is , can the wake on turn the computer on boot up , intrude and then return the system to the OFF [ standby power ] mode ?	Ques
1.6.1	Theoretically , yes .	Res
1.6.2	But , the intrusion would need to include a program that would take control of your desktop and allow a shutdown command such as can be done if remote desktop is enabled .	St
1.6.3	Evidence of someone booting and shutting down your system would be found in the event log by noting the times/dates in the system area .	St
1.6.4	You would know by looking there .	St
1.7.1	However I believe that I can arrive at the answer .	St
1.7.2	The question was simply does a laptop have a power system similiar to an ATX tower , thus always a standby voltage ?	Ques
1.7.3	I now realize that it could not have such .	St
1.7.4	It seems that if it did and the battery slowly reuced it 's voltage the standby source would get into a never never region , where digital logic would do many unplanned events flicking back and forth it 's ones and zeros .	St
1.8.1	& quot ; The question was simply does a laptop have a power system similiar to an ATX tower , thus always a standby voltage ? & quot ; I ca n't see how this can be answered with the laptop designs being so varied .	St
1.8.2	I will answer YES on my newest HP dv6910us since you can turn it off and on via a small IR remote control .	St
1.8.3	To do that , some circuit has to be energized .	St
