What do you need to know about my PC?
The monitor has been working fine for the past 2 years.
I did have power loss 3 times the other day maybe that did something to the video card.
I take it I cannot just replace the connector on back of the PC because it's attached to a video card?
As you can see, I'm not real technical but I am willing to learn and like &quot;hands on&quot; learning.
