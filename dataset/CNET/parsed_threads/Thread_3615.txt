<s> Does it matter how much unused space there is on the recovery partition? </s>
<s> I don't see where it would matter but would like a second opinion. </s>
<s> I made the recovery partition on the new hdd about 600Mb smaller of unused space then the orginal. </s>
<s> So now it has 517Mb of unused space vs about 1.2Gb </s>
<s> The whole idea of a recovery partition is to hold the required info needed upon the dreaded later date. </s>
<s> If you're using recovery CDs and/or OS from the OEM vendor, it should automatically make it back to the day it was made at least big name vendors. </s>
<s> Just follow the prompts or guide for a true mirror image of what was on that 1st day. </s>
<s> Also, I'm sure there's a finite space required, so reducing it too small isn't going to help maybe hinder the process. </s>
<s> If this all to just gain more space, is the 600mb worth that much trouble, maybe better to get a larger HD if possible. </s>

<s> I worded that poorly. </s>
<s> I replaced the hdd in an hp pavilion 304w and created a system and recovery partition on the new hdd. </s>
<s> I then cloned the old partitions from the old hdd to the new. </s>
<s> There was about 1.2Gb of unused space left on the recovery partition of the old hdd. </s>
<s> So I couldn't understand why the company left such a large amount of unused wasted space. </s>
<s> On the new hdd I left only 512Mb of unused space on the recovery partition after cloning of the recovery system. </s>
<s> As far as I know the recovery partition isn't wrote to during the recovery process. </s>
<s> It only copies the recovery back to the system partition. </s>
<s> So I wasn't completely sure that the recovery partition isn't written back to during the recovery process. </s>
<s> If it is then maybe I need to make that unused space a little bigger. </s>
