To spec the system by number of CPUs and RAM sounds odd.
Of course I can't know what's driving this requirement but let's compare the old XEONs to the new ones?
The old Xeons would not deliver as many mips as the latest at the same GHz but would meet your spec.
SUN also may deliver you Opterons and not Xeons so without a benchmark it could happen your quad CPU system could be outperformed by a simpler but faster dual core XEON?
I think you should toss this spec back into the pot and cook it more.
