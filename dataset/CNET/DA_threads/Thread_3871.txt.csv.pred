1.1.1	Hi , I currently have a Fujitsu-Siemens Scaleo P , with a motherboard model GA-8I848PM .	St
1.1.2	I have 1 x 512 DDR RAM installed , and am looking to upgrade this .	St
1.1.3	I believe that the RAM i have installed at the moment is PCR 2700 , although I ca n't be sure .	St
1.1.4	I need to know whether I should add another 512 RAM , another 1GB , or take the existing RAM out and replace it with 1GB .	St
1.1.5	I am not sure whether there will be a great difference between these 3 options , and was hoping someone would help me out with making a decision .	St
1.1.6	I know that my computer does not support duel-channel memory .	St
1.1.7	Another website suggested that I buy a stick of RAM PCR 2300 , but I 'm not sure whether this will be different to buying another PCR 2700 as I have no idea what that actually means .	St
1.1.8	Can anyone help out ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	sorry i meant PCR 3200 , not 2300	Polite
1.3.1	it should tell you about adding RAM and whether it 's advantageous to add in pairs or not .	St
1.3.2	Many of today 's systems are built with dual channel memory architecture which means it is advantageous to add in DIMMs in pairs ... 2 @ 512MBs vice 1 @ 1GB .	St
1.3.3	If you download and run CPUZ .. it should tell you what RAM you have in your system and whether it 's one DIMM or two DIMMs .	St
1.3.4	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	Interestingly enough your computer shipped with four different models of motherboards , so the motherboard model sure helped .	St
1.4.2	Before purchasing , please confirm you have two RAM slots and not four , just in case .	Sug
1.4.3	If that is correct , you can install a 1GB stick of RAM if you like , with no need to remove the 512MB , bumping it up to 1.5GB .	St
1.4.4	You could likewise just insert another 512MB stick to reduce the cost , totaling 1GB .	Sug
1.4.5	As to PC3200 vs PC2700 , the higher the number the faster it is , generally speaking .	St
1.4.6	You can safely mix-and-match PC3200 with PC2700 , which results in all RAM running at the slower of the speeds .	St
1.4.7	Ideally you 'd want all PC3200 , but it 's better to have 1.5GB running as PC2700 than 1GB running as PC3200 .	St
1.4.8	Hope this helps , John	St
1.5.1	Yes I have 2 RAM slots , not four .	St
1.5.2	I think I will do as you suggested and add another 1GB to the spare slot .	St
1.5.3	There will be no difference between purchasing PCR 2700 or 3200 ?	Ques
1.5.4	Not even in price ?	Ques
1.6.1	PC2700 runs slower than PC3200 , but since you already have a PC2700 stick it does n't matter which you choose as it would be forced to run at the slower PC2700 speed .	St
1.6.2	As far as price is concerned , that varies .	St
1.6.3	There are frequently sales that make PC3200 cheaper than PC2700 or vice versa , so just shop around for both and snag the best deal .	St
