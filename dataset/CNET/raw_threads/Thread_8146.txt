Setting up the BEFVP41 at least *seemed* easy. Getting a XP client going was another story. Getting to see/ping/use network shares is the #1 problem now. The BEFVP41 only supports IPSec tunnels, which configuring under XP is a ROYAL PAIN, after scanning a number of forums about VPN's I decided on trying a ''VPN Client'' solution instead of using the built in but dreadfully painfull client support in XP. If you search HIGH and LOW about the internet, you may find ''SSHSentinel 1.3.2''. This VPN client is free for non-comercial use. It was easy to setup this client to connect to my BEFVP41. However, once setup it automaticly loads on system startup and reroutes all network traffic to the VPN (existing or not), thereby breaking network connections when you are not using a VPN. (I ended up uninstalling it as I'm %99 NON-VPN and might use VPN %1 of the time.) ''Greenbow_VPN'' is another solution spoken about in many forums. This client was easy to setup to connect to my BEFVP41, however the public license is only for a ''30-60 day trial''. I uninstalled it. After much searching, I came across the ''Draytek'' VPN client. Written by Draytek in China for their brand of VPN routers, this client loads a device driver as part of its client solution. The driver comes up as another ''network connection'' under XP. The NICE part about all this is that the client program/driver will create network configuration changes ''on the fly'' thereby NOT breaking connections when the VPN is not in use. This was also easy to setup to connect to my BEFVP41. When the tunnel is active/connected, the client application will show a little ''green light'' indicator and the connection will not have a RED X ontop of it in the system tray. Pretty cool. So what does all this have to do with ''network shares over a VPN?'' In all cases, while I was able to get the clients to work (connect) with my Linksys VPN router, I was unable to access the VPN Router or any of the network shares attached to it. I finally decided that my routing tables must not be setup correctly to route to&lt;=&gt;from my LAN addresses through the VPN tunnel. 1. Client Address &lt;=&gt; Server Address 65.mylaptop &lt;=&gt; 66.mylan 2. Client Secure Group &lt;=&gt; Server Secure group 192.168.2.0 &lt;=&gt; 192.168.2.0 This dident work. I read somewhere that the LAN segments on both ends needed to be different. 3. Client Secure Group &lt;=&gt; Server Secure group 192.168.4.0 &lt;=&gt; 192.168.2.0 This dident work ether. After much reading, I'm under the (miss)understanding that: A. The tunnel needs to have a different IP address scheme then ether of the LAN segments on ether end. B. The tunnel needs to have a different IP address scheme then the FQDN of ether end. C. I have to manually setup ROUTE's on each end to direct traffic through the tunnel. Client Address &lt;=&gt; Server Address 65.mylaptop &lt;=&gt; 66.mylan ClientSecureGroup (addr) &lt;=&gt; ServerSecuregroup (addr) 10.0.2.1 &lt;=&gt; 10.0.1.1 Client LAN Segment &lt;=&gt; Server LAN Segment 192.168.4.0 &lt;=&gt; 192.168.2.0 Client Side: Route add 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.1.1 &lt;serverend&gt; Route add 10.0.1.1 255.255.255.0 10.0.2.1 &lt;clientend&gt; Server Side (in VPN Router): Route add 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2 &lt;clientend&gt; Route add 10.0.2.1 255.255.255.0 10.0.1.1 &lt;serverend&gt; I'll let you all know if this works. In the mean time I'm sure that the readers of this forum will show me the errors of my ways.... &lt;g&gt; mark.

The free edition is great. When using a BEFVP41 and VPN, I opted to use a software VPN on a server in the other LAN to get to network shares. Also, using two BEFVP41s to connect the two LANs together all of the time works well. Good luck. Jeff

Not what I was looking for at all or any HELP at all. (did not see any &quot;free &quot; options other than &quot;free trial&quot;=Not FREE.) I have a number of FREE VPN clients already and have a VPN router that I paid good $$ for. I'm connecting via: LAPTOP=&gt;CellPhone=&gt;Internet=&gt;BEFVP41=&gt;LAN
