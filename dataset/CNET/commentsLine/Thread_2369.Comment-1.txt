dell 8400 200gb (with raid) windows xp 2003 media center edition lacie 200gb hard drive (external) i have over 15,000 songs, mostly rare .wav files of unavailable 1940's and 1950's out-of-print r&b records stored on an external hard drive.
these have been acquired over many years.
long story made short, yesterday, my computer re-assigned the hard drive from &quot;l&quot; to &quot;m&quot;, as the drive was turned off and i connected a usb cable for my daughters new mp3 player to a port on the computer.
the computer assigned the mp3 player to drive l, and my external hard drive is now drive m. this is an issue because my musicmatch (i refuse to switch to yahoo or i-tunes) can no longer find the songs.
how do i re-assign my external drive back to l?
thanking the experts in advance, -jack
