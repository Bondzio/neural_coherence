<s> My monitor shows grey horizontal lines on the screen. </s>
<s> I connected two other monitors to my computer to verify that the problem is not with any one monitor, but the lines seem to not go away. </s>
<s> This makes me suspect that there's a problem with the computer or hard disk itself. </s>
<s> After my &quot;experiment&quot; with different monitors, my hard disk crashed and I had to replace it with a new one. </s>
<s> The grey lines are still present on the screen even with the new hard disk. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what the problem might be? </s>
<s> Thanks much, </s>
<s> Many load windows but forget that the drivers are rarely supplied. </s>
<s> We have to do that ourselves. </s>
<s> If not the drivers then the video card maybe going bad. </s>

<s> Might as well go shopping... ^_^ </s>
