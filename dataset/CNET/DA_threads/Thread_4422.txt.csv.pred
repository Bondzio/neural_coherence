1.1.2	The printer can print other docs that are colored w/o a problem .	St
1.1.3	I am assuming that some property of the document itself has been configured to print in greyscale , but I was n't able to find any such option .	St
1.2.1	Normally , it 's a setting on the print dialog window .	St
1.2.2	That 's stored in the document , but easy to change for a new print job .	St
1.2.3	If not , try copy all/paste to a new document ( based on the same template ) .	Sug
1.2.4	Kees	St
1.3.1	printer dialaog properties and copying/pasting .	St
1.3.2	Still all in black and white .	St
