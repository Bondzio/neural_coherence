the 8800gts upgrade would be good, but you'll wind up being cpu bound in some games and games releasing this year (like crysis and half-life 2 epsiode 2) will support dual-core.
so you might want to consider getting an x2 4600+ for $210 now since cpus for socket 939 are drying up.
the dual core cpu + the 8800gts + an additional 1gb of ram will extend the gaming life of your system for at least another year.
