i was brought a computer, that didn't want to start (it turned out to be too much dust on the vga card and it wasn't working.
after i run the pc there came up a problem with the hdd &quot;replace the damaged hard drive&quot; etc.
after i replaced it, cleaned the whole pc (it's some old p3) and ran it there was a &quot;hardware error, enter power setup menu for details&quot;.
here's what i find in the power setup menu: vcore voltage 1.72v +3.3v voltage 3.72v (it is in red) +5v voltage 4.99v +12v voltage 12.28v -12v voltage -11.50v -5v voltage [ignore] so i guess that the problem is the one, colored in red.
i don't understand much, but i think the one in the left is what it should be, and the one in the right is what it is atm.
can this damage something, or it is too little to worry?
