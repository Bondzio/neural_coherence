I opened the side panel & unscrewed the screw. On the other side I can't access the screw coz there's this metal plate that covers the entire side. The motherboard and everthing is attached to it. How do I get the HDD out of that machine?

You will have to input the model of your Pavilion. Hope the info that you need is still there. Ken

I actually did the same thing the other day. 1) Remove the Power supply 2) Unscrew the back screws and the side ones going into the metal panel. 3) Flip back the system board and then the side panel should be exposed. I had to install a CD-burner the other day in one of these machines. Good Luck.. Ray.
