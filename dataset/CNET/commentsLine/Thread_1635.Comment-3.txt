please change the file permissons for it.
step 1: set permissions ========================== 1) click start, point to programs, point to accessories, and then click windows explorer.
2) locate the file or folder for which you want to set permissions.
3) right-click the file or folder, click properties, and then click the security tab.
4) click the name of the group or user.
5) in permissions, click allow for each permission you want to allow.
further you may also give it read-only rights, so that no one else deletes it.
step 1: rread-only ========================== 1) click start, point to programs, point to accessories, and then click windows explorer.
2) locate the file or folder for which you want to remove read-only.
3) right-click the file or folder, click properties, and then click the general tab.
4) ccheck the options &quot;read-only&quot; now you have stored the files, but we should always maintain a back-up of all our important files.
to maintain backup, i would suggest you to write the contents to a cd.
cds are more durable than dvds.
however dvds hold much more data.
