thanks.
i had searched but not found the answer to my specific question.
my needs are low and they'll stay low - i'm not a user who'll be wanting to install fancy graphics cards or high-power items.
pretty much the basics will be installed and that'll be it.
as long as having more &quot;just in case&quot; isn't going to result in wasted power, i may end up getting a higher wattage unit, but i didn't want to get it if all i was doing was getting a power hog for probably no benefit.
