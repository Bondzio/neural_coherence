<s> Can any point me in the direction of a computer reseller that allows you to &quot;build it yourself&quot; offering the new intel chip q9550? </s>
<s> Intel directed me to their resellers, however, these people were &quot;distributors&quot; and not pos computer providers. </s>
<s> The distributors needed you to become one of their &quot;resellers&quot; to get any information. </s>
<s> I don't want to resell computer parts, I just want to have one built to my specifications. </s>
<s> This new chip is suppose to utilize intel's new .TXT technology. </s>
<s> I plan on using new desktop for rending graphics, CAD, texture creation and manipulation, animation graphics creation. </s>
<s> This new technology needs a special motherboard as well (one recommended was DX35BT). </s>
<s> They are referred to Extreme Technology. </s>
<s> Any help providing me with an online &quot;build it yourself&quot; computer company that provides this technology would be appreciated. </s>
<s> If I have to build it myself, I still need a supplier for &quot;one&quot; cpu. </s>
<s> Many thanks for your time. </s>
<s> (Would like to run on xp if possible) I also posted to COMPUTER HELP </s>
<s> If not today, tommorrow... </s>
<s> Goto: http://www.tomshardware.com and use their links for cpu sources. </s>
<s> Provided you can wait, newly released cpus tend to be expensive. </s>
<s> Plus, more vendors will provide them thus competition forces pricing into more sensible levels. </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>
<s> look for a motherboard with the socket that matches the release </s>
<s> none I checked actually had the product to sell you. </s>
<s> Most indicated 'Out of Stock', 'Will Arrive Soon' or 'Taking Preorders'. </s>
<s> My advice ... let the product(s) get to the stores, read the tech reviews, read buyer reviews and then decide which components are right for your system. </s>
<s> I often use Newegg.com for peripherals and they're a great source for product selection, product description, buyer reviews, competitive prices, reasonable shipping and good customer service. </s>
<s> The link below is a great example of a new, high-priced CPU from Intel and it appears there are some peripherals to avoid. </s>
