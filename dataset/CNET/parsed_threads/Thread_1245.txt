<s> I'm getting a IDE cable to cut down on dust and I need to know if IDE cables are also compatible with dvd/cd drives. </s>
<s> Did you plan on getting round cables? </s>
<s> If so, they work just fine with CD/DVD drives. </s>
<s> I don't know about cutting down on dust but I suppose it makes sense as they reduce clutter. </s>
<s> Also a big help for cooling as they permit better airflow. </s>
<s> thanx alot </s>
<s> You're welcome. </s>

<s> the IDE drive, be certain to not get one that is too long. </s>
<s> It can cause problems because some of the round ones have more cross talk and noise than the flat 80 conductor cables. </s>
<s> The flat ones also should not be any longer than necessary. </s>
<s> This does not apply to the ATAPI [optical/DVD et al] drives because their data rate is substantially lower. </s>
