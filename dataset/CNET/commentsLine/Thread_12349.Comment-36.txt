well, in the first place, who made you english/grammar moderator, er, king.
maybe you should have a big red km after your name, for king moderator.
39 posts in this thread when i logged in, 9 of them king williams', and 8 of those totally unrelated to the subject discussed.
maybe the reason i don't visit cnet forums more often!
is my spacing proper; no, never mind, what do i care what a jr. high english teacher thinks.
