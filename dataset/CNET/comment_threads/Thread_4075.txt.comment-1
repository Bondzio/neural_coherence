picked up a new motherboard 4 20$ yay for me lol.
I wanted it because it works, was cheap, but mainly because it can hold up to 4GB of RAM.
I'm not a pro at this but I love my games.
The only problem is that it has 5 PCI slot 1 AGU and No PCI-E slots.
Can any one name a few of the best card I can fit in a PCI slot?
And or AGU.
PS.
Under 200$ would help this poor boy
