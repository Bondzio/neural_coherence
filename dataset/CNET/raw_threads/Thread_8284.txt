And now i can't turn my computer on. The on/off button flashes orange when power is going to the computer and when i touch it, nothing happens. I know power is getting to the motherboard, so i think the power supply is fine. Thanks

I hope this didnt happen to you. They werent interchangeable with industry standard stuff.

At least I hope so for the sake of this gentleman. He has to check with Dell. The reverse could also have happened if he bought a supply for an older Dell model, that is not wired to the ATX standard. A standard ATX connected to the older Dell's definitely zapped the mobo.
