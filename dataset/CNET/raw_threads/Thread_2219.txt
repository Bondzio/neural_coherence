Now I know that 32-bit OS's will not recognize more than 4 Gigs, so I will install Vista 64-bit. My mobo and Processor will be: EVGA 122-CK-NF68-T1 and Intel Core 2 extreme QX6800. Note that I've done extensive research on the mobo and could not find anything relevant to this issue. The mobo's spec does not mention it supporting (or not supporting) a 64-bit architecture or Intel's EM64T technology. Does this mean that I cannot have 8 gigs of RAM on this Mobo even with Vista 64-bit ? So my question is: WHAT ARE ALL THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR A 64-BIT SYSTEM THAT HAS 8 GIGS OF RAM ? Thanks in advance
