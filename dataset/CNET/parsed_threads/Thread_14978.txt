<s> I have just purchased a Crossover Cable from eBay and I was wondering if that was the right choice. </s>
<s> I do not know the difference between crossover, and patch and all that. </s>
<s> Could someone explain this to me please. </s>
<s> I want to connect my computer or 360 to a router. </s>
<s> I also might use this to connect my modem to my router, and so on. </s>
<s> Will I be able to use a crossover cable in everyday networking? </s>
<s> A crossover cable is for connecting like devices such as computer to computer. </s>
<s> A standard/patch cable is for connecting non-like devices such as a computer to a router, modem to router, or computer to modem. </s>
<s> &quot;Will I be able to use a crossover cable in everyday networking?&quot; Nope. </s>
<s> That really sucks. </s>
<s> What is so different though? </s>

<s> I was a jack*** for not doing my research and I am afraid the eBay seller is not going to refund my money....I have been reading that there is a way to connect a hub to a router/modem to router, but i want to know for sure how to do it with this crossover cable. </s>
<s> Also if anyone knows any way to connect like computer/360/PS2 to hub/router using crossover cable please comment. </s>
<s> PLEASE I am desperate!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> you or your friends don't know how to cut off one end of the crossover cable and make a crimp to match the other end, just buy a straight through cable. </s>
<s> They can be purchased from Internet retailers for around $3.00 </s>
