<s> This is my situation: I am trying to set up a small wireless ISP service here in tropical West Africa. </s>
<s> I already have a VSAT connection to the Internet that I use for my Internet Cafe. </s>
<s> I am trying to extend my wireless service to some homes in the immediate vicinity (1 mile radius). </s>
<s> I have installed a 15dbi omni antenna at the top of our buliding connetected to a DLINK (Dl-614+) wireless router. </s>
<s> I also have an amplifier connected to it. </s>
<s> Length of cable (between omni and AP) is 98 ft. What is ideal for the end-user computer to receive good signal? </s>
<s> Driving around with my wireless enabled laptop, I can see my wireless network, and can connect to it but within a very short distance of the building. </s>
<s> I have tried connecting from within a prospective subscriber's living room just 1/3 of a mile away and could not see the AP. </s>
<s> Do subscribers need special equipments to connect? </s>
<s> How come I cannot connect with a regular wireless card or USB wireless adapter? </s>
<s> You could use multiple wifi routers or more correctly WAPS and use a directional antenna for north, south or north, south, east and west while setting each WAP to a different channel. </s>
<s> As you move out, you have to populate your system with RANGE EXPANDERS. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>

<s> I do not have the budget for your suggestions - WAPS and repeaters. </s>
<s> My intended coverage area is actually less than half a mile. </s>
<s> Is there any other solution for my current setup? </s>
<s> Are there external Wi-Fi antennas that would work for my subcribers to receive signals from the AP? </s>
<s> And the user may have to do same. </s>
<s> Here's the cheap addon for the user's end. </s>
<s> Look over http://www.freeantennas.com/projects/template/ which is probably the best trick in the book without having to heat up any solder iron. </s>
<s> You can help out the user's end this way. </s>
<s> If you are looking for magic, there is none here. </s>
