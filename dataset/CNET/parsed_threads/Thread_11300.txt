<s> Just reformatted and reinstalled XP home. </s>
<s> Problems in original install of XP probably caused by wrong drivers for hardware. </s>
<s> Doing GOOGLE for CanoScan drivers for XP home, find there are at least 3 versions of &quot;LATEST&quot; drivers for CanoScan FB630U. </s>
<s> Hoping to avoid messing up XP again, how can I determine which of the 3 drivers I found would work best on XP home? </s>
<s> Thanks Ben </s>
<s> &quot;Hoping to avoid messing up XP again, how can I determine which of the 3 drivers I found would work best on XP home?&quot; I would get such drivers from the Canon web site. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob, Went to &quot;Canon&quot;, found drivers right away. </s>
<s> About a month ago, typed in &quot;CanoScan drivers&quot; on Google and was unable to find right drivers. </s>
<s> Got it now, and scanner works, thanks a lot. </s>
<s> Ben BTW Bob, appreciate all the help you gave when I was having XP problems. </s>
<s> Fortunately the reformat and reinstall of XP was flawless. </s>
<s> (it didn't even ask to put previous Win disk) Had XP up and running in 55 minutes. </s>
<s> The hard part is getting other stuff back, scanner was last item to redo. </s>
<s> Not been in any big rush. </s>
<s> Many driver sites are OK, but only if you can't find a working driver from a device's maker. </s>
<s> Best of continued success. </s>
