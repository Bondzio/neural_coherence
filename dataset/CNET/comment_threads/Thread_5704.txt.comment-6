I've tried different modes (Auto 108, 108 only, standard G (54Mbps)), various encryption options on and off, and it makes no difference.
There must be thousands of people with Netgear routers on the same ISP as me.
I'm going to try my router and card on a friend's PC who has the same ISP as me and see if it works there.
If it does, I'll have to try and get a new cable modem from my ISP... =o)
