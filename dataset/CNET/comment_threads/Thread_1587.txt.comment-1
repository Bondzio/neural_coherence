I have 6 computers wired to a Hub that is connected to my cable modem.
I assume the Cable company acts as the router since my IPs are aquired automatically.
To add Wireless can I add an Access Point by plugging in the cable going to my computer to one of the hub sockets on the AP and my computer to another hub socket in the AP?
Also has anyone found a site that talks about WiFi in a house with all Cinder-Block walls.
Don't want to get the wrong WiFi gear.
Can't exchange it here in Costa Rica.
