<s> I set my screen resolution at a setting that my monitor couldn't display. </s>
<s> Now I get a black screen every time I try and turn on my computer. </s>
<s> I don't get the usual boot up screen either. </s>
<s> I can boot up when I connect to the motherboard, but not when I use my graphics card. </s>
<s> Is there any way to fix this without connecting to a monitor which can handle the set screen resolution? </s>
