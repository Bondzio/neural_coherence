4479	17	236460	2737042	2736272	strat100	3/24/08 3:04 pm	1.20637104e12	i see know	i see what you are saying now. emachines is really a racket. i will never buy another thats for sure. they are the worst company i have ever dealt with. what cheap crap they sell. anyway, there is no way i am going to pay them $160.00 for a motherboard and then still have to jump through hoops to get it all to work. my plan at this point is to scrap everything but the case, hard drive, and media reader. i think i will find a deal on a motherboard/cpu bundle, power supply, and a new liscensed xp. i don't know what other choice i really have right now. i undestand the tower case is pretty generic and should fit most components. is this your understanding as well? thanks, strat100
