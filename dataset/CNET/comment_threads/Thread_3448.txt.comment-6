I have yet to see you write what hardware you suspect.
This sounds more like a software issue such as needing to run the Disk Checkup on the properties page of the drive.
If you do want me to comment on hardware be sure to respond with at least what's asked when you post.
I'll copy it here since you may not be seeing it.
Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem.
Also please exercise your best judgment when posting in the forums--revealing personal information such as your e-mail address, telephone number, and address is not recommended.
