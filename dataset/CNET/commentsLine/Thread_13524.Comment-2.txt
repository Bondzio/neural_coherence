actually i think it was 24, but the pain over the units left a searing scorch mark in my mental bookmarks about sony service.
within the first week, half the machines were crashing daily.
after a month, all of them.
i wish we had just packed them up and asked for a full refund, but we thought sony would do right since ... it was 24 machines... a year later and after hundreds of shipments a person at the sony repair center slipped up and told us the problem.
it seems that the machines were not made to run for 8 hour straight.
sony expected people to use the machine for a few hours and then turn it off... armed with this clue we slowly fielded the units again to desktops which had people that could turn off the machine during lunch and that let us get some usage on the machines.
since sony doesn't deal with such issues after the sale, i do what little i can to share my story and help others avoid their machines.
oh, yes, there are a few that love that make, but in most cases they didn't have to find out how shallow the service centers are.
thanks for reading, bob
