So my laptop has been acting pretty weird.
Not just one, but ALL four of my USB ports wont accept any device that uses a USB port cable.
Not a mouse, printer , iPhone cord, nothing works.
I used to get messages that say &quot;USB Malfunction&quot; but I never actually looked into it when I most likely should have.
My laptop doesn't even make the alert sound when I plug in a USB device.
Any advice or tips of what I should do PLEASE HELP.
Feedback is much appreciated.
