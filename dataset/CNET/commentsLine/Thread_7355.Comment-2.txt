to change the icon to something other than an hour glass.
even the latest and greatest pc will show that if the internet is downloading something.
but back to reality.
i bet you meant 2 gb (gigabyte) ram.
that's nice for vista.
don't get more than that on 32-bit os based machines.
as to the video, i'm going to peg it at 256 mb for desktops.
-&gt; the really big item to look for is a dual core cpu.
hope this helps.
