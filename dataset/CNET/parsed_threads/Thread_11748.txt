<s> I love vista, its robust and is visually stunning. </s>
<s> It has the visual feeling and responsiveness of Mac OS 10 yet with the robust performance of windows, infact i really think microsoft has copied alot of the graphic design for vista and office 2007 from the mac operating system. </s>
<s> However there are some major problems u should consider b4 installing Vista: Firslty i recommend you use the dual boot system so u can boot back to XP to uninstall or change programs that don't work in in vista - and alot of programs don't work well on vista. </s>
<s> Expect up to 3 hrs for install of vista, better to clean install rather than upgrade. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Install it on a large hard drive - it requires 15G just for the op system, and don't use paritions - 6. </s>
<s> Vista freaks out with stupid warning promtps when you copy and paste between partitions - so don't use them 2. </s>
<s> Have at least 1 G of ram 3. </s>
<s> Uninstall all Norton symantec products esp norton internet security before installing upgrade of vista. </s>
<s> It completely srews vista up and is hard to unistall from vista,esp the firewall - I use trend micro pccillin 2007 for vista 4. </s>
<s> DISABLE USER ACCOUNTS CONTROL - this feature is stupid and so annoying in vista - its meant to stop uncontrolled use of programs from hacker and adware but i mean most good firewalls stop this anyways. </s>
<s> These terrible prompts that come up all the time when u run programs - disable this 5. </s>
<s> Cute FTP and WSFTp don't work on vista yet! </s>

<s> However what I found was the owner was flumoxed by firewall or other settings. </s>
<s> Here's a thought. </s>
<s> Ask in Cnet's Vista forum. </s>

<s> I'm sorry, but I just had to say this: 1. </s>
<s> Yes, it is a good idea to dual boot. </s>
<s> I didnt, and I dont regret it. </s>
<s> That being said, I have only seen about 4 programs that will not install on Vista as of yet. </s>
<s> Obviously, I dont use every program ever made, so there will be lots more. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> It did not take me 3 hours to install, it took me less than 1 hour. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> True, Symantec products cause some grief in vista. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> User Accounts Control should not be disabled. </s>
<s> Relying completely on a firewall or antivirus software is just asking for an infection. </s>
<s> I'm not trying to flame, but I cannot stand people making suggestions without doing research. </s>
<s> It will be 2010 before Vista is anywhere near functional. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Did you say the &quot;visual feeling and responsiveness&quot; of MacOS [I agree with you on that one] and the *reliability* of Windows&quot;? </s>
<s> Yeesh! </s>
<s> I remember memory leak testing an application once, and being told that the leak wasn't significant enough to fix. </s>
<s> I asked my boss why he thought it was worth fixing, and he replied: &quot;Which platform are we designing this for?&quot;. </s>
<s> &quot;32-bit Windows&quot; I replied. </s>
<s> He then did a quick multiplication of the amount of memory that was leaking per day by the average number of days between blue-screens on our NT test rigs and said: &quot;Well, a hard reboot should release a few megs back onto the heap before that becomes a problem, shouldn't it?&quot; </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> ...copy. </s>
<s> Micro$oft copied Mac OS X. I have yet to see when they come up with something of their own. </s>
<s> BTW, the original GUI was also copied from the Mac. </s>
<s> That's all history. </s>
<s> Now tell us what you use. </s>
<s> Be honest. </s>
