oem based pcs just don't do well when they're pushed even with the right parts.
which is why many aren't user friendly and generally lack user inputted config changes.
a more user friendly mtrbd.
would provide a wider latitude to make subtle changes or tweaks.
since, everything seems to appear right, then i suspect some minor area is being overlooked or can't be changed to accommodate the new cpu.
plus, any new changes any gaming may need or reset to acknowledge the new cpu.
some games don't or they too need to be updated or &quot;patched&quot; so they can sync to the specs provided.
you may have a catch-22 situation that you need to do this or that but really it may not allow it or not a great a change as required.
the ssd may come into play if it used to cache anything, as it needs to r/w or flush it out on a constant basis.
you should check if any tweaks on it are possible or further suitable s/w the maker provides.
if you brought a bargain ssd, they don't handle constant i/os demands as well.
google for the trim command set.
sorry, i can't provide a more direct answer.
what the other poster suggested makes sense, review the &quot;event log&quot;.
you may want to recheck you pc &quot;windoze experience index&quot; rating, run it and find the weak link.
the low scorer is a good area to check or improve upon.
