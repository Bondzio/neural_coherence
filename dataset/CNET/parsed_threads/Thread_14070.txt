<s> I have a large home with very thick walls. </s>
<s> Is it worth paying extra to buy a business grade WAP such as the Cisco Aironet 1041n over a consumer grade router such as the E4200? </s>
<s> Any thoughts or suggestions on other routers? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> It will more than likely make no difference. </s>
<s> Almost all routers transmit at the legal maximum power. </s>
<s> They all transmit and receive the data in exactly the same format. </s>
<s> Business equipment generally has features that would not be used by home users. </s>
<s> Things like multiple SSID and vlan support and radius support etc. </s>
<s> One feature related to power is the ability to dynamically REDUCE the power to allow load sharing of users between groups of AP. </s>
<s> The best solution to a house with thick wall is to use directional antenna. </s>
<s> You concentrate the power in the direction of the walls. </s>
<s> It is a trade off, you will then get less signal in other directions. </s>
<s> Generally the best solutions to coverage issues is to run multiple routers. </s>
<s> WAPs and WIFI ROUTERS (which I can configure to be a WAP!) </s>
<s> are already at the max power allowed. </s>
<s> I can only guess no one has shared this and the seller is more than willing to sell you anything without telling you this. </s>
<s> Why are the other solutions such as WIFI ROUTERS configured as WAPs and AC power line networking not an option? </s>
