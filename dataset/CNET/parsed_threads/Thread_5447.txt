<s> I have a very good question that needs answering.. Can I use my 'WD MyBook 500GB' or any OTHER external hardrive to listen to music/view media on a regular basis? </s>
<s> In other words, can I use my external hardrive just like any other hardrive? </s>
<s> The reason for this type of question is that I feel a little uneasy about seeing how hard my hardrive has to work.. or how it heats up after long periods of time. </s>
<s> It's enough to get anyone a little concerned. </s>
<s> I have (personally, not including office units) one unit that does not have a fan, the other does. </s>
<s> Given the variety of designs out there I give a nod to fan equipped cases. </s>

<s> I'm thinking an external hardrive is meant for back-up only and then you're finished, then you unplug it.. end of story. </s>
<s> But, I'm an avid collector of music and I listen to it on a regular basis. </s>
<s> So, that means I'm constantly making WD's MyBook work hard.. by making it's insides churn, and heat up. </s>
<s> My other WD hardrive (160GB, not a MyBook) never really got hot or made a lot of noise. </s>
<s> To be honest, my other hardrive was much faster and probably performed better overall! </s>
<s> I've heard it's because the MyBook writes/reads slow.. could this be the case? </s>
<s> It came with a FAT32 filesystem and I decided to change it to NTFS because I've heard it's safer too. </s>
<s> So far, I noticed very little speed boost. </s>
<s> Anyway, with all these reviews and comments about data failing on external hardrives (USB/firewire).. </s>
<s> I guess I have to be careful with mine? </s>
<s> lol, and also my dad has a Lacie external hardrive.. </s>
<s> I don't think it has a cooling system (fancy fan) either. </s>
<s> But, I've read reviews about it overheating. </s>
<s> In this case, I have personally used it for long periods of time and felt it to be very hot afterwards. </s>
<s> If you're caring around a lot of data.. even that is at risk. </s>
<s> Backing up a back-up drive seems a bit funny, but I'm beginning to believe it really IS necessary. </s>
<s> You never know what's going to happen! </s>
<s> Find the WRITE PROTECT switch. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> WD's MyBook can also come equipped with software that with the touch of a button, backs up all of your computer's files; the Premium Edition to be exact. </s>
<s> The button is a backup button but no switch to stop a virus or human from wiping out the drive accidently. </s>
<s> These fail the basic test of a backup. </s>
<s> The next test is having the second and third copies. </s>
<s> I found only one person to have more than one backup. </s>
<s> BOb </s>
<s> If you mean if there's a lock switch where no data can be written on the hardrive.. then yes, there is one! </s>
<s> About time someone get the formula right. </s>
<s> Now to tackle that multiple copy item. </s>
<s> With just one device/media the pests can infect it and you can't go back. </s>
<s> Also it can't be left off site in case of fire, theft. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ..by that I mean, can I push it to the limits and use it as much as I like to? </s>
<s> I'd just like to clarify what I was saying in my first question. </s>
<s> Mine work just super. </s>
<s> Curious. </s>
<s> It's rare to find a good fanless so I agree you want cases with fans. </s>
<s> The other is some no-name from newegg or geeks.com Bob </s>
