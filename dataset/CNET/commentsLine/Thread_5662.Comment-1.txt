i have an amd athlon 3200+ processor with a soyo mobo.
i was playing with the bios settings and put the cpu fps speed at 200mhz from 166 mhz and the cpu ratio at 11. now my monitor doesn't display anything.
has my graphics card died?
(i have a geforce 5500)has my ram run into problems?
did my processor die?
is it a bios problem??
?what can i do to fix it??????
pre-overclock my cpu was running at a max of 56 c/132 f. thanks for any help you may have; i've really done it this time.
