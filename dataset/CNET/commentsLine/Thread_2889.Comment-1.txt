i just purchased an rca small wonder video cam, and while i love the cam..easy to use, etc...i have a prob.
when i play back the video i take, on the camera, it looks and sounds fine.
when i use the preinstalled software, and play it back, it plays at a really fast rate, and thus makes it sound like &quot;alvin and the chipmunks&quot; recorded it.
i even tried to upload the video to my computer without the built in software, and then play it in windows media player.
same result.
i'm assuming it's a codec problem.
i tried everything i could think of removed my klite codec pack...and thus the ffdshow.
ran a prog called codec sniper, and all is well there.
i just don't know what else to do (except to return the camera).
i did get my kodak digital camera out, put it in video mode, and then played that back .....that played ok. any ideas before i return the thing....i really wanted this camera.
or should i return it and try a flipvideo cam?
i liked the small wonder, due to the sd expansion slot.
would love any and all feedback.
thanks
