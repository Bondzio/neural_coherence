1.1.1	i 've had a sony dru-530A for about 9 months now and i just updated the firmware to allow me to burn dvd-r 's from 4x to 8x ... . and so i bought some dvd-r 's at 8x .	St
1.1.2	Now when the cd 's burn , they burn with a visible line in the middle from the edge of the disk to the center .	St
1.1.3	The section that is closer to the disk 's center , is much more prominant and looks like it has a much thicker burn .	St
1.1.4	The other section looks weak , almost as if it barely burned that section .	St
1.1.5	So then i went out and bought some other dvd 's .	St
1.1.6	Same thing .	St
1.1.7	Now since i did the firmware update , ( which im guessing is the problem ) can i uninstall it ?	Ques
1.1.8	Eric	St
1.2.1	Not that a retrograde would fix your problem but to do so would require the ROM file from the previous firmware version and the utility to write it .	St
1.2.2	It 's not done by uninstalling like other software .	St
