As unwanted as the solution is, heres what i found.
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/11/10/linksys_wrt54g_802_11g_access/ &quot;It seems to be that the box can't handle the GRE protocol 47 correctly.
Linksys seems to think that this is a port that needs to be opened, rather than a protocol.
Consequently, the initial link is made through port 1723, and the VPN server can't then create the necessary link for the tunnel.&quot; *sigh* time to get a new access point
