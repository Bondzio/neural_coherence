My D drive is a Pioneer DVR-1910LS. It has operated well until today when it refused to write to either CD or DVD. My system refers to the drive as a DVD-ROM. Software on my system insists that I have no burner attached. Rebooting and restarting did not help. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the drive without effect. Curiously, the Lightscribe burner works well.

This means there was some added software to add this feature. No name given or title but what to try next is uninstall then reinstall that software title. I read where you uninstalled and reinstalled the drive. That's not software so I don't expect that to work. The SOFTWARE is what I'd be working on. Bob
