Of course the power supply is bad and it is impossible to find one any place that I have looked. I even wrote the manufacter, Delta electronics. No Response!! What I would like to know is, has anyone adapted a standard good quality more powerful run of the mill ATX power supply to the Sony. I was considering trying it and just wanted to know if I'm getting in over my head. any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Bill
