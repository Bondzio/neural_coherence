1.1.1	Currently , PCs put the monitor in power save mode , but the monitor is still consuming some power .	St
1.1.2	In an enterprise , a single building may have hundreds or thousands of PCs .	St
1.1.3	More money would be saved if the monitor is completely shut down .	St
1.1.4	The savings is beyond the power consumed by the Monitor .	St
1.1.5	Any electronic device creates heat .	St
1.1.6	This heat has to be pumped out later when the air conditioning is turned back on .	St
1.1.7	THis also costs money , and is a comnplete waste .	St
1.1.8	A slow drip in a tub will fill the tub .	St
1.1.9	Savings can be done by building the PC with a plug in the back to power the Monitor .	St
1.1.10	If the PC is inactive for a configuarable time limit ( different than the screen saver limit ) , then the PC will shut power off to the monitor .	St
1.1.11	THis will all be moot when we all switch to laptops , but in the meantime ...	St
1.2.1	monitors got their power from the PC 's power supply .	St
1.2.2	that 's why old PC 's had that weird plug .	St
1.2.3	but the amount of power drawn by a sleeping LCD monitor is trivial ... most are less than 1 watt .	St
1.2.4	someone microwaving popcorn will offset the 'savings ' .	St
1.2.5	likewise , LCDs give off practically no heat when asleep .	St
1.2.6	and that excess heat from your pc can actually reduce your heating bills in the winter .	St
1.3.1	works for me , every time Power consumption for computers is a big deal .	St
1.3.2	For example , a couple of the big names ( yahoo , MSoft ) located new centers near my in-law 's home , specifically because the county has among the lowest electrical costs in the US -- the electrical costs are a significant portion of their expense .	St
1.3.3	Another e.g. , a single & quot ; super computer & quot ; will use as much electricity as a medium-large town .	St
1.3.4	It 's expensive in monetary terms , let alone if you consider the environmental effects .	St
1.3.5	It seems to me the industry has been rather slow to wake up and care - there 's just little/no emphasis or interest in consumer markets .	St
1.3.6	Awareness is the first step .	St
1.4.1	I went to the extreme here and ordered up a P3 power meter .	St
1.4.2	My home entertainment system was drawing 65 Watts when off .	St
1.4.3	It 's now at less than half that but my point is that we need to know where the drain is in order to do more about it .	St
1.4.4	One of my recent savings was not my choice .	St
1.4.5	Our fridge died and the new one is some 70 bucks a year estimated .	St
1.4.6	I seem to remember the old one was closer to 300 or more .	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	The practical & quot ; green advice & quot ; for frigs in general if over 5yrs .	St
1.5.2	old , pitch it or donate .	St
1.5.3	Do n't move it to the garage for liquids coolers but actually get rid of it .	St
1.5.4	-OR- at least use the newest frigs you got to do the same .	St
1.5.5	The energy saving matters over time but may not for short usage , like in a summer cabin/cottage but again if you 're really out there any saving is worth it .	St
1.5.6	I wonder what they say about those old GMC ( Frigitaire ) models that ran for 30yrs.+ ?	Ques
1.5.7	At my house meter it barely turns , my consumption is as low as it goes .	St
1.5.8	But , I 'm sure the frig is the biggest power user after the electrical water heater .	St
