hi mike, am baffled by your lack of screw hole, that is very odd.
anyway, re: cable select etc., you should have 2 ide connectors on your motherboard-- numbered (and you should see this on the board itself) 1 and 2. your cable (use the 80 pin!)
has 3 plugs.
the blue one that is mid-way on the cable is for the slave drive.
note, whichever end of the cable is furthest away from that middle connector goes to the motherboard.
the drive at the other end of the cable plugged into the ide #1 slot is for your primary master.
(again, the the drive that uses the connector in the middle of the cable is the primary slave.)
drives plugged into cable going to ide 2 are the secondary master and secondary slave.
you'll see the drives being recognized with those names during the bios post.
note the system usually hunts thru the drives in that order until it finds a disk it can boot from.
another hint, if you have 2 drives, put the second drive and the cd rom on the secondary connector, leave the primary master all to itself on its own cable, may speed things up a little.
clear as mud?
