1.1.1	Hey .	St
1.1.2	I have a problem with my computer .	St
1.1.3	After upgrading a few things , I 'm having trouble with a newish IBM hard drive and a new Samsung DVD+/-RW drive .	St
1.1.4	It seems that if I have both connected up to my motherboard , the hard drive gets misreported , causing , among other things , the computer to think it needs reformated to only have 3GB on it , whereas it is close to 30GB .	St
1.1.5	This problem even occurs in the BIOS .	St
1.1.6	If I remove the DDV drive , the hard drive reports correctly , and I can access all my files when I boot into WinXP Home SP2 .	St
1.1.7	Does anyone have any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.8	Here are the full specs : Compaq Presario ( I 'll never get another pre-build ever ! )	St
1.1.9	Intel Pentium 4 - 2.66 GHz Intel i845GE chipset 256MB DDR-SDRAM Seagate 40GB U-DMA HDD 5400rpm - Main hard drive IBM-DTLA-307030 30GB U-DMA HDD - Second drive ( the one with the problem ) Generic DVD-ROM 16x ( not connected , but has same problem ) Samsung Writemaster DVD+/-RW TS-H552 Running Windows XP Home OEM + SP2	St
1.2.1	What IDE port is each on , and are they the Master or Slave on their respective cables .	St
1.2.2	Sounds as if the two drives are jumpered the same on the same IDE ribbon cable and is confusing the heck out of your system .	St
1.2.3	Also some mobo 's do n't like a DVD drive as a Master on either the Primary or the Secondary IDE port .	St
1.3.1	I have my HDs on the primary controller and the opticals on the secondary .	St
1.3.2	I 've found that they can both be used ( usually ) on the primary controller with one cable if they are set to CS ( cable select ) .	St
1.4.1	It does n't appear to be the jumper settings .	St
1.4.2	Both the hard drives are on the primary controller on Cable Select , as are the 2 DVD drives on the secondary controller .	St
1.4.3	It seems to be an intermittent problem , as all drives are currently connected and everything seems fine , but eventually , it could BSOD since I 'm using the 2nd HDD for the page file .	St
1.4.4	Other times , I 'd boot and it will give me the problem .	St
1.4.5	As a temporary solution , I 've moved my page file back to my main drive , but are there any other solutions short of backing up my data and getting a new drive ?	Ques
1.5.1	Keep the Hds as CS jumpering but the CD drives as master/slave jumpering .	St
1.5.2	Also , because you have 4 power hungary drives , they can tax the limited Compaq p/s unit .	St
1.5.3	Even if capable for now , your intermit problem could be related to power as a & quot ; flaky operation & quot ; is common in such situations of a burdened p/s .	St
1.5.4	Buying a new larger HD to replace the current HDs does two immediate things , reduce the power load and provides greater mb ( 80-120gb ) storage and probably of 7200rpm class and just be faster overall ( slightly ) .	St
1.5.5	An option worth looking into .	St
1.5.6	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	due to problems that I have run into with trying to use a DVD drive as a Master .	St
1.6.2	Make the hard drives the Master on both ports and the DVD 's slaves on both ports .	St
1.7.1	Actually , it turns out that it is just a problem in the HDD , it must have received some damage .	St
1.7.2	This problem now happens regardless of the amout of drives that I have connected , as I BSODed on my last boot without the DVD drives connected , and the situation is degrading with each reboot .	St
1.7.3	I 'm just gon na backup the data and get a new HDD .	St
1.7.4	It seems to be the only solution .	St
1.7.5	Thanks for the help everyone , it was much appreciated .	St
1.8.1	able to get a hundred dollars as part of the class action suit agains the IBM drives .	St
1.9.1	This is a hand-down from a friend , but he had no problems with it ... his dad just donated an 80GB HDD to him , which is why he gave this drive to me .	St
1.9.2	I 've had it a few months , but its only been in the last week that its given me trouble ... I think the new DVD drive being installed at around the same time is just a co-incidence .	St
1.9.3	No lawsuit for me =/	St
