my mother in law just bought an ao725.
she is totally lost on windows 8. i am attempting to install xp pro, which is what she is familiar with.
i have installed xp on many acer netbooks which came with windows 7, but i cant make any progress here.
the setup program always stops with error 7b.
i have tried using the ide mode for the hd (bios setting), and just about every amd sata driver i can find.
neither of these methods seem to help.
i have also tried xp pro sp1, sp2 and sp3.
i thought installing the 1.05 bios might help (it came with 2.04), but it will not install.
using &quot;free dos&quot; i can run the acer bios flash program zhg105.exe.
initially the 1.05 update program would give a flash write error.
i was able to reflash with the 2.04 bios successfully.
this did not help with the xp install (no change), and after doing that, the 1.05 flash program just resets instead of showing the write fail message (at the same point).
my next thought is to see if i can run a windows pe (preinstall environment) and use the acer windows flash update program (zhg105w.exe).
currently i have ubuntu linux installed, thinking i might be able to update the bios from ubuntu, but i cant find any appropriate file.
do you think i am on the right track with the bios?
any help would be appreciated, and no, she is not going to be happy with windows 8 (i cant get back to windows 8 anyhow) thanks all, les
