I'm on a tight scheldule so i decided to get the 512mb ram one with a 80gb hard drive. The only problem is that the apple website doesnt show it. Amazon before had it for sale and now it went missing. So my question is if apple actually sell a black macbook with 512mb of ram with a 80gb and if not, where is a legit place with the best price? Thanks Candice

All the &quot;legit&quot; places will typically have the same price - if you do find it. If the price looks too good to be true, it is probably a scam.

There is often NO price increase but you get more for the same buck. The current offering is what you really want for RAM and the other items. Bob
