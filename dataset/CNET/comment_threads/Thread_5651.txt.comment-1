I need help.
I just built my first computer and when I powered it up there were no beeps and no display on the monitor.
The led lights and fans go on and and even the light on the motherboard goes on.
These are my parts: MB Asus P5B Deluxe P965 775 CPU Intel C2D E6300 1.86G 775M Video Card VGA EVGA GT -P2-N615-TX-R Memory 1G PQI DII667 MAC41GUOE R PSU Enermax ELT500AWT 500W RT HD 160G SAMG 7K 8M SATA2 HD160HJ
