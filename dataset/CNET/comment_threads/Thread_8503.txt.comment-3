hi thanks for your response .
checked the cpu fan [heat sink] and cleaned it and i am happy to say that it decreased my temperature's for now .
but still my speedfan shows that my Cores are at 35 C when idle and when i am using applications like photoshop / dreamweaver it goes upto 45C .
is this thing related to heatsink ?
i heard from one of my friends that i need to re apply the thermal paste on heatsink .
is that true ?
one more issue is : is my system slowing down because of the HDD which i use is IDE and basically my motherboard supports sata :P .
what could be the reason guys .
thanks for your time
