the nvidea and ati web sites.
they are about the only ones making cards for the mac and they are very proud of them.
your current card is up there with the winners.
for anything much higher than what you have, you need a g5 processor and an 8x agp slot.
btw, it looks like nvidea shows your card with only 128mb ram.
good hunting p
