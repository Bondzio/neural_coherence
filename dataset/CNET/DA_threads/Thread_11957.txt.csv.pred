1.8.1	Hi Ray I though about doing a dual boot, but most of my computer time is online and as such i need win 98 and to be honest with you i dont wanna change that IT IS THE BEST OPERATING SYSTEM AVAILABLE FULL STOP, or maybe im just a stobborn sod that will not accept change, so have decided that for the time being, i will cope with 512megs and stick with what i know !!!!
