The card in the pic looked pretty icky, I assume you cleaned it up and polished the contacts.
If it's working, I'd go for it, if it were mine.
Seems like really the only risk (now you know it's working) is increased risk of corrosion.
But if you eek out another year's service from that guy, it's a win, eh.
