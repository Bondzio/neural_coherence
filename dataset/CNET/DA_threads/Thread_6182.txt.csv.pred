1.1.1	Im purchasing a hp a6230n computer 2.8 dual core , 3 gig ram , 400 hd going to upgrade the graphics card and the one im thinking about is the 8600 gt oc .	St
1.1.2	specs looked good , but i want to know how this card will hold up to todays games , toms hardware 's tier talked about the 8600 gt but not the oc version so i was wondering if anyone here knew about it .	St
1.1.3	thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	From memory it wrote that within the same family you might see about 5 percent change in the scores .	St
1.2.2	It 's a fine card but I 'd still pick from the & quot ; best video card for the money & quot ; any day of the week .	St
1.2.3	Read http : //www.tomshardware.com/2007/10/01/the_best_gaming_graphics_cards_for_the_money/ In closing , no gamer I know of is happy with today 's cards .	St
