<s> Mine is wifi router buffalo WHR G300N. </s>
<s> Any alternative way? </s>
<s> You would need either a router designed with that capability or a compatible adapter kit that can provide the DC input your router needs. </s>
<s> Baring that, you get creative and fashion your own. </s>
<s> You need to add the DC from some area near your modem. </s>
<s> The device used is called an &quot;injector&quot;. </s>
<s> You then need to split the data and power signals at the router. </s>
<s> Typically injectors produce DC at a higher voltage than that which is required for the device they power. </s>
<s> This is the hangup you'll run into. </s>
<s> If your router gets 6v from it's external PS and your injector produces the typical 48v, you may fry something. </s>
<s> Have you checked to see what the DC requirements are of your router and if a kit is available to match? </s>
<s> While I've no real experience with such fabrications, I do suspect there is a reason for PoE to need the higher voltage and that is to ensure delivery of enough current over longer distances such as one encounters over longer wiring runs. </s>
<s> My wifi DC is 12 v and cable modem is 12 v. You mean they need total 24 v to supply power to each networking, rite? </s>
<s> So i need to buy new power adapter which could supply 24v and the injector. </s>
<s> I thought it could make it in easy way without add something component. </s>
<s> I see, That's clear...:) Btw, Do you ever use Buffalo's Router Infinia wireless N? </s>
<s> what do u think? </s>
<s> thx </s>
<s> If your router needs 12vdc, then you need to provide 12vdc to it. </s>
<s> Look here to see what a Google search for 12v PoE adaper finds. </s>
<s> This does not say that the splitter plug will fit your Buffalo router's jack. </s>
<s> No, I've never used that router but have set up a wireless network connecting to several APs using PoE. </s>
<s> In my case, I used a PoE switch which carried power and data to all the connected devices. </s>
<s> It delivered 48vdc. </s>
<s> That's because the APs were designed for PoE. </s>
<s> Your router is not so you have to find or make something to make it work in a manner other than the manufacturer intended. </s>
<s> I suspect you're trying to locate the router in an area which will provide the best coverage and that the area you've chosen has no AC outlet handy. </s>
<s> PoE fills that void and allows you recycle the router by simply disconnecting and reconnecting the Ethernet cable. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
