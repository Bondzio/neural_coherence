<s> Hi, I recently upgraded my HTPC and now it will only turn on sometimes, the other times, nothings happens, no fans spin up, no post, nothing. </s>
<s> Before the upgrade my PC consisted of the following components: - Antec ISK 300-150 - Asus P8H67-I Deluxe - Intel i3 2120 - Corsair DDR3 4GB 1333 Mhz So-dimm - Crucial M4 256 SSD The PC was working normal and it would turn on everytime. </s>
<s> I upgraded my PC with the following parts: - Fractal Design Node 304 - Silverstone SST-ST55F-G Strider Gold Series - 550 Watt - EVGA GTX 670 FTW Signature 2 - Hitachi 2,5' HDD 256GB The other parts stayed the same (except for the Antec case which was replaced by the Node). </s>
<s> I was pretty happy with my build, until it didn't turn on. </s>
<s> I tried to disconnect it from the power outlet for a few minutes, let the capacitors discharge, nothing helped. </s>
<s> After a few tries the PC would suddenly start. </s>
<s> Also sometimes it would start with a few seconds delay, after hitting the power button. </s>
<s> If the pc decides to turn itself on, it will run with no hiccups and no blue screens (tested it with a few hours gaming session). </s>
<s> Also I checked the motherboard, the green led is glowing so I'm suspecting the graphics card or the psu. </s>
<s> Any other ideas or suggestions that could help me figure it out? </s>
<s> You need to return to what you had before but keep in new case and PSU. </s>
<s> Minus the new items then see if it works. </s>
<s> You did too much and hoped for the best. </s>
<s> it should have worked but it came on to something went amiss. </s>
<s> Now, you need to resolve this by removing the new items for now and build-up again, one item at a time. </s>
<s> As I already suggested install the new PSU and allow new case to be the whole system plus the remaining old parts. </s>
<s> From the results of the new build and if it works then proceed to add a new item and see how it works. </s>
<s> I would overall think the new GPU is causing a problem. </s>
<s> It at a tipping point because you seem to be at a go or no go at times. </s>
<s> Of course, you should balance the load too, I, thus make sure your new PSU is the single rail type and still spread the load of connections so the voltages aren't overcome. </s>
<s> Otherwise you have a dual-rail type and you better balance the load demands. </s>
<s> Alas 550W is just about what it needs but on basic principle that means it delivers at least 75% or 80% if rated as such. </s>
<s> Otherwise, again its too much for the PSU when all is installed. </s>
<s> Dlo all that and come back with results. </s>
