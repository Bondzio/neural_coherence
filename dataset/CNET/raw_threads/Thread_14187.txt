Here's my parts list. Motherboard : Asus Sabertooth Z77 CPU : Ivy Bridge i5-3570K RAM : Crucial Ballistix 2 x 2GB (1333 MHz) Boot Drive : Crucial M4 128GB Storage Drive : Western Digital Black 2TB PSU : 80+ Gold LEPA 500W Optical Drive : Not sure... something I pulled out of an old box. I used the stock fan that came with the CPU, and it worked fine for a day. Then yesterday I got a fan error while booting up. I looked inside the case and indeed the fan seemed to be stuttering. It would try and spin up, slow, stop. Then try and spin up again, repeating the whole process. I did a reboot, and the problem went away. Then today I booted it up again and the problem came back, but it's not going away, no matter how many times I reboot. I checked that the fan is in the right header, and it is. I looked and I can see 3 headers there. CPU_FAN, CPU_OPT, and CHA_FAN3. Just to be sure it's really the fan I tried to boot up with the thing plugged into one of these other headers. Nothing changed with CPU_OPT, but when I tried the third one the fan started spinning normally. The computer won't accept it though, it still says there is a fan error and goes right into UEFI. Another thing that puzzles me is that I'm using an Asus board, which comes with Q-LED indicators (those little lights all over the mobo which light up during the boot up). They are supposed to help you solve a boot up problem by staying red at whatever place the problem occurs. Except that when I run into the fan problem, the light stays on at the boot drive... But in UEFI it says my M4 is fine. Please, any help would be really appreciated. The Sabertooth has a 5 year warranty, but I don't even know if it's to blame. I've ordered an aftermarket CPU fan (a Noctua of some sort), but it will be a few days before it gets here. In the meantime, I'd like to know what my options are. Should I ask NCIX (the supplier I used) to take it all back? It's been under a week so it might work, but I guess I would have to repackage them and pay for the shipping and handling... I was hoping to get this up and running in time for Diablo III... I doubt I'll make it. But really at this point I just want a working computer.

6193	3	563201	5311378	5311063	R. Proffitt	5/15/12 1:20 PM	1.337088E12	Still wondering about the video but wait.	I see this has 3 12 Volt rails. Did they offer any way to swap rails?

But for the time being I was planning on just gaming with the integrated Intel HD 4000. I had seen samples of game-play on YouTube of HD 3000, and it looked fairly decent. Especially because I have about a dozen games from 2008 or earlier that I have to catch up on, so an HD 4000 should be plenty, I figure. I haven't had a decent gaming computer in a long time... I'm not sure what you mean by swapping rails... It's semi-modular, it came with a bunch of cables. I used 1 to connect to my 3 drives, and one to connect to all my fans. The rest go to the motherboard.

Since any one rail of that PSU is 25 Amperes I wonder why the maker went for a multiple rail PSU. A single RAIL 500 Watt PSU would have avoided that issue. Can you share which power supply the fan uses? Might be a clue. Bob

6193	7	563201	5311478	5311476	R. Proffitt	5/15/12 5:02 PM	1.33710132E12	Sorry that's the size of the fan.	At this point and with this answer it's time for the service counter.
6193	8	563201	5311502	5311478	PhilippeLemay	5/15/12 5:44 PM	1.33710384E12	Wait...	Well, wait, did you mean the CPU fan, because that's like 8 centimeters, I thought you were still talking about the PSU. Anyway... I'll wait and see what happens with the new CPU cooler I ordered. Hopefully it will be here before Friday.
