The laptops are laptops from my work so they are part of the company's domains.
I can not change them to my desktop's workgroup.
I tried conencting one of my laptops through wired connection and tried to ping to it through the other laptop which is connected through wireless and i am able to connect to either of them without anyproblem.
Both the laptops were in different domains but still they were able to conenct to each other.
I have file and printer sharing enabled on my desktop.
I dont have any antivirus software on my machine.
Can this problem be because of some virus attack or something.
Thanks Nirmala
