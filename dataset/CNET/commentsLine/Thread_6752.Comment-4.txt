1. firewire use of hard drives on windows has resulted in too many wipeouts for me to write it's viable.
my advice is to &quot;forget about it&quot; if you are running windows.
2. nas speed is about 1/4 or less the speed of usb speed.
while nas is a great thing most have 100 megabit ethernet which pales is comparison to usb 2.0's 480 megabit link.
hope this helps you decide.
