<s> This is both a peripheral and a software question. </s>
<s> Having no experience with any of the chat platforms or PC video cameras, I am looking for suggestions on which is the best camera/chat combo to use with my daughter and granddaughter. </s>
<s> I am in Michigan, she is in Montana. </s>
<s> We both have PC's running XP, and both have DSL. </s>

<s> Yes, I found I had posted in the wrong place, but could not see how to delete the first one. </s>
<s> I have used other Logitech devices and was satisfied. </s>
<s> Will the camera come with software so that if I bought two I could connect with my daughter, or will we have to use Messenger, ICQ, Yahoo etc.? </s>
<s> If so, which one of those should I use? </s>

<s> Yes and most end up using either the supplied or one of the packages you listed. </s>
<s> I can't say why people choose one over the other. </s>
