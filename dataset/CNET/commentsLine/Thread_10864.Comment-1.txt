i just got a gigabyte ep45-ud3p motherboard, and was going to install an oem splash screen, using the included utility that came with the motherboard.
i ran the utility, and windows bluescreened on me.
when i turn it on, the computer says: award bootblock bios v1.0 copyright (c) 2000, award software, inc. and then it just hangs.
any tips?
it won't do anything from there.
