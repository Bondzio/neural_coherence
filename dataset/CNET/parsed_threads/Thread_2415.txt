<s> So my computer's barely a year old, and the other week I found that the wire to my mouse had been cut due to constant pulling. </s>
<s> THe idiot that I am, I compressed the wire and suddenly saw sparks, and a message popped up alerting me of a hardware failure, and suddenly my computer shut off. </s>
<s> Now when I try to turn it on, it just hangs on me. </s>
<s> The computer turns on, but nothing starts and nothing beeps--the cd drive doesn't run nor does the floppy drive. </s>
<s> I thought it might be the harddrive that got fried, so I bought a new one, but that still didn't work. </s>
<s> My computer-tech friend looked at my computer and tested all the components except the motherboard, and they seemed to work fine. </s>
<s> So my question is, is it possible for the motherboard to fail due to a short-circuited mouse? </s>
<s> I'm just wanting to make sure before I buy a new motherboard. </s>
<s> It does sound like the motherboard got damaged. </s>
<s> All I can think of is that when you put the wires back together, they were mismatched, and the voltage ended up going where it shouldn't have. </s>
<s> This very well could have caused the failure, and if your friend has already tested everything else, it looks like the mobo did get fried. </s>
<s> A little more info, please. </s>
<s> Was it a PS 2 mouse? </s>
<s> Have you tried leaving the PS 2 mouse port disconnected and using a USB mouse?? </s>
<s> Will your system boot up to the first video screen with nothing connected to the mobo except video card, memory, CPU/HSF, the power supply and the front panel connections? </s>
<s> No mouse, no keyboard?? </s>
<s> You may have zapped the I/O chip on the mobo, and possibly the Southbridge chip. </s>
<s> Sounds as if you need a new mobo. </s>
