I hadn't burnt a CD in a about two months, and yesterday decided to back up some of my documents. But now, whenever I try to burn a CD, the drive starts off and then the PC restarts. Every damn time. I use Nero 6.0 for burning but the problem persists with Windows burning too. I haven't installed any new devices in a while, and not installed any software that I think would cause a problem. My system is also virus and adware-free. Any recommendations on what might be the problem? Is it the power supply?
