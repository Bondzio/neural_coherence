<s> I am thinking about building my own PC in the near future (once I save up enough money). </s>
<s> I don't want to be spending a ridiculous amount of money on this computer, but I was wondering if, I want to run PC games on Max settings for example, will this make my PC too expensive? </s>
<s> It's probably a dumb question, but I am a beginner here, and am just interested in building a great PC! </s>
<s> So, my more specific question is, will I need a GTX 680 GPU? </s>
<s> What are other alternatives that will produce great results so I can run games on maxed settings? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help! </s>
<s> Max settings.....that's great but very very expensive. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Is that custom PC might not work. </s>
<s> I've seen folk think they can build a cheaper PC but fail horribly as they discover they can't install Windows properly. </s>
<s> Very few have the background to get it right and the lesson to learn is simple. </s>
<s> Ready? </s>
<s> COPY SOMEONE'S SUCCESSFUL BUILD. </s>
<s> If you create a new custom design, you have admitted you're OK with new issues, replacing a card that didn't work out etc. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Maybe I'll find someone's custom build then. </s>
<s> That will probably be a lot easier. </s>
<s> I guess what you really need to do is ask yourself what you mean by expensive? </s>
<s> I know that expensive for me may mean something completely different for someone else. </s>
<s> Basically I need more information to help. </s>
<s> Are we talking a $600 computer that will play newly released FPSs at max level? </s>
<s> Or are we talking a $1500 computer? </s>
<s> I really don't think designing and building a computer is all that hard, just take your time and research each component thoroughly. </s>
<s> It's a great way to learn and there are many forums available that will help you check the compatibility of your components. </s>
