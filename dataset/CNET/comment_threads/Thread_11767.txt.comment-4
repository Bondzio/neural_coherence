I've lost count of machines with no install plan and makers are not helping.
Microsoft had decades to correct this but there's another issue here.
You will find that the driver you use on the card will change as you change the version of the driver.
That is, if a driver goes for speed at the expense of some exactness of the pixels then some gamer flames them on that the fixed driver is usually slower.
There's also too many settings I can tinker with to affect FPS.
So if you are getting more FPS than the old system it's probably fine.
But let's say you aren't happy.
Why not make this a warranty issue and if the maker doesn't help, just return it.
