i took a screen shot of the device manager:  i bought this laptop from the gateway site last summer, august 2007, it came with vista.
it had a harddrive problem so they sent me another with factory defaults this past winter, 1/2008, so it's even more strange the driver is from 2006. i googled my installation error &quot;the driver being installed is not validated for this computer&quot; and it seems like other people with gateway laptops have this error.
