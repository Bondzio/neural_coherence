I am getting ready to buy a new computer, but they all seem to come with Windows Vista, but I really just want Windows XP. My question is this: Can I use the Windows XP startup disc from my previous PC instead of the software that comes with the new computer? I don't seem to think that would be a problem, I just thought that I would get input from some of you pros out there, thanks for any advice/input.

In terms of drivers which is what allows the Operating System to communicate with hardware like the graphics card that displays the output, network connections, and other devices tied to the system. I think that would be my main concern if you tried to take a Vista machine and just install XP on it. Regards, JB

This would allow you to specify it as an XP machine as they should be capable of handling that request rather than going into a Best Buy or Circuit City and buying off the shelf. Regards, JB
