1.1.1	I just purchased a Dell laptop that came with a free 802.11G Netgear Router .	St
1.1.2	I currently have a Linksys 802.11b router with one wired desktop ( windows 2000 ) , 2 wireless desktops ( one running xp - one 2000 ) and three laptops ( XP ) .	St
1.1.3	My question is .. Do I need to get two netgear usb adapters to replace the linksys adapters or will they work with the new router ( at the slower speed ) .	St
1.1.4	I figured I would ask before I start ripping everything apart and have no internet in the house .	St
1.1.5	thanks for any assistance jim	Polite
1.2.1	have the ability to discriminate between ''B '' and ''G '' adapters without setting the speed to the lowest common denominator .	St
1.2.2	If LAN transfers are not an issue then you can live with the mixed mode method , elsewise upgrade to all ''G '' .	St
1.3.1	G02.11g is backwards compatible with 802.11g You are just restricted to 802.11b speeds	St
