<s> I'm about to buy a new videocard. </s>
<s> With my budget, i've decided on a Sapphire built ATI Radeon 9600XT 256MB. </s>
<s> Can anyone offer any advice here, does anyone who has this card recommend it or want to slag it off. </s>
<s> I've got about 120 to spend. </s>
<s> The system I'm using is an ASUS A7V600, Thoroughbred 2400+ XP 266FSB with 256MB of DDR RAM (although this will increase to 512 in the next couple of days). </s>
<s> Any help is apreciated </s>
<s> Imagine the person who changes from one model to another and sees ZERO payoff? </s>
<s> It happens too often. </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com has video card benchmarks which from memory included the 5600, but without knowing what you have now, it's unclear whether its worth changing. </s>

<s> Well, thats a good card. </s>
<s> but to me your front isde bus is low. </s>
<s> but yeah its a good card. </s>
<s> And you need like 1gig of ram. </s>
<s> It's a Geoforce 4 MX 440 so I'm anticipating I'll notice the difference. </s>
<s> Thanks for the link BTW. </s>

<s> The increase in power demands is enough to be sure your machine has the right power as well. </s>
<s> Read http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/ </s>
<s> I agree, make sure you have enough power. </s>
<s> ALSO make sure that the PSU you buy (if you buy one) is NOT one of those cheapos. </s>
<s> Brand names are desired when looking for a PSU: Antec, Thermaltake, PC Power & Cooling, and Sparkle, just to name a few. </s>
<s> You should be looking at ones above the $40, especially when going for a PSU of 350W or more. </s>
<s> The girlfriend is getting me a PSU for my birthday so I should be sweet, probably about a 450W. </s>
<s> That should do the job as I've got another HD I want to put in and there are 6 fans in my case so it does need quite alot of power. </s>
<s> I've also checked Tomshardware and I think I'm gonna spend another 30 and get the 9800 Pro 128MB, it seems to out perform the 9600XT in all of the benchmarks and the price difference isn't too substancial. </s>
<s> Thanks to everyone who's offered advice on this! </s>
