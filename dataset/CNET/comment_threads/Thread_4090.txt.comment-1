So I've been shopping around for a desktop to replace my old laptop and at first I was looking at Newegg, which lead to ibuyPower (I'd like a custom build) but after reading the reviews on ibuyPower I was hesitant to go with them.
One of the reviews suggested Ironside Computers.
So I went to their website and poked around bit, they seem reputable, although there were a few warning signs that went up.
First, under Testimonials, there were only 5.
Total.
Second, there was only one entry on Resellerratings.com Third, I haven't been able to find any quality discussion about the company on-line.
So I turn to you cnet, They any good?
