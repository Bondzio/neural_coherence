1.1.1	I have just recently tried to add a Netgear MR814v2 router to my system.	St
1.1.2	I am on a cable modem.	St
1.1.3	My operating system is Windows XP.	St
1.1.4	I have a 1.3 GZ Athalon (sp?)	St
1.1.5	system.	St
1.1.6	Everything works fine while I am hooked directly to the cable modem.	St
1.1.7	When I add the Router to the mix, the internet connection slows to a crawl.	St
1.1.8	I am connected by an ethernet cable - not wireless.	St
1.1.9	I have talked with the router tech people and have tried all their suggestions but nothing seems to work.	St
1.1.10	We can ping the sites and all seems fine but to load a page takes forever.	St
1.1.11	I know very little about networking or anything so any help would be appreciated.	St
1.1.12	Thanks, Billie	St
1.2.1	My suggestions are: 1) Look for a firmware update 2) Try another router.	St
