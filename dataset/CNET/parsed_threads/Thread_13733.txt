<s> I have a few general motherboard questions, but since I am specifically looking at Intel boards, I decided to post in this section. </s>
<s> For reference, I am looking at the following boards (with which I intend to use a Q9450 upon release): ABIT IP35 Pro - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813127030 DFI LP UT P35 T2R - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813136037 DFI BloodIron P35-T2RL - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813136038 GIGABYTE GA-P35-DS3L - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128059 GIGABYTE GA-P35-DS3R - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128050 Here are my questions: 1) Do these chipsets/memory controllers suffer from the problem of slowing the memory down or having to run looser timings if all four slots are used? </s>
<s> 2) Are all the sata ports locked on them, or are some unlocked? </s>
<s> Or are all sata ports locked on current motherboards, as I don't see any talk about this with the newer boards (I'm currently running an MSI K8N Neo2 Platinum, which has 2 locked and 2 unlocked)? </s>
<s> 3) The first 3 boards state a memory standard of DDR2 800, the fourth says DDR2 1066, and the fifth says both. </s>
<s> Some of the ones that say 800 say they support 1066 on the manufacturers' websites, some don't. </s>
<s> And then some motherboards say 1200, and DDR2 goes up to 1300. </s>
<s> Basically, there's a lot of different numbers flying around, and I'm having a hard time making sense of it all. </s>
<s> What exactly is meant by &quot;memory standard,&quot; and why is the fastest memory (1300) higher than the highest memory standard on the motherboards (1200). </s>
<s> 4) Some boards have listed in their FSB and memory standard specs 1600(OC) and 1200(OC) respectively. </s>
<s> What's the deal with this? </s>
<s> Does it help with overclocking, and if so, how? </s>
<s> You are fighting simple laws of physics here. </s>
<s> More chips on the bus means more capacitance per device so there can be a slowing. </s>
<s> I'm going to decline explaining physics, electronics in detail here. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> That's a new term for SATA ports. </s>
<s> When you write a new term, explain it. </s>
<s> 3. and 4. </s>
<s> You want the 1066 support and as to overclocking I see too many hit the repair counters in overclocked mode, we set it back and it works again. </s>
<s> $120 charge to set it back is steep so take this as a free lessson. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Locked SATA ports don't increase in frequency with the FSB when overclocking. </s>
<s> Unlocked ones do, and therefore will corrupt the hard drives on them. </s>
<s> As for overclocking, I am currently overclocking my 3800 X2 (stock 3GHz) at 3.5GHz, so I am not new to it. </s>
<s> I understand the risks involved and have a pretty good grasp on how to do it and what's involved. </s>
<s> I am just wondering about the OC ratings because I haven't seen them before. </s>
<s> I think they probably mean the board is guaranteed to be stable at those speeds, meaning up to them you are limited only by your other components' capabilities, but I am not sure. </s>
<s> As for $120 to reset the CMOS, don't you think that's pretty steep? </s>
<s> You're basically figuring on at least a few hundred dollars an hour there assuming it takes you a very long time of about 20 minutes to open the computer up and move the jumper or pop the battery. </s>
<s> We have 2 speeds today and these can't be changed. </s>
<s> &quot;SATA drives simply disappear when the link frequency exceeds the 10% overclock&quot; Sorry, but somewhere there is a lot of bad information out there. </s>
<s> This may be an area where you'll find plenty. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> 1) with the p35 chipset, if you stick with fast ddr2-800 dimms and run them at their standard rated timings (cl4), all 4 slots should run the same without issue. </s>
<s> if you're overclocking (or using memory with especially aggressive timings) you'll have to drop back to 2T and you may have to increase your ram voltage (compared to 2 dimms). </s>
<s> 2) overclocking won't affect any of the sata ports from the intel ich9 hub. </s>
<s> as for any 'extra' sata ports you'll have to check the mobo manual. </s>
<s> 3) there are 5 jedec 'standard' speeds for ddr2: 400, 533, 667, 800, and 1066. all the mobos you listed will work with ddr2-1066. </s>
<s> those that only list official support for ddr2-800 will not auto-configure ddr2-1066 but you can do that yourself in the bios. </s>
<s> other numbers (like ddr2-1200) indicate the fastest memory that the manufacturer will support. </s>
<s> 4) the 1600(OC) fsb and 1200(OC) mem does refer to overclocking. </s>
<s> those are targets that the mobo manufacturer will support. </s>
<s> if you exceed them, you're on your own. </s>
<s> Thanks for the information. </s>
<s> I think I have a much better grasp on things, but am still not quite where I need to be to be able to make all my decisions for my new build. </s>
<s> 1) I am planning on running DDR2 1000 memory, and I am also planning to overclock, so I guess it depends on what I end up running them at with the memory dividers. </s>
<s> From your response I take it my choices are I can run it faster, but pretty much guarantee only being able to use two sticks to avoid a slowdown of the memory, unless I can convince it to maintain its speed with higher voltages (I'm personally not a big fan of overvolting memory very much), or I can run it slower and shouldn't have a problem with 4 sticks. </s>
<s> So I guess it will come down to whether I want the little extra speed or more capacity. </s>
<s> I'll probably just stick with a 2x2 setup, should be more than enough. </s>
<s> Also, I was under the impression DDR2 rarely performs at 1T at 800 and above. </s>
<s> 2) All I needed to know. </s>
<s> I only need 3, so knowing that at least 4 will be locked works for me I thought the northbridge controlled the sata ports, might be why I couldn't find much info on it. </s>
<s> Makes a lot more sense that the southbridge would control it, not really sure why I thought that... 4) So it sounds like I was accurate in my assumption then, basically just a guaranteed overclocking capability for the motherboard. </s>
<s> Pretty much what I do for memory: buy cheap memory that doesn't OC well but is rated at a faster speed and costs half as much as the slower stuff that OCs better to get you to the same speed. </s>
<s> 1) if you stick with common timings (ddr2-800, 4-4-4-15), all four sticks should be able to run at those timings. </s>
<s> you get into the cas 3's then it's doubtful because that's really pusing things to their limit and way past the official spec. </s>
<s> there are some ddr2-800 dimms with 1t (example: http://www.dvhardware.net/article18009.html ). </s>
<s> 2) info on p35 chipset: http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=2993&p=4 4) no overclocking is guaranteed. </s>
<s> those are oc levels that the manufacturer says are possible and will support (you can call tech support). </s>
