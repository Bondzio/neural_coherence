1.1.1	I 've had a Seagate FreeAgent Desktop 500gb hard drive for 1yr+ .	St
1.1.2	It looked to good to be true with its small footprint , loads of space and ease of use .	St
1.1.3	Well , it was too good to be true .	St
1.1.4	It shows up as an available drive less than 1 % of the time .	St
1.1.5	Frighteningly the last 8 years of my photographs are stored here .	St
1.1.6	CNET 's editor reviews for the FreeAgent are good , so I 'm a little scared to trust what they say .	St
1.1.7	I 've read all over the web how terrible this drive is .	St
1.1.8	I want something that 's reliable and can be used as an active external drive so I can access photos , etc .	St
1.1.9	that are too large for my computer .	St
1.1.10	Secondly I 'd like it to also function as a backup drive for my computer , which is a Dell Inspiron 8600 .	St
1.1.11	- What solutions can you recommend for this novice ?	Ques
1.1.12	- If I 'm using it for backup of my computer , should n't I also have additional backup of my photos ?	Ques
1.1.13	CDs do n't hold much data , so what are the other options ?	Ques
1.1.14	- Is it true that external storage is generally not reliable ?	Ques
1.1.15	What gives ?	Ques
1.1.16	What are average people supposed to do w/their stuff ?	Ques
1.1.17	- Is a USB connection not ideal for something like this ?	Ques
1.1.18	If so , what are the other options ?	Ques
1.1.19	Wondering if I have enough ports on my laptop & docking station .	St
1.1.20	I 'm hoping some of you techies can help me out here with this basic , but important dilemma .	St
1.2.1	- & gt ; A possible fix is to connect the drive to the desktops rear USB ports since front ports are known to be unreliable .	St
1.2.2	Hard disks are temporary storage .	St
1.2.3	If you do n't backup to other places and media then you may find out why people write so much about backup .	St
1.2.4	Let 's start with - & gt ; There is no trustworthy storage unit out there .	St
1.2.5	I 'm going to include the DROBO in that wide ranging statement .	St
1.2.6	With that out of the way we use many such units at the office .	St
1.2.7	Many are just hard disks bought on sale and then some USB case to hold them .	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	I have had a external drive that is NAS based .	St
1.3.2	The box I purchased is a Promise NAS4300N .	St
1.3.3	It supports Windows , MAC , Linux , etc ...	St
1.3.4	It is not as portable as a simple external drive , but if redundancy and safety of the data is important , here you go ... .. http : //www.promise.com/product/product_detail_eng.asp ? segment=undefined & product_id=177 The great thing about this box is that I have had it over a year with no problems , and it has 1GE ethernet for direct access , and support for a printer server , UPS backup interface , etc .	St
1.3.5	Here is how I use it : I put 4 1TB drives in it ( You can get smaller or larger drives ) and set the device for RAID 10 ( Mirrored , striped , redundant ) .	St
1.3.6	Promise now has support for four ( 4 ) 1.5TB drives ( Total space=6TB Raid 0 , or 3TB raid 10 ) .	St
1.3.7	You can have as little as 1 drive in there , but to get the redundant capability , you need RAID 1 or better .	St
1.3.8	After setting up the unit , I plug it into a APS Power backup unit model 1500 with USB interface cable to the Device , and I plug my USB printer into another port .	St
1.3.9	I now have a device that is on a UPS and will shut down if the UPS goes below 10 % battery , printer support , redundant data that will recover if a drive fails , and a screamer on performance .	St
1.3.10	Performance : I measured 150Megabit over a hard-wired , 100MB over wireless-N and I can play movies to my laptop from the network device if I use my linksys N-Series card that talks to a linksys N-Series Wireless router .	St
1.3.11	FYI : On my son 's gaming computer , he can connect the DVI directly into the HDMI on the HD TV and play the movies directly there just by clicking on a movie file that is digitally transferred to this large NAS device .	St
1.3.12	( instant picture and movie management from your PC ) Future Products : Promise is coming out with another SOHO 2x speed improvement , same price in March .	St
1.3.13	4 drives , same software , faster CPU with more memory .	St
1.3.14	Where to buy : Best 1TB and 1.5TB disk drive price is at http : //www.tigerdirect.com $ 150 for a 1.5TB drive , $ 90 for 1TB .	St
1.3.15	I recommend the Hitachi Deskstor for 1TB and Seagate 7200RPM 1.5TB for higher capacity .	St
1.3.16	You can buy the Promise NAS unit at FRYS .	St
1.3.17	I would buy ALL the same drive types .	St
1.3.18	FYI : I also bought a second NAS unit , put 2 1TB drives in that and copy the master NAS data to this backup drive and put the backup unit in a fire safe .	St
1.3.19	If I loose my pictures , movies , etc , I would be VERY upset ! !	St
1.3.20	!	St
1.4.1	i use simple tech and have had no real problems to date ( 6 years ) they update drivers as new things become available , i have had to restore items back to computer and always restored just like i backed-up.also simpletech will not back-up or restore corrupted files .	St
1.5.1	I can recommend almost anything from IOMEGA .	St
1.5.2	I currently have a Firewire external 120GB drive plus a 1TB network server , both from IOMEGA and have been quite happy with them .	St
1.5.3	They were reasonably priced and have proven to be perfectly reliable , which is all I could ask .	St
1.5.4	The 1TB NAS unit came with software to support backing up under both Windows and Linux , which is critical for me in a network server .	St
1.5.5	In the past , I 've used USB external drives from IOMEGA as well , and was equally pleased with them .	St
1.6.1	not an external .	St
1.6.2	I told you so .	St
1.7.1	I have 2 Western Digital My Book Essentials with 500 GBs and 2 with 1 TBs each .	St
1.7.2	Aside from having to reformat the 1 TB units from FAT 32 to NTCS , I have been very pleased with their performance .	St
1.7.3	Reformatting assistance was available at Western Digital 's website .	St
1.7.4	Try one ; prices have dropped recently .	St
1.7.5	I even dropped one of them about three feet and it still works .	St
1.7.6	Good luck with your search ! Larry : ~ )	Polite
1.8.1	Be advised that External Power Supplies are notoriously unreliable .	St
1.8.2	I 've used External HD 's by Antec , Mad Dog , ADS , Western Digital : The Power Bricks all failed eventually .	St
1.8.3	They are expensive or impossible to replace .	St
1.8.4	On the other hand , failures of the actual Hard Drives inside these units are no worse than any other HD 's - save for the fact they may be dropped and mishandled more than HD 's mounted into actual Computers .	St
1.8.5	TIPS : 1 : Plug the Power Brick into the Wall Outlet ONLY when Backing-Up to the External HD .	St
1.8.6	This will extend the limited life of the Power Brick .	St
1.8.7	2 : Consider taking an older Computer , installing a large HD into it , and Backing Up to it over a Network .	St
1.8.8	The Computer 's Power Supply will last far longer than any Power Brick .	St
1.8.9	You will have to take care that the O/S and BIOS of this Computer can handle the form ( PATA or SATA ) and size of this Backup Drive .	St
1.8.10	Older O/S 's may not recognize the full capacity of larger Drives .	St
1.9.1	As explained before , if your External Hard Drive suddenly becomes impossible to access , DO N'T FREAK OUT .	St
1.9.2	If you start Re-Initializing the HD , Formatting it , etc. , you will lose your Data .	St
1.9.3	Remember any sudden failure is likely either caused by cables coming loose , or by a dying Power Supply .	St
1.9.4	If you ca n't come up with a replacement PS , open the case , remove the HD , and try it inside your Computer .	St
1.9.5	It is probably ok .	St
1.10.1	i have a kit you can buy for about 35 $ , it is apower supply a usb cord and on the end is connection for a usb2.0 to IDE & SATA or you can connect another hard drive its quite handy to check out hard drive etc	St
1.11.1	There are many External Hard Drives , some as low as $ 15 ( sometimes $ 10 ! ) .	St
1.11.2	Then there is the Antec MX-1 , which sells for as much as $ 70 .	St
1.11.3	It 's quite nice .	St
1.11.4	Mine failed after 5 months .	St
1.11.5	I paid $ 12 to ship it back to Antec , who replaced it promptly .	St
1.11.6	I am curious in the more expensive Promise ( and others ) Network Hard Drive RAID solutions .	St
1.11.7	Has anyone had one for many 2 or 3 years , on 24/7 , without failure ?	Ques
1.12.1	a/k/a External power supplies ... Granted , they do tend to be one of the least reliable components , but they 're not particularly expensive and hardly impossible to replace .	St
1.12.2	I keep a spare multi-voltage model from Radio Shack which comes with multiple interchangeable tips/plugs .	St
1.12.3	With it , I can replace any wall wart from 3-12VDC and up to 1000mA .	St
1.12.4	IIRC , it cost me around $ 20 .	St
1.13.1	For years now , all of my critical external hard drives have been either USB or Firewire powered .	St
1.13.2	Wall warts are rarely necessary anymore .	St
1.14.1	Many of these External Power Supplies come with oddball multi-pin plugs that fit only their brand of Hard Drive Enclosure .	St
1.14.2	A month ago I called Western Digital to inquire about a replacement .	St
1.14.3	After being on hold for over twenty minutes the Support Person on the other end , who spoke very poor English , told me the Power Supplies would not be available for SIX WEEKS - if then .	St
1.14.4	He told me to call back .	St
1.14.5	He also did not know the price .	St
1.14.6	And I 'm betting S & H would be closer to $ 10 than $ 5 .	St
1.14.7	I would not be a bit surprised if a Replacement ended up costing more than $ 30 to my door , only to last another 10 months before failing again .	St
1.14.8	Sure you can buy a Radio Shack Generic , break out the Soldering Iron , cut some Heat Shrink , do some splicing and make a replacement .	St
1.14.9	But not everyone is capable of that feat .	St
1.14.10	But you 're right ; that is the only practical solution if a person wants to make use of Enclosures with dead PS 's .	St
1.14.11	It 's sad than the manufacturers make the Enclosures so nice , and then include PS 's that are so crummy .	St
1.15.1	& quot ; Many of these External Power Supplies come with oddball multi-pin plugs that fit only their brand of Hard Drive Enclosure. & quot ; So far , I 've never owned an external hard drive that did n't have a power connector that 's not available for my Radio Shack universal power adapter .	St
1.15.2	Off the shelf , it came with ( IIRC ) 4 of the most common different size/types of connector , both male and female .	St
1.15.3	Another half-dozen or so connectors are available as accessories and I have most of them .	St
1.15.4	Which way you attach the connector determines which contact is positive and which is negative .	St
1.15.5	The voltage is changed by a slide switch on the wall wart case .	St
1.15.6	I do n't doubt that it 's possible to find devices with truly proprietary power connectors , but I always look at the devices before I buy them - either in a store or in a picture on a web site .	St
1.15.7	By now , I ; ve seen all the standard types and would avoid any that are truly non-standard .	St
1.15.8	The only devices I have or have seen that have truly proprietary have been those from big bucks manufacturers who can afford the NRE ( Non-Recurring Engineering ) costs to manufacture such a beast .	St
1.15.9	Most settle for some standard connector .	St
1.15.10	Some of these may seem oddball but they 're still standard parts from some vendor 's catalog .	St
1.15.11	The typically Chinese manufacturers already have invested the resources to come up with the molds to manufacture the connector/wire assemblies .	St
1.15.12	This is a volatile market and no one short of a laptop manufacturer can afford the NRE costs of non-standard connectors .	St
1.15.13	As I said , every externally powered device I 've ever owned or seen has used a standard connector - either a molded-on plug or some USB variant .	St
1.16.1	These units are sold by Antec , Mad Dog , Vantec , and probably about a dozen others .	St
1.16.2	Upper Left is +12V , Upper Right +5V , lower pins both are Ground .	St
1.16.3	http : //www.amazon.com/Antec-MX-100-Aluminum-Enclosure-Drive/dp/B000XQDTRW/ref=sr_1_2 ? ie=UTF8 & s=electronics & qid=1227458846 & sr=1-2 I also have a couple of ADS Enclosures , with 5-Pin Sockets .	St
1.16.4	Sadly they do not identify the Voltages .	St
1.16.5	I forget what connection my WD uses ; it 's at work .	St
1.16.6	My Maxtor One-Touch has a standard , tubular connector ; I 'll assume it is 12V .	St
1.16.7	I 've got a couple of others kicking around in the attic .	St
1.16.8	It 's too cold to check those out today .	St
1.17.1	If anyone knows of a good online source for replacement Power Supplies that can plug right into the many different Sockets , it would be very helpful .	St
1.18.1	Those are oddball , but not because of the connector ( which is a DIN variant - see http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_connector ) , but because it 's a dual voltage connector .	St
1.18.2	This gets back to my previous caution against buying anything with a connector you do n't recognize .	St
1.18.3	The issue with the Antec unit is that it 's not an external hard drive , but an external hard drive enclosure .	St
1.18.4	As such , it has to supply all the voltages a HDD needs ( 5VDC and 12VDC ) while being as inexpensive as possible .	St
1.18.5	If you were to buy a non-DIY external drive , it would typically have a single voltage connector if it is n't powered by USB or Firewire .	St
1.18.6	Also , since enclosures are designed to be cheap and attractive ( did I mention cheap ?	Ques
1.18.7	) , their wall warts are concomitantly cheap .	St
1.18.8	Building an external hard drive is just as easy as building a complete computer , but is , in my experience , hard to justify .	St
1.18.9	YOU may save a few bucks and wind up with an inferior unit .	St
1.18.10	That 's true even if you use all new components .	St
1.18.11	The picture is even bleaker if you use a used HDD from your spare parts .	St
1.18.12	Under the proper circumstances , I have no qualms about building computers , but building external hard drives is something I 'd avoid , simply because of the potential quality pitfalls .	St

1.20.1	My Western Digital was purchased as a complete pre-assembled External Hard Drive ; the Power Supply lasted just 10 months .	St
1.20.2	And as I have related , the folks at WD do n't expect to have Replacements In Stock for six weeks or longer .	St
1.20.3	Not good .	Polite
1.20.4	My Antec MX-1 is a $ 60 unit with no Hard Drive included .	St
1.20.5	The PS failed after 5 months , but Antec was very prompt in replacing it .	St
1.20.6	Assembling a Hard Drive into an Enclosure is a very easy procedure ; at least I think so .	St
1.20.7	And I like knowing exactly what HD is going into my Enclosure .	St
1.20.8	Sometimes the HD included in a pre-built External HD is lacking in Cache Memory , or RPM .	St
1.20.9	Not that these make a whole lot of difference using USB 2.0 .	St
1.20.10	But with eSATA it 's a whole different story .	St
1.20.11	My definition of a Standard Connector is not whether an Engineer can contact Allied Electronics or Newark and buy it off the shelf , but rather if it is possible to buy a Replacement Power Supply all assembled with the proper plug from Amazon or Radio Shack .	St
1.21.1	Do a search for Universal Power Supply on Amazon and quite a few will appear .	St
1.21.2	Considering that Routers , Switches , Scanners , Printers , all reply on Power Bricks it may not be a bad idea to buy one or two just to have around .	St
1.21.3	Though I must admit I 've had very little trouble with the stock Power Supplies on most everything EXCEPT External Hard Drives .	St
1.21.4	Perhaps they draw higher amps and stress the PS more than other components .	St
1.22.1	years ... .3.5 & quot ; USB 2.0 , 3.5 & quot ; USB 2.0 and sSATA and 2.5 & quot ; USB 2.0 and they have worked without fail for HDDs up to 1TB .	St
1.22.2	Unfortunately they stopped manufacturing USB and eSATA external enclosures a year or so perhaps longer .	St
1.22.3	I also have an Antec MX-1 and an Azio 2.5 & quot ; USB 2.0 and eSATA with a 500GB SATA HDD .	St
1.22.4	VAPCMD	St
1.23.1	- If your photos are valuable , you should burn them to a DVD ( dual layer holds 8.5 GB of data ) and store them **off site** , like a friend 's home of a bank safe .	St
1.23.2	This is in case of theft or fire .	St
1.23.3	- All hard drive storage is unreliable .	St
1.23.4	But if you use 2 of them the chances that both fails at the same time are slight .	St
1.23.5	- USB 2.0 is fast enough , IEEE 1384 ( aka FireWire ) is almost the same and most recent laptops have both ports .	St
1.23.6	eSata is faster but only computers bought very recently have the necessary port .	St
