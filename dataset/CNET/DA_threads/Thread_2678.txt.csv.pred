1.1.1	Hi myWD800BB-22JHAO just stopped working one day.It came pre-installed in my Gateway pc.It 's only one year old.I bought a new HD & quot ; WD800JB-00JJAO & quot ; & swapped the pcb.It spun up , & showed in bios but I ca n't see or access it.It shows in device Mgr .	St
1.1.2	but not in disk management.Its an 80gb HD but in device manager it shows up as & quot ; WDC ROM MODEL -- SABRE -- ..7.87 gb & quot ; .In bios It shows as & quot ; WDC ROM MODEL -- SABRE -- ..80gb & quot ; Im a total newbie so I am confused .All I want is the data back.All Gateway & western digital will do is replace the drive.I could careless about the hard drive I just want my pictures & music back.So i have a few questions for any one who may know how I can fix this.I would definately send it to a data recovery company if I had the money , but Im a student W/o a lot of money & ca n't afford it .	St
1.1.3	So my questions are , is there a way I can access the drive by just finding a similar pcb ?	Ques
1.1.4	Or am I going to have to find the same or similar pcb & swap & solder a chip from the donor to the dead pcb board ?	Ques
1.1.5	and last , I was looking @ something called cloning the broken pcb 's ROM ? There is a guy on E-bay that claims it will work & quot ; Dariusale HDD solutions & quot ; I would appreciate any info on this topic Thank You for your time & Patience I 'm @ a loss b/c there were no signs or problems b4 it went kaput , no odd sounds , beeps , or clicking .	St
1.1.6	I ran a diagnostic program ( ontrack easy recovery ) 2 try & get the data out ( w/ the good pcb ) It spun up smoothly seemed perfect but , failed the test saying it could n't go thru w/ the test b/c of bad or errors or sectors or something 2 that effect.. Hopefully you can enlighten me .	St
1.1.7	Thank you for your time & patience , Angela MDL # : WD800-22JHAO 7200rpm 2 cache IDE caviar DATE:08NOV2004 DCM # : HSCANTJAH PCB # 2061-001292-000 AD made in Thailand	St
1.2.1	Move to DRIVE SAVERS ( google.com ) since they have the expertise to get this done .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	I did n't replace the PCB yet .	St
1.3.2	I hope to.If I can find a match. & I did call DriveSavers & even W/ a 10 % discount It would still cost from 1200-2400 just to swap out the PCB .	St
1.3.3	What is cloning a boards ROM ?	Ques
1.3.4	Is this a real thing ?	Ques
1.3.5	There is a guy in canada who says he can do this esp .	St
1.3.6	w/ WD drives & he has an E-bay store called ''Dariusale HDD solutions '' .Im a total newbie so forgive my ignorance , but is it really possible to clone a PCB 's ROM ?	Ques
1.4.1	Hi , look at this link and see if it will help .	St
1.4.2	http : //www.rainbow-software.org/hardware/hotflash.html	St
1.5.1	Do n't take this hard but if you ask this question , you wo n't be doing this very soon .	St
1.5.2	Besides the equipment to do so can run past 4 figures .	St
1.5.3	As to finding the PCB , I re-read your first post and you seem to claim you already did this .	St
1.5.4	If not then you get on google.com and search for who sells said drive , or on ebay .	St
1.5.5	You might even buy a complete machine that has the drive .	St
1.5.6	You do the search ... As to ebay data recovery .	St
1.5.7	I would n't do that .	St
1.5.8	I 'd stick with the names such as Drive Savers or Ontrack .	St
1.5.9	Best of luck , Bob	Polite
