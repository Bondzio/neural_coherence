damn it, i hit the &quot;best answer&quot; button by mistake.
is there a way to retract it?
anyway, i'm not worried about the builder/seller or getting my money back if i go that route; he has an excellent reputation.
i'm not overclocking the computer, though i will look into the psu.
i really do think it's the v-card, and will be taking the suggestion to pull and reinsert the card to see if that helps.
if it doesn't, the seller and i have already agreed that we'll go with a different card and see what happens.
i will likely suggest an &quot;upgrade,&quot; though, since this card is fairly old in terms of its model age.
