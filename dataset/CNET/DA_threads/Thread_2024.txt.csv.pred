1.1.1	Hello everyone, I was wondering if anyone can help me.	St
1.1.2	I have a Linksys Wireless G Broadband Router, model No WRT54G.	St
1.1.3	The router's red Diag light stays always red.	St
1.1.4	I went into the Linksys technical support for help and followed the instructions on how to fix the problem on the page: http://linksys.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/linksys.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=175&p_created=1084205858&p_sid=t6pJvP8i&p_accessibility=0&p_lva=&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9MyZwX3Byb2RzPTEsMjAsMzI2JnBfY2F0cz0mcF9wdj0zLjMyNiZwX2N2PSZwX3NlYXJjaF90eXBlPWFuc3dlcnMuc2VhcmNoX25sJnBfc2NmX2xhbmc9MSZwX3BhZ2U9MSZwX3NlYXJjaF90ZXh0PWRpYWc*&p_li=&p_topview=1 I got as far as testing the communication between the Router and the network card.	St
1.1.5	It seems that the router established a connection but when I test the communication with ping 192.168.1.1 it say Request timed out... Could anyone please advise me on what to do?	St
1.1.6	Thank you, any help is greatly appreciated!	Polite
1.2.1	connected properly on the correct port?	St
1.3.1	Good day, Regarding w/ your concern sir mataharimata, if the red diag light lit-up and always stays red, it means that it may be have a software or hardware failure on the unit.	St
1.3.2	The only way to troubleshoot the device is just to reset it twice for 20-30secs.	St
1.3.3	after that try to ping the routers ip addr.	St
1.3.4	w/c is 192.168.1.1.	St
1.3.5	If it still getting a request time out pinging the rotuers ip addr.	St
1.3.6	try usign another pc to ping the router.	St
1.3.7	Once youve done all this troubleshooting steps and still unable to ping or get replys pinging the routers ip addr.	St
1.3.8	it only means that the router is deffective or theres already a hardware failure on it.	St
1.3.9	(I hope this may help you.)	St
1.3.10	Thanks and have a productive day ahead.	St
1.4.1	I've heard that sometimes the solid red Diag light is due to a weak or malfunctioning AC adaptor.	St
1.4.2	Make sure that the replacement has the same ratings and polarity.	St
1.4.3	For the WRT54g, DC output is +5.0V 2.0A, inside positive, outside negative.	St
1.4.4	Good luck.	St
1.5.1	Weve got it sorted out, please check: http://aumha.net/viewtopic.php?p=116212#116212 Thanks for all the help	St
