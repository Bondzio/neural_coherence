1.1.1	I just installed a Radeon 9250 PCI stealth video card , with 256 megs of memory .	St
1.1.2	To my surprise , it does not seem to display video any faster than the Intel video that is built into the motherboard .	St
1.1.3	Other owners have commented on increased redraw speed but I can not tell any difference .	St
1.1.4	I have downloaded and installed the latest ATI drivers .	St
1.1.5	I run a pretty standard clone computer with an intel 845g chipset , 512 megs of ram , XP home edition and a 1.8 ghz processor .	St
1.1.6	Is there some configuration utility or method that I am missing to kick this card into high gear ?	Ques
1.2.1	PCI eXpress ?	Ques
1.2.2	If yes , the PCI bus runs at half the speed or less than the AGP bus and is not a dedicated bus .	St
1.2.3	It is shared with other PCI cards .	St
1.2.4	However , I dfo know that ATI drivers can be a bear to install properly .	St
1.3.1	Sometimes there is only so much one can do to improve older computers .	St
1.3.2	In what program/game do you wish to improve redraw speed ?	Ques
1.4.1	nowadays , video cards only differentiate themselves by how well they handle 3D games ( Doom , Half Life 2 , Call of Duty , Splinter Cell , Oblivion , etc . ) .	St
1.4.2	Outside of gaming , your integrated intel graphics are just as good as any other video card .	St
1.5.1	Thanks very much for the help .	St
1.5.2	This card fits into a regular PCI slot , so I suppose it can only work as well as PCI allows .	St
