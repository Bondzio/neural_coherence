[Dell Support suggested and walked me through the process.] The Epson Perfection 4490 Photo Scanner worked fine on my Dell Latitude D820 laptop (using Windows XP Professional). It even worked on the Vostro that originally came with Vista Business installed. After the Vista reinstall, I reinstalled the Epson and the system crashed soon after, came back with a lengthy Microsoft error message about a USB driver problem, and offered corrective suggestions. One of these was to disconnect any recently installed USB device(s). I unplugged the USB, while leaving the Epson program files installed. End of USB driver problem. So it seems I need to download new driver(s) for using the Epson 4490 with Vista Yes? Whats the step-by-step procedure here please? Do I leave (1) the Epson program files installed, (2) download the latest driver(s) from Epson, (3) reconnect the Epson USB cable, and (4) reboot? Or do I uninstall everything Epson 4490 first and start for scratch? If so, at one point do the new drivers come into play? Sorry but Ive never had to update XP Pro-era hardware (or software) with updated drivers for a new operating system. BTW, Ive also heard that Epsons 4490 drivers can be problematic with Vista i.e. they dont always work. ?? Thanks, shamrock838

There is NEVER a step by step procedure for each machine from what I can tell. Only guides. And there must be thousands out there making a fine living installing Windows. What I would do is to recreate the machine just like Dell delivered. Use dell's restore media and all their CDs supplied or ordered from Dell. I do know some try the &quot;CLEAN INSTALL&quot; or want that but I find many just get upset over the days and weeks of efforts to do that. Bob

With the &quot;Drivers and Utilities&quot; CD he followed a set procedure of which drivers to reinstall when. I'm assuming he knew what he was doing. So -- per my original post -- where might this leave me re the Epson driver(s) and how to install them? Thanks.

If that fails, it's time to decide if a new scanner which you can ask for install support is the cheap exit. Any shop counter will run more than a replacement scanner. Bob

I never did the original Vista install, nor would I even have attempted doing so. At first I was torn between staying with XP Pro and advancing to Vista. I finally went with new technology rather than old. Perhaps my last resort should be to contact Epson directly re this matter. Thanks.

I printed out this Microsofr message that's entitled &quot;Problem Caused by USB Driver.&quot; It's four pages long and I can e-mail a photocopy to you if interested. Alternately, I did I Print Screen of the first page into a Word .doc file. If this forum allows attachments, I can send it that way. Thanks.

That is NOT the only KB article they have on this problem. Dell and MS however should get you moving. In closing, be sure to use the rear USB ports if on a desktop machine to avoid another issue. Bob

Why are rear ports to be preferred over their front counterparts? And what if I need additional USB ports? I've heard conflicting reports about external USB hubs. Thanks.

It has to do with the wiring used. For years I've encountered issues with front ports. To avoid this I use the rear ports when there is trouble. Sorry but it's late so I'll stop here and not answer why the industry is in a fine mess. Bob
