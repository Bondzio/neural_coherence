Someone on the forum recommended this external enclosure: Adaptec ACS-100 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007M3PGC/sr=1-2/qid=1137032143/ref=sr_1_2/002-6292154-7416067?%5Fencoding=UTF8 The reviews say that users are having problems with win2k.
Are these problems related to NTFS vs. FAT32 issues?
I ask because I was looking through other posts for enclosure recommendations.
