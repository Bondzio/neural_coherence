i built up a good quality sound system over many years.
i use it to play music (mostly from cd's, though i can play mp3 files etc through it also).
i play the sound from my tv through my hifi system and i am very satisfied with the quality (even though it's not 'surround sound').
my computer is in another room quite a long distance from my entertainment centre.
i sometimes use the computer to play music when i'm in this other room.
i can see no good reason for combining the two.
