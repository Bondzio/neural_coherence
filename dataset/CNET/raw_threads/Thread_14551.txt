Now every time I turn on the PC, there's just an eMachines logo, a black screen and the missing/corrupt message. I have the eMachines recovery CD but the PC doesn't read it. I popped it in and out but my PC doesn't seems to recognize the disk. It keeps asking me to re-install a copy of the missing/corrupt file but I can't do so without it reading the Recovery CD. It also didn't allow me to type in any commands. When asked to re-install ntoskrnl.exe, if I press any key, the PC would just reboot and then return to the error message. I also tried pressing F11 or R and it activates a Recovery Program. It gives me 2 options, to either format or back up the whole thing. I can only mouse-click this so again, no command can be typed in. No matter what I choose, the PC would just shut down every 4-5 minutes. I've tried this more than 20 times and every single time, the PC would just shut down in the middle of formatting or backing up. It displayed a blue screen saying that it needs to shut down to prevent damage. There's also a string of number, I forgot to write it down but i think it was 0x00000023. So I have the Recovery CD but can't use it to fix the missing/corrupted ntoskrnl.exe. I also have access to the Recovery Program but can't do much because the computer reboot every 5 minutes. I don't know what wrong or what I should do next. Please help!

You could have different solutions here. Here is mine. PROBLEM First the corrupted file name is NTOSKRNL.EXE, which is located in C:\WINDOWS\system32\ntoskrnl.exe &lt;---- &quot;BAD FILE&quot; Windows cannot locate this file or the file is just bad. SOLUTION You need to eliminate this file a get a new one. You can do the following if you get a copy of windows XP. I can probably help you with the CD, I'm located in Dallas,TX. Let me know of your options anyways. 1. Insert Windows XP CD. 2. Reboot the computer, as the computer is starting you should see a message to press any key to boot from the CD. When you see this message press any key. 3. In the Windows XP initial menu press the R key to enter the recovery console. 4. Inside the console type expand d:\i386\ntoskrnl.ex_ c:\windows\system32 6. You will then be prompted if you wish to overwrite the file type Y and press enter to overwrite the file. 7. Type exit to reboot the computer. Hope this help.

Now it said &quot;Load needed DLLs for kernel.&quot; I googled that and found this solution &quot;expand d:\i386\hal.dl_ c:\windows\system32&quot; I typed that in, it said the file is expanded but when I restarted the PC, it would still ask for the DLL. What should I do?
