<s> I'm looking at doing a complete upgrade to my current computer (first upgrade to my PC in almost 4 years). </s>
<s> I'm not really interested in upgrading my motherboard to one that has a PCI-x16 video card slot, as I'd rather just keep the AGP supported one I currently have to save money. </s>
<s> I'm just trying to get the best parts I possibly can for an AGP based PC. </s>
<s> I'm hoping to keep my current Power Supply, Hard Drives, and Motherboard, and just get a new Video Card, Processor, and Memory. </s>
<s> I don't really have much of a budget, but want to stay around the $400 area. </s>
<s> Here are my current specs: Operating System: Windows XP Home Edition (5.1, Build 2600) Service Pack 2 (2600.xpsp_sp2_gdr.080814-1233) Motherboard: Gigabyte 7VT600-RZ (-C) Processor: AMD Athlon(tm) , MMX, 3DNow, ~1.1GHz Memory: 1024MB RAM Power Supply: TurboCase Aspire 500w Dual Fan Aluminum Power Supply (ATX-AS500W 12V) Video Card: ATI 128 Rage First I want to make sure that I get the absolute best AGP NVidia Video Card I can, the reason I'm wanting to stick with NVidia is because the last NVidia I had worked pretty well and I really enjoyed the easy navigation for the S-Video with Duel Monitors. </s>
<s> After looking around, it seems as if the best AGP one that NVidia makes is the NVidia 512MB 7950GT which only costs around $80-$100 on Ebay, which is a pretty good price. </s>
<s> So would the best AGP video card be better than a mediocre PCI-x16 card? </s>
<s> Would the best AGP video card for $100 be as good as a PCI-x16 video card for also $100? </s>
<s> Because I'm looking to spend around a maximum of $100-$150 for a video card, so for that price, if I'd get an overall better video card with an AGP than I would a PCI-x16, I'd definitely stick with just getting another AGP card, and save myself the $100-$200 on getting a whole new motherboard. </s>
<s> I don't really upgrade my system that often, as I don't use it for gaming much, and just use it for video editing, so me &quot;having to get a PCI-x16 just to stay up to date with the current models&quot; wouldn't really be important to me since I only upgrade my parts every so often. </s>
<s> As for a processor, my current motherboard supports the following processors: http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Support/Motherboard/CPUSupport_Model.aspx?ProductID=1763#anchor_os It looks like the AMD Athlon 3200 Socket A 400MHz would be the best choice out of the list, can anyone confirm this? </s>
<s> I'm hoping to get a processor that is pretty damn fast, as the one I currently have is absolutely horrible. </s>
<s> It says the 3200 runs off 2.4GHz, is that good? </s>
<s> My current is only 1.1GHz, so it seems like this one would be much faster. </s>
<s> As for memory, I definitely want as much as my motherboard can handle. </s>
<s> It supports DDR400 memory, so how would 3GB of DDR400 Memory sound? </s>
<s> Any help would be great, thanks. </s>
<s> For under your 400 buck budget we can see machines like http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=9361148&type=product&id=1218091192028 You'll get your new machine, Windows 7 upgrade and more performance than the old iron. </s>
<s> I recently had to make this same choice. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Damn, that seems like a pretty nice PC. </s>
<s> I was hesitant at first when I noticed you were recommending that I just buy a full PC (rather than replacing my current custom), but that seems like a pretty good deal to me. </s>
