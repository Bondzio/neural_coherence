I have lost track of the terms used anymore so it would help me if you could link to the fastest processor and maybe one a little slower if there is a large price difference. Thank you Gene

And about all I got from that link was I need a CPU with 512 L2 cache. (Northwood) And this is the only fast processor I could find that fits that bill. (I think) Thanks

It seems I can only use a CPU with 512 L2 cache or again do I not understand? And after googling the only CPU I could find like that over 3 gb was that board. And its too expensive I can almost get a new board and CPU for that price. Does that board require the Northwood CPU? Thanks again
