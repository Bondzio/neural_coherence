Many systems use negative pressure, meaning just the power supply is sucking hot air out of the PC. Adding case fans, etc, builds up pressure, blowing hot air out of vents. Either pay the extra or plan on buying some fans of your own, including maybe a video chip fan if there is a heat sink on it.

5643	4	59662	711928	711683	John Robie	1/24/05 11:19 PM	1.10660874E12	Configuration	Hi Terry, If you are going to go by the basics as configured in your reference, it looks good, but I have two suggestions: You need a Modem to get on the internet with dial-up. If you plan on playing all the current high end games and especially those in the future, the configuration with internal graphics even the GMA 900 will disappoint you. I suggest you get at least the Nvida GeForce 6600 PCI-Express that they list for $100 more which coincides with your motherboard. With the other specs you should be good for high tech games now and for the next several years.

Also, I have broadband so the onboard 10/100/1000 will be plenty for me. The changes i'm making to the basics include 3.2ghz processor, 256mb nVidea 6600 card, 1gb generic/Mushkin memory (haven't decided), the video cooling, downgrade to a 120gb HDD, and getting a DVD restore disk instead of keyboard/mouse.

Thus the video remains cooler.

Thanks for that reply, though honestly was a little late, and was my fault for not updating my own thread...I had gone ahead and purchased my computer with it, but have removed it for now as like any fan, it added a little bit of noise.
