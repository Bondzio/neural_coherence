1.1.1	Hi all, I'm looking to upgrade my wireless/wired network.	St
1.1.2	Basically I need: wireless N Gigabit Ethernet (4 ports) ADSL-2 gateway In one device.	St
1.1.3	Anyone know of anything?	St
1.2.1	Help!	St
1.3.1	I read your post twice and it seems you only need to go shopping, read reviews etc.	St
1.3.2	Bob	St
1.4.1	I have searched and found nothing.	St
1.4.2	However my ability to look for anything is restricted because of my workload and my hours at Uni.	St
1.4.3	Online stores are crap at determining between gigabit and regular Ethernet.	St
1.4.4	so please help me.	Sug
1.4.5	BD	St
1.5.1	What you are asking for doesn't appear to exist.	St
1.5.2	Until you remove the gigabit switch.... Bob	St
1.6.1	Oh pooness.	St
1.7.1	Why I'm going to answer NO each time is simply this.	St
1.7.2	DSL providers are giving the new customers free DSL modems with wifi routers and the 10/100 switch units.	St
1.7.3	There is no incentive to make one with gigabit switches.	St
1.7.4	However you can bet you'll get better performance if you add your own gigabit external switch.	St
1.7.5	I would not look for the product you asked for since the market is non-existent (save for you.)	St
