Another would be memory limitations as it may be that if your computer is running a bunch of other things then the game may not be able to fit all the memory it needs in RAM and cause some swapping with the hard drive that may make a game choppy.
Also there is the possibility that the system is getting too hot and so it shifts things into a slower gear to generate less heat.
There could also be compatibility issues if you are trying to play a 32 bit game on a 64 bit system possibly.
Lastly, some games could be choppy due to bugs that still haven't been worked out completely so there isn't just one answer.
