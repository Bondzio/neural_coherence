to consider.
i have found some good reviews on the 3700 around the internet.
the only concern seems to be a lack of network printer support, but that's about it.
do you think the 3700 would work good for my application, which is: 3 computers running windows 7 connected to the router via ethernet cables 2 ipods and 1 ipad using wi-fi within 50 ft 1 printer which is going to be connected to 2 computers via usb splitter also, maybe you can help me understand why, when i am paying for 1.5 mbps dsl, and the internet speed tests show that i am getting around that, does my computer show all download speeds at a max of 171 kbps (that's not why i'm replacing the router)?
my computer has a 10/100/1000 ethernet port, and the motorola 3347 has a 10/100 spec.
is there something i need to, or can do to increase my speed.
my computer is: nzxt w/windows 7 64-bit core i7 processor 12 gb ram 10/100/1000 ethernet card can you help me with this?
thank you sir.
