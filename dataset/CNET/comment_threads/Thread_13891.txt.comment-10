I asked Shirt Pocket software about this.
Here is the reply: &quot;...WD external drives do not support startup on Power PC Macs, Ed.
That's one reason we never recommend them...&quot; That is interesting and I wish I had known earlier.
Recall, however, that I actually have a WD drive that starts up my wife's iMac (Power PC, 2004 vintage).
