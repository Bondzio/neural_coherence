<s> I am looking to purchase a notebook for college. </s>
<s> I'm looking into a few offers for a solid work/gaming machine. </s>
<s> I have read reviews and looked at benchmarking tests that with the right memory (DDR400 3200?) </s>
<s> The 64 will perform better in games than a pent3.2. </s>
<s> My question. </s>
<s> Given the fact that games are always kicking up the system requirements, will the 2.2ghz speed of the 64 chip itself act as a limiting factor or should I just consider total system performance (better than 3.2ghz)? </s>
<s> You've misread all the articles. </s>
<s> Let me toss them all away with this statement. </s>
<s> -&gt; Laptops are not desktops. </s>
<s> Laptops are finely engineered units which you will not overclock or fiddle with. </s>
<s> As to the 64-bit question, I've witnessed the transition in the &quot;workstation&quot; AKA SUN computers and others from 32 to 64-bit and the changeover was much faster than anyone expected. </s>
<s> If you go with the Athlon 64, you can run XP 64 now, and the XP 32-bit SP2 will use its externsions as well. </s>
<s> If you stick with 32-bit, my best advice is to not overinvest and to think that you are buying a two year machine. </s>

<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
<s> 64-bit looks even better now. </s>
<s> Now, as for 32bit gaming. </s>
<s> No overclocking since I'm inquiring about the longevity of the actual processor. </s>
<s> Some top notch gaming laptops possess the Athlon64 processor because it seems to handle 32-bit gaming very well, easing the mem to chip bottleneck and utilizing a large on-chip mem cache. </s>
<s> Well, my question is simply this. </s>
<s> Will the limited (2.2ghz compared to 3.2ghz) chip speed Itself present a wall or is it less relevant considerig overall system performance With the AMD? </s>
<s> If you want to be truly confused, look at the GHz of the Centrino and (non-HT) P4s. </s>
<s> For rough comparisons, the Centrino at 1/2 the clock speed is as fast as the P4 at it's speed. </s>
<s> See if you can find benchmarks on this. </s>
<s> But for games, 2+GHz of any CPU and 1+GHz Centrino is usually more than ample. </s>
<s> The real bottlenecks are the video card and possibly the hard disk. </s>
