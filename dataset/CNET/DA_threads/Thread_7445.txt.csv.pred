1.1.1	On a Dell vostro 200 desktop computer that is less than two years old, the O/S [Windows XP Home] boots up to the sign on screen but at this time both the mouse and keyboard are inoperative.	St
1.1.2	Both the mouse and keyboard are USB devices.	St
1.1.3	This model pc does not have PS2 connections.	St
1.1.4	Neither mouse nor keyboard will work when booting up in SAFE MODE either.	St
1.1.5	Suspect corruption to critical file due to infestation of virus.	St
1.1.6	I am unable to determine specific files needing scrutiny.	St
1.1.7	I am able to boot the system up in the Recovery Console mode.	St
1.1.8	I also was able to inert a different hard drive and install the same O/S successfully.	St
1.1.9	I then returned the defective O/S drive to the PC and was able to scan it for viruses.	St
1.1.10	Found multiple viruses and successfully removed.	St
1.1.11	Removing the new drive and returning the original hard drive to the PC, I still get freezing at sign on screen.	St
1.1.12	The desire is to enable the original hard drive capable of booting up due to applications on that specific drive not available on second drive.	St
1.2.1	try connecting your USB devices: mouse and keyboard at the back of your computer (the USB port built in with the motherboard) not the USB ports that are extended and housed in you casing.	Sug
1.2.2	If the USB port on the motherboard works, then that means the connection of the extension USB ports that are located on your casing may have been loose or disconnected.	St
1.2.3	If it still doesn't work then it's either your mouse and keyboard is deffective or your motherboard needs replacement.	St
1.2.4	To be able to take care of your PC components, you must understand them well.	St
1.2.5	Here is a link that you may find helpful: http://www.motherboardsata.com/	St
1.3.1	Thanks for responding to my post.	St
1.3.2	Perhaps I did not make myself clear.	St
1.3.3	I replaced the original hard drive with an identical one [same manufacturer, same size, same model] and I installed the same O/S.	St
1.3.4	everything worked.	St
1.3.5	When I removed the new drive and replaced the old drive, the problem shows up.	St
1.3.6	There is nothing wrong with the motherboard, USB ports, mouse or keyboard.	St
1.3.7	The problem exists within the O/S for the original hard drive.	St
1.3.8	I do not want to reinstall the O/S to the original drive because I will then loose critical files.	St
1.3.9	I need to be able to find the problem with the original drive's O/S and repair withiut having to reformat it.	St
1.4.1	That's called an advanced Windows repair.	St
1.4.2	If we are lucky to catch it soon enough we can use System Restore.	St
1.4.3	If we let it go we know we can try the usuals like &quot;XP REPAIR INSTALL&quot; as well as installing the drivers for the machine in the CORRECT ORDER.	Sug
1.4.4	I find many still can't write down the right order.	St
1.4.5	Since I clone the OS to another drive I can test this on the copy without endangering the original.	St
1.4.6	Bob PS.	St
1.4.7	For a price, Dell or Microsoft can provide more support about this than you may find on forums.	St
1.5.1	You should run the virus scanner again in safe mode with networking option.	St
1.5.2	That way, you're able to access CD/USB drives with pgms., of course update the scanner with the latest.	St
1.5.3	Next, if you haven't already, reboot after that.	St
1.5.4	if it works, great if not, do you still have &quot;restore feature-ON?	St
1.5.5	In many cases, if you tried the restore feature to working date and any malware comes back, disable restore feature(will delete restore points) to remove the &quot;rehatching area of malware&quot;, very common.	St
1.5.6	Repeat the scan process and then reboot.	St
1.5.7	If you can enter the OS, use the SFC command from run, otherwise you're stuck in trying a OS repair from the OS recovery(install) discs.	St
1.5.8	You may had multiple problems and get stuck resolving more than meets the eye, so it gets time involved.	St
1.5.9	If you like, remove old HD and try recovering critical data on another system if malware free.	St
1.5.10	If successful, then reformat old HD for re-use.	St
1.5.11	IMHO, you have no easy answer.	St
1.5.12	tada -----Willy	St
1.6.1	Go to DELL,and download the manual.	St
1.6.2	Look on Pg 180 on how to remove the password.	St
1.6.3	That might help, as you said it was stopping on &quot;the sign on screen&quot;.	St
1.6.4	It's a simple jumper, but you need to follow the procedure.	St
