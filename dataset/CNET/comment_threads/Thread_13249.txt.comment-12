I have a computer with Windows XP.
On line system is thru cable broadband and AOL.
Also hooked up to a Linksys Wireless-G Broadband Router.
The printer is a HP Desk Jet 932C.
The other Computer is hooked up to Linksys Wireless-G Ntework Adapter with Windows Me.
I am able to get on line thru both computers.
The computer with windows XP and connected printer work fine.
I have gone thru the steps outlined on another site for sharing printers but cannot get the Me computer to print to the printer attached to the xp computer.
I would appreciate any help you can give me.
