i have three network connections listed.
1.)
1394 connection &quot;disabled, firewalled&quot; 1394 net adaptor 2.)
local area connection &quot;disabled, firewalled&quot; national semiconductor dp83815-based pci fast ethernet adaptor 3.)
wireless network connection 9 &quot;connected, firewalled&quot; netgear wg111v2 54mps wireless usb 2.0 adaptor #10 when i click to disable in the menu,&quot;disable&quot; is not in bold text like the rest of the options.
so what your telling me is the windows wireless connection (no.
3 above) is the one that is messing up the netgear wireless software that's not even listed in the networks connections tray?
thanks so very much for your help on this and i look forward to your future replys.
