answers embedded with ***: you have stated that you increased the count of ip addresses the dhcp server can assign.
in the admin page for the router, what is the starting ip address for the dhcp server?
xxx.xxx.xxx.150 or xxx.xxx.xxx.101 or other?
***starting address is 192.168.1.100. with number of addresses set to 100, the router gives me a range of 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.199.
*** what is the subnet mask on the 101 computer?
255.255.255.0 ?
***the _router's_ subset mask is indeed 255.255.255.0. i looked under properties of the wireless connection on the computers, but can't find where any subset mask is called out here.
*** do you get any error message when you enter ''ipconfig /renew'' command?
***you've got me there.
where would i enter this command?
start/run?
if i click on ''repair'' under wireless/properties, the computer turns off the usb adapter, turns it back on and waits for a new ip assignment.
i suppose this is the same thing?
if so, this computer still gets the x.x.x.151, and my wife's computer gets the x.x.x.101.
*** static ip addresses shoudn't be a problem for the router.
the router will use the static ip addresses that it discovers on the computers/network devices before it attempts to assign an ip address via dhcp.
***does this mean that i would simply assign sequential ips under properties of my wireless connection?
there seem multiple ways to do this, either under the general tab or the alternate configuration tab.
these also want a subset mask specified and call for things like a default gateway and preferred and alternate dns servers.
this is all a bit beyond me.
however, if i was able to assign these manually, would i then disable the router's local dhcp server?
would this give me any security advantage over auto-dhcp?
*** many thanks for all your help.
