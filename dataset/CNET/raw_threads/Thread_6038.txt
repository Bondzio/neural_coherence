Basically we're replaced everything in both computers in less than a year and they still reboot and have numerous stop errors...You have to keep calling them before your warantee expires or you will be stuck with a piece of junk...sorry.

The problem was using a USB connection to the cable modem instead of network cable. I used a Belkin network cable between the CPU and the cable modem and the problem was instantly solved. I was rather mad that only 1 tech out of 5 had the answer to the problem. ShopNBC uses their ''layers of support'' as a selling point, but the support is pretty bad. After upgrading the IGP (yuck) video to a GeoForce FX 5500, and replacing the 512 mb of PC2700 RAM with 1 gig of PC3200 RAM, the computer is running very, very well.

What I found was a &quot;250W&quot; power supply for a P4 2.8 processor CDRW,DVD,Card Reader, etc. The box also had problems powering up.... Had to push the on button serveral times and cross fingers to get it to turn on. When I replaced the power supply fan that apparently put it over the top! Once powered on it would make it to the XP Logo Screen and then power itself back off. I replaced the power supply with a larger 500w (don't need one that big but I had one on the shelf) and both the booting and power switch problems disappeared. Looks to me like a box sold with bells and whistles but skimpy/cheap components inside. Reminded me of an eMachine I worked on once.....

The guy before that said two of the machines at his work are crap was right, but only because the power supplies, or non supplies as the case is, are the most unstable pieces of junk you could plug into a board. The reason those computers are plagued with problems is because they're underpowered, and what power the unit is suppling is so dirty the board doesn't know if it should boot or just crumple into a smoldering heap. Components are extremely susceptable to damage from fluxuations in the voltage rails from a bad PSU. SWAP IT. IT's not difficult if you want to do it yourself, just mark the connectors of the old one as to where they cam out of on the board, match them with the connectors on the new unit and plug them in. With PSU connectors, if it fits there, that's where it goes.
