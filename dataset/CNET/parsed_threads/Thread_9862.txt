<s> I need a recommendation for a good home networking solution for 2 computers: one computer running Windows XP home edition the other an older model Windows 2000. </s>
<s> My ISP DSL provider is Verizon so in their website they recommend a Linksys Wireless Router and a Linksys Wireless USB adapter using 802.11 b wireless technology for your home network. </s>
<s> Let say in short that installation was a nightmare with long calls to tech support, but at the end everything was running, I web browsing and checking emails my daughter playing internet base games, then I got bite by the game bug buying Guild Wars a massive multi player online game. </s>
<s> Then a month ago my network started crashing first once or twice a week now almost daily made the calls to tech support both the ISP and Linksys they run me like a circus monkey, changing settings, disconnecting both modem and router rebooting my computer to get the network back up. </s>
<s> Now I can connect the modem directly to my computer and every thing is working fine connect the network and is unstable at best, I am unhappy with this arrangement so please help. </s>
<s> What is the model number of the router and of the adapter(s)? </s>
<s> Where you eventually need to go is to Linksys.com in order to download the latest version of firmware for your router and driver for your adapter(s). </s>
<s> Router BEFW11S4 and adapter is WUSB11 and yes already done firmware update </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> What do you mean by ''unstable?'' </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Just to clarify what you are saying--is it ''unstable'' using the wired connection, the wireless connection, or both? </s>
<s> I don't use that one. </s>
<s> It was just too flighty. </s>
<s> I did update the firmeware to the BEFW11S4 and it worked great. </s>
<s> My dad's router died so I shipped him my BEF and now have some dlink 524 router (which I also got to update the firmware.) </s>
<s> Here's the recap: 1. </s>
<s> Latest firmware for the BEFW11S4 or don't complain. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Consider the WUSB11 may be not that great with your selected OS or system. </s>
<s> If latest firmware and drivers don't make it work, then toss it. </s>
<s> Remember to get it all working without firewalls or WEP before you turn on the security. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> That one moment everything is working fine,then the network crashes disconnet modem and router reboot computer, then reconnect network is up then 10 minutes later down again to me that is unstable </s>
<s> At this point, I like R. Proffitt's thinking. </s>
<s> Toss the hardware and go with wireless-g. </s>
<s> It's newer and better technology--much more reliable in my experience. </s>
<s> Hey, if the equipment is still under warranty, try to return it for credit towards a wireless-g model. </s>
