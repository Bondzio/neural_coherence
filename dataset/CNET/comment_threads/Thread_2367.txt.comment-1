Hi I am interested in purchasing a netbook.
I am a medical professional that travels overseas often to give presentations on various topics.
Would a netbook be powerful enough to run Microsoft Powerpoint?
Would the connection be compatible with every projector?
Are there any netbook specifications (amount of RAM\CPU etc) that would be optimal for my needs?
Are there any specific netbooks that you can recommend?
Thanks Rael
