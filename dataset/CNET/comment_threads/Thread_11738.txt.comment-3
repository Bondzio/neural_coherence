Well Willy, You were being a bit nit-picky to have that answer.
And it's obvious you have not shopped at Costco.
They stand behind their products even when they were out of warranty.
Many of our friends, as well as myself, have taken things back that were way out of warranty and THEY COVERED THEM FULLY.
Go back under your rock and quit picking on people on the message boards just because you have too much time on your hands.
Your response was annoying and not at all helpful.
I wanted monitor information, not your snippy remarks.
