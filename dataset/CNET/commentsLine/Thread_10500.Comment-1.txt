hello, i would like to play stereo music (and other) files using 5.1 surround logitech speakers with 3 rca inputs on my computer.
the logitechs do have a &quot;matrix&quot; setting for creating a 5.1 simulation but i would like a better way to convert the 2 channel to surround sound.
i have a creative live!
(only has four channel output #4830) card with a &quot;digital output&quot; that claims it is 5.1 but i do not have a way to convert the digital output to rca for the speakers.
i also have an audigy 4 sound card but i can find no information on how to convert 2 channel to 5.1. i believe the best way is to use a sound card that has dolby pro logic (ii or iix) or dts with speaker rca outputs.
the only sound card i can find using google is the asus xonar that uses dolby pro-logic iix.
at about $80 it is a little pricey.
the auzen x-meridian (at about $150) also uses dolby pro-logic iix.
turtle beach claims their $30 rivera and montego will &quot;convert stereo to surround sound&quot; but doesn't say how it does it or if it true 5.1. will these cards work for me?
what is the best and least expensive pci or pci-e sound card that will convert 2 channel sound files into 5.1 (either dolby encoded or dts) that allows me to use my logitech 5.1 system with rca connectors?
thanks, sporty
