<s> Hey Guys, My 250 GB Hard drive looks like it's nearly running out of space and I figured I would go out and buy a new one. </s>
<s> The thing is I'm split between internal and external. </s>
<s> I have a relatively fast desktop computer with 3 SATA 2 connectors, so internal sounds like a clean, invisible fit. </s>
<s> However, They aren't portable. </s>
<s> What I wanted to know was which one had better seek time? </s>
<s> Durability? </s>
<s> And similar pros and cons of each. </s>
<s> Another thing that I wanted to know about was RAID. </s>
<s> Will RAID enable both of my hard drives to work as one? </s>
<s> And are there different types of RAID or does every motherboard have the same compatibility? </s>
<s> My last question was that some of the external hard drives that I've seen had RJ-45 connectors on them. </s>
<s> This would be really handy because I'm planning on buying a laptop soon and this would be handy! </s>
<s> But do you guys recommend this over networking my router? </s>
<s> Any other info or personal details will really be appreciated too! </s>
<s> Thanks In Advance! </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> Because I bought an external USB 2.0 case and used my selection of drives. </s>
<s> Parting hint: They don't use different model drives in those ready to use externals than what you find internally. </s>
<s> The downside to external is the transfer speed is slower. </s>
<s> Yes someone will note ESATA, but many fail to get it to work. </s>
