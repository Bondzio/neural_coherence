<s> I've been reading through the forums today, and there are a lot of threads asking for opinions. </s>
<s> It's been great except that nobody seems to want the same tablets I do. </s>
<s> I'm at a crossroads. </s>
<s> I'm going to be using my tablet for reading, web browsing, occasional gaming, some movies, and development. </s>
<s> My battle is between the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and the Google Nexus 10. </s>
<s> I'm drawn to the stylus feature of the Note, but I've also heard it's buggy at times. </s>
<s> On the flip side I'm really drawn to the screen quality of the Nexus 10. </s>
<s> I'm also a big fan of having the direct Google connection to OS updates first. </s>
<s> If you who are reading this were posed this question, which tablet would you choose? </s>
<s> So far to develop apps for the Android units you listed you get a PC or maybe some Apple/Linux/Windows PC. </s>
<s> I have many of the models at the office but folk are sometimes mistaking these as a PC replacement. </s>

<s> I have a 'Christmas New' Nexus 7 and as far as I can tell, there is very little straying away(development) from the apps you are premitted to download to these. </s>
<s> Many are excellent applications but very territorial(exclusive to the brand) and sometimes not the program I want to use for my need at the time on my tablet. </s>
<s> I would refer to this non-freedom as the 'Net Nanny'. </s>
<s> I am going to post to see if there is a way to take this 'governor' completely off of the tablet......or at least tamp it down a little. </s>
<s> Very annoying. </s>
<s> I do like the 7&quot; tablet as it fits my hand better than the larger size. </s>
<s> If you have specialized programs(applications) or loyalty programs you like to use or must use, I would go with a netbook. </s>
<s> I have the google nexus 7 and installed FireFox Beta along with Flash to get more capability. </s>
<s> This was well documented how to allow such to install and I'm guessing you are alluding that such is not allowed with some Net Nanny. </s>
<s> &quot;Net Nanny&quot; is something of a parental control system but here I'm left to guess you need to know how to allow third party apps. </s>
