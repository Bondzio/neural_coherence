So your Modem is a Cable Gateway?
You didn't state what make, model modem you are linking to.
A Cable Gateway is a Modem/Router combination, some are wireless.
If it is a wireless gateway you wouldn't need to link to another router.
If it is a hardwire gateway I'd swap it out to a stand alone cable modem, something like a Motorola Surfboard and if the hardwired systems are all Gigabit ready I'd swap cables from Cat-5 to Cat-6 for better throughput potential.
