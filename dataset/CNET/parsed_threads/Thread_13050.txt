<s> I have a decision to make soon, in fact before my grandson comes up for the summer. </s>
<s> Right now I do alot of genealogy, some desk publishing (business cards and Brochures for my small business), manipulate photos with photoshop 5.5. </s>
<s> I have a Toshiba Laptop 1805 and it does the job, except I have to hook up a cd burner whenever I want to cut a cd. </s>
<s> I am set up wireless with a 5mb line from Charter Cable. </s>
<s> The Toshiba is getting old, had to reload it twice since xmas, but I like XP because this is easy to do. </s>
<s> Now for the problems: 1. </s>
<s> I am a former main-frame programmer, who is frustrated by PC's and all the choices you have to make. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I kind of like to sit on my couch and multi-task while working on the internet. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> My grandson is coming up for a few months, and since he can't bring his PS/3, he wants to play that WOW game here. </s>
<s> QUESTION: Do I really need to get a desktop to satisfy both our needs? </s>
<s> And which machine would you suggest? </s>
<s> I talked to Dell because I used to have one, and like the onsite repair they offer. </s>
<s> He recommended a laptop, something about XPS, or 1505 for about $1300 + and a desktop for a few hundred dollars less. </s>
<s> I really hate to spend that much at this time, any ideas. </s>
<s> My daughter in Texas bought a emachine at Comp USA for a few hundred dollars, and is going to add wireless card, new video card and more memory or RAM, since I am not that technically inclined and live in a small town in MI, I am not that adventurous . </s>
<s> Appreciate any ideas or suggestions, JQ </s>
<s> doing on the PC.....any specific games ? </s>
<s> No techie friends ? </s>

<s> a laptop with P-3 that's about 5 yrs old, lacking all the bells/whistle that a modern one does. </s>
<s> OK. A modern laptop has built-in all the features you, not your grandson, currently use and some models even exceed them. </s>
<s> Gaming on a laptop is definitely possible but not for lower powered models. </s>
<s> Generally, a gaming machine requires fast graphics which in turn consume more power and runs hotter and drain batteries faster when not on AC power. </s>
<s> You could buy such a laptop for $1500-$2000 but you may be better off getting both a lower priced laptop for your use and a desktop for gaming. </s>
<s> Go to a Best Buy or Circuit City or CompUSA and check the selections. </s>
<s> Or get from Dell. </s>
<s> The major brands generally have good support, in spite of occasional lapses. </s>
<s> How about this: get a laptop now and when your grandson arrives, have him play his game to see if it's good enough; if not you can walk into the store and pick up a powerful enough desktop at a moment's notice. </s>
<s> Have fun shopping! </s>
<s> Grandson is 15 and he was playing some game I think was called WOW. </s>
<s> something about the war. </s>
<s> He was playing against his friend ? </s>
<s> I would say get a portable computer a XPS system is not needed if you want to go Dell one of there inpiron systems would do nicely. </s>
<s> They tend to be a bit lower end and a bit less expensive. </s>
<s> If all you Granson would be playing is wow then any of todays systems should be fine. </s>
<s> Reason why I say portable is because you like to sit at the couch and and be on the computer. </s>
<s> Thanks for the response - it makes sense to me. </s>
<s> I will send him a copy, Janet </s>
