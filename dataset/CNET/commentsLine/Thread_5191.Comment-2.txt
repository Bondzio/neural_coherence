check the wireless symbol in system notication area for a status like &quot;limited or no connectivity&quot;.
the symbol changes also.
that has nothing to do with the signal strength, but everything with not being given an ip-address by the wireless dhcp-server.
you can check that with ipconfig or, usually, on the router management page.
the usual cause is a non-matching encryption mode or encryption key or the mac-address not passing the mac-filtering on the router.
hope this helps.
