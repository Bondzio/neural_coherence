1.4.1	if you like the 1280x800 and there is n't any setting that 's closer to 1600x900 that you might like then I would just ignore the error message .	St
1.5.1	Their is 1600x900 setting present and when i choose that setting not windows but my moniter says that not optimum resolution it is an error message given by moniter not by system	St
1.6.1	If it does , try installing the driver to the computer and see what happen .	St
1.6.2	I am just guessing here because I have not run into problem such as yours , I have 2 such monitors also but not Samsung though .	St
