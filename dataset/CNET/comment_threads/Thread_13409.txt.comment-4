You can't know who did it but the path to setting it right is not to post about it all over the internet (unless that's just to vent.)
This is a simple issue of theft.
If the store won't take the return then it's again a simple issue of theft and you make the police report and proceed to small claims.
A lot of trouble but I hope that your goals are to get what you paid for.
Sometimes I find folk just want to rant.
