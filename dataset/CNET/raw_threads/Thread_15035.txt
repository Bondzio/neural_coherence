I have 802.11g in both and have followed the networking instructions in the apple help files to the letter for both computers. I have tried connection via WiFi and ethernet. The problem seems to be that the computers fail to see each other although sometimes I manage to get the apple finder/network screen to display the PCs work group name (not consistently however and never shows &quot;shared documents&quot; from the PC as I have been told it should ). Apple network utilities fails to ping the PC. Any ideas ? Thanks in advance grim 1.2 Mghz iBook running OS 10.3.9 Athlon 64 3200+ 939 socket / Windows XP with sp 2 preloaded on a brand new emachine (I needed a PC for a college class)
