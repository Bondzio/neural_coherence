1.1.1	Hi, Looking for advice on graphics card before I waste my money.	St
1.1.2	My sytem spec is E6600 duo processor(2.40ghz,4mb cache,1066mhz) asus P5N32 -E sli nForce 680i motherboard & 2048mb ddr2 533mhz memory.	St
1.1.3	I currently have a 256mb nVidia geforce 7600gs pci- express card, my question is would I be better off buying another 256mb 7600gs and running 2 or a 512mb version of above,and in time adding another.	St
1.1.4	Will I see much difference between a 256 & a 512 or am I better of buying a single 8 series of some description ?	Ques
1.1.5	(I have about 100-150 to spend) any advice would be appreciated.	St
1.2.1	In reading http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/06/11/the_best_gaming_video_cards_for_the_money/ I find the 7600 to have a weak position on the last chart.	St
1.2.2	I'd see how far up that list you could go.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	a 7900gs for 120 will definitely outperform dual 7600gs and a 8600gts.	St
1.3.2	the 8600gts will be a bit more expensive and will have dx10 support but will be a bit slower than the 7900gs but a smidge faster than dual 7600gs.	St
1.3.3	and you won't have to deal with any sli-issues with either of these cards.	St
1.3.4	512mb won't help the performance of a 7600gs that much so unless its 'free' stick with 256mb if you plan to go sli.	St
