Methinks you are on your own in this circumstance.

That is what we call Network Attached Storage, or NAS shortly. So, if your external can be connected to the router, you already have NAS. And if it doesn't it won't work. But I see the Nexus 7 has a USB-port. And most externals I know (unless they are Firewire of e-SCSI) can connect via USB. So why do you think you need a router? Kees

What I gleaned from the original post was to be able utilize the available on campus service which unless I am mistaken would require hacking into the server. On many college campuses doing this is unacceptable because of security restraints and tight internet use policies when using their system(s).

And the same method would work in friends rooms and, in fact, all over the campus.That extra cable is a little bit clumsy indeed when walking or on bicycle, but not being able to watch video then might be a minor nuisance.
