No, it does not work in copy DVD.
The burned DVD disc has changed to the CD format.
So it is not readable by any DVD player or DVD ROM.
I beleive the DVD drive has been defective.
I tested by a new external DVD drive.
It works.
I just do not understand why the defective still can copy CD or DVD into the hard drive and why burned DVD disc has changed to the CD drive in my computer.
The burned DVD disc is supposed to be DVD drive, right?
