it currently has athelon x2 5000+.
but it supports 8gb of memory so i somewhat have a hard time believing athelon is it.
i'm thinking phenom x 4?
maby i could contact a different part of acer.
i emailed help with the question but the response seemed to be from a scripted & & typed by someone with little grasp of the english language completely ignoring my request for above question.
possibly pay support if i can't get a definitive answer.
