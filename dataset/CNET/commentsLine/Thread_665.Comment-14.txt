no cell is not an embed it is a microprocessor that's why i asked if it was available for purchase.
therefore i could buy the processor and then the corresponding socket motherboard, to build a pc.
and yes the cell processor is a power risc platform, not x86.
but i am able to get windows to run on risc without any problem that is why i am curious.
