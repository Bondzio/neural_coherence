I've been using a Linksys wireless g broadband router, which works good depending on my location in the house, as good as one would expect.
I also have connected devices (PVR's) at different points in my house that are connected via the 4 ports of the router.
I recently came upon a spare wireless b access point, linksys as well, that I was planning to connect to the network through one of the cat 5s that was being used by a PVR.
Is this possible ?
I did try connecting it, and the signal is excellent in that area, but I do not have internet access with that connection.
(it's listed as a seperate possible connection point) Might it be because the 1st wireless device has WEP?
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance.
