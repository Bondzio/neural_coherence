Computer: Intel P4 3.00GHZ RAM : 1 Gig OS : Windows 2K , service pack 4 Drives : C, Memorex 52x24x52, LITEON SOHW-1673S USB Since I purchased this drive 1 month ago I have not been able to burn any DVDs from it.
However I'm able to read DVD disks without any problems.
Would someone please help me find out why I'm not able to burn DVDs from this drive?
