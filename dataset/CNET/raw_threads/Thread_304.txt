I have a linksys wrt120n connected to my cable modem at one end of the house, I have run a cat5 cable to the other end of the house, where I need to connect multiple devices, so I have a netgear wgr614 router that I will be connecting to that end of the cable, to be fed by the linksys router, question is do I configure the cat5 cable as a straight through or as a crossover cable to enable internet access from the linksys to the netgear? I know how to config the routers, but need to know whether to use a crossover or straight through?

Most routers contain a few ethernet ports so they do have something of a built-in switch. Modern switches tend to be &quot;auto-sensing&quot; so you can use either type of cable. The simple thing is just use the straight through that you mentioned rather than a crossover cable.

Anyway it is up and running perfectly and all of my devices are sharing internet connectivity now.. Thanks for your quick responses.
