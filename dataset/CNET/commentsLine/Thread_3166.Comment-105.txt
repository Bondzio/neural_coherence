don't be too concerned about the failure of a drive.
if you are using a 250gb drive and that is the extent of your need, you can for about $120.00 pick up two 500gb sata 2 drives.
mirror them, then you need not fear when the drive fails.
unless you have a dual failure, which is a one in a million shot.
if one fails simply break the mirror pair and replace the bad drive then rebuild the mirror.
