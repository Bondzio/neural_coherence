well all i want to do is use agp and pcie cards thats it not anything fancy just dont want to toss my old card since it works fine... i could care less about a mb with bult in crap i wouldnt buy anyway cause bult in meens not upgradable.
not that you cant hook a newer tv tuner into that mb.
and who knows maybe the mb will be dumb and fight the new card.
all i wanted to know was plainly this do the new generation mb still fight for video dominece between ports.
example back int he day if you had onboard video and a new vid card if you didnt disable the on board the pc tried to feed bits of into to both video sources.
so you were forced to disable onboard video.
but will 2 video cards nowadays do the same retardation or have we leaped forward from this glitch and i dont know steped forward in pc intelegence... me am just want use 2 vid cards agp/tvtuner and pcie new purdy stuff can u am answer me rationaly internet world people.
