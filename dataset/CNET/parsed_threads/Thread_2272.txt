<s> I use a wireless network at home with a linksys broadband router. </s>
<s> I would like to have wireless access to my HP 1012 LaserJet printer, which is located next to the router, but there is no PC connected. </s>
<s> We use 2 laptops and only the one printer at home. </s>
<s> I am unsure whether to use a wired print server such as D-Link DP301-U to connect the router to the printer or to get a linksys wireless print server. </s>
<s> Which would be easiest in terms of use and configuration? </s>
<s> I'm a novice at networking. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> mainly because it is physically a simpler device so there is less that can go wrong. </s>
<s> Hope this helps frank </s>
