1.1.1	I am having problems with one of my PC 's ever since I was forced to connect it to a wireless network using A D-link DWA-140 wireless USB mini adapter .	St
1.1.2	The PC is a Dell Dimension DXP051 with Intel Pentium 4 CPU 3.000GHz , 2.99 GHz and 1 GB RAM .	St
1.1.3	Network card Intel ( R ) PRO/1000 PL version 9.0.15.0 It had XP HOme Edition version 2002 SP2 + Office 2000 ( I need to keep the old Office as I work with certain software that function better and faster with the old MS Office than with newer versions , which I have on my other PC ) .	St
1.1.4	First I upgraded to SP3 and then I installed the DWA-140 USB adapter and connected to the wireless network .	St
1.1.5	As soon as I did , Word started getting hung on startup ( wo n't even open properly , hangs itself ) .	St
1.1.6	I initially thought it was a SP3 error , and tried fixes but still did n't work .	St
1.1.7	As I need Word 2000 more than the internet connection , I chose to uninstall the DWA-140 and work without the network .	St
1.1.8	However , I now need to get back on the network/internet , so I tried to roll back to SP2 , and check to see if Word worked again , and it did .	St
1.1.9	But as soon as I installed the DWA-140 the same problem occurs ...	St
1.1.10	When I click on Word , it opens but gets stuck and stops responding .	St
1.1.11	Is there anyone who can help me figure out where the problem lies ... how does the D-Link DWA-140 USB adaptor manage to screw up my OFfice programs ( and I remember some other software issues as well , but ca n't recall which ones , as this was some time last fall ) .	St
1.1.12	Anyone who can help me fix this before Monday ... am in a real jam !	St

1.3.1	Hi Bob , Thanks for the tip .	St
1.3.2	I followed the guide ( Cleanup your grungy computer ) , updated chip set and BIOS , and tried to reinstall DWA-140 but Word still hangs itself ( which it did n't 2 minutes before installing the DWA-140 ) .	St
1.3.3	I tried to follow your steps in the Event Viewer , but when I get to Control Panel - Performance and Maintenance - Administration Tools I just get a desktop.ini file - there is nothing else !	St
1.3.4	IS there something missing in my XP version ... ?	Ques
1.3.5	Any suggestions on how to restore whatever tools should be under Administration TOols ?	Ques
