1.1.1	I may need to replace a cooling fan on my computer but I have no clue what type of fan I need to get .	St
1.1.2	I know it is the processor fan and I got the part number off the fan but I can not seem to find that same fan .	St
1.1.3	I am not at all a computer wiz , but I am learning .	St
1.1.4	How do you tell what type of fan fits your computer ?	Ques
1.1.5	I have a V2 premier Pentium 4 Proc .	St
1.1.6	3.0ghz AN810 [ E ] Motherboard The cooling fan is : Foxconn dc brushless fan Model # PV702012M I hope I have given all the important info not sure what else to give .	St
1.1.7	Thank you everyone for your time	St
1.2.1	fan for your CPU .	St
1.2.2	I did n't have any luck finding the FAN you specified thru google and Intel uses many different fan configurations on their CPUs .	St
1.2.3	There are lots of places that sell the ... Newegg.com carries a bunch of them and they describe them well .	St
1.2.4	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	While you can replace the fan itself and do just fine , it appears you 're clueless as to what to get .	St
1.3.2	The fan itself is measured in & quot ; mm & quot ; so likely you want a 60mm or 80mm fan , but again I do n't what you have regardless of the info you found on your fan .	St
1.3.3	But , if you choose to , look at : http : //www.frozencpu.com/ or similar websites .	St
1.3.4	Inquire the vendor if any fan or HSF you do get is suited for your needs and any return policy ( surf abit ) .	St
1.3.5	However , you 'll do better getting a HSF ( heatsink-fan setup ) that is *RATED* for your cpu/processor installed .	St
1.3.6	So , if you have a 2.8Mhz cpu , get a HSF that 's rated for 2.8Mhz or better and physically fits the location ( in system ) as some HSF are huge and maybe limited space to install or very tight fit .	St
1.3.7	Check this website for what to expect : http : //www.tomshardware.com and locate info .	St
1.3.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	Remove the fan ... ..not the heat sink .	St
1.4.2	With fan in hand ... .visit your local mom+pop pc repair shop .	St
1.4.3	Place fan on counter and say & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; I want one of these .	St
1.4.4	With a little luck they will have something on the shelf that will work fine .	St
