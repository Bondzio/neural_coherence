<s> I have a Pluscom WU-ZD1211B USB adaptor. </s>
<s> I have disabled my in built driver and card as recommended and folowed the remainder of the set up instructions. </s>
<s> None of which has given me internet access. </s>
<s> I disabled the win zero config option and that improved matters allowing PLUSCOM to become the only connection. </s>
<s> I now have visible connection on my pluscom under station mode showing 100% signal strength link quality as 84% I have set the WEP key as per the one I use on the Router and the connection is set as ad-hoc. </s>
<s> depite allof this I still can not connect to the internet. </s>
<s> I have a solid green light on my USB connector but I can not connec to any pages. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any experience of these devices and can you advise what I've missed please? </s>
<s> Cheers Pete NB, this was submited from an independent machine.. </s>
<s> That doesn't sound right. </s>
<s> Almost every system I see is in infrastructure mode when we connect to a router. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Bob, thanks for the reply it seems strange to me also but the only way I can get a connection (wirelessly) is to use this mode. </s>
<s> If I try it in infrastructure mode I cant see any evidence of a connection at all... Any further thoughts please? </s>
<s> Cheers Pete </s>
<s> Then that's possible. </s>
