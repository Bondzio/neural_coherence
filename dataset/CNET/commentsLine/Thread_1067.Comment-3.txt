the settings interface could be better, like only a few months ago i found out that when i copied my cd's for my itouch & ipad i could do it in a higher bite rate.
the software updating is dumb, it is just mostly a new install so unlike most other programs that just install the new parts, itunes you have install the whole thing, luckily there maybe only 1-2 updates a year.
it does saves all you presets but sometimes things get lost, i have lost many songs ( not big deal since i also own the cd's) & one time all my videos got lost, just had to find the folder then import the folder, fixed.
just like everything else back it up to a usb hdd.
