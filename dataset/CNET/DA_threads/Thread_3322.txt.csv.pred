1.1.1	i have a WD1200JB , C drive and a 40gig D , problem is local properties shows only 40G in the C , so i ca n't access the balance , although the proper recognition is shown in & quot ; hardware & quot ; ... is there a fix ?	Ques
1.2.1	To me it appears you want to run the Disk Management tool in Windows XP and use that space for another drive by making the remainder space a partition and formatting that new space .	St
1.2.2	Unless you think there is a hardware issue here I 'd just prepare the unused space and start using it .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	look under DISK MANAGEMENT and see if you see 'unallocated space ' on drive 0 .	St
1.3.2	The fix ... you could create a new partition in the unallocated space , wipe drive 0 and start all over creating the partitions or buy a product like Partition Magic or Disk Director which would allow you to 'expand ' drive C to the full capacity .	St
1.3.3	The options are endless ... these are the probably the most common .	St
1.3.4	Should you choose using PM or DD ... you should backup your data to minimize the risk of data loss .	St
1.3.5	VAPCMD	St
