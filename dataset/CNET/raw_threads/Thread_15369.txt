After hours of installing, uninstalling drivers I've run out of ideas trying to get the printer connected. After a re-boot, if I print a test page, it turns the printer on, but never prints the document. Anyone have any experience with this printer on a USB port, workcentre xd130df? Anyone have any ideas how I can connect to this printer with the laptop? Print Server have a better shot? Thanks in advance. Dell Vostro 1500 XP Home

It worked but I don't have your printer. http://www.netgear.com/Products/PrintServers/WiredPrintServers/PS101.aspx is another thought. Try other parallel adapters. And finally a parallel port for your laptop? http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16839158008 Bob
