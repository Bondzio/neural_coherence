I am not sure if you still need this help, but someone might.
I had a simular problem, but i fixed it with a setting change on the router.
I just reduced the speed of the router to something more resonable, like 11Mbps.
This shouldn't affect any speed across the internet since most dsl speeds don't go over 11Mbps.
