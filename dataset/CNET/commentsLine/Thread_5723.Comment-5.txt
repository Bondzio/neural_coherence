you obviously know more than i do.
but i just want to make this midi keyboard to work.
i don't have a picture with me right now.
but if i remembered it clearly, it has a game port /joystick port output, then a midi in or out which i kind of forgot.
it only has one midi outlet.
so what should i get?
the regular game port converter or are you saying that i can get a midi coverter in order to play this keyboard on my current computer?
