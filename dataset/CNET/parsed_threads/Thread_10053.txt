<s> i recently spoke with someone with experience in computers who told me that installing a new cpu is a &quot; piece of cake.&quot; she said i should buy a kit that includes a fan and not just the cpu itself. </s>
<s> she also said that many cpu kits come with the heatsink already attached and with the thermal paste already applied, and that all i would have to do is to peel off a sticker on the bottom of the cpu and install it. </s>
<s> i would not necessarily need to remove the mobo in order to do this if the cpu could be gently inserted into the socket. </s>
<s> if true, this does sound easy. </s>
<s> by the way, i am thinking of upgrading to a 64x2 amd socket 939. true or false? </s>
<s> a heatsink fan and a 3 year nfg warranty. </s>
<s> OEM CPUs have only a 30, 60 or 90 days warranty from the reseller and no HS Fan. </s>
<s> BTW...the heatsion fan does NOT come preattached to the CPU. </s>

<s> Does your motherboard support what you are looking for? </s>
<s> I know retail amd comes as a complete kit; oem do not. </s>
