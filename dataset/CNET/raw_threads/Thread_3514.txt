I am running an old Gateway G6 350 machine. I recently upgraded to Windows ME on this machine to utilize my cable connection, and I need to know how I can improve this machines performance. I have been considering a new motherboard with faster processor, but was beginning to wonder if I could just plug in a faster processor into my existing board. I have an ATX board with an Intel Pentium II Processor running 350 MHZ. L2 Cache:512, pipeline burst integrated,100 MHZ Bus speed, package : SECC, 1 Slot. Running 256MB Ram. This is the only info I have on processor, don't know if it is enough. I have been looking for info on these subjects for days.Can I plug in any ATX board with faster chip? Can I plug in any &quot;slot 1&quot; chip? Is there a different &quot;chipset&quot; # or term I need to look for about this processor. Would rather spend $ on upgrading processor than on more ram (only 2 slots). Need HELP!!!

A new motherboard and processor are needed as a bundle, then you'll need RAM to match. I just rebuilt my web server and got an Elitegroup K8M800-M2 motherboard with onboard sound, video, and LAN, an AMD Sempron 1.6 GHz processor, 512 Meg of Kingston RAM. The board cost $79.99, the processor cost $59.99, and the RAM cost $59.99. I kept the HD and optical drive. The board also has 6 USB-2 ports. I found an OEM copy of WP Home here http://www.edirectsoftware.com/WindowsXPHome.html I installed everything in about a day. Runs like a top.

Also power is now a question. Do I have to upgrade power with upgraded board? Currently running a 200-250 watt power supply.

So a Standard ATX MB may NOT fit in your Gateway case. A PII is probably a AT case fromat so an ATX MB will not fit. Save up you money and plan on building a NEW PC. Outpost.com has a AMD Sempron 2400+ and ECS MB for $70. Get a new case for $50 with a 400wPSU on sale. A stick of 512mb DDRPC 3200 for $40 after rebate. A DVD burner for $40. a 128mb video card is $50. John

There were 2 mounting hardware configurations, as I recall. I had one ASUS board I remember converting to accept the PIII module. After 600mh it was socket 370. So, you might find an old 600mh slot 1 module out there. If it's cheap enough, it might be worth a try.

I can't remember the exact model number, but it's an Intel Tabor something-or-other that can take up to a 550MHz PIII. Ah, the memories....

Unlike specs for my computer I have seen, mine only has 2 RAM slots.

I ended up scrapping everything but the optical drives and keyboard. You can get a new case for a little as $25, a motherboard/CBU combo deal for about $60, 512 MB memory sticks for $50, and an OEM operating system for $80. Don't forget the power supply ($40) and CPU fan/heat sink ($20). I'm quoting prices from memory, so I could be a tad off. When you add it all up, you'd probably spend about as much as you would for one of Walmart's boxed entry-level sets. But what's the fun of that?

If you want new technology, get a motherboard with a socket that can handle fast cpu's, and many of those motherboards come with x16 pci slot for a high end graphics card. Many motherboards also have SLI compatibility for 2 graphics cards. With a new motherboard, new CPU, graphics card, and more memory, your system will be up and running like brand new. I also highly advise you get a new OS, like XP Home.

Here's what I found by doing a quick check through the Intel docs. Current BIOS: 4R4CB0XA.15A.0010.P03.9809011626 09/01/98 Newer BIOS available: 4R4CB0XA.86A.0020.P14 6/27/2000 The ''Motherboard Specification Update'' PDF says that the new bios should enable the board to take ''Slot 1'' (242-contact) PIII processors up to 600MHZ. The BIOS also enables the memory slots to take a 256MB module for a total of 512MB. It's up to you, but the money that you spend on the upgrades of the old computer could get you a long way towards the low-end Pentium 4 or AMD CPU systems that have been suggested in this discussion. Anyhow, the BIOS Update is free: RCBIOS14.EXE

I am wondering if it is just that easy, get a newer ATX board with a faster processor and heatsink, more ram, possibly a larger power supply, and just plug it into my case and existing peripherals. Is it going to be that easy? Will any ATX standard mobo work?
15088	20	134052	1512698	1512565	linkit	11/2/05 3:22 PM	1.13094492E12	not necessarily	'' So can I assume that this means any standard ATX board will fit into my case?'' Not necessarily. Look on P.12 of the Technical Information PDF. Section ''1.1 Overview'' says the motherboard was made in microATX (9.6'' x 9.6'') and full ATX (12.0'' x 9.6'') sizes. Which one do you have? You could put a microATX board in a number of standard case sizes, but you can't put a full ATX board in the smaller ATX cases. If you are going to get a new motherboard that can accommodate a more recent CPU (P4, Athlon 64, dual cores), the other components will have to be of a more recent generation as well. This includes the power supply unit (PSU). New components probably will need a new case to ensure proper cooling, fit larger fans, accommodate larger heatsinks, et al. There are good deals on new cases that come with PSU's.

From that base you can add other components, including the case and PSU. The way you decide on the CPU and motherboard is first to ask yourself what you want the computer to be able to do.
15088	23	134052	1512937	1512698	kingrvrs	11/2/05 5:34 PM	1.13095284E12	MOBO Size	Yes I did see that part. My board appears to be a micro. (9.6&quot; x 9.6&quot;) But my case has 3&quot; vertical clearance from bottom of mobo to bottom of case and extra set of connectors to accomadate (I assume) the larger board with more pci slots. my case has 2 pci slot openings in it that cannot be utilized with existing board due to its size. If I can't get a P4 (no biggie) can i get a P3 (or older athlon,not really up to snuff on their products)around 800mhz and still utilize existing peripherals, i.e. dvd rom and floppy. (also psu)I'm only trying to get as much as i can without building or buying all new computer. If it will only be a 600mhz processor I can get that probably won't be worth the effort and I would probably just build a newer computer (first time) to save $.
15088	24	134052	1513099	1512937	linkit	11/2/05 6:49 PM	1.13095734E12	new build sounds wise	According to the specifications of the upgraded BIOS on your current mobo, you should be able to upgrade to this Slot1 PIII 600MHz processor; however I give no guarantees. For the price, it may be worth the tinkering. http://www.geeks.com/products.asp?cat=CPU Problem is that you will still be limited with the 600MHz PIII. A lot of today's hardware and software needs a faster processor or one with a specific instruction set. I think you are right--probably the only case items you could bring to the new build are the DVD and floppy drives.
