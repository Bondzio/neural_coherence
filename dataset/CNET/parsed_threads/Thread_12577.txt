<s> My son wants to transfer VHS tapes into his Mac so he can edit them with iMovie. </s>
<s> Are there any reasonably priced Composite video to IEEE1394 converters available? </s>
<s> It could be the easy way. </s>

<s> What you are trying to do is convert analog video to digital video. </s>
<s> IEEE1394 (Firewire) is just the means of transporting the converted video to the Mac. </s>
<s> There have been a number of discussions about this subject recently. </s>
<s> If you have a digital movie camera, it almost certainly has a IEEE1394 connection on it. </s>
<s> It may also have RCA Video connections. </s>
<s> A look at the manual may reveal that it is possible to use the camera as a analog to digital convertor. </s>
<s> You may also want to take a look at www.canopus.com They sell analog to digital convertors that use IEEE1394 connections. </s>

<s> most video camera's(the good ones) that are digital have a analog pass through for you to do stuff like that. </s>
<s> but if you don't i would suggest the Data Video DAC-200 its a by-directional analog-digital converter. </s>
<s> yes it is a little steep in price but it is worth it. </s>

<s> Thanks to everyone for your help. </s>
<s> My son does indeed have a digital video camera with that capability. </s>
<s> He just didn't think he could use it that way. </s>
<s> You should have seen the look on his face when I told him about it....Thanks again </s>
