Is there any way to burn VCR tapes to my PC?
My son (Now deceased) was assistant athetic trainer for the Alabama Crimson Tide from 1979-199.
I have VCR tapes for every televised Crimson Tide game from 1985-1990.
I want to heep them in a better format, and perhaps to edit and burn them to DVD-RW disks.
Thanks, Ed Henne
