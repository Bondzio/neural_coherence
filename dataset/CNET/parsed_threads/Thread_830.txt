<s> That is until the wireless notebook gets turned on and then the internet will not work on the other four computers. </s>
<s> I'm hoping someone can give me some advise as to what the problem could be. </s>
<s> Let me know if you need more information. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>

<s> 2. </s>
<s> Someone disabled SSID broadcasts. </s>
<s> Actually there are a number of settings in that area but for most we go with stock settings first to get it working and then test to see what works and not. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Some routers let you limit the number of connections. </s>
<s> I set mine to 2X the possible number if it's not a network I have daily contact with. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you Bob. </s>
<s> I'm trying to get more information about their wireless. </s>
<s> In the meantime I'll have them check the items you suggested as possibilities. </s>
