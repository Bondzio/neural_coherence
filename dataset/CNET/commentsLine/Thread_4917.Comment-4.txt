let's compare the walled garden that is the ipad to the wild wild west of those android tablets from makers you never heard of.
in order from garden to wild wild west i think it's like this.
ipad, kf (current models), nexus and then a long path to the no-name models.
great to have choices.
i can't dissect all of this in 3 paragraphs and all this has open discussions so i will summarize.
