It works fine, except that both monitors keep on resetting their resolutions upon boot-up. Both monitors would normalized to their original resolutions if I launch Media Center (in full screen) and then close it. I use a Norwood Micro 15.4&quot; LCD as my primary monitor set to 1024 x 768, and the Toshiba 62HM15A 62&quot; DLP Projection HDTV as my secondary monitor set to 1280 x 720. Both are maximum settings. The display is set-up to &quot;extend Windows desktop&quot; onto the Toshiba. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

The desktop is extended onto this monitor, rather than cloned so I can still use the computer while watching movies. The problem persists whether I list the Toshiba as the primary or secondary monitor. I've tried playing around with the video card settings before posting without success. I do not know how to change the frequency on the Toshiba. I've checked the manual and did a web search without getting any info.
