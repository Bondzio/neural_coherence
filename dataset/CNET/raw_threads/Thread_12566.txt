I now have a dedrom and dvdrw. The only problem is that my new dverw will not do anything with dvds in it. It will play and burn cds but do neither for dvds. I think it might be a setting or something similiar, But I do not know. I have XP and it had the driver for the dvdrw already for it. Any help would be appreciated Thnx Mike
