1.1.1	Ok, so I built a computer a while ago and I just haven't had time to update the BIOS so I'm going to make time and do it.	St
1.1.2	This is my first time doing this so I'm a tad nervous because I've heard all the story's about people frying their motherboards when they do this.	St
1.1.3	So there's two ways that you can update the BIOS according to the instruction manual:1. you can use a floppy disc.	St
1.1.4	2.you can use a flash drive.	St
1.1.5	So I guess I have three questions: 1.	St
1.1.6	How dangerous is it to update your BIOS and is it very hard?	St
1.1.7	2.	St
1.1.8	Is it easier to use a floppy disc or a flash drive?	St
1.1.9	3.	St
1.1.10	Besides added options to the BIOS(mine is extremely basic) is there a performance boost?	St
1.1.11	Any help at all would be great on this topic.	Polite
1.1.12	Thanks so much.	St
1.2.1	is don't bother unless the new BIOS addresses a problem you are having or adds a feature you desire.	St
1.2.2	As for the best way, I prefer bootable media of any type rather that will allow you to make a backup of the old BIOS version first.	St
1.2.3	Make sure there's no way your PC can power down during a flash or it may be dead.	Res
1.2.4	This means a good working UPS.	St
1.2.5	As for performance boosts, that depends.	St
1.2.6	Read what's fixed or added in each revision.	St
1.2.7	Some might offer support for newer processors that might be faster but, on the whole, overall system speed ups aren't part of the MB sustaining crew's objective.	St
