I know it's weird only the board. We're talking socket 775 celeron D. The only thing I can't be certain about is the CPU. I'm getting a new board tomorrow or day after. What I'm wondering is a would a dead CPU hurt the board. If I use onboard video, 1 ram stick, plug in power to motherboard. Nothing else. No hd or cd. Just enough to power the board. Will a dead cpu fry the board. Or will it just not turn on. In other words will testing my cpu to see if it is dead or not fry the board. Or is it safer not to test it and just get a new CPU. thanks, confusimo

Its a shame to have to spend the money but then at least you will know black and white if its good or not.
