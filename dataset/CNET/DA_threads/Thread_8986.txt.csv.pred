1.1.1	I have a windows xp computer that i just tried to install a DVD burner into today.	St
1.1.2	The DVD burner is a NEC DVD+/-RW.	St
1.1.3	i read the article about how to install a DVD burner on here and thought i knew what i was doing.	St
1.1.4	But when i restarted my computer it stayed on the Gateway screen for about 3 minutes and then loaded onto XP.	St
1.1.5	then i went into My Computer to see if the drive was listed but it isnt.	St
1.1.6	Then my Direct CD icon in the corner of the screen has a little red cirle around it with a slash that says there isnt any drive.... i put a DVD into the DVD drive to see if windows media player would read it, but it didnt.	St
1.1.7	then i put a cd into my cd-r drive and it didnt even read that.	St
1.1.8	so now my dvd drive and my cd-r drive arent showing up.	St
1.1.9	i might have hooked the dvd burner up incorrectly.... i guess i need a little more help doing it.	St
1.1.10	the article on here is a little to 'smart' for me i guess and i dont think i fully understand somethings.	St
1.1.11	so, can anyway give me more in depth details about how to install it???	Ques
1.1.12	thanks!	St
1.2.1	what may be wrong since no info was given as to how the drive was jumpered and cabled to the existing drive/s.	Ques
1.2.2	On a guess I would venture the drive is improperly jumpered and or cabled.	St
