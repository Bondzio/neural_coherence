and not a mirror.
big problem here as pieces of data will cross both drives.
i'd say your best bet, if the drives are both good, is to find an the exact make and model of that enclosure and put the drives in using the same port relationship as they had.
it will be the raid bios/firmware that created the array and may be of such a proprietary nature that it will be the only thing that can read it properly.
otherwise, i'd say you're looking at drive recovery services.
