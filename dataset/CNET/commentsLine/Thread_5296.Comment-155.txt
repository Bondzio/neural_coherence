yes, id say categorically that you sooner or later will regret the integrated video card.
most modern games demand much more horsepower in order to run smoothly.
on the other hand if you have a stationary unit you can always add a decent video card later.
if it is a laptop you usually don't get a second chance.
good luck dim, sweden
