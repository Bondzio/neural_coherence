1.1.1	Hello, im new here i hope i get help..	St
1.1.2	I need to extend the range of my college wifi to rooms in a nearby building.	St
1.1.3	The wifi is open and is hotspot based: each time i connect, i have to enter my username and password.	St
1.1.4	The setup i made: access point on the roof of the building set as station, connected to a switch with 3 cables going down to three different rooms.	St
1.1.5	when i try connecting a laptop on LAN, it doesnt get automatic ip, so i set up the same ip+subnet+gateway+DNS as obtained when connected to the university's wifi.	St
1.1.6	The connection works well !	St
1.1.7	i try connecting 3 laptops simultaneously each with a different IP.. the connection works great on all 3 laptops.	St
1.1.8	When i connect just 1 router with static ip... this works fine as well.	St
1.1.9	BUT !!	St
1.1.10	when i try connecting 3 routers exactly like the laptop's configurations, the network fails... i dont know what im doing wrong !	Sug
1.1.11	(interference is not an issue since the routers are far from each others) please help me.. thank youu	Ques
1.2.1	The next routers must not have any connection to the WAN port.	St
1.2.2	Right?	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	of course they ARE connected to the WAN port... All 3 routers are connected to a switch that is connected to the access point... To make it simpler: when i connect 3 laptops on LAN with static ip it works perfectly, when i connect 3 routers instead with same static ip.	St
1.3.2	All three doesnt work... Is there anything else i should configure in the routers?	St
1.3.3	maybe assign each a different dhcp range ?	Ques
1.4.1	You want to deal with a Double NAT?	St
1.4.2	Sorry I would not do that.	St
1.4.3	Good luck.	St
1.4.4	As to static IP, another something I would not do.	St
1.4.5	My setup would use these routers as WAPs to avoid the double NAT and other issues.	St
1.4.6	Remember I can't tell you how to set this up.	Sug
1.4.7	That's something you must get a good grasp on, decide how and why and execute it as you have to live with it.	St
1.4.8	Besides, since you are using their service you can always work with their IT staff.	St
