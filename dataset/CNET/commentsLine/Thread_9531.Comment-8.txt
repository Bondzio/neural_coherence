thanks for the help, ive taken a look at your ecommendations and the choices look awesome but now comes up another problem.
im trying to get a high end system with a budget of $3000.
i was looking at ibuypower because it was allowing me to do just that.
however when i try to configure the same thing on ibuypower to say monarch i break the limit before i even get to finish half the list of choices =/.
im also looking into building my own rig but i'm afraid i might screw up with the components and run into compatibility issues.
but mainly right now im just trying to get a top of the line system with 3k.
thanks.
