My problem is now that I've moved it to the basement, I can't connect from the 2nd or 3rd floors of my home (city living, not livin la vida loca). Any suggestions on what to buy or do to extend my range?

Your wireless hub should be in a central location so everyone can get a good signal from it. Signals do NOT travel well through walls, metal and with all the interference, I would say you need to relocated it, again. Rick
