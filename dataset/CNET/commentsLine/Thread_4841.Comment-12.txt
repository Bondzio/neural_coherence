vapcmd - i received the new masscool unit yesterday and installed it last night.
my pc has been running ever since with no problems.
it looks like this fixed it.
i can't believe how quiet my system is now.
i guess the noise level must have been increasing gradually the last couple of years so i didn't notice the increase until i had something to compare it with.
i want to thank you for your help.
i really appreciate it.
