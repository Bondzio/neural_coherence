1.1.15	When in the BIOS category page , highlight ''Integrated Peripherals '' then press Enter to open that page .	St
1.1.16	You should see an entry for 'on-board video ' - press 'Page Up ' or 'Page Down ' key till it says 'Disabled ' .	St
1.1.17	Press 'Esc ' key to get back to main category page - then press F10 ( usually ) to save and exit .	St
