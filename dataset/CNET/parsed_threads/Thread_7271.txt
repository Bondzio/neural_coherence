<s> Hello i am trying to conect an 160gb seagate (ide)as a slave but i cant find a way to conect it without format As i see the jumper must not be conect for slave ( master is WD ) i conect it and the pc dont see it i find it by control panel,system etc and there i can see that the HDD seagate works fine. </s>
<s> Can i use it instead of dvd (pull out dvd and replace it by HDD) </s>
<s> Such as cable select for 80 conductor cables and the old master slave for the old 40 conductor cables? </s>
<s> I won't duplicate web content about this. </s>
