i built the pc i'm using now.
we cancelled our order with alienware and decided to build my husband's new gaming rig ourselves.
we spent about $3000 at newegg.com.
most of the stuff will be here thursday.
if all goes well he'll be gaming again by sat.
i think i'll build all my own p.c.s in the future.
this was total b.s.
