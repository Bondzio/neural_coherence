microsoft will supply basic keyboard functionality so no keyboard driver is required.
looking to microsoft for gateway support would a frustrating waste of time.
maybe you didn't write what said driver would do?
drivers get things working.
in the case of a keyboard, not so much a ''driver'' but a keyboard enhancer (not a driver!)
is what some are looking for.
the difference is there and be sure you are looking for the right software.
