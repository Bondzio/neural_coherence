Where a post was asking about upgrading the CPU on that motherboard.
According to HP &quot;your Motherboard('ASUS A8M2N-LA') supports a maximum of Athlon64 X2 up to 5000+&quot; So, that is as far as you can go using your present MOBO.
But that is close to what you had asked for anyways.
I think the 5000+ runs at 2.6GHz BTW: If you do not have an add-on video card, that motherboard uses the integrated GeForce 6150 chipset for onboard video (uses shared memory with the system)
