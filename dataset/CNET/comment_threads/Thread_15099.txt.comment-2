I'm not a gamer.
If I price out the parts for a PC and a monitor and software I can't come close to what I can buy a package deal for.
But that assumes that all the parts of a pkg deal are of any value to you.
I'm not looking to buy a new machine but every so often I visit Dell's bargain shop.....nice stuff....yesterdays model....cheap.
There is a benefit to building your own.
You gain a certain amount of knowledge about how the parts fit together and when it does not work quite right 'you' just go in an fix it.
