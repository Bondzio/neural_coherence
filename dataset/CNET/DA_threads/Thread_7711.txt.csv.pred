1.1.1	I need to know which one is a better deal.	St
1.1.2	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814150254&ATT=14-150-254&CMP=OTC-C173T&nm_mc=OTC-C173T&cm_mmc=OTC-C173T-_-Video+Cards-_-XFX-_-14150254 or http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127281 The clock speed on the GT is higher than the GTX but the GTX has more memory.	St
1.1.3	I'll be playing games like Oblivion, call of duty 4, fear, crysis, UT4, etc.	St
1.1.4	Most of the time fast paced so i need something that will not let me down in my aiming :P Thanks -MrCoffee	St
1.2.1	I might think about SLi....two 8800GT.	St
1.2.2	The other thing is ... if you're set on the 768MB GTX...looks like there may be better choices than the MSI...like the eVGA or the BFG.	St
1.2.3	Good Luck and let us know.	St
1.2.4	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	this 8800gts/512mb is almost as fast as a 8800gtx, only $30 more than the 8800gt/512, and in stock: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150261	St
1.4.1	http://www.hothardware.com/articles/NVIDIA_GeForce_8800_GTS_Refresh_Asus_and_XFX/?page=5	St
1.5.1	the 8800GT vs the 8800GTX is nearly equal, the extra memory does nothing, and the core clock also does nothing, because the GTX has more shaders than the GT I'd go with the 8800GT, mostly because its the best deal financially, and it'll easily tear up in all of those games as far as SLI, don't bother, unless you've got a huge monitor, and a very capable PC ...just as another note, i think you mean UT3	St
1.6.1	yeah same thing.	St
1.6.2	But the rest of my computer is killer, quad core, 6g ram, fun stuff like that.	St
1.7.1	wow, can we say someone got a little spend happy?	St
1.7.2	6GB is far and beyond what any application can realistically use, but hey, here's to being set for the next 2 years RAM-wise I'd still say go with the 8800GT, if you want a little more oomph look at the G92 based 8800GTS, its a tad faster, tad more expensive, not a bad card at all (its around $330, so about $40-$60 more than the GT, and its worth that $40-$60 more, vs the GTX which is around $200 more, and is worth about $55-$70 more)	St
1.8.1	yeah i get a paycheck, and i've only got one bill to pay with it, so yeah, whatever.	St
