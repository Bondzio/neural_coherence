You can pay almost the same price to get : imac with good specs like core 2 duo ,1 gb ram ,128 mb VGA ,20 &quot;monitor ,etc. OR macbook with good specs but a 64 VGA and small 13&quot; screen. I know that they are in different categories .. but I live in Egypt and I'm going to Canada after a month .. And I don't know how will a laptop help my studying in the Canadian high schools . Anyway ..there is no right or wrong about this thing .. All I want is to know some opinions from people who knows about it . Thanks alot ..

The Macbook is nice and portable, but I do a lot of multi-media stuff: Movie editing, music, graphics work, etc. I find working with an iMac is much easier for doing this stuff. The Macbook, with a small screen and scrunched keyboard is too small. Also, the iMac has more Firewire, USB, audio-in, audio-out, speaker plug, etc. that makes it much easier to plug external equipment in and also run my iMac speakers, all in a neat package. But, the Macbook IS portable, and I can download movies and music and take it with me. I just like the space and the &quot;open&quot; work environment that the iMac gives me.
