Free or Recycled PC's usually come minus RAM & Hard Drive Isn't it??
Office lot pulls as well.
First thing on these &quot;unknown&quot; units is to pull the side panel & see if everyone is home!
Then plug it in & fire it up, watching PSU fan to make sure it's workng.
Only then is it &quot;play time&quot;
