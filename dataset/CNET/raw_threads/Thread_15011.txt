After formating a a single simple dynamic disk, I would like to create partitions like a basic disk but haven't been able to figure out hoe to do this using disk management. My hope is to have three drive letters on this disk with roughly equal size. I've read the M/S article and it still didn't help. A straight forward how to would be appreciated. Thanks

One-way street.	&quot;Warning: After you convert a basic disk to a dynamic disk, local access to the dynamic disk is limited to Windows 2000 and Windows XP Professional. Additionally, after you convert a basic disk to a dynamic disk, the dynamic volumes cannot be changed back to partitions. You must first delete all dynamic volumes on the disk and then convert the dynamic disk back to a basic disk. If you want to keep your data, you must first back up the data or move it to another volume.&quot; http://www.petri.co.il/basic_vs_dynamic_disks.htm and other places.
