i aleady have the video card, is there another solution?
i didn't think it through before getting it off ebay.
needed it for my brothers birthday.
i forgot that my motherboard was a micro-atx.
i don't know if there is some type of 90 degree atx power adapter that would would fit?
kind of like a sata data cable.
maybe there is something like that and would work?
i was lucky to get a really low price on this.
i never really planned on upgrading from my radeon x700.
mostly because my desktop is getting older.
i just wanted to please my brother for his birthday, so he could hopefully play this one game.
