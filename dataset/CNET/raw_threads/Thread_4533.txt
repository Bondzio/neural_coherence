To make a long story short, I called them and got it fixed after 2 hours on the phone. I noticed afterwards that I had no sound. I did a system restore and got my sound back but I had to redo the Kodak software. Now I noticed that I have no DVD drive, CD-Rom Drive and no Memorex external drive. When I go into device manager they all have a yellow circle with a black exclamation point in it. When I try to update the driver it says it cannot find the drive. When I try to rollback it says they is no backup for this drive. I am at my wits end. Can someone please, please help me. Do I need to call in a computer repair man or is this something I can fix myself with some help. I have a Dell Dimension Desktop 3000 running Windows XP. The drivers I am missings are as follows: Memorex DVD t Ram 530L v1 USB Device HL-DT-ST DVD Rom GDR 8163B Sony CD-Rom CRX217E Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated. I always get good help from my CNET friends. Thank you, Maryann
