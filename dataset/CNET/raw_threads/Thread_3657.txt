Just wondering, noting all the complaints, why you are interested in installing it? Have a look at the Vista forum before you waste your money. Please.

Don't upgrade to Windows Vista for at least 6 months, until you can get the drivers and software compatable with Vista for your peripherals. I have a HP scanner that I am now told the drivers won't be released until the end of July at the earliest. Mine is a newer scanner and they are going to start releasing the drivers from new to old so the older scanners and printers may get the Vista compatable drivers some time next year at the rate they are going. And yes you do need at least a 1 gig processor and 1 gig of ram. My computer has a 2.20 gig duel core processor and 2 gig of ram and runs fine, but is using 48% of ram just setting there running Vista. My neighbor has a 1.6 gig celeron processor and 1 gig of ram and it runs terrible. I like Vista very much, but if I had it to do over I would wait.
