1.1.1	Hello , I recently purchased an old HPE-210Y Desktop with the ATI Radeon HD5450 graphics card installed .	St
1.1.2	I would like to have a large screen display for the desktop , but I want it to be clear and to fit proportionality on the monitor screen .	St
1.1.3	I am currently considering buying a 29 inch LCD monitor display or a 32 inch LED 720p Television .	St
1.1.4	I was hoping someone on this forum could provide me with guidance as to which purchase would be a better option .	St
1.1.5	I do not play video games , but I do watch a lot of You Tube videos and surf the net .	St
1.1.6	The desktop also has a blue ray player .	St
1.1.7	Thanks .	Polite
1.1.8	Here is the link to the HP website that contains the computer specifications .	St
1.2.1	LCD is generally regarded as CCFL back lit LCD where as LED LCD means that LEDs back light the LCD .	St
1.2.2	OLED is your true LED system but you know that .	St
1.2.3	Skip/ignore 720p for now and there is little to zero difference when it comes to LED/CCFL & quot ; clarity & quot ; .	St
1.2.4	Clarity is all about the LCD panel and possibly the protective cover ( gloss = clarity but you know the drawbacks . )	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	The better TVs are going to have the resolution you want .	St
1.3.2	as for brands and what model and all that , you 're left with buying better TV as in better than 720 , that 's old stuff now .	St
1.3.3	I suggest anything that starts better than 720 is going to provide what you need .	St
1.3.4	The 5450 video ports should offer both HDMI and SVGA/DVI or all , just be sure that it connects w/o ANY ! ! ! !	St
1.3.5	adapter to make this a better match .	St
1.3.6	I also find you will need to tell the TV where the media stream is coming from but that goes with any TV in most respects .	St
1.3.7	Last , you may want a huge TV , but most 32in .	St
1.3.8	will do the job fine IMHO .	St
1.3.9	Once you get beyond 32in .	St
1.3.10	you maybe pushing it unless you have true hi-end video components , etc..	St
1.3.11	It may display and all , but for how long and/or sustain it all .	St
1.3.12	Of course , just buy the true PC monitor , but those TVs really make a great display .	St
1.3.13	tada -- -- -Willy	St
