1.1.1	Hi all - My XPS410 ( WinXP , 4gB ram ) began having startup problems this morning .	St
1.1.2	Upon power up , it gets to the Windows XP startup screen , the blue dots scroll back and forth for about 20-30 seconds , then the monitor goes blank .	St
1.1.3	I can start the computer in safe mode OK .	St
1.1.4	I used system restore to go backwards a couple of days , but no luck with that either .	St
1.1.5	What am I missing here ? ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	While in safe mode , set the video mode to 800 by 600 .	St
1.2.2	Ok your way out and then click , Start , shutdown , restart .	St
1.3.1	I did try that with no luck - thanks for the suggestion .	Polite
1.3.2	I have noticed that when the Windows startup screen goes blank , I then hear the hard drive spin down .	St
1.3.3	I have disabled all the services and startup entries in MSCONFIG , that made no difference .	St
1.3.4	I have removed RAM sticks one pair at a time , as well as individually , also with no change .	St
1.4.1	That tidbit would have changed my advice .	St
1.4.2	In this case I would head back to safe mode and research all items in MSCONFIG and see what I could disable .	St
1.4.3	Remember I would not leave any any entry enabled unless I knew why .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
