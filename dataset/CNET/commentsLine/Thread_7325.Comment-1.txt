my mouse pointer recently started to move and click on its own.
it would draw selection rectangles and right click and left click.
i disconnected the network, but it continued.
avg and panda were unable to detect viruses, and windows defender and ad-aware failed to find spyware.
i swapped mice, and noticed when i installed my backup mouse with the original drivers that there was a second mouse installed on my system in device manager.
it was a generic driver for a &quot;hid-compliant mouse&quot;.
when i disabled this device the mouse stopped moving on its own.
i tried uninstalling it but it came back.
i don't know if it will stay disabled.
has anyone ever heard of this happening before?
