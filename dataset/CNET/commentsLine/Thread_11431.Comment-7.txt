were the values ok or not?
i have to ask.
about the push button.
we can do without that on most computers to know it's not that.
it's unlikely but i remove it and test it on its own as it could be defective.
let me be clear.
it would take a chapter in a book to cover all the oddities about switches like that one.
i can't write that here and even if i did, most folk won't have the ohm meter.
that piece of test gear is about 10 or so bucks and is required if we are to diagnose things without swapping.
once we know the volts are fine we have to consider they are right and it's a motherboard failure.
but since a low cmos battery can block booting on some but not all machines, measure that too.
