Aside from having a firewire port, what kind of processing power, memory, hard drive, etc. do I need to have? I would prefer to keep the cost to a minimum, below $1,000 if possible. Thanks.

An Acer TER-600 with a P3 600 MHz CPU, 256MB RAM, 40 GB 5400 RPM drive and Windows 2000. The video wasn't anything special and it worked for years. Today you would be hard pressed to find a new laptop with lesser specs. Bob
