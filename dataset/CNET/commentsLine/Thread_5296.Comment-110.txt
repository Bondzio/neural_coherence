the integrated graphic card, no matter how much memory it can share from your ram, is still something lackluster.
it may play hd video, but then not so smoothly with dropping frames from time to time and with high cpu usage.
gaming is the last thing you would want to do on those pcs.
the latest intel integrated grpahic can't even handle need for speed underground 2 (a game released in 2004) with medium detail setting and 1280x960.
as ms office had evolved to more graphic dependent, your pc may not be able to run the coming office 2010 smoothly.
so, think twice.
even an entry level graphic card will help a lot, say gt210, 9400gt etc.
