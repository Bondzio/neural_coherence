Hi.
Could you please let us know an update of your situation&gt;?
what did you use in the end and what was the result?
I have just had a scare with myE: drive which has about 80G of movies and other things on there, i am right now scanning it in the background with HDD Regenerator.
I already have a copy of the program recommended by ontrack so I am armed; just hoping I don't need it!
I would like to know what happened here though so do let us know.
