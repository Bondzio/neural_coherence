These drives could be wiped out by just the act of plugging it into some systems.
Someday we hope to find these with a switch to lock the files up tight.
I have yet to encounter a lemon (tempting fate here!)
but too many times I find dropped, smoked, never checked, last copy of my file in the universe drives and volumes.
Just not mine.
