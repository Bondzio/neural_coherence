sometimes i get beat up for sharing my experiences and not supplying an answer.
in this case there is no documented answer (believe me i did pour over the foxconn pdfs for my and other boards.)
now that was earlier this year so maybe they changed and maybe not.
but thanks for the reply and hopefully something i wrote will help.
