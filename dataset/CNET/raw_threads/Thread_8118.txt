The built in card reader in my epson printer displays a picture of a memory card with a zig zag line across it implying that the card is corrupted. However, I can view the pictures on the camera and can transfer normally to the computer using a USB to the camera. However, the card reader is much more convenient. I have formatted the card using the camera's function and that did nothing. Any ideas?

It has slots for 6 different types of card and I have previously used it with a Memory Duo Pro (or whatever that long Sony one is called) successfully. The printer is only a couple of years old. It is an Epson Stylus Photo RX520 (which is similar to the RX500: http://reviews.cnet.com/multifunction-devices/epson-stylus-photo-rx500/4505-3181_7-30604037.html?tag=prod.txt.1 )
