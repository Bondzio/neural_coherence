I have about 15 gigs worth of music and I cannot access them. I know they're in there because the same amount of space is used up on the hard drive. The pie chart and &quot;free space&quot; are nearly the same as before I reinstalled windows. Thanks, Clint

Hello there, I just recently reinstalled Windows Xp Pro and I have the same problem as you, where my old files are still on the used space on the pie chart on C drive which was the same before the reinstallation. I wondered if you have solved this problem? Could I please have some help? Thank you.

Why don't you start your own new thread explaining your problem and giving all necessary background information? Kees
