<s> I saw some product by Albatross that allowed AGP cards to be used on a PCI-E Port, I was wondering how it's performance was. </s>
<s> I'm looking into a AGP card for my current system, but I'm reluctant because I know it might be useless in a couple of years with PCI-E as the standard. </s>
<s> Hi, Could you please provide a link to enlighen me? </s>
<s> I have never known that an AGP video card can fit a PCI-E x-16 port. </s>
<s> isn't AGP Parallel? </s>
<s> I know PCIE is Serial, but isn't AGP a Parallel bus? </s>
<s> it's some sort of bridge inbetween the card and the slot... http://www.albatron.com.tw/english/news/news_detail.asp?news_id=167 </s>
<s> Thanks for the link. </s>
<s> Something new since yesterday. </s>
<s> Will be interesting to follow and see how it works out. </s>
<s> my 6800GT fit in there dual slot cooling solution physically massive card i'd like to see that fit in it looks like only low profile cards will fit... </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> that has an AGP and PCI-e slots. </s>
<s> According to article http://forums.techpowerup.com/archive/index.php/t-2074.html ''The PT880 Pro chipset is world s only chipset to feature a true AGP graphics controller in combination with PCI Express graphics, ensuring all graphics cards can reach their full performance potential. </s>
<s> Furthermore, users can also benefit form VIA DualGFX technology by using both AGP and PCI Express graphics cards at the same time, providing enhanced multi-display support through the ability to connect up to 4 displays. </s>
<s> Further information on the VIA PT880 Pro chipset may be found at: http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/chipsets/p4-series/pt880pro/ The VIA DualGFX technology (VIA PT894PRO): http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/chipsets/dual-gfx/ </s>
<s> the fact that it's VIA makes it undesireable for performance tweaking (VIA is horrible for overclocking and performance tweaking, as they are a value centered brand) and thank you for providing the exact chipset that does this (i knew it was a VIA chip that did AGP/PCIE, but did not know which one it was (or which platform it was for (AMD or Intel) just that it existed) </s>
