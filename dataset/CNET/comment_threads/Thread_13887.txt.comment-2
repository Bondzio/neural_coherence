FTP is the File Transfer Protocol.
It is one method for storing files in a central location and sharing them.
FTP servers will not show up under &quot;My Neighborhood&quot;.
That is a windows workgroup thing.
Personally, I prefer the FTP method.
Windows file sharing is very chatty and can negatively impact wireless networks when many machines are broadcastion Netbios traffic.
