1.1.1	I have an older UMAX ASTRA 1200S scanner using an SCSI card.	St
1.1.2	Purchased a new Sony VIO model VGC-RA828G.	St
1.1.3	Will an SCSI card be required to connect scanner to new PC????	St
1.1.4	Sony manual does not cover this topic.	St
1.2.1	While a new SCSI card will do, then what about scanner drivers and applications?	St
1.2.2	99.99% of the time, a new scanner is cheaper.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Bob's idea is good!	St
1.3.2	A used SCSI card on ebay $20~30.	St
1.3.3	New $90 XP will have drivers is it's an Adaptic card.	St
1.3.4	Now will drivers that came with your scanner work in XP since they were written for Win98???	St
1.3.5	I'm going to find out since I have a old UMAX scsi scanner and my 98se machine is realy old.	St
1.3.6	The only reason I'm going try is my scanner is a highend model and cost a lot of $$$$$ and has a transparency adapter.	St
1.3.7	I'll repost with results.	St
1.3.8	John	St
1.4.1	I have the SCSI card that came with it.	St
1.4.2	So installing it isn't a problem.	St
1.4.3	I just thought the new systems came with an SCSI port.	St
1.4.4	Guess I was wrong.	St
1.4.5	When we updated the old computer from Win98se to ME I had to go to UMAX and order a new version of their software.	St
1.4.6	At that time they said they would not be updating to XP compatable.	St
1.4.7	I looked again the other day and found that they did update to XP and they have new software that should work with the scanner.	St
1.4.8	I hate to get rid of it.	St
1.4.9	It has such a high resolution (9800 x 9800) and it copies legal size documents.	St
