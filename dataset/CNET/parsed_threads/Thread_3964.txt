<s> Is it? </s>
<s> I'd have to get a specific model to see what drivers they had for other OS's. </s>
<s> But it's a safe bet Linux could be fine. </s>

<s> Im not exactly sure, I could take pictures of it for you? </s>
<s> Some other specs are that it has Intel P4 1.8Ghz, 256MB ram Heres a link to my exact computer: http://www.mbidata.com/specials/J156-2086-a1-KD-main.jpg on that website it says that it uses Windows 2000 on that one, but is it possible to get XP working on it? </s>
<s> Without a model number I can't check for you. </s>
<s> Look on the rear panel or bottom for the model number. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I located the tags. </s>
<s> Here are all the numbers that I See: Machine Type: 6790 Model: 21U Serial Number: KA11DGX MFG or MIG: 205 Product ID: 6790 21U There are other tags with numbers too, I will post those if this doesnt help. </s>

<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you, you saved me some money and time. </s>
<s> I have another question though. </s>
<s> I have some HP system recovery disks lying around, I was wondering if I could use those to install onto the IBM Netvista, Is that possible? </s>
<s> Or is that not what the Recovery Disk are made for? </s>

<s> I'll purchase a new copy of WinXP. </s>
<s> After I buy the new OS, is there anything that I need to do before installation of WinXP or do I just pop the CD in to begin the installation process. </s>
<s> You mentioned search for drivers earlier, is that neccasary if im installing a brand new OS? </s>
<s> I also think that HDD was whipped clean and there Isnt anything on it. </s>
<s> Im a n00b at this, haha. </s>
<s> I could just buy a new copy of WinXP and go from there? </s>
<s> Microsoft supplies the OS, some drivers that are barely good enough to install the rest of the drivers for the machine. </s>
<s> Not automatic so noob or seasoned we all do the driver hunt. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Haha ok. </s>
<s> So where/what do I search, The IBM PC itself or do I download them from the lenova link that you gave me? </s>
<s> If that step, then how do I get the drivers on the OS'less IBM? </s>
<s> Through Floppy perhaps? </s>
<s> I offered the link already. </s>
<s> I'd use that one. </s>
