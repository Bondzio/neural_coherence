<s> I have a Linksys 802.11g wireless router/hub that works great. </s>
<s> My problem is now that I've moved it to the basement, I can't connect from the 2nd or 3rd floors of my home (city living, not livin la vida loca). </s>
<s> Any suggestions on what to buy or do to extend my range? </s>
<s> is no place to put your wireless hub. </s>
<s> Your wireless hub should be in a central location so everyone can get a good signal from it. </s>
<s> Signals do NOT travel well through walls, metal and with all the interference, I would say you need to relocated it, again. </s>

<s> Range extenders are available. </s>
<s> Just an example: http://www.linksysbycisco.com/US/en/products/RangeExpanders A drawback of extenders is that they decrease the throughput of your WLAN. </s>
<s> Try locating it on the basement ceiling directly below where you need to connect to. </s>
<s> Basements are not the right place for wifi routers. </s>
