<s> My PC suddenly lost sound. </s>
<s> I have followed all diagnostics advice and diag tells me all is well...But all is not well...I want to play some music! </s>
<s> One time this happened to me also and I figured out that I have several players, (Windows Media, Real Player, Winamp) the sound had been muted on Real Player. </s>
<s> Also, have you installed any new software about the time this problem started. </s>
<s> Once our sound kept going off shortly after reboot. </s>
<s> After months of headaches, I figured out it was a game that my daughter had gotten out of a cereal box, Who Wants to be a Millionaire. </s>
<s> After uninstalling game, problem went away. </s>
<s> Thanks testy...tried that! </s>
<s> Now I cannot open or uninstall Quick Time. </s>
<s> I cannot go back with system restore, have tried every day for two weeks back.....HELP I am running XP-SP2 </s>
