Anyone have good ideas about good reliable medium out there?
Other than dvds, is there something convient for easy add and delete feature like how usb drives work?
I tried that feature from burning software that gives your cd- rw the easy add and delete feature like floppy.
But the problem was it seemed that I can only like view, add and delete with the writer I burned with I think.
Thats not very practical cuz if that burner ever dies I wont be able to access mediums with floppy feature that is created from that.
