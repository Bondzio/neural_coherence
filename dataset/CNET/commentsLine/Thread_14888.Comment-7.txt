ok, i think i see waht you are saying.
i do plan on getting vista, so as long as i have vista i should be able to run dx 10 on a video card i buy today, like an ati 1900. but if i keep using xp i shouldnt expect to be able to run dx 10. it all makes sense now.
forgive me, i am a little slow on the uptake
