<s> Hi there - i currently own 2 wifi routers which have 4 lan ports on the back. </s>
<s> In my room i have two desktops without wireless capability. </s>
<s> I was wondering is it possible to have one router in my room which my desktops plug into - and then the router to &quot;&quot;Bridge&quot; with the one downstairs to give me wireless capability. </s>
<s> I believe its called bridging but i have had no hopen as of yet. </s>
<s> Huawei HG520b and Huawei HG532 are my two routers. </s>
<s> I know this can be done by purchasing a wire - but i cannot afford a 100m cable and i am not particularly interested in purchasing an adapter for my desktops. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> For a wireless bridge, you need both in bridge mode. </s>
<s> This, in essence, locks the two devices onto one another. </s>
<s> You'd need additional wireless access points to provide a signal to the areas you desire. </s>
<s> I've not done this myself, however. </s>
<s> Here's a reasonable explanation of how to do this on youtube. </s>
<s> I was in error stating that both wireless devices would need to be in bridge mode. </s>
<s> Only the remote device will. </s>
<s> But, once that device is in bridge mode, it will no longer provide a wireless signal to PCs. </s>
<s> You would need another AP connected to it or, if it had wired ports, use those. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>

<s> The reason i am wanting this - is so that i can use my downstairs router as a wireless router for laptops downstairs and to give my upstairs router internet acsess, how do i go about this? </s>
<s> with wired ports, that would probably work. </s>
<s> I've seen APs offer bridge mode but not routers. </s>
<s> You'd first need to visit both of your routers' configuration options to see if either offers it. </s>
<s> If not, you try and find some firmware to replace that of one of your routers that offers bridge mode. </s>
<s> Keep in mind that doing so might render a router incapable of acting as a router. </s>
<s> As well, any wireless bridge broadcast is locked to a single device by MAC address. </s>
<s> A bridged AP cannot provide a signal to PCs as well as be a bridge. </s>
<s> If I'm envisioning this correctly, your router is downstairs and you want the signal in an upstairs room and the upstairs room has PCs that will be wired to a switch. </s>
<s> BTW, the wired ports on a router are actually a switch. </s>
<s> I can think of two options. </s>
<s> If the signal from the downstairs router is strong enough to contact an upstairs bridge, I don't see why the signal can't reach the PCs directly. </s>
<s> You might be able to use something as simple as a USB wifi adapter. </s>
<s> But, if you want to bridge the two areas via wireless, you will probably need to purchase a dedicated bridge device or an AP with that capability. </s>
<s> If you wanted to use Ethernet to the PCs in your room, you'd need small switch to connect to the wireless bridge device. </s>
<s> I can't be confident that you can accomplish what you wish with what you now own. </s>
<s> Sorry but guess I can't help. </s>
<s> Perhaps someone here has a better idea or knows if one of your routers offers a firmware replacement that would be suitable. </s>
<s> http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-turn-an-old-router-into-a-wireless-bridge/ You'll see a link to an open source firmware replacement. </s>
<s> From there you'll find a list of supported devices. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I don't see your routers in the list. </s>
<s> I also don't see them in the list of compatible router but I also don't see them in the list of incompatible routers. </s>
<s> I suppose this gives you the option to try this on your own if you don't mind running the risk of bricking one of your devices. </s>
<s> Thank you for looking and commenting on the post - i will now put this to good use </s>
