cpus on the low cost.
basicaly semprons are the older 32 bit socket a athlons with a new lable.
there are versions that are socket 754 and offer higher front end buss speeds but are still 32 bit.
the 3100+ is $112 at newegg.
but for $124 at newegg you could get the amd64 2800+.
two years ago i built a pc with a amd athlon 2400+.
a few months ago i did another one for a friend who wanted to keep the cost low, used a sempron 2400+.
the only difference between the two is the cost of the processor.
