Hello, Latest BIOS?
8X AGP activated in BIOS?
Latest MB Chipset drivers?
Latest Video Card drivers & DirectX?
Drivers properly installed?
If all this is done, try in a different computer.
If all the drivers are current & the problem still exists, your looking at a hardware issue.
Good luck & keep us informed.
