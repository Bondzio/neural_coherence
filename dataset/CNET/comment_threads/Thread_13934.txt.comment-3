If you have another PC that can handle the same components that is the way to go.
I do that often but just be carefull one bad component can do other damage to your system.
If the computer did not get kicked on the side the MB is on it might not be that bad.
Cables would be the first thing I would check Then The CPU or check for a cracked MB.
It take a bit to damage a HD.
Key components 1) MB 2) CPU If Those Components or OK the PC is repairable
