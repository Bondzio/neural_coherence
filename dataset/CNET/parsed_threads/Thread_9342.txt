<s> Hello - We have an office network of 6 pc's. </s>
<s> A shared folder is setup on one pc for all pc's to access. </s>
<s> How can I make this shared folder inaccessible to just one of the 6 pc's? </s>
<s> All are Windows XP. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help! </s>

<s> How have you done that? </s>
<s> I'm not sure how its setup right now. </s>
<s> They just all have access. </s>
<s> So I need to get into permissions and deny that single pc? </s>
<s> Is it that easy? </s>
<s> but allowing users to access it. </s>
<s> You said there is one PC you want to exclude but, if that PC needs general network access, you need to look at how user accounts are set up. </s>
<s> You don't do this by exclusion but by inclusion. </s>
<s> Presuming you have a simple peer-to-peer relationship which would mean local rather than network authentication, you just create user accounts on the PC with the share for all users that that need to access it. </s>
<s> You give access to that share by setting permissions on that PC to include those defined users. </s>
<s> I'll give a suggestion not to allow the &quot;everyone&quot; option. </s>
<s> On the PC you don't want to have access to that particular share, you can do so by not creating the same user account names/passwords that are defined on the PC with the shared folder and given access to it. </s>
<s> In this way, they may see the network share but will get &quot;access denied&quot; if they attempt to open it. </s>
<s> This is just the simplest method I can think of but there may be others depending on your intentions and other networking needs. </s>
