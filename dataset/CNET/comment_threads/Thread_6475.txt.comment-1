I recently got an IDE HDD back that I lent to my mate a while back, and have bought an external case for it from eBay.
I put it in the case, plugged it in correctly, and it wouldn't recognise.
Trying to fix this, I took out the drive and connected it directly to my PC via a SATA cable.
I reformatted the drive and created a single volume on it.
I put the drive back into the case, and it still won't recognise... [I am sure there's power getting to the drive.]
Any help // suggestions?
