1.1.1	I need a 3.5&quot; sata enclosure.	St
1.1.2	There are tons of them out there, but none that seem to fit my needs.	St
1.1.3	I need it to have an external sata data AND power connection.	St
1.1.4	Similar to http://www.cwol.com/serial-ata/external-3-5-sata-hard-drive-enclosure.htm It would work, but it's no longer available.	St
1.1.5	Does anyone know if there is one out there that would work?	St
1.1.6	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Is there something I missed?	St
1.4.1	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817146057 There are others but if you can't use their search engine, call them and talk to them.	St
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	http://www.mwave.com/mwave/viewspec.hmx?scriteria=AA67400 I bought 2 of them awhile back and so far so good.	St
1.5.2	Then the other day, Fry's had a sale on this one for $15, so I bought 3 of them.	St
1.5.3	Looks nice but turns out it didn't have internal fans (so I guess I will have to drill some holes before use) but that will ruin the looks though.	St
1.5.4	http://www.mwave.com/mwave/viewspec.hmx?scriteria=AA71962	St
1.6.1	Thanks for the quick replies!	St
1.6.2	I've looked at those ones before, but that's not what I'm looking for.	St
1.6.3	It's a bit of a unique device that I need.	St
1.6.4	You know how the back of a sata drive has the little sata data port as well as the power port to connect it to the PSU?	St
1.6.5	Well I need both of those on the outside of the case.	St
1.6.6	Have a gander at the 3rd &quot;Alternate View&quot; on this page: http://www.ics-iq.com/index.cfm/action/product.show/id_product/fa761bfa-987a-489a-8942-d4e200be1e77/id_category/bd2df454-b7e7-4e2f-bca8-828ea0a266e4 The hard drive will be connected to the device using Sata rather than IDE, but it's the same concept.	St
1.6.7	I just need a case or enclosure that exposes these connections so I can connect it to this device using a cable.	St
1.6.8	Sorry for the confusion.	St
1.7.1	And don't tax the host machine power.	St
1.7.2	Bob	St
1.8.1	Yeah I understand that.	St
1.8.2	However the hard drive in the case won't be connecting directly to a computer.	St
1.8.3	It will be connecting to the device which connects to the computer.	St
1.8.4	The problem is that the cable that connects to the hard drive is a single cable with both data and power attached and cannot be split.	St
1.8.5	The device powers the hard drive in order to use it, so these models won't work as they don't have the sata power connector.	St
1.8.6	Does that make sense?	St
1.9.1	http://www.satacables.com/sata-power-cables.html Give this I could use either case and the usual molex extender cables to pull power from the desktop PSU.	St
1.9.2	There are also many other cables out there but with a little creativeness you can get it done.	St
1.9.3	Bob	St
1.10.1	That still doesn't change the fact that I would need a case that exposes both connections on the back of the hard drive.	St
1.10.2	The device is used to image a hard drive without having to take the target drive out of the system, so I don't want to have to open the computer to power the drive, and also don't want to have to power the enclosure.	St
1.10.3	Basically, just a case to protect the hard drive and still allow me to hook the cable directly into the back of the hard drive.	St
1.10.4	I'm really not sure if there is anything out there that I'm looking for, so I was thinking about getting a cheap enclosure, and modifying the back so that I could connect to the hard drive directly.	St
1.11.1	I can drill a hole to use that cable.	St
1.11.2	But I just remembered that drive trays use that connection too.	St
1.11.3	http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/category/category_slc.asp?CatId=285	St
1.12.1	I think that may work perfectly!	St
1.12.2	I saw a few of those but I guess it didn't click.	St
1.12.3	Thanks a ton for the help	Polite
1.13.1	how come I get the feeling it's a scam?	St
1.13.2	hehe.	St
1.14.1	The spammers would never engage in the discussion.	St
1.14.2	So this is a member and not a spammer.	St
1.15.1	That's what gave me the feeling.	St
1.15.2	I just saw an adapter at Fry's for $15; it says for cloning ata and sata through usb.	St
1.16.1	It was 10.99 plus a few bucks shipping with sata, ide 3.5 and 2.5 support.	St
1.16.2	Very handy thing.	St
