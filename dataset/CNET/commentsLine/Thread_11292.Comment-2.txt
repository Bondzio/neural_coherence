boot from the installation cd/dvd and instead of continuing along with the installation, go to the menu bar and choose disk utility.
find your drive and initialize it as hfs+(journaled) .
you may see it marked as hfs extended(journaled) they are both the same.
once you have done that, quit from du and all should be well.
you may have to reboot before the installer sees the results of your labor.
good luck p
