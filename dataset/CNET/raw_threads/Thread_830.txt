There's about four computers connected and the wireless internet works great. That is until the wireless notebook gets turned on and then the internet will not work on the other four computers. I'm hoping someone can give me some advise as to what the problem could be. Let me know if you need more information. Thank you.

The router firmware is out of date. 2. Someone disabled SSID broadcasts. Actually there are a number of settings in that area but for most we go with stock settings first to get it working and then test to see what works and not. 3. Some routers let you limit the number of connections. I set mine to 2X the possible number if it's not a network I have daily contact with. Bob
