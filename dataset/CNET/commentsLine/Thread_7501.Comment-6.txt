your question is a very good question and my customers ask me this all the time and what i and most techs recommend is that the fan should be placed on the heatsink so that the air is being sucked off the heatsink not blown on.
just think about it do you realy want hot air to get blown on to the heatsink and make it hotter or do you want the hot air to be pulled off so that the cooloing fan can suck the hot air back out of the system cooling the system off.
