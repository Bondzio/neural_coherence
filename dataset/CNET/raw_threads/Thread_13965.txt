What i mean is that when i connect the the device through my usb 2.0 port the computer detects that a new hardware( USB 2.0 mass storage device...disk drive) is found and it says it is ready for use but when I look for it in my comp. with the other drives i could not find it. so please tell me what to do. The operating system am using is WINDOWS XP
