try using a tool like sandra,  this application can help you define your issue instead of pulling your hair out trying to guess what may be wrong.
i used to use me on a dell dimension pc, it gave me a few problems.
me was the precursor to win xp home and a few of the features in me should have been left as beta as device drivers written for the other windows version were not alway friendly to me.
you may just have a simple driver issue.
if you can foot the bill, i say upgrade to xp home.
you will be happy you did.
