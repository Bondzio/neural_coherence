If there is no text immediately below the Firewall bar, click the word ''Firewall'' to expand that category. It will tell you if there is a firewall running and its name if there is one running. There is also a link there that says ''How does a firewall help protect my computer.'' Click that link for an explanation of a firewall. Windows XP has a built-in firewall. Other popular firewalls include ZoneAlarm, Norton Internet Security, and McAfee Personal Firewall. If you are running Windows XP Firewall, then running Network Setup Wizard should configure the firewall to allow Internet access. If your firewall is some other program, then you will need to open that program to change a setting to allow internet access. ASIDE: You need firewall, antivirus, and antispyware to protect your computer.

As a result, I don't have any experience with it; however, I do know that some Verizon Internet services require you to run their installation disc. If you were given a Verizon disc, then you may need to use it on your notebook, too.

By the way, I assume that Verizon provided you with a fiber optic modem. Do you also have a router? If so, what is its make & model?

Did you read my earlier posts to discover if Windows XP Firewall is on? Did you run the Network Setup Wizard (it's in your Control Panels)? http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7589-0.html?forumID=62&threadID=166959&messageID=1848522 What about the installation disc? http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7589-0.html?forumID=62&threadID=166959&messageID=1848529 These are not trivial questions.

Please type your answers and results in replies to the questions so I or others can help you. Kinda' senseless to retype all that. Also, have you called Verizon about this? Use a speaker phone if you have one because you may be on hold for a while.
