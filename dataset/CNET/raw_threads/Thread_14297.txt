The notifications is broken, so the site does not email me of new posts anymore. Thunder

Computers are always gaining in development. Even tho that some systems are &quot;yesterday&quot;, they will still work as great for the next several years. This computer I've been considering is an Athlon 64 X2. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16883107257 Its affordable with nice specs. What you think? I compared it with a Gaming computer and found that the Gaming computer I was looking at cost more, because of fancy case design. Thunder
