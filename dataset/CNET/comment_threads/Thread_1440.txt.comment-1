I connect to the hospital records department through a Nortel VPN (Contivity).
All was going well until an update in the client was required by the hospital.
It was recommended the the old VPN Client be uninstalled before installing the new.
In doing so, there was an incomplete uninstall, leaving two items in device manager which I cannot manually delete and which prevent an install of the new VPN.
The two items are IPSECSHM (Nortel) and WAN Miniport (ATW).
Nortel tech support will not assist me, saying that the hospital is responsible and the IT people at the hospital won't (can't) do anything and tell me to just reinstall Windows XP.
There has never been as previous VPN client installed on this system which I know is a known issue.
Please help!
Joe
