<s> I have just gotten a new Samsung i760, and it has Windows Mobile 6. </s>
<s> It is also WiFi compatible, as well as Bluetooth. </s>
<s> I work in a school and was wondering if there was a way to run powerpoint presentations from my smartphone, so I wouldn't have to carry a laptop around, etc. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> I was searching for the same type of device when I ran across this one: http://www.impatica.com/showmate/ . </s>
<s> It looks like it might work. </s>
<s> Let me know if you try it out! </s>
