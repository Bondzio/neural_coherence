this depends on which windows operating system you have.
if 9x,either 95 or 98 you'll get 20gb,me or 2000 is up to 32 gb, and xp home is up to 250gb.
you may need to purchase vcom partition commander(external program) to get use of the 250gb.
when win xp formats a hard drive it sets aside a small portion for boot.
also if you don't tell winxp to format it all it won't.
hope this helps.
