thank's for your input.
and to answer your questions: &quot;question is....why do you want to do this ?&quot; for two reasons.
1. i've made more space than a gigabyte free since i've shrunk the backup partition because wasn't in use.
2. i'm paranoid about having as much free space as i can manage without having to skim down on progams and stuff too much.
you'd probably be amazed at some of the things i use on my laptop(s).
&quot;before going further....have you backed up your data ?&quot; not yet, but i'm about to.
thanks for your concern.
i guess that i'm going to have to put the space-getting on hold for now, since the wireless internet capabilities have recently given out on me.
that's why i took so long to respond.
i typed this on my other laptop.
thanks for all the help, deven
