i have a computer similiar to yours, mines is equipped with a anthlon xp 2400+ 2.0 ghz.
and i have 640 mb.
or ram, a geforce fx 5700ve, 160 gb.
of hard drive space, and this sucka really isn't a good gaming performer for me.
if gaming isn't your thing, then your pc is quite decent, but if you game, then you could just forget about it........
