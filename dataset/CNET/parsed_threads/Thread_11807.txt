<s> Brought a second hand desktop just last week. </s>
<s> A Compaq Deskpro with a PIII 800mhz processor and running windows XP Home. </s>
<s> Everything was going great until the keyboard and mouse started behaving stupidly. </s>
<s> The keyboard wouldn't work with the mouse plugged in. </s>
<s> I changed keyboards, and it now works. </s>
<s> However, the mouse is still behaving erratically. </s>
<s> When I boot, everything works fine, then the mouse will freeze a couple of times, then start, and then stop working all together. </s>
<s> It's very annoying, to say the least. </s>
<s> The only temporary fix is to restart windows, but I cant do that every time to mouse freezes as it usually does it less than two minutes into running. </s>
<s> Any help would be wonderful. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Did you remove the case and dust it out, clean off the heatsinks, check the fans? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> How are you handling SPYWARE? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I havent cleaned the case out - will do first thing. </s>
<s> Spyware - PC hasn't been hooked up to network yet, so no internet = no spyware - the hard drive I formatted as soon as I got it. </s>
<s> btw the lights on the keyboard + mouse come on, then says error 301 keyboard not plaugged in or something like that before even hit's windows at boot - mouse stopped working altogether under windows, though laser is on and mouse works ith other machines. </s>
<s> What should I clean it with? </s>
<s> Ok, so I opened it up and cleaned all the dust out of it - amazing amount by the way, especially in the heatsink for the CPU. </s>
<s> Turned it on, said my prayers and - the keyboard didn't work, the machine wouldn't boot to windows - am lloking at getting a USB keyboard/mouse now. </s>
