hi,everyone, i am looking for a new desktop and need some advice.
currently my computer is hook up to tv as the monitor and i feel the video card is not good enough because it is blurry and i have tried to change the setting, but it still not clear on file name but all other looks fine.
i always have a hard time to see the file name on the desktop.
so what kind of video card is good when the desktop is hook up to the tv.
also if i brought a new pc that don't have s-video card to hook up to the tv, can i take the s-video card from the old pc and install to the new pc.
i will appreciated if anyone can give me some advice on what to look for when i shop around for a new pc.
many thanks
