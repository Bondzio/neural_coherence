1.1.1	Hello, I recently had my 3YO WD internal HD die on me and I replaced it with the WD3200AAKS model.	St
1.1.2	From the onset I noticed a slight slowdown in performance and a progressively louder noise coming from the HD.	St
1.1.3	I've got a 3YO Dell XPS Gen 5, OS is Winxp and 4GB DDR RAM.	St
1.1.4	I'm wondering if there's anything I can really do?	St
1.1.5	It clearly is spinning loudly because the sound will increase as I add more workload to it.	St
1.1.6	If I so much as look at graphic intensive stuff it'll start getting louder and louder and it's driving me insane.	St
1.2.1	Too bad your old drive model wasn't shared.	St
1.2.2	Looking at the specs at http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.asp?DriveID=299 I see the 2mS seek time will make this a fast but different sounding drive from what most would have had.	St
1.2.3	Also the noise level is pretty high at Seek Mode 0	St
1.3.1	Larger sized HDs when they get spinning will make slightly more noticeable sounds(noise).	St
1.3.2	However, it shouldn't be confused with &quot;resonance&quot; from metal-to-metal contact and/or tray setups.	St
1.3.3	If resonance use a small thin rubber/plastic washer between screw and HD where they screw down.	St
1.3.4	If tray type, use some foam between slot and guide to help there.	St
1.3.5	if the HD itself is making the noise by simply being ON, its not the seek&fetch data cycles.	St
1.3.6	if the noise is too much and it seems to work OK, then use the RMA process to return under warranty.	St
1.3.7	Heat kills HDs and they can make noise before they die, so have a back-up plan in place to save critical data and/or a full image.	St
1.3.8	If heat the cause of HD failure, be sure to clean innards and provide better cooling as the problem will continue.	St
1.3.9	Also, verify that any screws aren't &quot;real tight&quot; they need be only snug.	St

1.4.1	Thanks for the advice.	St
1.4.2	The sound is like the HD is revving.	St
1.4.3	I'm using HD Tune Pro and I've been on the pc for about 30 minutes and the temp is 102 degrees fahrenheit.	St
1.4.4	I'm not sure if that's good or bad.	Res
1.4.5	I'm using their acoustic management option and the pc is not making that revving noise.	St
1.4.6	I guess that confirms that it is a spinning issue.	St
1.4.7	At least I can Would a cooling system help?	St
1.4.8	It's a Dell XPS Gen 5 which has 4 HD slots (only 1 is being used).	St
1.5.1	Increased system cooling should benefit the whole system.	St
1.5.2	While you have 1 HD present, the system case is putting out the heat and &quot;airflow&quot; is key to maintaining a desired level.	St
1.5.3	Thus, be sure any dust bunnies are cleaned out, the cables/harness is routed well, any possible frt.	St
1.5.4	panel filter/inlets are clear and all fans are working now.	St
1.5.5	Add an extra fan(s) to &quot;exhaust&quot; if empty placement is available.	St
1.5.6	Check out: http://www.frozencpu.com/ for what's out there and others.	St
1.5.7	Cooling in general is always a plus.	St
1.5.8	tada -----Willy	St
