provided you have no sata hd issues, then using this adapter has allowed access to data.
this adapter is far more flexible than a simple usb enclosure, but check it out if it fits yours needs.
goto:  look for ada-2020 or google for a picture/example.
i've already used in cases like yours and the other way around too, getting laptop hd data.
plus, as a quick way to test cd drives as well.
