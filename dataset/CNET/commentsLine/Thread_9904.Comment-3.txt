first off, do you have installation discs for the sound card, video card, and modem?
if you do, it should just be a matter of putting the discs in and just follow the directions (as long as you have &quot;auto-run&quot; on for your cd drive) if you do not have the cd's for these devices and they are all installed from the factory (from dell, gateway, etc...) then all the drivers are on the resource cd's that came with your system.
(the cd's should have information on the cd itself telling you what is on each disc.)
you might have to dig around in the cd contents sometimes to find them, but they should all be there.
just find the drivers for your particular cards and extract them to the folder specified when clicking the extract button.
from there it should just be a matter of following along with the set-up program that runs.
hope this helps
