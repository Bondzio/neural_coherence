note down the beep sequence and then get to dell support website.
that sequence will explain what problem its having as determined by the bios error beep code.
be absolutely sure of the beeps, 4-5 beeps seems not so.
if it sounds like long and short beeps, note that also.
then at dell, for your model#, proceed to determine cause.
as another poster mentioned, if you have warranty, use it.
