They took all of there networking configuration from 98SE and entered them into XP Pro. The host PC has an IP address of 192.168.0.12. The other three are .13, .14, .11. All subnet masks are set to 255.255.255.0. Default gateway is set to 192.168.1.1. There are 3 shared folders, G,H,P. When the non-hosts try to access info on G:, a message shows that this drive is set as &quot;Read Only&quot;. H and P can be accessed with no trouble. This happens when the non-host PC users are trying to access Word Perfect files on G:. Also, when the files are edited on the host PC, the other PCs don't see the change. We have tried to remove the read- only status, but it doesn't stick. Can anyone help? Thanks, Paul

You may respond &quot;it worked before&quot;, but it's still an error. As to the read-only thing, XP is a new ball game with &quot;users and permissions.&quot; The XP that is serving will have to have the users added with the same passwords as on the client machines.

I can tell that without added ROUTE ADD commands, given the LAN NETMASK is 255.255.255.0 and the Lan IPs are in the 192.168.1.x range, then that gateway is that &quot;x&quot; value from 1 to 254. But I can't tell with the supplied info which machine it is. I'm only pointing out this is a flawed entry with the information supplied. My hunch is that the NEW way of NT/2000/XP/2003 and that users have to be added to each machine can be daunting until you get it all entered on each machine. Bob
