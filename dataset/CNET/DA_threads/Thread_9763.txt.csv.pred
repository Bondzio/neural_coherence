1.5.1	Thanks for the tip .	St
1.5.2	I downloaded the wizard and received the following message for both drives : & quot ; Either the device is malfunctioning or the wizard can not determine the problem. & quot ; I guess it 's not an either/or , but both .	St
1.5.3	Here is the log file that was generated .	St
1.5.4	Perhaps it has some clues .	St

1.6.1	R. Proffitt - I think I clicked on the wrong & quot ; reply & quot ; link and my response to your suggestion is shown above your reply .	St
1.6.2	I appreciate your patience and your reward will be in heaven .	Polite
1.7.1	See how another solved it at http : //www.tech-archive.net/Archive/WinXP/microsoft.public.windowsxp.general/2006-02/msg06669.html	Ques
1.8.1	Thanks for the lead .	St
1.8.2	I had already uninstalled a previous burner ( only files I found still around were log files ) .	St
1.8.3	No new driver updates available .	St
1.8.4	AUTOFIX still does n't help .	St
1.8.5	I 'm becoming very concerned - nothing seems to help and I do n't even want to consider new drives as I do n't think two drives would mechanically fail at the same time .	St
1.8.6	I 'm trying to be hopeful that there 's still something I can do to correct the problem .	St
1.8.7	Any other suggestions ?	Ques
1.8.8	- I 'll try anything .	St
1.9.1	1 .	St
1.9.2	Tried one drive at a time .	St
1.9.3	2 .	St
1.9.4	Removed the usual UPPER and LOWER FILTERS ( read http : //support.microsoft.com/kb/314060 ) 3 .	St
1.9.5	Booted SAFE MODE and headed to the Device Manager to delete ALL CD/DVD drives there then rebooted .	St
1.9.6	4 .	St
1.9.7	Noted if the BIOS sees the drives .	St
1.9.8	Remember if the BIOS does n't find them , neither will Windows .	St
1.10.1	I appreciate you sticking with me on this .	Polite
1.10.2	I tried items 1 , 3 , & 4 with no success .	St
1.10.3	I did n't attempt 2 because of the warning : & quot ; uninstall all CD or DVD writing or recording programs & quot ; before using this method .	St
1.10.4	I have a writing program that was pre-installed on my computer with the OS ( program called Click to DVD ) .	St
1.10.5	If I delete it I do n't know how to re-install as I do n't have any install discs .	St
1.10.6	At any rate , I see that this procedure is for resolving the error if the drive is missing from My Computer , but shows in Device Manager with a conflict .	St
1.10.7	This is n't my problem .	St
1.10.8	The drives are shown in My Computer and there is no conflict shown in Device Manager .	St
1.10.9	Am I running out of options ?	Ques
1.11.1	As to removing the software items I 've ignored that and found the only loss was something that did n't work well .	St
1.11.2	Good luck , Bob	Polite
1.12.1	Bob , thanks for all your help .	Polite
1.12.2	Unfortunately for us novices , & quot ; something that [ does n't ] work well & quot ; is more than an & quot ; only loss. & quot ; I guess it 's because we often do n't know how to correct something that 's not working well ( the difference between & quot ; not working well & quot ; and & quot ; not working & quot ; is blurred .	St
1.12.3	I hope you know how much your work is appreciated on this forum .	St
1.12.4	I 've learned a lot in the process .	St
1.12.5	Thanks again .	St
1.12.6	I 'll report back on any success I get ( it might be of value for others in the same boat . )	St
