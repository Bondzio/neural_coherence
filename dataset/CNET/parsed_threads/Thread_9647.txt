<s> I have a Hitachi external hard drive that worked fine one morning and stopped working when I came back from college. </s>
<s> It simply does not power on at all, as if the power cable is not even connected. </s>
<s> I have tried it on two different computers the unit is definitely not receiving power So my question is, would buying a new enclosure save my data? </s>
<s> I use my external hard drive to stream music and video from my Nintendo Wii and it's imperative that I save it. </s>
<s> A new enclosure would have to conform to the specs of 3.5&quot; and 2TB. </s>
<s> I can't afford data recovery and I want to save my approaching 1TB worth of content. </s>
<s> This is it and thanks for any help I've had trouble finding answers. </s>

<s> Why? </s>
<s> Because we can't try it. </s>
<s> But if you want your data, it's the best 20 buck gamble you can take today. </s>

<s> Sounds as if the dc inverter has failed (the adapter that plugs into a/c power). </s>
<s> If you take the unit to a Radio Shack or someone who has a volt ohm meter handy this is a very easy thing to check., there is a pretty good chance that the drive itself is fine. </s>
