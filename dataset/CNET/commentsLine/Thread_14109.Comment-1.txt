i was given a hp pavilion that has the network card on the mb.
i replaced the card with a netgear fa 311 pci adapter when the original decided it had worked long enough.
however, i can't get the computer to recognize the new card.
i have tried uninstalling and disabling the old card but i get a &quot;code 10&quot; error message - whatever that means.
do i need to get into the bios to change stuff and if so how do i do that?
i have windows xp but i don't know the model number of the computer; it's not anywhere on the case.
hp support told me to contact netgear and netgear doesn't seem to know what i'm talking about.
i appreciate your help; the kids are driving me nuts with only one computer connected to the web.
(talk about spoiled!
when i was a kid computers were made out of rocks and you had to use your feet to stop the car.)
thanks.
