<s> I recently upgraded to a new case and power supply after I switched everything over to the new case on boot I get no video. </s>
<s> Tried multiple screens and different connections still nothing. </s>
<s> I tried 2 other graphics cards and still nothing. </s>
<s> Then I noticed USB devices were not working . </s>
<s> Even my USB expansion card . </s>
<s> So a total of 12 USB slots failed. </s>
<s> I tried changing different mobo connections and it still failed. </s>
<s> On start up I heard beeping but I fixed that one of my memory sticks went now I don't get anything. </s>
<s> My fans HD CPU all start up my mobo says its getting power . </s>
<s> Has anyone seen this before and know what to do? </s>
<s> I'm most likely thinking my mobo died but if any one could help I'd appreciate it </s>
<s> I set out a square of cardboard then place the motherboard, power supply and a few items on that for a test. </s>
<s> Too often I find case shorts to be the cause. </s>
<s> Most common? </s>
<s> The builder installed a few too many mounting studs for the motherboard. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Never tried the cardboard method but it isn't the studs I triple check them every time after I did that on my first build. </s>
<s> I replaced the new mounting screws with my old ones to see if that worked. </s>
<s> Still got nothing </s>
<s> I think you know why I remove the case as well. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You need to tear down as Robert explained and now T/S the setup. </s>
<s> The case is now out of the picture with the cardboard setup. </s>
<s> Further, you reduce connected items to make the simplest system, so all those USB devices, not needed for now other than mouse&kybd. </s>
<s> if so equipped. </s>
<s> Take it from there and check it out. </s>
<s> If after all this and it still doesn't work, then get a new mtrbd.. </s>
<s> However, verify that all connections are proper to include trying a different PSU. </s>
<s> verify the video connection for power at mtrbd. </s>
<s> is OK. </s>
<s> The P4(?) </s>
<s> connection, check wiring. </s>
<s> With reduced setup you could use the old PSU to test. </s>
<s> You also mentioned that a ram stick was askew, you do know that may cause that bank of ram to be held down as bad or minor boo-boo but the effect is no video because it is such a low level of booting-up it causes it to have no display. </s>
<s> You may want to simply wait for 5-10min. </s>
<s> and see if it displays anything as it tries to negotiate pass an error condition. </s>
<s> Why, because the bios maybe setup to &quot;stop on any error&quot;, but its too late to change because no display. </s>
<s> You could try resetting the bios to &quot;defaults&quot; using the clear CMOS pins. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Tore it down like you guys recommended . </s>
<s> Unplugged everything except mouse and keyboard. </s>
<s> Have no on board graphics so I tried 3 different cards ... Not at same time. </s>
<s> Used different connections each time and swapped the ram around even going down to one at a time I did find a bad stick and removed. </s>
<s> None of this worked though unfortunately. </s>
<s> So I ordered a new mobo. </s>
<s> Tried it all again still having same problems. </s>
<s> Is it possible it could be the processor? </s>
<s> I cleared about CMOS pins and battery for a little was getting same results. </s>
<s> All of this was done on cardboard with only essentials attached. </s>
<s> Also tried hooking everything up for no reason but to try it lol. </s>
