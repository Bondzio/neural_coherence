there appears to be an issue with nec dual layer drives and itunes 5.x i have 3 machines set up with 8x and 16x drives and itunes 5.x will see them, the cd diagnostics show its fine, but it gives me a &quot;cd burner or software not found...&quot; error message.
there are lots of folks with this issue.
if you can install ver 4.9 it would probably work.
