i have 2 western digital raptors, sata, that i've been running in raid0 (1 as the boot drive, c:, and the other as a data drive, d:).
recently, my motherboard died and i need to get the required data off the drives.
my wife's computer is my old pc, which is a p4s8x and has a fasttrack raid controller.
my question is, how do i attach one of my sata drives to her already-running computer and have it be visible in windows so i can copy/paste files i need?
i do not want to format the drive.
i added the drive to the computer, and it was detected by the fasttrack controller and it wants me to setup an array for the drive.
what should i do?
if i setup an array for the drive, will it be visible in bios & windows, or do i need to do more?
will this erase the data?
thanks!
