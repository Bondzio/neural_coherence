Didn't they announce that all Mac's produced as of now are going to be using Intel processors. Would that mean that they would have to reconfigure the Mac OS X for it to work. If they can do it to work on Intel processors, then would that mean that I can use Mac OS X on a PC?

Yes, the did reconfigure the Mac OS to run on the Intel processor. Would be a little silly to build a machine and have no OS that would run on it. No, they were clever enough to prevent you from running OS X on any piece of PC hardware. Only a machine built by Apple is capable of running OS X correctly. But you are welcome to try P

Well I would buy a Mac, but I only can't becuase I don't want to have to buy a completely new set programs once again. Especially, I would have to buy Microsoft Office and thats super expensive.

Check any of the box manufacturers and spec out the iMac 20&quot; (Intel or G5) and you will find that to purchase one with similar specs will cost you the same, if not more. Not having Windows on your machine is worth $800. P
