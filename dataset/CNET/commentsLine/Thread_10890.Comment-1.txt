hi there, beginning of next year we will be on the road again for 12 months.
this time we are considering to bring a tablet instead of our small notebook.
we are a bit overwhelmed with all this different tablet models which are currently on the market.
maybe someone could give us advice for what kind of functions etc.
we should look in a tablet.
we would like to use the tablet for the following: in the offline modus (if we don't have wi-fi or not strong enough connection): - transferring pictures from our camera's to external hard drive/usb stick (camera's have sd card, might change if i buy a new camera) - connecting external hard drive to tablet to watch movie's etc.
- using a bit word/xls, for budget, lists and so on in the online modus: - skype - internet - upload pictures to blog tablet size: 7'' or preferable larger weight: max 17.5 ounces/500g camera: for skype good battery life price: up to $500 thanks tinka
