I'm not a electronics techie but I tried, couldn't find anything wrong even when using a magnifying glass.
i put it back togethr and it does the same thing.
Looks like i'm going to have to buy me another monitor which really ticks me off since this one is only about 3 years old.
Samsung is no longer an option and i'm going to go with a 19&quot; this time.
I just use it for surfing no game playing etc.
here, any suggestions?
Thanks again for the help......
