<s> What equipment is required to do VPN? </s>
<s> Can you just use the two computers you want to network? </s>
<s> -Thanks </s>
<s> No special equipment is needed. </s>
<s> If your running XP on both ends, the necessary protocols are already there. </s>
<s> You simply need to set up the VPN. </s>
<s> So, I would like to connect to a server at my school. </s>
<s> Do I need to set it up here, and at the school? </s>
<s> The school's server needs to allow incoming VPN connections. </s>
<s> You then need to create a VPN connection on your pc. </s>
<s> Your VPN will find the remote server via IP address or FQDN -Fully Qualified Domain Name. </s>
<s> So, just out of curiosity can you set up VPN between two different computers. </s>
<s> Say like have two XP home editions connect without a server, just the pc? </s>
<s> For an example say you wanted to connect to a relatives computer through VPN. </s>
<s> Could you do this with just the PC and DSL? </s>
<s> This would work fine if the computer has a static IP address. </s>
<s> You could still connect without having a static IP but you would have to call the relative each time you want to connect and have them tell you the current IP address. </s>
<s> Some ISP's don't offer static addresses or they charge you more for the convenience. </s>
<s> But if they have a static IP, simply create a VPN on your computer and then configure the relative's computer to act as a VPN server. </s>
<s> How do you find the IP address? </s>
<s> Also, how do you configure as a VPN server? </s>
<s> -Thanks, I very much appreciate your posts!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Ok, I found the IP addresses and both of our computers have in our home have the same one. </s>
<s> Will this be the same as on the schools computers if I want to connect to a school server? </s>
<s> -Thanks </s>
<s> It's qite simple. </s>
<s> Open Network Connections from Control Panel. </s>
<s> Under Network Tasks, click, Create A New Connection. </s>
<s> The Wizard appears and you simply follow the prompts. </s>
<s> Choose to set up an advanced connection. </s>
<s> Regarding finding IP addresses -open command prompt and type ipconfig /all to see info relating to all the network connections you have. </s>
<s> Or simply ipconfig if there is only 1 computer. </s>
<s> Hello, I want set up vpn connection over more computers and more ip, is there any one who know more about this. </s>
<s> Would be great! </s>
<s> Send me a message and ill respond quick back to you. </s>
