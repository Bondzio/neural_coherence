1.1.1	I 'm building a PC for someone else and I want to make sure everything 's compatible before ordering .	St
1.1.2	I 've checked and it looks like they work , but I wan na make sure .	St

1.2.1	not be compatible .	Res
1.2.2	I do n't like buying cases with the Power Supply because the supply is usually a low bid item .	St
1.2.3	I know that Enermax makes power supplies , BUT they make cheapies and good ones .	St
1.2.4	The good ones have the & quot ; true Power & quot ; in their name , meaning that they actually provide the full rating 100 % of the time .	St
1.2.5	For the cheapies the ratings are for the peak wattage .	St
1.3.1	BUMP .	St
1.3.2	Any other advice ?	Ques
1.4.1	Goto the mtrbd .	St
1.4.2	support website .	Polite
1.4.3	In some cases they provide a listing of known good tested compoents that work with thier mtrbd.. Usually , that implies at least ram , but other componets may need clarification .	St
1.4.4	Besides the website provides the known specs on what it supports .	St
1.4.5	Most off-shelf componets are going to work if compatible ( usually are ) and rarely do you see an issue .	St
1.4.6	The only time you get into trouble if you OC or speed tweak too far , but defaults work well .	St
1.4.7	Power supplies are the foundation of a good and *stable* system so if flaky problems arise , look into that area if not in the beginning but later within 3-4 mo .	St
1.4.8	is n't uncommon to see reboots or an further added componet tip the stable scale .	St
1.4.9	Of course do n't forget good cooling of the system case and componets , this too can add stress that overtime will degrade componets or just generally start flakiness .	St
1.4.10	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
