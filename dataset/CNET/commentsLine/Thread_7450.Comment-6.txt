i am located in the us as well, so finding a drive i think is a rather easy feat.
the question had more to do with i did not know what i could replace the drive with and was looking for recommendations (size, type, manufacturer, etc.)
can i replace an ide drive with a sata?
as for transferring the data, if the original drive worked, then i would have no problem in transferring data myself.
so, i figure if the data is recoverable, then i will happily pay to have the data recovered and transferred.
thank you to everyone who has replied thus far.
it has been very helpful.
