you'll want to use a bluetooth gps unit for this.
i didn't reveal all but i am on a team that developed some gps feature for a product i won't reveal.
as to what the fcc has to do with this is everything in this country.
you pass or you can't sell it.
your question is one that would happen from folk that didn't know that.
i must keep all that testing and such stuff short so i'll stop again on that here.
so no, there is no chip for this.
if there was you would have found it.
but i have used those bluetooth gps units for setups that involve laptops.
