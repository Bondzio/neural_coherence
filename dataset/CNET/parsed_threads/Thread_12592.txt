<s> I'm trying to wirelessly connect an XBOX 360 and Panasonic TV with Viera Cast to a network. </s>
<s> Right now I only have a cable modem with my desktop connected to it through ethernet cable. </s>
<s> My idea is to plug a wireless router to the cable modem and the desktop to the router again via ethernet cable. </s>
<s> In another room I would set up a wireless access point and connect the TV and XBOX to its ethernet ports via cable again. </s>
<s> My confusion is, do I need to connect a second access point to the wireless router to enable communication between the two or can the access point (with TV and XBOX) talk directly with the wireless router? </s>
<s> Also, can the TV and XBOX access the internet at the same time using this set up? </s>
<s> Thanks for any input. </s>
<s> I would also appreciate any suggestions for specific equipment to accomplish the described scenario. </s>
<s> It's very close to what you describe. </s>
<s> There are ways to do what you are trying to do that might be easier. </s>
<s> Go to Linksys web site and look at some of their hardware, specifically gaming adapter hookups hardwire and wireless and see what you think. </s>
<s> Good luck and have fun! </s>
