1.1.1	I do n't have much experience with networking and usually find this very frustrating .	St
1.1.2	There 's no simple & quot ; on & quot ; setting .	St
1.1.3	I do n't even know where to begin .	St
1.1.4	Anyone want to help walk me through ?	Ques
1.2.1	Since I do n't research devices , the question would be , does the modem incorporate a router ?	Ques
1.2.2	And does this router contain a wireless radio ?	Ques
1.2.3	If the answer is no to the router , you need to purchase a wireless router to attach to the modem .	St
1.2.4	Connect thus : Modem - & gt ; router - & gt ; PC .	St
1.2.5	Please answer the first two questions .	St
1.3.1	Yes .	St
1.3.2	The Modem incorporates a 802.11g wireless router and broadcasts a signal that can allow 255 users to receive .	St
1.3.3	But like I mentioned above , there 's no & quot ; on & quot ; setting , there 's a whole lot of settings that were n't in any of my previous modems .	St
1.4.1	Is there such ?	Ques
1.4.2	Installation CD ?	Ques
1.4.3	More settings because the modem contains the router .	St
1.4.4	In general you access the router ( wired ) , you 'll need to find the documentation for the specific IP address used .	St
1.4.5	Generally it will be 192.168.x.x .	St
1.4.6	After you enter the router setup you navigate to the wireless settings .	St
1.4.7	Wireless on should be the default setting .	St
1.4.8	Does your PC have wireless capability ?	Ques
1.4.9	If so have you searched for wireless networks ?	Ques
1.4.10	I 'm really not prepared to give the full tutoral for your specific modem/router .	St
1.4.11	It should come with the setup instructions .	St
1.4.12	Not that I do n't want to help , but I decline to duplicate any existing documentation .	St
1.5.1	The CD that came with the modem/gateway contains the installation manual .	St
1.5.2	It is an amazing 41 pages long and , I think , personally written by the techs at 3BTECH .	St
1.5.3	I followed all the instructions .	St
1.5.4	( ( ( Yes my laptop has built in WiFi and a switch on the front to Enable/Disable .	St
1.5.5	The switch is Enabled and I can usually see 2-4 other networks . ) ) )	St
1.5.6	My laptop is a Toshiba Satallite A215 , AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual-Core TK-57 1.9 Ghz , 2 GB Ram , Vista Home SP2 .	St
1.5.7	And before I go further , I will say that I am a computer expert with very little knowledge of networking but a tad bit of experience with it ... trial and error type stuff mostly .	St
1.5.8	When I go to & quot ; 192.168.1.1 & quot ; I am redirected to & quot ; http : //192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/webcm & quot ; and there I log into my modem .	St
1.5.9	I find myself at the HOME page .	St
1.5.10	Across the top are tabs labeled Home , Wizard , Setup , Advanced , Wireless , Tools , Status , and Help .	St
1.5.11	I have played around with some settings under most of these to try and & quot ; turn on & quot ; the wireless and have n't gotten anywhere .	St
1.5.12	The HOME tab displays basic status information .	St
1.5.13	For this post I will qoute what I currently see .	St

1.5.17	The next TAB is SETUP where I have : ( HEADING ) LAN Setup LAN Configuration Ethernet Switch ( HEADING ) WAN Setup New Connection Modem ( followed by a green light ) Wizard Gamer Log Out The First thing I did was go to New Connection because there was n't clear instructions concerning the wireless feature in the manual .

1.8.1	If this modem/router is supplied by your ISP they can walk you through the setup .	St
1.9.1	Does Wireless RF : Disabled at the Home page mean that my wireless is turned off and not transmitting ?	Ques
1.10.1	Go to the Wireless option at the top of the page .	St
1.11.1	Nope , The modem is a 3rd party buy .	St
1.11.2	I got it for like $ 20 instead of AT & T 's $ 70 option .	St
