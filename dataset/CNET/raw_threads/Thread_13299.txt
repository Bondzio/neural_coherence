I'm looking for a AIO wireless for a new imac and once I access a review the opposite seems to be the case made by actual users which is confusing. Anybody have any suggestions? Thanks. JJ

While it is only single sided it has worked very well and worth noting. Be sure to have help to unpack or move the thing around as it is rather big but not bigger than my first PC. Bob
