1.1.1	Does anyone have any great ideas about how to get data OFF of my ext hd ?	Ques
1.1.2	The hard drive ( used successfully less than 1 month ) is definitely bad , and WD Support says & quot ; Well if possible , move all data off the drive .	St
1.1.3	At this point , you will need to have the drive replace. & quot ; Running WinXP , ext HD is Western Digital Passport 160gb .	St
1.1.4	Have tried connecting ext HD to a desktop , just in case problem was with my laptop - no good .	St
1.1.5	When I connect ext HD , all is good .	St
1.1.6	then once I start to actually use the thing , it eventually stops responding so i disconnect ext hd , reconnect , and resume .	St
1.1.7	generally , can copy a few files over to laptop before it stops , but with over 40gb already on there , i could be at this all year .	St
1.1.8	anyone have any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.9	I am furious about the cavalier attitude that WD is taking about my data !	St
1.2.1	To pull the drive out of the case and apply directly to the forehead .	St
1.2.2	Ahh no I mean the desktop 's internal spare IDE connection .	St
1.2.3	If you 're lucky , the PC will boot and see the drive and you can copy data off .	St
1.2.4	If not then software like Zero Assumption Recovery ( there 's a demo ) is tried .	St
1.2.5	- & gt ; About cavalier .	St
1.2.6	Where is your backup copy ?	Ques
1.2.7	Hard disks will fail .	St
1.2.8	You just do n't know when .	St
1.2.9	Bob	St
1.3.1	... technology ...	St
1.3.2	Sorry if it was n't clear in the original post - this is an external hard drive .	St
1.3.3	I certainly have had hard drives fail before , but I guess I figured that an external hard drive , expecially one used for 1 month , never bumped , in fact never traveled off of the desk would n't put me through this .	St
1.3.4	And , perhaps dumb questions , but what is the point of a 160gb ext hard drive if that has to be backed up as well ?	Ques
1.4.1	It 's still a hard disk .	St
1.4.2	And to add insult to injury I found I could corrupt many USB hard disks if they were used as supplied .	St
1.4.3	Many come with the somewhat unstable FAT32 formatting so just a matter of writing to the drive and pulling the USB cable can have the entire contents vanish .	St
1.4.4	It 's a magic trick I use to show how unstable these devices are when fresh out of the box .	St
1.4.5	I proceed to the second magic trick of wiping the drive , then making a NTFS partition .	St
1.4.6	While NTFS is not damage proof it certainly has faired better in my torture tests .	St
1.4.7	Do they tell you this ?	Ques
1.4.8	( no . )	Res
1.4.9	- & gt ; You 're right to think that it should n't need to be backed up but the truths remain that it 's a hard disk and could be the stock fragile FAT32 formatting .	St
1.4.10	Good luck in recovery .	Polite
1.4.11	Bob	St
1.5.1	Well , my stinky little hard drive must 've & quot ; understood & quot ; how angry I was - just after I posted , I managed to get ONE SOLID HOUR of the HD staying mounted !	St
1.5.2	Have managed to recover most of the data , so i got that goin ' for me .	St
1.5.3	which is nice .	Polite
1.5.4	thanks a million ( or maybe even 160gb ? ! )	Ques
1.5.5	for your assistance , bob .	St
1.5.6	since I do n't think I 'll be able to get my money back , guess I am stuck with getting a new WD HD .	St
1.5.7	will reformat to NTFS the second I get it home !	St
1.5.8	tangentially , do you have any opinions about one mfg or another ?	Ques
1.5.9	who makes the best ext HD ?	Ques
1.5.10	jenni , the soon-to-be NTFS magician	St
1.6.1	Hard disk cases that are well ventilated .	St
1.6.2	I like a small quiet fan but if it 's for some server room I do n't wince at a louder fan that pushes more air .	St
1.6.3	At the office most USB drives are self assembled units .	St
1.6.4	We get some drive on sale and then pick up some USB housing .	St
1.6.5	All of us know what a screwdriver is so it 's not very challenging to put the 2 parts together .	St
1.6.6	- & gt ; Let me share what I use to sync my stuff with my external drive .	St
1.6.7	SYNCBACK ( google.com ) gets this done for me .	St
1.6.8	Bob	St
1.7.1	I like it .	St
1.7.2	wish I had been daring enough to do that .	St
1.7.3	another question - would you suggest that i replace the HD , or iyho would reformatting to NTFS suffice ?	Ques
1.7.4	suggestions on & quot ; reading material & quot ; on reformatting to NTFS ?	Ques
1.7.5	i see that in & quot ; my computer & quot ; , if i right click on the hd and select & quot ; format & quot ; , there is the option to reformat to NTFS - does that reformat the same as from cmd ?	Ques
1.7.6	whoops , guess that is more than one question .	St
1.7.7	but you 'll bare with me , wo n't you , bob ?	Ques
1.7.8	jenni , the ever-curious	St
1.8.1	Use XP 's Disk Management ( see start , help ... ) and then remove the partition on said drive , create it fresh and let it quick format it .	St
1.8.2	If the drive is suspect I 'll later test it .	St
1.8.3	To manually start the disk scanner if your computer is formatted with the NTFS file system , run Chkdsk /f /r on the new drive letter ( start , run , CMD and enter the command there .	St
1.8.4	You must restart your computer before the disk scan begins .	St
1.8.5	Be sure to have a spare hour for it to work .	St
