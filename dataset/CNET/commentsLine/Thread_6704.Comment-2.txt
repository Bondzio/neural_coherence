well video and usb are two different items, so what do you really need fixed?
afterall, fixing one will not fix the other.
though you will be using the same method to fix either at least for now.
i suggest you return to the device mgr.
and point to the item in question and click on it and then reload the driver.
the driver source should be known so when reloading it knows where to seek it out.
once, that's done, reboot and check your work.
i also suggest when it comes to usb, remove all usb devices,even the kybd.
and mouse if so equipped.
if they mouse or kybd.
use the old ps/2 for then and reload the usb driver if supplied.
i hope you have the driver disc an/or the maker's latest driver for xp and allow it to be loaded.
i take for granted you the know the method to retrieve from the support maker website.
if the process fails, then you have other issues, please report back results.
