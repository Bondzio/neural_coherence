<s> I purchased a Dell Studio 1555 laptop with Windows Vista Home Premium SP1 in October. </s>
<s> After few days whenever i hibernated the system it automatically booted up after 1 or 2 hrs. </s>
<s> When I called the dell support for help they told that this is occuring because of hard disk failure and they will replace the hard disk. </s>
<s> The present hard disk contains the factory created system image which i want to migrate to my new hard disk but i have no idea on how to do that. </s>
<s> I tried using the Windows Backup and Resstore utility but it didn't helped as it was not backing up some of the vital files. </s>
<s> Please help as soon as possible as the dell technician to replace the hard disk will be coming in 3-4 days. </s>
<s> I'd remove it and put it into an external enclosure with a USB connection and collect data that way. </s>
<s> Unreadable areas of that hard drive are going to create problems for some backup software. </s>
<s> You do this manually. </s>
<s> I'd also think that, if he technician is going to replace the hard drive, he's also going to recreate the recovery partition during the restore process. </s>
<s> Hidden partitions are something that regular backup utilities don't deal with. </s>
<s> Some imaging/cloning software will but they may halt on read errors. </s>
<s> Get what you can manually. </s>
<s> No the technician will take away the old hard disk. </s>
<s> The manual copying is not working. </s>
<s> I tried and tested it by installing Vista on VMware. </s>
<s> That's what I meant. </s>
<s> If something is corrupt in the OS or some of its components, you can't use this method. </s>
<s> You get a working machine to do that. </s>
<s> I haven't used an external drive as i am not having one. </s>
<s> I tried the windows backup and restored it on the virtual machine, but it didn't worked as all the files were not copied by the backup. </s>
<s> Then i manually copied all the files and tried it. </s>
<s> This one also doesn't worked. </s>
<s> When i executed the recovery application it gave error &quot;ACCESS TO FILE DENIED&quot;. </s>
<s> So i edited the permissions and restarted the application and this time it stopped responding. </s>
