I have a laptop with a Mobile Intel(R) 915GM/GMS embedded graphics card, and i just installed more RAM to the system, so I'd like to allocate more memory to the graphics card. I read the specs from Intel so i know its possible, but they failed to explain how one goes about doing it. Anyone have some ideas? (i checked the bios too... no luck there)
