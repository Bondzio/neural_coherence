Many systems from that time came with 250Watt power supplies and they were sufficient, more would be better, but if it has run for 3-4 years it probably was enough. If you needed to replace it you probably want to get a 350-400 Watt PSU, but unless you are having problems you don't benefit changing out a power supply on such an old system.

But I added the DVD RW and Second Hard Disk few days ago. The shop assistant asked me whether I wanted a 400W PSU also. I declined as I have already changed the original 200W PSU to a new one (250W P4 Ready)10 months ago. Some people tell you 250Watts is enough others insist on something more powerful! I just don't want to spend money on something not useful. Thanks for your added input. Poltonis
