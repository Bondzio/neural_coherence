I was just wondering if everything will be compatible and work fine. Here's the list: Case: ENERMAX Blue Aluminum ATX Mid Tower Case With 400W PSU, Model &quot;10MCS-56881LBFS-D3&quot; -RETAIL Motherboard: Intel &quot;BOXD915PCYL&quot; 915P Chipset Motherboard For Intel LGA 775 CPU -RETAIL Processor: Intel LGA 775 Pentium 4 520 2.8 GHz, 800MHz FSB, 1MB L2 Cache, Hyper Threading Technology - Retail Memory: Crucial 240-pin DIMM 512 DDR2 from crucial.com Video Card: ATI RADEON 9800 PRO Video Card, 256MB DDR, 256-bit, DVI/TV-Out, 8X AGP -RETAIL Floppy Drive: NEC 1.44MB Black Internal Floppy Drive, OEM CD-ROM Drive: Samsung Black 52X32X52 CD-RW Drive, Model SW-252SENB, OEM Bulk Hard Drive: Western Digital 120GB 7200RPM SATA Hard Drive, Model WD1200JD, OEM Drive Only Thank you.

I've changed it to: ATI Radeon X700 PRO Video Card, 256MB DDR, 128-Bit, DVI/TV-Out, PCI-Express, Model &quot;100-437402&quot; -RETAIL

In Doom 3 for example, an Athlon 64 3000+( $133 for the socket 754, or $150 for the socket 939 ) beats a $780 Pentium 4 3.2 ghz EE. http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=2149&p=7 It is also a great performer for other games and general use. http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=2065&p=8 The socket 754 Athlon 64 3000+ is cheaper than the 939 version, and the 754 motherboard is also cheaper, but the 939 motherboard will give more room for future upgrades, and a 90nm socket 939 will probably use less power and run cooler than a 130 nm socket 754 one. It doesn't make sense to even consider a 2.8 ghz (520) Pentium 4 at $162, when for less you can get an Athlon 64 3000+ which beats a Pentium 4 3 ghz (or even a much faster P4) in most games. http://techny.com/articles.cfm?getarticle=606&go=0.53769656
