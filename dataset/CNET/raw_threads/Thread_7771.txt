My cable provider (Cox) told me they have had many problems with this modem not working. To make matters worse D-link has very poor customer service. After shipping the modem back at my expense, they are taking over 2 weeks to ship out a replacement. Would not recommend this product to anyone.

Dlink must mass produce the product, box it all up and expect to fix it later with firmware updates we get to install. Some consumers will not or can not deal with this and the product must be returned. You did the right thing. Bob
