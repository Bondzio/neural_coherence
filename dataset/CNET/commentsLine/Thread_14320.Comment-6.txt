hello again, i've accidentally found the make of my computer (and model number as well i think) i was looking for something else and went into system from control panel.
this is what it said: system.
microsoft windows xp professional.
version 2002. sp2.
computer.
amd athlon(tm)xp 2600+ 1.25ghz 256 mb of ram.
sounds pretty impressive to me, (how sad am i??
lol.)

kiai xx
