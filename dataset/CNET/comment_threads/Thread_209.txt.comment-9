Assuming that your Windows 95 PC doesn't have a CD-burner and doesn't support USB-sticks, your options are limited: 1.
Use floppy.
2.
Get the hard disk out, put it in an external enclosure, connect that to your XP-machine or laptop and copy all you need from it.
You are very lucky that such an old Windows 95 computer still works and you didn't yet loose your documents.
