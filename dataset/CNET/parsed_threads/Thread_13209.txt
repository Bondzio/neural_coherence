<s> The title says everything. </s>
<s> I have an nVidia ASUS GTX 460 graphics card that was working fine before. </s>
<s> Whenever I pop the CD in that came with it, the drivers won't install, and when I download them from the nVidia webpage, I try to install them and it says &quot;Unable to detect graphics card.&quot; Everything's plugged in, considering I didn't unplug any cables through the reformat session. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Check the card and how it is fitted in the slot. </s>

<s> I find myself installing motherboard drivers before the video card can be found. </s>
