<s> My friend just bought a computer and his having problems with it. </s>
<s> Computer specs: AMD 2500 atlon xp 512 DDRram Onboard Graphic card. </s>
<s> Everything works fine however every program that he needs to send like MSN,AOL, Email it freezes his program for like 10 -20 sec then returns normal. </s>
<s> Any Suggestions, I have no clue what would cause his Appz to freeze when he sends stuff using AIM, MSN and email. </s>
<s> Could it be something set in the Bios, or could it be bad Ram, the computer works like a charm when he doesn't &quot;send&quot;. </s>
<s> Forgot to say also he is still using win98 </s>
<s> Your post doesn't tell if an antivirus program like Norton 2004 is involved or what email software is used. </s>
<s> The delay can be the antvirus program doing its work. </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> He does uses Norton 2003 and for emails he uses AOL Email and Hotmail. </s>
<s> and MSN for insta messeging someone it will freeze each time he sends a msg </s>
<s> The issue here is that AOL doesn't share their knowledge base. </s>
<s> I don't use their software either. </s>
<s> Looks like you should call AOL. </s>
<s> You are paying for the support and should use it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> yea AOL for all I am concern sucks, but its not my problem, its my friends PC and him to deal with it. </s>
