i'll try to make this short.
i bought a digital camcorder and realized that i don't have a dvd burner on my desktop comp.
i purchased a mad dog external dvd burner 18x dual format that i have not connected yet.
my computer only has usb 1 ports.
i have been lead to believe that the dvd burner will be real slow unless i use usb 2. i bought a usb2/ firewire pci card at radio shack.
after plugging it in the slot, the directions say to plug in the power supply to the card into the small 4 prong receptacle on the card.
no power cord was supplied nor are there any that seem to be unused in my computer.
there is a power plug unused that has 4 inline receptacles but that configuration would not match the 4 small square receptacle on the card.
is there a plug available for me to buy to power this card?
does it connect to that unsed 4 inline plug that is available in my pc?
is there a usb2 pci card that doesn't need a power supply?
