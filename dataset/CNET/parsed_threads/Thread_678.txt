<s> I have an HP w2207h and a computer without VGA or HDMI. </s>
<s> The monitor only has those two hookups and my computer only has DVI-D. </s>
<s> I bought a DVI-D to HDMI converter and it doesn't really work sometimes. </s>
<s> When I start the computer, the signal is inactive. </s>
<s> I turn off my computer and try connecting to my previous monitor that had a DVI-D hookup. </s>
<s> The signal is there. </s>
<s> Then I hookup the conveter to the HP, and the signal is there. </s>
<s> What's up with this? </s>
<s> Basically when I restart my computer or stand by for long periods, the monitor fails to communicate with my computer. </s>
<s> My configuration is this: Computer(GFX card w/ dual DVI-D ports) &gt; DVI-D to HDMI converter &gt; HDMI cable to monitor Please help me solve this problem, thanks! </s>
<s> I'm thinking this could be a driver issue, or the hardware isn't right. </s>
<s> Is there anything I could buy (&lt;$50 if possible) other than a new graphics card or motherboard that can give my computer a VGA or HDMI input? </s>
<s> You don't want to replace any component or card let's look at the failure mode. </s>
<s> &quot;Basically when I restart my computer or stand by for long periods, the monitor fails to communicate with my computer.&quot; For now, don't restart or stand by until you get a proper card. </s>
<s> Maybe its a driver but nothing suggests this is anything more than wishful thinking. </s>
<s> Sometimes you find owners that insist &quot;this should work&quot; but there is no support to be found and the choices are clear. </s>

<s> It's a XFX GeForce NVIDIA 8800GT, with dual DVI-D ports. </s>
<s> I'll try updating the drivers. </s>
