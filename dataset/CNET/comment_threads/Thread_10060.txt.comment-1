I'm running an Athlon64 3000+ on an ASUS A8N5X and have four sticks of Kingston Dual-Channel DDR400 RAM installed.
I updated my bios recently and also finally turned off the splash screen that appears and obstructs the actual POST screen.
There I noticed my DDR 400 is being detected as only DDR 333.
My question is what could be causing this?
I can manually set it to DDR 400 but I would rather it automatically detect it as such.
Any help/insight into this issue would be appreciated.
