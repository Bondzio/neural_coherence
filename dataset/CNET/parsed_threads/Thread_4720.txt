<s> I have two computers. </s>
<s> One is on the East Coast of the US, the other is on the West Coast. </s>
<s> I need to be able to &quot;connect&quot; these two computers for the purpose of sharing drives. </s>
<s> I know all about Remote Desktop. </s>
<s> This is not what I'm looking for. </s>
<s> If I'm logged onto Computer A, I need for Computer B's disk resources to be viewable and accessible through the standard Windows Explorer as remote drives. </s>
<s> I've already: 1. unblocked TCP and UDP ports 135 through 139, and 445 in the firewall on both computers. </s>
<s> 2. completely disabled the router's firewall (one of the computers is hooked into a router; firewall has been disabled) 3. forwarded the relevant ports (noted above) in the router's config to the computer I would like to access. </s>
<s> ... no joy. </s>
<s> When I try to connect to the remote PC, it comes up not found. </s>
<s> I can ping it, and I can connect via remote desktop (so I also know port forwarding on the router is working). </s>
<s> But the standard &quot;net use&quot; and &quot;net view&quot; stuff is not working. </s>
<s> I am suspecting my ISPs (on either the east coast or west coast) are filtering the &quot;file and print sharing&quot; ports (i.e. </s>
<s> TCP + UDP 135 through 139 and 445), but trying to get a hold of someone at either ISP who knows about this stuff is impossible. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any experience with Comcast (West Coast) and Cablevision (East Coast), in terms of whether or not they filter traffic through these ports ? </s>
<s> ... or, does anyone have any other solutions ? </s>
<s> Again, I don't want to use remote desktop. </s>
<s> It's not practical for this purpose, and I don't want to set up an FTP server. </s>
<s> It needs to be a clean, simple solution that allows me (and my family) to see and access each computer's drives just as the local ones. </s>
<s> I really appreciate any assistance, but PLEASE don't offer advice about the inherent security risks of trying to do what it is I'm trying to do. </s>
<s> I am well aware of the risks and would prefer to keep this to a technical discussion rather than an advice post on the risks of file and print sharing over the internet. </s>
<s> Many thanks </s>
