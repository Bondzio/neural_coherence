Thanks Nerdyboy.
I am not quite that out of it.
I had found all of that and have gone to Radeon and the update downloads require service pack 2 which I have never installed.
Thanks for you help.
PS I cant install service pack 2 because an idiot tried to repartition my hard drive and I lost the recovery capabilities.
Just as an after thought.
Should I just go ahead and bite the bullet and buy the start up disks from Sony so I can straighten all this mess out.
