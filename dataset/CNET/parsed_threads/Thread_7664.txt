<s> I love my iPad overall but every couple of days I get shut out of a website I like because of Flash content. </s>
<s> I watch a lot of tennis and just discovered that my subscription to tennistv won't play on the iPad. </s>
<s> Bummer that means no watching live tennis unless I am at home. </s>
<s> That's sad for now...From a consumer point of view it really makes iPad useless, but HTML5, H.264 are the future. </s>
<s> Flash overheats your tablet, doesn't support touch based devices and eats your battery life. </s>
<s> Webmasters should really move on...anyways someone had to make this step, and Youtube,Vimeo, Netflix, Apple and many big names made it. </s>
<s> Thoughts on Flash </s>
<s> Apple has already sold 2 million units of iPad In the past 2 months and coservitively may sell 8 million units of iPads by the end of the year. </s>
<s> With these kind of numbers it would be crazy for C'net (or someone else) not to come up with a replacement for Adobe &quot;Flash or Reader)! </s>
