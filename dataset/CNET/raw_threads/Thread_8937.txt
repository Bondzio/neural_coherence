In the begining, there was one PC, with XP home, and an epsom RX560 connected via USB. Second pc, also XP home. Both connect to internet via cable router. Network works perfectly, can share files. Shared printer on first Pc, on second PC, went through Add printer menus, everything works perfectly, both PCs can print. Then added third PC, with XP Pro. Network works perfectly, can share files, see shared folders on other two pcs etc. Tried to install the printer on this PC - huge problems. I get error messages like printer is disconnected from server, invalid share name and error with printer spooler. Ran the help wizard, it said this is a known problem, you need to go into services and restart printer spooler and set it to automatic. However, it was set to automatic and was running, tried stopping and starting it, no difference. What else can I try ?
