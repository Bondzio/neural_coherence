your url for hp didn't work so i just went to partsurfer home and saw $495 for ome measly little stick.
either hp made a mistake, or they are really trying to rip you off.
your ram is pc-2700, and you want 512mb.
however, don't buy directly form the manufacturer(for any company) because you will have to pay m.s.r.p.
try this:  it's from viking, but they are still good.
