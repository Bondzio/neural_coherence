VAPCMD - I received the new Masscool unit yesterday and installed it last night.
My PC has been running ever since with no problems.
It looks like this fixed it.
I can't believe how quiet my system is now.
I guess the noise level must have been increasing gradually the last couple of years so I didn't notice the increase until I had something to compare it with.
I want to thank you for your help.
I really appreciate it.
Dan
