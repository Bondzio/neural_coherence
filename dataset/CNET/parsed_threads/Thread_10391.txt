<s> My mp830 had just printed something, than as something else was about to print, the device showed no power, and will not power on. </s>
<s> Some other users have recommended leaving it unplugged for an hour to discharge, than plugged it in. </s>
<s> This has not worked so far, thanks for any help. </s>
<s> You change the power cord and/or try another outlet. </s>
<s> After that, you can troubleshoot the printer's power supply if you have the knowledge and the tools. </s>
<s> Without tearing into it, an continuity test with the ohmmeter function of a DVM might show you if the transformer primary winding is open. </s>
<s> If so and you get lucky it might be just a bad fuse. </s>
<s> There's no way for anyone here...even those with the skills...to offer much without having the box in front of them so I can't be too optimistic when hearing these things. </s>
<s> Since the power cord plugs into the ptr. </s>
<s> and NOT a AC power wart, then that suggests any power issues are within the ptr. </s>
<s> As already stated to you, maybe a &quot;fuse&quot; has blown, check for that. </s>
<s> Otherwise, its a power ckt. </s>
<s> item within the ptr. </s>
<s> and you need repairs or order the AC assy. </s>
<s> as a possible fix, if you deem that will do. </s>
<s> If the Ac cord itself is at fault, replace with a similar one, that should be a low cost item. </s>
<s> I rarely find a bad AC cord, unless repeatedly stepped or mangled in some way. </s>
<s> If no easy fix or repair, than a new ptr. </s>
<s> should be considered. </s>

<s> I FINALLY FOUND IT !!!... </s>
<s> I had this same problem happen to me. </s>
<s> We have several of these we use in our office setting (we use the hell out of these printers - way past design life). </s>
<s> The one I use suddenly just died. </s>
<s> Couldn't get to power on, checked the PS and changed PS from another machine, disconnected for long time and then re-insert the PS. </s>
<s> Nothing... </s>
<s> Still dead. </s>
<s> I had a good machine that was running so I put that one in my place. </s>
<s> I decided to switch the print head since I knew that my old one was good... BAD MISTAKE... </s>
<s> I switched the printhead (machine powered on and head in maintenance position). </s>
<s> Right after putting in the ink cartridges, the machine went dead... </s>
<s> I immediately realized that it was the print head all along so I took it out and threw it straight in the round file. </s>
<s> Switched the print head back to the good one and tried powering on... DEAD... </s>
<s> I also pulled the PS and let it sit for 30 min and then put the PS back in... DEAD. </s>
<s> It looks like these power problems are being caused by defective print heads (I don't think it has anything to do with a built in page limit as my printer has gone way past what could be expected of it. </s>
<s> What pisses me off is that I just killed a perfectly good mp830 by putting that damn head in there. </s>
<s> Had a few of these printers around for parts and took the main board out of one of them and replaced the board in the fried printer and it works... </s>
<s> I'm printing as happy as a clam again. </s>
<s> The bottom line is a bad print head can fry the motherboard and then your only option is to throw that print head as far as you can and replace the main board... Having a couple of broken printers around is very helpful... </s>
