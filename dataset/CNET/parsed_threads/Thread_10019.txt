<s> Using 3 HP computers - one Desktop PC and two laptops. </s>
<s> Trying to share one printer, an HP PSC 1350V all in one. </s>
<s> Using a Netgear PS121 Mini-Print Server and all the computers are also hooked into a Netgear FVS318 VPN. </s>
<s> All the computers can send things to the printer with no problem, but need to have bi-directional capability for scans. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>

<s> The older all-in-one devices lose both the &quot;all&quot; and the &quot;in&quot; and become just &quot;one&quot; (print) when placed on a print server. </s>
<s> Just the way it works, can't be fixed. </s>

<s> You need a printer/scanner that comes with this capabilty. </s>
<s> Adding it later is painful for those that will not use Linux or other type servers... Bob </s>
