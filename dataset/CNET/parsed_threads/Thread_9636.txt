<s> I am having a problem installing a Geforce FX5500 AGP card in a Compaq Presario SR1420UK. </s>
<s> The machine is an AMD 3000, 512mb Ram with onboard graphics. </s>
<s> I have selected AGP/Onboard as the primary graphics in the BIOS but still no joy. </s>
<s> With the monitor plugged into the card when I switch on the monitor works while its going through its POST, when it starts to load up Windows (XP) the screen goes black. </s>
<s> Anyone any ideas from here? </s>
<s> Windows looks to be using the drivers for the old graphics. </s>
<s> Install the new drivers. </s>
<s> Simple enough to move the VGA connector to the other connection for that. </s>

<s> Problem there is when I plug the card in there is no output at all from the onboard socket. </s>
<s> It just goes completely dead. </s>
<s> Can I still install drivers if the card is not in place? </s>
<s> I tried and it came up saying it couldn't find any hardware to match. </s>
<s> As I said, on the new card everything seems OK up until the Windows XP screen. </s>
<s> When it disappears and you expect to see Windows loading up, the screen goes black and the &quot;no signal&quot; box comes up on the monitor. </s>
<s> Windows continues to load as you can hear its little jingle. </s>
<s> Now boot SAFE MODE and try installing the drivers that way. </s>
<s> No go? </s>
