Sorry I read your post twice before my response and didn't find you clearly stating the BIOS calling it out incorrectly.
However it won't help to fix the BIOS since any XP CD will promptly call it at 127GB.
See that link of mine.
Do you have the F12 BIOS?
How about the exact make/model of the drive?
Some have utilities to set the drive size with such.
