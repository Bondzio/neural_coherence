[2] Does the ATI integrated video boost performance with an ATI tuner card? [3] Does the system have S/PDIF outputs? Coax? Optical? [4] Does the system have 5.1 audio analog outputs? (in addition to mic in, line in, line out) Thanks!

Depending on what speaker configuration you select (2 speakers, 3 speaker or 6), the mic is only available on the 2 & 3 speaker configuration. Also, there is no coaxial or optical connections.
