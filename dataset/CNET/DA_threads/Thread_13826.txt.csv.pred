1.1.1	Hi there , I have a laptop ( Win XP SP3 ) which connects to the Internet via wireless connection .	St
1.1.2	Configuration is as follows : Laptop connects to AP1 ( wireless ) AP1 connects to AP2 ( ethernet cable ) AP2 connects to AP3 ( wireless ) ( AP3 is somewhere in the neighbourhood , i dont know where ) Some of the APs or all of them may work as bridges , i dont know since i do not have access to their interfaces .	St
1.1.3	I have a desktop , which is connected to my laptop with a crossover ethernet cable .	St
1.1.4	Wireless connection details : IP : 192.168.1.72 Mask : 255.255.0.0 Gateway : 192.168.3.2 DNS : 192.168.3.2 LAN details : Laptop 's IP : 10.10.10.1 Desktop 's IP : 10.10.10.2 Mask : 255.255.255.0 I want to share the Laptop 's internet connection with my desktop .	St
1.1.5	Tried ICS , bridging , etc .	St
1.1.6	but nothing seems to be working .	St
1.1.7	How do I do that ?	Ques
1.1.8	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.2.1	So while I can offer ideas , no one is there to fix it for us .	St
1.2.2	Having said that ... Be sure to use TRACEROUTE on the host ( XP ) machine to see if there is a 10.10.10.x or 10.x.x.x in the route .	St
1.2.3	This could cause your NAT ( ICS ) to fail .	St
1.2.4	Fix ?	Ques
1.2.5	Use that other 168.x.x.x private IP range for ICS .	St
1.2.6	Also , many are firewalling beyond reason and while you are setting up you must have a firm grasp on the firewall .	St
1.2.7	For my testing I often turn it off and if it 's a third party firewall I often find they break ICS so I uninstall it .	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	thank you , the firewall was causing this trouble .	Polite
1.4.1	Is that something you 've rules out ?	Ques
1.4.2	Internet sharing of this type is tricky , quirky and can negatively affect the internet performance of both .	St
1.4.3	ICS uses a specific network address scheme for host and client PCs .	St
1.4.4	Try to better define the hardware that is in your home .	St
1.4.5	You said AP 1 , 2 and 3 but the connection layout does n't sound right .	St
1.4.6	Might this be some sort of wireless subscriber network that 's available in your neighborhood that would cost you more if you connect more than one device ?	Ques
1.5.1	That the usual was found and conquered .	St
1.5.2	Bob	St
1.6.1	My desktop computer has actually a wireless adapter .	St
1.6.2	However , as you wrote , i would have to pay more if i wanted my desktop to connect wirelessly to the same AP .	St
1.6.3	i know that this is not the best solution , but its free	St
