I got a SimpleTech SimpleDrive Hi-Speed USB 2.0 Portable 80GB Hard Drive (product number SP-U25/80 designed by pininfarina) for Christmas. I know the thing works, as I hooked it up to my dad's computer to grab some of my files off of it. Once I got it home though, I tried hooking it up to my computer and it won't recognize it. All I can do it unplug it in the USB menu, I can't access it from My Computer. It came with a little disc for a StorageSync program and everytime I try to install it I get the following error before it finishes installing- Access violation address 0040267 in module 'SETUP.EXE'. Read of address FFFFFFF. I have no idea what that means or why I can't get the thing to work. It may have something to do with that fact that my computer is WAY old and runs Windows ME (though the hard drive claims to be able to work with that system). Any advice? Thanks!

Solution 1: format the external FAT32...it should work on both PCs and OSs'. Solution 2: upgrade the Me to XP before you encounter more SW issues. VAPCMD
961	6	225420	2358414	2358397	enders_girl	12/28/06 8:44 AM	1.16729544E12	How?	How would I go about doing that? I don't think I've ever had to reformate something before... And I would LOVE to upgrade to XP, but I think my computer is too old to handle it. It's sort of a hand-me-down computer and the only reason I got it is because my dad got a new computer that could run a newer version of windows. I think I'm stuck. Thanks so much for all the help, by the way. -ender

I don't know if this helps at all, but rather than run a compatibility check which I agree is also a good idea at times, I have reservations as to Microsofts ability to diagnose computers remotely. Here are the specs that I suggest for a computer. 800 mhz CPU 256mb Ram 40 GB Hard Drive. These are my recommended specs for someone who would like it to run and operate in a fashion which is not trying to your senses and it leaves space on the drive for a couple other things. Here are the lowest specs that I know XP to run on and operate halfway decent, but mind you these specs leave minimal room on a hard drive, but it will function. 400 mhz 64mb RAM 4.7gb HD This particular model I bought in early 2000. This should give you a rough estimate as to how old a computer can be. As for hand me downs, you can get a reasonable compuer nowadays for under 200 dollars. I do not promote companies on other websites so I can't tell you where, but if you ever do want to know you can conact me at michaelfeather@aol.com. My computer now is a Emachine 1.2 Ghz CPU 512mb Ram, 150 GB HD and a bunch of other goodies that I have installed from here and there and so far I have about 160 bucks in it. That's with the lightscribe DVD burner and the DVD/CDRW drive, so it is very possible to get or piece together a very good system for minimal money. Hope the specs help

This was working fine for a bit however now I can't get the drive to show up on either my PC at work or at home. I checked it with my Mac last night and it worked fine. Both PCs are running XP. Can anyone advise me what steps I need to take to get my drive to read on the PCs? Thank in advance, lapeachies

I'm seeing FAT32 volumes on USB fail on Windows but work on other OSes (Mac, Linux). To fix this we back off the files and delete, create the partition and give it a fresh format. Sadly FAT32 is not damage resistant and eventually goes wonky again. -&gt; Let me be blunt. Do not use FAT32 volumes on USB for storage. Only use such to transfer files. Bob
