<s> I just recently purchased myself an SSD, a 128 GB Crucial m4 solid state drive to be used as my boot drive in my next computer. </s>
<s> I found this guide here: http://www.storagereview.com/how_upgrade_crucial_ssd_firmware Along with the official firmware update from the site itself: http://www.crucial.com/support/firmware.aspx?AID=10273954&PID=3332167&SID=u00000626 But both of these are quite confusing. </s>
<s> First of all, they don't mention how the SSD is plugged into the motherboard. </s>
<s> Do I just plug the SSD into my old motherboard and update first, before starting the build? </s>
<s> Or do I plug it into the new mobo and use external storage to supply the firmware? </s>
<s> (like a USB stick or an ISO file burned to a disc?) </s>
<s> Do I install Windows 7 first, then once I arrive at the desktop I start up Crucial's update tool? </s>
<s> Should I update the motherboard firmware before the SSD's? </s>
<s> I haven't actually received the SSD yet, so I can't read the instruction manual. </s>
<s> I would just like a general handle on how it will work before I get it. </s>
<s> I knew it would require messing with the firmware going in, but I didn't realize it would be so complicated. </s>
<s> http://ca.asus.com/en/Motherboards/Intel_Socket_1155/P8Z68V_PROGEN3/ It also offers a download section with the latest drivers, a lot of them actually... </s>
<s> I'm not entirely sure in which order I'm supposed to put them on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Or even how. </s>
<s> I know there's something called a &quot;bootable USB thumb drive&quot; but I've never done that before. </s>
<s> Slow down, since you're dealing with parts you haven't gotten. </s>
<s> You do have a working PC, then update what can be done as necessary for what you have. </s>
<s> Once done, await the new SSD and then make sure it works after installation. </s>
<s> Once done, you update &quot;if&quot; you like or just update it once all is working 100%. </s>
<s> That should be it, no need burden yourself beforehand. </s>
<s> I do suggest you get the instructions, print them out and review them. </s>
<s> As for the Win 7 install, is this a re-install or new one? </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I'll be getting a new copy of it. </s>
<s> My current PC is kind of a pre-built Acer (with a bunch of pieces that I've replaced). </s>
<s> It came with Windows 7 already in it, so I don't think I can re-use that one. </s>
<s> I was just worried because I heard one of the bugs with the m4 is that it can start getting BSODs after... 5000+ something hours of use. </s>
<s> Which probably comes to well over 200 days, so it's not too too serious... but I do want to patch that bug ASAP. </s>
<s> It makes me wonder though... the m4 hasn't been on the market that long. </s>
<s> How did they even find out about this bug? </s>
<s> Here's my parts list: Lancool K63 case (acquired) LEPA 80+ Gold 500 W PSU (acquired) 2 x 2 GB Crucial Ballistix DDR RAM (acquired) Western Digital 2 TB Black internal HDD (acquired) Crucial 128 GB m4 internal SSD (in transit) Intel i5-2500K CPU (not yet purchased) Asus P8Z68-V Pro mobo (not yet purchased) Also I have an old DVD drive I have lying around... though truth be told I don't much like DVDs anymore... </s>
<s> I know I should get the mobo and CPU... but a naive part of me still thinks I can wait out until Ivy Bridge arrives, lol. </s>
<s> I should just bite the bullet and get the damn thing... </s>
<s> I need this PC up and running before Diablo III comes out. </s>
<s> You have a grasp of the M4 bug, then do what needs to be done. </s>
<s> In most cases, users refer back to the manufacturers of issues encountered and that gets out and word becomes whatever is required for the fix. </s>
<s> Since, you know about this, keep an eye on it and refer to it should anything go wrong. </s>
<s> In other words don't try another fix, it seems to be a defective item in the making. </s>
<s> Of course, there are issues with manufacturing, a series of product may have been released and later found due to some incorrect make of the product, yada, yada, things happen. </s>
<s> That's only a guess on my part. </s>
<s> As for Win 7, do what it takes to be &quot;genuine&quot; as MS under its update process may defeat attempts to bypass it, sooner or later. </s>
<s> Well, you will need a DVD drive in order for an install under typical conditions. </s>
<s> So, while it maybe dislaiked by you, it does serve a useful purpose. </s>
<s> Now all you have to do is await until ALL the parts become available to do all that needs to be done. </s>
<s> enjoy -----Willy </s>
<s> They discovered the bug in mid January... </s>
<s> I ordered it a couple of days ago... About 2 months time, maybe that was enough for them to produce corrected drives and ship them to Newegg. </s>
<s> Hopefully it will come fully functional right out of the box and I won't have to get my hands dirty. </s>
<s> Though... if I plan on tweaking computers on a regular basis, I really should learn how to do this stuff... </s>
