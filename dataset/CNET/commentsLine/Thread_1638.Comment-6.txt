sorry but i only get a glimpse of that machine from what you write.
it is a few years old from what i can tell and i don't write at first about using canned air because i hope that folk will tell me they did the usual cleaning.
those temp measuring software can fail.
nothing new here and i won't start yet another discussion.
please remove such because its probing can cause a good machine to hang.
now about that canned air.
