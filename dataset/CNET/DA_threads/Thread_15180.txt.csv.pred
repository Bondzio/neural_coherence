1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	YES you do need to buy a new power supply .	St
1.2.3	x800xls require at least 350w .	St
1.2.4	look at antec , ocz , or enermax .	St
1.2.5	2 .	St
1.2.6	NO you can not oc your cpu , YES you can the gpu .	St
1.2.7	i used ATi tool , free download , for easy oc .	St
1.2.8	3. it should n't decrease any memory from your main memory if you have your onboard graphics disabled .	Ques
1.2.9	check your system properties to make sure .	Sug
1.2.10	4. yes you can use two monitors .	Res
1.2.11	thats all i know for that ?	Ques
1.2.12	lol 5. just stick with 2 sticks of 1GB .	St

1.3.1	How do I know which PSU I should get ?	Ques
1.3.2	Do I need additional cooling ?	Ques
1.3.3	I could always go to 4GB of RAM	St
1.4.1	Doubt you need additional cooling , you could get any psu with the proper number of pins in your mobo .	St
1.4.2	Get something with at least 18A on +12V .	St
1.4.3	400watt or higher .	St
1.4.4	As for whther it 'll fit , i dk , you might want to take measurements Roger	St
1.5.1	& quot ; How do I know which PSU I should get ? & quot ; what damasta55r said and make sure it is an ATX power supply .	St
1.5.2	i believe emachine has a regular ATX power supply so that should be fine .	St
1.5.3	look for dual fans and or one 120mm fans inside the psu .	St
1.5.4	this will prolong the life of it and also help remove heat from your case so that you dont need additional cooling .	St
1.5.5	personally , i recomend this model , as its in my machine now and has been running with NO problems for over 5 months now .	St
1.5.6	http : //www.antec.com/us/productDetails.php ? ProdID=20480 also check enermax and ocz , but the above would be my choice .	St
1.5.7	( bestbuy , newegg , and frys carry this ) konny	St
1.6.1	You need memory that can handle over clocking otherwise you can burn out the sticks as well as fry the cpu .	St
1.6.2	Also if you are going to replace the HD Drive go with a SATA Drive and set up a raid system using EID HD	St
1.7.1	Well , I wish I had a different drive .	St
1.7.2	I ghosted my old drive to the emachines installed drive ( Seagate 160MB ) and now I get a hal.dll missing error when the PC boots up .	St
1.7.3	I tried just copying the new hal.dll overwriting the hal.dll but no luck .	St
1.7.4	Should of expected this .	St
1.7.5	I do n't want to do a new install of Windows because I do n't have the disks and do n't have CD 's for most of my apps .	St
1.7.6	I tried editing the boot.ini file but no luck there either .	St
1.7.7	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.8.1	If you 're planning to stick with your Current Processor you do n't need a new PSU .	St
1.8.2	The X800XL Uses very low energy ( like 60watts ) .	St
1.8.3	go check out the X800XL online .	Sug
1.8.4	My Friend has a 250watt ( or 270Watt cheap PSU ) PSU ; he got an X800 overclocked with a 3500+ and 768RAM , no cooling except CPU/Heatsink , 1 double layer cd/dvd combo and last but not least , a 120GB HD .	St
1.8.5	NO PROBLEMS AT ALL .	St
1.8.6	His computer does n't get very hot , sometimes very warm .	St
1.8.7	Google the X800XL yourself and find out .	St
1.9.1	I have a T2542 ( do n't laugh ) , ran disk clean up with every thing selected and after a restart , i ca n't boot but restore my computer using the CD that was supplied .	St
1.9.2	( I did exactly the CNET weekend Project told me )	St
1.10.1	An X800 is different from the x800xl .	St
1.10.2	Suggest you get at least 350watts .	St
1.10.3	If you have very little things to powere , you may get away with it .	St
