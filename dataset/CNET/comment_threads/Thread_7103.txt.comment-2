I found the problem, the tray was jammed against a piece of plastic under the tray.
Fiddled a bit and unjammed it.
I do have another issue though.
In OS X the profiler says burning is fully supported but I can't burn files without making a disc image of the file first.
The disc works fine on the mac but doesn't read on a PC.
My version of Toast only works on classic, do I have to get Toast for OS X to burn cross platform discs?
