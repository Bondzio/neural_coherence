But remember that port forwarding is NOT in the forum sticky as a suggested setup.
Yes there are valid reasons to forward ports but for me I don't need it and it works fine across dozens of routers.
Your PC could be the issue but I'm unconvinced your router is setup exactly per our forum sticky so that's still a possible issue.
I can't count how many times we see the member come back with hidded SSIDs, WEP and MAC filtering.
