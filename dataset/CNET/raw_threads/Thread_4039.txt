I got another HP internet keyboard and mouse on eBay, but it is larger and it doesn't have as many functions as the other keyboard does, so I got an adapter for the keyboards and I have them both connected. Now I have two keyboards and two mice and they both work at the same time because you can connect just about anything with a USB connection.... and all these things install by themselves... I also have two USB extensions. They light up. And they can plug in, but they can also work just by connecting to the computer. One of the speaker systems that I have on it has the green audio plug, and it has a usb connection that it gets its power from. And there are USB Hard Drives, Zip Drives, Jaz Drives, Tape Drives, Jump Drives, and Edge Drives. ( They have USB memory card readers, But the memory card reader slots are built into my computer, so I don't need a USB one. ) If somebody has at least one of all of these things, and there seems to be no limit to how many USB devices can be connected to just one computer, how can the computer provide power to all of the devices?? Will it crash the computer or something??

Most of this is covered on the web. http://www.usbman.com has some basics you can go over. 2. 127 Devices max. 3. 500 mA per PC port max. 4. Some devices don't work on hubs. Drives people crazy. Here I have about 10 USB devices installed. Multiple USB RS232 dongles, camera, 2 Palms, memory card reader, printers and a pair of USB drives. Works pretty well. Cheers, Bob
