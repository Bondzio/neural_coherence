<s> I installed a wireless printserver with my epson printer which connects through my wireless router. </s>
<s> The print server has to be connected via the wireless router and the 10/100 connection. </s>
<s> The PC, Wireless Router and printer are all located upstairs in my office. </s>
<s> This works fine. </s>
<s> I can print from my wireless laptop downstairs to my printer upstairs. </s>
<s> My question is - Can I connect another stand alone wireless printserver to my printer downstairs without connecting via the 10/100(which is upstairs)to access a wireless printer downstairs. </s>
<s> Another words a Stand alone Printer Server(802.11g) that will work with the downstairs printer????? </s>

<s> ...that I completely understand your situation, so please confirm the following summary: Upstairs: wireless router --- wired print server --- printer1 You want to connect the downstairs printer to wireless router: wireless router ~ ~ ~ wireless-g print server --- printer2 Key: --- wired ~ ~ ~ wireless Answer: You can connect multiple print servers (wired and/or wireless) to a typical wireless router. </s>
<s> You just need to ensure that the wireless print server is compatible with your printer, compatible with your wireless router, and is in range of the wireless router. </s>
<s> You got the situation correct. </s>
<s> I am currently using a Linksys wireless Routher, a Linksys Wireless Printer server with the upstairs printer, and a Epson Printer. </s>
<s> The system works great. </s>
<s> I just want to expand my capabilitie to the downstars printer. </s>
<s> I have a Epson R300 down. </s>
<s> How would I hook this up? </s>
<s> Would I use another Linksys Print Server hooked to the Epson R300 as a stand alone print server? </s>
<s> Mike Thanks </s>
<s> Yes you have the situation correct. </s>
<s> So, if I buy another wireless print server (linksys wireless print server)like the one I already have (802.11g) and connect to a compatable printer (Epson R300) or (Hp 5440) I can print wireless downstairs from my wireless network upstairs as a stand alone? </s>
<s> Thanks for the advise. </s>
<s> Mike </s>
<s> When you connect a printer to a network, the printer becomes a network resource, available for use by the computers on the network. </s>
<s> It doesn't matter whether you connect the printer via wired or wireless print server. </s>
<s> Thanks, I am going to buy another print server and see if I can connect my Epson downstairs wireless as a stand alone. </s>
<s> I'm not sure how to do this? </s>
<s> I suppose I can call Linksys for Tech Support? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Take a deep breath and smile. </s>
<s> One thing you can do is download and read the quick install instructions for the particular wireless print server you are considering. </s>
<s> I'm not necessarily recommending this brand or particular model, but you might benefit from taking a look at its ''Quick Install'' manual to give you an idea about the level of difficulty involved. </s>
<s> A Linksys Wireless-G Print Server There are also less expensive models from other companies that may work with your equipment. </s>
<s> Thanks, I am already running a Linksys PrintServer with my system upstair. </s>
<s> I print to the upstairs printer from my Laptop downstarirs. </s>
<s> I guess where I am still confused is, If I hook another Linksys PS to my downstairs printer, it will be a total stand alone. </s>
<s> Can I then print through my Wireless Links Router from the up stairs setup with my wireless Laptop? </s>
<s> I don't think Linksys make that very clear in the install instructions. </s>
<s> That is the general idea with any print server. </s>
<s> If you can connect a print server to a router, then any printer you connect to the print server will be available for ANY computer that is also connected to the router. </s>
<s> The router doesn't care how you connect a print server to it--you can use a network cable or a wireless signal. </s>
<s> The wireless signal performs the same function as a network cable. </s>
<s> Wired print server: WIRELESS ROUTER --- PRINT SERVER --- PRINTER Wireless print server: WIRELESS ROUTER ~ ~ ~ WIRELESS PRINT SERVER --- PRINTER KEY: --- network cable ~ ~ ~ wireless signal There are two ways to use a wireless print server. </s>
<s> Infrastructure mode connects the wireless print server to the wireless router via wireless signal. </s>
<s> Ad-hoc mode connects the wireless print server directly to the wireless network adapter of a computer (also via wireless signal). </s>
<s> You can set it up either way. </s>
<s> Infrastructure mode is represented in the above diagrams. </s>
<s> If you want more information on that Linksys wireless print server, just click on ''User Guide'' in the link I provided earlier. </s>
<s> The cable between the print servers and the printers is a USB or parallel cable and not a network cable as indicated in the KEY. </s>
