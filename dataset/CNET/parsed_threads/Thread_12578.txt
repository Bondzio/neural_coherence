<s> I reformatted a hard drive, but most of the space is unallocated, and i need to recover this. </s>
<s> I looked into some demos of partition software, but they all seem to do nothing, just let you look, and then ask you to buy the software. </s>
<s> So is there a demo that will let me do this? </s>
<s> Could i also do this myself? </s>
<s> I'm running windows 98, what if i just adjust the virtual memory of the hard drive up to the max size of it, under the system properties performance advanced settings? </s>
<s> Would that cause any problems, like wipe the hard drive? </s>
<s> When the installer used FDISK, they answered no to LARGE DISK SUPPORT and end up with a 2GB C drive. </s>
<s> I think it's best to start over. </s>

<s> I would rather not start over, wipe the drive then go through all the headaches of installing the hardware and drivers. </s>
<s> It's a few bucks and will fix this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Or a demo that will do the job? </s>
<s> I'll note a name but also that many crash their partition and data with such as RANISH (google.com) I can't offer any support for such dangerous items and if you lose it all on some freeware, I can't be help accountable. </s>
