i'm just curious as to why sony or microsoft haven't done a thing to market their own version of an ipad?
i'm not anti-apple but i have either sony computers/tv's or microsoft's zune and their zune pass.
i don't want to reinvent my own personal wheel by dumping all my music and sony cards just to buy an ipad.
yeah, i checked the web and all i got was chatter on how &quot;companies are looking into it&quot;.
i don't want to be on social security before this happens.
