<s> Hi, I just bought a 3.5 IDE Hard Drive to USB 2.0 Enclosure. </s>
<s> When I hook up the power plug(the plug that has the 4 connections that plugs in the hard drive I can turn it on and the hard drive will spin. </s>
<s> When I hook up the ribbon cable that goes into the Hard Drive, the Hard Drive doesn't spin. </s>
<s> The power light is still on, but it will not work. </s>
<s> I've tried three different hard drive, but the same thing. </s>
<s> I'm using Windows XP, and all of my disk are set for Master. </s>
<s> Also, when I look in my Computer, it is not listed. </s>
<s> When I look in Disk Manager, it doesn't show up. </s>
<s> Can you think of any reason the disk will not spin? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> If the drive is not communicating with the CPU, it can not register with my Computer. </s>
<s> (1) EIDE cables have an orientation &quot;notch&quot; that precludes you plugging the EIDE cable upside down. </s>
<s> Some are embossed on the header. </s>
<s> (2) Try the above, with power, but do not connect the USB cable. </s>
<s> Does the drive spin? </s>
<s> If not, the adapter circuit board was more than likely shorted. </s>
<s> You did not say if power was on while plugging the EIDE cable to the controller board. </s>
<s> That will short out the controller. </s>
<s> (3) If the drive is spinning, then plug in the USB cable. </s>
<s> (4) Check Device Manager? </s>
<s> Any Yellow flags on the USB controllers? </s>
<s> If not, OK. </s>
<s> If so, delete only the affected item. </s>
<s> Re-boot. </s>
<s> Go to 3. </s>
<s> (5) Are you using a USB hub? </s>
<s> If so, use any USB port on the back. </s>
<s> Not the front. </s>
<s> Have seen some HP's with faulty front USB grounds. </s>
<s> Hi, thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> I didn't realize how many people was having this same problem until it happened to me. </s>
<s> I've been going all over the net to solve it. </s>
<s> I believe that it has to be in the unit itself. </s>
<s> I've used these before, and never had no problems. </s>
<s> Thanks again for your reply. </s>
