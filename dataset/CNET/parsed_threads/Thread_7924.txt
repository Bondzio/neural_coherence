<s> I am going to be building/buying a USB external hard drive. </s>
<s> I have read reviews online that were full of horror stories of such drives failing after 2 weeks on intermittent use, and other equally disturbing problems. </s>
<s> My question is what brands of USB HDDs or USB HDD enclosures are the most reliable? </s>
<s> I dont really care if I build it myself or buy it pre-made; I just want the thing to be as reliable as possible. </s>
<s> Thank you for any help you can provide. </s>
<s> These are external and portable. </s>
<s> But, you should not move them while in operation. </s>
<s> I must suspect lots of failures are due to folks handling the drive and moving it around while it's spinning. </s>
<s> That being said, if you put together your own, the drive should be as reliable as is you put it in your case. </s>
<s> My drives are all Western Digital and Seagate models currently. </s>
<s> My external enclosures are branded bytech or something similar. </s>
<s> They are basic aluminum with external power supplies and worked right out of the box. </s>
<s> Thats good advice. </s>
<s> Youre probably right about most problems being caused by moving it while in operation. </s>
<s> When I was reading reviews, some people mentioned that their units were quite hot. </s>
<s> Could the heat also be part of the problem? </s>
<s> In your experience, does the drive get too hot? </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> I have three of them. </s>
<s> These are slightly warm to the touch. </s>
<s> Because the cases are aluminum and not plastic, they should conduct heat better. </s>
<s> They are not vented or have a fan. </s>
<s> Some feature cooling fins or a fan. </s>
<s> My reading is that these fans are often a weakness....cheaply made...and I can believe it. </s>
<s> My drives feel no warmer than the ones in my case and maybe a bit cooler. </s>
<s> The only problem I needed to deal with is that one drive is a little slower to spin up than the rest. </s>
<s> It would not always show up in Windows when starting the PC. </s>
<s> This was corrected by a BIOS setting which allowed some extra detection time. </s>
<s> Hope that helps. </s>
<s> This helps a lot. </s>
<s> Thank you again. </s>
<s> Hi, I, too, read many horror stories about external USB hard drives. </s>
<s> I also agree with Steve that many of the issues were probably user-created, like treating a drive that isn't intended for portability as a portable drive. </s>
<s> For the last 6 months or so, I've used a 120GB &quot;Diskgo&quot; HDD manufactured by Edge Tech Corporation ( http://www.edgetechcorp.com/ ). </s>
<s> I've got almost 50GB of MP3 files stored on the drive. </s>
<s> To this point (knocking on wood here) I've had no issues with the drive and find myself very happy with it. </s>
<s> Read/write speed is good and the drive has exhibited great reliability to this point. </s>
<s> The cost of the drive, especially when coupled with a manufacturer's rebate, was quite reasonable. </s>
<s> Hope this helps! </s>
<s> I have been using a Maxtor for about a year. </s>
<s> The prices have continued to drop, and the units are very durable. </s>
<s> I store video and pictures on the unit that are either being work on or being preped for more permanent storage. </s>
<s> The unit has been outstanding. </s>
<s> Write speeds are reasonable, and extra storage is great. </s>
<s> One important issue is stop the drive before you turn it off. </s>
<s> Easy to remember on a notebook, but you need to remember to do it also with a desktop. </s>
<s> I've been using the 300GB Maxtor One Touch II and, so far, I've had no problems with it. </s>
<s> There were some detection problems in the beginning, but I now turn it on while the computer is booting and turn it off after computer shut down. </s>
<s> The aluminum case does feel warm to the touch. </s>
<s> I keep it stationary while it is in use. </s>
<s> I am planning on getting a new computer soon, and I think this will be a great way to move my files onto the new computer. </s>
<s> With all this space, I no longer have any excuse to not backup my computer. </s>
<s> I've read some of the horror reviews about this drive, but I just haven't had any problems yet. </s>
<s> I hope I didn't just jinx myself... </s>
<s> I also have the Maxtor One Touch in the aluminum case (120 GB I think, I forget which specific model) and so far (~9 months) I've had no problems. </s>
<s> It definitely does not run hot, but I only use it for backing up my laptop. </s>
<s> I also have an older Maxtor 40 GB (one of the translucent red & white plastic models) on an old desktop machine and it too works fine (I forget how long, but at least two years). </s>
<s> Now I'm thinking of getting an Iomega Silver Edition, 80GB for my daughter to use to back up her laptop at college. </s>
<s> Has anyone had experience with this drive? </s>
<s> Since this is the storage forum, let me put my .02 in by saying I was really disappointed when Imation discontinued the LS120 Superdrive. </s>
<s> If anyone has an external LS120 drive they are not using, please let me know. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what chipsets to look for that allow for a bootable USB drive? </s>
<s> My understanding is there are USB drives that show up as a removable drive and can also be used as a boot drive. </s>
<s> Just because it's a USB drive doesn't mean it can do both? </s>
<s> Am I correct? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Thought this would fit in this topic as well? </s>
<s> I run multiple usb hdd on my system i have 3 units pluged in as we do a lot of mpg files and find this to be a good backup system i have 1x 160gb and 2x 200 gb units on one machine all assigned as drives then when needed i just reassign the appropriate drive to the letter that the software is looking for it </s>
<s> i have been using a maxtor external hdd (80Gig) on usb/firewire for a number of years now and it has yet to let me down. </s>
<s> performance is solid and reliable. </s>
<s> I also use a lesser known brand which DID fail after about 2 years. </s>
<s> QUESTION ON ext hd care, u shouldn't move it while it's transferring data.... the ext hd should also be set as flat as possible right, or does that not really play a big of a role in operation failures (e.g. </s>
<s> parot of it is lying ontop of a coaster or small book so it's angled) As far as reliability, there's some faith in addition to a good brand. </s>
<s> Maxtor IDE hds are supposed to be among the top. </s>
<s> My roomate installed a new one, moved (not copied) some stuff over. </s>
<s> It crashed shortly!! </s>
<s> and this was a brand new hd!! </s>
<s> He lost all the stuff he moved, luckily none of which was important. </s>
<s> He called Maxtor, they sent him a free replacement, and it's been working fine for years now. </s>
<s> I hope this won't jinx me too! </s>
<s> I have only been using mine for about 6 weeks to back up my new Dell having passed on my 5 year old Dell to my husband ( so girls that is the way to do it! </s>
<s> Mine was a special present.) </s>
<s> My Maxtor came with Dantz Retrospect Express software for backups. </s>
<s> So far everything is working fine here in the UK, but I would like a bit more flexibility than I am getting with Dantz. </s>
<s> Can someone tell me it it is o.k. </s>
<s> to use one of the other BackUp software programmes around, and if so I would be grateful to know which ones work best with Maxtor One Touch which I find is a neat way to have an external hard drive. </s>
<s> I woud not dream of moving it around while it is working...no wonder people have problems. </s>
<s> I have tried a few backup programs and have a strong preference for Genie Backup Manager by Genie-Soft...You will not find a program with more features and flexibility and wonderful scheduled backup features and it is so easy to use...I backup to my external USB 250 GB Western Digital HD weekly while I sleep...I sometimes forget that the backups are even being performed but it is there just in case.... </s>
<s> I have a Buslink USB 2.0 40 gig drive that has been running continuously for about 2 years with no problems. </s>
<s> It's even fast enough to run applicatations. </s>
<s> I also have a Maxtor OneTouch 160 gig USB 2.0 drive that has been flawless, and is fast and reliable. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>

<s> You should avoid moving a hard drive while spinning whether transferring data or not. </s>
<s> Think of the drive as a gyroscope. </s>
<s> It resists certain movements not within the plane of the spinning platters. </s>
<s> This force can cause some physical distortion or increased bearing load. </s>
<s> How much the drive can tolerate is probably nothing you want to test if you are interested in preserving data on it or keeping it a long time. </s>
<s> I see the Genie software getting a recommendation. </s>
<s> Has anybody tried AIS backup? </s>
<s> I and friends have been using this for a long time before external hard drives took off. </s>
<s> AIS can cope with internal, external and CD backups. </s>
<s> In Setup you can nominate any type of backup. </s>
<s> The rule of thumb with all HDD is to make sure they remain in the same orientation (e.g. </s>
<s> vertical, horizontal) as the drive was when first formatted. </s>
<s> Ive never heard that before. </s>
<s> Do you know why this is the case? </s>
<s> The story I heard was more about older style 5 1/4 drives. </s>
<s> We called them ''Winchesters''. </s>
<s> With these you did low and high level formatting during which you adjusted the &quot;interleave&quot; factor which was the number of disk rotations between read/write operations which allowed time for the heads to move into proper position. </s>
<s> 1 to 3 interleaving was common with early drives. </s>
<s> These were heavier units and the logic was that gravity had an affect on components...especially the heads. </s>
<s> It was said that these could sag and tracking could change when turned 90 degrees. </s>
<s> Thus, with these drives, you compensated by performing low and high level formatting in the position the drive would be running. </s>
<s> With IDE drives, you no longer low level format at end user level and I have heard/read that changing the orientation of the drive is not the issue it once was. </s>
<s> However, I still format a drive after installing it permanently just as a habit. </s>
<s> Another good manufacturer is LaCie. </s>
<s> They make complete units from 74GB up to 2TB. </s>
<s> I've been using the 74GB d2 at work for storage and imaging iMacs and Mac Minis. </s>
<s> This drive has been under heavy use and stress for the past 2 years without any problems. </s>
