(We have 4 PC's in the house, all running XP Home and LAN'd.) My question is this: is there a way to restrict certain sites on certain computers w/o effecting the other computers? The reason I ask is we want to restrict access to certain sites (take a guess which ones) on my little brother's computer but still allow him to access the 'net for whatever work he needs to do as well as game online and use various file-sharing programs. Is there a way to set up our network so that we can all take advantage of the 'net but still restrict his use? Thanks in advance.
