i contacted intel customer support regarding a high cpu temperature problem i was having, i implemented all of there recommendations and was disappointed with all but one.
i have added a hard drive cooler and installed it in a spare cd/dvd slot i have and run it with the door propped open.
this dropped my cpu/system temperature by four degrees centigrade.
all the other recommendations failed entirely.
it does make a bit of noise.
it took about 10 minutes to install and required no tools to install, just plug and play.
this may not be your experience, however.
