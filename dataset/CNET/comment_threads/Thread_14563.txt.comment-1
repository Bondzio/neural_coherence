when I start up my PC I keep receiving a warning that there is a smart error on my hard drive-back up my data and replace my hard drive as soon as possible.
I try to run a scan disk but, it keeps restarting because something keeps writing to the disc.
How do I find out what keeps writing to the disc and how then can I stop it?
Thanks for your help.
Brian.
