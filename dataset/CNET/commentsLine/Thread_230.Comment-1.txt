hey everyone!
lan noobie, here.
i wanna host a lan party between all of my friends, and being that i have no lan experience, i pretty don't know much about lanning, but we're close friends, so a little embarrassment won't hurt.
but i do wanna know what i need for the lan connection.
i know it has to be setup through the network wizard or whatever, but what exactly do i need cord-wise, and i need some sort of a hub, too, right?
steer me in the direction as to what to look for hub-wise, because i have no idea, but if i'm correct, you just use a bunch of ethernet cables into the hub, don't you?
and i am getting a hub, not a modem, right?
well, as long as you can help me with that stuff, then i'm good to go.
sorry for the |\|00|3 questions, but i gotta learn sometime.
:p
