<s> Hey everyone, Please help me here. </s>
<s> I bought a Buffalo Ministation 120GB Portable Hard Drive a week ago, and it installed fine on my PC. </s>
<s> Windows XP was able to read it and could use it without problems. </s>
<s> I copied important data, some movies, to it as a backup. </s>
<s> Everything was fine UNTIL I made a stupid move. </s>
<s> I used Diskeeper on my external hard drive, and defragged it, in hopes of increasing performance. </s>
<s> It was done successfully. </s>
<s> However, when today I opened my PC, windows ChkDsk popped up, and started fixing my H drive (ext hdd). </s>
<s> There were many messages like file record segment (XXXX) unreadable etc. </s>
<s> It kept stuck that way for a long time, so I restarted my PC, and ChkDsk was skipped. </s>
<s> My PC opened up as usual, and when I went to 'My Computer' to see my external hard drive, there was a MAJOR PROBLEM. </s>
<s> The moment I clicked, My Computer became unresponsive, and computer performed sluggishly, not loading many programs like Firefox. </s>
<s> The moment I disconnected the hard drive, all the pending programs opened up and the PC was normal. </s>
<s> I spent half an hour doing this to try to sort things out, but to no avail. </s>
<s> So I decided to restart my PC with the HDD connected. </s>
<s> The problem was, my PC didn't boot up for a long time, until I disconnected the HDD, and it fully booted up instantly. </s>
<s> It was time to connect online for help. </s>
<s> After hours of research, I got many tips, and I tried them all out, with results below: 1. </s>
<s> Run ChkDsk on the drive - When I tried to do this, it wasn't possible as I had to right click the drive icon to get the tools tab in properties. </s>
<s> Firstly, the drive letter appeared after repeated ejections. </s>
<s> And when it showed up, the moment I right clicked it, My Computer hung up. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Run ChkDsk through Command Line - When I tried that, the same messages came when ChkDsk was on at boot (file record segment (XYZ) unreadable, and after a long time, chkdsk.exe closed down with an error message. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Use another disk repair utility - So I tried the Disk Doctor in Tuneup Utilities, which failed to detect the drive. </s>
<s> EVERY other utility didn't work, as it didn't detect the drive in the first place. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Use another USB port - didn't work. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Reinstall drivers - Windows detect a storage device and installed it, yet I couldn't see it in My Computer. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> Try Safe Mode - didn't work. </s>
<s> Now when I double-clicked the drive icon in My Computer when I saw it. </s>
<s> I got these error messages in random order: H:/ is not accessible. </s>
<s> I/O Device Error. </s>
<s> H:/ is not accessible. </s>
<s> Parameter is incorrect. </s>
<s> Also, the filesystem was shown as RAW, and when I clicked format, nothing happened. </s>
<s> No response at all. </s>
<s> Please help me here. </s>
<s> This is my first post here and I hope the community here will help me. </s>
<s> I am willing to lose data, but get my HDD back in working condition at least. </s>
<s> If there is any other info I can provide, do tell me. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Anyone? </s>
<s> Try removing the partitions in the disk management tool, create a new partition and format it in that tool. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The problem is, the drive doesn't appear in Disk Management, I only see C and D there. </s>
<s> Do you have another USB cable to try? </s>
