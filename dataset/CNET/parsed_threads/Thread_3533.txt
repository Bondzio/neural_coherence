<s> OS: Windows Vista Home Premium Speakers: 5.1 I turned on my computer the other day and noticed that where there would normally be sound, there was only a hissing noise. </s>
<s> I checked my cables and ensured that everything was plugged in. </s>
<s> I checked the sound controls and made sure that nothing was muted. </s>
<s> None of my setting had changed. </s>
<s> I normally listen to music and such on a daily basis, so I know the sound had been functioning just recently. </s>
<s> I uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers. </s>
<s> I Googled for solutions. </s>
<s> I'm completely bewildered. </s>
<s> I should add that the hissing noise only occurs when there would normally be sound. </s>
<s> If I turn up the volume on my speakers the hissing gets louder. </s>
<s> HOWEVER, if I reduce the sound through the software, the hissing remains at the level set by my speakers. </s>
<s> Anyone have any ideas? </s>
<s> On the s/w side, was there any recent system updates or system installs, etc.? </s>
<s> If not, then very possible the audio portion just got blown away, it happens. </s>
<s> See, if using plain 2:1 audio works or similar. </s>
<s> if you have a testing pgm. </s>
<s> as some audio pgms. </s>
<s> do, use it. </s>
<s> Even though you checked the cabling, has anyone else been at work? </s>
<s> Also, verify the cabling again. </s>
<s> Try the speakers elsewhere is possible. </s>
<s> As for the audio ckt. </s>
<s> check the mtrbd./card in the areas in question for burnt or obvious damage. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I confirmed that speakers do work on another system. </s>
<s> Also I am the only on who uses this computer and the cabling is relatively difficult to accidentally move. </s>
<s> I do not see any burnt areas on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Audio test programs hiss at me. </s>
<s> I don't know what you mean by 2:1 audio, honestly, I'm not really a sound guy. </s>
<s> Can you explain? </s>
<s> There was a topic over in the asus forums that this is do to a bad chipset on this onboard audio..I have the same problem. </s>
<s> I use Teamspeak for gaming and its been a nightmare....This is the second asus mb purchase and the first one was the a8nslidelux and I had to return to asus for a 4week repair job....Looks like I will be contacting asus and get a RTA to send it back in...:(....my last asus purchase! </s>
<s> Peace! </s>
<s> I bought my pc new from an e-bay shop late last year and it has suddenly developed the same problem, only hissing noise heard from speakers and no other sounds at all, even when running sound test program all I hear is the same hissing noise!! </s>
<s> I am using an Asus M2N-SLi motherboard and connected to the onboard audio. </s>
<s> Have done all the usual stuff (uninstalling and reinstalling the usb audio device, updated drivers, tried reinstalling from Asus installation disc) even though there is no problem with the device showing in device manager. </s>
<s> Can I add a new sound card to the motherboard or do I have to buy and fit a replacement motherboard as I am using the onboard audio?? </s>
<s> All help appreciated. </s>
