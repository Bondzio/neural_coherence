This is an all-in-one device and everything else works perfectly BTW It does know there is a black cartridge in the printer because there is a window to troubleshoot the machine and it shows it knows both cartridges are correctly inserted and are both still full So why the heck doesn't it try to print in black ink?!?

One would have to dive into the electronics and check with an oscilloscope if the pulses are being sent to the printhead. If not you look at what drives that. Sadly with printers well under 99 bucks repair costs more than a new printer. Bob

If no black output, its a printer problem. In most cases, inspect the innards for any possible massive leaks or clogs. I like to tear apart the printer and test connections and such, but in many cases inspect the printhead wire harness is fully seated and properly aligned. Lexmark, tend to come apart or break for whatever reason. A cracked wire harness of the flat ribbon is very possible. As mentioned by Robert, the cost of repair is too much and actual replacement is the best course of action to resolve problem(s). tada -----Willy

With some bad luck, it quits in a month. You never know. No warranty. I took the gamble this week, incidentally. Kees

If I highlight the text and choose a color close to black (so close I can't tell the difference) it prints fine. I just chose one of the black squares one notch up from black. I still do not know what the problem is I have a new cartridge. Have you found out what is wrong?

Remove the printhead and soak it for about 5 minutes in 0.5&quot; of very hot water. Gently blot the printhead on a soft damp paper towel to remove the excess water, then replace in the printer and then reinstall the ink supplies. get more help...... http://www.fixya.com/support/t704575-printer_not_printing_black_ink
