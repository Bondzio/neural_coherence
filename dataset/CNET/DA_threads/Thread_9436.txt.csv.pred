1.2.1	and there 's no reason to get an upgraded cpu cooler if you 're on a tight budget .	St
1.2.2	e7500 with stock fan is $ 120 saving $ 30 .	St

1.2.6	since you 're only getting 2gb , get 1 2gb stick to make future upgrades easier .	St
1.2.7	the coolmax power supply is mediocre .	St
1.2.8	if you use your pc a lot for gaming , i doubt it will last more than 18 months .	St
1.2.9	these $ 40 power supplies are a bit more but should last 3 years or more .	St
