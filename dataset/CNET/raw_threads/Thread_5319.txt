I have a p3 system that had been working fine running win 2000. then I started to have issues with the ipod, it would not recognize it, as it was using a usb1.0 I thought I would upgrade and see if this solved the problem, I added a USB card in one of the empty pci slots and then when I tried to reboot. I got nothing. I removed the card (all the while being careful to ground myself) and still nothing. it boots up to the cmos and tries to initiate the hard drive but fails, the hard drive doesn't spinn at all and I have tried disconnecting and reconnecting the cables. is there anyway I can get this thing working again or is it dead?

The old SCSI drives had a jumper which in English said &quot;Spin up when you get power&quot; and the other setting was &quot;Don't spin up until you get a command from the SCSI controller.&quot; If the controller was not set proper and it former setting was used, a boot failure occurs. The joy of SCSI. Bob
