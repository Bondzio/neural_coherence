1.1.1	Just bought a new EVGA e-GeForce 7900 gs video card .	St
1.1.2	The card requires a minimun 450w with +12 volt current rating of 22 amps .	St
1.1.3	I currently have only a 400w with 16 amps .	St
1.1.4	My system is a Gateway DX430X .	St
1.1.5	Core2 DUO 2.13GHz 3GB DDR2 SDRAM 500GB 7200rpm SATA DVD/RW 52x CD ROM PCI sound card PCI modem 1 to 2 devices running on USB ports Keyboard/mouse Tower fan CPU fan Will a 500w be sufficient ?	Ques
1.1.6	Or should I go with a 550w or even higher ?	Ques
1.1.7	I dont want to go to high , but I dont want to go to low either .	St
1.2.1	or a proprietary PSU ... one made for a GATEWAY ?	Ques
1.2.2	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Practically all psus posted for sale show their specs to review .	St
1.3.2	Check those out and then pick besides cost you can live with .	St
1.3.3	If you decide to pick cheap , then expect cheap results over time .	St
1.3.4	I tend to buy a good brandname and offering dual fan cooling along with wattage and rail volts ( depends ) required .	St
1.3.5	Also , a good rule of thumb is the stable and dependable output on a constant basis is 75 % of rating , others may quote higher than that , but 75 % is a safe bet .	St
1.3.6	A decent 500W+ psu should suffice for your needs provided a generic psu fits in your Gateway .	St
1.3.7	Check out http : //www.geeks.com and others , FYI , got the Logisys ( 575W ) psu for $ 39 , recently and does well .	St
1.3.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	it lasts .	St
1.4.2	By the way , what 's your criteria for a 'good brand name ' ?	Ques
1.4.3	$ 39 for a 575W PSU sounds too cheap to be something I 'd want to put into more than a minimum system .	St
1.4.4	Looking at the web below makes we wonder why you 'recommend ' the Logisys http : //www.overclockers.com.au/wiki/Power_Supply_Unit # Trusted_Power_Supply_Makers VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	the video card 's power supply rating is a rule of thumb and is based on peak draw in a fully loaded system ( which few people have ) .	St
1.5.2	i have a friend with the same model gateway and the same video card .	St
1.5.3	just keep your current power supply and only replace it if you have problems .	St
1.5.4	p.s .	St
1.5.5	here 's a chart on actual power draw of a pc with a core2 x6800 ( 3ghz ) and various video cards : http : //techreport.com/articles.x/10715/9	St
1.6.1	Many of the PSU makers listed ( at supplied link ) did n't even exist as psu providers a few yrs .	St
1.6.2	ago .	St
1.6.3	Even those that were a few yrs .	St
1.6.4	no longer are or do n't provide what has become a leader .	St
1.6.5	Coolmaster as an example did n't make psu or at least under thier own bage , but rather fans and heatsinks .	St
1.6.6	They grew and now offer psu but even so , may not be of their own manufacturing factories but rebadged psu from another provider .	St
1.6.7	That is very much what has become of some psu suppliers .	St
1.6.8	Thermalke as another example was n't around suppling psu but is a big player now .	St
1.6.9	Also , some brandnames may fail when pushed too , but they seem to provide a tolerance far above true cheap units and that 's to include real ( dependable ) build-in safety features .	St
1.6.10	As for my recommending Logisys , it has proven so far to deliver the goods .	St
1.6.11	At the same time , I do n't make a point of testing batches of psus but can certainly recommend what has worked for me .	St
1.6.12	Sounding cheap and finding a good bargain at the time and when previous offering were higher priced of the same model .	St
1.6.13	I did mentioned , to look at the specs and find other vendors .	St
1.6.14	You can look at http : //www.pcpowerandcooling.com and see if many jump to pay those prices , even though they 're very very good .	St
1.6.15	I do n't have a minimal system and the Logisys is doing well .	St
1.6.16	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.7.1	the better quality PSUs and then recommending a total NO NAME that turns up on someone else 's NOT RECOMMENDED list .	St
1.7.2	Except for some PSUs that came with cases many many years ago , I always use Enermax , Antec , Fortron-Source , Seasonic or most recently Corsair .	St
1.7.3	Leaving my main system on 24-7 , I want something very very reliable .	St
1.7.4	Whether it 's luck or just better quality stuff I 've never had a PSU failure in over 20 years of building , upgrading and repairing PCs .	St
1.7.5	Knock on wood and keeping my fingers crossed too .	St
1.7.6	VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	I do n't want a pissing contest , but it seems I provide/pass info as best experienced knowledge in & quot ; good faith & quot ; , take or leave it as the forum provides .	St
1.8.2	The FYI on Logisys was just that .	St
1.8.3	-- -- -Willy :	St
