But I'd never heard of a computer shutting down a IDE device to save power.
I've heard of the computer maybe shutting down a USB device, but never of a IDE device.
Either way I scoured the device manager properties of the CD drive to see what it had about power.
It was listed as S3.
But like I said, it still get's power and it'll open and close the drive bay.
I'd thought about virus' but as I mentioned I scanned with two virus' programs...
Thanks for the reply!
