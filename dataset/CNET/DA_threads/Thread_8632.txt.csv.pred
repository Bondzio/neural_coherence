1.1.1	Being income tax season and all , I decided when I get mine back any day now , I 'm going to use some of it to build a new PC .	St
1.1.2	Right now I have a prehistoric VIA computer that runs at 700MHz and can barely do anything without bogging down .	St
1.1.3	I do n't want a top of the line PC that will cost over a grand and allow me to play Crysis with max settings or anything , but something good enough to watch movies and play newer games at medium settings would be great .	St
1.1.4	Here 's what I have so far : CPU : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16819103211 AMD Athlon 64 x2 5000+ = $ 100 Mobo : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16813138081 BIOSTAR TF560 = $ 70 ( after rebate ) Memory : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16820211188 A-DATA 4GB DDR2 800 = $ 80 DVD/CD Drive : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16827151153 Samsung = $ 30 HDD : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16822148261 Seagate Barracuda 250GB = $ 67 Total thus far : $ 357 So assuming all of this is good and all , I still need a competent video card , a good monitor and maybe a new power supply ?	Ques
1.1.5	I have speakers/keyboard/mouse and operating system covered .	St
1.2.1	& quot ; a prehistoric VIA computer that runs at 700MHz & quot ; would need some 100 Watt PSU plus almost any case will do .	St
1.2.2	Your new machine might be in need of a decent , well ventilated case where the 700MHz unit has been known to work in an enclosed box .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Well , I planned on buying a new case , which would come with a new PSU .	St
1.3.2	I should have worded by original post better , what I meant was maybe I 'd need to buy a new PSU to replace the one that would come with my new case ?	Ques
1.3.3	Like for instance , I was looking at this one : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16811129155 It comes with a 450W power supply , would that be good enough ?	Ques
1.3.4	That case only has one fan , but the processor I am buying comes with a fan and heatsink , and the video card I buy will probably have one as well , would it stay cool enough in there ?	Ques
1.4.1	You added some power hungry graphics card .	St
1.4.2	Just checking .	St
1.4.3	Did you research about how 4GB shows as 2.x to 3.5GB with most versions of Windows ?	Ques
1.5.1	You mentioned in your other post , buying a case with a psu , do n't count on that psu .	St
1.5.2	All too often its minimal output , in fact buy a better psu to handle your current needs and possible future demands .	St
1.5.3	If you follow the posts here , psus are a common failure .	St
1.5.4	They are the bedrock of a decent system and should n't be taken for granted .	St
1.5.5	They often are and poof at some later date , they become an issue .	St
1.5.6	You may want to reviews past posts on the topic , just use the forum search engine .	St
1.5.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	the sonata has a 120mm fan and very good airflow .	St
1.6.2	you can add a front 80mm fan if you want but it really wo n't be necessary for your build .	St

St
1.7.1	It might be a little pricy for you but i suggest you go ahead and get a new case and atleast a new PSU .	St
1.7.2	The most attractive option i found for the money was from Apevia , they have options of colors ( red , blue , and green ) but i got a blue one and it looks great .	St
1.7.3	PSU : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817148028 Case : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16811144211 Together they come out to around $ 200 , but its money well spent , there are cheaper options if you shop around you might be able to cut it down to around $ 150	St
