1.1.1	hi guys , well on my old soyo moard and my 600 mhz slot 1 cpu , windows 98SE , NEW seagate 30 gbyte hard drive , I just installed a old copy of avid cinema , and the program demanded that I set the hard drive to DMA mode .	St
1.1.2	So I went into device manager/ hard drive/ properties , etc. , and there is no listing or option of anything re : DMA mode .	St
1.1.3	does this mean it 's automatically enabled and I do n't need to worry about it ?	Ques
1.1.4	I did not install any outside software or drivers on the hard drive .	St
1.1.5	THANKS fj	St
1.2.1	First , install Soyo 's motherboard drivers .	St
1.2.2	Next , look in the drive item for DMA as well as the IDE controller itself .	St
1.2.3	Remember that if you load ANY real mode CDROM driver , you have to disable that ( it 's in config.sys ) first .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	well , gee whiz , I did n't see the disk drives in device manager , I was looking at the drive controllers -- I think I 'm working too hard .	St
1.3.2	all set !	St
1.3.3	thanks - fj	Polite
1.4.1	You 'll be glad to know they move that piece of cheese in each version of the OS .	St
