1.1.1	Hi, I am for sure getting the E8500 core 2 duo CPU, and later planning on getting a Radeon 4890.	St
1.1.2	The CPU is very nice but I'm wondering if it would bottleneck the card at all and if so, to what degree.	St
1.1.3	I'm also planning on getting a new 750 watt PSU at the same time as the card and my current system also has 4 gigs (only 3.3 usable from vista 32 bit) of 667 RAM.	St
1.1.4	Any estimations would be appreciated, thanks in advance.	Polite
1.2.1	unless you're doing video editting or some 3d ray-tracing, the e8500 has plenty of compute power.	St
1.3.1	I agree with the previous poster.	St
1.3.2	Keep in mind that E8500 (3.16 GHz) can outperform many quad-cores in single and dual-threaded applications because of the higher processor frequency.	St
1.3.3	Good purchase!	St
1.3.4	TimWoodChip #ignite Disclosure: TimWoodChip is an Intel employee and aspirational sponsor of tomorrow.	St
