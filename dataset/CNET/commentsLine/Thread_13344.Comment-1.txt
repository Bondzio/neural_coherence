i am having a problem with one of my first computer builds.
it is all old parts; i am building outside the case to test the main components: the cpu (w/ heatsink & fan), the memory, the graphics card, and the power supply.
when i short the two pins to power up the computer, the cpu fan runs fine; however, my video card (pcie) does not work.
i have tried multiple video cards too, so i believe this is not the problem of the video card.
i think the problem may be with the power supply, because when i plug in a video card that has worked in other pcs previously, its fan does not even run.
i am just looking for someone to point me in the right direction.
might i need a new power supply?
what is the best method to troubleshoot this kind of issue?
thanks in advance for any and all help.
