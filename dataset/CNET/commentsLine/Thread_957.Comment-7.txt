thanks for the great information.
one more question (hopefully the last, for your sake because you're probably getting tired of being pestered): in addition to the netgear 2000, which one would you recommend out of the ones listed on this page:  i've looked at these, but i really can't tell the difference (other than the price and that two of them are gigabit routers).
thanks.
