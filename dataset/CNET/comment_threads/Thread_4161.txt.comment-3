I did consider it might be a driver issue but did not feel comfortable trolling the web looking for a needle in a haystack-correct driver.
I did check out the Windows 7 compatibility center.
They listed 2039 monitors/TV's that are compatible with windows 7.
They listed only 3 eMachines monitors.
My eMachines monitor wasn't listed.
I don't have the money to take it to a tech and have them fix the problem.
So I think I will live with the black bar on my screen since it is not really a distraction.
Just thought I'd try and fix it if I could.
