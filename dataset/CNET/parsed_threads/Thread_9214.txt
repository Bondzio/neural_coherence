<s> We are getting this message - more often on Mondays, but we got it today (Wed) on a system when trying to access a network resource. </s>
<s> We have 5 computers, 1 of which sits idle and acts as a &quot;server.&quot; Some client computers get turned off at night, others do not. </s>
<s> All are running both ZoneAlarm and NAV. </s>
<s> We are using a DSL modem, Netgear switch and Linksys router. </s>
<s> About 3 weeks ago, we found that we were getting the above message when trying to access shared folders on the server. </s>
<s> Not all computers misbehave - the problem occurs on different ones on different mornings. </s>
<s> When a system does have the problem, it can still access other shared resources (on other client computers) with no problem. </s>
<s> It can also ping the &quot;server&quot; with no problem. </s>
<s> The clients which fail are both XP and W2K systems. </s>
<s> The ONLY way we have found to get these connections restored is to reboot the server system. </s>
<s> Rebooting the problem clients does nothing. </s>
<s> I've read that this may have something to do with &quot;renewing IP addresses&quot;. </s>
<s> Any suggestions (in plain English)? </s>
<s> Thanks a ton in advance, John </s>
<s> If the server is the one handing out the DHCP information, rebooting it may be a sign the server needs attention. </s>
<s> Nothing in your post tells any other clue. </s>
<s> I'd look at what is the DHCP server. </s>
<s> But as lightwieght your post is, all I can write is where the issue appears to be and nothing more. </s>

<s> Sorry for the lack of tech info. </s>
<s> Our router is the one acting as the DHCP server. </s>
<s> That Linksys was replaced with a new, wireless Linksys and that didn't solve a thing. </s>
<s> A new product doesn't mean the device has the latest firmware. </s>
<s> And something else... For example, I picked up a new Dlink. </s>
<s> It would not connect to the ISP or hand out Wifi DHCP information. </s>
<s> At first I thought &quot;what a piece of junk&quot;. </s>
<s> But then I remembered to check the firmware and sure enough there was new firmware. </s>
<s> Said device is now just fine all around. </s>
<s> Next, since you are using the linksys as the DHCP server, is it on the UPS so you know it's not subject to brownouts and odd power outages? </s>
<s> In closing, if some other DHCP server is on the network, then you could have a design issue to deal. </s>
<s> And finally, when I see this, I take a laptop to the linksys (or other) and jack right into it's ports to see if I can get a DHCP linkup. </s>
<s> If not, I power cycle the linksys to see if that was the issue. </s>
<s> So far only one replacement due to that. </s>

<s> Bob, Thanks for the suggestions. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, none of these issues is of concern (they have all already been addressed). </s>
<s> Since it is only this one computer that is inaccessible at times, I lean towards something having changed on it - like a Windows Update or ZoneAlarm update which is aggravating things. </s>
<s> Pain in the butt. </s>
<s> J </s>
<s> In that case, look to see if they let Windows Update install a driver. </s>
<s> If so, you've found it. </s>
<s> As to Zone Alarm, you are on your own. </s>
<s> I have to remove it and use the native NT/2000/XP/2003 firewall when I see such. </s>
<s> Zonelabs had support for such. </s>
