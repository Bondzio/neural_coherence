<s> would like to upgrade my Intel 450 megahertz processor to something faster, but I don't know what to get or where to get it. </s>
<s> Anyone know what to do? </s>
<s> Thanks... S </s>
<s> We're definitely going to need more info to even begin to try to help with that one. </s>
<s> It depends on several factors. </s>
<s> Whether the board and bios support a faster cpu, whether a faster cpu is even available for that board seeing as the one running on it is....well terribly outdated. </s>
<s> It may be that a simple bios update could enable the board to handle a faster cpu, but then you'd have to find a cpu that's faster than the one you have that's compatible. </s>
<s> I doubt very much if it'll support anything that's still sold on the market. </s>
<s> I'm going to have a look at the NEC Z1 config and see of they have any info, I'll get back to you. </s>
<s> I just had a look at the specs on that NEC Z1. </s>
<s> The manufacturer claims that processor is upgradeable but doesn't state to what speed. </s>
<s> Honestly seeing as how it had 96 Mb of pc-100 ram installed stock and is only capable of supporting 256 Mb, I'm not entirely sure you'd want to invest the money on a processor that even though would be faster than the one you have, is still going to be terribly outdated. </s>
<s> That's a decision only you can make. </s>
<s> The processor is a Slot 1 pentium III Matai, they only go to 600 mhz. </s>
<s> That kind of trouble, epsecially given the all in one design of the computer, for 150 mhz, is not even close to worth the time to me. </s>
<s> If it would happen that the board supported coppermine cpu's you could go right up to 1.1 ghz, but I seriously doubt the board is calibrated to support the extra voltage the cpu would require. </s>
<s> if you want to see if any CPU's are available. </s>
<s> Go to http://www.pricewatch.com </s>
<s> Thanks...the problem is, I don't have any info about it other than it is an Intel Pentium III 450 mhz cpu. </s>
<s> I appreciate your checking! </s>
<s> S </s>
<s> I checked, but I have no idea what to look for. </s>
<s> S </s>
<s> If you check my original post you'll see the specs for the processor. </s>
<s> Pentium III 450 mhz slot 1. make sure there are no other designations after slot 1. </s>
<s> As I mentioned the coppermine pentium III's were slot one as well, but I'd have to do more reasearch into whether they're compatible, I seriously doubt it though. </s>
<s> Bear in mind the original slot 1 PIII's only went to 600 mhz. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info...I missed it yesterday. </s>
<s> I guess it probably isn't worth it, but it is such a nifty little computer. </s>
<s> The NEC Z1 is a neat little computer, shame they aren't making them anymore. </s>
<s> Small all-in-one foot print on the desk. </s>
<s> I upgraded mine several years back when the 850 mhz PIII's came on the market. </s>
<s> I doubt you can go much beyond that speed since the bios fails to report beyond 800. </s>
<s> I think I also upgraded the firmware in it. </s>
<s> The processor you need is a SLOT 1 Intel P3 850mhz. </s>
<s> You need to buy the intel box set and what that means is the one with active cooling. </s>
<s> It has the heat sink and fan already mounted on the processor card. </s>
<s> You unplug the old processor and plug in the new one. </s>
<s> You can also upgrade the ram to 512MB using 2-256MB SDRAMs. </s>
<s> Hope that was helpful. </s>
<s> Thanks...that is just exactly what I was looking for. </s>
<s> Someone who had done it and knew what I needed. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> I will give it a go! </s>

<s> Thanks </s>
<s> just build a new pc. </s>
<s> it doesnt have to be top of the line, anything would be better than that. </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> Actually, this is a really neat little computer. </s>
<s> I have 3 other computers, so I don't need to build a new one. </s>
<s> Thanks tho! </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> OK...I got the CPU upgrade, now how do I get the d*** back off to put it in. </s>
<s> I can find no schematics anywhere to give me the secret combination. </s>
<s> If anyone knows, please help me. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Hey tjsampair, can you please tell me where you got the bios update for the NEC Z1 i have the same pc, also did the same upgrades you did but now my BIOS seems to be currupted so if possible can you send info i know this is an old post but hope your still around to give some info... </s>
<s> Cheers Man Hope to hear from yah! </s>
