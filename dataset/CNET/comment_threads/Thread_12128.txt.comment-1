Question for all new computer owners.
Which of the newer chipsets support windows 9x?
it does not matter which brand or model i have just just arrived from the stone age shopping for computer but came across this shocking warning from MSI website http://www.msicomputer.com which says: MSI Reminds you : Because of the limitations of chipset, this MB does not support Win98/ME The message was posted for all MSI boards Then I went to intel website http://www.intel.com/support/chipsets/inf/sb/cs-013808.htm to verify what the heck is happening to newer chipsets and to my dismay found this info there: The Intel Chipset Software Installation Utility is not available on any systems with the Intel 955X Express Chipset or Intel 945 Express Chipset family running Windows 98 SE or Windows ME Does it mean windows 9x is toast?
Will it never work on any newer computer running intel 9xx chipset family?
Which newer motherboards support windows 9x?
