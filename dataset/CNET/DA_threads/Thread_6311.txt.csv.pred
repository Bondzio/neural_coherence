1.1.1	Have an old Toshiba Portege 3015 ultraportable .	St
1.1.2	It 's so close to the size of a modern netbook it made me wonder if I could load netbook software to make it a useful machine again .	St
1.1.3	Right now it 's on Windows ME .	St
1.1.4	( When 's the last time you saw that ? )	Ques
1.1.5	Current specs are : Intel Pentium & # 63720 ; 266Mhz ( 2.0V/2.5V ) w/MMX Technology Integrated Coprocessor Yes Processor Cache 32KB : ( 16KB code ; 16KB data ) External data bus width 64 bit External data/address bus speed 66 MHz Memory -- maxed out at 96 meg	St
1.2.1	have been sensible choice , but given XP 's base minimum requirements , it would actually make the old toshiba crawl instead of flying .	St
1.2.2	Instead , I would just do a reload of WinME to clear out all the old junks and make it useful as simple.. err.. web-browsing ( if it is ever simple webpages ) .	St
1.3.1	netbooks have much better hardware and you 'll need to go down to a low resource linux and may not be worth the effort due to your laptop 's graphics limitation ( you may only have 512kb graphics to 1mb which was the norm at the time ) .	St
1.4.1	I would say windows 2000 might run OK , I would say something like menuet OS , http : //www.menuetos.net/	St
