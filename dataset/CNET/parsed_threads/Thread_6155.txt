<s> Just bought a Buffalo WHR-HP-G300N router that is capable of 300 Mpbs. </s>
<s> I have an HP DV4-1120us laptop with a built in Broadcom 4322AG 802.11a/b/g/draft-n WiFi Adapter. </s>
<s> Got the router set up this morning, set it to the N settings, but my connection speed is still 54 Mpbs. </s>
<s> Can anyone advise me on configuring my NIC, or is it a waste of time? </s>
<s> Should I simply go with an N USB adapter? </s>
<s> I'd like to take advantage of the faster router. </s>
<s> Thanks, Steve </s>
<s> Back in draft n days you learned that higher speeds only worked where the client and the router were from the same maker. </s>
<s> The lesson repeats today. </s>
<s> But a comment. </s>
<s> Since your internet connection is about 10 times slower than 54 megabit, why fix this? </s>

<s> Well... </s>
<s> I guess I got caught up in the numbers. </s>
<s> I'm planning on buying a Roku HD (XR) box http://www.roku.com/roku-products to stream Pandora and Netflix wirelessly and just thought if everything was set up to be as fast as possible, I'd have less issues. </s>
<s> I have a Lenovo y530 over 802.11g and hulu does fine over 802.11g. </s>
<s> I've tried cbs.com and a few others too. </s>
<s> But there is one thing. </s>
<s> My network is setup exactly like the sticky at the top of this forum. </s>
<s> Which is likely why I have so little trouble. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Which sticky (exactly)? </s>
<s> There are a few. </s>
<s> Try the one with the most entries. </s>
<s> Hmmm... well, nothing sounds very complicated there... </s>
<s> I DO have my new router working fine, connected all external devices with no problems. </s>
<s> I just set it up WPA2-PSK (TKIP) at 40Hz. </s>
<s> Seems fine, guess I'll find out when I hook up my Roku. </s>
<s> Thanks, Steve </s>
<s> But the forum sticky leans to WPA. </s>
<s> I like WPA2 if only it would work with everything. </s>
