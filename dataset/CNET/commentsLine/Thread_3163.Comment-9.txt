norton pretty much ignored partition magic since they purchased it.
there hasn't been a new version in years and it doesn't officially support windows vista.
if you are going to buy a partition utility i would buy one that has an actual future.
i would either look towards gparted or one of the non-abandoned commercial solutions.
acronis has a decent partition management utility that you might try.
