<s> I bought the HIS Radeon X1550 64 bit to help update my system, but i'm having a few problems and i have a few Questions. </s>
<s> My GPU history was a Diamond 9250 256mb DDR 128bit, then i got a PNY 8400GS 512mb GDDR2 64bit card, returned the 8400gs for fianance reasons, saved up and bought this instead. </s>
<s> Both the 8400 and this are 64 bit, they both had problems with madden 06, glitchy, but the 9250 was perfect, at about medium settings. </s>
<s> If you know how to fix this please tell me. </s>
<s> Next the GPU-Z program says my Bus Bandwith is like 3.1 gb/s. </s>
<s> But the 8400 ran at 6.4 and so did the 9250 radeon, they both only required a 300 Watt PSU(i have a 250) but the X1550 says it needs 450watt, and on the Tigerdirect site it said that it had a 12.8gb/s banwith, and the HIS site said 6.4gb/s(more beilivable) would this be a PSU issue or something else i really want that bandwith, or could it be GPU-Z. </s>

<s> your performance issues are to be expected since it's a very low-end gpu with 64bit memory using a pci slot. </s>
<s> (agp or pci-express cards would run a lot faster.) </s>
<s> you should only use the drivers bundled with the card -- *don't* use ati/amd's latest drivers. </s>
<s> your power supply is probably not an issue since the card draws all of its power from the pci slot. </s>
<s> the amount of current in a pci slot can deliver is fixed and does not change based on the power supply. </s>
<s> I know PCI sucks, i have had AGP on a Pentium 3 board and considered going back just for the AGP. </s>
<s> But the PNY 8400gs 64 bit PCI card i used to have(also lowend chipset) ran at 6.3gb/s, same as my old 128 bit 9250, confusing? </s>
<s> thanks, bigboy </s>
