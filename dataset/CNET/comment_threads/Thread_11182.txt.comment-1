I just upgraded to an ati x700 pro and can't figure out the bios menu (i can get to the bios - i just don't understand it).
There's no specific mention of on-board video that i can see (just a bunch of bios acronyms).
Obviously, i'm no computer expert and would appreciate if someone could tell me EXACTLY how to disable the on-board video on this machine.
It's a stock machine from Circuit City, so all stock system information applies.
Thanks, in advance!
