thanks again for all the advice.
as i said, i am not a gamer, so it would appear the x1600 will do nicely for me - and the price seems right.
my only concern now is the motherboard i intended to use (gigabyte ga-965p-ds4) seems to be having problems.
i just heard from my dealer that gigabyte recently recalled all these boards because of a design flaw in the chipset.
who knows if the next release will be stable!
gonna have to do some more research on this board.
again, thanks for all the advice for the video card!
