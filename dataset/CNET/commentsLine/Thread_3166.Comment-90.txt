all hard drives have a certain life expectancy, although it all depends on how they are used and how you keep them.
if you keep them in a dusty, non-ventilated room and you are smoking 50 **** a day near them then i'd give them a couple of weeks before they die.
however keep them in a good well ventilated area, and clean from dust, away from smoke, etc and they could last a number of years (sometimes even decades).
in addition to this it's also down to drive electronics, no-one can predict exactly how long all the electronics are going to last for in a hard drive.
you also have to consider other external factors which you can do nothing about, such as fire.
one place i used to work in had a major problem when they kept all their hard drives downstairs in a place that was on a flood plain (hmmm... guess what happened?).
luckily they'd kept all the paperwork upstairs, but they had to go through all the paperwork one by one and put it back onto new hard drives a very time consuming process.
so even if you wonder whether or not a hard drive will fail you also have to learn from their mistakes and take into account outside factors as well as whether or not the hard drive itself will fail.
a lot of my stuff i keep a copy on mmc memory cards, hard drive, and gmail that way if my hdd dies i've got it on either my mmc cards or gmail, if google goes bankrupt or anything i've got it on mmc cards and hard drive, and if the mmc cards die (probably the most likely one to go first!)
then i've got it backed up on hard drive or google.
in addition to this if anyone breaks into our house and steals the hard drive or memory cards the files are still there on google.
that is another important thing to remember if backing up your important files, ensure you keep a spare copy of them somewhere else other than in your house.
that way even if someone breaks into your house and steals your items your files are safe outside of the house.
