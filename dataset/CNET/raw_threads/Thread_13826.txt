Configuration is as follows: Laptop connects to AP1 (wireless) AP1 connects to AP2 (ethernet cable) AP2 connects to AP3 (wireless)(AP3 is somewhere in the neighbourhood, i dont know where) Some of the APs or all of them may work as bridges, i dont know since i do not have access to their interfaces. I have a desktop, which is connected to my laptop with a crossover ethernet cable. Wireless connection details: IP: 192.168.1.72 Mask: 255.255.0.0 Gateway: 192.168.3.2 DNS: 192.168.3.2 LAN details: Laptop's IP: 10.10.10.1 Desktop's IP: 10.10.10.2 Mask: 255.255.255.0 I want to share the Laptop's internet connection with my desktop. Tried ICS, bridging, etc. but nothing seems to be working. How do I do that? Any ideas?

Be sure to use TRACEROUTE on the host (XP) machine to see if there is a 10.10.10.x or 10.x.x.x in the route. This could cause your NAT (ICS) to fail. Fix? Use that other 168.x.x.x private IP range for ICS. Also, many are firewalling beyond reason and while you are setting up you must have a firm grasp on the firewall. For my testing I often turn it off and if it's a third party firewall I often find they break ICS so I uninstall it. Bob

Internet sharing of this type is tricky, quirky and can negatively affect the internet performance of both. ICS uses a specific network address scheme for host and client PCs. Try to better define the hardware that is in your home. You said AP 1, 2 and 3 but the connection layout doesn't sound right. Might this be some sort of wireless subscriber network that's available in your neighborhood that would cost you more if you connect more than one device?
