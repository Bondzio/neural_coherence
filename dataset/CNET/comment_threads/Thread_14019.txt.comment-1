I can't pick between the D-Link DI-624 and the Linksys WRT54GS for my wireless router....LapTop Magizine rates the D-Link as the Top performer out of the wireless routers they tested....however I have my wired network on linksys parts and have liked their service and support.... *Question is*: Would it be better to go with D-Link, on its performance rating, then hook up the computers with matching D-Link or other company adpaters *OR* Go with Linksys and matching Linksys adpaters making the network on all one company's product, hoping to gain performance this way?
Thanks for the advice
