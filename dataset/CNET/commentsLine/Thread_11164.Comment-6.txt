glad we could help.
now that it is all working, confirm that the security settings on the wireless links are up to snuff.
i don't remember if you mentioned anything about that (as the problem was deeper than that), but wifi security settings are a sore point with me.
my day is not complete unless i've harrassed somebody about making sure they are tight.
