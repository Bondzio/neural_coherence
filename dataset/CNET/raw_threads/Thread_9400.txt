I now want to use the cd r/rw to replace the cd rom drive that I've got in my machine (HP Pavilion 7910 running windows ME). Plugging it in seemed to work Ok and I've downloaded the driver from the MITSUMI website. But the drive seems to think it is still a CD ROM and not a CD R/rw drive, (although it did recognise the drive was a different make to the old one). So I can't write anything! I've looked in the device manager and it does not seem to give an option for installing a cd r/rw; it only lists a cd rom. What am I missing here? How do I get the PC to recognise that I've got a cd writer installed? Cheers for any help
