The line comes on after few minutes of turning on the monitor. Would this be most likely the monitor or the video card? Is the only way to check by plugging the pc to a different monitor? Thanks

If you have it is probably one of those. Connecting your monitor to a new PC is best bet, but plugging another monitor to your PC would also work.
