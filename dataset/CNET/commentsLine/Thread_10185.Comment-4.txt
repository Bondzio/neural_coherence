i found that out also, newegg is refusing to answer any questions also, especially on advertising matters.
one of their customer service people (an assistant manager i believe) called me on the issues and assured me on the phone that he'd get the answers to my questions from rosewill a couple times while on the phone.
then he confirmed that he'd get the answers via e-mail.
after i sent him the questions....guess what....no answers.
then a manager contacted me, he won't provide any answers either, in fact like rosewill he just ignores it.
maybe because one of the questions is about a rosewill psu they advertise as sli certified, which apparently isn't, anyway can find a cert for it and they won't provide any documentation.
