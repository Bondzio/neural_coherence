Hi I wanted to know what the best way to reformat a LaCie HD from a Mac format to a Windows Vista format is?
I have the LaCie big disk 500GB with firewire and USB.
I'm using a format program on my Mac thats making the LaCie into a MS-DOS file system.
Will this work or do I need to try something new?
Thank you for your help.
