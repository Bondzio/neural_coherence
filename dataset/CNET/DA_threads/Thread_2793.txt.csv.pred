1.1.1	I need a desk-top but I need NO BELLS AND WHISTLES.	St
1.1.2	Speed is not terribly important nor is memory.	St
1.1.3	100G HD and a dozen or so RAM is all I'll need.	St
1.1.4	I do not game nor will I ever.	St
1.1.5	I need XP Office and Powerpoint.	St
1.1.6	Other than that only a 17'' flat-screen monitor and a CD-burner completes my package.	St
1.1.7	I don't need any technical support either.	St
1.1.8	I really don't need a warranty.	St
1.1.9	I've used a Presario 700 laptop for the last four years and had no problems.	St
1.1.10	Thus, should I purchase a new budget desktop or go to ebay and buy the separate components?	St
1.1.11	Tnanks in advance... Cavaleer	St
1.2.1	here's one for $750 with dual core cpu that meets your specs: http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/HP-Pavilion-17-Widescreen-Notebook-PC-DV-9410-US/sem/rpsm/oid/184835/catOid/-12963/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do it's pretty hard to build your own cheaper than the $400 specials.	St
1.2.2	the windows OS is $100 so $300 barely covers the hardware.	St
1.2.3	http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/Acer-Aspire-Desktop-PC-AST180-UD400A/sem/rpsm/oid/184840/catOid/-12962/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do if you're going to build your own, definitely go to newegg.com, zipzoomfly.com, tigerdirect.com, etc.	St
1.2.4	i buy from ebay frequently but no ebay seller can beat the prices of the websites i mentioned for the same new hardware.	St
1.2.5	here's a $470 (including shipping) configuration: asus barebones (case, power supply, mobo), $135: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=155018 amd athlon x2 4200+ cpu, $75: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=80725-9 wd 200gb sata drive, $75: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=101213-11 corsair 1gb ddr2-667, $39: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=85016-46 sony/nec 18x dvd burner, $30: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=172479 logitech keyboard/optical mouse, $15: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=211126 windows vista premium, $99: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=604699 17&quot; LCDs are the same price as 19&quot; LCDs now.	St
1.2.6	Monitors always on sale somewhere so just wait a week or two until you see one for less than $160.	St
1.2.7	Otherwise, here's a couple of choices: asus 19&quot; widescreen, $190 before $30 rebate: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=10005838 hanns-g 19&quot; widescreen, $173: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824254023 acer 17&quot;, $180: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009088 acer 19&quot;, $180: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009115	St
1.3.1	Many thanks!	St
1.3.2	I don't want to spend more than $700.	St
1.3.3	This will be a true utility appliance compared to what others are doing with their computers.	St
1.3.4	The laptop question is a good one.	St
1.3.5	On one hand I don't want to spend $2000 on a laptop when I could buy the same tools for 500-700.	St
1.3.6	I have other places I'd like to spend that money since my computer truly will be an appliance.	St
1.3.7	On the other hand I will be traveling a great deal in the coming months and I can see the eventual superiority of a laptop.	St
1.3.8	For the moment, however, a desktop will take care of my immediate needs and when/if I see the real need for a laptop, I'll buy one.	St
1.3.9	lol	St
1.4.1	I just browsed Circuit City and I can find something perfect for me for more or less the same price as the separate components.	St
1.4.2	I'll check Best Buy for comparison sake.	Sug
1.4.3	I can drive to both locations as well.	St
1.4.4	Many thanks again, Cavaleer	Polite
