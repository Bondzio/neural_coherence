<s> Room mate just purchased a Presario 502us laptop with a built in WLAN NIC with the broadcom chipset running Vista Basic Home edition. </s>
<s> The WLAN card recognizes various wireless networks in the immediate area. </s>
<s> I can connect to the router via cable through the Ethernet NIC. </s>
<s> I have several other computers currently active on the wireless network. </s>
<s> All the other systems are running XP Pro SP2 I do not see my wireless network on the 502us even though I see other networks including one creatively named &quot;netgear&quot;. </s>
<s> Because the CG814WG is distributed to several ISP's, Netgear does not support the firmware and my ISP has been little help since I couldn't get past tier one support. </s>
<s> Anyone out there have any ideas I might try? </s>
<s> Anyone else experience any issues with Vista or Broadcom chipsets and this particular modem/router? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any help. </s>

<s> Are owners that have wifi routers that connect to all machines but one. </s>
<s> It's hard for them to accept it when I reenable SSID broadcast, turn off wep/wpa and get it connected. </s>
<s> We then experiment to see what security does work. </s>
<s> We also test the laptop at hotspots if it doesn't connect. </s>
<s> If it doesn't at 2 hotspots and my laptop does then it's either a bum install of the OS or dead hardware. </s>
<s> Sometimes the owner didn't know to use the button on the laptop to turn the wifi on and off. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> No other settings needed to be changed, just wasn't picking up the SSID until I reset the broadcast settings. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply, -Rob </s>
