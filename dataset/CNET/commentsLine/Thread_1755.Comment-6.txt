already did all of that.
i disabled the on board sound in the bios before installing the sound blaster and uninstalled in windows.
before doing that i downloaded the latest driver from ecs for the via sound that is on the motherboard and the on board sound still did not work.
that is when i bought the sound blaster card.
the version motherboard i have is 8. the system is about 4 years old.
since the on board sound stopped working and the new card don't work even though is showed it is working properly that there might be something wrong in windows.
oh yes i have powered speakers.
when the on board sound quit working the error it had was that it failed to launch.
