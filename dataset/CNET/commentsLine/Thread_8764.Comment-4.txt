the dell axim the link you give refers to is pocket pc (pda); pics on  for example.
the emc navisphere express is a nas-device from emc2.
that's quite something else and your link isn't applicable to that at all.
i assume such a professional device came with a manual and a support contract.
so all i can say at the moment: read the manual and call your support company.
