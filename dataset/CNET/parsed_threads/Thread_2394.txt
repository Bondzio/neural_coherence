<s> I'm hearing a lot about AMD's new AM2 chips and Intel's new chips will supposedly going to take on AMD for real this time. </s>
<s> With both companies planning new line-ups, does socket 939 have a very long life-span left (I'm hoping for at least 4 years)? </s>
<s> I planned on getting an X2 processor for now, and later get an FX processor if the need arose (though CPU speeds don't seem as important these days). </s>
<s> I've lost a lot of faith in Intel so... </s>
<s> I really didn't look into the P4. </s>
<s> ...AM2 shows no real performance improvement over socket 939. </s>
<s> You might also want to wait for the DX10 video cards to come out. </s>
<s> Yeah, I know about holding off on the GPU for now as all DX9 cards are getting the finger. </s>
<s> The Conroe does sound tempting at 3.3GHz with an 1333MHz FSB so maybe I'll wait and see. </s>
<s> It's supposed to be revealed late next month. </s>
<s> Might be worth a look... </s>
