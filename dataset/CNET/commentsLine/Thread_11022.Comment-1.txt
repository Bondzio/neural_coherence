i have had a netgear wgr614v7 for about 18 months.
attached to it was a mac laptop (leopard), ibm desktop (windows xp), a hp printer and a lenovo laptop (vista).
the desktop and printer were wired, with the mac and thinkpad operating wirelessly.
this past week, the router went bad (the cable company verified that it was the issue) so i bought a new wgr6214v10.
i installed it, and everything works as expected except the lenovo laptop.
if i connect the ethernet cable to the laptop, it works fine, but it will not work wirelessly.
i have spent some time with a technical guy who could not find the problem and suspected that my norton anti-virus might be the culprit.
after spending some time with a netgear tech this afternoon, he felt that the anti-virus software was not the issue that my wireless adapters might be out of date.
i am not a computer maven, but this sounds a bit like &quot;get it off my plate and go somewhere else.&quot; do any of you experts have any suggestions, or should i try another brand of router?
