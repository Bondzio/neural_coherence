I Could get the HD to run, and everything running, except for the monitor. I tried 2 diffrent Monitors, along with diffrent graphics cards. I shut off all power fully, and even unpluged everything. Then Randomly my father did the same thing i did with flipping the power switch on the powersuply and it started up. Can anyone tell me what happend? Should I be worried for the future. Please respond, thankyou.
