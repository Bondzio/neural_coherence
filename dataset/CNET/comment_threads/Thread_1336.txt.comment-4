But the issue is simple.
If one does all this and it doesn't work (as in the case of the expander), then one needs a little education on &quot;how things work&quot;.
I wonder why the no broadcast SSID is debated heavily.
I will NOT enter into any debate but will share that the SSID is going to picked off if packets are flying.
All it does is make the system a little more quiet and stealthy.
