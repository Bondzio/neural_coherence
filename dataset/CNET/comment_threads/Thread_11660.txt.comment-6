Yes that is my laptop and I have no resolved the issue.
It was a driver compatibility issue.
The gateway website has 3 different drivers for the Networking , but some conflict with the Windows Zero Configuration.
I downloaded the 9528158 driver from gateway after uninstalling the broadcom driver.
I extracted the 9528158 driver using TUGzip and once I was at the update driver at the device manager I followed the steps and looked into the 9528158 folder and clicked next but I got the message &quot;The Wizard could not find the software on your computer for...&quot;... Then I went ahead and re-installed the Broadcom 802.11G Network adapter from the folder titled &quot;BCM_REL_4_100_15_5_WHQL&quot; which most likely came from the driver titled &quot;BCM40100.exe from the gateway drivers website - Broadcom Wireless Driver Version 4.100.15.5&quot; and my wireless radio worked and best of all without the Broadcom software conflicting with Windows Zero Configuration software.
Once I had that working I went to Control Panel&gt;Network and Internet Connections&gt;Wireless Network Setup Wizard&quot;&gt;Setup a new wireless network&gt; followed the onscreen instructions and I connected to my wireless network.
and Viola!!
My wireless internet works now :]
