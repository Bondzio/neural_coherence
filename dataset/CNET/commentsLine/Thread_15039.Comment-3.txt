if they are already infected, i take them to a separate machine that has an antivirus installed, one that i use just for this purpose, plug them in as external devices and immediately format them at least twice.
not the quick format option, but the full format.
if there is sensitive data on the drive, then i use a wiping method that does at least 7 passes or the data can be retrieved using various tools.
so to sum up: you can plug them into a different computer that has the antivirus installed, right click on the drive and then hit format or tools/format depending on the os.
if there is sensitive data on the drive that you don't want retrieved ever, use the ccleaner wipe feature with 7 passes minimum or use eraser.
