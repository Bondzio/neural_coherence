<s> I have added a dvd reader to the computer and now it restarts and no internet connection. </s>
<s> I found some wires that i am not sure about (red CPU) (Black VGA) (yellow HDD) dont know where they go can anyone help. </s>
<s> It also says that it is had a fatal shutdown. </s>

<s> The new DVD drive if completely disconnected will allow the system to boot as before? </s>
<s> If not, then some connection(s), etc., may have been done or improper setup. </s>
<s> Review the work and see what that maybe. </s>
<s> Again, we have no clue if this is SATA or IDE type drive. </s>
<s> If no manual came with the new DVD drive, check their support website and find the DVD model# and get the install manual or guide. </s>
<s> If so needed, you should verify in the bios area, what if it sees the new DVD when connected, what it reports during boot-up after reconnecting the DVD properly. </s>
<s> If it still reboots on its own, then report back. </s>
