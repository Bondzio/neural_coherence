I'm not the one to give you the answer to the various security levels, but I have the same hardware as you and did have the same problem.
I disabled security and used Mac Filtering and have had no problems since.
Mine is a home network and there were only to other networks in my area and both were 'secure'.
I figure that Mac filtering will stop the guy with a laptop driving down my street looking for unsecured networks.
