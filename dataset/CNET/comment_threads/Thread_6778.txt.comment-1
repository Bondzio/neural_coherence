Hi!
Recently we are thinking of investing on a fixed IP address.
So am I right to say that if I want people outside of our network, from the Internet to access to our computer, we just do some modification at the router's Network Address Translation (NAT), to map the internal IP of the computer to the fixed IP?
Then if people want to access this computer through the Internet, they just type the IP address in their browser?
