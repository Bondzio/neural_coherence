in the usa and most countries there are legal limits to how much power your router and devices can emit.
so what you should discover is that there is not perfect router that rules them all.
i have many routers if you count the ones at the office but for home i picked a simple netgear 3800. it covers an area half your space with ease and further at lower numbers of bars.
but i wonder why you are asking this question.
that is, you should have seen this question before and know what the answer is.
