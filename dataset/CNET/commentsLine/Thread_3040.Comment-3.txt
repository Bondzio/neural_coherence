bios shows 502gb but winxp disk manager shows four partitions h:155gb(works ok) g:421gb (i transferred about 120gb but now shows unformatted by my computer - and here lays the problem) and two more partitions without letters the first 310gb(free space adnotated by windows) and a last partition no letter 1.99 gb.
the issue i cna't format g: because i shall loose the data.
thank you so much for your answer!!
