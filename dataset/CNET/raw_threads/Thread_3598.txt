My main tasks would be: Some games(guild wars which is the most demanding) itunes docs PVP media software frequent internet internet games dvds i had been looking at laptops, but i cant upgrade the video card, which i will want to. I also prefer the newest athlon dual-core processore

It's not my choice if you want to upgrade in the near future. The graphics they offer are not the best if you want to do some hard-core gaming.

They dont make you buy any crap that you dont want or need, and the have an upgrade plan, this lets you send in your system and pick the newest upgrades so you can keep up with the times, this plan gives you a discount for being a previous buyer. If your looking for a really good comp, check out www.Velocitymicro.com. Oh and i dont know what &quot;micro&quot; has to do with anything cause they are regular sized comps.

I think you get a case, motherboard, PSU, and CPU. If you are spending $$$$, try Overdrive PC. They are the *best* boutique company, but I think it might be overkill for what you want... ~Ibrahim~
