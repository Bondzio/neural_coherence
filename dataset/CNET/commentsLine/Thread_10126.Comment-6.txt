hi bob, 2 and 3 are likely not applicable: the problem happened just after unpacking the machine, without having time to get spyware from internet.
for what concerns bios/drivers, the support of both dell and d-link checked this up, i have all latest releases (new machine, new card).
so i go for 1) searching in the event - but no sure what i am suppose to look for.
kind regards hedi
