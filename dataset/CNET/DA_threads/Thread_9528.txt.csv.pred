1.1.1	Excuse my ignorance , what would be the best disc to use to record still photo 's onto ?	Ques
1.1.2	CD-R , DVD-R etc . ?	Ques
1.1.3	I 'll use it to store photos onto and to take to the photo lab to get hard copies made .	St
1.1.4	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Really it 's your choice , although the Photo Lab may have a say in it .	St
1.3.2	You should check with them first whether they have a computer with a DVD compatible drive , or just a CD ROM .	Sug
1.3.3	DVD R disks have much more capacity than CD R disks so that could be a factor for you if you have a large number of photos .	St
1.3.4	But even CDR 's would hold thousands of photos in jpeg format .	St
1.3.5	Bitmap format images are larger so you would get less for your dollar , so to speak .	St
1.3.6	Disks are cheap enough , so why not try a set of both .	St
1.3.7	Of course , you do need a DVD recording capable drive to burn to DVD 's but most DVD drives nowadays also play and burn to CD .	St
1.3.8	Good luck Mark	Polite
1.4.1	Go with DVD+R and not DVD-R. Go with CD+R and not CD-R .	St
1.4.2	They use updated criteria and are generally considered better quality formats .	St
1.4.3	and life goes on ... Jack	St
1.5.1	Unless I 'm mistaken , ''CD+R '' does n't exist .	St
1.5.2	There 's CD-ROM , CD-R , CD-RW , DVD-R , DVD-RW , DVD+R , DVD+RW , DVD-ROM , and DVD-RAM , along with double-layer versions of DVD-R and DVD+R , and mini CDs .	St
1.5.3	Coming soon is HD-DVD and and Blue-ray .	St
1.5.4	However , ''CD+R '' is one format I 've yet to encounter ouside Area-51 .	St
1.5.5	-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - For personal backup , if you have a DVD burner , DVD is the best option , as it can store up to 4.7GB of data on a single-sided disk .	St
1.5.6	( A double-layer disk can hold twice as much . )	St
1.5.7	On the other hand , a CD , while maxing out at 750MB , is more universably accepted .	St
1.5.8	Unless your photo developer has a DVD drive , you 'd better stick to a CD .	St
1.5.9	Aside from that , there 's the question between writable ( R ) and rewritable ( RW ) .	St
1.5.10	The first can only be recorded to once , though you can usually add more later ( depending on your burning software 's settings ) if it has n't been filled .	St
1.5.11	This means you wo n't be able to change file names or use the disk for any other purpose .	St
1.5.12	( Best if you want to keep the pics on disk and already have the ''layout '' decided . )	St
1.5.13	If you want to be able to wipe the disk clean after the photos have been printed , or want to be able to make changes to the contents of the disk , one that 's rewritable would be your best option .	St
1.5.14	Finally , make sure your burner supports the format of disk you have .	St
1.5.15	For instance , a DVD+R/RW drive can only burn CD-R , CD-RW , DVD+R , and DVD+RW ( not DVD-R or DVD-RW ) .	St
1.5.16	On the flip side , a DVD-R/RW drive can only burn CD-R , CD-RW , DVD-R , and DVD-RW ( not DVD+R or DVD+RW ) .	St
1.5.17	Only a multi-format burner can handle both DVD+R/RW and DVD-R/RW formats , and only a burner that supports double-layer technology can burn a DVD+R DL or DVD-R DL disk .	St
1.5.18	Unfortunately the industry just ca n't make it simple .	St
1.5.19	( Even the Betamax vs VHS debate is being relived now in the form of Blue-ray vs HD-DVD ... the two new DVD formats sporting high-definition capabilities . )	St
1.5.20	In short , I recommend simply printing your digital photos from your memory card , as it tends to be the simplest method .	St
1.5.21	However , if you want/need to use a disk , your best bet would be to call ahead and find out what types they support .	St
1.5.22	If they do n't know , you ca n't go wrong with CD-R. And always , always remember to keep a backup on disk , preferably a DVD .	St
1.5.23	Hope this helps , John	St
1.6.1	I have a cd/dvd combo burner in my Thinpad notebook computer .	St
1.6.2	I was going to use it to backup the work I do for clients on a daily basis .	St
1.6.3	Mostly large Excel files .	St
1.6.4	Is dvd-ram now the best choice ?	Ques
1.6.5	Or should I stick to dvd+rw ?	Ques
1.6.6	Lawrence	St
1.7.1	I bypass optical discs completely .	St
1.7.2	For the most part , I save my money and upload the photos to Wal-Mart 's photo lab ( use the lab of your choice ) .	St
1.7.3	I can pick up my prints as early as an hour later .	St
1.7.4	Works for me .	St
1.8.1	Although DVD-RAM is considered more ideal for archiving purposes due to it 's longer life span ( though that 's somewhat negated since you 'll be making fresh backups daily ) , the disks themselves are more expensive , take longer to be burned , and only work in a select number of DVD burners .	St
1.8.2	( I have a ten-month-old 16X multi-format double-layer DVD burner and it 's not even capable of handling DVD-RAM . )	St
1.8.3	You can get a pretty god explanation of the format by clicking here , but I 'd recommend sticking with DVD+RW , at least until HD-DVD or Blue-ray become widely available .	St
1.8.4	Hope this helps , John	St
1.9.1	I do use CD-R and DVD+R for backups and storage .	St
1.10.1	NIL	St
1.11.1	It 's just that CD+R has been such a well-kept secret I was shocked you would divulge such information in these forums , and even more so to find out you work for the agency .	St
1.11.2	But , since you let the cat out of the bag , I might as well let everyone know that Bill Gates , as part of a joint venture with the CIA , is planning on launching the new media , CD+R as a competing format to HD-DVD and Blue-ray .	St
1.11.3	Get ready people , for the Format of the Year awards are only a few months away .	St
1.11.4	And remember , the polls close at 21:00 Zulu .	St
1.11.5	Sorry , but I just had to have a little fun with that one .	St
