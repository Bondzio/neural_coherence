they are ide drives not sata,my new machine is sata and i didn't want to deal with it.. i guess i've had good luck with the electronics of my machines, on the other hand most of my problems have been anti - mal-ware that didn't work as advertised.
one of the above drives was infested with mal-ware and my anti- virus soft ware didn't warn me.
at the time it seemed the easiest way to transfer the data form the other machine...bad idea.
