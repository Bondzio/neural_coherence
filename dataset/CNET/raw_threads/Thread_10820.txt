It takes up much less space than a printer plus copier. It looks great and its fun to use. BUT, I have not had a good picture out of it yet. Can you tell me why my prints have vertical white lines all along the picture please? Also, regardless of the vertical white lines the picture quality is nowhere near as good as on the computer screen, the picture is not cleanly cut, it seems slightly fuzzy. I have read that it is best to use Cannon paper for good results but even that would not cure the white line problem!
