the way most av detection works is finding &quot;known&quot; malware strings.
basically, it tries very hard, but if you don't have the latest av update plus an av pgm.
that's really a good one, some malware can slip by.
while limewire is a known source for malware which is why the tech mentioned it.
if it isn't a h/w issue but a virus one, then yes you pay for that service.
you contend since you check regularly it not an issue, well often enough, malware does get through.
i suggest you re-install(delete current) avast av pgm.. install it and when it asks to reboot, allow it the boot level scan to complete the install.
then update it, and re-run the scan again(this is not the same scan).
you now have a more intense scanning, before possibility any malware can act.
if results show bad, you have to act.
if not, then you can think repair shop, etc.
thinking its not a malware issue.
no telling what maybe found but at least you tried.
of course you should clean well the system case of dust bunnies as heat build-up is a frequent source of system reboots.
you can try that 1st and then the avast re-install.
i like to part that basically what you have been told from hp and vendors is pretty much typical.
