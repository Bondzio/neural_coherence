I have a 5 yr old Dell desktop that is ready to be replaced.
I want an inexpensive replacement that will be able to handle all the basics (email, internet, Quicken, etc.)
plus some basic YouTube video and picture editing.
I won't be using it for gaming but I might want to be able to stream to my TV at some point.
What are some suggestions?
I'd really like to keep the total below $700 Thanks!
