1.1.1	Moved to a new place some weeks ago and did n't bother reconnecting the my home built computer .	St
1.1.2	Decided to replace my seasonic 550w power supply with a new 750w Antec EA-750 power supply .	St
1.1.3	I then reconnected my Viewsonic VX2025wm monitor and turned on the computer and got the dreaded & quot ; no signal & quot ; on the monitor .	St
1.1.4	Not only that , but my GTX 260 graphics card fan is really loud for some reason .	St
1.1.5	I tried a different monitor , a VX2433wm , on the computer and still got no signal on either of the DVI ports on the GTX 260 .	St
1.1.6	I connected the VX2025wm monitor on my parents ' Dell computer and it worked .	St
1.1.7	Could the new power supply have damaged my video card ?	Ques
1.1.8	I have no idea whats going on !	St
1.2.1	Or a cable is touching the fan .	St
1.2.2	Replacing a PSU is no longer trivial .	St
1.2.3	We have possible connections for the video , the ATX12V connection and what else ?	Ques
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	The computer was working just fine before I changed the power supply .	St
1.3.2	I changed the power supply back to the Seasonic 550w PSU and it still showed & quot ; no signal & quot ; .	St
1.3.3	Could you clarify or simplify your answer ?	Ques
1.3.4	You said a cable is touching the fan ?	Ques
1.3.5	I checked and there are n't any cables touching the graphics card fan ...	St
1.3.6	The power supply is also connected to a Seagate 5400 RPM hard drive and a Samsung 7200 RPM hard drive .	St
1.3.7	For testing purposes , I only connected the PSU to the parts I needed to turn on the computer and turn down the GPU fan because it was too loud , which was when I encountered the & quot ; no signal & quot ; problem .	St
1.4.1	I can not see your computer but the symptoms point to something touching the fan .	St
1.4.2	BUT YOU DID GIVE UP A GREAT CLUE .	St
1.4.3	GPUs do not take kindly to heat .	St
1.4.4	There are few cards that let you set the speed on those .	St
1.4.5	I wonder if it died ?	Ques
1.4.6	Also your comment about not hooking it all up points to a possible oversight .	St
1.4.7	Again , I offered the most common based on too many machines repaired over the years .	St
1.4.8	Bob	St
1.5.1	I may have forced the computer to turn on or off too many times by pressing the switch on the PSU itself .	St
1.5.2	I wanted to test my new PSU but did n't bother connecting my monitor , keyboard , mouse , etc ...	St
1.6.1	The GPU was working perfectly prior to changing the PSU .	St
1.6.2	I was using a program from EVGA that allowed you to change the fan speed .	St
1.6.3	It was running at 50 degrees celsius at most .	St
1.7.1	It does n't matter .	St
1.7.2	You now get to figure out what 's gone wrong .	St
1.7.3	How about that old extra mounting stud under the motherboard problem ?	Ques
1.7.4	Folk are always getting bit by that and only the new builders will reply & quot ; it worked fine before. & quot ; I always check that stuff out .	St
1.7.5	Bob	St
1.8.1	What kind of problem would the mounting stud cause ?	Ques
1.8.2	I might switch my GPU and see how that goes .	St
1.9.1	Some one puts a stud in where it does n't belong .	St
1.9.2	The new builders tend to think since it worked before & quot ; it ca n't be that. & quot ; That sort of thinking makes my friends in repair some easy income .	St
1.9.3	Bob	St
1.10.1	Took out the video card , and plugged in the integrated video card adapter into my ASUS M3N78 pro motherboard .	St
1.10.2	I managed to get past the startup screen .	St
1.10.3	The problem now is that when I get to the Vista loading screen , the bars manage to move two times before the screen freezes , then I see a BSOD flash for an instant and the screen goes to black	St
1.11.1	But I was talking of checking for that stray mounting post .	St
1.11.2	BUT THIS SOUNDS LIKE PROGRESS !	St
1.11.3	& quot ; no signal on monitor after changing power supply & quot ; to Windows at least starting .	St
1.11.4	As the machine crashes it can corrupt the OS .	St
1.11.5	Maybe the next step is to slip in some new blank HDD and install Windows on that to see if the machine is OK ?	Ques
1.11.6	Bob	St
