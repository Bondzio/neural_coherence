<s> I have a simple DSL router that can connect to a pc via a Ethernet port or a USB port, obviously for machines that cannot support Ethernet. </s>
<s> Just looking through the manual it repeatedly says you should not use both at the same time, but I have been using both so I can get two machines on the net, i.e 1 has the ethernet cable and the other has the USB, why is this not supposed to be allowed, both connections wor fine or will it cause a strain on the hardware? </s>
<s> It's simpler than you suspect. </s>
<s> The design doesn't include a NAT ROUTER that would be required to use more than one such interface. </s>
<s> In closing, I'm sure you could plug it in, but it will not work. </s>
<s> Let me share I will not detail why. </s>

<s> No they both work, Simultaneousley too? </s>
<s> &quot;No they both work, Simultaneousley too?&quot; I know it must be Greek, but unless said modem has a NAT router in it, how could it work? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I don't know but it works, perhaps someone can shed light on this? </s>
<s> Google.com would be your next stop with simple questions to begin with. </s>
<s> Try: What is a router? </s>
<s> What is NAT? </s>
<s> Your DSL Modem does not have such a feature. </s>
<s> If you want to share the internet connection, you learn about ICS at various web sites like www.wown.com or just go get a router. </s>

<s> &quot;If you want to share the internet connection, you learn about ICS at various web sites like www.wown.com or just go get a router.&quot; I don't mean this to sound rude but you arn't listening to me, I AM SHARING AN INTERNET CONNECTION </s>
<s> Then I have to ask. </s>
<s> What issue are you trying to solve? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If you read the 1st post you wouldhave found out that when I stumbled across the Manual it repeatedly says not to use both the ethernet and USB Simultaneously, I wanted to know why? </s>
<s> From an electrical standpoint the modem maker can't warrant the device because they can't control proper grounding of both PCs. </s>
<s> If the electrical design isn't done to plug both in at the same time, then and if the PCs are not on the same ground then the modem will be damaged. </s>
<s> This is unlikely, but when I write manuals I have to error on the side of caution. </s>
<s> Is that what you needed to know? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Cheers bob! </s>
<s> That's just what I was getting at, I presumed some sort of electrical problem! </s>
