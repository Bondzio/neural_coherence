I'm running Mac OS X and so far everything is fine. So what if they are building a database? There is no requirement to provide an email address when you download anyway, so what's the problem? For a free application that will keep my wireless communication secure, it's working just great and I am pleased as punch to have found it. As for some people commenting about the ads that are displayed, switch to Firefox and install Adblock Plus. It strips out ALL adds from web pages and the only images visible are the Anchor Free logo and its accompanying Rewards Bar graphic. For a free application, Hotspot shield is great. I give it two secure, encrypted thumbs up.

If the wireless access is free, then most likely there is no password to access the network and no encryption whatsoever. What does this mean? Simple: Your communications (sending data in forms, emails, attachments) can be intercepted by any third party who has the capabilityyoure your personal data can be compromised. If you are just browsing the Drudge Report or checking baseball scores, the risk is inconsequential. In this case, who cares if someone intercepts what you are browsing? However, if you are reading personal email, say for instance from your Yahoo or Hotmail account, the connection is not protected by the HTTPS protocol. Sure, your login is protected by an HTTPS connection, but once you are inside the email application it switches back to HTTP. Suddenly you are unprotected. If someone sends you a password and other proprietary data, you run the risk of that info getting into the wrong hands. Usually, financial sites such as PayPal, banks, and credit card companies keep the entire browser login session in HTTPS, so you are ok there. Your inbound and outbound data is protected within a secure tunnel. However, many sites do not work this way. As a result, a lot of info you wouldnt want anyone to get a hold of can be intercepted. With identity theft on the rise, who wants to risk it these days? Thats where the HotSpot Shield comes in. When activated, it creates a Virtual Private Network for you that allows you to access web sites--wherein the pages and info sent/displayed are encrypted, while en route to and from your browser. So, anything and everything you view is private. Even if you send and receive info from sites that do not use HTTPS, your communications are secure. You are no longer out in the open, with your personal data flying to and fro across the ether, available for any enterprising hacker who wants to grab it.

I don't care if others see where I am going or where I've been. I use a limited account with a fictious name for this purpose. I also use a firewall that blocks incoming and outgoing. What you're selling is a WiFi Shield! Firewalls protect you from being hacked. How about people that are using this? http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1021256519470427962&q=wep+crack Rick

By the way, I am not trying to sell anything, I have no affiliation with this company whatsoever, just trying to put out some sort of viable response that makes sense. In my case, I need the shield for WiFi access and was happy to find a free option for Mac OS X. You mention a firewall but that is not the issue here, so I don't think we are on the same wavelength. Besides, the product is free anyway, so selling is would be a misnomer. If you don't like the program, don't use it, and do your own research.

The content of the ad is blanked out but the approximately one inch of white space the top of the webpages remains. I have the 'Collapse Blocked Element' option checked on. Any thought on how to close-up the white space?
