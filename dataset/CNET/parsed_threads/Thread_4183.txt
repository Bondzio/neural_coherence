<s> Both of these two RAM sticks seem to have the same specs so why are the sniper ones more expensive? </s>
<s> Is there any difference or is this just a marketing ploy? </s>

<s> The parts look to be selling on looks and name. </s>
<s> Marketing is keen to build on looks and names to fetch a price. </s>

<s> Well, same RAM but different sellers. </s>
<s> Providing if all specs remain the same, the sum total of price will be based on the degree of &quot;gee whiz&quot; factor. </s>
<s> That would include the testing, heat dissipation(alloys), and then the color and/or looks. </s>
<s> It's not what you all see that's apparent, because testing for &quot;every module&quot; you pay for rather than a sampling test. </s>
<s> The best attached cooling fins, is yet another step and/or whatever is provided. </s>
<s> Next, while color isn't always helpful, it maybe more a selling point to include any LED lightings. </s>
<s> Last, if ever needed, the warranty while present maybe more forgiving in order to appease those that make wrong choices or along those lines. </s>

<s> One vendor may cut out support and charge a restocking fee (lower prices.) </s>
<s> The other may have great staff and free return policies (higher prices.) </s>
<s> Since no two businesses are exactly alike, the price can change. </s>
