1.2.1	I 'd say the IBM T42 should be a decent machine if you want it more for business purposes .	St
1.2.2	You do n't get these at CompUSA and BestBuy , however .	St
1.2.3	They are more sturdily built than most I have seen .	St
1.2.4	I am using an older T30 series for work and it 's been faultless so far .	St
1.2.5	T42s come with about everything but firewire built in .	St
1.2.6	It 's the one drawback I can think of .	St
1.2.7	You 'll need a cardbus ( PCMCIA ) device for such if you need firewire but USB2 is on board as well as a wireless port .	St
1.2.8	You mentioned needing a network port and this is standard with most anyway .	St
1.2.9	The T42 has an RJ45 port like most .	St
1.2.10	Hope this helps and you get other recommendations .	St
