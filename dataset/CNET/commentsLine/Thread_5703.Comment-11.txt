sometimes you meet great people dealing online.
i'm a photographer and a graphics guy who uses a lot of ink.
ran into a start up guy named brandon who owns inkgrabber.
great attitude.
he saved me a fortune looking for local specials and my epsom photo printer functions really well on the non-original equipment ink they have.
if you try them out please say hi from bob from upstate new york.
