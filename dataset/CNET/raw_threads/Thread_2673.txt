I play Luxor a lot also star wars etc. Video starts to shake, then starts to jump ball in one place now three balls over, person on left now on right. System will either restart or end game play. If I stop the game will get blue screen and restart, system will not shut down completely using proper shutdown procedures after game play. Works fine with office 2003 and all associated programs. System fans increase and decrease in speed at any time, checked AC power in via UPS and its a solid 120VAC out. Need help on this one. THanks in advance

While 450W is pretty good enough, each leg of power can be lagging, so now is a good time to replace before it starts to stress componets. Plus, a top-notch AGP video card is very demanding and if you're wanting hi-end output the system starts to lag as well, perforamnce wise. Decent generic psus are in the 500W range and namebrand if 400W are stable. Heck, some users are putting in 600W in order not to worry about power. An ATX tester only checks for presence of power not necisarrily if clean&stable output, so its only good to say, good/bad power present if undeterminable. However, power should flucate with 5%(good) and 10% now and then and now always. A good AC line conditioner can help too as an extra measure. tada -----Willy

Have a APC 500 back-UPS and it is steady on the output side/input to puter. +12 and the rest seem to be okay except for a major downward spike then it spikes up a bit. Any brands you would suggest?

I have found huge rating on similar looking genercis of 400W+(and others) but are light as a feather sorta speak, they don't last long. I recommend on namebrands, Antec, Enermax, and Deer, plus Sparkle, though Enlight could work if not too demanding. Check the websites of Geeks and NewEgg for decent psus. tada -----Willy
