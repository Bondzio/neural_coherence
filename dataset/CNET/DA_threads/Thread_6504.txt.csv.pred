1.1.2	I had to install win 2000 for job purpose .	St
1.1.3	Now I can not find the driver for the Ethernet controller ( Marvell Yukon 88E8036 PCE-E fast Ethernet Controller ) anywhere .	St
1.1.4	Called Toshiba and they do n't support it for win2k .	St
1.1.5	Checked on Marvell website and they do n't seem to have it either .	St
1.1.6	Laptop also has 1394 Net Adapter which is also without driver .	St
1.1.7	Could anyone pleas direct me to the right path ... Thank you..	Ques
1.2.1	Install a PC-Card adapter .	St

1.3.1	there is no Win2k driver for your NIC if the manufacturer does not list one .	St
1.3.2	TWhen a new device is developed , they do not always write drivers for older OSs .	St
1.3.3	You should be able to find a PCMCIA ethernet adapter for which there is a Win2k driver -- if you have that slot available .	St

1.3.6	Hope this helps Frank	St
1.4.1	I have the same problem with a Toshiba M55-S329 .	St

1.4.3	It took me about 3 hours of searching the net for the driver before finding this formun entry .	St
1.4.4	Now if I can only get Ghost to work using the 3COM card in the PCMCIA slot ( different problem ) , I will be happy and can migrate back to W2K .	St
