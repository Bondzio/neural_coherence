<s> Hey guy, I need some some advices, pls. </s>
<s> Which should I chose? </s>
<s> Asus me301t or nexus 7 (3G) ? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Also, what tablet do you use today? </s>
<s> At the office we have those Nexus 7's and they seem very nice. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I originally purchased the Nexus 7 and loved every thing about it. </s>
<s> My wife loved it so much, well, she took it from me. </s>
<s> I then purchased the ME301 in place of another Nexus and prefer the ME301 for a few reasons. </s>
<s> The Number 1 reason was it's memory expansion capabilities, the second reason was the rear camera. </s>
<s> Crazy as it sounds, you don't expect to take pictures with a tablet, but it's a good feature to have when the need arises. </s>
<s> I will admit, I like the comfort of the Nexus 7 better, however the new ME301, is pretty comfortable for it's size. </s>
<s> Last comment, I use the device for personal and business. </s>
<s> The ME301 is a better choice when sharing information with friends and or customers. </s>
<s> Oh wait, one more note- both these purchases were my first (I mean second) Asus purchase - and I am really impressed with the power and capabilities they packed in a low cost device (s). </s>
<s> Hope this helps you make a decision. </s>
<s> If you're going that far, why not find a T 300? </s>
