my advice is to get it from dell, but my better advice is to go external.
the fastest speed i see today on internals is 2x.
this means that a full dvd recording session will be on the order of about 40 minutes.
if you get an external 8x drive, it could cost much less and bring that time down to under 20 minutes.
in fact, my external usb 2.0 and fireware case was 35 dollars.
the 8x i picked up was 99 bucks on sale and it's been great.
