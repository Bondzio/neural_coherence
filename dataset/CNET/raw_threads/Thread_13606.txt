When I attempt to type a capital &quot;O&quot; by holding the left shift key down, nothing happens including typing a &quot;blank&quot; character. The keyboard in question is a Logitech wireless unit. The left shift key works for all other keys except the capital O. However, holding the right shift key down does allow me to type a capital O. Anyone have an idea as to how to fix this short of getting another keyboard?

Don't ask me why, but I found the F7 key stuck &quot;down&quot; and for some reason, this stopped the capital O using teh left shift key. All other keys worked with the left shift key. GO FIGURE! PS FWIW, the F7 key on this keyboard has a printer icon on it.
