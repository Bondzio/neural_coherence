<s> I have a dell desktop 8100 with win 2000. </s>
<s> For last few months it has started to make rattling noise when i start the computer; the noise dies out in 5-6 minutes after being started. </s>
<s> I was told to clean the fan, which I had with reduction in the noise. </s>
<s> I was told it could be dying hard drive too. </s>
<s> But if it was a hard drive problem then why the noise is better after i cleaned the fan?? </s>
<s> My questions are: 1) Is there a good free software to check out my hard drive. </s>
<s> I do have A Norton System 2001. </s>
<s> 2) Should I replace the fans? </s>
<s> Which ones first? </s>
<s> Where can I buy in stores? </s>
<s> 3)If hard drive needs to changed, should I get form dell or can i use other brands?? </s>
<s> THnx a lot Supermoe </s>
<s> You can download drive diagnostic programs from there. </s>
<s> Put them on a floppy and thjey will check the drive. </s>
<s> If you improved the noise by cleaning the fan before, the fan may be [likely is] a crappy sleeve bearinf type and the bearing is worn and the fan wobbles. </s>
<s> replace it with a ball bearing/dual ball bearing type. </s>
<s> Fans, even after cleaning can have stop/go intermit operation, replace it to be 100% sure. </s>
<s> Also, thr power supply fan can be the same way, so verify its working plus *all* fans. </s>
<s> As for HDs, you can add any HD vendors model. </s>
<s> Dell, has a help guide to &quot;upgrade&quot; adding a 2nd HD, but use that as if installing a new replacement HD. </s>
<s> If the HD happens to be under warranty use that. </s>
<s> You can leave the side cover off to help pin-point the noise source. </s>
