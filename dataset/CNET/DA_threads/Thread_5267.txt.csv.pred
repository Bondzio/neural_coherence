1.1.1	I have an Asus P5LD2 , with a DualCore 3.4Ghz processor .	St
1.1.2	I bought 4x1GB PC-6400 800Mhz DDR2 ram , and a used Core2Duo E6600 2.4Ghz processor .	St
1.1.3	Unfortunately , turns out that my motherboard only supports this CPU , if it 's rev2.0 and up , mine was rev1.02 .	St
1.1.4	Plus , the BIOS reads the 4GB ram as PC-5300 400Mhz ( HWINFO32 does show the proper info though ) .	St
1.1.5	So ... not wanting to waste the new ram , and the processor was pretty cheap so , found a used ASUS P5Q board for sale .	St
1.1.6	Before I run into any other problems ... can anyone see any potential issues ?	Ques
1.1.7	Like will the Power Supply I have for the P5LD2 work on a P5Q ?	Ques
1.1.8	Should the ram read at full speed ?	Ques
1.1.9	Anything ?	Ques
1.1.10	Just wanting to avoid a headache before it happens .	St
1.1.11	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	I do n't know how much performance gain with the E6600 ( it maybe core2duo but it 's also at lower speed ) .	St
1.2.2	I probably would just save it for the next computer ( using ddr3 ... much cheaper than ddr2 ) .	St
1.2.3	Just my thinking on this .	St
1.3.1	Well , as per the OP ...	St
1.3.2	I have the CPU/Fan ( $ 25 ) and already bought the RAM ( $ 30 ) so more just looking for potential issues .	St
1.3.3	Next computer will be an 8-Core Mac Pro that I 'm saving up for , hence wanting a cheap upgrade vs buying a barebone Core i5 system .	St
1.3.4	I 'll dual boot it wil OSX and Win7 .	St
1.3.5	Right now , I 'm using my PC as both a computer and running XBMC as a media centre .	St
1.3.6	Once I have the MAC , this will get dumped into a nicer desktop case and used for XBMC only , so , do n't really need a $ 500 upgrade , was hoping $ 50 and done .	St
1.3.7	Just , did n't know about the motherboard needing to be rev2.0 and up , that was a kick in the pants .	St
1.3.8	If another $ 50 for an ASUS P5Q is all I need , I 'll be happy .	St
1.3.9	That being said , I ca n't find info about things like power supply connectors ... not sure if the P5LD2 and P5Q have the same plugs or not .	St
1.3.10	I benchmarked a DELL 745 which showed a good increase in performance over my PC which runs the E6600 ... and mine has a much better video card and ram .	St
1.3.11	My theory is that I 'll see a decent amount of speed increase ... - My video card is a PCI-e v2.0 card running in a v1.0 slot - My ram is PC6400 800mhz , reading at PC5300 400mhz - Switching DualCore 3.4 , to a Core2Duo 2.4 So , hoping that there will be some increase in performance for all 3 factors .	St
1.3.12	Enough to hold me over until the MAC comes anyway .	St
1.3.13	Which may be another 6 months or so ... since about $ 2500 used .	St
1.3.14	: S	St
1.4.1	We ca n't discuss OSX on non-Apple hardware .	St
1.4.2	Those discussions get an instant lock .	St
1.4.3	Love to work the other angles so start again but it 's verboten ( see forum policies . )	St
