1.1.1	I returned home today to find a burning smell coming out of my computer room.	St
1.1.2	When I went in there I noticed my GE Optical Mouse had melted itself into a mess and was proceeding to burn a hole in my mouse pad.	St
1.1.3	I ended up having to turn off the computer and wait till the mouse was cool enough to remove it.	St
1.1.4	But not my PC won't come back on.	St
1.1.5	Has anyone else had their mouse melt on them?	Ques
1.2.1	While unusual, such things do happen when power supplies fail.	St
1.2.2	I was witness to a total machine wipeout when the power supply failed.	St
1.2.3	Not much survived.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	You mean since it melted?	St
1.4.2	Yeah it's unplugged.	St
1.4.3	I can understand how a faulty power supply could fry my motherboard, but how would it cause the laser in my mouse to start burning things?	St
1.4.4	I know that laser devices use thermal cooling chips to regulate the temprature of the laser so that something like this would never happen.	St
1.4.5	But I've never heard of one going out.	St
1.4.6	My thoughts are GE just bought cheap parts.	Polite
1.5.1	- How about the 5V power supply rail went to 10V.	St
1.5.2	What would all the parts think about about that?	St
1.5.3	- You wouldn't believe how many machines I've removed the cover to find loose screws floating inside the case.	St
1.5.4	Let's ask what happens if this conductive material lands in the right spot.	St
1.5.5	What would happen?	St
1.5.6	- Many homemade PCs get built with an extra mounting post in the area of the back of the motherboard.	St
1.5.7	It's fatal about 50% of the time.	St
1.5.8	Your story is a bit rare, but not unbelievable.	St
1.5.9	Bob	St
1.6.1	Well when I left the computer it was off.	St
1.6.2	Also it is a factory build eMachine and I haven't been inside the case so I really shouldn't have loose screws.	St
1.6.3	And the power supply going from 5V to 10V would be bad but wouldn't the motherboard already have the components inplace to keep that from affecting the mouse?	St
1.6.4	I'm not saying it's impossible for the PS/2 port to receive more power than normal, but while the computer is off, and there's nothing shorting it out?	St
1.7.1	Such failures do occur and now it's your choice to open it up to see if you can sniff out what's dead or ???	St
1.7.2	What direction are you going here?	Ques
1.7.3	Bob	St
1.8.1	I'm just trying to see if anyone else has ever had such a problem.	St
1.8.2	And what might be similar to my situation.	St
1.8.3	I know there's a good number of things that could cause this to happen but a google search on this subject hasn't returned any other instances of this problem.	St
1.8.4	So what better than to ping the world for other people with the same problem.	St
1.9.1	Not that the mouse melted, but nice smoke as anything on the 5 Volt rail fried.	St
1.9.2	The causes for the dead machines I've seen are all over the map (I listed a few.)	St
1.9.3	Bob	St
