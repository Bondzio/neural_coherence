hi all, we have several walkabout hammerhead hh3 tablet pc's.
they are at the age now that they won't hold the cmos settings.
the company says that they are the only ones who can replace the battery/cmos chip, and of course rather expensive.
i have completely dismantled one and i can't find anything resembling a battery.
i thought they might be using a cap but the one i see that is in the package i would expect is being used to filter the backlight.
i have looked under battery, behind pcmcia slot, all around the screen and i am stumped.
any help would be appreciated.
