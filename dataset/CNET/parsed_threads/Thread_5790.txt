<s> I have followed all the instructions an installed a Celeron D and i had P4 1.8. </s>
<s> One runs at 400 mHz fsb the other at 533. </s>
<s> My motherboard is at 400 mHz. </s>
<s> I do not even get into bios, simply see that the PC is on, but it does not display anything. </s>
<s> Please help, you can even tease me a little for being a newby while you r at it. </s>
<s> :-) </s>
<s> You have to be sure it supports the new cpu. </s>
<s> If you find it does, it may lack needing a &quot;bios update&quot;. </s>
<s> Which in many cases should support newer cpus or accept new cpus that weren't available when the mtrbd. </s>
<s> first came out. </s>
<s> Visit the mtrbd. </s>
<s> or vendor support website and find the specs for your model mtrbd. </s>
<s> or system. </s>
<s> Follow whatever instructions if a bios update is required and &quot;to the letter&quot;! </s>
<s> Before doing any of the above, you should at least try a CMOS clearing of setting to return to default setting of the bios. </s>
<s> The CMOS clearing pins/pads are located on your mtrbd. </s>
<s> find them and monetarily short them during a power-UP. </s>
<s> Unshort(unjumper) the same CMOS pins and allow a reboot to finish the process. </s>
<s> Shutdown after such a power_UP &quot;properly&quot; if it does with new cpu appear to work after that, if not then inspect for new bios update. </s>
<s> If NO bios update is present or allows to accept your new cpu, verify the jumpers are properly set for the new cpu, provided it does support the new cpu. </s>
<s> On some mtrbds. </s>
<s> that is &quot;automatically&quot; but you didn't mention what the heck you have. </s>
<s> That's where I would start. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
