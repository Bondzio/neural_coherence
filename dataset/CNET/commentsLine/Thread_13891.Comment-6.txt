since this is an interesting case that may affect others, let me ask you a question: are the other drives that boot also partitioned so that only one partition has an os x?
if it was installed on the whole drive, that could be the issue.
if you do not partition the 1 tb but just clone the internal to it, maybe it would work as intended.
but you are right about the issue related to the drive itself.
