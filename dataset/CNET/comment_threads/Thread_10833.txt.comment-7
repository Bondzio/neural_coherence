Many thanks again, Bob, for the clarification about the switched hub.
I should be able to find an inexpensive one, and complete the network without problems, due to your help.
QUESTION: Is there any reason to use the D-Link DIR-655 Wireless router in place of the BEFSR41 for my wired network?
I have been told over and over that using a wireless router for a wired network is OK, but wireless is more expensive.
COMMENT: The D-Link DIR-655 cost me $129 while the BEFSR41 cost $$65.
A cheap switched hub can't cost more than $30 or $95 versus $129.
If the D-Link is better, I don't mind spending $34 more for better long-term use.
Thanks again for the reply, Thomboy
