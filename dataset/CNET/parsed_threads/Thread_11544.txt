<s> Does any one know how I can transfer the program files and data from my old 10g HD with XP home edition on it to a different PC with a 20g HD on it? </s>
<s> The 20g HD presently has windows 2000 pro on it which I assume I will need to reformat. </s>
<s> I have Norton ghost 9.0 if I was to plug the 10g HD to this computer would I be able to do a drive to drive transfer? </s>
<s> Is it possible that XP being a newer OS than 2000 would have the MB drivers needed for this computer to reconize the old XP HD. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> It's quite possible to copy the entire drive from the 10 gig to the 20 with Ghost or other such software. </s>
<s> As such, all data is intact. </s>
<s> However, XP will not startup on the new hardware. </s>
<s> You will need the original installation CD and will need to perform a &quot;repair&quot; installation. </s>
<s> You will also need the product ID code and will be required to reactivate Windows. </s>
<s> It's possible that XP will know much of your hardware but probably not all of it. </s>
<s> Gather all the drivers first. </s>
<s> This would also be a good time to visit the web sites of all your hardware manufacturers and get the latest drivers. </s>
<s> Definately get the latest BIOS for the MB while you're at it. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> You know, I've never use Norton Ghost, but for certain I could tell you how I resolved such problem. </s>
<s> When I bought new PC at first I wanted to keep my old HDD (as it has much needed data), but it was only 40Gb. </s>
<s> So I after long searches I found clone disk software . </s>
<s> It's the easiest and most convenient backup program. </s>
<s> I just create an exact image of my HDD and make a bootable CD (due to highest level compression it takes not much space). </s>
<s> And recover cloned HDD onto new PC automatically. </s>
<s> If you'll use the same way, you needn't reinstall Windows and you'll automatically create pretty full backup of whole your system! </s>
<s> Only after restoring you'll have to download upgrades for new PC configuration. </s>
<s> I'm not sure of how this would work. </s>
<s> Do I need to reformat the HDD then start it with a bootable CD Then put in the clone cd and do a repair install? </s>
<s> I'm confused? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help! </s>
<s> As I know, Acronis bootable CD doesn't demand to format the HDD, as it installs clone over your old system, and if you format your HDD, nothing terrible will happen. </s>
<s> Also it doesn't matter what is your new one HDD size, just it mustn't be smaller then your old one. </s>
