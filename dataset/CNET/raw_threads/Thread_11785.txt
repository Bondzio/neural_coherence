Or should I take it to get fixed? Or just buy a new one? Printer is 1 year 1 month old. Thank you for any help you can give me.

Start with printer off 2. Press and hold resume Button (triangle in the circle) and click &quot;Power&quot; button. Green led should be on 3. While holding the Power button, release the Resume Button. 4. Without releasing the Power Button, click &quot;Resume&quot; button for two times and release Both Buttons. 5. Click &quot;Resume&quot; for four times then soon click &quot;Power&quot; button, to confirm the selected action (reset counter absorber). 6. Turn off the printer and turn on again http://www.fixya.com/support/t5998845-error_code_6c10_mean Hope this helps.&quot; Remember this is a simple reset and will not change said cause of the issue. I'll let Canon explain what to be done next. Bob
