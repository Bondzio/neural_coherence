i was thinking that your gateway computer is from gateway computer company.
my mistake.
so your internet gateway computer is essentially your router.
so this is your setup?
internet ---- cable modem ---- comp1 ---- switch ---- comp2 (comp1 is setup as a gateway) you said this worked previously; was that with the switch included in the setup?
so comp1 is running windows internet connection sharing (ics) correct?
1. you really dont need the switch if the above setup is correct.
2. if your cable modem has multiple ports in the back to connect computers, then it probably is a router, too.
if that is the case, then both computers can connect directly to the cable modem-router.
what are the ip addresses on comp1 and comp2?
at each computer, click start &gt; run type cmd (dont type the quotation marks) to open a command prompt window type ipconfig /all (there is a space after ipconfig) can you ping one computer from the other?
example: if comp1 is 192.168.0.2 and comp2 is 192.168.0.3 then at the command prompt on comp1, type ping 192.168.0.3'' successful?
try ping-ing comp1s ip address from comp2.
successful?
