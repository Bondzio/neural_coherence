But here's the GPU list I like. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html That 7750 should best the current GPU but be sure to check benchmarks. If you change the motherboard you are in for a lot more cost. Power supply, OS, etc. My added thought. Unplug the modem if you don't use it. It's a few saved Watts and you need every one of them. Bob

If you are not using 1333 ram you might want to head over to &quot;crucial&quot; and pick up a 2x4GB kit. Remove all the sticks and fit in the kit. The gpu upgrade would be easiest ........just keep the psu in mind as you go up the list. Cpu upgrade?........can be easy or it might turn into a nightmare.

That could use some work. Ram.....I'll take a guess you have 6GB of low speed ram. If true.....that could use some work. Only you know what the budget is and what your comfortable with doing. Ram...50 bucks. Cpu....100 bucks. If you swap the cpu it might be best to get the latest bios before the swap.
