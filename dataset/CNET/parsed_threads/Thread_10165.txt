<s> Tried to install my Epson Perfection 1260 scanner that worked great on my previous XP machine. </s>
<s> Went to the Epson site and downloaded what they say is there Vista driver. </s>
<s> As per their site's instructions, I downloaded (at a cost of $15) the ungraded Smart Panel from New Age. </s>
<s> All this and guess what? </s>
<s> No dice. </s>
<s> The scanner is not recognized. </s>
<s> E-mail to Epson tech support brought the response that they &quot;are working on a driver for the Perfection and will have it some time in the future.&quot; Wow, does that ever suck? </s>
<s> Meantime, does anybody have any suggestions for how to make this puppy work on my Vista machine? </s>
<s> then definitely get a refund. </s>
<s> If you just upgraded assuming , then you're probably SOL. </s>
<s> Otherwise there's no real incentive for manufacturers to provide drivers for an OS that's radically different for a 5-year-old scanner. </s>
<s> Get a Vista-supported scanner. </s>
<s> that the drivers can be downloaded from here http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/SupportIndex.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@0999246985.1203900684@@@@&BV_EngineID=ccdladedghmhkdfcgemcfjgdfljdfon.0&cookies=no&oid=-10244&infoType=Overview Rick </s>
