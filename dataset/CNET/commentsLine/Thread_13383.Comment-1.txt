hello, hoping someone can help here because i definitely can't afford pro data retrieval.
have an ext.
hd i sadly dropped a while back.
ever since, it's been fading.
today when i turn it on it sounds like it's spinning louder and faster than it should.
the files appear for a few seconds and i can click through just a folder or two before it freezes and a message box says i 'need to format' or something very close about formatting.
have lots of files on it.
anything i can do?
i'll gladly provide any more info that might help, and any suggestions will be tremendously appreciated.
thanks so much!
