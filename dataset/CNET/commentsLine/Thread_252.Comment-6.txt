geforce ti4200 with 64mb and after 2 years of heavy use it still competes with newer cards.
i benchmarked (3dmarkse) against a new ati 9600 (256mb) and beat it handily.
furthermore this card can be overclocked, however it can get unstable by doing so, so i leave it at the default settings.
just make sure you have the agp slot like the previous poster said.
it has a fan so it will drain a bit more power than your old card, i am guessing.
