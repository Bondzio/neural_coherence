omg the ignorance... dude why do you think server farms are so powerfull ?
because there is power in numbers.
right now its not noticeable but when games are made to utilize all the cores at even 50 percent it will be such a leap from a single powerful core.
there wont b any load times because one core can be loading the next level, lighting and textures can all be split up.
Games are for the most part maxing out pc video cards and games for the ps3 are using maybe 10% of its true power.
using multiple cores is so much more efficient too.
the writers of games and programs at that matter just need to start writing stuff for multiple cores.
multiple cores are the future no doubt about it.
