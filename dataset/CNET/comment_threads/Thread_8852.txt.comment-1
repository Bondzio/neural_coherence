I have a Sony Vaio Model PCG250.
My network connection is fine.
My wireless connection status says I am connected at 53.0Mbps.
But it says I have an invalid IP address.
I am currently using a wireless router (Dlink) and a wireless PC adapter (asante).
I am connected but my internet explorer does not work.
I went to Command Prompt to look at my IP configuration, but it says 0.0.0.0 I tried to manually input an IP address but my computer does not seem to accept it.
I tried to release my ip and then renew (my friend showed me how) but I get an error message saying &quot;an error occurred while renewing interface wireless network connection 3: the system cannot find the file specified.
Please help!
