I use laptops with GMA 950 and 3000 solutions and it's graphics speed for 2D work (pictures, web, video) is good.
In fact I'd rate it &quot;excellent&quot; compared to our 5 year old laptops.
The card you selected seemed to be something that a gamer would list.
Gaming wasn't on your list so I thought I'd ask.
You could leave that off at first and see if the onboard is fine for your apparent non-game use.
