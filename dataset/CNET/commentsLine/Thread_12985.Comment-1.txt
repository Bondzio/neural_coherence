pretec has recently announced a 12gb cf card.
its price is terribly high however everybody knows that it will eventually drop, and rapidly!
if i'm not wrong we were using hard drives with 12gb capacity 5 years ago.
so the the flash memory is catching up.
at what data transfer speed, maximum storage capacity and price-per-mb level do you think pcs will start to use flash memory instead of hdd?
are there any other constraints for this dream to become real?
