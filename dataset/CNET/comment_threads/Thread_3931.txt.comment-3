The desktop (Sony W700G all-in-one model) has the wireless PC card (T-Mobile Internet service) and the laptop has the wireless LAN card built in.
I want to use the wireless service on the laptop without having to remove the card from the desktop.
What kind of router would I need to network the two computers?
Thanks.
