so bite the bullet and put up ap.
models.
weather proof for sure then connect with cat 5. actually might not be bad idea.
come from outside with a bridge (wireless to cat 5).
plug the cat 5 inside to a cheap netgear n i have acquired.
from there cat 5 to tv and bluray.
then maybe with some tweeking i can get the netgear to also broadcast in house wireless.
would mean i would have to make sure channels do not clash between two networks?
sounds like an afternoon's work.
suppose is ok as my packers melted in front of the ny giants i feel your pain on connectors.
rp-sma is what i have now.
on farm i've got multiple radio and each seems to require its own style connector.
