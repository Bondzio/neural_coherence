my experience with sony support on a dozen office laptops has me writing that sony needs some serious whacks around the head about after-sale support.
out of the 12, 6 died immediately and we spent untold hours shipping and on the phone about the units.
in the end, the sony story was these were not suitable units to be placed on a business desktop for use during the day.
in otherwords, you should only use them for an hour or two at a time.
nothing in any printed literature noted such a limitation but it may have been true since we could only manage to eek usage out of the units by having the users shutdown during lunch.
another issue with a sony is they pretty much treat it like a tv.
if you change the os or add a device, the support vanishes.
while this can be true with other vendors, sony seems to be more extreme with this.
as to the other makes, such are clones and one would have to rip off the lid and survey what's inside to tell.
why not a dell/hp?
