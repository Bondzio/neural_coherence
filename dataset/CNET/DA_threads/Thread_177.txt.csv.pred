1.1.1	Wanted to see if one could virtualize a small email server to a USB drive of sufficient capacity.	St
1.1.2	Looking for powered USB drive [if one exists] and perhaps someone who has actually done this.	St
1.1.3	Much thanks in advance for an informed opinion.	Polite
1.2.1	I missed it.	St
1.2.2	What did you want to do exactly?	St
1.2.3	Linux and mail servers running happily off those spiffy 20 buck 8GB USB drives on some old PC but maybe you want a PC on an USB STICK?	St

1.3.1	Much thanks for your timely reply.	Polite
1.3.2	With the advance of virtualization I just thought it might be possible to virtualize applications to a USB drive.	St
1.3.3	The two obvious barriers would be power and a physical connection to a router.	St
1.3.4	Just wondering if there is anything like this in existence or being ontemplated.	St
1.3.5	Ideally, I would would like to access some things without having a desktop on 24/7.	St
1.4.1	Let's just say that virtualization still requires a CPU and all the rest of the system.	St
1.4.2	Maybe you were asking for a full computer on some USB stick but I couldn't tell.	St
