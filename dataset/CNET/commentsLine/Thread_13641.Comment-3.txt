changes to the bios don't keep for these reasons either they're way off(oc'ing?)
or not saved upon exiting the bios area.
if the problem persists, then be sure the bios/cmos battery is ok, just put in a new one.
a p4 system is a dated system as your post offers no real info, i can suspect you're rebuilding from old parts or re-using some.
do that and check results.
for more detailed help, post your system specs.
