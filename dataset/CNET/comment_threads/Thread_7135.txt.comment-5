I hope you didn't do what I did.
I bought a new SATA II hard drive 300mb/per second transfer bla bla bla.
Installed it and then looked in device manager and realized I have a Ultra ATA Controller.
It's installed and works but because the controller is Ultra ATA I assume I am only going to get the old school speed of up to 100mb/per second.
Could have saved a few dollars maybe if I had done my research though.
FYI Western Digital Internal Hard Drive (WD2500KS) 300mb/s 16mb cache $89 at Circuit City
