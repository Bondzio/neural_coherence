i'm an architect and about to buy a new pc as a performance upgrade to suffice architecture related software, and i'm in the middle of these two devices the dell xps one 27 and lenovo ideacentre a720, the highest specs model in each the two brands.
one of the perplexing specs for me was the screen, i actually can't reach a presentable unit from both to view it myself, so i'm unaware of the difference of screens, whether the lenovo's is very good for me as an architect especially its touch ability which is good for upcoming operating systems and specific using in architecture drafting, or it's not enough and the high res.
one is the perfect especially in a 27&quot; screen.
i also care to have a device that have the specs that are up to date and even catch up with the afterwards, i don't like to have a computer and just after couple of weeks or months, i find that a feature has been completed developed and flipped over to be something else like the high res screen for example.
