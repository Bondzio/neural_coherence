I am currently expanding my home network to support a digital Movie library (both SD and HD) and am looking for some recommentations on network storage that I can incremental expand as my storage requriements increase.
My needs are for media streaming over my 1000Mbps network and centralized backup.
I have looked as some of the Windows Home Server soultions, but would prefer an network device, so I don't have the hassle of another windows operating system to manage.
I have looked at the LinkSys Media Hub (NMH410 $ 430 on Amazon) , but would like something that has more upward expansion (it currently supports two SATA 1 TB disks).
Does anyone have any other suggestions?
