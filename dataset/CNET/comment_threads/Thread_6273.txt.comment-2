Windows 2000 will install some drivers on initial install but Windows Update will not install drivers... unless you configured it to do so.
My initial question would be &quot;What color depth are you using?
They should look good if you are using 16-bit or 32-bit color.
It sounds like you are using 8.&quot; but... You may need to fish around for the &quot;Show Icons using all possible colors&quot; setting.
I'm not on the 2000 box so I leave this for you to find.
Maybe TWEAKUI could help with that or it's ICON REBUILD tool.
As to drivers, I may have missed what video card you have, but as always, try the latest.
As to Windows Update, I suggest you set it to not do drivers.
