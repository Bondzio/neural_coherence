<s> I heard that if one is using core duo or core 2 duo series processors (or not using the new Core i 3/5 etc processors) an external HDD of 1 TB or above might not work properly? </s>
<s> I mean they say it would be slow or it might not be compatible etc etc. </s>
<s> So, in short, I am using Windows 7 ultimate, 2 gb or RAM, 2 + 2 gigs of core 2 duo processor on hp dv 6500 special edition and I am planning to buy WD My Passport Essential SE (1 TB), so would have I any issues or would it be ok? </s>
<s> Or may be I should just buy the My Passport Essential(500 GB)? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> And who are they? </s>
<s> Some self-proclaimed computer geeks!! </s>
<s> Seriously, they made it difficult for me make this simple choice. </s>
<s> I'll keep this contained to my personal experiences. </s>
<s> I have more than one 1.5TB USB drive as I maintain backups and beyond those I have other backups on DVD, USB memory sticks and more. </s>
<s> The machines the 1.5TB USB drives are used on are a collection of machines at the office with Vista, 7 with AMD dual core, Core Duo, Core 2 Duo and i5 CPUs. </s>
<s> It all works so I'd wonder why anyone would write it doesn't. </s>

<s> The myth started a few years ago. </s>
<s> Manufacturer/Vendors sold external cases that specifically stated 500GB. </s>
<s> Some were 1 Terrabyte. </s>
<s> The end user did not either read the specification, or failed to verify at the manufacturer's site the information. </s>
<s> To this day, there are Vendor's that market external cases with only 1 Terrabyte specs. </s>
<s> Today, the most well-known online vendors do an adequate job with specifications. </s>
<s> Links to the manufacturer's site, and buyer reviews can sometimes answer lingering questions. </s>
<s> Start at http://www.dewassoc.com/kbase/hard_drives/drive_size_barrier_limitations.htm then at the bottom read the next link to find where these barriers began and were overcome. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Vendors have been rating their external cases in GB's. </s>
<s> Some cases only handle 500GB, some 1000GB, some two 1000GB as twins. </s>
<s> The problem rests with the interface within the external case. </s>
<s> Your link was about motherboard BIOS. </s>
<s> Apply if we boot from the USB drive as well as apply to the OS. </s>
<s> If it is unacceptable to note such details just say so and if this is your discussion I'll remove the offending content. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well that seems a little odd since I use a 1.5 TB drive against a Core 2 system, no issues. </s>
<s> I wonder where THEY got their information. </s>
<s> Ok, keeping aside the tech savvy talk, can someone please reconfirm me that there wouldnt be any problem with a 1- 1.5 TB external HD with intel core 2 dou (hp, win 7). </s>
<s> Yes, the 1T or 1.5T will work. </s>
