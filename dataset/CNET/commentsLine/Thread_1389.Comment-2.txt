it depends if your still satisfied with the performance and utility the computer is giving you.
buying a 160gb drive might be a problem if your motherboard won't support it.
if i were satisfied with this computer i would get a couple of 80gb hard drives.
use one for your operating system and applications and use the other for your larger media files.
i assume you have usb support, but is it usb 1.1 or usb 2.0. usb 1.1 is about one tenth the speed and you might not be satisfied with the data transfer speed when loading photo files.
again, the motherboard has to support the higher speed.
an external drive does have the advantage of doubling as a &quot;backup&quot; drive should the system drive fail.
it's up to you.
sooner or later you are going to want to upgrade but it doesn't necessarily have to be now, especially if you are satisfied with what it does.
hope this helps a bit.
let us know.
and life goes on... jack
