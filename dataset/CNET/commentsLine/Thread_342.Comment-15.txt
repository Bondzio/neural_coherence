cloud computing is basically using someone else's services for allowance for storage short-coming and/or apps.. this is the popular term now, because most netbooks don't have sufficent or rather large off book storage other than usb based.
understand, the 1st netbooks didn't have any int.
storage at all or were very limited.
so anyone running older netbooks looked elsewhere.
at the same time costs were a factor as well.
this may not be as costly and the alternatives available now but it does still exist.
cloud computing has expanded as well, so i leave it at that.
yes, back-ups are important as the user deems them.
unfortunately that's a lesson learned too late.
