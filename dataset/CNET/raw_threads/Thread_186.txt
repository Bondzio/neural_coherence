Not a single one is perfect and add to that the number of machines with issues (spyware, drivers, etc.) and you have a recipe for bad feedback on any printer. Bob

The device itself is pretty solid... you just can't use it because of the software issues: http://forums1.itrc.hp.com/service/forums/questionanswer.do?threadId=996108 If anyone here has feedback on how to solve these crippling problems, please let me know.
