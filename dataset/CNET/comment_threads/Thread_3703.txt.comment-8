The cost of the ethernet cable is about the price of a cheap wifi router.
In fact, I was on travel and in a pinch needed a temporary router.
I went to Fry's and for under 20 bucks was done.
A 150 foot Ethernet cable could cost as much.
-&gt; But are you saying you have wifi out at 150 feet?
I missed that detail and it can explain almost all of the troubles.
You may have to deploy another system to move the WAP closer to your PCs.
