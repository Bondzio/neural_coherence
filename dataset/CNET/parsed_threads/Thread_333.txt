<s> Hi everyone.. Is there a software where I can put two IP adresses and monitor a real time throughput between 2 devices.. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance Meshari.. </s>
<s> Real time monitoring requires hardware in one form or another. </s>
<s> You need some device to analyze the data. </s>
<s> Commercial routers have some ability to provide data but normally you need a add on tool. </s>
<s> Most these are in a class of tools meant to monitor networks and cost more than most cars. </s>
<s> If you are looking for a commercial solution Netscout has a lot of nice boxes that do this but priced toward large companies. </s>
<s> To do this on the cheap your best bet is to use a free tool called wireshark. </s>
<s> If you can load this on one of the end machines you can get some basic reports. </s>
<s> If you do not have access the end machines then you will have to have hardware. </s>
<s> The minimum you will need is a PC to again run wireshark and a way to tap the circuit. </s>
<s> The method to tap the circuit could be as simple as a switch that has the ability to replicate &quot;mirror&quot; data second port up to commercial taps that you clamp onto fiber. </s>
<s> Now if you control both end devices and want to simulate thought put and test network capacity a very simple free command line tool that has been around for years called IPERF works very well. </s>
<s> This is a active testing tool and not a monitoring tool. </s>
<s> Thank you bill for the fast rsponse.. </s>
<s> I used &quot;iperf&quot; and as u said it works very well, but the problem with this tool is that it doesn't give u a real time calcualtion. </s>
<s> I want u to know that I have full control for both ends. </s>
<s> Knowing this, will wireshark be able to provide me with a real time throughput calculation? </s>
<s> Thank u again 4 your help.. </s>
<s> To a point it will. </s>
<s> It has a number of reports that will work against the open collection buffer. </s>
<s> Simple I/O rate graph seem ok. You can build filters for each address pair and graph I think up to 5 at the same time. </s>
<s> If you work at you could graph different protocols as well as IP addresses. </s>
<s> The issue with using wireshark as a live protocol analyzer is that it really a packet capture tool designed to look at data after it is captured. </s>
<s> The only live data it can look at is in the capture buffer. </s>
<s> Although the size of this buffer can be made large when you capture on path that has a lot of traffic the buffer will wrap over itself and if you make the buffer too large you will bog the machine down. </s>
<s> The method I use is to let it capture for a few minutes to a file and then stop and look at the file. </s>
<s> Although not real time the more advanced reports are more accurate. </s>
<s> The reports that show jitter in VoIP calls only seem to work on non live data. </s>
<s> On paths that are running huge amounts of data I use 2 machines. </s>
<s> One to capture the data since it can do little else and another to look at the data. </s>
<s> You can set wireshark to write the data to files at a set interval of set byte count. </s>
<s> I share the drive it writes to and open the files using another copy of wireshark. </s>
<s> Not truly live data but only a couple minutes old. </s>
<s> http://www.hootech.com/NetMeter/ is one idea. </s>
<s> I will try these two softwares and I'll give you my feedback.. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot to both of you.. </s>
