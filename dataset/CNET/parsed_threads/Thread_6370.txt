<s> I looked into the iPad. </s>
<s> I like their applications, but I also wanted to be able to download my library books to the iPad. </s>
<s> When I checked with the Public Library, they stated that the iPad is an incompatible device because: &quot;DRM-protected Adobe EPUB & PDF eBooks are incompatible with these devices&quot; Does anyone know if or how this issue is being dealt with? </s>
<s> That's Apple's policy. </s>
<s> No change expected. </s>

<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
<s> Catch me up here: So the ipad epub app can't read libaray epub format books becasue the expiry process uses DRM? </s>
<s> Bummer, the universality of all the apps was one of the deciding factors pushing me towards the ipad.. </s>
