I have a switch and through it the comp. connect to ADSL. It works fine, but as soon as I add my laptop to the LAN (connect it to the switch), the LAN looses internet connectivity. As soon as I disconnect the laptop, the internet is back, why? The switch has 5 ports + uplink to the ADSL modem. Regards, Mirza

If they provide you only one ipaddress, then you better have a router after your modem. Your switch is not going to help you. If you have one ipaddress from your ISP, does your modem have router function? You don't really need a switch unless you don't have enough ports on the router for all your computers which possibly is your case. More info please.

If you want a wired router, find one that will have enough ports to accommodate all your computers. If you want a wireless router, you should be able to find one with at least 3 or 4 ports to accommodate your wired computers. You can also connect your switch to the router make room for more computers.

You need the router to give you more than one local ipaddress on your multiple computers. The router serves as a NAT/DHCP and knows which of your many computer made the request for a certain internet page.
