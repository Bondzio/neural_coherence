<s> I have a very sick computer, and recently bought a PCI/ISA POST (Power On Self Status) code diagnostic card. </s>
<s> Symptoms: computer runs extremely slowly; windows and applications continually stop responding, sometimes temporarily, often permanently. </s>
<s> Internet browser (IE 6.0) is a waste of time; web pages can take hours to open, if at all, despite my disabling the &quot;Show pictures&quot; option, disabling Windows XP firewall and uninstalling antivirus software (and all innessential software). </s>
<s> The only operation my PC seems to be able to handle reasonably well is typing in NotePad (typing in MS Word 2002 entails waiting several minutes after every keystroke). </s>
<s> Did a clean reinstallation of Windows XP Professional but that made no difference. </s>
<s> After running well for about two years, my computer is now practically useless, (was hoping to get another year's use out of it). </s>
<s> The diagnostic card is installed in a PCI or ISA slot; following is an explanation from the manual of what it does: &quot;When the machine is turned on, the hexadecimal display should show the various POST codes as the system executes (unless it has a rare BIOS that does not display POST codes). </s>
<s> If the machine does not boot, system POST has detected a fatal fault and stopped. </s>
<s> The number showing in the hexadecimal display on the Diagnostic Card is the number of the test in which POST failed.&quot; When I boot up the card display quickly runs through a few numbers and stops on 26. </s>
<s> This is puzzling to me because my computer does boot up, albeit very slowly, contrary to the above description, which suggests that the card display should only stop at a number if the machine does not boot. </s>
<s> An appendix in the manual lists all POST codes for the main BIOS vendors, and includes the following information: &quot;Error Code 26 Award (26)Enable slots 6;Initialize slot 6.Test protected mode exceptions.&quot; I would very much appreciate some help to understand what this means, and possibly a suggestion for further action I could take to diagnose the problem. </s>
<s> I contacted the card vendor about this but they are Chinese and don't understand English. </s>
<s> Motherboard: FIC AD11 CPU: AMD Athlon 1.2GB BIOS: Award ABA46 Internet connection: 56kb/s modem </s>
<s> Since your system actually does boot-up you've gone past what use a POST card can be, depending on the maker. </s>
<s> For all intents and purposes, most POST cards are for &quot;dead systems&quot; thus they can help pinpiont the cause of failure. </s>
<s> On top of that, any repair may exceed the value of the mtrbd. </s>
<s> if cause or end device, like HD, etc. </s>
<s> Its value is for mutliple similar systems, were repairs cards can easily be swapped into for quick uptime. </s>
<s> POST cards are just another tool for the toolkit. </s>
<s> Your sysptoms appears to be the action of malware, like a trojan or virus, etc. </s>
<s> If you have an AV pgm, use it with latest update. </s>
<s> Even if it comes back with good results, you gotta try it to eliminate that. </s>
<s> I suspect further if you have a clean report, the cpu fan or other fan could be failing, if cpu, they tend to slowdown when up against &quot;heat problems&quot; or reboot frequently. </s>
<s> AMD cpus are power hungary so a stable power supply is a most, especially it seems your 1.2, Throuhbred class. </s>
<s> Open case with cover off observe operation of all fans and check for noise levels as well. </s>
<s> If too noisy, suggests a bad fan. </s>
<s> These are my guesses for now... good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> but a far out one would be if somehow the Cache got disabled in the BIOS. </s>
<s> Speaking of slowing down a system. </s>
<s> WOW </s>
<s> Several times I tried scanning with Norton AntiVirus 2002, but each time it went for a few days and eventually spontaneously terminated, so it never finished scanning my entire system. </s>
<s> However, the best it did was 101,000 files (that took about 5 days) before disappearing, and it had found no infection up to that point. </s>
<s> I have 3 HDDs and 5 partitions and it was on the final partition and had about 30,000 files to go when it gave up. </s>
<s> All the remaining files were mp3s, so I doubt any of those contain viruses or trojans. </s>
<s> I did the obvious things like checking fans, which are not unusually noisy, and the system doesn't spontaneously restart. </s>
<s> It just seems to be extremely low on resources, and Windows itself and any other processes continually stop responding. </s>
<s> I know that repairs are generally more expensive than the mobo itself, but I hoped that I might diagnose it myself and do the repairs. </s>
<s> I know that to replace it I will also need to replace the CPU and RAM (it has 768MB of DDR RAM) because newer components would be incompatible with the older ones. </s>
<s> WOW? </s>
<s> Thanks for the cache suggestion; I'll check the BIOS when I get home (I'm at an Internet cafe now because, as I said, my PC is practically useless). </s>
<s> There are Ad-Aware and Spybot spyware scanners, so use them as well. </s>
<s> Norton AV-2002 needs to updated to latest release. </s>
<s> No AV pgm. </s>
<s> will completely do the job as trojan are many times missed or the latest threat is not yet imposed for the AV pgm. </s>
<s> On top of all this you should look into reducing, shutting down any startup pgms., and/or terminate backgrd running tasks leaving only required ones. </s>
<s> If no virus is found, consider again that too many tasks are running or a corrupt one is at fault, even the Norton AV will impose a drain on resources as that maybe also a cause, low resources in general. </s>
<s> You can select what HDs to scan also, so recheck that to directly scan a single HD/partition whether than the whole HD at once just to get past hang-ups. </s>
<s> PLus, in no way is it normal for scan to take days. </s>
<s> Below are several pgm. </s>
