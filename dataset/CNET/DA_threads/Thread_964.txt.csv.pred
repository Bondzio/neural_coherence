1.1.1	I built a new system with an intel core 2 duo cpu.	St
1.1.2	The opening screen on bootup shows the processor and says 2 cores.	St
1.1.3	Xp home only shows a single screen for cpu under task manager, performance.	St
1.1.4	Using the cpuz program shows only one core.	St
1.1.5	I installed the hotfix 896256, edited the registry, and added /usepmtimer to boot.ini.	St
1.1.6	I also uninstalled the processor from device manager and rebooted.	St
1.1.7	I see from reading the web that xp home should support dual core.	St
1.2.1	service packs 1 and 2?	St
1.3.1	yes, both service packs.	St
1.4.1	If I go to the BIOS and disable ACPI and something else I get a single core.	St
1.4.2	The BIOS still reports dual but Windows doesn't.	St
1.4.3	Hint?	St
1.4.4	Take the BIOS defaults.	St
1.4.5	Also another owner had replaced the motherboard but needed to change the HAL.	St
1.4.6	Here's an example how that's done.	St
1.4.7	-&gt; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309283 Which HAL are you loading?	St
1.4.8	Bob	St
1.5.1	I don't know.	St
1.5.2	How do I find this out?	Ques
1.5.3	And how do I know which is the right one to put in?	St
1.6.1	It says advanced configuration and power interface pc.	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
1.8.1	I did a repair install using the F5 technique to change the hal.	St
1.8.2	I changed it from advanced configuration and power interface to acpi multiprocessor pc but xp home still shows a single core.	St
1.9.1	There are at least 2 multiprocessor HALs so try the other.	St
1.9.2	Also if this fails it could be a BIOS or motherboard fault.	St
1.9.3	Time to ask them about that.	St
1.9.4	I'm taking it that you have never tinkered with the Task Manager or other settings or had a virus/trojan damage the OS.	St
1.9.5	Bob	St
