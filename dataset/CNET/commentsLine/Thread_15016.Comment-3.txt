there's only 4 active users browsing the web etc.
the 16 machines/devices connected are 5 pcs, 6 voip phones, 2 servers (they are v. low use...not serving to the public), 1 printer, 1 mobile, and one occasional wireless user.
we have a 20mb &quot;bt business&quot; connection.
we don't regularly stream lots of content as this is our work connection so we are mainly browsing web pages and uploading/downloading files but most of the files are tiny (&lt;300k) and the ul/dl don't happen all day every day just occasionally.
does that still seem like it's overuse to you?
i'm not sure what i should expect from this connection.
