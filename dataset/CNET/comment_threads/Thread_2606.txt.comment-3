In the past I would have defended Epson printers as being dependable and wonderful machines.
I cannot do that any more.
I have been royally disappointed with the entire line since my first C80.
That printer served me well for years.
HOWEVER the subsequent printers, C82, C84 and C88, and the CX1600 all using the lovely but problematic durabrite ink clogged.
Epson refuses to acknowledge they have a problem and just continue to sell a product that is bound to fail usually shortly after the warranty is over.
I can't say I am thrilled with the HP printer I have either.
My second hand canon I use at my work place seems to be doing better than either the Epson or the HP.
I'd look at Canon again.
