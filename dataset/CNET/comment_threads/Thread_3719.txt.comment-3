Oops--I wasn't as clear as I thought in my first message.
I'm looking for recommendations on specific models others have found valuable--19&quot;-21&quot; LCDs that are especially good with displaying text.
Are there others here who work primarily with text, not graphics, and who can recommend screens they like for that?
I thought I saw an article on CNET a week or two ago along these lines, but I cannot find it now.
Thanks, Brian
