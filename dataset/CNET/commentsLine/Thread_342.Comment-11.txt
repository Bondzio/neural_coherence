i am very concerned now about my data & phone calls could all be scanned as they travel through the ether & space via satellite.
cloud computing & storage is a fine way for our private data to be read enroute to storage & the fact of it being stored in multiple places gives data mining companies even greater scope to read our private stuff.
that would apply exponecially if the storage company provided the service free.
they have to make money on it somehow!
one of my phone numbers is a 'private number' phone number which i only give to certain people but out of the blue recently i started getting phone sellers ringing me on it.
so vicious was the campaign to get me to answer the call, my phone would ring 17 times in a row!
i knew who was calling because i use caller id on that number.
i finally put the phone on silent so as not to hear the damned thing!
x:( my suspicion is that the cloud storage company that handles one of my internet & email isps (a subscription service) mined the number out of an email i sent to someone.
this to me is the last straw!
i have previously been suspicious of data being mined out of emails.
that is seperate to the email address harvesters that troll the free email sites checking for emails filled with several generations of email addresses on uncleaned joke mail.
they sell all those addresses to mailing list buyers for spam production.
if recipient's addresses can be mined that easily when not bcc'd, how easy is it for all sorts of data to be mined out of back-ups being sent to the clouds?????
