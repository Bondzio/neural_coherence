<s> Hello All Just wondering whether anyone could recommend a decent 2.1 speaker system or even a REAL good 2.0 system for my computer - not an expert in this field so any advice would be well appreciated! </s>
<s> Some other info: * I use my pc (MS Vista O/S) for watching films as well as listening to music - no games! </s>
<s> * It will be in a small-medium sized room so don't want too many wires, and don't want a huge system as have enough clutter as it is! </s>
<s> * Budget - less than 100. </s>
<s> * I did like the Harman Kardon Soundsticks, and was originally going to go with them (from the great reviews I have read, as well as a great design) but decided against it as I read it does not have a switch to turn it off (waste of electricity - lol) and dont want it to glow whilst I am trying to sleep - need darkness!!! </s>
<s> * A speaker system which is great value and will hopefully last a few years!!! </s>
<s> And advice/recs/help of any sort will be very well appreciated! </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> T. </s>
<s> Logitech or Altec, either one. </s>
<s> Several variations and would work well. </s>
<s> Hi Phil and thanks for your response! </s>
<s> Am now looking into the Logitech range - something half decent and maybe even half the price of the soundsticks. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any reccs? </s>
<s> What are people experiences of the Z-4s? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> Logitech Z4 VERY GOOD! </s>
<s> They should be within your range and those are one of the specific models that I had in mind. </s>
