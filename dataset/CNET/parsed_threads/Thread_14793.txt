<s> After i installed the proper driver from the original CD, colors changed, contrast is bad (i cannot see anymore the rectangles from the test image: http://www.lcdreviewz.com/Brightness-and-Contrast-Adjustment ) and _my eyes hurt_. </s>
<s> Even if i change contrast value from the monitor panel to 0%, i'm still unable to see the rectangles in the image from the link above. </s>
<s> I tried uninstalling the driver (rolled back to microsoft default monitor) - the problem is persisting! </s>
<s> I deleted the color profile &quot;LG...&quot; from color management, the problem is still there! </s>
<s> how do i get the initial settings back? </s>
<s> Same problem on both windows xp and 7. </s>
<s> sorry, i found out that the problem was the monitor itself, i guess i've adjusted contrast from nvidia panel before, and updating the video driver just reset those contrast settings. </s>
<s> i think i'm gonna replace this monitor soon. </s>
