<s> I have a desktop hardwired directly to my wireless router. </s>
<s> I was thinking of setting up a wireless print server and hooking up a printer. </s>
<s> My desktop doesn't have wireless, Is it possible to use my wireless router to connect to a wireless print server? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> But as you can imagine support, that is the makers that sell you such devices are not all that helpful. </s>
<s> Let me share that if you try and fail it's not because it won't work but usually because of firewalls or other issues. </s>
<s> Follow the directions, learn your firewalls and be ready to pack and return in the number of days the vendor gives you. </s>
<s> Don't waste months trying to get it to work. </s>
<s> Do not accept it if you can't make it work in one day. </s>
