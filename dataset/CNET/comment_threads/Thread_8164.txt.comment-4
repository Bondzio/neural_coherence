There isn't anything useful that I can find in the manual.
The only say &quot;PC card slot&quot; that can use CompactFlash or SmartMedia using a &quot;Commerically available adaptor.&quot; pg 178 is the only section that has information I can see about it.
You're all welcome to take a look.

I'd like to use the dominate format, but at this point I just want to get the stupid adaptor.
