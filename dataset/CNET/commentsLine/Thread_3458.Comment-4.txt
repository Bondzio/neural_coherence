there is no 8 x 10 photopaper that i have seen for a inkjet, most people just use 8.5 x 11 borderless, {it's a little bit bigger isn't that good ?
}or print a 8 x 10 on 8.5 x 11 and cut the white borders off {or just leave them on if you have a full page photo album } with 8.5 x 11 being so close to 8 x 10 it's probably not worth it to the printer makers to make a special 8 x 10 paper.
even my old photo albums were 8.5 x 11 so they fit perfectly.
