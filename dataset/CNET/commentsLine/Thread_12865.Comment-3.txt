the real question is, where is the problem.
i constantly hear people referring to their computer as their &quot;hard drive&quot; when the hard drive is just one small thing inside a computer.
is the problem actually coming from the hard drive, did you open up the case and see if the noise still happens if you unplug the power from the hard drive.
usually you hear a noise from a fan in a system, not the drive, when a hard drive starts making a lot of noise it is almost always already toast, due to a head crash, and damage to the platters.
when is the last time you backed up your system's data?
