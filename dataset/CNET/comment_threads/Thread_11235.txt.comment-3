I once succeeded in connecting an old (original) Xbox to a portable DVD player.
Sound and graphics were sub-par I think, but it worked.
Of course, a DVD Player vs. a MBP screen is a large difference.
If you had a converter cable to combine the audio channel cables (red and yellow cables I believe, assuming the Wii uses those standard connection cables), you could physically connect the Wii to the Mac, but you wouldn't get anything from the Wii on the screen, supposing the Wii works as any other console...
Anyway, I agree, with a TV, it would be better.
