ok thanks, ill try a new cmos battery but i doubt its that as this problem has been persistant with 2 boards and when i try boot it dosnt even get as far as the post screen, which totally cuts out the cmos, i could possibly try flashing the bios when i get my net up and running again.
unfortunately i dont have a case speaker which makes matters worse.
im tempted to say that the booting problem lies with my psu.
as for my dvd drive, buying a new one would be the easier alternative but id rather find out what is causing this problem.
could someone explain where the controller is located.
is it on the board or the dvd drive itself?
and what is its specific funtion?
cheers spoon
