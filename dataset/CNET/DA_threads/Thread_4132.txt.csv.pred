1.4.1	as it seems he just wants a suggestion but i 'm not going to suggest a barebone kit from TigerDirect i 'm just going to suggest parts from Newegg i 'm going to design two systems side by side one will possibly cost more than the other ... one is going to be an Athlon64 based system , one is going to be a Pentium 4 Sequence 6 system As they will share some simmilar hardware , i 'm going to suggest that in one large block last ... ok the Athlon64 Motherboard : the Abit AN8 http : //www2.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16813127197 $ 140 AMD Athlon64 CPU : AMD Athlon64 3500+ http : //www2.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16819103514 $ 267 now for Video : PCIE Graphics card Abit ATi Radeon X700Pro for PCIE http : //www2.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16814123146 after that the casing , PSU , everything is up to you ( above is just a guideline ) as to a PSU i 'd personally suggest an Antec NeoPower 480W as for the Intel system i 'd use this CPU : http : //www2.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16819116197 and this motherboard : http : //www2.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16813127180 the AA8 will need DDR2 , while the AN8 will need normal DDR i would suggest PC 3200 for the AMD , and PC2 3200 or PC2 4200 for the Intel 2x512 dual channel for both ( 2x512MB sticks , it would provide dual channel if installed correctly )	St
