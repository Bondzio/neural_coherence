<s> During reformatting of a desktop PC (Pentium D 3GHz, P5GC-MX ASUS motherboard, 80GB HDD), i noticed that the fixed 8MB unpartitioned space is showing only 2MB. </s>
<s> The PC is working OK but the speed is a little bit slow. </s>
<s> Moreover, it is showing errors during installation of some softwares like Adobe Reader, Nero, etc. </s>
<s> What is the actual problem? </s>
<s> P.Massar </s>
<s> But what I find is most folk don't have a Windows install plan. </s>
<s> There is some dozen drivers and apps for most machines and I didn't read where you found and installed all that. </s>
<s> Let's lead off with &quot;Microsoft doesn't do this.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> In the past, there is no problem with the computer after reformatting and the same drivers &amp; softwares have been using. </s>
<s> During reformatting there is screen which shows all the drives and 8MB unpartitioned space, which ask the user where to install the OS. </s>
<s> Since it is showing only 2MB, i feel that there is something wrong some where which make the PC to show errors. </s>
<s> Is this the main problem? </s>
<s> Whether we should always get 8MB? </s>
<s> if this zoem type OS, it may partition more than one partition, but a small 8mb isn't really useful. </s>
<s> If this is a retail version of the OS, then it normally wouldn't even do that size partiton this maybe an error during the initial formatting. </s>
<s> Overall, I can't fathom whay 8mb is created. </s>
<s> However, if you deem this is really 8Gb size then that's typical of OEM install wanting to make a restore partition. </s>
<s> However, I have no clue what your PC truly other tahn some specs whick lack the badge on the box. </s>
<s> However, if you like, you can totally wipe out the HD, flush it entirely(all parttions). </s>
<s> That way its truly available formatting and upon that process do a 100% partition build on 1 drive(partiton). </s>
<s> Otherwise, i suspect you're really doing a formatting not touching the 8mb partition at all. </s>
<s> As for speed, there maybe a lag, but for how I address the old partition. </s>
<s> issue. </s>
<s> You can also, check the proesses running and see what its doing and what hogging it down. </s>
<s> Clecik on Ctl+Atl+Del, once and go from there. </s>
<s> Alas, checking the startup pgms. </s>
<s> etc. </s>
<s> and/or boot-up from MSCONFIG at start to se what's also beinning at boot-up. </s>
