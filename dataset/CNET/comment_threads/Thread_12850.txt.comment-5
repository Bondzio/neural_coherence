Your system working?
If not, inspect.
If it is, then don't worry about it.
I shouldn't have to explain any pin(s) on an electrical device will have &quot;electricity/signals&quot; going through, so what is the fix worth to you or the &quot;time&effort&quot; to rest assured.
A bent pin can be in contact with other pins and/or short or become an intermittent area of problems.
Its not a matter of looking right but of being able to work or prove that's not an issue.
