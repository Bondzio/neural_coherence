I was told it has wireless internet, but am not able to get it to work. It has Intel Centrino technology. A Pentium M Processor. It does have a WiFi symbol which i am guessing lights up when WiFi is used, near where the caps lock icon is. However, when I go into device manager, it only shows 1394 Net Adapter, under Network adapters. Any idea what I am doing wrong? If this system does not have wireless, is there a way to upgrade it, besides an external wireless card? Thanks!!

A situation like yours would result. There is a CD from dell you install after the OS install to get all the parts working. Did you try that? Bob

This system was used, and they had it reset so I wouldn't have to deal with all their stuff on the cumputer. They gave me the Windows XP installation disk, and several others, but no Dell CD like the one you mention, I asked and they said they gave me all the CDs they could find, so I guess it must be lost. Is there somewhere I can download it from? Thanks again!!

Which leads me to believe that Bob is absolutely right about the missing disk. I looked on Dell's site, and found several downloads for my computer. Any idea which one I need? Is it something called a chipset, or maybe quickset? Do I need to re-install Windows again to install this, or can I just install it right now, with Windows and other items I have since installed? Your help is so appreciated! Thanks so much!!

Sorry I didn't provide the right info earlier, I had no idea there were many wireless options available for the same computer. I thought you were asking for the model number of the computer Now, I was wondering how do I determine which mouse/touchpad I have, in order to update the drivers. It seems to be missing several options, such as scrolling etc.. Thanks again for being so helpful, you are my hero!

The exact model number might help. There were many variants of the 6000. Bob PS. Hey, you're doing the hard work. I'm just pointing or shining a dim light on the path.

I went into System Information, and it has loads of things listed, but I do not see what could be the exact model. I looked on the back of the computer to see if there was any additional info. Again, lost of numbers etc..., but I don't see what could be the exact model number. I tried Belarc, it did give some info, but still no exact model, or what type of mouse i have. I have the service tag number, does that help any? Again, thanks so much!!

I entered the info at dell.com, and it listed all kinds of components originally installed, it even analyzed and listed ones currently installed, however it lists everything but the mouse pad. I am also having trouble finding a driver for my ethernet controller. It lists it with an exclamation point in device manager. Ugh! I should be very happy my aunt gave me this beautiful computer, but it is really proving to be a pain. I think she thought she was doing me a favor by removing all her old work stuff, but I think it would have been much easier had she left it as is. Can you think of any solution to finding the right drivers, short of paying those jerks at dell who won't even talk to me unless I pay them? Thanks again!!

Installed the correct mouse drivers, and even figured out the ethernet controller drivers also. Now, my last challenge is how to transfer my files and programs from my old computer to my new one. Any suggestions? I have an ethernet canle to join the two, and have set up a network. Do I just copy from one to the other, or is there another method which must be followed? I have tried copying and pasting, but things still don't show up on my new comoputer. Any suggestions? Thanks again!!
