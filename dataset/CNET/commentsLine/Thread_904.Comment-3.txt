interesting note via the specs as its energy complaint and that means it goes to &quot;sleep&quot; thus it may not have a switch.
honestly, you have to look over the unit and go from that.
otherwise, place on a power strip and shutdown 100% that way after you allow it to go to sleep(idle).
basically, the ptr.
is using a logic circuit to keep it on/off as i suspect very much like a pc.
if that's the case, check for any s/w feature to control that action.
that's my best guess as so many printers out there.
and yes, imho that's not a good thing.
of course, you can pull the ac plug.
