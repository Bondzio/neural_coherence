my internal dual-format dvd rewritable drive recently stopped recognizing disks.
whether i try to read or write.
it worked faily well until i installed new firmware.
i would like to uninstall the firmware but can't figure out how.
i tried system restore but none of the restore dates would work.
the device manager says that it is working properly.
but whenever i put a disk into it, it prompts me to insert a disk.
any suggestions?
?
