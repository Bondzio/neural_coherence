when you say simply re-install windows which in my particular case would be windows 95; do you mean by use of the windows 95 cd?
my brother gave me this computer as a birthday gift 6 years ago come this june 2005 and unfortunately a windows 95 cd wasn't included with it so that would be a problem; correct?
i've got my eyes on that new emachine t6212 i think; that might not be the correct model number.
since i know basically nothing about the workings of a computer; if i do decide to buy that emachine; should i also consider purchasing an extended warranty or not?
if so for how many years?
please advise.
