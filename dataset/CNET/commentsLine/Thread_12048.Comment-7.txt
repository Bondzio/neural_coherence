maybe a simpler example.
you take your pc which has a gig interface and plug it directly into the cable modem and how fast would you expect it to run.
the reason you would want a faster router is if you wanted to say stream video between devices inside your house.
since this does not pass though the modem it could run at the speed the router allows.
now bobs comments are the reason it all doesn't matter.
lets say you wanted to copy file from your friends pc and he only has a dsl connection that can run 384k.
no matter how fast your modem is you are restricted by his device.
this is true for all types of connection you just can't find out how slow or fast they run.
