<s> I recently uninstalled a zip drive. </s>
<s> Since then, I cannot read from the A: drive, or my CD or DVD drives. </s>
<s> Obviously, I have disturbed something, but cannot figure out what. </s>
<s> All cables are in place. </s>
<s> Can anyone help please? </s>
<s> (The drives show up in Windows, as normal, but on every one of the drives, I get the error message The disk in drive ? </s>
<s> is not formatted. </s>
<s> Do you want to format it now? </s>
<s> whenever I try to use it). </s>
<s> It's a Win 2K machine. </s>
<s> Many thanks squiggles </s>
<s> but the BIOS was probably setup so that it was seen as the A drive [possibly], which is normally a floppy drive on the floppy controller as oppised to the IDE controller. </s>
<s> This was probably done in the BIOS by disabling the normal floppy. </s>
<s> Look in your BIOS to see if the floppy is enabled and set to be a 1.44 MB drive. </s>
<s> Many thanks for trying, Ray. </s>
<s> I've had a look. </s>
<s> It's set up correctly in there - listed as floppy drive, 1.44MB. </s>
<s> I just don't understand why this has affected all 3 drives! </s>
<s> was the Zip drive on. </s>
<s> How was it jumpered [master or slave]? </s>
<s> Who is the mfr of the harddrive? </s>
<s> Some use different jumpering if the drive is the only one on the cable and if there is a second drive on the same cable. </s>
<s> Removing one could foul up that. </s>
<s> And, of course, you, one of humans, was inside the computer. </s>
<s> We humans usually are found to be the cause of such problems at least 95% of the time, and in the physical area that we penetrated. </s>
<s> [based on over 30 years of troubleshooting]. </s>
<s> Check all your cables connections. </s>
<s> If you already did that DO IT AGAIN. </s>
<s> Two incidents in these forums in the last two weeks where the poster said they had checked everything. </s>
<s> When they checked again the system booted up with zero problems. </s>
<s> Did you tell us what Op Sys you were using? </s>
<s> If you have all of the drivers you might delete the ENUM key in the registry and reboot and let Windows find the hardware again. </s>
<s> It won't find the Zip this time. </s>
<s> Don't do this without further discussions. </s>
<s> OK, thanks, Ray. </s>
<s> Point taken about checking and double-checking, then checking once again. </s>
<s> Here is as much as I can tell you: O/S Win 2K I have changed no jumper settings at all. </s>
<s> I have changed no motherboard connections at all My (physical) top drive is a DVD-ROM (Samsung DVD-ROM ST-616T). </s>
<s> Next is my CD writer/reader (HL-DT-ST CD-RW 8400B). </s>
<s> Both of these are on the same cable, alone, with no others, and both are jumpered on the first setting. </s>
<s> FD is on its own cable alone. </s>
<s> I have tried putting everything back the way it was, but that did not work. </s>
<s> Im at the stage now, that I wanted to be. </s>
<s> DVD-ROM, CD writer/reader and FD all in, and no Zip drive. </s>
<s> (The Zip drive was on the same cable as the HD, and was jumpered as a slave) I dont think there is anything else I can tell you, except that: The HD is 74.5GB, of which 19.8 GB is free. </s>
<s> The details that I can make out are Maxtor 6L080J4 this is working absolutely fine. </s>
<s> The BIOS is reading the A: drive correctly. </s>
<s> I have tried leaving a disk in all 3 drives when rebooting. </s>
<s> To add to the conundrum, this is what happens on startup, if I leave disks in the drives. </s>
<s> The A: drive does not read at all. </s>
<s> The DVD and the CD drives will do a listing (I can get at *.txt files on both, but I cannot play a CD/DVD). </s>
<s> Now, if I remove the CD and the DVD disks that I left in on reboot, and put them back in, I get the error message I was talking about - The disk in drive ? </s>
<s> is not formatted. </s>
<s> Do you want to format it now? </s>
<s> whenever I try to use any of them. </s>
<s> So, it is now happening on all 3 drives. </s>
<s> Regards squiggles </s>
<s> From the control panel, system, device manager. </s>
<s> Check to be sure that the IDE channels are enabled. </s>
<s> They may be recognized properly, but if not enabled in device manager, they will not work. </s>
<s> Best of Luck. </s>
