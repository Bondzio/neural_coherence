I have just started building systems for enthusiasts and every day users.
The average is one syetm a day basing upon different specs.The one thing my clients require is a full system recovery option (one button recovery solution)I would like to do the following: - Create a samll partition on my hard drive for drive image and be able to hide it as well.
- After fully installing and optimizing Windows XP Pro alongwith system drivers create a full-system image (like the OEMs) - Be able to access the image upon boot (like that one-button recovery stuff used by OEMs) whenever I want to resort to a full system restore.
- Also, please advise me on which software should I be using for this purpose which should be reliable and professional.
Help will be appreciated!
