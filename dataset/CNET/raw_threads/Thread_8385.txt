I cannot open the &quot;Network Setup Wizard&quot;. I go to Control Panel and double-click the &quot;Network Setup Wizard&quot; icon and get no response at all... other than the cursor turning into an hourglass for about half a second. When I open &quot;Network Connections&quot;, I get a warning that &quot;The Network Connections Folder was unable to retrieve the list of network adapters on your machine. Make sure that the Network Connections service is enabled and running&quot;. &quot;Start &gt; Run &gt; services.msc&quot; shows that the Network Connections feature starts automatically. I have a working Internet connection - a wireless setup with a Linksys router and a Linksys PCI adapter. I set it up on this machine (a desktop with Windows XP Home SP2) 3 years ago and it has worked well ever since. At the time that I went wireless with the desktop, I remember going through and changing several settings in order to ease my mind concerning security issues... I turned off the file sharing, etc., as I only had the one computer. I recently purchased a laptop and was trying to set up file sharing between it and the desktop through the router and it seems that I need access to either the &quot;Network Setup Wizard&quot; or at least be able to see the current network connection in order to change the settings and allow the desktop to communicate with the laptop. I've tried searching for files with &quot;network wizard&quot;, &quot;file sharing&quot; and &quot;tcpip&quot; in them and have found nothing helpful. I have looked through the event files after having tried to open the Network Setup Wizard. I don't really know what to look for, but I was hoping that something would stand out to where I could tell what the problem is. I had some components replaced on the desktop motherboard a couple years ago and the tech didn't return my recovery disc. He has since closed up shop and I have no idea how to contact him. I would be happy to provide more info if it would help. Any constructive thoughts would be appreciated

Warning this software can remove things you don't want/need removed. It is available from here: http://www.download.com/3120-20_4.html?qt=registry+software&tag=srch&tg=dl-20 2) Reinstall OS. I'd go with the registry repair software. That's all I have for you. This thread untracked.
