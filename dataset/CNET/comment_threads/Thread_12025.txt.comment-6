You probably won't find what your looking for in a retail or online consumer outlet for a pure Tablet based device.
My advice is to check with the local NZ wireless providers for a tablet based device as they will have to support the data/wireless plan for Windows or Android and the hardware was most likely designed specifically for them.
By comparison Apple supports the iPad regardless of wireless carrier because they own the hardware and OS.
