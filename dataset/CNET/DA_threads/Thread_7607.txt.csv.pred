1.1.1	I changed my internet provider from knology cable to ATT dsl today .	St
1.1.2	I followed the directions provided with the hardware ATT sent .	St
1.1.3	I am reusing a netgear wnr2000 wireless router that I had used with the knology internet .	St
1.1.4	The ssid was & quot ; mynet & quot ; .	St
1.1.5	I have the network setup as follows : The phone line coming from the wall is plugged into the Modem , which is a 2wired RG2701HG-00 .	St
1.1.6	I have the netgear WNR2000 plugged into one of the ethernet ports on the 2wired box .	St
1.1.7	If I view available wireless networks , I can see & quot ; mynet & quot ; network from where I had setup a wireless network when I had knology and a second one with the SSID & quot ; 2wired534 & quot ; .	St
1.1.8	I have two laptops I am trying to setup to use this wireless setup .	St
1.1.9	One laptop connects fine to & quot ; mynet & quot ; but the other does n't .	St
1.1.10	The other laptop seems to try to connect at different times to & quot ; mynet & quot ; and to & quot ; 2wired534 & quot ; but never get past the & quot ; Acquiring network address & quot ; stage .	St
1.1.11	The settings are the same on each as far as type of wireless connection , security , password etc .	St
1.1.12	for & quot ; mynet & quot ; It looks to me like both the Netgear box and the 2wired box are access points .	St
1.1.13	But I do n't quite understand why one laptop connects fine to & quot ; mynet & quot ; and the other does n't .	St
1.1.14	I know this is all very rambling .	St
1.1.15	I guess my question is what is the proper way to set this network up .	St
1.1.16	Is it as simple as using only the 2wired box and taking the netgear box out of the loop ?	Ques
1.1.17	CD	St
1.2.1	The 2 wire device seems to be this model http : //www.2wire.com/ ? p=106 If so , this would be a complete ADSL modem/Router/Wireless solution and you do n't need the Netgear -- which was primarily designed for use with cable .	St
