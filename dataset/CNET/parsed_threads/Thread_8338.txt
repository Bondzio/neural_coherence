<s> Hi,I've had a problem several times in the past where I'm trying to move or save files to my freecom ext hard drive and I get the message &quot;disc full&quot;.When checking this I find I have in fact still got 32gb of free space. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me shed some light on this please,thanks-John </s>
<s> If so, the top directory can be full. </s>
<s> Fix? </s>
<s> Use subdirectories. </s>
<s> Also, a FAT32 drive can't hold a file over 4GB in size. </s>
<s> No fix is planned. </s>

<s> Thanks for the reply Bob,no its ntfs,though I dont really understand that. </s>
<s> What I did in the end was to transfer everything on that drive to another then format the drive in question and now it seems to hold whatever I put in(up to its capacity of course) It really puzzles me that this should happen so thanks for any input--John </s>
<s> Even though NTFS sidesteps that number, some applications can't handle too many files in the root or top directory. </s>
<s> But it looks like it was corrupted somehow. </s>
<s> Did you try CHDKSK on it? </s>
