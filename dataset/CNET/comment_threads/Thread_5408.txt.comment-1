Did a MOBO upgrade a while back.
With everything else, I got USB 2.0(also added Firewire A card).
When paying extra for USB 2.0 cables, I noticed they don't appear to be any different than my USB 1.1 cables.
Asked a knowledgeable salesperson, he said USB 2.0 cables are marked.
I can find no difference!
Either this is just a marketing ploy or I have been using, then giving away USB 2.0 cables.
Does anyone have any info about this?
