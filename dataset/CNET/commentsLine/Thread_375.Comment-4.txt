i dont think the computer will start itself for maintenance since automatic update and virus software are run by the windows os and not by the hardware (windows software does not boot) on the other hand, the bios has a setting for starting the computer at a certain date, at a certain time.
i also dont think the &quot;wake up&quot; options work for a full boot, i thing they are to wake from soft off.
