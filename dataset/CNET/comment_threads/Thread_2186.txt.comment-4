It will depend somewhat on what type of equipment you have what level of protection is available.
But the first step is to setup encryption.
Most will support WEP or WPA, with WPA being the stronger.
I would also disable the broadcasting of your SSID, and if you are so inclined, you can go as far as implementing a MAC filter if your equipment supports it.
Other advanced features will depend on your equipment.
I would also make sure you have changed the default password for your router to something stronger, as the default passwords are published all over the internet.
