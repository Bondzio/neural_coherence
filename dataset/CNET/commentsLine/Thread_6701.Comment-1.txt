my dual system is win 98 & win xp on 80gb hdd with 512 mb ram.
my scanner was connected with my old system with win 98 se and the scanner was working fine.replaced the system with new one but the scanner does not detect on either os.checking device manager does not show any imaging device.
since the scanner is old, i have driver for the same on floppies but do not know how to install the scanner and then install the driver for the same.
appreciate some help.
thanks.
