<s> I have an old HP that's going to have to last me a little longer. </s>
<s> So yes, I realize some of these dated CPU's are overpriced relative to more powerful options. </s>
<s> I am however, limited by my motherboard. </s>
<s> Here is the situation. </s>
<s> My motherboard: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00906129&lc=en&cc=de&dlc=en&product=3424294%E2%8C%A9=en My current CPU: http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103776 The Options: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103645 I realize this is above 5600+. </s>
<s> However, TDP is still 89w. </s>
<s> Is it safe to say this would be compatible? </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103771 Though this is an older core and has TDP of 89w rather than the 65w of its Brisbane equivalent, it boasts double the L2 cache. </s>
<s> This is for a PC that is heavily used for gaming, and 3-D graphics software (decreasing rendering times is a huge thing). </s>
<s> What do you recommend? </s>
<s> I'd forget the CPU as you have a 2+GHz dual core. </s>
<s> Shop for a better GPU. </s>
<s> I need this for faster overall performance and lower render times in 3-D apps. </s>
<s> I already have GeForce 9800GTX+. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103685 </s>
<s> After many years I now write the speed gain is nearly linear in the same model lines. </s>
<s> That is your common X2 at 2.2GHz is 10% faster thatn the 2.0. </s>
<s> All that's left for you to do is get the motherboard maker to say the CPU is supported. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I was of the understanding that the numbers like &quot;6000&quot; were just superficial indicators of the max TDP supported, which in my case is 89w. </s>
<s> So I thought the 89w 6000 would be compatible. </s>
<s> Is this inaccurate? </s>
<s> Also there is a 65w version of this http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103234 . </s>
<s> I'd have to purchase from somewhere else but they seem identical with the exception of the TDP. </s>
<s> Wouldn't I want lower TDP? </s>
<s> I'm still wondering if the bigger Windsor cache will yield the most performance. </s>
<s> Can anybody help me with this? </s>
<s> The Windsor model has a much larger cache. </s>
<s> Would this change things? </s>
<s> Only in benchmarks is where you'll see it and at the same clock rate with more cache the effect is usually below 2%. </s>
<s> Why 2% is important is that humans can't tell the difference until about 2%. </s>
<s> So take time to find Tom's Hardware CPU benchmarks but after all is said and done I like to see in the nearly same CPU line more GHz and same Watts when changing the CPU out. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> your system mfgs DOCs. </s>
<s> CPU-MB compatibility is BIOS driven so while it may have socket compatibility, you could have problems ranging from not working at all to working but not reflecting the right CPU specs. </s>
<s> If there two processor that appear to match the spec, I'd contact the system mfg to make sure which is correct for your system. </s>
<s> Good luck and let us know how it works. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
