Hmmm ... no external disks and yes ... definately a Windows problem!
Thanks, you did open another avenue of investigation, it's a SATA system disk and has a RAID controller associated (although it's not RAIDED) and there is an error with XMASSCSI in the event log on startup.
This does seem to occur AFTER the 30 second delay in the startup sequence of events but is worth some experimentation I guess.
Oh for another 30 seconds!
Thanks again.
