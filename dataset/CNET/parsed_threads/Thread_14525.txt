<s> Ok, this is a big complicated. </s>
<s> My system (a 1.6 P4) has two hard drives, both in NTFS format: the master (C) is a 40 gig western digital with Windows 2k Pro on it, and the slave (D) is a 160 gig Maxtor. </s>
<s> Earlier in the week the D: drive ceased to be accessible in Windows; it no longer appears in My Computer and cannot be reached through any shortcuts. </s>
<s> However, it is still shows up as the Primary slave during startup (good thing, as the C: is obviously configured as a master drive and not a single), as well as in the BIOS and in Windows Device Manager. </s>
<s> My power supply died the next day, so Im assuming that was the culprit, and killed the directory or the partition table or whatever. </s>
<s> I replaced the power supply and tried a few programs, trying to get at the files on D: long enough to at least burn some things. </s>
<s> HDD Regenerator supposedly managed to fix a few dozen corrupted sectors, and a program called TestDisk lets me see a list of the files and folders on D:, but no other luck. </s>
<s> My plan (and tell me if you have a better one, please) is to do a complete copy of D: onto another hard drive, in a last ditch effort to save my files. </s>
<s> A SeaGate 300 gig arrived in the mail today to serve this purpose, it is currently still in the box, unformatted. </s>
<s> My question iswhat is the best way to go about this copy? </s>
<s> I have a Maxtor Ultra ATA PCI card that Im not usingshould I try and add a third hard drive to an already packed system (I have a DVD drive and a CD burner as well) long enough to perform the copy? </s>
<s> Should I temporarily attach the new SeaGate to another computer on my home network? </s>
<s> The problem with that is, I imagine I would have to be in Windows to use the network, and the D: is not accessible through Windows (the heart of the problem). </s>
<s> If I temporarily take out my current C: and put the new drive in its place, could I do the copy without installing Windows? </s>
<s> Any other ideas? </s>
<s> Copy program suggestions would also be welcome. </s>
<s> On all my machines, I use two hard drives. </s>
<s> One for the master and one to backup an exact duplicate of the master. </s>
<s> I use two detachable trays to hold and extract every thing. </s>
<s> Ghost is a bit copier that runs in a Dos enviornment and will copy everything backwards or forward. </s>
<s> I can use any of the machines to &quot;Ghost&quot; any disk that I want to by inserting the master and slave in any machine, which I do several times a week. </s>
<s> If my master gets corrupted, I can copy from the slave in about 15min. </s>
<s> or take the slave, make it master, plug it in and I am good to go. </s>
<s> I experiment a lot and this arrangement has saved my soul more than once. </s>
<s> Now your plan is a good one. </s>
<s> Use a machine, any machine, plug the one drive in on the master and plug the new drive as slave, then insert a Boot copy of Ghost in the A drive, power up the machine and follow the on screen directions. </s>
<s> I use an old 2002 copy of Ghost. </s>
<s> Norm </s>
<s> I've got a copy of Norton Ghost 8.0. </s>
<s> I just tried using it, and while it could 'see' the D: drive, but it is greyed out in th menu, unlike the C: drive. </s>
<s> It can't make an image of it, or copy it...it says the drive is not partitioned, and so cannot be accessed. </s>
<s> Just formatted the new 300 gig seagate. </s>
<s> So I just need to find a copy program that can access the problematic maxtor... </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I've seen this many times. </s>
<s> Especially with external drives that have lost power while connected to windows. </s>
<s> EasyRecovery DataRecovery can recover the data. </s>
<s> It's $200, but it will do it. </s>
<s> You can download a trial from the ontrack website that will let you see what files are recoverable before purchasing. </s>
<s> This is the only solution that works that I have experience with. </s>
<s> Ghost won't work because your file system/ partition is lost. </s>
<s> Even if you did a sector by sector copy you still wouldn't be able to access the data because Ghost won't seen the file system. </s>
<s> Disk Wizard will not allow you to see or recreate the old file system, just reformat the drive with a new one. </s>
<s> Hi. </s>
<s> Could you please let us know an update of your situation&gt;? </s>
<s> what did you use in the end and what was the result? </s>
<s> I have just had a scare with myE: drive which has about 80G of movies and other things on there, i am right now scanning it in the background with HDD Regenerator. </s>
<s> I already have a copy of the program recommended by ontrack so I am armed; just hoping I don't need it! </s>
<s> I would like to know what happened here though so do let us know. </s>
<s> A hard disk is temporary storage. </s>
<s> If you don't believe it, I'll wait. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> hi, i work for a professional data recovery company and have a feeling that while you are copying your data, it may or may not be a success. </s>
<s> try to seek the help of a professional data recovery company who are experts in retrieving data out of corrupted drives. </s>
<s> most data recovery programs are not very expensive, and you could in fact have saved the cost of buying a new hard drive if you had sought help from people like us. </s>
<s> the cost of one our products is less than half of what you spent on the new drive. </s>
<s> anyway, there's still hope. </s>
<s> my comapny's website address is http://www.stellarinfo.com try it out once... </s>
