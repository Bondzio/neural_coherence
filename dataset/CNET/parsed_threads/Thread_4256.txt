<s> In general, you need a ROUTER. </s>
<s> Each computer needs a NETWORK ADAPTER. </s>
<s> The router and network adapters can be wired or wireless--your choice. </s>
<s> Some 2Wire gateways are a combination DSL modem & Router with 4 network ports and wireless capability. </s>
<s> Which one model do you have? </s>

<s> The 2wire model I have is: 1701HG Gateway. </s>
<s> What is a network adapter? </s>
<s> Thanks Anthony </s>
<s> Your 2Wire 1701HG Gateway is supposed to have 4 ports for making wired connections and the ability to make wireless connections. </s>
<s> Connect up to 4 computers with a newtork cable to share the broadband Internet service. </s>
<s> The network cable plugs into the computer's network adapter (sometimes called an ethernet adapter, network interface card, NIC, 10/100 adapter, et al.). </s>
<s> If you want to make wireless connections to your 2Wire gateway, your gateway needs to be wireless capable and each computer that is to connect wirelessly is to have a wireless network adapter that is compatible with the gateway. </s>
<s> If your gateway doesn't have multiple network ports or wireless capability, you can add a WIRELESS BROADBAND ROUTER to it. </s>
