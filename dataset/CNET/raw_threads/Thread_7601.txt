It's modem is connected to a satllite modem. It still has a charged battery in it. I know nothing about laptops, but I know how ATX power works. The question is whether or not the laptop power is like an ATX computer and the Standby power line from the power supply stays on. If it does stay on, then it seems that to protect more surely one should disconnect from the satellite modem. I don't come back here too often, but I never fail to get the correct answers from these great posters. Thanx Ray Harinec

An ATX PS does keep a control voltage on the PC that can be used for wake-on-lan, wake-on-ring devices. So, theoretically, someone could send a wake up signal (magic packet) to a network card to wake the laptop if the laptop was hard wired to the network. As well, if the laptop had a telephone type modem that supported wake-on-ring, it could be started remotely. Once the OS was running, the laptop could be hijacked but not beforehand.

At some point Norton [no idea what version] reported an intrusion attempt. It is not clear to me exactly when the report occurred. I can't discuss it directly with the person whose computer had the report, as to what was being done at the time. He apparently has something going on in his life that causes him to suspect that omeone may e trying to hak into his omputer. My real inrest is whether such things as wake on LAN etc can work in a laptop, thus the ATX type power question. Also thus I would advise him to unplug his satellite modem whenever he is not using the computer. I think that Steven Haninger answered me.

If one is, can the wake on turn the computer on boot up, intrude and then return the system to the OFF [standby power] mode?

But, the intrusion would need to include a program that would take control of your desktop and allow a shutdown command such as can be done if remote desktop is enabled. Evidence of someone booting and shutting down your system would be found in the event log by noting the times/dates in the system area. You would know by looking there.

The question was simply does a laptop have a power system similiar to an ATX tower, thus always a standby voltage? I now realize that it could not have such. It seems that if it did and the battery slowly reuced it's voltage the standby source would get into a never never region, where digital logic would do many unplanned events flicking back and forth it's ones and zeros.

I will answer YES on my newest HP dv6910us since you can turn it off and on via a small IR remote control. To do that, some circuit has to be energized. Bob
