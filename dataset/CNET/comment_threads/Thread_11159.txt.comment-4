I did find out that my onboard AGP video is the same as the Intel740.
Now will the Intel740 be better since it's an AGP 2X instead of PCI?
The Radeon 7200 I have is a PCI version so the bus isn't as fast as if it were AGP.
But I needed to know is that since my motherboard can only take PCI type cards will the Intel740 AGP 2X be better than the Radeon 7200 PCI?
