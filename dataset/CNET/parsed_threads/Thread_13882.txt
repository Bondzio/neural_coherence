<s> A tech guy in my office says that HPs have a reputation of breaking down and requiring expensive repairs. </s>
<s> He says Dell and Gateway have less problems in this regard. </s>
<s> I'm looking to buy a new desktop and am considering an HP vs. a Dell. </s>
<s> Any thoughts or experience with HP reliability? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> At the office and home we have both. </s>
<s> But the Dells have 10 times the failures but since we have 10 times more Dells that brings us back to &quot;same.&quot; The same issues occur so for today, both are pretty good if you stay away from trying to cram a gaming machine into a laptop. </s>

<s> Dell and HP both make alot of systems, they do break down. </s>
<s> The numbers jive with the numbers sold. </s>
<s> What that means, if you sell 1M systems, expect at least 10% to fail outright, if you sold 1K systems, same applies. </s>
<s> It really gets to point, choose what you like and feel comfortable with. </s>
<s> Read the warrany and hope for the best, because of &quot;off-shore phone support&quot;, etc.. </s>
<s> When it comes to OEMs get exactly what you need so you don't get into upgrades later, while they can be done, you know it worked, the day you got it. </s>
<s> FYI - If you get a lemon, document everything, that way hopefully it can be resolved quickly and/or satisfactory. </s>
<s> Believe me, I fix both HP and Dell, so it doesn't matter to me they all fail sooner or later for whatever reason. </s>
<s> I tend to lean towards Dell, IMHO that isn't much. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> We had a Dell Dimension 3000 power supply fail when shorted by a live bug; not a PS fault. </s>
<s> I had other new name-brand PS's on hand that wouldn't fit in the case. </s>
<s> My guru said Dell has the supply re-packaged to offset one of the four mounting holes so only the Dell mechnically fits. </s>
<s> Otherwise, the 3000 has been reliable for over three years. </s>
<s> I'm about to get an HP P6150T (special sale) because my built-system motherboard died and is NLA. </s>
<s> Maybe I'll get some on-topic HP info for here. </s>
