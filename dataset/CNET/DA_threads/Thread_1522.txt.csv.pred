1.1.1	Recently I decided to defrag my disk drive ( Dell 4100 37 Gig capacity ) and after that was completed , everytime I boot my system Scandisk starts running and it takes forever ( about 10 hours ) to complete so I cancel out everytime .	St
1.1.2	I contacted Dell and they asked me to diag the disk by bringing up system diagnostics and pressing 'ctrl-alt-d ' ( NOT 'ctrl-alt-del ' ) to start hard disk diagnostics .	St
1.1.3	The thing ran for a minute and came back with a 'RC=7 ' error code .	St
1.1.4	The Dell agent said my hard disk is about to die and I need a new hard disk .	St
1.1.5	Is this true ?	Ques
1.1.6	My compueter runs albeit erratiically but it is usable .	St
1.1.7	Can anyone help me with this ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	That 's what these diagnostics are for .	St
1.2.2	The good news is this can be a cheap part .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
