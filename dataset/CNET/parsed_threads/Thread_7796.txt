<s> What is your suggestion for air cooling of a Socket A processor? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> anything Thermalright has will be the best aircooling you can buy if not, consider some of Thermaltake's $30 ranged stuff, or Zalman's 92MM based cooler (it's huge, and won't work with some boards) $20 for a HSF is way to cheap </s>
<s> Flower cooler with 120 mm fan that mounts on your pci screwz, ugly, little hassle but worth it. </s>
<s> it's QUIET!!! </s>
<s> Comes with a speed control for the fan , way cool...and did I say quiet? </s>
<s> Use these guys they're local: http://store.yahoo.com/directron/cnps6000.html </s>
<s> Which one??? </s>
<s> There are many with different cooling requirments. </s>

<s> just wondering, never seen those in deployment on an AthlonXP/higher K7 but I have heard tell of them on Socket 370 and lower K7's (Athlon's, and older Duron's) and working great but I would personally suggest this one http://store.yahoo.com/directron/cnps7700alcu.html if you'd like Zalman/if your motherboard supports it (as it's an excellent cooler) one thing you need to keep in mind, both of the Zalman coolers listed here go WELL OVER the maximum weight spec'd for Socket A by AMD, which is set at 300g, and both of these easily surpass that the one I linked to however uses a backplate (simmilar to Pentium 4 coolers) which can help in removing some weight from the actual socket http://www.xoxide.com/thermalright-si-97-cpu-cooler.html ^ that is the cooler I have and the cooler I would buy again, and again, if I needed a good Socket A heatsink while it is BIG (that top &quot;level&quot; is 92MM exactly, for a 92MM fan to sit on) it weighs only 280g without fan WITH a fan it's around 400, which is safe (while 300 is the max, you can go over a bit) as long as your not moving the computer around a lot (i.e. </s>
<s> if you LAN party just be a little more careful) http://www.xoxide.com/thsibofork7a.html ^ that is also a decent cooler, it won't have performance on par with the SI-97, but it's cheaper (it does however include a fan) i'm not seeing a weight stated, but i'm guessing it's at or close to 300g (most of Thermaltake's reference style coolers are, by reference I mean simmilar to the stock cooler AMD themsevles uses (Which is just the basic heatsink with a fan on top, no fancy heat pipes or towers) as for tower heatsinks, while they may provide some of the BEST TEMPERATURES YOU HAVE EVER SEEN, they WEIGH A LOT (I believe the Tower 112 is around 900g unladen with fans) they will rip sockets off of motherboards I remember in one review a tester was using an EPoX board that had already died as an example, he put in an old CPU, dropped the board 1&quot; and it bounced the heat sink off, taking the CPU and the ZIF socket (the entire plastic socket) right off the board that destroyed the board, needless to say, and it showed how oversized those are for that application if your using a Pentium 4 (this is a side note) however the tower design heatsinks are excellent, assuming you can mount it correctly and that you use correct fans I have seen 4GHZ (4000MHZ) achived on a Pentium 4 using this cooler: http://www.xoxide.com/clp0025.html do not try this at home (either hitting 4GHZ, or using that cooler on AthlonXP) i'm just telling that to show their effectiveness at cooling most of Thermaltake's higher shelf coolers should be avoided, they would include: SonicTower BigTyphoon The Beetle The Pipe101 and Asus' cooler attempt in the form of StarIce should also be avoided these are being suggested for avoidance given that their almost as big as the motherboard itself (Sonic Tower has mounting points for a pair of 120MM fans (if you've ever seen one, you realize how huge this thing really is) </s>
<s> I bought a Zalman, and they are so quiet, it is hard to believe that something that big can be so quiet, you could almost cool your house with it....lol. </s>
<s> However, the thing was too big, to use on the MOBO, that I had in mind, because the power supply gets in the way. </s>
<s> So, I may have to put it up on eBay, or save it for another MOBO, I hate to get rid of it. </s>
<s> It is sweet! </s>
<s> You probably should include the MOBO info, and the system info, so people have an idea of what to suggest. </s>
<s> Also, you may want to include what you plan on using the computer for, such as gaming and such. </s>
