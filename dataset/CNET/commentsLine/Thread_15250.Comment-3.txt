sharing on you internet ip address is a very bad idea.
how bad?
you can't imagine how bad.
even adding netbeui would be a bad idea since you are leaving yourself wide open to attacks.
-&gt; if you don't believe me, i'll just wait till you find out when the bad people find your machine with a share... bob
