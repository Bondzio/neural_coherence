1.
Nothing is plugged into any other jack in the apartment, and there is no alarm system 2.
No torrent use 3.
I need to use wifi and don't have a ethernet cable to test this out at the moment.
I read somewhere that sometimes it can mess up if it is maxing out bandwidth.
How can I limit the bandwidth for downloads to test this out?
