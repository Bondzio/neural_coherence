1.1.1	I 'm selling my old computer to try and get what meager cash I can recover before I buy my new one .	St
1.1.2	With rampant identity theft and general insecurity abound these days I would very much like to do a disk wipe before I take my system to the store .	St
1.1.3	Although the nice man said he would do one for me I would rather do it myself if you know what I mean .	St
1.1.4	Anyway , since this is the first time I have done this I was wondering if anyone would recommend a disk wipe utility ( price is irrelivant this is important stuff ) that is reliable and thorough .	St
1.1.5	Any other thoughts to consider or general information/horror stories you could help me avoid would be much appreciated .	St
1.1.6	Thanks , Jim	St

1.3.1	As the other poster listed , get KILLDISK from thier website .	St
1.3.2	http : //www.killdisk.com Use the & quot ; free & quot ; floppy or .ISO version to burn to CD .	St
1.3.3	Once done , use it and it does 1 pass removal , run again as a final pass ( you have to reload it again ) and you 're done .	St
1.3.4	You can reformat before its usage if you care to but not required .	St
1.3.5	Read thier webpage info , its interesting if anything and it does the job , simple and easy , no thoughts about it .	St
1.3.6	tada -- -- -Willy	St
