<s> I have a &quot;Toshiba Satellite Pro 430CDT&quot; that I'm trying to get open so I can replace the hard drive. </s>
<s> I have taken the obvious screws out, but still can't figure out the &quot;riddle&quot; of getting into the thing. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>

<s> I did this a few times this month and I used GHOST and a laptop hard drive adaptor to save a lot of reinstall time. </s>
<s> Thanks Bob, for getting my &quot;fat&quot; out of the fire. </s>
