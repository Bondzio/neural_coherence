PC SPECS: - XP Professional - 2.20ghz - 400w PSU - 80gig Hard Drive - DVDRW Drive - 2 x 512 DDR Ram - ATI Radeon 9200 Graphics Card - Linksys Wireless Network Adaptor - Firewire PCI Card Everytime I try and do something on my PC it restarts itself. For example if i play a game, if i burn a CD/DVD. i have a DVD creating software that came with the firewire card that i use to burn homemade DVDs (well i try to anyway) and during the burning process, it restarts. i have a gut feeling that its my 400w PSU. i'm saying this because it has thermal control. ive tryed to disable thermal control in my BIOS, but i cant get to that specific setting. What really gets to me is that when i try and change my screen resolution from display settings, it restarts. i have a strong feeling that its my PSU. Help!!!

Try to get at least 2 case fans for your computer and make sure your heatsink/fan are properly situated on the processor. A good way to lower temps and cheap is to apply arctic silver 5 compound.

Before I start, if you are to offer advice in forums this basic principle would not be a question from you. Time to ask for help and learn more. -&gt; The issue for thermal paste is simple. Any small air gap will not conduct heat very well. The paste/goo fills in that gap and the heat moves. Bob

3287	16	108832	1243157	1243144	R. Proffitt	6/14/05 1:23 PM	1.11875538E12	I wouldn't yet.	It was that sorry other person that derailed us a little. For now you can just lighten the load by dropping back to 1 hard disk, 1 CD or DVD drive and leaving the case cover off to see if its heat or power related. Be sure to keep an eye open for any bulging or leaking motherboard capacitors. Bob

3287	18	108832	1243749	1243644	datalookup	6/14/05 5:15 PM	1.1187693E12	Capacitors	Capacitors look like little ''batteries'' or ''cylinders'' on the motherboard. When the motherboard is subject to overheating or a short occurs, the capacitors will appear bulged or in extreme cases, will burst and leak on to the board causing a multitude of problems.When this happens you need to replace the motherboard. This happened to my system a while ago, I had to buy a new motherboard. System temperature monitoring (tower case) is important to maintain in order to protect the components.

If you built the rig yourself check the thermal paste. I had a LGA775 proc go wonky on me because I didn't have one of its &quot;legs&quot; properly secured, another PC went to spontaneous reboots because the PSU's cooling fan was failing. More than likely it's the PSU, PC Power & Cooling (www.pcpowerandcooling.com ) or Antec are excellent, I'm using a Zalman low-noise unit. Rule of thumb: If the PSU came with the case, pull it out & keep it for a spare, get a real one for your rig. Good luck!
