Given we can create this issue on insecure or WEP secured networks why can't it be this network?
I read your post twice and can't find the security setup.
In short our forum sticky tells a setup we find to help with the issues.
a.
Stock settings.
b. SSID Broadcasting.
c. WPA or WPA2 if you can support it.
