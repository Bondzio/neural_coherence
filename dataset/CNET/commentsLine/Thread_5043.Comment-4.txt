whew!
maybe something has changed at epson.
about 6 months or so ago i ordered a digital projector directly from epson.
it arrived doa and epson swapped out the projector overnight, without requiring me to return the first one first.
they sent a return label, etc., along with the replacement which i used to ship back the original one.
very good service.
i'll be more careful next time, given your problems.
