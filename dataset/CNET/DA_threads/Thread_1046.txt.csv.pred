1.2.1	When HP does n't supply a driver you might get to print at best and features like duplex vanish .	St
1.2.2	Nothing busted here .	St
1.2.3	Just how it works today .	St

1.4.1	yes its the one i have right now ... x64 Minidriver installation instructions - Basic Printing Support ... but is only the basic printing ... so i cant use all the features of the printer ... thanks anyway ... ill keep looking ...	St
1.5.1	Look at http : //www.virtualbox.org/ Put a 32 bit XP in that and you can get all the old features back in the virtual OS .	St
