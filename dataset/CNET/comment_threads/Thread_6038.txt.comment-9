Take bobt1956's advice and change that power supply.
The guy before that said two of the machines at his work are crap was right, but only because the power supplies, or non supplies as the case is, are the most unstable pieces of junk you could plug into a board.
The reason those computers are plagued with problems is because they're underpowered, and what power the unit is suppling is so dirty the board doesn't know if it should boot or just crumple into a smoldering heap.
Components are extremely susceptable to damage from fluxuations in the voltage rails from a bad PSU.
SWAP IT.
IT's not difficult if you want to do it yourself, just mark the connectors of the old one as to where they cam out of on the board, match them with the connectors on the new unit and plug them in.
With PSU connectors, if it fits there, that's where it goes.
