how can u say &quot;but it recenty got messed up with the BIOS, &quot; but then u say u never touched or played with the bios before?
hmm i thought abs shipped restore CDs with their computers....maybe i'm mistaken accessing the bios varies from manufacturer...usually u push a button during post, f10, f8, control, delete, not sure...i would go with the function keys as most common
