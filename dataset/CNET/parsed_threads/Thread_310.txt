<s> Had I settled for nothing else, I would have settled for the layout for a Gigabyte GA-6EX motherboard . </s>
<s> I found the manual at the http site listed later. </s>
<s> The pdf manual of 20 pages shows several figures, however the figure for the motherboard is blank. </s>
<s> I am trying to rebuild an older computer with the gigabyte MB and need help finding the graphical layout of the board. </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> Thank you http://america.giga-byte.com/MotherBoard/FileList/Manual/manual_6ex_e.pdf </s>
<s> I couldn't find anything for that board, but I could give you some advice. </s>
<s> Normaly, motherboard manufacturers tag thier ports, inputs, and pins on the board. </s>
<s> With the manual you v, it might take some time, bt I am sure you could decipher it. </s>
<s> Also, have you tried thier tech support? </s>
<s> I found a similar board manual that I am fairly sure has the same pinouts for switches/ leds etc. </s>
<s> However, in the meantime I decided to go with a newer MB, PS, memory, etc and not contend with the {&quot;problems&quot; ) of the older board. </s>
<s> Thanks much for the input. </s>
<s> Gigabyte's web site was worthless and their email response (? </s>
<s> )_ Well, I am still waiting !! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> with that vintage series. </s>
<s> They were actually proprietary mobos used in proprietary computers and poorly documented. </s>
<s> Found five varitations, compared item/location by item amd none acvtually matched. </s>
<s> Came the closest at the UK Gigabyte site. </s>
<s> The mobo had a Dell stamp, but no sign of it at Dell. </s>
<s> If you intend on using the GA-6eX, to build a system it will be difficult if you do not have all the information. </s>
<s> Here is the information I got, I am pretty sure you have the same. </s>
<s> If you can get the original book manuel you will be lucky. </s>

<s> Here is a good barebone that you would not have to spend a lot, just add CPU, Memory, Hard drive. </s>

<s> Barebone is the way to go, the cheapest. </s>
<s> This one is a lot faster than the other I mentioned earlier. </s>

<s> Good Luck Wendell H </s>
<s> thanks to all the above suggestions, I now have a rebuilt computer, but not using the gigabyte board. </s>
<s> It took 2 attempts to get a board that would fit in the case and a couple of catalog goof ups with power supplies but the box is up and running. </s>
<s> Again thanks </s>
