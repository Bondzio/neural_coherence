<s> I have been transferring files over to my new computer and I made some new folders just for my Turbo Tax info and some very important pictures. </s>
<s> Now I need to reuse it ( it's already filled up) so I can finish up. </s>
<s> How in the world to I overwrite, erase or otherwise reuse this thing? </s>
<s> All of my previous transfers are not overwritten and therefore are copied into another file! </s>
<s> It's a Lexar 512 MB if that helps.Thanx </s>
<s> NVirginian: Just Plug it in and use &quot;My Computer&quot; double click on the drive, Click on edit, select from the menu, &quot;Select All&quot; Click on file, select from the menu, &quot;Delete&quot;, and in a couple of seconds it will be empty. </s>
