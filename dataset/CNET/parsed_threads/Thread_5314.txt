<s> I have Verizon Fios, and a wireless modem/router that they've supplied. </s>
<s> It is on the 2nd floor of my home. </s>
<s> I have a device which has always had trouble with wireless connections (it is built in hardware I can't swap out). </s>
<s> It does however have an Ethernet port. </s>
<s> Is there a way to get a wireless router to receive the wireless signal from my Fios modem/router? </s>
<s> I would then hardwire the router to my device so that this device can finally get online. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> If that router has a CLIENT mode then it can be done. </s>
<s> For my TV I found a refurbished (heck I'm cheap) WNCE2001 from amazon which did this without pain. </s>

<s> maybe the idea is the same. </s>
<s> Personally have not try it. </s>
<s> Hope it can help. </s>

<s> I've been using a wireless DSL modem for a few months. </s>
<s> The computers connect to it directly, by wireless. </s>
<s> I also have a Cisco Wireless/Ethernet router, and have been wondering if I could get it back in the game by making a wireless connection between it and the DSL modem. </s>
<s> Any thoughts on that? </s>
