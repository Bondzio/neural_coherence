Its the emachine side of things keeping you from proceeding and yeah it suppose to act that way, it wants to see emachine mtrbd.. Of course the XP OEM version provided by emachine is basically looking for what you had registered it as, too many changes and it goes bananas.
If it remains on the emachine side of things and if it did that a relaod of the OS would cure it, and NOPE!
doing that now won't work with new mtrbd.. good luck -----Willy
