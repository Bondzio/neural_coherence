I have 1 x 512 DDR RAM installed, and am looking to upgrade this. I believe that the RAM i have installed at the moment is PCR 2700, although I can't be sure. I need to know whether I should add another 512 RAM, another 1GB, or take the existing RAM out and replace it with 1GB. I am not sure whether there will be a great difference between these 3 options, and was hoping someone would help me out with making a decision. I know that my computer does not support duel-channel memory. Another website suggested that I buy a stick of RAM PCR 2300, but I'm not sure whether this will be different to buying another PCR 2700 as I have no idea what that actually means. Can anyone help out? Thanks.

Many of today's systems are built with dual channel memory architecture which means it is advantageous to add in DIMMs in pairs...2@512MBs vice 1@1GB. If you download and run CPUZ .. it should tell you what RAM you have in your system and whether it's one DIMM or two DIMMs. VAPCMD

Interestingly enough your computer shipped with four different models of motherboards, so the motherboard model sure helped. Before purchasing, please confirm you have two RAM slots and not four, just in case. If that is correct, you can install a 1GB stick of RAM if you like, with no need to remove the 512MB, bumping it up to 1.5GB. You could likewise just insert another 512MB stick to reduce the cost, totaling 1GB. As to PC3200 vs PC2700, the higher the number the faster it is, generally speaking. You can safely mix-and-match PC3200 with PC2700, which results in all RAM running at the slower of the speeds. Ideally you'd want all PC3200, but it's better to have 1.5GB running as PC2700 than 1GB running as PC3200. Hope this helps, John

PC2700 runs slower than PC3200, but since you already have a PC2700 stick it doesn't matter which you choose as it would be forced to run at the slower PC2700 speed. As far as price is concerned, that varies. There are frequently sales that make PC3200 cheaper than PC2700 or vice versa, so just shop around for both and snag the best deal. John
