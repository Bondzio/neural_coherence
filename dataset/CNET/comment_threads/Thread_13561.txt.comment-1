My computer has these specs: AMD Anthlon XP 2400+ 640 Mb.
PC-2100 RAM 160 Gb.
Maxtor Diamondmax 9 Hard Drive Nvidia Geforce FX 5700VE 256 Video Mb.
250 Watt Power Supply ( not sure what the motherboard is....) Whenever I buy games, I do look at the system requirements and the recommended requirements, however some games like World of Warcraft and Far Cry has a recommended spec that is close to my computer's specs, but when I play those kind of games, I experience lots of lags, and my computer won't be able to handle graphics to the max.
Since my computer is a recommended computer, how come it lags?
