<s> I have a belkin n+ v2. </s>
<s> I have noticed that in xfire and aim, i get logged off and it says reconnecting in ..... </s>
<s> I've come to realize that my router is disconnecting me from the internet for a split second, because it happens alot like once every ten minutes, but i have never fully lost connection from the internet. </s>
<s> This is really annoying. </s>
<s> Is my unit defective? </s>
<s> Have I diagnosed my problem wrong? </s>
<s> I really need help. </s>
<s> This router is only 6 months old. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> I can't tell if you are using the forum's advised setup. </s>
<s> After that, set the router to 802.11g mode. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> im wired..btw not wirelss </s>
<s> Since the default could be wifi enabled with WEP for security, I'd follow the forum sticky for setup EVEN IF YOU ARE WIRED. </s>
<s> If you don't need wifi, disable it in the router. </s>
<s> In closing, if you are running TORRENTS, drops are a sign. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I am having the exact same problem with the same router. </s>
<s> No matter what security setup I have played with, I haven't been able to make it stop disconnecting me. </s>
<s> This wasn't too big of an issue until I hooked up my new PS3. </s>
<s> It drops connection about every other match. </s>
<s> I have been debating just buying a new router even though I can't afford it. </s>
<s> I've been looking for a solution for about 6 months now and still havent found one. </s>
<s> I'm even up to date on the firmware. </s>
<s> As such I can't comment. </s>
<s> Try the forum preferred settings. </s>
<s> Yea this is really annoying... What are these &quot;prefered settings&quot;....i see a bunch of random posts in the stickied topics. </s>
<s> http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html?threadID=264135&tag=forums06;forum-threads It's a shame members don't post the settings. </s>
<s> We love to take potshots at hiding the SSID (causes drops) or security that breaks in 120 or less seconds. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I am not using wireless, I dont care about my ssid, I dont care about wireless security because wireless is OFF. </s>
<s> I am on a WIRED CONNECTION.......geez </s>
<s> But I did read your post. </s>

<s> Not a word about wired, wifi or settings. </s>
<s> NO make, model, firmware version. </s>
<s> The forum sticky does cover the firmware issue but without the details you may only get &quot;check the forum sticky.&quot; Bob </s>

<s> I dont know if knowing my mac address is bad or not so i blacked them out </s>
<s> But this is YOUR discussion and someone jumped in the middle. </s>
<s> Looking at your settings you claim wifi is off but your screen shot shows it is ON with NO SECURITY. </s>
<s> This is not what we suggest since it will lead to troubles. </s>
<s> The firmware version is current so all that leaves us for common drops is the wifi and torrent use. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sorry..that was an old pic. </s>
<s> I just checked now and the wireless is off...I do not torrent so that can not be it. </s>
<s> Let's get rid of another issue. </s>
<s> Power and heat. </s>
<s> I've found routers and DSL modems buried under books cooking away. </s>
<s> Also we are never sure of the power so put it on some UPS. </s>
<s> The DSL modem can be the failure point which I used to loan out my old but stable modem to sniff that out. </s>
<s> Sorry about the person jumping into your discussion and me missing that you came back. </s>
<s> At this point it's something of a mystery what it is. </s>
<s> Ok. No torrents. </s>
<s> Then again we had that member the swore up and down no torrents. </s>
<s> Just Limewire. </s>
<s> Ouch, Bob </s>
<s> When the forum bottoms out like that. </s>
<s> Reply to your top post. </s>
<s> It is plugged into a power surge protector and has open air around it. </s>
<s> I have another wireless router that my friend let me test my modem with and it never timed out. </s>
<s> I tested it for 24 hours. </s>
<s> Now replace what you found to have a defect. </s>
