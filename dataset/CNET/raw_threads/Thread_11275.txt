And I want to Upgrade to the Good Stuff and I want to use my VIVO for tv as well and Recording TV wile I work. But I want to Play the new games and the power of this card is outdated Hell it barely lets me play wow at near max.

I would suggest considering a TV tuner board in addition to your new PCI Express board, instead of spending a great deal of time and money looking for a fairly proprietary motherboard design, especially as the PT880 is no longer a new chipset, which causes some problems for future upgrades. ASRock at a time produced an AMD motherboard which offered PCI Express x16 (full x16 transfers) and AGP 8x (full speed as well), based on a ULi solution, however this board is notoriously hard to find, especially now that ULi is part of nVidia. Additionally, this board was designed for Socket 939, Socket AM2 could be ammended to it through means of a proprietary add-in board, which is usually even harder to find. The setup actually work fairly well, it was just very hard to find available for purchase. I know that at one time Newegg sold the board, however I'm doubting if they still do.

I could care less about a MB with bult in Crap I wouldnt buy anyway cause Bult in meens Not upgradable. Not that you cant hook a newer tv tuner into that mb. And who knows maybe the mb will be dumb and fight the new card. All I wanted to know was plainly This Do the new Generation MB still Fight for Video Dominece between Ports. Example back int he day if you had Onboard Video and a new vid card if you didnt disable the On board the PC tried to feed bits of into to both Video sources. So you were Forced to Disable Onboard Video. BUT will 2 video cards nowadays do the same Retardation or have we leaped forward from this glitch and I dont know steped forward in PC Intelegence... Me am just want use 2 vid cards agp/tvtuner and pcie new purdy stuff can u am answer me rationaly internet world people.
