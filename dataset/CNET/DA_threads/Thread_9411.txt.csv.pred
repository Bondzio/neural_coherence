1.1.2	It use to come up ( AutoPlay ) whenever I inserted a disc .	St
1.1.3	The only way it will AutoPlay now is if I boot up the PC with a disc already in the DVD drive .	St
1.1.4	I have already tried to update the driver in Windows XP ( Home Edition ) and I even checked the Registry to see if the drive is set to AutoPlay .	St
1.1.5	The drive itself is a Pioneer DVD 16X slot drive .	St
1.1.6	My DVD drive is set to Secondary Slave , and I have a CD burner ( TDK 40X ) is set to Secondary Master .	St
