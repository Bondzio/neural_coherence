<s> Hello ,I have macBook running tiger 10.4.10. </s>
<s> Recently I've been facing some difficulties while trying to burn cd's. </s>
<s> I am thinking about buying an external dvd burner. </s>
<s> Are there any recommendations? </s>
<s> Are there any limitations i should be aware of? </s>
<s> Would i have to remove my internal drive? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance </s>
<s> Take a look at the stuff available at Macsales.com. </s>
<s> They do a good range of external (Firewire) DVD burners that are guaranteed to work with your Mac and the iLife suite. </s>
<s> Just plug it into the Firewire port and you are set to go. </s>
<s> A copy of Roxio Toast is always a good idea too. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> They offer ready to use solutions (ie. </s>
<s> works with Mac) and it's not too pricey compared to not long ago. </s>
<s> Have you tried a CD/DVD lens cleaner. </s>
<s> I get about 1/2 the trouble units to come back after that. </s>
<s> But repeat customers (those that it saved) usually on the 3rd or 4th tries the drive has truly expired and we replace it. </s>
<s> If this was my machine I'd consider getting a new internal drive since it's all too convenient plus I don't want to suffer having to reload/repair the OS from a balky drive. </s>

<s> Thanks much for the info. </s>

<s> thanks I will give the lens cleaner a shot. </s>
