<s> I am clueless about everything monitor related and live in a small community with uneducated staff in the one store that sells monitors. </s>
<s> (He didn't know what I meant by LED! </s>
<s> He's even more clueless than I am about this stuff.) </s>
<s> I need adivce. </s>
<s> I currently have a Dell flatscreen monitor that came free from Telus years ago, 19&quot;, and I would like to get a larger LED one, no specific brand at this point. </s>
<s> I am a medical transcriptionist and so spend all day typing/researching. </s>
<s> I never play games, watch movies etc on this computer, strictly for work. </s>
<s> I would like something large enough to have both my transcription platform and internet (and maybe more) displayed on the screen at once, as long as the text size would still be larger than now. </s>
<s> I have not-so-great vision and currently have my monitor pulled to the edge of my desk so I can read the reports I'm typing - some of the client templates I have to use though have such a small text size I still lean forward in my chair. </s>
<s> (Not a fan of changing resolution as I find it makes things blurry). </s>
<s> Any advice on monitor size, how text size is affected etc would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I'm fairly open on price (nothing over triple digits). </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Text size is something we can control in most Windows machines by changing the font size. </s>
<s> Some will want to avoid HIGH DPI monitors so without knowing what the old display was I can't compare its DPI to a new display. </s>
<s> But let's go with this. </s>
<s> Get something with the same or lower DPI than what you have or the text will shrink as the DPI goes up. </s>

<s> Led...this refers to the back lighting. </s>
<s> http://ledmonitors.info/ Your call if you need such a thing. </s>
<s> Multiple docs on the screen at the same time. </s>
<s> If your going to maintain the format and have print you can see......I suspect you will need a very large monitor. </s>
<s> 24 inch seems to be the biggest in off the shelf stuff......I have doubts two readable docs are going to fit on that screen.......unless you have teenage eyeballs. </s>
<s> Thanks for the information. </s>
<s> While I haven't decided on any particular monitor(s) yet, I've decided to go with 2 monitors one of them being a pivot. </s>
<s> I have a three-year-old Acer and its working fine, I reccomend this one from Newegg: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009262 Martin </s>
