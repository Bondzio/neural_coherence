<s> I went into my MacBook Pro this morning and found that I cannot get into the external drive that contains my working files. </s>
<s> It has a small lock on it, and when I go to Get Info, it tells me that every account (&quot;me&quot;, &quot;admin&quot; and &quot;everyone&quot;) has &quot;Custom&quot; permissions to get into the drive, and won't allow me to alter those permissions from the Get Info dialog window. </s>
<s> Next, I went to reboot my system to see if that would help, but all I got was the Apple symbol on startup and a spinning wheel below it. </s>
<s> After waiting about 15 minutes I reached for my trusty bootable backup disk and fired up the system again. </s>
<s> I'm currently running from my bootable backup ... slowly ... but it's two months old and I'd prefer not to clone it to my internal hard drive if I don't have to do it. </s>
<s> I may have done all this myself, but I don't know what I did if I did. </s>
<s> What can I do to unlock my external drive and gain access to all my working files again? </s>
<s> And if there's some kind of boneheaded move that I made, can you suggest what it was so I don't make the same mistake again? </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> has problems. </s>
<s> Boot from the Os X installation disk and run Disk Utility on it P </s>
<s> I did as you suggested ... disk utility got me back into my hard drive (scrambled disk permissions). </s>
<s> So that got me partway back. </s>
<s> I backed up my internal hard dist through SuperDuper, so I'm at least current on that count. </s>
<s> But I'm still locked out of my external drive. </s>
<s> Any suggestions you can offer to get that back for me? </s>
<s> Thanks again for your help ... </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Did you ever get it resolved? </s>
<s> How? </s>
<s> We've had access to the drive and have been using Time Machine -- which I think is buggy, quite honestly. </s>
<s> Maybe the drive got reformatted somehow? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for your reply, Mark Conachan, Charlotte NC </s>
