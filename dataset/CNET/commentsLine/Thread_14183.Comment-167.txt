i bought my first computer in 1982. it was a nec (yes, they made computers then).
the operating system was cpm-- which was the industry standard until dos came along and blew it out of the water.
it had 16 kb, used a 5.25 inch single-sided, single-density floppy drive, and you had to put the &quot;system disk&quot; (i.e.
the disk with the cpm operating system) into the floppy drive, and load the operating system each time you started up.
this is the origin of the error message &quot;non-system disk&quot; when you start up with a floppy disk in the floppy drive.
it covered my entire desk and cost $3000.
i wrote a billing program for it using dbase ii.
i did think that program was &quot;debased.&quot; i also had the first personal organizer, made by casio, which had 8kb.
people would stop me in the halls at work to see what it was.
i remember driving in a snowstorm to a store that had just received an add-on with 8 additional kb's.
(new yorkers: remember 47th st.
photo?)
they had seven in stock when i called, and only 2 left when i got there.
i've had a number of other interesting computers, included three i bought from japan laptop direct.
did anyone else ever buy from japan laptop direct?
