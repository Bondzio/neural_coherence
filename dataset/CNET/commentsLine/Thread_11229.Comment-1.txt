i really need help.
my computer hasn't been working right since christmas.
at random times, the computer will just restart itself.
it can be when using microsoft word, internet explorer, running a virus scan or whatever.
also, whenever i play a game, it lets me play for awhile but then it closes the game.
it doesn't even give any error.
i called futureshop to ask about this and the guy said it was a memory problem, which made sense because i got more ram for christmas.
to solve this, i brought that back and got a new 512 ram.
the problem is still happening.
i have scanned my computer with adaware se, spybot search and destroy, avg anti-virus, norton anti-virus and armor2net and haven't found any problems.
my specs are: amd athlon xp 2200+ ultra dma 80 gb hard drive kingston ddr pc3200 512mb ram 256mb ram (don't no specs-came with computer) nvidia geforce xfx video card (128mb) stock motherboard (not sure company) windows xp (with service pack 2) i have heard some people talking about doing a memetest or something for the ram but i don't know where to find it.
i have also heard about updating the bios but don't know where to find it either.
i have had this computer since summer 2003 and it was working fine up until 2 weeks ago.
i really need help, please.
