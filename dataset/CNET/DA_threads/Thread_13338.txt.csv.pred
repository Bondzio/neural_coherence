1.1.1	I 'm considering doing the switch and getting a mac laptop in the near future ( after leopard comes out , that is ) , and I was wondering if there 's any reason to get the macbook pro over the regular macbook .	St
1.1.2	I 'm going to be doing mostly regular computer tasks , like word processing , internet browsing , more than a bit of photo editing , and a lot of music playing ( not much video/audio editing that i could think of ) .	St
1.1.3	Would it be worth it to get the pro just for the discrete graphics card , processor that 's a little faster , and a 2 inch larger screen ?	Ques
1.1.4	Does it make that much of a difference , and is there anything that I 'm missing that 'd make the pro the ( much ) better choice ?	Ques
1.2.1	go for the regular MacBook .	Sug
1.2.2	It 's perfect for what you need it for .	St
1.2.3	The pro will be overkill , IMO .	St
1.2.4	As far as screen real estate , I find the MacBook 's 13.3 inches a lot roomier than I had imagined .	St
1.2.5	Why not go to an Apple store and play around to see which screen you like better ?	Sug
1.3.1	cool , thanks .	Polite
1.3.2	i 'll definitely do that .	St
1.3.3	would i need a discrete graphics card if i want to run boot camp with vista though ?	Ques
1.4.1	Firstly I do n't understand why you want to install Vista .	St
1.4.2	Why do you want to use a lesser OS when you have a superior OS .	St
1.4.3	The Macbook , *currently* has an integrated graphic card which take s aaway a bit of your Mac 's RAM .	St
1.4.4	For Vista this MIGHT work .	St
1.4.5	But I am pretty sure that for Vista premium with the Aero theme and all the fancy stuff , you will need a powerful graphic card , maybe even more powerful than the Pro 's card .	St
1.4.6	Maybe the Macbooks will get updated or maybe they wont come out at all .	St
1.4.7	If you DO need Windows , then you can install XP which is in some ways better than Vista .	St
