I just purchased a Dell 9100 and am about to set it up.
I saw a post on this board a while back from someone that had great advice for basic things to do regarding backups and other general setups for new computers.
I have searched for it but can't find it again.
Does anyone know where this can be found and point me in the right direction?
Thanks.
