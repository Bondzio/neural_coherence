1.1.1	I'm transitioning to wireless n for my home network to facilitate streaming HD video and basically speed everything up.	St
1.1.2	We still have 1 computer that runs wireless g and often have guests that may have g as well.	St
1.1.3	Is it possible to hook a cheap wireless g access point like the Belkin F5D7132 to my new wireless N router?	St
1.1.4	My understanding is that running mixed g/n from the router will degrade the overall performance.	St
1.1.5	I'm assuming that running a seperate g access point connected by ethernet will allow the router to remain 100% n but maintain g access.	St
1.2.1	This forum's sticky has that setup at about post 18.	St
1.2.2	Try that.	St
1.3.1	I understand basically how to set up the access point.	St
1.3.2	I think my question is a little more basic.	St
1.3.3	I need to maintain wireless G access in my home network but don't want to negatively impact the wireless N performance.	St
1.3.4	I'm thinking that hard-wiring a wireless g access point from my wireless N router (D-Link DIR655) will let the router run pure N instead of downgrading the speed with g trafic.	St
1.3.5	The access point will let my Wii and guests to connect with g. True?	St
1.4.1	And I rechecked the forum top sticky post.	St
1.4.2	The setup to use is at post 18.	St
1.4.3	You're very close to getting it working.	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	I don't know what's meant by &quot;the sticky at post 18&quot;.	St
1.5.2	I've hunted for quite awhile.	St
1.5.3	Please help	St
1.6.1	This is a very old post and I'll lock it after I give this link, http://forums.cnet.com/7726-7589_102-5073395.html?tag=posts;msg5073395	St
