<s> One day i decided to go off to the store and buy DVDs to burn some of my files, when i cameback home my computer was running yet there was no display no nuttin on my Monitor it was as if everything froze, the power button didnt work either. </s>
<s> So i disconnected it. </s>
<s> reconnected it and got a eeeee sound as if the computer wasnt feeling the power, like a car wanting to turn on but it wont. </s>
<s> I thought it was the PSU, i just bought one today and installed it, i connect it, and i kear the SAME eeeee sound, the sound i think comes from the PSUs ( not 100% sure but pretty certain) and I know that the SPUs is not to blame. </s>
<s> I wanted to know what could be the problem? </s>
<s> Motherboard died? </s>
<s> Or in worse case scenario, CPU died? </s>
<s> Start unpluggin items from the motherboard. </s>
<s> I try 2 at a time until I'm down to motherboard, CPU/heasink/fan, power supply and the little speaker. </s>
<s> If those last items don't beep in protest I know it's one of those. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I had a similar problem which I solved by unplugging the computer, pressing the power button, removing the silver cmos battery inside the computer then reinstalling the battery. </s>
<s> Everything then started up fine. </s>
<s> Not sure why this worked but it did. </s>
<s> My thought was to clear the cmos and start over with fresh cmos settings. </s>
<s> Is the sound a screeching sound? </s>
<s> If so, it could be the hard drive has failed. </s>
<s> Disconnect the power to the hard drive and try to start with either a boot floppy or Windows CD. </s>
<s> Just to see if you get a reaction. </s>
<s> If you can boot to a ''DOS'' prompt from either, the hard drive is fried. </s>
