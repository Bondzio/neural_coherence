<s> I have a MyBook Essential 1tb. </s>
<s> I thought I had a power surge because all of a sudden it wouldn't power up. </s>
<s> No lights, no spin and wasn't recognized by laptop. </s>
<s> So I opened it up to see if I could see any damage. </s>
<s> I checked the tvs diodes d3 and d4. </s>
<s> They were good. </s>
<s> On to the SATA power connectors. </s>
<s> got blue lights that were on and off, a very short spin and then the connectors burst out in flames. </s>
<s> Nothing hurt except the SATA connectors. </s>
<s> Can I replace only those or do I need a new pcb? </s>
<s> Can I do both of these things myself? </s>
<s> I don't know which numbers so if you need something else let me know. </s>

<s> Is up to your capabilities. </s>
<s> Sorry but this is something you know if you can or can not do. </s>
<s> Replace the connections if you can find the parts but I found new USB or SATA enclosures to be more plentiful and easy compared to replacing a connector. </s>
