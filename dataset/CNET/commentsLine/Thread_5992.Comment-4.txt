if you're like me i look for bargains now and then.
i check out the local sal.
army or goodwill shop and find a decent used major brands, old monitor but a working one.
in most cases, you can return a bad monitor back within 72hrs.
at least at goodwill.
yes, i do find 19/17/15in.
more(15) often and they do well for me to provide to the less fortunate as an overall system on the cheap minus the os.
just though i mention that as a source for used monitors as they go for $15 or less.
