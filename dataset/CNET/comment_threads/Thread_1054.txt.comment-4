R. Proffitt, all of my definitions are according to the topics on the top of this board and I tried using all the Anti Spyware and Malware software you suggested.
After running all the software in the thread you linked me to my internet connection actually got slower and my signal got weaker, after I ran it.
As for PeachBlues, like I said, any computer in the same room as this one gets a stable internet connection.
The IP problem could be a possibility, but then again, I did use Microsoft's FixIt, which should have fixed the IP problem, right?
If my IP is hard coded, like you said it can be, how do I check it and how do I change it so that any possible IP interferences can stop occuring?
Also, I'd like to note once more, I formatted my computer 2 days ago so all files are fresh new.
I've only installed MS Office, NOD and all the drivers.
Could the problem really be IP related or does it have another source?
