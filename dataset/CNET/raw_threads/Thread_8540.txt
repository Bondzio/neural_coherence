When I went to the maker's site for my video card I found quite a list of newer drivers. As I walked my way up this list and tested I found there was a peak....perf wise. Since I was not trying to fix anything......I stopped at the peak. Newest drivers and old hardware might not be the best match. I agree the monitor should be PNP.
