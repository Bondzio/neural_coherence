4531	0	274854	2648783	NR	Confusimo	12/7/07 5:21 PM	1.19704806E12	New CPU?	http://www.ewiz.com/detail.php?name=P4-631BOX looking for a new cpu. Found the above link. But they don't have any other info even over phone. I only ask cuz 631 comes in 4 flavors. SL8WJ SL94Y (B1) SL96L (C1) SL9KG (D0) But nobody seems to know or sell the D0. Is there any other way to tell which number that is since it doesn't say. Thanks, confusimo
