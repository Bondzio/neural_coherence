I haven't a clue as to what to get, the computer specs all read like tech jargon to me.
I would like to purchase a computer for my son; he's getting into web design, animation (2D and maybe 3D) and has mentioned video editing as well.
What type of computer system should I be looking at?
how much memory, what type of memory, what type of video card, processor ????
PLEASE, help!
Thank You
