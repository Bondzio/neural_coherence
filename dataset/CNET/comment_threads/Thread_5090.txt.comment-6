For me it was an extra drive I had laying around and my current IDE master drive will work in my PS2.
I've recently out grown my 4GB HDD in my PS2 so I think the 30GB IBM should keep me happy for a bit.
SATA to IDE, in my opinion less clutter and higher transfer speeds..
I truly enjoy having less clutter, but that's just me.
