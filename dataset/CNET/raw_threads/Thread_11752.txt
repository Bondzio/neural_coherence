In short... http://marketwatch-cnet.cbsi.com/Sony+to+exit+key+handheld+arenas/2100-1040_3-5223580.html Not only they exited and halted production, but they shut out programming information so PDA programmers can't offer support for the existing owners. Sony, in my book has a wide scorch mark. Bob

Tobis also has a &quot;cheap&quot; Software Pack

I've never had a problem with it. I am currently using it burn family movies to DVD and also to convert my old VHS home pictures to DVD - using the software that came pre-installed.

One month later the hard drive went. Sony Customer service proved to be an oxymoron. Will never buy another Sony product in my lifetime.

It is now July 2005 my problems began in April 2005 so we are taking about a period of 4 months!!! Problem 1: Computer will not turn on (it is less than 2 months old). They say owe well well send you a box pack it up and ship it to us. So I did. They send it back, claiming that they tested it, and I get a computer back that is missing the memory card (therefore, it will not boot at all). So I call and of course they cant just send me my memory chip they have to have me send the computer back to them again. So I do. And they send it back (supposedly testing it first) and I again get a non-working computer. So I send it back again, and they send it back again, and you guessed it, it still doesnt work. So then I get to talk to the Sr. Quality Manager, HP Executive Customer Relations Management who guarantees me that I will get a working computer. So again I send it and finally they send me a working computer. But now they had the computer as long as I did. So I continue to use the products as I have already paid for them and one of the other computers dies.it has a CPU fan that failed and will not boot up because of it. So I calland again I am told that they cant send me the part (even though I told them I could easily install a CPU fan myself). So I wait for the box, send the computer back.AND GET THE WRONG COMPUTER BACK!!!!! Then when I call I am told they have no idea where my computer is but they will have someone call me back. When they never called back I called them. They then claim my computer was at their service center the entire time (BULL) and that they havent fixed it yet (BULL) and that I need to send the computer I got back before they can send mine to me. Then the Service Manager tells me he cant guarantee my computer is coming back to meWHAT THE F***!!!! He refused to give me anything in writing stating I will even get any computer at all back!!!! Since I am doing the right thing and sending the wrong computer back I guess I can only hope and pray that I get something in returnBUT NO GUARENTEE AS THE SERVICE MANAGER told me THERE IS NO GUARENTEES IN LIFE!!!

I used mine for a whole 8 months before it needed a new hard-drive. Sony doesn't do any data rescue or anything, so I had to fight through on my own. Customer Service all but yelled at me when I called, too. It's now a year and a half later and the cd/dvd drive doesn't work and I have just had to take it in for servicing at Best Buy, where Geek Squad managed to screw things up even more. The laptop is now just a typewriter. It's a terrible, terrible product -- a complete waste of money.
