1.2.5	The second time the power supply went out .	St
1.2.6	Now my motherboard is fried .	St
1.2.7	I will have to get a new motherboard and new case and start all over again .	St
1.2.8	In your case it can be your processor out or something else .	St
1.2.9	If your have friends who know a lot about computers that would be your best bet .	St
1.2.10	For them to check it out .	St
1.3.1	My experience has been that the power supply is old , hungry and sipped from its final water hole .	St
1.3.2	You can try blowing it out with a can of compressed air .	Sug

1.3.4	Use a soft thin paint brush on the fan blades and components .	St
1.3.5	It 's worth a try .	Sug
1.3.6	But if lights are going on ( real low voltage ) and no fans are turning ... well ... Oh , replace the battery on the motherboard .	St
