use a diff keyboard just for kicks and most mobos have atleast 2 usb ports , have you tried using a diff usb port?.
a standard mouse connection is ps2... if you do have a bad keyboard you need to check and see.
try a diff keyboard.
make sure nothing extra is plugged in except the mouse and keyboard.
start with the basic's.
your computer will start with out a mouse but not the keyboard or atleast not a faulty keyboard.
try booting with just the keyboard with nothing else connected.
it should go into windows.
not having a mouse doesnt stop windows or your computer from working.
if your computer starts with just a keyboard.
then cool.
if it doesnt then you know your keyboard is faulty and may not be mouse problem at all.
if your computer starts with the keyboard then turn off and plug in the mouse.
have you reset the bios as in my other post?.
