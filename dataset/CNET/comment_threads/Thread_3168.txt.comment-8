Only in benchmarks is where you'll see it and at the same clock rate with more cache the effect is usually below 2%.
Why 2% is important is that humans can't tell the difference until about 2%.
So take time to find Tom's Hardware CPU benchmarks but after all is said and done I like to see in the nearly same CPU line more GHz and same Watts when changing the CPU out.
