i recently bought a verbatim esata & usb 2.0 1,5 tb external hardrive.the manual tells me to connect the drive to my pc when my pc is off.i connect it with the esata cable provided and i do everything right but when i turn on my pc it gets stuck for a while in the screen where it says about pressing del for setup etc and after that it tells me that it cannot boot from the drive and tells me to restart the computer.but when i connect the drive through the usb connection everything works fine.i believe that when i connect the drive in the esata the motherboard ignores my main drive and thinks that the main drive is the external one i tried to get it to boot from the main drive of my pc by pressing f8 for boot device sellecting but it only shows me the cd drive as a boot device.
thanks in advance for the help!!
