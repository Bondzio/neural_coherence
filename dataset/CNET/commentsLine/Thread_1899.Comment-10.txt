at the top of this forum is a sticky.
it should show the usual advice.
1. latest firmware or if the support folk suggest a specific version, then that version.
2. router defaults!!!
i am no longer explaining why hiding the ssid creates issues as well as never adds to security.
3. move to wpa2 aes personal security after it is working.
4. torrents?
no complaining as you know why.
5. we have more tweaks such as pushing the 802.11n router back to 802.11g only.
can help cranky routers.
-&gt; these are not &quot;real solutions&quot; but real workarounds.
