none I checked actually had the product to sell you.
Most indicated 'Out of Stock', 'Will Arrive Soon' or 'Taking Preorders'.
My advice ... let the product(s) get to the stores, read the tech reviews, read buyer reviews and then decide which components are right for your system.
I often use Newegg.com for peripherals and they're a great source for product selection, product description, buyer reviews, competitive prices, reasonable shipping and good customer service.
The link below is a great example of a new, high-priced CPU from Intel and it appears there are some peripherals to avoid.
