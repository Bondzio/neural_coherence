I upgraded from some old Yamaha speakers that I have had for ten years, but after spending 40 minutes hooking them up, they won't work. I am running Windows 7 64 bit. I have tried opening up the audio controls, turning up the volume, ect but nothing fixed it. I have all the cords hooked up right, and made sure the volume is at max.

They all show the volume is moving on the green bar. I have two sound cards listed under my Sound and Game controllers. One is VIA and the other is ATI HD audio. They are both up to date, but could me having two be the problem?
