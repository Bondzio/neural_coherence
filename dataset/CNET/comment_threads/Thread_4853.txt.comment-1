I'm runing XP home SP2.I have all windows updates installed.
AVG virus scan,MSAS,Ad-Aware SE and Spywareblaster installed.
All find nothing in a scan.My problem is the computer will just radomly reboot itself.Sometimes it reboots fine and other's it gets &quot;stuck&quot; in a constant reboot cycle.
So in one of it's reboots, I hit F8 and boot up in safe mode.So far that has worked every time.
I then shut down and reboot again and the computer boots up and works fine again for awhile.Sometimes for a day somtimes for a week.
So far I have not been able to find out why?
Don't know if it is a well hidin &quot;bug&quot; or a hardware problem?
Any idea's?
Thank's Rick
