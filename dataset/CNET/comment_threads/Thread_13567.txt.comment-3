Be sure to check the TV setup itself to direct &quot;input source&quot; as TVs are highly configurable as well.
The other half is that the laptop needs to be setup to show there is a 2nd display.
Since, its shows that then the signal source is lost at the TV side.
I suspect you use the OSD of the TV or whatever it needs, otherwise it defaults to std.
signal source, like cable, sat./or antenna, get the idea.
