When my computer's motherboard is working, I might share a folder on the network. It's shared! Either you need to tell more and be exact or we have met your specifications. Bob

We all share the motherboards that google has when executing a search. All you need is a multi-user OS and a way to connect multiple clients. An average mainframe 15 years ago shared it's processing capacity between 100'ers of simultaneous interactive users. Windows Vista doesn't really support that. Windows Server version fare much better, running things like your database (SQL Server), mail (Exchange Server) and documents (Sharepoint server). Kees

So effectively you share the processing power (motherboard) of that server. That's commonly used in businesses. But it's very uncommon for home use. Kees
