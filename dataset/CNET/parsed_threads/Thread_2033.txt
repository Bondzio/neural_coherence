<s> Not sure I am in the rigth forum. </s>
<s> I am looking for an inexpensive monitor for work. </s>
<s> I definitely want a 5:4 aspect ratio, not a wide screen. </s>
<s> I am looking at three Hanns G comparable 19 inch models. </s>
<s> The differences seem so minor that I can't make out what is significant. </s>
<s> Models are JC199APD, HH191DPB, and HX191DPB. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?q=JC199APD found your post and nothing else. </s>
<s> Is there a link to this available? </s>
<s> Sorry that I did not provide more info. </s>
<s> I am new at this. </s>
<s> The page is in the CNet review site. </s>
<s> I tried to add the link here, but o luck. </s>
<s> I just copied it. </s>

<s> I'll tell why in a moment. </s>
<s> The HannsG HH-191DPB contrast ratio pulls it ahead of the others. </s>
<s> DHCP helps too. </s>
<s> For me this model is a NO SALE since these are not the current technology of WIDE SCREEN. </s>
<s> Because of my work I must get the new displays that you see today or my software efforts would be hampered by using the older displays. </s>
<s> I'm sure you have a reason for this choice. </s>

<s> I am probably a little naive about this, but my reason for preferring a 5:4 aspect ratio to a wide screen is being able to see two documents at once one above the other, and see more of one document at a time. </s>
<s> Graphics capabilities is not my primary concern. </s>
<s> I realize everything has moved to wide screen format. </s>
<s> perharps there are some disadvantages that I don't understand. </s>
<s> I welcome your thoughts on this. </s>
<s> I picked up the swivel model as you see at http://s175.photobucket.com/albums/w146/rproffitt2000/?action=view&current=desktop2.jpg If I didn't swivel that then maybe 2 docs side by side? </s>
<s> All personal choice there. </s>
