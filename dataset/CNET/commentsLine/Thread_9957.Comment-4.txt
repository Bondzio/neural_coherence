installing 10.5 on the external is just a question of booting your imac from the 10.5 dvd and choosing the external drive as the place to install it.
to transfer files from one os to the other is straight forward.
example: you are booted into 10.4 which is on the internal hd of the imac.
the external drive appears mounted on the desktop.
(it will usually be below the internal hd) (note.
the drive you are booted from is normally the top icon on the right hand side of the screen.
all other attached drives appear below it.)
you have created a file in maya that needs to be further processed in mac xbrush.
locate the file you want to transfer to the external drive and drag it to the icon of the external drive.
do not let go, the icon of the external drive will open and reveal the contents of the drive.
continue to drag the file to the location you want it to be.
as you drag the file over a folder, the folder will open.
when you reach your destination, let go of the mouse button.
exactly the same principle applies in the opposite direction.
restart the imac and hold down the option key.
choose the external as the startup disk.
when booted, launch mac zbrush and open the file you just moved over.
question: are you sure that maya will not run on 10.5?
the 2009 version requires it but it would be worth checking to see if your version will run on 10.5 btw, the last, not the latest, version of zbrush runs on 10.4 p
