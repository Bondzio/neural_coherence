Proffitt	12/18/12 2:02 PM	1.35583932E12	Sadly a short answer is not possible.	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_QuickPath_Interconnect is likely going to do nothing but create more questions. Can you reveal why you are looking at these numbers versus performing a benchmark to compare your system? Or better yet, use your PC? Bob

Tommorow I am puting in Gigabyte Geforce GTX 660 card. Here is the rest. The nachine was built for me about 6 years ago CPU Z 64 bit tells me this is what machine is PCIe 3.0 x16 http://www.geforce.com/whats-new/articles/nvidia-geforce-gtx-650-ti GA-P35-DS3L (rev. 1.0) GTX 660 660TI Intel&#174; P35 + ICH9 Chipset 1.Supports Intel&#174; Core&#8482; 2 multi-core and 45nm processors 2.Supports DDR2 1066* memory for outstanding system performance 3.Features PCI Express x16 for outstanding graphics performance 4.Integrated SATA 3Gb/s interface 5.Features high speed Gigabit Ethernet 6.All solid capacitors design. 7.8 Channels High Definition Audio Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU Q9550 @ 2.83GHz Graphics card slot G PUZ says PCIE-E 1.1x16 @ x16 1.1 NVIDIA Quadro FX 1400 Installed in GigaByte GA-P35-DS3L (rev. 1.0) With a PCI Express x16 slot Calculation and memory speed 7.2 Desktop performance 4.7 3D graphics performance 4.4 Disk Data transfer rate 5.9 8.00 GB RAM System type 64-bit operating system Number of processor cores 4

I see you added a lot of details but what I see is the usual run of the mill Quad Core PC. These can play games with a good video card but the usual issue is the power supply. Did you make sure it will support your card? And no software will check or report this for you. The list looks like one of those HP or Dell machines. If it is, why didn't you write &quot;I have a HP d4999t&quot;? Bob

Look at the stick on the side and get the specs AND THE AGE since PSUs degrade over time. I try to keep at 50% of any RAIL as well as the total. Thanks for the APC Watt reading. You're going to do well! Bob

It looks like the 333 is probabally Frequency and maybe the 1333 is the chip set. I really don't know. I don't have the latest version of CPUZ but mine dose not show Front Side Bus so I am just wild guessing. Good luck.
