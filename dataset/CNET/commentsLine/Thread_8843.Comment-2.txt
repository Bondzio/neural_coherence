-&gt;  as to your question the answer is &quot;yes but.&quot; sadly since you have an oem version of windows vista you can't follow the normal install since you don't have the retail cd for vista.
you'll have to either pay for that cd and license or see if anyone will talk about partition magic and bootmagic.
