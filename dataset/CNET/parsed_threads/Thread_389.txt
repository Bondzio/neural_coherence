<s> I have an Acer 3810T laptop and am running Windows 7 on it. </s>
<s> The problem I've had is my WiFi has been unstable. </s>
<s> For example for 5 minutes or sometimes up to an hour I can easily find wifi networks in range of my laptop but then out of nowhere it disappears and I don't find any networks but any other WiFi device will find my router so I know it's laptop related. </s>
<s> I did some research on Google and found out this is an issue others have had with Windows 7 and it seems to be something to do with when updates are installed. </s>
<s> I followed the advice to remove my WiFi drivers and reinstall them so I downloaded a file for the Intel drivers from Acer's website. </s>
<s> I went into Control Panel and removed 2 devices that were related to WiFi. </s>
<s> I then did a scan for hardware and found one wifi device, an Intel WiFI Link 5100AGN. </s>
<s> I installed the driver for this one. </s>
<s> The problem is I know I removed two and this is the only one the scan found and I can't remember the name of the other wifi device/driver I removed. </s>
<s> Unfortunately ever since I did this my WiFi isn't working. </s>
<s> In the control panel it shows all drivers are installed and working but when I click on the bars at the bottom of my screen no wifi networks show. </s>
<s> I have tried going into the Network and Sharing Center and for example I select set up a connection or network and when I select Manually Connect to a wireless network it states &quot;An Unexpected Error Occured&quot; so I know something is missing that's allowing the WiFI to work. </s>
<s> I hope when I get it corrected it may solve the original issue I had but does anyone know how I can get this working once again? </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>
<s> Use system restore to a date when it worked? </s>
<s> As to windows updates, the only time this has bothered any machine in the office when there was some malware installed. </s>
<s> Go figure why folk think it's the updates and not the pests. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> No, I didn't try system restore to a date when it worked but I'm going to give that a try. </s>
