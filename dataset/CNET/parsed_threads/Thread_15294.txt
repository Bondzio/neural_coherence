<s> I am thinking about getting a usb modem from Verizon for my home internet. </s>
<s> I was wondering if there was a wireless router out there that could use one of these as an internet input. </s>
<s> That way me and my wife could use it at the same time. </s>
<s> Any such beast in existence? </s>
<s> Just recently I used my droid, EASYTHETHER, a Windows 7 netbook, ICS and a router to do this. </s>
<s> I must decline all the details since to do this you must be able to take the clues I offered and run with it or it's not a solution for you. </s>
<s> I bet something similar could be rigged up using your laptop and a common router but again unless you have a firm grasp on networking this is not a solution. </s>
<s> Try this. </s>
<s> Goto 3grouter.com and see if that is what you want. </s>

<s> I found out verizon sells &quot;mobile hotspots&quot; which sound like just what I want. </s>
<s> thanks for the reply! </s>
<s> A few thoughts on it. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> BEWARE the caps. </s>
<s> If you exceed you byte limits, it's very expensive. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> They do not discount the plan on this. </s>
<s> My droid costs me less per month than the wifi mobile hotspot without a cap (for now.) </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> There were some that made claims the units overheat but mine ran 24x7 and was fine for the weeks we used it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I am looking into this as a temp source of Inet for the next 6 months. </s>
<s> We are renting a house for 6 months, and pickings are slim there. </s>
<s> Sat(expensive) dial up( yea, right) or cell use. </s>
<s> Verizons 3G is really good there. </s>
<s> Since it is only 6 months I am not going with a 2 year plan, which means it will not be really be cheap either way. </s>
<s> Any other good ideas out there? </s>
<s> Ask verizon if you are in their 4g coverage area. </s>
<s> They are going live today DEC 5 with their LTE system. </s>
<s> I have used this when they were testing and it is very fast we were streaming (ie transmitting) hidef video from a moving car. </s>
<s> Work very well considering that you cannot buffer outgoing live video. </s>
<s> Have not had time to read the fine print on their contract but they implied they were going to offer a tiered plan so you could by what you need. </s>
<s> Sprint/Clear if you can get it offers a true unlimited 4G plan but in theory LTE will be faster but we will see who is telling the truth. </s>
<s> There are air card rentals like rovair. </s>
<s> But why not look at the six months and cost in breaking the contract? </s>
<s> Just pay the man for the breakup and what does that work out for the six months? </s>
<s> Here I got a discount on the droid and it costs less than the hotspot. </s>
<s> I'm keeping this one. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for all the ideas. </s>
<s> No, I will not be living in 4G land. </s>
<s> I will look into rentals, though. </s>
