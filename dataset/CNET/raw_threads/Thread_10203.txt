6151	0	302008	2816677	NR	rbaumer	7/22/08 7:38 AM	1.21671228E12	Wireless configuration and range	I'm trying to connect a small network with a larger network over a span of about 210ft. I think the device I need on the larger network is called a wireless bridge. What I don't know is what the device is called on the smaller network.. Also will I be able to establish a connection over the 210ft span? Windows OS on both. Thanks in advance for your help b
