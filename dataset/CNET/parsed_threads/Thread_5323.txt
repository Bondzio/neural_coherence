<s> Just purchased a Lexar USB 2.0 256MB JumpDrive. </s>
<s> Anyone know of a password protection program (FREE would be ok also), that can be installed on the USB JumpDrive to proctect data? </s>
<s> I want something that can be installed on the JumpDrive itself so there's no need to install a program on every computer the drive is used on, that would not be a practical option for me. </s>
<s> Instead of trying to find a program to 'lock' the JumpDrive, how about just using a small program to encrypt the data? </s>
<s> These programs, that I'm about to name, are all under 1Mb (some are Lots! </s>
<s> under) and you can place it on the JumpDrive and use it on whatever computer you need the data decrypted on. </s>
<s> All these programs, and their descriptions, I was able to find on NoNags . </s>
<s> You can also go to the authors web location for more info and the programs themselves. </s>
<s> NoNags is a very useful site to discover free, or shareware, software that will not nag you to &quot;pay up&quot; Check out http://www.nonags.com ------------------------------ TrueCrypt 2.1 for /Win2k/XP (533 kb) Homepage: http://www.truecrypt.tk/ Author: TrueCrypt Description: TrueCrypt is a free open-source on-the-fly encryption software for Windows XP/2000/2003. </s>

<s> It's small and I can use it as a keychain. </s>
<s> Walt, I already have a 128mb secure jumpdrive from Lexar. </s>
<s> I like it very much in transfering files to systems where a CD would have to be burned, etc. </s>
<s> and the keydrive is just *darn* handy. </s>
<s> -----Willy </s>
<s> Willy, Does the &quot;security&quot; feature come installed on the Lexar Secure model? </s>
<s> I don't remember seeing on Lexar's website a downloadable security application. </s>
<s> I'm wondering IF you need to reformat a Secure drive, won't that wipe out the Security Feature and you have no way to download it to put it back? </s>
