1.1.1	I 'll post what I posted in Home audio/video ( but got no advice ) .	St
1.1.2	Maybe someone here can help .	St
1.1.3	I have used an Adaptec capture card bundled with DVD and Intervideo WinDVR3 software to back up or copy TV programing from my Dish Network receiver feed , my VHS tapes , and my audio/video files on my hard drive ( the latter mostly saved by using the bundled software I list above ) .	St
1.1.4	The capture card I have has become obsolete with no support or driver/firmware updates , and using it now results in errors , freezes , crashes , poor results , and/or all of the above .	St
1.1.5	To make things simple I 'm posting the card URl so that you all can see the features , and description for both hardware and bundled software .	St
1.1.6	http : //www.adaptec.com/nr/rdonlyres/ee222298-fc96-43f4-8f5a-b16448a2fbd5/0/mediapci.pdf I have looked far and wide for a internal card or even external USB box to replace the Adaptec and bundled software but not been able to find anything that 's current , has the same features as the Adaptec , or has reasonably good customer reviews without all sorts of discouraging cons .	St
1.1.7	You all know the name brands out there and I think I 've looked at them all .	St
1.1.8	Anything I missed ?	Ques
1.1.9	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.10	I still have a lot of burning of my VHS tapes to DVD as well as TV recording to do and would like to pick up where Adaptec left me hanging .	St
1.1.11	OK , that 's it , I 'd really like to stay with a capture card like the Adaptec I document in that other forum post .	St
1.1.12	Anyone ? ? ? ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.13	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	Since this card supports Windows 2000 and XP , if your machine is on XP the only problem I encounter is the old machines usually bluescreen under the workload .	St
1.2.2	Some owners will blame the drivers or such but after fixing this too many times I rarely think about drivers or apps .	St
1.2.3	That is , unless you moved on to Vista or beyond then you have a good reason to look around .	St
1.2.4	But let me share I do not capture with such cards today .	St
1.2.5	I use a simple DVD recorder .	St
1.2.6	No PC involved .	St
1.2.7	Look up Hauppauge for today 's cards but beware I predict that your machine will likely continue to give errors .	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks R. Proffit , I do still have XP pro , ( svc pk 3 ) but I have never bluescreened under any loads using the Adaptec card , WinDVR3 and/or My DVD software ( the latter softwares having been upgraded with all available fixes before support went west ) .	St
1.3.2	The problems I had were freezing video and stoppages , which meant I had to start over , sometimes with videos or movies 2-3 hours long .	St
1.3.3	How frustrating is that ?	Ques
1.3.4	And even if I was successful after redoing , the video would be divided ( saved ) in two pieces , sometimes the second segment speed being mickey mouse .	St
1.3.5	It has been suggested to me that I should replace the software with something compatible with the Apaptec hardware card , such as Mediaportal or Sage TV .	St
1.3.6	But looking at those it would seem to be very complex if not near impossible , since I would have to virtually hack my own stuff to make it work .	St
1.3.7	As for my machine giving errors , with total physical memory of 4,096 mb , a 500 gb hd , a Intel 3005 mhz cpu and pretty gutsy other hardware otherwise it 's not prone to the glitches the usual machine suffers from .	St
1.3.8	I 've looked at Hauppauge ( and the others ) but the customer reviews are not that good , not to mention the bundled software inadequacies they all seem to have .	St
1.3.9	I do n't think I 'll ever forgive Adaptec for abandoning their card ... I do n't call that progress or improvement for a product that worked well .	St
1.3.10	I like the idea of using a DVD recorder but that wo n't save everything I want to burn ( back up ) , whereas anything I was able to save using Adaptec + software I could always edit if need be .	St
1.3.11	Thanks for the reply .	St
1.4.1	can be work with other software .	St
1.4.2	What format is it in ... mpeg2 ?	Ques
1.4.3	You do n't need adaptec to convert them to dvd .	St
1.5.1	Yes that 's correct Ahtoi , but to save ( capture ) initially to HD I DO need Adaptec or some other capture card with compatible software .	St
1.5.2	From there I use other software as you say , such as DVD Shrink , Img Burn , Ripit4me , and/or DVDFab 8 if you get my meaning .	St
1.5.3	That latter software I already have and it works well .	St
1.5.4	It 's the initial capture that 's the problem , and Adaptec no longer works well or sometimes at all to do the job .	St
1.6.1	Why replace the part that works ?	Ques
1.6.2	And yes , your post lacked details such as XP .	Res
1.6.3	The 4GB is interesting as I find some apps fail with over 1GB ram installed .	St
1.6.4	Another good reason to look at replacing apps .	St
1.6.5	The hang you describe reminds me of CODEC troubles .	St
1.6.6	If it is a codec the new software usually fails too .	St
1.6.7	Try this - & gt ; DVD FLICK .	St
1.6.8	I capture with what I have and create the dvd with that without much fuss .	St
1.6.9	Bob	St
1.7.1	So it does HANG while capturing .	St
1.7.2	Again I find this to usually be the codec issues .	St
1.7.3	Try setting the encoding during capture to something simple .	St
1.7.4	I found it to be easier to capture , edit then transcode or encode to DVD later .	St
1.7.5	Bob	St
1.8.1	why not use a dvd recorder as your capturing device .	Sug
1.9.1	R. PROFFIT WROTE : Why replace the part that works ?	Ques
1.9.2	BECAUSE BOTH THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE HAVE TO BE COMPATIBLE , WHICH I CA N'T BE CERTAIN ABOUT , WHICH IS WHY MEDIA PORTAL WAS SUGGESTED TO ME , IT HAS THE OPTION OF CODEC ADDITIONS/MANIPULATION BEING OPEN SOURCE And yes , your post lacked details such as XP .	St

1.11.1	that you can capture protected video with a computer but not a dvd recorder .	St
1.11.2	Question ; have you try capturing at a lower resolution ?	Ques
1.11.3	If it ok , then the problem is not enough computer power for the job .	St
1.12.1	Right , capturing video using software that ( automatically ) decrypts can obviously be done with a computer but not a DVD recorder , at least not at this time since the recorder does not ( can not ) use such software .	St
1.12.2	I suppose the manufactures do n't want to be sued .	St
1.12.3	As I said I think the law is a bad law mainly passed with lobby pressures so that you have to buy the same thing twice ( without an option to back up what you paid for the first time ) .	St
1.12.4	In my opinion that 's greedy , and uses the same technology in large part that produced the product that you are prohibited to use to preserve it .	St
1.12.5	In a sense that 's wanting it both ways and a purely selfish , one way street .	St
1.12.6	Was the court was bought by the the marketeers ?	Ques
1.12.7	The law should be changed !	St
1.12.8	As I mentioned to R. Proffit it 's something I might try ( capturing with & quot ; something simple & quot ; and trans-code to DVD later ) .	St
1.12.9	That 's if I ca n't find a good , equivalent capture card with appropriate bundled software .	St
1.12.10	STILL LOOKING IF ANYONE HAS SUGGESTIONS .	St
1.12.11	Thanks to R. Proffit and you for your discussions .	St
1.13.1	1 .	St
1.13.2	& quot ; BECAUSE BOTH THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE HAVE TO BE COMPATIBLE & quot ; This is untrue if we think about capture and content creation .	St
1.13.3	Only the capture software needs to work .	St
1.13.4	More about CODECS .	St
1.13.5	2 .	St
1.13.6	About codecs .	St
1.13.7	I will not duplicate all there is to know about codecs here .	St
1.13.8	If I did then my post would not fit ( and it would duplicate the web ! )	St
1.13.9	So let 's get down to the basics .	St
1.13.10	Many folk try to capture and encode to some encoding at the same time .	Sug
1.13.11	This is done in Windows by selecting the desired codec .	St
1.13.12	Since this will be used by the new system you hope will fix your problems my bet is that it will still hang .	St
1.13.13	You can look up CODEC SNIPER and check if you can uninstall CODECS and then try different codecs .	St
1.13.14	You write you are no hacker but when it comes to this issue you find you have to catch up .	St
