i dug my hp laserjet 4 plus out of the closet the other day, and hooked it up to see if it would work.
after dusting it off, i hit the magic button, and it turned on.
it warmed up and went to the &quot;ready&quot; screen.
then, i noticed a burning smell coming from the fan on top.
i immediately turned it off and unplugged it.
is there any idea what this could be caused by?
