It has the built onto mother board sound (AC 97) with Realtek drivers. It sounds ok, but I have wondered if I would notice any real inprovement with installing a seperate sound card, or would that just be more money for negligible improvement? Thanks! Wayne

What I found was that it did have less hiss and noise but I had to connect it to a rather big speaker set to notice it. On the headphones I could barely tell. NOW THERE IS ONE AREA THAT WAS REALLY BETTER. This was the audio capture. That was definitely many steps up. Hope this helps, Bob
