<s> Hello There: I'm running a Dell Dimension 2400 with XP Home Edition. </s>
<s> The box is about two years old. </s>
<s> The first problem I had with it about six months ago was that the CD drive burned out. </s>
<s> A few days ago I was viewing CNN's web page when suddenly the screen stretched sideways (horizontal plane). </s>
<s> I used the digital screen controls to bring it back to size, but the icons on the left and right margins are smaller and narrower.Distortion persists in these areas. </s>
<s> I've reformatted C, loaded up all my programs again, including the drivers, controllers, etc., but the problem persists. </s>
<s> I need heeeeeeeeeeeelp! </s>
<s> My thanks to those of you who wrote in about my jumpy cursor. </s>
<s> I took your advice. </s>
<s> The cure was simple: a new mouse. </s>
<s> Thanks again, Norman De Sola </s>
<s> Go to display properties settings and check to make sure you are using a correct resolution. </s>
