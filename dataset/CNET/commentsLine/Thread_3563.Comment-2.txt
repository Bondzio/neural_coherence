it's a nice system.
it will run windows 7 x64 just fine.
however, what do you use your pc for?
you called out the graphics card, so i'm guessing you are a gamer or like to watch videos or both.
the one thing that stood out to me was the hard drive.
seems pretty small, but if you don't need to store a ton of music, photos, or videos, than it's probably fine.
i wouldn't worry about going to 8gb ram right away, but if you think you will want to do that, i would instead recommend going with the fastest ram your mobo supports and make sure you get the largest memory sticks for each socket.
even if that means you get only 4gb of ram to start.
that way, if you want to upgrade later to more memory, you won't have to throw out any old sticks to make room for newer ones.
good luck and let us know how you like your new setup.
