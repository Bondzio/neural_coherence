1.1.1	ok, so i am trying to figure out whether to set my internet connection through my linksys router as &quot;keep alive&quot; or &quot;connect on demand&quot;.	St
1.1.2	I had it on connect on demand but during an online game it kept thinking the connection was idle, so it would disconnect messing up the game.	St
1.1.3	So I set it up on keep alive, well it would keep the connection, but everytime it wasnt used for a few hours it would disconnect and I have to go into router settings and reconnect manually.	St
1.1.4	What should I do?	Sug
1.2.1	What model router?	St
1.2.2	Try downloading the latest firmware.	St
1.2.3	It sounds like your router software sucks.	St
1.2.4	Dial on Demand is pretty self explanatory.	St
1.2.5	Any packet destined for the internet constitutes &quot;demand&quot;.	St
1.2.6	There should also be some &quot;Idle Timer&quot; settings that are used to disconnect the router after some time of no traffic.	St
1.2.7	Setting these to 0 usually means never hang-up.	St
1.2.8	Some ISPs automatically disconnect you after many hours to prevent you from setting up a Mail or FTP server.	St
1.2.9	You might try rebooting the router before a really long gaming session to get a fresh login and restart the ISPs timer, if you think it is your ISP screwing with you.	Sug
1.2.10	Check you IP address on the router once a day and see if it is changing.	St
1.2.11	SKrall	St
1.3.1	Thats the model number.	St
1.3.2	It is currently running firmware version 1.00.6.	St
1.3.3	When going to the linksys site they have 5-6 different &quot;versions&quot; of my router.	St
1.3.4	How do I know which version I have?	Ques
1.3.5	I tried putting a 0 in under the idle time, but must be greater than 1.	St
1.3.6	I am thinking the losing of the connection must be someting to with the internet because the wireless signal usually remains at a constant 54 Mbps without dropping.	St
1.4.1	Look on the bottom of your router to get the version #	St
1.5.1	Ok, so i got the version number and downloaded the latest firmware.	St
1.5.2	So we shall see what happens.	St
1.5.3	Thanks for your help, guys.	St
1.6.1	so I downloaded the latest firmware and put the setting on keep alive.	St
1.6.2	It is still dropping the connection, sometimes.	St
1.6.3	I even set my laptop up using an ethernet cable, to see if it was wireless signal interference.	St
1.6.4	So that can't be the case.	St
