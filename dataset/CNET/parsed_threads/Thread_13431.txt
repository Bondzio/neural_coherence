<s> Did you get it just by reading? </s>
<s> No formal training? </s>
<s> If you want to learn about networking then I recommend these books. </s>
<s> TCP/IP Illustrated Volume 1, Richard Stevens Interconnections: Bridges, Routers, Switches, and Internetworking Protocols, Radia Perlman These 2 books used to be reference materiels for the router support teams at BayNetworks/Wellfleet and 3Com. </s>
<s> They discuss standards based routing. </s>
<s> Cisco Certification teaches you to build networks the Cisco way. </s>
<s> This usually means proprietary protocols instead of standards because they want to lock their customers in and keep them from looking at competing products. </s>
<s> Key concepts to learn in the beginning. </s>
<s> DHCP ARP DNS How switches build a database. </s>
<s> How switches forward packets. </s>
<s> VLANs RIP and RIP version 2 How packets are passed through a router. </s>
<s> How routers modify packets as they pass through. </s>
<s> For WAN technologies... PPP PPPoE (Used with DSL) Frame Relay DLINK has some great products for cheap prices. </s>
<s> The DES-3326SRM is an ethernet switch that can also route. </s>
<s> You can buy one for about $400. </s>
<s> Much cheaper than a UC Berkeley extension course. </s>
<s> And you can sell the switch on EBay when you are done with it. </s>
<s> Or buy a Cisco 800 and make the two work together and get some hands on with Cisco IOS. </s>
<s> Cisco gear is traditionally very expensive. </s>

<s> degree. </s>
<s> My first question is why you want the CCNA? </s>
<s> Is your employer wanting you to get it? </s>
<s> There are other certifications out there, which will cover networking technologies, and are not CISCO specific as the other post pointed out. </s>
<s> I think it would be POSSIBLE to get certified from reading books alone, if you already have a strong background. </s>
<s> But there is no substitute for hands on experience using the equipment. </s>
<s> If you are planning to use your CCNA out in the field I think you would be better off getting some formal training. </s>
<s> All the book reading in the world will not prepare you when things happen that are not covered in the book so to speak. </s>
<s> If you are just looking to increase your networking knowledge, and not work with CISCO equipment specifically, I would probably follow the advice of the other post. </s>
<s> Good luck with whatever decision you make. </s>
