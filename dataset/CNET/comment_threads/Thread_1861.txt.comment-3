When I started to install the software on the laptop, it asks how I am connecting the printer.
The options are USB and LAN.
I'm assuming if I go with option 1 that you suggested, I would use USB, but would that allow me to print wirelessly from the laptop.
Is it necessary to set up both computers on a network?
Thanks
