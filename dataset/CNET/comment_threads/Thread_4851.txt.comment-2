The router needs to be plugged into the modem first.
Plug its WAN port into the modems Ethernet port.
Shut down and restart the modem so it will connect to it.
The router has 4 LAN ports + wireless capability.
You'll share files through these connections and all the internet &quot;sharing&quot; will be done through the router as well.
Setting up file sharing is another topic but you've got to get the wiring correct first.
