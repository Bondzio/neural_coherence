<s> Hiya, I have a 60Gb harddrive set on D:\ that I had thought was overheating. </s>
<s> I narrowed it down because i tried some overly extensive programs, on my other drives. </s>
<s> Nothing. </s>
<s> All good, on my D drive my computer completely froze when i tried anything, then it took two reboots to get back up. </s>
<s> Also I am hearing some whirring then a sound of brakes screaming or an engine build up then CLUNK CLUNK. </s>
<s> Now it's dead silent but still recognized and files are readable albeit anything run freezes my computer on D drive. </s>
<s> I'm pretty much certain it's a soon to be dead drive. </s>
<s> I've restored everything i can from it, but i just wanted your thoughts? </s>
<s> Dead Drive, overheating? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> If yes...try the HDD mfgs DIAGs....download and run their diagnostic SW. VAPCMD </s>
<s> I have tried the tool, and computer rebooted again. </s>
<s> I ripped and encoded one of my dvd's on another drive, no problems, encoded, again no problems, but a simple cut and paste of a file originating on my D:\ drive to another disk produced another hard reboot. </s>
<s> Played a game originating on another drive, again no problems. </s>
<s> so i do think the HD is shot. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> NIL </s>
