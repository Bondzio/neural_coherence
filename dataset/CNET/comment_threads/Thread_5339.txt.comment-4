If you have a laptop that is going through the router then adding/putting the printer on a wireless print server both machines will be able to use it also.
The server you get will have either a USB port or parallel port or possibly both.
Then the hardwire machine does not have to be on if the laptop wanted to print something, Per the setup you stated in the original posting.
