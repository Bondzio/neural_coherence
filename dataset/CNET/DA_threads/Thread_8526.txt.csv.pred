1.2.2	The ACER is the atypical XP netbook that has no redeeming features.	St
1.2.3	With the intel GMA you find it can't play video full screen and well, why this unit is attractive must be on price alone.	St

1.7.1	I think you are severely price constrained and the cheapest laptop I would ever consider is the 299 or 399 Dell.	St
1.7.2	At that price you will be making sacrifices.	St
