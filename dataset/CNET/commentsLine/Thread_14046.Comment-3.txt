man you will need an upgrade.
bf2 is one of the most demanding pc games on your graphics card and also ram.
(i have the game) well for ati, at least a 9600 or 9800 pro.
nvidia, the requirements are steep, ea recomends at least a 5700 or greater so i would go at least a 6600gt or 6800 you might have to upgrade your power supply if you choose the 6800  thats the 6800  6600gt  9800 pro those are all great cards.
