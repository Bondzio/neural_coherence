<s> I've got a Lexmark X83 all in one. </s>
<s> The printer is having problems printing black. </s>
<s> The text has turned to lines and broken letters. </s>
<s> It frequently does not print at all but feeds the paper through at the same rate as if printing. </s>
<s> Its a bit like the ink is not reaching the page at all. </s>
<s> Any ideas how to cure this? </s>

<s> Fairly common it you refilled a lexmark cartridge. </s>
<s> Try the usual print head alignment and cleaning and installng a new cartridge usually works. </s>
<s> Also could be dried ink, air bubble in cartridge or cartridge became dried out before filling </s>
