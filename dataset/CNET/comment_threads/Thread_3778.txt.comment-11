I get the lack of documentation or walk through for troubleshooting the silicon image raid controller.
But in terms of a two chip board both controllers have their separate sata connections so they aren't mixed.
I am only using the silicon image connections and controller.
Are you saying that the intel controller is somehow messing up the silicon image controller?
