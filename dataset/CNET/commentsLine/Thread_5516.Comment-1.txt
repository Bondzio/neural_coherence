hello!
i recently bought a toshiba libretto 100ct operating on windows 98se, and included with it was an external floppy drive (pcmcia connecter).
after i plug it in and try and open up a floppy from [my computer; drive a:], it says &quot;a:/ is not accessible, the device is not ready&quot;.
now, after a little research i found out that there is no driver installed so the only way to get files off the floppy is to do a file copy from ms-dos mode.
it tells me to switch in msdos mode to a: , but when i do this it cannot read drive a: ... for this reason, i do not believe that this external floppy drive is considered as drive a: , but do not know what a pcmcia card command is and how to move files from the floppy to the computer itself.
thanks
