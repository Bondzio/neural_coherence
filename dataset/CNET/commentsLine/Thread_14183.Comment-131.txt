ohhhhhhhhhhh forgot them ... tape drives... still have an amiga 500 with dual drives somewhere in the garage lol.
i come across the alignment tape for one of those tape drives and wondered what to do with it now ... then again maybe i finally threw it ... it was my job to ajust the drives ... lol i worked in a computer shop then... too many years ago.lol
