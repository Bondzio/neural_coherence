hi everyone, i would really appreciate it if someone could help me with this problem.
i have a desktop hp vista computer 2007. it has always worked wonderfully.
but, all of a sudden, lately, my keyboard just stops working.
i'll be on facebook or surfing on google and the keyboard stops working.
i can't type or do anything.
i thought that it might just be an on online thing so i went into notepad or even in the search area of the start button and still i can't type anything.
after shutting down my computer for a few hours, the keyboard starting working again.
today, i was told by a few people to just smash the keyboard on the table.
low and behold that worked.
that's why i can type right now!!!!
but, who knows how long this will last.
do i need a new keyboard or is this more of an interior computer problem????
i would really appreciate anything suggestions that anyone would have.
thanks again for all your help.
it's greatly appreciated!!!
