A little while ago, I was advised that I could use NTFS-3G coupled with MacFUSE in order to backup a MacBook to an NTFS formatted external hard drive.
Looks like this may be necessary, b/c my wife's MacBook is having serious issues (has become ridiculously slow - don't know why).
If I do this, and then get the machine repaired in a way that wipes her internal hard drive clean, should we be able to restore her machine from the NTFS-formatted external drive?
I assume that I'll have to re-install NTFS-3G and MacFuse before doing so, but after that, should I be able to restore the MacBook?
