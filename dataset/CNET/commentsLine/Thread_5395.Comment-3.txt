you need to visit that machine and have it share the printer.
you will need to install the printer on the other machine and point it to the shared printer.
you might be able to do this through the network.
you will also need to make sure you have permission to use it.
have you done these things?
wired or wireless shouldn't make a difference with a shared printer as long as you can access the pc that hosts it.
