1.1.2	It has happened both with Vista 64-bit, and now with Windows 7 64-bit.	St
1.1.3	Originally I thought it was a problem with my graphics cards, so I had the company send me 2 new ones...this did not solve the problem.	St
1.1.4	The reason I thought my cards were the problem, was because it was locking up more during games/video streaming.	St

1.1.6	I am out of ideas as to what this could be...Possibly overheating?	St
1.1.7	Possible power problem?	St
1.1.8	Sometimes it doesnt lock for a few days, then some days it locks every few minutes.	St
1.1.9	Have to reboot the PC everytime it happens.	St
1.1.10	Any ideas/info would be greatly appreciated.	St
