<s> My old HP desk top Hard Drive crashed long ago (2008?). </s>
<s> I had a tech come to the house to repair and replaced the hard drive. </s>
<s> Per my request , he had also opened up the HDD so i could see what the actual disk looked like inside. </s>
<s> I removed the disk from its casing and stored it away (avoiding any static damage). </s>
<s> Since i no longer have its original casing and components , is it still POSSIBLE to have any info/data recovered? </s>
<s> Ive heard recently that it is NOT possible. </s>
<s> Please let me know,,No point in still holding onto it if that is the case..Thanks </s>
<s> Once you've opened the hard drive, it can't be read by ordinary means, but there are companies that will recover the data for a price. </s>
<s> I've never had need for that because I always back my data up, but I've read that these services cost in the $1000 to $2000 range. </s>
<s> For most folks it's not worth it. </s>
<s> Since it's been 5 years for you, I'd be surprised if it were worth it to you. </s>
<s> But if it is, go for it! </s>
<s> You've removed any possible chance that an user could recover any data, excluding some weird geek type. </s>
<s> The only practical option is to have some &quot;data recovery service&quot; where you send away the discs to try to do this. </s>
<s> Of course those services costs tend to be expensive, so you decide if the data is worth it. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I just may throw it out in the trash after-all. </s>
<s> Thats too bad..:( </s>
