14699	0	261849	2571202	NR	mazeraine	8/26/07 11:39 PM	1.18817154E12	Concern with the ACER E380	I just recently got an ACER Aspire E380, and I noticed that the sytem makes a clicking noise almost as loud as an old type-writer. I was wondering if anyone knew whether this is a system flaw or does there happen to be a setting to turn it off. I'm more of a power user, but never encountered this type of issue before. Any and all help would be awesome. Thanks.
