This mobo has two raid controllers on it.
A 0 raid Intel controller and a 0+1 Silicon Image controller.
The Silicon Image controller uses a program called SataRaid to manage its disks and arrays.
Its that program that I can't get to recognize the new disk.
I appreciate the interest you are showing.
I welcome any feedback.
