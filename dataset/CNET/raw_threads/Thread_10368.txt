Anyone seen this or have a clue on what to do next?

Install the ram just the same way you had in the test system. If the problem persists then you got a bad mtrbd. or possibility bad psu. The odd chance you have a bad ram slot is also possible, maybe broken or bent seats, inspect well. The blinking LEDs are suppose to a clue to the error/problem, what does Dell supply? tada -----Willy
