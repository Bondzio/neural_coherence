<s> I recently built a new system using the subject mobo with 8GB of PC6400 Crucial RAM (matched sets). </s>
<s> When I loaded Win 7RC 64 bit it got to the &quot;starting windows&quot; screen and hung. </s>
<s> After several attempted fixes I removed 1 of the 2GB sticks and all worked great. </s>
<s> Thinking it might be a need a BIOS update (even tho all 8GB showed when installed) I downloaded the latest version and installed it and a window said all worked. </s>
<s> However, the BIOS still shows the prior version. </s>
<s> Tried it twice with same results. </s>
<s> This is not a huge problem as 6GB is certainly adequate for my needs but I guess I'm stuborn. </s>
<s> I want all 8 !!! </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> TIA </s>

<s> compared the downloaded bios version with the original bios version you had on the mobo before flashing it? </s>
<s> As you have mentioned that despite flashing it, the version still remains, thus, that bios version has not included the update YET of maximising the whole 8GB capability, but rather the full 4 slots with at most 6-7GB currently, with future updates taking advantage of 4x2GB ram. </s>
<s> But hang in there, for which once windows 7 comes in, new bios will be available for your full 8GB. </s>
