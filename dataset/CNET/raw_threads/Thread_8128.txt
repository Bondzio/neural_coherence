Check the specs of both your PC and the videocard to see if there's a match. Also, this being an OLD machine, check if can handle 2 Gb RAM, a 320 Gb hard disk, and if the CPU is fast enough to handle the games you want. Hope this helps. Kees

This unit has a 250 WATT PSU and no AGP or PCIe slots. Not only does it not have a slot for the AGP or newer PCIe card but the power supply isn't up to the task. -&gt; Sorry. No. Bob

A new motherboard could mean new RAM, new power supply and a new LICENSE to the OS since it's usually locked to the old hardware. Bob

Your better off building or buying a new system. -as a side note you can build your own system with specs (including the parts you used) for about $800. Something to consider.

Your system doesn't have a PCIe slot. Anyone that has a decent price on the 8800GT doesn't have 'em in stock. As others have indicated...you're better off getting a new box with the desired peripherals and the video card you want. To keep your cost down you could also look at the new ATI 3800 series ... they are available from the $175 to the $220 (and more for some vendors) VAPCMD

4626	9	272315	2632706	2632633	VAPCMD	11/18/07 6:10 PM	1.1954094E12	Your system doesn't take PCIe or AGP	Your Dell System has 'built-in or what some call onboard graphics&quot;. Systems using onboard graphics use regular system memory for video RAM. So if your system has 256MBs system RAM ....and if your onboard video system was using 64MBs RAM...your usable system memory would be reduced to 192MBs RAM. Your Dell Dimension 3000 has 3 expansion slots for peripherals but they're not PCIe (the latest and greatest) and not AGP (the previous generation latest and greatest) it has PCI. So the only video card you could buy and add to your current system would have to be PCI. That's the only interface option your system has for adding peripherals like graphics cards. Given the limitations a PCI video card places on gaming performance you're better off selling the existing system and putting your $$ into a system designed for gaming. VAPCMD

May I suggest you reconsider and add a few more dollars to the $400 upgrade estimate and get something more powerful and new. The Celeron processor that comes with the Dimension 3000 is not a gaming processor, even if you can put the graphics card you want in it. That processor is barely good enough to multi task regular office applications. Look at TigerDirect.com Go to motherboard / CPU combos link. Sort by price. They have a great motherboard with a GE Force 8400 video card for around $100 after rebate. Add a dual-core cpu, cpu fan, and 2 gig of high speed RAM ($29 after rebate) and you've spent barely $400 (without shipping), which gives you room to ad a nice hard drive. Good luck.
