thank you for responding!
i checked that link you provided and found that the memory is still 2.8v, regardless of being pc3200.
i did read on the site that the memories are backward-compatible, meaning they all will adjust themselves out.
i'm curious on why are both the 3200 and 4000 have the same 2.8v power?
since you said to be caution about getting the 4000, i went one level down and it is 3200. crucial recommend this...  512mb, ballistix 184-pin dimm, ddr pc3200 memory module the link you provided looks to be a fit for my computer.
i just want to be clear on some things.
thanks!
