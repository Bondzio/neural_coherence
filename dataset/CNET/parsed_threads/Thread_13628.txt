<s> I got a new computer. </s>
<s> And I want to get opins what to do with the old one. </s>
<s> Specs: HD = 80 gig Win Xp home edition AMD Athlon 64 processor speed 2160 Mhz Installed mem = 1 gig Model HP a1330e I have it up for sale for $125 but getting practically no replies. </s>
<s> So I'm thinking of dismantling it and selling off the parts. </s>
<s> However, I don't know how to wipe the hard drive clean. </s>
<s> Totally clean. </s>
<s> Step by step instructions thanks. </s>
<s> Do you think it's better to dismantle and sell parts? </s>
<s> I saw an all too similar machine on Freecycle (a place where things are freely recycled) albeit with 512MB RAM and a 40GB drive. </s>
<s> So your price might be above the impulse level. </s>
<s> Try 99 bucks. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'll reduce the price and see what happens, but ultimately I'll prob. </s>
<s> sell the parts. </s>
<s> If you want to be done with it, sell it for $50-75 to include the s/w bundle that came with it, to include the restore/recovery CDs if so supplied. </s>
<s> Because, once you've reformatted or wipe the HD clean 100% you will be cleaning out also the &quot;hidden partition&quot; of the HD supplied recovery/restore process. </s>
<s> In such cases the extra cost of getting the CDs if needed will go against you if the buyer needs them. </s>
<s> Your system or similar is very common, so don't be too high on sale price and remember its old stuff. </s>
<s> Understand a brand new system of entry offerings to include laptops are in the $300+ range on sale or not. </s>
<s> To wipe clean the HD of any install entirely use DBAN or KILLDISK, google for them. </s>
<s> Of course, save any critical data you deem important. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> The sad fact is that these older machines aren't really worth anything, either intact or as parts. </s>
<s> You might sell the hard drive and the memory but not much else. </s>
<s> However, there are charities that can use them, assuming they are fully working. </s>
<s> Here in the UK, there is an organization called ComputerAid that will take an older system, check it out and recycle it to under-privileged children in the third world. </s>
<s> I guess you can probably find such an organization where you live. </s>
<s> While you should wipe your hard disk (I think Partition Wizard - find it on the web - will do it for you but there are many such cleaners available fro free) if you find the right recycler, they will also ensure the HDD is clean. </s>
<s> They take all kinds of information about your equipment (or software, or whatever you'll be contributing), including the age, what shape the stuff is in and so on. </s>
<s> Then, if any organization is interested, they'll notify you that someone is interested, and an exchange can be made. </s>
<s> I seem to remember that you even can say that the people need to pick the thing(s) up, but you also can arrange to send it. </s>
<s> I don't think that they will do repairs, though those who receive the donation may be willing to do so if the donation is salvageable. </s>
<s> NCF also gives you a figure for the tax deduction, and the donee will give you a receipt. </s>
<s> There is much online about charitable giving of computers and such. </s>
<s> Check it out, if National Cristina Foundation doesn't work for you. </s>
<s> There may also be nonprofits in your area that need what you have to offer. </s>
<s> In any case you'll get a tax deduction and get the stuff out of your house. </s>
<s> Give away to local school or maybe neighbor, I gave a similar older computer to my stepdaughter and another to a neighbor who had school-age kids yet couldn't afford to buy a computer. </s>
<s> Both partys were very happy, since they just wanted to get on the Internet and do homework. </s>
<s> I might have gotten $25-$50 out of the computers but neither had that much and I was happy to keep them out of the landfill. </s>
<s> To make HD data unrecoverable, first delete it. </s>
<s> Then over-write where it was (and where rit can be recovered from) by filling the free space with garbage files. </s>
<s> Fill a folder with pictures, for instance, then makes endless copies of the folder until the HD runs out of space. </s>
<s> This'll make the data unrecoverable to anyone other than the CIA. </s>
<s> Can someone tell me if I can un-track this message thread? </s>
<s> I suggest selling your bulk leftover memory to www.smsassembly.com/buymem.php . </s>
<s> They gave me a fare price on the ram I had just sitting in my drawer. </s>
<s> I heard they also buy used processors and server hardware. </s>
<s> Definitely worth a look </s>
