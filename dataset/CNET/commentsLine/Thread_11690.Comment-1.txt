this is what i have: trendnet tew-452brp wireless router version b1.1r attached to optimum online modem(service provider).
i have a dell desktops wired (router is attached to the dell desktop), a dell laptop wired, an acer netbook wireless- all with xp.
i also have an imac wired, and a compaq laptop wireless w/vista.
all have no connection issues.
what i want to do: i just got a compaq dc7100sff desktop with xp and it has a wire connection for internet but i would like to use it downstairs with a wireless card.
i called trendnet to ask what pci adapter to get for the tew-452brp router and they said to get the tew-423pi 54mbps wirelessg pci adapter.
i went to neweggs website and they have it for $21.00.
but, the reviews were not that good.
so, my question is should i get it or does anyone know of or could suggest a better adapter in the same price range?
i dont know how important it is the have the adapter match the router, or if it is even important at all.
i use the wireless vista laptop in the same room i want to set up the desktop and have no connection issue with it even though it is the room farthest from the router.
when i looked at the manual online for the dc7100sff it said there are 2-standard pci expansion slots, 1-pci express x1 slot and 1-pci express x16 slot.
(have no idea what that means).
assume i would be using the standard pci slot?
any advice or help would be greatly appreciated.
