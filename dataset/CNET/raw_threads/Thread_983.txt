So, I started all over and install win 98 which said that it formated my hard drive. Win 98 seemed to load successfully, but when I try to upgrade to winxp I get the message during setup, &quot;An unexpected error (0)occurred at line 1768 in d:\xpclient\base\boot\setup\arcdisp.c.&quot; I thoought I might have done something to the hard drive so I took it out and put it in an older working computer that I have and I now get &quot;NTLDR is missing&quot; message when I power up the computer before anything is loaded

Your install method appears somewhat convoluted. If you are using an upgrade version of XP there is no need to have a Windows version on the machine first. Simply boot the XP cd partition and format as needed and when asked for the previous version of Windows pop in the 98 cd.
