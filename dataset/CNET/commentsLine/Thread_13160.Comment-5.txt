got it for him for christmas 2009. at staples, it was 119.99 ($80 dollars off of 199) we really like it.
it has the color cartridges.
i even bought an extra paper tray for it so i can keep regular size paper in one and the 11x17 ledger paper in the other.
very easy to switch, pull one out and slide the other in.
it's accross the room from my desktop computer.
i bought a real long usb cord and just plug it into my computer if i want to print to it.
but usually my husband plugs his laptop into it.
my laser is a brother hl-2140.
