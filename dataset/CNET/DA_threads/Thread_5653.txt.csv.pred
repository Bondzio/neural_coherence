1.1.1	How do I format a SD memory card ( Erase all data ) that keeps giving me a & quot ; write protected & quot ; Message .	St
1.1.2	This was a blank card to start with onto which I installed maps while in a Garmin GPS ( Not me , the card . ) .	St
1.1.3	I would like to change the configuration .	St
1.1.4	I 've erased memory sticks before with no problems .	St
1.1.5	In other words I need to defeat the write protection .	St
1.2.1	http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital_card # Optional_write-protect_tab & quot ; There is , however , a less well-known fact : the tab is implemented only as mechanical part ( detected by a contact switch inside the SD Card socket ) so that the device can write to the write protected SD card if its firmware decides to ignore the tab or if the switch is broken .	St
1.2.2	Many users reported data loss when the switch was worn down or broken especially on early sockets where manufacturing process was not perfected or due to firmware bugs .	St
1.2.3	Some devices also allow users to ignore write protect switch for user 's comfort. & quot ; I do n't have your card to examine but it shows that write protection is not in the card but a function of the host device .	St
1.2.4	So this leads us to try another host device or replace the card to see if the card has failed .	St
1.2.5	I wo n't look into your user manual to see if your device can format a card .	St
1.2.6	I leave that to you .	St
