I have a cable modem from my ISP. I previously had a Linksys 2.4GHz wireless access point router connected to the cable modem and all 3 laptops were able to connect to that wireless signal. The strength was mediocre and transmission speeds were awful. The linksys router was over 5 years old and just died this morning. I believe all laptops are running XP. Can you please recommend the best wireless router for: -home use -strong signal strength (would like the signal to reach the 4 rooms that surround the office where the router is located... walls are drywall only) -ease of use -reliability -fast, fast, fast Also, I want to setup my laserjet on a wireless at the same time. Can you recommend what I need to accomplish this? I know just enough to get by so please try and keep explanations simple. I'm not very literate on networks! THANK YOU EVERYONE!!

Signal strength is affected by walls, naturally. But the angle at which the signal hits the wall can be decieving. A sheetrock wall is around 4&quot; thick. But if the wall is at an angle to the router, the thickness can be several feet. All routers transmitted power are the same and regulated by the FCC.

The good old WRT-54G will do wonders for a cheap price. If you however need storage and the other cool stuff such as higher encryption, you may want to check out other lines
