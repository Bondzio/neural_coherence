1.1.1	am getting broad-band access in my home mainly for general email and streaming video usage .	St
1.1.2	I was thinking of just buying a modem and wireless router rather than renting either one ( $ 2/mth ) or both ( $ 5/mth ) .	St
1.1.3	I have a computer that is a few years old , so everyone has told me that most likely I have a & quot ; G & quot ; card , but I am not sure ( Dell Inspiron 600m ) .	St
1.1.4	So , then should I just get a G router , or is it worth it to get a N one , in case I ever want to upgrade my card ?	Ques
1.1.5	Right now , my wireless range would only have to be 100 feet or so .	St
1.1.6	How are the Blinkin routers ( recommended by Comcast and only $ 60 ) ?	Ques
1.1.7	Does the brand matter all that much ?	Ques
1.1.8	Also , I was thinking of getting a modem .	St
1.1.9	Staples offers some ( Zoom , Linksys ) compatible with Comcast , but they are all DOCSIS 2.0 .	St
1.1.10	I heard that Comcast might upgrade to DOCSIS 3.0 in the next year .	St
1.1.11	In which case , will my modem become obsolete and I will have wasted my money ?	Ques
1.1.12	Basically , I am trying to decide whether it is worth it to rent or buy ( and if so , what equipment and will it become obsolete very quickly ... ... .. ) .	St
1.1.13	Thank you .	St
1.2.1	You 'll pay $ 100 to $ 120 for a midrange , home use router and modem so you start saving by buying your own after a couple of years .	St
1.2.2	However , if your rented device fails , they replace it .	St
1.2.3	If your owned device fails , you get to do that .	St
1.2.4	Personally , I 'd split the ownership .	St
1.2.5	Let your ISP provide the modem .	St
1.2.6	It 's going to be MAC address linked , most likely to their system and they 'll set it up for you .	St
1.2.7	Buy your own router .	St
1.2.8	Go with a good brand .	St
1.2.9	I 've always liked 3Com and US Robotics but others prefer Linksys , Dlink , etc .	St
1.2.10	Read some reviews and posts here about these brands .	St
1.2.11	You can easily enough replace your router as your needs change but let your ISP handle the modem .	St
1.2.12	My two cents .	St
1.2.13	Good luck .	Polite
