- i've heard antec performance cases (for ex.
the sx630ii) are good because they have built in filters to catch all the dust and it never gets in ur machine.
idk if you already have a case or not.
- make sure you have a couple fans since that is gonna generate alot of heat.
- that is an excessive amount of ram unless youre using your computer as a server.
nothing wrong with it but it would save you alot of money to drop to one 6gb stick.
4gb is sufficient for almost all games right now.
- i prefer western digital hard drives for myself.
if ur looking for speed maybe check out one at 10000rpm's instead of 7200 - and hopefully youll be using windows 7 on a machine like that.
