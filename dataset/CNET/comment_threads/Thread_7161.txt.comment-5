Hello, We are going to need some basic information.
The first place to start is what motherboard do you have?
Take the side off the case & look for a make & model on the motherboard.
It will be something like ASUS A7N8X.
Next, with the side off, start the computer & look at all the fans.
Are they all spinning?
Are they clear?
Not all clogged up with dust?
The main fans to look at are the CPU fan & the Power Supply Fan.
Note everything & give us as many details as possible.
