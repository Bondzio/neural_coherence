<s> can i use my old xbox hard drive as an external hard dive for my mac? </s>
<s> if so, how do i do it? </s>
<s> is the drive out of the XBox case? </s>
<s> If so, what interface does it use? </s>
<s> IDE(PATA) or SATA? </s>
<s> Your choice of external enclosure will depend on your answer. </s>
<s> Either way, the connection of choice for the Mac is Firewire but USB 2.0 will do at a pinch. </s>
<s> (It's not as fast.) </s>
<s> (Yes, I know that 480 is faster than 400 but when it comes to the crunch, USB 2.0 is slower overall) So, a Firewire enclosure that is capable of supporting the type of connection, data and power, that the HD requires. </s>

<s> Sadly I see 8GB memory sticks which IMHO you can sell off the xbox intact and get 2 of the 8GB sticks. </s>
