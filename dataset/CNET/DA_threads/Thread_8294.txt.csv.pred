1.2.1	But you have to get the exact CPU model then see if it's on a motherboard's CPU support list.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Robert explained what needs to be done.	St
1.3.2	I just like to offer you MUST be 100% sure what you have.	St
1.3.3	If you have a true mobile or laptop only cpu setup, it just can't be swapped in most cases.	St
1.3.4	Also, you may have a supported cpu, but your &quot;setup&quot; is mounted on some laptop pcb or such that the cpu is soldered to and not socketed.	St
1.3.5	Until you can see and hold in your hand the cpu itself and look at it's &quot;stock number&quot; after cleaning the cpu package will it all make sense.	St
1.3.6	tada -----Willy	St
