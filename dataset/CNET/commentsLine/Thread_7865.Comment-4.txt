&quot;all it takes is one bad one to misbehave and knock others off the air&quot;...not sure what this means.
if one machine misbehaves, how would that affect the wireless network?
unless that machine has access to configuration of that router, then there is not much that machine can do.
based on what you said, there are a few possible reasons this isnt working, but i don't think proffitt is going to help you here...some of those answers are balogna... wireless interference is not your problem.
this router has been configured as somewhat of an access point to your building's network, correct?
it is always reccomended that dhcp should only be done centrally, in one place, as near to your nat device as possible.
is your router now serving dhcp your entire network?
having multiple dhcp servers is a horrible, horrible idea...don't offload dhcp to your extenders either.
you want one single dhcp server, no matter how large your subnet is.
the best way to answer your question is for you to tell us a little bit more about your company's network.
is this router now serving as a gateway?
or is it simply routing packets internally (which i doubt)...you mention your company has &quot;other wifi networks&quot; in other buildings, but are these buildings connected to yours?
like i mentioned earlier, i doubt this is a physical issue (interference, overload), but a logical issue...
