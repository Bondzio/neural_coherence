<s> Hello, I have a HP Pavillion 734n with Phoenix BIOS. </s>
<s> I tried to install a second hard drive with another XP on it. </s>
<s> It booted up a couple of times, then the next cold start all I get is a beeping. </s>
<s> I have no monitor or floppy. </s>
<s> All I got is the beeping. </s>
<s> I removed the second hard drive, but the beeping still continues. </s>
<s> I tried to put in the restore CD's but they wouldn't boot up either. </s>
<s> Any help or thoughts would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, Bobby &quot;the beep&quot; </s>
<s> Perhaps you can get a little closer to the source of your problem by looking here. </s>

<s> Most likely you dislodged something putting in the drive, reseat video card and memory and see if that does it!! </s>

<s> Thanks for the help! </s>

<s> How the heck did you know that. </s>
<s> You must have a lot of experience with fumble-thumbed lamers like me. </s>
<s> Fixed it right up! </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
