PRoblem returned, seems it wasnt microsoft publisher aftrer all.
The real reason, after much searching has turned out to be Norton systemworks 2004!!!!
apparently it has issues with any version of nero burning rom earlier than nero 6. as I only 5.5.9 this causes a conflict.
Removed systemworks and no longer have the problem.
If you also have this problem then either upgrade to nero 6 or remove systemworks.
Apparently no one is getting a response from the manufacturers of norton who are burying their heads in the proverbial sand on this problem with their software.
Hope this helps anybody else with this issue and btw - cheapest place I have found for nero 6 is e-bay, worth a try.
