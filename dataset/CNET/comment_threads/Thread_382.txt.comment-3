Country is US and I'm looking for something in the sub-$200 area.
Yet, I'd probably just be using it as a hot-swap device on top of a desktop.
It would be nice to be of considerable size so that I could store my OS on it along with other items.
I could even go as low as 32gb possibly.
I just want something from a reliable company, but I also know that patience is a virtue with internal and external storage.
