Thanks for your help, everyone.
I suspect Willy was right about the USB ports having been physically damaged by the power loss/surge.
Once i'd managed to get on line USB reappeared in device manager & system information (I don't know what i did to make this difference) but USB devices still wouldn't work.
Iv'e also just discovered that the floppy drive isn't recognising disks anymore.
Time for a new system, methinks!!
Oh well, this one was getting old anyway.
The new one will include a UPS!!
Thanks again, JeffK
