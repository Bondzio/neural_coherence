... the laser failed to calibrate or some such thing (i never saved it to dig deeper).
i just pop in another blank disc until i find one will burn.
i usually end up with 1 disc out of 6 that won't burn.
this is using disc utility to burn disc images on an external sony dvd burner drx-820.
i also use popcorn and/or toast 6 lite (which came with the burner) but don't recall problems with those programs.
