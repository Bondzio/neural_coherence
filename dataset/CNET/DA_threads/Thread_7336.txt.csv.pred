1.1.1	I was wondering if someone could give me the idea of the life of a typical , run off the mill DVD writer .	St
1.1.2	I have been using LG DVD writers since a long time on customer's PCs .	St
1.1.3	They have been good .	St
1.1.4	But recently I have seen that the DVD writers go bad after burning 20-25 DVDs .	St
1.1.5	The model of the LG DVD writer is GH22NS50 .	St
1.1.6	Now these writers are used on different PCs at different locations .	St
1.1.7	So I think I can eliminated bad power supply as the culprit .	St
1.1.8	Also all the time the DVDs were burnt at 8X or lower speeds .	St
1.1.9	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.10	Thanks Sam PS : Specs of the PCs Pentium Dual core or Core 2 Duo Asus motherboard with G31 or G41 chipsets 2 GB of DDR2 or DDR3 RAM 450 watts SMPS	St
1.2.1	But I did encounter some go bad after a few months.	St
1.2.2	It was EASY to find out why.	St
1.2.3	Most of the cases had a hot enclosure with 2 drives back to back with no air gap.	St
1.2.4	Heat kills them fast.	St

1.3.1	I suspect a decent DVD burner drive last at least 18-24mos.	St
1.3.2	w/o some issue.	St
1.3.3	However, I have found more issues with poor DVD blanks and/or the environments sometimes employed, ie: factory floor.	St
1.3.4	Since many users try to save costs, buying some bulk purchase will at times bite them.	St
1.3.5	Often they work well, but can become flaky either because the blanks are poor or the burner is starting to show wear&amp;tear, the combo of each isn't rewarding.	St
1.3.6	While burn speeds can be auto-downgraded, many users still want the old level of before and thus complain of poor DVD drive.	St
1.3.7	Regardless, a typical home user should see in the neighborhood of 400 burns or so in maintained good PC.	St
1.3.8	I exclude other manufacturing issues or &quot;KIDS!!	St
1.3.9	!&quot; because I view that as a problem.	St
1.3.10	Poor handling of blanks and storage is not unheard of.	St
1.3.11	Just to be clear, if a DVD drive is beginning to show problems, just swap it out.	St
1.3.12	tada -----Willy	St
