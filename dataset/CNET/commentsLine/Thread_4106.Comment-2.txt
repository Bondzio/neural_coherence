back then they was not a problem with refill but now ink is coming from across seas especially with refilliable catridges and to refill a manufactures ink cartridge the reason that dont work well cause when you do recycle ink cartridges they change the stuff thats in the cartridge and put in ultra assorbant in other words refills are not what they use to be and come on dig in them pockets and pay a little more for new ink cartridges cause you cant beat the printing you get and ink last twice as long, but when you use refillable you cut your luck
