I am sharing folders between two computers within my home wireless network but can't seem to access the folders when I go into network places/network connections. How can I access these shared folders across my network? Thanks

Im running three Dells, using XP, and sometime need to use the process after adding a shaired file. Go into My Network Place, then under Network Task (to the left) click on Add a network place. Welcome will come up, just click NEXT. Go down to (Choose another network location) and click.Then click NEXT. You can now check that both of your PC are listed, and the files you are shairing are listed, when you click on the down arrow,or use the BROWSE Entire Network. I hope the helps you. I'm assuming you know that both PCs must be running.

(Right Click MY COMPUTER and select properties, then click on the Computer Name tab) 2. If Windows Firewall is turned on, File and Print Sharing must be checked in the Windows Firewall Exceptions Area. (Click on START &gt; CONTROL PANEL &gt; WINDOWS FIREWAL &gt; Exceptions Tab) 3. If using a 3rd party firewall such as ZoneAlarm, McAfee or Norton, it needs to be configured to allow network access. 4. You must physically have a file or folder shared by Right Clicking the file name and selecting the Sharing Tab.
