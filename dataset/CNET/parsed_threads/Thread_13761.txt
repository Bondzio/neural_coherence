<s> I own a Dell XPS 600 desktop running a Pentium D 3.2gHz processor with 2GB ram and I am looking for ways to improve the performance of my machine, if any. </s>
<s> I purchased it for the purpose of using very demanding 3d graphics and modeling programs such as 3dstudiomax, maya, rhinoceros and have come to be a little disappointed in it's ability to run these programs, both from a speed side and visual performance side. </s>
<s> Is it possible to add RAM to this machine, change processors, or otherwise increase the performance via operating system settings? </s>
<s> What video card do you have in that system? </s>
<s> That may be where you could improve things possibly. </s>
<s> Regard, JB </s>
<s> I have Dual 256MB NVIDIA GeForce 7800 GTX with SLI </s>
<s> How about upgrading to 8800 GTX cards to improve performance? </s>
