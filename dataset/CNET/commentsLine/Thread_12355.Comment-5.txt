tomshardware says....&quot;our recommendation hence is simple: keep your athlon 64 x2 if you can and wait for the phenom b3 stepping.
not only will it fix the tld bug, but we expect most motherboard manufacturers to be ready with proper phenom support by then.&quot; no point in buying something's that's not right.
by the time you save your pennies, maybe b3 will be available.
