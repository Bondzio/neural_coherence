If you expect everything to work as it did in the old computer, then no. The information will still be there but the OS will not accept the move as if it did not happen. So, just what do you expect and why?

You will not be able to say &quot;Oops&quot; and put it back in the old machine and have it work as before. Why? I don't know how XP does it but it puts something on that drive to mark the installation as illegal. You get to sort that out with Microsoft to get it working again.
