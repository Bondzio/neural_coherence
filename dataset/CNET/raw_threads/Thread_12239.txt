Can anybody recommend a particular power supply that operates around 400w that can be obtained in the UK easily, i have noted the following brands - Thermaltake and Purepower from other discussions but have struggled to find a UK supplier. I need to replace the supply as most people find that my new Gforce 6600 AGP will not operate on games as I keep getting the lack of power and drop resolution error meesage. The PC works fine on Outlook explorer and day to day packages but I can yuse my graphics card for its purpose - HELP
