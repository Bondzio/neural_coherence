It's advertised as 8GB, but windows only shows 7.52GB of available space. So I called Imation and asked them what was up with that. They indicated that was normal, so I asked them why they advertised it as an 8GB drive if it really wasn't. The tech assured me it was an 8GB drive, so I asked him, if I tried to transfer 8GB of data to the drive, would it hold it? He said, &quot;No.&quot; Sound like false advertising to you? Sure does to me. Is this standard for all flash drives, and if so, why?

Let's look at your KILO WATT HOURS on your bill. Kilo = 1000 and not 1024. There are some that want that to change but in a nutshell. Kilo = 1000 Giga = 1,000,000,000 You see where this is going?

It has a title page, an index, appendix, maybe a glossary, and there has to be space for pages numbers. A certain number of pages have to devoted to keeping track of where data is located. It's the same way with your flash drive. A certain amount of those 8 GB are dedicated to keeping track of where everything is located.
