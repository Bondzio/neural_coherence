<s> I applied some thermal paste from radioshack on my cpu a week ago but then today I was switching the motherboard and I wanted to know cant I just take the heat sink off and just put it back on the new motherboard without reapplying it? </s>
<s> I lost my thermal paste and I need to put my cpu in the new motherboard and I wanted to just move it without cleaning and reapplying. </s>
<s> Im not switching cpus, Im just moving it. </s>
<s> There will be gaps. </s>
<s> Spring for a new tube. </s>
<s> If the paste is sufficiently present, sure you can reuse it. </s>
<s> That's the true paste, NOT a heat pad which normally is shipped with new cpus. </s>
<s> To play it safe, get another tube of paste, which would you rather do, replace paste or burnt-out cpu? </s>

<s> I used a paste I bought from radioshack then I put it away then now I got my mobo from what I just returned because it wasnt working and I cant find the paste I put away. </s>
