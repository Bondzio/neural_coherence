1.
&quot;i set the hard drive to master as shown in the instructions &quot; mine have always used cable select or cs.
may be an non-issue, but many enclosures have documentation issues so i note it.
2.
&quot;i have two computers one with xp home and one with me on it when i plugged the hard drive into either of the two machines the drivers were installed automatically and the hard drive showed up in the device manager of both machines as this device is working properly however the hard drive does not show up in the c drive of either of the two machines.
&quot; a. not supposed to show up in the c drive or as c. b. you didn't tell if you partitioned and formatted the new space.
