you have not told us, what you are going to use this computer for.???
gaming ?
media ?
photo's ?
you are doing the right thing to upgrade.
but you need to ditch the powersupply unless it has a rating of 18 amps or more on the +12 volt powere leads.
the newer cpu's and graphic cards reguire a lot more power.
i would also go ahead and get 1 gig of ram because the newer games recommend using 1 gig.
make sure you have plenty of cooling also because of more power = more heat..i have the ati 800pro card and it works great running farcry at 1280x1024 with no problems.
i wish i had purchased a lcd screen but they were not recommended by the mags until i purchased my 22&quot; philips.
just my 2 cents..
