It recognized all the hardware which is what threw me initially.
I think I found the problem, I was able to view the hardware monitor and the cpu temps were in the high 80's and going up.
So it looks like the MB is defective and a replacement is in order.Thanks for the suggestions Rob, you always seem to have a good answer and I appreciate that.
