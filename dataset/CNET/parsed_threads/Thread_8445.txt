<s> I have a Dell XPS with a HD that is getting full so I have added a second SATA HD. </s>
<s> I have turned the second HD &quot;on&quot; in the BIOS, and XP &quot;sees&quot; the HD in the device manager, but it does not list it as an available drive in &quot;My Computer.&quot; I think that I need to format the drive. </s>
<s> Is that correct? </s>
<s> If so, any suggestions on how to do that? </s>
<s> Go into XP's Disk Management and partition and format (and possibly activate) the drive. </s>
<s> It's simple once you know it. </s>
<s> http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309000 is helpful. </s>
