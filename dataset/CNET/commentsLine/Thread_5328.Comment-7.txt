did you mean driver or firmware?
i never changed the driver, just for some reason windows xp can't seem to find the correct driver.
for firmwware, i actually wish i could go back to an old version but there aren't any listed on light-on's site.
only the version i currently have.
i did find one on a different site (i don't know how old it was) but when i tried to install it, it already knew i had the latest version?
