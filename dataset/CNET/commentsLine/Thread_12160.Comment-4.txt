well i have a very bad power supply, i don't even know what brand it is, i did take a look it saids: &quot;addw power supply&quot; that's it, i think the addw is the brand name for it, like i said i builted my pc in hong kong, i got it custom builted so i have no clue what kind of psu those guys gave me, so far there has been some problems with it but not too serious i guess.
a few months ago, there was a very serious problem with my new pc, when i click on &quot;log out&quot; in windows xp, my pc, unexpectly: shuts off then back on, then off then on then off then on....rapidly and uncontrollable i pull the plug and turn my pc back on, it was dead, it beeps at me but nothing came on, in that moment my pc was dead.
when my hp died, it too beep at me and nothing came on, i cried and cried because i can't believe within just a month of losing old hp i broke another new pc, i couldn't stop crying as i manually turn my pc on and off hoping it might it might come back online, but it didn't, so i turn it off and spend an hour crying.
when i'm finish with that, i tried one more time, i turn on my supposedly broken pc and a miracle happened.
my pc was alive again!
bios boot, then windows, everything was back to normal again, it was strange since my pc was suppose to be broken, i heard the beeps and saw the blank screen, it was dead, but for some odd reason it was back alive again after i turn it back on.
maybe asus mobo revive itself, but it doesn't matter, my pc is working, i bought my old hp in canada 5 years ago, and it broke 8 times within a year and the tech guys couldn't fix it so they have to gave me new parts everytime it broke.
every single pc i own always breaks, no matter how careful i am it still breaks in the end, i vow not to let my new pc breaks again, that's whay i got so anxious and ask so many questions and got so worried, believe me, if your old pc breaks 8 times per year and your new one is having problems anyone would get all worried sick.
well thanks for helping me out, really, many thanks.
