...power requirement indicated in the hardware review review :  the x1600 and modern graphics cards in general are a power hungry bunch.
if you don't have the psu overhead to spare at the moment, you're looking immediately at extra expense.
or you could go for one of those older cards that still do well in 2d speeds, and suck up far less power.
there are a few modern cards which use less wattage though :   x-bit seems to be one of the few tech sites that actually measures current draw, which may help upgraders to avoid upseting a weaker psu.
personally if the dx10 hardware coming in 2007 is going to be as bad as suspected, i suspect the electricity to power them for a year (we've had 3 prices rises in 6 months), may be more than the cost of the computers themselves!
