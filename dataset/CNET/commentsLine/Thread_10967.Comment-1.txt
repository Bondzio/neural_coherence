my m/b is a asus p5ld2-vm, the chipset is intel 82945g, the cpu is dual core and runs at 26.6 ghz, and i have 4 gigs of ram.
i want to install a 3d video card to improve the display.
presently i'm using the onboard video.
i need a suggestion for buying a compatable video card, that will give me the best performance for the price.
any other suggestions are welcomed.
i would like to stay under $250.
