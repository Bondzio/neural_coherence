i was able to connect after disabling the security.
i then went back and enabled the security.
yesterday i took the laptop with me to a place that has wireless.
they told me i had to connect my laptop wired first becaue they have a password then i would be able to use it wirelessly.
good news it worked when i wired it then worked when i made it wireless.
question regarding that is if i go somewhere like a coffee shop i'm thinking that the way you would connect is to refresh your network list then when you see a secure connection that you would connect to it.
i have noticed that when the laptop goes into hibernation or sleep mode that when i come to get onto the laptop that the internet connection is not there but as soon as i take it out of either of those modes it comes right back.
is that normal?
i have till august 31st to return the laptop to circuit city and get a new laptop.
i really do not want vista because of what i have heard about vista.
also everytime i lose my internet connection my boss and the other employees can not see their schedule which is something i do and that means i have to email their schedule to them which is more work for me.
this is another reason why i want to make sure it is working becaue my boss is tired of me constantly having problems with this laptop and i work 12 to 14 hours a day so i don't have time to do this on my own.
i really appreciate all of the help that i have gotten on this forum and would appreciate it if someone could answer my questions for me.
