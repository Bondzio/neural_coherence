1.1.1	For christmas ( even though it is a little late ) , I want to get a Terabyte hard drive .	St
1.1.2	It would be set up to be an external hard drive but I could purchase the 3.5 HDD and put it in a 1 TB enclosure .	St
1.1.3	My past experience with external hard drives ( or individual HDDs ) is that although a hard drive may be cheap and high capacity , it could corrupt on you as easy as pie .	St
1.1.4	While high end ones , lower capacity , but still can crap out on you as well but less likely to .	St
1.1.5	1 terabyte hard drive is an extreme high capacity hard drive so I want to be sure not to fall for them cheap and high capacity HDDs , but I lose all my data because it craps out on me .	St
1.1.6	My question is : What is a good HDD brand ( specifically for a Terabyte ) that also wo n't break the bank but also will not crap out on me as well ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks in advanced !	St
1.2.1	then see what questions remain .	St
1.2.2	My observation , external HDDs are generally much more susceptible , vulnerable to problems and failure than internals .	St
1.2.3	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	True single 1Tb HDs are not that plentiful yet but available .	St
1.3.2	The brand that seems to pop-up is that from Hitachi and WD while others really offer dual-500Gb setups in ready made ext .	St
1.3.3	cases and/or if you DIY .	St
1.3.4	It rally does n't matter what HDs are out there , as all are prone to damage for whatever reason , being 1Tb is n't going to isolate it from similar damage .	St
1.3.5	I tend to lean towards WD and Seagate for typical installs , Seagate more as they have a better warranty period compared to anyone else .	St
1.3.6	Samsung is another to look for when 1Tb is made by them .	St
1.3.7	IMHO , wait for Seagate offerings if at all possible .	St
1.3.8	So far , I have n't heard any horror stories , but I do n't fix a zillion HD problems neither .	St
1.3.9	adios -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	http : //www.seagate.com/ww/v/index.jsp ? locale=en-US & name=barracuda-es-2-sata-3-0-gb/s-1-tb-hard-drive & vgnextoid=481e83de34b43110VgnVCM100000f5ee0a0aRCRD & vgnextchannel=b655f141e7f43110VgnVCM100000f5ee0a0aRCRD & reqPage=Model Put it in an external USB-2 enclosure .	St
1.4.2	Bring money .	St
1.5.1	Google info on it and discover it sets up some roadblocks to file sharing for certain file types that might interfere with your intended use of the drive , or not .	St
1.5.2	Supposedly if you do n't load the mionet software you wo n't have the oppressive digital rights management policing the drive 's usage .	St
1.5.3	Unfortunately , most places selling the World Book 1TB drives do n't mention any of that in the sales pitch .	St
1.5.4	Here 's the most popular article about it .	St
1.5.5	http : //www.theregister.co.uk/2007/12/07/western_digital_drm_crippled_harddrive/	St
1.6.1	for primary data storage ?	Ques
1.6.2	for backup of data stored on internal drives ?	Ques
1.6.3	really need portability ?	Ques
1.6.4	is there room for another internal drive ?	Ques
1.6.5	VAPCMD	St
1.7.1	Thank you ALL for your input and suggestions .	St
1.7.2	I really very much appreciate it .	Polite
1.7.3	To VAPCMD , thanks for pointing me to the storage forums .	Polite
1.7.4	I did n't get too much information about 1 TB hard drives but a lot about external hard drives as well as good or bad brands .	St
1.7.5	As per your other questions , I would like to use this hard drive as an external hard drive for it 's portability and not for primary storage or backup , but just to use for my gigabytes worth of folders I transfer and download .	St
1.7.6	After much research surrounding terabytes , there are some things I 've learned .	St
1.7.7	I do n't know if it 's good or bad , but because there are n't much 1 TB hard drives , it was n't a vast amount of research that was required .	St
1.7.8	Although the WD World Book is the most known and by far the cheapest , there have also been a lot of complaints about it as well .	St
1.7.9	Also , I have had negative experience with Western Digital hard drives as well to add unto it .	St
1.7.10	What I have heard is that Seagate is an execellent brand with much positive feedback about their hard drive .	St
1.7.11	It 's significantly more , but it seems the most worth it because of it 's extraordinary manufacturer 's warranty .	St
1.7.12	This works well because of all the research on how these hard drives fail as well .	St
1.7.13	Coincidentally enough , I ended up going the route that coryphaeus suggested .	St
1.7.14	Thank you all again .	St
1.7.15	It seems that all that I have researched is confirmed by all of you .	St
1.7.16	If anything , it puts my doubts at ease as I have already gone through with all the purchases and what not .	St
1.7.17	Thank you .	St
