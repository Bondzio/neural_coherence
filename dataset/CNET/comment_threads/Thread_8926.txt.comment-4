I found it to require a 2+GHz P4 and preferably some HT CPU or 64-bitter.
The big problem was not the &quot;raid array&quot; or disk speed, but just the overwhelming amount of data the CPU has to crunch.
The 4400 RPM DRIVE was the best solution to cut down on noise coming from the PC in the video room.
I'm sharing that while SNAPSTREAM is very nice, you may want to just go with a ready to use solution (much cheaper!)
than build your own or something like -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=PJ473AAR which my dad purchased and has been enjoying for over a month now.
My SCENIUM was a refurb at 139 bucks and the DVD recorder is the APTEK for 129 bucks and both are doing fine.
I also have the DLINK MEDIA CENTER like you see at http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=318 and it has the benefit of being very quiet while letting me put all the media collection somewhere else in the house.
