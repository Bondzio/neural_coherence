2338	0	500803	5002824	NR	ZeroWingAlpha	10/5/10 7:55 AM	1.2862653E12	Stuck at Early PCI Initialization in POST	Hey everyone, I have a bit of trouble here. I just finished moving my hardware into a new case I am having a problem getting past POST. Here are the specs: Motherboard: ABIT Fatality AN8 SLI Videocard: NVIDIA GeForce 7800 GTX Harddrive: Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 8 40GB ATA/133 2nd Harddrive: Seagate Momentus 5400.2 120GB SATA Soundcard: SIIG SoundWave 5.1 PCI RAM: OCZ EL DDR PC-3200 Dual Channel Platinum 1GB (two sticks) CPU: AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4800+ I also had two 120mm LED Silent case fans that were replaced by two new 120mm LED Silent case fans that came with the new case. I also removed a CD Drive (but kept a DVD Drive) because there is not a necessity for it. All of these parts with preexistent in a fully functional and working computer prior to moving them to a new case. The motherboard is equipped with a visual LED/POST code device that reads ?25? whenever I boot up my system. The manual describes POST code 25 as: Early PCI Initialization -Enumerate PCI Bus Number -Assign memory & I/O resource -Search for a valid VGA device & VGA BIOS, and put it into C000:0 Sometimes it will code ?9.0.? before 25. The manual describe POST code 9.0. as: Complete uGuru initial process AWARD BIOS take over booting job I?m not using uGuru so this baffles me. I?m not a hardware guy and I?m at the extent of my knowledge. Obviously it?s a hardware issue however I?m fairly confident none of my hardware is damaged there for I must have connected something wrong, or made some type of mistake trying to boot it up after dismantling and rebuilding in a new case. Any advice is welcome. Thank you for your time.
2338	1	500803	5002846	5002824	ZeroWingAlpha	10/5/10 8:30 AM	1.2862674E12	Update	Progress Update: -Cleared CMOS, No improvement still coding 25 - Tried a minimal boot using just the following components: Motherboard, CPU, Power Supply, Single stick of ram, Videocard and Keyboard. Boot Successful. -Tried to boot using all components except Hard drives Boot Successful. -Tried to boot using all components except main hard drive. Boot Successful. -Tried to boot using all components. Boot failed, coding 25. Probable cause: Possible lose IDE cable. Solution: Checking main board and hard drive. Probable cause: Bad IDE cable. Solution: Swapping IDE cables between the hard drive and the DVD drive. Probable cause: Bad hard drive. Solution: None available. Do you have any other thoughts? Any advice welcome. Thanks for your time.

2338	3	500803	5002874	5002824	ZeroWingAlpha	10/5/10 9:15 AM	1.2862701E12	Update	Progress Update: Switched IDE cables between hard drive and CD drive. Insured IDE cable was firmly and securely plugged into component and main board. -Tried to boot using all components except main hard drive. Boot Successful. IDE cable not bad. -Tried to boot using all components. Boot Successful. Initial issue was probably related to the IDE cable not being fully plugged in. Disk read error. Rebooting system gave me POST code 9.0. - Cleared CMOS and tried to boot using all components. Boot Successful. Disk read error. Unfortunately I only have a USB keyboard that will not allow me to Ctrl+Alt+Del after the Disk read error. I?ve solved the initial problem however, it seems as though I?ve come into another more major problem. Bad hard drive, or just failed to read? I don?t know how to tell the difference.
2338	4	500803	5002877	5002847	ZeroWingAlpha	10/5/10 9:17 AM	1.28627022E12	Nope	Bob ? I didn?t set it up on cardboard and test it prior to putting it into its new case. At this point in the trouble shooting should I continue to worry about my motherboard shorting out or have I eliminated that possibility? I haven?t seen any warning signs of a short.
2338	5	500803	5002887	5002824	ZeroWingAlpha	10/5/10 9:29 AM	1.28627094E12	well...	Well, I solved the problem, however BOOTMGR is missing. I guess I should've expected something else to go wrong. Now just to find that dang Windows CD...
