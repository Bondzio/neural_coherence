<s> Hi running intel e6750, asus p5kse, 2x sata seagate HD's on vista business I have windows running and bought the Samgsung SH s203 dvd writer and im trying to get it installed. </s>
<s> I plugged it into sata port 3 on the mobo. </s>
<s> when i boot up it doesnt get recognized by the system. </s>
<s> Ive gone into bios and designated ports 3/4 as cdrom and that hasnt worked. </s>
<s> Ive tried all combinations of plugging in the 3 sata drives into the sata ports. </s>
<s> no dice. </s>
<s> Anyother ideas? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> If the BIOS doesn't see it, neither will Windows. </s>
<s> I have run across machines with this issue but the owner forgot to plug in the new SATA power plug as well. </s>
