<s> Excellent article on the future of the SSDs. </s>
<s> Hard disk manufacturer Seagate has published an extraordinary report all but proving that solid-state disk (SSD) technology will remain niche for the next decade or two, at least. </s>

<s> Maybe this is where we'll have L1 disk storage and L2 disk storage and L3 disk storage access. </s>
<s> Explainer? </s>
<s> Look up how L1, L2 and L3 CPU CACHE systems work on CPUs today. </s>
<s> Maybe not everything needs to be on now costly SSD? </s>

<s> seeing Seagate is the laggard in SSD. </s>
<s> FUD won't work and it is Seagate which will become the niche player, in high end high cap disks for servers, cloud and externals. </s>
<s> Unfortunately for disk mfrs, none have made an aggressive move to counter the disruption of SSDs. </s>
<s> Too bad, and sad, to see more storied brands and companies become invisible to consumers. </s>
<s> I read that SSD will be the storage or front-end boot device for laptops and game PCs. </s>
<s> They're not going away and if Seagate is right, pricing is a factor holding back but only for the time being. </s>
<s> Once the NAND memory gets geared-up I don't see where it can't be the prime storage or boot device not long from now. </s>
<s> While current HDs do just fine and hold the storage maximums, I'm sure there will be a mix of storage later. </s>
<s> SSD are bound to jump in where the current iPods and Druids will rule once offered. </s>
<s> SSD are also going into devcies not 100% PC, but immediate storage doe say on printers and possibly stand-alone systems. </s>
<s> As for myself, I'm quite happy w/o any SSD, since my storage needs are easily meant, traditionally. </s>
<s> It would nice to have SSD as a flash drive and mount it and get all those s/w tools and what-nots for a field repair. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Because they think they have a better crystal ball? </s>
<s> 10 years is a long time (except maybe for an old man like me, hehe). </s>
<s> I remember the 5.25&quot; 40mb. </s>
<s> harddrive for a couple hundred dollars. </s>
<s> At that time I thought it was for niche market also. </s>
<s> I certainly couldn't afford it. </s>
