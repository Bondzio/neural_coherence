Then i got a server (actually an usual computer: P4 3.0HT, ASUS P4P800-X, 1GB DDR, 2x100Mbps NIC), set up the Win2003 Server and configured Routing&Remote access, so i had i small network. Then i discovered the speed was decreased when surfing internet. Made a speed test on server, it shows 600-900kbps, then plug a cable into workstation, and test result was 2000-2200kbps. The NIC on server are ok, replaced with new one. Routing&remote acces was turned off when testing, no network applications& extra services running. What may be the problem? What can cause Windows Server to decrease the speed?

Adding NAT is going to frustrate people that actually look at the numbers. The speed you noted was fine years ago but as rates climbed... What I'm writing is to use what works best where it works best. Bob
