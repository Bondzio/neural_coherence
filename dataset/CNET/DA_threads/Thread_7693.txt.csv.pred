1.1.1	I've bought an LG DP1W with wifi recently.	St
1.1.2	I tried to connect my LaCie 1TB harddrive to it, but it wouldn't recognise it.	St
1.1.3	The harddrive is in NTFS file system.	St
1.1.4	My friend has a WD harddrive connected to a WD multimedia player, and it works perfectly.	St
1.1.5	His harddrive has an NTFS file system as well, so this is why I get confused.	St
1.1.6	Is it because his mm player and hd have the same manufacturer?	St
1.1.7	I know that you're going to tell me to format it to FAT32, but I know that the max file size there is 4GB, and this is not a solution for me, because I bought it to watch hi-def films with it.	St
1.2.1	The situation is not really clear.	St
1.2.2	- Is it relevant your LG has Wifi?	St
1.2.3	- How do you connect the drive?	Ques
1.2.4	- Does the manual of the LG say they support an NTFS disk?	St
1.2.5	And to experiment: - Does your friends player recognise your drive?	St
1.2.6	- Does your LG recognize your friends drive?	Polite
1.2.7	Kees	St
1.3.1	Thanks for replying.	St
1.3.2	I guess wifi isn't relevant, sorry.	St
1.3.3	I connect my drive to the mm player via usb.	St
1.3.4	I think I threw the manunal out.	St
1.3.5	I thought about experimenting and testing that out once I get back, I'm currently not home.	St
1.3.6	I'll have to wait till sunday evening.	Ques
1.3.7	I'll post the results then!	St
1.3.8	And thanks again!	Polite
1.4.1	I've exactly the same problem.	St
1.4.2	Probably it's a combination between the manufacturer of the device and the external HDD.	St
1.4.3	Tried to contact LG, but haven't got a response yet.	St
1.4.4	Keep me posted about your progress..	St
