buy when the next processor comes out, but don't buy the top of the line.
buy the second or third from the top.
it will be so fast compaired to what you have.
you'll need to think about a couple of things.
one a mother with maybe ht technology and of course buy at least 2gig of ram.
after that, load your o.s.
and then you can maybe use some of the hardware from your old pc.
just check for compatabillity with old and new, good luck!
my pc is older than yours and i'm going to price some new stuff first of the week.
