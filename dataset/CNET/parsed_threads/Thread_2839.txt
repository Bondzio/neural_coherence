<s> This may not be an easy question to answer with the information I can provide, but this is the jist of the problem: I recently purchased a new Motherboard/CPU package and put the system together myself. </s>
<s> Everything appears to be hooked-up correctly.. </s>
<s> When I turn on the power all the hardware kicks in and I am given the option to either press ''delete'' to go into the BIOS menu or ''tab'' to continue. </s>
<s> The issue is that no matter which I press, in about 10-25 seconds thereafter the system simply shuts itself off. </s>
<s> What bugs me the most about this error is that the timing of the shut downs is inconsistent. </s>
<s> Sometimes the computer will stay on for 2 minutes, other times it will shut down before the monitor can even refresh the image after booting-up. </s>
<s> Is this a hardware or software problem? </s>
<s> Greetings. </s>
<s> Sounds like you have an overheating problem. </s>
<s> Check that the CPU is properly fixed to the heatsink with thermal tape or grease properly applied. </s>
<s> Check that your fans are all functioning.I feel it is most likely to be the CPU overheating as the case fans failing would likely take longer than a couple of minutes For the case to heat to the point of shut off. </s>
<s> Hope you get it fixed soon Cheers Stewart </s>
<s> I should also say that a power suppy unit can also have this effect if it is not up to supplying the watts needed. </s>
<s> However I imagine you will have researched the size of PSU required as you built the rig. </s>
<s> Cheers Stewart </s>
