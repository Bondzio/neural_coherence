i received my plk200 and ple200 last week and really gave them a workout over the weekend.
i tried them in every obscure location in my house and am extremely happy with the results.
no dropped signal; constant signal strength; and virtually no hiccups.
the set up wizard was extremely easy.
hadn't thought about the encryption, so i'll go back and set that up.
the only complaint i have with the units is the ethernet cable that is included is only 3-4 long and barely reached from my router to the wall outlet, so i had to buy some longer cables.
