<s> who is going to to replace systemax, in there manufacturing side. </s>
<s> I work for a company that does the same thing (chipco computers) but we are the fraction of the size of systemax. </s>
<s> I would love to pick up the business, but there is nobody to turn talk to with all of these online resellers. </s>
<s> Just curious on who these customer that have been with systemax for 25+ years are going to rely on for computers. </s>
<s> we have recieved a couple calls, but i figured there would be a panic. </s>
<s> Not seeming that way. </s>
<s> There's not much need to desktops as the move to laptops has been very steady. </s>
<s> Now to tablets! </s>
<s> I have a buddy that was (and still is!) </s>
<s> in the custom desktop PC biz and it's sad to see how small his business has shrunk. </s>
<s> He eeks out a meager living but it looks to be a single digit per cent of what he did just a decade ago. </s>
<s> Desktops are not a place to explore for new business for most folk. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I agree, hence why so many of these business are collapsing. </s>
<s> I just feel that there are enough enthusiast out there to keep the pc alive. </s>
<s> while the facebook stalkers and the news readers love the ease and convenience of tablets and phones. </s>
<s> I do think that there is a nitch for those who want to see there windows score at 7.9, boot in 8 seconds, stare at there 4 monitors, and fill there 8 terabytes that you can never max out with a pc. </s>
<s> Also, it is hard to play the new call of duty that is coming out on a tablet. </s>
<s> Lastly the though i have sold hundreds of laptops and tablets to elementary schools for 7 year olds all the way up to universities, i feel that the computer lab needs to stick around as well as the desktops in business. </s>
<s> the better way to put this, is though i know desktops are diminishing, i do not see them going away. </s>
<s> With this being said is there a place for custom whitebox builders or are we going to throw in the towel to dell, hp, and lenovo. </s>
<s> Because frankly they are often not competitive, they use the same parts, does the name DELL really make people feel that warm and cozy </s>
<s> There is still a need for desktops. </s>
<s> They will become the &quot;workhorse&quot; PC. </s>
<s> Further, these are more customize able compared to anything else out there. </s>
<s> Laptops and tablets are becoming the connectivity leaders but they lack any real meaty attitude unless you make it that way. </s>
<s> But, if that's what users want and cost is reasonable thre you have it. </s>
<s> But, it doesn't matter to me as I fix anything and some old stuff still comes in for repair as that what the customer wants, no ifs, ands, or buts, just make it go again. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
