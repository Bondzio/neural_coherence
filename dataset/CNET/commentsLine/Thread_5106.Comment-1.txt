reading through some of these threads it becomes evident how little i know... i need to set up a wireless, secured network for about 6 individuals located across the country.
i need a central server, probably ftp ability... where do i start?
i am not an it guy (obviously, the crowd says!)
but am more than a complete newb on a computer... this is for a small business startup to give you the obvious context.. since this is probably too advanced for me, can anyone recommend a company that provides this service?
thanks for your time and help chuck
