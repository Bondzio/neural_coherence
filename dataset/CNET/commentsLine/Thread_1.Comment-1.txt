outside input would be greatly appriciated at this point, i have 2 desktops, comp.
1-high power gsky link usb adaptor and a lb-link wireless g pci card, comp.
2- netgear high performance dual band usb adaptor and a microsoft broadband pci card.
with comp.
1 im able to pick up several networks and decent connections with the usb adaptor.
comp 2 usb adaptor picks up several networks but very weak never connecting.
i have tried every possible thing i could think of to get comp 2 connected to any network several many ways and all ive managed to do is completley confuse myself.
