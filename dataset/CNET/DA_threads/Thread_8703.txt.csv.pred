1.1.1	Help !	St
1.1.2	I make music on my laptop , and use an external hard drive for all the storage .	St
1.1.3	I have been working on an album for the past year .	St
1.1.4	I recently had some device i/o errors with my Western Digital MyBook Essential 500 GB when trying to access a couple of my song files .	St
1.1.5	I figured since it was an i/o error it must be a problem with the enclosure .	St
1.1.6	So I took out the hard drive ( 3.5 & quot ; SATA ) and put it in a new enclosure .	St
1.1.7	Now when i look at the folder with the song files , it shows that it is empty , size 0 , size on disc 0 , contains 0 folders .	St
1.1.8	My other folders still have data , just not this one that I was accessing when the i/o errors started happening .	St
1.1.9	Is my data gone forever ?	Ques
1.1.10	Is there a reliable data recovery program ?	Ques
1.1.11	I 'm desperate and would truly appreciate any help .	St
1.1.12	I signed up to cnet just for this .	St
1.1.13	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	While I like GETDATABACK and ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY your story is one where I 'd defer to http : //www.drivesavers.com And where was the backup copy ?	Ques
1.2.2	Most of our stuff fits on a 1 dollar DVDR or even a 10 buck USB memory stick .	St

1.3.1	Whether you check it in Disk Management ?	Ques
1.3.2	Whether the partition/disk size or other information is correct ?	Ques
1.3.3	This I/O error appears in many computers .	St
1.3.4	I think you files should be recovered .	St
1.3.5	To recover files , you may try another product Data Recovery Wizard , which is easy to use .	St
1.4.1	It makes me suspicious of their posts .	St
1.5.1	Thanks everyone .	Polite
1.5.2	I 'll try some of these options .	St
1.5.3	Also , checkdisk does n't even work on the drive .	St
1.5.4	Is this a sure sign of something ?	Ques
1.6.1	Time to turn to a data recovery company to have the biggest chance of getting your precious data back .	St
1.6.2	In the future : BACKUP !	St
1.6.3	Kees	St
