<s> Lots of options...might just make it easy and get a basic Dell....just make sure you have enough RAM...at least 512MBs (1 GB if you get oboard video), enough disk space...100 GBs, a 19' monitor, and a CD-DVD Reader writer....you could get the el cheapo CD-ROM drive from Dell and get a CD-DVD writer of your choice from Newegg or elsewhere. </s>
<s> As far as the software is concerned...unless you absolutely positively need the real deal, just use OpenOffice 2.0. </s>
