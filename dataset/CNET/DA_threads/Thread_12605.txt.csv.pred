1.1.1	I just talked to Dell support , who I got my laptop through , and they said the biggest fastest drive I could upgrade to is 100GB and 7200 RPM .	St
1.1.2	Although I 'll probably follow these requirements , I was just wondering why the size of hard drives in laptops is limited .	St
1.1.3	Anyone know ?	Ques
1.1.4	What if I put in a 320GB hard drive ?	Ques
1.1.5	Would it work ?	Ques
1.1.6	oh yeah , if I did upgrade my hard drive , is there some kind of program already installed ( I have XP Media Center Edition ) that can make a complete transfer of all my data to the new drive or would I have to download a special program ?	Ques
1.2.1	There are 3 limits here ; - the hard disk itself ( it must be a 2 & quot ; inch one ) - the BIOS ( depends on the model of Dell ) - the OS Without knowing details on the machine , we do n't know the limits of the BIOS .	St
1.2.2	Dell does , but maybe you can tell us ?	Ques
1.2.3	To clone the drive , you 'll need some place that has access to both drives .	St
1.2.4	And that wo n't be your laptop if that has only one drive .	St
1.2.5	The best thing to do : use the cloning software that comes with your new drive and mount it in an external enclosure to do the cloning .	St
1.2.6	Hope this helps .	St
1.2.7	Kees	St
1.3.1	If they support the 100GB you can go to 127GB without issue .	St
1.3.2	You did n't share model , the OS on the restore CDs so this is my answer .	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	ok It 's an Inspiron 6400 E1505 .	St
1.4.2	Do you know why the operating system and motherboard limit the size ?	Ques
1.4.3	I just built a desktop pc , and it had no such restrictions .	St
1.4.4	What 's so different between the two , besides their bulk ?	Ques
1.5.1	Let 's say your restore CDs are & quot ; XP Home. & quot ; Since those do n't have SP1 then the limit is there .	St
1.5.2	Widely documented so I 'll stop here .	St
1.6.1	So even a desktop with XP Home without SP1 could n't accept use a bigger hard drive ?	Ques
1.6.2	Sorry , I 'm a noob .	St
1.6.3	My laptop is a XP Media Center Edition with SP2 .	St
1.7.1	- & gt ; READ http : //www.48bitlba.com Sorry I should have put that in my reply before .	St
1.8.1	that makes sense .	St
1.8.2	Thanks !	St
1.9.1	It 's actually XP Pro SP2 .	St
1.9.2	My mistake , I forgot I changed its appearance to that of the Media Center Edition .	St
