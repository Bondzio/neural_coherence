I have had this printer for 3 years and Windows 7 for 1 year.
Never had a problem with printing from computer until today.
A window appears stating that the printer can not communicate with the computer...ALL OF A SUDDEN!!!!!
last printed from a file 2 days ago now this.
Contacted Lexmark for 1 1/2 hours today and they could not fix.
Told me my printer was not compatible with Windows 7.
Why all of a sudden?
What can I do???
Can not afford a new printer.
Please be specific!!
!...thanks.
