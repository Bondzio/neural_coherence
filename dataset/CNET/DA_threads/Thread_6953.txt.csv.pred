1.1.1	Hi There I was hopeing some of you will be able to help me I have a QTECH QT-4SDM2+ motherboard , The bar code No on the PCI slot is 000461443C6F and another one on the motherboard of 2B003700181 Running XP Home When I try to start my computer it does not even go past the POST check it gives a long single beep and then repeates the beep after quite a long silence and it keeps going like this till you turn it off .	St
1.1.2	I have disconnected everything from the motherboard except a hard drive and floppy which I have tested in my other computer I have also installed a new PSU unit just to check it .	St
1.1.3	I have also installed 256mb of ram I know works and removed the old ram .	St
1.1.4	I am not sure what the BIOSs type is as I cant start it .	St
1.1.5	On the motherboard it has a Winbond chip and a Realtek chip and an SIS961 also a SST MPF chip that seems to be in a socket that you could possibly remove from I think that might be the BIOS chip but I am not sure .	St
1.1.6	Can any of you chaps tell me what this long beep means or have you got any idea what BIOS would be in this machine .	St
1.1.7	It has a Intel Celeron 2.20Ghz and 256MB of PC2100 DDR ram .	St
1.1.8	Does anyone know where I can download a Manual for it .	Ques
1.1.9	I have tried SUPPORTINABOX.COM but they just tell me to run the recovery disk and when I tell them that it does not go past the POST to do that they say take it to an Engineer , They could not even tell me what the Error Beep means , Flipping Useless they are .	St

1.2.1	resetting the CMOS ( the CMOS is what the BIOS uses to store settings ( And the error your encouting sounds like something is set wrong ) ) never fear , this is simple Step 1 ) Disconnect the PC from the wall , make sure it has no connection to anything , just the tower , no connection to power .	St
1.2.2	Step 2 ) Find the little cell battery on the motherboard ( little silver battery sorta like a watch battery , but bigger ) pull it out .	St
1.2.3	Step 3 ) With that battery out and the computer disconnected from the wall , go do something for 3-5 minutes with the battery still removed .	St
1.2.4	Step 4 ) Put the battery back in , reconnect the PC to the wall , and try booting it now .	St
1.2.5	Hope this helps , ozos	St

1.4.1	SIS961 is probably the chipset your mtrbd .	St
1.4.2	is based on .	St
1.4.3	That means its the primary reason the bios is designed for , thus look up SIS961 as the basis for any bios info and related mtrbd .	St
1.4.4	specs .	St
1.4.5	The type of bios will direct you to the & quot ; beep code & quot ; of your system .	St
1.4.6	A long beep suggests mtrbd , , power or card at fault , but that 's a guess .	St
