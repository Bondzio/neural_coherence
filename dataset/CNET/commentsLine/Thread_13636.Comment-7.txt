hi, i tried posting a reply twice with no luck so hopefully this one is not duplicating my previous...i have a netgear at home (with three computers linked to it), but recently i had to hook up a linksys to a friend computer so their laptop could operate wireless, etc, eytc...i had a similair problem to yours and had to go to my internet page, type in 192.168.1.1 and access the router home page...from their i had to click on mac address clone (not sure if this would be the same with netgear or not) and noticed mac address was &quot;disabled&quot;...once i enabled it, all ip address problems were self corrected within seconds...not sure if this will be the answer to yours but i certainly would look into it...
