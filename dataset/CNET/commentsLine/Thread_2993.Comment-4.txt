give me some credit!
working with desktops may be bit new to me, but not that new... loaded all the drivers, even being careful to get the video driver directly from nvidia's site, since what is on the supplied disk can some times be a little hinky.
no go.
no matter what i do, the v-card blanks off repeatedly, then ultimately sends the computer to bluescreen land within twenty minutes, forcing me to use the switch to shut it down.
i will look into the suggestion, re.
pulling the gpu... and could i have a bit more info on &quot;hd 770&quot; is that a model, a brand, or both?
i'd like to do a search on it.
