<s> I've been tracking these threads to try and get a handle on the best way to back up my music collection. </s>
<s> I currently have almost 50 gigs and plan to add more from my CD and album collections. </s>
<s> My Windows Media Player stopped working, so I'm dealing with that as well as looking to buy a new computer to replace my Pentium 4. </s>
<s> At the moment, my music files are all intact. </s>
<s> I've been backing up everything on a 350 gig WD external hard drive, but after reading all the negative stuff about externals, I'm at a loss. </s>
<s> Should I buy one or two more externals and keep copies in two locations? </s>
<s> Is on-line storage reliable in the long run? </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be much appreciated! </s>
<s> I have been playing with File Hamster from Mogware, My plan is to have two externals to hold everything and one drive internal. </s>
<s> (2 1TB drives for me and i have a 750 already internal that i will use for this.) </s>
<s> Keeping one external offline but local and only putting it on when needed to backup (weekly? </s>
<s> ), and the other offsite (Quarterly). </s>
<s> (both in decent fireproof boxes) The offsite is overkill but I would rather be safe then sorry. </s>
<s> 50G will use less than 15 dvd. </s>
<s> I was refering to my backup strategy but for him he should be ok with a hard drive turned off (external enclosure that the drive can be swapped out of) File Hamster is a revisioning system that can access opened files to backup as much as possable </s>
