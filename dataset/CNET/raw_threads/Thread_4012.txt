The board had 4 IDE channels so I put ea device on its own channel (2 CD drives, 2 hard drives) This board only has two IDE channels and each channel can support 2 devices for a total of four. Problem: I can only access three of the four devices 2 CD drives and 1 HD. I can see the all 4 drives in POST I can see all 4 in Windows system utilies and hardware profiler but I can't access the second hard drive or get any information to or from it. I had to wipe the first one clean to get anything to work, neither would boot because Windows was installed on them but tied to the old motherboard. Windows can see the hard drive but I can't access any info from it. Whats the deal here?
