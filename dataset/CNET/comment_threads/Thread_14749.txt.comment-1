So I have a great laptop, its just not good for gaming.
My dad works for HP, so I get a discount on there products and will be getting an HP Pavilion desktop, with an included monitor.
My question is what processor, graphics card, and RAM would be equal to the hardware a PS3 has?
Would a core duo processor be enough or would I have to go with a quad core (intel)?
