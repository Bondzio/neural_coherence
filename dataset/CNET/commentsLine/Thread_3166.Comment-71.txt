first and foremost, never trust all of your files to one form or type of backup.
you could drop the portable drive and its instantly toast.
if your stuff is important, back it up three times minimum.
portable hard drive, cd's, connect your portable drive to another computer and store them there.
email important stuff to relatives and ask them to store them for you.
a flash drive is not good backup but its a good way to get files from one place to another for backup.
now back to the original question.
i have seen hard drives running continuously for 10 or more years and some have died in a couple of months.
thats why you never put all of your eggs in one basket.
portable drives should be scan-disked and de-fragmented from time to time.
they should be connected to your computer and checked for virus as well.
portable drives should last as long as a drive in a computer with the caveat that its portable and more susceptible to physical damage than a &quot;stationary&quot; drive.
most drives have a warranty of three to five years.
that might give you some kind of idea how long the manufacturer thinks they will last.
most mfgrs aslo list average mean life expectancy.
it doesn't really mean much except that by test methods a drive under ideal conditions should probably last x number of operational hours.
my best advice, spread your backups over several media and replace the portable at the first sign of a problem (unusual noises such as whines clicks etc) or any problems reading or writing, or being recognized when you plug it in.
use normal scan-disk and de-fragmentation procedures and take care of the portable when transporting or storing.
better safe than sorry
