<s> My old Dell Dimension 4100 has a Pentium III 866 MHz & 128MB SDram with Windows ME. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, it stopped working......... it won't load Windows now. </s>
<s> I want to use it for nothing more than Internet access. </s>
<s> If I reformat it, I would rather not use the reinstall ME CD that came with it since most virus protection doesn't support ME so I'd like to install XP. </s>
<s> I have a Dell reinstallation CD from another newer computer....... can I use that without creating new problems??? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Potential problems: 1. </s>
<s> The reinstallation CD will recognize that this isn't the original computer it came with and refuse to go on. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The reinstallation CD will install the wrong drivers, and things won't work. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> The XP activation won't succeed, because the product key is already being used by the newer computer. </s>
<s> Then you'll have to buy a new license. </s>
<s> And there's always the possibility, of course, that the reason that it won't load Windows now is some hardware issue. </s>
<s> And that might cause the install of Windows XP to fail, even if the above three items don't apply. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
