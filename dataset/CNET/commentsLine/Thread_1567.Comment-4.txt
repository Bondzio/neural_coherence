no, the motherboard out of the computer i have now i wont ever use again, unless i wanted to rebuild the computer.
:p as for the mobo asus pundit-r p4 barebones system intel p4 - silver  (middle) it'll work out cheaper and better and comes with a mobo and the case looks nice - can someone confirm if it comes with a psu !?
... i'll get the intel as they are good for video encoding and i can use my celeron and ram for a bit.
as for the hdd i'll use my 80 gb at first then shell out for 300 gb ... also i'm getting a 500 gb for my main so once i record tv shows and movies i'll arcive them to my main pc!
