If not, try shorting the bios &quot;clearing pins&quot; to return to defaults and reboot. If needed, set the jumper to allow bios clearing. If still no display, reduce system to basics and see if the system responds at all. It appears you may have a blown PSU(power supply) if you open case and observe the cpu fan, what does it do? The other half is a bad mtrbd. or component holding down the system. tada -----Willy

You can get them for a couple of dollars at flea markets and used electronic parts stores. Just something to test the motherboard and chipset. The Mobo will recognize any VGA thats working. In answer to your original question yes your PCI-E card should work to test this as well.
