1.1.1	I decided it's time to get a new PC and thought it would be a good idea to build one rather than buy one pre-built to save money.	St
1.1.2	I looked on newegg.com and found some parts and I'm not sure if they're compatible or not, and none of my friends know.	St
1.1.3	I was hoping someone would be able to tell me if they are and point me to compatible ones if they're not.	St
1.1.4	And would I need a better power supply with this case?	St

1.2.1	Everything looks to be in order.	St
1.2.2	I assume you know that you need a HDD, and an ODD unless you have a USB one.	St
1.2.3	Also, the sound card is large, so watch your case size.	St
1.2.4	A mini tower might be too small.	St
1.2.5	Everything else looks good.	St
