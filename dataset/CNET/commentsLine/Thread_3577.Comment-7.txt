which particular items on the list doesn't it meet?
i think the windows 8 pro tablet will be outside of my price range.
also, someone at work has the asus tablet with windows rt and hasn't had a lot of great things to say about it.
the hardware is nice, but they said that windows rt is pretty limited.
so, i'm somewhat skeptical about the windows tablets.
thanks!
