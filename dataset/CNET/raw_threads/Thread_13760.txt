It should also give detailed reports on the cpu installed and how it is being set/configured if applicable. If the cpu is in &quot;hand&quot; find the number and look it up at the support websites of the manufacturer. Some 3rd party pgms. may also provide similar info but not as full or complete. -----Willy

Go here http://processorfinder.intel.com/scripts/default.asp to locate the processor you are curious about then check the sSpec page for the info. The sSpec is a 5 character code on the processor and this link shows where it generally is located http://support.intel.com/support/processors/sspec/p4p.htm
