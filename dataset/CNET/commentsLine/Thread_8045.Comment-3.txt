do you leave your car running or shut it off?
the worst thing that you can do to your car is start it!
the worst thing you can do to a diesel engine, is start it.
so, do you leave it running?
of course not.
how long do you want that hard drive to last?
do you like the information you now have on that hard drive?
of course you do.
shut down when you are not using, it is just wise investment!
also, shutting down allows your computer to reconfigure when it starts up.
your computer is not human - it doesn't know whether 24 hours have past or 5 minutes have past by.
sure the clock knows, but it doesn't tell the rest of the system this knowledge.
the computer is a machine, pure and simple!
the macintosh computer was made to restart and shut down.
so is the pc.
have you ever noticed the people who tell you to leave it on are also people who sell computer parts?
humm, wonder if there is any correlation there?
as for electrical spikes, how many of you use a electrical device to protect your system?
this same device also protects against spikes!
read the directions and you'll know this.
and this means you mac users too!
read the directions, you can actually learn something!
my phone line is protected, it protects my modem and it too is protected from spikes.
which i should add, the only time you will ever get a spike of electrical power coming into your home or your computer is after the power company has lost power and they turn the power back on, there is a surge of electricity, this is called a spike.
obviously the writer &quot;sdleggett&quot; is not aware of what a true spike is.
