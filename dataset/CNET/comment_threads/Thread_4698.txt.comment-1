I recently replaced the motherboard in my system and when i hook everything back up, I get an error that NTLDR can't open multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1).
I know for a fact that absolutely nothing happened to the hard disk during transition, so i really don't think it could be a hardware problem, can anyone maybe point me in the right direction?
-Motherboard is a socket 754 Nvidia Nforce 3-a w/ Athlon 64-bit 3700+ -Drive is a Samsung 160GB SATA disk.
-Windows XP Pro SP2 -2 GB DDR 400 RAM Any thoughts or assitance would be appreciated.
Thanks.
