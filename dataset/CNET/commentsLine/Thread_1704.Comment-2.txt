...looks ominous!
maybe that model only got one sale?
judging from reviews such as :  sony uses a massive amount power, and like all things with a big name badge, it likely doesn't come with an over specified psu .
in other words, it already uses a lot of power, and the psu it comes with will not be an expensive model with a massive overhead for a huge 3d upgrade.
huge?
the graphics card you're after requires more power than any other option which is likely to be doomed to failure in a ynos pc:  you'd only be compounding possible problems, and you might have to consider a psu upgrade, which may or may not (the latter is more likely) be an option.
or you could opt for a graphics card which doesn't draw so much power.
no doubt with a trendy ynos, something as horrible (even though it works) as this would be out of the question too :  good luck in your endeavours though, gb.
