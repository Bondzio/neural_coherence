<s> I just installed a new 120gb drive into my XP machine. </s>
<s> My old hard drive, which I copied to the new drive using Copy Commander, was a 13gb with only a few hundred mb of space left. </s>
<s> My problem is, the new drive is only being acknowledged as an almost full 13gb drive, My system is now slower than ever and acting exactly like it would with a very full hard drive. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Actually, I used Ghost 2002 (an older version, but works with XP NTFS and all that...) to do the copy and if one wasn't careful, the resulting partition would be the same as the old drive. </s>
<s> I do not have Copy Commander and it sounds like Copy Commander just copied the partitions as they were. </s>
<s> Try again? </s>
<s> BOb </s>
