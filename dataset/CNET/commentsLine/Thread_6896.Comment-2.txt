the 5450 is a great little card but for games and cad work i'd rather see you pick from the list.
here's the link.
even the sub 100 cards blow away that 5450. the psu is ok but if this was mine i'd pass it up for a psu with a single 12v rail to avoid headaches.
there is another issue looming here.
will the designer of this thing tell you exactly how to install windows properly?
i find many install windows and then complain about performance.
too many times i have found them with a windows clean install and using microsoft's subpar driver update buttons.
