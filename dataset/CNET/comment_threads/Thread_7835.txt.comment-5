I called D-Link, and they said it would handle Windows 98 (but then again, I was talking to a very aggressive salesperson!).
He claims I should get the G-120, instead of the 122, as the former goes to 54 Mbps, and the 122 only goes to 11Mbps.
I asked him if I even needed more than 11, given my wife only uses the net for checking email, and the very rare browsing session.
He said yes, because it would ensure less dropped connections...He also strongly recommended the DI-624 router, because they will be apparently shortly discontinuing the DI-514...your thoughts?
thanks again, in advance, for your advice.
