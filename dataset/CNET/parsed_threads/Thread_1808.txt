<s> First of all hello there everyone. </s>
<s> I wasn't sure where to put this but as i'm 100% positive that it's hardware related and not XP problem i'll do it here. </s>
<s> So, my problem is as following : My PC restarts itself every once in a while. </s>
<s> At least it used to in past week or so, until last 2 days, when it started to restart only a few secs after windows would load, so i decided to reformatt and put a fresh XP copy. </s>
<s> It would be great if i could force it to finish damn win XP installation, as it would simply restart in the middle of process. </s>
<s> Sometimes at 25 mins left, other times at 10... once it even managed to get to 3 mins left and it crashed... ;/ I'm not a total newb in PC's area but i'm not a pro either. </s>
<s> After 2 painful days i installed a fresh XP copy on my friends comp (i finished it on my comp of course), so i can rule out that it's HDD problem. </s>
<s> So far i've tried replacing the power supply, graphics card, ram, HDD, heck, even CD/DVD-drives. </s>
<s> And every time that XP installation would stop at some random percent. </s>
<s> On my friends PC it was done without any problems, but as soon as i brought my disk home first restart happened, after some 10 mins of work. </s>
<s> Honestly, i have no idea what could be causing this, as only things i haven't checked are my mobo and CPU and i'm not really sure if that's what could cause problems... as far as i could see, googling and checking forums like this one is that it's usually caused by bad ram/power supply or rarely by broken HDD... my CPU temp is ok, i can already rule out any drivers/software related problems as it was restarting even when i had absolutely no software installed (in the middle of XP installation, on freshly formatted HDD)... so all in all i'm completely lost and no idea what to do... Any help would be greatly appreciated (if i ever manage to log in again lol, i'll prolly have to check out for responses from my friends place). </s>
<s> Ah and now it's working ok for almost an hour (it restarted only once when i tried to download Mozilla so for now i'm not dling anything). </s>
<s> Cheers and many thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Ah and it just restarted itself right after i finished with that post. </s>
<s> Just to add some info when i'm already typing this ... </s>
<s> It's XP SP2 (doesn't really matter because it was happenening even without any OS installed). </s>
<s> Ah and my CPU is a Celeron 2,93 (and it was working fine for 2yrs or so) I've tried to clean it's cooler, which doesn't seem to help either. </s>
<s> It was working fine for 2 years, without signs of overheating but who knows... it's temp is around 50C most of the time, if we can trust fanspeed or whatever program i was using before i formatted it. </s>
<s> Sadly i can't dl it right now as my pc would crash again -.- And checking its temp in bios wouldn't help because it's not using that much % anyways, when in bios. </s>
<s> What's even funnier 2 days ago i could play games without problems (IF pc starts at all and doesn't restart in first few mins) and everything was ok, but it would simply restart when browsing web or just leaving it idle... ah and it restarted all the time using flash video... not flash sites, just watching flash videos... </s>
<s> I feel like watching a bad horror movie where people are trying to figure out what's happening but everyone is left in the dark 'till the end of it ;o) I'm just left clueless right now... :/ Cheers </s>
<s> base thoroughly, clean the CPU heat spreader, apply new thermal paste and see how much that does to eliminate the problem random restart problem. </s>
<s> You can always leave the side off to minimize any heat buildup until you get the problem solved. </s>
<s> Good Luck. </s>
