I have checked Tom's website and have been watching prices for a while waiting for a &quot;jump in&quot; point. I mean you kind of just have to take a leap eventually right? Theres always something bigger and better next month. Plus I want to get one before Vista becomes standard equipment. I don't know about the rest of you, but I don't trust the new operating system to not be buggy as all hell. So I mostly do basic surfing, but would like to do some gaming again like possibly World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, Flight Sim X, Football Manager (used to be Championship Manager), and probably be able to play most games for another couple years. So I was thinking either a X2 4200+ or E6300 with 1GB and Dual 7600GT cards. I might spend a bit more on the 6400 if I go Intel, but Cyberpower has better deals on the Athlons. So I was wondering if anyone out in the &quot;field&quot; has any real world experience with either of these chips and how they would perform. Looking at a 3DMark score is great, but lets be subjective for a second. Thanks

My budget is probably lower than yours ($750), I've done some research on video cards and I found that one 7950GT is much better than two 7600GT's. It'll cost you the same amount of money to get one of those if you consider all the components you won't need like a better power supply. SLi Setup (Two 7600's): 1. The two 7600's (250ish) 2. Power Supply (20 more than a normal one for sli support) Around $280 One 7950GT KO Superclocked: 1. Video Card (280) Around $250 Basically, I'd go for the second option b/c you'd get more bang for your buck. Here's a link to the 7950GT KO Superclocked: http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2541397&CatId=1826

And for the cpu's, I would go with the Core 2 b/c of it's solid performance with better graphics cards. Better cpu's tend to work better with th faster video cards, you'll even see a 40-50 fps increase with the Core 2 compared to the Athlon X2, trust me.
