My C: drive has 74Gb NTFS but has only 15 GB left, but my D: drive has 55GB free out of 65GB. What do I need to do to utilise all my disk space and still access my files as if they were on C:?

So you would have to go to another drive. It's transparent if you move a folder like My Documents (via its right click properties) that you don't access via a drive-letter. But for all other files - after moving the folder - you'll notice the drive they are on is different. But that's only a minor difference. Don't move files from - the root folder - program files - windows - other folders than My Documents in your profile Kees Kees

Save your data to any media(CD/DVD) of installed pgms. besides the OS and its default pgms. Once done and proper, de-install pgms., reboot and then re-install in drive &quot;D&quot;. You can then swap data to the new location, etc.. Once done, you've free-up space. However, just buying a new HD that say 250GB, to replace your drive &quot;C&quot;. Then use its own manufacturer's provided s/w can transfer the whole old to new HD, then remove old HD entirely. You gain more space and the system is more capable. In fact, get a real large HD and replace both old drives, as a 250gb and larger is very common now, easily outstrips a 80 or 70gb old drive. Buying a new HD is pretty simple with manufacturer's s/w involved and using the instructions. Review them at support websites to see what's involved. tada -----Willy

It does what needs to be done to move the location of installed files in Win XP. Have been using it for years without any problem. Ramesh
