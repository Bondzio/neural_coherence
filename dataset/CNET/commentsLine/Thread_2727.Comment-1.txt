hi there, my router seems to be frozen with all lights on.
with power cord in, i tried resetting per the dlink website, but after several seconds of holding the reset button in, it stays frozen.
i also tried something called a &quot;recovery reset&quot; and that didn't work either.
anyone have any ideas?
thanks!
