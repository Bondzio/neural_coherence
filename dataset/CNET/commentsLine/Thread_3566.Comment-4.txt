i think you're right.
i had my thinking backwards.
but i swore i had heard that a few years ago.
your answer was really helpful, though probably a little too advanced for my good never the less, everything i needed to know.
sorry about the double post.
i originally posted this last night and didn't get any responses, so i was thinking i had put it in the wrong forum (i've done this before) so i decided to repost.
thanks again!
