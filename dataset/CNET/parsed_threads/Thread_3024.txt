<s> I want to set up my home network to run a DLNA server for videos, music, etc. </s>
<s> I know that there are many new routers and NAS devices out there that now have the capability to run a DLNA server built-in. </s>
<s> My question is, which would provide a better DLNA server: one that is built into the router or one that is built into the NAS device? </s>
<s> For now, I've yet to find folk HAPPY with DLNA. </s>
<s> Well there is one that frequents the forums but I suspect they are here to disagree at times. </s>
<s> To answer your question you would have to test both and see if they deliver what you expected. </s>
<s> For example, many expected fast forward and rewind to work but (surprise? </s>
<s> ), that's not in the basic DLNA specs. </s>

<s> If you're looking for a server to store your media, then you need a DLNA certified NAS. </s>
<s> A router can be DLNA certified, but has no storage capabilities and can't act as a server. </s>
<s> A router can very easily become a dlna server if it has a usb port for external drives. </s>
<s> USB3 works well with 802.11n wifi - you wont get much better unless you use a wired gigabit setup...but do you really want the clutter? </s>
<s> I use the netgear N600 ADSL2+ router/modem, with my bravia and boxee (on older tv) - I have no complaints. </s>
<s> Why dont I use a NAS - getting a decent NAS is too costly to be feasible. </s>
