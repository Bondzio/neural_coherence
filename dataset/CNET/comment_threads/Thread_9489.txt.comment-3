I have a Dell Optiplex GX280.
It is 3.2 GHz, 2GB ddr2 ram, XP Pro SP3.
I want to replace my CD drive with a DVD burner.
My CD drive is a Samsung SC-148A, and I'm pretty sure it is IDE.
I am looking at the Lite-On IHAP422-08.
It has the features I want, and is okay with the size, and system requirements, but I don't know if the PATA connection is right.
Do you need any other info?
Thanks
