agree with the moderator, post is vague but, start with the minimum and be sure you do not have conflicts in your bios (e.g.
onboard video vs. card video, other such conflicts).
everything is basic until the o/s starts analyzing what you have and that's when conflicts cause problems.
make sure the cdrom and hard drive are not in contention (master / slave) if on same cable.
make sure settings on motherboard are correct.
are you upgrading or a new install.
so many possibilities.
