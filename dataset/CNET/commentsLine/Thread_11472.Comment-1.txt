my computer was dropped and the frame bent.
a friend gave me his, older one, until i can fix mine.
here's the prob: his computer's hard drive has some sort of virus or spyware prob that is causing rundll32 and explorer ipf errors and i simply can't think any more to resolve.
i used to know much more about puters, but have suffered brain injury which cause difficulties so....i need help remembering...step-by-step...how to install my hard drive into his computer.
his hard drive has win98se on it, but mine has winxp.
can i somehow keep both hard drives?
that would be preferable as i would then re-format his to clean up the prob.
if not, then i'll just pull his and replace it with mine.
so...help please, with easy, step-by-step directions?
thank you
