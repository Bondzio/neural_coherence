<s> Recently, my computer had to move from where it was living right next to, and ethernet cabled into, the wireless router (Linksys g) to another room across the house. </s>
<s> The walls are extremely thick and everything from wireless telephones to baby monitors have trouble. </s>
<s> I purchased a usb wireless adapter for the computer and while it works, it is quite marginal. </s>
<s> It has a lot of trouble maintaining a connection to the router and when it does, it's a very slow one. </s>
<s> My question is, how best to maximize the throughput? </s>
<s> Would I be better off with a PCI card inside the computer, or stay with the usb? </s>
<s> At least with the usb I can get a long cord and snake it closer to the door where the connection is slightly better. </s>
<s> But if I can avoid having wires I'd like to do that. </s>
<s> Is there something intrinsically stronger about a PCI setup than a usb one? </s>
<s> I'd go with a USB adapter, With USB you can extend the USB cable and adapter to where you get the best signal. </s>
<s> A PCI card with fixed antenna is fine for nearby stations. </s>
