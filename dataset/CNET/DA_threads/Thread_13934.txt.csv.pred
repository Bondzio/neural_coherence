1.1.1	hey everyone, i have a computer that is not working and i have no idea what to do.	St
1.1.2	i was mad the other day so i kicked the computer.	St
1.1.3	not hard or anything just enough to put a smll dent in it.	St
1.1.4	its a hp desktop.	St
1.1.5	it doesnt have the orig hard drive in it or ram.	St
1.1.6	when turned on both the hard drives click like crazy and it will not boot.	St
1.1.7	im not sure if it boots or not since no video is showing on the moniter it just says video cable connected?	Res
1.1.8	so i dont know if it boots or not.	St
1.1.9	it has onboard video.	St
1.1.10	i have a 40G HDD in it and an 80G HDD in it.	St
1.1.11	they both click like hell when started.	St
1.1.12	opened on of then up and the disk spins but after a while of the arm moving back and forth while clicking it stops spinning.	St
1.1.13	i tapped it a few times and now it will continue spinning until i shut it off.	St
1.1.14	are these hard drives shot?	St
1.1.15	i mean i know there probly shot there old, but can i get files off of them and what not?	St
1.1.16	if it is the just video will these drives even boot like that?	St
1.1.17	im putting in a pci/agp video card later to see if that is the problem.	St
1.1.18	these HDDs are formatted with windows xp, can i put these in my g4 mac to get files off of?	St
1.1.19	or do i need to put them in a windows computer to back up?	St
1.2.1	A kick that dents a PC case isn't a small one and opening a hard drive to troubleshoot it is an almost certain kiss of death.	St
1.2.2	I'd say to evaluate the damage and see what's salvageable you'd need to do such one component at a time using another PC to test them.	St
1.2.3	I doubt you're clicking hard drives are going to be recognizable on any PC, however.	St
1.2.4	There are data recovery services available.	St
1.2.5	I can't say how much they charge but it may be more then the cost of an entire PC and with no guarantee of complete success.	St
1.3.1	If you have another PC that can handle the same components that is the way to go.	St
1.3.2	I do that often but just be carefull one bad component can do other damage to your system.	St
1.3.3	If the computer did not get kicked on the side the MB is on it might not be that bad.	St
1.3.4	Cables would be the first thing I would check Then The CPU or check for a cracked MB.	St
1.3.5	It take a bit to damage a HD.	St
1.3.6	Key components 1) MB 2) CPU If Those Components or OK the PC is repairable	St
1.4.1	the computer got kicked in the front with the cd drive getting most of the damage.	St
1.4.2	MB was removed as well as CPU the whole thing was cleaned.	St
1.4.3	runs perfect.	St
1.4.4	no damage at all except for the cd drive.	Res
1.4.5	both hard drives recognize in the bios but neither will boot.	St
1.4.6	i brought them in to a local computer place and they tested them and said that they were none responsive and shot, but i dont belive this as it was a free test, nd they were trying to get me to spend money so that they could do further tests.	St
1.4.7	the drives are not unresponsive since they recognize in the computer.	St
1.4.8	i just need to repair the OS with the disk.	St
1.4.9	i put them in a really old pc i have and it said disk boot failure insert disk.	St
1.4.10	the disk i had wouldnt work i think i burned it wrong, and this pc could not have two hard drives for some reason as it would start for a second and shut off and then when i unplpugged one of them it would start.	St
1.4.11	so idk its weird but im working on it.	St
1.4.12	i think what i will do is get a sata controller and use a 320 notebook hdd in it.	St
1.4.13	and of course upgrade to maybe 1gb of ram from 512mb	St
