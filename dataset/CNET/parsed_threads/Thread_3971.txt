<s> I'm still trying to figure out why my computer crashes. </s>
<s> Sometimes when it freezes it starts beeping a constant beep until I finally have to turn it off or reset it. </s>
<s> What could this mean? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Some BIOS will emit a beep-beep or siren when the CPU or other sensor is too hot. </s>
<s> Why is your post so slim on details? </s>
<s> Did you try it with the cover off? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yeah right now I'm running it with the cover off. </s>
<s> If I put the cover back on the case will vibrate and the fan will make a loud buzzing noise. </s>
<s> My computer basically crashes out of nowhere unpredictably, even while idle. </s>
<s> I've checked the system health in bios and the cpu temp is only around 47-49C. </s>
<s> I'm still trying to figure out why my computer crashes and which piece of hardare is causing this. </s>
<s> Also, its been crashing on my old system too which is why I replaced the CPU, motheboard and memory, and it still does it. </s>
<s> The only thing I havent replaced for a long time is my hard drive, but I ran the manufacturers utility did burn in tests and such and it says the hard drive is error free. </s>
<s> Also, crashing either gives a blue screen just saying &quot;the system has halted, contact your hardware vendor&quot; or it just plain freezes while im doing something and I try to click on a window and it gets stuck and I have to reset, other times it beeps a constant beep when it freezes, so I'm thinking that might mean something... </s>
