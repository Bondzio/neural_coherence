8030	0	161347	1789278	NR	dflrm2	3/5/06 10:29 AM	1.14155454E12	Packet Loss	I have been trying to find the source of Packet Loss between my computer and another PC IP address. I am able to Ping and Tracert to this address all OK without any problems showing up. However, when I use Pathping to determine if there is any packet loss along the 11 Hop route, the output information shows 100% Loss at hops 5 through 9, even though the target IP shows 0% Loss. Are the 5 routers blocking the Pathping test? Is there any way to get Pathing to work normally? Here are the results of Ping, Tracert, and Pathping: ping 24.189.11.202 Pinging 24.189.11.202 with 32 bytes of data: Reply from 24.189.11.202: bytes=32 time=23ms TTL=118 Reply from 24.189.11.202: bytes=32 time=22ms TTL=118 Reply from 24.189.11.202: bytes=32 time=17ms TTL=118 Reply from 24.189.11.202: bytes=32 time=17ms TTL=118 Ping statistics for 24.189.11.202: Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss), Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds: Minimum = 17ms, Maximum = 23ms, Average = 19ms tracert 24.189.11.202 Tracing route to ool-18bd0bca.dyn.optonline.net [24.189.11.202] over a maximum of 30 hops: 1 5 ms 5 ms 5 ms 10.22.152.1 2 7 ms 6 ms 5 ms vl4.aggr1.nyw.ny.rcn.net [209.122.64.225] 3 7 ms 7 ms 5 ms ge3-0.border3.nyw.ny.rcn.net [207.172.15.68] 4 6 ms 7 ms 6 ms r3-ge2-1.in.nycmny83.cv.net [198.32.118.17] 5 8 ms 6 ms 5 ms r1-srp1-1.in.nycmny83.cv.net [65.19.97.97] 6 8 ms 7 ms 7 ms 451be0a2.cst.lightpath.net [65.19.96.162] 7 15 ms 13 ms 13 ms 65.19.111.204 8 10 ms 9 ms 10 ms opti39-6.nassau.cv.net [167.206.39.6] 9 18 ms 16 ms 15 ms ubr101-ge1-0-0.cmts.soldny.cv.net [167.206.39.41] 10 17 ms 18 ms 19 ms ool-18bd0bca.dyn.optonline.net [24.189.11.202] 11 21 ms 15 ms 17 ms ool-18bd0bca.dyn.optonline.net [24.189.11.202] Trace complete. pathping -n 24.189.11.202 Tracing route to 24.189.11.202 over a maximum of 30 hops 0 207.237.2.133 1 10.22.152.1 2 209.122.64.225 3 207.172.15.68 4 198.32.118.17 5 65.19.97.97 6 65.19.96.162 7 65.19.111.204 8 167.206.39.6 9 167.206.39.41 10 24.189.11.202 11 24.189.11.202 Computing statistics for 275 seconds...

Instead I get a facetious reply. You surely do not expect the ISP to change their configuration for me? I would suggest that if you do not have a practical answer to a problem, do not respond at all. This is my first experience with CNET Forums. Needless to say I am very disappointed.

I hope you understand this well enough so you don't jump off, format your PC in hopes of fixing it. Cheers, Bob
