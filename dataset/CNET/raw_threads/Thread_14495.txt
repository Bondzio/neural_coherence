When I go to open one off the internal or external Drives even C drive it opens onother folder, instead off using The My computer folder to open one off the drives. What is wrong has somthing to do with the My Computer folder even though what happened made changes to my other folder that I already corrected. Wendell H

I also uninstalled the software for my Maxtor one touch 4 750 I do not need all that extra features I just need a external drive. It took me 4 hours to transfer My Downloaded Movies from one my first external to the new external. And I saw and extra set off Movies and I deleted them and then I did not see the first set. I have to start all over again. Thank You Very Much: Wendell H
