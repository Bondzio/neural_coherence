1.1.1	My desktop PC has two units of 256MB DDRAM - which was pretty good at the time the machine was built .	St
1.1.2	But I 'm thinking about upgrading , now that I could quadruple that amount of memory for probably $ 200 .	St
1.1.3	So my question is , what kind of performance increase can I reasonably expect for that kind of upgrade ?	Ques
1.1.4	I realize there are many factors in play here , but for those who have upgraded memory , have you found it to be a worthwhile expense ?	Ques
1.1.5	Or should I wait until prices drop ?	Ques
1.1.6	Just wondering if this is worth my while .	St
1.1.7	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	We took identical 2.4GHz P4 machines and ran a test .	St
1.2.2	1 had 512MB , the other was 1GB .	St
1.2.3	A 6 hour video encoding took 5 minutes less on the machine with 1GB .	St
1.2.4	To be fair we exchanged the memory sticks and reran the test .	St
1.2.5	About 5 minute savings .	St
1.2.6	For us , that was not enough payback .	St
1.2.7	But then again , the bragging rights may be worth it ?	Ques

1.3.1	If you typically have a lot of apps open or use memory intensive apps , additional memory can noticeably improve performance .	St
1.3.2	When you have your usual apps open and you 've been using them for awhile , open task manager ( right click an empty area of the task bar ) , select the Performance tab , and compare your Commit Charge : Total and : Peak to Physical Memory : Total .	St
1.3.3	( These figures are in kilobytes/KB ; divide by 1024 to get megabytes/MB . )	St
1.3.4	If your Commit Charge : Total ( how much memory you 're consuming currently ) is more than your Physical Memory : Total , then I 'd definitely recommend more RAM since you 're using all your RAM and spilling over into the page file .	St
1.3.5	If your Commit Charge : Peak ( the peak memory used since Windows started ) is extremely high compared to your Commit Charge : Total and exceeds Physical Memory : Total , then some software app you 've used is very memory intensive ( i.e .	St
1.3.6	: a game , photoshop , custom business software , etc . ) .	St
1.3.7	Additional memory will speed up that app , but if you 're satisfied with the app 's performance or only use it occassionally , an upgrade may not be worth while .	St
1.3.8	If you 're wondering where your memory is going , look at the Processes tab in task manager .	St
1.3.9	Click Mem Usage to sort .	St
1.3.10	On my PC currently , IE ( 6 windows ) is consuming about 100MB , Firefox another 70MB , and Acrobat Reader another 65MB .	St
1.3.11	Even common every-day apps can munch RAM .	St
