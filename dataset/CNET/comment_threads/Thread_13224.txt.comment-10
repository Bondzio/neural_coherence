that the mobo power turn on logic circuit has failed.
The main rails of an ATX supply are turned on when the mobo puts a logic low on pin 14 of the power supply to mobo connector [pin 16 on a 24 pin power connector].
Thus, I would suspect that the circuit in the mobo has failed in the low state [or of course, a failure of the supply's control circuit inside the supply could fail and cause the same indications].
The ATX power supply can be turned on while sitting on a table in its box by simply plugging the supply into a hot outlet and connecting pin 14 of its mobo connector to any one of the pins in the same connector that has a black wire [ground, common, return, you name it].
Thus if the power supply had the failure internally the supply would turn on by simply plugging it in to a hot outlet [the connector to the mobo unplugged].
If it doesn't turn on under that condition the problem is the mobo connection to pin 14.
When not connected to the mobo the fact that the supply turned on is noted simply by noting that its' fan is rotatiing.
Seems that this simple problem has been around way too long.
