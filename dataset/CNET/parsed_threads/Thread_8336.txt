<s> Hi, I need to create a system with this configurations: I have 3 hd monitors placed in vertical mode 1080x1920 I need to show on the 3 monitors 3 web browser (I don't care which operating system) I need to connect to internet the system ONLY with a usb o pcmca modem umts/hdspa (becouse I do not have the possibility to connect the system to a lan) I need to remote access to the system maybe with Hamachi or others. </s>
<s> I need to auto power on the pc and to controll the bios to change the time to power on the pc remotely. </s>
<s> (I find that to auto power on the pc is there a config called Power on by RTC Alarm and so I needto config this maybe with a system like this -&gt; http://www.delltechcenter.com/page/Dell+Client+Configuration+Utility+3.0 ) What others people suggest to me is to buy 1 pc with 2 video cards that support 1080x1920 resolution or to buy 3 mini pc and connect one with the modem and share the connection to the other 2 but for the other needs that I have I do not found someone that suggest me something good for all. </s>
<s> Can you provide me a solution for my needs? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> A company named Sewell has USB video cards that let you add many such displays. </s>
<s> Since we know the web browsers do this, we don't have to discuss the software end. </s>
<s> Sorry I can't provide a solution. </s>
<s> But you can buy it and it should be fine. </s>
