Through trial and error, and the proper software, I know how to burn MP3's to CD, and burn movies to DVD.
But I have a JVC in dash DVD player in my car and would like to burn MP3's to DVD since the capacity is much greater.
I am unsure which programs I could use.
I would appreciate any experience or recommendations on programs that will achieve this?
Thanks Much, Scott.
