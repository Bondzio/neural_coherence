i just got an acer ferrari laptop, and am trying to connect to my home wireless network.
i have a netgear router, and the ferrari sees the network, but when i try to connect to the network, it just says &quot;waiting for network.&quot; i have tried twiddling with all the network's features to try to get it to work, does anyone have any advice on how to solve this problem?
