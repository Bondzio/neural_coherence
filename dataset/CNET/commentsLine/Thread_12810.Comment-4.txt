first off, thats actually a pretty old cpu.
second off, its hard to find a motherboard with an am2+ socket nowadays since most of the motherboards being manufactured now are all, at least am3 so i guess my suggestion is to try and find a cpu that's more current thats compatible to a motherboard thats, also, more up to date.
if thats not the case, the you can try looking here:  ive looked at few, but theres not whole lot of am2+ selections out there.. better move fast on getting the motherboard before it become obsolete.
