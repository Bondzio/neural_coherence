I am lucky as the office is porting apps to Android so I have access to the Kindle Fire HD 7 and a Nexus 7.
Both play Amazon Instant Video just fine and I can get apps from both stores in the Nexus.
As to the blurry Amazon future the advice to developers is to go all in on the Kindle.
I'm unsure what is bothering you here.
We are not talking about deep investments.
