<s> I have a Maxtor 80 gb firewire drive that all of a sudden is not recognized by Windoiws XP. </s>
<s> I powered off and restarted and it was recognized, then the computer acted as though I had shut off the drive, which I hadn't. </s>
<s> Most of the time I restart the drive my computer won't recognize it though the lights are on indicating the drive is getting power. </s>
<s> Every few times my computer recognizes the drive for a second, then loses it. </s>
<s> Same scenario when I tried the drive on another computer. </s>
<s> Any ideas how I can at least run the drive long enough to move everything off to another drive? </s>
<s> Any ideas would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks Marc Berris marc@berrislaw.com </s>

<s> and try it connected internally to a desktop. </s>
<s> I have to confess: I'm not terribly handy when it comes to computer stuff. </s>
<s> How complicated is it to move the drive into another case with a different connection type? </s>
<s> Am I better leaving this to a professional? </s>
<s> Any insight (or warning) would be appreciated. </s>

<s> There is no jumper or other changes that I've found here. </s>
<s> Just open one box. </s>
<s> Unscrew a few things, pop the drive out of the old and into the next box. </s>
<s> If the case/interface is the issue, it should come right back. </s>
