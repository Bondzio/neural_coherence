<s> For the past 6 months, my memorex 80gb ultra traveldrive worked great. </s>
<s> When I pluged it in to my computer today (running Vista Ultimate), nothing happened. </s>
<s> I rebooted my computer, checked my device manager (where the device is corretly listed under disk drives), uninstalled and reinstalled the device and driver, and still nothing. </s>
<s> I'm trying to access the drive using Windows Explorer to pull files as normal. </s>
<s> I noticed an odd clicking or popping sound when I pluged in the drive that I don't remember hearing before. </s>
<s> The drive is an Ultra Traveldrive (TD) v1.0. </s>
<s> I have made no changes to my computer or Vista (except for maybe automatic updates). </s>
<s> Any ideas are appreciated. </s>
<s> If the &quot;clicking noise&quot; is very audible you may have a HD fault. </s>
<s> Its a h/w problem and no amount of s/w will fix it. </s>
<s> I suggest you use whatever &quot;diags&quot; the support website has and check it out. </s>
<s> If you have any warranty, use it before it expires. </s>
<s> If not and you want to, open ext. </s>
<s> case and mount HD(may need an adapter) in order to try to retrieve data. </s>
<s> You should try using a rear USB port if using a frt. </s>
<s> panel one. </s>
<s> Try also another system using rear USB port. </s>
<s> Do all this, what are your results? </s>

<s> I pulled the cover and peeled the warranty sticker (I don't care about the warranty at this point). </s>
<s> Inside is a card connected to the harddrive case. </s>
<s> The audible sounds are louder (duh) with the case removed. </s>
<s> No change when connecting to the laptop. </s>
<s> Should I open up the harddrive case now and direct connect somehow? </s>
<s> By the way, all USB ports on this worthless Lenovo are on the side. </s>
<s> All input is appreciated. </s>
