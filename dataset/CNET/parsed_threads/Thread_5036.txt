<s> As moderator Bob Proffitt says: hard disks are temporary storage. </s>
<s> I get the impression you thought it was permanent storage. </s>
<s> It isn't. </s>
<s> That's why we make a backup copy for the &quot;important data&quot; (and, in fact, that's most data). </s>

<s> It sounds like you have corrupted your volumes. </s>
<s> It could be due to a failure of the operating system, a virus or an errant program. </s>
<s> There is an outside chance that it is the result of sector drop out. </s>
<s> Sector drop out occurs when the drive has bad sectors replaced by spares from the bad sector list function. </s>
<s> If you can't get it back, you can reach me at info@drivelabs.us Our website is http://www.drivelabs.us We are a data recovery lab. </s>
