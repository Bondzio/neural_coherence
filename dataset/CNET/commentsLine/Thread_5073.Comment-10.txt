if you tried to install windows xp on another partition and, it wouldn't load then either your bios needs to be reset or more likely, i think the problem is where i started in the beginning.
the processor or heatsink fan is not seated right or you are over heating.
there is a cmos jumper on your mainboard.
your motherboard i mean.
it will be shown in the book that came with the board.
there are 3 pins with a plastic cap over 2 of the pins.
the cap is the jumper.
it is small.
refer to your book to see where exactly it is on the board.
all you need to do is move the cap to pins 1 and 2 for a few seconds and then put the cap back on pins 2 and 3. turn off your power to your computer but don't unplug from the back.
the 3 pronged plug is a ground.
also hold on to the metal frame with one hand to stay grounded.
this prevents static which can harm your computer.
after you try sp2 try to reset cmos which is part of your bios.
i want you to do this to reset the configurations mostly for your memory.
reseting the cmos setting by the jumper will clear the bios memory and set it to default.
hope you can understand this.
if not let me know and we will take it one step at a time.
