1.1.1	When it comes to a new desktop , do you build or buy ?	Ques
1.1.2	- I build it myself .	St
1.1.3	( Please explain why you do it . )	Sug
1.1.4	- I have someone else build it to my specs .	St
1.1.5	( Why not do it yourself ? )	Ques
1.1.6	- I buy it preconfigured , right off the shelf .	St
1.1.7	( If youknew how , would you build one yourself ? )	Ques
1.1.8	- I buy it online , but customize the configuration .	St
1.1.9	( If you knew how , would you build one yourself ? )	Ques
1.1.10	- Other .	St
1.1.11	( What do you do ? )	Ques
1.2.1	I prefer to build my own system , because that way i not only have a say in what goes into the system , but also what size and type of case I want .	St
1.2.2	I know that if I build the best possible hardware will be in my computer , and it also makes upgrading so much easier .	St
1.2.3	... but , there are times when buying might be the way to go .	St
1.2.4	For example , if I rather not have a desktop or tower at all , I would just buy an iMac or Sony L-Series .	St
1.2.5	I actually purchased a Sony Vaio L-Series last week because I wanted a touchscreen system to play around with Windows 8 , and I did n't want a bulky tablet .	St
1.3.1	I have built several computers for myself .	St
1.3.2	In this way , I have control over the quality of each piece .	St
1.3.3	But the downside of building your computer , for me , is that you have to throw down over a hundred dollars for Windows unless you can live with Linux .	St
1.3.4	Unless you buy the super-expensive retail version of Windows , you ca n't reinstall it just anytime you get the urge .	St
1.3.5	Bad !	St
1.3.6	Unacceptable !	St
1.3.7	What I like to do these days is to get a little bit older Dell computer and either erase the hard drive or put in a new drive and install Windows XP Professional .	St
1.3.8	With the Dell Reinstallation disk , I can reinstall whenever I get the urge .	St
1.3.9	And I can put onto whichever hard drive the software that I choose .	St
1.3.10	If I do n't like the installed video card , it is n't really expensive or difficult to get a different one and install it .	St
1.3.11	Same for other pieces , such as sound cards , card readers , DVD-RW , etc .	St
1.3.12	For me , the prebuilt computer is the way I choose to go , due to the exorbitant cost of buying retail versions of Microsoft WIndows .	St
1.3.13	Too bad you ca n't install YOUR operating system that you paid a bunch of money for into all of your systems !	St
1.4.1	NOW you all know WHY there is so much software piracy .	St
1.4.2	Microsoft screw $ everyone .	St
1.4.3	There is absolutely NO REASON WHY Microsoft should be charging sky high prices for a retail copy of Windows when Manufacturers may as little as $ 30 per license .	St
1.4.4	This is EXACTLY why I am against any form of software piracy prevention .	St
1.4.5	I can not in good conscience want to eliminate piracy so that Microsoft or any other 'copyright ' owner can get even richer off my back .	St
1.4.6	Note ; I do legally own my copies of XP .	St
1.4.7	I bought them from a local computer store .	St
1.4.8	Now , buying is a lot cheaper than building .	St
1.4.9	However , buy makes things far too limited for me .	St
1.4.10	You can not upgrade when needed .	St
1.4.11	You are limited on junk motherboards with very few memory slots or slots filled with cheap small modules that you must toss if you want more memory .	St
1.4.12	You are also stuck with all the crapware that the manufacturer wants to toss on there .	St
1.4.13	For years , many of the manufacturers made towers that did not conform to the ATX standard and you had to buy THEIR power supplies at ebay-kidney-selling-prices instead of reasonable prices at other places .	St
1.4.14	I build all my own .	St
1.4.15	I can swap parts , upgrade when I feel the need or have to , and take pride that I did something myself the way I want it .	St
1.4.16	On both my XP boxes I did numerous upgrades over the years .	St
1.4.17	Some because of hardware failures , others because I needed better equipment ( ca n't tell you how many video cards I went through because ALL OF THEM are junk ) .	St
1.4.18	So , on this box I normally use Linux about 99 % of the time .	St
1.4.19	The other 1 % of the time is because my spouse wasted a huge amount on money on Adobe and I want to make sure we get something for it .	St
1.4.20	And of course the occasional games that my 9 year old wants to play that are 'Windows ' Only ' .	St
1.4.21	So , if you want a killer box and have the money , build one and toss PCLinux on it ( or Mint ) .	St
1.4.22	Ubuntu is a huge bloated OS .	St
1.4.23	If you are lazy or cheap , then buy a budget box that is ready to go and plan on replacing it every 3 years .	St
1.5.1	I prefer to build my own .	St
1.5.2	I use forums such as CNET to obtain expert advice and suggestions on components and compatibility .	St
1.5.3	Then I get an experienced tech to install and hook up everything because I want the settings to be optimal and I 'm not confident in messing around in the BIOS .	St
1.5.4	Forums such as CNET are great when one needs expert advice and instructions .	St
1.6.1	About 5 years ago I bought my first laptop and a new desktop .	St
1.6.2	The laptop was for myself and desktop for everyone in the house .	St
1.6.3	Both are Dell and I both went online and spoke with someone at Dell to help make choices for each .	St
1.6.4	My desktop needs to be upgraded and because it is rarely used I will NOT buy another for some time .	St
1.6.5	The laptop is an Inspiron E 1705 and I have Windows XP on it .	St
1.6.6	Years ago I did a survey for Microsoft and got to choose from their software , I chose the 2003 Windows Professional .	St
1.6.7	I have done several installs with it .	St
1.6.8	My laptop is VERY slow and I have been window shopping since last April for the perfect laptop for me .	St
1.6.9	While looking it became very clear ( I read MANY reviews ! )	St
1.6.10	that for me buying from Costco was the best option due to their extended warranty and 90 day return policy .	St
1.6.11	It does limit my choices a bit but I finally found one and ordered it on the 9th .	St
1.6.12	I did a custom build on Dell.com to compare prices and features .	St
1.6.13	So I am getting a Dell XPS 17 Intel Core i7-2670 QM 2.2 GHz with Blu-ray Triple Writer 1 GB NVIDIA Graphics and a 1 TB Hard drive .	St
1.6.14	It also comes with Microsoft Office Home/Student 2010 full version .	St
1.6.15	I think once a computer gets 5 to 6 years old its time to buy new just for the technology .	St
1.6.16	Good luck with your decision !	Polite
1.7.1	If you know what you are doing , than building your own desktop is THE WAY TO GO !	St
1.7.2	Why ?	Ques
1.7.3	There are 2 basic reason for this : 1 .	St
1.7.4	Because you get to choose the parts YOU want to put into the making of your custom machine .	St
1.7.5	2 .	St
1.7.6	Because YOU get to choose the software YOU want to put into the machine .	St
1.7.7	There is also a great sense of satisfaction and accomplishment when you build it yourself .	St
1.7.8	As for the cost , it 's a toss up , it can be cheaper , but not always !	St
1.7.9	I have noticed it is about even when I compare the cost of building to buying a premade PC .	St
1.7.10	I have built many computers for several people , including all the members of my whole family .	St
1.7.11	Once you do this and you see the sense of happiness it brings to others and yourself , well , it 's like having a cute , warm puppy cuddle up in your lap .	St
1.7.12	OK , maybe that 's a poor analogy , but it 'll do .	St
1.8.1	I put 'other ' .	St
1.8.2	I go to my trusty computer guy down the road and he makes it and I pay it .	St
1.8.3	I like it this way .	St
1.8.4	Oh , he also fixes it .	St
1.9.1	Usually i will buy a system already put together , in the last case i bought a ZT computer from Costco , that had a really good Mother board and chip set ( quad core at the time was state of the art , almost ) ..i dropped around six hundred bucks , mainly because it comes preloaded with lots costly software , then every time i got paid i would upgrade first the sound card ( Sound blaster w/5.1 ) then an Nvidia video card , a better power supply , RAM and so forth .	St
1.9.2	my intel experience rating is 5.9 and i can and do play the latest games and watch HD television and movies .	St
1.9.3	instead of a monitor i attached an HD projector and my entire wall is my screen .	St
1.9.4	i last upgraded my video and card last year , but ive had the same motherboard and chip set for , ..coming up on 4 years now .	St
1.9.5	oh and last fall i installed another 500 gigabyte hard drive .	St
1.9.6	plug and play..just that simple .	St
1.9.7	i hope that inspires you	St
1.10.1	I do all the research , and most the engineering and then have my desktop custom built .	St
1.10.2	I am replying to this question for those who need large ( or in my case-an Asus Supercomputer ) .	St
1.10.3	While most people do not need a computer with twin Zenon X5670s with 24 gigs of RAM with 1 gig per thread , there is software that can only be run on such a large system ie : 3D graphics using Vue 10 Infinite .	St
1.10.4	This is a totaly customized machine , built for high end graphics .	St
1.10.5	It is also outfitted with twin nVidia GTX 480s in SLI configuration .	St
1.10.6	With this much power , I would never attempt to build a computer like this .	St
1.10.7	It uses 28.5 amps of 110 volt electricity and costs about an extra 35 dollars ( US ) a month to use .	St
1.10.8	And to those that think this is overkill , even a fairly uncomplicated image ( 10 & quot ; long x 7 & quot ; tall @ 300 ppi ) takes an hour to render .	St
1.10.9	The point I 'm trying to make is , as your computer power needs increase , you can do the engineering ; but use an expert to build the computer .	St
1.10.10	Do n't risk your life or the life of your family to shave off a few dollars .	Sug
1.11.1	Being an ICT Technician I generally build my own or upgrade .	St
1.11.2	My main computer is in the same case I 've been using for the last 10 years ... but then it did cost me an arm and a leg to buy it with a view to future expansion ... and I 'm only just now looking for a replacement as it is a full tower and I need to downsize to a midi after moving to a smaller property and no longer having a seperate room for my computers .	St
1.11.3	Besides that , I like being able to choose what brands and parts I use to build it .	St
1.11.4	I see no point in putting in something I do n't use and I research each part for compatibility and reliability before buying .	St
1.11.5	Plus I prefer a solid workhorse of a processor with plenty of memory to the fastest ones out .	St
1.11.6	Being a tech I also need room for items such as a trayless hotswap bays ( sata and ide ) with adapters for 2.5 & quot ; drives but I now use an external floppy drive if and when I need it .	St
1.11.7	Plus I rather like pimping my case .	St
1.11.8	LOL !	St
1.12.1	I prefer to build myself .	St
1.12.2	I know the hardware AND software that goes into it , and I do n't have the troubles of uninstalling the bloatware that comes with a pre-built system .	St
1.12.3	It still takes a while to install the OS and other software I prefer , but it 's worth the effort .	St
1.13.1	When you build your own you get by far and away the best bang for the buck .	St
1.13.2	I built the machine I 'm typing on now -- a real screamer loaded to the gills -- for about $ 2,400 that outperforms units from Falcon Northwest or Alienware that would cost maybe $ 7,500 .	St
1.13.3	And you get to individually select all your components for your own needs and tastes .	St
1.13.4	Also , when you build your own , upgrading can be done with total confidence .	St
1.13.5	You already know right where everything goes .	St
1.13.6	And it 's fun .	St
1.13.7	& quot ; Let 's see ...	St
1.13.8	This wire goes here , and this one goes here ( etc .	St
1.13.9	times a hundred ) ... & quot ; It 's like doing a little , and surprisingly simple , jigsaw puzzle .	St
1.13.10	It 's simple because almost everything is generally clearly labeled on the case and the motherboard , and when it 's not ( like the plugs out of the power supply ) it usually has some kind of unique pin-out .	St
1.13.11	Also , there are a whole slew of more-or-less useful little tutorials all over YouTube .	St
1.13.12	And then there 's the satisfaction , that little twinge of nervousness before you plug it in and first throw the switch on the power supply and hit the system power button , followed by the wave of joy when everything works that first time & quot ; out of the box. & quot ; AAAAAAAAAAhhhhhhh !	St
1.13.13	And this is followed by the lasting joy of its blistering performance and your pride in having built it with your own hands .	St
1.13.14	I will never buy an off-the-shelf computer again in my life ( well , except maybe a laptop ) .	St
1.14.1	NIL	St
1.15.1	The number one thought on this has to be & quot ; What are you planning to do with the computer ? & quot ; This will dictate the software that you will need which in turn may very dictate the operating system that you need .	St
1.15.2	The software that you have now may not function on an advanced system .	St
1.15.3	Then you consider the amentties , what additional features do you need .	St
1.15.4	After all this is considdered , there is a possibiltiy that these features are available in a desktop for a good price , or one that you can adapt , If not , you still can build it , and if you have the knowledge , then it will actually be a better computer , but you will not save money over the mass manufacturering of todays products .	St
1.16.1	You did not specify as why Window8 ?	Ques
1.17.1	I 'd get a used box and gut it and start over .	St
1.17.2	Since 04 ' been a laptop guy .	St
1.17.3	Get non working and fix with max possible upgrade on mobo and maybe not cutting edge components but way less money .	St
1.17.4	Pick up a very good board and decent cpu and memory .	St
1.17.5	GPU 's are where the money goes for speed these days ...	St
1.17.6	Laptop GPU 's are limited by cooling but I find more fun to work on .	St
1.18.1	You mean why it might be better to buy for Windows 8 vs build ?	Ques
1.18.2	Windows 8 does better on a touch screen .	St
1.18.3	I 've tried the Developer Preview of Windows 8 on regular laptops ; however , it does n't seem much different than Windows 7 , and I think it 's because I 'm not getting the full user experience .	St
1.18.4	On the Vaio L , the touch screen actually makes it fun to use .	St
1.18.5	There 's really no way we can build our own tablets ( or else I would be happy , because the Windows tablets out there are either too bulky or underpowered ) , and touchscreen monitors just are n't so common - which is why I went with the Vaio L , but there are other options from HP , Samsung , and others .	St
1.18.6	Then you also have the group of people that just want an all-in-one , iMac-like , system .	St
1.18.7	Sure , there are bare bone kits out there , but they do n't look as elegant as the all-in-one systems made by Apple , Sony , Samsung , etc ...	St
1.19.1	This way , I have over all control the quality of the machine at my targeted budget .	St
1.19.2	To do that , I would do some online research for the component 's features and price on few tech sites .	St
1.19.3	Then , visit few online pc hardware vendors to compare the price .	St
1.19.4	Actually , there are n't too many good vendors left out there today , find the one with competetive price and good service , I prefer to order the parts from one place only , easy for future RMA ( accident do happen , u never know ) .	St
1.19.5	Best of all , it fun to build ur own .	St
1.19.6	Good luck and happy integrating .	Polite
1.20.1	Iv'e done , and do , all of the above .	St
1.20.2	Long ago , I was a big supporter of building your own .	St
1.20.3	Used to be , you could get a much better system for much less money .	St
1.20.4	As the margins got smaller and smaller , the tables turned , and now I usually find I ca n't build a system nearly as cheaply as I can buy one , especially when you throw in the cost of windows , even OEM .	St
1.20.5	Yes , sometimes the purchased PCs are n't quite as high performance or quality , but honestly , most of the time , it really just does n't make any difference .	St
1.20.6	I 've done it for others , but I 've also been saddled with being their tech support for the next five years .	St
1.20.7	If it 's for work , then I definitely buy .	St
1.20.8	My company does n't pay me ( or anyone ) to build PCs .	St
1.20.9	If they did , the PCs would cost more than Porsches .	St
1.20.10	I 'd be an idiot to forego the factory warranty .	St
1.20.11	The first time I had to fix one PC , the cost to my company would be greater than the cost of the PC , probably a lot more .	St
1.20.12	I would still build one for home , just for the fun of it , or if I wanted something specific or higher end than I could easily buy .	St
1.20.13	On the other hand , the stuff on sale , especially newer refurbs are just irresistible .	St
1.21.1	Why did you pick & quot ; other & quot ; ?	Ques
1.21.2	Is n't this choice 2 ?	Ques
1.22.1	Do n't know what happened .	St
1.22.2	This was supposed to be in reply to susanai .	St
1.23.1	I just bought a Dell I5 desktop , new , for $ 449 .	St
1.23.2	If I built something similar , for $ 449 I could buy the same processor , a motherboard ( nothing fancy ) , and a copy of W7pro .	St
1.23.3	That 's it .	St
1.23.4	I would n't have any money left over for ram , a hard drive , optical drive , a case , or power supply , or anything else .	St
1.24.1	Anyone that 's ever built their own system knows 2 things .	St
1.24.2	1 : If you scrape the bottom of the barrel , sure , you can build a REALLY cheap computer .	St
1.24.3	800 watt power supply for $ 25 ?	Ques
1.24.4	Who could go wrong ?	Ques
1.24.5	And is that your case , or is that what happened when a Japanese toy robot made it with a Borg cube ?	Ques
1.24.6	Sure you can get away cheaply , but I have to be honest ... my rigs always turn out more expensive .	St
1.24.7	My video card and power supply cost more than most folk 's entire system .	St
1.24.8	But when you spend a bit more , you get a lot more .	St
1.24.9	I can say , I think without hyperbole , that my PC Power & amp ; Cooling PSU could be drug beneath the Arctic ice by submarine , take a direct hit from a nuclear missle , and be shot into the sun with a rocket and it 'd STILL produce a rock solid 12v+ rail .	St
1.24.10	But all this takes us to ... 2 : When you buy your own stuff , you get WAY better than the 1 year warranty that covers every single part in an OEM pc .	St
1.24.11	Most of the stuff in my tower has 3 year or 5 year warranties , some stuff is even covered for LIFE .	St
1.24.12	Try to get a dead ram stick covered in an OEM pc 10 days after the warranty drops .	St
1.24.13	Not only does the warranty of off the shelf parts blow OEM away , they always , always , always seem to last longer .	St
1.24.14	Probably a result of the nature of manufacturing supply to rely on the lowest bidder ...	St
1.25.1	I have built my own for many years .	St
1.25.2	It lets me choose the components I want , with the quality I want , and at the best price I can find .	St
1.25.3	When I am done , I am happy with the result , and , with the addition of a good UPS and/or surge suppressor , I have never had any kind of component failure for 20 years now .	St
1.25.4	On the other hand , I have fixed many systems for other people , who bought them at the big box stores or online , cheaper than mine initially , perhaps , but in the long run , I think mine have been cheaper .	St
1.25.5	Plus ... it 's fun and I learn a lot .	St
1.25.6	- Sinbad	St
1.26.1	I use my PC for video editing and graphics .	St
1.26.2	Having a technical background , I research components when it 's time for a new system .	St
1.26.3	This way , I get what will work best for my needs .	St
