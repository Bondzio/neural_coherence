If you want a good result try something thats used to remove scratchs from eyeglasses as that has to be about perfect.Years ago I had bad scratches on motorcycle windshield.A guy I knew who worked at grinding and repairing lens gave me a liquid that I used with a buff pad on my drill and it did a perfect job.Seen different things on tv since should do same thing.
