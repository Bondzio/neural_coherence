4352	0	507954	5035167	NR	Doctor Who	11/28/10 4:42 PM	1.29096252E12	If N-band is so much better, than why is it worse than G?	I've got a Linksys WRT610N router. I've got it set up to broadcast in both 802.11g and 802.11n bands. My house isn't large, so I would have thought that it would be a bit of a challenge for the 802.11g to reach the far ends of the house, but certainly not a problem for the 802.11n. Boy, was I wrong! I've got a new Vizio Blu-ray player in my bedroom (at the farthest end of the house from the WRT610N router). It indicates the signal strength of both bands. The 802.11g band isn't really strong, but that, to me, wasn't a surprise. What is a surprise is the 802.11n signal strength is significantly poorer. Now, I thought that 802.11n was supposed to be better, stronger, reaching farther, etc. What's going on here? Why am I seeing what I'm seeing? The 802.11n from my router is so poor I cannot use it at all in bedroom, I have to use the 802.11g band, which, as I've said, isn't very strong itself.

There are so many factors involved with signal strength and bit speed, it's not worth describing. In a nutshell, distance and obstructions are the determining factor. In perfect laboratory conditions you will get 105 Mb/s. Won't ever happen in the real world. As most people don't realize, higher frequencies can travel farther, but are more susceptible to interference and blocking. Lower frequencies travel through most anything, but speed is affected. Consider ULF (ultra low frequency) that the Navy uses to travel hundreds of miles under water, at a bit rate of about 10. The higher the frequency, the more obstructions (walls) interfere. I don't have an answer, sorry, except tear some walls down.

I had used Linksys B & G routers for years without any problems, but once they started making them in that Pancake configuration, things seem to have gone downhill. If you want duel band look at the Netgear WNR 3700. I have put several in without a problem. I am sure there are other brands that work as well, but I stick with what works for me. One thing I would like to add, no matter what brand you choose and it is at all possible, put the router in a central location on the main or middle floor.

I know that the antenna for those &quot;pancake&quot; Linksys routers is internal somehow. So, you're saying that the Netgear WNR 3700 is better, at both G and N bands?
4352	6	507954	5036851	5036593	Doctor Who	11/30/10 4:49 PM	1.29113574E12	One additional comment	I just looked up that Netgear router that you mentioned, and see that I've already seen it on CNET's reviews ( http://reviews.cnet.com/routers/netgear-wndr3700-rangemax-dual/4505-3319_7-33485574.html ). They considered it to be very good, but on the negative side they said that the N-band performance &quot;... is disappointing.&quot; Do you have that same experience?

4352	9	507954	5039552	5036593	Doctor Who	12/4/10 2:47 PM	1.29147402E12	Does the WNR 3700 support N-band?	I know that is is advertised as supporting duel band, but when I look at te specs for it vs. some other router (like the Linksys E3000) it says that the Netgear WNR 3700 only supports, &quot;IEEE 802.11n (draft 2)&quot;. I'm just wondering if the WNR 3700, is old enough that it predates the 802.11n standard? And maybe it has been superseded either by an updated version of the WNR 3700 which supports the standard, rather than a draft, or if there's a newer Netgear model to the WNR 3700 that supports the standard?

The product page at Netgear.com notes &quot;IEEE 802.11n version 2.0&quot;. I can only guess where you read Draft versus &quot;version.&quot; Bob
