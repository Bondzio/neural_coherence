<s> Hello, new to the fourms. </s>
<s> I brought a computer with a video card and now I found out that I need a more powerful power supply to run my GPU. </s>
<s> I purchased this http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16883102675 computer with this http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814150130 video card. </s>
<s> It recommends a 450watt or higher PSU, the video card. </s>
<s> Can somebody give me a some power supplies from Newegg or TigerDirect that will work with this computer. </s>
<s> Also, the GPU has a 4-pin power conect not a 6-pin like most PCI-E cards.And it needs to have a 24-pin main connecter. </s>
<s> Along with that I would like to upgrade the ram to 1gig. </s>
<s> Now can I just add another CORSAIR ValueSelect 512MB 184-Pin Unbuffered DDR 400 in there and it will work? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>

<s> Bump, I'd rather not have more then 500watts powersupply and put my electric bill through the roof and also I'd rather not spend more then 65 dollars. </s>
<s> should work, like this 1 also http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817103937 I have the 550 and didn't see any increase in my bill, except for the rate hikes from the power co. </s>
<s> I just installed a new video card and that is the exact power supply that I got. </s>
<s> I bought it at the local Staples. </s>
<s> Great power supply and very quiet! </s>

<s> Thanks guys. </s>
<s> Anymore? </s>
<s> What about the memory? </s>
