In the room where the transmitter is, there are two Cat5e cables, one goes to the room with the monitor where I want the signal to go to, and then the other cable goes to the living room to the tv. The problem is it gets a bit tiring getting the receiver from one location and moving it to the other room while also connecting the different Cat5e cable. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

(look on amazon for HDMI splitters) The only downside is the costs. It's been done a lot. Is any distance 30 to so feet? I have a 31 foot cable from my Kindle Fire HD to the HDTV and that's fine at 1080p. Bob

I have a HDMI wireless link but those those have very short ranges. I would never hope to exceed what the maker tells me. In fact I plan at half the distance they write in their sales pitches. Bob

But we may be able to accommodate that. You have your HDMI source that goes to cat5 then pops out somewhere. At that point you use the splitter. One goes to the display and the other goes to your second HDMI to cat5 box. And then cat5 to the other location. No cat5 splitting at all. I don't see the distances involved but there is a reason for single HDMI outputs. It's really simple and it has to do with the industry. The key words are royalty, patents and HDCP. I'm sure by now you know why those words come into the discussion. Bob
