here are the priorities for choosing memory for home computers: 1. having enough memory is the most important thing.
that means 1gb for windows xp (or 2gb-3gb for serious photoshop work, video editing, and 3d gaming).
and, 2gb for windows 7 or vista (3gb for photoshop, video editing, 3d games).
if you have the 64-bit version of windows you can install 4gb, 8gb, or more but there is no marked benefit except in massive photoshop/video work which few people do at home.
so, if you're on a budget first be sure you have enough memory, even if it's a slower type.
example: ddr2-667 instead of the faster, more expensive ddr2-800.
or, ddr3-1066 instead of the faster, more expensive ddr3-1333 and ddr3-1600.
2. assuming you have enough memory, then memory speed (and to a lesser extent, latency) determines how much data your system can transfer per second to get the job done.
ddr3 is faster than ddr2.
in photoshop, video editing or converting music to mp3, faster memory means the job is completed sooner.
(in 3d games, faster memory will help a little bit to get you more frames-per-second but mostly that's determined by the memory on your video/graphics card.)
suppose you want to convert a music cd to mp3 format.
with faster memory the conversion could be completed 40 seconds to 1.5 minutes faster.
what you must decide is how important is that minute?
for most of us, an extra minute or even three minutes simply doesn't matter.
but, if you are doing a lot of music, or photos, or video work then the time saved will quickly add up and you will really appreciate that you have a fast processor and fast memory.
remember, even the basic dual-core processors and 2gb of ddr2-667 memory will complete the job faster than a high-end processor and memory from 5 years ago !!
in the end, it depends on what you want to do on your computer and how much you can afford to spend.
good luck!
