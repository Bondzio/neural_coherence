ok, so somewhere along the line, i screwed up.
after buying a new powersupply and still nothign happening, i was pretty much ready to give up.
on a whim, i lugged the computer down to my dads and hooked up his monitor just to see if anyhtign was goin on, and lo and behold, up came the bios.
aparently, not only has my monitor gone bad, but also my back up monitor.
(could just be the cable) anyway, here is the new problem.
i was able to get inot grub to choose if i wanted to boot into windows and linux.
but when i choose one, the computer restarts.
so i figgured that i would just start by wiping the drives, and throwing windows back on there.
i can boot off my instal cd, and i get into the set up screen, but the windows set up is telling me that it cant locate a hard drive.
when i check the bios, it tells me that my hard drives are there.
even the fact that i can get to grub (and even to the part where windows asks if i want to boot in safe mode, the last known good config, or normal) tells me that the hard drives are there.
what should i do?
