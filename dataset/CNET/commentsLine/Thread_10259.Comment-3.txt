bob, thanks for responding.
my computer doesn't have the front usb ports - only the back ones of which i have only two.
they have worked for using a mouse for example.
i am not the most computer savvy person, so please excuse that fact.
if you could recommend a couple of drivers as per your comment, then i can try each one until hopefully it works.
thank you very much.
