<s> After spending several hours researching the archives Im ready to buy a DVD+Ram burner. </s>
<s> Searching my price range ($50.00) I have found three brands im contemplating on. </s>
<s> 1)-Asus 2)-BenQ 3)-LG Any users input as to pros or cons would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> I dont minding spending up to $100.00 if its really worth it so im open to other options as well. </s>
<s> Also many thanks to those hundreds of responses (especially those including links to great spec sites) covering everything I needed to know about DVD burners and thanks to CNET for its comprehensive (19 pages) ''Burner Buying Guide''! </s>
<s> Looking at other posts I plan on checking out Toshiba and NEC burners as well but absolutely want one that burns DVD Ram as my first priority is for my C drive back up. </s>
<s> Many thanks, Ken Ps: Whats the scoop on making sure I get drivers and software w/purchase? </s>
<s> I read that some units do not come with these? </s>
<s> (OEM bulk units)? </s>
<s> I understand the concept and wondering if I should make sure what I do and dont get w/purchase. </s>
<s> Will I need a cable as im replacing my CDRom with the new burner (as the master) and keeping my CD burner/DVD Rom as a slave. </s>
<s> No matter which I've put in at home or office, they all seem to peter out after a few years. </s>
<s> At least the sub 50 dollar units are not a big bite in the budget anymore. </s>
<s> I will share that I always record at 1/2 the rated media speed. </s>
<s> I don't want to debate why but feel it's a key reason why I have so few problems. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I did read your reply elsewhere about burning at 1/2 speed. </s>
<s> Makes sense to me and when I burn im in no hurry anyway. </s>
<s> Thanks for the heads up on that idea. </s>
<s> Mostly just wondering if anyone here has any pros or cons on brands LG, Asus, and Benq. </s>
<s> As I have found these 3 at comparable prices. </s>
<s> I will head back to the stores online review panel for more input. </s>
<s> BTW I did read here somewhere that someone said they did not have a problem w/less costly blank media for burning DVD Ram. </s>
<s> ie: Ram is not as picky as to which brand of media as compared to DVD R/RW media in general. </s>
<s> I ask because I have found blank Ram media from $14.00 each (Memorex) to $6.00 each (unknown name) both not in the cartridge form. </s>
<s> I did read a review on the more expensive Memorex label from a office tech who has used them exclusively for years witn never a single problem. </s>
<s> Thanks again, Ken </s>
<s> http://www.cdspeed2000.com/ has some DVD test results. </s>
<s> The brands you listed are all quite common and I would buy, use such at the 50 buck mark. </s>

<s> it's still humming along. </s>
<s> Thanks but I want one that writes to DVD Ram which I havent found in NEC. </s>
<s> At least not in the price range of $50.00. </s>
<s> Ken </s>
<s> I have my eye on a BenQ #DQ60. </s>
<s> I found it for under $50.00 and it does everything I want. </s>
<s> Its also one of the few that will work with a slower processor. </s>
<s> (and the site I found it at offers free shipping) Thanks, Ken </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Other than packaging what is the difference between OEM and Retail units? </s>
<s> Also can the software for a burner be installed on an external HD and use that Hd's storage room for operating the burner? </s>
<s> The unit im looking at needs a min. </s>
<s> (.5G) processor where as most of the others need a min. </s>
<s> 1.2G speed. </s>
<s> What will this affect? </s>
<s> My old computer which im on now is only a small .5G processor with a 6G HD so im wondering if I can use the extra space on my external HD. </s>
<s> I have a more recent unit which had a fatal crash and I havent restored it yet as I need to start from scratch but its bigger and faster. </s>
<s> (many lessons learned!) </s>
<s> Do I need to wait untill I get my better computer back up and running? </s>
<s> Thanks again, Ken </s>
<s> I would wait until the newer is fixed. </s>
<s> Depending on the crash, (software or hardware) you could either piece together the bad components with your other computer - or use your reboot disc - if software, to reinstall windows. </s>
<s> It is really easy to do with XP, but you will lose all your files. </s>
<s> Lite On seemed to be high up on performance according to your link. </s>
<s> Anyone willing to share experience with them. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> My internal CD-RW drive was fried recently during a power surge, so I went to Walmart to replace it, shopping for, at minimum, just a CD-Rom drive. </s>
<s> The Lite-On DVD +/- RW SOHW-1693S was just $59, so I purchased that. </s>
<s> (By the way, the same drive is just $44.99 at thetechgeek.com). </s>
<s> I have a dual boot with Windows ME and XP on an IBM Net Vista 850 mhz Pentium III. </s>
<s> My video capture device is a Belkin USB Video Bus. </s>
<s> I also have an Intel Pocket PC Camera attached by USB. </s>
<s> Whenever I try to capture video with my Nero software, I get a &quot;blue screen of death&quot; that flashes on the screen for about 2 seconds saying something about not enough memory. </s>
<s> So, if the purpose of your getting a DVD burner is to capture video, your limited memory may be an issue. </s>
<s> For capturing video, the standalone DVD recorders attached directly to your cable system/dvr/TV are much better. </s>
<s> I also have a $98 ILO DVD recorder which I got at Walmart, and it's so much easier than using the Nero software that comes with the LiteOn DVD burner...no 'blue screens of death'. </s>
<s> But if you are just wanting to use it to burn data, the LiteOn DVD burner is very good from my experience with it so far. </s>
<s> It also plays back DVD in the formats burned from my ILO DVD recorder. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I use limewire, and I wish to burn to DVD to watch on a bigger screen. </s>
<s> Any suggestions on software/burners? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
