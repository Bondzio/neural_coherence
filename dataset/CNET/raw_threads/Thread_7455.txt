I want to know if i would be able to replace the GPU in this APU ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103943 ) with another, better, GPU ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102918 ). I'm not exactly sure how APU's work so I decided to come to the experts for help.

733	3	547700	5233744	5233630	bob b	11/19/11 2:50 PM	1.3217142E12	Yes	The mobo you linked to has a pci-e x16 slot......that's good and what the Gpu needs.
