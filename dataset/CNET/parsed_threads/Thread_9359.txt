<s> I am buying a new Dell 9100 from a reputable seller on Ebay. </s>
<s> It is loaded with everything I want except two things. </s>
<s> Sound card and IEEE 1394 port. </s>
<s> It comes with a intergrated 7.1 dolby sound card. </s>
<s> Is that going to be a problem running with some games or programs? </s>
<s> Also is it easy to install a IEEE 1394 port? </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> The sound should be decent. </s>
<s> As for the firwire port, you can pick up a pci card for this, around $20 to $30 bucks. </s>
<s> Just be sure the machine has a few extra pci slots, in case you want to install a sound card or other upgrade at a later date. </s>
<s> but buying a soundcard and disabling your onboard audio will save your cpu power for the game (you will get more fps). </s>
<s> as for firewire, most creative soundcards come with a firewire port, the Audigy 2 series so you get a fire wire port and a nice soundcard for the same pci slot. </s>
<s> konny </s>
