<s> I have a Sony computer with a Windows XP operating system. </s>
<s> I have a Lexmark Z52 printer which is giving me problems. </s>
<s> Lexmark has been very good and patiently walked me through everything in the book to get it working properly again including sending me a new cartridge, but without any success. </s>
<s> The print-out is very poor quality, blurred in certain parts with certain letters distorted ONLY when printing from the word processor. </s>
<s> If I print from the Internet (for instance if I printed out this page) the printer works fine. </s>
<s> This makes me think that it is a Microsoft Word problem, could this be the cause and if so how do I fix it please? </s>
<s> If you have the CD for MS Office, you could try an un-install and re-install of Office but that sound a bit drastic so... a few checks... 1) Go to http://www.trendmicro.com (the PC-cillin people- so it's a trusted site) and run their Free Virus Scan (Housecall) - it checks for EVERYTHING, not just viruses - it will even tell you if there is a Windows update you haven't done. </s>
<s> This will also check for Spyware, Greyware, Malware etc. </s>
<s> etc. </s>
<s> This is always first port of call for unusual problems - bugs can cause all sorts of strange things. </s>
<s> 2) Do a Scandisk (chkdsk) or whatever XP uses for it's re-boot disk check. </s>
<s> 3) Are you fully up-to-date with Windows Update AND.... Office Update...? </s>
<s> If not, run both... there may be a glitch that they now have a patch for. </s>
<s> 4) Try using a different Font... instead of Times New Roman which is usually the MS-Word default font. </s>
<s> If this prints OK, you may have a bad Times New Roman font so remove it and re-install it with a good copy (ask a friend for a copy if you can't get at one on a CD). </s>
<s> Or does XP have a font repair program, I can't remember. </s>
<s> 5) I'm guessing that Lexmark have already told you to download their new Z52 drivers for XP...? </s>
<s> http://downloads.lexmark.com/cgi-perl/downloads.cgi?ccs=227:5:0:292:0:0&searchLang=en&os_group=WinXP&target= There are 2 driver here and you will probably need both. </s>
<s> ... Hope this helps or at least eliminates a few lines of enquiry. </s>
<s> Please let us all know how you get on. </s>
<s> WOW! </s>
<s> Thank you very much Skycatcher for taking the time to give me such a detailed reply. </s>
<s> You have certainly given me enough new things to try. </s>
<s> I will let you know how I get on. </s>
<s> Thanks again, Patty. </s>
<s> Well, SUCCESS!! </s>
<s> I finally solved my printer problems with your help. </s>
<s> I followed all the instructions you gave me, Virus Scan, Scandisk check, Windows and Office Update, Downloaded a new driver, gave my printer a good clean, then installed a new cartridge and for the first time in months I did not get the error message ''Trouble communicating with the printer'' it printed beautifully! </s>
<s> Thank you so much for your help, (its also worked wonders for my stomach which clenched in a tight knot every time I attempted to print something out) GOOD WORK. </s>
<s> Sorry, I got your name wrong in my last post I tried to get it back to change it but too late... </s>
<s> Being a keep paraglider pilot, I do a lot of Skywatching as well Glad it's all OK Bye... </s>
