it looks like you didn't do as Ray suggested.
Try EACH stick (one at a time) in the slot the MOBO manual lists as being for single sticks (varies with each board).
After determining that all the sticks are good, then try the combinations as recommended by the manual.
By adding that 3rd stick, you probably lose dual-channel support.
