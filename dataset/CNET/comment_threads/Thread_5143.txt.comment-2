For instance at home, office and labs we use the HP k550 and its successors and for scanning we use those freely gifted scanners that people can't seen to get working (freecycle on google.)
Those under 99 buck printers are shortlived affairs so I never note any of them and about refilling.
That had to end since people would refill then call in for support.
Sadly the fallout was the chip.
