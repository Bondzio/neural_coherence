6096	0	306920	2847431	NR	weaver00	9/1/08 2:20 PM	1.2202788E12	BIOS/POST freeze	I am running an Athlon 64X2 dual core processor 6400+ 3.2 Ghz with 4 gig ram on a Gigabyte GA-M52S-S3P motherboard.I have a dual boot set up with the main hard drive on a SATA connection and the secondary hard drive on IDE, both are running XP SP2. About 50% of the time the screen freezes on boot up just after the single beep tells me that the BIOS is OK and about halfway through the screen listing the hardware. After several attempts the system will boot OK. I have updated the BIOS, but cannot find any reason for the freezing. Any suggestions would be welcome. Thanks,

A new annoyance is if you built it yourself you must check the RAM VOLTAGE, settings and more to see if they match the RAM &quot;specifications&quot; as well as never overtax the power supply. As it stands you have a defective machine but so few details (such as I built it myself) that my first thought is the warranty. Bob

First try re-seating any additional cards you are using; i.e. video card, network card, sound card. If no help, go to device manager. (in control panel|system properties| hardware tab) and check for any yellow question marks next to each hardware item. If any found, you need to get the proper device driver. If all hardware drivers properties say &quot;this device is working properly&quot; time to try something else. Re-boot into Safe Mode (Hit F8 key after post beep) and see if the boot process hangs after a certain driver is loaded. If it hangs, the last driver listed is the last driver that was successfully loaded. Take note of that listing and reboot again. If the system boots successfully (without hang) note the driver that was loaded after the previous hang spot. You may try updating that driver. Your case is difficult because it sometimes boots correctly. Try removing all extra cards and just boot with video card, keyboard, mouse,and hard drives. If no hang, you may have a bad device preventing boot. Go into the BIOS and check that the setting &quot;Plug and Play OS&quot; is enabled. You may have a bad motherboard. I had one once that would take 2 or three minutes to boot, but would never hang! I soon got tired of that and canned it!
