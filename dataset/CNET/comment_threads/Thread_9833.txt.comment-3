why my Mac can &quot;see&quot; the 500 gig drive in the OWC FW enclosure and not the 200 gig drive in the older Maxtor FW enclosure.
These are both external drives in case I was not clear on that aspect.
Thanks for your reply mrmacfixit, but I am somewhat at more of a loss now.
I have these just plugged into the regular FW ports on the Mac also - no mods or PCI cards installed.
Also my G4 is one of the dual boot Macs.
The HD size remains the same whether in X or 9 and are as stated above.
Thanks again for any info,
