sorry for the confusion, that is not the actual cooler i bought, i was just using the picture to show the bracket.
i actually bought it from tigerdirect.ca, anyone know how they are about returning things.
the cooler i did buy is this one  .
i'd rather not have to deal with returning it, but i wouldn't risk my mobo either, sooooo.....yeah.
