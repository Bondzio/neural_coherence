Unfortunately, it stopped working......... it won't load Windows now. I want to use it for nothing more than Internet access. If I reformat it, I would rather not use the reinstall ME CD that came with it since most virus protection doesn't support ME so I'd like to install XP. I have a Dell reinstallation CD from another newer computer....... can I use that without creating new problems????

The reinstallation CD will recognize that this isn't the original computer it came with and refuse to go on. 2. The reinstallation CD will install the wrong drivers, and things won't work. 3. The XP activation won't succeed, because the product key is already being used by the newer computer. Then you'll have to buy a new license. And there's always the possibility, of course, that the reason that it won't load Windows now is some hardware issue. And that might cause the install of Windows XP to fail, even if the above three items don't apply. Hope this helps. Kees
