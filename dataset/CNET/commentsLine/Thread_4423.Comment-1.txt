hello before i state my problem, i'll list my computer specs computer 1 mb: gigabyte ga-k8nxp-sli cpu: amd fx-55 ram: 2 gigs this computer has two lan ports on the mb, 1 is 10/100 mbps and other at 10/100/1000 mbps.
computer 2 mb: asus a8v-vm cpu: amd 64 3000+ ram: 1 gigs this computer had one lan port on the mb rated 10/100 and has a addon pci lan port rated 10/100/1000/2000 (trendnet teg-pcitxr) right now on each computer the non 1000 lan ports are being used to connect to a router for the internet.
the other two 1000 lan ports are connected together with a crossover wire rated cat6  all the ips and gateways are setup and everything works but the speed.
if you look at status and task manager it says the connection is 1gbps but when i transfer it only clips at 100 mbps.
so in the task manager is only 1%.
how can i sove my problem?
