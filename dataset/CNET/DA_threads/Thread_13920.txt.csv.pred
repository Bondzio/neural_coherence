1.1.1	I just upgraded my motherboard to a PC CHIPS M863G , and I 'm having some trouble with it getting to boot .	St
1.1.2	In short , there is no booting .	St
1.1.3	No beeping , no flashing , so then there 's most likely a short about .	St
1.1.4	The last time I tried to install a motherboard , I had this exact problem .	St
1.1.5	I ended up taking it to a technician , and when he fixed it up , and I asked him what the problem was , he told me that something to the effect of my CPU clock being off sync with my FSB , or something .	St
1.1.6	To this day , I have no idea how to adjust that setting on the motherboard , and I 'm becoming pretty frustrated .	St
1.1.7	The manual is total garbage .	St
1.1.8	And if anyone already has had experience with this board , I did plug in the 4-pin power plug as well as adjusted the CMOS jumper .	St
1.1.9	Specs : Proc : AMD Athlon XP 2400+ RAM : Kingston DDR400 512MB GPU : nVidia GeForce 5500 FX Plus a Lite-On CD/DVD drive and another ATAPI DVD drive and two running virtual drives	St
1.2.1	Seems that you did what I had to do with four of them to get the supply to turn on .	St
1.2.2	They all came with the CMOS jumper in the wrong position .	St
1.2.3	In the case of these the manul showed the positions correctly , just that the mobos shipped with the jumper in the wiring position .	St
1.2.4	One thing common to putting new mobo in old case is to miss the fact that there is a hex standoff left on the mounting plate that does NOT line up with the new mobos plated ring mounting holes .	St
1.2.5	This results in shorting the artwork on the bottom layer of the mobo .	St
1.3.1	lay it on a piece of cardboard with ony CPU/HSF , Memory .	St
1.3.2	Plug the supply in and use the tip of a small slot screwdriver to momentarily short the two power on pins on the mobo togeter .	St
1.3.3	The power supply should turn on and STAY on , until you short the pins again , possibly for 4 or 5 seconds .	St
1.3.4	BTW way , this should work with a brand new mobo with NOTHING added .	St
1.3.5	Should work right out of the box .	St
1.4.1	pressing the on off switch repeatedly .	St
1.4.2	That worked for me yesterday .	St
1.4.3	I bought a mobo and put everything in and when I pressed the power button nothign happened .	St
1.4.4	I thought somethign was wrong so I kept flcking the power supply switch on/off while keep pressing the power button and my mobo turned on .	St
1.5.1	I bit the bullet and took it to the Geek Squad .	St
1.5.2	A guy that looks like Elliot Smith took all of 10 minute to diagnose it .	St
1.5.3	As it turned out , the little power/reset/LEDs were miscolored .	St
1.5.4	D'oh .	St
1.5.5	Thanks for the help though .	St
1.5.6	You guys do a good thing here .	St
