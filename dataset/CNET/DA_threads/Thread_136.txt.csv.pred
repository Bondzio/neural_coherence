1.1.1	My Vaio T9550 has a 500gb SATA data drive which is almost empty plus a 45gb SSD system drive which is almost full.	St
1.1.2	Can I transfer any of the larger programs from the system drive to the vast emptiness of the storage drive?	St
1.1.3	Or do I just have to keep deleting decent programs from the SSD drive as it fills up??	St
1.1.4	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	This question is well discussed.	St
1.2.2	Since about 1995 with a change in Windows most programs do not move.	St
1.2.3	You uninstall and then re-install them to the other drive.	St
1.2.4	-&gt; But that's not why I wrote.	St
1.2.5	Some folk &quot;delete&quot; rather than uninstall and the forums find the question &quot;Why didn't that work?&quot; Bob	St
1.3.1	your e-mail to the SATA drive.	St
1.3.2	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	It's the programs which take up all the space on my SSD.	St
1.4.2	I'll try uninstalling from the SSD what can be downloaded and reinstalled on the SATA drive, but I'm not sure that'll free up too much space...	St
1.4.3	If I have to upgrade to a bigger SSD drive, what pitfalls should I look out for?	St
1.4.4	Any particular drives you'd recommend?	St
1.5.1	PC Magazine had an utility called &quot;COA2&quot; (Change Of Address) to do just this.	St
1.5.2	Though not really meant for Win XP, it does what its supposed to do.	St
1.5.3	I have been using it quite a bit.	St
1.5.4	Just make a copy of the Program Folder P2BMvd (Program to be Moved) on another drive, run COA2.	St
1.5.5	Rename the original folder as, say &quot;Copy of P2BMvd&quot;, just to be safe!	St
1.5.6	I have moved a large variety of Programs from the Program Files on C drive to other Drives and have not had an need to undo the change.	St
1.5.7	I delete the &quot;Copy ....&quot; after a few days.	St

1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	While it did accomplish a drive letter change the apps failed to launch here.	St
1.7.2	After more than a decade it's clear that the design works as intended.	St
1.7.3	That is, stop copying of apps by forcing the install.	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	I came across this interesting piec of software and wondered if anyone here has used it.	St
1.8.2	It's not free - $15 - but a whole lot cheaper than a new hard drive.	St
1.8.3	http://www.funduc.com/app_mover.htm	St
1.9.1	Is that Microsoft Apps such as Office are what I use to test such apps.	St
1.9.2	Some find this to be an unfair test.	St
1.9.3	Bob	St
