you said ''it took ms months to fix xp when it first came out.''
in reality the xp is still ful of bugs and security holes.
the truth is that operation systems never get working properly before the next one comes out - and soon after that the support of the old one ceases.
the question is how functional you want it to be before you buy it.
i doubt i would upgrade to vista untill about mid cycle and only then if my software won't run on the old one.
remember though that every os from microsoft has just about doubled the resource requirements: memory, hard drive space... so take this account when you budget your pc.
also, as fas i understand it, the amd's amt2 does not take s. 939 processors or any other existing one but needs a new processor type altogether.
