<s> I have a computer from Taiwan which has a SiS 900 Based PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter. </s>
<s> I'm trying to hook it up to my cable modem service. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I can't get it to connect. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> If FE is your abbreviation for fast ethernet, then your issues are probably more along the lines of drivers and common install problems. </s>
<s> As least this issue is not one of them. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
