I'm looking to get a new computer soon and I have a lot of files I want to move between my old and new computer (about 60+ GB worth). I was looking into ways to do that and found out about Crossover cables but then found out there's a lot of set up involved (i.e., &quot;You can't just connect two computers and expect them to share files right away.&quot;). I'm wondering if the Belkin EasyTransfer cable is better because it does have a plug-and-play aspect to it? Thanks in advance.

Setup and use of Windows Easy Transfer has no involved or &quot;lot of&quot; set up. We plug a cable from the old to the new machine, run Easy Transfer on each machine and enter some 6 digit number and then check off the items we want moved. What could be easier? Bob

Never want to get &quot;on line&quot; with it? Get a router. Connect the two to the router and turn on file and printer sharing on the PCs. You can do everything you want and have two surfing PCs.
