unfortunately, the ibook does not sport a pc card slot so if there is any upgrading to do it would have to be via the usb connector.
here are three i found just now.
i have not done any research as to their compatibility with os x or os 9 , but the devices do exist.
given that the ibook is usb 1.0, the speed gain would be negligible.
