<s> Well, recently I bought a new custom computer. </s>
<s> Dual Core 3800+ 2 GHZ procesor, 1 gig of ram, 2 128mb 6600 GT video cards, a 450 watt power supply, runing Windows Media Center 2005. </s>
<s> I have the latest nvidia drivers. </s>
<s> Now, my problem is that when playing Battle Field 2, about 45 minutes into it my system will crash. </s>
<s> My monitor will go blank, and my speakers will go quiet, however the power light on my computer will stay on, and I have to hold down the power button to turn it off, the turn it back on to make it work again. </s>
<s> This happens when SLI is both enabled and disabled. </s>
<s> Also, my first video card runs at about 50-60 degrees at most, and my second runs at about 40-50 degrees. </s>
<s> give it a try and see if it solves your problem: Exit the nView Desktop Manager. </s>
<s> Whenever the display driver is installed for GeForce cards the nView Desktop Manager is on by default. </s>
<s> To exit it just right-click the icon in the notification area and click exit. </s>
<s> Hope this solves you prob. </s>
<s> I'd look to a few places such as: a. </s>
<s> The maker to make it their problem. </s>
<s> b. </s>
<s> The power supply. </s>
<s> Monster size it. </s>
<s> c. The heat. </s>
<s> Remove the covers for now. </s>
<s> Don't write &quot;the CPU is&quot; so many degrees since other parts get hot too. </s>
