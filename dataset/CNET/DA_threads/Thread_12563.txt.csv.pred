1.4.1	Your new M/B can be purchased with the features you want.	St
1.4.2	If you wish to use the existing memory and CPU the board must support them.	Ques
1.4.3	You must also match the size of the purchased M/B to the case size.	St
1.4.4	Make sure that the port plate is changable.	St
1.4.5	The Power Supply may also have to be changed.	St
1.4.6	Couple of post floating around on new builds, you may want to check them out.	St

1.5.1	sorry if i confused you with the abbrev.	Polite
1.5.2	before you get a motherboard, you need to make sure it will fit in your case (unless you're willing to get a new case) and your power supply can work with it (unless you're willing to get a new power supply).	St
1.5.3	the easiest way to determine that is to get the size and type of your current motherboard and/or your current pc's model number.	St
1.5.4	i don't want to recommend something that may not work for your setup.	St
