If one person on the network is downloading a large file he or she seems to use up almost the entire amount of available bandwidth - and as a result other users can't even load a webpage. I'm lloking for a solution that allows a more even distribution of bandwidth to ~30 users. My current solution utilizes 2 Linksys 16 port switches attached to a NetGear router which is in turn attached to a 6meg capped cable modem (courtesy of Time Warner). My guess as to what is going on is that the given individual is in continuous connection with the switch/router and that causes requests for information to simply be ignored until they time out...leading to websites not loading. Is there a product around that I can purchase that will let me manage the network more like a college-dorm? (the situation i'm in is actually a Fraternity) It seems that in college dorms that any number of people can download large files and the others on the same network (where I am it's done by hall in each dorm) don't see any slowing down of their own connection. This may be due to the intensely large amount of bandwidth supplied to the dorms to begin with. I doubt that the entire solution relies on having a high bandwidth fiber - so there must be something I'm missing. Links/names of products would be REALLY useful if anyone can help. Thanks, Mark

You may not find it in an easy to obtain dlink/linksys/other product. It is however in Linux, but I offer no support for such. You can research if a Linux based router is right for you. Bob
