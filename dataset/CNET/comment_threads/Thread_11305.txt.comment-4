1.
I never said raid 0 was a mirror.
The question was is it possible to mirror a raid 0 array onto just one drive or does it have to be four drives in raid 0+1 or 1+0.
2. these are the drives I have already.
I understand that 300gbs is less than 500gbs.
It is not really relevent to the question so long as one of the drives is large enofe to mirror the size of the smaller two together.

I asked the question so I would understand a little more about the subject so I could make a better choice on witch way to go.
Thanks for your reply.
