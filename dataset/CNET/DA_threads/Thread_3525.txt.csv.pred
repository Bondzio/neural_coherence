1.1.1	I am looking for a new computer.	St
1.1.2	I have close to $700.00 to spend.	St
1.1.3	I have read the specs for sims 3 but for one,I want to make sure it has more than the basics.	St
1.1.4	Since adding Custom Content and expansion packs will slow things down.	St
1.1.5	The computer I had fits the specs but If I added a bunch of CC's ( not even a quarter of what I used to have on SIms 2 )it would slow way down.	St
1.1.6	I dont' want that.	St
1.1.7	I want a computer that can handle lots of Custom content, since that's half the fun of the Sims is adding custom content..and getting more expansion packs.	St
1.1.8	Secondly, I have no idea of how to covert those things mentioned in the specs into other products.	St
1.1.9	There are so many names and brands and numbers of processors and graphics cards, it's just very confusing to know what is equal to what.	St
1.1.10	I am currently looking at a computer a gamer suggested to me.	St
1.1.11	I was wondering if anyone could tell me if the specs sound good for Sims 3..I also want to run &quot;Daz&quot; on it..if any of you are familiar with that.it's not a game but a 3d graphics program.. Anyways I guess, mainly concentrate on the Sims 3 if you dont' know of the other.	St
1.1.12	Whatever works for Sims 3 should work for that as well.	St
1.1.13	Please let me know if the computer below is good for SIms 3 or if you have any other suggestions.	Sug
1.1.14	!!	St

1.1.16	Manufacturer Warranty Parts 90 days limited Labor 90 days limited	St
1.2.1	&quot;Parts 90 days limited&quot; is a terrible warranty.	St
1.2.2	But my wife's machine loads Sims 3 slowly but plays just fine.	St
1.2.3	It's a lowly Celeron 2+GHz with 2GB RAM and some PCIe ATI HD 2400 card.	St
1.2.4	Your machine exceeds that in many ways.	St
1.2.5	I doubt Sims 3 will be an issue.	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	thanks for your input.	Polite
1.3.2	Yeah not crazy bout the warranty..I thought maybe they had some kind of plan that you could buy to extend that warranty but I'm not sure..although I have had long ones before and then my machine would go like a month after the warranty was over..oh well, anyway thanks for your opinion.	St
1.4.1	You did not state in your original post the current specs for your computer; depending on your PC skills (and the age of your computer), for $700 you could upgrade the individual components inside it, and get extended warranties on each component (the manufacturer warranties are usually pretty good).	St
1.5.1	thanks but I'm not interested in upgrading.	Polite
1.5.2	I have already upgraded once and I really don't want to go through that again...besides the computer's getting pretty old and it's not really up to being upgraded anymore than it already is.	St
