Specs are: X2 3800 2 GB DDR400 2.5,3,3,6 2T 250GB 7200 SATA2 HDD 7900 GTO I built this comp a couple of months ago with a 7600GT, which was an awesome card for just about everything(especially for the $). However, I just had to get Oblivion. With the 7600GT, I could play Oblivion at 1024x768 with HDR and all settings at or near max with all shadows off, and it would run pretty well. I just upgraded to the 7900GTO, and I'm barely getting higher framerates, especially in graphically complex areas. Am I bottlenecking at my CPU or memory? I wouldn't think that to be the case, but I'm willing to hear suggestions. PS-I've started OCing the video card to just under 7900GTX levels without problems, but still no big gains. I've also tried ocing my cpu to 2.2GHZ with no temp adversity, but doesn't seem to help.

Try a higher resolution see if you get good framerates otherwise you might need to check your psu to see if it giving you enough power to the video card.
