<s> I'll be up front, this is a question for homework help. </s>
<s> I'm not asking for an answer (that'd be cheating), more like direction to where I can find an answer (or if I'm on the right track with my hunch). </s>
<s> I want to create a website but only allow a certain user or group of users access to that website. </s>
<s> Assuming that user or users will be from the same location, and likely the same static IP, can I throw a firewall between my internet connection and web server and only allow that specific IP address access to my web server by a rule? </s>
<s> If there is a better way to handle that, I'd appreciate being pointed in the right direction. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> &quot;the same location&quot; is a problem. </s>
<s> Many people use a laptop or a tablet or iPod or smartphone with WiFi or 3G to browse the net. </s>
<s> And their IP-address is dependent on where they are. </s>
<s> I don't even mention Internet cafe's and such where you can use the internet on their machines after a paying a fee, or using a PC at work, school or with friends or family. </s>
<s> So that's an assumption that only would be valid in a homework environment. </s>
<s> Assuming it dates from before the days of laptops and tablets and iPod and smartphones and 3G and 4G, even then an IP-address wouldn't have been useful, because back in the days of dial-up connections, all dial-up connections had a dynamic IP-address. </s>
<s> They gave you another address every time you dialled in. </s>
<s> And even then there was work and school and friends and family where that 'certain group of users' could want to get access. </s>
<s> So any other way to handle this would be better than a way using the IP-address. </s>

<s> Thanks for the reply, Kees. </s>
<s> I was over-simplifying, I think. </s>
<s> My homework states that my company needs to receive blueprint files from a customer securely. </s>
<s> I was thinking using a secure website as an interface for the file transfer. </s>
<s> The customer would upload the files to the website and my company would retrieve the files. </s>
<s> I was assuming that since it was a company sending me the files, that it would be one IP address because they should upload them from their work, which I would think would have one static IP for all outgoing traffic. </s>
<s> My idea was to only allow the customer's static IP to have access to the website. </s>
<s> I was thinking that the firewall rule would block all other IP addresses from accessing it. </s>
<s> Am I going about this in the entirely wrong way? </s>
<s> My only experience with this sort of thing is that my (real, current) work receives marketing data from a vendor monthly, and the vendor has set up a website that we use to receive the files. </s>
<s> of the firewall (software or appliance) of your company to see if it supports blocking by IP-address. </s>
<s> I'm rather sure ZoneAlarm Free 9.x (that's what I use at my home PC) doesn't. </s>
