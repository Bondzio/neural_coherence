1.1.1	I realize that ATI does not yet have (to my knowledge) this exact capability, but does the GTX260/280 provide a substantial CUDA performance increase that would justify the higher price?	St
1.1.2	This is important for me, because I do a good bit of video transcoding which appears to benefit greatly from these applications that can take advantage of the GPU.	St
1.2.1	The video transcoders I use have never attempted to use the GPU.	St
1.2.2	Maybe you'll have to share a few names.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I read about it on AnandTech- it's a new product called BadaBOOM from Elemental Technologies.	St
1.3.2	The numbers they talk about seem to indicate pretty sizable performance gains in going with one of the new GTX cards over a 9800GTX, but I just wanted to see if anyone had any real-world data to add from experience.	St
1.3.3	Here is the story referencing it: http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=3339	St
1.4.1	I don't have any reason to encode h.264.	St
1.4.2	Here it's all HD or DVD standards.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Badaboom is some transcoding software nvidia is promoting because it takes advantage of CUDA.. dont know much about it though	St
