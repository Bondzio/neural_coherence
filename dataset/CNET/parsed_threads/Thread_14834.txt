<s> I have a 100mb down cable internet connection, but I cant connect straight from my modem to my switch, I have to connect from modem, to router (because of something to do with IP) and then from router to my switch and out to the rest of the house. </s>
<s> Why does it not work without the router? </s>
<s> The reason I have a problem with this is because my current router is old as **** (linksys) and it only supports 20mb down so I'm getting capped at 1/5th of the speed I'm paying for. </s>
<s> Secondly, the wireless of the router is turned off, I have other wireless points that I use for wi-fi. </s>
<s> Should I just get a gigabit router or can I somehow get this to work without having a router? </s>
<s> If your modem is not a modem/router combo, then you will need a separate router since a modem only device will only provide one IP address. </s>
<s> A router allows you to connect multiple devices by creating a subnet of private IPs. </s>
<s> A switch cannot do this for you. </s>
<s> If you provide make/model of all devices, someone may be able to assist with troubleshooting. </s>
<s> A new router probably will provide better performance though. </s>
