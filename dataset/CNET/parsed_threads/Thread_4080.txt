<s> I want to upgrade from my P4 2.6MHz processor as it isnt coping very well with the demand my music software places on it. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what the best processor I can mount on my ASUS P4P400 (standard)motherboard is? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> The issue is that you are nearly at the top end of CPUs for that board. </s>
<s> It may be time to pop for some 64-bit CPU or some Intel HT CPU, board and RAM. </s>

<s> Can you suggest any please? </s>
<s> I've used Gigabyte, Asus, MSI, a few others with CPUs from AMD and Intel. </s>
<s> Depending on the part of the world you live in, some of these parts may be available. </s>

<s> The best processor as to performance without overclocking would be a p4 2800 if you can find one for the 400 bus. </s>
<s> The ASUS webpage says I can goto the 3.4 if I change the BIOS. </s>
<s> Is this right? </s>
<s> Thats great. </s>
<s> I was looking for models. </s>
<s> The Asus P4P400-DLX(865 chipset) can support such, but be sure that your current DDRAM is of the right speed and pairs for dual channel operation or you'll likely get &quot;not much&quot; of a boost. </s>
<s> Also, the power supply has to have spare Watts to make it all stable and you'll get a new CPU heatsink/fan. </s>
<s> And finally the case has to let all the heat out. </s>

<s> Keep in mind that video and music producing software will usualy useup a most of the CPU cycles no matter how fast the processor is, the differece is how long it takes to render the project. </s>
