1.1.1	I'm planning on buying a new desktop next month.	St
1.1.2	I'm mainly going to use it for composing music (Cubase or Logic) and just normal web surfing.	St
1.1.3	I don't play games but I do watch movies on my computer a lot I used to think that Mac was way ahead of PC in almost every aspect but now I think they both have their pros and cons.	St
1.1.4	I'd like someone to recommend me a PC as good as or better than the iMac at the price of the 21.5 inch model or simply persuade me to stay with Mac.	St
1.2.1	Alright so first off, there are two options for the 21.5&quot; iMac.	St
1.2.2	You have the 2.5Ghz and the 2.7Ghz which puts your price range at about $1200-$1500.	St
1.2.3	That being said it's fairly easy to pass that up with a standard desktop build.	St
1.2.4	The only things I would pay particular attention to are these: -Macs are incredibly hard, if not impossible, to manually upgrade.	St
1.2.5	That means that if you buy this, and 5years down the road decide you want a faster computer, you're more than likely going to have to buy a completely new iMac.	St
1.2.6	-PCs are much easier to upgrade and if you had a desktop right now at this price and power you could upgrade it later for significantly less money than a Mac.	St
1.2.7	-If you're buying a Mac because it &quot;Doesn't get viruses&quot; then you need to do a little more research.	St
1.2.8	Macs are equally susceptible when compared to a PC to viruses.	St
1.2.9	The only difference is that because most major companies run PCs, many viruses are directed towards affecting PCs.	St
1.2.10	It's just that people haven't taken the time, or found the reason to create viruses for many Macs.	St
1.2.11	But they do exist.	St
1.2.12	-Macs, however, are generally known for working very well with editing programs such as Photoshop and Music Editing software like you mentioned.	St
1.2.13	-PCs run these programs equally well, but the interface is usually less friendly on the PC side and they're slightly less stable, but unnoticeably so.	St
1.2.14	-In addition, the iMac is all-in-one.	St
1.2.15	The tower and the monitor are in one place.	St
1.2.16	This is great for saving space and generally looking sleek, but unfortunately is the main reason why upgrading them later on is so difficult.	St
1.2.17	The body of an iMac is not meant to be opened up.	St
1.2.18	-PCs take up much more space because the monitor and tower are separate, however, it is possible to buy &quot;All in One&quot; PCs too.	St
1.2.19	The only advantage to this is upgrade ability because the tower can be easily opened and parts easily removed.	St
1.2.20	Also many custom towers can be made to look exceptionally amazing.	St
1.2.21	-Also on a side note since you mentioned you were a Mac person, transitioning from the User Interface of a Mac to that of a PC is challenging and vice versa.	St
1.2.22	I assume you're not looking to build your own desktop and would prefer a stock desktop that you could order from Bestbuy or something?	St
1.2.23	If that's the case then here are a few generic desktops that fit roughly in the price range above.	St
1.2.24	I managed to find a few &quot;All in One&quot; PCs which, even though the tower and monitor are together, are still much easier to upgrade than an iMac.	St
1.2.25	I've upgraded a few myself.	St

St
1.2.29	Extra Features iMac: None Extra Features PC: None So to give you a little perspective on what's above: -The more expensive of the iMac and PC makes it fairly clear that the PC would be the way to go.	St
1.2.30	-The less expensive of the iMac and PC would depend more on personal preference as they both have their pros and cons.	St
1.2.31	-Keep in mind that both iMacs can be upgraded to above the listed specs.	St
1.2.32	However, this upgrade can only be done at checkout (before actually getting the iMac).	St
1.2.33	In addition, these upgrades are very costly.	St
1.2.34	Final thoughts: -Buy a Mac if you're comfortable with the User Interface and the features, but keep in mind that upgrading it later on will be near impossible.	St
1.2.35	-Buy a PC if you're looking for an easy way to upgrade it later, or if you would prefer a bit more bang for your buck.	St
1.2.36	I say this because generally speaking, PCs out perform most Macs in both Notebook and Desktop form when it comes to a cost to performance ratio.	St
1.2.37	-Keep in mind that the iMacs can be upgraded at checkout to easily pass the listed PCs, but it will add on another $500-$1000 or more.	St
1.2.38	-Also, when buying a PC, anti-virus software is a must, this will usually run you about $60/3years or you can try Microsoft Security Essentials (which is actually fairly good) for free.	St
1.2.39	-Macs can get viruses, but rarely, so anti-virus software wouldn't be necessary.	St
1.2.40	-The Operating Systems for Macs are noticeably cheaper compared to Windows OS.	St
1.2.41	-When it comes to the lifespan of Macs and PCs it depends on the make and model, but generally speaking you will have less complications with a Mac because everything in them is built to run together well (which is one reason why it can't be upgraded easily).	St
1.2.42	PCs, however, may not last as long, but if a part goes out in them it can be replaced much cheaper than it could be in a Mac.	St
1.2.43	So all of that being said, the final decision is up to you.	St
1.2.44	If you're a gamer, the PC will almost always be the way to go.	St
1.2.45	If you're a media or digital artist than Macs are usually the better option.	St
1.2.46	For someone just looking at audio software and web surfing you could get a more stable build from a Mac, however if you plan on doing anything else or are worried about costs down the road, I would definitely consider a PC.	St
1.2.47	Hope this helped!	St
1.2.48	!	St
1.3.1	for giving me such an excellent answer.	Polite
1.3.2	however, I'd just like to say that with all respect, I don't ever upgrade my computer or find the need to.. when it comes to computers, I pay once and use the device for like 2 to 3 years before buying a brand new one.	St
1.3.3	I actually use PC at my office when I work and like you said, it does run those editing softwares and programs but I am not so much satisfied with its performance..	St
1.3.4	I can easily tell that it's struggling to run it as smoothly as possible and it's quite annoying when it glitches once in a while..	St
1.3.5	I get that PC gives you a lot of options and it's excellent for gaming but like I mentioned, I'm looking for computer with better media performance and I think staying with Mac would be best.	St
1.3.6	If there is any more opinions on this that I should know about, please feel free to reply	St
