i had a similar problem.
it was due to installing and later uninstalling downloaded programs from the net over a period of time.
they had left a lot of junk in the registry.
i got a registry cleaner program mine was system cleaner (4 in 1) that also gets rid of other junk, but there are free ones about.
now when i uninstall programs, i go into the registry to thoroughly remove all junk files belonging to the programs left behind... back up registry first.
(xp/me - create a system-restore point).
go to start &gt; run - type in ''regedit'' (without '''') press f3 start the search facility.
type in name of deleted program.
when i find an old entry with the program name, i delete it.
i know one has to be careful when making changes to the registry, but i've never had a problem with this method and i am careful only to delete those files that have the name of the deleted program.
if i am not sure, i leave it alone.
hope this helps.
