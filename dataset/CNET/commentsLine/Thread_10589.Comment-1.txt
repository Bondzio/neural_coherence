hi, i recently dug out my old pc because i wanted to see if i could use it for a home network but i realised that it probably not good enough for gaming and stuff like that and the cmos battery shoulder holder is broke and wont hold it and the socket which i plug the monitor cable in is on its way out.
so i was wondering whether i could just get a better motherboard and cpu and a bigger hdd too and just use the rest of the stuff thats already there?
and is this really worth doing or expensive because i havnt got loads of money to upgrade it with at the mo.
i've already bought a slight ram upgrade from 64mb sdram to 2 x 128mb i know this still probably isnt enough.
im not sure hoe to find out the type of motherboard i have or cpu?
can anyone tell me how?
i've got it sitting here all open next to me so i can have a look if i need to.
i dont know all the specs but it runs xp home and its got a 40 gb hdd.
its a dell optiplex, do you need to know the exact model?
its one of them old flat desktop ones.
if anyone could help me out that would be great thanx.
dan
