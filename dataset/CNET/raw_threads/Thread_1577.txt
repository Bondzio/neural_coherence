The whole purposes of any &quot;system/bios updates&quot; is to correct known glitches or make it more compatible. If you're doing all you need to do and happy doing it, leave well enough alone. Just keep in mind should a problem arise the potential is there at a system fix level may have been in the works all the time. As a good rule of thumb, when building a new system, I install all bios and h/w updates plus the OS ones then proceed with the apps, etc. to do the tasks required. Even those may ask or require they be updated for best operation. But, again if things are working and stable just accept it. good luck -----Willy
