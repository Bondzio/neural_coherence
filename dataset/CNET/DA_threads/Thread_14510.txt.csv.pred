1.2.1	the dells ' core2quad q9300 is faster than the hp 's phenom 9550. you 'll also need a beefier video card for the hp 's 24 & quot ; monitor so unless the extra 2 & quot ; is important to you , the dell is the better choice .	St
1.3.1	Can you please just give us the links to those PCs its to hard to read all that .	Sug
1.4.1	save yourself some headache down the road , go to a custom build shop near you , take these specs in to them and ask them to build you a similar system , you will be much happier mass produced computers have missing hardware that software makes up for ...	Sug
