<s> I'm having trouble with my Philips CD-RW. </s>
<s> After about 1 hour (approx) after booting up my PC, the tray starts jumping in-&-out all by itself. </s>
<s> Nothing I do seems to help. </s>
<s> I even re-formmatted my HD and reloaded all my software from the original install discs. </s>
<s> Power off and unplug the WIDE IDE cable from failing drive. </s>
<s> See if it does that after you boot after about the same amount of time. </s>
<s> If you leave the case cover off, the reduced heat may fix so so be sure not to change the conditions of this test. </s>
