When I noted that you would see other people's WiFi LANs, that was a clue that you need to change your WiFi LANs RF channel.
Your response was something about the CABLE MODEM channels...
I offer this as a nugget that it is.
By using a less crowded WiFi RF channel 1, 6 or that last number, you will get better performance.
I think your response was because you haven't done this yet or often enough or you don't have your own WAP?
That's a little unclear.
But I want to you to succeed and of course, be safe.
