Photosmart is the brand of the printers, photoret is the technology in the printers.
With photoret 4 you get improved print quality with your pictures lasting up to 65 years.
If you find one with photoret pro, it has the option to use 8 ink printing (ret4 only uses a 6 ink).
The extra two inks dramatically increase quality of colour if your doing black and white printing.
They are greyscale printing.
With pro photos last up to 73 years.
The drops of ink are smaller with photoret 4 than previous versions, so you get better quality and colour.
