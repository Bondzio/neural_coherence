1.1.1	hi guys , i 've been a pc user my whole life looking to switch to mac .	St
1.1.2	problem is that i really like to play counter strike source , and some other older pc games that i have .	St
1.1.3	i know i can install windows xp to play these pc games , but i dont know much about mac hardware .	St
1.1.4	what kind of hardware would i need to run counter strike source good ?	Ques
1.1.5	i was thinking about getting a refurbished dual core mac mini to make the switch the cheapest way possible , but it has integrated graphics .	St
1.1.6	is there any way to put in a video card , or do i need a whole other mac ?	Ques
1.2.1	Changing out the video cards on any Mac , with the exception of the Mac Pro , is next to impossible .	St
1.2.2	You can configure one of the new iMacs with a better video card but can not buy one separately .	St
1.2.3	If your proposed system meets the game requirements , you should be OK .	St
1.2.4	I have no idea what the system requirements are for this game .	St
1.2.5	You could always keep the PC for playing games on and use a KVM switch with your Mac Mini and PC .	Sug
1.2.6	P	St
1.3.1	the requirements for the game are : Windows 98/ME/2000/XP ( 2000/XP recommended ) 1.2GHz processor ( 2.4GHz recommended ) 256MB RAM ( 512MB recommended ) DirectX 7 compatible graphics card ( DirectX 9 recommended ) Mouse Keyboard Internet connection im not sure how this translates into mac hardware , or is it the same thing ?	Ques
1.4.1	Your choice of Windows version Mini runs at 1.6 or 1.83 GHz Mini comes with 512MB RAM expandable to 2GB Not sure about the DirectX thing .	St
1.4.2	Mac 's do n't do DirectX but I have seen Parallels , the other method of running Windows on a Mac , cope with DirectX Mini does not come with a Keyboard or Mouse .	St
1.4.3	Any USB KB or Mouse will do Mini does not come with an Internet connection .	St
1.4.4	You supply that and the Mini will use it .	St
1.4.5	Seems like you are set to go .	St
1.4.6	P	St
1.5.1	But it does come with built-in 10/100/1000 baseT RJ-45 for network connectivity ... http : //www.apple.com/macmini/specs.html	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	Of course the Mini has built-in ethernet .	St
1.7.2	System Requirements for the game include Keyboard Mouse Internet connection .	St
1.7.3	The mini has built-in ethernet but does NOT have an Internet connection .	St
1.7.4	You have to provide that , by arrangement with your Internet service provider .	St
1.7.5	Just because you have built-in ethernet , does not mean you have an internet connection .	St
1.7.6	Ditto with a wireless capability , you still have to have someone to talk to .	St
1.7.7	You seem to have missed the meagre attempt at levity .	St
1.7.8	P	St
1.8.1	im having trouble with this .	St
1.8.2	the mac mini doesnt even have a video card .	St
1.8.3	i also dont think 2 ghz on a mac is the same thing as 2 ghz on a pc .	St
1.8.4	the fastest the imac goes up to is 2.33 ghz but its faster than some 3 ghz single core PCs .	St
1.8.5	is anyone here a pc gamer on their macs ?	Ques
1.9.1	but I just wanted to be clear and point out the various ways that internet connection could be made .	St
1.10.1	http : //www.apple.com/macmini/specs.html Just because it is n't a card in a PCI slot that is removable or replaceable does not make it anything less ...	St
1.10.2	Extending your comment further , the Mac mini does not have a network card or an audio card either - yet it provides full support for networking ( wired and wireless ) and audio ( including optical ) ... and USB and FireWire for peripheral ( and additional network ) connectivity .	St
1.10.3	Now , the video support may not be what you need to support the complex graphics of high-end games ... but it certainly does support video ... quite nicely .	St
1.10.4	As for the CPU clockspeed - call it what ever you want - but it is still a CPU cycle on an Intel CoreDuo CPU ...	St
1.10.5	The same chip in another machine is still the same chip running at the same clockspeed .	St
1.10.6	Comparing different chips ( CoreDuo vs single core ) is not comparing the same chip .	St
1.10.7	You *could* just not worry about it and get a MacPro tower ...	St
1.11.1	I was n't aware that we had to convince you of anything .	St
1.11.2	All you wanted to know was if your game would play on a Mac Mini .	St
1.11.3	I 'm also confused about your statement that the 2Ghz processors on a Mac is not the same as a 2Ghz processor on a PC .	St
1.11.4	This despite the fact that they are both Core 2 Duo 's , are both made by Intel , and are both clocked at 2Ghz .	St
1.11.5	Hey , it 's exactly the same chip .	St
1.11.6	The difference is speed , faster on a Mac , is because the OS is meaner and leaner and is written to take advantage of the 2 cores .	St
1.11.7	Windows is not .	Res
1.11.8	This may be a little simplistic but , a processor with 2 cores running at 2.33GHz should really be faster than a processor with one core running at 3Ghz , Once again , you can always keep your existing PC , get a Mac and a KVM switch .	St
1.11.9	Use the Mac for real work and the PC for your gaming P	St
