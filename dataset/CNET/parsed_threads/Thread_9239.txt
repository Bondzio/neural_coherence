<s> I have an Asus DVD-RW drive that suddenly doesn't recognize data discs. </s>
<s> They appear in Explorer but when I try to read the data the drive opens and asks to insert a disk. </s>
<s> I checked BIOS and everything is ok, also the drive reads (and plays) music and video disks without problem. </s>
<s> I appreciate any help. </s>
<s> Best regards </s>
<s> There are 20 ways I could make a data DVD. </s>
<s> The top 3 are: a. </s>
<s> Drop and drop. </s>
<s> b. </s>
<s> Single closed system. </s>
<s> c. Mulit-session. </s>
<s> Please tell a, b or c or if something else, tell what it is. </s>

<s> Sorry I think I didn't explain myself well. </s>
<s> What I meant was that when I insert a software dvd or cd in the drive autoplay doesn't run and when I try to explore the disk the drive opens ans ejects the disc. </s>
<s> With music and video media everything works just fine </s>
<s> I'm going to give you a few links to read and ponder. </s>

<s> Thanks a lot for your advises I would like to inform you that I tried to install &quot;Autorun Eater&quot; which I downloaded from CNet and McAfee alerts me that the zip file includes a trojan. </s>
<s> Best regards </s>
<s> There are AFFILIATE download links that are known to have trojans. </s>
<s> download.com is clean so far. </s>
<s> There is also some tools that Norton and others will balk at. </s>
<s> This is one of them since it installs a handler and an AV may not like that. </s>
<s> This is as far as I'll explain it. </s>
<s> For a deep explaination see our Spyware forum. </s>
<s> Here it's solving the pest issue. </s>
<s> And in closing, Mcafee is not good enough yet to stop this new breed of pests. </s>
<s> Seems a shame it would paint the cure but not the pest. </s>
