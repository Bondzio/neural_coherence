is this a good time to buy a computer or should i wait a bit?
i'm hearing a lot about amd's new am2 chips and intel's new chips will supposedly going to take on amd for real this time.
with both companies planning new line-ups, does socket 939 have a very long life-span left (i'm hoping for at least 4 years)?
i planned on getting an x2 processor for now, and later get an fx processor if the need arose (though cpu speeds don't seem as important these days).
i've lost a lot of faith in intel so... i really didn't look into the p4.
