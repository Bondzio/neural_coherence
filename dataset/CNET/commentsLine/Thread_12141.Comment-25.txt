i can tell you have been &quot;around&quot; pcs for quite some time, as have i. i have to agree with you right down the line.
i can't remember the false starts and evaporating promises i have seen, yet have enjoyed many early adoption forays.
i enjoyed comdex for years and was always surprised at companies which had a big splash one year and were gone the next.
comdex was cancelled in lv last year.
you and i give the same advice tempered with experience, not just tech know how.
