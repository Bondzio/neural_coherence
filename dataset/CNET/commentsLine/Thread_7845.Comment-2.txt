and after a few tapes i declared &quot;this is nuts!&quot; i went and bought a simple 55 buck dvd recorder, connected it to my vcr, popped in the blank dvd+r, a tape, pressed play then record on the respective boxes and came back in 2 hours to retrieve the finished dvd.
feel free to repeat the lesson i learned.
