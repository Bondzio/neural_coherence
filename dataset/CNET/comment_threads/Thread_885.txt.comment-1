Hey guys, I've got a problem with my pc.
It seems that my PC does not boot and gives me a black screen.
I've tried cleaning it, unplugging all of my hardwares, testing my hard drives and nothing works.
The PC turns on but all it gives me is a blank screen.
Is it my processor, ram, CMOS battery?
Anyone know what the problem is?
I'd appreciate your advices.
Thx
