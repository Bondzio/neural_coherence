this is because there are only 4 gb of address space available using 32-bit addresses.
to give a simple analogy using base 10 math, consider trying to put more than 100 addresses into strictly 2 digit form using only 0-9 for each value.
there are 100 possibilities, from 00 to 99 to be specific.
that last 1 gb of memory that you say is &quot;virtual&quot; is actually the memory reserved for various bits of hardware like sound, video, network and other parts.
&quot;virtual memory&quot; is what an operating system takes off of the hard drive on a computer to use as extra memory space.
