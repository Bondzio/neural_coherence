<s> I believe it is a mobo issue. </s>
<s> Motherboard is a MSI PM8M-V Chip is a CeleronD 2.93 GHZ have installed 512MB ULtra ram PC 3200 Have tried numerous cdroms by different makers. </s>
<s> First try to install XP pro, I'm advised in a Blue screen of death that the acpi button is not comliant and I should update the bios. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> I have updated the bios from version 2.0 to 2.2. </s>
<s> I used the manufacurer's website and am sure I have used the correct drivers. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I also disabled the acpi options in the bios. </s>
<s> I've disabled all the onboard items, tried moving Midway through the ''d'' files the installation slows to a crawl and the installation program claims it cannot ''find'' file driver.cab. </s>
<s> If I try again it will not be able to ''find'' another file in the same section. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> I have tried different CD-ROM drives to get around this issue. </s>
<s> It always crashes about the same place. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> I've tried different installation disks and different operating systems types. </s>
<s> No luck. </s>
<s> Even my Knoppix (linux on cd) cd hangs. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> I've moved cables, the ram, reset the bios, tried diffrent parts. </s>
<s> Nothig is working. </s>
<s> Basically my bag of tricks is empty. </s>
<s> The bios posts just fine, I just can't get any OS to isntall. </s>
<s> Any ideas out there? </s>
<s> Could be power supply rating, bad ram, bad board, bad CPU. </s>
<s> The hard disk is unlikely since KNOPPIX is a CD boot. </s>
<s> Time to call the maker up and ask what parts they want to exchange. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for confirming my opinion. </s>
<s> I've called the seller and will be exchanging the mobo. </s>
<s> I'm just not looking forward to tearing it all apart. </s>
<s> ;-( Such is life. </s>
<s> Thank you again for your time. </s>
<s> It's an overlooked component. </s>
<s> Some try something they had laying around or think &quot;350 Watts should be plenty.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> I'm not sure of the brand, I'm not at work right now. </s>
<s> I doubt it was a name brand. </s>
<s> I did try another different stick of ram and got Knoppix to load but not XP. </s>
<s> Thing is the overzealous person in purchasing immediately took the UPC's for the CPU and Ram to send in for the rebates. </s>
<s> She did this while I was away from my desk and had them mailed before I knew what she had done. </s>
<s> GRRR. </s>
<s> So I can't return the ram or the CPU even if I wanted to. </s>
<s> I would have asked her to wait until I was completely done. </s>
<s> I'll try an alternate power supply first thing in the am. </s>
<s> This is so weird, I've never had a MOBO post but then not work right.. </s>
<s> Thanks again for all the advice, you have know idea how much I value your time! </s>
<s> The sign of failed boots is typical of the 350 and smaller PSUs. </s>
<s> While those should be enough... </s>
