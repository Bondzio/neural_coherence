I'm debating on whether to get a Intel Core 2 Duo E6850 running at 3ghz or a Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 running at 2.4ghz.
The system will be used almost exclusively for gaming and I do not plan on overclocking.
I can get them at the same price at Newegg.
Also, I want to be as future-proof as possible.
So for pure gaming, which is better?
Thanks, Shlomo
