<s> I just set up my home network with a &quot;n&quot; wireless router. </s>
<s> I have 2 laptops with g cards and desktop with a N adapter. </s>
<s> When I check my network with my laptop it shows up as a G network. </s>
<s> I assume that if I am running my only my desktop with the N adapter it will show as a N network. </s>
<s> What happens when I am running my laptop(G) and desktop (N) at the same time. </s>
<s> should allow the g laptops to work. </s>
<s> I have a G router and have mine set to mixed mode so my wireless print server can communicate with my printer. </s>
<s> Some wireless devices don't always use G network. </s>
