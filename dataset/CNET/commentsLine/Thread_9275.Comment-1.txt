i just upgraded about everything in my computer except the case and the hard drives.
when i tried to install windows xp it says there are no hard drives connected.
when the computer boots up and does an ide scan it finds everything, two hard drives and two optical drives, so i thought that at least the bios is seeing everything it should.
however, when i go into the bios setup program it says there are none detected for primary master and slave and for secondary master and slave.
so how can the bios find these drives during it's initial scan but not find them for the setup program?
also, on one of my many restarts i received an error message that said my hard drives are not configured properly.
i'm guessing that if i get this problem worked out windows will then install.
what can i try next?
