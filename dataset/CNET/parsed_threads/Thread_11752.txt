<s> I narrowed my choices down to an Hp pavilion a650y or a Sony Vaio RS, which shood i choose? </s>
<s> In short... http://marketwatch-cnet.cbsi.com/Sony+to+exit+key+handheld+arenas/2100-1040_3-5223580.html Not only they exited and halted production, but they shut out programming information so PDA programmers can't offer support for the existing owners. </s>
<s> Sony, in my book has a wide scorch mark. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> soo,,wat arem you saying, hp or vaio? </s>
<s> Given the choice, Sony fails on the support test. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> don't know about HP but definitly DO NOT BUY the Vaio. </s>
<s> just bought 620 G Modell and three weeks later nothing goes ,harddisk crash.Sony struggeld to repair until i threatend with Consumer Help Group.Now i wait almost week to fix it.Not to mention the lost Data so do good research in this times where the companys just want your cash without service. </s>
<s> Tobis also has a &quot;cheap&quot; Software Pack </s>
<s> I have a Sony Vaio Model: PCV-RZ32G that I purchased in June 2003. </s>
<s> I love it. </s>
<s> I've never had a problem with it. </s>
<s> I am currently using it burn family movies to DVD and also to convert my old VHS home pictures to DVD - using the software that came pre-installed. </s>
<s> My Sony Vaio lapop pcg k15 had the backlight go about 3 weeks out of warranty. </s>
<s> One month later the hard drive went. </s>
<s> Sony Customer service proved to be an oxymoron. </s>
<s> Will never buy another Sony product in my lifetime. </s>
<s> I have 3 HP computers, and three HP printers. </s>
<s> I WILL NEVER BY ANOTHER HP PRODUCT AS LONG AS I LIVE!!!! </s>
<s> It is now July 2005 my problems began in April 2005 so we are taking about a period of 4 months!!! </s>
<s> Problem 1: Computer will not turn on (it is less than 2 months old). </s>
<s> They say owe well well send you a box pack it up and ship it to us. </s>
<s> So I did. </s>
<s> They send it back, claiming that they tested it, and I get a computer back that is missing the memory card (therefore, it will not boot at all). </s>
<s> So I call and of course they cant just send me my memory chip they have to have me send the computer back to them again. </s>
<s> So I do. </s>
<s> And they send it back (supposedly testing it first) and I again get a non-working computer. </s>
<s> So I send it back again, and they send it back again, and you guessed it, it still doesnt work. </s>
<s> So then I get to talk to the Sr. Quality Manager, HP Executive Customer Relations Management who guarantees me that I will get a working computer. </s>
<s> So again I send it and finally they send me a working computer. </s>
<s> But now they had the computer as long as I did. </s>
<s> So I continue to use the products as I have already paid for them and one of the other computers dies.it has a CPU fan that failed and will not boot up because of it. </s>
<s> So I calland again I am told that they cant send me the part (even though I told them I could easily install a CPU fan myself). </s>
<s> So I wait for the box, send the computer back.AND GET THE WRONG COMPUTER BACK!!!!! </s>
<s> Then when I call I am told they have no idea where my computer is but they will have someone call me back. </s>
<s> When they never called back I called them. </s>
<s> They then claim my computer was at their service center the entire time (BULL) and that they havent fixed it yet (BULL) and that I need to send the computer I got back before they can send mine to me. </s>
<s> Then the Service Manager tells me he cant guarantee my computer is coming back to meWHAT THE F***!!!! </s>
<s> He refused to give me anything in writing stating I will even get any computer at all back!!!! </s>
<s> Since I am doing the right thing and sending the wrong computer back I guess I can only hope and pray that I get something in returnBUT NO GUARENTEE AS THE SERVICE MANAGER told me THERE IS NO GUARENTEES IN LIFE!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Answer: neither. </s>
<s> Sony Vaio is a really bad laptop! </s>
<s> I used mine for a whole 8 months before it needed a new hard-drive. </s>
<s> Sony doesn't do any data rescue or anything, so I had to fight through on my own. </s>
<s> Customer Service all but yelled at me when I called, too. </s>
<s> It's now a year and a half later and the cd/dvd drive doesn't work and I have just had to take it in for servicing at Best Buy, where Geek Squad managed to screw things up even more. </s>
<s> The laptop is now just a typewriter. </s>
<s> It's a terrible, terrible product -- a complete waste of money. </s>

<s> Hp was built to make computers and Sony just go back making TV SONY IS NOT A PROFESSIONAL computer manufacturer and get a computer with AMD processor quad-core if your a multi-tasker </s>
