well, there are &quot;intell i/c&quot; abroad the ink carts nowadays.
it knows when its been changed but you should as you already know proceed foward.
it will a nagging sorta thing until it too is empty.
i don't see any way around this as its part of the overall setup by hp and other makers.
while, i suspect the ink displayed is really low its not entirely empty so you can use whatever is left the next until it actually registers empty or won't go any further.
the warning usually refers to a level(20%) left in the ink cart, maybe more.
also, don't prioceed after installing a new ink cart the install process or &quot;align.
one&quot; so it can work at its best.
that too is a nagging condition if not worked on.
