<s> ok - i would think this may be something that is solely about what a user wants.....but my question is this. </s>
<s> Currently i have a cdrw burner and a dvd burner installed on my desktop, is this set up better than saying having just a dvdcdr combo burner? </s>
<s> in other words, which is best, one burner or two? </s>
<s> I put in a pair of DVDRW drives. </s>
<s> The only reason for CDRW is if it's leftovers or &quot;free.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> two drives come in handy. </s>
<s> i also like to have 2 drives so i can leave my current favorite game cd/dvd loaded and always ready to play. </s>
<s> cheap dvd burners aren't really that much more expensive than their read-only counterparts. </s>
<s> I have two DVD-RW's and a CD-RW which covers most eventualities. </s>
<s> and I get to burn 2 disks at a time. </s>
<s> but I'd definitely go for two seperate ones it makes burning a lot faster in some modes and if one gives up you still have the second till you get a replacement. </s>
<s> Definately two Dvd burners I use 2 and have done for a long time it is just easier to manage your burning jobs,I use Pioneer because i was told that they were the best by a technician at my local computer shop this is just a personnel choice now,i also like that getting updated drivers is easy from the pioneer site. </s>
<s> I have an internal DVD-RW burner plus an external same. </s>
<s> It's always good practice to have a backup. </s>
