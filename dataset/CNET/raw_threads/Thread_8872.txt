The WAP needs to be configured to extend a network from a WIFI router so that coverage is available for all corners in the office. Having little knowledge in networking, this task was meant to provide some exposure on configure network devices. However i cant seem to get the WAP going. I'd tried almost every single operation mode that is given with universal repeater seems to be the most plausible option to go for, in which i can get connected to the WAP from other devices but no access to internet. Any guides/pointers would be much appriciated. (Do excuse my posting should it contain any errors because its my first time posting).

After all, a traineeship implies being trained. And showing you're open to learn from him makes a good impression. Kees

It's just that i'd like to somehow try myself first before i go to my supervisor for help else it'll make me look like a lazy person no trying. So far the options i tried I had no clue or whatsoever they does so it does help if you give me some general idea/description on where should i be heading towards. Thanks for the reply

If it requires information about the installed system you ask for that. I've encountered new IT staffers that get upset as I go to the manual and we read it together. They don't last long. Bob
