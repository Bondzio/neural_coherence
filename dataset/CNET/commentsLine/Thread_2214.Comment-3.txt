on top of what robert offered to do, you should start looking at a replacement or swap it out, the psu.
provided a direct replacement or one that can work for the time being, see if that makes any improvements.
besides heat stress, a weak or poor psu can cause restarts.
however, you can stop restarts as that is a bios action upon any failure.
in order to stop the re-looping of restarts, do that check the bios and &quot;disable that option&quot;.
