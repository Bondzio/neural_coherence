1.1.1	Greetings, I am interested to build a Home Theater PC and would like to know if there is a graphic cards that fit the following requirement: (1) PCI-E interface.	St
1.1.2	(2) HDMI output port.	St
1.1.3	(3) Component video (YCbCr) output port.	St
1.1.4	(4) Can support both Blu-ray and HD-DVD players.	St
1.1.5	I did the research and narrow down to the VisionTek X1650PRO HDMI.	St
1.1.6	However, I do not know if card is reliable & support of Blu-ray and HD-DVD players.	St
1.1.7	Thanks for your help.	Polite
1.2.1	http://www.geek.com/news/geeknews/2006Aug/gee20060814037985.htm &quot;In order for a commercial Blu-ray disc to play, you need to be able to decrypt the High-Bandwidth Content Protection (HDCP) copy protection it uses.	St
1.2.2	This can only be done via a DVI or an HDMI connection to a graphics card that supports HDCP decryption.	St
1.2.3	Currently, Sony says there are no cards that support this.&quot; Later we finally started to see a few cards but you discover you can't use most displays since they must have HDCP as well.	St
1.2.4	It's a minefield of issues so be sure you have return privileges if you find your selection doesn't work.	St
1.2.5	http://compreviews.about.com/od/general/a/HDParadox.htm covers this as well as http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/vista_cost.html tells more about the Vista angle of copy protection.	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	There will be no commercial content from the Component video (YCbCr) output port at HD resolution since that connection is not encrypted.	St
1.3.2	Bob	St
1.4.1	Dear Bob, Thank you for your answer, the graphic card that I had mentioned The VisionTek X1650PRO HDMI has the following description in its spec: &quot;256MB DDR2 Memory HDCP eprom onboard.&quot; That is why I interested to do more study about this graphic card.	St
1.4.2	However, you had mentioned another ineresting point that I did not know before about HDCP on the monitor/TV as well.	St
1.4.3	Did you mean that my widescreen 1080p LCD HDTV need to also support HDCP?.	St
1.4.4	Again, many thanks for your information.	Polite
1.4.5	Regards, Hiep Nguyen	St
1.5.1	But many have tried this only to discover...	St
1.5.2	It doesn't always work.	St
1.5.3	The industry is not making this &quot;easy.&quot; Bob	St
