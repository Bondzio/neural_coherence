<s> Hi, I was just wondering if you absolutely have to order new cartridges from Dell with a Dell printer? </s>
<s> It seems like such a hassle to have to order cartridges everytime you run out, and then wait for it to arrive. </s>
<s> I have a Dell Photo Printer 720. </s>
<s> I was reading the manual and it said that it is recommended to use Dell cartridges, which made me think maybe there are other ones that fit the printer. </s>
<s> Does anyone know some other ones that would fit it? </s>
<s> Also, if there is really a huge difference using another type in the printer.. would it cause any major problems? </s>
<s> Thanks, Erica. </s>
<s> The reason Dell got into printers is to get into the &quot;reordering business of ink&quot;. </s>
<s> Replacement ink is a big industry and for companies like HP and Epson it's a profit maker. </s>
<s> Unfortunely you do need Dell replacement ink in order to fit properly. </s>
<s> The printers themseleves are build by Lexmark, only different in that they accept Dell monikered ink carts. </s>
<s> Some have reported to wittle the ink cart abit to make a fit, thus they can use Lexmark ink carts which can be slightly cheaper or more slection from a source for replacement outlets. </s>
<s> Of course you can refill Dell carts too. </s>
<s> Not good, some users have given thier Dell printers away as the &quot;deal printer&quot; are basic if brought thrown-in as part of the package. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
