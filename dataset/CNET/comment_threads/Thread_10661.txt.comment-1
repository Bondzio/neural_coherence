I have an Hp Pavilion m7570n.
It's default PSU is http://www.atxpowersupplies.com/300-watt-power-supply-bestec-atx-300-12zcdr.php I want to upgrade and I was looking at buying http://www.atxpowersupplies.com/300-watt-power-supply-bestec-atx-300-12zcdr.php but how do I know if it will fit or not.
Thanks.
