i had to build my own computer too 2 years ago, because i wanted a good system in regards to my budget, so i ended up building my own computer, .
it was fun, took me about 3 hours .
i am using it right now, typing this post, lol, but the comp's gonna retire soon, gonna build a new comp by the end of this year, the one right now is getting out dated, almost all the parts aren't capable of handling new games, such as fear or nfs:mw.
i currently have a radeon 9600xt 128mb, intel p4 3.0e ghz ht, and 512mb ddr pc3200 ram.
the processor is still okay, besides the fact that it generates a great deal of heat from just idling, but this cpu is still not enough for the amount of multi-tasking i am doing right now, that's why i am going to put an amd dual core in my new comp.
cheers tony
