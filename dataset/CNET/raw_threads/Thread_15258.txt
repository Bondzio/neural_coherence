If you look at the Cnet reviews the big flaw with it is it has no AGP or PCI-Express slot. My question is should I just get a regular PCI graphics card or upgrade my motherboard, which means I would be upgrading my CPU to a dual core(just because I want one) and would need new memory. Are regular PCI graphics card any good, I know that the PCI-express is the current technology, but would I be able to get by maybe another year and just use my free PCI slot. Thanks

I would say new motherboard to keep up with the new technologies, you get better performance also. But if you add up the cost of all the hardware requires(motherboard, CPU, memory, maybe new cables) it would be better to buy a new computer. PCI will do for maybe a year but then you would need a new computer anyway. I would honestly buy a new core 2 duo desktop as they have great performandce and are relatively cheap. Anthony
