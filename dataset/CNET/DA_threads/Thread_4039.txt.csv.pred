1.1.1	I have a keyboard called & quot ; Compaq Internet Keyboard With 22 Hot Keys & quot ; but I used it so much that the keys started falling out , so I keep it in the original package that it came in .	St
1.1.2	I got another HP internet keyboard and mouse on eBay , but it is larger and it does n't have as many functions as the other keyboard does , so I got an adapter for the keyboards and I have them both connected .	St
1.1.3	Now I have two keyboards and two mice and they both work at the same time because you can connect just about anything with a USB connection ... . and all these things install by themselves ...	St
1.1.4	I also have two USB extensions .	St
1.1.5	They light up .	St
1.1.6	And they can plug in , but they can also work just by connecting to the computer .	St
1.1.7	One of the speaker systems that I have on it has the green audio plug , and it has a usb connection that it gets its power from .	St
1.1.8	And there are USB Hard Drives , Zip Drives , Jaz Drives , Tape Drives , Jump Drives , and Edge Drives .	St
1.1.9	( They have USB memory card readers , But the memory card reader slots are built into my computer , so I do n't need a USB one . )	St
1.1.10	If somebody has at least one of all of these things , and there seems to be no limit to how many USB devices can be connected to just one computer , how can the computer provide power to all of the devices ? ?	Ques
