<s> Does anyone know of a good quality wireless backlit keyboard? </s>
<s> Where not just media or extra keys are lit, but the QWERTY keys are illuminated as well? </s>
<s> I'm looking for something for an HTPC setup. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Can you imagine the power requirements for such? </s>
<s> How big a battery would it need? </s>
<s> This board'll be out in September. </s>
<s> The CNET review I link to below has done a good job of outlining the pros and cons, and the MS Hardware link below has a nice interactive multimedia demo of the board's features. </s>
<s> Seems like it'll be perfect for HTPC use, though the price certainly has some kick to it (I wish they'd offer it without the mouse bundled in for $50-$75 less). </s>
