I first installed XP Pro on it but uninstalled it cause I couldnt find the drivers for the USB Controller, or the mass storage device(if you could help with that, i would install pro which i need again). When Pro was installed the OS saw the 120GB. Since I couldn't find the those 2 drivers off of sony's site (had all the other drivers) I decided to just uninstalled Pro and install the OS with the VGN-S150 recovery kit which has home edition which i really don't want. With the recovery cd's everything looked great, but when I check to see how much space the recovery took up on the hard drive it said it took up 3.08GB, and only 15GB are free. I reinstalled with the recovery cd's and same thing happend. In BIOS the the system saw the whole 120GB drive. So know the system see it, but for some reason the recovery cd's partition it wrong or something. Any Ideas?
