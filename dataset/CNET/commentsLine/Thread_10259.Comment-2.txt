1. the motherboard drivers are not installed.
even with seasoned windows 98se owners i still find the owners to not be aware of the motherboard driver packages.
2. the front usb ports are often of the wrong wiring type.
most were fine back in usb 1.1 days, but not on today's hardware.
workaround?
use the rear ports.
in closing, why was the machine details left out?
if you had followed the forum note i might have offered a link to the driver i suspect.
