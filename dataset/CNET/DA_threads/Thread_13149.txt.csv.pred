1.1.1	I was looking at the Lite On SOHW-1633S and the Plextor 712A/SA.	St
1.1.2	The Lite On is $40 cheaper and I wanted to know which one was better.	St
1.1.3	Both got good reviews on Newegg.	St
1.1.4	Oh and I was planning on purchasing a Lite On LTR-52327S as a cheap CD-R writer as well.	St
1.1.5	It also got good reviews so I figured the DVD writer should be good too.	St
1.1.6	Please help.	St
1.1.7	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	I just bought a 832S DVD burner for 35 bucks after rebate.	St
1.2.2	Sold my old CD burner installed for 30 bucks.	St
1.2.3	For 5 bucks I got an upgrade from CD burner to DVD:) The DVD burns CDs as well.	St
1.2.4	Why buy a seperate drive?	Sug
1.2.5	~Tom	St
1.3.1	I bought a Lite On 1633S because it was cheaper and I stupidly forgot that one gets what they pay for.	St
1.3.2	I bought it on a Thursady; it was dead by Sunday morning.	St
1.3.3	Aside from quality issues, the Plextor comes with Roxio, while the Lite On comes with Nero.	St
1.3.4	Nero is not an acceptable substitute for Roxio, so - case closed!	St
1.3.5	Plextor!	St
1.4.1	After years with both, Plextor feels no different and in fact I feel like I overpaid for such.	St
1.4.2	Now I just pick out the cheap unit, place it in the rack with airspace top/bottom and good cooling.	St
1.4.3	Never lost an unit that wasn't 4 years old.	St
1.4.4	Roxio bolloxes up the system too much for me, so I prefer Nero and more often than not I use CDBurnerXP since it gets the job done without complaining it didn't come with the drive.	St
1.4.5	See http://www.cdburnerxp.se/ Bob	St
1.5.1	Look at http://www.cdspeed2000.com/ for test results and more.	St
1.5.2	Bob	St
1.6.1	Its all down to personal choice... but in a market driven by &quot;more bang fer ya bucks&quot; , Ive been a Lite-On devotee for years.	St
1.6.2	I paid 170 for an 8 speed CDwriter 4 years ago, and within a month or two, Lite-On were selling 24 speed writers for 60.	St
1.6.3	As friends bought theirs, I was sitting smugly waiting for their cheapo plastic burners to fall to pieces.	St
1.6.4	They didnt.	St
1.6.5	Mine did.	St
1.6.6	Since then, Ive built and sold dozens of PCs, and upgraded and repaired many more.	St
1.6.7	Whether it was a CDRom, or a CDWriter, or now DVD/CD burner combos, Ive never yet had a problem with a Lite-On.	St
1.6.8	Quite often, on a clean system with decent processor andm emory, they actually peform at max speed or above.	St
1.6.9	Like someone else who posted here, I also agree with the software bundle.	St
1.6.10	Roxio has its fans, but many more detractors.	St
1.6.11	Nero is simple to use and installs like a dream with little need for end user input.	St
1.6.12	From this users point of view (in my own PCs and the ones Ive built) you cant go wrong with a Lite-On, and they cost a heck of a lot less than most other brands	St
