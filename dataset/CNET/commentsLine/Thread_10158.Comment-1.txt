hi all, a colleague at my university is using an airport time capsule 1tb (model a1355) to share files with his students wirelessly.
the machines are running leopard 10.5.8 and it works well but it will only allow 20 wireless clients at a time.
all the client machines log in with a password.
when you remove one of the 20, another can log in.
the tech specs on the apple website just say that it accepts wireless guest access and there is no mention of a 20 client limit.
i looked right through airport utility and couldn't find where the number of wireless clients could be configured.
does anybody know if this is the hard limit for the number of wireless clients for an airport time capsule 1tb (model a1355)?
if it is not a hard limit does anybody know how to change it?
any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!
