<s> I need help choosing between two great cards made by ati. </s>
<s> It is between the x850 and the x1600xt. </s>
<s> I have heard that the x1600xt is the way to go but i still need help deciding.I am building a computer now with the DFI rdx200 cf-dr motherboard, 1gb of ddr memory, amd 4000+, 120 gig hard drive used to play games fast. </s>
<s> the x850xt is the faster card but lacks SM3 features (like HDR). </s>
<s> however, those features require quite a bit of graphics horsepower, and they're of little use on mid-range (like the x1600xt) or low-end cards since if you turn on SM3 features, frame rates drop so low as to make the game unplayable. </s>
<s> here are benchmarks for both: http://www23.tomshardware.com/graphics.html?modelx=33&model1=310&model2=304&chart=94 therefore, i suggest the x850xt over the x1600xt. </s>
<s> if you can afford a few dollars more, an nvidia 7600gt is a better choice... comparable speed to x850xt and SM3 features. </s>

<s> The cheapest X850XT is $164 on newegg.com. </s>
<s> The cheapest 7600GT is $149 on newegg.com (after a $10 mail-in rebate.) </s>
<s> I know which one I'd get. </s>
<s> The only problem is tha newegg does not ship to Canada! </s>
<s> here are links to a radeon x800gto2 ($199 CAD + shipping) and a geforce 7600gt ($230 CAD + shipping) from a canadian web shop. </s>
<s> the x800gto2 can be soft-modded to an x850xt. </s>
<s> it's painless (i have one and have done the mod myself.) </s>

<s> If you know anyone who lives in the US of A, ask them to purchase it for you. </s>
<s> Once they receive it, ask them to send it to you via UPS. </s>
<s> If you don't know anyone from the US of A, find another website that ships to Canada. </s>
<s> Well I live in the USA and have a Saphire X1600XT thats new that I bought from newegg...if you want you can buy it. </s>
<s> My email is fgamer2005@yahoo.com </s>
<s> Thanks for the offer but I changed my mind, I want the x850 xt. </s>
<s> Thanks anyways. </s>
