recently, i have begun looking into digital notepads.
however, all of them seem to require paper, which is something i definately don't want.
some e-readers like the iliad have got a similar function, but they are expensive, and i don't need the e-reader functions.
a pc-tablet is not an option, because i want it to function independantly from my laptop while still being able to see what i'm writing/doodling.
any suggestions?
