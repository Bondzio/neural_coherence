good day, regarding w/ your concern sir mataharimata, if the red diag light lit-up and always stays red, it means that it may be have a software or hardware failure on the unit.
the only way to troubleshoot the device is just to reset it twice for 20-30secs.
after that try to ping the routers ip addr.
w/c is 192.168.1.1. if it still getting a request time out pinging the rotuers ip addr.
try usign another pc to ping the router.
once youve done all this troubleshooting steps and still unable to ping or get replys pinging the routers ip addr.
it only means that the router is deffective or theres already a hardware failure on it.
(i hope this may help you.)
thanks and have a productive day ahead.
