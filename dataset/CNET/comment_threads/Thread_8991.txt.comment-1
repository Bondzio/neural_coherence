I have a Thinkpad R50 laptop.
It runs Windows XP with service pack 3.
I bought this laptop used for school and it seem to work well except for the wireless.
I can't seem to bring the icons up or tell if it's working.
I went to Thinkpads (Leveno) website and downloaded all the drivers I thought I might need, no luck.
I do have a yellow question mark next to my network controller in my Device Manager could this be the problem.
It has a Intel 3B2100 802.11b wireless card installed.
I do not have a start up disc.
Any help on this would be appreciated
