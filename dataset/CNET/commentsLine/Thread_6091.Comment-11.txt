i have tried and tried to get my netgear updated....i have two options.....auto update....i tried that and got a dialog box stating no new updates.....and manual by downloading.....that didn't work either this is a test for my patience i am sure..... now that the holidays are over i am spending time on my occupation.....funniest thing....about having to make money...... again i appreciate your responses....i just am going to have to box this up and use the old b band dlink router until i can save up and buy another brand of router to replace the netgear products.
needless to say i am not impressed by either hp or netgear.....they won't be at the top of my list on replacement of anything.. i finally got to a unhappy customer representative.
his response was i should have bought a business hp laptop....what a jerk...... i am suprised at the way these people want to spend my money..... really takes the cake.
if i find anything else out i will let you know....
