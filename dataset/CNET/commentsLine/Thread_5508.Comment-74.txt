i had the same question, and after research found that manufacturers seem to use their cheapest drives in the plug&play usb externals-profit, short warrantee also 5 volts@.5a is really not much power, especially for dc to run through such small wire with multiple connectors, both crimped and friction, usually without gold, and expect to drive 2 motors.
i have a 5yr.old xp3 media center hp, with 4 sata ports on asus motherboard, 2 mount positions for internal hard drives.
warrantee on original hd was up, so after research i bought 3 western digital caviar black 1tb tfals (5yr warrantee) oem, mounted 2 internal, 1 external in a rosewill e-sata/usb2 case which has it's own ac-dc power supply, switch and fan w/switch (newegg $25 supersale), connected it e-sata.
1 internal-use constantly, 2nd internal-do an occasional clone to, external-usually back-up to or clone, backing up mostly photos and video to dvd along the way.
using acronis true image home (could be more user-friendly) to back-up and clone, will do 500+gb in 45min.
i use 2 registry cleaners and they are tempted to remove the 4 inactive, (not powered most of the time) but recognized drives.
it is nice to be able to boot-run any of the hd's by removing side cover and switching wires.
like going back to a restore point without using system restore, and find a problem.
wish i knew how to enter bios setup to give me the choice of which hard drive to boot????
anyhow, cspitser, with this setup i don't see much difference between internal or external, just that one is easy to run off with!
good question.
