i don't get boot errors (file missing).
i do get freezes in windows which means i have to restart.
after restarting i still have no boot errors, no f1 or f2 options appear...clean boot.
the freezes are sporadic.
i can work with no problem for hours but the next time i turn on the machine, i get a freeze, no matter what app i am using, within 5 mins.
i work nights what's your excuse for replying at 3.00am?
thanx.
