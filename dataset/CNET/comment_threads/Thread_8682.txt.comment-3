Thanks - do you mean that I should purchase the PC w/o the drives?
And then what - add them myself?
I may be mistaken - but doesn't that void the warranty?
And though I used to try and do this stuff myself, these days I'd rather not - too busy.
So I'd still have to carry it off somewhere.
So given my preferences...would it still be better to add the drives later?
And can you explain what a &quot;ALL FORMAT DVD+/- R/W&quot; is actually?
I had read that eventually CD-specific drives are going to go away and the DVD drives will handle both applications.
Is this what you are referring to?
