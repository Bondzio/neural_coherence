I recently picked up an imation flash drive.
It's advertised as 8GB, but windows only shows 7.52GB of available space.
So I called Imation and asked them what was up with that.
They indicated that was normal, so I asked them why they advertised it as an 8GB drive if it really wasn't.
The tech assured me it was an 8GB drive, so I asked him, if I tried to transfer 8GB of data to the drive, would it hold it?
He said, &quot;No.&quot; Sound like false advertising to you?
Sure does to me.
Is this standard for all flash drives, and if so, why?
