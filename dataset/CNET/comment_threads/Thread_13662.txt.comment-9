Sounds like a virtual port.
In my other post I suggested you try backing out of the bluetooth software you seemed to suggest was related to the modem going missing.
If it worked before the new software but not afterwards, it would make sense to verify the suspicion by removing that software and seeing what would happen.
In fact, remove it and see if you don't have a restore point available that's prior to that time.
