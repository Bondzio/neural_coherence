I dont know alot about computers so im worried about playing aorund with it 2 much without help but windows etc is stored on the c drive and it is always at low disk space. How can i get windows to load and install programs on the E drive so there is plently of room. Is there any advantages to the way it is set up now. Thanks for your help.

He should use Windows XP setup to delete both partitions and then create a new one covering the whole 604 GB disk and install XP on that. Kees
