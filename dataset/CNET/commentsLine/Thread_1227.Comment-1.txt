hi!
i own a p4 2.8ghz, qdi superb4fx mobo, 400w psu, geforce 4 ti 4600. it's been having some problems lately.
well, let me start at the beginning.
a few weeks ago, i had a similar problem in which the computer wouldn't turn on, but found the culprit to be some fishy software.
recently, for the big game, i was making a big hole in the wall to let the cable wire through the wall.
while making the hole i saw some electrical wires and thought it'd be best if i shut down the power.
well, my power plug thingies in the basement only had one for the entire floor, which my computer is on.
so i turned the computer off, unplugged all the wires to the wall.
well, after i turned the power back on, i smelled something burning.
i thought it was my sister's new found (not) skill of the culinary arts.
it wasn't, and after spending ten minutes looking around, i am sure it is coming from the computer.
no idea how, but...i didn't want it to turn on with that smell, so i checked all the fans; they all look good.
so, i tried to turn it on, but nothing happened.
the last time the problem occured, the cold cathode light would come on for just a second and the hs/f would spin momentarily before dying.
now, neither items happen.
but the odd thing is when i was about to chuck it, i realized the motherboard led power light was on!
does that mean anything?
or is it just false hope?
just want to know.
thanks in advance!
