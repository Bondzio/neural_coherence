HI I have a Dell Dimension 5100 - purchaced 2 years ago.
I also use Norton, AdAware SE, Spybot, C-Cleaner and Windows Defender.
I run regular Defrags and regular Internet history and temp files deletions.
YET my compuet is getting slower, especially when on the internet.
Is there anything that anyone can suggest?
