who sets it up and fixes this one?
i wonder if there is something basically wrong with the machine.
that is, all nice parts but i could not figure out if said windows was a fresh install or some transplant.
transplants usually go horribly wrong.
bob ps.
my thought on the power supply is, seems small.
hope it's a single rail model.
