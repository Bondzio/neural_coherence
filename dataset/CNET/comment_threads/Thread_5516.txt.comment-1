Hello!
I recently bought a Toshiba Libretto 100ct operating on Windows 98se, and included with it was an external floppy drive (PCMCIA connecter).
After I plug it in and try and open up a floppy from [my computer; drive a:], it says &quot;A:/ is not accessible, the device is not ready&quot;.
Now, after a little research I found out that there is no driver installed so the only way to get files off the floppy is to do a file copy from MS-DOS mode.
It tells me to switch in msdos mode to A: , but when I do this it cannot read drive A: ... For this reason, I do not believe that this external floppy drive is considered as drive A: , but do not know what a PCMCIA card command is and how to move files from the floppy to the computer itself.
Thanks
