<s> Well, I have a Dell Inspiron 530 and I just swapped out a failing 250 gig hard drive with a new 1TB one. </s>
<s> I installed Windows Vista Home that came with my computer and the driver disk that came with my PC, but the Ethernet controller didn't install. </s>
<s> I downloaded a few of the drivers from the Dell website and tried them, and the sign isn't there anymore, BUT I still have the same problem as before, I can't fully connect to the internet. </s>
<s> The computer is connecting to a router via a Wireless-N Linksys adapter. </s>
<s> Perhaps the wrong driver installed? </s>
<s> I'd give you guys the model of the LAN card but I have no idea how to find it. </s>
<s> It's very frustrating and I know this same thing has been asked over and over and I've looked but I can't seem to find help. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> It says that I'm connected to the internet but only for a few minutes. </s>
<s> I try to get on google but it keeps trying to connect without ever doing so. </s>
<s> It eventually goes back to saying I'm on a local connection, not internet. </s>
<s> Assume you loaded router software/Linksys? </s>
<s> I finally figured it out. </s>
<s> It was the outdated Linksys driver. </s>
<s> Amazing. </s>
<s> I had version 1.02 which I had downloaded from their website, and I somehow came across 1.04, which magically fixed it. </s>
<s> Wish they had some sort of notification. </s>
<s> I was off by .02 </s>
