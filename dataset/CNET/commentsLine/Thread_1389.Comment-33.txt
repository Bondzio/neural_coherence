to store music and photos and surf the net you do not need to replace your pc.
of course you need to replace your tiny 20 gb hard disk.
i own a 3ghz p4 pc and a 933 mhz p3 (more or less equivalent to yours).
both perform beautifully.
i got the p4 because i edit videos and that was a litte too much for the p3.
i needed more speed in rendering the videos.
the p4 is about 30% faster than the p3 in my video work.
as for needing usb2 you can get a pci usb2 card for about $19.
that is what i did with my p3.
broadband works fine in both.
there is no difference in speed between the two.
even the fastest internet connection is a lot slower than any modern pc (i would say above pentium 2).
get the largest hard disk size you can afford.
most brands include drivers to install them in any pc, whether the bios accept them or not.
so, while your needs do not include video editing and mpeg2 rendering or anything very cpu speed dependent keep your present pc.
