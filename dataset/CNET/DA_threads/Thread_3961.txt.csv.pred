1.1.1	Hey Guys , I 'm trying to figure out what all components to buy to get a wireless media playing setup .	St
1.1.2	I 'm an enthusiast .	St
1.1.3	Not a novice but not an expert either .	St
1.1.4	Only good thing is currently I have a nothing else than 20mbps internet connection from TWC and looking to buy everything else .	St
1.1.5	So I 'm open to options .	St
1.1.6	What I need : - Wireless access to internet for laptops and cell phones = so a wireless-N router .	St
1.1.7	- Streaming to HDTV from internet and local ( NAS/USB-HDD ) media = an HDTV + Roku/Google/Apple-TV , I 'm okay with 720p if 1080p does n't work well in wireless .	St
1.1.8	- Want to set it up once and hide all wired connections .	St
1.1.9	( keep them away from my kids ' reach ) .	St
1.1.10	What I do n't need : - Cable TV via internet/cable/sattelite .	St
1.1.11	- Watch NBA , NFL , NASCAR ( I 'm an F1 and Cricket guy .. ) .	St
1.1.12	Options I considered , with pros/cons to the best of my knowledge : A. Wireless-N router + HDTV with Google-TV ++ Router can handle most media on my USB HDD and stream to TV via DLNA ++ A keyboard for remote helps dealing with UI when you want to stream .	St
1.1.13	-- Google TV reviews are n't great .	Polite
1.1.14	( http : //reviews.cnet.com/digital-media-receivers/logitech-revue-google-tv/4505-6739_7-34165117.html # reviewPage1 ) -- Cost B. Wireless-N router + HDTV ( w/o WiFi ) + PS3 ++ BD player + gaming in addition to all I need .	St
1.1.15	++ Better support for media formats than opption A .	St
1.1.16	-- PS3 cost .	St
1.1.17	-- Do n't think net-browsing via PS3 Controllers would be easy .	St
1.1.18	C. Wireless-N router + HDTV ( w/o WiFi ) + Roku XS ++ Cheapest option -- Roku has no DLNA right now .	St
1.1.19	-- Internet streaming from selected sites only , no free fledged browse and watch what you wnat like in options A and B. I 'm assuming that a good Wireless-N router ( e.g .	St
1.1.20	Linksys E4200 or NetGear N750 ( WNDR4000 ) ) would be enough to stream HD contents from my USB drive to the TV without any other equipment ? ?	Ques
1.1.21	That way I can have a static setup where I download using my laptop to the HDD and then play it on TV later w/o changing any wired connections .	St
1.1.22	My current preferences are : NetGear N750 ( WNDR4000 ) + LG 42LV3700 ( 42 & quot ; , LED , 1080p , 60Hz , with WiFi ) + PS3 == 130 $ + 650 $ + 250 $ = 1030 $ NetGear N750 ( WNDR4000 ) + LG 42LV3700 ( 42 & quot ; , LED , 1080p , 60Hz , with WiFi ) + Roku XS == 130 $ + 650 $ + 100 $ = 880 $ ( LG 42LV3500 viz w/o WiFi is just 20 $ cheaper than LG 42LV3700 ) Please help me out .	St
1.1.23	I 'm open to suggestions on different brands etc as well .	St
1.2.1	You find some folk that will disagree but if you want a committee solution with the lowest common denominator and no support do that .	St
1.2.2	( Just do n't tell me later it did n't fast forward rewind , etc . )	St
1.2.3	OK I have the Logitech Revue and well , I 'm going to go us it right now .	St
1.2.4	I spent 99 bucks on it and have a simple Netgear something 3500 and it works fine .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
