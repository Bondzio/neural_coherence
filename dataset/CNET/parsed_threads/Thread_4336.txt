<s> My kitten knocked over my external hdd and now it is clicking! </s>
<s> My computer will not recognize it. </s>
<s> Is there anyway I can recover the data. </s>
<s> If anyone has had a similar problem, how much did it cost you to recover your data? </s>
<s> But clickers almost always run about 600 bucks at www.drivesavers.com Can I ask why there is no backup? </s>
<s> Recovery costs so much that backup looks cheap. </s>

<s> This was my back up drive!! </s>
<s> I have almost all my files on the 2 other drives I have. </s>
<s> I think I may have lost 3-4 folders. </s>
<s> These folders however had movies, tv shows and pictures! </s>
<s> Whew. </s>
<s> Sorry, you have the &quot;click of death&quot; which usually means no real work around. </s>
<s> Its a h/w fault, that will fail entirely. </s>
<s> Since, you mention you have some other backup, then consider the ext. </s>
<s> HD a lost. </s>
<s> You can if possible buy another similar HD itself, replace the old with new of the enclosure, just buy the right type, even a larger one if you like. </s>
<s> All too often as stated here in the storage forum, you won't recover much or all of it should you persist in doing so. </s>
<s> If possible, try the warranty path, maybe the replacement cost will be low or even free except for minor costs. </s>
<s> However, the data is pretty much toast. </s>
<s> The last gasp, is to remove the ext. </s>
<s> HD inside and mount in a desktop system and try to recover data. </s>
<s> Next time, have the ext. </s>
<s> HD somewhere not too exposed to kitty. </s>
<s> My cats don't trouble mine, as I use Velcro strips to keep in place. </s>
<s> idea! </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
