<s> Hello cNET, My name's Robert, and I recently got a upgraded video card which has been causing some issues once I installed it. </s>
<s> I was using a Radeon HD 4600 series then upgraded to an ASUS Radeon HD 7770. </s>
<s> Before installing the new card I uninstalled the old driver through Control Panel, then shutdown, installed new card, rebooted and installed the new driver. </s>
<s> During my gaming sessions I would notice random screen tears happening, it would only be for less than a second but it would happen every few hours sometimes back to back when it did occur. </s>
<s> After the tears started to become more frequent then I would be getting blue screens, I was always checking my temps they were fine, my 6pin is connected. </s>
<s> I then read online to install &quot;Driversweeper&quot; to remove all existing drivers that may be causing interference which I did, then after I uninstalled those drivers it had me reboot, now during startup and I can't get to my desktop without getting a bluescreen. </s>
<s> I was just going to whipe my computer with my Vista disk but that is not working. </s>
<s> Any way to resolve this without whiping my computer? </s>
<s> But not one code from a blue screen so I'm going to write it's some overtaxed power supply. </s>
<s> I see various sites write about 100 Watts just for this card and http://www.amd.com/us/products/desktop/graphics/7000/7770/Pages/radeon-7770.aspx#3 asks for a 500 Watt or better PSU. </s>
<s> While I'm inside I'd replace the CPU heatsink compound and ask the machine's maker about BIOS updates and compatibility. </s>

<s> Sorry I was at work when I made this post so I wasn't able to provide better information. </s>
<s> I found out that my power supply is in total 700 watts. </s>
<s> I'm not sure of a program I could use to show all my information, for example the dxdiag doesn't display my information for some reason. </s>
<s> I know this much about my computer... Intel Quad Core Q6600 2.40GHZ Heatsink is a Hyper Master 212 Plus Asus Radeon HD 7770 8 Gigs of Ram OCZ 700 watt PSU (12v) Windows Vista 64bit Below I was able to provide a screenshot of the bluescreen I am getting. </s>
<s> I tried swapping out the Radeon 7770 with the 4600 series I was using before I was getting the Bluescreen and I still get it right before it shows the Windows logo then goes to desktop. </s>
<s> I ended up taking out everything, cleaning out the computer which built up some dust, and replaced everything and still ended up with the bluescreen. </s>
<s> Screenshot of Bluescreen provided below. </s>

<s> https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&as_q=stop+0x50&as_epq=atikmpag+sys I see a few marked &quot;Solved&quot; so see what they did. </s>
<s> At least it's not my first guess. </s>
<s> I hope you see why I could only guess without the details. </s>
<s> There is some thought that since it works for a time it could be heat related. </s>
<s> Did you try it with the cover off and pointing a fan at the open box? </s>
