i have used a d-link604 router for a few years because of the write up in a computer magazine stating it was the best buy because of cost and hardware firewall built in.
with that, i hook a microsoft wireless - so four computers have access to the one cable line.
the computers i used were xp and 98. recently, i purchased a new computer and the microsoft base couldn't be used because it wasn't capatible with the xp mediacenter os.
if you still have your box, check the requirements.
i had no idea there would be a difference between xp and xp mediaplayer for the wireless hookup until the puter gave me that message.
