i have 3 comps hooked up through a switch.
i can't move files larger than 600 megs between computers or i get cyclic redundency, time out, and unable to find file errors.
the same happens if i try to transfer more than about 2 gigs of files at one time.
normal moving works fine.
the problem happens if i try to take or move files from another computer .
i get more data through if i take files though.
2 comps on xp pro and 1 on xp home.
i was wondering what might cause this prob and if i switched to a router it might help.
also, 1 xp pro is sharing the internet connection.
thanks
