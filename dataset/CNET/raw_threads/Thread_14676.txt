XP Professional can. Guess which one I have? XP reads my120g drive that i moved from my old computer to the new one as a foreign drive. A foreign drive? The solution to this problem isn't simple. Here are some solutions I don't want to do. Are there any simplier ones? Buy XP Professional Buy laplink Install Windows 2000 on my system (dual boot) forget about the data on my 120 gig hard drive and convert the dynamic disk to a basic disk (all data will be lost) e-mail myself the files....
