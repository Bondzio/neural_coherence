I am running Windows MCE 2005.Recently I bought a U.S Robotics Wireless MAXg Router + U.S Robotics MAXg PCMCIA card for my pc and laptop. I have a DSL modem. The scenario is. The DSL modem is connected to my PC through USB . I have conneted the USR Wireless Router to my PC through a network cable to my NIC card. Now in the WAN status of the router,I am not able to get any indication of internet although I am conneted to the net via the USB DSL modem. My laptop is connected wireless to the USR router.The USR does have a WAN port but when I connect the LAN cable to this port,I am not able to get the web interface i.e configuring the router information etc...but when I connect the LAN cable to the one of the 4 ports of the USR Router,I am able to get the web interface for the router. Is there something that I am doing wrong or is there some information I need to know.Also I am able to share files and see my laptop on the network.Thanks in advance

In order for the router to function as the server of the Internet connection, it needs to be directly connected to the modem via it's WAN port. If your modems interface is only USB, you should ask your ISP for an ethernet capable modem. Your configuration would then be: DSL modem &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; router &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PC's
