Sadly, I don't offer a course in PC architecture in this small space of a few paragraphs.
While it is possible to give one off answers to specific points, the PC architecture is widely discussed out on the web or in a book for the better book stores.
I'm unsure what you are attempting but there are bottlenecks all over various PCs.
But in spite of that we still use them.
