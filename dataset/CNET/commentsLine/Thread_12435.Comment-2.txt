there is a program than allows you to change settings for maxtor drive acoustics.
searching the maxtor site, i see they no longer offer it for download.
info about it can be found at:  the download link does not work.
you may be able to find it still available with a google search.
if not, contact me through my profile, and i can email it to you, harv.
