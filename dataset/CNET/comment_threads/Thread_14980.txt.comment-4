But just let me add this, all brands have good and bad and most will argue until the sun burns out about which is better.
If emachines has fixed their little power supply issue they had a few years to a couple of years ago, then they are very good running and for a good price.
But even so, don't take my word, read others as well and do what you feel is the best solution for you.
Also , go to the sites and read user reiveiws on computers, or non bias testers that actually put these computers through the ringer.
