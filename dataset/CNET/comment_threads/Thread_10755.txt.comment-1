I have an older proprietary HP P2 mobo standard atx form factor that has no agp, however there are provisions for one on the board.
In other words all the solder points and traces are present with the area outlined to indicate where it would be installed.
I am thinking of installing a slot on this board myself.
The board has an onboard agp, but the bios has no setting to disable it.
What would happen if I did this?
