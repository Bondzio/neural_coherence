and xp has issues with usb.
but i can answer about xp and usb speeds.
in xp (not xp sp1 or later) the usb speed is version 1.0 or low speed.
usb 2.0 speed was not enabled till later.
why are you at xp and not updated?
is there a reason?
also, given no make, model and more of such listed in your post, i can check on things.
--&gt; it is worth noting that web cams are notorious for missing drivers.
it's a common problem to find an owner that has a web cam with no make/model and for them to ask for help getting it to work.
you know to nod and hope they figure it out.
