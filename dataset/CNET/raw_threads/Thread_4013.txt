I'm going to pass out. Imagine the power needed and the heat.

A &quot;Real&quot; Nvidia employee who had the card, said; &quot;Pros: This a very good selection however the poster above obviously does not have this card (I DO)and he is lying about working for NVIDIA because (I DO) it is importaint to know that this card runs in SLI ... on its OWN PCB board NOT 2 CARDS togeather similar to the 3D1 cards by GIGABYTE this card is just not AS limited as those others motherboard wise, what this board does is eliminate the space that hampers two seperate cards by mateing the two on one board wich gives it the advantage of the (to be exact)27,203 score in 3dmark05 the score with a single core enabled is (11,138) you can not run quad cores YET!!!!! and I think that it is wrong that people are lead to believe you can so the review was not written by a owner of this card so if you are a hard core gamer stick with two 7800GTX's or GT's they are the best choice right now for a two card SLI setup Cons: Have to use the drivers it comes with because until an update comes thats all you can use, This card is rather LARGE because of each core has 256mb DDR3 around it,it is double wide it comes out almos... More t to the window to my case (TT XASER3) thats it besides you CANT RUN QUAD CORES YET! IT'S HYPE&quot;
