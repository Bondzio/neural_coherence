<s> My esk top runs on windows vista 64 bit have internet explorer 8 I want to know how can i shut off any programs running in the background and how to find out if there is anything running in background. </s>
<s> For example http://forums.cnet.com/7723-10149_102-308311/how-do-i-disable-unnecessary-programs-running-in-my-pcs-background/ has over 200 answers on this. </s>
<s> I think there's usually little to be gained here. </s>
<s> You are running Vista 64 so the only thing I will offer is that it was a bit of a slug (the OS) and if you had less than 4GB RAM almost nothing you could do would make it respond faster. </s>

<s> you need to gather information from various sources. </s>
<s> The best source, perhaps, is yourself. </s>
<s> When you install software the install/setup process will often ask if you want to &quot;Allow {this software} to load on Startup&quot; or similar option. </s>
<s> Sadly that option is normally already selected and you actually have to 'opt out' by de-selecting it. </s>
<s> If the option was to 'opt in', then even if we don't watch the setup process step by step, we wouldn't have any unwanted software loading at startup. </s>
<s> The other options are; 1] The Start menu &gt; All programs &gt; Startup folder. </s>
<s> Any entries in there means that application will load at startup. </s>
<s> You can delete that shortcut but it would also be advisable to open the application itself and check its options as it maybe set always to load at startup 2] MSCONFIG - Goto Start then type msconfig in the search box and select the first entry in the list. </s>
<s> This opens the &quot;Startup Configuration Editor&quot;. </s>
<s> Head over to the Startup tab and look down the list to see what is set to run at startup. </s>
<s> You can disable those from there. </s>
<s> any entries you are not sure about you cans search for in Google or your favorite search engine. </s>
<s> 3] The Task Manager - Open the Task Manager, (right click the Taskbar, select Task Manager), and in the new window select the Processes tab. </s>
<s> be sure to select the option at the bottom of the window to &quot;Show processes for all users&quot;. </s>
<s> This lists the processes for all the software that is currently running on your computer. </s>
<s> Some may be processes from applications that have loaded at startup and which are not listed in the steps 1 and 2, but to be sure you would have to open the applications that use those processes to double check. </s>
<s> Google will help you identify the list of processes. </s>
