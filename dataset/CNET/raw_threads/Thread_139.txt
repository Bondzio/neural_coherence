Just clean the thing out once in a while. I always recomend to my customers to leave it on especially if they have a constant internet connection. I do this so that they can schedule windows updates to run during off times and also any virus definition updates that need to downloaded. I also have the virus programs to scan during the off times. Essentially I have all the programs that need to be run that we normally dont want to sit and watch run during the night in order to keep the computers up to date and running smoothly. Even the folks that have dialup I recomend they leave it online all night for at least 2 nights a week so it can do these things preferably 3 nights. Dust can be bad but dust can be cleaned relatively easily. Virus's can be worse and can occur much easier than dust does. I also run Norton Sytemworks one night a week too to help keep Windows running well. I also run other programs at night too all to keep my windows running smooth. And I never have to sit and watch any of this it runs while I am sleeping. I always recomend this to all my customers. God Bless!
