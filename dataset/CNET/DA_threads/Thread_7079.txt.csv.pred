1.1.1	Hello , I just recently purchased a pair of Bose 2.1 PC speakers .	St
1.1.2	They are the Bose Companion 3 speakers which were rated very highly in the reviews which I read .	St
1.1.3	While they do deliver excellent sound and decent power for their size , I feel as though they should be a little better based on their price and the reviews which I read .	St
1.1.4	As of now they are connected to a P4 PC which is about 7 years old .	St
1.1.5	The sound card is integrated into the Motherboard , which is an Asus SIS 645 Motherboard .	St
1.1.6	My question is ; if I upgrade my sound card by putting in a good PCI one , will the sound improve on the speakers ?	Ques
1.1.7	Will they deliver my power ?	Ques
1.1.8	In a sense , does the sound card act like an Amp or receiver ?	Ques
1.1.9	Any advice is much appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	Yes it would help , go buy yourself a SOUND BLASTER , there are several variations and they are n't that expensive but that will help .	St
1.2.2	Good luck ! !	St
1.2.3	!	St
1.3.1	OK thanks for the advice .	Polite
1.3.2	I am going to look into upgrading my sound card .	St
1.4.1	Your soundcard is the hardware that 's controlling the flow of audio .	St
1.4.2	The better and faster it is the clearer and stabler the sound will be	St
1.5.1	Hi .	St
1.5.2	While a dedicated sound card can improve drastically , the sound quality , it still only sends out a low level signal .	St
1.5.3	Which will have to go to either self powered speakers , or a separate amp , ( or a/v reciever ) .	St
1.5.4	I installed a Creative sound card , which goes to my a/v rec .	St
1.5.5	then to 6 speakers and a sub .	St
1.5.6	I use the optical output which is virtually noise free .	St
1.5.7	Plus the musical detail is great .	St
1.5.8	Two of my spkrs .	St
1.5.9	are Bose .	St
1.5.10	In short , the card only processes the signal .	St
1.5.11	no amp , no reciever .	Res
