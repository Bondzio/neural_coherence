<s> I just decided &quot;what the heck&quot; and bought the 8800 GTS. </s>
<s> my question is about my processor. </s>
<s> I am confident with my other system specs, so they are not important. </s>
<s> but currently i have an AMD 64 3200+. </s>
<s> Is it stupid of me to spend that much money on an 8800 GTS when i have this processor? </s>
<s> I dont want the card to run slower because of my processing power. </s>
<s> so what should i do? </s>
<s> Spend the money to upgrade to a dual core processor? </s>
<s> or should a game like crysis use the card fully with the processor i have now? </s>
<s> also, if i was to upgrade, what is a recommended processor that wouldnt bottleneck the 8800 GTS? </s>
<s> Any helpful suggestions are welcome.. </s>
<s> you've got a high-end gpu, but a somewhat low-end cpu. </s>
<s> since more new games are going to be multi-threaded, you should get a dual-core. </s>
<s> an x2 4200 has a 200mhz bump over your cpu so it will be a bit faster in single-threaded apps also. </s>
<s> ok, thanks for the help. </s>
<s> x2 4200 or better huh? </s>
<s> should i look at anything over on the intel side? </s>
<s> but do you want to get a new motherboard then? </s>
<s> There are a few 939 dual-core CPUs that you could upgrade to if you want to keep the same motherboard assuming that you have a 939 now as Googling that CPU brought up a 939 model. </s>
<s> If you do go for the Intel side then a Core 2 Duo or better would be my suggestion. </s>
<s> Regards, JB </s>
<s> Look at Intel. </s>
<s> Otherwise, you're better off saving the money and working with what you have. </s>
<s> A processor upgrade isn't a big deal, and even a 4200+ would be able to handle whatever you throw at it. </s>
<s> I know; I use one and have a 7900GT, and I have no problems running games at all. </s>
<s> Except Oblivion, of course...but who doesn't have problems with that? </s>
<s> Anyway, look at the X2 4x00+ line. </s>
<s> You won't be disappointed. </s>
