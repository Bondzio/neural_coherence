<s> Grandson's comp (compaq presario) had recently had hard drive cleaned and we are in process of re-installing hardware...but, the 2 dvd drivers are not found on system and can't find the back-up discs done when comp was purchased (lost in move I guess) How do we find these drivers to install them?????? </s>
<s> Thank you all in advance! </s>
<s> Those drivers are on the Microsoft Windows CD (all versions from 95 to Vista.) </s>
<s> If the CD/DVD drives do not show up in Explorer, it's not due to these drivers but something else. </s>
<s> Tell more and try this article. </s>

<s> Grandson had evidently lost the windows cd and backup cd's when moving, so, do not have that aid ( Grandson's comp IS registered with windows though)....is there any other way to get drivers to download free? </s>
<s> Grandson's Mom is helpless with comp and I am just a touch more able, lol...but not much where this area is concerned! </s>
<s> (Grandson is autistic, and if he knows, he isn't sharing!) </s>
<s> Grandson's comp is a Compaq Preasio with windows xp home edition service pack 2 </s>
