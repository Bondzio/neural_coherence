hello.
before you start posting suggestions, please take the time to read my specs and situation.
most people just start telling me i need a simple kvm switch, but i have already purchased a kvm switch from trendnet (the tk-209) and this isn't what i need.
i work equally between 3 different locations, home, office, and girlfriend's apartment.
i have a monitor, keyboard, and mouse combination at each of the three locations (that's 3 wide screen monitors, 3 keyboards, and 3 mice total).
i also have two different laptops (one mac, one pc), and a desktop at home (for my home business, not work).
the solution would be an item that meets the following criteria: 1. simple button/quick switch option for changing between target computers (like how the kvm has 2 buttons, press 1 and it displays input from pc 1, etc.)
2. when pressing the above button/toggling between pcs i need it to bring the mouse and keyboard input along with it (not all of my monitors are usb, and i don't think the usb inputs communicate via the graphics port - is this correct?).
the problem with the kvm switch is that i have to unplug my mouse and keyboard every time i want to switch computers.
kind regards, seth b. w.
