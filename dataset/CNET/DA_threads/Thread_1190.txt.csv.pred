1.1.1	Hi I'm looking at getting a QX6700 which I want to overclock to about 3.25Ghz.	St
1.1.2	Does anyone know which is the best CPU Cooler for the job as there's a big choice!	St
1.1.3	http://www.quietpc.com/gb-en-gbp/products/intelcooling gives a list of possible options including the Noctua NH-U12F, Thermalright 120 Ultra and Zalman CNPS9700NT but there are also others such as the cheap as chips Arctic Cooling Freezer 7 Pro.	St
1.1.4	Any help would be great!	St
1.1.5	Cheers	Polite
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	I'd prefer not to go to water just due to added expense, however can I just cool the cpu using water?	St
1.3.2	If so what's the best kit to go for and what's the best budget option??	St
1.3.3	?	Ques
1.4.1	about, including CPU-only ready-to-fit but none of them seem to have the reputation of the usual watercooling systems... but clearly they are more effective than air.	St
1.4.2	The Cooler Master Aquagate S1 is such an example and it will work with the QX, but I can't give you any firsthand info as I haven't built a machine around self-contained systems like that.	St
1.4.3	Air-wise have you taken a look at the Thermalright Ultra 120 Extreme?	St
1.4.4	I'm running a Q6600 (non overclocked) with it and I'd say based on the stock temps I'm getting with a fairly low volume of air wafting over it, it's a good base for decent OC's with the QX.	St
1.4.5	The case is just as important as the cooler (if it fits for a start, especially with the larger heatsinks which can interfere with side intakes/fans) if you're going to go with air of course... but that's probably another thread.	St
1.4.6	Personally I kind of tired with all that pre-OCing futzing, which is why I picked up a couple of Dell XPS 710H2C's	St
1.5.1	lol!	St
1.5.2	The 710H2C's is an awesome piece of kit!	St
1.5.3	How come you ended up with 2???	St
1.5.4	If I could afford one of those outright I wouldn't be bothering putting all the pieces together myself!	St
1.5.5	Although I'm enjoying the challenge of course!	St
1.5.6	I'll check out the Cooler Master Aqua, I like the idea of the self-contained system!	Sug
1.6.1	...basically, because I wanted two.	St
1.6.2	The H2C was a compromise actually, especially as it has some corners cut for a supposedly uber-duper system.	St
1.6.3	But it is decent hardware I have to say, and the naysayers don't appreciate how much has to go into a stable overclock to a level that a major manufacturer is willing to support.	St
1.6.4	The other major reason for the compromise is that I'm a Dell corporate customer and I buy enough from them a year to secure good discounts, and this applies to everything they sell me including all the XPS machines I've bought from them.	St
1.6.5	Glad I was of some help, hoping you get some decent OC's.	St
1.7.1	check the results in this article here: http://www.anandtech.com/casecooling/showdoc.aspx?i=3010&p=3 btw, if you haven't purchased the cpu and mobo yet, look into a p35 based mobo.	Sug
1.7.2	they support 1333mhz fsb and will almost automatically OC any 1066mhz core2duo by 25%.	St
1.7.3	so a q6600 ($500) will hit 3ghz with little to no tweaking.	St
1.7.4	that's pretty close to your target but saves you $450.	St
