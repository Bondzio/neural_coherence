a non-performing product can be returned due to... non-performance.
at 600x1200 dpi, on screen will be at most 100 dpi so it will be like looking at it at 72x under a microscope.
be sure to view onscreen at something reasonable.
wish i had your setup to test, but armed with only this discussion, it's defective and needs to be returned.
