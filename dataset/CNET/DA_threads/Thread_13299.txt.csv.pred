1.1.1	It seems there is a very wide difference in opinion between Cnet reviewers and and consumers regarding printers .	St
1.1.2	I 'm looking for a AIO wireless for a new imac and once I access a review the opposite seems to be the case made by actual users which is confusing .	St
1.1.3	Anybody have any suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thanks .	Polite

1.2.1	I do n't have an Apple to compare to or answer questions but when I asked my fellow moderators something similar they gave a nod to the Canon mx870 .	St
1.2.2	It 's been nice and my only quibble is it 's size .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Yes Bob I have a friend in town who uses the 870 with Mac , all he said was WOW it does a great job but it IS large .	St
1.4.1	thanks .	Polite
1.4.2	One thing I forgot to mention was wireless .	St
1.4.3	So any suggestion based on that requirement would be appreciated JJ	Polite
1.5.1	Is the easiest wifi printer I 've ever used .	St
1.5.2	I ca n't speak about the Apple side of the wifi but it 's very nice here .	St
1.5.3	BEWARE of wifi experts that hide the ssid , use MAC filters or try to get by with WEP !	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	It IS wireless and as I stated in a prior post I have a friend in town who uses one WIRELESSLY with a Mac and he told me it works very well .	St
1.7.1	Now that someone else noted the mx870 let me share one more thing .	St
1.7.2	It has an Automatic Document Feeder or ADF .	St
1.7.3	While it is only single sided it has worked very well and worth noting .	St
1.7.4	Be sure to have help to unpack or move the thing around as it is rather big but not bigger than my first PC .	St
1.7.5	Bob	St
