1.1.1	For the past couple of months my Windows ME had been getting slower and slower and freezing up in spite of the fact that I keep Temp files cleaned out, AV & Spybot S&D updated and regularly use other utilities.	St
1.1.2	Yesterday I noticed the Desktop clock began slowing down.	St
1.1.3	I installed a new CMOS battery, checked BIOS settings and restarted.	St
1.1.4	Now the system and programs run faster and more dependable than in the passed year and system resources hold up better.	St
1.1.5	It's a 4 1/2 year old Gateway 800 running the OEM Windows ME.	St
1.1.6	Could the new CMOS battery be the cause of the sudden upgrade in performance?	St
1.1.7	Not complaining, just curious.	St
1.2.1	Short answer: NO Why, that isn't as easy as it seems.	St
1.2.2	The CMOS battery does hold bios info setting and if they started not act accordingly it could cause a problem, but its not suppose to as long as battery life is present even if weak.	St
1.2.3	It should really start to fail, not slow down and usually a slow clock is the result and nothing else, excluding any other reference to &quot;timing&quot;.	St
1.2.4	If the timing is wholly dependant then yes, because the clock cycles take longer and in fact allow the system to slow down, as the system is dependant on those &quot;cycle rates&quot;.	St
1.2.5	Its logic at it worse, working but not at the rated value.	St
1.2.6	good luck -----Willy	Polite
1.3.1	That you cleaned out the dust and dust bunnies when you replaced the battery.	St
1.3.2	Intel CPUs can slow down when they get too hot.	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	The battery is only used when the pc is powered off, if the battery is getting wear some of the setting may changed.	St
1.4.2	When you put in a new battery and checked the bios settings the bios program may have scaned every thing and did a &quot;refresh&quot; of the settings for clock speed memeory speed etc.	St
1.4.3	So now it's back at a perfomrance setting.	St
1.4.4	But with out knowing the pc make and bios type it's haed to tell.	St
1.4.5	John	St
1.5.1	the fan would take care of all the heat problems.	St
1.5.2	I guess not.	St
1.5.3	Guess I need to get off my butt a little more often.	St
1.6.1	the computer usually runs 24/7.	St
1.6.2	Even though the battery was out for a few hours turns out the BIOS settings didn't change at all.	St
1.6.3	But I did have to reset the BIOS jumper to reboot.	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
1.8.1	When you start a post with the words Windows ME then you have already answered your own questions.	St
1.8.2	At least my experience with ME has been a nightmare.	St
1.8.3	I had it for a few months when it first came out then went back to W98.	St
