1.1.1	I 've searched through various posts and other sites for reviews and tips on what tablet to get , but I 'm still lost .	St
1.1.2	I figured by posting here I 'd get a better idea of what I need .	St
1.1.3	Here 's pretty much what I 'm looking for ... .	St
1.1.4	These are the most important requirements : 1 .	St
1.1.5	I am looking for a tablet with no less than 8.9 & quot ; screen .	St
1.1.6	I looked at the google nexus 7 and it seems great , but the screen is too small for what I 'm looking to do .	St
1.1.7	2 .	St
1.1.8	I will be using the tablet for business while on travel , so I 'd like it to be able to open office documents - mostly word , excel , and power point .	St
1.1.9	I do n't care if I have to pay to get an app that will do this .	St
1.1.10	I just need to have the capability .	St
1.1.11	3 .	St
1.1.12	I 'd like decent battery life .	St
1.1.13	I will be traveling a bit and if I 'm taking a flight from coast to coast , I 'd like to be able to watch a full length movie without the battery dying .	St
1.1.14	4 .	St
1.1.15	It needs to have a reliable wi-fi signal .	St
1.1.16	5 .	St
1.1.17	I 'd like to watch movies with good video resolution .	St
1.1.18	6 .	St
1.1.19	The device does n't need to have a lot of storage space , but it does need to have the capability to access services like google drive , or some kind of online file storage .	St
1.1.20	I typically have a lot of smaller files on a USB thumb drive that I carry with me , but I know most tablets do n't have the capability to read them .	St
1.1.21	So , regardless of what tablet I get , I 'm prepared to make the switch to using some sort of online file storage service to access my files .	St
1.1.22	7 .	St
1.1.23	The typing and note-taking needs to be smooth .	St
1.1.24	I currently have a Motorola razr phone and I use evernote and a couple other note taking apps .	St
1.1.25	The typing is very sluggish and it 's pretty annoying .	St
1.1.26	If I 'm going to be using a tablet for typing , I want the response time to be as if I 'm typing on a computer .	St
1.1.27	8 .	St
1.1.28	The tablet should have the option for an external keyboard - whether it 's connected directly or via bluetooth does n't matter to me .	St
1.1.29	9 .	St
1.1.30	I will be browsing the internet with the tablet .	St
1.1.31	I 've heard the ipad does n't support flash , but I 'm not sure how big of a problem that will be for me .	St
1.1.32	I do watch youtube videos and also show video files for business presentations .	St
1.1.33	The videos are mostly .avi , .mpeg , .wmv , .mov , etc .	St
1.1.34	10 .	St
1.1.35	I 'd like to switch my current magazine subscriptions like popular science , forbes , etc so i can view them on the tablet .	St
1.1.36	The tablet needs to have some way of viewing these .	St
1.1.37	11 .	St
1.1.38	I 'd like to store and view photos .	St
1.1.39	- mostly jpg 12 .	St
1.1.40	Processor speed ...	St
1.1.41	Since I will be multitasking , I 'd like seamless transition between opening apps , etc .	St
1.1.42	Somewhat important but not a deal breaker : 1 .	St
1.1.43	It 'd be nice if there was a way to hook up a USB thumb drive or an external hard drive to the device .	St
1.1.44	Whether or not it 's a direct connect or maybe a wireless hard drive it does n't matter to me .	St
1.1.45	2 .	St
1.1.46	It 'd be nice to multi-task .	St
1.1.47	I like how you can view several files at once with the Samsung Galaxy devices .	St
1.1.48	Things that do n't matter 1 .	St
1.1.49	The speakers do n't have to be great .	St
1.1.50	If I 'm going to listen to music with this device , it 'll be with headphones or hooking up some external speakers .	St
1.1.51	So , the sound quality does n't need to be fantastic .	St
1.1.52	In regards to price , I 'm willing to pay somewhere between 400-500 dollars .	St
1.1.53	I keep hearing that the iPad is the best tablet , but I really have no idea if it 's the best for what I need .	St
1.1.54	Since there are countless android tablets , I do n't know enough about them either .	St
1.1.55	Any help would be GREATLY appreciated .	Polite
1.1.56	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	That 's the only known system that hits all your marks .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	While there are loyal Android users , I do n't know any that have also used Apple devices ( it seems once an Apple user , always an Apple user ) .	St
1.3.2	After looking through your list it seems like an iPad is the way to go .	St
1.3.3	IMO if you go with something else you 're either going to disappointed , or you 're not going to be aware of what you 're missing .	St
1.3.4	Make sure you pick up a nice , solid case for your new tablet too .	St
1.3.5	Cheers , Chase	St
1.4.1	When that happens then a big item in their list will be covered .	St
1.4.2	For now the few that demand full Word and Excel compatibility get to look at Windows 7/8/9 Pro tablets .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thanks for the reply .	St
1.5.2	Why do you think the iPad is better in this case ?	Ques
1.5.3	The only apple device I have is an iPod .	St
1.5.4	My phone runs android and I 'm pretty used to the google products .	St
1.5.5	The only thing I dislike about my android phone is it 's inability to keep up with my typing .	St
1.5.6	I purchased an iPad 3 for my dad this weekend and had a chance to look at it .	St
1.5.7	It seems pretty simple and easy to figure out , which is nice .	St
1.5.8	But , I 've read that they ca n't be customized like the android tablets can .	St
1.5.9	The one thing I like about some of the Asus tablets is the ability to dock with an external keyboard which has USB and memory card expansion .	St
1.5.10	That 's kind of a nice feature .	St
1.5.11	Does the iPad have that capability ?	Ques
1.5.12	Thanks	Polite
1.6.1	But it fails some items on your list .	St
1.6.2	It could be you were spec happy and did n't really mean what you wrote but I 'm left to guess .	St
1.6.3	As to the customizing of one tablet over the over , the Windows 8 Pro tablet wins that round .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	Which particular items on the list does n't it meet ?	Ques
1.7.2	I think the windows 8 pro tablet will be outside of my price range .	St
1.7.3	Also , someone at work has the asus tablet with windows RT and has n't had a lot of great things to say about it .	St
1.7.4	The hardware is nice , but they said that windows RT is pretty limited .	St
1.7.5	So , I 'm somewhat skeptical about the windows tablets .	St
1.7.6	Thanks !	St
1.8.1	I have the Asus model and almost all documents open .	St
1.8.2	We have a few that did n't and for that , we 're back to a Windows laptop or tablet .	St
1.8.3	Frankly Windows 8 RT is so restrictive that we ca n't go near that at the office .	St
1.8.4	Lighten up Microsoft and maybe we 'll look at it again .	Sug
1.8.5	Windows 8 RT is nice that you get Office .	St
1.8.6	These tablets are not cheaper than a laptop so I wonder why you are looking at them .	St
1.8.7	What 's the attraction ?	Ques
1.8.8	http : //www.amazon.com/Transformer-TF201-B1-GR-10-1-Inch-Tablet-Amethyst/dp/B0067PLM5E lists out the tablet and dock for just under 1,000 .	St
