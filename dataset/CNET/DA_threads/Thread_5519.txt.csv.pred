1.2.6	If not .	Res
1.2.7	2 ] goto the Device Manager , ( right click your My Computer icon , select Properties , then the hardware tab , then the Device Manager button ) .	St
1.2.8	Expand the Display Adapter tree by clicking on the + sign , highlight the video card , then delete it .	St
1.2.9	Reboot into normal mode and allow Windows to recognize new hardware and look for the drivers .	St
