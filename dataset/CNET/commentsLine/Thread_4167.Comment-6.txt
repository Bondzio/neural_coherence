basically as an example, if you have a l/t with a g antenna and you use an n adapter, it will default to g, so here we go again with compatibility issues.
for gaming a hardwire hook up works (generally) better than a wifi hook up but there can be issues doing that as well, cables, hook ups etc.
it can get tricky to be sure.
