you are probably right as it's been many years since i first started in dp.
at that time 1024 was 1 k but, let's look at my personal drives.
i have one 130 gig drive, it formats to 127 gig.
your calcs would put it at 121.?????
my calc says it's 127 (what it shows) this is a seagate drive.
i have a 120 gig maxtor drive, it formats to 114 gig.
your calcs would put it at 111.?????
my puts it at 117. this is a maxtor drive.
so, neither one comes up with what is actually formatted in reality.
i never have been able to fully understand the difference.
i concede though, things have changed drastically.
