The power supply w/ most boxes i have seen is 420w (sometimes 350w).
I would rather spend the extra 50-80 bucks to go to a 500w from a decent manufacturer.
You are right, though, &quot;price first&quot; is a dangerous mindframe.
Where would you think I could cut my cost a little bit?
I don't need dual DVD/CD drives, media card readers, zip drives, blah blah blah, so thats a start.
But where else can I save money?
