For XP, I found that SP1 was still required and for Windows 2000, over 128GB support of IDE drives needs SP3 or SP4. Both OSes need the registry tweak as well, but the Service Pack that I installed set the key proper. The reply and add new discussion buttons are a tad too close, aren't they? Bob

Yes, they are a little too close arn't they... not to mention having to register to post the reply first, that probably messed it all up from the get-go... I didn't go into the whole SP1 for XP and SP3/4 for 2k because I think the person who was orrigionally asking had stated they were running XP SP1... -Mike
