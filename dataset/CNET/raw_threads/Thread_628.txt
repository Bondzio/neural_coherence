I have: Intel Core2 Duo Processor E4300 (1.8GHz, 800 FSB) 3GB Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM at 667MHz- 4DIMMs nvidia GeForce 7300 LE Intel 965 Express I really need to upgrade the video card. I have a PCI-E slot. My goal on this upgrade is to have the whole computer become obsolete at the same time, in time for my next upgrade. This move should hold me for about another year. Which card would I need to get? give me list...
