1.1.1	I want to add an internal hard drive to my computer and it turns out mine is a & quot ; RAID & quot ; ... I talked to a guy at Best Buy where I originally bought the computer and he told me now ( AFTER I had talked several times to many others who said I COULD do this ) that given the type of computer I have adding another hard drive ( internal anyway ) is impossible I went to the VPR Matrix web site and THEY say you can add up to two more hard drives and they give instructions on how to do this however that one guy seemed so certain it could n't be done I really do n't want to go changing things in my Bios and the Fast Build Utility only to find out it does n't work This is instructions to add the hard drive directly from VPR Matrix themselves ... http : //vprmatrix.com/pdfs/RAID.pdf I need to know if I follow those directions will I be OK ?	Ques
1.1.2	Or would it be better for me to just get an external hard drive after all and forget all this nonsense ?	Ques
1.2.1	Obviously Best Buy do n't employ the best staff .	St
1.2.2	The instructions are explicit for adding a RAID HD , so that will be easy .	St
1.2.3	I do n't know however , if you can add a HD and not have a raid set-up .	St
