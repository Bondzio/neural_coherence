1.1.1	If 1ghz is 1000mhz how come the basic computer I use is five years old and a cpu speed test give s result of 1973.2MHz .	St
1.1.2	( nearly 2GHz ? )	Ques
1.1.3	I am looking to buy a new PC , ( Intel Core2 Duo Processor E6550 ) but speeds only appear to be 2.33 GHz .	St
1.1.4	Thats hardly any faster after all these years .	St
1.1.5	Am I missing something ?	Ques
1.1.6	TIA .	St
1.2.1	Hi , Pure MHz or GHz ( the frequency ) does n't determine the speed of your CPU .	St
1.2.2	A few years ago , the practical limit of the frequency of CPU 's was sort of reached .	St
1.2.3	At higher speeds , it becomes unstable , consumes too much power and effects like the slowness of the electricity signal in the chip ( lightspeed ) start to be a problem .	St
1.2.4	Dual core effectively doubles the speed of your CPU not by having twice the frequency , but by having twice the cores .	St
1.2.5	Also , RAM speed has increased , and RAM speed is the main bottleneck these days , not the speed of the CPU .	St
1.2.6	So basically CPU 's now are more clean and power efficient , and yet much faster at calculating stuff .	St
1.3.1	So the 'speed ' doesnt get much faster , but there are double the amount , so in effect the PC would be twice as fast ?	Ques
1.3.2	So where as i used to only upgrade when it was twice as fast as my existing 200 to 400mhz for example this upgrade would be worth it .	St
1.4.1	If a program only consists out of a single thread and can not be broken into multiple threads , only one core of your CPU can be used and it wo n't enjoy the full potential of the CPU .	St
1.4.2	If you run multiple programs , then each can be ran on a different core and they 'll all run at full speed .	St
1.4.3	If you have one program that is made to be able to work in multiple threads , that program can be ran on all cores at once and will enjoy the full potential of the CPU .	St
1.4.4	This is not matured yet , but more and more software and algorithms are now ready for multithreading , which will result in more speed on those new multicore CPUs .	St
1.4.5	Basically , dual core or quad core is a good deal .	St
1.4.6	Go for it	St
1.5.1	I will now i ( sort of ) understand .	St
1.5.2	Thanks .	Polite
