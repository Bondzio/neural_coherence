i bought a new cheap x-link internal 56k modem.
i put it in the pci slot, i adjusted the volume to the max, then dialed.
but whalla, no sound.
i figured out that the new modem has no speaker compare to my old one.
i just want to know if there are any way to hear the sound of dialing by using my own pc speaker (since the modem don't have speaker, so i think using the pc speaker is possible).
if it's possible kindly tell me how to do it.
i know this is possible because there are some computers that i know that when it dials, the sound comes through the pc speaker itself.
