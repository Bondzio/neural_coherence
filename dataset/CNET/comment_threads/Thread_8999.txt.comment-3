Thanks Steven First I don't intend to change FAT32 to NTFS since this is above my knowledge level.
I don't have that much data other than about 11Gb of music.
I was hoping that a flash drive was bootable since I just had a serious problem with my computer and this seemed like a simple idea that might work.
So people get a USB hard drive (my guess) and do the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard thing (which I've never done) ???
Will the computer boot from that if the original hard disk crashed?
P.S.
original hard disk = 40 Gb - Stephen
