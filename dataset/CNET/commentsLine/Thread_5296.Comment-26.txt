256k graphic integrated is really good for that type of system and it will be okay for a lot of games and most regular uses.
i prefer though, to buy systems with video cards rather than integrated.
most systems with 512mg cards are also reasonably priced.
the 512mb and 1 gig cards are just better for performance in games and you will notice the difference when you compete with other players.
also the power supply needs can be an issue when upgrading a integrated system and the operating systems can be rather troublesome when upgrade to the card from integrated.
i had a really hard time disabling my integrated video when i upgraded to a 256 card and the upgrade eventually killed my power supply.
hp likes 350 watt power supplies and most cards like 500 watts or better.
so be careful to check the watts on a card purchase.
the 220 nvidia cards is your best option with hp because it functions well at 300 watts.
these problems are what i discovered while trying to upgrade my old system.
which led me to buy my current hp system with a 512 card in the system.
i plan to buy the 220 card very soon to boost all my performance stats.
i recommend that u buy a system with a 512mg card and save yourself all the upgrading stuff.
also do not frown on a reconditioned system because u can get one with all those features you want for much less money.
i did!
