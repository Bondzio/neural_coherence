<s> I am going to buy a new pc in a couple of months. </s>
<s> My old pc is just that...old, and I want more speed and capabilities. </s>
<s> I have a 2001 custom built pc with Athlon 850Mhz, 384 Rams with millions of unknown stuff that makes it slow. </s>
<s> I am going to purchase a Dell, however, how do I know WHICH Dell to purchase. </s>
<s> I am a machinist and constantly use CAD-style programs, however, my wife is a type of 'gamer' I can affored to spend $2500, but I want 'top notch' (or as close to it as possible) speed, excellent CAD software capability, and the 'gamer' potential all in one! </s>
<s> Ideas?...Dimension, Inspiron?...help me please. </s>
<s> I would not recommend a Dell because of lack of customer support. </s>
<s> Tech support is based in India. </s>
<s> Don't get me wrong they build good systems. </s>
<s> They are not necessarily best value for the money. </s>
<s> Personally I would shop around. </s>
<s> &quot;The new Dimension XPS Gen4 XPS case is the most expandable Dimension chassis offered. </s>
<s> It supports up to three 400GB hard drives, two PCI Express slots and three 5.25-inch drive bays for the highest levels of scalability with a cooling design that runs quietly&quot;. </s>
<s> Prices currently starting at $1,999 Ships 1/20/2005 Here is a link for the XPS. </s>

<s> I have to agree with rwils51 and say DON'T GET A DELL! </s>
<s> You'll be sorry. </s>
<s> Dell used to be good, & probably had some of the BEST tech support out there. </s>
<s> That was then. </s>
<s> The machines seem to be well built, but I've noticed the quality go down over the years. </s>
<s> We have 3 Dell's, all Dimensions, a 8400, 4400, & 2300. </s>
<s> Like rwils51 says, Dell's tech support is NOW based in India, not that it's what makes them bad, but they lack the knowledge that the old tech support had. </s>
<s> The people in India are book readers & when they can't find your issue, they tell you to &quot;REFORMAT THE HARD DRIVE!&quot; The supervisors are no better either. </s>
<s> Then, you can't understand what they're saying most of the time, and they can't understand you. </s>
<s> Within a month, I was sent a new HD for the 8400, and it took about 10 months for the 4400's HD to go south. </s>
<s> At 1st, the tech support was in Texas I believe, & they were VERY knowledgable people, then it became half & half between the US & India. </s>
<s> The tech's in the US weren't aware of being replaced either. </s>
<s> When I mentioned I talked to some guy in India, the one tech freaked. </s>
<s> I have since become a God when it comes to Reformatting the HD. </s>
<s> Have a local place build you a machine, you'll be much happier. </s>
<s> Oh, then there's the issue of compatibility of extras you might want to install. </s>
<s> I just found that out as I now have a DVD paperweight. </s>
<s> :( </s>
