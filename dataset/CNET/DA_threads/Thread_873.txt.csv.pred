1.1.1	I bought a gateway FPD2275W monitor and am using it with Windows VISTA and NVIDIA 8800 video card .	St
1.1.2	The problem I 'm having is that when I turn on the monitor it takes about 5 minutes to come on to the desktop .	St
1.1.3	It shows a black screen with a faint Gateway word and logo then it will finally come on .	St
1.1.4	I do not have the monitor driver loaded because when I did that the picture was all full of lines even with the VISTA updated monitor driver from gateway .	St
1.1.5	So I went back to the generic monitor driver in VISTA .	St
1.1.6	I have all the power saving options turned off .	St
1.1.7	I do not have the monitor software installed as it has problems with VISTA .	St
1.1.8	It also had the same problem with my other video card .	St
1.1.9	Is there a setting within the monitor itself that would keep it from coming on ?	Ques
1.1.10	I noticed that the same thing happens with the same monitor in the store displays .	St
1.1.11	The salespeople do n't have a clue .	St
1.1.12	Thanks for any and all help .	St
1.2.1	Who would let them keep money for this ?	Ques
1.3.1	Heck , if the store display did n't work , then do n't wait return it !	St
1.3.2	The time in *now* to return it as store policies are far more friendlier within 15days or less .	St
1.3.3	I 'm sure you touched on all the issues that effect the setup , but Nvidia have been a sore issue with Vista .	St
1.3.4	OEM 's are waiting still for such , plus if the monitor is not stated as Vista capable it too can fall through the cracks until a later time its 100 % fixed or accepted in the fold , let them fix it .	St
1.3.5	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	This just happened to me after one week of use .	St
1.4.2	See the forum posting description below for the exact symptom .	St
1.4.3	I had to unplug the power cord as mentioned in another forum answer to & quot ; reset & quot ; the monitor ( the monitor menu 's reset option has no effect ) .	St
1.4.4	This same thing also happened to a personal friend of mine who bought the same FPD2275W monitor around 9 months ago from Circuit City .	St
1.4.5	Just thought you should know .	St
1.4.6	Maybe there is a firmware update from the manufacturer to permanently fix this ?	Ques
1.4.7	The monitor is always plugged in and even when you & quot ; turn it off & quot ; with the button or by Vista & quot ; power plan & quot ; options , the power button is lit purple ( the off color ) so it still has external power applied to it .	St
1.4.8	Just surprised this happened after one week !	St
1.4.9	I did n't install the Vista EzTune software yet because of reported issues with Nvidia 8800 cards .	St
1.4.10	My friend has EzTune installed on his XP system and the same freeze happens so that ca n't be the cause .	St
1.4.11	Its something with the monitor hardware onboard processor itself .	St
1.4.12	Originally Posted by ( another user ) : & quot ; I recently purchased this monitor and it just started doing something that 's bothering me .	St
1.4.13	When the monitor goes into power-saving mode , or I turn it off while the computer is on , it takes a loooong time to turn back on .	St
1.4.14	When I turn it back on the gateway logo pops up on a black screen and just stays there for a minute .	St
1.4.15	Then it shows the desktop but the little blue window that shows it 's connected via DVI is on the screen for another 30 seconds .	St
1.4.16	So it takes a good minute and a half to actually see the desktop .	St
1.4.17	It 's almost like it freezes for a minute and a half .	St
1.4.18	Anybody else have this problem or heard of it and know how to fix it ? & quot ; Answer ( by another user ) : Try unplugging the power then plugging it back in ... this should reset the monitor .	St
1.5.1	my menu buttons dont lite or work anymore .	St
