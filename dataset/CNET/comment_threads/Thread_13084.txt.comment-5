Hi guys I am going to remove the 2-512 mb ram and install a matching set of 2gb ddr2 6400-800.
Confusion over the speed of the 5200 has convinced me to completely remove the existing sticks and install new ram.
Crucial advice and your suggestions have help me decide on which ram to choose.
Thanks for the replies.
