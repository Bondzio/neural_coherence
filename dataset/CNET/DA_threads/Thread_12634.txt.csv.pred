1.1.1	I currently am using comcast.net to network 4 home PCs : 1 desktop pc ( that is connected via ethernet to the router ) 3 laptops ( that are connected via wireless to the router ) Whenever the desktop PC is used to do anything that requires any internet bandwidth ( e.g .	St
1.1.2	download files , etc .	St
1.1.3	) , the other three PCs connection to the Internet slows to a crawl .	St
1.1.4	This does not make sense as comcast *claims* that we have a 6mbit connection and the desktop PC uses only a small portion of that bandwidth - ( between 30kbits to a peak of less than 200kbits ) Is there any way to ensure that the laptops can continue running at & quot ; full speed & quot ; while the desktop PC can do its thing ?	Ques
1.1.5	This has been the source of many arguments with my housemates and I and I know that there has to be a way for all of us to use this connection regardless of what each person is doing .	St
1.1.6	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	in some wireless routers , the wired connection dominates the wireless channels causing the situation you describe .	St
1.2.2	http : //www.tomsnetworking.com/index.html has reviews of many popular routers .	St
1.2.3	to test your connection , go to http : //www.dslreports.com/stest or http : //www.bandwidthplace.com/speedtest/ or http : //reviews.cnet.com/7004-7254_7-0.html these tests wo n't reflect your true upper limit but you should see at least 1mbps .	Sug
1.2.4	the best way to check your true limit is to kick off some newsgroup downloads from comcast 's news servers .	Sug
1.2.5	since those servers are 'local ' , they should be able to fill your pipeline .	St
1.2.6	i use roadrunner any peg my connection at 7.1mbps with 2 simutaneous transfers .	St
1.3.1	I too believe that this is likely a problem related to your router .	St
1.3.2	It would be nice if you were to tell us what brand/model router you own .	St
1.3.3	Some routers have a function that allows you to limit the amount of bandwidth each computer ( or IP address ) on your network .	St
1.3.4	You may also consider upgrading your router as well .	St
1.4.1	It is possible that your software firewall on each of the laptops is limiting your speed .	St
1.4.2	I used Computer Associates Firewall with my RoadRunner and it slowed my speed down to a crawl [ 700 k ] .	St
1.4.3	When I turned off that firewall and used windows firewall my speed was okay [ at least 5mb ] .	St
1.4.4	You could probably do without a software firewall simply because the router has it 's own firewall built-in but I personally use window 's version anyway in addition the the router 's .	St
1.5.1	always check all networking devices for any settings that change the duplex mode ( on most equipment anyways ) which basically limits to how much bandwith can be sent and received at a given time , always make your your equipment has the newest stable drivers and/or firmware for routers/switches since new firmware might create new custom settings or have easier control of your bandwith , also don ; t forget ethernet ( wired portion ) of your network will always exceed wireless since wireless ca n't handle ethernet speeds yet , check firewalls and check wireless coverage since maybe you got a weak signal	St
