i am having some trouble setting up a network for my neightbor.
both computers are running xp.one home one pro.
i ahve gone through the network setup wizard on both of them.
i dont know which configuration to choose so i just picked one.
i think it was the defalut that comes up.
i entered in all of the info and it said it was done and that i ahd to restart.
so i did.
i also did this on the other which connects via 802.11b.
i went to my network places and tried to view the workgroup computers.
each time i received a dialog box that said i couldn't access the network.
it said that a server hadn't been secified.
the internet works fine on both of them by the way.
i have done other posts in the past and i have not provided enough info.
if you need anymore.
please let me know.
