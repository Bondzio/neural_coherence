I use an Asus N66U Black Knight 3x3 stream 450 Mbps router and EA66U 3x3 access point now.
In order to get full advantage of this speed, I need a laptop with three antennas using either an Intel Centrino Wireless-N 6300 or Killer 1103.
The only 3x3 MIMO laptops I can find are MacBook Pro and Alienware M17 and M18.
