I want to have a machine running XP Pro with a shared drive visible on the network, but have no one logged on to that machine. This is will allow the other machines to access the network drive, and to administer the machine I can remote in from one of the other pcs. Is this possible without logging in? Thanks Michael

No. But let's define &quot;logging on.&quot; If you mean &quot;must the Windows GUI be logged in?&quot; That is, the name and password on the HOST be entered where you see the start button then the answer changes to &quot;yes.&quot; But under the hood there is a login occurring when a CLIENT connects and asks for connection to a share. How deep must we go here? Bob

When it boots no one logs on to the pc, but the drive on the PC is shared to the network. The other 3 computers running XP Pro need to access this shared drive. This is in a peer-to-peer network so there is no server involved. I'm trying to do this without having to put a client server environment in this really small office. They don't need the security. I was planning on not hooking a monitor to the pc and remoting in from one of the other PCs to administer the box if necessary. Does this help? Michael

We could use the keyboard to turn it on or WOL and it could be shut down remotely. What we did was pre-define all users needing access including the administrator account and then recreate these same accounts on the PCs that would gain access. The shares were setup and permissions assigned to those who needed access. When done properly, a user could login to a remote PC that already had an account on that &quot;server&quot; device. They could navigate to an authorized share and would not be asked for a username/password. Another way to do this would be to map the shares as needed to remote PCs or create shortcuts on the desktop. In this way, the accessible shares were only visible when logged into these specific accounts. This only seems to work with Windows SMB but not remotely using FTP. Be aware that XP Pro has a ten user login limit.

These devices, however, cannot be used like PCs. They don't run software or third party utilities. The one we got has remote administration capability and can be set up for remote ftp or http access over the web. It also resides in a relay rack.

Since all the machines logon using the same user id then it should be possible to map to the &quot;not logged on&quot; box without a problem. We don't really need a lot of security so the user ID is all the same. I will keep working on this, this gives me some more ideas. Thanks Michael

However from the CLIENT machine there is a log on process so what wipes some beginning networkers is that you must have a log on account on the machine you are logging into as well as on the machine that is sharing. I won't rewrite this. Bob

Why waste an XP license and a good piece of hardware if you just want access to files in shares. A NAS that supports Windows SMB will do that quite well. Remote administration is a minimal chore. You need to turn it on/off, create/delete shares, add/remove users and do backups...not much more. They don't need much in the way of resources and can be quite small.
1538	9	311170	2876521	2876502	Malkavian	10/7/08 5:55 PM	1.2234021E12	I have thought of that.	I have been looking into NAS for this situation as well. I cannot seem to find a reliable, reasonably priced NAS that will suite their needs. I have been reading a lot of reviews on different NAS devices and some people love them and some hate them. Wasting an XP license isn't really a problem. I have extra one at the moment and also have a licensed copy of Windows 2000 that I no longer use. I'm still researching all possibilities and haven't ruled the NAS out yet. I also need the system easy for them to switch to a backup incase the NAS or PC dies. Thanks Michael

While you can't install to a partition over 127GB (just like XP) it handles the big drives once the service pack is added just fine. It boots faster than XP and from memory allows more connections than XP. Bob
