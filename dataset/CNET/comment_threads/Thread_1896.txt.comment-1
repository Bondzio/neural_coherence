I recently bought a new pc (all the computer parts) I needed, so far i have everything connected but the problem is when i turn the power on nothing happens, the monitor acts as if it is not connected to a computer.
the fans and lights are on, but it is not doing anything with the HD, i have tried several different harddrives to see if it will work but attempts were futile, does anyone have a solution for this?
(it is not the video card or monitor) thanks in advanced
