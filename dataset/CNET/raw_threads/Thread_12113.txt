Anbazhagan, Please post again in the Windows XP forum, and tell more than you tell here. - What mail are you using (Outlook Express, hotmail)? - What browser (if there's a browser involved)? - What 'page errors'? - Any more wrong than just a mention of 'error'? Anything you can't do? - What's the full message of Spybot? Kees
