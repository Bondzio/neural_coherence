1.1.1	Will PC2100 ram run on a PC3200 motherboard?	St
1.2.1	My first inclination is to say no, but check your manual or check the Mfg.	St
1.2.2	website for the specification for your mptherboard model number.	St
1.3.1	WHY?	St
1.3.2	Don't cut corners on memory.	St
1.3.3	Memroy and FBS, not CPU, dictates how fast your system is.	St
1.3.4	(don't flame..CPU speed is part of the equation, but I've seen systems w/Slow CPUs' smoke faster CPUs' due to the M/B and memory) See http://www.aceshardware.com/Spades/read.php?article_id=5000186 Old but still prevelant Bill	St
1.4.1	your CPU will not run at its rated speed.	St
1.5.1	i do not think so, it is incompatible, the clock may be differnet.	St
1.5.2	i think ur new bar of ram will be fried to delicious ram fries, yum, i am hungry.	St
1.6.1	set the memory bus to any of the lower memory speeds below the maximum.	St
1.6.2	If he were to leave it set for 400 MHz and plugged in the PC2100 [133/266], yes the system would fail to boot immediately.	St
1.6.3	If he [she?]	St
1.6.4	were to first change the BIOS to the 133/266 memory bus speed, it likely will work fine.	St
1.6.5	Of course, the CPU will not run at its maximum speed.	St
1.6.6	[called underclocking]	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
1.8.1	Yes it is possible, it depends on your MOBO.	St
1.8.2	If you are getting something like a DELL then you might not have this option.	St
1.8.3	In your BIOS you will need to find your memory properties.	St
1.8.4	You need to set it to DDR266 look for memory speed: AUTO or LIMIT or simply DDR400/333/266/200.	St
1.8.5	As an overclocker, this can come in very handy if you know how to use it.	St
1.8.6	GOOD LUCK	St
