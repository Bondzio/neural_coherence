<s> Hi I just bought a Linksys router and I hooked up my PC and I also bought the linksys notebook card to hook up my laptop aswell. </s>
<s> I was just curious as to how safe all these routers are with the frequencies? </s>
<s> Is there any health risks? </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> thanks </s>

<s> Hi Steve, The frequencies used sometimes conflict with wireless telephones. </s>
<s> I helped someone with a VPN issue that turned out to be problems whenever she would use her wireless phone while using her wireless router at the same time! </s>
<s> She ended up having to get a different phone. </s>
<s> Of greater concern might be wireless security. </s>
<s> When you were going through the wireless setup utility that came with your router, did it have you set some encryption services like WAP? </s>
<s> If you want help with setting those up, you could post the model of wireless router you have and we could help. </s>
