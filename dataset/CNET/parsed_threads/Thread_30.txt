<s> I mention this as I felt it was something else...and maybe worth passing it on. </s>
<s> \\\\\\\\ I just had a monitor(CRT) bite the dust. </s>
<s> However, before I did the fix, I went in another direction. </s>
<s> I had thought the video card failed, but it appeared OK. </s>
<s> The monitor itself shown a &quot;green LED&quot; saying it had a signal but no display. </s>
<s> After a few minutes, I got the whiff of a burnt component, which then appeared to be the PSU as I usually suspect. </s>
<s> But, the system was up and running and the smell did suggest that, but it seems the monitor itself had blown. </s>
<s> I swapped it and all is OK. FYI - The Compaq 17in. </s>
<s> monitor was made in 1995, so i got my money's worth. </s>
<s> It was a used monitor and I had it for at least 5yrs. </s>
<s> or slightly more. </s>
<s> Strange to me, the monitor was made in Finland, I never noticed that. </s>

<s> About 6 years old and one day smoke started rolling out of the top air vents, I always wondered if I had not been home if would have caught on fire, something to think about. </s>
<s> One reason many devices, etc. </s>
<s> are placed in &quot;metal boxes&quot; is to help reduce the spread of flames. </s>
<s> You will notice just about all system cases, PSUes, CDs, etc. </s>
<s> are metal or metal lined besides the Faraday effect. </s>
<s> The metal box retards the flames ability, but still is a threat if it really unnoticed or unattended. </s>
<s> FYI - I have seen fires within production lines of some devices during rebuilds(refurbs) during final testing, it happens. </s>
