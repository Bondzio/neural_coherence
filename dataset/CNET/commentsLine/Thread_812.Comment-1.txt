i just replaced the cpu fan on my computer.
i had to take the motherboard out to get to it because the screwdriver kept slipping (athlon xp a462).
i put everything back together exactly how i found it.
then, when i hit the power button my new fan starts spinning and everything sounds good but nothing show up on the monitor (says no signal).
i know the monitor is good because it worked before i took everything apart.
i have already reseated the ram, and cpu, and checked voltage on the cmos battery (3v).
did i kill my motherboard?
thanks, all help appreciated.
