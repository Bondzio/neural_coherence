<s> Recently I purchased an enclosure for a 3.5&quot; 120GB Seagate hard drive which was slave in my desktop. </s>
<s> After installing the hdd in the enclosure, plugging it into my laptop, and turning it on, I could hear the disk spinning, but the light on the enclosure didn't come on and the pc showed no signs of recognition. </s>
<s> I tried all usb ports, turning the hdd on and off, restarting the computer. </s>
<s> The hdd only contains folders of pictures and mp3 files, and both machines use XP home. </s>
<s> Am I missing something, or is something faulty? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help in advance. </s>
<s> You said it was a slave in your desktop. </s>
<s> If the jumpers are still set as such, this could be your problem. </s>
<s> Set the drive to CS (cable select) and try again. </s>
<s> Now, did the PC recognize the enclosure's controller? </s>
<s> It must see this first. </s>
<s> Afterwards the drive should be recognized. </s>
<s> Sometimes, however, it cannot read the drive properly and requires partitioning/formatting using the disk management tool in XP. </s>
<s> I did the same with the same problem. </s>
<s> It resolved when I tried a different usb cable.... the one that came with the unit had serial ability and 2-usb connects. </s>
<s> using a direct run resolved the problem. </s>
<s> I am still having recognition problems, but am now at least detected. </s>
<s> hope it helps </s>
