hey everyone.
here's the deal.
i have a 500gb wd passport essential.
i had formatted it to ntfs right when i got it.
it works fine with my vista laptop.
but i now wish i could use it with more.
i'd like to be able to connect it to my ps3 and 360 to get media off of it, and i use windows and mac both very much on a daily basis, so i think i'd like to convert to fat32, but before i do, i'd like to ask if this is a good idea.
i've heard things that fat32 doesn't accept files more than 4 gigs?
also, if i do go through with this, how would i convert it?
when i go to the format section of explorer, the only options are ntfs and exfat.
thanks a lot.
