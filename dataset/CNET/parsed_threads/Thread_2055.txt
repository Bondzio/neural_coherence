<s> Anyone know if it is possible to run your computer into your stereo similar to a CD player, etc. </s>
<s> I would like to be able to run my computer through it so I could listen to my audio files out of my stereo throughout the house. </s>
<s> Thanks for all the great insight on this board. </s>
<s> Can't remember the name of the cable, has a headphone jack on one end, red and white RCA jacks on the other. </s>
<s> Connect the headphone jack into the speaker out from your PC and the red and white RCA jacks into one of the AUX inputs on your stereo. </s>
<s> You would use the &quot;line out&quot; connection. </s>
<s> As mentioned, you will need one that splits the signal into the two channels. </s>
<s> Radio Shack probably has such. </s>
<s> However, you will have some problems if the cable is of much length. </s>
<s> The longer it needs to run, the more likely it will pick up noise and especially 60 cycle hum. </s>
<s> Impedance match is important so check to be sure your line out and auxillary ports match in this category. </s>
<s> Get high quality (cost more) cables if you go further than 6 to 10 feet. </s>
<s> If your stereo has input in the form of typical audio input (The red and white holes) you can go to radio shack and pick up a cable that has the headphone size plug on one end and the red and white ends on the other. </s>
<s> I think this would be the most basic of all the solutions. </s>
<s> Good of you to repeat what has already been said. </s>
