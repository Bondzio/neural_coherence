i have read thru wat u said but i was also reading the booklet that came with the computer and it basically guides you through this whole thing and it looks pretty easy.
it is also based on windows xp so i think it will work.
i see what you are saying and putting links to but i don't completely understand what you mean because i want everything to be wiped off this computer.
all the drivers and stuff that i need are on the restore disk so it isn't a big deal.
i also have the disks for everything else i have installed so i am not worried there.
anyway, can you just explain to me what you are talking about in the easiest terms possible.
