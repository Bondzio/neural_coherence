<s> I carried the printer to a new location and it stopped printing. </s>
<s> It's not out of toner but just won't print. </s>
<s> Help. </s>
<s> Did you mean to a different computer? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> No, same computer, Brother said try test page while it's not connected to the computer and it printed. </s>
<s> But then when I connect it (ucb) to the computer it doesn't see it. </s>
<s> But hit print and a page comes out blank.Tried different ucb port, reinstalling; any other suggestions? </s>
<s> By reinstalling, I am assuming that you mean that you reloaded the software disk that came with the printer. </s>
<s> Does any other USB device work, say a flash drive? </s>
<s> Does the printer show up in control panel under printers? </s>
<s> There are a few things we need to know. </s>
<s> No, the printer does not show up in printers. </s>
<s> Yes, the usb plug works for other devices, my mp3 player is recognized and usable. </s>
<s> But the printer is not recognized when I plug it in to the usb. </s>
<s> I have removed and reinstalled the software but the program says it can't find the printer. </s>
<s> Maybe my usb printer cable is bad. </s>
<s> Just a guess, I'm not much of a geek. </s>
