7373	0	138600	1558008	NR	tlchen	11/24/05 4:54 AM	1.13280804E12	Unconfirmed problem	I have a custom build computer (P4 1.8) which i had been using for quite a long time, a week ago, i accidentally hit the top of my PC tower and the screen freezes and then suddenly blacks out. After a few hours, it can switch on again but after some time, the same thing happens I thought that it was the mainboard problem, so i bought a new one but it did not work out, so i tested the power supply and it turned out OK, but the problem persists. I think that maybe the black 'thing' between the cpu heatsink/fan and the cpu is causing the problem. I suspect that it maybe a overheating problem. im quite unsure of what is really wrong with my com, can anyone help??

You may have a power deficiency that shows up in freezes or reboots. While you're in the box, eyeball those capacitors. Your symptoms are the same for badcaps &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.badcaps.net/
