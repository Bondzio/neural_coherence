1.1.1	In december I bought a 7310 to replace another HP all in one.	St
1.1.2	Out of the box it should work even without a computer hookup.	St
1.1.3	It prints from the computer perfectly.	St
1.1.4	The fault occours when you try to make a color copy!	St
1.1.5	The color in the copy is 50-60% of the original.	St
1.1.6	This also happens when you scxan a color sheet.	St
1.1.7	I called the company to get a fix and after hours on hold and then led through the manual for trouble shooting to no avail.	St
1.1.8	SO they sent me a new one, three days great service except the new printer did or did not do the same thing!	St
1.1.9	So back to the phone same thing .	St
1.1.10	New printer, refurbished.	St
1.1.11	5 days Same thing So called HP CORP. CASE MANAGER SAYS IT MUST BE HARDWARE GETTING BUMPED New one 3 days same thing 50% color on copy or scan Does anyone have any ideas to help me solve this problem other than sending this back to HP and getting what money back i can.	St
1.1.12	my wife likes the card slots and print choices.	St
1.2.1	Call back and insist on a senior tech.	St
1.2.2	The Case Manager may just be damage control/PR.	St
1.3.1	Copy it at the store and see if the store model does ok or not.	St
1.3.2	Remember that color copiers do not make color accurate copies.	St
1.3.3	I will not embark on the lessons about color copiers, color calibration (look up Pantone Spyders), paper and even why this is so.	St
1.3.4	But expectations of a color accurate copy are usually dashed.	St
