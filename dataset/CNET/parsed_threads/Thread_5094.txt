<s> Got an acer aspire t135 with 80g hard drive which was partitioned 40g/40g. </s>
<s> Had virus problems so decided to wipe the whole system and install my windows home I have. </s>
<s> Have now only got a 40g hard drive though How do I get my other 40g back ? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Get to the drive management console (in XP? </s>
<s> You didn't say) and see if you can activate the second half. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> If you had split the drive after the machine came from the factory, then you may have used the restore CDs. </s>
<s> These won't respect your custom partitioning so I suspect what's on the second half may vanish as you run the drive management console to format that second half. </s>
<s> You didn't reveal the OS or exactly what you did so I'm left to wonder a bit. </s>
