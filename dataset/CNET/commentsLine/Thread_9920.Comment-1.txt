hello, i have a ps/2 optical logitech mouse that works in linux (ubuntu 8.04), but not in windows (xp pro sp2).
it's plugged in when i start the computer, so what's the deal?
i've attempted the following to get it to work: *check device manager: no yellow or red devices *try to use &quot;add hardware&quot; - it found nothing *tried to use &quot;add hardware&quot; manually - no mouse in the selection suggestions on getting the thing to work?
it's slightly annoying when using some programs to not have a mouse.
