it could be a failed hp allinone.
this item will confound, annoy and cause more grief than anyone can imagine but try the usual.
look for any reset button or menu item to reset the allinone to factory settings.
now change the one thing you need changed.
as you are dealing with the phone co, hp co and more &quot;co's&quot; expect to be run in circles where the issue is.
be aware that the costs involved are all yours to pay if it out of warranty.
on top of that it's not hp's mandate or warranty when it comes to phone services or what signals arrive over the telco lines.
i write this so you will be ready for the run around.
the best solution is to get a new unit.
if it works, the old unit has died in some way.
if not then the phone lines or telco is suspect.
good luck, bob
