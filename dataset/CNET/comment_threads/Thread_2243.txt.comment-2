With new inkjet printers under 99 bucks, a refurb is unlikely.
However a factory refurb (HP for example) for 1/2 price may be acceptable if you can accept that 100 dollar printers tend to last 2 years.
-&gt; In the big printer market such as 1,000 buck lasers, factory refurbs are not a bad deal since again you can save 25 to 50 percent and again you must accept you may get a shorter lifespan.
Many will expect as new life and performance so those should never consider a refurb.
