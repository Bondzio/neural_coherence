first off, thats actually a pretty old cpu.
second off, its hard to find a motherboard with an AM2+ socket nowadays since most of the motherboards being manufactured now are all, at least AM3 so i guess my suggestion is to try and find a cpu that's more current thats compatible to a motherboard thats, also, more up to date.
if thats not the case, the you can try looking here: http://www.eio.com/c-287-motherboards.aspx?pagesize=12&amp;expand=459 ive looked at few, but theres not whole lot of AM2+ selections out there.. better move fast on getting the motherboard before it become obsolete.
