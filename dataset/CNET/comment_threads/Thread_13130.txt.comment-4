I have had the same problems with U3 as you.
I found that the U3 versions below 1.4 do not work on vista.
I do alot of work on computers at school and i have had problems running between win 2000, Xp, and Vista.
I really would like to update my U3 software.
if any one finds a site i can do that please inform me at animal0307@yahoo.com Thank You.
