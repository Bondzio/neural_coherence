<s> Hi, My Epson Stylus Color 880 printer has disappeared from my device manager. </s>
<s> I have uninstalled and reinstalled it, but it doesnt print, message says to check cables, but I see it still isnt in the device manager. </s>
<s> Any ideas for a non advanced computer user? </s>
<s> Thanks, Sarah </s>
<s> Your post didn't reveal how it was connected, the OS in use, if motherboard drivers were reinstalled or the BIOS enabled the USB and printer ports. </s>
<s> I'm in the dark too. </s>

<s> Sorry, but what does OS stand for? </s>
<s> I uninstalled in the programme in the control panel, and used a CD rom to reinstall the printer. </s>
<s> I use a parallel interface to plug in the printer. </s>
<s> Is this any clearer? </s>
<s> Thanks, Sarah </s>
<s> Since you noted it is connected to the parallel port, a boot with your DOS diskette and tapping PRINTSCREEN a few times may be a good test to see if it's an OS issue or just a dead cable or printer. </s>
<s> Again, you need to tell if the printer self test works, what lights blink and more. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sorry its Win98SE Is my DOS diskette my startup disk? </s>
<s> How do I self test the printer, dont have much about this in the manual? </s>
<s> Thanks, Sarah </s>
<s> Forget the DOS boot disk. </s>
<s> Just tap F8 about once a second after you power up. </s>
<s> Select the command prompt. </s>
<s> After that stops. </s>
<s> You should have a C: prompt. </s>
<s> Tap printscreen and tell what happens. </s>
<s> If nothing, then you may have a dead printer, printer port or cable. </s>
<s> I'll leave you to read your printer manual for the printer self test. </s>
<s> Tell what happens. </s>
<s> No manual? </s>
<s> Go to epson.com and fetch it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The printer self test doesnt work. </s>
<s> I remember this problem starting when I switched off the computer and the printer hadnt finished switching off. </s>
<s> I tried PRINTSCREEN, printscreen, but the command is invalid. </s>
<s> Should I just type C:\&gt;PRINTSCREEN then enter? </s>
<s> Sorry, I'm not very DOS literate. </s>
<s> My computer is French, so windows is in French, but I guess MS DOS is universal? </s>
<s> Sarah </s>
<s> PRINTSCREEN is a &quot;key&quot; on the keyboard. </s>
<s> But since the printer selftest failed, the issue seems to be clear. </s>
