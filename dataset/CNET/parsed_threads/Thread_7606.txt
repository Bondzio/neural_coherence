<s> Hey, I've got a Dell Inspiron 531 with a Geforce 8600 GT and I would like to upgrade it to a HD 3850. </s>
<s> Will it fit and will it work? </s>
<s> Yes, it will fit but you need a new power supply. </s>
<s> They are standard ATX now (not sure if they were before) so any ATX power supply will do. </s>
<s> Go for one that is at least 400-450 watts with bare minimum 18A on the 12v+ for the video card (if its split up into multiple rails, usually the highest amperage is to the video card) and remember it MUST be PCI-Express and Serial ATA ready. </s>
<s> I highly suggest a supply with 4 SATA connectors but 2 will work fine (unless you have 2 harddrives and/or 2 CD drives), if it is only 2 SATA on a single line, then you will need to flip the harddrive around so it will reach (meaning no more screws holding in the harddrive). </s>
<s> Other than that, I managed to weasel in an 8800GT fairly easily, if you have two harddrives, you will have to temporarily remove the second one (labelled HDD1) and you WILL have to buy a 4 SATA PSU (usually 550 watts or more) </s>
