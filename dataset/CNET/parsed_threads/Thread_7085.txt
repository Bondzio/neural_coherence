<s> The moboard came with CD for drivers for onboard chips, Also have HD Maxtor 200GB SATA/150. </s>
<s> Plan on installing WinXP Pro OS. </s>
<s> Once all hardware is set up, what software do I install and in what order. </s>
<s> Thought I would only install DVD-ROM and floppy at first. </s>
<s> Sound card is on moboard. </s>
<s> Do I need install video card before installing drivers on moboard and HD drivers, and OS??? </s>
<s> Appreciate someone giving a brief outline of steps. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Jim P.S. </s>
<s> Does CNet have site that gives this detailed info step by steP? </s>
<s> is: 1) Update Bios to latest offered by manufacturer 2) Install XP SP2 3) Run the latest drivers for mainboard, LAN, video, sound etc, all taken from the makers website. </s>
<s> 4) Run Windows update 5) Install AV 6) Install programs </s>
<s> installing the mobo in the case, adding one stick of memory, the CPU/HSF, , connect the front panel switches to the mobo, the Power Supply to the mobo, no mouse, no keyboard, no video card. </s>
<s> Power up and hope to hear a lot of beeps complaining that you have no video. </s>
<s> Power down [and turn off the Power Supply from ots rear switch to remove the 5 volt standby power. </s>
<s> Remember to turn it on when you go to power up again]. </s>
<s> If you are successful to this point plug the video card in and connect a monitor. </s>
<s> power up and hope to get the first screen showing BIOS versipon and maybe a splash screen with the mobo mfrs name. </s>
<s> Get this far, power off, connect a keyboard, power up and get into the BIOS and make your settings. </s>
<s> Then add the floppy drive and but a boot floppy in to see if it boots to an A prompt. </s>
<s> Get this far, add ONE item at a time and test. </s>
<s> With XP installing from the CD, might want to put the CD drive in next. </s>
<s> If you can't get past any of these steps there is absolutely no reason to go further. </s>
<s> Find out why it didn't work. </s>
<s> If you are putting the mobo in a case where another mobo had been, make sure that you remove any metal standoffs the DO NOY line up with the mounting holes on the new mobo. </s>
<s> To Michael,& Ray, Thanks for lthe input. </s>

<s> John: Does CNET list details on how to go about building a basic PC; one not intended for games? </s>
<s> I'm interested in such; a PC to be used primarily for email; surfing the web; personal finance and word processing. </s>

<s> Hi Big Steve, Not that I know of, but really when it comes down to it, building a gaming PC and a PC not for gaming is the same. </s>
<s> A gaming PC is what everyone really wants to aspire to as they have all the top ingredients for a quality desktop PC. </s>
<s> If it wasn't for gaming, there wouldn't be much incentive to keep improving the high end efficiency of home computers. </s>
<s> All you have to do is follow the procedures for building a gaming PC to build a PC that is not specific for gaming. </s>
<s> Just reduce the Processor (CPU) speed, the amount of RAM MB, and type of graphics card (Video Card), if the cost is not in your range. </s>
<s> If the cost can be managed, then building a Gaming PC is excellent for a PC to surf the net efficiency, email, personal finance, and word processing. </s>
<s> Actually, unless you have a real interest in building, for your enjoyment the challenge, learning about details in a computer structure, satisfaction in bragging about building your own computer, experts agree that the cost is about the same for building yourself or buying one already built, especially now-a-days with the reasonable prices. </s>
<s> If all you want to do is what you say, then look in your newspaper ads for used computers for about $150-$200. </s>
<s> Still better look at the excellent bargains on the emachine. </s>
<s> Best Buy has one this week for $329.97 with 17&quot; flat screen CRT monitor, and color printer, that is powerful enough (2.66 GHz CPU with Celeron D Processor), 256 MB RAM, 60GB Hard Drive, Integrated Graphics, to handle more than what you require, and it is not considered a gaming machine, but will play many of the non high tech games. </s>
<s> Other sources for how to build...www.google.com...type in &quot;building a computer&quot; or words to that effect. </s>
