i have a 6800gs nvidia graphics card and i wanted to know what the best configuration to use with my vizio 32&quot; hd lcd tv.
i am getting some spots on my tv.
i am using the vga cable because the tv does not have a dvi connection.
i could use a dvi to a hdmi cable.
but i still don't know what setting i should use?
