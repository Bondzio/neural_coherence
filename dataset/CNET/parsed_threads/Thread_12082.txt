<s> I had a GBC shredder that worked okay for a year or so before dying, and these royals I see on ebay are not well reviewed. </s>
<s> I want something that will handle all those credit card offers without having to open them. </s>
<s> --and erase CD's too. </s>
<s> any suggestions? </s>

<s> I happen to visit OfficeMax and Office Depot today and gezzz, I didn't know they had so many &quot;shedders&quot; now. </s>
<s> These aren't the little basic shedders neither that you can place atop a trash can, but come far better in motor and cutter ability. </s>
<s> They offer to cut those plastic and Cds as well provided you pay enough for such a model. </s>
<s> I just looked them over, I wasn't interested but thought to mention it. </s>
<s> The local stores here has at least 7-8 different models to review. </s>
<s> Check them out first hand rather than a catalog or such. </s>
<s> But, I'm sure those with large amp motors(specs) tend to work better(IMHO). </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Whatever you get, make sure its a crosscut shredder. </s>
<s> The ones that just cut into narrow strips are insecure. </s>
<s> Fry's a month or so ago had one on special, a &quot;Tech KO&quot; for $15 and I got it. </s>
<s> Works fine and while I have never tried a CD, it does fine on a credit card. </s>
<s> I am not sure it can take a whole CC offer unopened though as its rated 5 sheets at a time and the envelope plus 1 folded page whould be 5 thicknesses. </s>
<s> I don't bother shredding the whole CC offer, just the one page you return to get the card which is usually the one page with my name/address on it. </s>
<s> The rest goes in my paper recycle box. </s>
