1.1.1	Dell xps 600 Intel Plentium d 930 processor Hard drive wd 250 gb Windows xp home sp2 I want to buy and install a second hard drive for Linux operation system .	St
1.1.2	A search of Western Digital show the following small drive available .	St
1.1.3	wd400jd 40gb serial 150 ata wd800jd 80gb 3.0gb My current hard drive is the 3.0gb same as the 80gb .	St
1.1.4	What is the performance of the 3.0gb as compared to the sata 150 .	St
1.1.5	Dollar wise the 80gb is a couple of dollars more and the extra storage is worth that much .	St
1.1.6	I just do n't understand what the 3.0gb is telling me .	St
1.1.7	Once installed will I be able to format to fats32 using xp disk management .	St
1.1.8	I 've been using ME for a number of years and always formatted with fdisk so this will be new to me .	St
1.1.9	Thanks for all the help in advanced .	St
1.1.10	Ray	St
1.2.1	If I 'm reading your post correctly both of these seem to be SATA drives the 40GB is a SATA 1 with a 1.5GB/s transfer and the 80GB is SATA 2 with a 3.0GB/s tranfer .	St
1.2.2	If you PC has the SATA connection I would suggest going with the 80GB drive since most SATA 2 drives are backwards compatible .	St
1.2.3	As for the drive format NTFS is traditionally more stable then FAT32 .	St
1.3.1	sorry noticed you said you were making it a linux drive , are you planning on making using a swap file dual-boot system ?	Ques
1.3.2	Another option would to be let the linux discs format the drive for you , so it 's a native linux file format .	St
1.3.3	Depending on the Linux you should still be able to setup a Dual Boot system	St
1.4.1	Linux 's installer will prepare the drive for you .	St
1.4.2	To trouble yourself with partitioning and formatting is wasted motion since the FAT32 partition will be unusable for Linux and you 'll battle yourself as you learn more about Linux .	St
1.4.3	You might even post a question why Linux wo n't install .	St
1.4.4	Instead I 'd boot my prospective Linux CD and take it 's offer to install on the blank hard disk .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thanks mcmatter now understand what 1.5gb and 3.0gb relate to in the harddrive spec 's .	St
1.5.2	Thanks Bob will install on 80gb and manually partition to 40gb and swap and the rest free space .	St
1.5.3	Will use ext3 format from Dapper Drake .	St
1.5.4	Thanks again to both of you for the reply Ray	St
