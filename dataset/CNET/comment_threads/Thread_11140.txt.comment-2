One of my computers is also a Pent III bought in 1999, 500MHz, increased RAM to 192MB from 128MB, came with 18GB HD, with a 19&quot; flat screen CRT monitor, total cost then $2474 (any current WinXP $330 PC blows circles around it).
Instead of a swap to a larger drive and all the hassle of trying to transfer stuff to the new drive, or installing a second internal hard drive, what I did several years ago, is buy an external USB 2.0 hard drive, which runs on its own power (a cord to 110V wall plug) that doesn't put a strain on the PC's power supply.
Course, I changed out my power supply previously to a higher watt anyway.
The external one I have is one of the first 40GB (2.0) that Maxtor came out with.
I put a large collection of games on it to keep my internal HD relatively uncluttered.
I plugged the external HD into a separate 110V surge protector that has a on/off switch.
I can then use the PC without turning the external hard drive on.
It is listed as drive 'H' on my PC, and I do occasionally run a defrag on it.
Never had any problems.
