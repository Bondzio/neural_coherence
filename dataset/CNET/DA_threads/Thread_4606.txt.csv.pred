1.2.1	Configure your host and client computers for & quot ; ICS & quot ; http : //www.practicallynetworked.com/sharing/xp_ics/ It should work with any networking setup including bluetooth .	St
1.3.1	Stop now before all your hair is gone and start over with WIFI .	St
1.3.2	Bluetooth at some pokey serial port speeds and 10 to some few more feet range is going to make this nearly impossible to setup .	St
1.3.3	This is much like watching a man standing on the ledge of a 10 story building .	St
1.3.4	& quot ; Do n't do it. & quot ; Bob	Ques
1.4.1	i thought the bluetooth range is 10metres ..but its only 10feet ? ? ? ? ! ! !	Ques
1.4.2	any other ways which i can try ?	Ques
1.4.3	it does connect via the serial port ... but then i cant seem to get internet access on the client PC !	St
1.5.1	And 10 meters is usually only line of sight at 100 or so kilobits per second ( most hardware . )	St
1.5.2	This is truly a bad idea for networking .	Polite
