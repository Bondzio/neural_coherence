i use a toshiba l10 series laptop running on windows xp pro.
it has three usb ports (one at the back and two on the side).
i usually use the one at the back to connect a mouse while one of the ones on the side is usually use to connect to a printer.
the second on the side is usually for connecting my flashdrive.
one morning about 3 weeks ago, all three ports stopped working; they recognise any usb device connected to the ports.
we have tried uninstalling and re-installing the drivers.
this has not restored the ports.
it has been suggested to re-install the operating system but this could not be carried out because the optical drive had seized functioning and have depended on an external usb dvd rw.
any suggestions how to overcome this predicament?
thanks oladele afolabi ile-ife, nigeria
