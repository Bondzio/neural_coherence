well you won't be the only one, that is exactly the one my daughter bought at compusa in late august.
she went for all the bells and whistles and so far has been very pleased with the performance.
i doubt she will ever &quot;review&quot; it as being a full time 6th grade teacher, she doesn't spend much time doing that type of thing.
i won't review it as i don't spend enough time on it to do a proper job of reviewing it and that wouldn't be fair to the people reading the review looking for an opinion.
i will say this - out of the seven computers in the house, it is by far the fastest one of the bunch.
it smokes thru spyware and anti-virus checks (that i do for her every month).
other than that i would prefer not to comment further.
again, good luck with your search.
