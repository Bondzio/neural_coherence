1.1.1	I am looking at buying a tablet for my 8 year old and 4 yr old to play games and possibly watch a movie on .	St
1.1.2	I would like to keep them under $ 100 .	St
1.1.3	What are the best ones for the money ?	Ques
1.2.1	http : //store.archos.com/archos-internet-tablet-p-5002.html Somehow , it looks like a phone to me .	St
1.2.2	But you ca n't phone with it .	St
1.2.3	And you 'll have to find the games in the Android market .	St
1.2.4	Kees	St
1.3.1	And geeks.com you see sub 99 buck 7 inch tablets .	St
1.3.2	Be sure to ask if the games run on such things .	St
1.3.3	I 'd think about the Kindle Fire if it must be for games and movies without a need to futz with it .	St
1.3.4	Bob	St
1.4.1	Remember that axiom ! .	St
1.4.2	I 've seen plenty of & quot ; cheap & quot ; tablets advertised in drugstore circulars and if you look at reviews by people who bought them , they 'd be dead upon getting , or within 6 months .	St
1.4.3	Save your pennies and get a name brand product with trusted support .	St
1.4.4	Apple iPod Touch or Amazon Fire for $ 200 are best choices now .	St
1.5.1	I would also recommend the Amazon Kindle Fire at $ 199.99 .	St
1.5.2	I have several tablets myself and also purchased the Kindle Fire .	St
1.5.3	I bought the Fire for my 4 year old niece to use .	St
1.5.4	There are many cheaper tablets available , however , I think a lot of them have more resistive type screens , which means one has to really press harder on the screen , which makes things more difficult for kids .	St
1.5.5	They also tend to have much slower processors , are slow to respond , and many do n't have access to the entire Android App store .	St
1.5.6	Kindle Fire does n't have the Android App store either , but Amazon has their own App store with tons of apps and many apps for kids .	St
1.5.7	There is also a way to install the Android App store on the Fire .	St
1.5.8	In the past I had a NextBook , and there was n't a good app selection .	St
1.5.9	I also have the HP TouchPad which I got when they had their fire sale .	St
1.5.10	First I thought it would have been great for my niece , but their selection of Apps is quite low .	St
1.5.11	There are n't many kids apps and I have found what there is , either does n't work at all , or they are junk .	St
1.5.12	I think the iPad probably has the most available apps for kids and I 've seen many great kids apps that arent ' available for Android , but Android certainly is catching up , but the iPad is quite expensive .	St
1.5.13	I have already found at least 10 games , some of them educational for my niece that she absolutely loves on the Kindle Fire .	St
1.5.14	It 's a 7 & quot ; tablet , so it 's easier for her to hold than a 10 & quot ; tablet .	St
1.5.15	One thing I 've been reading about lately , though , is that since Amazon has it 's store attached , it 's VERY VERY easy to make purchases on it .	St
1.5.16	As of right now , I do n't think there 's a way to block it .	St
1.5.17	So a child could easily buy apps and other things with just one click .	St
1.5.18	I 'm not worried about this with my niece just yet , but I will be checking to see if I can turn off their 1-click purchasing .	St
1.5.19	Other than this , I think the Fire is a great option .	St
1.5.20	I think the Barnes & amp ; Nobles Nook tablet is another great option .	St
1.5.21	I do n't have one , and I 'm not sure how large their app selection is .	St
1.5.22	Both the Kindle Fire and Nook have tons of children 's books availble , many of which a child can interact with , which is pretty neat for them .	St
1.5.23	I think Acer might make a 7 & quot ; tablet for around $ 200 as well , and that would have the entire Android App store available on it .	St
