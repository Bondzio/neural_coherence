1.1.1	I was at Best Buy today looking for a new monitor and found the Samsung 215TW .	St
1.1.2	As far as I can tell , this is a new product that should not be on the shelves yet .	St
1.1.3	It is not yet on the US Samsung website ( although it is on the Canadian site ) and I have found only one site that has this as a pre-order .	St
1.1.4	Anyway , the price was good so I bought it and I was wondering if anyone knows anything about this product .	St
1.2.1	I need at least two of them for a dual moniter setup .	St
1.3.1	Still have n't installed it , but it looked prety good at bestbuy ... Have you installed yours already ?	Ques
1.3.2	How does it look ?	Ques
1.4.1	As you can see in the previous message , I just bought this Samsung 215TW at Bestbuy for $ 545 plus taxes and since I did n't see any reviews on this and bought it on the blind , I 'm going to share my thoughts and impressions on this unit for your benefit as I think it might help you buy your LCD .	St
1.4.2	My first impression was , & quot ; pretty solid display & quot ; .	St
1.4.3	It did not come with any dead pixels or back light bleeding .	St
1.4.4	I have n't calibrated it yet , but from what I can see it wo n't require any major adjustments .	St
1.4.5	The screen displays crisp , well defined images .	St
1.4.6	Max resolution is 1680x1050 .	St
1.4.7	Text is very readable as my wife pointed out since she does a lot of word , typing , etc .	St
1.4.8	You can fit two word , or windows in it without a problem and it 's very readable .	St
1.4.9	As I 'm typing I 'm standing about 3 to 4 feet behind it and it 's as good as it can get .	St
1.4.10	Its base holds the monitor securely and it does n't vibrate as you adjust it .	St
1.4.11	Its height is decently adjustable , it tilts front and back , and it also rotates to the vertical , and I mean vertical , unlike some gateway reviews i 've seen .	St
1.4.12	All the menu buttons are on the front of the display , all its inputs/outputs are on the back and side for the extra audio/video/composite .	St
1.4.13	It does n't come with any USB ports if you 're looking for that feature .	St
1.4.14	It does come with the DVI cable , although it 's not gold tipped , and the VGA one .	St
1.4.15	It also comes with a cd that contains drivers , rotation software which works perfectly , and a color/mode tool .	St
1.4.16	It also has built in speakers that are decent for very basic ops .	St
1.4.17	If you want something decent get it separately .	St
1.4.18	What else .	St
1.4.19	Set up was easy and I ' going to paste information that came with the cd for specs on the unit and I hope this helped you decide .	St

1.5.1	Any idea why I ca n't get the volume to work on the 215TW ?	Ques
1.5.2	Do I need a cable ?	Ques
1.5.3	I am using the analog cable and the picture is terrific but I have no sound .	St
1.5.4	I 've done all system checks so I have to imagine it 's the monitor .	St
1.5.5	Any input would be appreciated !	St
1.6.1	if you look underneath your monitor , right by the dvi cable input there 's an input for sound and that 's where you need to hook the sound cable in .	St
1.7.1	So far this monitor has been great except for one problem .	St
1.7.2	The 1680x1050 resolution is only working in analog mode .	St
1.7.3	I can not get it to work in digital mode .	St
1.7.4	Instead it downgrades to 1280x1024 resolution and clips the output .	St
1.7.5	I can still get to the clipped areas by panning the screen by moving the mouse to the edge of the screen .	St
1.7.6	Is this expected or should I exchange the monitor ?	Ques
1.7.7	I was planning on going back to the store and have them test this on another monitor and see if the blame is on my old video card .	St
1.8.1	I am sometimes amazed by how technically inept I am - how embarrassing .	St
1.8.2	Thanks for your help !	St
1.9.1	I had exactly the same problem with an old video card .	St
1.9.2	It seems that some early DVI video cards ca n't support 1680 by 1050 over the DVI port , but will do so over the VGA port .	St
1.9.3	I upgraded my video card and now have it working at 1680 by 1050 in DVI mode .	St
1.10.1	I also got this monitor , and one of the reasons I went for it over the similar LG monitor is that the Samsung has the 3 video inputs .	St
1.10.2	If you are looking for an HDTV , you should get an HDTV and not a computer monitor , but having the video inputs seemed useful to me .	St
1.10.3	If you are looking at this monitor for its video inputs , you should be aware that the component video will only go up to a 480p signal .	St
1.10.4	A & quot ; film mode & quot ; is available for interlaced video as well .	St
1.10.5	The DVI port is HDCP compliant , so it looks like you might be able feed a HDTV signal to this monitor that way , BUT I ca n't find anywhere in the docs what HDTV resolution might be supported , if any .	St
1.10.6	I 'd guess 720p , but I do not have anything that makes a HDTV signal to test this with .	St
1.10.7	Anyway , I got this as a computer monitor and am very happy with it .	St
1.11.1	That was my suspicion since the specs specifically state it supports that resolution on both vga and dvi .	St
1.12.1	I too , bought this screen as soon as it got out even before Samsung advertised it .	St
1.12.2	Funny thing is , I was calling them ( Samsung product support ) from Bestbuy to learn more because no one knew about it , and strangely enough , even Samsung reps could n't tell me anything .	St
1.12.3	I had also the Gateway FPD2185W , and let me tell you , it is crap compared to this Samsung ! !	St
1.12.4	CNET 's reviewers gave it close to 8 points , I thought it was exaggerated .	St
1.12.5	This Samsung supports High Definition input through its component with resolutions of 480p 720p and 1080i .	St
1.12.6	Very crisp and vivid picture .	St
1.12.7	I compared the gateway side by side , and the Samsung takes the Gateway out easily .	St
1.12.8	I have tried it with the xBOX 360 and boy I tell you it is wonderful .	St
1.12.9	Its 8ms refresh rate and 1000:1 contrast give you a superb quality .	St
1.12.10	Really , if you are looking to spend nearly $ 600 , this is your monitor .	St
1.12.11	It gives you 3 years ( ! )	St
1.12.12	of warranty compared to lousy 1 year with Gateway .	St
1.12.13	Oh yes also their sales and support suck and shameful .	St
1.12.14	Go for the Samsung !	St
1.12.15	!	St
1.13.1	I have a review of this monitor in the following thread at the Anandtech forum : http : //forums.anandtech.com/messageview.aspx ? catid=31 & threadid=1852519 & frmKeyword= & STARTPAGE=1 & FTVAR_FORUMVIEWTMP=Linear Here 's my PBase images of various monitor tests : http : //www.pbase.com/breezycool/samsung_215tw_test_photos & page=1	St
