1.2.1	Most mtrbds .	St
1.2.2	have LPT and COM ports build-in .	St
1.2.3	Under the bios area , upon boot-up get into the area .	St
1.2.4	Once there check to see if the LPT port is enabled or active and what the IRQ is , usually IRQ7 .	St
1.2.5	If it is enabled and still no action at the LPT port , then more than likely the LPT port has bit the dust , kaput .	St
1.2.6	To continue using the LPT driven printer , go back into the bios and disable the LPT port .	St
1.2.7	Get your hands on LPT based I/O card , either solo or dual , it may have extra COM port ( s ) too , just be sure to have only the LPT1 active following whatever instructions they give , install it and follow prompts .	St
1.2.8	You can later swap printer cable to new LPT port .	St
1.2.9	Remove or disable any old LPT ports you had before doing the new LPT card install .	St
