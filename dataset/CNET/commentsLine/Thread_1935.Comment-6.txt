i can only guess what would happen if i did more than that.
i'm a bit old school in i don't fix it what's not broke.
i don't install an audio driver if my wifi is not working.
-&gt; there's a lot more to cover here.
for example, some netgear routers do have connect issues.
now some folk can't read beyond the page but here it is.
here's the beyond the page if you don't extend it yourself.
my samsung and my kindle fire hd 7 were having trouble too so i checked into this and found some advice about rolling back a version in the router.
that helped immensely.
-&gt; also, i think it's proper to have connection issues under the scenario you painted above where you had the ethernet plugged in and then disconnected it and tried for wifi without a reboot.
there are some that think it should work but again, you are relying on some thousand programmers which are like links in a chain to get it right.
i would not have expected that scenario to work.
hope this helps, bob
