<s> Hey all, I recently got a good deal on 4GB (2 modules) of Corsair ram which runs at a timing of 5-5-5-18 I believe. </s>
<s> The current memory in my PC is Crucial Ballistix, 4GB (4x1GB sticks) and runs at 7-7-7-24. </s>
<s> From what I've heard, I could run the two sticks of Corsair with two extra sticks of Crucial as long as I underclocked the faster memory to match the Crucial... but my real questions is, is this worth it? </s>
<s> Or would 4GB of the lower timing memory perform better than an underclocked 6gb? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> For sticks on the same memory bus, the speed is set to the lowest speed stick. </s>
<s> HOWEVER I've seen people fret endlessly about this. </s>
<s> Then we run some benchmarks and only there do we see the 0.1% difference. </s>

<s> So... are you saying it would be best to run the 4gb of faster ram, rather than 6gb of slower? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> On my kid's machine with just 2GB it runs games superbly. </s>
<s> Why going more than this is mostly a discussion about consumers being oversold. </s>
<s> Take the faster 4GB. </s>
