<s> I built my computer two years ago, and it's a great machine. </s>
<s> The whole thing runs like a dream. </s>
<s> The video card I have installed is an ATI Radeon X1600/1650 . </s>
<s> Recently, I moved and I now have my PC connected to two monitors: my usual monitor, an LG, on which the graphics are fantastic; and I am also now using a 32 inch widescreen Insignia TV monitor as well. </s>
<s> I've been using the same video card for the past two years, but when I connected it to the TV monitor, the resolution was awful. </s>
<s> Text is fuzzy to the point of being unreadable, and the graphics for my usual PC games is really, really sub-par. </s>
<s> It is so bad that it hardly makes sense to use the TV monitor. </s>
<s> I tried updating the drivers, but to no avail. </s>
<s> I read here and there that there was no driver for my card that would fix the resolution problem. </s>
<s> Thus, I'm in the market for a new video card. </s>
<s> It's about that time, anyway. </s>
<s> My question is, what should I be looking for in a video card in the market now to make sure it will fix the resolution problem? </s>
<s> I've read that a lot of video cards now are capable of widescreen resolutions specifically for using TVs as computer monitors, but I don't know what I should be looking for in the specs. </s>
<s> Can someone give me some advice? </s>
<s> Or tell me that I'm an idiot and there's an easy fix for my current video card's woes? </s>
<s> Thanks all! </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Why not check with ATI about my resolution problem? </s>
<s> As in, e-mail them? </s>
<s> Like I said, I've tried installing new and old drivers, and nothing has fixed it. </s>
<s> But sure--I'll e-mail ATI. </s>
<s> Thanks for the tip. </s>
<s> Still looking for input, however. </s>
<s> maybe it's the problem not the video card. </s>
<s> Have you used it before and had a good picture? </s>
<s> As a television, the picture was great. </s>
<s> And pictures--such as desktop backgrounds--show up pretty well. </s>
<s> It's just text and gaming that are awful. </s>
<s> My boyfriend kept telling me that the resolution was something like 1300 x 700, but I just checked it and it's 1024 x 768 right now. </s>
<s> Another strange thing about the resolution is that if you go any higher than 1024 x 768, the desktop doesn't adjust to fit the screen. </s>
<s> Instead, you would have to move the mouse toward one of the edges of the screen and it will scroll to show you the whole image. </s>
