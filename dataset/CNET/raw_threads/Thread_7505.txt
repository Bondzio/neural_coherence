13887	0	536806	5180815	NR	PeteDS	8/5/11 1:15 AM	1.3125069E12	Ram slot suspected not fuctional	Yesterday I changed my computer case ever since my computer has randomly been giving me 3 beeps (base read/write error) the first time I just wobbled the ram, it worked. then a couple of hours later windows randomly shutdown on it's own, when it rebooted the POST stalled on dram initial b.1. so after messing around I found if I removed the ram sticks from a particular slot the computer would boot. Slot 1, but I decided to keep at it and try to get it to work. now slot 1 is oporational, but slot 2 has decided to copy it's brother and stop working no matter what ram stick I put into it, it will just stall on POST with the status dram initial b.1 also the ram in slot 1 is not being detected Steps taken to attempt to resolve this Taken all ram sticks out when slot 2 was playing up Put all sticks back in slot 2 worked again, slot 3 stops working Cannot use slot 2 at the moment Flashed the BIOS multiple times with the latest BIOS release from my motherboard manufacturer Took the CMOS battery out and cleared CMOS. All steps have proved inconclusive. any suggestions what is wrong with my computer?
