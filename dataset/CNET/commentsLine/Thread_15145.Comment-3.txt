zonealarm will take some resources on your pc.
is this a noticeable effect?
probably not but that's, jmo.
a router/firewall combo can be better but it is important to remember to configure it properly.
yes, additional systems would benefit from the router-based firewall.
at the same time, it may still be worth having a firewall on each pc.
the only cavaet i would note with a router-based firewall is that if you set it up fairly tightly, you may be surprised at how many holes it'll have to allow for various programs to run, e.g.
ims and other software can use special ports that you'd have to open if your firewall configuration is really tight while others can have them be pretty loose.
last but not least, a router-based firewall may not have all the logging features that a software firewall has in terms of logging intrusions so that you can see who was pinging you or whatever it was that hit your router.
