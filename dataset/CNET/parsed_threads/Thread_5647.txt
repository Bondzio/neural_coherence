<s> I purchased 4 Dell Optiplex 960 desktops. </s>
<s> All are identical duo core 3.33 processors with 4 gig of RAM. </s>
<s> None of these computers will play a Youtube video without stuttering at random points in the video. </s>
<s> I have a 100 Meg DSL line and the download line in the video literally runs away from the play marker so buffering is not an issue. </s>
<s> In fact if you replay the video after it's completely downloaded the stuttering is still evident. </s>
<s> The performance monitor graph under Task MGR shows no spiking during the stuttering delay. </s>
<s> The Networking monitor graph is just as clean. </s>
<s> If I go to Administrative Tools-Performance and watch the graph as a video plays,the graph bar stops as the stuttering occurs. </s>
<s> I've reformatted the hard drive, I've upgraded the bios to version A03 (yes these computers are less than a month old) I've read multiple posts from only Optiplex 755 and Optiplex 960 owners in the Adobe Flash forum: http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FP-1506?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:all-tabpanel I'm usually good at this as run a shop with over 50 Dell's but this one has me stumped </s>
<s> The onboard video driver was &quot;not so good&quot; and no sign of a new version. </s>
<s> I popped some 20 buck video card in and all is well. </s>

<s> This this out to see if the stutter will go away. </s>
<s> Reboot the system and enter system setup by pressing F2 at the Dell boot screen. </s>
<s> Expand the Performance section on the left, then select the &quot;C State Control.&quot; Uncheck the &quot;C states control&quot; box, save the changes and reboot the system. </s>
<s> Good work timdell ! </s>
<s> Unchecking C staes in the bios has solved the problem for me. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot ! </s>
