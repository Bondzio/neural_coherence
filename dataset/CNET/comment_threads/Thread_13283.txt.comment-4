In your 1st post, you didn't mentione you &quot;refilled&quot; the old cart.
Now, that's your problem.
HP keeps track of ink carts, but using a different ink cart even if refilled but NOT used by your system will be accepted.
HP tracks upto 3 inkcarts, thus you need 4inkcarts to reset the last value from re-occuring.
Saving X-money isn't worth it if the prtr.
doesn't work.
You need to access other inkcart(s) to continue usage.
Google for further details but that covers it.
