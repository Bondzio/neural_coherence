Try unscrewing the power supply from the case (if you haven't already), and search the areas &quot;hidden&quot; due to the case.
Honestly, given the age of your mainboard and graphics card, you're probably ready for a new power supply.
Use Newegg, or you're favorite retailer, and find something with at least 450W.
Good brands include PC Power & Cooling, OCZ, Antec, and a few others.
Newegg.com's (no, I don't work for them, they just happen to be the best, in my opinion) customer reviews happen to be very reliable.
When purchasing hardware, I often pay close attention to what others are saying about products I'm interested in.
You may find the reviews to be helpful.
Happy Hunting!
