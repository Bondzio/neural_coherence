hi again, i know im really horrible with thinking of everything to put in my message.. anyway, here are some points i was considering: - i intend to carry the tablet to college every day, so an intuos5 small would be more portable than a medium bamboo create.
- the intuos5 small has about the same ratio for corner-to-corner sweeping as my mouse - having a small intuos5 will help me determine if i want to go for a medium or a large later on - the bamboo create has much less pressure levels, less nibs, less buttons, but a much lower price than the intuos5 small right now, i just need to know if a i should get a medium bamboo create, or a small intuos5.
thanks, - hellz
