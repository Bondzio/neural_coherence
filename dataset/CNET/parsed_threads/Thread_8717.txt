<s> Hi, Trying to print a stack of &quot;no. </s>
<s> 6 3/4&quot; envelopes with my business return address. </s>
<s> It works great feeding them one at a time through the MP tray, but when I put a stack in the regulat tray, 75% come out printed crooked. </s>
<s> I have the side guides snugged down. </s>
<s> The nice guy at Canon hemmed and hawed and basically said my machine may have a problem, then said that model wasn't really designed for that...what the? </s>
<s> Anyone have luck printing more than one envelope at a time on a Canon multi functon laser D480? </s>
<s> The rollers get a little slick so here's the deal. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> New? </s>
<s> Call it in, get it fixed. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Old? </s>
<s> Call it in, get a quote. </s>

<s> That's right. </s>
<s> Still would like to know the machine's age. </s>
<s> Sorry I didn't mention it. </s>
<s> Seems like it should be able to handle something like this longer than that, especially since the MP slot works just fine. </s>
<s> I had one fellow raving about a 2 degree slant. </s>
<s> At 6 months it's in warranty. </s>
<s> If the product says it prints on envelopes and if you are giving a few degrees of latitude then call it defective and stand your ground. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
