<s> I can't figure this one out. </s>
<s> I have a Linksys WRT55AG router networking three computers via wireless. </s>
<s> I had absoutely no problem setting up WEP on two of the machines (1. </s>
<s> Laptop with built in adapter and Win 2000, 2. </s>
<s> PC with WMP54G and XP SP2), but after woriking it for a week I still can't get my third machine (PC with WMP55AG and XP SP2) to connect when WEP is active. </s>
<s> Signal is not an issue, the PC is within 15 feet of the router. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> This is not uncommon if the makes are dissimilar or the firmware drivers are not the latest. </s>

<s> Thanks for your response. </s>
<s> All components are Linksys and I have confirmed that all drivers and firmware are the latest per their website. </s>
<s> Any other ideas? </s>
<s> Two ideas. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> WMP54G and XP SP2, and the PC with WMP55AG. </s>
<s> You may have found where some model isn't playing WEP. </s>
<s> A call to Linksys may reveal the issue. </s>
<s> I have not looked at the linksys web site since that's your job. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I ran into one glitch on a friends network. </s>
<s> They had the number of clients set too low. </s>
<s> They had 5 machines and set the WAP/Router to 5 DHCP clients. </s>
<s> Doubling that fixed it. </s>
<s> I did not investigate why this is so. </s>
<s> I leave it to others to ponder such things. </s>
