of an anti-static pad.
the pad has a resistor approx one megohm or greater.
to ground.
the pads function is to lessen the current flow that takes place during the discharge.
[in effect, it spreads it out over time [tens of nanoseconds].
now consider that a properly assembled and grounded system has a very low resistance to the ground bus in your main electric box [a couple of ohms].
in this case you have the megohms of the static pad in parallel with less than an ohm.
the discharge will be high current through the low resistance path.
the purpose of the pad is that one should touch it first [and often, since simply moving stocking feet or leather soles, petting a cat et al can build up the charge rapidly].
by touching the pad, the discharge is so miniscule/unnoticeablethat you will have no idea that your body had a static charge.
