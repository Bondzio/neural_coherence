&quot;tip: if you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; my immediate answer is &quot;its broken.&quot; which may sound short, but so is your supplied information at the moment.
tell a long story of what is in the machine or make/model/age!, what transpired (i put in a new felt-tip timer) and think over if there is a warranty in which you can make it their problem.
