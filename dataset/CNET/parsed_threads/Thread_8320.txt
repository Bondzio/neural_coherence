<s> Hello, My laser for my DVD Drive has burned out, it is unable to read DVDs. </s>
<s> Anyways, I recently looked online for possible solutions and found out I can transfer a DVD Drive from one of my old computers into the burned out one. </s>
<s> So I thought of my TOSHIBA Laptop. </s>
<s> Then I started to think if it wouldnt work since laptops are compressed hardware and you cant upgrade them etc. </s>
<s> So my question is; is it possible to extract my DVD Drive from my TOSHIBA Laptop and place in my Desktop Computer (Windows XP Professional Edition) If so please explain the steps. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> You would use a laptop to desktop adapter. </s>
<s> However this will cost about the same price as a DVDRW drive so must you do this? </s>

<s> Thanks for the reply, I don't see a point in purchasing a whole new adapter, when I can just go to the shop nearby. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot </s>
<s> To avoid buying them new. </s>
<s> That's why I suggest you pick up a 30 buck DVDRW from geeks.com or newegg.com since the adapter should run about that or more. </s>
