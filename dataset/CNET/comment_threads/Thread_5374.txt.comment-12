I haven't worked with a Pentium D yet, but your discussion has me interested.
I checked the customer reviews for the six Pentuim D processors currently offered at NewEgg.com.
They seem to get CPU idle temps in the mid-40*C renge with heatpipe heatsink models.
A few customers seemed to have success with the COOLER MASTER Hyper 6+, among other heatpipe models.
