If I power down my PC, the monitor goes off/dark on its own. When I restart the PC, the monitor comes on without touching the power button. If I shut off the PX2370 BEFORE I shut off the PC, the PX2370 won't come on again the next time I restart- I have to push the power button. The power switch at the bottom of the screen is the touch sensitive type. Is the power completely off or is it using power in the first example? I could find nothing in the manual about this topic. Thanks for any info!
