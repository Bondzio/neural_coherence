<s> I have an IDE configured SATA HDD with Windows 7 currently running on it. </s>
<s> (WD Caviar 500GB) I have a twin for this disk, currently not installed. </s>
<s> I would like to, if possible configure these two disks so that it registers in Windows as a single disk (1TB) with one drive letter. </s>
<s> Any help or pointers is greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Create an image of the disk with your operating system and software. </s>
<s> Use the imaging software of your choice to do this. </s>
<s> Make at least two copies on two different drives. </s>
<s> Next, install the two 500GB disks on RAID enabled ports and create the RAID-0 array. </s>
<s> All data will be lost on both drives during this process. </s>
<s> When that is completed, restore the image to the RAID array. </s>
<s> Windows should see it as one drive. </s>
<s> With a little luck, Windows will be happy. </s>
<s> What you'd want to do beforehand, however, is to enable RAID for the ports you plan to use and make sure drivers are installed. </s>
<s> Good luck </s>
<s> Could I use Acronis Disk Director to copy disk to an external? </s>
<s> and then what do I do install both drives and then set it u via the bios? </s>
<s> Also how do I restore the system copy from the external at that point. </s>
<s> I am pretty nervous. </s>
<s> Also how do I find If I have the right drivers installed? </s>
<s> and wouldn't those be on the motherboard? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> If you use Acronis, you use their True Image product. </s>
<s> Disk Director deals mostly with partitioning. </s>
<s> You could use Acronis True Image to create a full backup image of your existing drive but you'd want to be sure that the restoration process would go smoothly. </s>
<s> You'd be moving to RAID-0 which means Windows needs the RAID drivers that go with your motherboard. </s>
<s> Those should come on the CD. </s>
<s> You'd need to enable the ports you want to use for RAID and let Windows detect the change so you could get the drivers in place. </s>
<s> Then you'd create the disk image. </s>
<s> Next you'd connect the two drives to the RAID designated ports and boot into the RAID bios to configure the drives. </s>
<s> You'll be asked which drives to use and the two should already show. </s>
<s> You'll be asked whether RAID-1 or RAID-0 but it may not be phrased that way. </s>
<s> You select RAID-0. </s>
<s> It may say &quot;performance&quot; and not mirror. </s>
<s> Once done, you let the BIOS configure the array and all data will be lost on your old drive. </s>
<s> Once the array is created, You boot from the Acronis disk while the HD with the image you created is present on another HD. </s>
<s> It could be an external. </s>
<s> You have Acronis restore the entire image to the RAID array and you may alter the size of the partition at this time. </s>
<s> Once done, you remove the Acronis disk and restart the PC. </s>
<s> You re-enter the BIOS and set the RAID array as the first HD in the boot sequence. </s>
<s> Cross your fingers and restart. </s>
<s> If all goes well, you're golden. </s>
<s> If not, you troubleshoot. </s>
<s> Personally, I don't recommend doing this. </s>
<s> You're going to need a good backup plan. </s>
<s> The array will eventually fail. </s>
<s> It's not a matter of &quot;if&quot; but &quot;when&quot;. </s>
<s> You do want to be sure the HDs you use are specified for RAID use. </s>
<s> Some newer drives have sophisticated re-alignment cycles that cause problems with RAID. </s>
<s> You're on your own. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Yeah I will have to get True Image. </s>
<s> and as far as the driver disk goes...Um thats in the garbage. </s>
<s> I got this tower from my moms boss, which was originally configured for RAID 0 and they wanted to wipe the drives so I had put an 3.5 in it until they gave me the drives back. </s>
<s> Then I used crummy easus disk copy to get it on one of the original disks, then I decided to shoot for RAID. </s>
<s> I know I painted myself into a corner. </s>
<s> LOL. </s>
<s> These two drives were originally manufactured for RAID. </s>
<s> Yeah I do alot of that.....&quot;Cross your fingers and restart.&quot; Thanks dude. </s>
<s> You cleared a lot up for me. </s>
