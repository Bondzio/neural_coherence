1.1.1	Hi , a brief explanation of my Dell Dimension 2350 's problems : My computer would not boot at all one day recently when I turned it on .	St
1.1.2	No Dell screen even , let alone anything with Windows .	St
1.1.3	It has been a reliable computer for a few years .	St
1.1.4	I tried a few times and it did boot up .	St
1.1.5	Once .	St
1.1.6	Duing that time I ran virus protect .	St
1.1.7	Nothing .	St
1.1.8	I have firewalls and virus protect so I did not think so .	St
1.1.9	Since then I have tried installing Windows on another , formatted HD .	St
1.1.10	It goes through early install steps , but then wo n't go to Windows , but circles back again like nothing was installed .	St
1.1.11	So I checked BIOS .	St
1.1.12	It is not recognizing the attached HD .	St
1.1.13	I tried a few different HD .	St
1.1.14	Different cables .	St
1.1.15	Nothing .	St
1.1.16	It does recognize my CD/DVD drives .	St
1.1.17	I reset the BIOS .	St
1.1.18	I was going to flash BIOS .	St
1.1.19	The Diagnostic code lights in the back are yellow , green , green , yellow .	St
1.1.20	Not one that is on the list I have .	St
1.1.21	But similar ( opposite ) to Board failure .	St
1.1.22	I wonder if it is the IDE port on the motherboard .	St
1.1.23	DO I need to replace the motherboard ?	Ques
1.1.24	If so , do I have to buy the exact same one ?	Ques
1.1.25	There are a lot of cables that go to the front I have not seen on other mbs .	St
1.1.26	ANY thoughts would be great .	Polite
1.1.27	This computer was working fine .	St
1.1.28	No changes .	St
1.1.29	And then poof , not working .	St
1.1.30	THANKS !	St
1.1.31	!	St
1.2.1	The first thing that I would check is the power supply .	St
1.2.2	Dell desk tops are not noted for their power supplies as I have personally witnessed three of them going bad in the past year .	St
1.2.3	One of the problems seems to be that Dell sizes them to just carry the load on what they installed and if the owner changes drives or adds a device , often there is not enough spare power supply to carry the load .	St
1.2.4	Also as a power supply ages , the component parts decay a bit and usurp more power from the load causing failure .	St
1.2.5	Norm	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the help How do I check the power ?	Ques
1.3.2	I will disconnect all other devices ( CD/DVD drives ) .	St
1.3.3	I did add a 2nd HD to the computer and another fan .	St
1.3.4	Would the lack of power hurt the hardware , ie .	St
1.3.5	cause the motherboard to stop working .	St
1.3.6	Thanks !	St
1.4.1	I would tell you to add up all the loads from all your devices and match it against the wattage output of your power supply , but this would add to the confusion since you do not know how to do this by lookinng at the data plates on all your devices.However , that information is readly available if you google for it .	St
1.4.2	Instead I will refer you to : http : //www.quepublishing.com/articles/article.asp ? p=31105 & seqNum=9 PC Repair and Maintenance : In-depth Look at Power Supply Be sure to look at all the articles .	St
1.4.3	Also , look at : http : //www.quepublishing.com/articles/article.asp ? p=339053 Dell proprietary ( non-standard ) ATX design Note that Dell has seen the light and on their newer machines they use a standard power supply , but do not trust that , check your system carefully .	St
1.4.4	You may have to order a more robust supply from Dell if it is one of those propriortary units .	St
1.4.5	In the meantime , disconnect a couple of devices such as your CD and Floppy and see if the HD is detected .	St
1.4.6	This would indicate if you have an inadequate power supply .	St
1.4.7	Norm	St
1.5.1	Thanks for the articles , I skimmed and they were very interesting .	St
1.5.2	Unfortunately , everything seems to have power .	St
1.5.3	I disconnected everything except the HD and it still is not seen by BIOS .	St
1.5.4	I even ran the Dell diognstic cd and it ran tests on the HD and declared it fine !	St
1.5.5	and flashed BIOS .	St
1.5.6	It just does not detect the HD .	St
1.5.7	I 've used different HDs , too .	St
1.5.8	Therefore I assume I have a faulty motherboard .	St
1.5.9	Oh well , thanks for the help .	Polite
1.5.10	Any other thoughts are welcome before I call Dell and order the thing	St
