1.1.1	Hey , I 'm new to these forums and do n't exactly know if this is the right place for this question .	St
1.1.2	I 'm at college and was lucky enough to get a room this year that has wireless internet connection ( it 's close to the common room ) .	St
1.1.3	But next year I wo n't be so lucky .	Polite
1.1.4	So , in an attempt to get some sort of wireless in my dorm room next year I 've been researching ad hoc networks ( personal routers are n't allowed ) .	St
1.1.5	I ca n't find anything that would make an ad hoc network not allowed , but the problem would be that either my roommate or myself would have to keep our laptop plugged in to the internet cable get the network in our room .	St
1.1.6	My question is : is there a way I could construct my own type of router ?	Ques
1.1.7	I was thinking of a very stripped down computer with networking capability to relay the internet to my roommate and my computer .	St
1.1.8	I have never built a computer before , but would enjoy the challenge , but I would like to know if it is even possible before I go out and buy parts or whatever .	St
1.1.9	Also , if anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated .	St
1.1.10	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	It 's this simple .	St
1.2.2	That would be a personal router by any other name .	St
1.3.1	but I could envision wireless NIC that had the ability to act as an AP .	St
1.3.2	It could be bridged to a wired NIC in the same PC was plugged into wall jack .	St
1.3.3	I 've done that in my own home to create a wireless network until buying a real AP .	St
1.3.4	It worked but did n't work all that well .	St
1.3.5	But , I get to manage the router and you do n't get to do that at your college .	St
1.3.6	I would n't do anything that circumvents policy and the reason for it .	St
1.3.7	They can cut you off altogether in the blink of an eye .	St
