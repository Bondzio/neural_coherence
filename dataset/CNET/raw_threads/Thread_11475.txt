I plan to mount it to the ceiling. It will just be using it with my computer for general applications and display (not for gaming). The projection distance will be about 8 to 10 feet. Ideally I would like to have 1024 x 768 resolution, but could live with less. Most of the projectors that have come up in my search are over $1000.00. Can anyone recommend a good projector or two, that is under $1000.00 (including the networking capability). Also, do I need a special wireless router to use it? I just have a broadband wireless router (Linksys WRT160N), will this work for this purpose? Thank you.

I would be guessing you thought you could use Wifi to get an image from your PC (?) to the projector. I could be wrong. Look at http://www.veebeam.com for another wireless solution. Bob

Although it mentions that it is for use with a TV, I assume that plugging that into the USB port of a projector, that it should transmit the image through? I though most projectors though used either VGA/DVI/HDMI for video signals... so would a USB link work? With regard to the WiFi reference, most of the units I have seen refer to WiFi as a connection. Certainly if there are other (cheaper) options out there such as BlueTooth or USB Wireless, then I indeed would be interested in those options as well. Thanks.
