<s> I have a Microsoft Wheel Mouse Optical and am running XP. </s>
<s> Ever so often the pointer onscreen locks up and will not move. </s>
<s> The keyboard work and I am able to restart the computer, which resets the pointer, but after a few hour and in the middle of a game or program, the pointer will lock up again. </s>
<s> I've downloaded the updated software from the Microsoft web site and the problem remains. </s>
<s> Anyone know what the problem is and how to fix it or do I need to buy a new mouse? </s>
<s> Try this. </s>
<s> Remove the computer's case cover to sniff out if there is a heat issue. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> Just another few posts about this and it was an issue. </s>

<s> I agree with Robert as you may have the beginning of a heat issue. </s>
<s> Maybe a simple cleaning of compents(blow it out) will help. </s>
<s> A possible system case fan may have failed unknown to you, so inspect *all* fans and such. </s>
<s> You can also, just walk away from the system and see if the mouse unfreezes. </s>
<s> If it unfreezes, then its doing something in the bkgrd. </s>
<s> and temporary sucks the resources at that time, use you anti-virus scanner and/or trojan scanner to best handle any malware at work. </s>
<s> Understand also overtime, things get clogged system wise, thus abit of house cleaning maybe in order, review all pgms, to keep or remove. </s>
<s> Look into the above or get back with your results. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
