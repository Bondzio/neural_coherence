hello, we do not have any such legal problem in india as of now for the router power etc for home users.
i want the best router so that i can use it at home (in an office environment too).
i have not seen this question before anywhere, as i am the one making it on few more sites, as i have to purchase this today, we have some clients expected in office and have to show them important presentations.
i posted this question on tomshwardware too, if i can get better solution from available choices i have.
i have only following routers i can buy in my city at present (apart from the flipkart link i gave you above), please let me know if you can suggest something.
