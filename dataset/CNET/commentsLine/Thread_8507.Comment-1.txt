the technology has passed me by in the last 5 years.
my pc has an intel proccessor rated at 1.8 ghz.
now thay are talking about dual and quad core at 2.2 ghz.
this is a little confusing to my 68 year old brain.
i need a new machine but need to understand this before i go forward.
thanks to anyone that can help me.
