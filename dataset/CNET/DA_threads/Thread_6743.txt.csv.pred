1.1.1	Recommendation on a graphics card I have a Dell Dimension 4700 2.8ghz Pentium 4 1.75gb 305 watts.	St
1.1.2	As of now I have no graphics card other then the integrated one on the board.	St
1.1.3	I want to run Adobe CS3 (lightly, sketchup, and watch moives on my Dell Ultra sharp 24 monitor.	St
1.1.4	Basically I want the most dedicated memory without upping the 305watts power source.	St
1.1.5	(256mb?)	St
1.1.6	And get the best resolution out of my monitor and cheap!	St
1.1.7	I will eventually be retiring this computer for movies and music.	St
1.1.8	It has a PCI express slot.	St
1.1.9	Thank you very much for your advice.	St
1.1.10	Brian	St
1.2.1	You either get a larger power supply or run the risk of the current one dying with the larger power drain.	St
1.2.2	There are no alternatives here.	St
1.3.1	Brian, You might also see huge increases in performance by upgrading your processor.	St
1.3.2	The Pentium 4 is an old processor using old architecture.	St
1.3.3	Current Core 2 Duo or Core 2 Quad processors not only consume less power but will also give you a significant performance boost.	St
1.3.4	For example, a Core 2 Quad 8300 can convert 29 Hi-res photos into a video slideshow more than 5X faster than a Pentium 4-630 (a 3.0 GHz processor.	St
1.3.5	Also, most consumer software suites out there today are optimized to take advantage of multi-core processors.	St
1.3.6	I realize that you probably cant upgrade your processor with your current MB, perhaps an investment in a new system would be worthwhile.	St
1.3.7	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Full disclosure: TimWoodChip is an Intel employee and consumer PC expert.	St
1.4.1	I just want to get it going for cheap.	St
1.4.2	I plan on getting a laptop.	St
1.4.3	The processor is fast enough to do what I want it to do: some graphic but mainly music and movies.	St
1.4.4	With the existing computer I have, what would be the best video card I can put in for cheap that gets me max resolution (1920 x 1200 / 60 Hz)?	St
1.5.1	Hi Brian I think you could go with a mid range vidieo card and be just fine with you power supply and system.	St
1.5.2	If you want a quick, cheap upgrade to accomplish your goals it would be a resonable option just to add a PCIE graphics card.	St
1.5.3	May I suggest a Geforce 8600 based card such as http://www.techforless.com/cgi-bin/tech4less/PVT84JYAJG?mv_pc=google_base&tts=20090507020701 .	St
1.5.4	It is not a power hog and it is not expensive and yet it delivers outstanding performance.	St
1.5.5	Just my $.02 zonzin	St
1.6.1	it'll work fine for you: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814131084	St
