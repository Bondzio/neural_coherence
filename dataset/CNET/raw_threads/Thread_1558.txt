I spotted a review with the 6750 topping out at 300 Watts and you have 2 of those. Try finding a review with maximum Wattage noted and then re-check your choice of power supply. Bob

Seems like a nice pile of parts. Let's hope you are good with installing Windows. It's just like it was years ago. Driver hunts. Bob
