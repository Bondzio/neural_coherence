pc pro's review says this about that card: &quot;verdict: poor performer but worth a look if building a media centre the 7300 le is the latest addition to nvidia's entry-level range.
as it's essentially an under-clocked 7300 gs, its performance is too poor to recommend it as a gaming card.
with its 450mhz core clock and 256mb of 333mhz memory, we saw unplayable frame rates even at 1,024 x 768 in both test games - 15fps in call of duty 2 and 13fps in far cry - and it isn't exactly overflowing with features either.&quot; thus, that isn't high end.
now if you put a nvidia geforce 8800 gtx that costs about $600 into it, that would be high end and really high end is if you use sli on two of those cards.
