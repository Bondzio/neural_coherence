<s> Hi I have a cable modem gateway that works on wifi g now. </s>
<s> The problem I have is at 100% power I only can get 45~50% signal on my notebook two rooms away. </s>
<s> I plan to get a desktop on wifi g and one of them new wifi gaming system due out next year. </s>
<s> I was looking at the D-link DGL-4300 gaming router. </s>
<s> It looks like it's got a lot of power and range? </s>
<s> than most other router of it's kind? </s>
<s> Is this as good as it looks? </s>
<s> I like the 108Mbps power and the gigabit stuff. </s>
<s> Or can you think of a better router certified by wifi? </s>
<s> Thank you for your help and time. </s>
<s> Sounds proper to me. </s>
<s> It's simple physics. </s>
<s> With that omnidirectional antenna, the power emits in all directions and exponential decreases as you move away. </s>
<s> Another router/wifi unit has the same laws to contend with. </s>
<s> If you are the only user, fashion an deflector like this -&gt; Parabolic Antenna for Wifi found with this GOOGLE. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?q=Deep+Dish+Cylindrical+Parabolic+Template Bob </s>
<s> Man if I can put one on that will help, but My gateway has a built in antenna. </s>
<s> I was told not to go with it but I did.---So I need a new wi-fi g router, we have 2 users and one more soon? </s>
<s> and need one that can give great power all around the house we got two computer to the East side of the house (about 20' away) one on the gateway. </s>
<s> and when we add on to the house some far north (about 30' away?) </s>
<s> I use the notebook all over the house but it works on low signal from the gateway, but I think it can be faster. </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>
<s> It's all physics, so dive in. </s>
<s> Hi thank you for your great info I think that will work great, but I need some thing that fit in to the living room. </s>
<s> this is a problem for me since I was told to go with Apple/Mac Airport router. </s>
<s> I have all Macs-- I did not get it becuse I think it's too big and won't look good in the room some of my family member has problem with large computer stuff in the room. </s>
<s> this is why I bought a small gateway router. </s>
<s> My hope is to get one that I can use at 40'/ 360 around with great power and speed. </s>
<s> I use my laptop all around my house. </s>
<s> man I might need to go wire I am new to this wifi thing and it's hard to get it just right!!! </s>
<s> Again thank you for all your help. </s>
