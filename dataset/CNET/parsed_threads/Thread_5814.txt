<s> E85000 GA-P35-DS3L OCZ 6400 TITANIUM x4 LIBERTY ENERMAX 620W(have this already) sapphire X1900XTX (have already) hi all, having read then re-read hundreds of post i decided to bit the bullet and go for the above listed. </s>
<s> Im a little bit annoyed that i went for the RAM i chose because 10 mins after i placed the order i read that i would have been better to have went with Corsair dominator 8500. i have a little wok to do with the bios on the MB - think its F8a i need but that should be ok. other that that its just wait and see.... i got the cheap mobo and ram cus i decisded to wait til next year to go DDR3 as its just to expensive for me rite now. </s>
<s> anyone got a similar set up and have pionts to offer i would love to hear them. </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> ok heres what happened... went to boot up, turned my back for a second to look for my winodows disk, the pc had gone past bios and had begun starting window from my disk drive- so i was chuffed the bios version was f7 im not sure if i still need to flash for f8a (probly) when i checked the system status it showed the E8500 clocked at 3.16, and not 3.12, any reason why that mite be? </s>
<s> i still have a bit of work to do yet, i couldnt help trying to see if it would run a game (i didnt reinstall graphics drivers) but the game got so far until i wanted to start a level then pc restarted - graphics drivers? </s>
<s> probly any way il see what happenes later and will update this post incase there are ppl out there lookin to get a simialar set up. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> still least someone read it ..... </s>
<s> ok so i updated all drivers - ( did not reload windows tho...) and every thing looked fine so i ran Medieval total war on full with texture up max etc. </s>
<s> the game played well for an hour then began to lag. </s>
<s> i rebooted but now i cant get windows to fully start - it hand just before or just after my screensaver comes up... i also wanted to check if my water cooling was working on the cpu so after i unpluigged power etc i tester the temp of the water block with my finger and i was cool however the ram was boiling ! </s>
<s> would this be resolved by windows reload or should i attempt f8a bios flash ?! </s>
<s> ? </s>
