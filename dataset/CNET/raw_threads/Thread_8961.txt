I connected my WD Essential 500gb with all my documents (photos mostly)to my new HP. When I click the desktop shortcut a window with all the folders appears instantly. When I click on a folder to view it's contents it says 'Not Responding&quot; for 20-30 minutes before finally showing it contents. This slowness will sometimes affect other programs I have running at the same time. I've called HP who convinced me to re-format my brand new computer...didn't work. any ideas? thanks, carl

Vista was very busy trying to make thumbnails of the files. Part of the problem was missing codecs so for each file that failed it took about a minute for vista to give up. Rather than use Explorer try Gyula's Navigator. Is that fast? Bob

Also I plugged it into a third computer w/XP and it's still faster but....it's now saying there's no information in some folders...Folders that I have over 10,000 photos in... I'm taking it back to Microcenter today to see what they can do.

Might be good numbers for comparison. Also reading another post from Bob P reminded of another possibility. Go into your BIOS and turn off USB Legacy Support.(the effects or downsides are listed below). Save the settings and see how it works transferring data. Symptoms if USB Legacy Support is Disabled If USB Legacy Support is disabled in the BIOS, you will not be able to use your USB mouse or keyboard in any of the following situations: Running your computer in Safe mode. Using a Windows Startup menu. Starting your computer in MS-DOS mode (instead of opening a MS-DOS session from Windows). Starting your computer from a floppy disk or leaving a floppy disk in the drive when you turn on or restart your computer. Windows &quot;blue screen&quot; errors that ask you to &quot;Press any key to continue&quot;. Responding to ScanDisk and other messages during the start-up sequence. Editing or upgrading the BIOS. Entering a BIOS password
