1.1.1	Dell Inspiron 530S , 32bit Windows 7 .	St
1.1.2	Over the last year I 've replaced everything but the motherboard and HDD which is a 320GB Samsung SATA HDD .	St
1.1.3	Well now the HDD is starting to make a gring sound and failed to boot thrice .	St
1.1.4	The bios came up on start but no OS until rebooting several times.Fans turned and everything lit up .	St
1.1.5	I ordered this & gt ; & gt ; http : //www.amazon.com/WD-Blue-Desktop-Hard-Drive/dp/B0088PUEPK/ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=UTF8 & amp ; qid=1377289650 & amp ; sr=8-1 & amp ; keywords=WD+Blue+1+TB+Desktop+Hard+Drive % 3A+3.5+Inch % 2C+7200+RPM % 2C+SATA+6+Gb % 2Fs % 2C+64+MB+Cache+-+WD10EZEX and it 's 1TB .	St
1.1.6	When I install the os from my Image Disc will it formatt the whole disc so I can use it or will I need to create partitions ?	Ques
1.1.7	I will also be install some flavor of Linux .	St
1.1.8	Thanks for your time Digger	St
1.2.1	I was looking for .	St
1.2.2	When I use the Win 7 Image Disc 's , It will do just that , give me an image of my 320 GB hdd .	St
1.2.3	can use Acronis or something else to create other partitions for Linux or games or whatever .	Ques
1.2.4	I still might need some coaching though .	St
1.2.5	I 've never installed a New hdd .	St
1.2.6	Let the New Learning Experience Begin ... ... Digger	St
1.3.1	You have done it already ?	Ques
1.3.2	It may give you the operating system but I would n't think it would give you everything that 's in the 320GB drive .	St
1.4.1	I 'm not sure about that but I am sure that the only thing going on the new hard drive is whats on the image discs I made but not sure what else to do yet .	St
1.5.1	All the Dell 's I 've seen the last few years come with a recovery partition on the hard drive , so before replacing the current drive , do what you can to save that partition and make recovery discs in accordance with your user guide .	St
1.5.2	You can get the computer working without it if you reinstall , but you never know when you 're going to need to restore to factory settings .	St
1.5.3	In fact you might want to do that with the new drive so you do n't have the hassle of finding and installing the right ones with the new hard drive .	St
1.5.4	I imagine you 've seen posts in this forum where folks have reinstalled from scratch and had all kinds of driver problems - something you 'd do well to avoid when you can .	St
1.5.5	` Good luck .	Polite
1.6.1	I use these two programs all the time , and I guarantee they will create an image you can use to restore everything on the partition .	St
1.6.2	Just remember that Windows 7 can put boot info on other partitions unless you 're using what came from Dell .	St
1.6.3	This of course means that just saving and restoring C : is n't enough when the boot info is on a different partition .	St
1.6.4	` Good luck .	Polite
1.7.1	If you 're going to or have installed Linux , I 'm sure you know that it has its own file system , so I 'd put it in a separate partition all by itself .	St
1.7.2	If you 've installed it on a partition with Windows , it can really complicate things .	St
1.7.3	If this is the case , I 'd say rule # 1 applies .	St
1.8.1	would I be better off using the original disc 's that came with the computer instead of using my image disc 's ?	Ques
1.9.1	Rule # 1 : Know what you 're doing !	St
1.10.1	Digger , what do you have on the C : partition ?	Ques
1.10.2	If you have just Windows 7 with its boot info and no Linux , I 'd go for a good backup/restore program like Ghost or Easeus .	St
1.10.3	The Control Panel 's Administrative Tools - & gt ; Computer Management - & gt ; Disk tool will tell you if C : has the boot info .	St
1.10.4	Like I say though , if you 've installed Linux inside that C : partition , you might want to go with the discs to restore to factory settings .	St
1.10.5	It gets real complicated in this case .	St
1.11.1	nothing more .	St
1.11.2	It 's Vista/Win7 upgrade on the image disc 's	St
1.12.1	NIL	St
1.13.1	this is pretty pretty much the way it was from the factory only a bunch of new parts I replaced .	St
1.13.2	This is my learning/play machine .	St
1.14.1	Then where does the Vista/Windows 7 upgrade come into the picture ?	Ques
1.14.2	Vista is a complicating variable I do n't understand .	St
1.14.3	Also I 'd use that Control Panel applet I mentioned earlier to verify that the boot info is actually on C : .	St
1.15.1	putting the hdd in now	St
1.16.1	I installed the new hdd and used my system image disc 's to load theOS .	St
1.16.2	The new Hdd put 294.09 GB on the C drive , 4.00 GB Health Primary Partition and 633.42 Unallocated .	St
1.16.3	Now I 'm gon na change the optical drive than I 'll play with that unallocated space .	St
1.16.4	I 'll be wanting to put a Linux Distro on there ... ..Digger	St
1.17.1	Congratulations , Digger !	St
1.17.2	It 's a great feeling when something like that comes and runs like you want it to .	St
1.17.3	When you get ready to install Linux , but sure to put it in a separate partition because it gets very complicated otherwise .	St
1.17.4	Also even in a separate partition , once you install Linux you ca n't resize any partitions without making everything unbootable .	St
1.17.5	This is the voice of experience !	St
1.17.6	So be sure you 've got your partitions set up like you 'll want them for the rest of that hard drive 's life before installing it .	St
1.18.1	soon WPG .	St
1.18.2	I 'm gon na start a & quot ; How Too & quot ; thread about that in the Linux forum so we can share the info with other people .	St
1.18.3	Other folks will be interested in my question ... .Digger	St
