1.1.1	Alright ...	St
1.1.2	This happened a few years ago , but the & quot ; case & quot ; has been unsolved , so it still bugs me , and I want to find out what the deal is .	St
1.1.3	I had a Dell computer with Windows XP .	St
1.1.4	It ran great , with the exceptioon that the duel-core pentium could not stand up to my nearly full 200 Gig Samsung hard disk , and it would , on rare occasions ( and I mean RARE ) , freeze .	St
1.1.5	I noticed one day it was getting pretty dusty inside , so I took it apart to clean it .	St
1.1.6	And no , I 'm not stupid ( I 'm certified in computer hardware ) .	St
1.1.7	I know for a fact that every single wire was hooked up fully , and properly to their corresponding components .	St
1.1.8	I checked before , during , and after the time span my air compressor was in use .	St
1.1.9	I got it spick and span , and once again , checked all cords and any connection I could spot , and made sure it was proprly placed .	St
1.1.10	I set up my computer , and I turned it on .	St
1.1.11	I waited , ... And I waited ... . Until I finally noticed that nothing had kicked on , but I could hear SOMETHING inside .	St
1.1.12	There were no lights with the exception of the pilot light on the back of the power supply .	St
1.1.13	I had just bought my power supply a month prior , so I 'm pretty sure it was still in top condition .	St
1.1.14	I removed my side panel and inspected .	St
1.1.15	My front fan was not on , my power supply fan was NOT running , despite the fact that the power supply pilot was green , and my motherboard light was out .	St
1.1.16	The ONLY thing that was running was the CPU fan .	St
1.1.17	I could n't turn my power off by pressing the front switch either .	St
1.1.18	I had no choice but to manually shut it down by unplugging it .	St
1.1.19	There was no smoke , no flame , no spark .	St
1.1.20	Just ... well ... nothing running .	St
1.1.21	I tried it a second time , and it did it again .	St
1.1.22	I was definitely nervous that something had happened to my motherboard or power supply by now .	St
1.1.23	Just to be safe , I removed my hard drive and RAM sticks , and tested them in another computer to make sure nothing was shorted .	St
1.1.24	Everything worked fine , including the power supply after I removed/tested it .	St
1.1.25	So one last time , I pressed the switch .	St
1.1.26	And voila.~ Everything booted up just fine .	St
1.1.27	This lasted a good half a year , and then the process repeated .	St
1.1.28	What 's the deal ?	Ques
1.1.29	Would it be a faulty power supply ?	Ques
1.1.30	I 'd really like to know .	St
1.1.31	Thanks !	St
1.1.32	-Misty	St
1.2.1	I ca n't give a definite answer but find this happens quite often .	St
1.2.2	In fact as techs , calls to such problems are common .	St
1.2.3	Yet , when the tech boots up the PC it just goes away .	St
1.2.4	More importantly , the problem does n't return or get a call back .	St
1.2.5	Basically , you consider this a fluke and leave it at that .	St
1.2.6	No one is going to pay to actually find the issue but get the PC going .	St
1.2.7	It 's far cheaper to replace parts and leave once its running .	St
1.2.8	Understand , while a PC is somewhat complex , these are running components that require little in voltages and minor amps and the PSU is core to get it all going .	St
1.2.9	Even , under stress conditions it will do fine until it poops out .	St
1.2.10	When all is said and done , OEM based PCs are build to mirror their needs thus various models out there .	St
1.2.11	Those PCs that become stressed and they will generally under the & quot ; logical boot sequence & quot ; depend on the events of power-ON to happen .	St
1.2.12	If not meant , refuse to complete the cycle .	St
1.2.13	The results can be confusing at least but generally speaking a repeated attempts do result in a good boot .	St
1.2.14	Which in turn suggest a bad PSU or faltering one .	St
1.2.15	The other half is the mtrbd .	St
1.2.16	which house the & quot ; logical ckts & quot ; and again if less than desired will refuse to boot .	St
1.2.17	I like to think the & quot ; uuphf & quot ; is n't there or a weakness becomes apparent .	St
1.2.18	Those PCs that house top-end GPUs also will partake in poor booting .	St
1.2.19	they require alot to get going but once booted , generally will reboot on demand unless too stressed .	St
1.2.20	Again , notice the pattern that a basic PC if put into stressful conditions may falter .	St
1.2.21	At the same time , PCs that are left alone and ONLY do basic operations , will after time falter too due to wear & tear as they age , they 're less than they were when new .	St
1.2.22	PCs offered today are simple and build for less cost as possible even if of qulaity alot has to work right and often .	St
1.2.23	Even the most expensive build PC still uses off-the-shelf parts , these are not the computers in the world of main frames past and alike .	St
1.2.24	Think of of the typical PC as an appliance and you 'll see where it all leads .	St
1.2.25	IMHO , I offered this scenario for your quest .	St
1.2.26	Otherwise , since you mentioned you were a tech , get the test devices and scopes and tear it all down and find the cause and rely it to us .	St
1.2.27	adios -- -- -- Willy	St
