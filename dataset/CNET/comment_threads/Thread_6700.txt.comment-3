I can get it to print a windows test page (it's just a picture of the windows logo) After I send the print job and it errors, I can restore the defaults.
It runs through and calibrates to the label size and prints what ever print job was in Que.
Even if it's multiple print jobs (either the windows or the intended application.)
However, the whole process repeats it's self after that.
