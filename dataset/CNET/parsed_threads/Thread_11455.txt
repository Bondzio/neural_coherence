<s> Please let me know what you think... </s>
<s> I am ordering the adaptec card to run raid 5 with 4 hdd (ordered 5 in case one dies) [IMG] http://s15.postimage.org/ddn9g8xm3/My_Home_Server.jpg [/IMG] </s>
<s> My only caveat is that you didn't use a &quot;redundant&quot; power server case. </s>
<s> Everything else appears OK, too. </s>
<s> As for the case, that PSU will do, but here too you may want to have a spare PSU. </s>
<s> Now, make darn sure all of this is well cooled, which a server case would have provided and have amble room as well. </s>
<s> Just check out server cases to get a feel of what I'm suggesting here. </s>
<s> I do like 100% you use a true server mtrbd.. tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Is raid 5 for the OS and data fine? </s>
<s> I will be installing the OS on raid 5 then I will be using windows to partiton a new storage &quot;drive&quot;. </s>
<s> is this fine to do? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> of the system that supports it ? </s>
<s> Does the system store only family PICs, tax records or is it used for business and earning a living too ? </s>
<s> The question is ... what level of redundancy and backup are you looking for ? </s>
<s> What if the system was hit by voltage spikes, lightning,flood, tornado, etc., ? </s>
<s> RAID 5 and having a spare HDD is great but but you may need to think beyond that if you want ensure system availability, data access and continuity of business. </s>

<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels The above link should provide an idea of the RAID levels on what they do. </s>
<s> RAID 5 is the robust but still you need the care of a *master backup* to include other back-ups on a regular basis. </s>
<s> While RAID 5 provides for its own data safety, the world still makes it rough at times, thus backups are more than a good idea. </s>
<s> On top of all this the master backup I suggested is for return a working network if a major failure comes about, you can restart again, reloading the basic network and then using whatever other backups to return to some date of last backup., etc.. </s>
<s> I mention this only if all else fails, you have something to return to. </s>
<s> While i didn't suggested before you may want to look at MS Home Server 2011 or similar to better handle network demands. </s>
<s> While Win7 will provide for a decent networking setup it becomes a more stretched use of the OS. </s>
<s> Home Server OS, provides a ready OS to better handle the demands of networking, just a thought to pass on. </s>
<s> I also suggest you get your hands on &quot;networking s/w tools&quot; that are capable of networking needs. </s>
<s> I mention this just as method to make life easier, though you have to find this out by trail and error what suits you. </s>
<s> Google away for such tools and there are freebies or low-cost ones. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I use a simple NAS and for more speed and a second copy a low power 10 Watt Netbook. </s>
<s> About 20 Watts for both. </s>
