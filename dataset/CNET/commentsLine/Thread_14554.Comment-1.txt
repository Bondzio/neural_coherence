my computer has been acting up on start ups and never quite make it to the window's login screen without several reboots on startup.
i replaced the power supply and the graphics card since the fan on both components were not spinning even though i had a successful start up.
however my startup problem still persists and comes and go.
sometimes, while i am online, the system will just reboot as if a ghost in the machine is in control.
i've already tried formatting the hd and re-installing xp pro.
the system is clean of any other software.
are there utilities out there that let's me test the memory, hd, graphics card, and other components?
is the software free?
