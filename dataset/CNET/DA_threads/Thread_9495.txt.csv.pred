1.1.2	when i go to the start menu and click on shut down the computer turns off but in a few seconds it reboots , I have to hold in the power button for a few seconds to shut the machine down completely .	St
1.1.3	Any ideas of how to correct this	St

1.4.1	Use registry repair software from here : http : //www.download.com/3120-20_4.html ? qt=registry+repair & tag=srch & tg=dl-20 ( Some of this software is free , some of it is not . )	St
1.4.2	If this has only just begun , recently then you might use a restore point to revert it to a time before the problem began .	St
1.4.3	If it started immediately when you started the computer for the first time then your stuck with it .	St
1.4.4	If these three approaches fail , live with it or reinstall the OS .	St
1.4.5	If you take this drastic approach to fix the problem make sure the OS installation disk is clean and not scratched before you load it .	St
1.4.6	I do not believe this is a problem with your build .	St
1.4.7	This is an OS glitch .	St
