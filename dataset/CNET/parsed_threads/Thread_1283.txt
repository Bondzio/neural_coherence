<s> Just built a new computer. </s>
<s> It's my 5th one so I'm not a newbie in doing this. </s>
<s> I am having a strange problem though. </s>
<s> Here it goes: Built the computer and installed the OS and everything was fine. </s>
<s> The following day when I came to use the PC I touched it, got a small static shock, which then shut down the computer. </s>
<s> I was quite alarmed, so took the machine apart and checked my mobo install and the front of the case USB ports (heard this might cause this). </s>
<s> I then restarted the machine, created some static, touched the computer and it did not shut down. </s>
<s> Success! </s>
<s> Unfortunately it didn't end there. </s>
<s> The PC ran through the night and when I came to use it the next night I touched the computer with my leg and it shut off. </s>
<s> But there was no shock. </s>
<s> I then rebooted and touched the case, pushed the case, etc. </s>
<s> and it was fine. </s>
<s> A number of hours later I touched the case and it shut off! </s>
<s> This is crazy! </s>
<s> Any ideas as what the problem might be? </s>
<s> I'm thinking perhaps something to do with heat, but I'm not even sure how to proceed.... Any suggestions appreciated! </s>
<s> has a problem. </s>
<s> Seems that your third wire ground is not continuous from the computer to the ground in the Main box. </s>
<s> The erratic shut down times are simply when you have enough of a static charge. </s>
<s> The path of the current [which can be momentarily high] should flow with extremely low resistance and voltage level in the ground wiring, through the ground path. </s>
<s> Also could be caused by a ground wire problem within the Power Supply itself. </s>
<s> A UPS or surge protector in the line??? </s>
<s> Is your mobo properly grounded to the mounting plate?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> HI, NOW SINCE ACCORDING TO WHAT YOU ARE SAYING THAT THE COMPUTER JUST SHUTS DOWN AUTOMATICALLY OR ABRUPTLY, U MIGHT WANT TO CHECK THE PROCESSOR FAN AND HEATSINK ASSEMBLY FOR SEATING PROBLEMS. </s>
<s> MAKE SURE THAT THE FAN AND HEATSINK ASSEMBLY YOU HAVE INSTALLED ARE OF GOOD QUALITY AND IT IS SEATED PROPERLY OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER OVERHEATING PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE ALSO. </s>
<s> consider turning off the all caps. </s>
<s> It is considered to be rude and yelling in internet communication. </s>
<s> Static electricty can do crazy things and it NEED NOT be a sparky amount as seen by many. </s>
<s> Since, this problem repeats alot, at least touch some other grounded device/metal/static(touch) pad to discharge yourself. </s>
<s> Then proceed to the computer and continue on. </s>
<s> If you walk across a rug, carpet or wear staticly clothes that alone will generate the ESD needed and plaque you. </s>
<s> I suggest besides the above get a secerarty's work floor mat used in office's and place under your chair. </s>
<s> Many a mat has a metal contact button to route static to grd. </s>
<s> plug of AC outlet or get that type of mat. </s>
<s> Remember static can be in the thousands of volts range and the simple power ON/OFF swith only needs 5V to work. </s>
<s> These are simple suggestions and it maybe entirely something else, but came to mind as this is the season for such problems. </s>
<s> Also, understand previous static damage if the cause of problems could have comprised the system and its now too readily ease to shutdown for whatever reason as an end result. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Yeah i have the same.. well i would'nt call it a problem. </s>
<s> It's likely to happen to any ones computer. </s>
<s> Just becareful don't be going ahead and restarting your comp with your fingear cause that can really mess up your computer. </s>
