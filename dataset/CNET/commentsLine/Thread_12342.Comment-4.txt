i just got one from amazon to end this whole ordeal.
unfortunately, i've hit another problem.
the ps/2 mouse is now unresponsive when playing games.
i was just in tf2 when the mouse wheel would act on it's own and then the entire mouse will not respond for thirty seconds after.
not to mention how it will randomly stop responding mid turn in other games.
it's a imicro mo-5013p ps/2 mouse.
i was thinking of a driver update, but the imicro site provides none.
should i try the basic optical mouse drivers from microsoft?
