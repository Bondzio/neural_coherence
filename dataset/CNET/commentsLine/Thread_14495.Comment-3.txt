all the rest off my main folder or ok my documents, my network, control pannel.
when i go to open one off the internal or external drives even c drive it opens onother folder, instead off using the my computer folder to open one off the drives.
what is wrong has somthing to do with the my computer folder even though what happened made changes to my other folder that i already corrected.
