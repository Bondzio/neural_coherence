I'm wanting to sell my computer to help for funds towards a new Macbook Pro. So I was wondering if anyone could tell me a good estimate of what my computer might be worth. I've had the computer since September of 2007 and it has little wear and tear. The only thing i see is a small scratch on the side of the tower where I apparently scuffed it on something. I still have the factory reset disks and the original box (not expecting that to really raise the price lol). Ok here are the specifications for the tower: *Acer Aspire T180 *AMD Athlon 64 Processor 3800+ *Genuine Windows Vista Home Basic *4gb(4 1gb sticks) of DDR2 RAM (I think.. can't remember but it's good) *160GB SATA hard drive, 7200 RPM *Double-layer DVD-Dual drive (DVD+/-RW) *NVIDIA GeForce 6100 and nForce 405 MCP integrated graphics solution *56k modem *PS/2 style keyboard *Wireless Mouse (microsoft brand with software) USB speakers Here are the specifications for the LCD Monitor *17&quot; TFT LCD *1280x1024 native resolution *500:1 Contrast Ratio *140 degrees viewing anle *140degrees vertical viewing angle *VGA signal connector *270 cd/m(squared) brightness *8ms response time *Internal power adapter *Black color That's it.. I'm sorry if it's too in depth. I'm hoping maybe $250 but who knows
