I have tried everything thing I know from True Image to new mobo, PSU, RAM, CPU etc. Even got a new SATA HDD to image over and it didn't work either. Originally I had a Epox 8KTA3+ motherboard with RAID 1 and 2 80 GB Western Digitals. They are working fine, I can access them through a USB on 2.0 but need them to boot up on the new mobo if possible so I don't have to migrate to Vista just yet. My new mobo is a Gigabyte GA-MA7GM-S2H. It has RAID on board with SATA too but not working right with these old HDD's. Any suggestions would be apprecaited.

Changing an existing Windows installation from motherboard to motherboard is not a sure thing. Why not do this proper? Bob

I know I can rebuild but don't have the time, or want to. Furthermore, I want to try to wait on a complete rebuild when I'm ready to move to Vista, not now! Thanks for your input though. Chris

I know about the XP SP2 REPAIR INSTALL (see google) where I can press the f6 button at the right time to install the needed raid or sata drivers but I don't duplicate web pages about that. Tell me you have looked into that. We also have a dead end issue which is where the RAID is setup via some onboard BIOS. These are usually incompatible from board to board so any expert will point that out to you and suggest we look again at our disaster recovery plans. Bob
