Most psu should work older power supplies have the conventional 8 (not for sure on the number of pin\wires) pin power supple plug that won't work on the newer 12 pin (not sure again).
Newer boards have to compensate for PCIE and Cpu Core power plugs.
On very rare occassions there are psu that aren't the normal dimension of ATX power supplies but the pins should be the same regardless.
So unless u have an Ultra Small Form Factor HP or Dell computer (or anything) You should be fine.
