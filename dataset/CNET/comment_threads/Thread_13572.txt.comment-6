I've got little or no experience re building functional hardware, but I do like it inside my 'case'.
The only way an o/s could blow up a mobo would be if it could demand to much through one piece of hardware of another.
Is it possible Vista's program include rewrites for operational h'ware so that too much could be asked of another piece.
There seems an awful lot to a mobo, I wonder just which part fails.
Surely there's basic amp meter testing and a dead mobo should be bloody obvious?
I've never unlocked programming & my operative software is well beyond me, but someone versed in software aught to be able to pick changes in programs if they exceeded usual operating ranges or hardware limits.
It strikes me that one of the difficulties developers are facing is the dilemna of limited human concentration span.
It must take a team of people cooperating closely to properly deliver packages of that size I think...
