1.1.1	Hey , I was wondering if there is any possible configuration for a powerline adapter to be connected to a router ( that is connected to a modem ) at one end , and be connected to another router ( ethernet line connecting to the & quot ; Internet & quot ; port ) in a different part of the house at the other end .	St
1.1.2	So basically is it possible to & quot ; broadcast & quot ; the internet on the base router to another router via powerline adapters ?	Ques
1.1.3	I tried this experiment and it showed up another SSID ( & quot ; default & quot ; ) , with excellent connection but it would n't connect successfully .	St
1.1.4	Or could it be that the router is a little outdated ?	Ques
1.1.5	My base router is a just-released Wireless-N Linksys , and the one I am trying to use in a different part is a ( 3-year outdated ) D-Link B/G router .	St
1.1.6	Thanks a lot in advance !	St
1.2.1	Of our forum sticky .	St
1.3.1	Unfortunately , that configuration is impossible for me , as there is no cable jack downstairs to connect my cable modem to ...	St
1.4.1	I re-read your first post and the configuration noted in post 17 will work .	St
1.4.2	( Hint : I 've done it . )	St
1.4.3	So here 's the setup .	St
1.4.4	1 .	St
1.4.5	Cable modem - & gt ; router .	St
1.4.6	2 .	St
1.4.7	An ethernet cable from the router to the first powerline network bridge module .	St
1.4.8	3 .	St
1.4.9	An ethernet cable from the second powerline network bridge module to a port in the second wifi router as noted in post 17 .	St
1.4.10	It 's only slightly hard to setup but it has been done before .	St
1.4.11	If you ca n't do this , ask some other network jockey to try it .	St
1.4.12	Bob	St
1.5.1	I just found out the solution to my problem , or what is affecting my results .	St
1.5.2	Apparently , one side of my house is on a different power line than the other side , and the 2 outlets I 'm trying to use together with the powerline adapters wo n't work together ( after a long series of tests with my laptop ) .	St
1.5.3	This is uber-strange , as it was working all over my house just a few months ago .	St
1.5.4	Is this possible to fix or are the powerline adapters basically useless now ?	Ques
1.6.1	But powerline adapters and that issue is very well known .	St
1.6.2	Their tech support may have the right words for you but here it 's very simple .	St
1.6.3	It must be on the same side of the 220v branch .	St
1.6.4	Some will write & quot ; it worked before & quot ; but that does n't change that it should n't have .	St
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	You have one power line but 3 wires coming into the house .	St
1.7.2	Two wires are & quot ; hot & quot ; and the other is neutral .	St
1.7.3	The neutral side is the transformer & quot ; center tap & quot ; which is the neutral side and hot wires , being AC , run at 180 degrees out of phase to each other .	St
1.7.4	The two 110 AC circuits are distributed throughout your house in a scheme that 's supposed to promote good load balancing and it 's bridging across these that provides your 220 VAC .	St
1.7.5	Poor load balancing creates excessive amounts of current on the neutral wire and can cause a variety of problems .	St
1.7.6	Anyway , if you want to know which 120 lines are common , go to your circuit breaker box and shut everything off on one side ... left or right .	St
1.7.7	Then check all the outlets to see which ones are still live .	Sug
1.7.8	In this way you should be able to find 2 that will server your purpose .	St
