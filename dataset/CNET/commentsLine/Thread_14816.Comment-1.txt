hi, i have 2 linksys wireless routers, a wrt300n and an old befw11s4.
i do not get good signal with the wrt300n even when i'm just a couple rooms away.
i was wondering if it would be possible to connect the old router to the new one so i would be able to have 2 wireless access points in my house.
thanks
