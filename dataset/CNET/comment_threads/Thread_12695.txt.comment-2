That using FAT in any version is death to such a project.
No matter what you do you should see failure after failure.
Even on a clean shutdown it can still fail.
I had to let a customer learn this over a full year before they gave up and changed to NTFS.
That's not damage proof but at least it's journaled and damage resistant.
Why not fix the basic issue first?
