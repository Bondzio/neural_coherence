i currently have sony vegas 7 video editing software but need a capture box to capture video from vhs.
i was considering a moviebox from pinnacle and see two kinds i could try to bid for.
is there a difference between the deluxe version and the plus version besides cosmetics?
does the newer model produce better quality?
or, would you recommend a different breakout box?
