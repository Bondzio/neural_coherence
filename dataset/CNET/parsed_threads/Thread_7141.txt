<s> My laptop computer shows that I have four identical monitors in my hardware manager. </s>
<s> I'm only using the one that is built in to the computer. </s>
<s> The Windows display control shows two monitors. </s>
<s> The first has very limited display settings and the second one has much more, but I can't seem to change my primary monitor. </s>
<s> I have a Mobility Raden 9000 display adapter, but the control program will not let me change the primary monitor or any monitor schemes. </s>
<s> Can someone help me? </s>
<s> I'm having the same problem but with NVidia GForce 440 Go chipset. </s>
<s> Did you figure the problem out? </s>
