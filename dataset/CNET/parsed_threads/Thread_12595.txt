<s> Hi all, Is there anyone own a HP PSC 1610 All-in-One Printer/Scanner ? </s>
<s> I'v just bought one and to my dissappointment, I think the scanning quality is quite bad. </s>
<s> Attached a scanned sample here: [IMG] http://i29.photobucket.com/albums/c267/liewss80/hp-scanner.jpg [/IMG] (If cant view the above pic, goto http://i29.photobucket.com/albums/c267/liewss80/hp-scanner.jpg ) Check out those straight lines in the attached picture, my original drawing is a very clean-cut straightline, very fine but my scanned result is like this. </s>
<s> Its the problem with my scanner or setting? </s>
<s> Any advise/comment? </s>

<s> Tried few times using different DPI, up to 600 x 1200 dpi...still the same. </s>
<s> Don't think it comes with money back satisfaction guarantee. </s>
<s> I just wanna find out whether all this model have such problem or the prob with my unit only... TQ </s>
<s> A non-performing product can be returned due to... non-performance. </s>
<s> At 600x1200 DPI, on screen will be at most 100 DPI so it will be like looking at it at 72X under a microscope. </s>
<s> Be sure to view onscreen at something reasonable. </s>
<s> Wish I had your setup to test, but armed with only this discussion, it's defective and needs to be returned. </s>
