1.1.1	I bought a new hdtv and I am trying to get all my stuff connected with the receiver I have.	St
1.1.2	I have my XBOX 360, Blu Ray and HDTV Cable box connected to the back of my tv with 3 HDMI cables.	St
1.1.3	The tv has an optical out so I have an optical cable to my reciever so all those things are in surround sound.	St
1.1.4	I have my desktop connected to the tv with a VGA, the audio is connected from the headphones jack to an auxillary port (RCA).	St
1.1.5	I have some DVD backups on my hard drive and I would like to get the sound instead of standard stereo to be 5.1.	St
1.1.6	The problem is the only port I have left on my older receiver is the composite audio which is an older technology but would give me what I want.	St
1.1.7	I searched everywhere on the internet and the only audio cards I could find have optical out, hdmi, or the computer speakers 5.1 style.	St
1.1.8	I will probably have to get an older card from ebay since this technology is kind of dated but if anyone can point me in the direction of a specific one I would be so very greatful.	St
1.2.1	so instead of plugging the phone to TV RCA why not plug them into receiver RCA?	St
1.2.2	Isn't that what composite audio is (white/red)?	St
1.2.3	Then set your receiver to fake 5.1 out for that input.	St
1.3.1	From what I understand composite audio was one cable that handled the 5.1 signal, on my receiver its the DVD/6Channel input.	St
1.4.1	what you are looking for is on the audio card or built-in audio on the computer; Your earphone or line-out are such connections.	Ques
1.4.2	You just have to get one of those plug to RCA adapter cable.	St
1.5.1	That's actually what I have, I have a headphone jack to (Red and White) RCA cables but that only produces 2.0 stereo.	St
1.5.2	I AM LOOKING FOR A PCI CARD FOR MY DESKTOP COMPUTER THAT HAS A COMPOSITE AUDIO OUTPUT WHICH WILL PRODUCE 5.1 SURROUND SOUND.	St
1.6.1	http://www.pricewatch.com/gallery/sound_cards/5.1_channel It's not called composite audio, it's multi-channel audio.	St
1.7.1	http://www.mwave.com/mwave/skusearch_v3.asp?scriteria=BA32238	St
1.8.1	My understand of a COMPOSITE connections are one video and one stereo.	St
