Proffitt	6/6/12 9:50 AM	1.3389762E12	After reading the review, found no reason to get excited.	http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/a10-4600m-trinity-piledriver,3202.html I read there are demo units out there but what happens next is well known. Are you aware how this works? What happens next? Bob

Looking good and the other feature are matching to what I m looking for...I might go for that... Bob, what you mean when you say what happens next ?

I see Tomshardware did check it out but again, can't find any compelling reason over other solutions. But, there are folk that want the latest. They'll ask when the iPhone 5 will be out but as soon as that shows up, they will hold off and ask when the iPhone 6 will arrive. Bob

I have brought the MC101 from ARCTIC at the end, I got the full version with Trinity A10, it's excellent and I love it. Working great and its really small and good looking, fit in my living.
