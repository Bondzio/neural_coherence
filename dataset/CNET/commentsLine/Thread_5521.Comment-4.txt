there's nothing really wrong with the first psu except the pc designer must know if anything will come close to the 20 ampere mark.
why didn't i write 22 amperes?
because there must be some spare power since in just a year the aging of the psu will degrade the 22 to at least 20 amperes so we never want to run a psu at or near it's limits.
the single rail helps a new pc designer avoid the work.
