I have beeen looking at new routers like the Netgear N900 to increase my speed and throughput. I would then go from: modem&gt;router&gt;switch&gt;boxee(and other devices)&gt;tv I need the switch as I have other devices in my entertainment system that require internet access. My Question is even if I buy a superfast router ,will my through put be limited by the switch?? Thanks Robert

I will use cable from the new router to the switch and then cable to my network devices such as the Boxee. My current problem is that I get constant buffering when trying to stream from the internet. I was originally wi-fi and then ran a cable directly from my D-link 615 router but there were no improvments... That's why I figured that a new(faster) router might help ?

There are some things you can try NOW such as router defaults except what the ISP requires as well as turning off wifi for a test run. I don't see the rest of the system and other details to note if it's the old Netflix at 6PM issue. Bob

It is a constant problem, not time of day related.. When you say &quot;that 615&quot; is that a bad thing?? ps thanks for the fast replys!!! If you were buying a switch, what would you choose for this application?

Try this on youtube or better sites. You should find the lesser known video sites to struggle to keep up with demand. Bob
