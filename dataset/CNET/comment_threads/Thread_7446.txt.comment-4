Remember that axiom!.
I've seen plenty of &quot;cheap&quot; tablets advertised in drugstore circulars and if you look at reviews by people who bought them, they'd be dead upon getting, or within 6 months.
Save your pennies and get a name brand product with trusted support.
Apple iPod Touch or Amazon Fire for $200 are best choices now.
