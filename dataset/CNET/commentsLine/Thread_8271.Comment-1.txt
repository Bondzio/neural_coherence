hello, first time poster here.
hopefully someone can help us.
first my husband tried to install my old harddrive from an older computer into my newer computer.
we had everything shut off, touched the chasis so it would get rid of any static.
he had to take the video card out of the motherboard in order to fit the 2nd harddrive in the computer.
he didn't set the 2nd drive as a slave because he thought he could do that at the bios screen.
after everything was screwed in securely, he put the video card back in and put the cover back on the tower.
plugged everything up, the fans were going, lights were going on the tower but we have no video.
we thought maybe it was the monitor, but we hooked it up to a working computer and the monitor checks out ok. so we turned the computer off, opened the chasis, took the video card out and made sure no dust was in the video card slot.
we even took out the second harddrive incase it was conflicting.
we put the video card back, the chasis back on the tower and plugged everything back up.
we still get no video.
now after the frustration of that, we tried hooking my harddrive up to his computer and it now has an error on it from all the shutdowns.
that is another thing that is frustrating us but that's another post.
we really need some help.
i really can't afford another computer nor right now someone to fix it.
i would greatly appreciate any help in this matter and would name my first born son or daughter after the person that can give us the resolution.
