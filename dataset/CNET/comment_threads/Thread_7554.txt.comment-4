Since all I have to work with is your words and I don't see a plan of the network I'll pick your words as follows.
&quot;everything is wired now if there are two wifi networks can i connect them as a single network by any hardware?&quot; Let's disict this.
If so we have a LAN (that's the wired part) and on 2 locations we have a WAP.
Ipso facto these WAPs on on the same LAN and as such don't need any additional hardware.
