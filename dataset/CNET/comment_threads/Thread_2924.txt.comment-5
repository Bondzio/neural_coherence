I got the free upgrade and attempted to install it... big failure.
First i downloaded Vista Upgrade Advisor and removed like half the programs on my computer that were causing compatibility issues.
Next i started to install it; i got about 3/4 the way done and then it stopped with a message telling me to install upgrade advisor and fix compatibility issues... which i already did.
Upgrade advisor said everything was correct so i tried again and got the same problem...
So i said the heck with it and tossed it...
So in the end i lost like half of my programs and documents and still have XP.
Pissed the hell outta me!
