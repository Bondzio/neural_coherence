I've been researching different tablets for enjoying media/social networking and I was originally only looking to pay 200 for a tablet.
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;After learning more, I understand that price is definatley a factor in production value, survivabilty, and usability.So now I'm looking for the best that I can &lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I need something that will last me a while I would appreciate is if it had could fuction as a Calendar, To Do List, Skype, and use Internet.
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I live in the USA
