Well i know basics but i havent kept up with any hardware stuff since i got my p3 450 like 5 years ago. This is what i came up with checking some stuff out today. Basically looked all over newegg for cheap stuff that seamed like what i wanted, that had good reviews. I think everything will work together but like i said in part one.. AMD Athlon XP 2500+ &quot;barton&quot; 333FSB, 512 cache ASRock &quot;K7S8XE&quot; SiS748 Chipset Motherboard for AMD Socket A CPU Crucial 184 Pin 512MB DDR PC-2700 Maxtor 160GB 7200RPM IDE Hard Drive, Model 6Y160P0, OEM Lite-On Black 48X24X48X16 Combo Drive, Model LTC48161H BK, OEM SONY Black 1.44MB 3.5inch Floppy Disk Drive, Model MPF920, OEM ASPIRE Turbo Case X-Dreamer Black Mid-Tower Case with 350W Power Supply, Model &quot;ATXB3KLW/350W&quot; ATI AIW RADEON 9600 Video Card, 128MB DDR, 128-bit, CATV/Video Out/Video In, 8X AGP, Model &quot;ALL-IN-WONDER 9600&quot; w/ REMOTE -RETAIL So, thoughts? Comments? Suggestions? I'm deffinately on a budget and the $601 this comes out to is barely doable. If you know of better for less lemme know.

Read http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/ And why you need MORE than that rating? (Hint, try 450 Watts!) is at http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/ About that OEM CDRW. Some get BURNED UP they didn't get CD recording software. And others fry as they find out what came with the old CDRW doesn't work with the new drive. Bob

My dad could probably use the 350W that comes with the case, his athlon is running on a 250 right now. I guess with the CDRW you're pointing out it doesnt come with anything? I can handle that, i just want to make sure all this stuff works together right and it isnt junk (mainly the m/b).
