i am about to build my first pc (attempt really but being positive) and wanted to get some feedback on what i have came up with so far.
i am working with a limited budget and chose my components based on being able to add &quot;more&quot; later when money is not so tight.
basically i am going for a mid-low high end gaming pc that has some customization options for the future.
motherboard and cpu -  memory -  hdd - also use a 500gb ext.
for media  cd/dvd -  power supply - i am curious about this one and what you all would suggest.
since i wasn't sure i made room for a 750w power supply.
case -  video cards (to be added later) -  i plan on using vista 64-bit to take advantage of the 4gb + memory.
from what i understand 32 only uses 3gb and recognizes the other 1gb as &quot;virtual memory&quot; if i have this fouled up please explain.
also since i fully plan to upgrade later to the full 8gb that the mobo allows it seemed like the best choice.
ok so let her rip and let me hear it, have i covered everything?
would you make different choices and if so why?
i appreciate any and all help in this matter since i am very excited at the prospect of building my first &quot;rig&quot;, and am somewhat anxious to get underway with the contruction.
