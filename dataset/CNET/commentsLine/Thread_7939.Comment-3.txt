now that is crazy.
i haven't had to do restore for a very long time.
went to system restore and to click on a restore date.
there are no dates showing.
the &quot;calendar&quot; is blank.
as for the drivers i only checked to see if they were all up to date and they were.
what would cause this issue with system restore?
going to check the bios settings now.
