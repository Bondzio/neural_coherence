the worst part about the lacie failures is the attitide at lacie.
it starts with techs that seem tp know less than the usual uninformed tech and continues right through the possibility of returning the drive.
the failure happens early in the warranty and it takes many months of haphazard advice until return seems the only option.
the time spent trying to get this done added to more time salvaging data puts you over the one year since date of purchase and that is the end.
never mind that your discussion and original complaints were well within the one year.
you listened to tech support and dawdled in doing so and therefore tough luck becuase they won't even repair it at that point.
however, that may be just as well because i would not be able to use any lacie drive even if free after having the double failure.
i could never feel any data was safe on the lacie, repaired or not.
