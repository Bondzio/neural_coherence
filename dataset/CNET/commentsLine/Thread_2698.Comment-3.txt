i use it for my digital camcorder when i record things to the computer.
that works.
i found a way to get this hdd formatted... the thing is: it freezes every time while formatting.
this is an image of the formatting.
note that i was doing this at almost 4:00am.
i left it on all night and at the moment it is still at the same stage.
nothing has changed.....
