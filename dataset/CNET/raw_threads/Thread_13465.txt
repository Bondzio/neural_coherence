Reasons: *I'm not old...that's my story and I'm sticken to it. *I thought that an ''Eyetoy'' was some electronic toy that fit over your eye. *Since I didn't know what it was, the lack of said knowledge isn't a qualification for being old. *Anyone who disagrees with this logic should remember not to disagree with his/her elders. Anyhow, after a little research, I found that the ''Eyetoy is a simple, intuitive and fun way to control and interact with gaes and friends.'' Basicly, it a webcam for the Playstation that works with various interactive games. For PS3fan: There are currently two replies to your three posts in the Playstation forums which indicate that although you cannot use the Eyetoy on the playstation without the appropriate games/software, you can download drivers that enable to use it as a webcam on your PC. Thus, using this method, you should be able to see yourself on your computer monitor (or output the image to your TV) for fun. Hope this helps, John
