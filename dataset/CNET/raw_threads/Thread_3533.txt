I checked my cables and ensured that everything was plugged in. I checked the sound controls and made sure that nothing was muted. None of my setting had changed. I normally listen to music and such on a daily basis, so I know the sound had been functioning just recently. I uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers. I Googled for solutions. I'm completely bewildered. I should add that the hissing noise only occurs when there would normally be sound. If I turn up the volume on my speakers the hissing gets louder. HOWEVER, if I reduce the sound through the software, the hissing remains at the level set by my speakers. Anyone have any ideas?

If not, then very possible the audio portion just got blown away, it happens. See, if using plain 2:1 audio works or similar. if you have a testing pgm. as some audio pgms. do, use it. Even though you checked the cabling, has anyone else been at work? Also, verify the cabling again. Try the speakers elsewhere is possible. As for the audio ckt. check the mtrbd./card in the areas in question for burnt or obvious damage. tada -----Willy

Also I am the only on who uses this computer and the cabling is relatively difficult to accidentally move. I do not see any burnt areas on the motherboard. Audio test programs hiss at me. I don't know what you mean by 2:1 audio, honestly, I'm not really a sound guy. Can you explain?

I am using an Asus M2N-SLi motherboard and connected to the onboard audio. Have done all the usual stuff (uninstalling and reinstalling the usb audio device, updated drivers, tried reinstalling from Asus installation disc) even though there is no problem with the device showing in device manager. Can I add a new sound card to the motherboard or do I have to buy and fit a replacement motherboard as I am using the onboard audio?? All help appreciated.
