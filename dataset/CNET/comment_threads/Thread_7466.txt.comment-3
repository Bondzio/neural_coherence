Well, you might say so.
The AMD Athlon XP 3000 at 2.167GHz came out around February 2003 and would out perform the Pent 4, 2.20GHz in gaming.
Pentium 4 (Intel) doesn't have a model 3000 as it list theirs in processor speed by GHz.
They recently changed to show a 5xx model number that easily converts to GHz.
