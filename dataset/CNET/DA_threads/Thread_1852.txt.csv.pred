1.1.6	would their computers have left some sort of &quot;stamp&quot; or something on the hard drive that would have been left over on my computer after I last connected the hard drive to mine?	St
1.1.7	I'm running Lion and the other people would probably have been on Snow Leopard.	St
1.1.8	But the problem is the hard drive with the files broke and is now gone...so if someone used my hard drive, and then I plugged it into my laptop before it broke, would there be any information on my laptop that would tell where else that past connected drive had been?	St
