So, it seems I wasted my money on the dual band capability - although in all the reviews I read about this router, NONE of them mentioned the compatibility of the network adapter.
Two of my laptops, however, are 802.11n and say &quot;dual band&quot; - however, I can't get either of them to recognize the 5 Ghz range either.
