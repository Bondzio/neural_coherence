<s> I have recently reinstalled Windows XP on an HP computer which has the 9 in 1 card reader built in. </s>
<s> My problem is that now when I go to 'my computer' instead of having the drive names all that they say is removable disk. </s>
<s> I am sure all I need is the drivers but I check at HP and could not find them for the HP pavilion a523x. </s>
<s> thanks for you help. </s>
