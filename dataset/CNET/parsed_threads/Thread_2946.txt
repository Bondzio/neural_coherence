<s> i am currently using a 200 gig ata drive running office xp 2003. i want to add a new 80 gig ata drive for strickly game use.i have 512 memory and a 2.8 intel 4 processor and mother board. </s>
<s> can some one please tell me the best way to set up the new drive so that i can still maintain maximum speed and performance with 2 drives. </s>
<s> do i need a raid drive or what ?? </s>
<s> if so how do i configure one thanks </s>
<s> As to installing the drive, it's no different than any other drive and you follow the makers install instructions. </s>
<s> If you don't then you have your reasons why. </s>
<s> As to RAID, that is again where you get a RAID controller and follow the instructions. </s>
<s> Worth noting is that with just a 200GB and one 80GB drive, you don't have enough drives to make a RAID setup. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> There is no reason adding a second drive would slow either one down, as long as you jumper the drive correctly (probably both will be jumpered CS) then it will use UDMA 5 and you will get optimal performance. </s>
<s> To use RAID you need to have identical size drives. </s>
<s> To use RAID 0 you need to start with 2 new drives and build the OS from the beginning, you can't just add a 2nd drive and RAID them together. </s>
<s> If you use RAID 0 and either drive dies you lose all data on both drives. </s>
<s> I have to make some assumptions here: 1. </s>
<s> That your C drive is on the primary master. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> That you have a primary slave drive on the same IDE. </s>
<s> If you want to put an 80gb hard drive as a secondary slave on your ATA you should have no problems in doing so. </s>
<s> Just install the game on this drive. </s>
<s> Keep in mind that no matter what drive you install the game on some system files needed will be stored on your C drive. </s>
<s> Also make sure that this drive is the same speed as your 200gb hard drive. </s>
<s> Most are 7200 RPM these days. </s>
<s> You should not really notice any performance degradation in setting it up this way. </s>
<s> You don't really need to set up a RAID array for this. </s>
<s> If you did, you would need to have another 200gb hard drive to do so. </s>
<s> I tend to setup dual drives as primary on each IDE / ATA port, with CD drives and DVD's as secondary. </s>
<s> This maximizes transfers from the hard drives. </s>
<s> This is especially true if you are doing a lot of disk access or program swapping due to low memory. </s>
<s> If however your games etc. </s>
<s> require the CD or DVD to be online, then hook the two hard drives up on the same port and your CD and DVD drives on the other. </s>
<s> Same reason, so that you are not constantly swapping between the CD and a hard drive on the same port. </s>
