Sounds like every thing is working OK and you could add another SATA drive...CD-DVD or HDD, if desired.
Re the BIOS and replacing or adding...right.
No need to change the BIOS if you're just replacing an old or failed drive.
VAPCMD PS...Just make sure you keep the dust bunnies out of the case...they easily clog the case fans and PSU fan as well as the CPU heatsink and fan.
