You lead with prices for the playbook in your post and then ask which is odd. But your questions are the same as others that want a PC/laptop and try to get a tablet then in a short while discover they need the PC to load or configure or do what they wanted in the first place. If you don't have a PC you will learn why folk warned you later. Bob
