Your opinion please.
I bought my Dell 4550 series in 2002 and I'm in need of upgrading it or buying a new one.
What do you think is the best thing to do?
The specs are: Intel Pentium 4 Process at 2.0 GHZ, 256 DDR SDRAM at 266MHz, 30GB ultra ATA/ 100 Hard Drive 7200RPM.
I use it for basic college work, downloading music (have maybe 600 songs & download 10/ per month), take plenty of pics and I'm looking into editing and maybe getting a camcorder to play with a maybe edit.
In the next two years I will also be using in the field of elementary education as a teacher.
Thanks for your ideas!
