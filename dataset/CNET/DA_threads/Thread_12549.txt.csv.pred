1.1.1	Hey guys first post and it 'd be awesome if I got some help .	St
1.1.2	I 'll try explaining in steps what the problem is .	St
1.1.3	-Playstation 3 got the yellow light of death ( seems to be an overheating issues ) -I called Sony and they would send me a box but I need to get all my save files off my hard drive as I have some games with upto 80 hours on there .	St
1.1.4	( Yes I know I 'm an idiot for not backing up recently I already beat myself up for that ) -I bought a Usb to Ide/Sata adapter to try and get the data off -To get the drive to recognize I had to partition and format ( Really stupid of me I think ) -Nothing was on the drive when it finally did get recognized -I used EASEUS Data Recovery Wizard Professional 4.3.6 to try and get the data off but all I got was .gzip ( 17.5 gigs ) files .	St
1.1.5	-Also , if you 're wondering why I did n't just keep the drive and send the ps3 to sony .	St
1.1.6	Sony would send me a refurb unit and with the ps3 it asks you to reformat once you put a drive into the console that it was n't originally on ( same problem if I just took the hdd and put it into a friends ps3 to get data off ) Is there anything at all I can do to try and get my files off that hard drive ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thank you so much for your help = (	St
1.2.1	Since the drive was formatted I 'd keep the gzip files , ship the beast off to Sony and when it comes back hook it up and use Linux to see the drive ( Windows does n't without a lot of help ) and put your gzip files into the directory you find said files .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Is there anyway I could open those gzip files to see if my saves are in there ?	Ques
1.3.2	I 'm not really familiar with it .	St
1.4.1	You got the files out .	St
1.4.2	The PS3 may store games in gzips and we do n't want to further corrupt these files .	St
1.5.1	The box should be here by tomorrow so the only hope I now have left is that my game saves are in those 17.5gigs of gzip files .	St
1.5.2	I 'm not familiar with linux at all so how would I install it onto the ps3 and what would I do with the files ?	Ques
1.6.1	Put the files back to where you found them .	St
1.7.1	Not much else I can do It 's been dead for nearly 13 days now and I did n't really find a solution .	St
1.7.2	All those hours gone to waste should 've backed up .	St
1.7.3	& gt ; _ & lt ; Anyways , thanks for the help .	Polite
