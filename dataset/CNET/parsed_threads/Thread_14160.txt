<s> When my son's computer is turned on from a Cold Boot, I get the message in the subject line above. </s>
<s> I can press F1 and it will boot just fine, the computer works fine, with no problems. </s>
<s> Each time it is cold booted, however, we get the above message. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> You may want to check in the BIOS settings to see if the SMART for HDD's is enabled. </s>
<s> If it is, it has correctly reported that some areas of the disc are corrupted. </s>
<s> If ScanDisc, or another comperable program are available, you need to run a thorough scan of the surface area. </s>
<s> be prepared as this may take many hours. </s>
<s> If it does find bad sectors, it will wall tham off so that no data can be written to them .In any case, start backing up data imeediately, and shop for a new HDD. </s>
<s> Nowadays disc drives can be had for cheap, and this may save a load of aggrivation in the long run. </s>
<s> well its telling you that its gonna fail and as its anytime save save now because you only lose whats impossible to replace. </s>
<s> as bob proffit says and i agree a hard drives only temp storage place </s>
<s> While you're at it take a look inside the box and see what brand of hard drive you have. </s>
<s> If you have a custom built computer with a good hard drive it may have a 3 year warranty on it and manufacturers such as Western Digital will have the warranty expiration date for the drive you have on file. </s>
<s> All you have to do is go online and tell them the serial number. </s>
<s> If you have a el-cheapo PC like the ones they sell at large retail stores you will probably be out of luck. </s>
<s> Good luck </s>
<s> Lucky for you to receive that message, other's don't, hence, they panic when their HDDs bog down and they were not able to back-up their files. </s>
<s> Do back-up your files while you still have the time, don't wait for your HDD to falter. </s>
<s> We all know that electronic parts however high quality made they are have a lifetime. </s>
<s> One reason why computer parts' costs had gone down is not because of over supply (the demand is real high - law of supply and demand) nor because of competition or cheaper production cost, but they do have shorter life span nowadays. </s>
