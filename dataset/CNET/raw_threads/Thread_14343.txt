Just like the title says, i'm looking for a solution to hook up a plasma tv in a conference room to a computer that is located over 100ft away. The computer has dvi output but i have no idea if they make a cable long enough let alone without dropping signal. Is there a special converter box i can use to make it a composite signal?

Sure, try the 100 foot cable but frankly it fails most of the time. Bob
