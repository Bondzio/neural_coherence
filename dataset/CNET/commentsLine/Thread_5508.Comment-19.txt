hi virginia, i use external hard drives but being a bit paranoid, i have the data on each of three!
i did have a disk go bad with a corrupt partition table.
eventually, partition table doctor (google it, somewhere in taiwan) fixed the disk up long enough to copy it, wipe it and discard it.
there is a trial version before you buy, scans the disk and tells you what it can find - if it looks god, buy it to lock the fix in.
but one method that did work for me on the data (and to be honest, i can't think of a reason why it did!)
was to run a knoppix live cd linux system on my pc, plug the drive in and knoppix found the data, which i was able to copy back to the system drive.
since you can download knoppix for free, it's worth a try.
you don't really need to know any linux if you use the gui but you might like it!
the other suggestins in the thread are good, i guess you've tried them before you got this far.
if you have, still without success, it might be worth giving kroll-ontrack a call.
they have a presence in the usa and uk and other places.
they are a professional data recovery outfit and i warn you, not cheap but with the data you are trying to retrieve, you might consider it worth it.
but on the initial call, they will discuss your problem and offer advice on what to do next (which may be just to send the disk to them).
from other posts in the thread, it sound like this may be a common problem, which they will have seen before.
good luck and fingers crossed!
