Also if that is feasible am I putting data RF out? Do you see what I am asking? Wireless routers are prevelant, but I would still use the router as a wired PC. rbul1@sbcglobal.net

In addition to disabling the SSID broadcast, there is a setting on the WRT54G and WRT54GS to disable the wireless portion of the router (set Wireless Network Mode to ''Disabled''). The firmware versions I have encountered for the WRT54GC do not have the ability to disable its wireless network. If I needed to disallow all wireless connections, I probably would enable MAC address filtering but permit no MAC addresses to connect. I also would enable encryption and disable the SSID broadcast. Hmmm...I guess I could also place the router in heavy 2.4GHz interference/blocking areas.
