We were going to buy towers and a server but I am hearing conflicting info about what we really need. I am not sure we want to host our emails, fire wall and domain because I now nada about that so if something failed I would have to call someone for support. So now I am doing research on NAS and file servers. We do all of our website maintenance, collateral material and artwork. We don't necessarily need to access (MS Exchange) our computers away from the office (other software out there than can do that). Can someone tell me the pros and cons of server vs NAS for a small business? Thank you.

However, you limited in expansion, up to a point. Any decent system can have the NAS added, as for any true server needs, then you must look at the whole system to match what you want to do. You can look at some outside network service and allow them to host you and your cause. That way, the expertise is on their end and all you provide is the content. Of course this costs, but it doesn't hurt to see what it involves. good luck -----Willy
