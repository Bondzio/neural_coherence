Does anyone know of a way to make color corrections using the Photosmart 8250?
I have read the brief manual, gone through the HP imaging software, and tried every way I can think of to correct the extreme amount of magenta the printer is using for photos.
This problem is especially bad with flesh tones--they come out a bright pink.
While I can &quot;guess&quot; and make changes with Photoshop for each image, life would be better if I could adjust the printer settings to more accurately match the computer screen.
How did the CNET editor--who gave the 8250 a 7.4--miss this??
It's a major problem.
I'm beginning to think there is no way to make color corrections with the printer--I want my Epson Stylus back!
Thanks for any suggestions!
