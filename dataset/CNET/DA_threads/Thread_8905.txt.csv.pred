1.1.2	Does anyone have any suggestions of a reliable and efficient printer that fits that bill and one that has very good print quality?	Polite
1.1.3	thanks,	St
1.2.1	HP makes a couple but the one that seems to work quite well and is a bit smaller plus has bluetooth capability is the Canon 100 series.	St
