1.1.1	I am using a 10 year old gateway 2000 for a carputer .	St
1.1.2	It only has 130mhz processor speed and 64 mb or ram .	St
1.1.3	I have no idea of anything else about the computer .	St
1.1.4	I am trying to install 2 hard drives in the computer .	St
1.1.5	Both have correct jumper set up .	St
1.1.6	One is master and the other is slave .	St
1.1.7	The computer boots up and shows the hard drives in the start up but when I go into the system setup it shows the drives as d : and e : .	St
1.1.8	I want them to be c : and d : .	St
1.1.9	It also will not let me format the drives or recognize them when I try to partition them .	Sug
1.1.10	Any help would be greatly apprecited .	St
1.2.1	These old machines had limits to what drives they identify .	St
1.2.2	Details were missing from your post , but at the 133MHz area , I ran in problems even at the 8GB mark .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Sounds like a WIN95 machine.. in which case.. its probably not worth upgrading .	St
1.3.2	Even a 98se machine is going to have problems with increased hardware on this chasis .	St
1.4.1	I am installing a 8gb and a 2gb .	St
1.4.2	The 8 gb was in there already .	St
1.4.3	I am replacing the original 1 gb with the 2gb .	St
1.4.4	I am planning on running win95 because thats all that I have laying around .	St
1.4.5	But it did already have win 98 before I started .	St
1.5.1	Just need a topic ...	St
1.5.2	Such old drives may have ODD ( to today 's users ) jumper methods .	St
1.5.3	Some drives had a SLAVE PRESENT jumper .	St
1.5.4	But without exacting details I ca n't guess you missed the jumpers or what type IDE cable you used .	St
1.5.5	Then again , the 2GB drive could be dead .	St
1.5.6	It is certainly past the 5 year mark .	St
1.5.7	Bob	St
