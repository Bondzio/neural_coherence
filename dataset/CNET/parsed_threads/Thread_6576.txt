<s> I have just installed the DI-624 to set up my wireless network at home. </s>
<s> I followed the instructions, changed the SSID, changed the admin password, and enabled WEP 128bit encryption with a random key. </s>
<s> (I was going to use WPA, but my laptop does not accept WPA, so I am using WEP.) </s>
<s> My landline computer has Internet Security with firewall enabled and Internet virus scan. </s>
<s> First, is there an easy way to test to see if I have adequately protected my wireless network so that no one can use my network or gain access to my home computer? </s>
<s> Second, I haven't figured out how to properly set up the firewall on the DI-624 itself. </s>
<s> Is this necessary or is having the firewall on my computer sufficient. </s>
<s> I'm a newbie at the whole wireless realm, so any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> You have changed the SSID and set the encryption which is good. </s>
<s> Take it a step further and stop the SSID from broadcasting which will stop anyone from knowing that you have a wireless network setup. </s>
<s> It should be a simple matter of choosing enable/disable from the online setup. </s>
<s> You did not say if you are using a wireless card or built in one in the laptop. </s>
<s> If its a card then on it you should see MAC and then a mix of #'s and letters. </s>
<s> With it you can enable Mac filtering using the interface which will only allow that card to interact with the router wirelessly. </s>
<s> To test ask a friend with a laptop to try and use your network and if you did it correctly they will not even be able to find it in a search. </s>
<s> As for the firewall it putting a wall before the one on your computer, good but not something worry about. </s>
<s> Just use D-link online support for help in setting it up. </s>
<s> Sorry could not give exact info as I have not use D-Link but the info is general for all of the big makers of routers as they all offer the same things now. </s>
<s> Someone else may be able to give exact info. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Try to log into the network without entering the proper WEP password. </s>
<s> If you can't then it is working. </s>
<s> Note: If you logged in at least one time already and the wireless connection utility saved the password in the properties of a ''Preferred Network,'' the you will not be prompted for the password until you change the password on the router or ''Remove'' the Preferred Neteork from your list. </s>
<s> Check the router manual to see if it can provide the added protection of some sort of MAC filtering. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Router firewall should automatically be on. </s>
<s> Read more about this in the router manual. </s>
<s> Be safer--use the router firewall and at most one software firewall on each computer. </s>
<s> My rule is always to have firewall, antivirus, and more than one antispyware program on each computer at all times. </s>
<s> Thanks to both people responding. </s>
<s> I have incorporated all suggestions and it appears to be working well. </s>
<s> Cheers! </s>
