What self test?
It keeps blinking so comunication can not be established with the printer.
And what cartridge are they talking about anyway?
And sinse I'm going shopping what HP is ok.
Same style like HP-5440 the lady onn the phone was offering.
All those kind will never last me more than 3 years?
Or is there 1 that can last me 10 years or more?
Thanks, Confusimo
