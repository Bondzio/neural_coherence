Hello, I am looking for a washable, flexible, 109-key, USB full sized keyboard with, preferably, normal placement of the arrow keys, an enter key that is of a decent size (and is the backwards L type), a full sized backspace key, the full top row of f# keys, etc. etc. I don't know which brand of &quot;Flexible and Washable&quot; keyboards to get, or which model to get if I *do* decide. Has anyone done a comparison of any of the keyboards from Seal Shield, Tripp Lite, Adesso, Grandtec, True Touch, Modtek, Targus, etc.? Also, how can I figure out if one of these is just a rebranded version of another? Which of these companies is still alive and supporting their product? Do any of these keyboards have anything physically different with the f and j keys, to find the home keys by touch? If so, which? Which brands have the lowest incidents of stuck keys for their latest models? I am in the States, and would like to pay under $40 for a keyboard (these seem to be relatively inexpensive, which does help!), and I don't know what to get. Any help would be appreciated!

Does anyone have any thoughts on any of them, or any comparisons?

Pre-script: I took the liberty to clean up the detour. http://www.neoseeker.com/forums/6/t1176122-flexible-rugged-keyboards-seal-shield-tripp-lite-adesso-grandtec-true-touch-etc/ The Tripp Lite IN3009KP is a no hitter. Adesso, Targus are still in business. The others I'm not so sure of. Bob
