1.1.1	I 'd like some suggestions as to what a decent PC for various video operations would be .	St
1.1.2	For example : Capturing & processing video with a PCI PVR card .	St
1.1.3	Ripping & processing & burning DVD video .	St
1.1.4	Price is flexible , but I am interested in best bang for my buck This will be a dedicated unit that sits down by the home theater .	St
1.1.5	I 'm even open to building it myself .	St
1.1.6	Although I 've never built one before , I have a BS in EE & I work full time as an embedded software engineer .	St
1.2.1	And ended up with some refurb RCA Scenium DVR as well as a DVD-Recorder .	St
1.2.2	It 's working fine .	St
1.2.3	My dad opted for a refurb Windows XP Media Center .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	That does n't mean a lot to me .	St
1.3.2	I am interested in what you guys would buy & put together for a PC .	St
1.3.3	What kind of board ?	Ques
1.3.4	Which processor ?	Ques
1.3.5	I plan on tons of RAM & perhaps some raid array drives for faster hard-disk performance .	St
1.4.1	I found it to require a 2+GHz P4 and preferably some HT CPU or 64-bitter .	St
1.4.2	The big problem was not the & quot ; raid array & quot ; or disk speed , but just the overwhelming amount of data the CPU has to crunch .	St
1.4.3	The 4400 RPM DRIVE was the best solution to cut down on noise coming from the PC in the video room .	St
1.4.4	I 'm sharing that while SNAPSTREAM is very nice , you may want to just go with a ready to use solution ( much cheaper ! )	St
1.4.5	than build your own or something like - & gt ; http : //www.geeks.com/details.asp ? invtid=PJ473AAR which my dad purchased and has been enjoying for over a month now .	St
1.4.6	My SCENIUM was a refurb at 139 bucks and the DVD recorder is the APTEK for 129 bucks and both are doing fine .	St
1.4.7	I also have the DLINK MEDIA CENTER like you see at http : //www.dlink.com/products/ ? pid=318 and it has the benefit of being very quiet while letting me put all the media collection somewhere else in the house .	St
1.4.8	Bob	St
1.5.1	That media center looks like a great deal .	Polite
1.5.2	thanks ! ! !	Polite
1.5.3	I will try & read some reviews about it & see if it has any faults	Sug
1.6.1	It 's a little slow on the menus .	St
1.6.2	In fact , I 'd say it needs to get about 1/2 the time to display stuff for me to never note it as a nuisance .	St
1.6.3	The other gotcha is that Dlink does n't reveal how to encode video for playback .	St
1.6.4	I 've had to use the old trial and error method and still have n't nailed it .	St
1.6.5	I 'd try another Media Center like that when I can this year , but for now its working .	St
1.6.6	Bob	St
1.7.1	One thing I would consider is what do I want to do with this system in the future .	St
1.7.2	In reading reviews and doing comparisions look at the expandability of the case and memory in relation to what you may want to do and is this power supply really adequate ?	Ques
1.8.1	There is no expansion available for RAM and the power supply seems just fine .	St
1.8.2	Just wondering if you were talking about some other device and if so , be sure to respond to the post about it or note it in your posting .	St
1.8.3	Bob	St
1.9.1	I meant that I was interested in the HP MEDIA CENTER 2005 .	St
1.9.2	I definitely want a comp , even though the other device is nice & cheap .	St
1.9.3	I would n't mind paying twice as much though , but the question is ... what kind of increase in performance & capability will I be able to acheive for an extra $ 800 ?	Ques
