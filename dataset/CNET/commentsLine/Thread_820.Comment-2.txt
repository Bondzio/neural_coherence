when the print queue is &quot;stopped&quot; all that needs to be done is to &quot;start&quot; it again.
on the menubar or the icon bar of the printer window.
occasionally, you will find a document that the printer just gives up on.
at that point it stops the queue.
deleting the offending document and restarting the queue usually works.
this is probably not the problem in your case.
