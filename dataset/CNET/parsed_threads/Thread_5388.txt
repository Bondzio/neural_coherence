<s> Hey all, I'm going on clinical rotations and need to store my desktop for a year...any suggestions? </s>
<s> It's an old Dell 4100 running ME. </s>
<s> I don't know if I have time to back up all the files I'm interested in... </s>
<s> If you have no time to even store the &quot;important data&quot; what good is trying to store the system. </s>
<s> Basically, if storage fails for some reason, then data is gone. </s>
<s> Always think data first, then the h/w.. </s>
<s> I suggest you wrap in orginal packing if available. </s>
<s> If not, then a simple double bagging in plastic bags will do fine then store in closet. </s>
<s> If you have access to descentant, use some. </s>
<s> All this depends on the condition/enviroment of area of storage. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> is to buy an external hard drive caseing and scrap your hard drive and make it an external. </s>
<s> that way any important files you can take with you with out worrying too much about it going bad collecting dust. </s>
<s> Then with the rest of your desktop you can store in a dumpster or local recycleing center. </s>
<s> or donate it for a tax break. </s>
<s> or go office space on it's ass!! </s>
<s> the possibilities are endless! </s>
