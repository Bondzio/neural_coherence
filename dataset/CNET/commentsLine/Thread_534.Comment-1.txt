i have a dell desktop with segate 80g hd running xp.
i bought wd 320g hd.
i installed it as a slave using cable select so i could copy everything over from old drive.
when i ran software (data lifeguard) it asked to copy old drive and make new one boot drive said yes after hours of copying seemed like everything was fine but it doesen't boot off new drive.
if i take out old drive and use new one as solo drive it doesn't recognize drive and looks for other bootable drive.
with both drives in device manager show it healthy active and the old drive as healthy system.
any ideas how to make the new one system?
