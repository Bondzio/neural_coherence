thanks for your input.
did a little research on some of the reccomendations let me know what you think.
asus a8v socket 939 viak8t800 pro atx agp 8x 1000mhz hyper transport w/up to 4gigs of ddr400.
amd atholon 64 3200+ winchester integrated into chip fsb 512 kb l2 cache.
thermaltake cl-p0075 to cool it down and 1 gig of corsair xms twinx1024-3200c2pt memory.
i do have a slight budget so this would be for starters.
could you reccomend a quality 500watt power supply and a good video card.
