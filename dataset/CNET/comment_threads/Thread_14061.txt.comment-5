Hi Bob I'm only using LAN/Ethernet ports, at this moment I'm able to assign a secundary IP (192.168.10.1/24) to them, and keep the old sagem f@st with the 192.168.1.1/24, but if I change my PC IP to 192.168.10.10/24 I can ping the sagem, but can't access the internet.
The only way that can access the internet is keeping my PC Ethernet port in the 192.168.1.0/24 sub-net.
I don't know if this is a windows miss configuration or a bad router configuration.
My words and explanations, sometimes, may be lacking precision, that is because I'm just starting in the network field (studying) .
For example, I'm having a hard time to understand was does the option &quot;Enable Ethernet M2U &quot; Best regards Vasco
