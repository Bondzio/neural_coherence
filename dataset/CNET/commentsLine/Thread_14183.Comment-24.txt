it was an apple iie in an elementary school computer lab in 1991- i primarily used print shop on it to make cards and drawings.
it had 2 floppy drives, a few kb of ram and that was about it.
the first computers i owned were a 1996 panasonic toughbook cf-25 and a 1992 tandy 2500sx/20, which were decent machines for their respective time periods.
the tandy was obtained in 1999, the toughbook was obtained in 2001, as my first desktop and notebook, respectively.
