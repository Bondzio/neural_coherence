1.1.6	I have heard it is easy to build your own computer.	St
1.1.7	I cannot afford to pay $2000+ for a system at this time, but think if I buy the components and make one myself, I can afford to do it.	St

1.3.8	For cost reasons I choose the AMD 64 vs the Intel chip.	St

1.3.10	I figured I could go with the 754 socket in the AMD 64 line and get a couple more years of service by up grading the CPU when the prices drop on the 3800+ versions.	St
