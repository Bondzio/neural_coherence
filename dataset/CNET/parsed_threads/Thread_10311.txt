<s> i have an airtel broadband connection in my 2 storey house . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> but it is at ground floor ( i can run only 1 pc at a time ) . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> so i wanted to intall a wireless connection over now( cos of laptop ) but i wanted it to be spread throughout the house . </s>

<s> intalling one router will cause problems due to concrete walls . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> therefore i was considering if their was any way i could install a router on each floor so that their is no problem in future . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> now i wanted to know whether it is possible through one connection .. </s>
<s> ?? </s>
<s> if yes then how . </s>

<s> if you have a better way plzz kindly let me know </s>
<s> While I didn't have any issue with our 2 storey, let's go with the story you could not get WiFi to the second floor. </s>
<s> How I solve that is with 2 more things. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> An AC Powerline Bridge (see amazon and google) 2. </s>
<s> A second router but configured as a WAP. </s>
<s> (see google for how to do that.) </s>
<s> This is just above beginner networking so you must be comfortable with this and researching it on google or have it done for you. </s>

<s> which router did you use for your 2 storey home </s>
<s> All have been netgear, dlink and linksys. </s>
<s> Why did I change? </s>
<s> Mostly as time passed I wanted to get 802.11n then the next one had OpenDNS support and so on. </s>
<s> All worked fine. </s>
