thanks for replying!
yes, we have found in the last few years of buying and having to replace throw-away printers, 2 hp photosmarts and 1 hp color deskjet - none of them at the low-end, but rather mid-range -that printers are not what they used to be.
before these three losers (all of which were replaced with equivalent new printers under warranty from best buy), we had a terrific hp photosmart which also looked like it lacked sturdiness compared to our old hp laser jet ii, laser jet iii (both donated to charities eventually) and the 10 year old laser jet 6l.
we are looking at the hp laser jet 2015. i'm not sure if it is business class.
however, buried away on hp's website is a chart showing discontinued printers and their &quot;replacements&quot;.
the hp 2015 is listed as the replacement for the hp laser jet 6 series.
so my previous choice of the 2015, after much research on many sites with consumer reviews, seems to be on target.
thanks for the tip on oki and lexmark.
i had heard that lexmark had deteriorated beyond the point of no return.
must have been bad sources of info.
i haven't heard anything in a long time about oki; wasn't sure they were still in business.
i have to say that none of the laser jets printers from any company which i have seen in person or online recently is attractive from an aesthetic point of view.
they are in fact quite ugly and unappealing.
we have a beautifully designed home office from where my partner runs her consulting practice.
the 6l, with its clean &quot;artsty&quot; lines and low profile fit right in and did not scream &quot;office&quot; and &quot;you're supposed to be working, not cruising cnet, ebay, or reading salon online!
