fans do tend to get noisy as they wear out.
if iot is loud or if you happen to break a blade while cleaning it is not a serious problem if you replace the fan.
case fans are very standard 60mm, 80mm, and 120mm with standard bolting paterns.
they are very inexpensive and very easy to replace.
some come with an extra lead for speed monitoring, but unless your computer is equiped for that don't bother.
you can install lighted fans to jazz up your computer, but the lights are not vey bright.
fans come in ball bearing, double ball bearing , and sleave bearing models.
i have never sen any real data to proove to me that any one type is better.
a more expensive fan might last a bit longer than a cheap one.
$8 to $18 should buy you a good fan.
$15 to $25 will get you one at your local parts store.
