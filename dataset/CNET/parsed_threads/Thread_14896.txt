<s> This is a system that I built myself 2 years ago. </s>
<s> I have upgraded a few things over time but never any problems. </s>
<s> I have the MSI K7T266 PRO2 ver2.0 motherboard with an AMD XP1800 processor. </s>
<s> Lately whenever I start it sometime the led just flashes once and it won't start. </s>
<s> If I turn the power off for 10 secs. </s>
<s> and then back on it starts fine. </s>
<s> But now it won't start at all. </s>
<s> Everytime I turn the power off and them back on the led will flash one time and all the fans including the cpu fan will start to spin and then nothing else. </s>
<s> I went ahead and replace the power supply but it still does the same. </s>
<s> Just looking for some possible input before I start buying more parts. </s>
<s> I was planning on upgrading the motherboard and processor anyway but I was going to use the ones i have now in my wifes computer to upgrade it. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help, Carl </s>
<s> I'm not a guru but it could be your temp sensor that the power supply uses to auto shutdown. </s>
<s> If your temp sensor has a break in the wire or a short it may be giving you a false overtemp. </s>
<s> Also, God forbide, your new supply could have been a lemon. </s>
<s> I havn't recieved much imput on this problem doesn't anyone have any ideas on this problem. </s>
<s> But the short version was to replace the most likely bad parts (and upsize the PSU along the way) from cheapest to more expensive. </s>
<s> We start with the minimum 450 Watt PSU, then the motherboard and finally the CPU. </s>
<s> But first you strip it down to just PSU, Motherboard and the power on switch to see if it powers up. </s>
<s> If it doesn't then you know its one of the two. </s>
<s> Then add the CPU/HSF and SPEAKER to see if it comes up and beeps. </s>
<s> Keep building... You have read the former discussions and know the bulging, leaking capacitors mean you replace that board. </s>
