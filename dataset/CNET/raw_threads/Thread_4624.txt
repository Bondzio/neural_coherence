Our historical society is publishing a photo-oriented history book using photos from individual's private -- and often family -- collection. What I am looking for is a high quality scanner that I can reasonably pack up and take to the contributor's home where I can scan the photos on site. Specs required for scans: 300 dpi Output size: at least 8 inches wide or 16 inches wide for a double spread. Color Mode: grayscale (8-bit) Recommendations? Thanks S

Either brand and others can be had for &lt;$100. By the way, scan black and white photos as full color, not greyscale, to get a good quality scan and be sure to save as TIF files. You may want to scan at 600dpi as well to get the best image.
