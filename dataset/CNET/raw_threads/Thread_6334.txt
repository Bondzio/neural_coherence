Now when I try to boot the system, it continually comes to the screen asking for boot type; Start normally, Safe Mode, Last known good config, etc. No matter which option I choose, the system restarts and returns to this screen. Any help will be greatly appreciated Thanks....JediChef

XP will not let you install a new MB an boot right away. This is it's behavior when it sees itself on a new PC. You will probably need to do a repair installation of the OS and reactivate it. A repair installation does not (usually) cause data loss. You also cannot just put the old MB back now to back things up. Go for the repair installation and reactivate the OS.
