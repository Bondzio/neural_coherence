These are the present specs: Operating System: Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit (6.1, Build 7601) Service Pack 1 (7601.win7sp1_gdr.110622-1506)System Manufacturer: ASUSTeK Computer INC.System Model: CM6630_CM6730_CM6830.Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2310 CPU @ 2.90GHz (4 CPUs), ~2.9GHz Memory: 8192MB RAM Available OS Memory: 8104MB RAM Page File: 2019MB used, 14187MB available DirectX Version: DirectX 11 I'm looking to run games such as SWTOR, League of Legends, Diablo 3, DOTA 2 etc. Nothing too graphically intensive but I would like to run these games at high to max setting. If I could do so without dropping more than $150 on a card even better.
