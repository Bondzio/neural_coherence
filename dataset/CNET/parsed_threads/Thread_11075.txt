<s> i was lookin for an LGA 775 micro atx motherboard with sli. </s>
<s> i want a small for factor pc that is made spicificly gaming. </s>
<s> if i make it i will also need to find a micro atx psu that is 600+ watts... i dont think they exist =(. </s>
<s> my pc right now is: intel C2D e6600, 250, 160 gb hdd, corsair 2 gb ddr2 ram, corsair 620 watt modular psu with 8 phase processor plug, nvidia 7900gtx ima make a new pc soon wen dx 10 games come out... my pc is pretty damn good right now but wen dx10 comes out it will lag. </s>
<s> i was thinkin about a shuttle pc kuz its small and easy to carry. </s>
<s> but if i cant make one ill go for full tower. </s>
<s> Any of the small form mtrbds. </s>
<s> usually are intended for &quot;media center&quot; type operation. </s>
<s> Any gaming concerns should really best served by sticking to typical mtrbd. </s>
<s> sizes and even those are smaller than older mtrbds. </s>
<s> You *may* find what fits your needs but overall just everything is going to become a factor or a need to deal. </s>
<s> There are 1000W PSUs and 600W can be had as well, just google aawy for them. </s>
<s> In this subject you should serious consider more on stable output rather than wattage alone. </s>
<s> Thus, a namebrand PSU will deliver more in the long run, unitl breached. </s>
<s> All in all, you should have a handle on specs and be crafty and handy as the case maybe. </s>
<s> If you put together items just from the shelf, the results are hit&miss, so beware. </s>
<s> As for Dx10, its still in the air, and any current video maybe totally out of the picture, so until its release and firmer known issues, best to wait, unless you know better. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> http://us.shuttle.com/Gaming.aspx find one that meets your specs and then you can find what mobo and power supplies they're using. </s>
<s> i just want a motherboard with sli that is micro atx for core 2 </s>
<s> Stick with a case light-weight (aluminum), well ventilated and easy access. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> shuttle's p2-3700 and sdxi both supports 2 single-slot crossfire cards: http://us.shuttle.com/P2_3700_5.aspx http://us.shuttle.com/SDXi.aspx i don't know what mobo is in these shuttles, but it's probably the only microatx board that supports 2 pci-express video cards. </s>
<s> the only chipset to support sli and core2duo is the nvidia 600 series and all motherboards based on it are atx. </s>
<s> but one 8800gt is faster than any two video cards with the same total price. </s>
<s> so if you want a fast gamer in a microatx box, sli isn't a must-have feature. </s>
