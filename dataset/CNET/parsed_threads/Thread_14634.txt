<s> Just got my MacBook and I'm wondering if a noise in my superdrive is normal. </s>
<s> So when I load a cd or dvd it sounds like the gears are working but there is also this sound like something is knocking up against the insides of the laptop. </s>
<s> Is this normal? </s>
<s> I'll write yes, its fine. </s>
<s> However if you had said it makes that sort of noise after the load is done I would tell you to listen to an unit at the store. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks I'll do that </s>
