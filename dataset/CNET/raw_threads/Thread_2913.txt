Previous: these operations worked 100s of times. Is this due to corrupt prefs? If so, which one? Using a Mac Pro, 10.6.7 w/ 8 GB RAM. No other problems. TIA for any help.

But - QT &quot;7&quot; is installed in the Utilities Folder &quot;under&quot; Snow Leopard. I have been using QT Pro - (that extra cost feature carries forward so that registered ,paid, users can continue to use QT Pro for basic movie editing) - since I upgraded to 10.6 about 6 months ago. Unless what you say is a more recent development, users should still be able to use QT 7 - Pro for basic editing. Apple did this split-off because they have a large number of customers who paid for the QT 7 Pro app and need it for actual movie editing tasks (which are not available in iMovie, for example). It gets a little complicated because iMovie has a different way of doing the voice overs and it (to my knowledge) cannot join short clips into a single larger clip. So - if you have specific information about using iMovie (or any Mac app) for these tasks, I'd appreciate knowing about it.

Check to see if your version still shows a Pro. It may need the activation number again to kick it back into life Just a thought P

I'd bet the problem lies with prefs (plists) but unless I know which one to delete I'm hesitant. In fact: QT Pro will still export to different file formats from .mov - just converted one audio.mov file to .aif with no trouble. But it won't do the two common operations I've described (and need). I have worked around the immediate problem: bought iMovie 11 from the Mac App Store and will be trying its new audio editing features (which Apple dropped after iMovie HD).
