i am having the exact same problem with my 5200. i called tech support and since i was no longer on the warranty, they wanted to charge me 10.00 to try and troubleshoot my problem.
he basically went thru everything on the website to clean the heads.
after 1 hr on he phone the tech support said that the unit needed to be serviced.
the unit is on barely 3 yrs old and used occasionally.
i went out and bought a hp.
it seems that the print head is a major issue with epsons.
i still have a hp 660cse deskjet 1o yrs old and still printing.
