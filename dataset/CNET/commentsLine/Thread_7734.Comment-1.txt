i have both wireless and voip connections that are stated to be excellent with 57 ms ping, 17.5 mbps download, and 3 mbps upload, yet i'm still getting horrendous voice reception.
two remaining possible fixes before i try a powered hub are trying different wifi channels and then upgrading to a 300 mbps wireless-n adapter, possibly dual-band.
regarding channel selection, i know there's a tradeoff in that those with the least interference tend to be the most congested.
what i'm wondering is if there's a way to measure these two things for all channels available to me in order to quickly home in on and test the best one rather than trying all channels across the entire spectrum, before upgrading my adapter.
all comments are appreciated.
thanks!
