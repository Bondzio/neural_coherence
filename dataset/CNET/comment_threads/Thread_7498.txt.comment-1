I have a total of four Maxtor hard drives (all are Ultra DMA 133) that I am trying to decide which one to use as my main drive.
The others will be used as storage drives.
My main uses of the computer are web browsing, games and video editing.
I have an MSI K8N Neo2 Platinum mainboard, Athlon 64 3500 cpu, 1 GB memory and am using a BFG 6800 GT video card (nVidia).
All of this is running Windows XP.
My four choices (actually only three since one drive is a Maxtor External, 300 GB Firewire/USB drive)are: - 80 GB Maxtor D740X (Model 6L080J4) 2 MB cache, 7200 rpm, &lt; 8ms seek time - 160 GB Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 9 (6Y160P0) 8 MB cache, 7200 rpm, 9.3 ms seek time - 250 GB Maxtor Maxline Plus II (7Y250P0) 8 MB cache, 7200 rpm, 9 ms seek time Any opinions are welcome!
