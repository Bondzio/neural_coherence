<s> I just bought an LCD TV, a Toshiba, and i also own a PS3 80gb. </s>
<s> I will be putting the TV on this media stand i got from office depot, with the PS3 under it. </s>
<s> I want to get a surge protector that you directly plug into both sockets on wall, has minimum 6 plugs, and protects the cable TV line. </s>
<s> The reason for the number of outlets is i will also be plugging in my cell phone charger and a lamp, as the stand is next to a desk. </s>
<s> I want it wall-mountable to save room. </s>
<s> Here's their link to it. </s>

<s> Hey, this does not have protection for coaxial cable, the cable line for TV. </s>
<s> That would be superfluous. </s>
<s> Those wall protectors are still basic protection, but better than nothing. </s>
<s> You can use them AND a strip surge protector(plug into) that may allow better access for AC warts and such. </s>
<s> I do suggest don't use all plug-ins as you may turn the AC outlet into electrical &quot;hot spot&quot;. </s>
<s> If you can, use yet another AC outlet. </s>
<s> I understand you maybe limited but its important as a safety fire issue. </s>
<s> If you like spend better $ on protection as you're items are high cost, its worth it. </s>
<s> As an added note, I put &quot;singular plug surge protector&quot; at the end of a AC cord, then into the strip or wall protector and/or UPS. </s>
<s> It seems redundant, but I've experienced mucho lightening hits over the yrs.. tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I just bought an HD TV and I found this on line at the APC web site. </s>

<s> It's on sale at $99 at APC. </s>
