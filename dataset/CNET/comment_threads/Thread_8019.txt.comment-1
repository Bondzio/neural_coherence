I have a 6800gs nvidia graphics card and i wanted to know what the best configuration to use with my Vizio 32&quot; HD LCD tv.
I am getting some spots on my tv.
i am using the VGA cable because the tv does not have a DVI connection.
i could use a DVI to a HDMI cable.
but i still don't know what setting i should use?
