ohhh noooooooo.... i bought this card (  ) for the pc in sig.
though the card is a behemoth, my tower is as well and all specs and advice claimed compatibility.
well the card fits (barely) in my tower, but the board placement of the two sata cables is in the way in the back and won't let the card be seated.
the same would apply for any of the card slots.
i have 2 hd's with 2 sata cables in raid0 from the hd to sata 1 and sata 2 on the mb.
the mb sata terminals 1-4 are in the way behind the card.
sata terminals 5-8 are on the side and out of the way.
can you plug the 2 hd cables into any of the sata terminals (5-8) and be ok?
if not, then what can i do?
if so, will that change anything or will i have to reconfigure anything?
bios?
raid0?
oh garshg.
