I've set-up a home network with two XP machines and one Win98 machine, which is connected to the house's printer. I am currently able to print through the network from the two XP nodes, but only when the Win98 machine is on. So everytime I want to print, I have to run down two floors, turn on the old system, wait for it to boot (5+ min), then print. Is there a way to set-up the printer so I don't have to turn on the Win98 machine and just leave the printer on 24/7 ready to print from the XP machines? It's done in offices, is it not? Thanks.

You didn't say what type of connection your printer has, but even if it's Parallel, you can buy one for about $50-$75 that goes from Parallel (USB,ect) to RJ45 (LAN Cable)and has a Web based interface to setup. I've use in an office environment and it worked well. Good Luck. (An Example:) http://www.pricegrabber.com/search_getprod.php/masterid=2687273/search=parallel+printer+server/promo_id=27/clt_id=42
