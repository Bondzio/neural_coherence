You may have noticed that the big comanys hold back what they can do. So I want to make a tablet that can do the very best with new technology. Some key feature are. *Tegra 4 processor *Mali GPU(haven't figured which one) *Hopefully a 4kTV 10 inch display *5-8mp rear camera plus a front facing 2-3mp camera depending on the cost *Latest version of Android with no skins *Pemium alloy casing(So it doesn't feel cheap) *16-10 ratio for watching movies and videos *Micro usb charging port *Maybe a Micro SD card and Micro hdmi *And the biggest battary we can fit So what would you change? And what would you add? What GPU would you like to have?

For this I'd pick the Intel Core i5 and a GPU from the top cards at this list. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html Anyone trying to get YET ANOTHER ANDROID TABLET is missing the boat. Angry Birds at 4K? Bob
