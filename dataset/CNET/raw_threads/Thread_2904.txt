Can I buy any card that fits my needs or do I need to get a card from the manufacture I bought my computer from. I dont want to buy something that wont work on my system. I bought my computer about 5 years ago.

It's a Dell, Dimension 4400, pent 4 processor 1.6 GHz, 16MB ATI Rage 4X AGP Graphics Card. I bought it back in 2002. I just upgrade my memory to 768 MB I don't want to spend to much money. I''m looking to spend no more then $200.00 to $300.00 for an upgrade. I would like to go less if I could.
