Someone suggested to put in the XP cd while it's booting and select the Repair XP option. Is this going to wipe out my hard drive??? Thanks, Desperate BlueLove73

I've tried system restore under safe mode as the administrator and now it will only bring up my wall paper; no icons, no task bar... what can I do???

Read http://tips.oncomputers.info/archives2004/0401/2004-Jan-11.htm If the volume is FAT32, a DOS diskette can be used to slowly drag off that thesis paper or what can't be lost. If you can get a second hard disk, in a pinch you can install the OS on that, add the original drive as slave and recover files (most of the time.) There are options. Bob

Neither a repair install or a new install into another folder will delete files on your system. The only time an install will delete files is when you have it remove and then replace the partition.
