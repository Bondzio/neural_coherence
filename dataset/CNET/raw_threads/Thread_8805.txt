HP,Dell and everyone else dont make their computers with quality. Notice how these computers have many hardware problems. And they come loaded with trial software. Listen Building a computer is easy and its alot cheaper. I garentee no hardware problems(unless you screw up something) Why do you take abuse from these big companies? Go to newegg.com Tigerdirect.com Or go to your local frys electronics. The parts you need: Motherboard Power supply Hard Drive dvd drive ram (memory) processor operating system disk screen Video Card The only problem is you you have to do your own product support

But i did test a pre realease version of vista on a old socket 478 pentuim 4. The only thing that did not work (which I fixed by the way) was sound and ethernet. Fixing hardware problems in vista is very easy for me.
