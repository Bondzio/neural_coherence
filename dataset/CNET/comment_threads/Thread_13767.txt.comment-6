Ok I tried a CD lens cleaner and I was able to burn a CD properly again.
I though &quot;great,&quot; and I'll try to see if DVD read functionality has been restored later.
Before I tried to see if I could read a DVD(about a week later) my whole drive disappeared!
It's not listed in My Computer, I can't find it in the device manager and if I try to type in &quot;D:&quot; to a address field it comes up with [Cannot find 'file:///d:/'.
Make sure the path of Internet address is correct.]
Any ideas on getting my cd rom drive back?
