1.1.1	I am in the process of building a computer and don't know what Graphics card to get.	St

1.3.2	http://www.pcworld.com/article/2040319/build-the-ultimate-intel-haswell-pc-for-under-1000.html I like a lot about that.	St
1.3.3	I could skip the SSD and change the GPU to what I noted above.	Sug
1.4.1	Do you know if the integrated graphics on the Haswell is much better than the one on Intel's DZ77GA-70K with Core i7-3770, which is the one that I have been contemplating buying.	St
