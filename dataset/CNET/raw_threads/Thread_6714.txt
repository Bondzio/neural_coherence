All systmes see it but none are receeving packets. I have disabled the firewall as well....not sure to be honest. Shame my PC did not come with a ONE BUTTON FIX all !

Other ISPs will give you a modem/router to use and when adding another router you may need to adjust the ISP's modem/router's settings. So without more information being given, only guesses can be made. Does the Internet work when connecting the modem directlt to a PC?
