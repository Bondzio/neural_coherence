a quick test i use for overheating is placing a household fan at open side of case cover removed.
if it lasts longer and/or remains on, good sign its overheating.
you didn't mentioned anything about your system but if it stuffed with pc goodies or has hi-end devices that generate heat, thjat too must be better cooled.
thus, a well vent system and/or added fans will do great.
better now components are decent as they age tend to become less stable and fail.
a psu should feel as its a big heat source, so don't conclude its that alone, but a cheap or over-taxed psu will become a candidate for failure if cooling isn't controlled.
i wish, i could offer more concrete advice, but have found a weak or bad psu a constant source of problems when pcs have added devices, bad cooling, location and/or overwhelmed cooling.
taken as a whole, a decent installed psu capable of handling all power demands and well ventilated case does wonders.
