<s> I recently purchased a gateway 510s with 1024mb of ram. </s>
<s> I bought it used from Goodwill and am trying to put together a computer for my grandfather. </s>
<s> It came without a harddrive. </s>
<s> when I turn the power on without a harddrive it will power up and I can get into the bios, but when I install an IDE harddive, it does not boot. </s>
<s> The fan runs, but the monitor remains black. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> Upside down, off by pin or row or the cable, drive is bad. </s>
<s> I haven't tried replacing the IDE cable yet. </s>
<s> I'll try that. </s>
<s> I really appreciate your help. </s>
