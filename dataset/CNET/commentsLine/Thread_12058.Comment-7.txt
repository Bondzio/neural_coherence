with upgrades it'll be good.
also u said 512 mb ram isnt enough...i have to disagree.... also yes the integrated gfx suks but if u put in any pci-express gfx card you'll c an improvement.
cept not really junk gfx cards usually cost like 550 at circuit city or compusa with a crt monitor and a printer.
