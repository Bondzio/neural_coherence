1.1.1	Hi guys , I 'll make this quick .	St
1.1.2	Basically i want a tablet that HAS to be 10+ inches ( So no small nexus 7 's ( Do n't see the point in a small tablet ) And i would like it too be pretty quick .	St
1.1.3	So dual core and some sort of tegra .	St
1.1.4	But the main thing ( Unless you can persuade me otherwise ) is i want a high res screen .	St
1.1.5	( I played on my friends ipad 2 and being able to see the pixels really annoyed me ) The best fit i can find is the nexus 10 , . however it 's out of my price range .	St
1.2.1	At the office we are porting apps so I get to play with a lot of tablets .	St
1.2.2	We got to try the cheaps , that is the ones half the cost of a Nexus and lower and always came away with issues .	St
1.2.3	Now those that buy such have their reasons but for now I think the bottom end is the Nexus and the rest is for folk that have a budget to meet .	St
1.2.4	That is , they have to compromise what they want to meet the budget .	St
1.2.5	The iPad with retina is great too .	Polite
1.2.6	And take another look at the Kindles .	Sug
1.2.7	Remember you did n't tell what use this is .	St
1.2.8	A rather poor and now poorer student thought it could stand in for a laptop !	St
1.2.9	Ouch !	St
1.2.10	Bob	St
1.3.1	Theres no need to pay that sort of cash for a tablet ... i got an android tablet for like less than half that and it was good for me .	St
1.3.2	Got it at this reltd.org website and have never had any problems .	St
1.3.3	Plus you dont need to tell anyone you didnt pay 200 odd quid for it lol	Sug
