that's a nice number but it means very little.
wireless is half duplex so even with a single machine you and the router will transmit over the top of each other and causes packet loss.
the so called speed will stay the same but when you have to retransmit the data multiple times the actual thoughtput tends to be much less.
when you start running more machines and have random interference from things who can say.
still there is not a lot of difference between brands because the key thing that would make it better (ie transmit power) is regulated by the government.
