<s> I have two computers,1 is a compaq presario using XP home edition the other is a E machine using Home XP edition. </s>
<s> I used the wizzard to set up a network and can get connectivity but the slave wants to use the modem to dial up instead of seeing the network? </s>
<s> I get the icon network connected. </s>
<s> Do i need to disable the modem on the slave? </s>
<s> what am i doing wrong here? </s>
<s> Jerry thanks </s>
<s> If setting the network control panel to use only the LAN didn't take, just use the device manager to disable the modem. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You indicated you used the wizard to configure your home network. </s>
<s> So I assume you set up the Internet Connection sharing and etc already. </s>
<s> Did you also go into your Internet Explorer &quot;Options&quot; and change your &quot;Connection&quot; settings on your &quot;slave&quot; machine? </s>
<s> If not, go into your Internet &quot;Properties&quot; and under the &quot;Connections&quot; tab there should be some radio buttons. </s>
<s> Select the one that says &quot;Never dial a connection.&quot; This should disable the modem. </s>
<s> If your connection does not work after this, you may want to try to &quot;Setup&quot; your connection again. </s>
<s> And when you do this choose the option to use your LAN connection. </s>
<s> The wizard should walk you through it. </s>
