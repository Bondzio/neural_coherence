So clock for clock, Intel $ for $, take your pick.
The summary benchmark of the Australian PC site was 95.5 for Intel 1.8 and 96 for AMD 2.0 I will have to do a lot more study to be sure which I want, but I have until July or August to decide when my son goes to college.
I don't think you can go wrong with either one and it will come down to price eventually for me
