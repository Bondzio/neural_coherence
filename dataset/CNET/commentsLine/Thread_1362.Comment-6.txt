i do the same things including keeping the cover off.
i just put the fan for the front of the case beneath the drive.
i aim it to blow air right on the hd.
that makes it much cooler to the touch.
i don't need the front case fan to blow into the case anymore.
with the case off the airflow is not going to be correct anyways.
as far as the mainboard or cpu area you can hang a 120v fan for electronics over them.
just plug it into the wall.
make sure it is for electronics so it does not emit electrical noise into your machine.
