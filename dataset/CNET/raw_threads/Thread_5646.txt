Then I tried the N range and the range expansion from linksys and still that did not work that good. I would get signal then it would go away then come back. What I really would like is a strong enough signal for my ps3 which has a built in wifi signal. I tested it out next to the router and it worked but I want the ps3 in tv room not the computer room. Thanks
