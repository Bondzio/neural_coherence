1.1.1	I am trying to decide on a desktop.	St
1.1.2	Before even picking out the model, I was wondering what your rankings of the companies are.	St
1.1.3	By choosing a company, I can go from there and buy a specific type.	St
1.1.4	Please, anyone, make a top list of the best companies out there.	St
1.1.5	(in your personal opinion of course) Thanks -J	St
1.2.1	IBM (oops, no more) then Dell, HP etc.	St
1.2.2	The big problem is that while most makers have fine hardware you might be installing Windows and have issues with Windows, or other software issue.	St
1.2.3	This is where it all breaks down and you find little support.	St
1.2.4	If you look at Apple you find a lot less in the virus, trojan, etc so that issue is not a big deal.	St
1.2.5	Support is better since you deal with just one company for the OS and hardware.	St
1.2.6	And you pay for what you get... Bob	St
1.3.1	Really?	St
1.3.2	May I ask why?	St
1.3.3	My six have performed flawlessly.	St
1.3.4	And they've all been refurbed from IBM.	St
1.4.1	Thankfully they had a great start in life with great products.	St
1.4.2	Let's hope it continues on.	St
1.4.3	But they still fail in meeting owner's support needs (Windows.)	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
