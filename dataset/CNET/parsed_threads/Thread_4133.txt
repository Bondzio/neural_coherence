<s> Is there a difference in performance between SOCKET 754 or 939 for AMD Athlon 64? </s>
<s> Given you didn't note any budget restraint, 939 gives you more memory bandwidth and access to the dual core CPUS. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> Since 939 is the way to go for future expansion (dual-core), how do you find out of a 939 MOBO supports 90nm. </s>
<s> I've looked with no luck. </s>

<s> Let's bring this down to Earth fast. </s>
<s> There are sites like www.tomshardware.com that have benchmarks. </s>
<s> But what I've seen is that motherboards rarely cause a benchmark to move about. </s>
<s> Since you didn't define what would be better (benchmark, dollars or such), your question can't be answered. </s>
<s> Even moreso you didn't supply any possible boards for consideration. </s>
<s> Here's why this matters. </s>
<s> Some posters are in Aus, some in Britain and what's available where you are may not be some board I would point at. </s>
<s> In closing, if your board supplier won't talk to you about this, why are you doing business with them? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> AMD provided mobo mfrs well in advanced the voltage levels that the chip would use. </s>
<s> Pretty certain that other parameters are internal chip parameters and both the 130 and 90's use the same pinouts. </s>
<s> However I think that John Robie had posted something that only certain models would support Dual Core. </s>
<s> Maybe email John. </s>
<s> Long range, however, because putting the MCH on the CPU chip has boxed them in to using only DDR [no DDR2]. </s>
<s> New socket scheduled for mid 2006 [but bet that they beat that if Intel does something to spur them to beat that schedule] for CPU's supporting DDR 2. </s>
