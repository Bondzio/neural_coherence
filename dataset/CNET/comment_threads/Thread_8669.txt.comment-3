Yep, logging on is already done with a username and password.
Thanks for the reply BTW.
I am totally stumped by this one; it's bizarre that my PC can see, and navigate the first couple of layers of the drive, but fails to access any further than that.
I do not personally believe its a problem with access permission, but am open to *ALL* suggestions!
