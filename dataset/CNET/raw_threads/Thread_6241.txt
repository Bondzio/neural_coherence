I uninstalled McAffee Security in preparation for a Zone Alarm download/install, and it seems that that caused my Network adapter to stop connecting to the internet. I'm running XP Home and its an Intel network card. I've tried deleting and reloading the card driver but it doesn't seem to be able to accept automatically assigned IP or DNS adresses. I've lost count of the variations of IPCONFIG that I've run. I'm thinking a remnant of McAffee might be causing it the fault but can anyone here think of a fix or something else that I haven't considered? Thanks Rich

I was online with my ISP tech support for about 2 hours (surprise, they were Canadian) I keep getting an error message saying there's limited or no access. I guess I'm looking for a fix on the automatically accept IP and DNS addresses problem. Thanks again Rich

I especially don't want to mess up a friend's computer. This whole problem started wiht the uninstall of McAfee so what I'd like to try first is to remove any McAfee registry entries or other files that uninstall may have left hanging around. I think it was the 2004 McAfee Antivirus. Can anyone tell me what I need to look for?
