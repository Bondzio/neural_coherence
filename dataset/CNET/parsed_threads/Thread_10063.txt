<s> OK, so I recently purchased a Belkin N+ wireless router, which I hooked up to my modem and connected to my wireless laptop (running Windows Vista Home Premium SP2). </s>
<s> Previously, I had a Linksys wireless router, and I would run my desktop (running Windows XP Pro SP3) through a LAN cable into my laptop and connect through the internet like that with no changes to internet settings (except &quot;Allow Users to Connect to the Internet Through this Computer&quot; on my laptop internet options). </s>
<s> After I setup the new Belkin router though, my desktop LAN connection through my laptop would not connect to the internet. </s>
<s> Finally, I got it to work by setting up a &quot;home network&quot; on my desktop, with the laptop as a gateway. </s>
<s> This was brand new, I didn't have to do this before for the desktop to connect to the internet. </s>
<s> Now my desktop shows the laptop as a gateway, in &quot;Network Connections&quot; it specifies the wireless laptop connection as the internet connection. </s>
<s> The laptop IPv4 address on the LAN connection also needs to be 192.168.0.1 (the same as the router default) in order for the desktop to connect to the web, not &quot;Automatically detect IP&quot;. </s>
<s> The problem is this, many webpages will not load (CNN.com, Java.com, etc. </s>
<s> ), they get locked halfway through loading, and programs cannot access the internet to update/communicate (BOINC communication doesn't work, JAVA updates won't download, PC Tools Spyware Dr. won't update). </s>
<s> Some will load (google.com, news.google.com). </s>
<s> Where is the problem here? </s>
<s> Why wouldn't my desktop connect to the internet through my laptop the way it did before the new router? </s>
<s> Is the &quot;home network&quot; complicating things? </s>
<s> Is this a firewall issue? </s>
<s> Why now if it is? </s>
<s> Something is blocking full internet access on my desktop, and I have a feeling it's tied to the network settings but can't pinpoint it. </s>
<s> I've already tried loosening program allowances in my McAfee firewall, but that doesn't seem to have helped. </s>
<s> Is there any chance of setting it up like most of us? </s>
<s> That is.... Internet -&gt; Router -&gt; PCs. </s>
<s> I don't have a wireless networking card in my desktop, just an ethernet card. </s>
<s> That's why I cannot connect my desktop directly to the wireless router (it's also physically too far away to run a cable into the router's ports). </s>
<s> It is what it is. </s>
<s> When you veer far off the usual setup you find it's troublesome. </s>
<s> Cables and wifi cards are pretty cheap at geeks.com and newegg.com. </s>
<s> What I find is that I have to give it time for people to feel it's worth the money. </s>
