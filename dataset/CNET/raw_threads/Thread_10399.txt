So now I'm looking for a new one, however, I can't find any good socket 939 agp mobos on Newegg. My old mobo: http://www.epox.com.tw/eng/products_content.php?ps=323 I need the equivilant of this, preferably from a reliable retailer and a noteworthy manufacturer. Thank you very much in advance, I really appreciate it
