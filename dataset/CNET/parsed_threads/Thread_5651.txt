<s> I need help. </s>
<s> I just built my first computer and when I powered it up there were no beeps and no display on the monitor. </s>
<s> The led lights and fans go on and and even the light on the motherboard goes on. </s>
<s> These are my parts: MB Asus P5B Deluxe P965 775 CPU Intel C2D E6300 1.86G 775M Video Card VGA EVGA GT -P2-N615-TX-R Memory 1G PQI DII667 MAC41GUOE R PSU Enermax ELT500AWT 500W RT HD 160G SAMG 7K 8M SATA2 HD160HJ </s>
<s> All we know: the power supply works and the fans and motherboard are powered. </s>
<s> It's up to you to find out what's wrong. </s>
<s> Possibilities include: - bad motherboard, CPU, memory, video card, monitor or cables - wrong or bad connections The least that should happen is the BIOS showing itself on the monitor, indeed. </s>
<s> Hope you find it. </s>

<s> DON&quot;T TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED. </s>
<s> Be sure no free mounting post is touching the bottom of mtrbd. </s>
<s> That all cabling and cards, modules are fully seated and retry again. </s>
<s> If no recovery, remove all devices and see what the results are. </s>
<s> If still no display, disassemble system to bare, place on cardboard and using only PSU and mtrbd. </s>
<s> what are the results after powering-ON? </s>
<s> Any beeps moans or complaints? </s>
<s> Repost after results. </s>
