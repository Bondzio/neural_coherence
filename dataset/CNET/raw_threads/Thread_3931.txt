The laptop has a built-in network card already. How can I set up the network? Windows XP is on both computers. Thanks for your help.

Do you have two computers that currently have wireless network cards in them? How do they get to the Internet? Who provides your access?

I want to use the wireless service on the laptop without having to remove the card from the desktop. What kind of router would I need to network the two computers? Thanks.

You might want to ask your EDGE service provider (Cingular?) if they recommend a router for those cards. OPTION 1: The ''Junxion Box'' should get you there, but it is expensive: http://reviews.cnet.com/Junxion_Box_JB_110B/4505-3319_7-31292890.html?tag=box http://www.junxion.com/product/ OPTION 2 (not sure about this one): You are saying that the desktop uses an EDGE card? If so, I don't know if you can bridge the desktop's EDGE card to its wired network adapter. If this can be done, you should be able to use Windows XP's Internet Connection Sharing (ICS). Internet ~ ~ ~ (EDGE card) Desktop (network adapter) ----- wireless router ~ ~ ~ laptop This option just requires the purchasing of an inexpensive wireless router. Again, I'm not sure about the bridging part.
