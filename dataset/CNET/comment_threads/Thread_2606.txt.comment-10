I am so disappointed with my Epson Artisan 810 printer.
The print heads clog and Epson refuses to warranty the product becuase we used non-Epson ink.
The problem is that the Epson ink is very expensive and the non-Epson is less expensive than the Epson ink.
(even though it is still much more expensive than Canon's - so you know what my next buy will be) It is a shame that a company like Epson would set such a trap for its loyal customers..
