place the failed drive in an usb external enclosure, wrapped tightly in a ziploc bag or plastic wrap.
then keep it in the freezer, with the usb cable trailing out to the computer.
computer too far away ?
place the frozen drive in a cooler with sealed gel ice packs.
i have not tried this, but it would keep the drive cold far longer, and would minimize condensation issues.
