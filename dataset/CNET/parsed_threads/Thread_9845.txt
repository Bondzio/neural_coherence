<s> When attempting to burn a new CD-R (on ROXIO), it always stops in the middle of the transaction...what could be causing this and is it fixable? </s>
<s> How can I test the drive to find the problem? </s>
<s> I've tried cleaning the drive by using a disk lens cleaner but to no avail. </s>
<s> Is to try another drive. </s>
<s> The problem is the drives cost so little (free to 40?) </s>
<s> that there are no machines or diagnostic software worth trying as the tech time and charges means we head straight to replacement. </s>
<s> HOWEVER Roxio's video creation is known to fail like you wrote and the drive recording features still work fine. </s>
<s> Only you could reveal more details to see if this is the usual video creation failure. </s>
<s> If it is, try DVD FLICK next (see google.com) Bob </s>
