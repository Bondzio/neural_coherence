all i can offer is that page timeouts are discussed in prior discussions.
your new post &quot;actually, i used the wrong term when i said &quot;error message&quot;.
i am actually getting the normal timed out message on all pages i try to enter, but if i restart the modem connection i am able to operate normally.&quot; again didn't supply any error message that points to anything specific.
since nav doesn't do parasites, and you didn't write what you do about such, your work and reply is incomplete.
best of luck, bob
