Hello, I connect to my company server through a VPN and must sync with a server folder for a program we use.
The network drive will not map unless the VPN connection is completed first.
As I usually use my company laptop for this purpose, I have found that if I check off the &quot;reconnect at log on&quot; box while mapping the network drive, it fails to do so at login because the VPN is not yet connected.
I tried adding the VPN shortcut to my start up program but Windows trys to logon the network drive prior to processing this folder.
Can I set this up so that the VPN will connect first and then map the drive afterwards, each time I start up my laptop?
I am using Windows XP Pro and shut down the laptop after each use for transport.
Thanks Mike
