You don't tell anything about what support you have on this device. - Isn't that in the manual? - And can't the support dept of the manufacturer or the company that installed it for you tell you?

They ask you for the serial number of the box and input into a program which generates the password. It is unique for each unit. Needless to say they protect that program since you could break into anyones equipment just knowing the serial number......they want to make money off it from people like you.
