Re the 3 GBs RAM....OK if you get 2 @ 1GB and 2 @ 512MB but you don't want 3 @ 1GBs ... you need RAM in pairs to maximize system performance.
If it were mine, I'd just bump it to 4GB RAM total....then there's no need to worry about upgrading later.
Re the MB....ditto my comments above.
While ASUS usually makes decent MBs...buyer comments on the model you've proposed are poor at best.
Re the HDD....WD640GB has better ratings and higher density per platter.
Last....re PSU....make sure it's a decent PSU..there's lots of pretty ones that aren't worth anything.
