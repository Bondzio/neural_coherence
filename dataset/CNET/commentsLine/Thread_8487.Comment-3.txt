what kind of sweatshop are you working in?
homeless shelters have better monitors than that.
seriously, i do the same kind of work and what you need is _high resolution_ as well as a physically large display.
crt is the best for resolution but lcd is catching up.
dell has a very nice 20&quot; lcd that will do 1600x1200 pixels.
it's usually around $650 but often on sale for $550.
if your cheapskate boss wont spring for that, you are better off getting a 22&quot;crt at $350 to $450.
nec and sony both make good ones.
don't bother with smaller lcd because they will only display 1280x1024.
crt vs lcd is a personal preference thing.
it's nice to not have a 70lb crt on your desk but you can't stack stuff on top of a lcd.
good luck.
