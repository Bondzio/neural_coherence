<s> I have a 160 Gig hard drive that I pulled out of a tivo unit. </s>
<s> I tried to format it to use in my desk top computer but my computer only sees 9 mb I tried to format it with the xp install disk but it too only sees 9 mb. </s>
<s> How do I format this disk drive for pc use </s>
<s> Look up DBAN on google and when you have that drive as the only drive in the machine use it. </s>
