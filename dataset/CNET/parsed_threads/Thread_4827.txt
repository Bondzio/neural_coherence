<s> Hello, Colleagues and I sometimes have the need to manipulate (fastforward, rewind, etc.) </s>
<s> up audio- and video-recordings. </s>
<s> Is there a device, a pedal, that will allow me to stop, start, rewind, and fastforward audio- and video-recordings without taking my hands off the keyboard? </s>
<s> I am transcribing interviews, and a pedal that is compatible with RealPlayer will be useful. </s>
<s> The computers involved are of diffent operating systems and models. </s>
<s> I posed this question to RealPlayer technical support, and they referred me to CNet. </s>
<s> Thank you, Jeffrey Lofton [Edited by: admin to remove member's phone number--Note to Jeffrey--it's probably not a good idea to post your phone number in public forum for the world to see.] </s>
<s> &quot;(fastforward, rewind, etc.) </s>
<s> up audio- and video-recordings&quot; is not something I see as a feature in RealPlayer so I'll write that it's not possible with this selected player. </s>
<s> &quot;The computers involved are of diffent operating systems and models.&quot; All this means is that once you solve the player issue then you get to work on getting each one working proper. </s>
<s> Sounds like good work porting to Linux, MacOSX, Windows versions, and support of all the machines. </s>
<s> My background includes some CCTV programming and while I know what you are after, your specs push this product's price through the level that most will pay for. </s>
<s> With cross OS and platform support that could hit the 1 million dollar mark with some exorbitant fees for onsite support to sort out specific machine issues. </s>

<s> http://www.editorskeys.com There are keyboards out there for both Mac and PC for use with a variety of video editing softwares. </s>
<s> I don't see Real listed. </s>
<s> I'll take that as a sign. </s>
