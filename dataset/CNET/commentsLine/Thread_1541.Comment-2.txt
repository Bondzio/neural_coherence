wired speed can be 100 megabit full duplex on a switched hub when maintains speed due to the switch.
i'll leave you to learn why a switched hub matters.
wifi might be 54 megabit half duplex and is on a shared airspace which can easily be interfered with.
your numbers are quite normal and you need to learn about the technology you are using.
i can't educate you about all this in this small space, but there are fine web contents that you can keep reading till it sinks in.
