complete failure i connected an external hard drive to two computers (winxp and win 2003) via firewire.. both pcs would not even detect the hard drive.
one at a time they would and when you hook up the second cable, the first computer would disconnect (and second one wouldn't find the drive).. so i didn't even get in the fun stuff of testing simult.
writing etc too bad.
by the way, windows 2003 is not too good with plug-and-play firewire.. it would ocassionally not detect it and i had to 'add new hardware'.. plus is you boot it with hard drive attached it would often just freeze.. no problems with winxp though.
proves yet again that 2003 and xp are very different oss and they just look similar.
