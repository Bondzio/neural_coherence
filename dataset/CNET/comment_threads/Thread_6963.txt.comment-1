I have a Pluscom WU-ZD1211B USB adaptor.
I have disabled my in built driver and card as recommended and folowed the remainder of the set up instructions.
None of which has given me internet access.
I disabled the win zero config option and that improved matters allowing PLUSCOM to become the only connection.
I now have visible connection on my pluscom under station mode showing 100% signal strength link quality as 84% I have set the WEP key as per the one I use on the Router and the connection is set as ad-hoc.
depite allof this I still can not connect to the internet.
I have a solid green light on my USB connector but I can not connec to any pages.
Does anyone have any experience of these devices and can you advise what I've missed please?
Cheers Pete NB, this was submited from an independent machine..
