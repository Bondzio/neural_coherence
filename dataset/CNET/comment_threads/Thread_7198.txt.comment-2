Android tablets are still on the fiddly side so stick to those names.
As to Blu-Ray quality that's an easy no.
No 24p playback so it falters right at get go.
We have a lot of tablets at the office but not the Apple because of no serial port profile so our apps are not possible.
It's a nice tablet.
It's odd that the folk are not aware of SD card solutions if you want to carry stuff on that media.
I own of of those Kingston WiFi 32GB cards so that's another way.
