btw your bios is set by your cpu (central processing unit)and motherboard, which it is attached to.
try pressing 'delete' key on your keyboard immediately on the first screen on booting up.
a screen will appear which you can only work by using the keyboard.you have to navigate to see if your storage devices are recognised.
