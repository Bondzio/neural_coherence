<s> I have Toshiba HD part # MK2023GAS which also has a HP part # J6054B the drives work fine individually but when I try to connect them as master and slave none of the drives are detected. </s>
<s> Any Suggestions? </s>
<s> Use the shiny new 80 conductor cable and set the drives to CABLE SELECT. </s>
<s> Master/Slave is so 1990's. </s>

<s> Besides what Robert has already stated, understand how your HD is actually configured by the jumpers. </s>
<s> Cable select should with the newer type 40-pin/80-wire IDE cables provide the fix. </s>
<s> If not, then the HD jumpers may need an added jumper for solo or dual operation, if applicable. </s>
<s> So visit the HD makers website to see how they expect their operation to be set for dual install or check that decal/sticker found on the HD. </s>
